Credit: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg\nvia Getty\n\nSome 970 million people in India will head to the ballot box starting on 19\nApril in a general election that polls predict will see Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), win a third five-year\nterm. Many scientists in India are hopeful that the next five years could\nbring greater spending on applied science. But some have also expressed\nconcerns. Among these are that funding is not increasing in line with India\u2019s\nbooming economy, and that the government\u2019s top-down control of science, as\nsome researchers see it, allows them little say in how money is allocated.\n\n## More money\n\nModi first became India\u2019s prime minister in 2014. Since then, the total pot of\nmoney for research and development has increased. But relative to India\u2019s\ngross domestic product (GDP), spending on R&D dropped from 0.71% in 2014\u201315 to\n0.64% in 2020\u201321, the most recent financial year for which data are available\n(see \u2018Stagnant funding pool\u2019). This continues a decades-long trend that began\nunder Modi\u2019s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, and is lower than for some of\nIndia\u2019s peers: China spent 2.4% of GDP on R&D in 2021, Brazil spent 1.3% and\nRussia spent 1.1%.\n\nPublic funding that fails to keep up with growing GDP is a particularly acute\nproblem for science in India, because the government is the main funder of\nresearch, says Rohini Godbole, a particle physicist at the Indian Institute of\nScience in Bangalore. Government funding accounts for some 60% of R&D\nspending. By contrast, in the United States, just 20% of total R&D spending\ncomes from the government \u2014 with industry and philanthropy contributing the\nrest.\n\nThe relative lack of funds hasn\u2019t stopped India from making big strides\nforward: in 2023, the nation became only the fourth in the world to\nsuccessfully land a spacecraft on the Moon. Scientists note that this was done\nat a fraction of the budget of other missions. The Indian Space Research\nOrganisation (ISRO) \u201cis known as one of the most frugal organizations in the\nworld\u201d, says Venni Krishna, a science-policy researcher at the University of\nNew South Wales, in Sydney. They\u2019re \u201cdoing a fantastic job\u201d. Researchers in\nIndia have also contributed to significant advances in developing drugs and\nvaccines.\n\nBut researchers say that other areas of research have been hampered by funding\nshortfalls, despite announcements that have suggested the opposite. \u201cThe\ngovernment is serious in terms of their policy pronouncements. But when it\ncomes to putting the money in, it\u2019s been very conservative,\u201d says Krishna.\n\nIn August 2023, the government passed a bill to set up the National Research\nFoundation (NRF), modelled on the US National Science Foundation \u2014 a move that\nmany researchers applauded. The government promised 500 billion rupees (US$6\nbillion) for the NRF over 5 years, 28% of which \u2014 some 140 billion rupees \u2014\nwould come from public funds, and the rest from private and philanthropic\nsources. But the government spent only 2.6 billion rupees on the NRF in\n2023\u201324, according to India\u2019s Ministry of Finance. \u201cThis is a very, very\nnegligible amount of money,\u201d says Ramvilas Ghosh, a researcher who studies the\ndiversity of marine organisms at Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean\nStudies in Kochi.\n\nFor 2024\u201325, the government allocated 20 billion rupees for the NRF, still\nshort of its initial commitment, and it has not clarified where the private\nfunding will come from, says Ghosh.\n\nAnother project affected by a funding shortfall is the National Quantum\nMission. In 2023, the government promised 60 billion rupees for this over\neight years, in an attempt to build quantum computers and develop quantum\ncommunications, metrology and materials. The government spent 50 million\nrupees on the mission in 2023\u201324, and committed 4.8 billion for 2024\u201325.\n\nNature asked representatives of the Indian government for clarification on\nfunding arrangements, but received no response.\n\n## More basic science\n\nIndian scientists are part of some prominent international collaborations,\nincluding CERN, which operates Europe\u2019s particle-physics laboratory near\nGeneva, Switzerland, and ITER, an international nuclear-fusion project based\nin Saint-Paul-l\u00e8s-Durance, France. But progress on similar, home-grown\ninitiatives in basic-science has been slow over the past decade. When the\ninternational LIGO collaboration announced in 2016 that it had made the first\ndirect detection of gravitational waves, Modi posted on social media that he\nhoped India would move forwards with a detector of its own. But it took\nanother seven years for LIGO-India to be approved by the country\u2019s cabinet.\n\u201cProgress is still slow,\u201d says Godbole.\n\nAn Indian neutrino observatory, approved in 2015, has stalled because of\nenvironmental concerns over the site\u2019s location. \u201cEven if it takes off, its\nrelevance is going to be marginal, because of the number of years that went\nby,\u201d says Godbole.\n\nPart of that might reflect changing priorities. Science is seen increasingly\nas a tool for development, Godbole says, meaning more funds for technological\ninnovation and socially relevant research at the cost of basic research. Umesh\nWaghmare, a theoretical and applied physicist at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre\nfor Advanced Scientific Research in Bangalore says that the current science\necosystem incentivizes applied research, from funding to new awards for\ntechnological innovation and missions focused on developing devices. A Modi\nwin is likely to speed up this push for more applied and translational\nresearch, says Waghmare, who is also president of the Indian Academy of\nSciences, Bangalore.\n\n## More autonomy\n\nBut the government could usefully loosen its tight grip over funding\ndecisions, with high-level government officials having more of an advisory\nrole, and more decision-making powers being given to scientific committees,\nsays Waghmare. \u201cSignificantly greater autonomy is essential,\u201d he says.\n\nThe NRF is headed by the Prime Minister, ministers and secretaries of\ngovernment departments, as well as representatives of the business and\nscientific community picked by the Prime Minister.\n\nAnd when it comes to public funds, the same rules that govern the construction\nof large projects such as railways or bridges also apply to smaller research\nprojects, which is \u201crather unfair\u201d, says Shekhar Mande, former director-\ngeneral of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in Pune.\n\nEven when researchers have been allocated money, it\u2019s been difficult for them\nto spend all of it, says Shailja Vaidya Gupta, who served as a senior adviser\nat the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India\nbetween 2019 and 2021. That\u2019s because administrative and financial rules for\nhiring staff, and for purchasing equipment and laboratory supplies, are\ncomplex and constantly changing, she explains.\n\nIn 2023\u201324, only an estimated 65 billion of the 106 billion rupees initially\nallocated for the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of\nBiotechnology was spent. Gupta hopes that the government will trust\nresearchers more, and will allow them greater flexibility in how they spend\ntheir budgets. A large part of ISRO\u2019s success was a result of the decades of\nadministrative and financial autonomy that it was afforded, which offers a\nmodel to follow, says Gupta.\n\nAs in India\u2019s previous general election in 2019, science has not featured\nheavily on the 2024 campaign trail. Researchers say they don\u2019t expect to see\nsubstantial changes to science policy, whatever the result. \u201cScience is not at\nall part of the political discourse,\u201d says Achal Agrawal, who founded the\nIndian Research Watchdog, a volunteer group for investigating research\nintegrity. In that sense, the elections starting next week are unlikely to\nprovide a big turning point for Indian science. \u201cWhether Modi wins or loses,\nit is going to be more of the same.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00956-2\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * How five crucial elections in 2024 could shape climate action for decades\n\n  * India bets big on quantum technology\n\n  * Indian elections fall flat on science\n\n  * Intolerance and funding concern Indian scientists ahead of election\n\n  * Global scholars decry funding ban on influential Indian research centre\n\n  * Can India\u2019s new billion-dollar funding agency boost research?\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Funding\n  * Policy\n  * Politics\n\n## Latest on:\n\nBrazil budget cuts could leave science labs without power and water\n\nNews 08 APR 24\n\nWill the Gates Foundation\u2019s preprint-centric policy help open access?\n\nNews 04 APR 24\n\nTime to sound the alarm about the hidden epidemic of kidney disease\n\nEditorial 03 APR 24\n\nHow to break big tech\u2019s stranglehold on AI in academia\n\nCorrespondence 09 APR 24\n\nBrazil\u2019s postgraduate funding model is about rectifying past inequalities\n\nCorrespondence 09 APR 24\n\nDeclining postdoc numbers threaten the future of US life science\n\nCorrespondence 09 APR 24\n\nAI-fuelled election campaigns are here \u2014 where are the rules?\n\nWorld View 09 APR 24\n\nBrazil budget cuts could leave science labs without power and water\n\nNews 08 APR 24\n\nThe EU\u2019s ominous emphasis on \u2018open strategic autonomy\u2019 in research\n\nEditorial 03 APR 24\n\nBrazil budget cuts could leave science labs without power and water\n\nNews 08 APR 24\n\nWill the Gates Foundation\u2019s preprint-centric policy help open access?\n\nNews 04 APR 24\n\nTime to sound the alarm about the hidden epidemic of kidney disease\n\nEditorial 03 APR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Group Leader at Cat\u00f3lica Biomedical Research Centre and Assistant or Associate Professor at Cat\u00f3lica\n\nGroup Leader + Assistant/Associate Professor, tenure-track position in\nBiological and Biomedical Sciences, Data Science, Engineering, related fields.\n\nPortugal (PT)\n\nCat\u00f3lica Biomedical Research Centre\n\n  * #### Faculty Positions at SUSTech Department of Biomedical Engineering\n\nWe seek outstanding applicants for full-time tenure-track/tenured faculty\npositions.
