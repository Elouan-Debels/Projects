Not wanting to work makes me feel bad.\n\nMy identity is tied up in liking to work hard! And I work for myself - it\u2019s\nvery easy to slack off. Not wanting to work makes me feel lazy. It makes me\nfeel like I need to buckle down, and I feel like something is wrong with me\nwhen I can\u2019t.\n\nThis used to make me upset. I\u2019d spend days distracted, neither fully working\nnor fully relaxing. Now when this happens I tell myself:\n\nYou love to work. That hasn't changed. Something else needs to.\n\nThis reframing has been a revelation for me. Thinking this way makes it easier\nto change my process, helps me find what excites me, and makes it easier to\nconsciously take breaks. Here are some questions I ask in order to isolate\nwhat needs to change.\n\n## The questions\n\n  1. Does my project have a name? Can I give it one?\n  2. Can I picture my project\u2019s end result? If I can\u2019t, what can I change so that I can?\n  3. Do I know the remaining steps? Can I write them down?\n  4. Can I tell someone what I\u2019m working on? Am I excited to do that?\n  5. Do I like my tools? Should I change them?\n  6. Can I work from somewhere else?\n  7. Do I like what I\u2019m working on? Should I change it?\n  8. Would taking the day off make me feel good? Or would it make me feel bad?\n  9. Am I bored?\n\n     * When\u2019s the last time I played a game I loved?\n     * ...or watched a movie I loved?\n     * ...or hung out with someone I loved?\n  10. Have I exercised recently?\n  11. Have I played enough piano this week?\n  12. Can I go for a walk?\n\nThese questions fall into three loose categories.\n\n## Getting excited about work\n\nSometimes I need a shot of enthusiasm about an existing project to get it over\nthe finish line. My enthusiasm comes from two places:\n\n  * Internal enthusiasm: getting myself excited about what I\u2019m doing\n  * External enthusiasm: seeing others excited about what I\u2019m doing\n\n### Internal enthusiasm\n\nMy friend Max once compared internal enthusiasm to how lightning strikes.\nAfter building up an electrical field, lightning traces a path of molecules\nbetween the cloud and the ground. It creeps down in short jumps, planning a\nroute and identifying its target. And then suddenly the path is known, the\nmolecules are aligned and ionized, and lightning strikes.\n\nthe eiffel tower prepares to put flappy bird inside macos finder\n\nMissing internal enthusiasm often means my molecules haven\u2019t aligned yet - I\ndon\u2019t know the path I\u2019m taking or can\u2019t fully picture the target that I\u2019m\nstriking. When I don\u2019t know the path I can feel overwhelmed or unsure of where\nto start, which leads to high startup costs and work sessions that feel\nsluggish. And when I can\u2019t picture the target - when I can\u2019t already feel how\nI\u2019ll feel when it\u2019s done - it\u2019s harder for me to get excited. This is a\nproblem because excitement is the primary reason I build!\n\nTo clear a path for myself I write down a series of concrete steps I can take\nto make progress. Like lightning\u2019s small jumps, this doesn\u2019t need to be\neverything needed to reach the ground; it just has to be enough to keep going.\nI like to do this at the end of a day - a list of next steps is a great\npresent to future me, especially when I\u2019m struggling to get started in the\nmorning.\n\nPicturing (and feeling) the final target is difficult and personal. But my\nfavorite trick is coming up with a name. Here are some names that I\u2019m proud\nof:\n\n  * hexagone: a font that removes hex codes\n  * talk paper scissors: rock paper scissors, played by voice\n  * stranger.video: a site for staring at strangers\n\nPicking these names helped me identify the theme and mood of the project,\nwhich is a key component of aligning my excitement molecules.\n\n### External enthusiasm\n\nI like it when people like what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s validating. It makes me\nwant to work harder and finish sooner. I\u2019m unlikely to drop a project that\nlots of people are excited about.\n\nYou can place sources of external enthusiasm on a sliding scale with personal,\nsupportive, and (typically) smaller spaces on one side and larger impersonal\nspaces on the other. Mine looks something like this:\n\nmy girlfriend sees a lot of nonsense\n\nSmaller supportive communities are great because you\u2019re likely to hear\npositive things and you\u2019re likely to hear anything at all - if I text a friend\nthey will probably respond and probably not be a jerk^1.\n\nLarger communities can be enthusiasm killers when they\u2019re mean or silent, but\nI find getting a positive response to a WIP extremely motivating. Large\nimpersonal communities are also more effective for gauging the response a\nproject will get. It\u2019s outside the scope of this article, but if you\u2019re\ninterested in this dichotomy I recommend Derek Yu\u2019s essay on feedback in\ngames.\n\nMy favorite places to look for external enthusiasm are personal enough to be\nsupportive but large enough that I can learn something from the response that\nI get. Recurse Center is perfect for this (consider applying!).\n\nHowever, I try not to overthink things here. I rarely regret sharing my work,\nand a shot of external enthusiasm is often just what I need to remind myself\nwhy I\u2019m making something.\n\n## Changing how I work\n\nSometimes I need to change my tools. Other times I need a change of scenery or\nschedule.\n\n### Changing my tools\n\nI\u2019ve struggled to write this section because my tools (and how I change them)\nfeel so personal. I have no advice for you about what tools to use. But I can\ntell you that using tools that I don\u2019t like prevents me from effectively\nchanneling my personality into my projects.\n\nAt the start of 2024 I stopped using the game engine Godot. I had repeatedly\ndropped Godot projects that I was enthusiastic about, and (after great\nstruggle) had realized that Godot was getting in the way.\n\nI kept using Godot for months after realizing that I didn\u2019t love it. I\u2019d tell\nmyself \u201cwork isn\u2019t always fun\u201d and try to push through. After several failed\nprojects I made a list of my preferences. My preferences aren\u2019t the point, but\npart of the list looked like this^2:\n\nif you could read this, it'd tell you I \"don't like the mouse\" and \"want a\ncode formatter\"\n\nThe point is that I\u2019d let the idea that \u201cwork isn\u2019t always fun\u201d go far too\nfar. It\u2019s true that you sometimes have to do something unpleasant to make\nsomething cool; switching tools every time you hit a bump is a recipe for lost\nproductivity. But so is joyless work.\n\n### Changing where I work\n\nI know I\u2019m deeply into a project when I start coding before I finish my\ncoffee. I typically don\u2019t start coding before I finish my coffee.\n\nThe easiest way for me to get started sooner is to work in a place where it\nfeels weird to browse the internet for hours.\n\nSometimes this is my desk. I often remind myself that all I need to do is \u201csit\nin the chair\u201d - if I\u2019m sitting in my desk chair I tend to produce work I\u2019m\nproud of^3. But sometimes that isn\u2019t enough.\n\nstraight from a facebook marketplace sale\n\nWhen this happens I go somewhere else. My favorite places to work from are\ncommunities with coworking spaces (Recurse and Gumbo for me) but I\u2019m also\npartial to coffee shops with bad wifi.\n\nThe space itself isn\u2019t too important. Again, what\u2019s really important is being\nin a space where just browsing the internet feels wrong.\n\n## Improving how I feel\n\nSometimes all I need is a good, work-free day. This is my favorite problem!\nSolving it is fun, it\u2019s broadly applicable to my life (I think about this with\nmy hobbies in addition to my work), and I feel like a genius when I properly\naddress it.\n\nThis can also be the most difficult problem to solve. It can feel like\ncheating to handle being unproductive by being less productive.\n\nMy favorite solution here is to go see a movie at a weird time. Going to a\nmovie on a weekday afternoon is one of the great joys of working for yourself.\nThe last time I did this I saw Poor Things.\n\nEmma Stone considers whether Godot is right for her\n\nIt was great. Go see it! But if it\u2019s not playing by you^4, maybe take a nice\nwalk. Call a friend. Do something fun. For me, what matters is having full\npermission to stop working.\n\nMy therapist sometimes reminds me to extend myself the same grace I\u2019d extend\nto a good friend. It\u2019s great advice, and it\u2019s at the front of my mind when I\ntake a day off to recharge.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nTo summarize, when I don\u2019t want to work...\n\n  * I don\u2019t call myself lazy. I trust that I haven\u2019t changed and look for what needs to.\n  * I get excited about the end result and share what I\u2019m doing with others.\n  * I consider whether my tools are getting in my way\n  * I give myself the same grace I\u2019d give someone else, and consider taking a proper break\n\nLast week I was struggling to work. I wasn\u2019t excited about my current project.\nI took two days off and played a bunch of games and piano. I realized that I\nwas excited to write this essay. And so I sat in a chair (not on the couch!)\nand wrote it.\n\n  1. I probably text my friends about my games too much. Sorry friends. \u21a9\n\n  2. You can kind of get some of these things in Godot. If you\u2019re ok with busted web exports you can have first-class functions in Godot 4. You can unpack values inside match statements. But listen. I didn\u2019t like using it. GDScript felt like bad Python. Stop making me defend myself! \u21a9\n\n  3. I\u2019m sitting in my desk chair right now! \u21a9\n\n  4. It probably isn\u2019t, this was months ago, sorry. \u21a9\n\nget new posts via twitter, substack, rss, or a billion other platforms or\nsubscribe to my newsletter right from this page!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
