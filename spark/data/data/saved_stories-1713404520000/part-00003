In fact, it was my experiences at Katerra that inspired me to\nstart this newsletter in the first place. Katerra\u2019s collapse became a\ncautionary tale about overenthusiastic investment, too-rapid scaling, and the\nhubris of outsiders assuming they could improve industries they didn\u2019t really\nunderstand.\n\nBut the company\u2019s ignominious ending apparently hasn\u2019t dulled the founders\u2019\nenthusiasm for solving the problems of the construction industry. The original\nKaterra upper management team, including Katerra\u2019s founder Michael Marks, is\nback with a new construction startup, ONX Homes (pronounced \u2018onyx\u2019).\nHeadquartered in Florida, the company has raised around $200 million in\ninvestment, and built over 500 single-family homes so far, with another 1,500\nin development.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to peek under the hood of ONX Homes, especially in light of\nits Katerra connection. ONX is doubling down on some features of Katerra that\nseemed to work the first time, while trying to avoid some of Katerra\u2019s\nmissteps. The founders have clearly learned from the Katerra experience, but\nthey\u2019re also running a different type of business, which will come with its\nown set of challenges.\n\n####\n\nFrom Katerra to ONX\n\nA brief background: Katerra was founded in 2015 by Michael Marks, the former\nCEO of contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics, which under his tenure\nbecame the largest contract electronics manufacturer in the world.1 Like so\nmany companies before it, Katerra attempted to revolutionize the construction\nindustry by applying lessons from manufacturing: rationalize and streamline\nsupply chains, offer \u201cproductized\u201d buildings based on standard designs instead\nof a series of one-offs, and use factory production to construct buildings\nefficiently. Katerra raised over $2 billion in venture capital from Softbank\nand other investors, hired thousands of people, and was building factories\nacross the country and around the world.\n\nBut Katerra\u2019s reach exceeded its grasp, and the company\u2019s rapid scaling took\nplace before it had found product-market fit. This resulted in a series of\npainful and expensive pivots, severe layoffs, replacing Marks with a new CEO,\na 90% cut in valuation, and, finally, bankruptcy. (Those interested in a\nlonger history of Katerra can read my previous post on the company here.) Now,\nMarks and much of the original Katerra team are back with a variation on the\nsame basic idea.2\n\nONX Homes, founded in 2021, is a single-family home building company currently\noperating in South Florida. The company has chosen what might appear to be an\nunusual palette of building systems. Instead of using light-framed wood (which\nmost US homes are built from) or concrete block (used in many Florida homes\nfor better wind resistance), ONX builds its homes from precast concrete: that\nis, concrete pieces cast in a factory and then transported to the jobsite.\nWalls, stairs, floor slabs, and even foundations are made from precast\nproduced in ONX\u2019s own factories. ONX also uses precast concrete bathroom pods,\nwhich arrive from the factory with nearly all the fixtures, finishes and\nservices already installed. Using this system, ONX boasts that it can build a\nnew home in just 30 days.\n\nONX homes under construction\n\nUnlike most large homebuilders, ONX\u2019s construction process is entirely\nvertically integrated. It designs the homes, supplies the materials for them,\nfabricates the components in its factories, and constructs them on-site. And,\nrather than working with developers, ONX is doing its own development and land\nacquisition, and selling its homes directly to consumers.\n\nThough right now ONX is only operating in Florida, the company has larger\nambitions. A Texas factory is coming online later this year, which ONX plans\nto follow with factories in California, Nevada, and Arizona. Ultimately ONX\naims to serve not only the entire US, but the rest of the world.\n\nThe leadership of ONX is, as far as I can tell, all former Katerra leadership.\nMichael Marks is co-founder and Chairman. The CEO is Ash Bhardwaj, who led\nKaterra\u2019s Middle East division. ONX President Trevor Schick, COO Ravi Bhat,\nChief Design Officer Nejeeb Khan, and co-founder Nic Brathwaite are all also\nformer Katerra top management.\n\n####\n\nSimilarities to Katerra\n\nThe ONX team are downplaying their previous efforts at Katerra, but it\u2019s\nimpossible not to make the comparison: much of the Katerra playbook is being\nrun again with ONX.\n\nThe most obvious similarity is a focus on factory-built construction. Though\nKaterra shifted its material palette over time based on the perceived\neconomics (cycling through mass timber, light framed wood, and light gauge\nsteel depending on the day), factory-based construction to reduce costs and\nincrease speed and quality was always the core of its value proposition. And\nwhile Katerra\u2019s US operations never really made use of precast concrete, there\nwas a substantial operation in the Middle East that built precast single-\nfamily homes, just like ONX is using. ONX is also making use of other\ntechnology Katerra chose, such as Framecad CFS machines. Marks and the Katerra\nteam came from a manufacturing background, and still clearly believe that\nmanufacturing and factory-based automation can solve the problems in the\nconstruction industry.\n\nHowever, with both ONX and Katerra, the level of factory construction and\nautomation isn\u2019t quite as high as their marketing suggests. Katerra never\nsuccessfully deployed high-level of completion wall panels, and construction\nalways required a significant amount of on-site work. Likewise, though ONX\ntalks about factory construction, relatively little besides the bathroom pods\ngets installed in the factory. The walls are basic concrete sandwich panels\nwith a layer of insulation in them, and much of the work \u2014 including services,\ndrywall, and finishes \u2014 must be site-installed. Like Katerra, ONX styles\nitself as a \u201ctechnology\u201d company rather than a construction company, and goes\nto great efforts to put the tech company sheen on its operations (emphasizing\nits use of AI, talking about patents and IP, etc.).\n\nAn ONX home under construction. Everything that\u2019s not concrete was site\ninstalled.\n\nONX is also following Katerra in its level of vertical integration. Katerra\naimed at integrating every part of the construction process: it would design\nand engineer buildings using Katerra-branded materials, manufacture them in\nKaterra factories, and build them on-site using Katerra labor and trades.\nKaterra aimed to be an integrated connection between commoditized material\nsuppliers and developers, and to capture the majority of the value in the\nprocess.\n\nKaterra\u2019s attempted restructuring of the building value chain, via Design Bid\nBuild and the Construction Value Chain\n\nONX appears to be doing something similar. Not only is it doing its own\ndesign, manufacturing, and construction, but it appears to have a material\nsupply arm of the company as well. The material and building product brand of\nKaterra was called Kova, and Kova-branded construction materials are now back\nin what seems to be part of the ONX effort.3 Kova\u2019s offerings are very\nreminiscent of what Katerra\u2019s Kova was selling, down to the custom-designed\nHVAC unit (which was a major Katerra initiative).\n\nKova\u2019s product offerings\n\nBut ONX is going even further in its vertical integration than Katerra did.\nNot only is ONX doing material supply, design, manufacturing and construction,\nbut it's also acting as the developer, acquiring land and selling to\nconsumers. Clearly the team felt that trying to sell \u201cproducts\u201d to developers\nwas a major drawback to the Katerra strategy.\n\nONX is also following a similar scaling plan to Katerra\u2019s. ONX is in Florida\nnow, but plans on scaling to Texas, California, Arizona and Nevada next. While\nKaterra never operated in Florida, its main US operations were in the latter 4\nstates. Katerra had factories in Texas, California and Arizona, and many of\nits early projects were in California, Arizona and Nevada.\n\n####\n\nDifferences from Katerra\n\nBut while ONX Homes is clearly based on the Katerra playbook, there are some\nkey differences in the two companies.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, ONX is acting as the land developer, which Katerra never did.\nInstead of selling its products and services to developers, ONX will sell its\nhomes directly to consumers. This means that despite the surface level\nsimilarities, ONX is fundamentally a different kind of business: B2C, instead\nof B2B.\n\nAnd though both companies pursued a strategy of leveraging manufacturing and\nfactory-based construction, ONX is focusing on precast concrete, whereas\nKaterra used a broader palette of building systems, most of which were based\non wood. Besides the obvious cost and performance differences, one difference\nbetween precast and wood is the level of technical maturity. While both\nprecast and wood framing can be factory-produced at a high level of\nautomation, precast is much more mature, and much closer to a \u201csolved\nproblem.\u201d Highly automated precast plants have been in use for decades and are\ncommon throughout the world, while automated light-frame and mass timber\nmanufacturing are somewhat newer, less common, and less \u201cfigured out.\u201d Despite\nONX\u2019s emphasis on technology and innovation, it\u2019s actually chosen a more\nconservative building system. This reduces risk, but it also means I don\u2019t\nexpect to see many radical innovations on the building technology side.4\n\nKaterra marketing material, a CLT cube.\n\nThis brings us to another major difference. Katerra was overwhelmingly focused\non using factory-built construction to drive cost savings. The company aimed\nto use economies of scale in manufacturing to produce buildings less\nexpensively than anyone else (\u201cBetter, faster, cheaper\u201d was the tagline while\nI was there). ONX, on the other hand, seems to realize that even with factory\nconstruction, it\u2019s unlikely to be able to build homes for cheaper. Current ONX\nhomes are priced in the neighborhood of $200 per square foot (including\nland).5 While not astronomical, that price certainly does not make ONX the\nlow-cost producer. Indeed, ONX merely claims its homes are \u201ccost competitive\u201d\nwith other homes. Instead, the ONX value proposition is based on greater\nbuilding speed, more resilient construction, and lowered total cost of\nownership. ONX aims to deliver homes that are built faster and are more\nresilient to wind, fire and other disasters. This resilience, in turn, will\nlower insurance and maintenance costs. And with a tightly sealed, highly\ninsulated building envelope, and technology like its \u201cAI\u201d-driven HVAC system\n(whatever that means), energy costs will be reduced as well.\n\nONX\u2019s value proposition.\n\nONX\u2019s value proposition\n\nThis seems like a reasonable choice for a Florida-based company, where cheap\nwood construction is already restricted in some jurisdictions, and rising\ninsurance costs are only going to make building with wood more difficult. But\nit's not obvious how well this strategy will scale to other jurisdictions.\n\n####\n\nConclusion\n\nWill ONX Homes be successful? The answer to that question is fundamentally\nalso about Katerra and its failure. Was Katerra a basically correct idea that\njust required some tweaks and evolution? (It\u2019s hard to pivot from mass timber\napartments to precast concrete single-family homes if you\u2019ve already built the\nfactories for the former.) Or was the idea fundamentally flawed, with ONX\nsimply being Act Two of a story about failing to understand the construction\nindustry? While ONX has made many alterations to the Katerra strategy (B2C\ninstead of B2B, incorporating land development, building precast single-family\nhomes instead of wood multifamily apartments), at the end of the day they\u2019re\nboth vertically integrated, factory-built construction companies with a focus\non material sales.\n\nONX\u2019s choice of building systems seems unobjectionable (if somewhat unusual\nfor the US), and its goals seem achievable in at least some markets. The major\nquestions will be if the team can reach competitive production costs (their\ncurrent sales prices don\u2019t tell us much about their actual production costs),\nand if the value proposition is attractive broadly, or limited to a few\ngeographical markets.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the ONX team has learned from the Katerra experience. Much of\nONX seems to be based on redoing what the team felt went well at Katerra\n(precast homes, material sales) and avoiding what didn\u2019t (trying to sell to\ndevelopers). While Katerra scaled incredibly rapidly and tried to solve every\nconstruction problem simultaneously, ONX seems somewhat more focused; its\nproduct offering is narrower, its goals more restrained, and its technology\nmore conservative.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that means they\u2019ll be successful, but the team has bet $200\nmillion so far that they were mostly right the first time.\n\n1\n\nThough it has now been surpassed by Foxconn and others.\n\n2\n\nMarks was replaced by Paal Kibsgaard, the former CEO of oil field services\ncompany Schlumberger. After Katerra went bankrupt, Kibsgaard and much of the\nteam he brought in started their own Katerra-esque construction company,\nSymfoni.\n\n3\n\nFrom what I understand, Kova and ONX are technically separate companies, but\nin practice it seems like the same broader effort: job listings for Kova\npositions indicate that they\u2019re within ONX headquarters and have\nresponsibilities for \u201ccoordinating with other ONX verticals.\u201d\n\n4\n\nIf we look past the rhetoric, the main innovations ONX talks about on the\nbuilding systems side are partnerships with Biomason, which is developing a\nbacteria-based low-carbon cement, and Hempitecture, which is developing hemp-\nbased insulation. Biomason seems interesting, but right now its product is\nonly being used for some roof tiles. A hemp-based insulated wall panel is\ninteresting (it seems like it will require figuring out how to make hemp into\nsolid, foam-like panels), but won\u2019t yield any fundamental changes in\nconstruction costs or how a building goes together.\n\n5\n\nThough one wonders what their actual costs of production are. Katerra became\ninfamous for pricing its buildings below what it cost to produce them.\n\n### Subscribe to Construction Physics\n\nBy Brian Potter \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nEssays about buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology.\n\n47 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n47\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Katerra Team Rides Again: ONX Homes\n\nwww.construction-physics.com\n\n15\n\nShare\n\n15 Comments\n\nDavid R.8 hrs agoIf they're not immediately cost-competitive, they're going to\nhave to do one of two things:1\\. Get the end consumer to buy into (both\nmetaphorically and literally) the benefits they (supposedly) offer on\nlifecycle costs.2\\. Target the luxury market.To realize point 1, they are\ngoing to *have* to find some way of financializing those cost savings into a\nform of NPV that can be offered to consumers up front. Running their own\ninsurer and bundling 30 years of (lower-cost) insurance into the sale price so\nit can be amortized across the mortgage would be extremely risky if their\nassessments of repair costs and resilience don't pan out, but it's the only\nthing I can think of off the top of my head.A similar mechanism could be used\nto bundle \"home warranty\" maintenance plans into the sale price at below their\nmarket cost. There are ways to financialize basically any long-term cost\nadvantage into net present value, after all.Point 2 seems quixotic to me,\npersonally, but that's because I'm a cynic. Fashions change faster in the\nluxury market than down-market and people expect to undertake more frequent\nrenovations for stylistic reasons. I can already envision exactly how much of\na copper-plated b**** a \"bathroom pod will be to renovate.Luckily, the\npresentism the average buyer displays will work in their favor here; if it's\nfashionable enough today, few buyers will think \"what happens when I want to\ngut the bathroom?\" That can be further enhanced if they look to historic,\nhigh-value materials which have basically always been in style, like\ntraditional waterproof plaster finishes for bathrooms or marble flooring in\nthe kitchen.Overall, I doubt they and their investors have sufficient faith in\ntheir long-term lifecycle cost savings to embrace the first strategy, and the\nsecond is psychologically more feasible. But looking at the floorplans they've\nbuilt I'm skeptical that's what they're doing.Precast is, as you noted, a\nlargely mature field; the automation tools embraced in central Europe cost out\nat rough parity against more labor-intensive models used by US precasters,\nthere's no huge learning curve/scale benefit remaining to find and recover,\nscale is seriously limited by geography due to shipping costs and\nchallenges... a cynic might suspect Katerra's team understands this but the\nVC-funded salary is shouting louder than their business sense.Expand full\ncommentLike (6)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies\n\nMd Nadim Ahmed8 hrs agoWouldn't fast built manufactured homes be a better\nbusiness in emerging markets where countries are urbanising at a rapid clip?\nYou can gain greater economies of scale and often build out an entire\nneighbourhood in one shot.
