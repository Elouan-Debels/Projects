But I have also\nobserved at various times that bot herders (or possibly bot feeders) have\nmanaged to feed the data the wrong way around to their charges.\n\nThe biggest surprise here is that there was no overlap in hosts participating\nin the campaign against the Cisco customers and hosts that had participated in\npassword guessing against my (for all practical purposes) honeypot system.\n\nOne possible explanation could be that the attackers here were targeting only\nspecific products, possibly based on previous intelligence gathering. An\nalternative explanation could be that they were specifically avoiding certain\nhosts, such as those running the rather security oriented operating system\nOpenBSD that we use at this site.\n\nThe overlap in user names and passwords mistakenly used as user names with\npreviously collected data here is less surprising.\n\nAfter this very lightweight analysis, I went to the next logical step and\nadded the offending IP addresses to the bruteforcers list and appended a\n@bsdly.net suffix to the user names and passwords, and added them to the\nspamtraps list.\n\nI would like to thank Cisco-Talos for sharing the data on this incident\nfreely.\n\nIf you found this article useful, interesting or even annoying, I would like\nto hear from you.\n\nGood night and good luck.\n\nNOTE: If you follow the references in the various other articles, please keep\nin mind that the command examples there were written from an OpenBSD\nperspective. Details of command syntax may be different from the\nimplementations on other Unixlikes.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
