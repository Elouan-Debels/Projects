Stamp fraud has since fallen 90pc.\n\nRoyal Mail insists genuine stamps will never be marked as counterfeit, unlike\nthose printed in China.\n\nThe Government last month revealed that China was behind a cyber attack on the\nElectoral Commission that compromised the data of 40 million voters, and\nconcern in Whitehall that China was behind social media attacks on the\nPrincess of Wales.\n\nOfficial Royal Mail stamps have been printed by the same family business in\nWolverhampton for the past decade. However, more than 8,000 miles away, one\nfactory in China\u2019s third largest city, Shenzhen, claims it employs 39 members\nof staff and can produce up to one million per week.\n\nAnother company in the port city of Quanzhou, in south east China, is selling\nsheets of 50 first class large barcoded stamps. The listing describes the fake\nstamps as \u201cmint, new and read [sic] for posting\u201d.\n\nThe biggest supplier identified is based in Shanghai. It has numerous listings\nfor different types of barcoded stamps including stamps featuring King Charles\nfirst released last March and older iterations which feature the late Queen.\n\nThe minimum purchase order is 20,000 stamps which are sold at $0.20 (\u00a30.15)\nper stamp. However, for orders above 300,000, each stamp costs just $0.05\n(\u00a30.04) \u2013 representing a 3,275pc markup if it was sold at the Royal Mail\nretail price of \u00a31.35.\n\nThe price of a first class stamp in Britain has doubled since March 2019 when\nit was just 67p. Since then, there have been seven price rises, culminating in\nlast week\u2019s rise to \u00a31.35 for a first class stamp and 85p for a second class\nstamp.\n\nRoyal Mail said it believes sheets of genuine stamps, which can only be bought\nand sold in Britain, are being sent to China where they are then copied\nrepeatedly to produce counterfeits in vast quantities. The forgeries are then\nsent to Britain where they are sold to unsuspecting retailers and consumers.\n\nAlan Mendoza, founder of national security think tank the Henry Jackson\nSociety, said the mass production of forged stamps damaged the British economy\nby \u201crobbing businesses of revenue\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is inconceivable that a large-scale counterfeit operation like\nthis could be occurring without the knowledge and therefore tacit approval of\nthe Chinese Communist Party given its strict control over the Chinese economy.\nAs such, it\u2019s an obvious form of economic warfare and should be called out for\nwhat it is with economic repercussions for China if it does not rein it in.\u201d\n\nSouth Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay accidentally bought counterfeit stamps on\nAmazon last year. The Conservative MP raised in Parliament last May, accusing\nAmazon of \u201cfacilitating the sale of counterfeit postage stamps from China\u201d\nthat were \u201cvirtually perfect except for the barcode\u201d.\n\nHe said he had raised the \u201cserious matter\u201d with the National Crime Agency and\nTrading Standards but \u201creceived woeful responses\u201d.\n\nRoyal Mail says it has taken down more than 300 suspicious listings in the\npast year including on Amazon and eBay.\n\nAmazon says it continues to collaborate with Royal Mail to \u201cimprove proactive\ndetection mechanisms\u201d as well as UK law enforcement to protect customers from\n\u201cthose attempting to abuse our store\u201d.\n\nYet The Telegraph found numerous suspicious listings on Amazon \u2013 all of which\nhad reviews claiming the stamps were fraudulent and left recipients with \u00a35\nfines.\n\nThere are also counterfeit stamp listings on eBay with one detailing in the\nproduct description that it was manufactured in China.\n\nAn eBay spokesman said: \u201cThe sale of counterfeit items is strictly prohibited\non eBay and we proactively block millions of counterfeit items every year.\u201d\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, called for a criminal\ninvestigation and said forging stamps needed to be treated with the same\nseverity as counterfeiting money.\n\nHe said: \u201cCriminal law is very clear about this and I don\u2019t understand why the\npolice are not cracking down. The law is there to be used and these people are\ncounterfeiters and they are as bad as counterfeiting money so treat them in\nthe same way.\u201d\n\nHe urged the Government to take a firmer stand against China, adding: \u201cWe have\nto ensure we deal with this in a way that tells the Chinese \u2018enough is enough\u2019\nand we should be saying to the Chinese embassy, \u2018why aren\u2019t you cracking down\non this?\u2019. Because the more this goes on, the more it undermines the very\nnature of law and order in the UK.\u201d\n\nConservative MP Bob Seely said: \u201cIt is pretty appalling. It is incredibly\nbrazen and it begs the question what are the Chinese authorities doing about\nthis and why aren\u2019t they cracking down, unless this is yet more undeclared\nconflict against the West.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina allows [this criminality] because it damages our society and it damages\nour institutions and this is yet another example of that.\u201d\n\nTom Keatinge, of defence and security think tank The Royal United Services\nInstitute, said while he believed it was more likely a Chinese organised crime\ngroup has \u201cidentified a vulnerability\u201d in our stamps, the \u201cacid test will be\nhow the Chinese state responds to this information being brought to their\nattention\u201d.\n\nChina is also believed to be behind a rise in counterfeit stamps that have\ninfiltrated the United States Postal Service (USPS). Last February, USPS\nwarned the public to be \u201calert\u201d to a rise in counterfeit stamps being sold\nonline. In one case, US border protection seized $2.5m (\u00a31.9m) worth of\ncounterfeit stamps that had come from China.\n\nThe USPS now reserves the right to open and destroy any post that has been\nsent using counterfeit postage.\n\nBut the union that represents postmasters and postmen in the UK has warned\nRoyal Mail not to go down a similar path.\n\nAndy Furey, of the Communication Workers Union, said post workers were facing\na rise in aggression after the fake stamp penalty was increased from \u00a32.50 to\n\u00a35 last October.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis appears to be a scam on quite an unprecedented scale and it\u2019s\nnot good for postal workers who are knocking on people\u2019s doors saying \u2018we are\ngoing to surcharge you because this stamp is counterfeit\u2019.\n\n\u201cRoyal Mail has an obligation not to penalise the customer and to stop it at\nsource and get it sorted rather than pass the burden of the blame to the\ncustomer.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of inertia about this from Royal Mail. I wonder if they are\nin denial about the scale of this [scam] and they are hoping it goes away.\u201d\n\nThe union leader said the prevalence of fake stamps now risked further\nundermining trust in postmasters after some people claimed stamps bought at\nPost Offices had been flagged as counterfeit.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that the Post Office is a go to destination for\ncustomers to buy stamps, books and packs, we don\u2019t like any bad or negative\npublicity around this where people are starting to question the brand [the\nPost Office] or the legitimacy of what they are spending their money on. We\nare deeply perturbed by this and we think Royal Mail has been too slow to\nreact.\u201d\n\nA Royal Mail spokesman said: \u201cWe are working hard to remove counterfeit stamps\nfrom circulation. We regularly monitor online marketplaces to detect\nsuspicious activity, such as sales of heavily discounted stamps and work\nclosely with retailers and law enforcement agencies to identify those who\nproduce counterfeit stamps.\n\n\u201cWe work closely with a number of police forces across the country to\napprehend offenders and search premises. In recent cases we have recovered\nstamps with a retail value of over \u00a3250,000.\u201d\n\nHave you bought a counterfeit stamp from a Post Office?
