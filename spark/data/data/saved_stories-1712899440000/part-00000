Swift\nrecovery and excellent communication throughout. Truly trustworthy!\"\n\nOur methods for recovering our clients' accounts differ significantly\ndepending on the specific case. In instances of password recovery, we guide\nclients through the process of extracting an encrypted private key backup and\ncompiling an extensive list of potential password guesses. Subsequently, we\nsecurely transfer the client's data to password cracking servers, leveraging\nthe collected information to explore billions or trillions of possible\npassword combinations until the correct one is identified.\n\nRecognizing the importance of establishing trust and credibility, we\nacknowledge that addressing concerns about authority is essential for our\nclients to feel at ease when disclosing sensitive financial details. What sets\nus apart is our unique position as the sole crypto asset recovery company with\nfounders featured in various international media outlets, including the BBC\nand Business Insider. Additionally, we operate as a registered LLC,\nmaintaining good standing, and provide a transparent public business address.\n\nNo. We will never ask our clients to divulge more information than they are\ncomfortable sharing with us.\n\nThe duration of recovering lost crypto can range from as little as one hour to\npotentially extending over six months or more. Although this might sound like\na prolonged timeframe, it's important to note that we generally complete our\ninitial search within the first week of onboarding a client. Subsequently, we\nretain the private key backup and password guesses for ongoing retesting,\ncontinuously exploring new recovery vectors and enhancing our hardware\ncapabilities, unless explicitly instructed otherwise to delete client\ninformation.\n\nOur fee structure operates on a service-based model, amounting to 20% of any\nsuccessfully recovered funds. This implies that in the event your account\nyields no recovery, no charges will be incurred.\n\nWe unequivocally affirm our commitment to integrity by assuring clients that\nwe would never engage in any unauthorized appropriation of their funds. As a\nbusiness operating from New Hampshire, our public founders and transparent\nbusiness address provide a clear means of accountability. Any attempt to\ndefraud clients would prompt swift reporting, leading to immediate legal\nrepercussions, including arrest and subsequent imprisonment. Moreover, our\ntrack record since 2021 speaks for itself, with numerous 5-star reviews on\nindependent review platforms attesting to the trust and satisfaction our\nclients place in our services.\n\nIf you've permanently deleted your seed phrase or disposed of a device\ncontaining a private key backup, regrettably, there is limited assistance we\ncan provide. In specific situations, such as with Blockchain.com, we may be\nable to retrieve the backup file, and occasionally, file recovery from an old\nhard drive might be possible. However, if you've lost access to a seed phrase\nwithout any partial or incorrect records, neither we nor any other recovery\ncompany can offer assistance in such cases.\n\nRegrettably, the prospect of recovering funds lost to a crypto scam or\ninvestment fraud is exceedingly slim. However, our commitment lies in\nproviding an alternative through our comprehensive recovery services. Tailored\nfor those who have fallen victim to scams and are determined to explore all\navenues for recovery, our dedicated investigative specialists will construct a\ndetailed case. This case not only outlines the intricate path your funds\nfollowed but also identifies any connections to real-world entities. Our\nexpertise extends to recovering all types of lost funds in the crypto space.\nArmed with this information, we guide you through the recommended recovery\nprocess, involving cooperation with law enforcement and relevant exchanges, to\nmaximize your chances of reclaiming your assets\n\nOur support for various cryptocurrencies continues to grow daily. Currently,\nwe facilitate seed phrase recovery for all types of BIP-39 or ERC-20 tokens,\nincluding legacy mnemonics and extended phrases with 13th and 25th words. In\nterms of password recoveries, our services encompass a broad spectrum of\naccounts, including but not limited to Blockchain.com, Bitcoin Core, Multibit,\nElectrum, MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, Mist Ethereum Wallet, Dogechain Core, and\nDogechain.info.\n\nCertainly. While direct hacking of the Bitcoin Blockchain is mathematically\nimpossible, our strategy revolves around utilizing password guesses provided\nby the Bitcoin owner to \"crack\" their password. This process, coupled with a\nprivate key backup (essentially an encrypted private key), empowers our\nclients to regain control of their funds.\n\n## Request a call back\n\nTaking action now\n\n#### BITRETRIEVAL\n\nAt our company, we recognize the unfortunate reality that once funds are lost\nto a crypto scam, the prospects of recovery are often minimal.
