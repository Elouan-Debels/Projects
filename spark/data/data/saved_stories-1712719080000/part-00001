To capitalize on the\nvast potential, builders and IT leaders need to overcome a range of\nchallenges, including balancing the rapid experimentation and iteration of AI\nmodels, apps, and agents with costs, governance, and performance at scale.\n\nTo help our customers manage these obstacles and accelerate the development of\ngen AI agents, we\u2019re pleased to announce Vertex AI Agent Builder, which brings\ntogether our Vertex AI Search and Conversation products, along with a number\nof enhanced tools for developers.\n\nGoogle Cloud customers already working with these offerings are building\nexciting use cases.\n\nOn the customer experience front, ADT is building an agent to help its over 6\nmillion customers select and set up their home security systems;\nIntercontinental Hotels Group will launch a generative AI-powered travel\nplanning capability that will help guests easily plan their next vacation; and\nNewsCorp is using Vertex AI to help search data across 30,000 global sources\nand 2.5 billion news articles updated daily.\n\nMeanwhile, other Google Cloud customers are building agents to boost internal\nefficiency. For example, researchers at Mayo Clinic are leveraging Vertex AI\nAgent Builder to search over 50 petabytes of clinical data. Vodafone has also\ndeveloped a tool using Vertex AI to rapidly and securely query documents and\nunderstand specific commercial terms and conditions across over 10,000\ncontracts. We\u2019re thrilled to see this momentum and look forward to continued\ncustomer innovation in the months to come.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at Vertex AI Agent Builder\u2019s capabilities.\n\n### Fast and powerful for experts, simple and accessible for novices\n\nVertex AI Agent Builder lets developers easily build and deploy enterprise-\nready gen AI experiences via a range of tools for different developer needs\nand levels of expertise \u2014 from a no-code console for building AI agents using\nnatural language, to open-source frameworks like LlangChain on Vertex AI.\n\nAdditionally, Vertex AI Agent Builder streamlines the process of grounding\ngenerative AI outputs in enterprise data. It offers not only Vertex AI Search\nas an out-of-the-box grounding system, but also RAG (or retrieval augmented\ngeneration) APIs for document layout processing, ranking, retrieval, and\nperforming checks on grounding outputs. Developers can also use vector search\nto build embeddings-based agents and applications, increasing the accuracy and\nusefulness of model responses. Security and enterprise controls are built-in,\nmaking Vertex AI Agent Builder a one-stop solution for quickly creating and\ndeploying production-ready gen AI-powered experiences.\n\n### Building enterprise-grade, factually grounded AI agents \u2014 fast\n\nWhereas gen AI models offer incredible content creation and analysis\ncapabilities, AI apps have to package those capabilities in a secure, useful\ninterface. AI agents need to go even further, combining model capabilities\nwith external systems so the agent can offer deep personalization and execute\nactions on the user\u2019s behalf. Vertex AI Agent Builder helps to streamline\nthese processes.\n\nEasily build production-grade AI agents using natural language The no-code\nagent building console in Vertex AI Agent Builder enables developers to build\nand deploy generative AI agents using Google\u2019s latest Gemini models. To start\nbuilding agents, developers navigate to the Agents section in Vertex AI. Here,\nthey can create new agents in minutes. All they need to do is define the goal\nthey want the agent to achieve, provide step-by-step instructions that the\nagent should follow to achieve that goal, and share a few conversational\nexamples for the agent to follow.\n\nFor complex goals, developers can easily stitch together multiple agents, with\none agent functioning as the main agent and others as subagents. A subagent\ncan pass information to another subagent or the main agent, allowing for\nseamless and sophisticated workflows. These agents can easily call functions,\nconnect to enterprise data to improve response factuality, or connect to\napplications to perform tasks for the user.\n\nThe Vertex AI agents console also features advanced tooling to make agent\nbuilding, orchestration, and maintenance easier, including the ability to\ncreate production-grade, high-quality agents out of a prototype, monitor the\nperformance of agents in real-time, and improve responses for specific queries\nby training them using natural language.\n\nEasily build production grade AI agents using natural language in Vertex AI\u2019s\nno code agents console\n\nGrounded outputs and capable agents Gen AI models are familiar only with the\ninformation that they were trained on. Most enterprise use cases require\nsupplementing the model\u2019s training knowledge with other data sources to ground\noutputs in relevant, factual information. Commonly referred to as Retrieval\nAugmented Generation, or RAG, this technique can be complicated to implement,\nwith few specialized tools available for evaluating and maintaining the\nquality of grounding mechanisms over time.\n\nVertex AI Agent Builder offers comprehensive capabilities to ground model\noutputs in enterprise data, including Vertex AI Search\u2019s out-of-box RAG\nsystem. Only a few clicks are necessary to get up and running, and with pre-\nbuilt components, the platform makes it simple to create, maintain, and manage\nmore complicated implementations. Thanks to a variety of RAG APIs for tasks\nlike document layout, ranking, and retrieval, developers can quickly and\neasily perform checks on grounding outputs. For more complex implementations,\nVertex AI Agent Builder also offers powerful vector search to build custom\nembeddings-based RAG systems. Vector search can scale to billions of vectors,\nfind the nearest neighbors in a few milliseconds, and combine with keyword-\nbased search techniques to ensure the most relevant and accurate responses for\nusers.\n\nCustomers also have the option of grounding model outputs in Google Search,\ncombining the power of Google\u2019s latest foundation models with access to fresh,\nhigh-quality information that can significantly improve completeness and\naccuracy of responses. Google is the only cloud provider to offer customers\nout-of-the-box grounding capabilities on both their own data and Google Search\nresults.\n\nAdditionally, Vertex AI Agent Builder makes it easy to augment grounding\noutputs and take action on your user\u2019s behalf with extensions, function\ncalling, and data connectors.\n\n  * Vertex AI extensions are pre-built reusable modules to connect a foundation model to a specific API or tool. For example, our new code interpreter extension enables models to execute tasks that entail running Python code, such as data analysis, data visualization, and mathematical operations.\n\n  * Vertex AI function calling enables a user to describe a set of functions or APIs and have Gemini models intelligently select, for a given query, the right API or function to call, along with the appropriate API parameters.\n\n  * Vertex AI data connectors help ingest data from enterprise and third-party applications like ServiceNow, Hadoop, and Salesforce, connecting generative applications to commonly-used enterprise systems.\n\nEnterprise-grade security and reliability Moving from a working prototype to a\nproduction-ready app or agent can be fraught with technical challenges. Vertex\nAI Agent Builder eases these concerns with support for a range of compliance\nand security standards, including HIPAA, ISO 27000-series, and SOC-1/2/3, VPC-\nSC and CMEK. It also integrates with Vertex AI Studio, which lets developers\nleverage model tuning capabilities and easily connect with Vertex AI\u2019s other\nout-of-the-box offerings for unified workflows. All capabilities come with\nstandard access controls, data governance tools, and data sovereignty options\nthat Google Cloud customers have come to expect, ensuring builders can focus\non innovating while keeping data safe and services reliable.\n\n### Enter the era of AI agents today\n\nTry Vertex AI Agent Builder\u2019s no-code agent building console to build your AI\nagents using natural language prompts or our open-source offerings like\nLangChain on Vertex AI.\n\nTo learn more about Vertex AI Agent Builder visit our webpage.\n\nPosted in\n\n  * AI & Machine Learning\n  * Application Development\n  * Developers & Practitioners\n  * Google Cloud Next\n\n##### Related articles\n\nInfrastructure Modernization\n\n### Run AI anywhere with Google Distributed Cloud innovations\n\nBy Vithal Shirodkar \u2022 7-minute read\n\nCompute\n\n### What\u2019s new with Google Cloud\u2019s AI Hypercomputer architecture\n\nBy Mark Lohmeyer \u2022 12-minute read\n\nCompute\n\n### Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs\n\nBy Amin Vahdat \u2022 7-minute read\n\nAI & Machine Learning\n\n### Powering Google Cloud with Gemini\n\nBy Brad Calder \u2022 10-minute read\n\n### Footer Links\n\n#### Follow us\n\n  * Google Cloud\n  * Google Cloud Products\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n  * Cookies management controls\n\n  * Help\n\n", "frontpage": false}
