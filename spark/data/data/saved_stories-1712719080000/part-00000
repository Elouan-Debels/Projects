You can write blogs in\nMarkdown syntax and publish them on the internet.\n\n## No Account Creation Needed & Free\n\nYou can create your own blog for free using your Bluesky account. Of course,\nthere is no charge for using the service.\n\n## No Provision of Personal Information Whatsoever\n\nHave you ever been asked to provide your email address when using a service?\nIt's annoying to get unwanted advertisements sent regularly once you register,\nisn't it? With WhiteWind, you don't need to create an account, so you can\ncreate a blog without providing any personal information at all!\n\n## Articles You Create Are Placed on Your Bluesky Server (PDS) and Can Be\nEdited & Deleted Freely\n\nWhiteWind uses the AT Protocol, the same protocol as Bluesky. The body of blog\narticles is stored on your Personal Data Server (PDS) and is not saved on\nWhiteWind servers or the like, and viewers retrieve articles from your PDS.\nTherefore, if you edit the data placed on your own PDS from WhiteWind's web\npage, you can easily delete and edit it! Also, the data remains in the user's\npossession, so even if this service ends, the original data of the articles\nwill not disappear!\n\n*This does not apply if a third party has saved and republished the article using something like Web archiving while the article was published.\n\n## Basic Features\n\n  * Writing blogs in Markdown syntax\n  * Blog management\n\n    * Publication\n    * Editing\n    * Deletion\n  * Comments (planned for future implementation)\n\n## Contact\n\nBluesky: @knksm5.final-techblog.com X / Twitter: @KNKSM5\n\n###### Comments\n\n###### Comment\n\n##### K-NKSM\n\n@knksm5.final-techblog.com\n\nMaking a Markdown blog service using atproto which you can use with Bluesky\naccount!
