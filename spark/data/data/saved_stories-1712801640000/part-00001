The winning bid went to NP 2024 LLC, a group that\nformed just last week, according to its manager Ben Romo, at $285,000. But\nthat was in the waning minutes of a long bankruptcy court hearing, during\nwhich the judge made clear his displeasure that key assets were being held\n\u201chostage\u201d in the deal.\n\nWhen the News-Press abruptly declared Chapter 7 in July 2023, the employees\nwere let go with a \u201cyou\u2019ll see your paycheck when the bankruptcy ends\u201d email\nfrom their editor. Owner Wendy McCaw, however, had made a practice of having\nemployee Phil Kiner use his own credit card and username to maintain the\nwebsite that was on auction April 9. Employee Yolanda Apodaca also created\nlog-on information in a similar way for the website.\n\nBankruptcy estate attorney Michael D\u2019Alba acknowledged it was all somewhat\n\u201cunsavory,\u201d but the judge disagreed: \u201cThat\u2019s not how it comes off to me,\u201d said\nJudge Ronald A. Clifford III, who wore a deep-red bow tie and a flinty manner\nwith his black judicial robe. He said that Kiner and Apodaca wanted to be paid\ntheir wages or reimbursed for expenses by holding the assets of the estate\nhostage and jumping the line in front of their colleagues who were not being\npaid.\n\nBut for the bankruptcy filing, the employees would have been paid back by\ntheir employer; however, Kiner had paid the August website fee before losing\nhis job in July, D\u2019Alba explained. Kiner, who was present in the courtroom,\nhad also made a copy of the website. If he hadn\u2019t, it would have gone into the\ndustbin, D\u2019Alba said.\n\nAttorney Michael D\u2019Alba | Credit: Courtesy\n\nJudge Clifford then questioned the website value and asked why no information\nwas given on how the asset was marketed, calling the bid information \u201cthin.\u201d\nD\u2019Alba explained that the estate had no assets to spend on marketing, but that\n10 publications, two hedge funds, and four people who\u2019d made inquiries had\nbeen sent the offer of sale. As well, D\u2019Alba noted an opinion article in the\nSanta Barbara Independent had \u201cdescribed the sale in some detail and the risk\nof the assets being placed beyond the community.\u201d\n\nThe judge commented that the piece did not cast a favorable light on the sale,\nwhich D\u2019Alba countered by noting that it had produced results. Indeed, after\nthe hearing, Ben Romo \u2014 who owns Romo and Associates consulting firm and has\nhandled a number of high-stakes deals from La Cumbre\u2019s planned 642 rentals to\ndowntown\u2019s Sur la Table\u2019s transformation into 14 studios \u2014 praised Will\nBelfiore, who had written the March 29 editorial with his cousin Zach\nGrimshaw. Romo\u2019s LLC, which he described as \u201clocal kids who care about our\nhistory,\u201d had already been interested in the sale, \u201cbut having them explain it\nthe way they did,\u201d Romo said, pausing, \u201cWe are lucky to have someone step up\nlike that, heart and soul. It definitely got us more interested.\u201d\n\nThe bankruptcy court\u2019s three-hour session on Tuesday saw Judge Clifford\ndispense with about a dozen cases. Amid his day in, day out considerations, he\nsaid, it gave him heartburn to consider compensating Kiner and Apodaca in a\nmanner outside bankruptcy procedures. He said he was not willing to bend when\nother wage earners might not get paid.\n\nAll the creditors could, in fact, be paid in full, D\u2019Alba told the judge. \u201cThe\ndebtor squirreled away her most valuable assets\u201d before the bankruptcy\npetition was filed, he said, referring to the lawsuit he and trustee Jerry\nNamba have filed against McCaw, who transferred ownership of two buildings\nfrom the News-Press to herself in 2014 without compensation.\n\nThe judge consented to hold the auction, with the first bidder, Weyaweya\u2019s Max\nNoremo on the phone, and Romo and Clancy Woods in the courtroom. When Woods\nexpressed concern that the court would not be able to really deliver the\ngoods, Judge Clifford mused that the two employees could be \u201cincentivized in\nserious ways\u201d \u2014 following due process, of course \u2014 that involved taking away\ntheir liberty if they were found in civil contempt, i.e., jailed.\n\nTo deal with the judge\u2019s heartburn, Romo\u2019s attorney, William Beale, said his\nclients offered to pay Kiner and Apodaca\u2019s claims as an act of charity. To\nensure the buyer ended up with the goods, D\u2019Alba said he would verify the log-\non information and web content after buying out Kiner and Apodaca\u2019s claims.\nThe purchase of the website included the Santa Barbara News-Press trademark,\nwhich would be important to the groups looking at the physical archive of back\nissues, photographs, and clippings by topic. Romo, who was once a paper boy\nfor the daily, acknowledged that his group was supportive of the archive\nremaining local, too.\n\n## Related Posts\n\n### Police Evacuate Bank of America in Downtown Santa Barbara Following Bomb\nThreat\n\nBy Jackson Friedman & Ryan P.
