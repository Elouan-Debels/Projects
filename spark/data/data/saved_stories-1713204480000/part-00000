But the hardware mostly does a good job of functioning as a regular\nlaptop while being much more tinkerer-friendly than your typical MacBook, XPS,\nor ThinkPad.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nReview: Framework\u2019s Laptop 16 is unique, laudable, fascinating, and flawed\n\nBut even as it builds new upgrades for its systems, expands sales of\nrefurbished and B-stock hardware as budget options, and promotes the re-use of\nits products via external enclosures, Framework has struggled with the other\nside of computing longevity and sustainability: providing up-to-date software.\n\nDriver bundles remain un-updated for years after their initial release. BIOS\nupdates go through long and confusing beta processes, keeping users from\ngetting feature improvements, bug fixes, and security updates. In its\ncommunity support forums, Framework employees, including founder and CEO Nirav\nPatel, have acknowledged these issues and promised fixes but have remained\ninconsistent and vague about actual timelines.\n\nBut according to Patel, the company is working on fixing these issues, and it\nhas taken some steps to address them. We spoke to him about the causes of and\nthe solutions to these issues, and the company's approach to the software side\nof its efforts to promote repairability and upgradeability.\n\n## Promises made\n\nHere's a case in point: the 12th-generation Intel version of the Framework\nLaptop 13, which prompted me to start monitoring Framework's software and\nfirmware updates in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2022, Patel announced that this model, then the latest version,\nwas getting a nice, free-of-charge spec bump. All four of the laptop\u2019s\nrecessed USB-C ports would now become full-speed Thunderbolt ports. This\nwasn't a dramatic functional change, especially for people who were mostly\nusing those ports for basic Framework expansion modules like USB-A or HDMI,\nbut the upgrade opened the door to high-speed external accessories, and all it\nwould need was a BIOS update.\n\nEnlarge / The recessed USB-C ports in the 12th-gen Intel version of the\nFramework Laptop 13 can be upgraded to fully certified Thunderbolt ports, but\nonly if you're willing to install one in a long series of still-in-testing\nbeta BIOSes.\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nBut the BIOS update never showed up. Nearly a year and a half later,\nFramework\u2019s support page for that 12th-gen Intel laptop still says that there\nis \"no new BIOS available\" for a laptop that began shipping in the summer of\n2022. This factory-installed BIOS, version 3.04, also doesn't include fixes\nfor the LogoFAIL UEFI security vulnerability or any other firmware-based\nsecurity patches that have cropped up in the last year and a half.\n\nAnd it's not just that the updates don't come out; the company has been bad\nabout estimating when they might come out. That 12th-gen Framework BIOS also\ndoesn't support the 61 WHr battery that the company released in early 2023\nalongside the 13th-gen Intel refresh. Framework told me that BIOS update would\nbe out in May of 2023, and it still hasn't been released. A battery-supporting\nupdate for the 11th-gen Intel version was also promised in May 2023; it came\nout this past January.\n\nFramework has been trying, but it keeps running into issues. A beta 3.06 BIOS\nupdate with the promised improvements for the 12th-gen Intel Framework Laptop\nwas posted back in December of 2022, but a final version was never released. A\nnewer 3.08 BIOS beta entered testing in January 2024 but still gave users some\nproblems. There's been no communication in that thread from anyone at\nFramework since early February.\n\nThe result is multiple long forum threads of frustrated users asking for\nupdates, interspersed with not-untrue but unsatisfying responses from\nFramework employees (some version of \"we're a small company\" is one of the\nmost common).\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n16\n\nAndrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with\na focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of\noperating systems like Windows and macOS.
