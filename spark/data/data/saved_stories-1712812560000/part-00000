What is a boilerplate code?\n\nBoilerplate code is the segment that is repeated in numerous areas either with\nalmost no variations or with the same set of code structures. It's a kind of\nskeleton or prototype from which a particular software or applications arise\nthat will be molded into a specific thing. Boilerplate code is a very common\nway to save time and effort for developers during some new project creation,\nas it provides already written code that can be modified or extended to match\nand enlarge the requirements of every project.\n\n### 2\\. How to make a boilerplate?\n\nTo develop a template, make sure you first find frequent structures and\narrangements in your work. The last step is creating a template with all the\ninformation and details that can be efficiently reused while working on other\nprojects.\n\n### 3\\. Are boilerplate codes bad?\n\nBoilerplate code is not inherently bad. However, it can cause certain problems\nduring software development. It acts as both a stepping stone and a template\nfor application development processes due to the existence of the prebuilt\ncode for the most repeated functions of an app. Nevertheless, repetition or\nboilerplate coding brings about several problems like redundancy, complexity,\nand aggravated readability. In addition to that, it is imaginable that\nboilerplate code has low-level features which in consequence can make a code\nperform slowly and decline launch time. In this regard, despite these\nchallenges, boilerplate code still proves to be beneficial in expediting\ndevelopment and facilitating consistency when it is used moderately and\nimprovised for the project\u2019s elements to be customized.\n\n### 4\\. How to create boilerplate npm?\n\nTo build an NPM boilerplate, you can go with tools such as Yeoman or create\nyours from scratch.\n\nThank you for reading our Best Next Js Boilerplates blog.
