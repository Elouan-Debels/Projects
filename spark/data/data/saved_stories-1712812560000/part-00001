(Greg\nJohnson, Cowboy State Daily)\n\nThe Cowboy State hasn\u2019t fully embraced the adoption of electric vehicles (EV)\nand spending millions of taxpayer dollars on a charging station infrastructure\nalong Wyoming highways.\n\nThis reluctance is mirrored by truckers who crisscross Wyoming as one of the\nmajor east-west routes across the United States. Big rigs are now the focus of\na federal initiative to bring the same kind of EV focus to 18-wheelers over\nthe next few years with a goal to achieve zero carbon dioxide emissions by\n2032.\n\nThe response from truckers has been frosty \u2014 at best. Wyoming\u2019s truckers are\ncritical of many aspects of the new federal clean air rules that want to\nreplace their diesel-powered trucks with electric.\n\nThe pushback isn\u2019t because they\u2019re anti-EV, the truckers tell Cowboy State\nDaily. It\u2019s because in some ways, the technology hasn\u2019t yet caught up to be a\nviable, reliable replacement for what they\u2019re driving now.\n\nThey range from criticism of Washington, D.C., bureaucrats who fail to\nunderstand the loss in battery power when hauling heavy loads of cargo in\nfrigid weather conditions, to how the new EV trucking rules could impose added\nexpenses to pools of drivers in an industry already experiencing shortages.\n\n## The Federal Rules\n\nThe hoopla on the changing face of the trucking industry is over the Biden\nadministration\u2019s final rulemaking guidance issued last week through its U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe federal clean air regulator set average pollution limits for truck makers\u2019\nfleets that are expected to push them in the direction of electric and other\nlower-emitting technologies like hybrids.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s final greenhouse gas emissions regulations are designed for cleaning\nup pollutants emitted by so-called \u201cheavy-duty vehicles.\u201d\n\nIn other words, every 18-wheeler that moves across Wyoming along Interstate 80\nor travels along the I-25 corridor from Cheyenne to Sheridan will be required\nto significantly cut down on diesel emissions \u2014 not right away, but beginning\nin three years.\n\nThe regulation will likely boost sales of electric or other zero-emission\nheavy vehicles for trucking companies in Wyoming and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis is very challenging for all truckers \u2014 Wyoming-based or nationwide,\u201d\nsaid Sheila Foertsch, president and CEO of the Wyoming Trucking Association in\nCasper.\n\n\u201cThese are unachievable targets because of the current state of technology as\nwell as lack of infrastructure and power grid restrictions, and will carry\nreal consequences for the supply chain and movement of freight,\u201d she said.\n\n  * The John Bunning Transfer Co. runs a fleet of 80 trucks out of its Rock Springs headquarters but worries that a federal move to make heavy-duty trucks become powered by batteries could drive some small companies out of business. (John Bunning Transfer Co. via Facebook)\n  * The John Bunning Transfer Co. says a federal move to make heavy-duty trucks become battery-powered may exacerbate supply chain problems in America, as the low-emission trucks won\u2019t get as much range, adding more delays to deliveries. (John Bunning Transfer Co. via Facebook)\n  * Wyoming truckers say new federal regulations designed to convert their industry to EVs aren't realistic and could hurt smaller companies. (Greg Johnson, Cowboy State Daily)\n\n## No Support\n\nThe Wyoming trucking industry watchdog said that she isn\u2019t aware of any\nsupport for electrification of trucks in the state, whether that be from those\nwho drive cement trucks, school buses or others that haul coal, molten sulfur\nor soda ash.\n\n\u201cI have not received specific feedback from any Wyoming-based WTA members who\nare moving toward electrifying any part of their fleets,\u201d she said.\n\nRoger King, president and CEO of Cowboy State Trucking Inc. in Kemmerer,\nsummed up his reaction to the federal rules in one word: \u201cAsinine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t work in our climate with the distances we have to go and the\namount of time that the [Department of Transportation] allows\u201d for truckers to\nbe on the road, King said.\n\nThe clean air rule will \u201cdouble the time\u201d needed to make deliveries because EV\ntrucks will take more time to haul merchandise and bulk commodities, he said.\nThen there\u2019s the time required to recharge, which is much longer than fueling\nup at a diesel pump.\n\n\u201cIf you think the supply chain is bad now, if everybody is forced to go EV,\nthen groceries will go up, everything will go up,\u201d King said. \u201cOne size does\nnot fit all. This might work in Texas, in a flat place, but it won\u2019t work in\nour climate with freezing weather.\u201d\n\nKing, who runs a fleet of 39 trucks, also sees problems with truckers hauling\nheavy loads over Wyoming\u2019s roads.\n\nEV trucks could pull 60,000 to 80,000 pounds of gross weight over Wyoming\u2019s\nroads, but will struggle with batteries that could drain faster with heavier\nloads that range from 117,000 pounds to 153,000 once they cross over into\nstates that permit those larger loads.\n\n\u201cEV trucks were made to haul potato chips,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn hauling up to 153,000 pounds in other states, the batteries would last\nmaybe 100 miles,\u201d said King, whose trucking company hauls coal, soda ash,\nmolten sulfur, cement fly ash and bulk chemicals.\n\n## Expensive EVs\n\nKing also is aghast at the pricing for diesel-fueled trucks, which have shot\nup 45% from a 2023 cost estimate of $150,000 in 2023 to $217,000 for the same\nmodel.\n\nWith older trucks grandfathered under the EPA rule, King said he\u2019ll delay\nbuying new turcks and instead repair older models.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try to use our older vehicles first,\u201d he said.\n\nAndy Fletcher, operating officer of John Bunning Transfer Co. Inc. in Rock\nSprings, said that the new EPA rule could force some smaller trucking firms\nout of business.\n\n\u201cThis will make it hard for small, regional carriers to find drivers,\u201d said\nFletcher, who runs a fleet of 80 trucks that deliver dry bulk commodities as\nwell as tubular pipes and drilling rigs to oil and gas industry customers.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak out specifically to the rule, but they always favor a big\nregional company because they\u2019ve got all of the money in the world to put in\nthings like electronic logs and speed limiters,\u201d said Fletcher of gadgetry to\nlog a truck\u2019s transportation route and control truck speeds.\n\n\u201cWith our job market here in Wyoming, we deal with drivers who have been\ndrivers for a long time and are professionals who worked under a previous set\nof rules,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they are faced with new ways of doing things, they\u2019d\nrather retire.\u201d\n\nSome companies may find it easier to hire young drivers.\n\n\u201cBig companies can find drivers easier coming out of colleges who can conform\nto these new regulations,\u201d Fletcher said.\n\nWith EV trucks getting less range, truckers could see their service limited on\na daily basis, especially if EV-powered trucks travel at a slower pace by 2-\nto 12-mph to conserve power.\n\n\u201cThis could add another day or so to the hours needed to get to a\ndestination,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cIf there already are supply chain issues, making\nthose trucks add an extra day on the road will exacerbate the situation.\u201d\n\nWashington, D.C., officials just dosn\u2019t understand the trucking industry, he\nsaid.\n\n\u201cIt all sounds great for fuel efficiency and limiting carbon dioxide,\u201d\nFletcher said of the new EV truck regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s all for safety, but when\nthey roll out these regulations, they don\u2019t truly understand how it affects\nthe trucking company, the driver and the consumer.\u201d\n\nFletcher believes the EPA is trying to implement a rule to lower emissions\nwithout really getting perspective from the truck drivers themselves.\n\n\u201cIt looks good on paper but not in practice,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\ntalk to the guys working this business.\u201d\n\nPat Maio can be reached at pat@cowboystatedaily.com.\n\n## In case you missed it\n\n### Tom Lubnau: Wyomingite Changed Japanese Economy, Saved U.S. Car Industry\n\nTom Lubnau5 min read\n\n### Letter To The Editor: Federal EV Rules Are Ill-Advised And Short-Sighted\n\nCSD Staff4 min read\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEnvelope\n\n## Authors\n\nPM\n\n### Pat Maio\n\n#### Writer\n\nPat Maio is a veteran journalist who covers energy for Cowboy State Daily.\n\nView Profile\n\n## More in Business & Tourism\n\n### Casper Fabricator Makes Supersized Tanks For Wyoming\u2019s Big Industries\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 07, 2024\n\n### Hawk Springs Farmer Works To Scale Up State\u2019s Hemp Industry\n\nRen\u00e9e JeanApril 07, 2024\n\n### Wyoming History: Golden Era For Railroads Brought Status, Luxury And Money\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 07, 2024\n\n### How Saving Pinedale\u2019s Historic Stockman\u2019s Saloon Nearly Killed Its New\nOwner\n\nRen\u00e9e JeanApril 07, 2024\n\n## Most read\n\n  1. ### Public Officials, Law Agencies Flooded With Threats Over Reports Of Wolf Torture\n\nClair McFarlandApril 10, 2024\n\n  2. ### Investigation Could Lead To More Charges For Accused Wyoming Wolf Tormentor\n\nMark HeinzApril 10, 2024\n\n  3. ### Casper Schools, Church Community Rally For Youth In Wake Of Fatal Stabbing\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 10, 2024\n\n  4. ### Casper Devastated By Stabbing Death Of 14-Year-Old At Local Mall\n\nDale KillingbeckApril 09, 2024\n\n  5. ### Wyoming Wolf Abuser Could Get Hunting Privileges Taken Away\n\nMark HeinzApril 09, 2024\n\n  6. ### $30 Million Project Underway To Move 3 Miles Of U.S. Highway 30 To Access Coal\n\nPat MaioApril 09, 2024\n\nSign-up to our newsletter to stay in touch with our latest newsSubscribe to\nour NewsletterArrow right\n\n  * FacebookFacebook\n\n  * TwitterTwitter\n\n  * InstagramInstagram\n\n  * LinkedInLinkedIn\n\nAs your #1 Wyoming News Source our mission is to provide you high quality\nstatewide and local news for Wyoming.
