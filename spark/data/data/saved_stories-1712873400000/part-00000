Not sure about the capitalised first letter - Mac roots, perhaps. In\nthe end, it doesn't really matter except as a matter of tidiness or style.\n\n\u2013 Lawrence\n\nNov 4, 2015 at 10:19\n\n  * 4\n\nIn this case @Lawrence, I don't think the casing of README files has anything\nto do with MS-DOS as there was not that sort of development going on. It was\nUNIX where all this sort of organisation originated and the README files were\nspecifically upper case because it makes them stand out, partly because of all\nthe lower case file names. Naming a file Readme seems lame to me. I'd say\nthat's wrong casing. But it's a convention, so it can't really be \"wrong\".\n\n\u2013 NeilG\n\nJul 25, 2023 at 23:46\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## 3 Answers 3\n\nReset to default\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n59\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nAll-uppercase letters stand out and make the file easily visible which makes\nsense because it is probably the first thing a new user would want to look at.\n(Or, at least, should have looked at...) As others have already said, file\nnames starting with a capital letter will be listed before lower-case names in\nASCIIbetical sorting (LC_COLLATE=C) which helps make the file visible at a\nfirst glance.\n\nThe README file is part of a bunch of files a user of a free software package\nwould normally expect to find. Others are INSTALL (instructions for building\nand installing the software), AUTHORS (list of contributors), COPYING (license\ntext), HACKING (how to get started for contributing, maybe including a TODO\nlist of starting points), NEWS (recent changes) or ChangeLog (mostly redundant\nwith version control systems).\n\nThis is what the GNU Coding Standards have to say about the README file.\n\n> The distribution should contain a file named README with a general overview\n> of the package:\n>\n>   * the name of the package;\n>   * the version number of the package, or refer to where in the package the\n> version can be found;\n>   * a general description of what the package does;\n>   * a reference to the file INSTALL, which should in turn contain an\n> explanation of the installation procedure;\n>   * a brief explanation of any unusual top-level directories or files, or\n> other hints for readers to find their way around the source;\n>   * a reference to the file which contains the copying conditions. The GNU\n> GPL, if used, should be in a file called COPYING. If the GNU LGPL is used,\n> it should be in a file called COPYING.LESSER.\n>\n\nSince it is always good to strive for the least surprise of your users, you\nshould follow this convention unless there are compelling reasons for a\ndeviation. In the UNIX world, file name extensions were traditionally used\nsparingly so the canonical name of the file is README without any suffix. But\nmost users probably would have no troubles understanding that a file named\nREADME.txt has the same meaning. If the file is written in Markdown, a file\nname like README.md might also be reasonable. Avoid using more complicated\nmarkup languages like HTML in the README file, however, because it should be\nconvenient to read on a text-only terminal. You can point users to the manual\nof the software or its on-line documentation, that might be written in a more\nsophisticated format, for details from the README file.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Nov 4, 2015 at 13:31\n\n5gon12eder5gon12eder\n\n7,12622 gold badges2424 silver badges2929 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n27\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nTraditionally the file was called README in uppercase because command-line\nenvironments that use alphabetical ordering would then put the file at the\ntop. This makes them easily visible in big directories.\n\nIt's most likely a holdover from the Unix/Linux world where you would download\nsources and then build your software. Having files like README and INSTALL at\nthe top of your 'list directory contents' view makes it easier to see that\nthey are there, instead of having to browse the entire contents from a\ncommand-line interface. The same basic principle works for github as well (and\nactually works in GUI interfaces too, come to think of it, so it might still\nhold merit)\n\nBy no way a hard rule, but very likely something that everybody is doing as a\nhabit because other projects are doing it. Unless there is some explicit\nreason NOT to, you should probably use all caps just because you'll see it\nbeing used that way in lots of other projects. It's also the default naming\nGithub uses when you create a new repository.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Nov 4, 2015 at 11:02\n\nanswered Nov 4, 2015 at 10:54\n\nJDTJDT\n\n6,3801919 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n  * 1\n\nI've always thought that all-uppercase was a form of emphasis, much like how\nyou have the sections of uppercase in legalese.\n\n\u2013 Lars Viklund\n\nNov 4, 2015 at 11:20\n\n  * 1\n\nOn a command line interface, the files that go to the top of the listing are actually the ones that scroll out of view first, so sometimes these are the least visible files. Unless you always do something like ls -l | less.\n\n\u2013 Marc van Leeuwen\n\nNov 4, 2015 at 15:20\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n9\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nREADME is usually written in upper case. In this way the ls Unix command\nplaced the file near the beginning of the directory listing (upper-case\nletters comes before lower-case letters in ASCII ordering).\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Nov 4, 2015 at 11:22\n\nanswered Nov 4, 2015 at 10:55\n\nmanliomanlio\n\n4,20633 gold badges2525 silver badges3636 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n  * 6\n\nThis was the historic reason, but ls doesn't typically sort that way on modern\nsystems.\n\n\u2013 user82096\n\nNov 4, 2015 at 10:59\n\n  * 2\n\n@dan1111 Right!
