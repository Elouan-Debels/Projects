The project aims to\nrevolutionise dementia diagnosis.\n\nBoth teams will recruit participants from sites spread across the country, to\nensure their findings are applicable to the whole of the UK\u2019s diverse\npopulation.\n\nTimely and accurate diagnosis of the diseases that cause dementia, such as\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, is crucial as it means people can access vital care and\nsupport and take part in medical research. This will be even more imperative\nif new treatments are approved for use in the NHS, as these work best for\npeople in the earliest stage of their disease.\n\nCurrently, people are usually diagnosed using memory tests and brain scans.\nThese are less accurate than \u2018gold standard\u2019 tests like PET scans or lumbar\npunctures, which can confirm what type of dementia they have. However, only 2%\nof people can access these specialist tests.\n\nIn recent years, a number of different blood tests that can diagnose\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and other causes of dementia have shown very promising\nresults in research settings. But they have yet to be tested widely in\nclinical settings in the UK.\n\nLed by Professor Jonathan Schott (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology,\nhonorary consultant neurologist at UCLH, and Chief Medical Officer at\nAlzheimer\u2019s Research UK) and Dr Ashvini Keshavan (UCL Queen Square Institute\nof Neurology), the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Plasma p-tau217 (ADAPT)\nteam will focus on the most promising biomarker for Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\ncalled p-tau217.\n\nThis reflects levels of two hallmark proteins found inside the brain in\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 amyloid and tau. The researchers will carry out a\nclinical trial to see whether measuring p-tau217 in the blood increases the\nrate of diagnosis for Alzheimer\u2019s disease both in people with early dementia,\nbut also in those with mild, progressive problems with memory.\n\nProfessor Schott said: \u201cAn early, accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is\nalready important, allowing people to access appropriate care and medications.\nIf, as we hope, new treatments that can slow down Alzheimer\u2019s disease become\navailable soon, then this will be vital.\n\n\"This would pave the way for fair and equitable access to new and potentially\nlife-changing treatments to all who might benefit.\u201d\n\nThe Real World Dementia Outcomes (READ-OUT) team will be led by Dr Vanessa\nRaymont, Associate Director at Dementias Platform UK and a Senior Clinical\nResearcher at the University of Oxford, alongside other researchers including\nsome from the University of Cambridge.\n\nThey will test multiple existing and novel blood tests, looking at a range of\ntypes of dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia,\nfrontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. The researchers will\nalso look at whether blood tests can help detect these diseases at various\nstages.\n\nDr Raymont said: \u201cSince I first stepped into a memory clinic 30 years ago\nthere has thankfully been a shift in the way society thinks about dementia.\nThere was previously a feeling that this was just another part of ageing, but\nnow we\u2019re seeing that people want to know more about their condition and they\nwant a diagnosis as it helps them access the support they need.\n\n\"Both my parents lived with dementia so I know firsthand the devastation this\ndisease causes, and how a timely and accurate diagnosis can benefit people and\ntheir families.\u201d\n\nThese complementary approaches will maximise the chances of providing the\nevidence needed to prove that blood tests are ready for use in the NHS, and\nwill pave the way for them to be made available within the next 5 years.\n\nWith more than half of all local authority districts in England failing to\nmeet the government\u2019s target dementia diagnosis rate of 66.7%, and with new\ndrugs on the horizon which appear to slow early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, experts\nfrom both charities and the research teams agree that change is needed.\n\nFiona Carragher, Director of Research and Influencing at Alzheimer\u2019s Society,\nsaid: \u201cAt the moment only 2% of people with dementia can access the\nspecialised tests needed for a diagnosis, leading to unnecessary delays, worry\nand uncertainty. Blood tests are part of the answer to this problem \u2013 they\u2019re\nquick, easy to administer and cheaper than current, more complex tests.\n\n\"I\u2019ve spent decades working in research and the NHS and, after years of slow\nprogress, it feels like we\u2019re on the cusp of a new chapter on how we treat\ndementia in this country.\"\n\nAnd Dr Sheona Scales, Director of Research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, added:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the enormous potential that blood tests are showing for improving\nthe diagnostic process for people and their loved ones in other disease areas.\nNow we need to see this same step-change in dementia, which is the greatest\nhealth challenge facing the UK.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that through collaborating with the leading experts in the\ndementia community, we can look to bring cutting-edge blood tests for\ndiagnosing dementia within the NHS. And this will be key to widening access to\ngroundbreaking new treatments that are on the horizon.\u201d\n\n## Links\n\n  * Professor Jonathan Schott\u2019s academic profile\n  * Dr Ashvini Keshavan\u2019s academic profile\n  * UCL Dementia Research Centre\n  * UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology\n  * UK Dementia Research Institute\n  * Dr Vanessa Raymont's academic profile\n  * Dementias Platform UK\n  * University of Oxford\n  * Alzheimer's Research UK\n  * Alzheimer\u2019s Society\n  * National Institute for Health and Research\n  * Gates Ventures\n\n## Image\n\n  * Credit: solarseven (iStock)\n\n## Media contact\n\n## Tom Cramp\n\nE: t.cramp@ucl.ac.uk\n\n### Follow us\n\n## Information for\n\n  * Current students\n  * Staff\n  * Alumni\n  * Business\n  * Donors\n\n## Visit\n\n  * Maps\n  * Library, museums and collections\n  * Bloomsbury Theatre\n  * UCL East\n  * Tours and visits\n\n## Connect with UCL\n\n  * Jobs\n  * Media Relations\n  * Events\n  * UCL and London\n  * UCL Shop\n\n  * University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT Tel: +44 (0) 20 7679 2000\n\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2024 UCL\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Freedom of Information\n  * Accessibility\n  * Privacy and Cookies\n  * Slavery statement\n  * Contact Us\n\nOur website uses cookies Some of these cookies are essential, while others\nhelp us to improve your experience of our website.
