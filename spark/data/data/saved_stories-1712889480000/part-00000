A few millennia later, the cause of asthma attacks \u2014\na sudden closure of the airways that can be fatal \u2014 is far from clear.\n\nA study published on Thursday in the journal Science has just revealed a new\ncause of asthma attacks and suggests a path towards new treatments that could\nnot only alleviate the symptoms, but also prevent the serious damage they can\ncause to the health of the people who suffer from it.\n\nUntil now, it was thought that asthma was a disease of the immune system\nagainst an internal, genetic or external agents, such as pollen or pollution.\nThis immune reaction produced suffocation, inflammation of the respiratory\ntract, mucus, cough and the rest of the symptoms that characterize the\ndisease. Current treatments are based on this idea and are aimed at opening\ninflamed airways with inhalers that dilate the bronchi, but do not attack the\nunderlying cause of the disease.\n\nThe new work, led by researchers in the United Kingdom and the United States,\nexplores the sudden contraction of the airways, especially their branches\nwithin the lungs, the bronchi. The team has analyzed this compression at the\ncellular level in the lungs of mice suffering from asthma and in respiratory\ntissue of patients. The results describe a phenomenon known as extrusion,\nwhich appears to be to blame for all of asthma\u2019s subsequent airway effects.\n\u201cBronchoconstriction results in pathological overcrowding of cells in the\nairway epithelium, squeezing out (extruding) epithelial cells and thus\ndamaging the epithelial layer enough to trigger inflammation,\u201d says the study.\n\nElena Ortiz-Zapater, a researcher at the biochemistry department of the\nUniversity of Valencia in Spain, developed the animal models for the study.\n\u201cWe have seen that after the constriction caused by asthma, the airways become\nvery small very quickly, which affects the epithelial cells that line the\ninside of these airways,\u201d explains the scientist. \u201cWe are talking about a type\nof cells that are not as flexible as muscle cells and that are not prepared\nfor such an attack. As a result of the compression, the epithelial cells run\nout of space and end up dying and disappearing,\u201d she adds.\n\nAfter the attack, the airways remain \u201cexposed\u201d and allow pollutants or\nallergic agents to penetrate the body, which explains why asthmatics are more\nprone to suffer respiratory infections and how the vicious cycle of\ninflammation, obstruction and shortness of breath that characterizes asthma\nattacks.\n\n### Treatment for the causes\n\n\u201cOur discovery is the culmination of more than ten years work,\u201d notes Jody\nRosenblatt, cell biologist at King\u2019s College London (United Kingdom) and lead\nauthor of the work, in a statement provided by the institution. \u201cAs cell\nbiologists who watch processes, we could see that the physical constriction of\nan asthma attack causes widespread destruction of the airway barrier. Without\nthis barrier, asthma sufferers are far more likely to get long-term\ninflammation, wound healing, and infections that cause more attacks. By\nunderstanding this fundamental mechanism, we are now in a better position to\nprevent all these events.\u201d\n\nThe study also tested an experimental treatment that could be the first to\nattack the causes of asthma and not just relieve its symptoms. Researchers\nhave shown how to prevent the widespread destruction of the cellular barrier\nof the airways using gadolinium, a compound used as a contrast in MRIs.\nResearchers have shown that this compound prevents the extrusion of epithelial\ncells after an airway contraction event, which in turn prevents the\ninflammatory response, mucus and other symptoms associated with asthma\nattacks.\n\nCurrent treatments do not prevent cell destruction. \u201cAn inhaler such as\nAlbuterol opens the airways, which is critical to breathing but,\ndishearteningly, we found it does not prevent the damage and the symptoms that\nfollow an attack. Fortunately, we found that we can use an inexpensive\ncompound, gadolinium which is frequently used for MRI imaging, to stop the\nairway damage in mice models as well as the ensuing inflammation and mucus\nsecretion. Preventing this damage could then prevent the build-up of\nmusculature that cause future attacks,\u201d adds the statement.\n\nIt would have to be done, Ortiz-Zapater points out, by looking for a compound\nthat imitates the activity of gadolinium, since this element can be toxic if\nadministered too frequently.\n\nThis finding could stop the inflammatory cycle and even revolutionize current\ntreatments for asthma, say Jeffrey Drazen and Jeffrey Fredberg, environmental\nhealth experts at Harvard University, in a commentary on the study also\npublished in Science. The same mechanism, they point out, could be relevant to\nunderstanding and treating other diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome,\nalso characterized by damage to epithelial cells due to sudden constrictions\nsimilar to those caused by asthma in the airways.\n\n\u201cThe epithelial layer of the airways provides a first line of defense against\nforeign antigens and is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis,\u201d\nexplains Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Soto Campos, director of the Pulmonology and Allergy\nClinical Management Unit at the Hospital de Jerez in southern Spain, in\nstatements to Science Media Center Spain. \u201cIt has previously been proposed\nthat this loss of epithelial integrity that compromises the barrier function\nin asthma would not be secondary, but rather a cause of the pathogenesis of\nthe disease, having important implications for the development of asthma.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be elucidated why this sudden compression of the airways typical\nof asthma occurs. It is likely, Ortiz-Zapater points out, that it is due to\nseveral factors. The mystery of the original cause of the disease that the\nGreeks described continues.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Trial tests Covid vaccine technology against a rare disease that affects\nbabies\n\nDaniel Mediavilla\n\n### Canadian wildfires led to spike in asthma ER visits, especially in the\nNortheast\n\nAP | New York\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Science\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nPro Verbraucher\n\nBestatter packt aus: Anspruch auf Sterbegeld ist vielen unbekanntPro\nVerbraucher|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nRiesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nPV Angebote\n\nHausbesitzer aus Sachsen k\u00f6nnen es kaum glauben!
