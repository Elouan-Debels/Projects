And is that difficult?\n\nAdjustments and flexibility are necessary to live without a smartphone\n\nPeer-Reviewed Publication\n\nAalto University\n\nimage:\n\nSome people avoid smartphones and instead use a dumbphone \u2013 a traditional\nmobile phone or a reduced-feature designer phone.\n\nview more\n\nCredit: Matti Ahlgren/Aalto University\n\nIn a world where more and more services and social interaction are based on\nmobile apps, a smartphone has become close to a necessity. Despite this, some\npeople avoid smartphones and instead use a dumbphone \u2013 a traditional mobile\nphone or a reduced-feature designer phone.\n\nNew research from Aalto University has explored why some people choose not to\nuse smartphones and what the consequences are. The study, which will appear in\nthe April issue of the prestigious Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer\nInteraction, is based on interviews with participants who chose to give up\ntheir smartphone or never had one \u2013 a decision that can make daily life more\nburdensome, limit choices, and sometimes even increase risks.\n\n\u2018Custom dumbphones can be expensive, and some of the European participants had\neven ordered phones from Africa that weren\u2019t available on the domestic\nmarket,\u2019 says Associate Professor Janne Lindqvist, head of the computer\nscience department.\n\nThe participants all came from countries and social surroundings where\nsmartphones were available and the obvious choice. Their reasons for turning\nthem down varied. Some wanted to get away from the distractions a smartphone\nunavoidably causes, while others wanted to avoid online surveillance. For\nparents of under-age children, the main reasons were a desire to keep their\noffspring away from social media and to avoid the temptation of a smartphone\ninterrupting time with their kids.\n\nFor a few, there were religious principles behind the choice.\n\n\u2018For adherents of Haredi Jewish practice, the form factor of the phone played\nan important role because it doesn\u2019t appear too technically precious or novel,\nand the sometimes cumbersome functionality was seen as a way to prevent\nexcessive use. Aside from necessary communication technologies such as voice\ncalls, text, and sometimes GPS, dumbphones usually have little else, which is\nvalued by users as a way to focus on what they feel really matters,\u2019 explains\nAnnabel Rothschild, a doctoral researcher at the Georgia Institute of\nTechnology.\n\nPeople without smartphones have to get inventive\n\nRefusing to use a smartphone caused all sorts of inconveniences in people\u2019s\ndaily lives, starting with the difficulty of finding a durable dumbphone. It\nalso proved difficult to make various purchases, deal with two-factor\nauthentication, and meet employers' expectations of reaching employees outside\nworking hours or locations.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, there were also mobile device-based access\nrights around the world that limited the interviewees\u2019 mobility. In the worst\ncases, the lack of a smartphone also made life unsafe in the middle of the\nnight, with access to quick-call rides limited to mobile apps.\n\n\u2018We found that in many societies, all sorts of tricks had to be invented to\nmake life without a smartphone work,\u2019 says Lindqvist.\n\nSome of the participants chose to use technical workarounds, such as stand-\nalone devices that replaced individual smartphone functions. Many also used a\nfamily member\u2019s or acquaintance\u2019s smartphone when the need arose. Thus, in\npractice, leading a smartphone-free life requires either technical know-how or\nflexible friends and family.\n\nSee peer-reviewed preprint version of the paper here.\n\n#### Journal\n\nProceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news\nreleases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of\nany information through the EurekAlert system.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nSedeer el-Showk Aalto University sedeer.elshowk@aalto.fi\n\nExpert Contact\n\nJanne Lindqvist Aalto University janne.lindqvist@aalto.fi\n\n### More on this News Release\n\n### Why won\u2019t some people use a smartphone?
