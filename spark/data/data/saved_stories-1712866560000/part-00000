You've been successfully added to the Marginal Revolution email\nsubscription list.\n\n# UNOS Kills\n\nby Alex Tabarrok April 11, 2024 at 7:20 am in\n\n  * Economics\n  * Law\n  * Medicine\n\nI\u2019ve long been an advocate of increasing the use of incentives in organ\nprocurement for transplant; either with financial incentives or with rules\nsuch as no-give, no-take which prioritize former potential organ donors on the\norgan recipient list. What I and many reformers failed to realize, however, is\nthat the current monopolized system is so corrupt, poorly run and wasteful\nthat thousands of lives could be saved even without incentive reform. (To be\nclear, these issues are related since an incentivized system would never have\nbecome so monopolized and corrupt in the first place but that is a meta-issue\nfor another day.) Here, for example, is one incredible fact:\n\n> An astounding one out of every four kidneys that\u2019s recovered from a generous\n> American organ donor is thrown in the trash.\n\nHere\u2019s another:\n\n> Organs are literally lost and damaged in transit every single week. The OPTN\n> contractor is 15 times more likely to lose or damage an organ in transit\n> than an airline is a suitcase.\n\nOrgans are not GPS-tracked!\n\n> In an era when consumers can precisely monitor a FedEx package or a DoorDash\n> dinner delivery, there are no requirements to track shipments of organs in\n> real time \u2014 or to assess how many may be damaged or lost in transit.\n>\n> \u201cIf Amazon can figure out when your paper towels and your dog food is going\n> to arrive within 20 to 30 minutes, it certainly should be reasonable that we\n> ought to track lifesaving organs, which are in chronic shortage,\u201d Axelrod\n> said.\n\nHere\u2019s one more astounding statistics:\n\n> Seventeen percent of kidneys are offered to at least one deceased person\n> before they are transplanted....\n\nDid you get that? The tracking system for patients is so dysfunctional that\n17% of kidneys are offered to patients who are already dead\u2013thus creating\ndelays and missed opportunities.\n\nAll of this was especially brought to light by Organize, a non-profit patient\nadvocacy group who under an innovative program embedded with the HHS and\nworking with HHS staff produced hard data.\n\nMany more details are provided in this excellent interview with Greg Segal and\nJennifer Erickson, two of the involved principals, in the IFPs vital Substack\nStatecraft.\n\n  * 14 Comments\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS Feed\n\n  * print\n\n## Comments\n\n### rayward\n\n2024-04-11 10:25:32\n\n28| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nIt also deleted Cowen's blog post about TimeGPT-1 and the comments to it.
