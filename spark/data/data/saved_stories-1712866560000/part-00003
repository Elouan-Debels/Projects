This really bugs me,\n\nThe problems don't stop with drop capitals. Here's a short part of the article\nThe Biden campaign in Michigan has a tremendous ground-game advantage. The W\nfrom Wolverine seems to be about snag on the g of campaign.\n\nAnd here's a little bit of Justin Trudeau is beset by a divided party and an\nangry electorate. The gg in staggering and the T in The draw the eye to their\ncloseness. The overall effect in this excerpt is that some lines seem closer\ntogether than others.\n\nThe new typeface makes the print edition of The Economist hard to read. As the\neye scans across the page it snags on lines that seem on a collision course.\nAnd at the end of a line finding the corresponding next line is harder than\nbefore.\n\nThese problems do not occur when the new typeface is used online. Something\nabout the line spacing in print makes the new typeface hard to read on paper\nand easy on screen. Perhaps print doesn't matter any more to The Economist. In\nthe article about the new typeface they say that \"Most of our readers\nsubscribe to us digitally\".\n\nat\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n#### No comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nOlder Post Home\n\nSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)\n\n## Labels\n\n  * pseudo-randomness\n  * hardware\n  * babbage\n  * anti-spam\n  * gnu make\n  * retro\n  * security\n  * codes and ciphers\n  * the geek atlas\n  * mathematics\n  * minitel\n  * behind the screens\n  * popfile\n  * privacy\n  * radio\n\n## Popular Posts\n\n  * How to write a successful blog post\n\nFirst, a quick clarification of 'successful'.
