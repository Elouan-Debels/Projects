The Zip, meanwhile, safely remains hundreds of meters up. After\ndepositing its payload, the Droid rises back up to the drone on its tether,\nand off they go.\n\nAt first glance, the sensor and thruster-packed Droid seems complicated enough\nto be bordering on impractical, especially when you consider the relative\nsimplicity of other drone delivery solutions, which commonly just drop the\npackage itself on a tether from a hovering drone. I\u2019ve been writing about\nrobots long enough that I\u2019m suspicious of robotic solutions that appear to be\noverengineered, since that\u2019s always a huge temptation with robotics. Like, is\nthis really the best way of solving a problem, or is it just the coolest way?\n\nWe know the folks at Zipline pretty well, though, and they\u2019ve certainly made\ncreative engineering work for them, as we saw when we visited one of their\n\u201cnests\u201d in rural Rwanda. So as Zipline nears the official launch of Platform\n2, we spoke with Zipline cofounder and CTO Keenan Wyrobek, Platform 2 lead\nZoltan Laszlo, and industrial designer Gregoire Vandenbussche to understand\nexactly why they think this is the best way of solving precision urban drone\ndelivery.\n\nFirst, a quick refresher. Here\u2019s what the delivery sequence with the vertical\ntakeoff and landing (VTOL) Zip and the Droid looks like:\n\nThe system has a service radius of about 16 kilometers (10 miles), and it can\nmake deliveries to outdoor spaces of \u201cany meaningful size.\u201d Visual sensors on\nthe Droid find the delivery site and check for obstacles on the way down,\nwhile the thrusters compensate for wind and movement of the parent drone.\nSince the big VTOL Zip remains well out of the way, deliveries are fast, safe,\nand quiet. But it takes two robots to pull off the delivery rather than just\none.\n\nOn the other end is the infrastructure required to load and charge these\ndrones. Zipline\u2019s Platform 1 drones require a dedicated base with relatively\nlarge launch and recovery systems. With Platform 2, the drone drops the Droid\ninto a large chute attached to the side of a building so that the Droid can be\nreloaded, after which it pulls the Droid out again and flies off to make the\ndelivery:\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s the best delivery experience. Not the best drone delivery\nexperience, the best delivery experience,\u201d Zipline\u2019s Wyrobek tells us. That\nmay be true, but the experience also has to be practical and sustainable for\nZipline to be successful, so we asked the Zipline team to explain the\ncompany\u2019s approach to precision urban delivery.\n\n##### Zipline on:\n\n  * Approach to drone delivery\n  * Concept for Droid design\n  * Designing for cuteness\n  * Making pinpoint deliveries\n\nIEEE Spectrum: What problems is Platform 2 solving, and why is it necessary to\nsolve those problems in this specific way?\n\nKeenan Wyrobek: There are literally billions of last-mile deliveries happening\nevery year in [the United States] alone, and our customers have been asking\nfor years for something that can deliver to their homes. With our long-range\nplatform, Platform 1, we can float a package down into your yard on a\nparachute, but that takes some space. And so one half of the big design\nchallenge was how to get our deliveries precise enough, while the other half\nwas to develop a system that will bolt on to existing facilities, which\nPlatform 1 doesn\u2019t do.\n\nZoltan Laszlo: Platform 1 can deliver within an area of about two parking\nspaces. As we started to actually look at the data in urban areas using\npublicly available lidar surveys, we found that two parking spaces serves a\nbit more than half the market. We want to be a universal delivery service.\n\nBut with a delivery area of 1 meter in diameter, which is what we\u2019re actually\nhitting in our delivery demonstrations for Platform 2, that gets us into the\nhigh 90s for the percentage of people that we can deliver to.\n\nWyrobek: When we say \u201curban,\u201d what we\u2019re talking about is three-story sprawl,\nwhich is common in many large cities around the world. And we wanted to make\nsure that our deliveries could be precise enough for places like that.\n\nThere are some existing solutions for precision aerial delivery that have been\noperating at scale with some success, typically by winching packages to the\nground from a VTOL drone. Why develop your own technique rather than just\ngoing with something that has already been shown to work?\n\nLaszlo: Winching down is the natural extension of being able to hover in\nplace, and when we first started, we were like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re just going to\nwinch down. This will be great, super easy.\u201d\n\nSo we went to our test site in Half Moon Bay [on the Northern California\ncoast] and built a quick prototype of a winch system. But as soon as we\nlowered a box down on the winch, the wind started blowing it all over the\nplace. And this was from the height of our lift, which is less than 10 meters\nup. We weren\u2019t even able to stay inside two parking spaces, which told us that\nsomething was broken with our approach.\n\nThe aircraft can sense the wind, so we thought we\u2019d be able to find the right\nangle for the delivery and things like that. But the wind where the aircraft\nis may be different from the wind nearer the ground. We realized that unless\nwe\u2019re delivering to an open field, a package that does not have active wind\ncompensation is going to be very hard to control. We\u2019re targeting high-90th\npercentile in terms of availability due to weather\u2014even if it\u2019s a pretty\nblustery day, we still want to be able to deliver.\n\nWyrobek: This was a wild insight when we really understood that unless it\u2019s a\nperfect day, using a winch actually takes almost as much space as we use for\nPlatform 1 floating a package down on a parachute.\n\nEngineering test footage of Zipline\u2019s Platform 2 docking system at their test\nsite in Half Moon Bay in California.\n\nHow did you arrive at this particular delivery solution for Platform 2?\n\nLaszlo: I don\u2019t remember whose idea it was, but we were playing with a bunch\nof different options. Putting thrusters on the tether wasn\u2019t even the craziest\nidea. We had our Platform 1 aircraft, which was reliable, so we started with\nlooking at ways to just make that aircraft deliver more precisely. There was\nonly so much more we could do with passive parachutes, but what does an\nactive, steerable parachute look like? There are remote-controlled paragliding\ntoys out there that we tested, with mixed results\u2014the challenge is to minimize\nthe smarts in your parachute, because there\u2019s a chance you won\u2019t get it back.\nSo then we started some crazy brainstorming about how to reliably retrieve the\nparachute.\n\nWyrobek: One idea was that the parachute would come with a self-return\nenvelope that you could stick in the mail. Another idea was that the parachute\nwould be steered by a little drone, and when the package got dropped off, the\ndrone would reel the parachute in and then fly back up into the Zip.\n\nLaszlo: But when we realized that the package has to be able to steer itself,\nthat meant the Zip doesn\u2019t need to be active. The Zip doesn\u2019t need to drive\nthe package, it doesn\u2019t even need to see the package, it just needs to be a\npoint up in the sky that\u2019s holding the package. That let us move from having\nthe Zip 50 feet up, to having it 300 feet up, which is important because it\u2019s\na big, heavy drone that we don\u2019t want in our customer\u2019s space. And the final\nstep was adding enough smarts to the thing coming down into your space to\nfigure out where exactly to deliver to, and of course to handle the wind.\n\nOnce you knew what you needed to do, how did you get to the actual design of\nthe droid?\n\nGregoire Vandenbussche: Zipline showed me pretty early on that they were ready\nto try crazy ideas, and from my experience, that\u2019s extremely rare. When the\nidea of having this controllable tether with a package attached to it came up,\none of my first thoughts was that from a user standpoint, nothing like this\nexists. And the difficulty of designing something that doesn\u2019t exist is that\npeople will try to identify it according to what they know. So we had to find\na way to drive that thinking towards something positive.\n\nEarly Droid concept sketches by designer Gregoire Vandenbussche featured legs\nthat would fold up after delivery.Zipline\n\nFirst we thought about putting words onto it, like \u201chello\u201d or something, but\nthe reality is that we\u2019re an international company and we need to be able to\nwork everywhere. But there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s common to everyone, and that\u2019s\nemotions\u2014people are able to recognize certain things as being approachable and\nadorable, so going in that direction felt like the right thing to do. However,\nbeing able to design a robot that gives you that kind of emotion but also\nflies was quite a challenge. We took inspiration from other things that move\nin 3D, like sea mammals\u2014things that people will recognize even without\nthinking about it.\n\nVandenbussche\u2019s sketches show how the design of the Droid was partially\ninspired by dolphins.Zipline\n\nNow that you say it, I can definitely see the sea mammal inspiration in the\ndrone.\n\nVandenbussche: There are two aspects of sea mammals that work really well for\nour purpose. One of them is simplicity of shape; sea mammals don\u2019t have all\nthat many details. Also, they tend to be optimized for performance.\nUltimately, we need that, because we need to be able to fly. And we need to be\nable to convey to people that the drone is under control. So having something\nyou can tell is moving forward or turning or moving away was very helpful.\n\nWyrobek: One other insight that we had is that Platform 2 needs to be small to\nfit into tight delivery spaces, and it needs to feel small when it comes into\nyour personal space, but it also has to be big enough inside to be a useful\ndelivery platform. We tried to leverage the chubby but cute look that baby\nseals have going on.\n\nThe design journey was pretty fun. Gregoire would spend two or three days\ncoming up with a hundred different concept sketches. We\u2019d do a bunch of\nbrainstorming, and then Gregoire would come up with a whole bunch of new\ndirections, and we\u2019d keep exploring. To be clear, no one would describe our\nfunctional prototypes from back then as \u201ccute.\u201d But through all this iteration\neventually we ended up in an awesome place.\n\nAnd how do you find that place? When do you know that your robot is just cute\nenough?\n\nOne iteration of the Droid, Vandenbussche determined, looked too technical and\nintimidating.Zipline\n\nVandenbussche: It\u2019s finding the balance around what\u2019s realistic and\nfunctional. I like to think of industrial design as taking all of the\nconstraints and kind of playing Tetris with them until you get a result that\nideally satisfies everybody. I remember at one point looking at where we were,\nand feeling like we were focusing too much on performance and missing that\nemotional level. So, we went back a little bit to say, where can we bring this\nback from looking like a highly technical machine to something that can give\nyou a feeling of approachability?\n\nLaszlo: We spent a fair bit of time on the controls and behaviors of the droid\nto make sure that it moves in a very approachable and predictable way, so that\nyou know where it\u2019s going ahead of time and it doesn\u2019t behave in unexpected\nways. That\u2019s pretty important for how people perceive it.\n\nWe did a lot of work on how the droid would descend and approach the delivery\nsite. One concept had the droid start to lower down well before the Zip was\nhovering directly overhead. We had simulations and renderings, and it looked\ngreat. We could do the whole delivery in barely over 20 seconds. But even if\nthe package is far away from you, it still looks scary because [the Zip is]\nmoving faster than you would expect, and you can\u2019t tell exactly where it\u2019s\ngoing to deliver. So we deleted all that code, and now it just comes straight\ndown, and people don\u2019t back away from the Droid anymore. They\u2019re just like,\n\u201cOh, okay, cool.\u201d\n\nHow did you design the thrusters to enable these pinpoint deliveries?\n\nEarly tests of the Droid centered around a two-fan version.Zipline\n\nLaszlo: With the thrusters, we knew we wanted to maximize the size of at least\none of the fans, because we were almost always going to have to deal with\nwind. We\u2019re trying to be as quiet as we can, so the key there is to maximize\nthe area of the propeller. Our leading early design was just a box with two\nfans on it:\n\nTwo fans with unobstructed flow meant that it moved great, but the challenge\nof fitting it inside another aircraft was going to be painful. And it looked\nbig, even though it wasn\u2019t actually that big.\n\nVandenbussche: It was also pretty intimidating when you had those two fans\nfacing you and the Droid coming toward you.\n\nA single steerable fan [left] that acted like a rudder was simpler in some\nways, but as the fan got larger, the gyroscopic effects became hard to manage.\nInstead of one steerable fan, how about two steerable fans? [right]\nOmnidirectional motion was possible with this setup, but packaging it inside\nof a Zip didn\u2019t work.Zipline\n\nLaszlo: We then started looking at configurations with a main fan and a second\nsmaller fan, with the bigger fan at the back pushing forward and the smaller\nfan at the front providing thrust for turning. The third fan we added\nrelatively late because we didn\u2019t want to add it at all. But we found that\n[with two fans] the droid would have to spin relatively quickly to align to\nshifting winds, whereas with a third fan we can just push sideways in the\ndirection that we need.\n\nWhat kind of intelligence does the Droid have?\n\nThe current design of Zipline\u2019s Platform 2 Droid is built around a large\nthruster in the rear and two smaller thrusters at the front and back.Zipline\n\nWyrobek: The Droid has its own little autopilot, and there\u2019s a very simple\ncommunications system between the two vehicles. You may think that it\u2019s a\nreally complex coordinated control problem, but it\u2019s not: The Zip just kind of\nhangs out, and the Droid takes care of the delivery. The sensing challenge is\nfor the Droid to find trees and powerlines and things like that, and then find\na good delivery site.\n\nWas there ever a point at which you were concerned that the size and weight\nand complexity would not be worth it?\n\nWyrobek: Our mindset was to fail fast, to try things and do what we needed to\ndo to convince ourselves that it wasn\u2019t a good path. What\u2019s fun about this\nkind of iterative process is oftentimes, you try things and you realize that\nactually, this is better than we thought.\n\nLaszlo: We first thought about the Droid as a little bit of a tax, in that\nit\u2019s costing us extra weight. But if your main drone can stay high enough up\nthat it avoids trees and buildings, then it can just float around up there. If\nit gets pushed around by the wind, it doesn\u2019t matter because the Droid can\ncompensate.\n\nWyrobek: Keeping the Zip at altitude is a big win in many ways. It doesn\u2019t\nhave to spend energy station-keeping, descending, and then ascending again. We\njust do that with the much smaller Droid, which also makes the hovering phase\nmuch shorter. It\u2019s also much more efficient to control the small droid than\nthe large Zip. And having all of the sensors on the Droid very close to the\narea that you\u2019re delivering to makes that problem easier as well. It may look\nlike a more complex system from the outside, but from the inside, it\u2019s\nbasically making all the hardest problems much easier.\n\nOver the past year, Zipline has set up a bunch of partnerships to make\nresidential deliveries to consumers using Droid starting in 2024, including\nprescriptions from Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, medical products from WellSpan\nHealth in Pennsylvania, tasty food from Mendocino Farms in California, and a\nlittle bit of everything from Walmart starting in Dallas. Zipline\u2019s plan is to\nkick things off with Platform 2 later this year.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * In the Air With Zipline\u2019s Medical Delivery Drones \u203a\n  * Zipline Adds Rappelling Droid to Delivery Drones \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Delivery drone - Wikipedia \u203a\n  * Zipline Drone Delivery & Logistics \u203a\n\nziplinedronesdelivery dronesrobotics\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nEvan Ackerman\n\nEvan Ackerman is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.
