The same\ncoordination tools that allow corporations to extend their tendrils to every\ncorner of the Earth allows regulators and labor organizers to coordinate their\nresistance.\n\nThat's a lesson Mercedes is learning. In 2023, Germany's Supply Chain Act went\ninto effect, which bans large corporations with a German presence from using\nchild labor, violating health and safety standards, and (critically)\ninterfering with union organizers:\n\nhttps://www.bafa.de/EN/Supply_Chain_Act/Overview/overview_node.html\n\nAcross the ocean, in the USA, Mercedes has a preference for building its cars\nin the American South, the so-called \"right to work\" states where US labor law\nis routinely flouted and unions are thin on the ground. As The American\nProspect's Harold Meyerson writes, the only non-union Mercedes factories in\nthe world are in the US:\n\nhttps://prospect.org/labor/2024-04-08-american-workers-german-law-uaw-unions/\n\nBut American workers \u2013 especially southern workers \u2013 are on an organizing\ntear, unionizing their workplaces at a rate not seen in generations. Their\nunprecedented success is down to their commitment, solidarity and shrewd\ntactics \u2013 all buoyed by a refreshingly pro-worker NLRB, who have workers'\nbacks in ways also not seen since the Carter administration:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/09/14/prop-22-never-again/#norms-code-laws-\nmarkets\n\nWorkers at Mercedes' factory in Vance, Alabama are trying to join the UAW, and\nMercedes is playing dirty, using the tried-and-true union-busting tactics that\nhave held workplace democracy at bay for decades. The UAW has lodged a\ncomplaint with the NLRB, naturally:\n\nhttps://www.commondreams.org/news/alabama-mercedes-benz\n\nBut the UAW has also filed a complaint with BAFA, the German regulator in\ncharge of the Supply Chain Act, seeking penalties against Mercedes-Benz Group\nAG:\n\nhttps://uaw.org/uaw-files-charges-in-germany-against-mercedes-benz-companys-\nanti-union-campaign-against-u-s-autoworkers-violates-new-german-law-on-global-\nsupply-chain-practices/\n\nThat's a huge deal, because the German Supply Chain Act goes hard. If Mercedes\nis convicted of union-busting in Alabama, its German parent-company faces a\nfine of 2% of its global total revenue, and will no longer be eligible to sell\nproducts to the German government. Chomp.\n\nNow, the German Supply Chain Act is new, and this is the first petition filed\nby a non-German union with BAFA, so it's not a slam dunk. But supermajorities\nof Mercedes workers at the Alabama factory have signed UAW cards, and the\nelection is going to happen in May or June. And the UAW \u2013 under new\nleadership, thanks to a revolution that overthrew the corrupt old guard \u2013 has\nits sights set on all the auto-makers in the American south.\n\nAs Meyerson writes, the south is America's onshore offshore, a regulatory\nhaven where corporations pay minimal or no tax and are free to abuse their\nworkers, pollute, and corrupt local governments with a free hand (no wonder\nAmerican industry is flocking to these states). Meyerson: \"The economic impact\nof unionizing the South, in other words, could almost be placed in the same\ncategory as reshoring work that had gone to China.\"\n\nThe German Supply Chain Act was passed with the help of Germany's powerful\nlabor unions, in an act of solidarity with workers employed by German\ncompanies all over the world. This is that unexpected benefit to globalism:\nthe fact that Mercedes has extrusions into both the American and German\npolitical spheres means that both American and German workers can collaborate\nto bring it to heel.\n\nThe same is true for antitrust regulators. The multinational corporations that\nare in regulators' crosshairs in the US, the EU, the UK, Australia, Japan,\nSouth Korea and beyond use the same playbook in every country. That's doubly\ntrue of Big Tech companies, who literally run the same code \u2013 embodying the\nsame illegal practices \u2013 on servers in every country.\n\nThe UK's Competition and Markets Authority has led the pack on convening\nsummits where antitrust enforcers from all over the world gather to compare\nnotes and collaborate on enforcement strategies:\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cma-data-technology-and-analytics-\nconference-2022-registration-308678625077\n\nAnd the CMA's Digital Markets Unit \u2013 which boasts the largest tech staff of\nany competition regulator in the world \u2013 produces detailed market studies that\nturn out to be roadmaps for other territories' enforces to follow \u2013 like this\nmobile market study:\n\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/63f61bc0d3bf7f62e8c34a02/Mobile_Ecosystems_Final_Report_amended_2.pdf\n\nWhich was extensively referenced in the EU during the planning of the Digital\nMarkets Act, and in the US Congress for similar legislation:\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710\n\nIt also helped enforcers in Japan:\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-\nGoogle-app-store-monopolies\n\nAnd South Korea:\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-considers-505-mln-fine-against-\ngoogle-apple-over-app-market-practices-2023-10-06/\n\nJust as Mercedes workers in Germany and the USA share a common enemy, allowing\nfor coordinated action that takes advantage of vulnerable flanks wherever they\nare found, anti-monopoly enforcers are sharing notes, evidence, and tactics to\nstrike at multinationals that are bigger than most countries \u2013 but not when\nthose countries combine.\n\nThis is an unexpected upside to global monopolies: when we all share a common\nenemy, we've got endless opportunities for coordinated offenses and\ndevastating pincer maneuvers.\n\n# Hey look at this (permalink)\n\n  * The Internet Archive Just Backed Up an Entire Caribbean Island https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-backed-up-aruba-caribbean-island/\n\n  * Google\u2019s Protected Audience Protects Advertisers (and Google) More Than It Protects You https://blog.mozilla.org/en/privacy-security/googles-protected-audience-protects-advertisers/\n\n  * When \u2018ruthless\u2019 Boeing cut costs, the damage spread https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeings-long-fall-and-how-it-might-recover/ (h/t Slashdot)\n\n# This day in history (permalink)\n\n#20yrsago Promising anti-obesity pill\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20040419011611/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2004/tc2004048_9548_tc122.htm\n\n#20yrsago NDP leader Jack Layton endorses P2P\nhttps://memex.craphound.com/2004/04/09/canadas-ndp-leader-endorses-p2p/\n\n#20yrsago EFF on Gmail\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20040420195950/https://blogs.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/001375.php#001375\n\n#15yrsago Cold dead hand of Frank Herbert reaches up from grave, stabs Dune\nSecond Life megafans in the back https://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2009/04/enforcers-\nof-dune.html\n\n#15yrsago French government nukes crazy Internet law in open revolt against\nSarkozy https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/09/france-illegal-\ndownloads-state-surveillance\n\n#10yrsago NSA spies on human rights groups, including those in the USA\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2014/04/08/snowden-council-of-europe-testimony/\n\n#10yrsago Prosecutors wage war on judges who insist on fairness\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/07/judge-says-\nprosecutors-should-follow-the-law-prosecutors-revolt/\n\n#10yrsago LAPD officers sabotage their own voice-recorders: nothing to hide,\nnothing to fear?
