Those are heaps: ages where there\u2019s an\nexcess of recorded people over the null expectation of a uniform distribution\nof terminals digits at intervals of 5, 10,1 even numbers, or in some cultures,\nat numbers that hold a special significance, like 18 in Judaism or 8 in China.\n\nThe extent of age heaping is a good measure of numeracy for the simple reason\nthat it indicates people aren\u2019t good at subtracting their birth year from the\ncurrent year. If it\u2019s gathered from tombstones, marriage records, or reporting\nby different people, it might also indicate a culture of laxness around\nnumbers. As ABC so eloquently put it:\n\n> [Just as the ability to sign one\u2019s signature] can proxy for literacy, so\n> accuracy of age reporting can proxy for numeracy, and for human capital more\n> generally. A society in which individuals know their age only approximately\n> is a society in which life is not governed by the calendar and the clock but\n> by the seasonal cycle; in which birth dates are not recorded by families or\n> authorities; in which few individuals must document their age in connection\n> with privileges (voting, office-holding, marriage, holy orders) or\n> obligations (military service, taxation); in which individuals who do know\n> their birth year struggle to accurately calculate their age from the current\n> year. Approximation in age awareness manifests itself in the phenomenon of\n> \u201cheaping\u201d in self-reported age data. Individuals lacking certain knowledge\n> of their age rarely state this openly, but choose instead a figure they deem\n> plausible. They do not choose randomly, but have a systematic tendency to\n> prefer \u201cattractive\u201d numbers, such as those ending in 5 or 0, even numbers,\n> or\u2014in some societies\u2014numbers with other specific terminal digits.\n\nThis phenomenon is valuable for three main reasons.\n\nFirstly, it is extraordinarily available.\n\n> Such \u201cage heaping\u201d can be assessed in a wide range of sources: census\n> returns, tombstones, necrologies, muster lists, legal records, or tax data,\n> for example. While care must be exercised in ascertaining possible biases,\n> such data are much more widely available than signature rates and other\n> proxies for human capital.\n\nSecondly, its development precedes literacy. Large groups develop basic\nnumerical skills prior to developing basic literate ones, and to some extent,\nnumericity seems to be innate, whereas reading and writing skills are more\nculture-bound and not quite so easy to develop. Consider peasant Uzbeks, the\nEvenk, and the Altai, who were horrendously uneducated, but still had some\nappearance of basic numerical sense despite illiteracy and meager abstract\nreasoning skills. In a particularly revealing case, Alexander Luria recorded\nthat illiterate Uzbeks could not complete syllogisms:\n\n> Illiterate Uzbeks peasants were unable to... solve syllogisms. For instance,\n> given the syllogism \u201cThere are no camels in Germany; the city of B is in\n> Germany; are there camels there?\u201d Luria gave as a typical Uzbeks answer \u201cI\n> don't know, I have never seen German cities. If B is a large city, there\n> should be camels there.\u201d Similarly, Luria asked \u201cIn the far north, where\n> there is snow, all bears are white; Novia Zemlya is in the far north; what\n> color are the bears in Novia Zemlya?\u201d. A typical Uzbek answer was \u201cI've\n> never been to the far north and never seen bears\u201d.\n\nMany non-human animals have been recorded learning numerically, and even fish\nseem to have a basic sense of numericity. Rudimentary numerical skills are\nmuch less likely to be biased due to differences in opportunity than are\nliteracy skills. This is critically important when dealing with historical\ndata, since changes in educational opportunities are often closely associated\nwith or explicitly the topic being investigated.\n\nAnd finally, these measures are validated. If you\u2019ve seen a map of Italian\nstatistics, it probably looked like this:\n\nWell, here\u2019s numeracy as calculated from age heaping (given by the Whipple\nIndex) over thirty years of 19th-century Italian census data.\n\nNot only that, but this measure of numeracy was related to Italian literacy\nrates and heights, and it has improved substantially from the 19th century\ninto the 21st century as universal education has reduced the proportions of\npeople who only sort of know their ages. But age heaping is still a problem in\nthe developing world and, much more amusingly, despite mass education, age\nheaping hasn\u2019t been eliminated in the developed world.2\n\nWe know schooling helps, so how much of the variance in age heaping is\npersonal versus a reflection of the social level of schooling? ABC worked that\nout using the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) collection of\nU.S. Census data from 1850, 1870, and 1900. They computed literacy and\nnumeracy rates for 213 regions, defined as a combination of a birthplace, a\nCensus year, and an ethnic group with at least 100 person observations. They\nthen estimated the marginal effects of personal and regional literacy on the\nprobability of reporting a heaped age across low- (mean heaping = 37.2%) and\nhigh-literacy regions (25.4%). This is what they found:\n\nThere was a notable interaction by regional literacy: personal literacy was\nsignificantly (p = 0.006) more strongly related to a reduced probability of\nproviding a heaped age in regions where literacy rates were low; the effect of\nregional literacy did not vary (p \u2248 0.38). From this illustration, we know\nthat the connection between literacy and numeracy is there and it can vary\nacross regions.\n\nIn an impressive 2022 study, Baten, Benati & Ferber showed that 19th-century\nage heaping and literacy were linked in Italy for both men and women, albeit\nwith a slightly weaker relationship for women. In the same study, they made\nthe connection between age heaping and modern test performance explicit. For\nexample, they took results from the West African Programme for the Analysis of\nEducation Systems (PASEC) and showed that children\u2019s measured numerical\nabilities were correlated with parental age heaping. At the region level\nwithin Burkina Faso, the correlation was 0.78, and in Niger, it was 0.95. For\nall countries in West and West-Central Africa who participated in PASEC, the\ncorrelation went up to 0.80. Within 114 African regions with mathematics test\nand age heaping results, the correlations ranged between 0.40 and 0.71, and\nthese were all results from the 21st century. In Chad, Togo and Sierra Leone,\nthis replicated again with 20th and 21st-century data, even when controls for\nfamily wealth and regional numeracy were included.\n\nBaten & Juif extended the literature on test scores in 2014 by correlating\ninternational differences in age heaping-based numeracy across countries in\n1820 with performance on mathematics and science tests between 1960 and 2000\nand finding that, again, the correlation was very strong. Francis & Kirkegaard\nreplicated this finding even more recently in the latter half of 2022. They\nfound that 19th-century age heaping was a good instrument for modern-day\nnational IQs and it predicted modern economic growth rates. In another study\nfrom 2022, Kirkegaard & Piffer found that performance on Italian standardized\ntests was strongly related to age heaping in 1861, 1871, and 1881; in another\nstudy from the same year, Piffer & Lynn found that those test score\ndifferences were related to regional differences in educational attainment\npolygenic scores.\n\nIn what I believe to be the most bizarre study in this entire line of work,\nBaten & Nalle extended the age heaping literature while also helping to prove\nthe strength of the positive manifold of intelligence. To do this, they used\ndata from interrogations by the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nInquisitors would ask people for their ages and then force them to provide a\ndetailed reconstruction of their life narrative up to that point. Inquisitors,\nbeing intelligent men, were able to use these life course reconstructions to\nfigure out if someone was lying based on slip-ups in their stories. For\nexample, if a man recounted that he was 30 years old, married when he was 20,\nand then worked for 15 years on a farm, the inquisitor would be able to catch\nthis mistake. People with heaped ages were 72% more likely to make a life\ncourse reckoning error, and this enhanced likelihood of error was robust to a\nvariety of controls, including for occupation.\n\nIf you\u2019re historically informed, you might know that many of the defendants in\ncases of inquisitorial interrogation were ethnic Jews. Across Europe, Jews\nwere and have been very successful due, historically, to their unique\noccupational positions. Because Jews today are known to be quite smart, it has\nbeen speculated that this also helps to explain their positions in the past.\nThanks to the Inquisition\u2019s excellent record keeping, we know that Jews were\nsmart during the reign of the Inquisition: the Sephardic Conversos and the\nmore-often Ashkenazi Luso-Conversos both showed high literacy and numeracy\nrelative to Spanish gentiles, but the Luso-Conversos\u2014perhaps due to their\ntrades\u2014had even higher numeracy. In fact, said Sara Nalle:\n\n> So for literacy and numeracy\u2014it is not necessary to pile on more evidence to\n> prove that by whatever measure one picks, the Luso-conversos were\n> exceptional compared to their Converso cousins, the general population of\n> Old Christians, and the Moriscos.\n\nWhen interrogated, it was Jews who best survived a bout with life course\nreckoning, and this performance was markedly better among the Luso-Conversos.\nNot only that, but Jewish reckoning was modern: it included dates and was not\nmerely self-referential like the overwhelming majority of life course\nreckonings. To wit:\n\n> What seems so natural today was completely exceptional in the sixteenth and\n> seventeenth centuries. Only 10% of the 247 Old Christian males used dates\n> when giving their life history. Of those just a few could casually weave a\n> narrative around the dates, rather than going from life event to life event.\n> None of the Old Christian women in the sample\u201439 in all\u2014used a year in their\n> declarations whereas seven of the fifty Luso-conversas incorporated dates in\n> their narrative. So, to answer the question, \u201cWere any of the men and women\n> in this study capable of that leap into a modern sensibility of oneself?\u201d:\n> the answer is yes, a very few, and they were Judeoconverso men. [...]\n>\n> By looking at how persons delivered the required discurso de la vida, some\n> of the Luso-conversos, and to a lesser degree, the Castilian Conversos,\n> proved that they had made the transition from a self-referential\n> understanding of one\u2019s life to one that showed an ability to situate oneself\n> within the wider world of human activity. These findings by themselves do\n> not prove the \u201cmodernity\u201d of the Sephardic Jews and Conversos, but, when\n> their well-established reputation for religious skepticism and other aspects\n> of their collective identity are taken into account, there is no denying\n> that the Judeoconverso minority exhibited in the seventeenth century most of\n> the traits that we would associated with Jewish modernity.\n\nFrom this discussion, we\u2019ve gathered that there are at least two valid, widely\navailable measures of premodern cognitive skills: poor rounding practices in\nage reporting, and the ability to sign your signature.3 They are measures of\nconceptually independent skills and they\u2019re clearly correlated with one\nanother, both in the past and in the present day. They also vary with intra-\nand international differences in literacy and development, and, as reported by\nABC and subsequent papers that spawned from theirs, these measures have done\nso for centuries. These two measures are good\u2014if crude\u2014indices of cognitive\nability\u2014or in other words, they\u2019re measures of what we\u2019ve come to know as\nintelligence.\n\n###\n\nPutting Heaps and Signatures to Use\n\nPeople have wondered for a long time to what extent gaps in cognitive\nperformance between groups are stable and how much they might have changed. We\nknow that the Black-White intelligence gap in the U.S. sits at around 1\nstandard deviation in size today. But has it always been this way? There\u2019s no\nway to know for sure, but ABC gave us one interesting tell: they computed\nliteracy and numeracy rates for Whites and Blacks from Census data gathered in\n1850, 1870, and 1900.\n\nThe quantities they estimated might not produce valid results today because of\nrange restriction, but this wasn\u2019t true in the 19th century. Being totally or\npractically uneducated was much more common back then. Because it was and\nremains more common among Blacks than Whites, these measures will\nunderestimate differences when Whites are near 100% literacy or numeracy, but\nlet\u2019s just see how they look.\n\nOne immediately apparent aspect of these data is that Blacks stagnated or\nworsened in these measures between 1850 and 1870. That\u2019s due to the simple\nfact that the 1850 Blacks were freedmen and the 1870s Blacks were also free,\nbut they included numerous people who were recently freed from slavery and\nwere thus more poorly educated.4 Heaping also tends to happen more at later\nages,5 so slaves ought to have had less of it due to their relatively young\nage structure. Nevertheless, we see a return to trend by the 1900 Census\nconsistent with the fact that, as I\u2019ve noted before, the effects of slavery\nquickly disappeared.\n\nWhile these numbers are fine and dandy as they\u2019re presented, they\u2019re not\nreally the terms people are familiar with when it comes to group comparisons.\n\nIf we assume literacy and numeracy are normally distributed and the group\u2019s\nvariances are equal, we can straightforwardly compute the gaps in standard\ndeviation terms. To obtain a composite cognitive ability gap, we need to know\nhow correlated these two quantities are,6 but those numbers weren\u2019t explicitly\nreported in the paper. However, ABC did leave us some hints. For example, In\nTable 1, there\u2019s a row of OLS regression slopes, showing that the region-level\nR2 for the whole sample was 0.68. We can also see that this R2 was 0.88 for\nWhites in 1850 versus 0.69 for Blacks in the same year. In 1870, these values\nconverged: 0.69 for Whites and 0.72 for Blacks. By 1900, the slope had\nshrunken considerably to a mere 0.36 for Whites, but it increased to 0.82 for\nBlacks. A likely explanation for at least part of this observed instability,\nvariance in the regional differences, and part of the group differences, is\nrange restriction.7\n\nSince ABC didn\u2019t report the correlations we need\u2014which may have been in their\nnow-missing appendix\u2014we can just simulate what the gaps would be at different\nlevels of correlation. We\u2019ll do this with gaps based on the observed ones, but\nwe\u2019ll also do two versions for the variances: one where they\u2019re identical and\none where the White variance is halved since Whites were always pushing\nagainst the limit.\n\nHere\u2019s how that looks:\n\nThe raw mean difference in 1850 was 0.754 SDs, and if we assume a correlation\nof 0.50 between literacy and numeracy, that increases to 0.796 SDs. If the\nWhite variance is constrained by half, that increases to 0.903 SDs. The raw\nmean difference in 1870 was 1.151 SDs, and a 0.50 correlation decreases that\nto 1.105, or 1.224 with constrained White variance. The raw mean difference in\n1900 was 0.911 SDs, and a 0.50 correlation increases that to 0.929 SDs, or\n1.044 with constrained White variance.\n\nIn other words, the 19th-century Black-White intelligence gap was highly\nsimilar to the one that has been regularly observed throughout the 20th and\ninto the 21st century.\n\nBut this has been known for a while. The study this data came from was\npublished in 2009 and Emil Kirkegaard noticed these gaps by 2017 at the\nlatest. Whether this is really consistent with the modern Black-White gap is\nstill dubious: we just don\u2019t know if these tests were representative enough or\nif ABC\u2019s definition of a \u201cregion\u201d caused sampling problems, nor do we actually\nknow if these results replicate beyond these three admittedly well-estimated\ndatapoints.\n\nWell, there are more datapoints out there. Let\u2019s go through them.\n\nFirst, and most relevant to American Black-White differences, Sohn provided\ndata on numeracy gaps for Black and White Americans born in the 1820s, 1830s,\nand 1840s, as well as estimates for soldiers and non-soldiers born in the\n1820s and 1830s, and many more Black and White soldiers assessed in 1880.\nBecause knowing your age is important for soldiers but was less important for\nnon-soldiers, there might be a bias in comparing those two groups. To that\nend, all of the comparisons I\u2019m about to present are within the non-soldier\nand soldier groups.\n\n79.5% of the Black soldiers born in the 1820s were numerate compared with 97%\nof the White soldiers from the same decade. For the soldiers born in the\n1830s, 87.6% of Black soldiers were numerate compared with 99.2% of White\nsoldiers. For the 1820s-born non-soldiers, 89.7% of Whites were numerate\nversus 57.4% of Blacks; for those born in the 1830s, the figures were 91.7%\nversus 59.2%; and for the 1840s, 87.5% and 64%. Sample sizes ranged between\n931 (Black soldiers born in the 1820s) and 16,503 (White non-soldiers born in\nthe 1830s).\n\nThese differences amounted to gaps of 1.057 SDs for soldiers in the 1820s and\n1.254 SDs for the ones born in the 1830s. For the non-soldiers, the 1820s-,\n1830s-, and 1840s-born gaps were 1.078, 1.152, and 0.792 SDs.\n\nIn the 1880s sample, being a soldier changed up everything. By that point, the\n97.95% of White (n = 14,941) and 97.96% of Black (n = 1,225) soldiers were\nnumerate. There was zero gap in age heaping between Black and White soldiers.\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the stunning homogeneity of these groups: did the\nmilitary drill people\u2019s ages and birth dates into their heads or did the\nmilitary become extremely selective? Literacy information wasn\u2019t included, so\nwe can\u2019t supplement our understanding in that way, and we don\u2019t know anything\nelse about how selective the military had become from this study either. Since\nwe\u2019re at an impasse, let\u2019s look at the gaps between the immense (White n =\n6,319,451; Black = 797,504) non-soldier samples. The gap between non-soldiers\nwas 0.739 SDs.\n\nTo my knowledge, Sohn\u2019s paper was the most recent foray into Black-White\ncomparisons since ABC\u2019s. But other group differences have been studied as\nwell.\n\nJuif & Baten compared age heaping practices between native Peruvians and their\nSpanish conquerors. They provided estimates of numeracy elative to non-\nmigrant, rural, male, Peruvian Indios born between 1500 and 1549, ages 33\u201372,\nwho had not been accused of being Jews. People whose records came from the\nInquisition tended to be more numerate, and Jews were also more numerate above\nand beyond that. Women were less numerate, and urbanites were more numerate\nthan people from rural areas. Juif & Baten documented that migrants tended to\nbe more numerate than people who stayed where they were from, and then they\npresented additional national differences: Mulattos and Blacks were lumped\ntogether and they were less numerate; Indios in different places (Peru,\nEcuador) tended to perform similarly to one another; people in Spain were more\nnumerate, as were those in Portugal; Chileans, Bolivians, and Argentineans\nwere migrated to Lima during their lives were also found to be more numerate.\nNumeracy non-monotonically trended up between 1450 and 1700 and with other\ndata, they showed that was also true between 1350 and 1800 for other\ncountries.\n\nThe scale of the White-Indio gaps was not the same as the White-Mulatto/Black\ngap. For example, the difference in 1650s Peru between Whites and Indios was\n0.38 SDs, whereas the difference with Mulattos/Blacks was 1.05 SDs. At the\nsame time, Spanish and Portuguese Whites outperformed the Whites born in Peru\nby 0.45 and 0.36 SDs, perhaps further supporting the place-contingency of\nbasic numeracy and showing a possibly biased international comparison.\n\nAn even more recent publication by P\u00e9rez-Art\u00e9s showed that Peninsulares who\nsettled in Mexico had higher numeracy than those who settled in Peru. What\u2019s\nmore, migration was selective and it became less selective as the centuries\nwent on.\n\nLet\u2019s go from bottom to top.\n\nIn the 16th century, migration to the Americas was extraordinarily selective:\nmigrants were 1.638 SDs more numerate than stayers. By the 17th century, this\ngap had shrunken to 0.764 SDs, and by the 18th, it had fallen further to\n0.438. It\u2019s hard to tell what this gap really means, however, since the reason\nfor the change was not so much a shift in the numeracy of migrants, but\ninstead, in the numeracy of stayers. It seems quite likely that what happened\nwas that non-migrants simply became less numerate for economic development\nreasons. If you compare migrants in the 16th century to those in the 18th, the\ngap is 0.117 SDs in favor of the earlier ones; but if you compare stayers in\ndifferent centuries, the gap favors those in the 18th by 1.083 SDs.\n\nDid migration really become less selective, or did skills in Spain rise? Or,\nalternatively, did the relationship between underlying numeracy and age\nheaping change? There\u2019s indeterminacy, but we still wound up with two angles\nthat suggested migration became less selective, and they should be biased in\ndifferent ways: the gap between migrants and stayers could suggest indicator\nmeaning drift, but the gap between migrants over time should consistently\nindicate human capital. So migration was selective, and quantifying the\nmagnitude of it with respect to human capital and of changes in it over time\nis left as an exercise to the reader.\n\nThe differences between migrating Peninsulares who went to Mexico and Peru\nvaried across the sixteenth century. In 1540, the Mexican migrants were ahead\nby 0.411 SDs, and by 1590, they were ahead by just 0.179 SDs; but in each\ndecade, the ones headed to Mexico were ahead by some amount. This may go some\nway towards explaining why Mexico ended up being so much more productive than\nPeru.\n\nComparing said Mexican Peninsulares to the whole Mexican population, including\nIndios, Mestizos, Pardos, Criollos, etc., the migrant Peninsulares were ahead\nby 1.543 SDs in 1680 and 2.201 SDs in 1720.\n\nThose last results are reminiscent of Calder\u00f3n-Fern\u00e1ndez, Dobado-Gonz\u00e1lez &\nGarc\u00eda-Hiernaux\u2019s results based on Mexican data from the 18th century.\n\nThey observed that in Oaxaca in 1777, Spaniards outperformed Mulattos by 0.445\nSDs, while outperforming Mestizos by a smaller 0.341 SDs, and outperforming\nIndios by 0.571 SDs.\n\nIn Mexico City in 1790, the data was somewhat more detailed and it was\navailable for a few different groups: Blacks, Castizos, Indios, Mestizos, and\nboth Criollos and Peninsulares. Firstly, the Peninsulares outperformed by\nCriollos by a small margin, perhaps consistent with no real change in\nselectivity and some regression to the mean on the part of Criollos: 0.139\nSDs. Combining these types of Spaniards, they outperformed Blacks by 0.399\nSDs. More interestingly, they outperformed pureblooded Indios by 0.298 SDs,\noutperformed half-blooded Indios (Mestizos) by 0.171 SDs, and outperformed\nquarter-blooded Indios (Castizos) by 0.067 SDs (not significant).\n\nAcross an additional 24 Mexican localities circa 1790, we have data on\nSpaniards, Mulattos, Mestizos, and Castizos. The Spaniards outperformed\nMulattos by 0.451 SDs, and outperformed Mestizos by 0.073 SDs, but across all\nthese localities, Castizos actually managed to tie with the Spaniards, with\nonly a 0.022 SD difference between them in the Castizo\u2019s favor (not\nsignificant).8\n\nTo my knowledge, that exhausted the relevant group comparisons.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n###\n\nAdmixture Effects: A Case of Deep Roots?\n\nThe burgeoning \u201cDeep Roots\u201d literature shows that people bring their culture-\nlinked traits with them to the places they go. These culture-linked traits are\nalso transmitted to people\u2019s children, and this is still true when kids are\nadopted from an early age.\n\nIf you\u2019d like an overview of the subject, it\u2019s hard to recommend a better book\nthan Garett Jones\u2019 recently-released book The Culture Transplant.\n\nThere is a related literature on the subject of admixture. To understand\nadmixture, consider a simple scenario: a man has a fully French father and a\nfully Polish mother. They have 50% French admixture and 50% Polish admixture.\nThat person goes on to have kids with a woman who also has a fully French\nfather and a fully Polish mother. Their kids will average 50% French and 50%\nPolish, but there will be deviations, since the parts of their parents\u2019 DNA\nthat they inherit are randomized due to recombination. Over many generations,\nthis French-Polish population may be, say, 35% Polish and 65% French, with a\nstandard deviation of 10%.\n\nNow further suppose that the Polish are 5 centimeters taller than the French.\nFor the sake of example, that\u2019s 1.5 standard deviations! Naturally, we want to\nknow why such a large gap happens.\n\nIs it because the French and the Polish have different environments that allow\nthe Polish to grow taller? That\u2019s hard to know. Luckily, we know there\u2019s a\nlarge sample of 35% Polish, 65% French people who can help us out.\n\nIf they\u2019re all genotyped, we simply compute each individual\u2019s Polish and\nFrench admixture in that sample and we compare them with a supposedly fully\nFrench and a supposedly fully Polish sample. Let\u2019s say that there\u2019s gene flow\nand the French sample was actually just 98.5% French, with a 1.5% Polish part\nand a standard deviation of 2% and the Polish are their inverse.\n\nSince we have everyone\u2019s French and Polish admixture calculated, let\u2019s compare\nit to their heights. If we find that Polish admixture comes with greater\nheights, recall that the French and Polish samples are basically homogeneous.\nAs a result, we might just be regressing between clusters where there\u2019s no\nreal relationship. So for greater inferential clarity, we should focus our\nresults on the admixed and much more variable French-Polish population sample.\nIf we know that they are 35% Polish with a standard deviation of 10% and the\nPolish sample is 98.5% Polish, then for genes to fully account for the\ndifference between the French and Polish, the correlation between heights and\nPolish admixture in the mixed French-Polish group should be 1.5/(0.635/0.100)\n= 0.236. If we find a correlation of 0.20, then our result is consistent with\n85% of the French-Polish difference being down to genetic differences between\nthe French and Poles.\n\nBut further imagine that we live in a world where discrimination on the basis\nof French appearance is rampant and is capable of reducing someone\u2019s stature.\nIf French admixture merely tags French appearances and people receive\nquantitatively lesser discrimination if they have more a more Polish\nappearance, then the estimand might have to do with the effects of\ndiscrimination instead. We can make ourselves a bit more sure by including a\ncovariate like French appearance ratings in our regression as a control. But\nwe can also take a causal step and look within families.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, siblings with admixed parents vary in terms of admixture\ndue to recombination. For causal inference purposes, this is a god-given\nnatural experiment waiting to happen. All we have to do to understand whether\nthe French-Polish difference is genetic without interference from traits that\ncovary with admixture in the general population but not within families due to\nindependent assortment and linkage, is to check if more Polish sibling pairs\nare taller.\n\nSince this analysis requires enormous samples to be well-powered, it cannot be\nattempted without much larger samples than are presently available for many\ntraits. The non-sibling design can still be highly informative, and it at\nleast gives us a prior. If it supports a large percentage of group differences\nbeing attributable to admixture, then proposed non-genetic explanations will\nhave to be based on there being some mediator that strongly covaries with\nadmixture.\n\nThe non-sibling version of this design has been implemented for comparisons\nbetween Pygmies and neighboring non-Pygmy populations.\n\nOne of the recent triumphs of IQ researchers has been to find and replicate\nassociations between admixture and intelligence, allowing them to clearly show\ngenetic contributions to group differences in intelligence. Or, if you wish an\nalternative, it might be simply labeled contributions to group differences in\nintelligence that are strongly associated with genetic differences between\ngroups.\n\nThe Deep Roots literature is connected with these admixture studies because\ngenes are an obvious, powerful, and\u2014importantly\u2014reliable way to transmit\ntraits whose effects we frequently associate with different cultures.\nMoreover, admixture also relates to identification with particular cultural\ngroups.\n\nHere are some recent examples:\n\n  * Bryc et al. (2015) found that the mean person\u2019s self-identification as African American was nearly perfectly predictable from their genetic ancestry using data from 23andMe customers.\n\n  * Fang et al. (2019) showed a stunning concordance between self-identified race/ethnicity (\u201cSIRE\u201d) and genetic ancestry in the Million Veteran Program.\n\n  * Nagar, Conley & Jordan (2020) showed the same stunning concordance in the Health and Retirement Study.\n\n  * Kirkegaard (2021) used multinomial regression to predict social race from genetic ancestry and used Dirichlet regression to show their concordance in the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset. These methods were used to estimate an AUC of 0.89 and an R2 of 0.884. Since several of the groups in the dataset were small, and some of them were ancestrally very mixed (e.g., Hispanics), he also subset to Whites, Blacks, and biracial \u201cBlack-White\u201d people and achieved an AUC of 0.994 and an R2 of 0.951.\n\nThese and other recent analyses have produced results that smack you between\nthe eyes because they should be obvious. And yet, these results are vehemently\ndenied by people who should know better.\n\nIf you\u2019re the visually-learning sort and you\u2019d like to see how these studies\ntend to turn out, just take a look at Nagar, Conley & Jordan\u2019s result:\n\nSince admixture and self-identification are so closely intertwined, if traits\nvary with admixture, that means we can quantitatively investigate whether the\ncultural-linked traits of SIRE groups have a genetic component.\n\nThe design is simple, but it requires a lot of power for both the sibling and\nnon-sibling versions. The latest studies have all had at least a thousand\nparticipants, they\u2019ve all run with the non-sibling design, and they\u2019ve all\nproduced the same result: admixture statistically explains an enormous part of\nthe intelligence differences between SIRE groups in the U.S.\n\nFuerst & Hu is the latest addition to this growing literature and it is also\nthe first work of which I am aware that explicitly ties admixture studies to\nthe Deep Roots literature.\n\nThe way they did this was clever.\n\nFirst, they ran an admixture-intelligence study with the Adolescent Brain\nCognitive Development cohort and they replicated recent results using that\nsample of around 11,000 9-to-10-year old children sampled between September\n1st, 2016 and August 31st, 2018. They observed all the typical findings: a\n1.10 Hedge\u2019s g gap in intelligence between Blacks and Whites; Whites were 98%\nEuropean and Blacks were 72% African; and admixture mediated 75.68% of the\ndifference in intelligence between Blacks and Whites, as indicated by the 0.18\ncorrelation within the Black group.9\n\nThe critical part of this analysis was that they created expectations: they\ndocumented how admixture was associated with measured intelligence in\ncontemporary SIRE groups, who have obvious continuity with similarly-labeled\ngroups in the past.\n\nSecond, they performed individual-level Census-based age heaping analyses and\nused mixed-race classifications to see if the time\u2019s crudely-assessed\nadmixture and crudely-assessed numeracy were related as one might expect given\nthe modern data. This analysis relied on data from Censuses from 1850 to 1930.\n\nIf the two analyses are concordant, it suggests that the admixture-related\ngaps observed today are quite old and that they\u2019re derived from common factors\nover an incredibly long time. If true, hypothetical explanations may need to\nbe enormously constrained.\n\nFinally, they did all of this beyond Black and White. Fuerst & Hu used Black\nand Mulatto slave samples in addition to samples of free Whites, Mulattos, and\nBlacks, they used Amerindian schedule samples and a sample of 5% of the\ncountry\u2019s Amerindians, and they topped it all off by using samples of 12% of\nPuerto Ricans. These samples were very large, and they were able to go back\nand add cognitive ability assessments that the original enumerators never\nintended. If this wasn\u2019t clever, it was at least a lot of work.\n\n###\n\nAdmixture and Intelligence in the 21st Century\n\nIn the ABCD, the cognitive comparisons were unbiased. That means whatever the\nintelligence test they used measured was the same in different groups and it\npossesses the same causes. Because they used a valid intelligence test, they\nfound evidence for racial differences in intelligence. But how large were\nthose differences?\n\nThe White group was 98% European (\u03c3 = 0.05) with the remainder largely being\nAfrican and East Asian. Amerindian contributions to White admixture were\nnegligible. The Black group on the other hand, was 24% European (0.16), 3%\nEast Asian (0.04), and 72% African (0.16), with a small Amerindian residual\n(<0.01, \u03c3 = 0.02). The Amerindian group was typical, which may sound unusual.\nIt was 80% European (0.26), with 8% derivation from Africa (0.20), 3% from\nEast Asia (0.08), and 9% from American Indians (0.15). The Puerto Rican group\nwas 67% European (0.20), 8% Amerindian (0.07), 24% African (0.20), and 2% East\nAsian (0.03).\n\nThe study authors also computed information about the group\u2019s skin tones. The\nWhite group had a mean Fitzpatrick score of 18.22 (\u03c3 = 4.96), meaning that\nthey\u2019re slightly tan but they\u2019ll still burn. The Black group had a mean\nFitzpatrick score of 33.31 (4.38), meaning that they were a dark brown and it\nwould be really difficult to burn them. The Amerindian group had a mean\nFitzpatrick score of 22.23 (7.20), so they\u2019ll burn minimally and tan well. The\nPuerto Rican group had a mean Fitzpatrick score of 27.68 (6.64), so they\u2019ll\nalso minimally burn and readily tan.\n\nThis skin color information is important to know because\n\u201ccolorism\u201d\u2014discrimination on the basis of color\u2014is the dominant proposed\nalternative for non-sibling admixture studies, because admixture and color are\nexpected to covary. As a quick test of this, consider this table:\n\nThe higher the Fitzpatrick Type letter, the darker the person. In the two SIRE\ngroups with sufficient variation in skin tone, darker people had less European\nadmixture. Among Blacks, darker individuals also tended to be less\nintelligent. But among Puerto Ricans, that wasn\u2019t true, although we shouldn\u2019t\nthink much of this since the result for the VI color category is likely\nunreliable due to its small sample size (n = 25).\n\nIn the White sample, there were minuscule relationships between ancestry or\nskin color and intelligence, ranging between \u03c1 = -0.05 and 0.05, because the\nWhite group didn\u2019t vary much in terms of admixture: they were pushing up on\nthe border of being completely European. In the Black, Amerindian, and Puerto\nRican groups\u2014who are instead, characterized by a great deal of admixture\u2014this\nwasn\u2019t true and their results are more interesting.\n\nIn the Black sample, intelligence was correlated at 0.18 with European\nadmixture and -0.20 with African admixture, in addition to negligible\ncorrelations of 0.06 with East Asian and -0.01 with Amerindian ancestry\nbecause those admixture types were limited in the Black sample. Fitzpatrick\nscore correlated much more poorly with intelligence than European admixture\ndid, at -0.09.\n\nIn the Amerindian sample, intelligence was correlated at 0.47 with European\nadmixture and -0.18 with Amerindian admixture, along with correlations of\n-0.45 and -0.04 with African and East Asian admixture and a quite large -0.41\ncorrelation with Fitzpatrick score.\n\nIn the Puerto Rican sample, intelligence was correlated at 0.21 with European\nadmixture, -0.13 with Amerindian admixture, -0.17 with African admixture, and\n0.02 with East Asian admixture. The correlation with Fitzpatrick score was\n0.07, so darker Puerto Ricans were actually more intelligent in this sample.\nThis should not be expected to replicate very well.\n\nNow we have all of the information required to produce our expectations if\n100% of the differences between these groups and Europeans are down to genes.\nHere\u2019s a table that shows expectations with 100% genetic gaps versus what they\nobserved in the study:\n\nThe results based on the correlations suggest that admixture explains the\nBlack-White gap, but it\u2019s worse at explaining the Amerindian-White or Puerto\nRican-White gaps. One reason is variability: the Black group had more non-\nEuropean range, and this was estimated better because they also had a much\nlarger sample size. The second and more important reason is that the\nAmerindian and Puerto Rican groups have more complex admixture.\n\nAfrican American admixture is basically 1-African admixture, and the residual\nis overwhelmingly European and part of the assigned non-European admixture\nshould probably not be considered Amerindian or East Asian but a fifth\ncategory: error. For the Amerindian groups, admixture is more complex. Their\nadmixture didn\u2019t arise from what was effectively a single event involving one\nother continental population. They\u2019ve had long histories of mixing between\nmultiple initially isolated populations, resulting in considerable percentages\nfrom different groups, and said admixture percentages don\u2019t all have the same\neffects because different ancestral populations are varied.\n\nSo how much was actually mediated? Another non-sibling means of figuring this\nout is to enter the different ancestries into a regression simultaneously.\n\nThe first result worth noting was that for Blacks, Amerindians, and Puerto\nRicans, skin color wasn\u2019t a very powerful predictor. It wasn\u2019t at all\nsignificant among Blacks or Amerindians, and it only had an unstandardized\nbeta of 0.23 (p = 0.02) among the Puerto Rican sample. This compares with 0.03\nand -0.01 in the Black sample. Since the significant Puerto Rican estimate was\npositive, it wasn\u2019t consistent with standard Colorism theory anyway, since it\nmeant darker Puerto Ricans performed better.10\n\nThe second noteworthy result was that African ancestry was a directionally\nconsistent and significant predictor of poorer performance, and Amerindian\nancestry was too, albeit not significantly in the Black or Amerindian groups.\n\nThe third noteworthy result was that after incorporating all of these\ndifferent different ancestries, the Black-White difference was considerably\nshrunken, but it remained marginally significant (p = 0.02). The Amerindian-\nWhite and Puerto Rican-White differences, on the other hand, were no longer\nsignificant or considerable in size (p\u2019s = 0.13 and 0.32).\n\nTo summarize these modern-day results, substantial parts of the intelligence\ndifferences between American Whites and several contemporary American\npopulation groups can be attributed to genetic differences. The way this\neffect manifests is in the form of greater intelligence among members of those\npopulations who derive more of their ancestry from Europeans.\n\n###\n\nAdmixture and Numeracy in the 19th and 20th Centuries\n\n####\n\nSection I: Blacks, Whites, and Mulattos\n\nThe best way to start this off is with an estimate that speaks to how\nenvironmentally contingent these results could be: a comparison of slaves. The\ngroups being compared here are slaves deemed Black\u2014which is to say, fully\nAfrican\u2014versus slaves deemed Mulatto\u2014or half-White, half-Black. The samples\nthese came from were representative samples of 5% of the slaves enumerated in\nthe years 1850 and 1860. These samples were quite large and contained 1,515\nMulatto and 23,613 Black slaves in 1850 and 2,835 Mulatto and 30,829 Black\nslaves in 1860.\n\nNow we\u2019ll need a comparison group. Let\u2019s use the Mulatto and Black groups in\nfree samples from slave and non-slave states, who were literate and\nilliterate, respectively.\n\nFrom the data, there was a 0.183 SD gap favoring Mulatto over Black slaves in\n1850 and a 0.177 SD gap favoring them in 1860. This figure was again confirmed\nin the 1860 complete Census data, where a 0.169 SD difference between Mulatto\nand Black slaves was recorded with 7,660 Mulatto and 89,702 Black slaves.\n\nThe gap between literate Mulattos and literate Blacks in 1850 in slave states\nwas 0.188 SDs, and by 1860, it had grown to 0.292 SDs. In the free states, the\n1850 and 1860 literate Mulatto-Black gaps were 0.384 and 0.245 SDs. Perhaps\nsorting was involved in these changes, as the illiterate Mulatto-Black gaps in\n1850 and 1860 in the slave states were 0.322 and 0.385, whereas in the free\nstates, they were 0.294 and 0.342 SDs.\n\nThe table also shows that literate Mulattos in slave states performed more\npoorly than literate Blacks in free states. This isn\u2019t quite unexpected.\nComparing literate Mulattos in slave states to literate Blacks in free states\nin 1850 and 1860, the gaps were 0.123 SD and 0.142 SDs in favor of the Blacks.\nComparing literate Whites in slave states to literate Whites in free states in\n1850 and 1860, the gaps were 0.154 and 0.104 SDs. Add them up (0.265 SD gap vs\n0.258) and they\u2019re incredibly similar in size. Of course, this undersells the\nstate effect: slave state Mulattos were beaten by 0.507 SDs by free state ones\nin 1850, and by 0.386 SDs in 1860; slave state Blacks were beaten by 0.310 SDs\nby free state ones in 1850, and by 0.433 SDs in 1860.\n\nThe state effects are impacted by selection, both on skills and ancestry. A\ncrude corrective can be made based on the incorrect, but perhaps not strongly\nso, assumption that the White-White differences between slave and free states\nare due to the impacts of the states alone. So the corrected literate Mulatto-\nMulatto and Black-Black gaps would be 0.353 (1850) and 0.282 (1860) SDs for\nMulattos and 0.156 and 0.329 SDs for Blacks. The corrected Mulatto-Black gaps\nbetween these state pairs were 0.030 SDs in favor of Mulattos in 1850 and\n0.038 SDs in favor of Blacks in 1860. In other words, the ancestry effect was\nenough to account for the state effects.\n\nWas this so for the less-fortunate illiterate groups? Comparing illiterate\nMulattos in slave and free states, the gap was 0.319 SDs in 1850 and 0.399 SDs\nin 1860. Comparing illiterate Blacks in those states, the gaps were 0.256 and\n0.351 SDs. Comparing illiterate Mulattos in slave states to illiterate Blacks\nin free states, the illiterate Mulattos actually outperformed them by 0.066\nSDs in 1850 and they fell behind by 0.057 SDs in 1860. Applying the\ncorrectives based on the White population from before, the illiterate slave-\nfree Mulatto gaps dropped to 0.165 and 0.295 SDs, while the illiterate slave-\nfree Black gaps dropped to 0.102 and 0.247 SDs, and the illiterate slave-free\nMulatto-Black gaps increased to 0.22 SDs in favor of the Mulattos in slave\nstates in 1850 and the 1860 estimate also changed directions to 0.047 SDs in\nfavor of the Mulattos in slave states. The ancestry effect among the\nilliterate populations overpowered the state effects.\n\nWe still can\u2019t be sure why these results were as they were since selection was\nat play in all of these statistics, and, for example, there may still be\nsomething akin to favoritism towards Mulattos over Blacks to different degrees\nin slave versus free states. However, we do have large-scale sibling\ncomparisons from the time that tell us that appearance-based discrimination\nagainst Mulattos versus Blacks is not concerning, even if there appears to be\na (genetically-confounded) relationship outside of the co-sibling control\nresults. But regardless, to be more explicit, we need to increasingly\nincorporate Whites into these comparisons.\n\nFirstly, the Mulatto-Black gaps for all freedmen in slave states, and all\nMulattos and Blacks in free states in 1850 were 0.264 SDs, and 0.393 SDs in\nfavor of Mulattos; in 1860, the gaps were 0.298 SDs and 0.274 SDs in favor of\nMulattos. The Mulatto-Black gaps among slaves (0.183 and 0.177 SDs) were thus\n69.32%, 59.40%, 46.56%, and 64.60% as large as these gaps, in those years. If\nwe use the figures from the illiterate groups, the Mulatto-Black gaps were\n56.83%, 45.97%, 62.24%, and 51.75% as large. Using the literate groups\u2014which\nare arguably more comparable to the equality the Mulatto and Black groups in\nenslavement felt, compared to the comparably mixed illiterate group\u201497.34%,\n60.62%, 47.66%, and 72.24% as large. Roughly half to two-thirds of the gap was\npreserved in slavery. We have suggestive evidence that the na\u00efve correction\nfor the White-White differences between free and slave states is incorrect,\nsince correcting the total free state Black-Mulatto gaps for it suggests the\ngaps for slaves were 94.33% and 131.11% as large. For literate groups only,\nthose numbers would be 79.57% and 125.53%, whereas for illiterate groups only,\nthey would be 130.71% and 74.37%. Of course, these are possible, but doubtful.\n\nNext, if we estimate Black and Mulatto performance relative to Whites, we can\nobtain a crude estimate of the extent to which genetics play a role. All we\nhave to assume is that in terms of admixture, Mulattos are exactly in-between\nBlacks and Whites. This is an incorrect assumption that will be affected by\nrange restriction if there are very European Mulattos, of which we know there\nare several, and of course it is also dependent on sampling error. If we had\ngenetic data, we could tune up the estimate by using the exact admixture\nlevels of the samples. But since we do not, we\u2019ll have to proceed armed with\nour assumption. To use it, we simply take the performance midpoint for Blacks\nand Whites and compare it to how Mulattos perform.\n\nUsing samples including literate and illiterate persons, in the slave states,\nMulattos performed 0.687 SDs worse than Whites, and Blacks performed 0.943 SDs\nworse than them in 1850. The Black-White midpoint is 0.472 SDs. Mulattos\nperformed a bit worse than expected, so the estimated genetic contribution is\n54.29%. In the same year, the gap in free states was 0.422 SDs and 0.815 SDs,\nfor a midpoint of 0.408 SDs and a possible genetic contribution of 96.44%!\nWell now we need to check the results from 1860. In the slave states, Mulattos\nperformed 0.732 SDs worse than Whites, and Blacks performed 1.03 SDs worse. In\nthe free states, Mulattos performed 0.473 SDs worse versus 0.747 SDs for\nBlacks. These state pairs had midpoints of 0.515 and 0.374, so genetics could\nexplain 57.86% in slave states and 73.36% in free ones.\n\nTo index whether this was due to opportunity, we merely need to repeat the\nexercise with the purely literate and the illiterate samples.\n\nFor the literate, that meant 1850 slave state Black-White and Mulatto-White\ngaps of 0.906 and 0.718 SDs versus 0.749 and 0.365 SDs in free states,\nalongside 1860 Black-White and Mulatto-White gaps of 1.04 and 0.748 SDs in\nslave states, and 0.711 and 0.466 SDs in free ones. The scale of the\ndifferences between the literate and mixed literacy samples perhaps speaks to\nthe true effect of literacy given its consistency. It also suggests that\nwhatever effect it had was relatively comparable between races. So, in these\ntimes and places, our midpoints were 0.453, 0.375, 0.520, and 0.356 SDs,\nmeaning that genetics could explain 41.50%, 97.46%, 56.15%, and 68.92% of the\ndifferences.\n\nFor the illiterate, that meant 1850 slave state Mulatto-White and Black-White\ngaps of 0.763 and 0.441 SDs versus 0.796 and 0.412 SDs in free states,\nalongside 1860 Black-White and Mulatto-White gaps of 0.825 and 0.531 SDs in\nslave states, and 0.691 and 0.349 SDs in free ones. In these times and places,\nour midpoints were 0.382, 0.375, 0.413, and 0.346 SDs, meaning that genetics\ncould explain 84.40%, 96.48%, 71.27%, and 98.99% of the differences.\n\nGenetics were consistently less capable of explaining the differences between\nbetween Blacks and Whites in slave states as compared to free ones, and in the\ncondition of illiteracy for both Blacks and Whites, genetics seemed to matter\nmore in both places, with regional equality in illiterate- and literate-group\nexplanations in free states in the 1850s.\n\nNow we really want to know why. So, why? Well, let\u2019s inform ourselves by using\ndata from 1870 to 1920. First step: check the consistency of the gaps. We know\nthere was selective migration; we don\u2019t know how that affected regional or\ntemporal differences. Since literacy didn\u2019t make a huge difference, we\u2019ll also\njust use the literate samples.\n\nAnd armed with our \u201cMulattos have the Black-White midpoint in terms of\nadmixture\u201d assumption, we can make another plot from this data:\n\nThese results are certainly something. They are directionally consistent with\nmodern-day results, and they appear to be quite robust. There are\ndirectionally consistent differences among populations in slavery and out of\nslavery among the illiterate, among the literate, and across state lines and\ntime. This is a single indicator of cognitive skills and it\u2019s certainly not\ninvariant\u2014and due to the Black advantage in memory, it should favor that group\nsomewhat\u2014but it still manages to produce results that are consistent with\nthose from the modern day. If we add in the literacy gaps, differences are\nprobably biased up a bit (especially immediately after the Civil War), and we\nlose the ability to use literacy as an index of opportunity. Doing that\ndoesn\u2019t change the aggregate results all that much. That\u2019s really something.\n\n####\n\nSection II: Whites and Amerindians\n\nFor this comparison, we\u2019ll start with the data from two Amerindian schedule\nsamples conducted in 1900 and 1910. These included literacy as a\nclassification, and allowed the computation of numeracy for Amerindians who\ntribal elders reported as 0%, >0-25%, >25-50%, and >50% European, and White in\n1910. Those individuals who were identified as fully-White were still listed\nas racially Amerindian.\n\nAmong the literate, this is how those two samples looked:\n\nThe results were consistent with illiterate samples, but there were simply too\nfew people in the fully-White (n1900 = 0; n1910 = 29) and >50% European (n1900\n= 54,; n1910 = 117) groups for those results to be worthwhile to present.\nHowever, there were thousands of completely Amerindian illiterates in 1900\n(4,772) and 1910 (3,893), 167 >0% to 25% in 1900 and 185 in 1910, alongside\n357 >25% to 50% in 1900 and 324 in 1910. If we use just those groups with\ndecent sample sizes, the total 0% versus >25% to 50% gap in 1900 was 0.927 SDs\nand the literate-only gap was 0.614 SDs. In 1910, the total 0% versus >50% gap\nwas 1.222 SDs and the literate-only gap was 1.166 SDs. For comparability, the\n0% versus >25% to 50% gaps in 1910 were 0.918 and 0.731 SDs.\n\nAs the figure above shows, the development of numeracy gaps in this group of\npeople who were all labeled Amerindian was continuous: more European\nadmixture, higher numeracy. Contrarily, the moderately-sized fully-White-but-\nstill-Amerindian sample included in 1910 was neck-and-neck with the\nAmerindians reported as >50% European in the same year. If we want, we can use\ntheir literacy rates to distinguish them. Doing that shows that the fully-\nWhite group outperformed the >50% European one by 0.218 SDs for averaged\nliteracy and numeracy.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t exhaust the Amerindian data. In the Censuses of 1900, 1910, and\n1930, Amerindians outside of the schedule sample were coded up as either\nmixed-blooded or full-blooded and the overwhelming majority of that mixture\nwas with Whites, so the admixture effect will primarily pertain to European\nadmixture. Let\u2019s go ahead and see how they looked:\n\nIn gap terms, in 1900, the gap between literate full-blooded Amerindians and\nliterate mixed-blooded Amerindians was 0.769 SDs in favor of the mixed-blooded\nones. In 1910, this gap developed to 0.861 SDs, and in 1930, it declined to\n0.242 SDs. The illiterate groups produced gaps of 0.684, 0.666, and 0.086 in\nthose years. In 1900 and 1910, the mixed-blooded illiterate group outperformed\nthe full-blooded literate group by 0.081 SDs in 1900 and 0.031 SDs in 1910,\nbut if fell behind by 1930, coming in at 0.199 SDs behind the literate full-\nblooded Amerindians.\n\nThis exhausts the Amerindian data. The results here showed that among\nAmerindians, that literate people were more numerate, and also, that less\nAmerindian ancestry came with greater numeracy.11 As this group has basically\nfallen apart in more recent cohorts and most of the people who self-identify\nas Amerindian are now primarily ancestrally European, there\u2019s obvious\ndifficulty in treating estimates in different time periods comparably.\n\nWho really knows what an Amerindian today is when he looks like a Swede? And\nhow early did people start to self-identify with their Amerindian ancestry in\nthis way? Until we know, interpretation here is limited. If we had indications\nthat a person was Mestizo (i.e., half-Amerindian, half-White), then we could\nalso compute the genetic contribution like we did with the Mulatto results.12\nBut, these results still seem to be aligned with the modern ones.\n\n####\n\nSection III: Puerto Ricans\n\nPuerto Rican Census results were available for the years 1910 and 1920. In\nPuerto Rico, racial identification differed: the categories meant different\nthings than they did in America proper. A person might say they\u2019re White, but\nthey\u2019ll really be, say, 50% Amerindian; they may say they\u2019re Black, but\nthey\u2019re actually Mulatto. In general, a Puerto Rican person who identifies as\nWhite, Black, or Mulatto is actually nowhere near 100% European, 100% African,\n50% of either or whatever their midpoint is for the social groups in that\nsociety. This misidentification relative to American identification was and\nremains so common, that it makes Puerto Rico a tidbit, more than something to\nsubstantively rely on.\n\nHowever, we do have one comparison with categorical consistency that we can\nuse to anchor the results: there were Whites from the U.S. who settled in\nPuerto Rico and were included in the island\u2019s Census. These immigrants should\nbe expected to be like other American Whites, i.e., around 100% European.\n\nIn 1910, 32.00%, 23.10%, and 27.05% of the Puerto Rican White, Mulatto, and\nBlack samples were literate, respectively. In 1920, these figures were 39.11%,\n31.72%, and 34.31%. In all of these cases, the U.S. Whites were literate.\nBecause they immigrated to Puerto Rico, it might also be reasonable to insist\nthey were selected with respect to numeracy, too. We can assess their numeracy\nrelative to Whites in the other Census years in the mainland, so before\nrelying on them to anchor our results, let\u2019s do that.\n\nU.S. Whites in Puerto Rico, as it turns out, were not selected relative to\nliterate Whites in the U.S. proper. In 1910, the gap favored the Puerto Rico-\nbased U.S. Whites by 0.118 SDs, and in 1920, it favored the U.S.-based Whites\nby 0.081 SDs. This is effectively no gap. We can safely use these U.S. Whites\nin Puerto Rico as an anchor, compared with the literate Puerto Rican groups.\nLet\u2019s check how things looked:\n\nIn Puerto Rico, numeracy really didn\u2019t seem to be racial. Instead, it was\nabout literacy. The racial categories used in Puerto Rico probably just didn\u2019t\nmean much with respect to ancestry. This seems likely because a\nU.S.-representative sample of Whites outperformed all of those groups\u2019\nliterate members by 1.035 to 1.091 SDs in 1910 and 0.826 to 0.899 SDs in 1920.\n\nIt is unclear if this Puerto Rican data reconstituted the modern results\nbecause racial self-identifications seem to be a poor proxy for one specific\ntype of ancestry in Puerto Rico compared to the U.S. These results still\nshowed that a group we know to be almost-entirely European outperformed groups\nthat we know to be variously mixed, but it didn\u2019t provide us any quantitative\nindication of the differences. Then again, we don\u2019t know if it should. Recall\nthat in the modern results, there was a non-monotonic relationship between\nskin tone and intelligence, and, likely because of the different effects of\ndifferent admixture sources on skin tone and intelligence, that non-monotonic\nrelationship was also accompanied with monotonically decreasing European\nadmixture.\n\nPopulations with more complex admixture histories will require deeper\ninvestigation; they may only be capable of being investigated with modern\ngenomic methods.\n\n###\n\nIs Admixture a Source for Deep Roots?\n\nOr in other words, do the modern and the mid-to-late-19th- and early-20th-\ncentury results align?\n\n  * For Black-White differences within the U.S.\u2014Yes.\n\n  * For Amerindian-White differences within the U.S.\u2014Yes.\n\n  * For Puerto Rican-White differences within the U.S. and in Puerto Rico\u2014Maybe.\n\nAdmixture-related differences in intelligence, numeracy, literacy, cognitive\nperformance\u2014pick your fighter\u2014are old. They are so old, in fact, that they\nwere observed to comparable degrees not only throughout the 20th century, but\nin the 19th as well. The evidence presented here is consistent with there\nbeing deep roots for today\u2019s admixture-related differences in intelligence.\n\nOne could claim modern results are biased. In that case, they\u2019re wrong. One\ncould claim the results using age heaping and literacy were biased in the\npast. In that case, they\u2019re probably right, but the results still line up with\ntoday\u2019s so closely that it\u2019s hard to actually take this complaint seriously.\nIt seems likely that, for as long as they\u2019ve been recorded, group differences\nhave been similarly-sized to those observed today, and that they varied\naccordingly with admixture and not appearance.\n\nThis post was merely descriptive. The dispositive high-powered co-sibling\ncontrol\u2014or ideally, co-dizygotic twin\u2014test remains to be completed. We can\nonly be sure that these results are well-aligned with genetics driving group\ndifferences in intelligence, and doing so consistently enough that any\nalternative theory will be forced to make wildly speculative and empirically\ndubious claims in opposition to it.\n\nIf, one day, someone linked together a dataset with these measures and a\ncognitive test, explicitly linking these measures to measured intelligence and\nmeasurement invariance could be tested. If measurement invariance held, it\nwould further constrain explanations in the past like they\u2019re constrained now.\nThis constraint is very strong: whatever people wish to contend about modern\nresults, their alternative hypotheses need to be about things that vary within\nthe populations being analyzed, without suggesting that the differences are\ndue to factors that only operate between groups.\n\nFuture analyses might feature groups like Asians and Ashkenazi Jews, who both\noutperform Whites. If, one day, there were samples of mixed-race Asian-White\nor Jewish-White samples to play around with, we might be able to see if there\nare benefits to certain types of non-European admixture among Whites, too. An\nadditional possibility is performing these analyses with Sephardim and\nAshkenazim, since it\u2019s plausible a priori that the differences between them in\na country like Israel would not be driven by discrimination.\n\nOnly time will tell if what the past reveals, the present shows, and the\nfuture holds are in agreement.13\n\n1\n\nThis is presumably linked to the fact that people develop a preference for\nfives or tens since they first count on their hands.\n\n2\n\nThis also reflects \u2018other-sampling\u2019 effects, where people approximately report\nthe ages of people they\u2019re asked about even though they might not misreport\ntheir own age.\n\n3\n\nOr performance on a simple literacy test.\n\n4\n\nThe stagnation in age heaping rather than a decline in performance also speaks\nto its relative lack of bias with respect to opportunity.\n\n5\n\nThis may be a source of error, so Crayen & Baten proposed a means of adjusting\nfor it and if a paper provided adjusted estimates, I opted to use those\ninstead of unadjusted ones.\n\n6\n\nI described why in a previous piece.\n\n7\n\nBut crucially, not much: remember, differences near thresholds translate to\nlarger standardized differences than those further away, and differences\nfurther from means have much larger representation differences than\nequivalently-sized ones nearer to means.\n\nTwo examples will suffice for clarification.\n\nThe first is for an index that\u2019s bounded between 0 and 100%. A difference of\n0.92 d if a high-scoring group is at 99% on this index would mean that the\nother group is at 92.02%. If the first group were instead at 90.41%, the\nsecond would be at 65% and there would still be a 0.92 d difference.\n\nThe second is for an index score with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation\nof 15, i.e., the typical \u201cIQ-metric\u201d. A score of 67 and a score of 70 have\npercentile ranks of 1.390 and 2.275. As a result, a score of 70 is 1.64 times\nas common as a score of 67. Scores of 95 and 98 have percentile ranks of 36.94\nand 44.70. Accordingly, a score of 98 is only 1.21 times as common as a score\nof 95.\n\n8\n\nThis study also showed that age heaping in 1820 predicted GDP in 1870 in a\ncross-national sample.\n\n9\n\nThis proportion is 89.52% if you use their alternative g measure based on an\nMGCFA instead of the EFA-based one and you use their provided 0.18 European\nadmixture-g correlation. The MGCFA-based gap was 0.93 g in size and the 0.18\ncorrelation was not based on the MGCFA result, so it may be higher or lower\nwith it, making this result indeterminate.\n\n10\n\nThus making this result inconsistent with two of the studies on skin color and\nIQs in Puerto Rico cited by Fuerst & Hu: Vincenty (1930) and Green (1972).\n\n11\n\nThus replicating Thornton & Young-DeMarco\u2019s results for literacy.\n\n12\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we could try something like this with the 1910\nsample that included fully-White people: we could consider them 100% European\nand consider the 0% group exactly that, then treat a combined >0% to 25%, >25%\nto 50%, and >50% group as if it were a Mestizo group. Since only 29 of the\nfully-White group (6.50%) were illiterate, but far higher percentages of the\nother groups were, we should constrain this exercise to the literate samples.\nThis leads to a midpoint of 0.561 and an amount explained by genetics equal to\n46.52%.\n\n13\n\nIncidentally, Steve Sailer has just written an article on the subject of old\nstudies of admixture differences.\n\n### Subscribe to Cremieux Recueil\n\nHundreds of paid subscribers\n\nI discuss papers that ought to be discussed.\n\n49 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n6 Restacks\n\n49\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Deep Roots of Intelligence Differences\n\nwww.cremieux.xyz\n\n13\n\nShare\n\n13 Comments\n\nDavidSep 20, 2023\u00b7edited Sep 20, 2023Liked by CremieuxCremieux, had to post\nthis here because I didn't know if you'd be notified of my comment on Aporia\nmagazine.This large Dutch study found that children of same-sex couples\nperformed better in school tests:\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122420957249No mention of\ngenes in it, but seems like genetic selection for intelligence. The media were\nhyping it as evidence gay parents are better. I think it's more like lesbian\ncouples get to pick a sperm donor and choose wisely. I think if gay couples\nwere to always use surrogates and pick intelligent and stable sperm/egg\ndonors, they'd be quite eugenic. Note the small number of gay male couples\nwith kids though (although the paper does highlight some additional reasons\nfor why this is, I suspect most gay men have no interest in kids, kind of\nmakes me think the whole moral panic about gay men and kids is a bit\noverblown...)Anyway this study could be worth discussing at some point.
