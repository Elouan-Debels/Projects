Jacobson, who posted the renewable energy usage data on X,\nannouncing that supply has exceeded California's demand for 30 of the past 38\ndays.\n\nPhotovoltaic solar panels and wind turbines at San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm in\nPalm Springs, California.

Over 80 percent of renewable energy was supplied\nfrom solar, according to Jacobson's data from last week.\n\nThe professor also predicted that California would be solely reliant on wind,\nwater, and solar energy by 2035 following the recent success. The state's\nofficial goal is to run exclusively renewable a decade later, however, in\n2045.\n\n\"It's wild that this isn't getting more news coverage,\" Ian Magruder from\nelectrification non-profit group Rewiring America wrote in response to\nJacobson's post.\n\nRead more Renewable energy\n\n  * ### Couple Spend 'Sweat and Tears' Transforming $7K School Bus Into Dream Home\n\n\"This has never happened before in history. Yes, California has briefly hit\nthis milestone before on a few very sunny days since 2022. But never so\nconsistently over a two week stretch,\" Magruder said.\n\nThe electrification campaigner said the news was made even more impressive as\nCalifornia has the world's latest grid-connected battery storage facility,\nwhich only went online in January.\n\nThis allows for the excess renewable energy to be stored up and used overnight\nwhen the solar energy cannot be used, Magruder explained.\n\nAccording to the most recent data published by the California Energy\nCommission last year, more than 37 percent of the state's energy was from its\nrenewables portfolio\u2014an increase of just three percent on the previous year.\n\nBut despite its recent clean energy success, the U.S.'s most populous state is\nstill heavily reliant on non-renewable energy.\n\nCalifornia was the seventh-largest producer of crude oil among U.S. states in\n2022, and the third for crude oil refining capacity, according to the most\nrecent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n## Uncommon Knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines\n\n### About the writer\n\nChristian Oliver\n\nTo read how Newsweek uses AI as a newsroom tool, Click here.\n\nTrending\n\n  1. 01\n\n### Chinese Runner's Marathon Win Raises Questions: 'Extremely Odd'\n\n8 comments\n\n  2. 02\n\n### Bishop Stabbed During Middle of Church Service\n\n56 comments\n\n  3. 03\n\n### Is There Mail on Tax Day?
