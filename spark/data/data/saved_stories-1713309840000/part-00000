It is operating in the\nshadows.\n\nNone of the normal footprints are visible on the London bullion market or the\nChicago Mercantile. Retail goldbugs have not been buyers: ETF gold funds have\nbeen shrinking since December. The crowd is piling into the Bitcoin scam\ninstead.\n\nYet gold has smashed through a four-year barrier around $2,000 an ounce,\nrising in parabolic fashion since mid-February, and hitting an all-time high\nof $2,431 on April 11. Is somebody preparing for an escalation of the shadow\nThird World War?\n\n### Stay informed, stay ahead\n\nSign up to our newsletters and always be quiz ready, with the best of the\nTelegraph - and exclusives - delivered straight to your inbox\n\nBusiness Briefing Newsletter\n\nBusiness Briefing Newsletter\n\nSign up for a daily digest packed with news and analysis\n\nBy creating a Telegraph account, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and our\nPrivacy Policy.\n\n\u201cIt is not a Western institution behind this. It is a massive player with very\ndeep pockets. I have never seen this kind of buying before,\u201d said Ross Norman,\na veteran gold trader and now chief executive of Metals Daily.\n\nGold has been ratcheting up fresh records against the headwinds of a strong\ndollar, a 70 point jump in 10-year US Treasury yields, and hawkish talk from\nthe Federal Reserve. This mix would normally spell trouble for gold.\n\nWhoever it is \u2013 or they are \u2013 seems insensitive to cost. Central banks do not\nbehave like this. \u201cThey buy on the London benchmark and they don\u2019t chase the\nprice,\u201d said Mr Norman. This rally is happening off books in the OTC market.\n\nYes, China\u2019s central bank has been adding to its declared gold reserves for 17\nconsecutive months, part of the gradual portfolio shift away from US\nTreasuries and European bonds by the Global South.\n\nDollar weaponisation since the war in Ukraine has unnerved every country\naligned with the authoritarian axis of China and Russia. None can feel safe\nparking money in Western securities after Russia\u2019s foreign reserves were\nfrozen.\n\nYet the scale is modest. The World Gold Council said central banks bought a\nnet 18 tonnes in February: 12 in China, six in Kazakhstan and India, four in\nTurkey, partly offset by Russian sales. This hardly moves the needle.\n\n### Stay informed, stay ahead\n\nSign up to our newsletters and always be quiz ready, with the best of the\nTelegraph - and exclusives - delivered straight to your inbox\n\nBusiness Briefing Newsletter\n\nBusiness Briefing Newsletter\n\nSign up for a daily digest packed with news and analysis\n\nBy creating a Telegraph account, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and our\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nThe Chinese people certainly have been buying gold, creating traffic jams at\nthe Shuibei jewellery hub. Precious metal is the only refuge from the property\ncrash and the slump on the Shanghai bourse. Tightening capital controls make\nit hard to smuggle serious sums abroad.\n\nBut this alone cannot account for the price surge, either. Mr Norman says the\ngold flow to Asia has been within normal bounds.\n\nSo let me take two stabs at this mystery, one geopolitical and one financial.\nIt has been clear for three years that Russia, China and Iran are operating in\ncollusion, each feeding opportunistically on each other. All three have\nfostered belligerent hyper-nationalism as a means of regime survival, and all\naim to press their advantage against a fatally complacent West before the\nwindow of opportunity closes.\n\nThis menace on three fronts has reached a dangerous juncture. None of the\nmajor democracies have put their economies on a war-time footing despite the\nobvious threat.\n\nThe West has dropped the ball on Ukraine \u2013 or worse, it is preventing Ukraine\nfrom hitting Russian oil facilities \u2013 and has therefore left the door wide\nopen for a knock-out blow by the Kremlin this summer.\n\nIran has been emboldened by Putin\u2019s military comeback. It is also flush with\nmoney. Joe Biden is so worried about rising petrol prices that he has turned a\nblind eye to sanctions busting, letting Iran sell as much crude as it wants.\nThis has enabled Tehran to advance its pawns in the Middle East, and now to\nrisk a direct missile strike against Israel.\n\nThe third shoe has yet to drop but China knows that the West has run down its\nstock of military kit trying to contain these other two crises. Xi Jinping may\nnever have a better moment to tighten the noose on Taiwan with a naval and air\nblockade, gaining a stranglehold over the West\u2019s supply of advanced\nsemiconductors that can then be used as a bargaining chip. How would the\ndemocracies respond to this?\n\nThere is a strong suspicion among gold experts that China is behind the surge\nin buying, building up a war-fighting bullion chest through state-controlled\nbanks and proxies. But others, too, can see that we are living through a\nfundamental convulsion of the global order, and that the dollarised financial\nsystem will not be the same at the end of it. Gold is the hedge against\ndystopia.\n\n### Stay informed, stay ahead\n\nSign up to our newsletters and always be quiz ready, with the best of the\nTelegraph - and exclusives - delivered straight to your inbox\n\nBusiness Briefing Newsletter\n\nBusiness Briefing Newsletter\n\nSign up for a daily digest packed with news and analysis\n\nBy creating a Telegraph account, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and our\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nHowever, there is a parallel explanation. Covid finally broke our spendthrift\ngovernments. The talk in hedge fund land is that some big beasts are taking\nbets against \u201cfiscal dominance\u201d across the West.\n\nIt is a collective judgment that too many countries have pushed public debt\nbeyond 100pc of GDP and beyond the point of no return under prevailing\neconomic ideologies and political regimes. Budget deficits have broken out of\nhistorical ranges and are running at structurally untenable levels for this\nstage of the cycle.\n\nCentral banks will bottle it \u2013 under this scenario \u2013 in order to mop up\nissuance of treasury bonds. They will let inflation run hot to help states\nwhittle down debts by stealth default. You might argue that this is what they\nalready did by letting rip with extreme money creation during the pandemic.\n\nThe Bank of Japan is refusing to raise rates above zero or halt bond purchases\neven though core inflation is 2.8pc and the Rengo wage round is running at\n5.2pc. This is what a debt trap looks like. With a debt-to-GDP ratio above\n260pc, Japan cannot return to sound money without risking a fiscal crisis.\n\nOlivier Blanchard, global debt guru and former IMF chief economist, once told\nme how this would unfold by the mid-2020s. \u201cOne day the BoJ may get a call\nfrom the finance ministry saying please think about us \u2013 it is a life or death\nquestion \u2013 and keep rates at zero for a bit longer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe European Central Bank is also in a debt trap. It continued to buy buckets\nof Club Med bonds even when inflation was over 10pc. This was patently a\nfiscal rescue for semi-solvent states. The ECB has backed off for now but will\nbe forced to shield Italy again with fiscal transfers disguised as QE in the\nnext downturn.\n\nThe Fed has largely monetised the Trump-Biden jumbo deficits. It now faces an\ninvidious choice: either it stays the course against inflation, at the risk of\na US funding crisis, a commercial property/banking crisis, and recession, all\nending in a return to QE and fiscal dominance; or it cuts rates hard and fast\nbefore inflation is under control, also ending in fiscal dominance. Is gold\nsniffing this out?\n\nOf course, the gold spike may be nothing more than wolf pack speculation by\nfunds orchestrating a squeeze on bullion shorts through the options market,\nknowing that this sets off a self-fueling feedback loop. If so, the rally will\nshort-circuit soon enough.\n\nMy bet is that a big animal with a Chinese accent is bracing for geopolitical\nor monetary disorder on a traumatic scale.\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Gold,\n  * China,\n  * Dollar,\n  * Inflation,\n  * European Central Bank\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
