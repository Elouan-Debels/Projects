He\u2019s a friendly guy who gets to know a lot of people,\nbut I\u2019ve never seen him reach this level of celebrity; I half-expected\npaparazzi to spring out from the closet, flashbulbs popping, shouting demands\nfor a smile and repeating the barrage of caller questions: \u201cJake! Jake! Over\nhere! How are you settling in at home? What needs to be ordered? Are there any\nservices you would benefit from?\u201d\n\nJake\u2019s surgery was performed at the Mayo Clinic Phoenix, whose ENT department\nperforms a large number of complex surgeries, many of which remove patients\u2019\nentire voice box, so you\u2019d think the people calling from the ENT department\n(the department responsible for cutting out his tongue) would be aware of the\npotential pitfalls of calling to speak to a tongueless man with a tracheostomy\nhole in his neck diverting air from his vocal chords. It\u2019s like an army\ngeneral being surprised that rifles are loud. ENT was in good company, though,\nsince we also fielded calls from scheduling, nursing follow up, physical\ntherapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), home healthcare, medical suppliers,\nand insurance\u2014all insisting that they must speak to Jake, as if their own\nlives, not Jake\u2019s, depended on this impossible demand.\n\nWhen case management called, I felt momentary relief, figuring they\u2019d take\nover the project management job that had fallen to me\u2014but no, they only wanted\nto speak with Jake, as well. \u201cBut you\u2019re case management, aren\u2019t you supposed\nto be managing all this?\u201d I asked, and they laughed. I wasn\u2019t trying to be\nfunny. I can\u2019t even remember what they wanted, but it wasn\u2019t to manage Jake\u2019s\ncase.\n\nBecause these were healthcare-related calls, we ran into legal and\nbureaucratic challenges immediately. Most went something like this:\n\nMe: Hi, this is Jake\u2019s wife. He can\u2019t speak because he just had his tongue cut\nout, but I can talk.\n\nThem: I understand, that\u2019s fine. We just need his quick verbal consent\nallowing you to speak on his behalf.\n\nMe: But he...can\u2019t speak.\n\nThem: I\u2019ll hold.\n\nMe: I don\u2019t mean he can\u2019t speak right now. I mean he can\u2019t speak at all. He\nhas no tongue.\n\nThem: Is there a better time to call back?\n\nMe: Not really, he still won\u2019t have a tongue later, but I can speak with you.\n\nThem: Sure, can we get his verbal consent first?\n\nI asked my friend R., who is a lawyer, if logic questions like this ever make\nit onto the LSAT admissions exams. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cif you say that question\nseems reasonable, then they let you become a lawyer.\u201d\n\nCalls begat other calls like rabbits beget rabbits. Once the calls immediately\nconcerning Jake\u2019s medical care and health status concluded, we got additional\ncalls from the hospital to query about the quality-of-care Jake had received\nor was receiving. Then, we started getting calls about the quality of the\ncalls about the quality of Jake\u2019s medical care. Still with me?\n\nBetween fielding phone calls, I was busying myself with keeping Jake alive,\nincluding tracking and administering medications on time, caring for his\ntrache tube (to prevent infections that could be fatal), PEG tube, surgical\nsite, and the ever-important job of staring intently at Jake while he slept to\nmake sure that he continued breathing, an act of magical-thinking that I only\ntook a break from when I passed out, or when I had to run to another room to\nget the ringing phone I\u2019d foolishly removed from my pocket.\n\nAs my worry, delirium, and sleeplessness mounted, and the phone calls showed\nno sign of abating, conversations became increasingly absurd; I started to\nfeel my already tenuous sanity chipping away with each ring:\n\nMe: Hi, thank you for calling back, yes I would like to schedule a home\nhealthcare appointment. No, Jake can\u2019t speak. He has no tongue. Sure, I can\nbring the phone to him. Ok, you\u2019re on speakerphone.\n\nThem: Hi Jake! If you give us consent we can talk to your wife.\n\nJake: Claps twice\n\nThem: We have to hear you give verbal consent.\n\nJake: turns the suction machine on high and points it at the phone, which\nmakes a wet, uncomfortable slurping noise.\n\nThem: I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t understand you.\n\nMe, assuming a false baritone: Sure you can talk to my wife!\n\nThem: Ma\u2019am that was you.\n\nMy favorite conversation coincided with the day I hit the rock-bottom of\nfrustration:\n\nMe: Thanks for calling back. No, Jake still can\u2019t speak.\n\nThem: We\u2019ll be quick. Can we get his verbal consent?\n\nMe: No, sorry, we have a cat.\n\nThem: A what?\n\nMe: A cat.\n\nThem: Can you bring the phone to Jake so he doesn\u2019t have to get up?\n\nMe: The cat isn\u2019t on Jake\u2019s lap. The cat HAS IT!\n\nThem: Has what?\n\nMe: His tongue!\n\nThem: The cat\u2019s got his tongue?\n\nMe: Rings the loud brass bell\n\nJake: Rings the loud brass bell.\n\nDialtone.\n\nOne painful thing is that the many people calling were well intentioned. They\nwanted to do the right thing! But they\u2019d been set up in a rigid system that\ndidn\u2019t and, as far as I know, still doesn\u2019t conform to the disabilities of the\npatients within it.\n\nLest you think we lack creativity or sympathy for the callers\u2019 obligation to\nmedical privacy, we suggested substituting rhythmic communication. I googled\nthe morse code for: \u201cMy wife can speak for me\u201d, which translates to:\n\n\\-- -.-- / .-- .. ..-. . / -.-. .- -. / ... .--. . .- -.- / ..-. --- .-. / --\n.\n\nBut if you thought Jake and I were agitated by the requests that he bark on\ncommand like a trained seal, it paled in comparison to the lack of patience\nexhibited by callers who\u2019d hang up before Jake could get through the second\nround of dots and dashes. For people who had the tenacity to keep calling and\nask the same unanswerable question, they had a very low tolerance for what we\nthought were clever work arounds.1\n\nIf you think this sounds invented for comic effect, you\u2019re not alone. When I\nrelay these stories to friends, they ask reasonable questions: Why not contact\nJake by text message or a chat box online? If customer service for Amazon can\ndo it, why can\u2019t a large academic hospital, with a sizeable endowment, find\nbetter ways to communicate?\n\nI broached that question on one of my many calls with the ENT department. \u201cWe\nknow it\u2019s a big problem,\u201d they said helplessly, \u201cBut we haven\u2019t been provided\na way around it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the tech doesn\u2019t exist\u2014AOL chatrooms have been around since the\nlate \u201990s2\u2014but adopting tech in healthcare is a bit like asking someone to\nlearn a basic programming language, but refusing to give them a computer until\nthey get 100 different petition signatures and wait for a law to pass saying\nthat the CIA approves of them typing. There will have to be a meeting, and\nthen a meeting about the meeting and maybe, in a few years, the hospital will\nhave a meeting about implementing something, as long as it doesn\u2019t cost too\nmuch.\n\nIllness is dehumanizing, and we could alleviate some of the dehumanization\nthrough technology. Healthcare has less of a tech innovation problem than a\ntech adoption problem, and what healthcare embraces often perversely adds to\nthe burdens of healthcare providers. Electronic medical records were a federal\nrequirement made in 2009 (with compliance required by 2014). And yet, since\n2014, I\u2019ve never worked at a place at which the EMR improves the doctor\npatient relationships; if anything, EMR requirements forces physicians away\nfrom patient care and in front of a screen, spending on average 4.5 hours a\nday clicking boxes and entering patient information.\n\nThe only way to streamline the process is to chart while seeing the patient,\nwhich means making eye contact with a screen full of clickboxes instead of the\npatient who deserves full attention. I\u2019d love to have a more human and humane\nexperience, but then who\u2019ll fill out the forms? Are you going to? Maybe AI\nwill, in the future, but in the present a human must.\n\nFilling out the EMR is the second-most-important part of modern medicine,\nbehind billing insurance. When it comes to hospital-based metrics, physicians\nare evaluated on how quickly their charts are completed\u2014No chart? No bill\u2014but\nnot on whether they felt that the required time charting could\u2019ve been better\nspent on actual patient care (spoiler alert: it could have been).\n\nEMRs were supposed to make sharing patient information between hospitals\neasier, but specialized programs are often needed to share charts, and,\ndepending on the EMR company used, sharing can be difficult, if not\nimpossible. Signing a release to share information through an EMR record\nexchange like Care Everywhere doesn\u2019t help if the records are at a hospital\nutilizing a different exchange program or EMR than the requesting hospital.\n\nEMR access also isn\u2019t shared with most medical suppliers and third-party home\ncare, PT and OT, which is why we got the relentless phone-call barrage from\npeople who knew Jake needed something, but didn\u2019t know what or why. Their\nunderstanding was limited to the data shared with them, which, because of how\nHIPAA laws are interpreted or implemented, was incomplete. I\u2019m reminded of the\nstory of the blind men and the elephant: each can touch a different part of\nthe elephant, but none perceive the whole animal. Non-hospital entities asked\nto speak with Jake not to mock us, though it started to feel that way, but\nbecause they didn\u2019t know he couldn\u2019t. The people who called us were never the\nproblem. The problem is Moloch.\n\nShare\n\nInstead of the slick AI assistants being peddled online with the frequency of\nmultilevel marketers at a high school reunion, you may have noticed that\nobsolete tech still enjoys its glory days in the medical field: pagers are\nubiquitous, brick-sized mobile phones that only work within the perimeter of\nthe hospital and, of course the fax machine, ostensibly because it\u2019s the most\n\u201csecure\u201d way to send patient information. So much for the seamless integration\nof EMRs. I have a fax app on my phone for the sole purpose of being able to\nfax things from my fax app. When I receive things by fax they\u2019re sent\n(unencrypted) to my fax app, which also sends a copy (unencrypted) to my\nemail. This is considered HIPAA compliant, even though sending information to\nor from my e-mail directly somehow isn\u2019t. It\u2019s security theater akin to a\npublic TSA patdown. The extra steps are redundant and time consuming,\nespecially when email encryption programs like Hushmail for Healthcare\u2014which\nis HIPAA compliant ant 24.99/month\u2014exist.3\n\nA combination of clunky EMRs, strict health information privacy laws, and poor\ntech acts to prevent patients from receiving streamlined care, instead of\nfacilitating it.\n\nI\u2019ve heard rumors that a year ago some hospitals got a secure chat upgrade in\nEPIC which allows them to not only discuss a patient\u2019s case with other\nhealthcare workers, but message the patient directly, though I\u2019ve never met a\ndoctor who\u2019s actually used it. Chime in in the comments if you\u2019re one of those\ndoctors, though it may be a legend, like El Chupacabra.\n\nMyChart allows patients to leave messages instead of calling, but it lacks a\nreal-time component, and responses can take 24-48 hours. Other HIPAA compliant\nand encrypted options like Rocket Chat, Secure Chat, and Tiger Text could be\nreappropriated to allow anyone on the healthcare team to text a patient. Not\nhaving a communication plan for a patient who is about to lose their voice is\nlike sending someone home after cutting off their legs and refusing to give\nthem a wheelchair. Sure, they could drag themselves on the ground using their\narm, but there are probably better options.\n\nJake\u2019s written:\n\n> Let\u2019s say Bess wasn\u2019t helping me, how would I handle those calls?\u201d Which is\n> another way of saying: \u201cIf Bess wasn\u2019t here, how would I have made\n> appointments, scheduled home care, ordered the necessities that kept me\n> alive? How would I have found a clinical trial and called the investigators\n> and established care? How would I have had the hundred of conversations that\n> are the reason I\u2019m still breathing?\n\nJake\u2019s told me that, without me, he would\u2019ve pushed enough opioids to resolve\nthe problem forever. His life was that hard. Given what I saw, I can\u2019t blame\nhim for contemplating the dark path. Without someone to do comprehensive case\nmanagement and act as his home health supervisor, Jake would be dead. Jake\nlosing his voice wasn\u2019t a matter of inconvenience, but of life or death.\n\nI often wonder: How does anyone do this alone? when discharging patients\nwithout family support, or sick, elderly patients who are alone and don\u2019t\nqualify for nursing home placement. Now I know the answer is: they don\u2019t.4\n\nAs Jake recovered from surgery, lack of a voice wasn\u2019t the only problem. As he\nbecame more alert, it was important to me that Jake not feel helpless. In the\nER, I see how lonely and enervating illness can be.5 Although he\u2019d lost his\ntongue and a large part of his left thigh, which was used to make the inert\nflap that replaces his tongue, he wasn\u2019t an invalid. He had the capacity for\nthought\u2014or as much capacity as any man does6. Lack of text-based communication\noptions wasn\u2019t solely a safety issue, but one of self-actualization.\n\nJake struggled to live with his new deficits, but, sadly, the healthcare\nsystem struggled to deal with them, too. A 2021 study in Health Affairs found\nthat \u201cOnly 40.7% of physicians were very confident about their ability to\nprovide equal quality care to patients with disability, just 56.5% strongly\nagreed they welcome disabled patients into their practices, and 18.1% strongly\nagreed that the health care system often treats these patients unfairly.\u201d7\n\nYou never know how you\u2019ll respond to a crisis. I\u2019ve written about the ways\nthat Jake and I have turned inwards toward each other since his surgery:\nmostly out of love, but also out of fatigue. Interacting with other people is\nexhausting. Jake\u2019s hard to understand, and even a voice-to-text app, or having\nme repeat what he\u2019s saying, adds a layer of frustrating latency to what\nwould\u2019ve, pre-cancer, been quick, easy, conversations.\n\nJake has written that people also hear his slurred voice and assume he\u2019s\nmentally disabled. Being with each other is easy when so little else of life\nis. Even though I hear Jake and understand him, I alone can\u2019t make up for\neverything he\u2019s lost, no matter how many calls I make. Dependence on me, while\nnot a burden, is still precarious.\n\nLast month, I realized how vulnerable Jake\u2019s situation is by losing my voice,\ntoo. I had minor surgery to remove a cyst from my vocal cord\u2014evidently, Jake\nand I are trying to keep every ENT in Arizona in business. I kept putting the\nsurgery off, because I was afraid of two things: the surgery damaging my\nvoice, or that Jake may suddenly need care urgently coordinated while I\u2019m on\nmandated voice rest.\n\nHis survival has depended on my ability to talk, which the cyst itself\nthreatened, so I timed the procedure to correspond to a nadir in calls: when I\ngot the procedure done, Jake was stable on the clinical trial drug, he didn\u2019t\nhave scans for another few weeks, and his appointments were scheduled for the\nnext two months. I couldn\u2019t even squeak. In an emergency, I\u2019d only be able to\nwhistle.\n\nWhen I got home from the cyst-removal surgery, my days with Jake were as easy\nand comforting without words as they are with them, although we learned that\nJake\u2019s terrible at charades: no amount of pointing or miming could get my\npoint across better than a pad and paper. Nobody\u2019s perfect. It seemed like the\nweek would go smoothly enough. We\u2019d stay in our bubble and read, cook, relax,\nand just be silent. Then the blasted phone rang.\n\nThis time it was for me:\n\nThem: Hello, this is Valley ENT, is Bess there? We\u2019re calling to schedule\nspeech-therapy follow up.\n\nMe: whistles a little hello tune.\n\nThem: hello?\n\nMe: whistles and claps like one of those toy monkeys with brass symbols\n\nJake: Bess can\u2019t speak right now she just had surgery. I\u2019m her husband and can\nspeak for her.\n\nThat\u2019s what I hear Jake say, but, of course, Jake is slurring and dropping\nphonemes that require tongue motion. The caller can\u2019t see Jake\u2019s lips move and\nisn\u2019t used to hearing people without a tongue.\n\nThem: What? Hello? Are you there?\n\nMe: Whistles again. Vigorously.\n\nJake: Bess can\u2019t...\n\nDialtone.\n\nMaybe I should have played a kazoo for the callers instead?\n\nLuckily, I got a text alert with an assigned appointment time, asking if I\nwanted to check in online, though there was no online option to reschedule and\nthe number that texted me didn\u2019t accept replies. The time was good enough, or\nat least, it had to be, since I had no way to change it.\n\nIf you can\u2019t speak for yourself, how do you get people to hear?\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, consider the Go Fund Me that\u2019s funding my husband\nJake\u2019s ongoing cancer treatment.\n\nSupport Jake's Cancer Treatments\n\nIf you enjoyed reading, let me know by giving the heart button below a tap,\ncommenting, sharing, and subscribing. You can also read Jake\u2019s perspective\n(and I highly recommend that you do!) at JakeSeliger.com.\n\n1\n\nThis is not the first, and won\u2019t be the last, time I\u2019m told that I\u2019m not as\nclever as I think I am.\n\n2\n\nWould patient identification questions be improved if they began with\nAge/Sex/Location? (If you\u2019re under the age of 40, this joke may not be funny.\nThe internet was a weirdly homogenous place back in the days of 50 websites,\nso everyone understood the same references. There was no Instagram, the only\ndancing you got was mushrooms and badgers. Anyway, \u201cI\u2019m old\u201d is the point,\nlet\u2019s move on.\n\n3\n\nAnd then there is the struggle to share Jake\u2019s CT scans between institutions.\nDVDs shipped by mail still play a role.\n\n4\n\nThis may be the topic of another essay.\n\n5\n\nMost patients don\u2019t have kinds of beautiful experiences described in \u201cLove has\nwon: strangers, lovers, and the doctors who bet on them in a NYC ER.\u201dMost\npatients don\u2019t have kinds of beautiful experiences described in \u201cLove has won:\nstrangers, lovers, and the doctors who bet on them in a NYC ER.\u201d\n\n6\n\nKidding. Kidding.\n\n7\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) doesn\u2019t solve the problem. ADA laws\nrequire wheelchair accessibility of doctor\u2019s offices, hospitals, and clinics\nby having wide entry doors and rooms that allow for free movement, as well as\nassistance in getting onto exam tables and other necessary areas for exams.\nFor people who can\u2019t hear, the ADA places responsibility for providing\neffective communication, including use of interpreters, directly on covered\nentities. Meaning, a patient doesn\u2019t have to provide their own interpreter.\nBut no law directly protects and serves patients who can\u2019t speak. Although\npartial solutions exist, no one told us about them! It\u2019s possible to use an\naccessibility feature on cell phones and call a TTY relay during business\nhours, which allows the caller to text a third party who speaks for the caller\n. Maybe it\u2019s not HIPAA compliant? We\u2019d have signed a release form. It would\nhave been nice to be told about it for non-sensitive calls. Also, can\u2019t the\nhospital get cell phones and text? What about trained carrier pigeon?\n\n### Subscribe to Everything Is An Emergency\n\nBy Bess Stillman \u00b7 Launched 7 months ago\n\nI'm Bess Stillman: ER doctor, writer, and wife to Jake Seliger, who is\ncurrently dying of SCC of the tongue.
