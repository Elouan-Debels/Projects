The catch: such a downturn would be\none self-induced by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"If we continue to get inflation prints at these levels, the [Federal Reserve]\nis going to find itself backed into a corner where they need to cause a\nrecession if they're going to hold that 2% inflation target,\" Ian Lyngen, BMO\nCapital Markets head of US rates strategy, said.\n\nHis comments follow after March's consumer price index came in hotter-than-\nexpected on Wednesday, increasing 3.5% on an annual basis, against 3.4% year-\nover-year forecasts. The rate was higher than both January and February\nprints.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThis has essentially crushed market bets on a quick interest rate pivot from\nthe Fed, with futures markets no longer counting on June as the starting point\nfor easing. Instead, a majority of investors are eyeing September as more\nlikely, according to the CME FedWatch Tool \u2014 though odds are below 50%.\n\nThe recession risk from the Fed may come as the central bank realizes that its\ncurrent fed funds rate of 5.25% to 5.50% isn't restrictive enough to clamp\ndown on inflation, Lyngen said.\n\nThis echoes recent warnings that others have put out, that the Fed could be\npressured to pursue a rate hike.\n\nFrances Donald, who also took part in the Bloomberg interview, agreed, noting\nthat recession risk is increasing as the Fed loses data support to cut in the\nnear term.\n\n\"Now that we're back to an environment where we're losing those embedded rate\ncuts, we actually have to increase the chance of something bad happening\nhere,\" the chief economist at Manulife Investment Management warned, adding:\n\"They may have to stay higher until something breaks. That's the problem.\"\n\nSome have suggested that it's time for the Fed to instead adjust its inflation\ntarget rate to 3%, and in doing so ease these risks.\n\nLeading economist Mohamed El-Erian is among this cohort, recently warning that\ninterest rate policy will have to remain unchanged for years if the Fed wants\nto reach 2% inflation.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
