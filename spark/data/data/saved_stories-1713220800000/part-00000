In this world, back-catalog downloads are de\nrigueur, average episode consumption rates approach 100%, and conversion rates\nare off the charts. But fiction podcasters are grossly underserved by most, if\nnot all, podcast-listening apps. With a few tweaks, podcast app developers\ncould win over a fiercely loyal audience who love to share.\n\nBy\n\nEvo Terra\n\n-\n\nCurator of The End\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always the case, but the first-time listener experience for\naudiobooks today is quite good. Install the Audible app\u2014or substitute any\naudiobook app of your liking\u2014on your mobile device, choose a book, and start\nlistening from chapter one. Yes, I\u2019m glossing over the \u201csign up for an account\nand pay\u201d necessary steps, but that\u2019s all integrated into the onboarding. If\nyou don\u2019t listen much to audiobooks, you\u2019ll have to take me at my word\u2014it is\ndead simple to do so.\n\nCompare that to the first-time listener experience for fiction podcasts, which\nis quite bad, if I\u2019m being brutally honest. Install a podcast-listening app\u2014or\nchoose the one that is already on your phone, possibly one you play music with\nor maybe watch videos in?\u2014and choose a fiction podcast. No, not just any\npodcast. A fiction podcast. Yeah. You gotta hunt for those. That\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll\nwait. Found one? Cool! Follow it, or subscribe to it, whatever the app calls\nit, as the terms are synonymous in podcasting. Why do you have to follow or\nsubscribe instead of \u201cstart listening?\u201d Because that\u2019s how podcasts work.\nDon\u2019t fret. You\u2019ve followed one? Excellent. Now start listening to the show.\nNo, wait! Not that episode. That\u2019s the most recent episode that was posted for\nthe show. Or it\u2019s the first episode of the third season, and you haven\u2019t\nlistened to seasons one or two yet. Confused? Fixing it is easy. Go into your\nsettings and change the sort order. Again, don\u2019t fret. That\u2019s just how\npodcasts work! You\u2019ll get used to it. What\u2019s that? You say you\u2019re hearing an\nepisode of a completely different show now? Ah. We call those episode drops.\nIt\u2019s from 2017, you say? Yeah, well... you can always skip it. And now you\u2019re\nhearing the creators talking to themselves? That\u2019s a filler episode the\ncreators put out in 2018 when they were taking an unforeseen short break and\nthey wanted to let their listeners know of the delay. No, it\u2019s not relevant to\nyou now. Yes, it\u2019s a speed bump. Just skip it. What\u2019s happening now? Episode\nfour of the second season is playing next instead of the second episode of the\nfirst season? Oh, that\u2019s because the app isn\u2019t sorting episodes properly,\npartly because the creator tagged it wrong, but also because the app doesn\u2019t\nkey on the correct tags. So what you need to do now is\u2014Wait! Where are you\ngoing?\n\nFiction podcasts may be free to listen to, but getting there isn\u2019t worth the\ncost for many, and all fiction podcast creators pay the price. Which leads me\nto this bold statement:\n\n## Fiction podcasts are fundamentally incompatible with most podcast-listening\napps\n\nThat headline is going to spark a lot of anger amongst my fellow fiction\npodcast listeners. After all, we clearly have no trouble finding and consuming\nfiction podcasts to our heart\u2019s content, so I must be being hyperbolic, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nWe, the extant fiction podcast listeners, have figured out ways to make our\npreferred podcast-listening apps function well enough. We\u2019re not new, so we\u2019re\nOK\u2014or we\u2019ve become OK\u2014if not adept at tweaking the settings buried inside our\nchosen apps to make them functional, removing a good portion of the horror\nexpressed in the second paragraph of this article. We\u2019ve even convinced\nourselves that the status quo is fine and perhaps is a rite of passage other\npotential fiction podcast listeners must go through to join our ranks.\n\nBullshit.\n\nWe need our apps to work as well for fiction podcasts as they do \u201cnormal\u201d\npodcasts. And even if we, the experienced fiction podcast listeners, don\u2019t\nthink we need it, I assure you that regular people can\u2019t be bothered with the\nbullshit we put up with, keeping fiction podcasts at arm's length because\nthey\u2019re too hard to listen to. Which, considering some of the amazing fiction\npodcasts available to potential listeners, is a damned shame.\n\n## Which is the best fiction podcast-listening app?\n\nApple Podcasts. There. I said it. Which is also pissing off a lot of readers\nright now. I beg your patience as I lay out my position.\n\nLet me start with this, a comparison chart of the fiction-podcast-specific\ncapabilities of 21 podcast-listening apps. I\u2019ll break down those capabilities\nand explain why each is important\u2014if not critical\u2014to first-time users\nlistening (or trying to listen) to fiction podcasts on each of those apps.\n\nFig 1: 21 podcast-listening apps compared\n\nThe apps have been \u201cscored,\u201d with elements weighted by an increasing\nimportance scale of 1, 2, or 3 (I\u2019ll explain shortly), and then sorted by\ndescending score. Apple Podcasts is #1, followed by Podverse, a relatively new\napp with Podcasting 2.0 features, then Pocket Casts, a long-running podcast\napp, then another newer app called Podfriend that\u2019s also built with Podcasting\n2.0 services, and then Spotify to round out the top five.\n\nYou probably think it\u2019s weird that Spotify didn\u2019t rank higher. Given how\npopular Spotify is among fiction podcast listeners, I understand why it seems\nweird. Looking at app popularity by share of downloads will show a very\ndifferent story. But I\u2019m not looking at current usage by seasoned podcast\nlisteners. I\u2019m solely interested in the experience for new listeners of\nfiction podcasts, a demographic not captured by current usage trends.\n\nThe attributes in the far left column and how well an app adheres to said\nattributes are what determine the score given to each app. Let me explain in\nmore detail.\n\n## What are the characteristics of an excellent fiction podcast-listening app?\n\nIf you\u2019re an app developer, this is the part you came for. As you read this,\nplease keep in mind that your app is probably amazing at certain things. You\nvery likely have a dedicated user base who loves what you are doing. Keep on\nkeepin\u2019 on. If it works in your tech stack to make some of these modifications\nwithout negatively impacting your core, outstanding. If not... well, I will\nconcede that the audience for fiction podcasts is smaller than \u201cnormal\u201d\npodcasts. Bear that in mind as you evaluate your priorities.\n\nI\u2019m going to start with the attributes I\u2019ve marked as the highest priority. I\nam my own measuring stick here and you can disagree if you like. But I\u2019m\ncoming at this exclusively from the position of a listener. Not a fiction\npodcast creator. Not a podcast-listening app developer. And not someone who\u2019s\ndeeply committed to a single app and cringes at the thought of moving my\nfollows/subscriptions from one app to another. That\u2019s not an issue for me, and\nI love change!\n\n### Respect the >serial< tag\n\nThe most important thing a podcast-listening app can do with it encounters a\nfiction podcast\u2014or any podcast, really\u2014is look for and respect the\n<itunes:type>serial</itunes:type> tag. \u201cNormal\u201d podcasts are typically\nepisodic, meaning each episode is more or less stand-alone, and there\u2019s no\nneed for a brand new listener of Geek News Central, for instance, to start\nlistening to the first episode of that long-running show, posted back in 2004.\nStarting to listen to that show from the most recent episode is fine, so\nthat\u2019s what podcast-listening apps present first. And, if the listener loves\nwhat Todd has to say, they can rifle through his back catalog of 1,700+\nepisodes at their leisure to learn about Zune, the demise of Google Reader, or\nwhatever cool tech Todd was talking about at any point in time over the last\n20 years. GNC is a great technology time capsule!\n\nBut a new listener who just discovered The White Vault is not going to have a\ngood time starting with the most recent episode of that fiction podcast. As of\nthis writing, the most recent episode is an episode drop for a different\nfiction podcast. But if the listening app used by that new listener respects\nthe <itunes:type>serial</itunes:type> tag, it knows to \u201cflip the feed\u201d,\npresenting the episodes from oldest to newest, not the other way around.\n\nBut, as you can see, less than half of the compared apps do this by default:\nApple Podcasts, Podverse, Pocket Casts, Podfriend, Spotify, Podbean, Amazon\nMusic, Podcast Guru, Goodpods, and iHeart. More than half do not, either not\nat all or hiding the ability to change the default sort order behavior by\ndigging around inside the app\u2019s settings just to get the episodes to sort\nproperly. And while I\u2019m a huge fan of giving users extreme flexibility, not\nrespecting the creator-set feed type by default is reducing flexibility, not\nenhancing it.\n\n### Group episodes by Season Number\n\nIf \u201cflipping\u201d the feed so the first episode appears in the app first is a no-\nbrainer, then using the <itunes:season> or <podcast:season> tag to group\nepisodes of a season together is the next obvious great idea. Using The White\nVault again as our example, the six seasons (currently) of that show can be\ncollected together inside the podcast-listening app, allowing listeners to\neasily \u201cjump ahead\u201d to skip the seasons they\u2019ve already listened to. (Or,\nsadly, as it\u2019s most often implemented today, \u201cjump back\u201d to previous seasons\nif the entire show is brand new to them.)\n\nWithout that season-level grouping, navigating multiple seasons is\nsignificantly more challenging. And given that many fiction podcasters often\nmake drastically different content from season to season, often with a new\ndescription and even artwork, those groupings will become more important.\n\nNota bene: There is no current support for things like season-specific show\ntitles, descriptions, or artwork within the RSS spec. But I\u2019m optimistic that\nwon\u2019t always be the case.\n\nSix of the compared podcast-listening apps group episodes by Season Number:\nApple Podcasts, Podverse, Pocket Casts, Podfriend, Amazon Music, and Goodpods.\nThe others simply list out every episode in the order it appears in the feed,\nwith no grouping at all.\n\n### Sort episodes by Episode Number\n\nGoing hand-in-hand with Season Number is the <itunes:episode> or\n<podcast:episode> tag. Rather than relying on publish date, feed order, or\nother inferred ways to sort episodes, this tag is an explicit sort order set\nby the creators for the main\u2014or \u201cFull\u201d, in podcast parlance\u2014episodes of a\nfiction podcast.\n\nConsider this common reality: a fiction podcast starts with a \u201cteaser\u201d episode\npublished well ahead of the first episode of the show. They then do that two\nmore times, building up some pre-launch buzz for the show. Then the actual,\n\u201cfor-reals\u201d Trailer episode drops, followed next week by the first full\nepisode of the show. Only that first Full episode would have a declared\nEpisode Number, and that number would be 1. However, if you were to count the\ntotal number of episodes in the feed at that point in time, you\u2019d find five.\nThat\u2019s correct. Only one of them\u2014the Full episode\u2014is numbered.\n\nThe creator keeps publishing full episodes until after the sixth episode is\nposted, when the sound designer is laid up in the hospital after a motorcycle\ncrash, forcing the creator to release a special \u201cwe\u2019re on an unscheduled\nbreak\u201d episode while the sound designer convalesces for a few weeks. That\u2019s a\nBonus episode, meaning it\u2019s not really part of the main story itself. So it\ngets no number. The RSS feed now has eleven episodes in it\u2014the four trailers\nand this Bonus episode, all unnumbered, and the six Full episodes, numbered\nsequentially 1\u20136.\n\nThe sound designer is much better a few weeks later, and production is once\nagain underway. But after the tenth episode of the story, the creator opts to\nrun an \u201cepisode drop\u201d, where they are plugging another show that they like\u2014or\nare paid to plug and say that they like. That episode is also not part of the\nstory flow, so it\u2019s another unnumbered Bonus episode. Our growing RSS feed now\nhas sixteen episodes, but only ten of them are numbered.\n\nAfter that, the final five Full episodes publish over the next few weeks. And,\nas a literal bonus, the creator decides to do a Q&A episode. Nifty, but also\nnot part of the main story, so that one is also unnumbered. Our RSS feed\u2014at\nleast for this first season\u2014now has four Trailers, three Bonus files, and\nfifteen Full episodes, for a total of twenty-two episodes.\n\nNow, those who were listening \u201clive\u201d as the episodes of the show were being\nreleased week-to-week would have been presented with each of those twenty-two\nepisodes as they were released. Regardless of how the episodes were tagged as\nthey were released\u2014Full, Bonus, Trailer, numbered or unnumbered\u2014listeners who\nwere \u201ccaught up\u201d would get each and every one of those. As it should be for\nthose listening to episodes at the same cadence the creator is releasing\nepisodes.\n\nBut what about the listener who discovers the show months or years after the\nseason finale or series conclusion was posted? Should they also have to listen\nto the three teasers, the official Trailer, six Full episodes, then the\nunscheduled break announcement, then the remaining five, and also the Q/A\nepisodes? In a word; no.\n\nA better experience is to present the Full episodes to the listener, and get\nthose non-story files\u2014those Trailers and Bonus episodes\u2014out of the way. They\nshould still be associated with the show and the season, but they don\u2019t need\nto be listened to in the order in which they were originally published. Below\nis a simple table of what I mean, comparing both ways.\n\nFig 2: Listening by feed order vs Episode Number order\n\nClearly, the experience on the right is the best experience for the brand-new\nlistener.\n\n(In the interest of fairness, there\u2019s a bit of hand-waving after Episode 15 on\nthe right side, as we podcasting doesn\u2019t have a good system to sort un-\nnumbered episodes. Chances are, those will actually be listed by publish date.\nBut from the point of view of the new listener, those are all optional\u2014and\nvery likely skippable\u2014episodes anyhow.)\n\nOnly two podcast-listening apps from the comparison chart do a good job of\nthis and actually help the new listener stay focused on the main story content\nby moving unnumbered Trailer and Bonus episodes out of the way: Apple Podcasts\nand Podverse. The rest rely on the order episodes appear in the feed,\nresulting in an unoptimized listening experience as demonstrated on the left\nside of the table above.\n\n### Displays Season and Episode number tags\n\nNot only are Season Numbers and Episode Numbers helpful for app developers to\nbetter organize the episodes of fiction podcasts in their apps, but they\u2019re\nquite helpful as visual cues for listeners, letting them feel comfortable that\nthe episode they are listening to is the correct episode they should be\nlistening to!\n\nFiction podcast creators are... creative, let\u2019s say, when it comes to how they\ntitle their episodes. And that\u2019s not from laziness. Some fiction podcast\nepisodes have distinct titles for the episodes of their shows. Some are\nrepurposing book content and wind up splitting up the contents of a \u201cchapter\u201d\nacross multiple episodes. Or even combining a small chapter with a longer one\nto make a single episode. Creative choice, for the win!\n\nIn a perfect world, the listening sequence of an episode would be completely\ndivorced from the title of the episode. We do not live in a perfect world. In\nthe case of The White Vault, the creators use titles like \u201cEpisode 5.08 :: Old\nFriends\u201d. But they also include Season Number and Episode Number tags, so\ntheir episodes are presented to listeners in Apple Podcasts thusly:\n\nFig 3: Duplicate season/episode numbers are possible\n\nNow, maybe you don\u2019t think that looks all that bad. While I don\u2019t disagree, it\ncan look a lot better. Here\u2019s one from a friend of mine\u2014and client\u2014Scott\nSigler, that shows how a properly titled and tagged episode will appear in\nApple Podcasts:\n\nFig 4: No dupes!\n\nNice and clean! Just the title of the episode, with the Season/Episode\nmetadata where it belongs\u2014out of the way!\n\nOnly three of the apps in our comparison chart do this: Apple Podcasts, Pocket\nCasts, and Podcast Republic. The rest don\u2019t bother.\n\n### Skips Trailers once following\n\nThis is the last of my highest-importance criteria, and it\u2019s one that is hard\nto appreciate unless you, like me, prefer to binge a show starting with Season\n1 and going until the series conclusion, if possible. Yes, that sometimes\nmeans dozens of hours of listening to the same show\u2014though spread out over a\nweek or so. I still gotta do real-world things!\n\nTrailers serve a singular purpose\u2014to entice a new person to listen to a show.\nOnce a person has followed the show in their preferred podcast listening apps,\ntrailers are no longer helpful to that listener. They\u2019re in. They\u2019re\nfollowing. They\u2019re listening. The hook has been set.\n\nForcing them to listen to or skip trailers for subsequent seasons isn\u2019t\nhelping anyone. It\u2019s a speed bump in their listening pleasure, and no one\nlikes driving over speed bumps. So the right thing to do is to not push\ntrailers after someone has subscribed. Easy, right?\n\nIf only. As you can see in the comparison chart, only three apps do this\ntoday: Apple Podcasts, Podverse, and Podfriend. The rest leave those speed\nbumps right where they are, impeding what could be a more seamless listening\nexperience.\n\nWe now turn to the medium-important attributes I feel a great fiction podcast-\nlistening app should have. These are elements that don\u2019t severely impact the\nlistening experience but, when missing, present challenges for enjoying more\nof the show than just the audio. That fact causes a lot of developers to care\na lot less about these things, and can\u2019t fault them for caring more about the\nactual experience of listening in their apps than anything else. But I care\nabout the overall listener experience, and these help with that. Let\u2019s dive\nin.\n\n### Description of show well formatted\n\nFiction podcasters are, by definition, creative people. With few exceptions,\nthey\u2019re also creative writers who are capable of writing excellent\ndescriptions of their shows. Compete with line breaks, links, and occasionally\nsome simple formatting, like bold or italic. The RSS spec allows for these\nlittle flairs and flourishes.\n\nBut far too many podcast-listening apps ignore special formatting of\ndescriptions altogether, causing what would have been a new paragraph to be\nshoved right next to the previous sentence, with no space. Links are mangled.\nText is truncated. It\u2019s... bad. It makes the creators look like they struggle\nwith basic sentence structure and formatting. Which is quite maddening, I\nassure you.\n\nThe apps that get this right\u2014if leaving well enough alone can be considered\n\u201cright\u201d\u2014are Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Podcast Guru, and Castbox. Spotify\ngets close but fails to add spacing after each paragraph, which looks weird.\nThough not as weird as YouTube Music\u2014recently-killed Google Podcast\u2019s\nreplacement\u2014which oddly chooses to center align the show description. That\u2019s\nreally weird.\n\n### Episode details well formatted\n\nEverything I wrote about the show description holds true for Episode details.\nOr, as they are called in podcast parlance, show notes. I hate that term. But\nI know how to pick my battles.\n\nOnly, this attribute is even more important for apps to get right. Because in-\napp episode details are the first place a listener turns to when they want to\nget more information about the episode. Or, quite likely, the podcaster\nthemselves told the listener to \u201cget more information in the episode details\nright here in your app!\u201d\n\nThe good news is that all but five of the apps in this comparison do an\nexcellent job of preserving the formatting of the episode details. Which ones\ndon\u2019t? Amazon Music, Goodpods, Player FM, Fountain, and YouTube Music.\n\n### Link to show website\n\nEvery fiction podcast has a website. Not always (or even often) a good\nwebsite, but there is a website. For every single show. And on those websites\nis often\u2014though, again, not always\u2014more information than what exists for the\nshow in the podcast listening apps. Things like a complete list of credits and\nbios. Contact information. Live tour dates. Fan artwork. Videos of the\nrecording process. And so much more. Best of all: that link to the website is\nembedded in the RSS feed that the listening apps are already using.\n\nAll the app developers have to do is make it available in their app. Listeners\nwill click through. Certainly not most, but some. If they are given that\noption.\n\nBut in most of the apps in this comparison study, listeners are not given that\noption. Only Apple Podcasts, Podfriend, Overcast, and Player FM allow for\nthis. Which is a shame.\n\n### Links to episode pages on show website\n\nAgain, everything I wrote in the above section holds true for the apps linking\nback to episode-specific pages on the show\u2019s website. And is, perhaps, even\nmore important than linking to the overall show website.\n\nThere\u2019s a limit to how much quality information a creator can put inside of\nin-app episode details\u2014\u201dshow notes.\u201d But there is virtually no limit on the\namount of information that can be added to a webpage, article, or blog post\nabout the episode. For fiction podcasters, that might be the performance\nscript of the episode. Or some episode-specific artwork. A detailed cast list\nfor just that episode. And a lot more.\n\nApple Podcasts, Podverse, and Spotify all facilitate an off-app click at the\nepisode level. But only those three. The rest? Nope.\n\n### One-click download: entire show\n\nThis has become less important as internet connectivity becomes more\nubiquitous. For many of us, it\u2019s rare when we\u2019re not connected to the\ninternet, either by wifi or our phone\u2019s mobile network.\n\nBut take it from this binge listener: dead spots happen, especially when\ntraveling. And traveling is one of the best times to binge fiction podcasts!\n\u201cSorry, this episode can\u2019t be accessed right now\u201d means my plans to listen to\nan 18-hour complete series are hosed. Boo!\n\nThe developers of Pocket Casts, Podbean, Podcast Republic, and Overcast all\nknow that making a one-click-to-download-it-all makes users who travel very,\nvery happy because they\u2019ll never have to rely on their network connectivity to\nkeep binge-listening. Sadly, the rest don\u2019t, assuming their user will just\nclick download on 50 podcast episode listings in the app, I guess? I\u2019ve done\nthat. It\u2019s rife with problems.\n\n### One-click download: entire season\n\nAs an extension to the section above, it\u2019s quite nice to have the option to\ndownload just the episodes of a particular season. If I only need the last two\nseasons of a six-season show, there\u2019s no need for me to fill up my phone\u2019s\nstorage with a few extra gigs of full seasons' worth of episodes I\u2019ve already\nheard.\n\nYeah... not a single app from the comparison list does this. Boo. First-mover\nopportunity right here, devs.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m on the topic of things that are nice to have but not mission-\ncritical in a fiction podcast listening app, here are two more:\n\n### Displays Episode artwork during playback\n\nAs mentioned previously, fiction podcasters are creative people, and many of\nthem either have or have access to creative design skills as well. I\u2019m blown\naway by the amazing episode-level artwork created for shows like Midst and The\nLove Talker.\n\nFortunately, the app I use to listen to fiction podcasts lets me see that\nepisode-level artwork as I\u2019m listening. In fact, most of the apps in this\ncomparison study do. But not Pocket Casts, Overcast, or Castro.\n\n### Recommends other fiction podcasts\n\nThe final item on my wish list would greatly benefit all fiction podcast\nlisteners, but I know it\u2019s probably among the hardest for developers to\nimplement. But it would be really, really nice if the apps recommended fiction\npodcasts to people who use their app to listen to fiction podcasts.\n\nProving my point as to the likely complexity of this: it\u2019s mostly the big\nmedia company apps that support this, namely Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and\nAmazon Music. Though Podbean and Player FM have figured it out, so maybe it\u2019s\nnot as difficult as I\u2019m imagining it to be. Or their suggestions to me when I\ntested this just happened to be fiction podcasts. Regardless, this would be\nnice.\n\nOf note: There\u2019s a new-ish RSS tag making the rounds, <podcast:podroll>, which\ncould help here. If not completely change how recommendations are made. It\u2019s\nhow creators add their own recommendations directly in their shows\u2019 RSS feeds.\nMore podcast hosting companies are supporting this Very Good Idea, and it\u2019s my\nhope that more podcast apps will start supporting them.\n\n## So... which app is the best for listening to fiction podcasts?\n\nAgain, it\u2019s Apple Podcasts. Which doesn\u2019t help Android users, I know. And it\nmay not be the app you currently use and love. I know you have plenty of\nreasons you\u2019re just begging to tell me about that demonstrate why your\nparticular favorite app is the best. Those are great reasons for you. I won\u2019t\nargue against them. Nor will I ever suggest that you change listening apps.\nThe fact that we listeners are not locked into a single app experience is one\nof the many things I love about podcasting.\n\nThis article, all 4,153 words, was written with the brand-new fiction podcast\nlistener in mind, helping them make the right choice for them. (And sure, to\ngive all the app developers who read it a different perspective on an\nunderserviced audience. It\u2019s a smaller audience, but a fiercely loyal one.)\n\nThanks for reading. Feel free to share this article with your favorite app\ndeveloper if you wish your preferred app would do better for your fiction\npodcast listing. I\u2019m rooting for you!\n\n\\- Evo\n\nNo items found.\n\n### More about my methodology\n\nTo keep the playing field nice and level, I tested all of these using a single\nfiction podcast from one of my clients, following (or subscribing) to that\nshow across all of the apps on my iPhone. I used the latest app builds as of\nthe time of my data collection, which took place on or about April 10, 2024.\nAt that time, the feed was properly tagged as serial and had a mix of numbered\nand unnumbered episodes across two current seasons.\n\nThe apps chosen for this test were based largely on popularity. I wanted to\nget the Big, the smaller-but-been-around-a-while, and some of the new podcast\napps. No, I didn\u2019t cover them all. But you too can do the same tests.\n\nI also didn\u2019t choose Apollo, the only podcast-listening app specifically\ndesigned for fiction podcasts. Apollo takes a more bespoke approach, relying\non a lot of human curation to get episodes listed better and the overall\nlistening experience more optimized. Because of this advantage, I opted not to\ninclude them in the comparison list.\n\nAs to the numbers/colors in the grid, a 0 means no problems found with the\napps adherence to the attribute. 1 is used (only twice) to indicate partial\nadherence, and a 2 is used when the app fails to adhere to the attribute. It\u2019s\nweird, but it\u2019s a working model I\u2019ve used for comparison charts for a couple\ndecades now.\n\nThe listener-focused directory that shines a light back on audio fiction shows\nafter they've reached the finale of a season or the conclusion of the series.\n\nThanks\u2014you're on the list!\n\nOops!
