I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as expected,\nthey\u2019re marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you probably don\u2019t\nwant a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in your new system, right?\n\nThe board I received is an early sample so any specific hardware\nspecifications such as the RAM and eMMC modules may differ slightly on future\nversions so do bear that in mind.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Photos of the ROCK 5 ITX\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX RK3588 & LPDRR5 DRAM\n\nAt the heart of the system, we have a Rockchip RK3588, joined by 2 4GB LPDDR5\nSK Hynix modules, though at present it seems that there\u2019s an issue with the\ncurrent boot BLOB meaning that in terms of latency, it\u2019s performing worse than\nLPDDR4X.\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX Front Panel Connectors, Audio, and USB\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX Rear I/O Connectors\n\nOver on the rear we have our DC 12V barrel jack input for power, USB-C, HDMI\nin, 2\u00d72.5GbE (with PoE available), 2x USB-A 2.0, 4x USB-A 3.0, 2 HDMI outputs,\n3.5mm microphone and headphone connections, and an SPDIF audio connection.\nThere\u2019s even a rear I/O shield which should be expected I guess but it\u2019s\nrather novel to me.\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX EDP, RTC, and SATA\n\nThose looking to use the ROCK 5 ITX as a NAS or storage/media server will\nenjoy having 4 SATA ports available directly on the board (no more\nquestionable M.2 to SATA converters!) which have power supplied by 4 adjacent\n4-pin power connectors.\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX 24-pin ATX Power\n\nOf the 3 options available for powering the ROCK 5 ITX, the ATX option is\nlikely the one that\u2019s a little different to what you\u2019re used to, at least on\nSBCs like this!\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX Power over Ethernet (PoE)\n\nHere we can see that the PoE module is not soldered in and connects using 8\npins which is quite nice. If you choose to power via PoE you can expect to get\n25W of output.\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX M.2 NVMe Mounting, Maskrom, CAM, TP, and LCD\n\nRadxa has been nice to us with the ROCK 5 ITX and has included mounting holes\nfor 2230, 2242, 2260, and the common 2280 NVMe drive sizes so you can use any\nof these with your new low-power ARM desktop!\n\nYou\u2019ll also note the Maskrom button, 2 camera connections, an LCD display\nconnection and your TP connector.\n\n### ROCK 5 ITX Packaging\n\nWhilst unfortunately, it took a bit of a battering at some point, I was very\npleasantly surprised to see that even at this point in development, there is\nan actual motherboard box available detailing the specifications and key\nproduct details.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHopefully, this whets your appetite a little for further content surrounding\nthe ROCK 5 ITX from both myself and other people in the community! I\u2019m also\nkeeping my fingers crossed that they work out the memory issues so that we can\nsee just how much faster the LPDDR5 used here will be as that was a key part\nof their marketing.\n\nIf you have any particular wishes for testing, or you want to see something\nelse, let me know in the comments, or via Twitter/Mastodon and I\u2019ll see what I\ncan do. Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to get my hands on a better camera for product\nphotos soon, too, sorry about that!\n\nRadxaSBCSingle Board Computers\n\n0 comment 0 FacebookTwitterRedditEmail\n\n##### Bret\n\nBret has worked with Raspberry Pi computers for almost 10 years now and in\nthat time he's benchmarked and tested over 30 Single Board computers.
