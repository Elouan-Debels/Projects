It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nHow to Optimize AI?\n\nWhich is most important for AI workloads: computational performance, cost or\nportability?\n\nComputational performance\n\nCost\n\nPortability\n\nNo preference\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nWhere are we at with WebAssembly adoption? Eighteen months ago, The New Stack\npublished an article asking what was holding Wasm back; just last month, 51%\nof respondents to a poll by The New Stack said they still have no personal\nexperience using WebAssembly. Two months ago, another of our polls found that\nwhile 23% have used WebAssembly at work, 42% said that although they don\u2019t use\nWebAssembly, they plan to when it matures.\n\nFor something that has been around for seven years \u2014 a substantial period of\ntime in the context of the software industry \u2014 it\u2019s strange that so many\npeople are still waiting to begin using it.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on? Is WebAssembly caught in a state of arrested development,\ncondemned to a perpetual adolescence? Or is it just a question of expectations\nand perspective, symptomatic of the way we\u2019ve all been taught the standard\nhype cycle process.\n\n## The Current State of Play in WebAssembly\n\n\u201cAdoption is slim but still on a slow and steady uptick,\u201d Oscar Spencer,\nDirector of Engineering at Suborbital, told The New Stack. Oscar is also the\nco-author of the Grain programming language and spoke to The New Stack for the\narticle mentioned above. In that, he expressed his disappointment at the\nAssemblyScript project withdrawing its support for WASI (WebAssembly System\nInterface), which was widely viewed as detrimental to adoption and something\nthat would lead to greater fragmentation in the Wasm ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Spencer is now confident that WebAssembly has moved past the problems\nof 2022. \u201cThe tooling is slowly getting better and developer confidence is\nslowly building,\u201d he says.\n\nTo a certain extent, the fragmentation that Spencer predicted in 2022 has come\nto pass \u2014 but rather than be a challenge, it has arguably been one of\nWebAssembly\u2019s strengths.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. Why WASI Preview 2 Makes WebAssembly Production Ready\n  2. WebAssembly in the Browser Matures and Cool Things Happen\n  3. Python and WebAssembly: Elevating Performance for Web Apps\n  4. KubeCon Europe: WebAssembly, eBPF Are Huge for Cloud Native\n  5. WebAssembly and Go: A Guide to Getting Started (Part 1)\n\nThis is a point made by Ben Titzer, one of the co-founders of WebAssembly.\n\u201cIt's been amazing to see it used in so many contexts by so many different\npeople,\u201d he said. \u201cI had expected an adoption trajectory to be more\ncentralized...in reality, it's spread a lot by word of mouth, by independent\nexperiments.\u201d\n\nSteve Manuel, co-founder and CEO of Dylibso, a software company that builds\ntools to help teams leverage Wasm, says that \u201cwe\u2019re still in the early days.\u201d\nHe sees the current state of play as one consisting mostly of \u201csystems\nengineers and compiler developers working on targeting Wasm.\u201d However, he\nviews \u201csignificant implementations at large companies\u201d \u2014 like Shopify, which\nused Wasm for its Functions product \u2014 as a sign that \u201cthere is a swell of\nadoption just around the corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery Shopify app developer is now re-tooling to work on this new product,\u201d\nhe added. \u201cWhether they know it or not [they] are deploying WebAssembly\nmodules to Shopify, disguised as apps on the platform.\u201d\n\n## Adoption Successes and Challenges\n\nTitzer says that as well as his surprise that the project hasn\u2019t really been\ndriven by central stewardship, he has also been surprised at \u201cthe gradual\nnature of existing languages targeting it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile obviously C/C++ and Rust came to the ecosystem early on, other\nlanguages seemed to slowly put a \u2018toe in the water\u2019, first having limited\nsupport and then gradually investing more as usage takes off.\u201d\n\nAs the founder of a company specifically developing tools to help engineers\nleverage WebAssembly, Manuel is in a great position to track and follow\nparticular adoption trends. \u201cOne interesting area of growth is the adoption in\nbusiness-critical, enterprise applications written in Java.\u201d he says. That\nmight sound surprising, but he explains that \u201cmany folks who lived through the\nearly wave of Java basically see Wasm as JVM 2.0.\u201d In practice, this means\n\u201cWasm being embedded in Java apps, largely using the Chicory runtime,\nprimarily built by Dylibso and Red Hat, specifically for Java users.\u201d\n\nAnother area where Manuel has seen success for WebAssembly is in helping\ndevelopers \u201cincorporate plugin systems into software applications.\u201d In other\nwords, \u201cenabling end users to write a customization for the software using a\nprogram \u2014 the plugin \u2014 compiled to WebAssembly.\u201d\n\n## Question Marks over Serverless?\n\nOne use case touted to be particularly appropriate for Wasm is serverless.\nLast year an industry analyst told The New Stack that he believed WebAssembly\nhas the potential to tackle vendor-lock-in, one of the main weaknesses of\nserverless. Meanwhile, our analysis of Scott Logic\u2019s State of WebAssembly 2023\nreport found that serverless WebAssembly use cases are on the decline, going\nfrom 36% of respondents in 2022 to 13% in 2023 (probably because the newer\nsurvey question differentiated between backend services and other serverless\nofferings, like vendor-centric Functions as a Service).\n\nManuel believes there are some challenges in this area.\n\n\u201cThe adoption cycle just may take longer here as teams are forced to re-tool\nand re-skill, after having likely recently done so to adopt containers and\nKubernetes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are efforts to bring Wasm to Kubernetes in a more\nstreamlined fashion, but these are very recent.\u201d\n\n## What Will Drive the Future of Wasm?\n\nWasm can ultimately be applied in just about any field. Indeed, Manuel notes\nthat he is confident that it's going to have a part to play in the future of\nLLMs and AI, given its ability to be used \u201cas a secure and portable runtime\u201d\nfor such workloads.\n\nThere are a few key things that are going to drive WebAssembly adoption in the\nmonths and years to come.\n\nWASI is undeniably important. With version 0.2 widely hailed by those in the\nWebAssembly community as a milestone, stabilizing fundamental parts of the\nWebAssembly\u2019s design and ecosystem, it provides developers with an easier way\nto use the technology.\n\n\u201cWASI preview two is a checkpoint of stable interfaces,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe\ninstability of preview one, [which] may have scared or prevented you from\nusing Wasm in production, is now past us.\u201d\n\nTitzer also acknowledges the importance of WASI to the WebAssembly ecosystem.\n\u201cIt represents a great opportunity to have a well-thought-out platform with\nexcellent security properties from the beginning, as well as wide\ndeployments.\u201d However, he notes that it isn\u2019t that straightforward. \u201cDesigning\nhigh-level APIs that are cross-language and cross-platform is an example of a\n\u2018wicked problem\u2019 in software. The WebAssembly community will have to work hard\nto stick to proper layering to avoid pitfalls that others have fallen in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that both Titzer and Spencer see what lies beneath WASI as\neven more exciting. Maybe it\u2019s not that surprising given their relationship to\nWebAssembly, but it nevertheless highlights that what\u2019s important about\nWebAssembly isn\u2019t reaching a plateau where it will finally make sense to\neveryone, but instead its capacity for new permutations and constant\nreimaginings.\n\n\u201cCore WebAssembly \u2014 the instruction set design \u2014 is a layer below WASI that\nwill see adoption in contexts we have not yet dreamed of,\u201d Titzer said. For\nSpencer, meanwhile, although WASI may have a more \u201cimmediate impact\u201d for\ndevelopers, it\u2019s the Component Model \u2014 the architectural instructions that\nunderpin Wasm\u2019s interoperability \u2014 where the real value lies: \u201cLonger-term,\nthe ease that comes from the Component Model will be what makes Wasm take\noff.\u201d\n\nAnother important facet to consider when it comes to Wasm adoption is new\nlanguages that enable compatibility with it. Although it might be the case\nthat this has been somewhat \u201cgradual,\u201d as Titzer puts it, Manuel notes that\nlanguages are catching up with Rust in terms of their support for WebAssembly.\nHe notes, for example, that Go recently added support for WASI and that it\n\u201ccan compile to Wasm to target virtually any Wasm runtime,\u201d and also mentions\nnewer languages like Zig. \u201cZig\u2019s explicit memory management [...] shines where\nit provides a very handy allocator specifically tuned for Wasm\u2019s memory\nmodel,\u201d he said. \u201cPrograms that are written in Zig perform very well compiled\nto Wasm.\u201d\n\n## Is Wasm Telling a Clear Story?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that one of the issues for WebAssembly is its ability to tell a\nclear story about itself. With something like Docker, for example, it was\nstraightforward: it made it easy to build and run small component parts of a\nsystem or application inside containers.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t a good story about WebAssembly; it\u2019s more that\ntelling one that makes sense to everyone is tricky.\n\n\u201cCommunicating the core idea of WebAssembly is made both easier and harder by\nhaving a hot new thing it can do today,\u201d Titzer said. \u201cThat external value\nstory is always going to be context-dependent because the translation of that\ninternal value to the use case is where external value appears.\u201d\n\nHe offers some examples: \u201cFor smart contracts, the story is \u2018deterministic,\nverifiably correct, and efficient execution targetable from mainstream\nlanguages\u2019... for embedded systems, it's \u2018weird CPUs look pretty much the same\nnow and you can't brick the device accidentally\u2019.\"\n\nManuel has a similar perspective to Titzer: \u201cWasm tells many compelling\nstories \u2014 that is both its weakness and its strength.\u201d He believes this might\nexplain why it hasn\u2019t taken off at pace. \u201cThis broad audience [for\nWebAssembly] means that it has cross-cutting impact, but it can be a slow\nburner as the impact is diluted, for now, across these areas.\u201d\n\nIn other words, WebAssembly adoption isn\u2019t as noticeable as we might expect\nbecause it\u2019s widely distributed, and spread across many domains and use cases.\n\n## Is It Just a Matter of Expectations?\n\nPerhaps, then, it\u2019s really a question of expectations. \u201cI hear lots of people\ntalk about what Wasm is or isn\u2019t, but to me, Wasm is a compiler target,\u201d\nSpencer says. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a compiler target with nice security and portability\ncharacteristics, but it\u2019s still just a compiler target. Replace every time you\nsay WebAssembly with x86 or ARM and see if it still makes sense.\u201d\n\nIn other words, when we talk about the adoption of WebAssembly we\u2019re expecting\nto see something when, in actual fact, its real value isn\u2019t necessarily\nvisible. \u201cAs a foundational technology, it is often not visible \u2014 or maybe not\neven important \u2014 that Wasm is being used under the hood,\u201d Titzer suggests.\n\nWith this in mind, maybe Wasm is mainstream. Spencer notes, for instance, that\nanyone who browses the web is likely to be interacting with WebAssembly on a\ndaily basis. But then again, maybe it hasn\u2019t: \u201cWasm has gone mainstream when\nwe all stop talking about it as much,\u201d he added.\n\nIndustry chatter aside, it\u2019s possible that we just need to appreciate that\nslow and steady wins the race. \u201cAs I told Luke [Wagner, WebAssembly co-\ncreator],\u201d Titzer recounts, \u201c\u2018taking over the world is a slow process, kind of\nlike mold growing on things. Be the mold.\u2019\"\n\nEditor's note: Additional statistics reporting for this post was contributed\nby Lawrence Hecht.\n\nRichard Gall is a writer and researcher based in the north east of England.
