As a technical co-founder, I've had my struggles\nwith anxiety. It's something that comes with the territory but isn't part of\nthe job description.\n\nIf we rewind back to 2017, it was not a pleasant year for me \u2014 my days\nconsisted of panic attacks, constant use of relaxing supplements, and trying\nto code while being severely under pressure with all the deadlines and new\nresponsibilities. During that time, I inherited the position of Head of IT\nfrom my predecessor. I was now in charge of a small team of developers, and\nour startup has made many promises to many partners. It was my job to make it\nhappen. I was either going to break or deliver. I did both.\n\nMental health issues still carry a bit of stigma with them. You cannot take a\nsick day by telling your team, \u201cI have mental issues and need a day off.\u201d Not\nmany people understand what panic attacks feel like and why would you need to\ntake a day off because of them? I understand those people completely. Right\nuntil the moment I had my burnout (or a mental breakdown), I didn\u2019t have any\nidea why you need to take drugs to manage your anxiety. I thought it was all\nin your head; can\u2019t you control your thoughts? Apparently, sometimes, you\ncan\u2019t.\n\nAuthor: Sow Ay\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed with anxiety, I didn\u2019t understand it, so I went to\nReddit to read similar stories of people all around the world dealing with the\nsame symptoms, trying to survive the same way I did. It calmed me down during\npanic episodes. Imagine sitting at your workplace, coding, and then a wave of\nprimal fear running through you, an all-enveloping sense of doom starts\nconsuming you, and you turn to Reddit to read stories about people\nexperiencing the same things. That was my coping mechanism. And it worked.\n\nMy story is, sadly, not unique. It\u2019s a story that any software engineer can\nrelate to. I was a perfectionist, a high-achiever who liked to have things\nunder control and in a specific way to ensure everything was running as\nefficiently as possible. I have my keyboard bindings set up just as I need\nthem, I have my dotfiles organized in a specific way, and I have my automation\nthat makes my life easier. I think most software developers are like that. We\nstrive to be efficient.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to have things under control when coding is the only thing that you\ndo, for example, at the junior level. You have a clearly defined task, which\nyour senior colleague refined based on some vague description that your\nproduct owner brought them. You debug it, have fun building things, get your\nnext task, and solve some bugs. You have zero worries; your only job now is to\nget better and learn. Life is good.\n\nAs you grow, you understand the realities of business. In business, there\u2019s no\nplace for perfection. There\u2019s no space for having everything under control. In\nfact, not only can\u2019t you influence most of the things around you, but most of\nthe things are uncertain. Thinking about your next month becomes a math\nproblem with probability variables.\n\n    \n    \n    \ud83e\udd78 An example of uncertainty in business is when your CEO tells you they promised a feature to your biggest client and it needs to be built ASAP as highest priority, so all hands on deck. Then a day later they tell you another feature, completely contradictory to the first one, needs to be built as well and is also highest priority. When you tell them they both can't be highest priority, the answer is: make it happen.\n\nThis was my perfect storm in 2017 \u2014 I was trying to control all of the\nuncertainty around me:\n\n  * Trying to control the looming unrealistic deadlines.\n  * Writing a lot of the code myself to ensure we uphold our promises to stakeholders and none of our developers burn out. Which led to me working more and sleeping less.\n  * Worrying about next month\u2019s payroll and trying to control our runway.\n  * Maintaining developer velocity and tight budgets, juggling future growth and current issues.\n  * Trying to control our developer turnover and making sure our juniors grow.\n  * There were days I'd be coding non-stop or in a series of back-to-back meetings, forgetting meals, sleeping, and even what it felt like to relax.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t one big thing that led to the burnout. It\u2019s more of a combination\nof factors contributing to my perpetual state of stress. (Side note: I\nremember waking up on the weekends, feeling great the first few minutes in my\nbed, and then anxiety taking over).\n\nEventually, I saw a doctor and am doing much better now. It took me a long\nwhile, though.\n\n## Not all deadlines are equal\n\nI\u2019m not going to philosophize about how you need to maintain a good work-life\nbalance and how not doing so may negatively impact your non-job-related\naspects of life. But I can tell you for a fact I did not have a good work-life\nbalance before. I think I\u2019m getting better, but it\u2019s only due to the fact that\nmy company is doing better \u2014 we have better cash flow, more loyal clients, and\na great team. Before that? I thought work-life balance was a myth. I thought\nevery deadline was sacred, every project was critical, and if you\u2019re not\nonline 24/7, it all fell apart. Was that true? It was, sometimes.\n\n    \n    \n    \ud83d\udca1 Some people asked me \u2014 why are you working so much? What\u2019s the worst that can happen? People not getting their salaries and the company going bankrupt. I think that\u2019s a big enough reason to risk burning out. At least, I thought it was. Now? Probably still is a good reason, but I would approach it differently.\n\nThis kind of situation isn't rare. You're always on edge, thinking the whole\ncompany's fate rests on your next move. It's like being in a constant state of\nalert, where slowing down feels like you're letting everyone down. As a CTO or\nany other tech leadership position, you're making calls that could either make\nor break the whole operation. And yeah, it's thrilling, but it's also a\nbreeding ground for anxiety.\n\nThis one time, for example, when our deployment crashed halfway through right\nbefore a major release. The CEO emphasized how important this project was, so\nwe were all hands on deck, trying to get it back up, fearing the worst, that\nthe client would go ballistic if he found out we were delaying the release. I\nwas stressing big time, thinking we had to pull off a miracle, and of course\nwe did.\n\nBut you know what? After all that chaos, it turned out the relevant\nstakeholders were away on vacation that week, and the release wasn't even\nchecked for many days after that. All that stress, the mad rush, and for what?\nWe often stress ourselves over deadlines as if they're set in stone. But are\nthey really? We push ourselves to the limit, thinking we're doing what's best\nfor the business. What if we just... didn't? Not all deadlines are equal. That\nrelease could've waited. That deadline was one we could\u2019ve let slip. Our\nhealth, our sanity, can't always take a backseat.\n\nDeadlines aren't created equal. Source: Monkeyuser.com\n\nIn tech, there's this unspoken rule that you've gotta be all in, all the time.\nBut that's just not sustainable. I've learned the hard way that not every\ndeadline is do-or-die. Sometimes, pushing a release back a week is the best\ncall you can make\u2014for you and your team.\n\n## What worked for me\n\nSo, as you might guess, I\u2019ve picked up a few tricks along the way that have\nseriously helped me out. I\u2019m not going to tell you I\u2019m an expert on mental\nhealth, and I\u2019m not going to be giving out advice. I just thought I'd share\nthe things that have helped me, just in case you find yourself in a similar\nboat.\n\nFirst off, anxiety and burnout are real, and they don't just go away on their\nown. I learned this the hard way. So, recognizing when you're starting to burn\nout or get anxious is crucial. For me, it was about noticing when I started to\ndread work I usually enjoyed and the random sense of apocalyptic doom or when\nmy sleep went sideways. I mean, I don\u2019t think anyone can miss those signs, but\nit took me half a year to recognize them and go to a psychotherapist. I\nthought I had the winter blues. Go figure...\n\nSaying \u201cNo\u201d to anything non-critical in your off time, as well as setting\nboundaries between work and the rest of your life. I\u2019m not very good at this\nyet, but I am learning to shut off after work hours. No reading emails, no\n\"quick checks\" on projects, no MacBook even. It's still challenging, but it\u2019s\ngetting better. Also, sometimes my partners call me on the weekends to do\nsomething; unless it\u2019s something critical, I tell them I will handle it on\nMonday. Trust me, the world won't end if you tell someone you\u2019ll do it 24 or\n48 hours later.\n\nI hope this doesn't become the norm. Source: Todoist\n\nI swapped my coffee for decaf and cut out alcohol. It wasn't easy, but it\nhelped me feel less jittery and sleep better. I also got into walking. I aim\nfor 12,500 steps a day, usually with a podcast in my ears. It's my new (old)\nobsession. The steps clear my head and get me out of the work mindset. Plus,\nhitting my step goal feels like a win every day.\n\nPutting things in perspective has been another big one for me. I always ask\nmyself, \"Will this matter in two years?\" You'd be surprised how often the\nanswer is no. It takes the edge off the pressure. I allow myself to miss a\ndeadline every now and then. As I mentioned above, not every deadline is do-\nor-die. Sometimes, it\u2019s entirely reasonable to push things back to worry less.\n\nNotifications on my phone? Almost all gone. If something's truly urgent, it'll\nfind its way to me. This alone has cut down on a lot of unnecessary stress.\nIt's like I've reclaimed my attention span. I don\u2019t get constant DING! DING!\n\nBut here's something I didn't expect to have such a big impact: educating\nmyself on mental health and emotional intelligence. Understanding that someone\nmight be fighting a battle I know nothing about made me a more empathetic\nleader and colleague. It's changed how I interact with my team. I've learned\nto listen more, assume less, and approach every situation with a bit more\nkindness and understanding. You never know when a little compassion during\nthose stressful times will help someone avoid burnout.\n\nWhen I felt overwhelmed, I didn\u2019t immediately seek professional help. I\nthought I could handle it myself; I was ashamed of going to a psychotherapist,\nas if my seeking help was admitting that I was broken. Since then, I\u2019ve\nunderstood many things. First of all, it\u2019s totally fine to be vulnerable. If\nyou're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to seek professional help. We\u2019re\nall human. There's no shame in it. In fact, it's one of the bravest things you\ncan do. We go to the doctor for a physical ailment; why should our mental\nhealth be any different?\n\nIn short, for me, it's been about making small, sustainable changes and being\nkinder to myself. It's not always easy, and I'm still learning, but these\nsteps have helped me find a healthier balance.\n\n## Our greatest asset\n\nYou've heard it before, but let me repeat it \u2014 our greatest asset isn't the\ncode we write. It's us. Our health, our minds, our ability to be present and\nenjoy life outside of the terminal window. Software Engineers and Tech co-\nfounders, like us, are more prone to hitting the lows. Depression doesn't care\nabout your GitHub stars or how scalable you managed to build your Kubernetes\nCluster.\n\nI've learned the hard way that not every problem at work is mine to solve. I\nused to take every customer issue personally, letting my stress levels hit the\nroof. But I've gotten better at recognizing what's within my control and\nwhat's not. Can't help a customer because of a time difference or because it's\noutside my expertise? That's okay. There's a team for that, and it's not all\non me.\n\nI\u2019ve been burnt out and stressed out, and it took a toll on my work, my\nrelationships, everything. Only after I finally started prioritizing my well-\nbeing did things change for the better. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s all rainbows and\nponies now, but things have changed. I became a better engineer, a better\nleader, a better friend, and a happier person than I was.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far \u2014 know that you\u2019re not alone. Things do get better. If\nyou're overwhelmed, ask for help; there\u2019s no shame. Find what makes you tick\noutside of work \u2014 be it with your family, a new hobby, or just chilling with\nyour pets \u2014 and give it the time it deserves.\n\nAny company that measures your worth by how quickly you burn out isn't worth\nyour time or talent. So, I will repeat it again: our greatest asset isn't the\ncode we write. It\u2019s us, alive, and living the life.\n\nUPDATE April 2024: If you prefer watching videos rather than reading, or if\nyou just want to see my face \u2014 I recorded a video version of this article.

I\u2019m struggling the same, one advise I had is not\ntaking personally anything that happens at work. We so often tend to prove\nthat we are who we want to be in eyes of others. In reality most often they\ndon\u2019t care...\n\nReply\n\n  * Anonymous\n\nApril 3, 2024 at 5:53 pm\n\nIf only all the CTOs / those in leaderships out there have the same mindset as\nyou, the software engineers world will become a much better place. \ud83e\udd79\n\nReply\n\n  * Greg Hall\n\nApril 2, 2024 at 1:13 pm\n\nA CEO that makes whatever promises they feel like without getting input about\nfeasibility and timelines does not respect what we do in the slightest, or the\ntime and planning it takes to do it. When you realize that\u2019s how the company\ndoes things, move on.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Vadim Kravcenko\n\nApril 2, 2024 at 1:49 pm\n\nIt does sound bad when you put it like this, but I wouldn\u2019t put it as black\nand white. There are scenarios where you need to make promises so the company\nsurvives, even if those promises have very sporty timelines and are hard to\npull off. I do agree though that this is best done after discussing with\neveryone involved.\n\nReply\n\n  * Anonymous\n\nApril 2, 2024 at 12:43 pm\n\nI\u2019ll be that guy. The fix for you (and me), sadly, was addressing alcohol,\nsleep and exercise. I think finding a hobby or series of non-work outlets is a\nalso a big help.\n\nI almost wish it was not that simple, because it\u2019s almost silly.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Vadim Kravcenko\n\nApril 2, 2024 at 12:50 pm\n\nThe advice does sound reasonable, my hobby was programming most of my life, I\ncode for work and code for fun, which probably doesn\u2019t help that much. I\u2019m\nalready in the process of finding hobbies outside of my digital life.\n\nReply\n\n  * Russ\n\nApril 2, 2024 at 9:17 am\n\nMy work/life has been one for 35 years because I\u2019m obsessed with\nsoftware/tech. It burnt me out in 2018 but I\u2019ve come back and cope with it\nbetter now. There are internal and external drivers. The external ones are\ntoxic people and companies who don\u2019t understand or care about effort/impact.\nYou need you leave this behind and find companies that understand (they ARE\nout there, thank goodness).\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Thanks for sharing\n\nReply\n\n  * Matteo\n\nApril 2, 2024 at 8:08 am\n\nBurnout hit me hard once, pushing through nights and weekends coding. I\nlearned to shut off work completely after hours, no exceptions. Discovering\nphotography as a hobby got my mind off screens and into the real world. These\nsteps made a huge difference in my well-being and efficiency at work.\n\nReply\n\n  * Anonymous\n\nApril 1, 2024 at 3:36 pm\n\nThanks for the article. For me, the turning point wasn\u2019t just talking about\nstress and understanding that I burned out. It was when I started treating my\njob like a job, not my whole life. I used to wrap my identity around my work.\nIf the code was bad, I was bad. If there was a mistake \u2014 it was my personal\nfault.That mindset was toxic.\n\nIn my case what helped \u2014 I picked up hobbies that had nothing to do with tech.\nStarted baking. You can\u2019t rush a loaf of bread; it takes time, patience. It\ntaught me there\u2019s a rhythm to life outside the constant push of updates and\ndeadlines.\n\nAlso, I stopped glorifying the grind. I work my hours, do my best, then log\noff. My laptop closes, and so does my workday. My world doesn\u2019t end if I\u2019m not\ncoding after hours. Life\u2019s too short to spend it all staring at a screen.\n\nSo, yeah, thanks for sparking the convo. Just wanted to share my two cents.\n\nReply\n\n  * Jake\n\nApril 1, 2024 at 11:18 am\n\nRead this and thought, \u2018Finally, someone gets it.\u2019 I started taking daily\nwalks to deal with panic, no phone, just me and my thoughts.
