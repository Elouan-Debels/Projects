Here\u2019s what happened.\n\nScience\n\nSep 20, 2018 1:40 PM EDT\n\nOne day in a lab, scientists gave MDMA to four octopuses. Do not try this at\nhome.\n\nAfter putting the eight-legged sea creatures in beakers filled with dissolved\necstasy, scientists learned that the octopuses, known for their anti-social\nbehavior, become more touchy-feely. This reaction suggests an evolutionary\nlink between humans and octopuses through their social behavior, the\nscientists said.\n\nThey reported their findings Thursday in Current Biology.\n\nOctopus intelligence rivals many mammals, and octopuses are the most\nbehaviorally advanced invertebrates. Octopuses can complete mazes and escape\nfrom aquariums, but scientists previously believed that these cephalopods lack\nthe social behaviors that often come in species with greater smarts.\n\nBut the new study shows octopuses can exhibit similar social behaviors as\nhumans with a little push from ecstasy, despite drastic differences in their\nbrains. If combined in the future with gene sequencing, the research may\nreveal the evolution of social behavior across species.\n\nHumans and octopuses diverged evolutionarily 500 million years ago, and a lot\nhas changed since. Besides the obvious additional limbs, or tentacles, lack of\nspine and affinity for water, octopuses have vastly different central nervous\nsystems compared to humans. For one, octopuses grow most their nerve cells\n(neurons) in their arms, and as a result, can taste and touch things without\ntheir brains being involved.\n\nThen in 2015, marine biologist Eric Edsinger co-discovered a surprising\ngenetic connection between octopuses and humans. Genetic sequencing revealed\nthat octopuses and humans share a nearly identical serotonin transporter, a\nprotein that moves the chemical messenger serotonin between neurons.\n\nSerotonin transporters also mediate the psychological changes associated with\ntaking ecstasy.\n\n\u201cWe were interested in the serotonin transporter because we knew that [it was]\nthe principle binding site of MDMA,\u201d said Gul Dolen, a neuroscientist at Johns\nHopkins University who co-authored today\u2019s study with Edsinger. \u201cIf we focused\nin on the parts of the protein that are really important for serotonin\nbinding, then the similarity [between humans and octopuses] was over 95\npercent.\u201d\n\nA portrait of the Two-spotted Octopus, Octopus bimaculoides, in the Sea of\nCortez near Baja California, Mexico.

They gathered nine octopuses of\nthe species Octopus bimaculoides, exposed four of the invertebrates to MDMA\nand watched if they became more social. They compared the behaviors of these\ndrugged subjects to five sober octopuses.\n\nIn the wild, Octopus bimaculoides is only friendly for brief periods of time\nwhile mating. Unlike humans, lab mice and other mammals, octopuses lack a\nnucleus accumbens, any folded cortex whatsoever and reward circuits \u2014 parts of\nthe brain associated with behavioral changes from drug use.\n\nMolly seemed to change their behavior during testing. When a tripped-out\noctopus interacted with its caged counterpart, its caresses appeared to be\nmore exploratory rather than aggressive. This observation mirrors the human\nbehavior of becoming more social and touchy-feely after taking ecstasy.\n\nThe cephalopods\u2019 unexpected reactions to the drug shocked scientists, who\ndidn\u2019t expect such a shift in behavior.\n\n\u201cI found it incredibly fascinating. It fits in very nicely with a growing idea\nthat there are lots of genetic mechanisms for social behaviors that are\nconserved across the animal kingdom,\u201d said Robert Meisel, a neuroscientist at\nthe University of Minnesota who was not involved with the study. \u201cYou will\nhave animals that tend to live in isolation, and by something so simple as\naltering a chemical in the nervous system, you can change the behavior.\u201d\n\nLeft: This normally asocial octopus became touchy-feely after a dose of\necstasy.
