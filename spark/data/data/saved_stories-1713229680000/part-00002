We need\n_community built software_ -- free and open source licenses are just one\naspect of that.\n\nIf a company requires you to assign copyright (or equivalent re-licensing\nrights) in an asymmetrical way, they will inevitably eventually decide to take\nthat option once they want to cash in on the goodwill you've built for them\n(let alone the code).\n\nWilliam Johnston @wjohnston@mastodon.social\n\n@mattdm My understanding is that Redis didn't do copyright assignment, but\nrather just used such an open license that they could essentially fork the\nproject with a new license. Is the main issue here actually that we need \"Free\nSoftware\" licenses rather than \"Open Source\" licenses like BSD? Or am I\nmisunderstanding here?\n\nMar 21, 2024, 02:32 PM\u00b7\u00b7Web\n\n1boost\u00b73favorites\n\nMar 21\n\nMatthew Miller @mattdm@hachyderm.io\n\n@wjohnston\n\nhttps://redis.com/legal/redis-software-grant-and-contributor-license-\nagreement/\n\nIt _is_ better / more fair when a permissive license is involved, because\ngenerally at least anyone else could do something similar -- it's not so much\na _limited_ privilege. The typical form of this tends to instead use a \"scary\"\ncopyleft license -- AGPL or GPL 3.0.\n\nRedisRedis Software Grant and Contributor License Agreement | RedisRedis Software Grant and Contributor License Agreement for Redis Inc.\n\nMar 23 *\n\nJean-Baptiste \"JBQ\" Qu\u00e9ru @jbqueru@fosstodon.org\n\n@wjohnston @mattdm My primitive understanding in a nutshell:\n\n-Open Source and Free Software guarantee that you can use/modify/distribute the source code you get, and that you can get source code as Open Source for the software that you use.\n\n-Copyleft guarantees that any future versions (including forks) of the software will be Free Software.\n\n(Edited to merge Open Source and Free Software thanks to @wolf480pl's inputs\nlater in the thread - I had made a major mistake).\n\nMar 29\n\nWolf480pl @wolf480pl@mstdn.io\n\n@jbqueru @wjohnston @mattdm Open Source also stipulates that if you get a\nprogram, you should get source code too.\n\n> The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source\n> code as well as compiled form.
