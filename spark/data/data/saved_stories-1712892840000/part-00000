The M4 chip will be focused on improving\nperformance for artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nLast year, Apple introduced the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips all at once in\nOctober, so it's possible we could see the M4 lineup come during the same time\nframe. Gurman says that the entire Mac lineup is slated to get the M4 across\nlate 2024 and early 2025.\n\nThe iMac, low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch\nMacBook Pro, and Mac mini machines will be updated with M4 chips first,\nfollowed by the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models in spring 2025, the Mac\nStudio in mid-2025, and the Mac Pro later in 2025.\n\nApple is said to be nearing production of the M4 processor, and it is expected\nto come in at least three main varieties. Chips are codenamed Donan for the\nlow-end, Brava for the mid-tier, and Hidra for the top-end. The Donan chip\nwill be used in the entry-level MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air machines, and the\nlow-end Mac mini, and the Brava chips will be used in the higher-end MacBook\nPro and the higher-end Mac mini.\n\nThe Hidra chip is designed for the Mac Pro, which suggests it is an \"Ultra\" or\n\"Extreme\" tier chip. As for the Mac Studio, Apple is testing versions with an\nunreleased M3-era chip and a variation of the M4 Brava processor that would\npresumably be higher tier than the M4 Pro and M4 Max \"Brava\" chips.\n\nM4 versions of the Mac desktops could support as much as 512GB Unified Memory,\nwhich would be a marked jump over the current 192GB limit.\n\nThe M4 chips will be built on the same 3-nanometer process as the M3 chips,\nbut Apple supplier TSMC will likely use an improved version of the 3nm process\nfor boosts in performance and power efficiency. Apple also plans to add a much\nimproved Neural Engine that has an increased number of cores for AI tasks.\n\nRelated Roundups: iMac, Mac Pro, Mac mini, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 14 & 16\" ,\nMac Studio\n\nTags: Bloomberg, Mark Gurman\n\nBuyer's Guide: iMac (Buy Now), Mac Pro (Neutral), Mac Mini (Neutral), 13\"\nMacBook Air (Buy Now), 14\" & 16\" MacBook Pro (Neutral), Mac Studio (Caution),\n15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)\n\nRelated Forums: iMac, Mac Pro, Mac mini, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Studio\n\n[ 214 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nJohnRckr\n\n6 hours ago at 10:12 am\n\nNow it's going to be AI everything because they don't know what else to market\n:/\n\nScore: 42 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nsw1tcher\n\n6 hours ago at 10:15 am\n\n> M4 versions of the Mac desktops could support as much as 512GB Unified\n> Memory, which would be a marked jump over the current 192GB limit,...\n\nbut the iMac and Mac mini will still start with 8GB memory\n\nScore: 33 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nAnaxarxes\n\n5 hours ago at 10:17 am\n\n> Will the next MacBook Pro get a redesign it\u2019s had 3 generations with the\n> same look\n\nWhy?
