Analyzing data from the CDC\u2019s 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System, researchers found that recreational users had 96% lower\nodds of reporting SCD compared to non-users.\n\nThis intriguing finding suggests potential protective effects of cannabis on\ncognition, although the study\u2019s authors emphasize the need for longitudinal\nresearch to understand the long-term impacts. Despite its limitations, the\nstudy contributes to the evolving conversation around cannabis use and\ncognitive health, highlighting the importance of differentiating between\nmedical and recreational use in research.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. Recreational cannabis use was associated with a significantly lower risk of subjective cognitive decline in adults over 45.\n  2. The study is unique in its examination of cannabis use\u2019s type, frequency, and method, focusing on an older population.\n  3. There was no significant difference in the odds of SCD related to cannabis consumption frequency and method, suggesting the potential role of THC content in protective effects against cognitive decline.\n\nSource: Bentham Science Publishers\n\nA new study by Upstate Medical University researchers shows that recreational\ncannabis use may offer protection against cognitive decline.\n\nThe study, done by Master of Public Health (MPH) student Zhi Chen and\nProfessor Roger Wong, Ph.D., MPH, MSW, analyzed a large data set from the CDC\nand found that compared to non-users, non-medical cannabis use, such as for\nrecreational purposes, was significantly associated with 96 percent decreased\nodds of subjective cognitive decline (SCD).\n\nWong said he was surprised that mode and frequency had no bearing on SCD since\nother studies involving younger participants found a negative connection\nbetween brain health and cannabis use, indicating perhaps that the age of the\nparticipants plays a role in the different results. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nMedical and dual (medical and non-medical) use were also associated with\ndecreased odds of SCD, although not significant. Cannabis consumption\nfrequency and method were also not significantly associated with SCD.\n\nSCD is an important outcome of interest as prior research shows individuals\nwith SCD have a 2 times higher risk for dementia, which currently has no cure\nor definitive prevention approaches.\n\nWong said that previous studies have found negative associations between\ncannabis use and cognitive decline, so the results were surprising, though he\nis quick to point out the study had several limitations and that these results\nare just a snapshot of one year.\n\n\u201cThe main takeaway is that cannabis might be protective for our cognition, but\nit is really crucial to have longitudinal studies because this is just a\nsnapshot of 2021,\u201d said Wong, assistant professor Department of Public Health\n& Preventive Medicine.\n\n\u201cWe do not know if non-medical cannabis leads to better cognition or the other\nway around if those with better cognition are more likely to use non-medical\ncannabis.\n\n\u201cWe need longitudinal studies to see long term if non-medical cannabis use is\nprotecting our cognition over time. That\u2019s something we don\u2019t know yet, but\nthat research is hindered since cannabis remains illegal federally.\u201d\n\nData for this study was obtained from 4,744 U.S. adults aged 45 and older in\nthe 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). SCD was a self-\nreported increase in confusion or memory loss in the past year.\n\nOdds of SCD by cannabis use reason, frequency, and method were examined after\nimputing missing data, applying sampling weights, and adjusting for\nsociodemographic, health, and substance use factors.\n\nThe study differs from previous research in that it focuses on middle-aged and\nolder adults, and it uniquely considers the three facets of cannabis use: type\nof use (medical or non-medical), frequency of use, and mode of use (smoking,\nvaping, eating or dabbing).\n\n\u201cThe reason I think this study is so great is we looked at all the different\ndimensions of cannabis use,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we included all three is\na huge contribution to the research because I do not believe such a study has\nbeen done before.\u201d\n\nWong said he was surprised that mode and frequency had no bearing on SCD since\nother studies involving younger participants found a negative connection\nbetween brain health and cannabis use, indicating perhaps that the age of the\nparticipants plays a role in the different results.\n\nThe study, which was published in Current Alzheimer Research was Chen\u2019s final\nproject in the Advanced Biostatistics course in the MPH program taught by\nWong.\n\n\u201cI applied the knowledge and analytical skills learned from the courses in the\nPublic Health Methods concentration to this study,\u201d Chen said.\n\n\u201cDr. Wong guided me through the process, from formulating a research question\nto preparing a full manuscript. I feel fortunate to have incredible professors\nin our program who train us to become well-rounded public health professionals\nwith the skills for epidemiology and biostatistics work.\u201d\n\nThe authors did note some limitations with the study, including the inability\nto consider state-by-state cannabis regulations; thus, potential selection\nbias could arise if the population of certain states is either over or\nunderrepresented due to varying measures of cannabis use.\n\nStrengths of the study include using a national data set, which increases the\ngeneralizability of the findings. Wong said the difference in protection\nbetween medical and non-medical use comes down to the compounds that make up\ncannabis. Medical-grade cannabis has higher concentrations of CBD whereas non-\nmedical has higher concentrations of THC.\n\nNon-medical users often use cannabis to improve sleep and reduce stress. Poor\nsleep and chronic stress increase the risk for dementia so the protection in\nSCD could come from better sleep and stress relief that cannabis provides.\nMedical cannabis is used primarily for pain relief.\n\n\u201cBased on our findings, we don\u2019t see the CBD in medical cannabis being\nbeneficial for cognitive health,\u201d Wong said.\n\n## About this cannabis and dementia research news\n\nAuthor: Noman Akbar Source: Bentham Science Publishers Contact: Noman Akbar \u2013\nBentham Science Publishers Image: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Closed access. \u201cAssociation Between Cannabis Use and\nSubjective Cognitive Decline: Findings from the Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System (BRFSS)\u201d by Zhi Chen et al. Current Alzheimer\u2019s Research\n\nAbstract\n\nAssociation Between Cannabis Use and Subjective Cognitive Decline: Findings\nfrom the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)\n\nBackground: Cannabis consumption has rapidly increased in the United States\ndue to more states legalizing non-medical and medical use. There is limited\nresearch, however, investigating whether cannabis may be associated with\ncognitive function, particularly across multiple dimensions of cannabis use.\n\nObjective: The objective of this study was to examine whether cannabis\nconsumption reason, frequency, and method are associated with subjective\ncognitive decline (SCD).\n\nMethods: Data were obtained from 4,744 U.S. adults aged 45 and older in the\n2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). SCD was a self-\nreported increase in confusion or memory loss in the past year. Odds of SCD by\ncannabis use reason, frequency, and methods (e.g., smoke, eat, vaporize) were\nexamined using multiple logistic regression after imputing missing data,\napplying sampling weights, and adjusting for sociodemographic, health, and\nsubstance use covariates.\n\nResults: Compared to non-users, non-medical cannabis use was significantly\nassociated with 96% decreased odds of SCD (aOR=0.04, 95% CI=0.01-0.44, p<.01).\nMedical (aOR=0.46, 95% CI=0.06-3.61, p=.46) and dual medical and non-medical\nuse (aOR=0.30, 95% CI=0.03-2.92, p=.30) were also associated with decreased\nodds of SCD, although not significant. Cannabis consumption frequency and\nmethod were not significantly associated with SCD.\n\nConclusion: The reason for cannabis use, but not frequency and method, is\nassociated with SCD. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms\nthat may contribute to the observed associations between non-medical cannabis\nuse and decreased odds of SCD.\n\nTags\n\nAgingAlzheimer's diseaseBentham Science Publishersbrain\nresearchcannabisdementianeurobiologyNeurologyNeuroscience\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
