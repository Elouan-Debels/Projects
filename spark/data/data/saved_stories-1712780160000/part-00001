Still, every\nengineering team builds and rebuilds one piece: authorization, how you control\nwho has access to what in your app. We intend to change that.\n\nWe see a world where developers never roll their own authorization again, and\ninstead say, \"Just use Oso\" \u2013 the same way you might say, \"Oh, you should just\nuse Postgres for that.\" In doing so, we're creating the $25B+ authorization\nmarket.\n\n### Why Oso?\n\nWe have the lead \u2013 in traction, capital, and team.\n\n  * Traction: Oso is used by thousands of companies from startups to the Fortune 500, like Wayfair, Arc, Intercom, Visa, Oxide, and Codecademy.\n\n  * Capital: We're the best-capitalized, with 4+ years of runway from the world\u2019s best investors, including Sequoia, Felicis, and infrastructure entrepreneurs like Olivier Pomel (Founder, Datadog), Dev Ittycheria (CEO, MongoDB), Arman Dadgar (Founder, Hashicorp), Edith Harbaugh (Founder, LaunchDarkly), Guy Podjarny (Founder, Snyk), Paul Copplestone, (Founder, Supabase), Christina Cacioppo (Founder, Vanta), and Calvin French-Owen (Founder, Segment).\n\n  * Team: We've spent 3+ years going deep on the domain. We've met with thousands of engineering teams and know more about this problem than anyone. And we have two of the best developer go-to-market leaders on earth who have done it before at MongoDB and Snyk.\n\n### Why now?\n\nWe're at an inflection point. What it takes to get from where we are today to\na world where developers say \u201cJust use Oso\u201d is going to be different. And we\nsee that.\n\nThe opportunity is for you to join at this inflection point, in a role that\u2019s\nbigger and different than usual.\n\n## What you'll do\n\n  * Experiment, design, and build UIs, flows, features, and layers of abstraction that decrease the amount of work our users have to do. Lots of devex\n\n  * Expand use case coverage of our core authorization service\n\n  * Build and operate infrastructure for our highly available and low latency cloud service\n\nPlus, help build a company and community from the ground up by wearing other\nhats, including:\n\n  * Writing documentation and blog posts to excite and support new users\n\n  * Engaging with users through support channels (e.g., Slack) to help them with their problems\n\nHere are examples of things we've worked on:\n\n  * Built a visual policy builder for our declarative policy language, Polar\n\n  * Built an interactive debugger, called Explain, to help users understand why authorization requests succeed or fail\n\n  * Implemented incremental forward chaining to cache authorization responses for deeply nested recursive queries\n\n## Who you are\n\n  * You're ambitious. You want to win big. You can't stand to be around anything but execution at the highest level. You have an inner motor to move fast.\n\n  * You're an owner. You are accountable to results over the process. You see yourself not just as an engineer, but also as an owner of the company.\n\n  * You're resilient. Building a startup is not for the faint of heart. You see the challenges as not just normal, but actually desirable.\n\n  * You want to grow, and help others grow. You self-reflect often. You give feedback, and you seek it out.\n\n  * You prioritize the customer above all else. You want to understand our users' world and prioritize solving their authorization problems above everything else.\n\n## Requirements\n\n  * You have 4+ years of experience as a software engineer\n\n  * You have worked at a startup or in a similar environment\n\n  * You have worked on developer experience and/or user experience\n\n  * You can program at different levels of the stack \u2013 i.e., frontend and backend, web app to lower level systems\n\nThe starting salary for this role is between $100,000-$225,000/year plus\nequity. Your exact offer will vary based on a number of factors including\nexperience level, skillset, market location, and balancing internal equity\nrelative to peers at the company.\n\nA note on titles: We have no titles on our engineering team.
