Neither of these are \"more correct\" than the\nother - they're semantics.\n\n## Internalism\n\nUnder Internalism, intelligence is defined as occurring entirely within the\nbrain. Someone who has learned to takes notes and refer back to their notes is\nnot better (and may actually be worse) than someone who takes bad notes or no\nnotes at all, because the content of their notes is considered to be input\nfrom the senses. They aren't remembering anything - they're rediscovering it\nfrom physical cues.\n\nI am not well versed in internalist theory, so I can't provide any references\nto this. I find it to be a very intuitive definition of intelligence, though.\n\n## Externalism\n\nUnder Externalism (and especially under the Extended Mind Thesis),\nintelligence is a phenomenon that arises from a system containing more than\njust a brain. A system containing a person, a pen, and piece of paper is\nbetter at remembering information than a system with just the person,\ntherefore the former system can be said to have better memory.\n\nWhile this definition of intelligence seems tortured and unnatural, I think it\nis extremely pragmatic. If I want to get better at remembering things, the\nbest way to do that is to carry a notebook - which is a solution that an\nInternalist worldview rules out.\n\n## Applications to Artificial Intelligence\n\nUnder internalism, the only effect AI has on intelligence is that many skills\nare learned incompletely, because the brain can't perform them without also\nreceiving input from the AI (for example, asking it for reminders about how to\ndo things). Under this definition, AI almost certainly makes its users less\nproficient at many tasks.\n\nUnder externalism, the system of a person, a computer, and an AI program might\nbe more intelligent than the system containing only the person and the\ncomputer. When faced with a task, the person could ask the AI for suggestions.\nThe larger system (including the AI) will outperform the smaller system\n(without the AI) on many tasks.\n\n### Might AI still make people stupider, even under externalism?\n\nYes, but not for all tasks. AI is much better at seeming competent than it is\nat being competent in nearly every field, neither the human nor the AI can\naccurately gauge the AI's competencies. Thus, human+AI system will often\nattempt to let the AI solve every hard problem for it, with the human\nperforming cursory checks at most. For problems where the human's competency\nexceeds the AI's, this will result in the human+AI system performing worse\nthan the human alone.\n\nThis phenomenon is sometimes referred to as The Jagged Frontier.\n\n### Might AI still make people smarter, even under Internalism?\n\n(Based on a discussion in the comments; credit to Dubu for this argument).\n\nCognitive tools can also be used in an educational setting - for example,\nstudents work out math problems on paper, or write essays for their\ninstructors to evaluate. Even under an internalist definition, using cognitive\ntools in this way often leads to these students becoming more capable - a\nstudent who writes an essay on a topic (on paper, with a computer) will\ndevelop knowledge and the ability to reason about that topic (even without\npaper, without computer). Similarly, a student who uses the internet to\nresearch a topic will learn something about that topic which they can take\nwith them even when they are not seated at an internet-connected computer.\n\nIt is likely that some AI technology (either existing LLMs or a future\ncognitive tool) will end up being integrated into education in some way -\neither used by teachers to educate students more effectively, or used by\nstudents to study more effectively - resulting in greater student learning\neven in ways which do not make the students dependent on the tool. In this\nway, using AI likely will make those students more intelligent.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Mar 26 at 19:11\n\nanswered Mar 25 at 19:20\n\nTim CTim C\n\n36411 silver badge66 bronze badges\n\n16\n\n  * 3\n\n+1 For the OP, consider how even a blank book and a pencil can make a thinker\nmore capable.

Though why don't you take a step back and\nuse tech that we already have and which is maybe analog to that. So take\nsomething boring like: a calculator.\n\nWe know it's not really smart on it utilizes known algorithms, in fact you\nprobably learned variations of these algorithms yourself at school or at least\nyou were supposed to. Now it can greatly increase the skills of people who\ncan't for their lives do a calculation without messing up, but does that\nincrease in skill make make them more intelligent? Do people become more\nlikely to think oh I can feed that into my calculator and make use of that?\nMaybe I'm biased but I've not seen that. It's more or less the other way\naround people who were already inclined to make quantitative analysis and who\nwould have applied the algorithm now just phase out that part to a machine.\n\nBut by doing so the machine does the skill, so effectively they are losing a\nskill in favor of efficiency. So in a sense they become dumber? Like\npreviously you were the machine doing the thing, but in becoming the master of\nthe machine, actually means becoming it's slave as you are now just the person\nfeeding it information and relying on it's god like skills and it's\nbenevolence to serve you.\n\nSo the question of how skills and application of skills relate to knowledge,\ncapabilities, power and subservience in those relations and so on is likely\ngoing to be an interesting debate with the advance of new technology and\nwhether we gain new knowledge or whether we make ourselves obsolete and dumb\nuntil we can't even use our wisdom.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Mar 25 at 19:18\n\nhaxor789haxor789\n\n5,86377 silver badges2828 bronze badges\n\n3\n\n  * 1\n\nI keep thinking of a bulldozer, but it's late and the impression isn't\nresolving itself into a snarky comment, so maybe tomorrow...\n\n\u2013 Scott Rowe\n\nMar 27 at 3:34\n\n  * 1\n\nOk, augmented human here: I googled \"snarky comment about a bulldozer\" and got\na nsfw saying and this gem: \"The bulldozer and not the atomic bomb may turn\nout to be the most destructive invention of the 20th century.\" Not too bad.\nBut I came by my font of weird quotes honestly.

(At\nleast if we disregard the question of whether aliens exist anyway.) The thing\nabout tools though is that they always do one job very well, but they rarely\nwork for different problems. As the famous saying goes, the best screwdriver\nmakes a very poor hammer.\n\nHumans being creatures of habit, the \"old school\" generally also tend to look\ndown on new tools when they appear. Chefs looked down on electric whisks and\nmicrowaves when they first appeared. When I was at school in the 1980s, using\ncalculators was looked down on. These days, they're very much standard tools,\nand people are taught how to use those tools to do their work more\neffectively.\n\nAI engines are exactly the same. It's not really \"intelligent\" - it's just\ntrained on a particular dataset to pick out patterns. There are some things it\ncan do really well when it comes to pattern recognition, and it's just a\nmatter of using those tools effectively to do your job better.\n\nThe intelligence remains in the human using the tool, not the tool. It may\nallow less skilled people to do a better job, sure - but that doesn't make\nthem more intelligent. And the highest form of intelligence is selecting the\nright tool for the job in the first place.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Mar 26 at 11:14\n\nGrahamGraham\n\n2,1741111 silver badges1515 bronze badges\n\n3\n\n  * My experience with calculators at school is that students are taught how to use these tools, not so they can use the tools to do their work more effectively, but rather to avoid the sad pitfall of doing their work less effectively because of a badly-used tool.\n\n\u2013 Stef\n\nMar 26 at 20:45\n\n  * @Stef Well, there's always that too.

First, we need to\nunderstand the difference between using AI to boost intelligence and replacing\nhuman intelligence with AI. AI can process lots of information, do complex\nmath, and even be creative like humans. This can help people by giving them\naccess to lots of information quickly.\n\n## Human vs. AI\n\nAI is great at remembering things, gathering information, and doing many\nthings at once. But people bring imagination, gut feelings, and the ability to\nsolve new problems creatively. AI can beat humans at certain tasks, like\ngames, but it can't do everything people can, like understand feelings or\nsolve complex new problems.\n\n## Creativity and Smartness\n\nAI can make art like famous painters. Some argue that it's merely copying\npatterns, not demonstrating true creativity, despite its appearance of being\ncreative. AI based on how our brains work is making us better at stuff, like\ndoing boring tasks, and might improve our lives. This mix of AI and human\nsmarts means AI can boost our intelligence.\n\n## Limits of AI\n\nEven with all these advances, AI still needs human brains to get better and\ncan't do everything humans can, like understand feelings, consider various\nfactors, and make judgments based on human values, empathy, and experience. AI\nis good at tasks with lots of data, but humans are better at creative, deep-\nthinking stuff.\n\nIn short, AI improves our thinking with helpful tools. However, whether it\nmakes us more intelligent overall depends on how we use AI while also keeping\nour human skills sharp.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 1 hour ago\n\nNewOfferSeeNewOfferSee\n\n1\n\nNew contributor\n\nNewOfferSee is a new contributor to this site.
