and\n  * o Permitting pre-qualified or \"as-of-right\" construction, where developments conform to existing building and zoning approvals and don't require discretionary approval, for the federal housing design catalogue(opens in a new tab).\n\nAs for the timing of this new funding, provinces will have until Jan. 1, 2025\nto secure a deal with the federal government, while territories will have\nuntil April 1, 2025.\n\n\"If a province or territory does not secure an agreement by their respective\ndeadline, their funding allocation will be transferred to the municipal\nstream,\" reads the PMO release accompanying Trudeau's announcement.\n\nBeyond this new fund, Trudeau is also committing to top-up the existing $4\nbillion \"Housing Accelerator Fund\" with an additional $400 million which the\nfederal Liberals say will allow more municipalities to get in on the\ninitiative meant to reduce red tape and speed up new construction.\n\nTo date, nearly 180 agreements have been signed across Canada to fast-track\nmore than 750,000 new homes. The Liberals estimate the added funding will help\nspeed up the construction of 12,000 new homes over the next three years.\n\n  * The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\n\"This is how we'll address the shortage of housing options for Canadians. And\nthis is how we'll make it fairer for younger generations, who feel like\nthey're falling behind because housing costs are too high,\" Trudeau said.\n\"We're making a lot of progress cutting red tape to fast-track the\nconstruction of hundreds of thousands of homes, but we want to go even\nfaster.\"\n\nTrudeau also gave municipalities a head's up on Tuesday that, in order to\naccess long-term public transit money through a forthcoming new fund, they\nwill have to \"take action that will directly unlock housing supply.\"\n\nSpecifically, municipalities are being told to:\n\n  * Eradicate mandatory minimum parking requirements within 800 metres of a high-frequency transit line and allow high-density housing in this space instead;\n  * Allow high-density housing within 800 metres of post-secondary schools; and\n  * Complete a \"housing needs assessment\" for all communities with a population greater than 30,000.\n\nThe minority Liberals have been making housing affordability a key focus of\ntheir targeted spending plans over the last year, amid an ongoing housing\ncrunch and heightened political pressure to address the issue.\n\nIn the fall, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. estimated that in order to\nrestore affordability to the market, 3.5 million new housing units(opens in a\nnew tab) need to be built across the country by 2030\n\nHousing, including assistance for renters(opens in a new tab) and younger\nCanadians trying to enter the marker, is expected to once again be a core\nelement of the April 16 federal budget, which Trudeau and his team have been\ntrying to frame as focused on \"fairness.\"\n\nFraser said that in a few weeks he will be \"publishing a plan to address\nCanada's national housing crisis,\" which will include three pillars: building\nmore homes, supporting Canada's most vulnerable, and making it easier to rent\nor to buy a home.\n\n\"Between now and then we're going to be rolling out specific policies to\nhighlight how we're going to achieve this,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nFacing reporters' questions about promising yet another federal budget\ninitiative requiring premiers' buy-in, Trudeau said his government is\n\"stepping up\" because Canadians need more help than any one level of\njurisdiction is currently able to provide.\n\n  * Top real estate headlines, all in one place\n\n\"We're there to work to encourage provinces and municipalities to be as\nambitious as possible,\" the prime minister said.\n\n## How long for affordability impact?\n\nAs for how the federal government plans to finance what's expected to more\nthan one dozen pre-budget announcements, Trudeau said the Liberal spending\nplan balances fiscal responsibility with investing in Canadians, and that the\nfull costing will be made clear in the budget.\n\nAsked about the initial pushback from some provinces, Fraser said in an\ninterview on CTV News Channel's Power Play that provinces \"can choose to\nnegotiate or not negotiate\" but his hope is that \"by putting a federal\nincentive on the table, we're going to be able to make progress.\"\n\n\"I think it's premature to declare what an outcome may be,\" he said. \"The\nreason that we wanted to spell out the detail was not out of a sense of\npaternalism, but out of a need to move quickly to address the national housing\ncrisis.\"\n\nThe minister was also asked, but could not say specifically, when he thinks\nthe various housing measures in the works will start to make homes more\naffordable, saying it will depend on the market.\n\n\"The measures we've introduced are already starting to have an impact. Some of\nthem will take a few years ... but that's no excuse to delay beginning with\nthem,\" Fraser said, conceding that \"it may be the better part of a decade\"\nbefore a level of affordability comparable to those experienced by past\ngenerations is restored.\n\nIn statements reacting to the latest Liberal housing pledge, both the NDP and\nConservative housing critics expressed reservations about the tangible impact\nof Trudeau's plans.\n\nNDP MP Jenny Kwan said Canadians \"can't trust those who created this mess to\nfix it.\"\n\n\"Developers who recently bought off an affordable housing complex in Dartmouth\nhave served renoviction notices to about 1,000 tenants so they can jack up\nrent,\" she said. \"The Liberal government's efforts to build affordable homes\nhave not even offset the loss of affordable rental homes.\"\n\nConservative MP Scott Aitchison said the housing accelerator fund that the\nprime minister is now topping up, \"hasn't built a single home.\"\n\n\"Today's photo op won't result in building the homes Canadians need. Canadians\ncan't live in Liberal photo ops or announcements,\" Aitchison said.\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n\n1 / 1\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, centre, is flanked by Minister of Housing,\nInfrastructure and Communities Sean Fraser, left, and mayor of Halifax Mike\nSavage while making a housing announcement in Dartmouth, N.S. on Tuesday,\nApril 2, 2024.
