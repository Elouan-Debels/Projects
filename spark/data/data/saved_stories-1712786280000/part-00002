As users are visually\n> disconnected from the physical environment, interacting in an uncontrolled\n> space frequently leads to collisions and raises safety concerns. In my\n> thesis, I investigate this phenomenon which I define as the physical\n> breakdown in VR. The goal is to understand the reasons for physical\n> breakdowns, provide solutions, and explore future mechanisms that could\n> perpetuate safety risks. First, I explored the reasons for physical\n> breakdowns by investigating how people interact with the current VR safety\n> mechanism (e.g., Oculus Guardian). Results show one reason for breaking out\n> of the safety boundary is when interacting with large motions (e.g.,\n> swinging arms), the user does not have enough time to react although they\n> see the safety boundary. I proposed a solution, FingerMapper, that maps\n> small-scale finger motions onto virtual arms and hands to enable whole-body\n> virtual arm motions in VR to avoid physical breakdowns. To demonstrate\n> future safety risks, I explored the malicious use of perceptual\n> manipulations (e.g., redirection techniques) in VR, which could deliberately\n> create physical breakdowns without users noticing. Results indicate further\n> open challenges about the cognitive process of how users comprehend their\n> physical environment when they are blindfolded in VR.\n\nComments:| 5 pages, 4 figures, CHI EA '23, Doctoral Consortium  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.00025 [cs.HC]  \n(or arXiv:2404.00025v1 [cs.HC] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.00025arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| (CHI EA 2023) 1-5  \nRelated DOI:| https://doi.org/10.1145/3544549.3577064DOI(s) linking to related\nresources  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Wen-Jie Tseng [view email] [v1] Wed, 20 Mar 2024 18:03:54 UTC (818 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Understanding Physical Breakdowns in Virtual\nReality, by Wen-Jie Tseng\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.HC\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
