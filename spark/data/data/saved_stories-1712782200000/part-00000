(Source:\nSightline Institute/Flickr.)\n\nA bill to legalize certain forms of \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing statewide in my\nhome state of Minnesota appears dead in the legislature, according to a very\nthorough April 3rd article by MinnPost\u2019s Peter Callaghan. The bill would have\nbroadly required cities to allow more than one home on a lot in all\nresidential areas, often up to six. (Cities of over 5,000 people would have\nhad to legalize at least six housing types from a menu of options, including\ncottage courts, townhouses, duplexes, and small apartment buildings.) It also\nwould have required cities to develop an administrative review process for\napproving such homes as of right where they are legal, instead of subjecting\nthem to public hearings. There were some other provisions, including\nrestrictions on the use of architectural design requirements.\n\nThis means we won\u2019t be joining the ranks of Montana, Maine, Oregon, and\nCalifornia this year in passing bipartisan, statewide reform to single-family\nzoning rules, easing the regulatory lockdown that prevents cities and towns\nfrom addressing housing shortages.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. Really. There\u2019s a lot to cheer in what has already been a banner\nyear for land-use legislation at the state level. Perhaps more than anything,\nthe coalition assembled around this bill and related bills proves that the\npolitics of this issue have shifted in a dramatic and permanent way. We\u2019re not\ngoing back.\n\nThe legislative session is not over here in Minnesota. There\u2019s another bill\nstill alive and working its way through committees, sponsored by Rep. Alicia\nKozlowski of Duluth, to allow more multifamily housing in commercial\nareas\u2014echoing recent legislation in states including California. There is a\nbill that would exempt local comprehensive plans from bad-faith environmental\nlawsuits like the one that has caused the suspension of Minneapolis\u2019s\ngroundbreaking Minneapolis 2040 Plan.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s the People Over Parking Act, a brilliantly simple move\nto eliminate baseless parking mandates across the state. Strong Towns has\nvocally supported this bill.\n\nAll this, as I\u2019ve argued before, adds up to an impressive wave of policy\naction\u2014and there are similar waves occurring in places across North America.\nWe are in the middle of a sea change: the most dramatic rethinking in over\nhalf a century of the land-use principles adopted almost everywhere in the\nmid-20th century during the spread of rigid zoning across the U.S. and Canada.\nIt was a massive, radical, uncontrolled experiment, and its costs have become\nobvious.\n\nOur particular \u201cmissing middle\u201d bill here in Minnesota wasn\u2019t perfect. I\ncertainly haven\u2019t seen a perfect one yet. But it represents a basic reform\nthat every city, no matter how big or how small, should undertake. No\nneighborhood should be frozen in regulatory amber. Cities need to be living,\nadaptive things; the process that drives their gradual renewal over time is\nthe redevelopment or alteration of existing buildings to meet new needs. Prior\nto the radical zoning experiments of the suburban era, that always meant that,\nas a town grew, its core neighborhoods evolved: in general, they became\nincrementally taller, denser, and more intense. A place that people\ndemonstrably want to be must be able to respond to that feedback\u2014expressed\nthrough high prices and low vacancies\u2014by creating new homes for people.\n\nA few takeaways I have from watching the progress of this issue at the state\nlevel here:\n\n## 1\\. The coalition for this kind of reform is incredibly broad and deep.\n\nHousing is, truly, everybody\u2019s issue. As MinnPost\u2019s Callaghan describes, the\nsupporters of the \u201cmissing middle\u201d bill this session in Minnesota included\nhousing advocates (both institutional and grassroots organizations),\nhomebuilders, transit advocates, environmentalist groups like the Sierra Club,\norganized labor, faith-based and racial justice organizations. The bill, like\nmany others of its type in other states, enjoyed bipartisan support in the\nlegislature.\n\nThis issue cuts across normal political divides. I first observed the\nincredible coalitional politics that statewide land-use reform makes possible\nback in 2019, when Oregon passed a bill very similar to the one that just\nfailed in Minnesota. More recently, we\u2019ve seen the likes of GOP Montana\nGovernor Greg Gianforte and Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom find\ncommon cause on housing reforms.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t just happen magically. A lot of behind-the-scenes\nconvening work has gone into assembling these coalitions, in Minnesota as\nelsewhere, and in bringing disparate groups to the table in support. That\nworks means the issue of allowing more types of homes, in more places, in\norder to ease affordability burdens is one that\u2019s going to be back on the\nagenda next year, and the year after.\n\n## 2\\. The opposition is no longer defending single-family zoning on its face.\n\nThis is huge, in my opinion, as a sign of where the wind is blowing.\n\nThe biggest opposition came from cities and towns, and the statewide League of\nMinnesota Cities. Callaghan\u2019s piece in MinnPost, as well as a Star Tribune\nreport on the bill, cite some of these opposing views. The focus of the\nopposition is largely on the notion that the state would usurp local control\nfrom cities, and that cities were not consulted adequately or early enough in\nthe development of the legislation.\n\nOne objection raised repeatedly, including by the League of Cities, was that\nthe bill might force cities to allow development for which they do not have\nadequate infrastructure in place. The Star Tribune quotes Prior Lake (a\nMinneapolis exurb) Mayor Kirt Briggs in saying that mayors alerted legislators\nto the specter of \u201cinfrastructure that wouldn't be able to handle even a small\napartment building because city sewer and water pipes couldn't accommodate\nincreased capacity.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I am highly skeptical of this objection. Allowing, say,\nfourplexes in a single-family neighborhood does not mean that the actual\nresidential density of that neighborhood will quadruple or even double in any\nsort of near term. Demands on infrastructure are likely to grow very\ngradually. And if future infrastructure upgrades are needed, incremental\ninfill is precisely the thing that provides cities with the revenues to make\nthose upgrades viable, because in the near term, such infill largely consists\nof connecting new ratepayers to pipes that already exist, instead of building\ncostly new system expansions to accommodate greenfield development on the edge\nof town.\n\nIn any case, what is noteworthy to me in terms of the politics is the thing\nnot being said. No report I have read about this bill has quoted a local\nofficial outright stating that rental housing such as duplexes and small\napartment buildings is incompatible with single-family neighborhoods in their\ncommunity. I have seen almost no culture-warmongering about the supposed\ndownsides of urbanism or density, and very little dispute of the need for more\nhousing. I strongly suspect that, had this debate occurred 10 years ago, the\narguments being made publicly would look very different.\n\n## 3\\. Advice to local leaders: Get out ahead on this issue.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for the state to force your hand.\n\nZoning has long been a local issue, but it\u2019s one on which local governments\ntend to operate in lockstep. In many cases, large portions of the zoning codes\nof small cities and towns are literally copy-pasted from those of other\ncommunities. And it really is true that these codes\u2014whose dominant feature is\nthat most land in nearly every city is reserved exclusively for single-family\nhouses\u2014are failing all sorts of communities today. Local leaders are on the\nfront lines of this.\n\nSmall towns often have the worst housing crises, impeding their ability to\nretain a workforce, develop a more self-sufficient economy, or house an aging\npopulation. And today\u2019s suburbs are not your granddad\u2019s suburbs\u2014they are\ndealing with rapid demographic change and a set of housing needs more complex\nand varied than the Leave It to Beaver world of yesteryear might have implied.\nIt\u2019s noteworthy to me that both sponsors of this bill were suburban\nlegislators.\n\nIf you are in local government, you already know, or have the ability to know,\nwhat housing needs are poorly met in your community. Be the one to lead that\nconversation with your constituents. It will be difficult at times, but you\nhave the power to set the agenda and to shape the direction of zoning reform\n(and other policies to encourage incremental housing) in ways that have\nsubstantial local community buy-in.\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear that the statewide zoning reform movement (here in Minnesota,\nbut also in lots of other places) has legs. If you don\u2019t lead the conversation\nlocally, there\u2019s a very real chance that decisions are going to be made for\nyou.\n\n## 4\\. Advice to state legislators: Keep it simple and focused.\n\nThere is a lot of disagreement within the Strong Towns movement on the proper\nrole of state legislation in reforming local land use. Where I land is largely\nat the view that state policy should act as a set of guardrails. Guardrails\nare needed because local housing issues create an inherent collective action\nproblem: the incentives for NIMBYism are so strong that, in a region of many\nindividual cities, it very often becomes in each individual city\u2019s interest to\nkeep their zoning restrictive and expect their neighboring communities to\nshoulder the burden of housing a regional workforce.\n\nMy ideal state-level zoning reform would, in very simple terms, tell cities\nwhat they may not do with their local zoning. For example, they may not impose\nan arbitrary minimum lot size on development served by sewer and water. They\nmay not prohibit multifamily housing across entire neighborhoods. They may not\nimpose arbitrary parking minimums. They may not prohibit homeowners from\nadding an accessory cottage on their own property. They may not impose an\narbitrary, discretionary hearing on projects that are already legal to build.\nSo on and so forth. I really like Nolan Gray\u2019s list of six basic, focused\nzoning reforms that apply to essentially every type of community.\n\nOf the current slate of Minnesota bills, the one Strong Towns has supported\nenthusiastically is the People Over Parking Act, and in large part, I know\nthey were able to get there because it is an utterly simple \u201cguardrail\u201d bill.\n\nThe \u201cmissing middle\u201d bill was a little bit less so. And there\u2019s always the\ndanger that, in trying to pull together a coalition and satisfy different\nstakeholders, legislation becomes a bit of a grab bag and ceases to play the\nbasic \u201cguardrail\u201d function that is probably the right role of the state with\nregard to inherently local issues like land use. The more complex a bill\u2019s\nprovisions\u2014in this case, with regard to things like design requirements\u2014the\nmore room opens up for affected cities to raise reasonable objections. (Here\nis an example of early reasonable objections to Minnesota\u2019s missing-middle\nbill from a very pro-urbanist and pro-housing city council member I know and\nrespect.)\n\nThe best way to undercut the \u201cThis doesn\u2019t work in our local context!\u201d\nobjection is to be disciplined about legislating narrowly, focusing on things\nthat really do apply across nearly all contexts.\n\nFeatured\n\nDaniel Herriges\n\nDaniel Herriges has been a regular contributor to Strong Towns since 2015 and\nis also a founding member of the organization.
