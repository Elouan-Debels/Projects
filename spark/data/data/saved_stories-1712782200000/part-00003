It\u2019s been a while, but\nwe sure remember what a boon Local on the 8\u2019s was when getting ready for the\nday. Not having to wait for the low-information national forecast on the\nmorning shows or putting up with the antics of [Willard Scott] or [Al Roker]\nwas just icing on the cake.\n\nRecreating the retro look and feel of the Weather Channel experience is what\nthis 1990s-style weather feed is all about, and we have to say that [Mitchell\nScott] knocked it out of the park. Luckily, a lot of the heavy lifting was\ndone already thanks to the WeatherStar 4000+ emulator project, which renders\nforecasts using online weather APIs in the distinctive retro graphics The\nWeather Channel used back in the day. He combined the graphics with the\noriginal smooth jazz soundtracks that TWC used back then; they\u2019re online,\nbecause of course they are.\n\nTo really sell the look, [Mitchell] tracked down a period-correct Zenith TV\nwith a 9\u2032\u2032 CRT to display the feed from a Raspberry Pi 4\u2019s composite video\noutput. Why such a small screen? Easy. [Mitchell] wanted it on a shelf behind\nhim to be visible during videoconferences. It\u2019s a bit of a weird flex, but we\nrespect it. Getting the composite video output working was a bit of a chore,\nas was tricking the TV into starting up on channel 14 so the feed is instantly\nvisible.\n\nThe nostalgia is strong with this one, especially for weather geeks. For a\nmore in-depth look at how The Weather Channel brought those local forecasts to\ncable, make sure you check out how the WeatherStar box was reverse-engineered.\n\nThanks to [USA-RedDragon] for the tip.\n\nPosted in classic hacks, Software HacksTagged cable, crt, forecast, Local on\nthe 8s, modulator, raspberry pi, weather channel, zenith\n\n## 3 thoughts on \u201cGet Today\u2019s Forecast In Classic 90s Weather Channel Style\u201d\n\n  1.
