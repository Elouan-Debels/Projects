We have identified a plethora of a-type\n> rotational transitions with 3 \\leq J_\\text{up} \\leq 11 and K_\\text{a} \\leq 2\n> that belong to this species towards the Galactic Center G+0.693-0.027\n> molecular cloud, the only interstellar source showing the three\n> cyanomethanimine isomers (including the Z- and E- isomers of\n> C-cyanomethanimine, HNCHCN). We have derived a total column density for\n> H_2CNCN of (2.9\\, \\pm \\,0.1)\\times10^{12} cm^{-2}, which translates into a\n> total molecular abundance with respect to H_2 of (2.1\\, \\pm\n> \\,0.3)\\times10^{-11}. We have also revisited the previous detection of E-\n> and Z-HNCHCN, and found a total C/N-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio of\n> 31.8\\, \\pm \\,1.8 and a Z/E-HNCHCN ratio of 4.5\\, \\pm \\,0.2. While the latter\n> can be explained on the basis of thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical\n> kinetics are more likely responsible for the observed C/N-cyanomethanimine\n> abundance ratio, where the gas-phase reaction between methanimine (CH_2NH)\n> and the cyanogen radical (CN) arises as the primary formation route.\n\nComments:| 22 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 2 appendix - Accepted for\npublication in The Astrophysical Journal  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.03334 [astro-ph.GA]  \n(or arXiv:2404.03334v2 [astro-ph.GA] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.03334arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: David San Andr\u00e9s [view email] [v1] Thu, 4 Apr 2024 10:02:18 UTC (1,778\nKB) [v2] Tue, 9 Apr 2024 09:34:51 UTC (1,777 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled First detection in space of the high-energy\nisomer of cyanomethanimine: H2CNCN, by David San Andr\\'es (1) and 63 other\nauthors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nastro-ph.GA\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\nastro-ph\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
