It introduces\nmandatory measures for organisations to strengthen their digital operational\nresilience.\n\nThe full name is \u201cRegulation (EU) 2022/2554 of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of December 14 2022 on digital operational resilience for the\nfinancial sector and amending Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009, (EU) No 648/2012,\n(EU) No 600/2014, (EU) No 909/2014 and (EU) 2016/1011 (Text with EEA\nrelevance)\u201d.\n\nIn this article, we examine the essence of DORA, who it affects, and the\ncritical steps toward compliance, which will become necessary by 2025.\n\n## Key Points on EU DORA Regulation\n\n  * The European Union Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) from the three European supervisory authorities and the European Banking Authority aims to enhance financial entities\u2019 cybersecurity and ICT risk management within the EU, requiring them to implement detailed ICT risk frameworks and incident reporting protocols.\n\n  * DORA encompasses a wide range of financial institutions. It includes a clear timeline for implementation, with the operational requirement starting on January 17, 2025, and transition periods designed to facilitate phased compliance and readiness among entities.\n\n  * The objective remains to strengthen the operational resilience of critical ICT systems to support a sound EU financial system. European Council adopted DORA to ensure their financial systems can withstand and respond to security payment-related incidents and related ICT systems used by the financial sector.\n\n  * Under DORA, financial entities must conduct comprehensive risk management, systematic incident reporting, and regular operational resilience tests. At the same time, ESAs oversee compliance, enforce regulations, and support the management of ICT third-party risks.\n\n## Exploring the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) for the financial\nsector\n\nThe digital transformation has revolutionised the financial sector, with\nadvancements like crypto assets and digital finance strategies becoming\ncommonplace. However, these technological changes have also brought about new\nchallenges, with the industry becoming increasingly vulnerable to severe\noperational disruptions from ICT incidents.\n\nEnter DORA, the game-changer that seeks to fortify the EU financial sector\u2019s\ndigital resilience.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nDORA is the collaborative work of the relevant European Supervisory\nAuthorities (EBA, EIOPA, and ESMA \u2013 the ESAs). DORA enforces a rule upon\nfinancial entities to tackle cyber risk by creating a thorough ICT risk\nmanagement framework, including strategies, policies, procedures, protocols,\nand tools to mitigate ICT risks.\n\nDORA presents organised incident reporting protocols, necessitating financial\nentities covered to track, record, and report significant ICT incidents,\nthereby boosting operational resilience.\n\n### Understanding the Scope of DORA Legislation\n\nDORA\u2019s impact stretches over a wide array of financial and credit institutions\ntoo, encompassing:\n\n  * European securities firms\n\n  * Banks\n\n  * Fintechs\n\n  * European insurance\n\n  * Investment firms\n\n  * Other authorised European financial entities\n\nIts impact on financial services institutions is significant, shifting the\nfocus of these institutions from merely ensuring financial soundness to\nmaintaining resilient operations.\n\nIt also applies to e-money financial services, crypto asset service providers,\ncrowdfunding service providers or platforms and financial services firms.\n\nDORA presents particular requirements for financial market participants,\nboosting their defensive measures and preventing and detecting severe\noperational disruption risks. This ensures that the economic infrastructure is\nabout making profits and preparing for and overcoming potential disruptions.\n\n### DORA\u2019s Connection with Information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\nDORA\u2019s connection with ICT is like a knight\u2019s bond with their armour,\nproviding a protective shield against ICT-related threats. It imposes\nconsistent requirements on financial institutions and their critical ICT\nproviders, including provisions for:\n\n  * ICT risk management\n\n  * Incident reporting\n\n  * Operational resilience testing\n\n  * ICT third-party risk monitoring\n\nDORA necessitates that financial institutions uphold a robust ICT\ninfrastructure, considering the resilience of their operations and secure\nmanagement of ICT systems. This encompasses critically ICT-related risk\ndomains such as risk management, the security and continuity of the financial\nsystem and ICT systems, and financial entities\u2019 overall digital operational\nresilience.\n\nBy doing so, the Digital Operational Resilience Act equips the financial\nsector with the necessary armour to withstand ICT incidents and recover from\nsuch events, ensuring ongoing operational stability.\n\n## Timeline and Implementation of DORA Compliance\n\nShifting to a new regulatory framework can sometimes seem like steering\nthrough a maze. Fortunately, DORA provides a clear timeline for its\nimplementation. It was officially announced on January 16, 2023, and is\nscheduled to take effect on January 17, 2025. The transition period for\nentities to adhere to DORA requirements is also well-defined, providing a\nroadmap for a smooth journey to compliance.\n\n### Countdown to Compliance\n\nAt first sight, the countdown to DORA compliance might appear daunting.\nHowever, the journey becomes less daunting when broken down into manageable\nsteps. The process involves initiating ICT business impact analysis surveys,\nconducting business impact analyses and conducting qualitative and\nquantitative business assessments.\n\nIn the implementation period, financial institutions are expected to assess\ntheir organisation\u2019s scope, understand the five pillars of the Digital\nOperational Resilience Act, have comprehensive business continuity policies,\nand adhere to the 12 steps for DORA Act compliance. This responsibility\nextends to their suppliers, ensuring their business operations adhere to DORA\nregulations.\n\n### Transition Periods and Phases for the DORA framework to be in place\n\nAchieving DORA compliance is a prolonged journey, not a race, with transition\nperiods and phases permitting financial institutions to implement DORA\nrequirements progressively.\n\nThe transitions encompass the implementation phase starting on January 17,\n2025, and the development of draft regulatory technical standards by early\n2024.\n\nDuring the transition phase, financial institutions are expected to:\n\n  * Conduct comprehensive reviews of their governance arrangements, policies, controls, and risk assessment and mapping activities\n\n  * Ensure alignment with DORA requirements\n\n  * Reach significant milestones such as full compliance by January 2025.\n\n## The Pillars of DORA: Key Components Explained\n\nDORA rests on five pillars, each tackling varied aspects of ICT and\ncybersecurity. These pillars are the foundational blocks underpinning\nfinancial entities\u2019 operational resilience. They represent an all-encompassing\napproach to ICT risk management, encompassing:\n\n  * Strategies\n\n  * Policies\n\n  * Procedures\n\n  * Tools\n\nThese are aimed at minimising risk and safeguarding ICT assets.\n\nOperational resilience testing stands out as a critical component. Under DORA,\nentities must form and maintain a solid digital operational resilience testing\nprogram to guarantee their capability to proficiently handle and alleviate\nrisks associated with their ICT systems and services.\n\n### ICT Risk Management Essentials\n\nJust like a ship\u2019s captain steering through dangerous waters, financial\ninstitutions must manoeuvre the domain of ICT risk management. Establishing a\ncomprehensive risk management framework in ICT involves the development of:\n\n  * strategies\n\n  * policies\n\n  * procedures\n\n  * ICT protocols\n\n  * tools\n\nThese components aim to mitigate risks and ensure the security, stability, and\ncontinuity of ICT services across an organisation, including those offered by\ncloud service providers.\n\nThe core components of an ICT risk management framework encompass strategies,\nimpact minimisation tactics, protection and prevention measures, and response\n& recovery protocols, among others. Continuous risk assessment is executed\nthrough quantitative risk analysis models, supplemented by a constant risk\nmanagement strategy that continuously monitors threats and adapts to emerging\nrisks. Financial institutions are advised to prioritise robust cybersecurity\ntechnologies like firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems to\ncombat cyber threats effectively.\n\n### Incident Reporting Protocols\n\nIncident reporting is similar to a ship\u2019s log, recording any major ICT related\nincidents that threaten the security of the network and information systems.\nFinancial entities must systematically monitor, document, and report ICT\nincidents as part of their initiatives to enhance operational resilience.\n\nThe European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) are crucial in implementing\ntechnical standards and streamlining the incident reporting process. They are\ndeveloping a unified procedure for reporting significant cyber threats and\nincidents and have released preliminary Regulatory Technical Standards\nconcerning categorising major incidents and notable cyber threats.\n\nUnder DORA, incidents should be reported within four hours of classification\nor no later than 24 hours after detection.\n\n### Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) Testing Requirements\n\nTesting is vital to any journey, ensuring the ship is seaworthy and ready to\nface storms. DORA mandates financial institutions to conduct threat-led\npenetration tests every three years and carry out vulnerability assessments\nand scenario-based testing annually.\n\nPartnering with accredited providers like Cyphere can be a game-changer for\nfinancial institutions. Cyphere\u2019s CREST-accredited penetration testing\nincludes service quality-focused assessments, providing financial institutions\nwith actionable guidance that covers strategic and tactical risk remediations.\n\n## The Role of European Supervisory Authorities in DORA\n\nAs lighthouses safely direct ships to the shore, the European Supervisory\nAuthorities (ESAs) steer financial institutions towards DORA compliance. To\nensure compliance of payment institutions with DORA, they establish rules\ngoverning:\n\n  * ICT risk management\n\n  * Incident reporting\n\n  * Operational resilience testing\n\n  * ICT third-party risk monitoring\n\nThis same oversight framework is crucial to maintaining resilient ICT systems.\n\nThe ESAs possess specific authorities under DORA, including establishing rules\non ICT and third-party risk management and incident reporting. By offering\nearly advice and recommendations and ensuring they maintain resilient\noperations during severe operational challenges, ESA collaborated with\nfinancial institutions to enforce DORA.\n\n### Monitoring and Enforcement Actions\n\nThe ESAs supervise financial institutions\u2019 compliance with DORA regulations,\nsimilar to a watchtower monitoring a fortress. They have the authority, acting\nas markets authority and an occupational pensions authority, to implement\nenforcement measures, including the imposition of fines, to address non-\ncompliance by institutions under DORA.\n\nThe enforcement of DORA requirements commences 24 months after it enters into\nforce.\n\n### Collaborative Efforts for Enhanced Security\n\nCollaboration is the key to success, and this holds in the realm of digital\noperational resilience. The ESAs improve security under DORA by utilising\ncollaborative strategies, establishing a comprehensive framework on digital\noperational resilience, and promoting enhanced security measures.\n\nThrough collaborative endeavours, the ESAs facilitate digital finance strategy\nand the exchange of information with financial institutions. They develop\ntechnical standards and have formulated best practices, including integrating\ndigital resilience across all operational levels and reinforcing firms\u2019\nresilience to mitigate technology and cyber risk.\n\nThe cooperation between ESAs and financial institutions has improved security\nin the EU financial sector, facilitated by a stringent regulatory and\nsupervisory framework and guidance on risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n## Managing ICT Third-Party Risks Under DORA\n\nSteering through the sea of digital operational resilience entails managing\nICT third-party risks. DORA stipulates regulations regarding the following:\n\n  * ICT risk management\n\n  * Incident reporting\n\n  * Operational resilience testing\n\n  * ICT third-party risk management\n\nThrough the lens of DORA, managing ICT third-party risks is not an optional\nendeavour but a mandatory requirement for financial institutions. It enhances\nthe control of ICT risks and improves the resilience of financial\ninstitutions. DORA proposes the following measures for managing third-party\nICT risks:\n\n  * Maintain full responsibility for third-party ICT services\n\n  * Implement ICT risk-management\n\n  * Establish incident reporting procedures\n\n  * Conduct operational resilience testing\n\n  * Monitor ICT third-party risk\n\n### Due Diligence and Oversight Measures\n\nJust as a ship\u2019s captain must diligently oversee his crew, financial\ninstitutions must be diligent in managing third-party risks. This involves\nmaintaining a register of all agreements with third-party account information\nservice providers and instituting a thorough due diligence procedure for their\nassessment and designation.\n\nA comprehensive risk assessment encompasses using automated platforms to\nidentify, assess, manage, and continuously monitor third-party risks,\nincluding ICT service providers. Additionally, financial institutions must\ndetermine third-party compliance with pertinent information security\nstandards.\n\nDORA mandates financial entities to identify pertinent risks, ensure\noperational resilience, and notify competent authorities of significant ICT\nincidents.\n\n### Strategies for Maintaining Resilient Operations\n\nMaintaining resilient operations under DORA involves mapping dependencies,\nmanaging third-party risk, and ensuring that the relevant authorities directly\noversee critical providers.\n\nDORA offers guidelines for third-party risk management, which encompass:\n\n  * Utilisation of a Third-Party Risk Management Platform\n\n  * Issuance of regulations by ESAs for ICT and third-party risk management\n\n  * Establishment of a framework for overseeing critical ICT third-party service providers\n\n  * Supervisory authorities directly provide supervision\n\n## Navigating Compliance: Tools and Resources for Financial Institutions\n\nThe voyage to DORA compliance is a journey that financial institutions need\nnot embark upon alone. Various tools and resources can facilitate this\njourney, providing a compass to navigate the seas of compliance.\n\n### Gap Analysis and Readiness Checklists\n\nGap analysis and readiness checklists serve as nautical charts, clearly\nshowing an organisation\u2019s adherence to DORA requirements and identifying\ndiscrepancies. These checklists help institutions comprehend the necessary\nactions to achieve compliance and enhance cybersecurity standards.\n\nPerforming comprehensive gap assessments is akin to charting a map of the\nunknown, ensuring that every potential pitfall in the ICT landscape is\nidentified and addressed for DORA compliance.\n\n### Partnering with Cyphere for your DORA requirements\n\nSteering through the waters of DORA compliance can become more straightforward\nwith a trustworthy partner.
