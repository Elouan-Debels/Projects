CISA urged all Sisense customers\nto reset any credentials and secrets that may have been shared with the\ncompany, which is the same advice Sisense gave to its customers Wednesday\nevening.\n\nNew York City based Sisense has more than 1,000 customers across a range of\nindustry verticals, including financial services, telecommunications,\nhealthcare and higher education. On April 10, Sisense Chief Information\nSecurity Officer Sangram Dash told customers the company had been made aware\nof reports that \u201ccertain Sisense company information may have been made\navailable on what we have been advised is a restricted access server (not\ngenerally available on the internet.)\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are taking this matter seriously and promptly commenced an investigation,\u201d\nDash continued. \u201cWe engaged industry-leading experts to assist us with the\ninvestigation. This matter has not resulted in an interruption to our business\noperations. Out of an abundance of caution, and while we continue to\ninvestigate, we urge you to promptly rotate any credentials that you use\nwithin your Sisense application.\u201d\n\nIn its alert, CISA said it was working with private industry partners to\nrespond to a recent compromise discovered by independent security researchers\ninvolving Sisense.\n\n\u201cCISA is taking an active role in collaborating with private industry partners\nto respond to this incident, especially as it relates to impacted critical\ninfrastructure sector organizations,\u201d the sparse alert reads. \u201cWe will provide\nupdates as more information becomes available.\u201d\n\nSisense declined to comment when asked about the veracity of information\nshared by two trusted sources with close knowledge of the breach\ninvestigation. Those sources said the breach appears to have started when the\nattackers somehow gained access to the company\u2019s code repository at Gitlab,\nand that in that repository was a token or credential that gave the bad guys\naccess to Sisense\u2019s Amazon S3 buckets in the cloud.\n\nBoth sources said the attackers used the S3 access to copy and exfiltrate\nseveral terabytes worth of Sisense customer data, which apparently included\nmillions of access tokens, email account passwords, and even SSL certificates.\n\nThe incident raises questions about whether Sisense was doing enough to\nprotect sensitive data entrusted to it by customers, such as whether the\nmassive volume of stolen customer data was ever encrypted while at rest in\nthese Amazon cloud servers.\n\nIt is clear, however, that unknown attackers now have all of the credentials\nthat Sisense customers used in their dashboards.\n\nThe breach also makes clear that Sisense is somewhat limited in the clean-up\nactions that it can take on behalf of customers, because access tokens are\nessentially text files on your computer that allow you to stay logged in for\nextended periods of time \u2014 sometimes indefinitely. And depending on which\nservice we\u2019re talking about, it may be possible for attackers to re-use those\naccess tokens to authenticate as the victim without ever having to present\nvalid credentials.\n\nBeyond that, it is largely up to Sisense customers to decide if and when they\nchange passwords to the various third-party services that they\u2019ve previously\nentrusted to Sisense.\n\nEarlier today, a public relations firm working with Sisense reached out to\nlearn if KrebsOnSecurity planned to publish any further updates on their\nbreach (KrebsOnSecurity posted a screenshot of the CISO\u2019s customer email to\nboth LinkedIn and Mastodon on Wednesday evening). The PR rep said Sisense\nwanted to make sure they had an opportunity to comment before the story ran.\n\nBut when confronted with the details shared by my sources, Sisense apparently\nchanged its mind.\n\n\u201cAfter consulting with Sisense, they have told me that they don\u2019t wish to\nrespond,\u201d the PR rep said in an emailed reply.\n\nNicholas Weaver, a researcher at University of California, Berkeley\u2019s\nInternational Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and lecturer at UC Davis, said\na company entrusted with so many sensitive logins should absolutely be\nencrypting that information.\n\n\u201cIf they are hosting customer data on a third-party system like Amazon, it\nbetter damn well be encrypted,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIf they are telling people to\nreset credentials, that means it was not encrypted. So mistake number one is\nleaving Amazon credentials in your Git archive. Mistake number two is using S3\nwithout using encryption on top of it. The former is bad but forgivable, but\nthe latter given their business is unforgivable.\u201d\n\nThis entry was posted on Thursday 11th of April 2024 04:48 PM\n\nA Little Sunshine Data Breaches The Coming Storm\n\nNicholas Weaver Sangram Dash Sisense breach U.S. Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency\n\n## 3 thoughts on \u201cWhy CISA is Warning CISOs About a Breach at Sisense\u201d\n\n  1. oakgrove April 11, 2024\n\n\u201cIf they are telling people to rest credentials\u201d\n\nrest -> reset\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  2. RipNoLonger April 11, 2024\n\nAlmost makes me wonder if some of these companies aren\u2019t deliberately\nmishandling very sensitive information. This is conspiratorial, but wouldn\u2019t\nit be logical for a foreign agency to sell a central dashboard to collect as\nmany credentials as possible?\n\nHow can they be that stupid to not encrypt every single bit of customer data \u2013\nnot just security info but everything (company names, addresses, etc.)?\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  3. Ar\u016bnas April 11, 2024\n\n\u201cThe former (leaving Amazon credentials in your Git archive) is bad but\nforgivable.\u201d\n\nNot forgivable. The thing with Git is that once provided, information is hard\nto delete. Even if deleted, these credentials *will be there* in commit\nhistory.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMailing List\n\nSubscribe here\n\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\n  * Why CISA is Warning CISOs About a Breach at Sisense\n  * Twitter\u2019s Clumsy Pivot to X.com Is a Gift to Phishers\n  * April\u2019s Patch Tuesday Brings Record Number of Fixes\n  * Fake Lawsuit Threat Exposes Privnote Phishing Sites\n  * \u2018The Manipulaters\u2019 Improve Phishing, Still Fail at Opsec\n\nStory Categories\n\n  * A Little Sunshine\n  * All About Skimmers\n  * Ashley Madison breach\n  * Breadcrumbs\n  * Data Breaches\n  * DDoS-for-Hire\n  * Employment Fraud\n  * How to Break Into Security\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * Latest Warnings\n  * Ne'er-Do-Well News\n  * Other\n  * Pharma Wars\n  * Ransomware\n  * Russia's War on Ukraine\n  * Security Tools\n  * SIM Swapping\n  * Spam Nation\n  * Target: Small Businesses\n  * Tax Refund Fraud\n  * The Coming Storm\n  * Time to Patch\n  * Web Fraud 2.0\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\u00a9 Krebs on Security - Mastodon\n\n", "frontpage": true}
