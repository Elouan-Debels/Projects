This year it is front and center as we see the beginnings of major AI\nproductivity gains for both enterprise customers and consumers. Although the\nmajority of 2023\u2019s AI venture funding in the U.S. went to infrastructure\u201460%\nto the biggest large language model (LLM) providers\u2014application companies\ncontinue to dominate the AI 50 list.\n\nMeanwhile, we are beginning to see what AI-infused companies will look like.\nToday, many are integrating AI into their processes as a way to accelerate\nKPIs. We\u2019re seeing large companies benefit from integrating AI into their\nproducts. Workflow automation platform ServiceNow is achieving case avoidance\nrates of nearly 20% with their AI-powered Now Assist. Palo Alto Networks has\nreduced the cost of processing expenses with AI. Hubspot has scaled customer\nsupport with AI. And Swedish fintech Klarna recently announced over $40\nmillion in run-rate savings by building AI into their customer support.\nThousands of companies are now integrating AI into their workflows to see\nincreased growth and decrease costs. AI 50 companies are enabling these rapid\nimprovements.\n\nTomorrow, we expect to see UX and UI reimagined around the capabilities of AI.\nReplicating existing functions better and cheaper, will be followed by\nevolving entirely new user interfaces to deliver valuable new experiences.\n\n## What\u2019s new this year?\n\nThe big movements in this year\u2019s AI 50 list highlight how generative AI is\nincreasing enterprise and industry productivity. The category of enterprise\ngeneral productivity doubled this year, going from four companies to eight as\nthey broadened their offerings to meet customers\u2019 growing demands. Writer,\npreviously in our enterprise marketing category, fleshed out their product\nlines to apply across all corporate departments. Notion, new to the list,\nintegrated an AI assistant across their productivity platform, and added new\ncapabilities like calendering.\n\nFive productivity apps, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, DeepL, Notion\nand Tome are now catering to customers at the consumer, prosumer and\nenterprise levels. Image editor Photoroom, video generation app Pika and game-\nbuilder Rosebud show that the lines are blurring between consumer and prosumer\nfor creative software. Overall, companies in that category also doubled, going\nfrom three to six.\n\nThere are fewer industry vertical categories this year, but a new industrial\nsector emerged. Figure in robotics, Tractian in industrial maintenance and\nWaabi in self-driving are beginning to show how the integration of AI software\nwith hardware will transform work in the physical world.\n\n2023 was a strong year for infrastructure overall, and includes some\nformidable new entrants like Mistral, a major contender in foundation models.\nIn the cloud data platform category, Pinecone and Weaviate demonstrated the\nimportance of vector databases. Meanwhile, Databricks, through its acquisition\nof MosaicML last year, has also moved to join Anyscale, Baseten, Replicate and\nTogether in the inference provider category. And LangChain has established\nitself in a category of its own as an all-purpose application development\nframework for working with LLMs.\n\n## Companies of the future\n\nPrevious waves of tech innovation\u2014networking, the internet and mobile\u2014have\nlargely been communication revolutions. AI promises to be something\ndifferent\u2014a productivity revolution, more akin to the personal computer, which\nshaped the future of business and industry.\n\nAs more AIs are developed, they will begin to work together as networks of\nAIs. In the past year, we have seen generative AI extend beyond simple text or\ncode generation to agentic interaction. Just as the rise of the PC and then\nthe smartphone drove demand for internet bandwidth to transmit data, the\nevolution of AI agents will drive demand for new infrastructure to support\never more powerful computation and crosstalk.\n\nWe are entering a world where, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says, \u201cevery pixel\nwill be generated.\u201d In this generative future, company building itself could\nbecome the work of AI agents; And someday entire companies might work like\nneural networks.\n\nWhat we are seeing in the application landscape now are the first iterations\nof the tools that will be used by the next generation of companies. We can\nprobably expect these companies to be smaller, but the ease of company\ngeneration means there will be far more of them. Company formation will become\nfaster and more fluid, with new ownership and management structures. Someday,\nthere may be large companies operated by a single AI engineer.\n\nMost companies of the near future will not be one-person companies, but they\nwill have different needs and different pain points than the companies of\ntoday. They\u2019ll require enterprise products that can solve challenges in\nknowledge management and content generation, in trust, safety and\nauthentication. The amount of software these companies will run will expand\nand change, with code generation and software agents enabling more\ncustomization and fast-cycle iteration.\n\nTo win the hearts and minds of the businesses of the future, founders will\nneed to answer some critical questions. What kinds of products will these\ncompanies make? What kinds of infrastructure and applications will they need?\nHow will the workforce change? How will patterns of distribution and value\ncapture change? What share of their total addressable market will be composed\nof people vs autonomous AI agents?\n\n## What\u2019s Next\n\nProductivity revolutions like the AI revolution drive costs down.\nTechnological progress this century has radically driven down the cost of\nhardware, but the costs of services delivered by humans, from healthcare to\neducation, have skyrocketed. AI has the potential to reduce costs in such\ncrucial areas making them more accessible and affordable. These changes need\nto be made responsibly to mitigate job loss and drive job creation. AI will\nenable us to do much more with less, but we will need both government and\nprivate efforts to retrain and empower everyone.\n\nAI is positioned to change the cost structure and increase productivity in\nsome of the most crucial areas in our society. It has the potential to lead to\nbetter education, healthier populations and more productive people by\nabstracting away mundane work and allowing us to focus our attention on more\nimportant issues and better tools for the future. It can free up more people\nto tackle more problems to create a better society.\n\nThe 2024 AI 50 captures this broadening scope of AI. The list has applications\nthat are more general than ever, and we expect it to expand in both depth and\nbreadth in the coming years. 2024 is really just the beginning.\n\n## Share\n\nShare this via email\n\n## Related Topics\n\n#AI\n\n## AI Ascent 2024\n\nVideo highlights from our AI conference.\n\nNews\n\nRead\n\n## Generative AI Is Exploding.
