You can sign up for our Research\nnewsletter here.\n\nThe next few years are make or break for launch startups\u2014either achieve orbit\nand scale or go the way of Astra and Virgin Orbit.\n\nOver the next two weeks, Payload will examine the capital raised by launch\nstartups, how dollars are being spent, the product roadmap progress, and how\n(or if) the companies fit into the future of launch.\n\nThere are two key categories of launch in our mind: economic launch and\nresponsive launch. SpaceX has achieved dominance in economic launch (in other\nwords, it\u2019s unlikely that any launch company will match their economics\nanytime soon). However, the responsive category (launching at any time into\nany orbital plane at a reasonable cost) is still up for grabs and is a market\nthat can create a few sustainable winners.\n\nTeam yet to orbit: Today, we will cover the launch startups that have yet to\nreach orbit: Relativity, ABL, and Stoke.\n\nRelativity and ABL have each launched once, with both attempts failing to\nreach orbit.\n\nHistory says that\u2019s OK: 47% of maiden launches suffer a significant anomaly,\naccording to ESA chief Josef Aschbacher. SpaceX\u2019s first rocket, the Falcon 1,\nfailed to reach orbit on its first three launches. New rockets needing\nmultiple shots on goal is almost expected in the rocket game.\n\nHowever, the launch investing landscape is maturing, and investors now have a\nshorter leash, careful not to throw good money after bad.\n\n## Relativity Space\n\nRelativity has raised $1.3B since its inception nearly a decade ago.\n\nIts most recent round, a 2021 $650M Series E, saw participation from\nBlackrock, Coatue, Baillie Gifford, Caruso Ventures, Fidelity, Mark Cuban,\nTiger Global, and 25 other investors, according to Pitchbook data.\n\nThank you, next: The first rocket Relativity developed was the Terran 1,\ndesigned to transport 1,250 kg to LEO. Terran 1\u2019s 2023 maiden launch ended in\nfailure when the vehicle experienced a second-stage engine anomaly.\n\nTerran R: Following that launch, Relativity determined that expendable small\nlaunch vehicles were not economically viable over the long run, and decided to\nshut down its Terran 1 program to go all in on the heavy-lift and reusable\nTerran R.\n\n  * Terran R is designed to transport 23,500 kg to LEO with first-stage reusability or 33,500 kg to LEO in an expendable configuration.\n  * The company says the rocket will debut in 2026.\n\nTerran R rendering. Image: Relativity\n\nSmall\u2192 large rationale: When asked in a recent Payload interview if investors\nhave pushed back due to the lack of an orbital proof point, Relativity CEO Tim\nEllis said, \u201cGetting to orbit would have been a huge proof point and would\nhave helped us...but weigh that against going to orbit with the wrong product.\nTerran 1 is interesting but not that interesting. Terran R is very interesting\nfrom a product-market fit, and the total addressable market is 20x larger. We\nare building the next alternative to Falcon 9.\u201d\n\nOur take: Relativity had a second Terran 1 far along in production in\npreparation for flight two. So, why not try to hit such a critical technical\nmilestone? Management\u2019s explanation is that the first launch was enough of a\nsuccess that it did not warrant a second test. We believe that a better\nexplanation might be found in the funding environment.\n\nWhen raising funds so close to a potential launch milestone, investor\ndecisions often hinge on the result. We believe the more reasonable\nexplanation here is that Relativity decided not to take the risk of a second\nlaunch to avoid a negative proof point and instead refocus investor attention\non a larger SpaceX-like launch vehicle (which also arguably helps justify a\n$4B+ valuation).\n\nIncoming Series F?: Sources tell Payload the company has gone out to market to\nraise a $1B+ Series F round, which, if closed, would bring Relativity\u2019s total\nfunds raised to a staggering $2.3B. To put that in perspective, Rocket Lab\u2019s\nmarket cap sits at $1.75B, and Blue Origin is eyeing an acquisition of ULA for\nroughly $2B-$3B.\n\nFalcon 9 vs. Terran R: At 23,500 kg to LEO in a reusable configuration, the\nTerran R looks a lot like Falcon 9.\n\n  * SpaceX spent ~$400M to get to a non-reusable Falcon 9. If we factor in over a decade of inflation and the millions more spent to get to reusability, we can reasonably ballpark estimate Falcon 9\u2019s full R&D costs to be in the billion-dollar range.\n\nTerran R costs: Ellis similarly characterized the cost of developing Terran R\nat roughly one billion dollars.\n\nWe think that R&D number may be true if you just take the capital needed from\nhere on out, but if we factor in the $1.3B of capital raised for development\ncosts thus far plus another billion dollars the company is seeking in the\nSeries F, the net spend to get to Terran R could reach $2B+.The biggest\nquestion in our mind is who\u2019s willing to fund the business now that an orbital\nproof point has pushed itself out a few more years?\n\nHowever, if investors can stomach the high upfront cost and the inevitable\nstumbles of a new rocket, particularly one attempting reusability out the\ngate\u2014there could be a big reward at the end of the launch plume in the form of\na reusable rocket more capable than Falcon 9. That\u2019s assuming there\u2019s\nmeaningful market share left to grab, with New Glenn, Vulcan, Starship,\nNeutron, and Ariane 6 all set to add capacity in the next year and change. It\nis a high-risk, high-reward bet that Relativity argues is the right approach\nto compete in the next era of launch.\n\n# ABL Space Systems\n\nABL Space Systems was founded in 2017 and has raised $461M of capital. The\nbulk of the funding came from a 2021 $372M Series B round led by T. Rowe Price\nand included participation from Fidelity, In-Q-Tel, and Lockheed.\n\nABL also won a $60M Space Force STRATFI award last year that included $30M of\ngovernment funding and $30M of match funding from private investors. The award\nrepresented a creative opportunity to raise non-dilutive government funding\nand encourage private investors to participate.\n\nRS1: ABL is developing the expendable RS1 rocket, which is capable of\ntransporting 1,350 kg to LEO. The rocket is propelled by nine gas generator E2\nengines\u2014which the company calls \u201cintentionally boring\u201d for simplicity and\nreliability.\n\nMaiden launch: The RS1\u2019s maiden launch in January 2023 ended in failure\nshortly after liftoff due to a power anomaly. ABL is conducting pre-launch\noperations ahead of flight two.\n\nLaunch in a box: At 1,350 kg, ABL\u2019s RS1 rocket is solidly positioned within\nthe small launch market. Its differentiating feature is its GS0 \u201claunch in a\nbox\u201d system, which allows the company to launch from virtually any flat\nsurface in the world.\n\n  * The GS0 pad and rocket can be packaged in shipping containers for transportation.\n  * ABL believes the launch site flexibility offers a strategic advantage in responsive launch, particularly for the government, which prioritizes resilient launch.\n\nImage: ABL\n\n\u201cOver the past five or six years, there was an initial wave of investment into\nlaunch purely based on the success of SpaceX and the incredible gains that\nearly investors were able to achieve on the investment,\u201d Dan Piemont, ABL\u2019s\ncofounder, told Payload in a recent interview. \u201cThere was a lack of\nunderstanding of the risks that make it difficult to be a successful launch\nbusiness. Now there is a much better understanding.\u201d\n\nPiemont believes there are three key characteristics that launch investors are\nlooking for:\n\n  1. Technical capability: The engineering needs to be technically sound.\n  2. Is there demand? Just because you have a capability doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s valuable.\n  3. Economics: Does the architecture have solid unit economics?\n\nABL\u2019s breakeven point: The company falls into the small and responsive launch\ncategory, providing a custom launch service for a premium. The expendable\nsmall launch market is notoriously difficult to reach profitability given the\nneed for a high launch cadence to cover fixed costs. The company says it\u2019s\nhyper-focused on a sustainable launch model, telling Payload it expects to be\nable to break even at a single-digit yearly launch cadence.\n\nHowever, the company still has a lot to prove (and more cash to spend) to get\nto that single-digit cadence, as it is still searching for its first orbital\nproof point.\n\n## \\+ Stoke Space\n\nStoke has raised $175M. It is still early in its development cycle and a year\nor two away from its first orbital launch attempt, but the startup is worth\nmentioning due to the investor interest it is receiving. Investor enthusiasm\nis driven by the company\u2019s pursuit of a milestone that even Falcon 9 couldn\u2019t\nhit: a fully reusable rocket. We believe Stoke could be the last new US launch\nstartup to receive significant funding for quite some time.\n\nStoke\u2019s full reusability:\n\n  * The rocket\u2019s novel second stage resembles a reentry capsule with a large circular heat shield.\n  * However, instead of large engines poking out of the bottom, it employs 30 small thruster openings arranged around the perimeter of the heat shield.\n\nThe company hopes this will solve the second-stage expendability problem and\nlead to dramatically improved economics.\n\n## Elephant in the Room: Virgin Orbit and Astra\n\nImage: Virgin Orbit\n\nLast year, the launch market saw two startups\u2014Virgin Orbit and Astra\u2014leave\ntheir investors in the dust. We believe the investments were more of a warning\nagainst betting on fundamentally unsustainable business models, rather than a\nreferendum on the small launch category. Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nThe Virgin Orbit story: Like ABL, Virgin Orbit also emphasized its resilient\nlaunch approach, featuring the ability for its first stage (a modified Boeing\n747) to take off and land on a runway. The company experienced four successful\nlaunches and two failures. However, its cost structure was the real issue and\nnever gave it a fighting chance. Virgin Orbit\u2019s development costs were in the\nbillion dollar range, it carried ~$150M in annual staffing cost, and\nshouldered hefty Boeing 747 maintenance costs. With a per launch price tag of\njust ~$12M, revenue could never be able to keep up with costs. The economics\nwere flawed.\n\nThe Astra story: Astra\u2019s costs were significantly lower, with a reasonable\nheadcount and moderate R&D expenses. However, the company\u2019s rocket was tiny\nand carried an equally small launch price tag of roughly $3M-$5M. Like Virgin\nOrbit, Astra would have had to launch an awful lot of rockets to cover its\nfixed costs.\n\nEnd food for thought: SpaceX has launched over 300 times, with reusability\ndriving healthy gross margins, and yet it has only recently begun squeaking\nout a profit.\n\nShare\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n\nSign up for our Flagship Daily Newsletter\n\nYou are now subscribed to our list.
