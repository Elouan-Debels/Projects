combination of owning\na home, getting married, having kids and making enough after expenses to save\nfor retirement and spend on leisure \u2014 is becoming increasingly expensive.\n\n\u201cThe benchmark of a six-figure salary used to be the gold standard income,\u201d\nSabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist, told CNBC. \u201cIt represented the\ntipping point of finally earning a disposable income and building savings and\nspending based on your wants, not just your needs.\u201d\n\nMore than half (52%) of Americans say they would need at least $100,000 a year\nto feel financially comfortable, with 26% saying they would need a salary in\nthe range of $100,000 to $149,000 per year, according to a 2023 CNBC Your\nMoney survey conducted by SurveyMonkey.\n\n## As part of its National Financial Literacy Month efforts, CNBC will be\nfeaturing stories throughout the month dedicated to helping people manage,\ngrow and protect their money so they can truly live

The report tallied estimated annual essential expenses\nfor such a family and then doubled that figure.\n\nUsing that framework, GoBankingRates found that all 50 states require more\nthan a $100,000 annual income, according to the report, with 38 states needing\nmore than $140,000.\n\nJason Reginato | CNBC\n\nEconomists have suggested that debt growth has become a substitution for\nincome growth. Student loan debt reached an all-time high of $1.77 trillion in\nthe first quarter of 2023 and Americans collectively owe $1.13 trillion on\ntheir credit cards as of the fourth quarter of 2023. This debt can have a\nripple effect, especially when entire generations are starting their\nadulthoods with thousands of dollars in debt.\n\n\u201cNow people making well over six figures are still living paycheck to\npaycheck,\u201d Romanoff said. \u201cSo what used to symbolize financial freedom is now\nkeeping people stressed about making ends meet.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above to learn how much families in the U.S. need to make to\nachieve the American Dream.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Friday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Boeing, First Solar, Schwab & more\n  * Citi says this \u2018high risk\u2019 but \u2018attractive\u2019 global stock has 280% upside\n  * This AI stock could fall 50% and has an \u2018exaggerated artificial intelligence narrative,\u2019 Morningstar says\n  * Morgan Stanley names 3 overlooked global tech stocks, giving one almost 100% upside\n\n## More In Your Money\n\nAmericans think they need almost $1.5 million to retire.
