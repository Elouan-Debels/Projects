Others are at risk\n\nBy Dalmeet Singh Chawla9 April 2024\n\n  * No comments\n\n  * Bookmark\n\nPlease Sign in to your account to use this feature\n\nWhen Jonathan Goodman went looking for a paper published by the popular\nchemistry journal Heterocycles, he realised something odd. Not only was the\npaper he was looking for not available, all of the journal\u2019s content had\ndisappeared from the web.\n\n\u2018I was looking for an article in Heterocycles because it\u2019s a journal which\ncontains a lot of useful articles,\u2019 says Goodman, a chemist at the University\nof Cambridge, UK. But when he went on the journal website, Goodman came across\na note saying publication in the journal had been suspended and there was no\naccess to the title\u2019s previously published content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn archived version of the note on the Heterocycles webpage says the journal\nsuspended publication in December 2023 due to \u2018various circumstances\u2019. It goes\non to add that Heterocycles has \u2018completed its role in promoting the\nrecognition of heterocyclic chemistry as a discipline\u2019.\n\nThis content is provided by Twitter.

Anyone know what happens with copyright in cases like\n> this? Could authors simply post their past publications?\n> pic.twitter.com/uBKTzDvp6e\n>\n> \u2014 Mathias Senge (@mathiassenge) January 6, 2024\n\nThe Japan Institute of Heterocyclic Chemistry, which published Heterocycles,\ntold Chemistry World that publication ceased last year and that subscribers\nwere informed via email.\n\nThe case of Heterocycles is not unique. A January 2024 study of more than 7.4\nmillion studies found that just under 28% were not preserved in any online\narchive, meaning that much of the scholarly literature is at risk of being\nlost if their publications are discontinued.\n\nMartin Paul Eve, principal developer at Crossref \u2013 the registry that issues\nunique digital object identifiers for journal articles \u2013 who authored the\nanalysis, says his study found that a quarter of Crossref members didn\u2019t have\nany digital preservation in place for their content.\n\nPreviously, it was librarians whose duty was to preserve hard copies of\nmanuscripts and make them available, Eve notes, but that duty has transitioned\nto publishers as journals have switched to a digital format.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s become the expectation that publishers should be the ones who preserve\nmaterial,\u2019 Eve says. \u2018However, that message has got slightly lost in that\ntransition and not all publishers know that they have a responsibility to\nensure the continued accessibility of the material they publish.\u2019\n\nA 2016 study found that the websites of just over 2% of the more than 9000\njournals indexed in Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) at the time were\nno longer active. While a 2021 analysis that evaluated the fate of academic\njournals that were delisted from indexing databases between 2000 and 2019\nfound that 176 journals had vanished since being removed from prominent\ndatabases such as Scopus, Ulrichsweb and the DOAJ.\n\n\u2018The indexing landscape is very good at keeping track of what\u2019s coming out,\u2019\nMikael Laakso, an information scientist at the Hanken School of Economics in\nHelsinki, Finland, who co-authored the 2021 study, said at the time. \u2018But as\nsoon as a journal stops publishing they are commonly dropped from the indexes\nand since the information about removed journals is not maintained it is\nreally hard to figure out which the at-risk journals are at any given point in\ntime.\u2019\n\nGoodman reached out to his local library, which, he says, is paying a\nsubscription fee for access to Heterocycles but is concerned about continuing\nto do so. After looking into this, the library discovered that Heterocycles\nhad subscribed to a service called CLOCKSS, a dark archive of around 55\nbillion journal articles and 490,000 books that aims to digitally preserve\nscholarly literature. Other similar archives include LOCKSS and Portico.\n\nAlicia Wise, executive director of CLOCKSS in Surrey, UK, confirmed that her\norganisation does hold a complete record of Heterocycles. According to Wise,\nthe Japan Institute of Heterocyclic Chemistry is weighing up future options\nfor the journal. \u2018The content is safe and secure and we will be in a position\nto make it available should they not find a successor organisation to look\nafter it,\u2019 she notes.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a useful service,\u2019 says Goodman, referring to CLOCKSS. \u2018It\u2019s not clear\nwhen the articles will become available again and, of course, until you can\nsee them, you can\u2019t be sure that they\u2019re all there.\u2019\n\n\u2018A lot of researchers and libraries think that the long-term preservation of\nbooks and journals is a done deal,\u2019 says Wise. \u2018But nothing could be farther\nfrom the truth.\u2019\n\n## Topics\n\n  * Academia\n  * heterocycles\n  * journals\n  * Publishing\n\n  * No comments\n\n  * Bookmark\n\nPlease Sign in to your account to use this feature\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * News\n\n### Fighting fire with fire: AI can detect phony AI-generated chemistry papers\n\n16 November 2023 09:30\n\nBy Rebecca Trager\n\n  * News\n\n### Elsevier\u2019s tiered pricing structure will see low-income countries pay\nleast for submissions\n\n23 October 2023 08:30\n\nBy Jamie Durrani\n\n  * Opinion\n\n### Navigating the literature torrent\n\n7 August 2023 13:00\n\nBy Derek Lowe\n\n  * News\n\n### China displaces US as top publisher of high-quality natural science\nstudies\n\n25 May 2023 13:30\n\nBy Rebecca Trager\n\n  * News\n\n### Sanctioning of 50 journals raises concerns over special issues in \u2018mega-\njournals\u2019\n\n24 April 2023 13:30\n\nBy Anthony King\n\n  * News\n\n### Journals to trial tool that automatically flags reproducibility and\ntransparency issues in papers\n\n8 December 2022 15:15\n\nBy Dalmeet Singh Chawla\n\n### No comments yet\n\nYou're not signed in.
