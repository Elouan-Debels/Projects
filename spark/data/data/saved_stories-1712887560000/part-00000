The advantages of open\nsourcing model code include enhanced predictability, accountability,\nstreamlined collaboration eg with other central banks, improvements to the\nquality of the models and raised awareness about models. This paper proposes a\nframework to benchmark how macroeconomic models are open sourced according to\ncriteria such as code accessibility, level of documentation, existence of\nversion or vintage control, and openness to comments or proposed technical\nenhancements by the general public. Sharing source code of models appears to\nbe a trend that is likely to pick up over time, as modern software engineering\npractices and higher levels of awareness of the advantages of open source\nsoftware permeate more central banks\u2019 practices. However, choices on whether\nand how these models are disclosed may depend on availability of resources and\nobjectives of the central bank. The paper concludes with practical, cost-\nmindful suggestions for central banks considering opening the codes of their\nmacroeconomic models or improving their current levels of disclosure. Open-\nsourced macroeconomic models can be the next frontier in central bank\ncommunication.\n\nKeywords: macroeconomic models, monetary policy, open source software, central\nbank communication\n\nJEL Classification: E5, E60, C87\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nAraujo, Douglas, Open-Sourced Central Bank Macroeconomic Models (March 11,\n2024).
