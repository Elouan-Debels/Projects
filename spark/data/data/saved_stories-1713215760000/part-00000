This unconventional idea involved the dispersion of sex\npheromones over enemy forces, with the intent of generating mutual sexual\nattraction among them causing mass confusion and panic within their platoons.\n\nDating back to 1994, the Wright Laboratory in Ohio, a precursor to the modern\nUnited States Air Force Research Laboratory, drafted a three-page proposal\ndetailing several potential nonlethal chemical weapons. This document,\neventually acquired by the Sunshine Project via a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest, explores the notion of the \"gay bomb\" among other concepts.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nNo well-controlled scientific studies have ever been published suggesting the\npossibility of pheromones causing rapid behavioral changes in humans.^[1]\n\nSome body spray advertisers claim that their products contain human sexual\npheromones which act as an aphrodisiac. In the 1970s, \"copulins\" were patented\nas products which release human pheromones, based on research on rhesus\nmonkeys.^[1] Subsequently, androstenone, axillary sweat, and \"vomodors\" have\nbeen claimed to act as human pheromones.^[2]\n\nDespite these claims, no pheromonal substance has ever been demonstrated to\ndirectly influence human behavior in a peer reviewed study.^[1]^[2]^[3]\n\nUsing a brain imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that when\nhomosexual and heterosexual males are presented with two odors that may be\ninvolved in sexual arousal their brains tend to respond differently, and that\nthe homosexual men tend to respond in the same way as heterosexual women,\nthough it could not be determined whether this was cause or effect.^[4] The\nstudy was expanded to include homosexual women; the results were consistent\nwith previous findings meaning that homosexual women were not as responsive to\nmale identified odors, while their response to female cues was similar to that\nof heterosexual males.^[5] According to the researchers, this research\nsuggests a possible role for human pheromones in the biological basis of\nsexual orientation.^[6]\n\n## Leaked documents[edit]\n\nIn both of the documents, the possibility was canvassed that a strong\naphrodisiac could be dropped on enemy troops, ideally one which would also\ncause \"homosexual behavior\". The documents described the aphrodisiac weapon as\n\"distasteful but completely non-lethal\".^[7]^[8]\n\n## Body odors[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

Again, these effects would\nbe produced by a non-lethal chemical weapon\u2014possibly one that would affect the\nhormonal and digestive systems. It appears that a 'heavy sweating bomb',\n'flatulence bomb' and 'halitosis bomb' were also considered by a committee at\nthe time. The plan was to make an enemy so smelly they could be quite\nliterally sniffed out of hiding by their opponents^[citation needed].\n\n## Ig Nobel Prize awards[edit]\n\nWright Laboratory won the satiric 2007 Ig Nobel Peace Prize for \"instigating\nresearch & development on a chemical weapon\u2014the so-called 'gay bomb'\u2014that will\nmake enemy soldiers become sexually irresistible to each other.\"^[9]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * 30 Rock, a sitcom which featured a working gay bomb in the episode \"Cooter\".\n  * Bremelanotide, the only known synthetic aphrodisiac\n  * Brickleberry, a sitcom whose sixth episode, \"Gay Bomb\", involves a gay bomb.\n  * Frey effect (science)\n  * Human sex pheromones\n  * Misattribution of arousal\n  * The Alex Jones Show talks about how Atrazine runoff is the equivalent of a gay bomb by causing the endocrine system of amphibians to alter their gender (see: LGBT chemicals conspiracy theory)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Wyatt, Tristram D.
