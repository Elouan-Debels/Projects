Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life, though some\npeople suffer from anxiety disorders, which generally involve episodes of\nanxiety that are more intense, persistent, and frequent than normal.\n\nAnxiety\u2014in both its normal and extreme forms\u2014is associated with the tendency\nto procrastinate, by unnecessarily postponing decisions or actions. For\nexample, if a student is anxious about a homework assignment, they might\npostpone working on it in order to avoid dealing with the negative emotions\nthat they experience when thinking about this assignment.\n\nThe association between anxiety and procrastination is complex, and can have\nserious implications, so it\u2019s important to understand it. As such, in the\nfollowing article you will learn more about how anxiety and procrastination\nare connected, and see what you can do about this in practice.\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\n## The connection between anxiety and procrastination\n\nAnxiety can cause people to procrastinate by:\n\n  * Increasing their aversion to a task, for example by increasing the negative emotions that they associate with it.\n  * Making them worry more about a task, which can lead to issues such as overthinking, feeling overwhelmed, and being unsure how to start, especially in the face of things like uncertainty.\n  * Causing them to ruminate more, for example by making them preoccupied with painful thoughts about the past while distracting them from the future.\n\nAccordingly, people are often more likely to procrastinate while they\u2019re\nanxious, or to procrastinate on tasks that make them anxious. This is the case\neven if procrastinating for this reason can lead to more anxiety and negative\nemotions over time by dragging out the task instead of finishing it, and even\nthough this behavior can lead to various other issues, such as worse\nperformance, missed opportunities, and increased interpersonal conflicts.\n\nFurthermore, anxiety is not only a potential cause of procrastination, but\nalso a potential consequence of it, meaning that procrastination can make\npeople feel anxious or exacerbate existing anxiety. This means that people can\nenter an anxiety-procrastination cycle, where anxiety leads people to\nprocrastinate, which in turn makes them more anxious, which causes them to\nkeep procrastinating, and so on.\n\nHowever, there are also important caveats about the relationship between\nanxiety and procrastination:\n\n  * The relationship between anxiety and procrastination is complex. This complexity means, for example, that various factors, such as people\u2019s self-efficacy and mindfulness, can moderate the influence of anxiety on procrastination (e.g., high self-efficacy can serve as a resilience factor that protects against the effects of anxiety on procrastination). In addition, there are various types of procrastination (e.g., anxious and hedonistic) and various forms of anxiety (e.g., as a stable personality trait and as a temporary mental state), which can be associated in different ways.\n  * Anxiety doesn\u2019t always lead to procrastination. Specifically, some people are able to act in a timely manner even though they\u2019re anxious, for example if their anxiety is mild enough and their motivation is strong enough. Furthermore, there are situations where anxiety doesn\u2019t increase the likelihood of procrastination, or even decreases this likelihood, for example by making people worried about a certain task in a way that makes them more likely to get started on it early. This also means that not everyone who has anxiety necessarily procrastinates.\n  * Other things besides anxiety can cause procrastination. For example, other causes of procrastination include abstract goals, far-future rewards, depression, perfectionism, and ADHD. This means that not everyone who procrastinates is necessarily anxious, and that anxious people who do procrastinate don\u2019t necessarily do so because of their anxiety, or only because of their anxiety.\n\nIn summary, anxiety can lead to procrastination in various ways, such as\nincreasing people\u2019s aversion to tasks and making them ruminate more.\nFurthermore, procrastination can sometimes increase anxiety, which can lead to\nan anxiety-procrastination cycle. However, the relationship between these\nphenomena is complex, which means, for example, that anxiety doesn\u2019t always\nlead to procrastination, and can sometimes even decrease it.\n\n## Anxious procrastination\n\nThe term anxious procrastination can be used in two key ways. First, it can be\nused to refer to procrastination that\u2019s driven primarily by anxiety. Second,\nit can be used to refer to procrastination that involves postponing things\ndespite an intention to work on them and despite being aware that this delay\nis irrational and self-defeating.\n\nThis second type of procrastination is sometimes also referred to as\ntraditional procrastination or irrational delay. It is contrasted with\nhedonistic procrastination (or hedonistic delay), which involves postponing\nthings voluntarily due to prioritization of enjoyable activities or due to\nlack of caring.\n\nThe distinction between anxious and hedonistic procrastination is similar to\nthe distinction between avoidant procrastination, which involves delaying due\nto fears and anxieties, and arousal procrastination, which involves waiting\nuntil right before the deadline to make tasks more exciting. However, the\ndistinction between these types of procrastination has been criticized, as\nhave similar distinctions (e.g., between passive and active procrastination).\n\nNote that the exact way in which different types of procrastination are\ncategorized generally isn\u2019t important from a practical perspective. Rather,\nwhat is important is to understand that anxiety and similar issues can cause\nprocrastination, but that other types of issues can also cause\nprocrastination, such as the prioritization of short-term enjoyment over long-\nterm achievement.\n\n## Additional information about anxiety\n\nThe sub-sections below contain further information about anxiety, which\ngenerally isn\u2019t crucial to dealing with anxiety-based procrastination, but\nwhich can nevertheless be useful in some cases.\n\n### Forms of anxiety\n\nAnxiety can take many different forms. For example, it can vary in its\nintensity (e.g., from mild to severe), based on factors such as how strong the\nanxiety is, how often it occurs, and how it influences the person who\nexperiences it. Similarly, anxiety can occur constantly throughout the day, or\nit can occur only at specific times, such as someone engages with a certain\ntask.\n\nIn addition, people can experience anxiety with regard to many things, such\nas:\n\n  * Specific types of tasks, such as test anxiety toward tests that students take in school, or performance anxiety on public presentations that someone gives as part of their work.\n  * Specific topics, such as math and statistics, regardless of what activity people perform in relation to that topic (e.g., take a test, do a homework assignment, or write a paper).\n  * Whole domains, such as school or the workplace.\n  * The consequences of performance on tasks, for example when it comes to the rewards associated with success or the punishments associated with failure.\n  * Other people\u2019s evaluation of their performance (also known as evaluation anxiety).\n  * General interactions with other people (also known as social anxiety).\n\n### The difference between anxiety and fear\n\nSimilarly to anxiety, fear of various things, such as failure or negative\nfeedback, can also cause procrastination or be caused by it.\n\nAnxiety and fear are closely related, as they are highly similar to each\nother, and even overlap in many ways, in terms of how they\u2019re described and\nhow they influence people. One possible way to distinguish between these\nconcepts is to view fear as an emotional response to a specific and immediate\nthreat, and view anxiety as a response to a more ambiguous and uncertain\nfuture threat. Under this distinction, fear is more likely to trigger an\nimmediate and active response, whereas anxiety is more likely to prompt\ncaution and observation. However, the terms fear and anxiety are often used\ninterchangeably, and their exact definitions\u2014as well as any distinctions\nbetween them\u2014depend heavily on who is using these terms, how, and in what\ncontext.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, any distinctions between these two concepts are\ngenerally not crucial to understand in the context of overcoming anxiety-based\nprocrastination, as long as you understand these concepts in general, and\nunderstand that they can both lead to procrastination.\n\n### Anxiety and neuroticism\n\nIncreased anxiety is linked to the personality trait of neuroticism, which\nreflects the tendency to be prone to negative emotions and stress. However,\nthe link between neuroticism as a whole and procrastination as a whole is\nfairly weak, likely due to the complexity of the relationship between them,\nfor example in the sense that different aspects of neuroticism can either\nincrease or decrease procrastination, similarly to how different forms of\nanxiety can have different effects on procrastination.\n\n## Dealing with anxiety-based procrastination\n\nIf you suffer from severe anxiety or an anxiety disorder, then you should\ngenerally seek help from a licensed professional (e.g., a therapist,\npsychologist, or psychiatrist), who will be able to advise you on the proper\ncourse of treatment, including things such as therapy, medication, and\nlifestyle changes. This can be beneficial in reducing anxiety, as well as the\nissues that it leads to, such as procrastination.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to deal with anxiety-based procrastination yourself, then a\nkey technique you can use is inquiry-based stress reduction. To do this, you\nshould first identify a stressful thought that you have, and then consider the\nfollowing questions:\n\n  * Is this thought true?\n  * Can you absolutely know that this thought is true?\n\nThen, you should reflect on the stressful thought, by considering factors such\nas its causes and effects, to understand it better. You can help yourself do\nthis by considering the following questions:\n\n  * How do you react when you have this thought?\n  * Does this thought bring peace or stress to your life?\n  * What images do you see, past or present, as you think this thought?\n  * What physical sensations arise from having this thought?\n  * What emotions arise when you have that thought?\n  * Do any obsessions or addictions begin to appear when you have this thought?\n  * How do you treat others when you have this thought?\n  * How do you treat yourself when you have this thought?\n\nThen, you should try to perceive reality without the distortions that are\ncaused by the stressful thought, and think about how you would feel without\nthat thought, by considering:\n\n  * Who would you be without the thought?\n\nFinally, you should identify concrete evidence for the validity of the\nopposite of the stressful thought, and explore whether that opposite could be\ntrue. For example, if your initial thought was \u201cI won\u2019t be able to study\nproperly for the test\u201d, you can turn it into the opposite thought \u201cI will be\nable to study properly for the test\u201d, and then find evidence that supports the\nnew positive thought that you generated.\n\nIn addition, there are many other anti-procrastination techniques that could\nhelp you deal with anxiety-based procrastination, including, most notably, the\nfollowing:\n\n  * Question and address your fears. For example, if you realize that you\u2019re afraid of someone criticizing you for not having perfect work, you can ask yourself things such as \u201chow likely is it that they will actually care if I make some small mistakes\u201d or \u201cso what if this person criticizes my work?\u201d. When doing this, it could help to use self-distancing techniques, for example by asking yourself \u201cwhy should you worry so much about such tiny issues?\u201d or by considering what advice you would give to a friend if they were in your situation.\n  * Prepare for future contingencies. For example, figure out which distractions might tempt you to procrastinate, and plan how you will deal with them.\n  * Give yourself permission to make mistakes. For example, if you\u2019re writing a paper, accept that your work won\u2019t be perfect, especially when it comes to the first draft.\n  * Break your work into small and manageable steps. For example, if you have a large project that feels overwhelming, such as writing a research paper, you can break it down into a series of small steps, such as creating an outline, finding relevant resources, and writing the introduction.\n  * Start with a tiny step. For example, commit to writing only a single sentence or exercising for only 2 minutes, while giving yourself permission to stop after taking that tiny first step, to reduce the pressure associated with getting started.\n  * Go through a starting ritual. For example, you can have a calming breathing routine that you quickly go through to relax every time you\u2019re about to do a task that makes you anxious.\n  * Switch between tasks. For example, if you\u2019re stuck on a task and can\u2019t make progress, switch to a different task until you\u2019re ready to go back to the first one.\n  * Schedule your work according to your productivity cycles. For example, if you find it easier to concentrate on creative tasks in the morning, then you should schedule such tasks for that time period as much as possible.\n  * Improve your work environment. For example, if your current work environment has a lot of irritating background noise, get noise-canceling headphones or go somewhere quieter.\n  * Improve your social-support network. For example, you can find a role model to imitate or an authority figure to hold you accountable, or you can associate with people who motivate you to make progress while minimizing your contact with people who make you feel stressed.\n  * Get enough rest. For example, if you need to work hard on tasks that require deep concentration, make sure to take enough breaks that you don\u2019t get burnt out. To encourage yourself to do this, you can remind yourself that even if getting rest can reduce your productivity in the short term, it will often be much better for you in the long term, both in terms of your productivity and in terms of your wellbeing.\n  * Develop self-efficacy. Specifically, this is your belief in your ability to perform the actions needed to achieve your goals. You can develop it in various ways, such as identifying the strategies that you can use to achieve your goals, and then thinking about how you can execute those strategies successfully.\n  * Forgive yourself for past procrastination. For example, if you need to get started on a task that you\u2019ve been postponing for a long time, you can say \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have postponed this task in the first place, but that\u2019s in the past, and what\u2019s important now is to move on and just get this done\u201d.\n  * Develop self-compassion. Specifically, you should develop the three components of self-compassion: self-kindness, which involves being nice to yourself, common humanity, which involves recognizing that everyone experiences challenges, and mindfulness, which involves accepting your emotions in a non-judgmental manner.\n  * Acknowledge and reward your progress. For example, you can treat yourself to some pleasant treat once you\u2019ve managed to achieve your study goals for a week in a row.\n\nWhen choosing which techniques to use, it can help to start by figuring out\nwhy you procrastinate, and when and how you do so, since this will help you\nidentify the best anti-procrastination techniques to use in your particular\nsituation. Specifically, doing this can help you figure out how exactly your\nanxiety causes you to procrastinate, and can help you identify other issues\nbeyond anxiety that are also causing you to procrastinate, such as depression,\nperfectionism, and abstract goals.\n\nHowever, if you realize that the main reason for your procrastination is that\nyou suffer from anxiety, you should generally aim to treat that first, using\nhelp from a licensed professional if necessary, since this is important both\nfor dealing with your procrastination, and for reducing the other serious\nissues that anxiety can lead to.\n\nCategories Procrastination Articles\n\nBy Itamar Shatz, PhD\n\nGet research-based tips on how to overcome procrastination.\n\n## Key pages\n\n  * Home\n  * Resources\n  * Start here\n\n## More\n\n  * Newsletter\n  * Coaching\n\nAbout | Contact | Privacy | Terms | \u00a9 2024 Solving Procrastination\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": true}
