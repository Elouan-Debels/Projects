This impossible-sounding feat\nwas achieved using nanostructured black silicon, and could represent a major\nbreakthrough for solar cells and other photodetectors.\n\nIf a hypothetical photovoltaic device has an external quantum efficiency of\n100 percent, that means that every photon of light that strikes it generates\none electron, which exits through the circuit and is harvested as electricity.\n\nMore Stories\n\nBiology\n\nGallery: 50 new marine species found, including this unimpressed sea toad\n\nSpace\n\nMusk plans 1,000-ship fleets to colonize Mars\n\nThis new device is the first to not only reach 100-percent efficiency, but\nexceed it. At 132 percent, that means you get on average 1.32 electrons for\nevery photon. It was made using black silicon as the active material, with\nnanostructures shaped like cones and columns, absorbing UV light.\n\nObviously you can\u2019t have 0.32 of an electron, but put another way you have a\n32-percent chance of generating two electrons from a single photon. On the\nsurface it might sound impossible \u2013 after all, physics dictates that energy\ncan\u2019t be created from nothing. So where are these extra electrons coming from?\n\nIt all comes down to how photovoltaic materials work in general. When a photon\nof incoming light strikes the active material \u2013 usually silicon \u2013 it knocks an\nelectron out of one of its atoms. But under certain circumstances, one high-\nenergy photon could bump two electrons out, without violating any laws of\nphysics.\n\nIt goes without saying that tapping into that phenomenon could be extremely\nhelpful for improving the design of solar cells. In many photovoltaic\nmaterials efficiency is lost in several ways, including photons being\nreflected away from the device, or electrons recombining with the \u201chole\u201d they\nleft in the atom before they can be collected by the circuit.\n\nBut the Aalto team says it\u2019s largely removed these barriers. Black silicon\nabsorbs far more photons than other materials, and the cone and column\nnanostructures reduce electron recombination at the surface of the material.\n\nTogether, these advances made for a device with 130-percent external quantum\nefficiency. The team even had these results independently verified by the\nGerman National Metrology Institute, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt\n(PTB).\n\nThe researchers say that this record efficiency could improve the performance\nof basically any photodetector, including solar cells and other light sensors,\nand that the new detectors are already being manufactured for commercial use.\n\nThe research has been accepted for publication in the journal Physical Review\nLetters.\n\nSource: Aalto University\n\n## Tags\n\nEnergySolar CellPhotovoltaicSiliconAalto UniversityEnergySolar\nPowerEfficiencyWorld's Most EfficientNew Atlas Audio\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\n26 comments\n\nMichael Irving\n\nMichael has always been fascinated by space, technology, dinosaurs, and the\nweirder mysteries of the universe.

They should probably stop calling it efficiency though. Conversion ratio\nor gain.\n\nWorzel August 17, 2020 02:34 AM\n\nThis could be bad news, for a UK company recently set up, claiming a 'massive'\n27% efficiency.\n\nBodger August 17, 2020 04:18 AM\n\n\"This could be bad news, for a UK company recently set up, claiming a\n'massive' 27% efficiency.\"\n\nNot necessarily. It all depends on the costs involved when you get to\ncommercial-scale power production. The number to watch there is power per\ncost. A cheap product that is \"good enough\" in mass production is sometimes\nfar better than a super-expensive product even if the latter is more efficient\nin theory.\n\nChris Coles August 17, 2020 04:27 AM\n\nMy own belief is that we do not \"strip\" electrons; instead, that the electron\nis a part of the electromagnetic force field structure of the proton, which is\nformed around a dipole which acts as a source of both a positive and a\nnegative sink to which the Electromagnetic Force filed is attached. As such\nthe structure has to conform to Maxwell's law, that all positive fields must\nseek the closest negative sink, or extend to infinity. Thus we have an\npositive field that forms what is a near infinite spring surrounding that\nattachment; which has to also conform to a simple fact, that all positive\nfields repulse each other, and as such where that positive field attaches to\nthe negative pole of the dipole, it must form a minute tube of repulsion all\nthe way from the exterior of the proton, down to the negative face of the\ndipole. That that tube of repulsion forms a classic capillary tube, which is\nin fact, the electron we observe seemingly orbiting the proton. Now as all\nsuch protons are in constant rotating motion, the distance between each\nproton's electron, and the adjacent proton's electron must constantly change,\nand again, must obey Maxwell's law, so as the external electromagnetic force\nfield of each proton must extend beyond the orbit of each proton's electron;\nthen as they rotate, the come under the influence of that capillary tube and\nconnect by being drawn down into the capillary. But that must only be for as\nlong as the distance between them allows such a contact, for as rotation\ncontinues, the attachment must conform to Maxwell and move to the closest\nnegative; in that way we observe the constant flow of photon's, relative to\ntemperature of the mass under observation. Now, we have to understand that as\nthese attachments constantly change, they must pass each other, but must\nrepulse. It is my belief that all such electrons are generated by the\nattachments sliding past each other; under normal electromagnetic interaction\nlaws. That all observed electrons supposedly \"stripped\" are in fact generated\nby the interaction of the external positive fields of each proton sliding past\neach other. When you rub a piece of amber with a cloth of wool, you do not\nstrip electrons; you generate new ones by the interaction of the external\nelectromagnetic force fields of the protons passing each other. Oh! for the\nrecord; my theories have been completely dismissed as fake. Food for thought?\n\nWorzel August 17, 2020 04:37 AM\n\nSecond thoughts; most likely to be used for space machinery first, as the\nbudgets are bigger. Home use? Probably not for a long time yet.\n\nsidmehta August 17, 2020 04:40 AM\n\nAgree with Nestor. Impressive, but efficiency is the wrong word. If you are\nover 100% efficient you have a perpetual free energy machine. Which is\nobviously impossible.\n\nvince August 17, 2020 04:57 AM\n\n132% would be a 5 fold increase from the typical 27% efficiency of solar\npanels today. If they really could do this it would be phenomenal and solar\nwould be so much cheaper than natural gas that the entire oil industry would\nshut down in just a few years.\n\nLoad More\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
