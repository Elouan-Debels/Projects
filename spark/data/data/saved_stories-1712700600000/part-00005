These include GPS and remote start-up\nfeatures that are offered as conveniences but can be used by abusers to track\nor harass their victims.\n\n\u201cNo survivor of domestic violence and abuse should have to choose between\ngiving up their car and allowing themselves to be stalked and harmed by those\nwho can access its connectivity and data,\u201d FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel\nsaid in a statement. \u201cWe can \u2014 and should \u2014 do more to make sure these new\nforms of communications help keep survivors safe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosenworcel wrote to automotive manufacturers and wireless service providers\nin January, asking the sectors to detail their pre-installed connection and\ncommunication services and existing policies or processes to remove access to\nthose services. The aim is for survivors to be able to separate their line\nfrom a shared account with a domestic violence abuser without limiting access.\n\nThe notice asks the vehicle manufacturing and wireless service industries to\ndetail whether the FCC\u2019s rules from the Safe Connections Act -\u2014 like requiring\na provider to separate the line of a survivor and abuser two business days\nafter a request \u2014 fully address those concerns. While the SCA was well\nreceived by advocates, there was also criticism that requiring survivors to\nsubmit paperwork \u201cproving\u201d abuse is traumatic at best.\n\n\u201cWe expect that, if a vehicle is under the sole ownership of an abuser, but is\nused by a survivor, the SCA rules would require separation of the connected\ncar service line that is associated with that vehicle through the abuser\u2019s\naccount,\u201d the FCC wrote. \u201cIn these cases, what evidence and standards of proof\nwould be needed from a survivor to separate the connected car service line?\u201d\n\nThe notice also comes amid increasing concern around the broad uses and\nthreats stemming from connected vehicles. In February, the Department of\nCommerce announced that it is investigating the national security risks from\nconnected vehicles, particularly from China.\n\n#### Written by Christian Vasquez\n\nChristian covers industrial cybersecurity for CyberScoop News.
