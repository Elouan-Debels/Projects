Such attacks are vastly more complex than\nregular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware, as mercenary spyware\nattackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of\nspecific individuals and their devices. Mercenary spyware attacks cost\nmillions of dollars and often have a short shelf life, making them much harder\nto detect and prevent. The vast majority of users will never be targeted by\nsuch attacks.\n\nAccording to public reporting and research by civil society organizations,\ntechnology firms, and journalists, individually targeted attacks of such\nexceptional cost and complexity have historically been associated with state\nactors, including private companies developing mercenary spyware on their\nbehalf, such as Pegasus from the NSO Group. Though deployed against a very\nsmall number of individuals \u2014 often journalists, activists, politicians, and\ndiplomats \u2014 mercenary spyware attacks are ongoing and global. Since 2021, we\nhave sent Apple threat notifications multiple times a year as we have detected\nthese attacks, and to date we have notified users in over 150 countries in\ntotal. The extreme cost, sophistication, and worldwide nature of mercenary\nspyware attacks makes them some of the most advanced digital threats in\nexistence today. As a result, Apple does not attribute the attacks or\nresulting threat notifications to any specific attackers or geographical\nregions.\n\nIf Apple detects activity consistent with a mercenary spyware attack, we\nnotify the targeted users in two ways:\n\n  * A Threat Notification is displayed at the top of the page after the user signs into appleid.apple.com.\n\n  * Apple sends an email and iMessage notification to the email addresses and phone numbers associated with the user\u2019s Apple ID.\n\nThese notifications provide additional steps that notified users can take to\nhelp protect their devices, including enabling Lockdown Mode.\n\nMercenary spyware attacks are exceptionally well funded, and they evolve over\ntime. Apple relies solely on internal threat-intelligence information and\ninvestigations to detect such attacks. Although our investigations can never\nachieve absolute certainty, Apple threat notifications are high-confidence\nalerts that a user has been individually targeted by a mercenary spyware\nattack, and should be taken very seriously. We are unable to provide\ninformation about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may\nhelp mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in\nthe future.\n\nApple threat notifications will never ask you to click any links, open files,\ninstall apps or profiles, or provide your Apple ID password or verification\ncode by email or on the phone. To verify that an Apple threat notification is\ngenuine, sign in to appleid.apple.com. If Apple sent you a threat\nnotification, it will be clearly visible at the top of the page after you sign\nin.\n\n#### If you have received an Apple threat notification\n\nWe strongly suggest you enlist expert help, such as the rapid-response\nemergency security assistance provided by the Digital Security Helpline at the\nnonprofit Access Now. Apple threat notification recipients can contact the\nDigital Security Helpline 24 hours a day, seven days a week through their\nwebsite. Outside organizations do not have any information about what caused\nApple to send a threat notification, but they can assist targeted users with\ntailored security advice.\n\n#### Guidance for all users\n\nAll users should continue to protect themselves from general cybercriminals\nand consumer malware by following best practices for security:\n\n  * Update devices to the latest software, as that includes the latest security fixes\n\n  * Protect devices with a passcode\n\n  * Use two-factor authentication and a strong password for Apple ID\n\n  * Install apps from the App Store\n\n  * Use strong and unique passwords online\n\n  * Don\u2019t click on links or attachments from unknown senders\n\nIf you have not received an Apple threat notification but have good reason to\nbelieve you may be individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks, you can\nenable Lockdown Mode on your Apple devices for additional protection. If you\nrequire emergency cybersecurity assistance for other reasons, the Consumer\nReports Security Planner website offers a list of emergency resources that may\nbe able to assist you.\n\nInformation about products not manufactured by Apple, or independent websites\nnot controlled or tested by Apple, is provided without recommendation or\nendorsement.
