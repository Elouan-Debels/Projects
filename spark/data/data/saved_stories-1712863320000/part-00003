Imagination, morality, and culture are\ntraits thought to only be found in humans.\n\nAnother aspect that seems to be uniquely human is the need to keep busy. Most\nanimals would be happy if their basic needs are met: food, shelter, rest. In\ncontrast, we humans don\u2019t like to stay idle. Even if it means falling prey to\nthe illusion of productivity.\n\n## The Need to Keep Busy\n\nIn a research study about busyness and idleness, scientists asked participants\nto go deliver a survey in one of two locations which they could choose from.\n\nThe first option was nearby, allowing people to complete the task quicker,\ncome back to the research center, and wait, doing nothing (the idle option);\nthe second option was far away, with very little time to wait once they\u2019d come\nback (the busy option).\n\nWhich option did people choose? Turns out, it depended on one small element:\nwhether or not they had a justification\u2014even if only specious\u2014to choose the\n\u201cbusy\u201d option.\n\nThe participants were told they were going to get a piece of chocolate as a\nreward. If they were told the chocolate would be the same regardless of the\noption they picked, only 32% of participants chose the faraway location. But\nif they were told they would get milk chocolate at one location and dark\nchocolate at the other, 59% picked the \u201cbusy\u201d option.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem that groundbreaking at first, but the implications are\nprofound: as humans, we tend to do whatever it takes and to use any\njustification to keep busy, even if the task is meaningless. In the words of\nthe scientists behind the study: \u201cOur research suggests that many purported\ngoals that people pursue may be merely justifications to keep themselves\nbusy.\u201d\n\n## Busyness and the Illusion of Being Productive\n\nIn her book Daring Greatly, Dr Bren\u00e9 Brown, a research professor at the\nUniversity of Houston, describes being \u201ccrazy busy\u201d as a numbing strategy that\nallows us to avoid facing the truth of our lives. \u201cI often say that when they\nstart having 12-step meetings for busy-aholics, they\u2019ll need to rent out\nfootball stadiums.\u201d\n\nShe explains that we would rather fill the time with activities\u2014any kind of\nactivity\u2014than to take the risk of finding ourselves alone with our thoughts.\nAnd our society encourages this behavior: being idle or having too much free\ntime is often considered a sign of laziness.\n\nFurthermore, being \u201ccrazy busy\u201d both justifies and reinforces living on\nautopilot. Instead of stopping for a few minutes to ask ourselves why we\u2019re\ndoing something, we keep on mindlessly churning work that may or may not lead\nto a goal we actually care about. It\u2019s also one of the only socially\nacceptable excuses to not do the things that matter. Taking time for yourself?\nFeeling irritated? Forgot to do something important for a friend? You can\nblame it on being too busy.\n\nBeing busy does not equal being productive. When I get distracted by email\nnotifications or when I check social media in the middle of writing an\narticle, the interruption may give me the illusion of being busy. It will take\nlonger to write the article because I keep breaking my state of flow. I will\nfeel like I have worked all afternoon on something, when in reality I just\ndidn\u2019t manage to focus enough to get it done quicker.\n\nBy feeling constantly busy, I also don\u2019t leave room for pure creative\nthinking\u2014instead, I\u2019m filling my brain with external stimuli to give it\nsomething to do. As the study I mentioned earlier shows, it feels good. We\nlike being busy. It\u2019s reassuring. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for us.\n\n## The Busyness Matrix\n\nBetween work tasks and social commitments, it\u2019s easy to spend your entire week\nrunning around without really knowing where the time has gone. To break free\nfrom busyness, I have created a simple tool you can use to conduct a busyness\naudit and see what\u2019s keeping you so busy.\n\nYou\u2019ll ideally need a full week of data, but if your routine doesn\u2019t change\ntoo much throughout the week you could do this in just one day.\n\nFirst, track your time and record what you spend it on. You can use an app\nlike Rize (see my interview with the founder here) or simply put everything\nyou do in your calendar.\n\nThen, place these tasks and activities in the following matrix, based on\nrelevance and meaningfulness:\n\nThe Busyness Matrix\n\nRelevance is based on how aligned the tasks and activities are with your\ncurrent professional and personal commitments. Meaningfulness is based on how\nalive these tasks make you feel.\n\nFor instance, attending a boring networking event is relevant but probably not\nmeaningful. An exciting work project or planning your next holiday is both\nrelevant and meaningful. Taking an online course to learn how to speak Chinese\nmay not be relevant to your current commitments, but may feel highly\nmeaningful. Attending meetings with no clear agenda or aimlessly browsing\nsocial media are neither relevant nor meaningful.\n\nNow, look at your Busyness Matrix, and look at each quadrant in this order:\n\n  * Irrelevant/Meaningless: Can you reduce or get rid of any of these?\n  * Irrelevant/Meaningful: Are you sure you don\u2019t have too many going on at the same time?\n  * Relevant/Meaningless: Can you delegate some of these?\n  * Relevant/Meaningful: Do you have enough time and energy for these?\n\nOnce you\u2019re done with the audit, you can make changes in your life and work to\nreclaim your time. However, don\u2019t try to tackle the quadrants all at once.\nStart eliminating as many irrelevant/meaningless tasks, and work your way up\nto making space for relevant/meaningful ones.\n\n## Getting Off the Hamster Wheel\n\nBreaking our addiction to busyness doesn\u2019t have to be hard, but it does\nrequire a conscious mindset shift. Having more free time is something we say\nwe want, but it\u2019s going against our deeply rooted fear of being alone with our\nthoughts and facing the reality of our lives. That\u2019s why it can be liberating,\nbut also pretty scary. Here are some simple changes you can implement:\n\n  1. Change your perspective. First, stop saying \u201cI don\u2019t have time\u201d. Instead, say \u201cIt\u2019s not a priority.\u201d Remind yourself that there is enough time in a day to do the things you care about.\n  2. Less doing, more achieving. Don\u2019t measure productivity in terms of how many tasks you get done, but rather in terms of doing the ones that matter. Clean up your to-do list. Shift your focus from tasks to outcomes.\n  3. Start saying no. Don\u2019t take stuff on just because someone asked you. Question whether this new task will translate into meaningful outcomes. It may be strange at first (you could say \u201cnot right now\u201d instead of \u201cno\u201d if that\u2019s easier) but it will help you better manage your time.\n  4. Make peace with inaction. To help you get comfortable with doing nothing, schedule time with yourself for dedicated downtime. Reflect or take a short walk.\n\nReclaiming your time to focus on what really matters can have a big impact on\nwhere you will be one year from now. All these moments we spend on irrelevant\nand meaningless tasks to avoid being alone with ourselves can be used for\nthinking, exciting work, or time spent with loved ones. It all adds up pretty\nquickly, so getting rid of the illusion of productivity is worth the initial\ndiscomfort of confronting our own thoughts.\n\n## Join 80,000 mindful makers!\n\nMaker Mind is a weekly newsletter with science-based insights on creativity,\nmindful productivity, better thinking and lifelong learning.\n\nOne email a week, no spam, ever.
