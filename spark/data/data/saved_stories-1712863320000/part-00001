I do believe that,\u201d Harris said on a call with reporters. \u201cWe know\nhow to prevent these tragedies, and it is a false choice to say you are either\nin favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone\u2019s guns away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, officials tasked the Bureau\nof Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for\nregulating the sales and licensing of firearms in the United States, with\ndeveloping rules that would make clear to gun owners how officials will\nimplement and enforce the new gun laws.\n\nThe rules clarify who is required to conduct background checks and aims to\nclose what is known as the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d \u2014 which refers to the reality\nthat gun-show sellers and online vendors are subject to much looser federal\nregulations than vendors who sell at bricks-and-mortar stores.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nUnder long-standing federal law, people who operate gun shops \u2014 or whose main\nlivelihood involves selling firearms \u2014 must register with the government to\nobtain a Federal Firearms License. This license requires them to search a\nfederal database before selling a gun to ensure that the purchaser is not\nbarred from owning one. The license also requires gun vendors to record the\nsale of each firearm, making it easier for federal officials to trace the gun\nif it is used in a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut people who claim that selling firearms is not their main source of income\n\u2014 such as people who sell guns at shows or in other more informal settings \u2014\nhave been exempt from such licensing rules. The 2022 law aimed to change that\nby saying that many more categories of people selling guns to earn money must\nregister for a license and, as a result, record gun purchases and conduct the\nbackground checks that come with having that license.\n\nThe rules require anyone who sells a firearm through mail order or at flea\nmarkets, gun shows or online to register for a license and conduct the\nnecessary background checks.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThere are some exceptions, including for hobbyists who are selling firearms\nfrom their collection and people who sell firearms they inherited.\n\nMany of Biden\u2019s gun-control efforts have been challenged by conservative\ngroups in court. These regulations are likely to face that same opposition,\nthough White House and Justice Department officials said they are confident\nthe rules align with the law and will withstand any legal challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnder this regulation, it will not matter if guns are sold on the internet,\nat a gun show or at a brick-and-mortar store: If you sell guns predominantly\nto earn a profit, you must be licensed, and you must conduct background\nchecks,\u201d Garland said. \u201cThis regulation is a historic step in the Justice\nDepartment\u2019s fight against gun violence. It will save lives.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe ATF issued the proposed version of the rules in August and opened them up\nto public comment for 90 days. Officials said they received nearly 400,000\ncomments, two-thirds of which were clearly in favor of the rules. A quarter of\nthe comments were decidedly against the proposal, the officials said, and\nother comments did not take a clear stance on the rules.\n\nThe final version of the rules did not contain substantial changes.\n\nIt is difficult to determine how many unlicensed dealers are selling firearms,\nbut officials said they expect the new rules to apply to about 23,000 dealers.\nThey said about 22 percent of Americans have obtained their guns without a\nbackground check \u2014 a figure that includes private transfers of ownership.\n\nThe ATF released a gun trafficking report last week that determined that the\ncountry\u2019s illegal firearm network is growing and said approximately 60 percent\nof users of trafficked firearms in cases that officials examined were\nconvicted felons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nPolitics\n\nReporting and analysis from the Hill and the White House\n\nAnalysis|Browbeating Jewish voters hasn\u2019t yet worked for Trump\n\nAnalysis|Arizona\u2019s abortion ban is a distinct danger for GOP\n\nAnalysis|Trump was the beneficiary, not the target, of 2016 and 2020\ninterference\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": true}
