So it\u2019s a good\nopportunity to go back to the 1940s and consider the contribution of someone\nwho knew and worked with members of the Manhattan project.\n\nI recently came across a film tribute to John von Neumann, made in 1966 by the\nMathematical Association of America. Grainy and noisy in its current YouTube\nincarnation, it\u2019s nonetheless riveting, with footage of von Neumann himself\nand contributions from friends and colleagues on the Manhattan Project\nincluding Stanislaw Ulam, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller.\n\nThe whole film is worth watching, but one moment grabbed my attention. Two-\nthirds of the way through, one of the contributors visits a store-room in the\nSmithsonian Institution in Washington and pulls the cover off a large object\nstored there.\n\nThe object is the IAS Machine and the man pulling off the covers is Herman\nGoldstine. The IAS Machine was an early \u2018stored program\u2019 computer, named after\nthe Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, where it was built over\n1946-51 under von Neumann\u2019s supervision.\n\nThe IAS Machine was organised according to the approach von Neumann had first\ndescribed in his 1945 paper \u2018First Draft of a report on the EDVAC\u2019. It was\nthis report that first set out what would become known as the von Neumann\narchitecture, which, of course, utterly dominates computing today.\n\nThe EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) referred to in the\n\u2018First Draft\u2019 report was intended to be the successor to the ENIAC (Electronic\nNumerical Integrator and Computer) the world\u2019s first programmable, electronic\ndigital computer1\n\nAnd it was Herman Goldstine who revealed von Neumann\u2019s ideas to the world.\n\nGoldstine had studied maths at the University of Chicago and then went on to\nteach at the University of Michigan. He joined the US Army in 1942 and was\nsoon employed at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland working on\ncalculations to support the aiming of artillery.\n\nThere Goldstine made his first vital contribution to the development of the\nmodern computer, by convincing the U.S Army to fund development of the ENIAC.\n\nHe first talked with von Neumann in August 1944 whilst waiting for a train,\nalthough he\u2019d previously heard him lecture at a symposium in Michigan.\n\nGoldstine later recalled:\n\n> I had never met this great mathematician. It was therefore with considerable\n> temerity that I approached this world-famous figure, introduced myself, and\n> started talking. Fortunately for me von Neumann was a warm, friendly person\n> who did his best to make people feel relaxed in his presence. The\n> conversation soon turned to my work. When it became clear to von Neumann\n> that I was concerned with the development of an electronic computer capable\n> of 333 multiplications per second, the whole atmosphere changed from one of\n> relaxed good humor to one more like the oral examination for a doctor\u2019s\n> degree in mathematics.\n\nGoldstine was soon working closely with von Neumann. He would be part of a\nsmall group including J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, who would work\ntogether on the development of ENIAC and explore ideas coming out of its\ndevelopment.\n\nOut of these explorations came von Neumann\u2019s handwritten \u2018First Draft\u2019 report.\nIt was Goldstine who had the report typed up and then helped to distribute it,\nactions that would have far-reaching consequences.\n\nGoldstine\u2019s comments in the film neatly sum up both the importance, and\nsimplicity, of the ideas in von Neumann\u2019s paper (my emphasis):\n\n> Narrator:\n>\n> During the period he was working in Los Alamos von Neumann became intensely\n> interested in computers Dr Herman Goldstine, now of the IBM corporation, was\n> one of his earliest collaborators in this work. In the spring of 1966 Dr\n> Goldstine was invited to visit a warehouse of the Smithsonian Institution in\n> Washington where the original Princeton computer is stored. He was\n> accompanied by Dr Utta Mertzebach of the Smithsonian staff.\n>\n> Goldstine:\n>\n> Well these things would have fascinated Johnny. He used to love toys. When\n> he worked on the on his automata theory at the beginning, he started since\n> he had to make three dimensional objects, he brought the biggest tinker toy\n> set that he could find, and he made the objects out of these until somebody\n> we showed him one time how to make these two dimensionally. So he was able\n> to give the tinker toys to Morgenstern's son.\n>\n> Mertzebach:\n>\n> Oh really?\n>\n> Goldstine:\n>\n> Yes. Well as Johnny would have said, mercy here it is. All these years. May\n> I move the curtain? Sure be glad to let's see what it looks like, if I can\n> do it. Very good, I succeeded.\n>\n> Yes. All right thank you.\n>\n> This machine was the concrete embodiment of von Neumann\u2019s very great ideas\n> and contributions which he has made to the electronic computer field.\n>\n> In 1946 Johnny asked me if I would join him at the end of the war in\n> Princeton and help him to carry out in concrete form the ideas which he had\n> been working on in 1944 and 1945.\n>\n> Of course I jumped at the chance. We rushed to Princeton and got started the\n> machine that eventuated from that is the one you see here and it contains\n> essentially those things which the modern computer has in it, although in\n> somewhat primitive form.\n>\n> This machine has stored program concept as its major feature and that in\n> fact is the thing which makes the modern computer revolution possible.

This new concept\n> has been carried so far today that programs are written involving tens of\n> millions of instructions whereas in those days of course nobody dreamed of\n> such complexity. But Johnny's idea made this basically possible.\n>\n> What is the stored program concept?

Presper Eckert, who had been chief\nengineer on the ENIAC project, would later dispute that attribution.\n\nIAS Machine created at Princeton Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war von Neumann and Goldstine would work together at Princeton\u2019s\nInstitute for Advanced Studies, where Robert Oppenheimer was director. There\nthey developed the IAS Machine.\n\nConstruction of the IAS Machine took longer than expected. William Aspray, in\nJohn von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing, writes:\n\n> The engineering challenges, especially in the design and construction of an\n> acceptable primary memory unit, were more difficult than originally\n> anticipated. The computer took almost twice as long as expected, nearly six\n> years to complete.\n\nThis delay would mean that the IAS Machine wasn't the first electronic\ncomputer built using von Neumann\u2019s approach.\n\nvon Neumann\u2019s \u2018First Draft\u2019 paper was distributed widely, including across the\nAtlantic. In Manchester in England, the ideas were central to the design of\nthe \u2018Manchester Baby\u2019 which ran its first program in June 1948.\n\nThe Manchester Baby was followed by the EDVAC itself, referred to in the title\nof von Neumann\u2019s report, which was delivered in 1949, but only became\noperational in 1951.\n\nThe IAS Machine was highly influential, though, and plans for its design were\ndistributed widely, partly due to von Neumann\u2019s insistence that advances be\nkept in the public domain. Many computers were built using the IAS Machine as\na starting point, including the first IBM Mainframe, the IBM 701.\n\nGoldstine himself went on to become IBM\u2019s technical director, overseeing the\ndevelopment of many of the IAS machines successors.\n\nThanks to the modern \u2018von Neumann machines\u2019 at YouTube, we can watch him\nunveil von Neumann\u2019s own embodiment of the modern computer again, twenty years\nafter he played a key role in making the world aware of von Neumann\u2019s\n\u2018tremendously simple\u2019 invention.\n\nAnd to return to Oppenheimer, the photo with Oppenheimer and von Neumann at\nthe top of this post, has them posing in front of, of course, the IAS Machine.\n\nBut we can put Goldstine back in the picture, where he surely belongs, in\nanother photo with Oppenheimer and von Neumann, again with the IAS Machine in\nthe background.\n\nJulian Bigelow, Herman Goldstine, Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann and the\nIAS Machine - By Ibigelow - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia\n\nHerman Goldstine played a key role in the invention the modern computer. Twice\nhe recognised the importance of the ideas of others, and then helped to ensure\nthat those ideas came to life.\n\nIf you value The Chip Letter, then please consider becoming a paid subscriber.\nYou\u2019ll get additional weekly content, learn more, and help keep this\nnewsletter going!\n\n1\n\nNote that the first version of the ENIAC doesn\u2019t count as a stored program\ncomputer although it was programmable. It was altered so as run a program\nstored in manually altered rotating switches and this version ran before the\nManchester Baby making it - according to some - the first operational stored\nprogram computer. The later version wasn't a von Neumann architecture machine\nas we use the term today.\n\n10 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Herman Goldstine and the IAS Machine: Unveiling the Modern Computer\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nNick E.Nick\u2019s Vital FewJul 31, 2023Liked by BabbageLove von Neumann! \ud83e\udd29Expand\nfull commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nDemystifying GPU Compute Architectures\n\nGetting 'low level' with Nvidia and AMD GPUs\n\nFeb 4 \u2022\n\nBabbage\n\n70\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Demystifying GPU Compute Architectures\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\n9\n\nGoogle's First Tensor Processing Unit : Architecture\n\nLooking in more detail at Google's first Tensor Processing Unit\n\nMar 24 \u2022\n\nBabbage\n\n38\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Google's First Tensor Processing Unit : Architecture\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\n5\n\nMoore on Moore\n\nWe look at the past, present and uncertain future of Moore's Law, with some\nhelp from Gordon Moore himself\n\nJan 21 \u2022\n\nBabbage\n\n38\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Moore on Moore\n\nthechipletter.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Chip Letter\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
