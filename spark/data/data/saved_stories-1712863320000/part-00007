I see that fire and, as a scientist, I know how much that hectare will\nlose in terms of individual lives, how much carbon will be emitted and how\nmuch the process accelerates climate changes,\u201d states Erika Berenguer, a\nBrazilian researcher at the University of Oxford. \u201cAt the same time, I lose a\npart of myself \u2014 my identity as a human being, as a scientist, is very tied\ninto it. It\u2019s in the soil, in the rainforest, walking in the forest every\nday.\u201d\n\nIn October of 2023, Berenguer began seeing large forest fires in the region\nnear the city of Santar\u00e9m in western Par\u00e1 state. It was a repeat of the\nscenario she witnessed in 2015 when the region suffered similar burns.\n\nAccording to her calculations in 2015, 2.5 billion trees died and the volume\nof carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere was greater than the emissions\nfrom entire nations including France and the United Kingdom. \u201cI\u2019m seeing\neverything happen all over again,\u201d states Berenguer, who had been diagnosed\nwith pneumonia brought on by smoke inhalation. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking into the\nfuture and thinking that this will happen more and more often. That megafires\nare not the exception. They will become the rule.\u201d\n\nSmoke from a megafire in the municipality of Belterra, in the state of Par\u00e1.\nImage courtesy of Marizilda Cruppe/RAS.\n\nTechnically defined as an enormous fire burning more than 100 square\nkilometers (38 square miles) of forest that occurs at the same time, in the\nsame region and under the same climatic conditions, a megafire doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily need to be continuous. There may be multiple fire outbreaks. And\nit so happens that, at least in theory, they shouldn\u2019t be happening in the\nhumid tropical rainforest.\n\nIn a biome characterized by its intense humidity and trees that grow more than\n50 meters (164 feet) in height, fire does not occur spontaneously. Usually\naccidental, forest fires in Amazonia are caused by uncontrolled small fires\nsuch as crop burning, livestock management (to clear pasture) or clear-cutting\n\u2014 this, which is almost always illegal, resulting from razing trees for new\npastureland, monoculture farming or real estate speculation. What is certain\nis that all types of fire in the Amazon Rainforest are anthropic, meaning\nhumans caused them.\n\nAccording to Lancaster University researcher Jos Barlow, there is more than\none type of forest fire. \u201cThere are wildfires when a forest burns for the\nfirst time: Usually it is low-burning, spreads slowly and can even be\ndifficult to detect via satellite. Yet it still has a great impact on the\nforest and kills many species adapted to that dark understory,\u201d explains\nBarlow, who has been working in Amazonia for two decades. \u201cAnd there are fires\n[that start] when the forest has already been degraded by selective logging or\na previous fire. These more degraded forests burn more intensely and the fire\nspreads faster.\u201d\n\nThe issue is that fires in Amazonia are unlike those in other biomes. In the\nBrazilian Cerrado, for example, the trees have thick bark and are more\nresistant. Many species manage to resprout after a fire. But Amazonian trees\nare covered in thinner bark that offers no resistance to fire. Forest fires\nleave scars in Amazonia. But what happens when the marks left in the\nrainforest are overproportional?\n\n### Megafires in the Brazilian Amazon\n\nSatellite imagery gathered by MapBiomas (1998, 2005 and 2015) and the NASA\nGoddard Space Flight Center Biospheric Sciences Lab (2023) show the scope of\nmegafires in different states in the Brazilian Amazon over the last 25 years\nand the conservation units most affected by the fires:\n\n  * 1998, Roraima state, 1,765 km2 (681 mi2), Roraima National Forest, Marac\u00e1 Ecological Station and the Yanomami Indigenous Territory;\n  * 2005, Acre state, 427 km2 (165 mi2), Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve;\n  * 2015, Maranh\u00e3o state, 2,200 km2 (850 mi2), Arariboia Indigenous Territory;\n  * 2015, Par\u00e1 state, 9,820 km2 (3,790 mi2), Tapaj\u00f3s National Forest and Tapaj\u00f3s-Arapiuns Extractive Reserve;\n  * 2023, Par\u00e1 state, 2,592 km2 (1,000 mi2), Flona Tapaj\u00f3s National Forest and Tapaj\u00f3s-Arapiuns Extractive Reserve.\n\n### Fire at the foot of the Andes\n\nIn December 2023, Douglas Morton, who runs NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight\nCenter\u2019s Biospheric Sciences Lab, met with Ambiental Media\u2019s geo-journalism\nteam. During the meeting, he shared images from his computer screen detailing\nthe multitude of fire outbreaks in the eastern part of Tapaj\u00f3s National Forest\nin the Santar\u00e9m region. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous area. We\u2019re talking about 2,000 km2\n[772 mi2] that have been burning for a month and a half.\u201d Researchers from the\nSustainable Amazonia Network [Rede Amaz\u00f4nia Sustent\u00e1vel] explain that the\nrainforest surrounding Santar\u00e9m and along the Bolivian border with the\nBrazilian states of Acre and Rond\u00f4nia are burning this year at such high\nproportions that it has been characterized as a megafire.\n\n\u201cThere are megafires burning in all the forests near the foot of the Andes in\nBolivia. Almost everything is on fire,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cTo get an idea, there is\none single fire covering 727 km2 [280 mi2]. This is just one fire, but it has\nrun together with several other enormous fires.\u201d\n\nAccording to scientists, megafires are a result of an El Ni\u00f1o year paired with\nthe driest period, causing the most severe drought seen in the last 40 years\nin Amazonia. The worsening effects of climate changes, rainforest degraded\nareas and low river and groundwater levels (like those seen in 2023)\ncontributed to the spread of wildfires.\n\nA stretch of the Amazon Rainforest in Par\u00e1 after a megafire in November 2023.\nImage courtesy of Marizilda Cruppe/RAS.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a drought year, both small farmers and large landowners lose\ncontrol of fires,\u201d says Liana Anderson, a researcher at the National Center\nfor Natural Disaster Monitoring and Early Warning [Centro Nacional de\nMonitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais] (CEMADEN). \u201cWe see a larger\npercentage of forests burned within large properties. This shows we have\nvulnerability in rural areas.\u201d\n\nAccording to CEMADEN data, the scenario will remain worrisome into 2024. El\nNi\u00f1o\u2019s effects that favor fires \u2014 a lower tendency for rainfall and higher\nthan average temperatures for the period \u2014 peaked in December 2023.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that this year is the most intense of all my years working in\nthis national forest, more intense than 2015 and 2016, which were the other El\nNi\u00f1o years,\u201d states Marcos Oliveira, a firefighter with ICMBio, the\nenvironment ministry\u2019s office overseeing protected areas who is currently\ncombating the wildfires in the Tapaj\u00f3s National Forest. \u201cWe managed to control\nsome burns, but in others we needed to call in brigades from outside to get\nthe job done.\u201d\n\nA cover article in Science magazine from the beginning of 2023 states that 38%\nof the Amazon Rainforest is degraded, meaning that it\u2019s already showing\ngradual loss of vegetation and no longer provides the same environmental\nservices as intact forest. This means that the Amazon is weakened and more\nvulnerable to recurring and extreme climate events, and also too dry to\nprevent fire from spreading.\n\n### Sick trees\n\nIn a well-preserved Amazonia, our feet make no sound as we walk through the\nforest, even during the dry season. Despite the dry weather, the litterfall \u2014\nthe layer of nonliving organic debris that accumulates on the forest floor \u2014\nremains moist. Such is not the case in a forest that has burned. \u201cWhen you\nwalk, you can hear the leaves: crunch, crunch, crunch,\u201d describes Barlow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive; a totally different experience. It\u2019s much drier, and the\nleaves and branches from trees that have already died make up a layer of fuel\nfor fires.\u201d\n\nThe first wildfire that passes through an area of the rainforest in Amazonia\ncan kill nearly half of the trees. For many subsequent years, the largest\ntrees continue to die because the fire has weakened them and they are more\nvulnerable to disease, fungi and termites. When they fall, they kill adjacent\nyoung trees in a sort of domino effect. So, one of the results, or scars, left\non the forest is that it becomes more open, like Swiss cheese, in Berenguer\u2019s\nwords.\n\nWhen observing the parts of the forest that burned just eight years ago during\nthe 2015 El Ni\u00f1o, Berenguer says, the landscape is different, with more so-\ncalled pioneer trees, which are the first to appear in degraded areas. \u201cThese\nare the trees that grow even in vacant lots; they\u2019ll grow anywhere. One is a\nvery common genus, the emba\u00fabas, which in the Tupi language means \u2018hollow\ntree.\u2019\u201d\n\nFire in the municipality of Belterra, Par\u00e1 state, in November 2023. Image\ncourtesy of Marizilda Cruppe/RAS.\n\nShe also comments that she has noticed a difference in the megafire burning\ntoday: It is burning vertically. \u201cIn these areas with many emba\u00fabas \u2014 the\nareas that burned in the last El Ni\u00f1o [2015] \u2014 we are seeing flames that at\ntimes reach 10 m (32 ft) in height. Apparently, the fire is traveling more\nrapidly and is larger than we had seen before, causing the deaths of even more\nindividuals.\u201d\n\nIt so happens that the fires have not been occurring exclusively in previously\nburned areas nor in areas directly related to clear-cutting. Researchers are\nconcerned that right now, any fire at all could quickly get out of control\nbecause the entire landscape is flammable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to point out that, in a year like 2023, we are seeing more\nforest fires in areas where there has been less deforestation,\u201d says Morton.\n\u201cThis is because fire is being widely used for other purposes.\u201d\n\nA study carried out in Acre shows that climate extremes previously felt in the\nregion at 50-year intervals are now felt every year. And many different events\nare happening every year. \u201cWe are having a collapse caused by many concurrent\nevents, each of which is greatly damaging,\u201d says Sonaira Silva, researcher at\nAcre Federal University.\n\nJust like this year, the 2015 Par\u00e1 megafire burned not only in areas that had\nundergone previous disturbances, but also in areas of intact rainforest.\nBerenguer says that 2015 was a window on a future reality, pointing out that\nfire knows no boundaries.\n\n### Keeping forests from burning\n\nSpecialists trust the fire watch data generated in Brazil. Aside from\ngovernment data, some private and third-sector organizations are also working\nto observe the situation. \u201cThe geotechnical work being done at institutions\nthat are developing monitoring systems is quite commendable,\u201d states Anderson.\n\nThe more specific the data, the better they are for creating prevention\npolicies. Anderson mentions the Amazonia Fire Calendar, containing data on the\ntime of year in which each region in the Amazon becomes more vulnerable to\nfire. \u201cThis type of information is very important for policy planning and\ndecision-making,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, preventing fires continues to be a challenge because most of the\nfunding is allocated to fighting already existing fires. Specialists say\nemployees should be hired to exclusively monitor satellite imagery so that\nreaction times can be reduced when a fire breaks out. \u201cFirefighting is part of\nit, but it\u2019s not the solution in and of itself. It\u2019s a bandage that falls off\nthe first time anyone starts to sweat,\u201d says Barlow. \u201cWe must find ways to\nkeep the forests from catching fire in the first place.\u201d\n\nAn even more effective prevention tool would be the sort of work done by\nJoaquim Parim\u00e9, head of the IBAMA Environmental Emergency and Forest Fire\nNucleus in Roraima. Since 2015, Parim\u00e9 has been developing work with\nIndigenous communities that focuses on integrated fire management, prescribed\nburning, controlled burning and creating firebreaks in strategic microsystems.\nAnd wildfires have ceased in the locations where the project was put in place.\n\n\u201cThe results have been very encouraging in the regions belonging to Indigenous\npeople. These populations have revived ancestral uses of fire to manage their\nlandscapes. They use fire to maintain the ecosystem, they use fire as a tool\nto preserve. They use good fire, benevolent fire, fire that protects.\u201d\n\nFirefighting in Belterra, Par\u00e1 sate. Image courtesy of Marizilda Cruppe/RAS.\n\nJoice Ferreira is a researcher at Embrapa Eastern Amazon and the co-author of\na document delivered to the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change\nthat aims to improve the policies included in the Plan of Action for\nDeforestation Prevention and Control in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). She also\nsuggests that an emergency fund to prevent and fight fires in extremely dry\nyears should be created.\n\n\u201cThe fund could provide funding in critical regions so they [family farmers]\ndon\u2019t plant their gardens. It would protect the area, a sort of food grant\nduring a season when families weren\u2019t allowed to plant crops,\u201d the biologist\nsuggests. \u201cOnce a fire spreads, it\u2019s much more difficult to contain and\ncreates enormous costs, both environmentally and socially.\u201d\n\nMegafires are hard to fight. Aside from being voluminous, they spread through\nparts of the forest with limited access. Sometimes they are only really\nextinguished when the rainy season comes around again. \u201cWe are in the field\nall the time. Four days of rain is no help; a day later, everything is dry\nagain and catching fire,\u201d says Ralph Cohen, head of the ICMBio firefighting\nbrigade in the Tapaj\u00f3s National Forest. \u201cThere are many Indigenous areas, many\ncommunities. We are working to protect these areas. And the fire this year was\nvery intense. Very, very intense.\u201d\n\nCohen says he fears losing the rainforest more than he fears fire. Snakes,\nsloths, coatis and tortoises are the animals he most finds in agony. \u201cWe find\nmany, many animals. We find them trying to run away, dead, injured. It\u2019s\nheartbreaking.\u201d\n\n> People and nature suffer as historic drought fuels calamitous Amazon fires\n\nThis story was first published in Portuguese by Ambiental Media and produced\nin partnership with the Sustainable Amazon Network (RAS).\n\nBanner image of a megafire in western Par\u00e1 state in November 2023.
