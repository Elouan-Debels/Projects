The company\u2019s co-CEO Ladi Delano said Moove will become fully profitable by the next financial year.\n  * Moove is also pushing for EVs, as they have lower maintenance costs, lower fuel costs, and get government subsidies in some markets.\n\nAfter clocking losses for over four years, one of Africa\u2019s most-funded\nstartups is betting on non-African markets to turn profitable.\n\nMoove, Uber\u2019s largest vehicle financing partner in the world, has raised $176\nmillion over the last 12 months to support its business in India and the U.K.\nand for launching in the UAE.\n\nIndustry experts believe Moove will be able to earn better margins in its new\nmarkets, but it will need to navigate one major challenge that has haunted its\nAfrica business: pushback from gig drivers.\n\n\u201cThe cost of transportation in [Africa] ... has increased drastically,\u201d\nCharles Asenime, professor of transport and logistics at Lagos State\nUniversity, told Rest of World. \u201cDrivers have to spend more to earn a little\nthese days, and that is affecting their ability to remit. Looking outside the\ncountry\u2019s shore for a company like Moove might be a better option [for]\nturning profits.\u201d\n\nJust last month, Moove said it had raised $100 million in a funding round led\nby Uber. This was the fifth time the company raised capital in the last three\nyears.\n\nMoove co-founder and co-CEO Ladi Delano told Rest of World that the company is\nset to achieve profitability by the next financial year. \u201cToday, we are\nprofitable in ... UAE, India, U.K., and South Africa,\u201d Delano said.\n\nThe company did not share details of its scale in these countries. \u201cMoove\ncannot divulge any additional figures beyond what has already been shared, nor\ndetails about its proprietary business model, to preserve its competitive\nedge,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nMoove was founded in 2020 and started with Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa.\nThe company allows drivers to get cars and pay for them in daily installments\nfrom the income they make by driving for Uber. Since its launch, Moove has\nsigned up over 20,000 drivers, the majority of whom are in Lagos.\n\nMoove has struggled to turn profitable so far because of the costs associated\nwith buying vehicles in Africa, Adeniyi Adebayo, chief business officer at\nmobility company Yango, told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cYou have lots of import duties on new cars, limiting how cheaply you can get\nnew cars into most African markets,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cHence, banks are rightly\nskeptical about expanding their loan books to include \u2018problematic\u2019 consumer\nsegments of taxi drivers.\u201d\n\nMoove has faced severe backlash from gig drivers who often struggle to pay\ntheir installments, due to low income. In February 2023, Moove drivers in\nLagos protested unfavorable repayment terms and the impounding of vehicles by\nthe company. Moove told Rest of World that the drivers\u2019 displeasure is a\nresult of \u201cunprecedented economic challenges\u201d in Nigeria.\n\nBut drivers in India have had a similar experience.\n\nMumbai-based Uber driver Karamjeet Singh procured a vehicle via Moove in\nJanuary last year, and another one for his son in August. But both the\nvehicles were impounded by Moove in August when the duo failed to pay their\ninstallments as they took a 12-day break from work to attend to a family\nemergency. \u201cWithout any notice or informing me, they confiscated my car from\noutside my house,\u201d Singh told Rest of World.\n\nSingh had to pay 5,500 rupees ($65.97) per week for each car for four years,\nafter which the car would be his. Moove did not refund the money that Singh\nand his son had paid until the vehicles were impounded, costing them nearly\n200,000 rupees ($2,390.61). \u201cWe paid a security deposit of 65,000 rupees, and,\nfor around seven months, we made weekly payments. They should have refunded us\nthe amount,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch cases happen to \u201cless than 5% of Moove\u2019s Indian customer base,\u201d Binod\nMishra, the company\u2019s India regional manager, told Rest of World.\n\nMoove gives all drivers up to eight weeks to pay their outstanding\ninstallments, co-CEO Delano said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to understand that\nbefore vehicles get recovered or impounded, there\u2019s a long process that is\nvery delicately managed to ensure that we support our customers to get back on\nthe road and to start generating revenue, rather than take the vehicle,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nMoove can overcome such challenges if it moves to electric cars, Adebayo said.\n\u201cLower maintenance costs, lesser fuel costs, and, in a lot of cases, access to\ngovernment subsidies make EVs important for Moove\u2019s new market,\u201d he said.\n\nMoove is already moving in this direction.\n\nIn the U.K. and the UAE, the company offers EVs to drivers, Delano said. The\ncompany is also building charging infrastructure in the UAE and has started\nexperimenting with EVs in India.\u201cWhen you hit your growth stage as a company,\nyou want to expand to diversify risk because there are just some things that\nare outside of your control,\u201d Adetayo Bamiduro, co-founder of mobility startup\nMAX, told Rest of World. \u201cIf you are in three to six markets, it provides some\nlevel of diversification. If something happens in markets A, B, or C, you\nstill have other markets that are performing well.\u201d\n\nUpdate: This piece has been updated to include Moove's comments about the\nscale of its business in UAE, India, the U.K., and South Africa.\n\nSultan Quadri is a freelance journalist based in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nDamilare Dosunmu is a Rest of World reporter based in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nSanghamitra Kar contributed reporting from Bangalore, India.\n\nRead more stories\n\n3 Minutes With\n\nThe YouTube co-founder connecting Taiwan with Silicon Valley\n\nSteve Chen on the strengths and weaknesses of Taiwan in cultivating tech\nstartups.\n\nBy Viola Zhou\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nWhat Elon Musk doesn\u2019t understand about Brazil\n\nYou can\u2019t fight for free speech in Bras\u00edlia from Texas.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\nRegional Champions\n\nIn Southeast Asia, Ramadan is an online shopping bonanza\n\nAn e-commerce battle brews between Shopee, Lazada and TikTok Shop with the\ncontinued rise of livestream selling.\n\nBy Adi Renaldi and Chong Pooi Koon\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
