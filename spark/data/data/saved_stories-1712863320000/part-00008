Calhoun to describe\na collapse in behavior that can result from overpopulation. The term and\nconcept derive from a series of over-population experiments Calhoun conducted\non Norway rats between 1958 and 1962.^[1] In the experiments, Calhoun and his\nresearchers created a series of \"rat utopias\" \u2013 enclosed spaces where rats\nwere given unlimited access to food and water, enabling unfettered population\ngrowth. Calhoun coined the term \"behavioral sink\" in a February 1, 1962,\nScientific American article titled \"Population Density and Social Pathology\"\non the rat experiment.^[2] He would later perform similar experiments on mice,\nfrom 1968 to 1972.\n\nCalhoun's work became used as an animal model of societal collapse, and his\nstudy has become a touchstone of urban sociology and psychology in\ngeneral.^[3]\n\n## Experiments[edit]\n\nIn the 1962 study, Calhoun described the behavior as follows:\n\n> Many [female rats] were unable to carry the pregnancy to full term or to\n> survive delivery of their litters if they did. An even greater number, after\n> successfully giving birth, fell short in their maternal functions. Among the\n> males the behavior disturbances ranged from sexual deviation to cannibalism\n> and from frenetic overactivity to a pathological withdrawal from which\n> individuals would emerge to eat, drink and move about only when other\n> members of the community were asleep. The social organization of the animals\n> showed equal disruption. ...\n>\n> The common source of these disturbances became most dramatically apparent in\n> the populations of our first series of three experiments, in which we\n> observed the development of what we called a behavioral sink. The animals\n> would crowd together in greatest number in one of the four interconnecting\n> pens in which the colony was maintained. As many as 60 of the 80 rats in\n> each experimental population would assemble in one pen during periods of\n> feeding. Individual rats would rarely eat except in the company of other\n> rats. As a result extreme population densities developed in the pen adopted\n> for eating, leaving the others with sparse populations.\n>\n> ... In the experiments in which the behavioral sink developed, infant\n> mortality ran as high as 96 percent among the most disoriented groups in the\n> population.^[2]\n\nCalhoun's early experiments with rats were carried out on farmland at\nRockville, Maryland, starting in 1947.^[4]\n\nWhile Calhoun was working at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in\n1954, he began numerous experiments with rats and mice. During his first\ntests, he placed around 32 to 56 rats in a 10-by-14-foot (3.0 m \u00d7 4.3 m) cage\nin a barn in Montgomery County. He separated the space into four rooms. Every\nroom was specifically created to support a dozen matured brown Norwegian rats.\nRats could maneuver between the rooms by using the ramps. Since Calhoun\nprovided unlimited resources, such as water, food, and also protection from\npredators as well as from disease and weather, the rats were said to be in\n\"rat utopia\" or \"mouse paradise\", another psychologist explained.^[5]\n\nFollowing his earlier experiments with rats, Calhoun later created his\n\"Mortality-Inhibiting Environment for Mice\" in 1968: a 101-by-101-inch (260 cm\n\u00d7 260 cm) cage for mice with food and water replenished to support any\nincrease in population,^[6] which took his experimental approach to its\nlimits. In his most famous experiment in the series, \"Universe 25\", population\npeaked at 2,200 mice even though the habitat was built to tolerate a total\npopulation of 4000. Having reached a level of high population density, the\nmice began exhibiting a variety of abnormal, often destructive, behaviors\nincluding refusal to engage in courtship, and females abandoning their young.\nBy the 600th day, the population was on its way to extinction. Though\nphysically able to reproduce, the mice had lost the social skills required to\nmate.^[4]\n\nCalhoun retired from NIMH in 1984, but continued to work on his research\nresults until his death on September 7, 1995.^[7]\n\n## Explanation[edit]\n\nThe specific voluntary crowding of rats to which the term \"behavioral sink\"\nrefers is thought to have resulted from the earlier involuntary crowding:\nindividual rats became so used to the proximity of others while eating that\nthey began to associate feeding with the company of other rats. Calhoun\neventually found a way to prevent this by changing some of the settings and\nthereby decreased mortality somewhat, but the overall pathological\nconsequences of overcrowding remained.^[8]\n\nFurther, researchers argued that \"Calhoun's work was not simply about density\nin a physical sense, as number of individuals-per-square-unit-area, but was\nabout degrees of social interaction.\"^[9] \"Social density\" appears to be key.\n\n## Applicability to humans[edit]\n\nSee also: Model organism\n\nCalhoun had phrased much of his work in anthropomorphic terms, in a way that\nmade his ideas highly accessible to a lay audience.^[4]\n\nCalhoun himself saw the fate of the population of mice as a metaphor for the\npotential fate of humankind. He characterized the social breakdown as a\n\"spiritual death\",^[6] with reference to bodily death as the \"second death\"\nmentioned in the Biblical verse Revelation 2:11.^[6]\n\nControversy exists over the implications of the experiment. Psychologist\nJonathan Freedman's experiment recruited high school and university students\nto carry out a series of experiments that measured the effects of density on\nhuman behavior. He measured their stress, discomfort, aggression,\ncompetitiveness, and general unpleasantness. He declared to have found no\nappreciable negative effects in 1975.^[10]\n\nThe 1962 Scientific American article came at a time when overpopulation had\nbecome a subject of great public interest, and had a considerable cultural\ninfluence.^[11] However, such discussions often oversimplified the original\nfindings in various ways. It should however be noted that the work has a more\ndifferentiated message than, for example, Paul Ehrlich's now widely\ndisputed^[12]^[13]^[14] book The Population Bomb. Calhoun's worries primarily\nconcerned a human population surge as an early stage, such as even more so a\npotentially independent increase in urbanization, soon after rendering much of\na given society functionally sterile. Here, one moves from some modality of\nover- towards a much more irredeemable underpopulation. Now, while urban\npopulations have long been noted to have lower fertility than their rural\ncounterparts,^[15] growing use of especially digital media is likely to end up\ndepressing rural population growth as well.^[16] And while this, today, still\nprimarily concerns elite population decline, as some find highly deleterious\nin itself,^[17] the aforementioned modalities of positive feedback in social\ndiffusion may have Calhoun's empirical predictions apply to a much wider\nsegment of society as well. For one, all this seems to hold up in the case of\nSouth Korea's unsustainably low total fertility rate, having already led to\nsocietal aging comparable with Calhoun's final cohort.\n\nFurthermore, an analogous decline in sexual interest and activity has been\nobserved globally,^[18] in particular as a function of socio-economic status\nand gender.^[19]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Proxemics\n  * Decadence\n  * Population decline\n  * Overpopulation\n  * Dysgenics\n  * Welfare state\n  * Hikikomori\n  * Incel\n  * Tang ping\n  * Rat Park\n  * Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\n  * Stand on Zanzibar\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Hall, Edward, T.
