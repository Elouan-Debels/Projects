Thermal\nenergy networks have been installed in Rochester\u2019s city hall and will be\nextended to a library and civic center to create a system serving more than\none million square feet. Carleton College built a networked geothermal system\nand The Heights, a development on St. Paul\u2019s East Side where more than 1,000\npeople will live and another 1,000 will work, will be heated and cooled by a\nnetworked thermal system.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement building around networked geothermal,\u201d said Luke\nGaalswyk, president and CEO of St. Paul-based Ever-Green Energy, a utility\nsystem operator and advisor with an expertise in district energy.\n\nThe state\u2019s two major gas utilities, Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy,\nincluded networked geothermal pilots in plans submitted under the Natural Gas\nInnovation Act to the Public Utilities Commission. At least one legislative\ninitiative calls for devoting 15% of the Innovation Act budget to networked\ngeothermal. The federal government has several initiatives underway, too.\n\nJoe Dammel, managing director for buildings at policy nonprofit Fresh Energy,\nsaid the state\u2019s goal of becoming net zero by 2050 means shifting away from\nnatural gas for heating.\n\n\u201cWe think that there\u2019s tremendous potential from network geothermal,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe studies being considered and the number of bills at the Legislature right\nnow are only going to help us understand the technical and economic potential\nof geothermal.\u201d\n\nFresh Energy also publishes the Energy News Network.\n\nThe proposed laws encourage geothermal in a variety of ways. One (HF 4759/SF\n4849) offers planning grants to cities, counties and planning agencies to\nexamine the feasibility of geothermal systems. A second (HF 4689/SF 4686)\ncreates rebates related to geothermal. A third (HF 4688/SF 4687) requires the\nPublic Utilities Commission to set up a workgroup. A fourth (HF 4423 / SF\n4760) builds a framework for thermal energy network pilots and instructs the\nCommerce Department to study the potential for geothermal networks in\nMinnesota.\n\nState Rep. Larry Kraft, a co-author on several of the bills, said buildings in\nMinnesota represent around 40% of carbon emissions and more than 60% in his\nsuburban community of St. Louis Park. He believes municipalities that receive\ngrants for geothermal and build systems will demonstrate, by example, the\ntechnology\u2019s ability to decarbonize heating.\n\nKraft said ground-source systems, while expensive, are more efficient at\nheating than air source heat pumps. New developments may be easier to build\nwith geothermal energy, or when streets are being reconstructed, neighborhoods\ncould be retrofitted for it.\n\nHe imagines utilities that distribute natural gas will move to operating\ngeothermal networks someday.\n\n\u201cHow we decarbonize heating is going to be a big challenge for us here in a\ncold climate, but geothermal has great potential,\u201d Kraft said.\n\nGeothermal of any sort, however, remains expensive because the most common\napplication, ground-source systems, requires drilling hundreds of boreholes\nand installing significant amounts of piping. There aren\u2019t many contractors\nwho can do this job, and financing institutions have little familiarity with\nit. Utilities may remain skittish because it threatens the natural gas\nbusiness model.\n\nAdvocates believe more adoption will drop costs, create a robust contractor\npool and enable more financing. Minnesota\u2019s new Climate Innovation Finance\nAuthority appears poised to be a potential financing source, having just\nprovided $4.7 million for planning a networked geothermal for The Heights\ndevelopment in St. Paul.\n\n### What is networked geothermal?\n\nNetworked geothermal systems serve several buildings or homes with centralized\nheat or cooling using the same principle as district energy systems. A central\nheating and cooling source \u2014 typically borefields or aquifers \u2014 to serve many\nbuildings while employing economies of scale to decrease costs through shared\ninfrastructure.\n\nTrade unions view networked geothermal as increasing employment opportunities\nfor pipefitters and other contractors. Gas utilities could potentially\ntransition toward geothermal as fossil fuel demand diminishes, Dammel said.\n\nClean energy advocates meanwhile like geothermal\u2019s efficiency and ability to\noperate on electricity for heating instead of natural gas or propane.\nLawmakers see thermal systems as providing a path to meeting the state\u2019s goal\nof being net zero by 2050, Kraft added.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes thermal networks by offering tax\ncredits and direct reimbursements to government agencies and nonprofits.\n\n\u201cThe [IRA] is contributing to an explosion in interest and adoption of\ngeothermal,\u201d said Ryan Dougherty, president of the Geothermal Exchange\nOrganization.\n\nSchools and other nonprofits can now receive 30% to 50% of the installed cost\nof a geothermal system, Doughtery said. The surge in commercial and\ninstitutional installations has grown so significantly that the industry has\nbegun to face a labor shortage.\n\n### Geothermal\u2019s advantages\n\nFor the electric grid, networked thermal systems could bring relief because\nthey use substantially less electricity than competitive solutions. Ground\nsource heat pumps operate more efficiently than air source heat pumps, which\nnow outsell fossil gas furnaces. And although ground source heat pumps use\nelectricity, they consume less energy than heating alternatives, Gaalswyk\nsaid.\n\nSuch systems could even tap sources such as waste heat from wastewater\nfacilities or data centers to warm buildings, he said. Another benefit is the\nability to shift heat on a sunny day from a south-facing building, for\nexample, to a north-facing one needing it.\n\nAudrey Schulman, co-founder and co-executive director of the nonprofit climate\nsolutions incubator HEET, said utilities with networked geothermal can begin\nheating water a week before an expected cold snap to avoid stressing the\nsystem \u2014 for instance, taking advantage of excess electricity from wind farms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different options available,\u201d Schulman said.\n\n### The role of utilities\n\nMassachusetts has required utilities to direct a growing percentage of funding\nallotted for replacing natural gas piping to networked geothermal, Schulman\nsaid. The fastest way to move away from natural gas and toward geothermal, she\nargues, will be by maintaining the financial health of natural gas utilities.\n\nUtilities would socialize the cost of the capital expenditures to networked\ngeothermal and then potentially pay it off by charging customers for the\noperations and maintenance, depending on the size of their homes or\nbusinesses.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s quite figured out how the charges will be structured,\u201d she said.\n\nDammel said natural gas utilities have a long history of innovation and\nchanging their business models. Initially, they provided natural gas for\nstreetlighting before transitioning to a delivery service for natural gas.\n\n\u201cWe certainly see that gas utilities could play a significant role in\nproviding heat to customers and maintaining that longstanding customer\nrelationship gas utilities have with their customers,\u201d Dammel said.\n\n### Obstacles and opportunities\n\nDammel and Schulman say regulators, utilities and others will face inevitable\nchallenges in moving thermal systems into the mainstream. One is getting\nutilities onboard. Schulman said one Massachusetts utility, Eversource, fully\nembraces networked geothermal as the future, while others have taken a wait-\nand-see approach.\n\nDammel said utilities and clients must learn through pilots the upfront costs\nof the systems and how they could save money over time. Helping state\nresidents and lawmakers understand the potential for networked geothermal and\nhow it could benefit communities will be another task, he said.\n\nDeveloping a geothermal workforce remains critical to growth. Minnesota has\nexisting tradespeople capable of building geothermal systems, but the\npotential to create a much bigger workforce remains, Dammel said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity,\u201d he said, not only for installers but for\ncompanies developing new geothermal technology, financing, design and other\naspects of the business.\n\nSchulman agrees. Contractors drilling boreholes for geothermal in\nMassachusetts have become \u201covertaxed\u201d with all the projects underway. The\nadoption speed will increase once regulators, utilities, and customers see the\nadvantages.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any reason a customer would not want lower heating and\ncooling bills,\u201d she said.\n\nLegislative committees have heard several of the geothermal bills.
