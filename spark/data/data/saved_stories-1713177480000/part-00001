They can slice and dice data and build\npredictive models.\n\n###\n\nMarketing\n\nData Scientists have a memory muscle developed that helps them analyze the\ndata in all forms and sorts. Marketing at the moment is largely intuition and\nexperience driven. Data scientists in an organization can analyze the\ncampaigns data analytically to figure out rules that can improve the campaigns\nperformance. In my experience as a data scientist and a founder, we were able\nto reverse engineer the Instagram algorithms rules governing our target\naudience by consistently studying time during which the post was being\nadvertised, time of post, length of post, colors, palette as well as language.\nI was able to achieve the CPM cost INR 9. For the Indian audience the cost\nhovers between INR 8 to INR 12. This was when the target audience was hard to\ntarget, that is, women interested in finance. Moreover, I believed it was\npossible to bring the cost down further as more data was collected and\nconsequently analyzed.\n\n###\n\nCustomer Success and Service\n\nWe all are aware how ChatGPT is the new customer service agent. But data\nscientists working on customer service data and tickets are in a unique\nposition to understand and analyze the data. When given unfettered access to\ncustomer data, data scientists can champion your customers on the table along\nwith the customer success team. Most Data science teams work in an environment\nthat impeds data scientists in voicing their analysis of the customer\nbehavior. By my own experience, a quick analysis of customer behavior based on\nthe device usage and analysis of tickets by multiple techniques can accelerate\nthe customer understanding, recurrent behaviors etc that customer success team\nneeds. Customer success team can read data, but when data runs into GigaBytes\nor more, this becomes hard. Along with the customer success team, the data\nscience team can meaningfully contribute to decision making at strategy level.\n\n###\n\nProduct\n\nIn product, there has always been a hype on how product managers need to be\ndata oriented. At the cost of repeating myself, I would say data scientists\nare really exposed to customer data through the funnel. While product managers\nwill often see mixpanel as a means to understand the funnel and customer\nbehavior. I have first hand experienced the horrors of how easy it is to\nunknowingly mess up the mixpanel implementation in the background.\nConsequently, a data scientist, with his SQL skills can query the database and\nidentify flaws in the funnel, actively participate with product managers to\nanalyze and form a hypothesis and validate it further on.\n\n##\n\nHow can you modify your selection process to hire a \u201cBusiness\u201d data scientist\n?\n\nCurrently, data scientists/ML professionals are completely siloed into a box\nwhere they are only evaluated on the basis of algorithms they have mastered.\nIt should be mandated top down that business understanding is evaluated in the\nprospective candidates. While interviewing, candidates can be tested\nextensively on feature engineering where they can be given the opportunity to\nshow the domain knowledge they have acquired or their ability to think out of\nthe algorithmic pigeon-hole.\n\nAt the end I would summarize it by saying the following:\n\n  1. Give Data science team a seat at the table, they are the ones closest to data and consequently your customers.\n\n  2. Data science can have an impact on multiple aspects of the business, leverage that skill. They aren\u2019t your bloated cost centers; don\u2019t treat them as one.\n\n  3. Business Data science is what you need more. Data Scientists who pigeonhole themselves into the world of algorithms and don\u2019t learn anything about the business is not what you want. Atleast, not the full team needs to be super specialized; a mix is good.\n\n  4. For the data science community too, it\u2019s necessary to come out of the algorithmic pigeon hole and learn business so that they can have greater impact on the organization and more importantly be seen as \u201cvalue\u201d centers; not expensive cost centers.\n\nThanks for reading Build Startup In Public !
