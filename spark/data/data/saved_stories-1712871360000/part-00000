Now, with a deeper understanding\nand having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,\u201d Cardell\nsaid.\n\n\u201cThe essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting\ntechnology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential\nexploitation of market power and unintended consequences. We\u2019re committed to\napplying the principles we have developed, and to using all legal powers at\nour disposal, now and in the future, to ensure that this transformational and\nstructurally critical technology delivers on its promise.\u201d\n\nThe six identified by the CMA are Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Apple and\nNvidia, the leading supplier of chips for training and using AI. Their\ninvolvement in more than 90 partnerships and investments, the CMA said, could\nlimit diversity and choice in the market.\n\nThe \u201cwinner takes all\u201d dynamics of digital markets led to the dominance of a\nfew powerful platforms, Cardell said, and she was \u201cdetermined to apply the\nlessons of history\u201d to prevent the same thing from happening again.\n\nHighlighting three \u201cinterlinked\u201d risks, Cardell said that competition in the\nAI sector could be harmed by companies that control critical inputs, from data\nto chips, restricting access to shield themselves from competition; companies\nusing their market power to distort choice in AI services; and partnerships\nbetween key players exacerbating concentrations of market power.\n\nThe CMA first announced its plans to investigate the market in AI foundation\nmodels in May 2023. The initial review, published in September, found that\npeople should not expect the technology to have a positive outcome in the\nworld at large.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
