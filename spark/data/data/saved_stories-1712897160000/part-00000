Maine\nis already learning how hard that can be.\n\nBy Zo\u00eb Schlanger\n\nHilxia Szabo / Gallery Stock\n\nApril 11, 2024, 2:35 PM ET\n\nCordelia Saunders remembers 2021, the year she and her husband, Nathan, found\nout that they\u2019d likely been drinking tainted water for more than 30 years. A\nneighbor\u2019s 20 peach trees had finally matured that summer, and perfect-looking\npeaches hung from their branches. Cordelia watched the fruit drop to the\nground and rot: Her neighbor didn\u2019t dare eat it.\n\nThe Saunderses\u2019 home, in Fairfield, Maine, is in a quiet, secluded spot, 50\nminutes from the drama of the rocky coast and an hour and 15 minutes from the\nbest skiing around. It\u2019s also sitting atop a plume of poison.\n\nFor decades, sewage sludge was spread on the corn fields surrounding their\nhouse, and on hundreds of other fields across the state. That sludge is\nsuspected to have been tainted with PFAS, a group of man-made compounds that\ncause a litany of ailments, including kidney and prostate cancers, fertility\nloss, and developmental disorders. The Saunderses\u2019 property is on one of the\nmost contaminated roads in a state just waking up to the extent of an\ninvisible crisis.\n\nOnur Apul, an environmental engineer at the University of Maine and the head\nof its initiative to study PFAS solutions, told me that in his opinion, the\nUnited States has seen \u201cnothing as overwhelming, and nothing as universal\u201d as\nthe PFAS crisis. Even the DDT crisis of the 1960s doesn\u2019t compare, he said:\nDDT was used only as an insecticide and could be banned by banning that single\nuse. PFAS are used in hundreds of products across industries and consumer\nsectors. Their nearly 15,000 variations can help make pans nonstick, hiking\nclothes and plumber\u2019s tape waterproof, and dental floss slippery. They\u2019re in\nperformance fabrics on couches, waterproof mascara, tennis rackets, ski wax.\nDestroying them demands massive inputs of energy: Their fluorine-carbon bond\nis the single most stable bond in organic chemistry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reality for everyone; it\u2019s just a matter of whether they know about\nit,\u201d Apul said. As soon as any place in the U.S. does look squarely at PFAS,\nit will find the chemicals lurking in the blood of its constituents\u2014in one\nreport, 97 percent of Americans registered some level\u2014and perhaps also in\ntheir water supply or farm soils. And more will have to look: Yesterday the\nBiden administration issued the first national PFAS drinking-water standards\nand gave public drinking-water systems three years to start monitoring them.\nThe EPA expects thousands of those systems to have PFAS levels above the new\nstandards, and to take actions to address the contamination. Maine is one step\nahead in facing PFAS head-on\u2014but also one step ahead in understanding just how\nhard that is.\n\nCordelia and Nathan both remember the dump trucks rumbling up the road. They\u2019d\nstop right across the street every year and disgorge a black\nslurry\u2014fertilizer, the Saunderses assumed at the time, that posed no\nparticular bother. Now they know that the state approved spreading 32,900\ncubic yards of sewage sludge\u2014or more than 2,000 dump-truck loads\u2014within a\nquarter mile of their house, and that the sludge came in large part from a\nlocal paper company. Now they wonder about that slurry.\n\nMaine has a long, proud history as a papermaking state and a long, tortured\nhistory with the industry\u2019s toxic legacy, most notably from dioxin. In the\n1960s, another group of compounds\u2014per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or\nPFAS\u2014began to be used in the papermaking process. The chemicals were miracle\nworkers: A small amount of PFAS could make paper plates and food containers\nboth grease-proof and water-resistant.\n\nThen, in the \u201980s, the state encouraged spreading sewage sludge on fields as\nfertilizer, a seemingly smart use of an otherwise cumbersome by-product of\nliving, hard to manage in a landfill. In principle, human manure can sub in\nfor animal manure without much compromise. But in reality, sludge often\ncontains a cocktail of chemical residues. \u201cWe concentrate them in sludge and\nthen spread them over where we grow food. The initial idea is not great,\u201d Apul\ntold me. The Saunderses first found out that the sludge-spreading had\ncontaminated their water after the state found high PFAS levels in milk from a\ndairy farm two miles away. Maine\u2019s limit for six kinds of PFAS was 20 parts\nper trillion; state toxicologists found so much in the Saunderses\u2019 well water\nthat when Nathan worked out the average of all the tests taken in 2021, it\ncame to 14,800 parts per trillion, he told me.\n\nNathan used to work as an engineer for Maine\u2019s drinking-water-safety program,\nand he quickly pieced together the story of their street\u2019s contamination and\njust how bad it was. After state researchers tested their blood, Nathan\nremembers, a doctor told him that his levels of one PFAS were so high, they\nhad hit the maximum the test could reliably report\u20142,000 micrograms per liter.\nSo far, he\u2019s healthy, but he feels like he\u2019s living on borrowed time. Diseases\nrelated to environmental exposures can take decades to emerge, and although\nstudies show that PFAS may degrade health at a population level, why some\nindividuals fall ill and others don\u2019t isn\u2019t always clear. Cordelia told me\nthat the neighbor who wouldn\u2019t eat the peaches is now on three medications for\nhigh cholesterol (which has been linked to PFAS), and that other neighbors\nhave bladder or brain cancer.\n\nCordelia\u2019s PFAS blood levels were lower than Nathan\u2019s\u2014but still high enough to\nmake the Saunderses rethink the past decade of their life. In 2010, when she\nwas an otherwise healthy and active 50-year-old, Cordelia went into kidney\nfailure; Nathan donated the kidney that now keeps her body going. Back then,\nher doctor told her that her body\u2019s failure to suppress an infection had\nlikely caused her kidney crisis. And PFAS exposure is linked with lowered\nimmune response.\n\nSince PFAS were first detected on a dairy farm in 2016, Maine has been trying\nto uncover the extent of the contamination. The state\u2019s environmental\ndepartment kept records of the sludge-spreading, and those records show that,\nover more than two and a half decades, paper-product companies were directly\nresponsible for spreading more than 500,000 cubic yards of waste, the Portland\nPress Herald has reported. More was routed through water-treatment facilities;\nthe sludge spread near the Saunderses\u2019 house came from the Kennebec Sanitary\nTreatment District, which got a sizable portion of its waste from the nearby\npaper-products manufacturer, now owned by Huhtamaki, a Finland-based company.\nBecause we all ingest some amount of PFAS in our daily life, human wastewater\ncan also have high levels of contamination.\n\nMaine has been trying to stem the impacts of the contamination too. The\nSaunderses and their neighbors all got whole-house filters installed, and the\nPFAS levels in their water immediately became undetectable. The state has\ninitiated relief funds for farmers whose land has been poisoned by compounds\nthat have infiltrated the milk and grain they\u2019ve sold to their customers and\neaten themselves for years. No one really knows the extent of the health\nproblems linked to PFAS in the state.\n\nThe state did ban products containing PFAS\u2014it was the first to do so\u2014but the\nban won\u2019t go into effect until 2030, which to Cordelia seems like a long time\nto wait. She feels in her body the price of contamination: The medication that\nprotects her transplanted kidney is causing her to lose her hearing in one\near, and her bone density. At 64, she has real trouble walking a mile. \u201cWhen\nthings are out of your control, what are you going to do?\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re\nall going to die. I\u2019m probably going to die sooner than I would have.\u201d But she\nstill has to clean the house and make dinner. She\u2019s still alive to spend time\nwith her sons and her seven grandchildren. She likes to focus on that.\n\nNathan is less equanimous about it. He\u2019s suing the paper companies; the\ncharges against some of the original defendants have been dismissed, but the\ncase against Huhtamaki remains open. (The company did not respond to a request\nfor comment on Nathan\u2019s lawsuit, but in a statement to The Atlantic, it said\nit no longer intentionally adds PFAS to its manufacturing process, and noted\nthat \u201cseveral\u201d paper mills in Maine have used PFAS in their products. \u201cIn\nWaterville, as in all locations, we comply with all applicable environmental\nand product safety laws and regulations. We will continue to be engaged to\nhelp with the state\u2019s inquiry as needed,\u201d the company wrote.)\n\nNathan\u2019s is just one of hundreds of similar cases that legal experts expect to\nerupt from the new findings. Such cases might someday get people like him\nrecompense, but they won\u2019t make the PFAS go away.\n\nSo far, other states have taken a different approach to PFAS. Virginia, for\ninstance, kept permitting sludge-spreading even after environmentalists had\nloudly raised concerns about the chemicals\u2019 impacts, though the state did\nbegin requiring industries to test for PFAS in their waste stream last year.\nAlabama has reportedly rejected pleas by environmental groups to begin testing\nfor the compounds. Because Maine is the first state to try to mitigate PFAS\nthis thoroughly, it is also the first to confront PFAS\u2019 particular bind: What\ndo you do with a pollutant you can\u2019t destroy? After Maine banned sludge-\nspreading in 2022, slurry began to pile up precariously at the state landfill.\nCasella Waste Systems, the landfill operator, first tried exporting it to\nCanadian provinces where no law addressed PFAS in land-spread fertilizers. The\ntrucks went to Quebec, then New Brunswick, until pushback in both places\nstopped the toxic exports; now Casella Waste Systems says it is temporarily\nstabilizing its landfill by mixing sludge with dry waste. Overall, the sludge-\nmanagement situation, per a state report, remains \u201cvery challenging and\nuncertain.\u201d\n\nIn the state\u2019s northern reaches, PFAS contamination came from a different\nsource\u2014 Aqueous Film Forming Foam, which the U.S. Air Force once used to\nextinguish jet-fuel fires at Loring Air Force base and which relies on PFAS\nfor its fire-suppressing power. Long after the base closed, the Mi\u2019kmaq Nation\nacquired part of the land; the water was undrinkable, and the soil was so full\nof PFAS that state officials advised the tribe not to eat the deer that grazed\nthere. It is effectively unusable land.\n\nIn 2019, the Mi\u2019kmaq Nation partnered with the nonprofit Upland Grassroots to\ntry to clean up the land using hemp. Hemp plants have thick stems that can\ngrow more than 10 feet in a single season, theoretically the perfect plant\nbody type for hoovering up and squirreling away lots of poisonous chemicals.\nThe results of the first test run last year were disappointing: A maximum of 2\npercent of the PFAS was removed from soil in the most successful area. Still,\nno better technology exists to do more than this, Sara Nason, an environmental\nchemist who provided scientific guidance for the project, told me. The plan is\nto continue planting hemp; it\u2019s better than doing nothing, though the hemp\nwill take decades to clean the soil, and no one knows exactly what to do with\nthe chemical-loaded plants once they\u2019re harvested.\n\nSeveral labs across the country are trying to find a way to unmake these\nchemicals, using foam fractionation, soil washing, mineralization, electron-\nbeam radiation. David Hanigan, an environmental engineer at the University of\nNevada at Reno, is studying whether burning PFAS at ultrahigh temperatures can\nbreak the carbon-fluorine bond completely. He once thought that PFAS\nresearchers were out of their minds to be testing such wildly expensive\nsolutions, he told me. But he\u2019s realized that PFAS are just that tough, and as\na scientist, he thinks the original manufacturers of PFAS must have understood\nthat. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting from an organic-chemistry standpoint,\u201d he told me. Any\nchemist would have known that these compounds would persist in the\nenvironment, he said. Indeed, an investigation by The Intercept found that\nDuPont, among the original manufacturers of the compounds, did know, and for\ndecades tried to obscure the harms the chemicals posed, something the UN Human\nRights Council also contends. DuPont has consistently denied wrongdoing, and\nrecently settled a lawsuit for $1.18 billion, helping create a fund for public\nwater districts to address PFAS contamination. (In a statement to The\nAtlantic, a spokesperson for DuPont described the current company\u2019s history of\ncorporate reorganization, and wrote that \u201cto implicate DuPont de Nemours in\nthese past issues ignores this corporate evolution.\u201d)\n\nHanigan does think this engineering problem of PFAS will be solved,\neventually. \u201cWe can do it,\u201d he said. But he wonders what else we might have\nbeen able to do with that amount of human effort. And until chemists and\nengineers can undo PFAS, more places will start to see that they\u2019re caught in\na cycle in which these compounds move from water to soil to bodies to water. A\nfew states, such as Connecticut, have regulations against land-spreading\nsewage sludge; instead, they incinerate it, likely at temperatures below\nwhat\u2019s needed to destroy PFAS\u2019 strong bond. Most states have no such\nprohibition. Michigan, another state with a history of spreading sludge on\nfarmland, has found PFAS in its beef. In Texas, farmers recently sued a waste-\ntreatment giant alleging that it knew or should have known that its sludge had\nPFAS in it.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s new rules, though, will force the country as a whole\nto measure, then confront, the scale of our PFAS problem. Like the Saunderses,\npeople across the country are likely to soon discover that they\u2019ve been\ndrinking PFAS-contaminated water for years and begin wondering what it has\ncost them.\n\nZo\u00eb Schlanger is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
