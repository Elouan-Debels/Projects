A few years ago the internet was better, and for them it\u2019s when like\nthat guy in high school who never grew up they \u201cpeaked\u201d. Everyone was going to\nbe so great, even with the bad stuff happening the future seemed so much\nbetter still. Even when I was bombarded with bad things happening like some\nshooting or viral video that makes you angry, the main blackpill of the time\nwas just college being a dead end and unable to find employment. But I had\nfriends online, and things were looking so bright. Unfortunately for me and my\nfriends, that\u2019s when it seemed like everything peaked.\n\nJust like that kid who is unemployed, has no girlfriend or the lowest quality\nones, and lives with parents/a life funded by his parents (if he\u2019s not working\na bottom rung \u201cunskilled\u201d job like a McJob, Wal-Mart retail job, or warehouse\nwagie), internet addicts peaked a few years back. Then they fell victim to the\ndrug use, the internet drama machine, and the general decay of internet\nculture. If you showed someone from 2015 this headline, they\u2019d think it\u2019s\nmaking fun of Tumblr users and if you showed someone in 2010 it, you\u2019d think\nit\u2019s a rejected comedy movie plot:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nOf course, it\u2019s obvious how we got to this phase to anyone paying attention.\nWhile Tumblr was a haven for artists and creatives (while canceling people and\ncallout culture were big deals back then, the standards were laxer and you\nwouldn\u2019t get some moral busybody yelling at you for drawing Pokemon porn),\nthere was a blatant dark undercurrent of political drama that blew over into\nthe mainstream when the users of that site moved to Twitter.com. You just had\nto be in on the current thing, you had to reblog it or you\u2019re a bigot. Before\nGeorge Floyd, it was Trayvon Martin, Ferguson, and more.\n\nNowadays internet scenes are in shambles. Many of the users checked out\ncompletely, went down the rabbit hole of drama, or became unrecognizable\npeople. Checking on what your former friends years ago are up to now is the\nsame morbid feeling of checking up on what the cool guy in high school is up\nto now. Maybe he married like the neighbor I had. Maybe he married a\nDeviantArtist wife and had a kid. Or maybe he went down the rabbit hole of\ndrugs and insanity, e-begging online and wallowing away in his parents place\nor a run down shack he rooms with, unhappy and depressed. You want to see him\nsucceed, but he feels so distant and like trying to talk some sense into him\nwill end up with you blocked or worse. If the worst thing you can be accused\nof is racism in a college town with more BLM signs than black people, online\nthe worst thing you can have are people chasing after everything you do trying\nto throw your dirty laundry (which everyone online has in a long enough\ntimeline, let\u2019s be honest) up to every TG group/Discord server mod you meet.\n\nInternet scenes are dead from drama and antisocial behavior, and online\ncommunities are even worse. It\u2019s frustrating trying to find new people to be\nfriends with when everyone else can\u2019t get close to you, or when talking to\npeople seems hard because everyone you meet is oversocialized and\noverstimulated. It\u2019s also frustrating watching someone you like or community\nyou like go up in flames metaphorically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nThis has led to some old internet movements like neocities sites, skinwalking\nthe past with old school 90s website aesthetics and modern-day politics.\nThere\u2019s remasters and remakes of games, with OSRS and WoW Classic booming\nalong with private servers for old games. There\u2019s an obvious reason this fails\nof course. It\u2019s that 2015, or 2010, or 2007, or 1998 aren\u2019t coming back. Those\ndays are over. The culture changed. But most importantly, the people changed.\n\n# The people made the community\n\nThe problem with all these attempts to bring back the old internet is simple.\nThe technology and features of these old websites were only one part of the\npuzzle. The other of course, is the community it\u2019s around.\n\nNearly every single remnant of the old internet community wise has been driven\nto forums like KF (and many adjacent sites ranging from rdrama.net to forums\ndedicated to specific communities) and of course The Fediverse. Imageboards\nare dead and overrun with spam, Twitter is overrun with spam and canceling,\nand sites like BlueSky and Cohost are ideological echo chambers where internet\nnotoriety is met with a ban or place on blocklists. I\u2019ve seen people banned\nfrom Bluesky or put on blocklists for being infamous enough elsewhere. The\ncommunity doesn\u2019t care, because this is what they want.\n\nAnd so this leads to the issue with many of these communities. The people who\nliked the old internet community wise found themselves on the fediverse or\nforums, the latter of which consisted of one part of the old internet. These\ncommunities are gatekept in a different way, to keep undesirable individuals\neither out of the site or mocked relentlessly first (if they\u2019re seen as not a\nthreat to the site\u2019s existence). A famous right wing fedi instance, Poa.st,\nwill ban people for not liking anime. A weeb coomer instance like varishangout\nwill delete your account if you don\u2019t post your fetishes. Others will make you\nsay racial slurs as an initiation ritual, simply because you are not allowed\nto say these words on the mainstream internet giving the words a mystical\nappeal similar to a killphrase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nWhich leads us to sites like Neocities. Neocities is full of websites that\nfeature users making links to their big tech social media sites that feel like\nbusiness cards, along with modern day politics. I\u2019d be delusional if I said\nthese sites didn\u2019t exist back in the day, as the existence of the old school\n\u201ctranssexual\u201d community showed (see transsexual.org as an example for a real\nold-school web 1.0 site in this vein), but you had to go out of your way to\nfind these. They read less like some old school website, and more like Tumblr\npolitics. It doesn\u2019t take long to go on neocities to find sites like this:\n\nOr this:\n\nYou\u2019ll find badly made (ironically) websites talking about the postmodern\npersonal lives of individuals there. I really think you should click on random\nneocities sites. While not all of them are cringe and some are from FOSS nerds\nsuch as the legendary spyware.neocities.org, it\u2019s a great glimpse into the\npostmodern internet with aesthetics of the old web.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nThere\u2019s a point I want to make with this. It\u2019s not that the people are so and\nso. It\u2019s that the users there are the same as you\u2019ll find on Twitter and\nformerly Tumblr. They\u2019re not the same as the people of the past. In fact, even\nif you look at transsexual.org, you\u2019ll notice that pronouns weren\u2019t a thing\nback then, but rather \u201cyou are the wrong gender\u201c. There\u2019s a reason I point\nthis out too, it\u2019s to show that the aesthetics of these old sites also came\nwith a different mindset. There are a lot of things on these sites that would\nbe controversial to say today. Case in point, just look at how Newgrounds\nfamously had a ton of games about shooting Muslims after 9/11 and mimicking\nSouth Park\u2019s sense of humor. If you build the old internet in 2024, it\u2019s not\ngoing to be the same as the old internet, because the people aren\u2019t there. Or\nworse, you\u2019re not allowed to be that anymore.\n\n# The moderation is different, too\n\nHere\u2019s another example of how the old web was defined by the people on it, but\nfrom a different POV. Let\u2019s look at video games. I am sure that if you were to\nmimic DJ Keemstar on Halo 3 by playing Halo 2 on Insignia.live (which features\npride flags on the Twitter + Discord logo as a protest about how \u201cpride logos\nfrom corporations during a specific month don\u2019t care about the LGBT\u201d), I have\na gut feeling you\u2019ll get banned. It\u2019s a good thing too many people don\u2019t own\ncommunicators and 2.5 headsets that old phones used...yet. I mean his griefer\ngroup was called F@G.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nEssentially, I haven\u2019t tested this. But if I decided to mess with this on\nXEMU, a VPN, and a burner email, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d get banned. I just can feel it.\nI just know how it is from pattern recognition on old video games and the\nflags there. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at modern gaming. Call of\nDuty has now added in AI voice chat monitoring even in private games with your\nbros after a long hard day of wage cucking it for $17 an hour. It\u2019s also very\nsensitive.\n\nThis of course is an example of a different big tech problem which seeps its\nway into communities, which is top down moderation to influence behaviors. If\nthey can\u2019t make the community change, they will do it by force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nNo website is a better example of this than 4chan, where the moderators refuse\nto deal with the spam issue. Spam is very prominent in threads, along with\nderailing, \u201csliding\u201d, and the meme that /pol/ is literally dead from all the\nspam. Furthermore, moderators will send threads they hate to /pol/ (usually on\ntopic but inevitably political threads on say /g/ as an example) or /trash/\n(which has its own community of furries and whatnot, usually for NSFW threads\nor threads too \u201cfurry\u201d), further trashing the discussions going on in the\nboard. But one of the most infamous examples of 4chan moderators flexing their\npower has to be the now dead /qa/ board, which is almost completely locked and\nonly 2-3 threads on it. This is because you see, members of that board\ninfamously raided /lgbt/, which was a sacred cow to the site for obvious\nreasons.\n\nAfter this, everyone there migrated off site to the sharty/Soyjak Party, which\nhas been notorious for some wild raids and part of its lingo seeping into\nother parts of the internet. Yet it\u2019s also been plagued with other issues such\nas users posting child abuse material in threads. That\u2019s not a joke.\nImageboards tend to be lightning rods for that sort of content, and that\u2019s the\nother reason why nobody wants to dare touch hosting an \u201caltboard\u201d (any\nimageboard not 4chan in the anglosphere).\n\nWhy is 4chan dead culturally? It\u2019s because of the people there in the top, who\njust let many people making the site bad keep posting. It\u2019s all about the\npeople.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nThis is just a look at the larger sites. Many Discord and Telegram communities\nare also flooded with overbearing moderators. Reddit is just as bad, with\nmoderators having to stay within Reddit global rules to avoid a coup by the\npowermods or deletion. A controversial subreddit like /r/banpitbulls will have\nnumerous warnings on the top which seem to change every few months reminding\npeople of global Reddit rules. This is solely because they always have to keep\nbending over to the moderators at the top to keep hosting something that much\nof the site will dox users and pre-ban users for posting in.\n\n# The sanitized internet\n\nWhich leads us to the main problem again. The problem with all these sites\nwanting to mimic the old internet is they either die or become a monoculture,\nand that\u2019s because of the people. The people are what make the internet go\nalong. Cool people make the internet worth using, worth talking to friends on,\nand worth digging through the mountains of trash posted by spammers, low-\nquality users, ESLs, and nowadays ChatGPT/similar AI models.\n\nThe mainstream internet is sanitized harder than the security theater measures\nduring COVID were. Thanks to moderation at the top, from AI chatbots to\nmoderators who flex their power, every single part of the internet feels the\nsame. People have different names, but they\u2019re the same as people you\u2019ve met\nand written off. The other problem is, the internet is now 100% divided. You\neither have to post in sanitized communities where you have to put on mental\ninterview clothes to \u201cfit in\u201d and not risk getting banned, or you can post in\nfew rules allowed communities that devolve into rage and arguing about how\neverything is going to ruin your life (with no solution).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nActing like a cargo cult about the old internet and thinking \u201cif you build a\nwebsite like the old websites, they will come\u201d never works because the\ncommunity already has a home, or they are run by the same exact people who\nruined every other website. It won\u2019t get better by doing this. What made the\nold internet what it was, was the people on it. The people on it prefer to use\nmainstream social media with a mask on, or post on the fedi/forums to try to\nnetwork with like people.\n\nThe challenge here in the internet of 2024 is trying to make friends with\nsimilar interests, people who \u201cknow\u201d the game and trying to connect to them\nwhen they\u2019re not having the soul sucked out of them by the wage cage. When\nthey\u2019re not tired and sleepy after work and can\u2019t focus on the chat. When\nthey\u2019re not ignoring you for their 400 other friends. To paraphrase someone\nwho was oversocialized, he absolutely loved being able to log into the\ninternet at any time and finding friends on at the same time they\u2019re on, not\ncaring about the quality of them, and hoping he\u2019d find a diamond in the rough.\nHe was later complaining to me about his ex, but failing to humor any of the\ninteresting creative discussions we had when I first met him online. Crazy,\nisn\u2019t it?\n\nIn the cancel happy sphere of mainstream social network and the private chat\ncliques of Discord/Telegram, it\u2019s truly easier said than done. It\u2019s great\nknowing that you\u2019re one slip of the keyboard away from being ghosted and\nremoved from a group when 2 days ago you shared similar interests and talked\nabout characters you like. It\u2019s great knowing that your oversocialized friend\nis likely to ditch the internet and see you as another username on a screen.\nYou\u2019re not his issue when he has tons of friends he can talk to, treating you\nlike the 10^th side hoe he has this week to erp with.\n\nTo bring back the old internet, the mindset needs to change. If it doesn\u2019t\nchange, it will forever remain a skinsuit of ironic references to the past\nwith modern day current year politics indistinguishable from any other person\nonline (left or right wing). You just can\u2019t get the old internet out of people\nwho want to complain about someone else online, or their mom, or their life.\nOr maybe it was all an enigma and I was just projecting part of what I saw on\nthe past through a rose-tinted lens of Flip Video compression, but I do\nremember the art sure was better then.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Telegram\n  * Print\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nMastodon: Dated and broken by designFebruary 17, 2024\n\nHalfway in the month: lessons learned and reflections on the fediOctober 16,\n2022\n\nThe logic of offshoot sites (A pure schizopost)December 18, 2023\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n## Recent Posts:\n\n  * In a long enough timeline, every artist will be forced to take Crypto\n  * Chasing the dragon of the past\n  * How I stopped worrying and learned to love the PC-98\n  * Reading and writing DD 5.25 disks on a 40 track drive with a greaseweazel (PC-8801, IBM 320/360k, etc.): The \u201csecret sauce\u201d\n  * Mastodon: Dated and broken by design\n\n## Older Posts\n\n  * April 2024\n  * March 2024\n  * February 2024\n  * January 2024\n  * December 2023\n  * November 2023\n  * October 2023\n  * April 2023\n  * November 2022\n  * October 2022\n  * September 2022\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Pawlicker's Pleroma Experiment Blog\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
