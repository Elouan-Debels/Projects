You share food, you share drinks, you share\nutensils and silverware, and as a result, your clean infant mouth was\neventually colonized by your mother\u2019s strain of the main cavity-causing\nbacteria Streptococcus mutans.\n\nMother Feeding Child. Mary Cassatt, 1898\n\nAfter S. mutans has taken up residence in your gluttonous abode, that\u2019s when\nthe magic happens.\n\nS. mutans is a carbaholic\u2014it absolutely loves carbs. The primary way it gets\nits energy is through using the magic of glycolysis to break down sugar,\nbread, and everything else it can touch, producing several acidic byproducts\nin the process. The main organic acid produced as a result of S. mutans\u2019\nfeeding is lactic acid.\n\nCarbohydrate metabolism in Streptococcus mutans. Lemos et al. (2019), Figure\n1.\n\nWith lactic acid in your mouth, the pH falls, leaving your mouth more acidic\nand hostile to its mineral inhabits\u2014your teeth. The acidified environment\nbegins to demineralize tooth enamel, making it rough, causing pits to form and\nwiden. When those pits are large enough, that\u2019s a cavity.\n\nThis process has been shown experimentally in vivid detail. In the journal\nDental Materials, Cross et al. presented profilometry images of what happens\nto teeth after exposure to a 30% lactic acid solution. The result of doing\nthis is shown in images a, b, c, and d, below, which are, respectively,\npolished enamel and the same enamel after 45, 90, and 225 minutes. It clearly\nbecomes much less smooth and vastly more rough as time in the acid continues.\nYou\u2019ll also notice images e and f, which are, respectively, another clean\nenamel surface and the same surface after 72 hours of colonization by S.\nmutans.2\n\nCross et al. (2009), Figure 3\n\nAcidic environments rip through teeth, and the other bacteria living in the\nmouth are generally happy to take advantage of this situation, often making\nthings worse.3\n\n###\n\nThe Revolutionary Origins of Dental Decay\n\nWe know how people get the bacteria that drives the formation of dental\ncavities (henceforth \u201ccaries\u201d), and we know how they work, but how long have\nanimals had to deal with dental decay?\n\nThere are currently no publications documenting caries in dinosaurs. We have\nplenty of records indicating mechanical wear and tear, but none showing that\ndinosaurs were beset by caries. This might be shocking since some of the\ntoothiest dinosaurs had extraordinarily thin enamel, so it wouldn\u2019t take much\nfor caries to form. But even today, many animals renowned for their smiles\ndon\u2019t seem to get caries despite thin enamel\u2014the alligator is a familiar\nexample.\n\nThe standard explanation for the co-occurrence of thin enamel and absent\ncaries is that the relevant animals are polyphyodonts,4 meaning that their\nteeth are continually replaced over the lifespan. But this explanation isn\u2019t\nthat great unless you believe that teeth are dropped as soon as decay sets in,\nand that\u2019s not realistic. More likely, the reason caries are so rare among so\nmany animals is because their diets aren\u2019t usually sugar-rich, and there\u2019s\njust not much for S. mutans to ferment even if the bacteria has taken up\nresidence in their mouths.5\n\nS. mutans has a special affinity for sucrose\u2014table sugar\u2014, a disaccharide\ncombination of glucose and fructose. While there are few animals whose diets\nare rich in sucrose, there are plenty of frugivorous animals who have\nfructose-rich diets. The fact that the first true fruits made their appearance\nin the late Cretaceous might go a long way to explaining why there are so few\nknown frugivorous dinosaurs6 and why caries haven\u2019t yet been documented among\nthem. I think this case is further strengthened by the finding that dinosaur\nteeth often contained fluorapatite instead of hydroxyapatite like our teeth.\nThat means that if those dinosaur\u2019s diets were conducive to S. mutans or were\notherwise acidifying, their teeth would have been noticeably melted; not only\nthat, the melting would have produced hydrofluoric acid, killing dinosaurs\nunless they had some never-before-observed means of resisting it.\n\nSo we\u2019ll have to start the story of caries a little later than the dinosaurs.\n\nThe earliest-known example of caries in a mammal was published in 2021.\nMicrosyops latidens was a stem primate found in Wyoming. This proto-monkey\nexisted for about 500,000 years before going extinct 54 million years ago, so\nthe samples are old.\n\n1,030 Microsyops specimens were uncovered and 7.5% of them had caries, but the\nproportion of individuals with caries varied considerably over time. In the\ntime period caries were most frequent, every sixth Microsyops specimen had\nthem. Because we also have knowledge about their diets throughout the sampling\nperiod, this excess of caries can be used to affirm what I said above: diet\nmatters. The period with the greatest frequency of caries seemed to be the one\nwith the greatest levels of fruit consumption and thus the dietary environment\nmost conducive to acidification.7\n\nSelig and Silcox (2021), Figure 3.\n\nAncient monkeys don\u2019t have anything on modern humans. The CDC reports that\n9/10 Americans have had caries before. Moreover, a quarter of the U.S.\npopulation was estimated to have untreated dental decay. That\u2019s a lot of\ndecay, and it\u2019s not unique to America either. The 2019 Global Burden of\nDisease Study suggested that 3.09 billion people had untreated caries in their\nadult teeth.\n\nIf we turn back to the Selig and Silcox study on Microsyops, we\u2019ll see that\ntheir Table 1 contains a list of fossil mammal species that had been\npreviously investigated for caries. On the list, we see two hominids, from the\nPliocene-Pleistocene and the Mid-Pleistocene, respectively. Look at how\nfrequently these samples\u2014who existed long before serious dentistry was\naround\u2014had caries:\n\nSelig and Silcox (2021), Table 1.\n\nTo figure out what went wrong in our mouths between early Hominidae and\ntoday\u2019s Homo sapiens, we have to look at archaeological evidence. A perusal of\nthe relevant literature shows repeated reference to the seminal text on the\nmatter: Cohen and Armelagos\u2019 1984 volume Paleopathology at the Origins of\nAgriculture. Cohen and Armelagos mustered data from twenty-one societies to\nillustrate a trend towards worsening health during the transition to\nagriculture. In nineteen of those societies, agriculture brought an increase\nin disease and a reduction in physical stature that we\u2019ve only managed to\nreverse after the Industrial Revolution.8\n\nThere are many reasons for these changes: humans began living closer together\nand with more animal contact, promoting infectious disease; nutritional\nquality per person declined as meat was replaced by wheat, leading to numerous\nobservations of osteoporosis and anemia; and through the transition to plant\nconsumption, the dietary environment became conducive to caries. Publications\nhave generally tended to affirm the ill effects of the transition to\nagriculture.9\n\n> One straight forward example of what paleopathologists have learned from\n> skeletons concerns historical changes in height. Skeletons from Greece and\n> Turkey show that the average height of hunger-gatherers toward the end of\n> the ice ages was a generous 5' 9'' for men, 5' 5'' for women. With the\n> adoption of agriculture, height crashed, and by 3000 B. C. had reached a low\n> of only 5' 3'' for men, 5' for women. By classical times heights were very\n> slowly on the rise again, but modern Greeks and Turks have still not\n> regained the average height of their distant ancestors. \u2014 Jared Diamond\n> (1999)\n\nGenetic evidence clearly points to the Agricultural Revolution as a critical\npoint for the evolution of S. mutans. A revealing publication from 2012 used\nsequencing data from 57 S. mutans isolates and three Streptococcus relatives\nand uncovered evidence that the S. mutans population exponentially increased\nright around the dawn of agriculture, with evidence for positive selection for\nfourteen genes implicated in sugar metabolism and tolerance to the higher\nlevels of acid it would produce with humanity\u2019s new diets. The authors noted:\n\n> Our estimates for the timing of the demographic expansion in S. mutans\n> coincide with the origin of human agriculture [10,000 years ago]....\n> Numerous studies in physical anthropology have shown an increased prevalence\n> of dental caries in human remains from post-agricultural societies (5\u201350%)\n> when compared with remains of Mesolithic hunter\u2013gatherers (0\u20132%). This\n> pattern has been attributed to changes in diet and the consequent increase\n> in consumption of carbohydrates in human populations after the development\n> of starchy crops, leading to the establishment of infectious agents causing\n> dental caries. Our timing and expansion estimates are consistent with S.\n> mutans as a possible etiological agent of human dental caries; however, it\n> is not possible to rule out other oral bacteria species as also contributing\n> to the development of this disease.\n\nThere\u2019s considerable evidence that our dietary niche bred our dental\npredators,10 and there\u2019s also evidence that the dietary shifts that\naccompanied the Industrial Revolution have promoted extremely cariogenic\nbacteria. This makes total sense, because even compared to humans at the dawn\nof the Agricultural Revolution, we have extraordinarily sugary diets.\n\nAs a species, we\u2019ve socially developed adaptations to caries and other dental\nmaladies, and they\u2019ve been in use for a long time. For example, there are\n9,000-year-old dental drillings from the Indus Valley; 6,500-year-old dental\nfillings made of beeswax have been found in the area of modern Slovenia; from\nthe ancient Egyptians, we have the earliest records of a named dentist, one\nHesy-Ra:\n\nRelief of Hesy-Ra from his Mastaba, James Edward Quibell, 1912.\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi lists dental extraction as a punishment; there are\npaintings, drawings, and inscriptions regarding dental work going back\nthousands of years; prosthetics, amalgams, dentures, and orthodontic devices\nabound in the historical record going back into the B.C.\u2019s. Clearly dentistry\nhas been prevalent in human history for as long as we have records, and it\u2019s\nno surprise given the importance of the mouth in everyday life and and costs\nof conditions like caries.\n\n###\n\nThe Human Toll of Mouth Holes\n\nIf you live in the developed world, you probably take dentists for granted. If\nyou\u2019re suffering from caries, it\u2019s straightforward to have that problem fixed.\nAll you have to do is pick up the phone, schedule an appointment, and head in\nto have your teeth drilled and filled, and voil\u00e0, you\u2019re fixed.\n\nBut like many conditions that we\u2019ve learned how to easily fix, dental caries\nstill exact tremendous costs, and those costs are borne unequally. The CDC has\nproduced handy infographics showing this reality for children, adults, and the\nelderly. Children first:\n\nThen adults:\n\nAnd finally, the elderly:\n\nAcross all age groups, there are plenty of caries. But while most Americans\nhave the ability to get their caries fixed at a dentist right away, the same\nisn\u2019t true for many of the billions of other people currently living with\nuntreated caries. A lot of this has to do with the fact that they are poor,\nmostly by virtue of living in developing countries.\n\nAll countries begin poor; so far, only some have become rich. During the\nprocess of development, obtaining cheap, sugary Western foodstuffs happens\nbefore there are widely available medical services to combat the cariogenic\nside effects of the transition to the modern, sugary food environment. As a\nresult, when the Third World starts eating like Westerners, the result is\nuntreated dental decay. The stories about this sound fairly horrifying. For\nexample, Cirino and Scantlebury recounted that decay in developing countries\n\u201cis usually left untreated until it becomes so extensive and/or painful that\nextraction is the only option.\u201d11 Yee and Sheiham wrote\n\n> Three-quarters of the low-income nations do not have sufficient resources to\n> finance an essential package of health care services for the children of\n> their countries.... Although the level of dental caries in low-income\n> nations is categorised as low, requiring mostly single surface restorations,\n> approximately 90 per cent of the caries remains [sic] untreated in both the\n> primary and permanent dentition. Analysis utilising some epidemiological\n> disciplines has demonstrated that to treat dental caries by traditional\n> amalgam restorative dentistry in the permanent dentition of the child\n> population [(most of which reside in the developing world)] would...\n> [require] financial resources beyond the capabilities of low-income nations.\n\nLeft untreated, those childhood caries will also go on to become a bigger\nproblem as kids age. The rates of caries may have also increased as\ndevelopment has led to sugary dietary changes outpacing dentistry even\nfurther. In some cases, this sort of development has been so severe that\nentire villages of children have untreated caries.12\n\nThe health impacts of caries can be severe. Caries can lead to several types\nof infections, like abscesses in the root (periapical) or on the gums\n(periodontal), and these can cause infections that can spread elsewhere in the\nbody, including cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Caries in upper teeth can easily\ncause sinusitis and all the problems related to that too. In some rare cases,\ncaries can lead to Ludwig\u2019s Angina, endocarditis, septicemia, or cavernous\nsinus thrombosis. Your teeth are important, and failing to take care of them\nwill result in reduced quality of life and might be your death.\n\nModern studies have related poor oral health to suicidality, caries have been\nrelated to mortality, repeatedly, across races, in fairly select cohorts, and\nthrough other proxies like tooth loss. This relationship isn\u2019t likely to be\nentirely causal, as we might reasonably expect people with low\nconscientiousness and otherwise poor habits to have more dental decay and to\nbe at a greater risk of dying, but it is consistent with what dental caries\ndo. They certainly do not reduce people\u2019s risk of dying, and the historical\nrecord suggests they were associated with high mortality not too long ago.\nSome related conditions still are, and there are even instances where children\nin the developed world have died from complications related to caries in\nliving memory.\n\nGlobally, billions have caries, and millions\u2014maybe billions\u2014actively suffer\nfrom them, while nontrivial proportions of those people end up with tooth\nloss, infections, chronic pain, generally worsened health, and so on.\nHistorically, caries have been a plague on humanity since the dawn of starchy\nand sugary diets, and they\u2019ve undoubtedly resulted in millions of casualties.\nBut today, they\u2019re generally not deadly because we have modern dental care, so\nwe\u2019ve forgotten the real, human toll of caries, and we focus too little on the\ncosts they place on poor, infirm, and incapable populations today. To put this\nin perspective, consider George Washington.\n\nWashington\u2019s teeth started needing to be removed when he was 24 years old.\nEventually, he had no teeth at all, so he commissioned no fewer than four\npairs of dentures during his lifetime. Washington frequently complained about\nhis dental pain and the pain from his dentures. From their appearance, the\npain they\u2019d cause is obvious:\n\nFor the Americans, pull out a one dollar bill and look at Washington\u2019s lips.\n\nThey do not look normal, and they were not normal.\n\nWashington\u2019s lips bulged out of his face and made him look unnatural, which he\noften complained about. In fact, Washington spoke with a hiss due to his\ndentures, and the embarrassment over that might have contributed to his\nreclusiveness.\n\nWashington was, unfortunately, not unique in suffering from decay and, in\nfact, among his contemporaries, he might have taken better care of his mouth\nthan others tended to. Many of Washington\u2019s peers preferred to simply live\n(and sometimes die) with rot. But Washington knew that a leader had to at\nleast have teeth in his mouth, so he lived with the pain.\n\nJohn Adams had very few teeth due to his love of sweets and his belief that\nvomiting was good for your health. Consequently, it became difficult to\nunderstand him in mid-life because he refused to wear dentures. Thomas\nJefferson was renowned for his excellent oral health, as he had only lost a\nsingle tooth to decay by the time he died. Paul Revere was well-known as a\nsilversmith, and he was also a dentist!\n\nThe stories of the Founding Fathers\u2019 dental conditions could make for much\nmore writing, but I\u2019d rather bring things back to the common man. Or rather,\nwoman. Because the anecdotes you may have heard from your grandparents or\ngreat-grandparents about wives having all of their teeth removed and dentures\nput in? Many people have them and the practice is attested to in the\nhistorical record. That\u2019s how bad dental conditions used to be.\n\nMore morbidly, have you heard of Waterloo Teeth? After the Battle of Waterloo,\nscavengers went to work extracting teeth from the dead, as was the fashion at\nthe time for use in bridges and dentures. They were so necessary that this act\nof desecration was simply accepted. There are many indications that this\npractice was common for a long time. I assume some of you have visited the\nParis Catacombs. The missing teeth of almost all of the skulls down there\nattest to the commonality of the practice of taking teeth from the dead for\nuse in dental devices.\n\nCredit: Angus McDiarmid (2008)\n\nOn the more statistical side of things, the Health Examination Survey in\n1960-62 looked at the prevalence of tooth loss among U.S. adults aged 18-79\nand it produced a shocking estimate about the extent of dental decay in the\nAmerican population.13 By the time they tended to die, half of Americans had\nlost all of their teeth, becoming edentulous. Beyond typical life\nexpectancies, more than half of Americans simply had no natural teeth.\n\nTotal Loss of Teeth in Adults, United States - 1960-1962, Figures 1 and 2\n\nBy 2010, this number had dropped to a still high 13%. The health burden of\ndental decay until very recently has been immense; those reading this are\namong the first generations that can reasonably expect to enter old age with a\nfull set of pearly whites.\n\n###\n\nDisease Elimination\n\nOnly one human disease has officially been eliminated: smallpox. The last\nperson to have smallpox was a Somali man by the name of Ali Maow Maalin. He\nsurvived infection in 1977 while in his early 20s and no one has been observed\nwith the condition in a natural setting since. Given the scale of deaths from\nsmallpox in human history, this is one of the greatest achievements of modern\nmedicine.\n\nOur World in Data (2018). An estimated 300,000,000 died from smallpox in the\n20th century alone.\n\nWe\u2019ve come close to eliminating other diseases, but no other disease has\nofficially been eliminated. Examples include polio, Guinea worm, Yaws, and\u2014in\na very geographically-isolated manner\u2014even malaria. Humans have managed to\nfully eliminate a single other disease, and it\u2019s the bovine disease\nrinderpest.\n\nBoth smallpox and rinderpest plagued humans and their livestock for millennia\nand they could only be eliminated after vaccines were invented and distributed\nen masse. The cost of smallpox elimination was undoubtedly worth it to\neliminate one of the biggest killers in the history of mankind, and doubly so\nbecause it was surprisingly cheap. But the effort was also lucky, since the\nvirus \u201cproduced acute illness, had no carrier stage or non-human reservoirs,\nand had an effective vaccine that was used in combination with international\nsurveillance and public education.\u201d14\n\nEnding other diseases has proved much more difficult despite ample demand.\n\n###\n\nAre Caries the Latest Disease on the Chopping Block?\n\nWhen a tool came along to decisively eliminate smallpox, it was gone within a\nfew short decades. The immense human cost of caries has to make you wonder:\nwhy haven\u2019t we eliminated them yet? Given the conditions that were needed to\ndrive out smallpox and rinderpest, we have to ask: do we have tools for\ncaries?\n\nBrush your teeth. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do, but does it work?\n\nMeta-analytically, the people who toothbrush more have fewer caries.15 But\nthat\u2019s what you\u2019d expect if they were also just generally more careful people\nwho follow the generally-accepted \u2018good advice.\u2019 Similarly, regular dental\ncare is strongly related to reduced incidence of caries and is uninformative\nfor the same reasons.\n\nBecause almost everyone brushes their teeth, it can be hard to know if doing\nthe bare minimum works. So what about some experimental modifications to\ncommon practice to suggest what works better? As it turns out, we have\nCochrane Reviews aplenty.\n\n  * High-fluoride toothpaste prevents caries, with some qualifiers about potential fluorosis risk for the young.\n\n  * Powered toothbrushes outperform manual ones.\n\n  * The evidence on whether flossing helps is extremely poor. Similarly, there\u2019s weak evidence favoring the use of other interdental cleaning tools and methods like interdental brushes, tooth cleaning sticks, and oral irrigation over doing nothing, and potentially over flossing.\n\n  * Chlorhexidine mouthwash might be good for gingival health and is certainly good for plaque buildup.16\n\n  * Fluoride mouthwash given to children and adolescents in an adult-supervised and potentially in an unsupervised fashion greatly reduces caries.\n\nOverall, the experimental evidence doesn\u2019t show much difference between\nbrushing teeth like normal and practices like using more heavily fluoridated\ntoothpaste, and flossing or using other interdental tools, and it supports\nusing powered brushes, but not to enormous effect, while also supporting the\nuse of mouthwash.17\n\nOr to get back to the point, it doesn\u2019t seem like we have a way to eliminate\ncaries through home practices, but combining the experimental evidence with\nthe observation that fewer people are ending up toothless by their twilight\nyears, it certainly seems like we\u2019ve gone a long way towards that end.\n\nBut room for progress remains.\n\n> The day is surely coming, and perhaps within the lifetime of you young men\n> before me, when we will be engaged in practicing preventive, rather than\n> reparative, dentistry. - G.V. Black, 1886\n\nWhat if there was a one-shot solution to dental caries?\n\nWell there is, and it was discovered around forty years ago.\n\nIn 1984, through brute force, Hillman, Johnson and Yaphe isolated a strain of\nS. mutans that produced a novel bacteriocin\u2014bacterially-produced toxins that\ninhibit growth in other bacteria nearby. Some variants were deficient in\nproducing this bacteriocin and others produced twofold amounts. The ones that\nproduced more of the bacteriocin proved highly capable of colonizing rat\nmouths.\n\nLate in the next year, one of the discovered strains\u2014dubbed JH1001\u2014was applied\nto the mouths of five human subjects. The subjects were exposed to three\ndifferent infection regimes. Three were infected once per day for four days, a\nfourth was given a dental prophylaxis (to suppress pre-existing S. mutans) and\ninfected once per day for four days and then once every ten weeks for the next\n2.5 years, and the final subject was given a dental prophylaxis and two\nexposures per day for four days. For one subject, JH1001 simply failed to take\nhold, whereas for another, it disappeared midway through the first year. For\nthe rest, it was variously persistent, and in one subject, it constituted the\nonly S. mutans still living in their mouth by 2.5 years.\n\nIn June of 1987, the Hillman group had two more papers published on their S.\nmutans specimens.\n\nOne paper showcased the discovery of a variant of S. mutans that produced\nacetoin and was lactate dehydrogenase deficient (LDH-d), preventing the\nbacteria from producing any lactic acid. This is when things start to get\ninteresting. Just three years later, a follow-up on LDH-d S. mutans showed\nthat such a strain failed to produce caries on enamel in vitro, whereas a\nnormal, non-deficient strain rotted enamel exactly like you\u2019d expect. The\ndifferences at 10 (normal S. mutans) and 21 (LDH-d S. mutans) days are stark:\n\nJohnson, Gross and Hillman (1980), Fig. 1.\n\nIn the paper\u2019s second demonstration, germ-free rats were infected with normal\nS. mutans (BHT-2) and the LDH-d strain (JH168), in addition to a wild S.\nmutans (JHI 45R33). The result was staggering: there were basically no caries\nin the LDH-d strain, but the normal and wild-type strains had plenty of caries\nafter just fourteen weeks:\n\nJohnson, Gross and Hillman (1980), Fig. 3.\n\nIn the second of the papers from 1987, JH1005\u2014a version of JH1001 with three-\ntimes the bacteriocin activity\u2014was shown to successfully colonize three human\nsubjects\u2019 mouths after a single application using a simple procedure. The\nprocedure can be done in the home: polish the teeth with dental pumice, brush\nthe specimen onto the teeth for a few minutes, and you\u2019re good to go. More\nbacteriocin seems to be all it takes to make colonization work in people who\nare already living with their own oral microbiomes, rather than like germ-free\nrats.\n\nAll of the key ingredients existed to create a caries vaccine if an LDH-d S.\nmutans with high bacteriocin activity could be isolated. Fast forward to 2000\nand such a strain was being characterized\u2014or rather, constructed.\n\nThe Hillman group described the process of taking a super-colonizing\nstrain\u2014JH1140\u2014that produced considerable amounts of the desired bacteriocin\n(now named mutacin 1140) and making it into a vaccine for caries by making it\nLDH-d too. Because making S. mutans LDH-d was generally lethal for the\nbacteria, Hillman et al. opted to trade lactic acid for ethanol by\nsubstituting the adhB gene from the bioethanol-producing bacteria Zymomonas\nmobilis for the S. mutans gene behind its lactic acid production, shifting it\nfrom lactate dehydrogenase to alcohol dehydrogenase.\n\nThe process of doing this involves swapping the open reading frames for ldh\nand adh by first deleting ldh through circle PCR mutagenesis and then\namplifying the reading frame for adh, purifying, ligating, and transforming to\neventually obtain a reading frame for ldh that contains adh. This is then\nstrapped onto a suicide vector called p95 to get the delivery plasmid pTB1002.\nThis is then introduced into a JH1140 specimen to replace its ldh through a\nheterodiploid intermediate (HD83) that\u2019s grown for twenty generations to\nenable a recombination event that purges p95 and the original ldh or the new\nmutant ldh.\n\nSpecimens resulting from this procedure were screened and some, without a\nlactate end-product, were identified.\n\nHillman et al. (2000), Table 2.\n\nThus, the super-colonizing, LDH-d S. mutans BCS3-L1 was born, and the testing\nproceeded immediately.18\n\nIn germ-free rats, the non-LDH-d strain produced caries and BCS3-L1 did not:\n\nHillman et al. (2000), Table 3.\n\nIn Sprague Dawley rats, BCS3-L1 was much better than JH1140, and it was\nnonsignificantly better than the pre-monitoring verified absent S. mutans\ncontrols:\n\nHillman et al. (2000), Table 4.\n\nAnd in terms of its ability to colonize the mouth, BCS3-L1 might have even\nbeen better than JH1140. For safety, there were no signs of toxicity, rats\ndidn\u2019t end up with different weights across experimental conditions19 All\nsigns pointed to this working, and two years later, Hillman described\ncolonization working in humans, with no apparent ill effects, and yet more\nindications of protection from caries in rats.\n\nBased on the stories I\u2019ve been told, the bacteria has been a total success in\nthe mouths of the Hillman group and everyone else who\u2019s had their mouth\ncolonized by BCS3-L1.\n\n###\n\nBrighter Smiles Through Biotechnology\n\nIf you\u2019ve been on Twitter lately, you might have seen when I made this post:\n\nLink\n\nI\u2019m one of the latest people to have had this wonderful living caries vaccine\napplied to their teeth. Given the incredible human toll of caries, you might\nbe wondering when you, too, can get this healthier form of S. mutans in your\nmouth.\n\n####\n\nThe answer is now. Orders just went live and you can place them here.\n\nBCS3-L1 will soon be home-delivered in the U.S. for the price of a single\ndental filling, and there are plans to expand to other locations in the works\ntoo. The scourge of poor dental health that has wracked humanity for 10,000\nyears might soon be behind us.\n\nA lucky part of all of this is that we\u2019ll only need to try our hand at\neradication once.\n\nLike smallpox, S. mutans doesn\u2019t have some natural reservoir that will crop up\nto re-infect humans with a wild strain that brings caries back. After we\u2019ve\ngotten rid of it, it\u2019s likely that caries will simply be diminished to the\npoint of irrelevance for the vast majority of mankind. What\u2019s more, because of\nthe parent-to-child transmission described at this article\u2019s outset, if a\nwould-be parent is colonized, their kids will end up living a life that\u2019s\nlikely to include far fewer or zero caries.\n\nThe benefits for the poor, the old, infirm, and incapable of taking care of\nthemselves, and the Third World are so large that there ought to be a public\nhealth initiative to spread this around. Such an effort would ultimately save\nmany billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands, millions, or\u2014in the long-\nenough run\u2014potentially billions of human lives.\n\nIf you would like to read more about BCS3-L1 (also known as Lumina or SMaRT),\nplease see Defying Cavity on AstralCodexTen.\n\nAstral Codex Ten\n\nDefying Cavity: Lantern Bioworks FAQ\n\nRead more\n\n4 months ago \u00b7 202 likes \u00b7 410 comments \u00b7 Scott Alexander\n\nAnd if you want to buy the product, I\u2019ll link it again with this notice:\norders are live and you can place them here. We now have the tool to make a\nlong-time human plague disappear. Let\u2019s use it.\n\n1\n\nOr your father. Ultimately, this is down to proximity and interaction. Since\nmothers tend to have greater involvement in the early upbringings of their\nkids, children\u2019s oral microbiomes tend to have greater resemblance to their\nmothers\u2019 than to their fathers\u2019.\n\nThe acquisition of maternal oral microbiota has been observed directly and the\npattern of mother-biased transmission has been observed in places as diverse\nas Finland and Japan, and maternal and, more generally, parental transmission\nis even acknowledged by mainstream view-reflecting corporate and academic\nentities. The non-acquisition of the maternal oral microbiome\u2014or, indeed, any\nS. mutans\u2014has also been noted in scenarios where children are taken care of by\ncaretakers besides their mothers. On a related note, there\u2019s also evidence\nthat couples colonize one another\u2019s oral microbiomes, and it stands to reason\nthat the oral microbiome can be colonized in many other ways, through social,\ndietary, and other environmental means.\n\nThe most extensive paper on microbiome transmission covered both the gut and\noral microbiomes and was published very recently. It used data from multiple\ncountries, yielding a reasonably large sample that was more than sufficient to\nshowcase the maternal-paternal oral microbiome colonization discrepancy. That\ndiscrepancy is plainly visible in this graph:\n\nValles-Colomer et al. (2023), Fig. 5c\n\n2\n\nBecause this scenario only involves lactic acid and S. mutans, no other\nbacterial strains, no saliva buffer, and no remineralization, it is not an\nexact representation of what happens in the human mouth, but it is\nillustrative of what happens to humans over longer timespans.\n\n3\n\nFor additional historical details about caries and how their causes were\nfinally discovered, see Ruby et al.\n\n4\n\nOr on rare occasions, monophyodonts like the rat and toothed whale.\n\n5\n\nAs an aside, there is a well-known myth that Nile crocodiles have their teeth\ncleaned by birds. This comes from Herodotus and it is neither supported for\nany crocodiles nor relevant for alligators.\n\n6\n\nIncluding various Nodosauridae, hadrosaurs, and\u2014controversially\u2014maybe even\noviraptors.\n\nAs some have noted, there were likely \u201cfrugivores\u201d before the emergence of\ntrue fruits following the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution wherein\ngymnosperms were outcompeted by angiosperms. These early fruits in evidence\nlook to be dominantly nuts, and the earliest examples of eating them include\ngizzards, making them unrelated to the issue of dental caries.\n\n7\n\nWe see similar diet-caries correlations in other primates, like\nGigantopithecus blacki, or even in omnivorous bears like Arctodus simus.\n\nAlso interestingly, we see caries in contemporary primates and they\u2019re\nconcentrated among species that eat sugary foods and on the anterior teeth,\nconsistent with practices like \u201cwadging,\u201d where chimps will hold something\nlike a fig, honeycomb, or a bundle of berries in their front teeth to eat,\nlike so:\n\n8\n\nAreas for progress to be made remain in the less developed parts of the world.\n\n9\n\nConfirming that the caries findings have to do with the dietary niche, hunter-\ngatherers with starchy diets have also had lots of caries before the\nAgricultural Revolution. This is an indication that the association of caries\nwith the Agricultural Revolution is due to the dietary changes it involved\nrather than the timing alone.\n\nMarklein et al. (2019) provided a good illustration of the differences in the\nfrequency of caries between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists across 185\narchaeological sites:\n\nMarklein et al. (2019), Figure 3.\n\nThe graph shows that very agricultural society had caries, but the modal\nhunter-gatherer society did not.\n\n10\n\nNowadays, this is the standard narrative and figures often illustrate the\nassumptions of this narrative by describing the evolution of S. mutans as a\nco-occurrence with the dawn of agriculture.\n\n11\n\nIn some places, they\u2019ve attempted traditional remedies for caries, but those\ntraditional approaches \u201chave met with marginal success.\u201d\n\n12\n\nThe most famous case of globalization impacting the food environment doesn\u2019t\nhave to do with caries but, instead, with niacin deficiency\u2014pellagra. In fact,\npellagra epidemics resulting from nutritional globalization are the reason we\nknow what niacin is.\n\nIn the New World, several populations were dependent on maize (corn) for large\nproportions or practically all of their diets. Relying on corn for your diet\nis a recipe for ending up with a niacin deficiency since it contains far too\nlittle to survive on in a biochemically available way. But despite that, New\nWorld populations didn\u2019t simply exist with high levels of pellagra all the\ntime. They weren\u2019t adapted to go without niacin either. They used a food\npreparation procedure called nixtamalization to treat corn with slaked lime or\nplant ash to make the niacin in it bioavailable to humans. This procedure\nmakes it possible to live off of corn without succumbing to pellagra.\n\nLas Tortilleras, Pierre-Frederic Lehnert, 1836\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, pellagra became a major problem among the\nnorth Italian peasantry after corn was imported and people realized it was an\nincredibly cheap way to produce flour. The reason is that corn was imported\nwithout also importing nixtamalization. Since no one knew why nixtamalization\nwas needed, no one thought to encourage it.\n\nIn the late-19th century, Christiaan Eijkman was studying beri-beri, a\nneurodegenerative deficiency of vitamin B1 that was common in southeast Asia.\nEijkman found that having the disease was more prevalent among individuals\nwhose diets relied on polished rice, inspiring him to hypothesize that\npolishing removed an antitoxin that protected against the disease. Shortly\nafter this, studies on voluntary prisoners in Java demonstrated that beri-beri\nwas attributable to a dietary deficiency. The scientist behind these studies\nproposed that vitamin B1\u2014thiamine\u2014was the cause and that beri-beri could be\nremedied by supplying this \u201cvital amin\u201d (an alternative spelling of\n\u201camine\u201d)\u2014the origin of the term \u201cvitamin.\u201d\n\nIn 1937, Elvehjem et al. used a corn-fed dog model to demonstrate that\nsupplementing niacin could cure their black tongues and then they applied this\nto pellagra patients in the U.S. and Italy, curing them of their pellagra. But\nthat wasn\u2019t a sufficient demonstration, as the patients were hospitalized and\ncut off from other potential causes of the condition. So the Consiglio\nNazionale delle Ricerche started seeking out people with pellagra in natural\nsettings and offering them oral and intramuscular niacin as part of a trial.\nThe tongue and mouth lesions, the skin lesions, and the anorexia quickly came\nto an end. The source of pellagra was discovered after 400 years of suffering,\nand now the condition is virtually nonexistent in Europe.\n\nFor further reading on the history of pellagra in Italy, see Mariani-\nCostantini and Mariani-Costantini, and for more on globalization and health,\nsee Verginelli et al. A famous book documenting changes in dental\nquality\u2014among other things\u2014after the introduction of the Western diet is\nWeston Price\u2019s Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.\n\n13\n\nI discovered this report thanks to seeing the numbers on this page and\nthinking they were so unrealistic that it motivated me to track down the\nsource, confirming that they were, in fact, correct.\n\n14\n\nThere was also less public resistance to vaccination for smallpox than there\nis to certain other common disease vaccination campaigns today, although there\nwas still resistance and vaccine skepticism. Conspiracy theories about\nvaccines remain, and many misconceptions have been brought forward to maintain\nthe tenability of vaccine skepticism, like through claims that some vaccines\nare \u201cnot vaccines\u201d because they don\u2019t fit a contrived definition of what\nconstitutes a \u201cvaccine.\u201d\n\n15\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this study found a larger effect for deciduous than for\npermanent teeth. It\u2019s not clear why this is, but it could make something out\nof the London Bills of Mortality. In those, the word \u201cTeeth\u201d is used to denote\nthe death of someone young, a name given because of the recent eruption of\ntheir deciduous teeth. People in those ages had excessively high deaths for\nmany reasons, and in some scant records, that reason was explicitly noted to\nbe dental decay.\n\n16\n\nChlorhexidine mouthwash might also help critically ill patients avoid\ndeveloping ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n\n17\n\nI suspect powered brushes look more favorable than manual brushes in part\nbecause so many of them have time monitoring settings, so people end up using\nthem for longer than they do manual brushes.\n\n18\n\nNotably, BCS3-L1 has been subjected to some additional knockouts to cripple\nits horizontal gene transfer machinery, making it likely the most stable S.\nmutans out there.\n\n19\n\nThe cavity-riddled JH1140 rats were a bit lighter than the BCS3-L1 or control\nrats, but that wasn\u2019t significant.\n\n### Subscribe to Cremieux Recueil\n\nHundreds of paid subscribers\n\nI discuss papers that ought to be discussed.\n\n22 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n22\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Rise and Impending Fall of the Dental Cavity\n\nwww.cremieux.xyz\n\n4\n\nShare\n\n4 Comments\n\nMallard2 hrs agoLiked by Cremieux\"We\u2019ve come close to eliminating other\ndiseases, but no other disease has officially been eliminated.\"What about\nkuru?Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Cremieux\n\nMallard4 hrs agoLiked by CremieuxCould go for \"Rise and Fill\" for the\npun.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 more comments...\n\nBeware the Man of Many Studies\n\nLow-quality literatures mean meta-analyses are frequently worse than single\nstudies\n\nJun 5, 2023 \u2022\n\nCremieux\n\n68\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Beware the Man of Many Studies\n\nwww.cremieux.xyz\n\nThe Myth of Nigerian Excellence\n\nWhy do some people believe Nigerians are brilliant high-achievers?\n\nJan 11 \u2022\n\nCremieux\n\n48\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Myth of Nigerian Excellence\n\nwww.cremieux.xyz\n\nRanking Fields by p-Value Suspiciousness\n\nWhat proportion of reported p-values in your favorite field are between 0.05\nand 0.01?\n\nApr 22, 2023 \u2022\n\nCremieux\n\n93\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Ranking Fields by p-Value Suspiciousness\n\nwww.cremieux.xyz\n\n19\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cremieux\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
