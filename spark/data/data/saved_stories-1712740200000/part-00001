It\u2019s called Stories Are\nWeapons: Psychological Warfare and the American Mind, and it comes out on June\n4. The subject crept up on me, and not for the reasons you might think.\n\nIt all started over a decade ago at a science fiction convention in San Diego.\nI was talking to the writer Eugene Fisher about obscure writers that we loved.\nHe mentioned Cordwainer Smith, a mid-twentieth century author who had written\nabout human-animal hybrids of the distant future who led a revolution against\ntheir cyborg masters. It sounded amazing and weird, and I made a mental note\nto pick up some of Smith\u2019s work. It was only later that I discovered that\nCordwainer Smith was the pen name of Paul Linebarger, an intelligence\noperative who wrote the first Army manual devoted to the practice of\npsychological warfare in 1948.\n\nI had to know more. So I started digging, and what follows is some of what I\nfound. I was only able to cram a few of these gems into my book, so I've got a\ntreasure trove of stuff here that I've been dying to talk about.\n\nLinebarger\u2019s father was a judge in the Philippines who became a devoted\nfollower of Chinese nationalist Sun Yat-Sen. As a result, the young writer\nspent long stretches of his childhood under the tutelage of his godfather Sun\nYat-Sen in China, learning statecraft from his father\u2019s circle and Mandarin in\nschool. He grew up with two names: \u6797\u767d\u4e50 (Lin Bai-lo) and Paul Linebarger. As an\nadult, he published science fiction as Cordwainer Smith, realist fiction under\nthe name Felix C. Forrest, as well as a spy novel and an unpublished pop\npsychology book under the name Carmichael Smith. As a professional psywarrior,\nhe worked to overthrow the Communists in China \u2013 not for the glory of America,\nbut to continue the nationalist project of his mentor Sun Yat-Sen.\n\nThe 1948 edition of \"Psychological Warfare,\" and \"We the Underpeople,\" a\ncollection of Cordwainer Smith's short stories and a novel.\n\nNow declassified, Linebarger\u2019s Psychological Warfare is available from a\nnumber of print-on-demand publishers. I ordered a copy online, and read it\nalongside a collection of Cordwainer Smith stories called We the Underpeople.\nI couldn\u2019t believe the same person had written them. This guy who wrote about\nsubversive cat women and robot cities and weapons made from angry psychic\nweasels and mind control sex between people who are literally floating naked\ninside a chamber of flames \u2013 he had also codified the U.S. military\u2019s approach\nto psyops at the dawn of the Cold War? Really??\n\nAn array of membership and ID cards that Linebarger saved, now preserved among\nhis papers at the Hoover Institute. Note that his \"mystery writers\" name is\nCarmichael Smith, a name he used to publish a Cold War novel called \"Atomsk.\"\nUnder his legal name, he was part of the Cosmos Club, a private club in DC for\nthought leaders; and of course he was an Eisenhower man.\n\nI\u2019m not the first person to ask this question using italics and lots of\nquestion marks. A miniscule cottage industry of writing about Linebarger\u2019s\nlife explores whether he was secretly delusional, or perhaps dropping\nsubversive messages in his stories. Gary K. Wolfe, a literary critic who has\nwritten quite a bit about Linebarger\u2019s fiction, told me that some fans thought\nthe author had to be a time traveler because his futures felt so vivid and\nbizarrely detailed. There are even questions surrounding the people who study\nLinebarger. Alec Nevala-Lee, author of Astounding: John W. Campbell, Isaac\nAsimov, Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, and the Golden Age of Science\nFiction, said that he\u2019s heard a lot of wild speculation about UC Davis\npsychology professor Alan C. Elms, who spent decades writing a biography of\nLinebarger, but never published it for mysterious reasons.\n\nMy point is that Paul Linebarger was a psyop specialist whose life history\nreads like a psyop. It makes you want to do your own research, as the\nconspiracy influencers say. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Linebarger, but it\nwasn\u2019t because I thought he was some kind of time traveling superspy. His work\nmade me realize how much American propaganda strategies owed to science\nfiction.\n\nEventually, I followed my curiosity to the Hoover Institution Library &\nArchive at Stanford University, where Linebarger\u2019s papers are kept alongside\nhis father\u2019s.\n\nThis and the image below are from Linebarger\u2019s personal diaries, which he kept\nbetween the ages of 10 and 16. Above is a note from October 17, 1926, when he\nwas 13 years old. \u201cI love Shanghai. Paradise!!!\u201d he scrawls. \u201cI don\u2019t want to\ngo away. Never! Never!! Never!!!!!!\u201d He had just spent two years in China with\nhis family, and was very enthusiastic about travel.\n\nTwo photos taken February ninth, 1929. Linebarger was 15 years old, and was in\nhis first year at George Washington University.\n\nThese are some slips of paper and pictures he kept tucked into the front flap\nof his teen journal: Chinese language practice, a picture of himself on a ship\nwith a group of his father\u2019s compatriots and Sun Yat-Sen followers, a picture\nof the Horsehead Nebula cut out from a magazine, and a list of women\u2019s names\n(likely girls he\u2019d had crushes on \u2013 his journals are full of urgent romantic\ncommentary). It was wild to peer into the baby mind of a psywarrior, to see\nhow closely his childhood interests aligned with his adult profession. He\napproached science fiction and international policy as two strands in the same\nproject: Both were about explaining alien civilizations to each other, with a\nvery specific goal in mind.\n\nThe fragment of typewritten manuscript above is from a book called\n\u201cConversations with Sun Yat-sen,\u201d which he co-wrote with his father in the\nearly 1930s. It\u2019s from the introduction, written exclusively by the younger\nLinebarger, when he was both a college student and an his father\u2019s secretary,\nhelping with policy and intelligence analysis for the Chinese nationalist\ngovernment. He wanted to sow empathy for China among Americans, especially at\na time when racist immigration policies and political ignorance had distorted\nmany people's understanding of what was happening across the Pacific.\n\nHe writes: \u201cChina the Nation, in the mind of Sun Yat-sen, is the most\ndifficult of all his principles to interpret to the Western understanding.\nNationalism is so simple and intelligible a phenomenon when preached by Hitler\nand Mussolini that is seems impossible that any other doctrines should be\nnationalistic and yet run counter to the chauvinisms of the modern world.\u201d\n\nLinebarger goes on to describe Sun Yat-sen as something of a science fiction\nwriter, teaching his people about alien worlds beyond China. \u201cIt was the duty\nof Sun Yat-sen to persuade a world that it was no world, but a nation; to\npersuade his fellow-countrymen that their customs and traditions were not the\nuniversal laws of reason, but only the peculiarly fine development of one\ncivilization; to teach them that their world, whence patriotic and religious\nwars had long been banished, had to contend with a narrowing universe which\nhad brought forth other worlds, fantastically different, upon the same globe.\u201d\n\nI had to know more about where this overlap between genre fiction and\npsychological warfare began. So I delved deeper -- reading histories,\ninterviewing experts and practitioners -- and I found examples of U.S. psyops\ngoing back to the nation's earliest days. Two hundred years ago, propagandists\nwere using narrative techniques borrowed from many kinds of popular\nstorytelling: tabloid journalism, fantasy, cowboy stories, adventure tales,\ncomedy, horror. This was a tradition that Linebarger had inherited from\ngenerations of Americans before him. In the nineteenth century, for example,\npopular Western dime novels inspired pundits who pushed \"manifest destiny\" as\na policy. Newspaper accounts justifying the United States' wars on Indigenous\nnations often read like cowboy adventures set in an unclaimed, virgin land.\nUsing the tropes of popular entertainment helped pro-expansionists sell\nsettlers on the U.S. government policy of coercively relocating hundreds of\nthousands of people.\n\nIn World War II, Linebarger and many of his colleagues advised psywarriors to\nmake their products resemble movies, pulp fiction, radio, and other forms of\npopular entertainment. They also studied advertising for hints about how to\npersuade reluctant adversaries, and imitated the language of scientists to\nmake their lies sound trustworthy.\n\nMore of Paul Linebarger's identification cards -- these reflect his positions\nin the military and overseas.\n\nI think psyops specialists are often cast as secret agents who suppress\ndissent, cover up the truth, and push mindless conformity. But most of\nLinebarger's work focused on fomenting revolutionary movements. He wanted his\nwork to inspire ordinary people who feared their struggles against Nazis and\ndictators were doomed. In 1950, he wrote an unpublished monograph about how to\nencourage \"passive resistance,\" which he described as \"obstruction to\nauthority\" that doesn't involve an organized military force. People in such a\nmovement don't plant bombs, he wrote, but \"their hostility to authority\noutweighs their fear of authority.\" He credited this form of resistance\nmovement with challenging tyranny in Ukraine, China, Japan, and India.\n\nHe also compared it to art. \"Passive resistance in its more quiet and secret\nforms is essentially an artistic rather than a scientific undertaking,\" he\nwrote.\n\nHe was right. Psyops are an unsung speculative art. Some are brilliant, and\nothers are duds. But they are all attempts to create compelling, emotional\nstories that offer audiences a new perspective \u2013 and inspire them to take\naction.\n\nPsyops are also, fundamentally, lies -- often with violent overtones. Still,\nthe original 1948 version of Psychological Warfare concludes with a section\nabout \"psychological disarmament,\" where Linebarger imagined a world of\npsychological truths and peace. Border controls would be abolished, and the\ngovernment would fund education and public parks, while also guaranteeing a\nfree press.\n\nLinebarger saved several ration cards from World War II, including this one\nfor tobacco.\n\nAs the Cold War escalated, however, he abandoned this serene vision. In the\n1954 edition of Psychological Warfare, he explained that he had replaced the\ndisarmament chapters with a section on the future of psyops. His implication\nwas that psychological warfare would be permanent, with no ceasefire or\npeaceful resolution. And, as propaganda production grew more sophisticated, he\npredicted that more authors would join the cause. \"The artistic and cultural\naspect of writing is readily converted to propaganda usage,\" Linebarger wrote\nin the book's new conclusion.\n\nThroughout his life, Linebarger kept journals of his travels. Often, he would\njot down a sentence or two, describing the sounds of aircraft carriers or the\nway light glinted on the Nile at sunset. And sometimes, those notes showed\nLinebarger realizing that the United States had its own set of oppressive\nsystems that ought to be resisted.\n\nIn an undated note from the 1950s, Linebarger noted: \"The women assistants in\nWashington (Pentagon) astonish me more and more. One whom I have met has more\nbrains than any of the officers around here.\"\n\nUnlike most men in his profession at the time, Linebarger frequently\nacknowledged the contributions of women. Many of his major fictional\ncharacters are women, too -- including the heroes C'mel and D'joan, who lead\nresistance movements against the dictatorial Instrumentality, an interstellar\ngovernment that looms over much of his work. According to his biographer Alan\nC. Elms, Linebarger had hoped to use the pseudonym Lucy Estes on his first two\nbooks, but his publisher convinced him to use a man's name.\n\nI spoke to Linebarger's daughter Rosana Hart, who maintains a website devoted\nto her father's work. \"I think he thought that women were superior to men,\"\nshe told me. I wondered whether this feeling -- so out-of-step with dominant\nideas about women in the 1950s -- might have fueled his urge to generate new\nidentities for himself through writing. Maybe he was searching for a way to\nexpress an identity that was more fluid than the one the world allowed him.\n\nAn excerpt from an unpublished manuscript from the mid-1950s, written under\nthe name Carmichael Smith (Linebarger's \"crime writer\" pseudonym), devoted to\nwhat he called \"ethical dianetics,\" or \"mutual emotional aid.\" He points out\nthat one source of \"trouble\" for human psychology is the fact of our genitals,\nwhich cannot be talked about openly.\n\nAfter I talked to Hart, I kept thinking about Linebarger's fiction as a\nwrathful exercise in frustrated self-fashioning. There is an undeniable streak\nof cruelty in Linebarger\u2019s sci-fi stories \u2013 he revels in describing intense\nmental and physical torture, and many of his characters die in gruesome ways.\nHart told me that her father believed people should see the ugly side of\nhumanity, in order to understand the truth about the world. When she was a\nlittle girl, he made a point of telling her about the horrific things people\nhad done to each other in the wars he\u2019d studied and experienced firsthand. \u201cHe\nwould go into more detail about suffering than a child should have had to\nlisten to,\u201d she said.\n\nNo matter what Linebarger did, he was always trapped in a cold, liminal space\nbetween the worlds of China and the United States, propaganda and art. If he\ncouldn't inhabit the world as it was, perhaps he could use his words to bash a\nbetter one into being.\n\nWith his book Psychological Warfare, he codified a form of creativity whose\npurpose is to persuade, but also to intimidate, demoralize, and mislead. He\ndescribed psyops as an opportunity to aid the oppressed, but also a way to\nhurt adversaries.\n\nThis is the paradox at the heart of all propaganda. Unlike wild storytelling,\npsyops have a specific purpose: to become a weapon. Perhaps it is forged with\nthe intention of bringing justice to the oppressed. And perhaps its emotional\nammunition is aimed at the minds of the vulnerable. Either way, it is a weapon\nwhose power cannot be contained. Like a gun or a tank, it can be transferred\nfrom the military into civilian life, exploding our domestic policies, school\nboard meetings, healthcare access, and employment opportunities. And that is\nwhat Stories Are Weapons is about: how psyops designed for use against\nnational adversaries became weapons in a culture war between people who live\nin the United States.\n\n## Pre-order Stories Are Weapons now!\n\nYou can pre-order Stories Are Weapons now from your local indie bookstore!
