Additionally,\nMicrosoft (which now owns Blizzard) and NetEase have entered another separate\nagreement to bring NetEase games to Xbox and other platforms.\n\nBlizzard\u2019s games were taken offline in China in January 2023 after NetEase and\nBlizzard were unable to reach a new publishing deal. However, both companies\nhave now reached one. The deal will include all of the games that Chinese\nplayers had access to from the previous agreement, including ones like\nOverwatch, Diablo, and World of Warcraft.\n\nWhile both parties are working to relaunch the games, more details will be\nrevealed later. Phil Spencer chimed in on Microsoft\u2019s new partnership with\nNetEase, saying, \u201cReturning Blizzard\u2019s legendary games to players in China\nwhile exploring ways to bring more new titles to Xbox demonstrates our\ncommitment to bringing more games to more players around the world.\u201d However,\nSpencer provided no other specifics.\n\nThis new deal comes after Blizzard and NetEase had a bit of a falling out back\nin November 2022 when their oiriginal publishing contract was set to expire.\nBlizzard China and NetEase were pointing fingers at each other, where the\nformer offered to extend services, but the latter declined it, with one\nNetEase executive claiming that the original deal extension fell apart because\nof one specific \u201cjerk.\"\n\nEither way, Blizzard was committed to look for alternative ways to bring its\ngames back to the Chinese market, but it finally reached a new agreement with\nNetEase.\n\nGeorge Yang is a freelance writer for IGN.
