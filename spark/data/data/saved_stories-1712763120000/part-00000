Its founder can be considered to be the Persian\npolymath Rhazes (AD 852\u2013932), who was at one time the chief physician of the\nBaghdad hospital. His use of tactics and strategies in board games as\nmetaphors in real life to help his patients think clearer were rediscovered\nand employed by Fadul and Canlas.^[1]\n\nOne of the earliest reported cases of chess therapy involves the improvement\nin an isolated, schizoid, 16-year-old youth that took place after he became\ninterested in chess.^[2] Chess provided an outlet for his hostile impulses in\na non-retaliatory manner. Good use was made of the patient's digressions from\nthe game and his newly acquired ability to speak about his feelings, fantasies\nand dreams which the particular emotional situation of the game touched off.\nThe report demonstrates how the fact that chess is a game, and not real,\nenabled the patient to exert some conscious control over his feelings and thus\nlearn to master them to a limited extent.\n\nIn a relatively recent review by an Indian psycho-therapist, Thomas\nJanetius^[3] chess therapy is considered to be a form of creative therapy.\nChess games may contain most of what one needs to know about the causes of his\npsychological troubles; they can reveal why a person is as they are\u2014victim or\nmartyr, sexually impotent, deprived child looking for adventure, etc.\u2014but they\ncan also show the remedy for the disorder. The unconscious, through chess\ngames, is not concerned merely with putting right the things that have gone\nwrong. Chess games aim at well-being in the fullest sense; their goal is\nnothing less than complete personal victory or development in defeats, the\ncreative unfolding of the potentialities that are contained in the analysis of\nthe games played, whether won, lost or drawn.\n\nIn psychoanalysis chess games are wish fulfillment, and that an important part\nof these wish fulfillment are the result of repressed desires\u2014desires that can\nscare a person so much that their games may turn into a series of defeats.\nChess games can be divided into wishful games, anxiety games, and punitive\ngames. Punitive games are in fact also fulfillment of wishes, though not of\nwishes of the instinctual impulses but of those of the critical, censoring,\nand punishing agency in the controlling minds. Thus, for Jungian Psychology\nchess imagery is part of a universal symbolic language. Roumen Bezergianov\nuses chess as a Logotherapy method, to help his clients discover and fulfill\nthe meanings of their unique lives and life situations. He describes his\nmethod in the book Character Education with Chess.\n\nChess games are an open pathway toward true thoughts, emotions, and actions.\nChess games enables the player to somehow see their aggressive impulses and\ndesires. Chess games are a way of compensating for shortcomings in life. For\ninstance, if a person is unable to stand up to his boss, he may safely lash\nout an attack at a chess piece in a chess game. Thus chess games offer some\nsort of satisfaction that may be more socially acceptable. Some of the major\nbenefits that chess can offer come however, through its educational value for\nyounger children. In fact, chess has been proven to aid in skills such as\n\n  * Focusing: Having to observe carefully and concentrate;\n  * Visualizing: Imagining a sequence of actions before it happens;\n  * Thinking ahead: With the concept of \"think first, then act\";\n  * Weighing options: Finding pros and cons of various actions;\n  * Analyzing Concretely: Logical decisions are better than impulsive;\n  * Thinking abstractly: Taught to consider the bigger picture;\n  * Planning: Developing long range goals and bringing them about;\n  * Juggling multiple considerations simultaneously: Having to weigh various factors all at once.\n\nThroughout the US, a multitude of experiments have been conducted regarding\nthe true educational value of chess. In Marina, CA, an experiment with chess\nindicated that after only 20 days of instruction, students' academic\nperformance improved dramatically. It reported that 55% of students showed\nsignificant improvement in academic performance after only this brief time of\nchess instruction. Similarly, a 5-year study of 7th and 8th graders, by Robert\nFerguson of the Bradford School District showed that test scores improved\n17.3% for students regularly engaged in chess classes, compared with only\n4.56% for children participating in other forms of \"enrichment activities\"\nsuch as Future Problem Solving, Problem Solving with Computers, independent\nstudy, and creative writing. These beneficial effects were also present among\nSpecial Education students, improving their ability to socialize, and reducing\nincidents of suspension at school by at least 60%.\n\nGestalt therapy seeks to fill emotional voids so as to become a unified whole.\nSome chess games contain the rejected, disowned parts of the self. Every chess\npiece, tactic, and/or strategy in a chess game represents an aspect of oneself\nas shown in a case involving a boy with Landau\u2013Kleffner syndrome.^[4] In a\nsense, chess imagery is not part of a universal symbolic language because each\nchess game is unique to the individual who played it.\n\nIn Italy, the first study of chess therapy \"The Game of Chess as an\nEducational Aid in Compulsory Schooling for Deaf-and-dumb Children\" was\nconducted in 1992 from ASIS (Association for the Deaf). It was funded by the\nCNR (National Research Council), with the 92.02547.CT08 contract number. The\nresearch was conducted by psychologist and psychotherapist Massimo Marino,\nPresident of ASIS. Various searches that resulted in other publications were\nproduced dall'ASIS about treatment failure.^[5] The synthesis of these studies\nare summarized in the \"Book Scaccoterapia Complete Edition\".^[6]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Chess portal\n\n  * List of therapies\n  * Psychiatry\n  * Psychology\n  * Symbolic interactionism\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Fadul, J; Canlas, R (2009), Chess Therapy, Jose Fadul, ISBN 9780557076307, retrieved 2009-12-27\n  2. ^ Fleming, J; Strong, S (1945), Reider, N (ed.), \"Observations on the Use of Chess in the Therapy of an Adolescent Boy\", The Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 14: 562, retrieved 2009-12-27\n  3. ^ Janethius, T (27 October 2009), Creative Chess Therapy, ISBN 9780557076307, retrieved 2009-12-27\n  4. ^ Steven playing chess with his daddy after years of aphasia and subsequent speech therapy and treatments, 2009, archived from the original on 2021-12-20, retrieved 2011-10-05\n  5. ^ See http://www.asis89.it/.\n  6. ^ Daniela Fronzi - Massimo Marino \"Scacco-terapia apprendere la via della semplicit\u00e0 in 6 dimensioni\" - Il Cavallo Silenzioso Editore Asis 2016-07-16\n\nRetrieved from\n\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chess_therapy&oldid=1192053111\"\n\nCategories:\n\n  * Analytical psychology\n  * Psychotherapy by type\n  * Chess\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * Articles with short description\n  * Short description matches Wikidata\n\n  * This page was last edited on 27 December 2023, at 10:18 (UTC).\n  * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0; additional terms may apply.
