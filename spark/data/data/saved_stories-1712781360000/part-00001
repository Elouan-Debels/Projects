We must have\nvigorous discussions in the newsroom about how we serve the public as a\nwhole.\"\n\nA spokesperson for NPR said Chapin, who also serves as the network's chief\ncontent officer, would have no further comment.\n\n### Praised by NPR's critics\n\nBerliner is a senior editor on NPR's Business Desk. (Disclosure: I, too, am\npart of the Business Desk, and Berliner has edited many of my past stories. He\ndid not see any version of this article or participate in its preparation\nbefore it was posted publicly.)\n\nBerliner's essay, titled \"I've Been at NPR for 25 years. Here's How We Lost\nAmerica's Trust,\" was published by The Free Press, a website that has welcomed\njournalists who have concluded that mainstream news outlets have become\nreflexively liberal.\n\nBerliner writes that as a Subaru-driving, Sarah Lawrence College graduate who\n\"was raised by a lesbian peace activist mother,\" he fits the mold of a loyal\nNPR fan.\n\nYet Berliner says NPR's news coverage has fallen short on some of the most\ncontroversial stories of recent years, from the question of whether former\nPresident Donald Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, to the\norigins of the virus that causes COVID-19, to the significance and provenance\nof emails leaked from a laptop owned by Hunter Biden weeks before the 2020\nelection. In addition, he blasted NPR's coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nOn each of these stories, Berliner asserts, NPR has suffered from groupthink\ndue to too little diversity of viewpoints in the newsroom.\n\nThe essay ricocheted Tuesday around conservative media, with some labeling\nBerliner a whistleblower. Others picked it up on social media, including Elon\nMusk, who has lambasted NPR for leaving his social media site, X. (Musk\nemailed another NPR reporter a link to Berliner's article with a gibe that the\nreporter was a \"quisling\" \u2014 a World War II reference to someone who\ncollaborates with the enemy.)\n\nWhen asked for further comment late Tuesday, Berliner declined, saying the\nessay spoke for itself.\n\nThe arguments he raises \u2014 and counters \u2014 have percolated across U.S. newsrooms\nin recent years. The #MeToo sexual harassment scandals of 2016 and 2017 forced\nnewsrooms to listen to and heed more junior colleagues. The social justice\nmovement prompted by the killing of George Floyd in 2020 inspired a reckoning\nin many places. Newsroom leaders often appeared to stand on shaky ground.\n\nLeaders at many newsrooms, including top editors at The New York Times and the\nLos Angeles Times, lost their jobs. Legendary Washington Post Executive Editor\nMartin Baron wrote in his memoir that he feared his bonds with the staff were\n\"frayed beyond repair,\" especially over the degree of self-expression his\njournalists expected to exert on social media, before he decided to step down\nin early 2021.\n\nSince then, Baron and others \u2014 including leaders of some of these newsrooms \u2014\nhave suggested that the pendulum has swung too far.\n\n### Author Interviews\n\n### Legendary editor Marty Baron describes his 'Collision of Power' with Trump\nand Bezos\n\nNew York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger warned last year against journalists\nembracing a stance of what he calls \"one-side-ism\": \"where journalists are\ndemonstrating that they're on the side of the righteous.\"\n\n\"I really think that that can create blind spots and echo chambers,\" he said.\n\nInternal arguments at The Times over the strength of its reporting on\naccusations that Hamas engaged in sexual assaults as part of a strategy for\nits Oct. 7 attack on Israel erupted publicly. The paper conducted an\ninvestigation to determine the source of a leak over a planned episode of the\npaper's podcast The Daily on the subject, which months later has not been\nreleased. The newsroom guild accused the paper of \"targeted interrogation\" of\njournalists of Middle Eastern descent.\n\n### Heated pushback in NPR's newsroom\n\nGiven Berliner's account of private conversations, several NPR journalists\nquestion whether they can now trust him with unguarded assessments about\nstories in real time. Others express frustration that he had not sought out\ncomment in advance of publication. Berliner acknowledged to me that for this\nstory, he did not seek NPR's approval to publish the piece, nor did he give\nthe network advance notice.\n\nSome of Berliner's NPR colleagues are responding heatedly. Fernando Alfonso, a\nsenior supervising editor for digital news, wrote that he wholeheartedly\nrejected Berliner's critique of the coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict, for\nwhich NPR's journalists, like their peers, periodically put themselves at\nrisk.\n\nAlfonso also took issue with Berliner's concern over the focus on diversity at\nNPR.\n\n\"As a person of color who has often worked in newsrooms with little to no\npeople who look like me, the efforts NPR has made to diversify its workforce\nand its sources are unique and appropriate given the news industry's long-\nstanding lack of diversity,\" Alfonso says. \"These efforts should be celebrated\nand not denigrated as Uri has done.\"\n\nAfter this story was first published, Berliner contested Alfonso's\ncharacterization, saying his criticism of NPR is about the lack of diversity\nof viewpoints, not its diversity itself.\n\n\"I never criticized NPR's priority of achieving a more diverse workforce in\nterms of race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. I have not 'denigrated' NPR's\nnewsroom diversity goals,\" Berliner said. \"That's wrong.\"\n\n### Questions of diversity\n\nUnder former CEO John Lansing, NPR made increasing diversity, both of its\nstaff and its audience, its \"North Star\" mission. Berliner says in the essay\nthat NPR failed to consider broader diversity of viewpoint, noting, \"In D.C.,\nwhere NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered\nDemocrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans.\"\n\nBerliner cited audience estimates that suggested a concurrent falloff in\nlistening by Republicans. (The number of people listening to NPR broadcasts\nand terrestrial radio broadly has declined since the start of the pandemic.)\n\nFormer NPR vice president for news and ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin tweeted, \"I\nknow Uri. He's not wrong.\"\n\nOthers questioned Berliner's logic. \"This probably gets causality somewhat\nbackward,\" tweeted Semafor Washington editor Jordan Weissmann. \"I'd guess that\na lot of NPR listeners who voted for [Mitt] Romney have changed how they\nidentify politically.\"\n\nSimilarly, Nieman Lab founder Joshua Benton suggested the rise of Trump\nalienated many NPR-appreciating Republicans from the GOP.\n\nIn recent years, NPR has greatly enhanced the percentage of people of color in\nits workforce and its executive ranks. Four out of 10 staffers are people of\ncolor; nearly half of NPR's leadership team identifies as Black, Asian or\nLatino.\n\n\"The philosophy is: Do you want to serve all of America and make sure it\nsounds like all of America, or not?\" Lansing, who stepped down last month,\nsays in response to Berliner's piece. \"I'd welcome the argument against that.\"\n\n\"On radio, we were really lagging in our representation of an audience that\nmakes us look like what America looks like today,\" Lansing says. The U.S.\nlooks and sounds a lot different than it did in 1971, when NPR's first show\nwas broadcast, Lansing says.\n\nA network spokesperson says new NPR CEO Katherine Maher supports Chapin and\nher response to Berliner's critique.\n\nThe spokesperson says that Maher \"believes that it's a healthy thing for a\npublic service newsroom to engage in rigorous consideration of the needs of\nour audiences, including where we serve our mission well and where we can\nserve it better.\"\n\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent\nDavid Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing\nEditor Gerry Holmes.
