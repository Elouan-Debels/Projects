One-fifth said\nthey\u2019d used generative AI for multimedia, including social graphics and\nvideos.\n\n\u201cNews people have stayed on top of this conversation, which is good because\nthis technology is already presenting significant disruptions to how\njournalists and newsrooms approach their work and we need everyone to help us\nfigure this technology out for the industry,\u201d said Aimee Rinehart, co-author\nand senior product manager of AI strategy at the AP.\n\nRepresentatives from legacy media, public broadcasters and magazines were\namong the 292 surveyed, mostly based in the U.S. or Europe; more than 30% of\nthose who responded were from newsrooms with more than 100 editorial\nemployees.\n\nThe AP, which has been dabbling in AI for a decade, recently helped five local\nnewsrooms develop generative AI tools.\n\n\u201cWe reached deep into our AI in journalism networks to recruit participants\nfor the survey, and not surprisingly, most of the people who took the survey\nhad familiarity with generative AI in some form,\u201d said Ernest Kung, co-author\nand AI product manager at the AP. \u201cI was intrigued by the wide variety of\ncurrent uses of generative AI journalists described.\u201d\n\nSo while the numbers show some comfort with using generative AI, those\nsurveyed likely have had more time to experiment with technology in their\nnewsrooms. But the research shows that for any news organization looking to\nstay relevant, familiarity with AI is a must.\n\n\u201cExperiment, experiment, experiment,\u201d said Hannes Cools, assistant professor\nat the University of Amsterdam and co-author of the study. \u201cResponsible\nexperimentation could spark discussion, and that could lead to more\nresponsible use. I do believe that generative AI is here to stay, and it will\n(if it hasn\u2019t already) be present in many aspects of our daily lives.\u201d\n\nThe tension between ethics and innovation drove Poynter\u2019s creation of an AI\nethics starter kit for newsrooms last month. The AP \u2014 which released its own\nguidelines last August \u2014 found less than half of respondents have guidelines\nin their newsrooms, while about 60% were aware of some guidelines about the\nuse of generative AI.\n\nCools was surprised to learn that generative AI guidelines was not the top\nanswer to a question about responsible use of the technology. Instead,\nrespondents said they\u2019d simply verify what they got from an AI program \u2014 or\nnot use AI at all.\n\n\u201c... (T)here was also mention of using their gut feeling to evaluate\nresponsible use,\u201d Cool said in an email. \u201cThis was quite surprising to me\nstill, as we might not want to trust our gut feeling for judging what is\nethical use.\u201d\n\nSome other highlights from the study:\n\n  * 54% said they\u2019d \u201cmaybe\u201d let AI companies train their models using their content.\n  * 49% said their workflows have already changed because of generative AI.\n  * 56% said the AI generation of entire pieces of content should be banned.\n  * Only 7% of those who responded were worried about AI displacing jobs.\n  * 18% said lack of training was a big challenge for ethical use of AI. \u201cTraining is lovely, but time spent on training is time not spent on journalism \u2014 and a small organization can\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d said one respondent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting moment for journalism and technology, maybe a little too\nexciting, which makes it difficult to plan for the next year let alone what\nmay transpire in the next 10 years,\u201d said Rinehart. \u201cOne thing is clear from\nthis research: more research is needed on AI and newsrooms, especially on\nworkflow efficiency claims.\u201d\n\nSupport high-integrity, independent journalism that serves democracy.
