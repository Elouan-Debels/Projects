Instead, it lost more than 200 existing\npositions in Arlington in 2023 \u2014 a drop-off that will likely affect how much\nmoney it receives from the state. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The\nWashington Post.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cLast year we made the tough decision to eliminate a small percentage of\ncorporate roles and to slow hiring around the globe, which impacted our\nforecast growth in HQ2,\u201d Holly Sullivan, the company\u2019s vice president of\nworldwide economic development, said in a statement Monday evening.\n\nSullivan said the company has not abandoned its target of 25,000 jobs. She\ncalled the project \u201ca long-term investment\u201d and noted that there are 1,000\nopen positions at HQ2, where two soaring office towers \u2014 part of a total $2\nbillion investment \u2014 opened last year.\n\nBut amid a shift in work habits prompted by the coronavirus pandemic and a\nsqueeze in the tech industry, the downturn in hiring marks another setback in\nthe boost Amazon had initially promised to the area. Even as its contractor\nbegan installing utilities last month on an empty plot of land at HQ2,\nconstruction on another three office buildings and futuristic \u201cHelix\u201d supposed\nto go there has been on pause for more than a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTo receive subsidies from the state, Amazon must submit a document to the\ncommonwealth every spring detailing its total hiring progress at HQ2 since\n2019.\n\nIts application last April said the company had hired 6,939 employees for\nqualifying jobs, out of 8,000 total positions in Arlington. Amazon\u2019s report\nthis year said it had filled 6,644 qualifying jobs and had 7,791 total\nemployees assigned to HQ2.\n\nVirginia\u2019s incentives for the company are supposed to reward its progress\ntoward a goal of bringing 25,000 new jobs to Arlington by 2030. They are also\nstructured to ensure that the company maintains those new jobs for at least\nfive years.\n\nState officials will pay the company $22,000 for each full-time job with an\naverage salary of $150,000, according to the contract. (That salary is\nsupposed to climb slightly each year; it was $159,205 last year.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAmazon\u2019s application last year asked the state for nearly $153 million in\ntaxpayer subsidies to be paid by late 2026. The hiring slump reflected in the\nmost recent report probably means Virginia\u2019s payout could drop by several\nmillion dollars if hiring stays flat in the next year and a half.\n\nBecause the company submitted a \u201cprogress report\u201d this year instead of a\nformal application, Virginia will probably not pay Amazon any incentives in\n2027. The company had also declined to apply for incentives from the\ncommonwealth until 2021, citing pandemic-related challenges, even though it\nhad consistently been ahead of schedule on hiring at HQ2.\n\nThis year\u2019s report marks the first time that Amazon has fallen behind on its\nhiring goals in Arlington.\n\nThis story is developing and will be updated.\n\n  * Youngkin joins Va. antiabortion march despite issue\u2019s political cost\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nYoungkin joins Va. antiabortion march despite issue\u2019s political cost\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\n  * A doctor tried to renew his passport.
