This study advances our understanding of the critical role employment\nplays in our health by examining how employment patterns throughout our\nworking lives, based on work schedules, may shape our health at age 50, paying\nparticular attention to the moderating role of social position. The National\nLongitudinal Survey of Youth-1979 (NLSY79), which has collected 30+ years of\nlongitudinal information, was used to examine how employment patterns starting\nat ages 22 (n \u2248 7,336) might be associated with sleep hours and quality,\nphysical and mental functions, and the likelihood of reporting poor health and\ndepressive symptoms at age 50. Sequence analysis found five dominant\nemployment patterns between ages 22 and 49: \u201cmostly not working\u201d (10%), \u201cearly\nstandard hours before transitioning into mostly variable hours\u201d (12%), \u201cearly\nstandard hours before transitioning into volatile schedules\u201d (early ST-\nvolatile, 17%), \u201cmostly standard hours with some variable hours\u201d (35%), and\n\u201cstable standard hours\u201d (26%). The multiple regression analyses indicate that\nhaving the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d schedule pattern between ages 22 and 49 was\nconsistently, significantly associated with the poorest health, including the\nfewest hours of sleep per day, the lowest sleep quality, the lowest physical\nand mental functions, and the highest likelihood of reporting poor health and\ndepressive symptoms at age 50. In addition, social position plays a\nsignificant role in these adverse health consequences. For example, whereas\nnon-Hispanic White women reported the most hours of sleep and non-Hispanic\nBlack men reported the fewest, the opposite was true for sleep quality. In\naddition, non-Hispanic Black men with less than a high school education had\nthe highest likelihood of reporting poor health at age 50 if they engaged in\nan employment pattern of \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d between ages 22 and 49. In\ncomparison, non-Hispanic White men with a college degree or above education\nhad the lowest likelihood of reporting poor health if they engaged in an\nemployment pattern of stable standard hours. This analysis underscores the\ncritical role of employment patterns in shaping our daily routines, which\nmatter to sleep and physical and mental health as we approach middle\nadulthood. Notably, the groups with relatively disadvantaged social positions\nare also likely to be subject to nonstandard work schedules, including non-\nHispanic Blacks and people with low education; hence, they were more likely\nthan others to shoulder the harmful links between nonstandard work schedules\nand sleep and health, worsening their probability of maintaining and nurturing\ntheir health as they approach middle adulthood.\n\n## Figures\n\nCitation: Han W-J (2024) How our longitudinal employment patterns might shape\nour health as we approach middle adulthood\u2014US NLSY79 cohort.

For instance, innovations in medicine and\npublic health have increased life expectancy in the United States from 48\nyears in 1900 to 76 years in 2000 [2]. However, since the 1990s, health\nimprovements might have been blunted by the increased prevalence of precarious\nemployment [3]. Precarious jobs are defined as those with poor working\nconditions and weak power relations, including low wages, unpredictable or\nunstable hours, few or no benefits, and weak or no bargaining power. One of\nthe essential indicators of a precarious job is working outside of traditional\n9:00 to 5:00 hours, such as during early mornings, evenings, or nights, or\nhaving irregular hours (e.g., rotating, split, or unpredictable hours). Such\nwork patterns are sometimes called nonstandard work schedules [4] or shiftwork\n[5]. Prior research has found that these jobs have physically exhausted and\nemotionally drained U.S. workers [3]. Recently, the COVID-19 crisis has\nheightened existing inequalities, as people engaging in shiftwork (ironically\nlabeled \u201cessential\u201d work) experience greater exposure to infection and higher\ndeath tolls [6].\n\nApproximately one-third of the workforce globally has a work schedule\nconsidered nonstandard or shiftwork [7]. Dr. Harriet Presser [8] was among the\nfirst to extensively document this labor force transformation. Her seminal\nworks provide insights into not only the prevalence of such work schedules but\nalso their potential implications for the well-being of individuals and their\nfamilies [4, 8]. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that nonstandard work\nschedules dictate when we can sleep, with implications for our sleep quality\nand overall physical and mental health [5]. Studies using samples from\ndifferent occupations (e.g., nurses, truck drivers) [9, 10] and countries\n(e.g., Canada, European countries, Singapore, South Korea, and the United\nStates) [1, 5, 11\u201313] have consistently documented significantly worse health\noutcomes, including shorter sleep and a lower quality of sleep, among those\nwith nonstandard work schedules compared to their counterparts. A growing line\nof scholarship has also documented well-established adverse associations\nbetween nonstandard work schedules, particularly night shifts, and a higher\nlikelihood of poor physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease) and mental\nhealth (e.g., anxiety, depression) [1, 5, 8].\n\nMissing from the extant scholarship are longer term longitudinal studies using\na life-course perspective with sequence analysis to examine how work schedule\npatterns might be associated with our sleep and health as we approach middle\nadulthood [14]. This study extends our knowledge by using the National\nLongitudinal Study of Youth-1979, a nationally representative sample of about\n7,000 people in the U.S. over 30 years, from ages 22 to 50. I focus on work\nschedule patterns in the United States throughout individuals\u2019 working lives\nto underscore the critical role of employment in our daily experience and thus\nour health. This study also fills a literature gap by paying attention to how\nsuch a link might differ by social position, as reflected by race-ethnicity,\ngender, and education. This study, therefore, provides new insights into\nfactors shaping our well-being on a global scale given that nonstandard work\nschedules are increasingly becoming a global phenomenon [15].\n\n### Life-course approach using a cumulative advantage and disadvantage (CAD)\nlens\n\nThis study builds on the life-course perspective [16, 17] to conceptualize the\nassociation between employment throughout adulthood and sleep and health at\nage 50. Specifically, firstly, drawing on a fundamental principle of the life-\ncourse perspective\u2014that human development and aging are lifelong processes,\nwith the appreciation that the past shapes the future\u2014this study uses\nlongitudinal data to conceptualize and empirically examine how work patterns\nduring one\u2019s working life between ages 22 and 49 may shape sleep and physical\nand mental health at age 50. Importantly, our health is shaped by daily events\noccurring to and around us but may not manifest their effects until years\nlater. Hence, studying working lives over substantial periods allows one to\nidentify and investigate long-term associations between changes in our\nemployment concerning work schedules and our health. For example, we can never\nbe certain that no association between employment patterns and our sleep and\nhealth exists merely based on short-term null effects. Building upon this\nprinciple, this study answers the following research question: How might\nlifetime work trajectories shape future health outcomes? Secondly, drawing on\nthe principle of timing\u2014that the health consequences of event transitions and\npatterns vary according to their timing in a person\u2019s life\u2014this study uses\nlongitudinal data spanning more than 30 years of an individual\u2019s life to\nunderstand how transitions between work schedules over time may shape sleep\nand health at age 50. By examining work trajectories, this study, thus, pays\nattention to the paths of changes in individuals\u2019 employment patterns and\ntransitions that might shape their health, taking a long view of the life\ncourse. Building upon this principle, this study also answers the following\nresearch question: How might transitions between schedules (for example,\ndaytime hours to evening or night hours) be associated with our sleep (hours\nand quality) and our future physical and mental health? Overall, examining the\nconstraints imposed by employment patterns, particularly work schedules, with\na life-course lens allows us to understand how favorable work conditions from\nearly adulthood to old age contribute to better health in an individual\u2019s\nlifetime, with significant implications for the well-being of future\ngenerations.\n\nFurthermore, I pay special attention to how the links between employment\npatterns throughout one\u2019s working life and sleep health at age 50 might vary\nby social position, identified in this study through race-ethnicity, gender,\nand education. I adopt the cumulative advantage and disadvantage (CAD)\nframework [18, 19], which assumes our social positions (e.g., race, ethnicity,\ngender) interact with macro systems and institutions (e.g., employment) to\nshape our opportunities and constraints throughout our lifetime, influencing\nour health by generating increasing disparities in resources between those who\nhave and those who have not [16, 18, 19]. Importantly, some work schedules\n(e.g., daytime hours) are more likely than others (e.g., irregular hours) to\nbenefit our sleep and health [1, 5]. By considering social position in this\ninvestigation, I shed light on the prevalent health disparities among\ndifferent social position groups that might partly result from work schedule\npatterns over time.\n\n### Health consequences of work schedules\n\nSince the late 1990s, studies using both US and non-US samples have examined\nthe links between work schedules and social, psychological, and physical well-\nbeing of individuals [1, 8, 20] and family members, including children [4, 21,\n22]. These studies have largely found weak to moderate adverse associations\nbetween working nonstandard hours and the well-being of workers and their\nfamilies, particularly when such a schedule was chosen involuntarily (e.g., a\njob requirement). One of the immediate adverse health consequences is a\ndecline in the amount and quality of sleep for workers with nonstandard hours\nbecause these schedules (e.g., night shifts) counter our circadian rhythm,\nwhich is critical for maintaining and sustaining good health [5]. Health\nissues stemming from severe sleep deprivation and low sleep quality due to\nnonstandard work schedules have been labeled Shift Work Sleep Disorder (SWSD)\nby academics and experts in the medical field [5]. People with SWSD tend to\nreport the following symptoms: trouble sleeping, excessive sleepiness, and\ntiredness. These symptoms compromise one\u2019s overall physical and mental\nfunctions, leading to poor general health [5]. Regarding other health\nconsequences, one study showed that 38% of people working an 8-hour night\nshift had a BMI \u226530 versus 26% of people working an 8-hour day shift (p < .05)\n[23]. Another study found that people with nonstandard work schedules are also\n42% more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms than those with standard\nschedules [24].\n\nOur understanding of the links between work schedules and sleep and health has\nalso been refined through increasingly sophisticated data, including from\nsmall cross-sectional samples [12, 25], nationally representative samples [1,\n26], and panel data [27, 28]. For example, using two-year longitudinal data on\napproximately 1,500 Norweigan nurses, Waage and colleagues found that nurses\nworking night hours the prior year were more likely to report acute sleepiness\nor insomnia related to shiftwork in the current year [27]. Importantly, those\nwho stopped working night shifts were more likely to report a reduction in\nexcessive sleepiness and less insomnia. A recent study using panel data from\n2002 to 2018 in Germany found that individuals who perceived their work as\ninvolving nonstandard work schedules, high job insecurity, and low social\nrights were more likely to have poorer physical and mental health than their\ncounterparts, and chronic exposure to or transitioning into such work might\npredict poorer health than otherwise [28]. This study builds on this emerging\nliterature to advance our knowledge by using sequence analysis to document the\nchanges in work trajectories and then examining how those changes/trajectories\nmight be associated with sleep and health.\n\n#### The importance of social position.\n\nAnother line of studies has shown that social position shapes our likelihood\nof having jobs requiring nonstandard work schedules [3, 8]. For example,\nPresser extensively documented that in the United States, young workers,\nBlacks, and people with a high school or lower education are particularly\nsubject to working nonstandard schedules [8]. In addition, whereas men are\nmore likely than women to have nonstandard schedules, the distribution can\nvary greatly by occupation. Nurses are a prime example of a female-dominated\noccupation requiring nonstandard work schedules, particularly night shifts. A\nsubstantial line of scholarship has documented that, compared to their\ncounterparts, female workers with nonstandard work schedules, particularly\nnight shifts, have substantially higher odds of experiencing sleep disturbance\nand fatigue [26], stroke [29], and breast cancer [30]. In addition, studies\nhave shown that both shift work and being an African American independently\nincrease the odds of having high blood pressure [31]. A growing body of\nevidence has also found that people of racial-ethnic minority groups are more\nlikely to get insufficient or low-quality sleep. Adverse sleep issues, such as\ninsomnia, may also help account for increasing health disparities, such as\nhigher rates of cardiovascular disease among racial-ethnic minority groups\n[32]. The higher share of African Americans with jobs requiring nonstandard\nschedules than their counterparts does not help and may indeed further\nintensify the high prevalence of sleep issues among people of color.\n\nHence, employment carries long-lasting implications for the social,\npsychological, physical, and economic well-being of workers and their\nfamilies, with significant implications for inequality across generations, a\ncentral CAD tenet. The rise in precarious jobs, particularly among those in\nrelatively disadvantaged social positions, motivates the need to investigate\nwhether engaging in nonstandard work schedules over time may translate into\nlong-term health consequences. A previous study [33] using the same data as\nthe current analysis found that individuals in various social positions such\nas men, Blacks, and people with low educational attainment (e.g., high school\nor less) were more likely to have ever worked nonstandard hours between ages\n18 and 39 than were their corresponding counterparts. Importantly, compared to\nmen, women were more likely to have either never or always had nonstandard\nwork schedules by age 39. This finding reflects the reality that women-\ndominated occupations often require nonstandard hours (e.g., nurses, home\nhealth aides).\n\n### The present study\n\nThe field has established a decent set of scholarship on the associations\nbetween work schedules and sleep and health, including the consequences for\nfamily and child well-being. The implication is thus clear. People in the U.S.\nand around the world are increasingly subject to nonstandard work schedules,\ncreating work-induced health disparities [1, 3, 4, 12]. However, we have yet\nto understand how employment patterns over the life-course may shape our\nhealth as we approach middle adulthood. Furthermore, a long line of extant\nresearch has shown how some social positions may act as vulnerabilities,\nputting people on a disadvantaged trajectory throughout their lifetime [3, 17,\n20]. Hence, drawing upon the CAD framework, this study pays attention to three\nmarkers representing social position\u2014race-ethnicity, gender, and education\u2014to\nhighlight how the intersectionality between employment and social position may\naccumulate advantages and disadvantages throughout a lifetime, manifested in\nour sleep behaviors and general health. By using a nationally representative\nsample of youths aged 14\u201322 in 1979 in the United States, this analysis\naddresses this evidence gap by building upon the life-course and CAD lens to\nanswer the following research questions: how might lifetime work trajectories\n(between ages 22 and 49) be associated with health outcomes as we approach\nmiddle adulthood (at age 50), and how might such an association differ due to\nthe intersectionality between work and social position? Notably, the\nlongitudinal data used in this analysis allow researchers to track employment\npatterns during a period when working nonstandard hours was on the rise [7,\n12].\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Data\n\nThis study used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1979 (NLSY79), which\ncomprises a nationally representative sample of Americans between the ages of\n14 and 22 in 1979 (N = 12,686). NLSY79 interviewed respondents every year\nuntil 1994 and biennially thereafter. The current analysis excludes two\ndiscontinued oversamples: non-Black non-Hispanic disadvantaged youths,\ndiscontinued in 1990 (n = 1,643), and military youth, discontinued in 1984 (n\n= 1,280). A total of 9,763 respondents served as the starting point after\nexcluding these two discontinued oversamples. The response rates of NLSY79\nhave been remarkably high, ranging from 96% in the early survey years to about\n77% in recent years [34, 35]. The NYLS79 is well suited to this study due to\nits rich data on longitudinal sociodemographic characteristics (e.g.,\neducation, marriage, number of children) and work schedules.\n\nI use outcome measures at age 50 and begin the sample at age 22. I chose age\n50 for two primary reasons. First, as this study was built upon a life-course\nlens, focusing on age 50 allowed me to examine employment patterns over an\nextended period of time, from ages 22 to 49. Second, NLSY79 collects health\noutcomes in the health modules at ages 40, 50, and 60. By 2018 (the most\nupdated data as of this analysis), most participants had reached age 50 but\nonly a small proportion (10%) had reached age 60. Therefore, using age 50\nmeant the sample comprised the majority of the participants. I also had two\nprimary reasons for selecting age 22 as the starting point for the employment\npatterns. First, NLSY79 did not collect information on ages 14\u201318 for those\nwho were 19\u201322 in 1979, the first interview year. Second, more than 30% of the\nNLSY79 participants were in college between ages 18 and 22. During this\nperiod, their jobs, if they had one, were more likely to be temporary or part\ntime [33]. Therefore, age 22 is a plausible beginning point for establishing a\ncareer for many participants, particularly the college graduates in the\nsample.\n\n### Participants\n\nThe final analysis excluded participants who were missing information on the\nsleep outcome at age 50 (n = 2,052) or on employment between ages 22 and 49 (n\n= 6). Furthermore, approximately 5% of cases (n = 369) were missing\ninformation on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., from < 0.01% on\neducation to about 4% on parental education). The final analyzed samples after\nthese exclusions were 7,336 for the dependent variable of sleep quality, 7,324\nfor average sleep hours per day over a week, 7,334 for general health status,\n7,262 for physical and mental functions, and 7,271 for depression symptoms.\nFollowing previous research, missing values for the dependent variables were\nnot imputed to avoid measurement noise [36]. The pattern of missing values on\nthese dependent variables suggests that the older participants (e.g., 19 or\nolder in 1979) were more likely than the younger participants to have missing\nvalues on the dependent variables. This missing pattern suggests a positive\nselection bias; younger or healthier participants more likely to remain in the\nlongitudinal study. No other significant differences in sociodemographic\nvariables were found between those with and without missing outcome measures.\n\n### Measures\n\n#### Sleep.\n\nHours. As part of the age 50+ health modules, the NLSY79 asked how many hours\nof sleep the participant typically gets at night on a weekday, and a separate\nquestion asked about the weekend. Using both questions, I created a new\nvariable to represent the average number of hours a participant gets per day\nacross a 7-day week. As a robustness check, the analysis was also run using\nthree individual variables as the outcomes: average number of hours of sleep\non a weekday, average number of hours of sleep on the weekend, and average\nnumber of hours of sleep per day across a 7-day week. The results were similar\nto those presented here. Note that information about sleep was not collected\nbefore the participants turned 50.\n\nQuality. As part of age 50+ health modules, participants were asked how\nfrequently they had experienced the following four issues over the last month:\n\u201chave trouble falling asleep,\u201d \u201cwake up and have trouble falling back asleep,\u201d\n\u201cwake up too early and have trouble falling back asleep,\u201d and \u201cfeel unrested\nduring the day despite the amount of sleep.\u201d Respondents answered using a\n4-point Likert scale ranging from \u201calmost always (4+ times per week)\u201d to\n\u201crarely or never (once a month or less).\u201d These four questions are commonly\nused in studies examining sleep quality or disturbance [37]. A standardized\nscore with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 was created from these\nfour questions with excellent reliability (\u03b1 = 0.84). The higher the score,\nthe better the sleep quality was.\n\n#### Poor health.\n\nThe NLSY79 collects information on general health status by asking\nparticipants to assess their general health, ranging from excellent (1) to\npoor (5). I created a dichotomous variable that received a value of 1 if the\nparticipant reported having either \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d health, and 0 otherwise.\n\n#### SF12 physical and mental health.\n\nThe NLSY79 adopted the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12 v1) to rate\nself-reported mental and physical health. The NLSY79 administered this scale\nas part of the 50+ health modules to those who had turned 50 since their last\ninterview. These data were collected between the interview years of 2008 and\n2016. Specifically, the respondents were asked 12 questions about the past 4\nweeks, including whether pain had interfered with normal work, whether their\nhealth had limited their moderate activities, and their frequency of feeling\ndownhearted or blue. The possible responses, given the nature of the question,\ninclude a 3-point Likert scale (not limited at all, limited a little, limited\na lot) and a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from \u201call the time\u201d to \u201cnone of the\ntime\u201d). This study used the global scores representing physical and mental\nfunctions created by the NLSY79, following the scoring established by Ware,\nKosinski, and Keller [38]. The SF-12 has been shown to have good reliability\n(e.g., 0.89) and validity [38] and can detect active and recent depressive\ndisorders [39]. NLSY79 standardized the scores to have a mean of 50 and a\nstandard deviation of 10; a score of 50 corresponds to the U.S. average, and a\none-point difference is one-tenth of a standard deviation [40]. Previous\nresearch has shown that the NLSY79 sample tends to have a higher-than-average\nscore on SF-12 mental function and just about the average score on SF-12\nphysical function [40]. The higher the score, the better the function is.\n\n#### Depressive symptoms.\n\nAs part of the age 50+ health modules, NLSY79 used seven items from the Center\nfor Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [41] to collect data on\nrespondents\u2019 depressive symptoms [42]. Respondents were asked how they felt\nduring the past week through prompts such as \u201cI felt depressed\u201d and \u201cI felt\nlonely,\" with possible responses on a scale of 0 (rarely/none of the time/1\nday) to 3 (most/all of the time/5\u20137 days). The NLSY79 created a total CES-D\nscore (ranging from 0 to 21) by summing the responses of all seven questions.\nA higher score indicates more depressive symptoms. The scale score was coded\nas missing if one item was missing. Compared to the original 20-item CES-D,\nthis short form has similar or higher reliability and validity [43]. Prior\nstudies have found a score of 8 or greater to have acceptable specificity and\nmodest sensitivity with the standard CES-D cutoff score of 16 [43]; this study\nthus used this cutoff score to identify individuals with symptoms putting them\nat clinical risk of depression.\n\n#### Work schedules.\n\nAt every survey year, the NLSY79 asked participants about their work\nschedules. This study followed NLSY\u2019s definitions and responses to create five\nwork statuses. Specifically, a \u201cstandard\u201d work schedule was defined as work\nbeginning at 6 a.m. or later and ending by 6 p.m., \u201cevenings\u201d as work\nbeginning at 2 p.m. or later and ending by midnight, \u201cnights\u201d as work\nbeginning at 9 p.m. or later and ending by 8 a.m., and \u201cvariable\u201d if the\nparticipant had either split or rotating shift or irregular hours. \u201cNot\nworking\u201d was used when participants answered \u201cnot working at any job.\u201d These\nfive work statuses were used in the sequence analysis to arrive at possible\nclusters describing individuals\u2019 employment patterns and trajectories.\n\n#### Social position.\n\nThis study used three indicators to define social position independent of\nemployment patterns: gender, race-ethnicity, and education. The choice of\nthese three indicators is to avoid reverse causality. For example, low-income\nstatus during adulthood tends to be highly associated with working nonstandard\nhours. However, nonstandard work schedules could lead to low-income status\ninstead of vice versa. In this case, low-income status might be better\nconceptualized as a mediator instead of a moderator in the association between\nemployment and health. The year 1979 was used as the data point to identify\ngender as either woman or man (as the reference group). In 1979, separate\nquestions were asked about race and ethnicity. These two pieces of information\nwere used to define four racial-ethnic groups: non-Hispanic White (reference\ngroup; Whites hereafter), non-Hispanic Black (Blacks hereafter), Hispanic, and\nothers. Participants\u2019 highest educational degree completed by age 23 was used\nto determine educational achievement with four dichotomous groups: less than a\nhigh school degree (<12 years of schooling), a high school degree (12 years of\nschooling, reference group), some college (13\u201315 years of schooling), and\ncollege or higher (16+ years of schooling).\n\n#### Sociodemographic characteristics.\n\nA rich set of sociodemographic characteristics was considered in all analyses\nto address the potential unobserved heterogeneity between participants and\nselection bias that might explain the associations between employment patterns\nand sleep and health [1, 8]. These variables include age in 1979; background\ncharacteristics at age 14, including not living with both biological parents,\nparental education (i.e., less than high school, high school as the reference\ngroup, some college, or college or higher), and living location (suburban,\nrural, versus urban); region of residence at age 22 (Northeast, Midwest, West,\nversus South); any health issues that limited the ability to work by age 22;\nbeing a parent by age 22; ever experiencing poverty before age 23; ever\nreceiving welfare before age 23; the number of years living in poverty between\nages 22 and 49; the number of years receiving welfare between ages 22 and 49;\nnumber of marriages by age 49; number of children by age 49; average weekly\nworking hours between ages 22 and 49; and occupations between ages 22 and 49.\nI defined poverty as family income at 100% of or under the federal poverty\nthreshold. Welfare receipt was defined as receiving any assistance, including\nlow-income cash transfers (e.g., AFDC or TANF), food assistance (e.g., food\nstamps or SNAP), or supplemental security income (SSI). Of note, to avoid\nreverse causality, I did not control for annual wages or income given the high\ncorrelation between these two variables and the type of work; instead,\neducation, experiences with poverty and welfare receipt, and occupations were\nconsidered as proxies for resources available and accessible to respondents.\n\nI created three dichotomous variables to measure average weekly working hours\nwith a value of 1 and 0 otherwise to categorize participants as having (1)\n\u201cmostly or only full-time hours\u201d if they worked 35+ hours a week for at least\nhalf of the survey years (i.e., proportion of 0.50\u20130.99) between 22 and 49\n(the reference group), (2) \u201cmostly or only part-time hours\u201d if they worked\nfewer than 35 hours a week for at least half of the survey years between 22\nand 49, or (3) \u201cmixed\u201d if the participants worked about an equal share of\nsurvey years at full- and part-time hours between 22 and 49. Similarly, data\non occupation were collected at each interview between ages 22 and 49. I\ncreated five occupational categories: mostly professional/managerial, mostly\nsales-related, mostly service-related (the reference group), mostly other\noccupations, and mixed. I used dichotomous variables to classify each\nparticipant\u2019s primary occupation between 22 and 49. A person was considered\nmostly professional/managerial if they worked at least half the survey years\nbetween ages 22 and 49 in such an occupation. The \u201cmixed\u201d occupation category\ncomprised participants who worked about an equal share of the survey years in\nat least two of the five occupation categories between 22 and 49.\n\n#### Data analysis.\n\nStata v.15 was used to perform the analyses in two steps. I first used\nsequence analysis to identify work schedule patterns between ages 22 and 49. I\nthen conducted multiple regression analyses to examine the association between\nwork schedule patterns (found in the sequence analysis) and the following\nhealth outcomes: sleep hours and quality, having poor health, SF-12 physical\nand mental functions, and having depressive symptoms.\n\nWhen using a life-course perspective and focusing on the principles of\nlifespan development and timing, a sequence analysis is a well-suited\nstatistical tool to chronologically classify the transitions between work\nschedule statuses over time [44]. To document the changes or transitions\nchronologically, this analysis used each year between the ages of 22 and 49 as\nthe time axis, and the five work schedule statuses as the state or categorical\nvariable tracked over time. I followed two steps to portray the work schedule\ntrajectories over the working years (i.e., sequences) and then cluster the\ntrajectories into groups. First, I calculated the similarity and dissimilarity\nbetween sequences using an optimal matching algorithm by setting the \u201ccosts\u201d\nof turning one sequence into another [45, 46]. Following the sequence analysis\nliterature, I set the insertion and deletion costs to be 1 and used the\nNeedleman-Wunsch algorithm to calculate the substitution costs based on the\ntransition rates between work schedule categories; when the transition is\nrare, the substitution cost is higher [47, 48]. I conducted additional\nsensitivity analyses using alternative theoretical-driven substitution (such\nas 2, 3, or other theoretically driven cost structures) to ensure the cluster\nsolutions are not sensitive to cost-setting decisions [49]. The results affirm\nthat they are not.\n\nThe next step was to cluster similar sequences into a finite number of groups\nusing Ward\u2019s hierarchical fusion algorithm [45]. The stopping rules based on\nthe Calinski and Harabasz pseudo-F index and the Duda-Hart index, as well as\nthe conceptual meaning of clusters, were used to determine the ideal number of\nclusters [50]. Fig 1 presents the five sequence cluster solutions obtained,\nand S1 Table presents these diagnostic tests.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 1. Distribution plot of five sequence clusters on work arrangements\nbetween ages 22 and 49, NLSY79.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0300245.g001\n\nIn the second step of the analysis, I used ordinary least squares (OLS) models\nto examine the associations between employment patterns and sleep hours and\nquality and SF-12 physical and mental functions, and I used logistic\nregression models to assess the associations between employment patterns and\nthe likelihood of reporting poor health and having depressive symptoms (CES-D\nscore > = 8). I then conducted post-estimations based on each multiple\nregression model to assess whether the regression estimates for the dependent\nvariables were statistically significantly different between the five\nemployment patterns. Next, I conducted interaction analyses to evaluate\nwhether the associations between employment patterns and sleep and health\nmight vary by social position. I conducted separate analyses by interacting\nthe employment patterns with the following social position markers one at a\ntime: race-ethnicity, gender, and education.\n\nDue to the overwhelming number of combinations of employment patterns and the\nthree social position markers, for brevity and for illustrative purposes,\nbased on the interaction analyses, Figs 2\u20137 plot the predicted estimates of\nthe number of sleep hours, sleep quality, poor health, SF-12 physical\nfunction, SF-12 mental function, and depressive symptoms against the work\nschedule patterns and the joint characteristics of race-ethnicity, gender, and\neducation. The predicted probabilities in Figs 2\u20137 were produced by using the\n\u201cmargins\u201d command in Stata based on the multivariate regression analyses. Of\nnote, results for Hispanics were similar to but weaker than those comparing\nnon-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks. Results for \"Other\" respondents\nwere insignificant, primarily due to extremely small sample sizes. Therefore,\nthe comparison between racial-ethnic groups in the Results section focuses on\nthe Black\u2013White differences.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 2.

Table 1 also presents\nthe results of bivariate statistical tests to gauge differences between\nemployment patterns in regard to sociodemographic characteristics. The focal\nindependent variable in this analysis is employment patterns between ages 22\nand 49. Fig 1 presents the distribution plot of the sequence analysis clusters\nof employment patterns between ages 22 and 49. About 60% of the NLSY79\nparticipants had employment patterns involving mostly standard hours (ST)\nthroughout their working years: 35% worked \"mostly ST with some variable hours\n(VH),\" and 26% worked \"stable ST.\" A decent share of participants (17%) had an\nemployment pattern characterized as working standard hours early in their\ncareers (20s) but transitioning into a variety of work schedules (during their\nearly 30s). This group is labeled \"early ST-volatile.\" Another 12% of\nrespondents had a similar employment pattern of working standard hours during\ntheir early working years but switched into mainly variable hours (labeled\n\"early ST-mostly VH\"). Finally, About 11% of respondents had an employment\npattern characterized as \"mostly not working (NW).\"\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics for analyzed variables between ages 22 and 49,\nNLSY79 (N = 7,336).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0300245.t001\n\nTable 1 also shows sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. NLSY79\ncontains slightly more women than men. Approximately half of the participants\nwere non-Hispanic White, with another third identified as non-Hispanic Black,\n19% as Hispanic, and about 1% as some other racial group. The majority were\nU.S.-born. In addition, at age 14, more than 70% of the NLSY79 respondents had\nparents with a high school degree or less, one-third were not living with both\nbiological parents, and almost 80% lived in urban areas. Nearly 10% of these\nyoung adults reported health issues that limited work capacity by age 22. By\nage 23, for about 20% of these young adults, less than high school was their\nhighest educational attainment, 43% had a high school degree, 23% had some\ncollege, and 14% had a college or above education. Roughly 30% of the\nparticipants were married at age 22, and about 29% had become parents by age\n22. Finally, before age 23, about 44% of the participants had experienced\npoverty, and about 21% had received welfare assistance.\n\nFurthermore, between ages 22 and 49, participants experienced an average of\none marriage and had an average of two children. In addition, participants\nspent an average of two to three years experiencing poverty and received\nwelfare assistance for an average of over two years. More than three-fourths\nof the participants mainly worked full-time (i.e., 35 or more hours per week).\nAbout a quarter of the participants mostly worked in professional/managerial\noccupations, more than one-third had primarily service-related occupations,\nand another 30% had jobs primarily in occupations other than\nprofessional/managerial, sales-, or service-related.\n\nRegarding the outcome variables considered in this analysis, the average\nnumber of sleep hours per day on a weekday was 6.62 (SD = 1.41) and 7.21 (SD =\n1.64) on the weekend; combined, across a 7-day week, participants slept an\naverage of 6.92 hours (SD = 1.39). The average sleep quality of the analyzed\nsample was at the mean value. About 20% of the participants reported their\ngeneral health status was either fair or poor. The average SF-12 physical\nfunction was 49.28 (SD = 10.14), slightly below the national average, and the\naverage SF-12 mental function was 52.96 (SD = 8.81), slightly above the\nnational average. These findings are consistent with the NLSY79\u2019s reported\nstatistics [34]. Approximately 17% of the respondents reported having\ndepressive symptoms (CES-D scores > = 8) at age 50.\n\nThe bivariate statistical analyses shown in Table 1 suggest that people with\nemployment patterns of \u201cstable ST\u201d had comparatively advantaged\ncharacteristics in terms of being non-Hispanic White, having a college or\nabove education by age 23, being less likely to have been exposed to poverty\nor welfare assistance by age 22, and having a lower-than-average percentage of\nhealth issues limiting their ability to work. The next groups with somewhat\nadvantaged sociodemographic characteristics were participants with an\nemployment pattern of either \u201cearly ST-mostly VH\u201d or \u201cmostly ST with some VH;\u201d\nthe notable differences between these two groups were the former being more\nlikely to be a man and non-Hispanic White and the latter being more likely to\nbe a female and Hispanic. In contrast, being a man, being non-Hispanic Black,\nand having a high school degree were more likely to be associated with the\n\u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d employment pattern. Of importance, participants with an\nemployment pattern of \u201cmostly NW\u201d tended to have somewhat disadvantaged\nsociodemographic backgrounds. For instance, they were likely to be either non-\nHispanic Black or Hispanic, to have less than a high school education, to have\nhealth issues limiting work, to have become parents by age 22, to have been\nexposed to poverty or welfare by age 22, and to experience more years of\npoverty and welfare assistance after age 22. Given these differences in\nsociodemographic backgrounds for the employment patterns, it is not surprising\nto find that, generally, people with the \u201cstable ST\u201d employment pattern\nbetween ages 22 and 49 had the most favorable sleep and health outcomes, and\nthat people with the \u201cmostly NW\u201d employment pattern had the worst sleep and\nhealth outcomes. Those with the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d employment pattern had the\nsecond-worst sleep and health outcomes.\n\n### Multiple regression estimates of work schedule patterns on sleep and\nhealth\n\nTables 2 and 3 report multiple regression estimates of employment patterns on\nsleep and health outcomes, with Table 2 reporting the hours and quality of\nsleep (OLS regression) along with the likelihood of self-reporting poor health\n(logistic regression) and Table 3 reporting SF-12 physical and mental\nfunctions (OLS regression) along with the likelihood of self-reporting\ndepressive symptoms (logistic regression). All sociodemographic\ncharacteristics detailed in the Measures section were considered in all\nanalyses. On the whole, results in Tables 2 and 3 indicate that employment\npatterns matter to sleep and health. Specifically, compared to the pattern of\nmostly stable standard hours (\u201cstable ST\u201d), having an employment pattern of\nworking standard hours during early career years (age 20s) but transitioning\ninto volatile schedules after age 30 (\u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d) was statistically\nsignificantly associated with fewer hours of sleep per day, lower quality of\nsleep, a higher likelihood of self-reporting poor health at age 50, lower\nscores on SF-12 physical and mental functions, and a higher likelihood of\nhaving depressive symptoms. Compared to the \u201cstable ST\u201d pattern, people with\nan employment pattern of working mostly standard hours but with some variable\nhours (\u201cmostly ST with some VH\u201d) also had significantly worse sleep and health\noutcomes, except for a nonsignificant effect on SF-12 mental function. People\nwith an employment pattern of having standard hours during their 20s but\ntransitioning into mostly variable hours after age 30 (\u201cearly ST-mostly VH\u201d)\nhad significantly fewer hours of sleep per day and significantly lower SF-12\nphysical function scores than those with the \u201cstable ST\u201d pattern. Lastly,\npeople with an employment pattern of mostly not working (\u201cmostly NW\u201d) reported\na significantly higher likelihood of poor health and significantly lower SF-12\nphysical function than those with the \u201cstable ST\u201d pattern. In addition, post-\nestimation Wald test results (not shown, available upon request) indicate that\nindividuals with the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d employment pattern (1) slept\nsignificantly fewer hours (b = -0.24 vs. b = -0.10, \u03c7^2 = 7.42, p < .01),\nreported significantly lower SF-12 physical function (b = -1.42 vs. b = -0.62,\n\u03c7^2 = 5.53, p < .05), and were more likely to report poor health (b = 0.45 vs.\nb = 0.18, \u03c7^2 = 9.08, p < .01) than those with the \u201cmostly ST with some VH\u201d\npattern and (2) were more likely to report poor health than those with the\n\u201cearly ST-mostly VH\u201d pattern (b = 0.45 vs. b = 0.08, \u03c7^2 = 9.39, p < .01).\nFurthermore, individuals with the employment pattern of \u201cearly ST-mostly VH\u201d\nhad significantly fewer hours of sleep per day during the week compared to\nthose with the \u201cmostly ST with some VH\u201d pattern (b = -0.23 vs. b = -0.10, \u03c7^2\n= 6.28, p < .01). The post-estimation Wald tests detected no other\nstatistically significant differences among employment patterns.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 2.

However, gender and race-ethnicity did not\nmake a difference in the likelihood of self-reporting poor health.\nSpecifically, people occupying vulnerable social positions (e.g., women, less\nthan a high school education, previously married, having health limitations,\nmultiple marriages, more experiences of poverty and welfare, not having full-\ntime work status) tended to report lower sleep quality and lower SF-12\nphysical and mental functions, and were more likely to self-report poor health\nand having depressive symptoms. Note that, compared to men, women reported\nsignificantly more hours of sleep but substantially lower sleep quality.\nMoreover, compared to non-Hispanic White peers, non-Hispanic Black respondents\nreported considerably fewer hours of sleep yet better sleep quality.\n\nFor ease of interpretation, Table 4 presents the predicted estimates of how\nsleep and health outcomes might vary by employment patterns based on the\nresults reported in Tables 2 and 3. Across all outcomes, among those employed,\nindividuals engaged in the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d pattern between 22 and 49 had\nfewer (if not the fewest) hours of sleep (6.80 hrs/day), the lowest quality of\nsleep (-0.02), the highest likelihood of self-reporting poor health (0.23),\nthe lowest SF-12 physical and mental functions scores (48.62 and 52.45), and\nthe highest likelihood of having depressive symptoms (0.19). In contrast,\nindividuals engaged in the \u201cstable ST\u201d pattern had the best outcomes, followed\nby those with the pattern of \u201cmostly ST with some VH.\u201d\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 4. Predicted estimates of health outcomes by work schedule pattern\nbetween ages 22 and 48/49.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0300245.t004\n\n### Variations in links between employment patterns and outcomes by social\nposition\n\nPrior research suggests that social position influences employment patterns,\nwith vital implications for our health [3, 5, 6, 17, 18]. Figs 2\u20137 display the\npredicted estimates of the six outcomes by intersecting employment patterns,\ngender, race, and education. S2\u2013S7 Tables present the predicted estimates in\ndetail. Several findings are worth highlighting. First, education serves an\nimportant cushion for better sleep (hours and quality) and health outcomes\nregardless of employment pattern, race, or gender. Second, the significantly\npoorer sleep and health outcomes observed in Tables 2 and 3 were concentrated\namong people with vulnerable positions, such as females, racial minorities\n(with some exceptions detailed below), and those with less than a college\ndegree. For example, Black males with the \u201cearly ST-mostly VH\u201d employment\npattern slept the least regardless of education; their average sleep hours\nwere 6.39, 6.44, 6.44, and 6.50, respectively, for less than a high school\ndegree, high school, some college, and college and above. On the other\nspectrum are White females, who tended to have the most sleep hours,\nparticularly if they had the employment pattern of stable standard hours\n(7.14, 7.19, 7.19, and 7.25 for the educational groups of less than a high\nschool degree to college or above) (Fig 2 and S2 Table).\n\nIn contrast with the sleep hours results, Black males reported the best and\nWhite females the worst sleep quality. These findings are particularly true\nfor those with either the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d or the \u201cmostly ST with some VH\u201d\nemployment pattern regardless of educational attainment (Fig 3 and S3 Table).\n\nThe health outcomes also varied by employment pattern and social position. In\ngeneral, \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d reported the poorest health outcomes across all\neducational groups and all racial/ethnic and gender pairings. Specifically,\nacross all education categories, Black females who had the \"early ST-volatile\"\nemployment pattern reported the highest likelihood of having poor health among\nall groups examined. Despite White males in the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d group also\nreporting a high likelihood of having poor health, the difference in the\nlikelihood of reporting poor health between Black females (.34) and White\nmales (.27) with this employment pattern is about .07 among those with less\nthan a high school education (Fig 4 and S4 Table). In addition, Black females\nwith the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d employment pattern had the lowest SF-12 physical\nfunction score, whereas males, regardless of race, reported the highest SF-12\nphysical function (Fig 5 and S5 Table). In regard to SF-12 mental function,\nBlack males and females generally reported better scores than White males and\nfemales. In addition, White females with the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d employment\npattern reported the lowest SF-12 mental function; this is particularly true\nif they had a less than high school education (Fig 6 and S6 Table).\n\nSimilar to the SF-12 mental health results, Black males and females generally\nreported a lower likelihood of having depressive symptoms than their White\ncounterparts. In addition, White females with the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d\nemployment pattern reported the highest likelihood of having depressive\nsymptoms, particularly among those with less than a high school education (Fig\n7 and S7 Table). The difference in the likelihood of having depressive\nsymptoms between this group and White males in the highest education group\nwith the \u201cstable ST\u201d employment patterns is striking: .32 versus .07.\n\n## Discussion and conclusion\n\nSince the 1980s, our employment has been shaped by global technological and\ndigital advances, together with the rise and dominance of the service economy.\nThese changes have produced undesirable health consequences, including\ndisrupting our sleep routines, an aspect of our daily life critical to\nnurturing our health. Decades of research has established that sleep, both\nduration and quality, matters to our health [5]. This paper contributes two\ncrucial insights to advance our knowledge of how work may have become a\nvulnerability for our sleep and health. Specifically, nonstandard work\nschedules, a central indicator of precarious employment, have become a\nwidespread job characteristic in the increasingly unequal and globalized labor\nmarket [3, 15]. Moreover, the strains and harm caused by the recent\ndevastating public health crisis (the COVID-19 pandemic) were\ndisproportionately carried by those without resources and those with\nprecarious jobs [51], particularly in the United States [6]. This study thus\nexamines the extent to which having a nonstandard work schedule throughout\none\u2019s working life in the United States might make a difference in both sleep\nhours and quality and health outcomes. I paid particular attention to the\nrelationship between employment patterns, sleep, and health outcomes among the\ngroups most likely to be subject to working nonstandard hours. Below I\nhighlight a few significant findings.\n\nUsing a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of U.S. individuals\ninterviewed since 1979, this study finds that employment patterns over our\nworking lives matter to our sleep and health, consistent with prior research\n[1, 5, 12, 52]. Importantly, this study approaches this issue from a life-\ncourse perspective, examining how employment patterns over our working lives\nmight be linked to our sleep and health by shaping our daily routines. My\nempirical results suggest that individuals engaged in volatile work schedule\npatterns\u2014a combination of evening, night, and variable hours\u2014could anticipate\nsleeping significantly fewer hours per day, getting lower sleep quality,\nperceiving lower SF-12 physical and mental functions, and reporting a higher\nlikelihood of poor health and depressive symptoms at age 50 than people\nworking regular daytime hours. In fact, any employment pattern involving\nnonstandard hours (such as evening, night, or variable hours) for most of\none\u2019s working years may be associated with adverse sleep and health outcomes.\nThese results suggest that a job requiring constant changes between daytime,\nevenings, nights, and irregular hours could significantly interfere with daily\nroutines, affecting when a person sleeps, eats, and socializes with family\nmembers and friends. Furthermore, night shifts require a waking state during\nnight hours when our bodies need rest, disrupting our circadian rhythm and\nthus sleep routines, including sleep quality. The lack of (good quality)\nsleep, physical fatigue, and emotional exhaustion stemming from a volatile\nemployment pattern exemplifies how our work has made us vulnerable to an\nunhealthy life. Indeed, in regard to the SF-12 physical and mental function\nscores and the likelihood of having depressive symptoms, the effect sizes\nassociated with the \u201cearly ST-volatile\u201d employment pattern were similar to, if\nnot larger than, having less than a high school education (see Table 3). This\nadverse health consequence of nonstandard work schedule patterns is alarming\ngiven that the extant research has shown that getting an inadequate amount of\nsleep and having poor sleep quality can have myriad short- and long-term\nhealth consequences, ranging from somatic issues and increased stress\nresponsivity, which can lead to increased anxiety and depression [53], to a\nhigh prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and stroke [5].\n\nThe picture becomes grimmer if we further disentangle these links by social\nposition. For example, as shown in Table 1, Blacks were more likely than their\nWhite peers to have an employment pattern of starting with standard hours but\nsoon transitioning into volatile schedules for most of their working years.\nImportantly, the intersectionality between employment patterns and social\nposition only underscores the substantial health disparities between those\nwith resources and those without: those without disproportionately shoulder\nthe adverse consequences of employment patterns characterized by volatility,\nconfirming that advantages and disadvantages produced by our work can\naccumulate throughout a lifetime, with powerful implications for our health\nand well-being. The empirical evidence reported here shows that White females\nwith a college or above education who had an employment pattern of stable\nstandard-hour schedules (\u201cstable-ST\u201d) got on average six more hours of sleep a\nweek ((7.25\u20136.39) x 7) than Black males with less than a high school degree\nwho worked variable hours for most of their working years (\u201cearly ST-mostly\nVH\u201d). Even within the group with less than a high school education, White\nfemales with the \u201cstable-ST\u201d employment pattern got on average five more hours\nof sleep a week ((7.14\u20136.39) x 7) than Black males with the \u201cearly ST-mostly\nVH\u201d employment pattern. Similarly, the likelihood of reporting poor health was\n.09 among White males with a college or above education and an employment\npattern of stable standard hours versus .34 (the highest likelihood) among\nBlack females with a less than high school education and the \u201cearly ST-\nvolatile\u201d employment pattern. The former also reported significantly better\nSF-12 physical function than the latter, with an effect size of five-tenths of\none standard deviation (51.61\u201346.44 = 5.17) (see S5 Table).\n\nHowever, the opposite is true regarding gender differences in sleep quality\nand mental health. Specifically, females generally reported more hours of\nsleep but also poorer sleep quality than their male counterparts, which is\nconsistent with the established scholarship in this area [54, 55]. Studies\nhave examined whether gender differences in sleep quality might be related to\nbiological (e.g., genetics) and sociological (e.g., family responsibilities,\nwork) factors [54]. The extant research suggests that family responsibilities\nand work characteristics are the most important factors explaining why women\nexperience sleep disorders more than men [54]. Specifically, among those who\nwork nonstandard schedules, women are more likely to have sleep disorders than\nmen [54]. In line with the literature, my analyses show that (see S3 Table)\nWhite and Black females with less than a high school degree who had volatile\nemployment patterns between ages 22 and 49 reported a sleep quality of -.29\nand -.12, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding estimates were -.10 and\n.05 for White and Black males with that same educational level and employment\npattern. As the sleep quality variable is a standardized score with a mean of\n0 and a standard deviation of 1, the differences between White women and Black\nmen amount to a one-third of a standard deviation (e.g., -.29 \u2013(.05) / 1 =\n.34) among those with less than a high school degree and the employment\npattern of \u201cearly ST-volatile.\u201d Further, when comparing White and Black males\nwith a college degree and the \u201cstable ST\u201d employment pattern, the\ncorresponding estimates were .18 and .25. The difference between White females\nwith a less than a high school degree and an employment pattern of \u201cearly ST-\nvolatile\u201d and Black males with a college or above education and a \u201cstable ST\u201d\nemployment pattern is even larger, amounting to slightly over half of a\nstandard deviation (e.g., -.29 \u2013(.25) / 1 = .54). These differences are\nconsidered medium to large effect sizes [55, 56].\n\nIn regard to mental health, extant studies have shown that males are less\nlikely to report mental health symptoms than females, a finding echoed in my\nanalysis. Prior research indicates that although males and females were\nequally likely to experience emotional stress, males were less likely than\nfemales to express stress in ways that are measured through items in the SF-12\nor CES-D instruments [57]. In addition, studies have found that females are\nmore likely than males to report mild-moderate depression, but males report\nsevere depression and suicidal thoughts more often than females [58]. Because\nthe measures used in this study assess mild to moderate depressive symptoms,\nmy findings that females reported poorer mental functions and a higher\nlikelihood of having at-risk depressive symptoms than males are in line with\nprevious empirical evidence. Furthermore, prior research has indicated that\ngender differences in symptom phenotypes (e.g., atypical symptoms in male\ndepression) or in coping style (e.g., males tend not to seek help) are\nmechanisms that might explain why studies tend to observe a higher incidence\nof depression among females than males [58].\n\nIn contrast, and importantly, the racial differences in sleep hours and\nquality, and in health outcomes found in my analyses are nuanced and far from\nstraightforward. Although Black males and, to a lesser extent, Black females\ntended to report similar physical and mental health as their White\ncounterparts, the contrasts are striking when looking at sleep-related\nresults. Specifically, Black males reported the fewest hours of sleep yet the\nbest sleep quality, whereas White females tended to report more sleep hours\nbut much poorer sleep quality. Although the extant research suggests that\nBlacks tend to sleep fewer hours (e.g., < 7 hrs) and have poorer sleep quality\nthan their White counterparts, the Black\u2013White disparities in sleep quality\npreviously documented are somewhat mixed [59]. For example, studies that use\nobjective measurements to assess sleep quality tend to confirm the Black\u2013White\ndisparities in sleep quality [59]. However, the results are less definitive\nwhen a subjective measure such as self-reports are used [59], which is how\nsleep quality was collected in the NLSY79. Prior studies have also shown that\nthe Black\u2013White disparities in sleep quality might have to do with\nsocioeconomic status or environmental factors (e.g., neighborhood quality)\n[59\u201361]. In other words, the Black\u2013White disparities in sleep quality might\ndisappear once we consider these factors. Indeed, the raw data of this\nanalysis indicated that Blacks in the NLSY79 sample reported the lowest sleep\nquality among all respondents, but this disparity disappeared in the multiple\nregression analysis when a rich set of sociodemographic characteristics were\nconsidered, including their work schedule trajectories.\n\nAlthough beyond the scope of this paper, the scholarship on the \u201cblack\u2013white\nhealth paradox\u201d might also corroborate my findings that the Black respondents\ntended to report better sleep quality and similar if not better physical and\nmental functions despite shorter sleep duration [62]. Social stress theory,\nand related approaches, would predict that racial minority groups in the\nUnited States like Black Americans should be more likely than their White\npeers to develop poor physical and mental health due to discrimination-related\nexperiences, in line with the core assumption of CAD [63]. However, prior\nstudies using self-reported data (the same method as used with the NLSY79)\nhave documented that Blacks display similar physical health and better mental\nhealth than their White counterparts [64, 65]. Researchers have posited that\nexperiencing discrimination, hardship, and stresses may increase resilience in\nthe face of challenges [63, 65]. If so, nonstandard work schedules, considered\na disadvantage, might not directly translate into poor health for Blacks.\nHowever, caution is warranted when making any sweeping generalizations based\non my results. After all, the predicted estimates shown in S3 Table suggest\nthat Black males and females with less than a high school degree and a\nvolatile employment pattern for most of their working lives had a high, if not\nthe highest, likelihood of reporting poor health (.29 and .34, respectively)\namong all respondents. This association between perceived poor health and the\njoint forces of work and social position warrants attention in future research\nand policy advocacy endeavors.\n\n### Limitations\n\nAs with all observational studies, the current study has several limitations.\nFirst, the NLSY79 provided work schedule information annually until 1994 and\nbiennially thereafter. For some, work schedules may have changed from month to\nmonth, let alone during the two-year windows, limiting my ability to depict\nmore precise employment patterns over time. Thus, the present results may\nunderestimate the true association between employment patterns and outcomes.\nHowever, the longitudinal approach has the advantage of reducing measurement\nnoise. Specifically, longitudinal data allow more accuracy than cross-\nsectional data in recognizing, for example, individuals who have repeatedly\nreported nonstandard work schedules over the years versus those who might have\nonly worked such a schedule a few times over 30 years.\n\nSecond, our daily routines and health are closely related to the type and\namount of resources we can access; income and wages are the primary means of\nsecuring such resources. Ideally, the true association between employment\npatterns and sleep and health would be obtained after considering income and\nwages. However, the high correlation between employment and income and wages\ncreates concerns about reverse causality. After all, our type of work\ndetermines how much income we can bring home. To address this potential\nreverse-causality issue, I controlled for the following variables likely to\nshape the type of work one may access at the start of their career and thus\nthe wages and income they might bring home: the educational levels of the\nrespondents and their parents and whether they had ever experienced poverty\nand/or received welfare before age 22. Nonetheless, our knowledge will benefit\nfrom a closer examination of how wages and income might play a critical role\nin the association between employment patterns and our sleep and health. For\nexample, although it is beyond the scope of this analysis, future research\nmight pursue this research question by utilizing a structural equation model\nto establish a proper temporal order between employment patterns (e.g.,\nbetween ages 22 and 40), wages and income (e.g., between ages 41 and 49), and\nhealth outcomes (e.g., at age 50) to avoid reverse-causality issues. In this\nstudy, I did not adopt a structural equation modeling as specified above\nbecause my primary aim was to build upon a life-course lens to document the\nrespondents\u2019 work schedule trajectories using as many working years as\npossible (i.e., between ages 22 and 49 vs. between ages 22 and 39). Similarly,\ndue to the data at hand, this analysis could not consider the number of hours\nrespondents spent on household chores, which plays an important role not only\nin how many hours we can sleep but also in our physical and mental health. For\nexample, women generally spend more time doing household work than men do\ndespite potentially having the same number of working hours. These differences\nin household chores influence the number of hours a woman versus a man has for\nsleep and can impact their physical and emotional energy levels.\n\nThird, individuals may switch from evening/night hours to standard daytime\nhours due to worsening health stemming from working nonstandard hours. If so,\nthe estimates of the links between employment patterns and the sleep and\nhealth outcomes might be underestimated in this analysis. The sequence\nanalysis adopted in this paper does not sufficiently answer such research\nquestions. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper, future research\nmight use other appropriate statistical analyses (e.g., latent transition\nanalysis) to examine this crucial dynamic nature between employment patterns\nand sleep and health over time. Similarly, fixed-effect models might help\nanswer research questions about how changes in employment patterns may shape\nchanges in sleep and health over time. Such analyses would require at least\nthree data points of health outcomes. This analysis relies on the 2018 NLSY79\ndata release, at which point only two such data points were available for the\nmajority of its sample, as only about 10% of the respondents had reached age\n60 to have three data points of health outcomes. In addition, the NLSY79\ncollected the sleep information analyzed here only in the health module at\nages 50 and 60, thus limiting the ability to conduct the more sophisticated\nstatistical analyses needed to answer more dynamic research questions.\n\nFourth, despite the sequence analysis accurately documenting the sequential\nchanges in work trajectories, the analyses presented here at best represent\nassociations instead of causation. While an experimental design study might\nallow one to detect a causal relationship between employment and sleep and\nhealth, randomly assigning individuals to different employment and various\nwork schedule patterns would be neither feasible nor ethical. Hence, relying\non quality longitudinal data with proper and sophisticated statistical\nanalysis (e.g., fixed-effect modeling, instrumental variable) would allow us\none step closer to causation.\n\nFifth, most of the NLSY79 health variables are self-reported, which likely\ninfluenced the outcomes identified here. Knowing how individuals perceive\ntheir sleep quality and health outcomes is critical as subjective perceptions\nsignificantly affect our well-being. However, the extant research using\nobjective measurement tools consistently confirms a Black\u2013White disparity in\nsleep quality and health outcomes, highlighting the importance of\ntriangulating information to increase confidence in the findings.\n\nSixth, sample attrition is unavoidable with longitudinal data and could have\naffected some results. The positive selection bias associated with sample\nattrition might also bias the true association between employment patterns and\nsleep and health outcomes.\n\nSeventh, although I used a separate racial-ethnic group named \u201cother\u201d that\nincluded Asian and other ethnicities, the estimates suffer from extremely\nsmall sample sizes, prohibiting me from drawing definitive interpretations\nabout this group. This limitation warrants attention in future efforts to\ncollect nationally representative data. Despite these limitations, the NLSY79\nis the only dataset containing work schedule information for a nationally\nrepresentative sample in the U.S. over three decades during a period when\nnonstandard work schedules were increasingly becoming prevalent throughout the\ncountry.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis study uses a life-course lens to shed much-needed light on how our\nemployment patterns might shape our sleep and health as we approach middle\nadulthood. Employment is a crucial factor in the process of producing and\naccumulating resources and risks throughout our lives. Of importance,\nprecarious employment has become increasingly typical in the globalized and\npolarized labor market, and nonstandard work schedules are a critical feature\nof precarious jobs. Examining employment patterns and work schedules through a\nlongitudinal lens thus provides a deeper appreciation of how the impact of\nnonstandard work schedules might manifest through advantages and disadvantages\naccumulated throughout one\u2019s working life. This approach also underscores that\nthe health burden might be disproportionately shouldered by workers in\nvulnerable social positions (e.g., females, low education, Blacks). This\nstudy\u2019s findings highlight the dual challenges facing workers in vulnerable\nsocial positions who have jobs requiring nonstandard work schedules, both of\nwhich limit their access to resources that would allow them to achieve decent\nsleep health and physical and mental health outcomes. This analysis thus calls\nattention to the reality of how employment as a social system may generate and\nperpetuate vulnerabilities and inequalities for particular groups over the\nlife course.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nGoodness-of-fit statistics for work arrangements sequence cluster solutions.\n\nShowing 1/7: pone.0300245.s001.docx\n\n### S1 Table.
