(Four of the 25 chapters were written with Ann\nDruyan).^[1]^: x In it, Sagan aims to explain the scientific method to\nlaypeople and to encourage people to learn critical and skeptical thinking. He\nexplains methods to help distinguish between ideas that are considered valid\nscience and those that can be considered pseudoscience. Sagan states that when\nnew ideas are offered for consideration, they should be tested by means of\nskeptical thinking and should stand up to rigorous questioning.\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\nSagan explains that science is not just a body of knowledge, but is a way of\nthinking. Sagan shows how scientific thinking is both imaginative and\ndisciplined, bringing humans to an understanding of how the universe is,\nrather than how they wish to perceive it. He says that science works much\nbetter than any other system because it has a \"built-in error-correcting\nmachine\".^[2]^: 27 Superstition and pseudoscience get in the way of the\nability of many laypersons to appreciate the beauty and benefits of science.\nSkeptical thinking allows people to construct, understand, reason, and\nrecognize valid and invalid arguments. Wherever possible, there must be\nindependent validation of the concepts whose truth should be proved. He states\nthat reason and logic would succeed once the truth were known. Conclusions\nemerge from premises, and the acceptability of the premises should not be\ndiscounted or accepted because of bias.\n\n### Dragon in my garage[edit]\n\nSee also: Falsifiability\n\nAs an example of skeptical thinking, Sagan offers a story concerning a fire-\nbreathing dragon who lives in his garage. When he persuades a rational, open-\nminded visitor to meet the dragon, the visitor remarks that they are unable to\nsee the creature. Sagan replies that he \"neglected to mention that she's an\ninvisible dragon\". The visitor suggests spreading flour on the floor so that\nthe creature's footprints might be seen, which Sagan says is a good idea, \"but\nthis dragon floats in the air\". When the visitor considers using an infrared\ncamera to view the creature's invisible fire, Sagan explains that her fire is\nheatless. He continues to counter every proposed physical test with a reason\nwhy the test will not work.\n\nSagan concludes by asking: \"Now what's the difference between an invisible,\nincorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If\nthere's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would\ncount against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your\ninability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving\nit true.\"\n\nContinuing with concepts relevant to the 'dragon in my garage' story, Sagan\nwrites about a patient of John Mack who claimed to have scars on her body\nwhich were from encounters with aliens. Sagan writes that if the patient is\nasked what her scars look like, she is unable to show them because,\nunfortunately, they are located in the private areas of her body.\n\n### Baloney detection kit[edit]\n\nSagan presents a set of tools for skeptical thinking that he calls the\n\"baloney detection kit\".^[3]^[4]^: 210 ^[5] Skeptical thinking consists both\nof constructing a reasoned argument and recognizing a fallacious or fraudulent\none. In order to identify a fallacious argument, Sagan suggests employing such\ntools as independent confirmation of facts, debate, development of different\nhypotheses, quantification, the use of Occam's razor, and the possibility of\nfalsification. Sagan's \"baloney detection kit\" also provides tools for\ndetecting \"the most common fallacies of logic and rhetoric\", such as argument\nfrom authority and statistics of small numbers. Through these tools, Sagan\nargues the benefits of a critical mind and the self-correcting nature of\nscience can take place.\n\nSagan provides nine tools as the first part of this kit.\n\n  1. There must be independent confirmation of the facts given when possible.\n  2. Encourage debate on the evidence from all points of view.\n  3. Realize that an argument from authority is not always reliable. Sagan supports this by telling us that 'authorities\" have made mistakes in the past and they will again in the future.\n  4. Consider more than one hypothesis. Sagan adds to this by telling us that we must think of the argument from all angles and think all the ways it can be explained or disproved. The hypothesis that then still hasn't been disproved has a much higher chance of being correct.\n  5. Try your best to not purely stick to a hypothesis that is your own and become biased. Sagan tells us to compare our own hypothesis with others to see if we can find reasons to reject our own hypothesis.\n  6. Quantify. Sagan tells us that if whatever we are trying to explain has numerical value or quantitative data related to it, then we'll be much more able to compete against other hypotheses.\n  7. If there is a chain of argument, every link in that chain must be correct.\n  8. The use of Occam's razor, which tells us to choose the hypothesis that is simpler and requires the least amount of assumptions.\n  9. Ask if a given hypothesis can be falsified. Sagan tells us that if a hypothesis cannot be tested or falsified then it is not worth considering.\n\nSagan suggests that with the use of this \"baloney detection kit\" it is easier\nto critically think and find the truth.\n\n#### Logical fallacies[edit]\n\nThere is a second part to the kit. This consists of twenty logical fallacies\nthat one must not commit when offering up a new claim.\n\n  1. Ad hominem. An arguer attacks the opposing arguer and not the actual argument.\n  2. Argument from authority. Someone expects another to immediately believe that a person of authority or higher knowledge is correct.\n  3. Argument from adverse consequences. Someone says that something must be done a certain way or else there will be adverse consequences.\n  4. Appeal to ignorance. One argues a claim in that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa.\n  5. Special pleading. An arguer responds to a deeply complex or rhetorical question or statement by, usually, saying \"oh you don't understand how so and so works.\"\n  6. Begging the question. An arguer assumes the answer and makes a claim such as, this happened because of that, or, this needs to happen in order for that to happen.\n  7. Observational selection. Someone talks about how great something is by explaining all of the positive aspects of it while purposely not mentioning any of the negative aspects.\n  8. Statistics of small numbers. Someone argues something by giving the statistics in small numbers, which isn't very reliable.\n  9. Misunderstanding of the nature of statistics. Someone misinterprets statistics given to them.\n  10. Fallacy of inconsistency. An arguer is very inconsistent in their claims.\n  11. Non sequitur. This is Latin for \"it doesn't follow.\" A claim is made that doesn't make much sense, such as \"Our nation will prevail because God is great.\"\n  12. Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Latin for \"it happened after, so it was caused by.\" An arguer claims that something happened because of a past event when really it probably didn't.\n  13. Meaningless question. Someone asks a question that has no real meaning or doesn't add to the argument at all.\n  14. The excluded middle. An arguer only considers or mentions the two opposite extremes of the conversation and excludes the aspects in between the two extremes.\n  15. Short-term vs. long-term. A subset of the excluded middle, but so important it was pulled it out for special attention.\n  16. Slippery slope, related to excluded middle (e.g., If we allow abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy, it will be impossible to prevent the killing of a full-term infant. Or, conversely: If the state prohibits...)\n  17. Confusion of correlation and causation. The latter causes the former\n  18. Straw man. Caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack. This is also a short-term/long-term fallacy\n  19. Suppressed evidence, or half-truth.\n  20. Weasel word. Talleyrand said: \"An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public.\"\n\nSagan provides a skeptical analysis of several examples of what he refers to\nas superstition, fraud, and pseudoscience such as witches, UFOs, ESP, and\nfaith healing. He is critical of organized religion.^[citation needed]\n\nIn a 2020 interview for Skeptical Inquirer, when Sagan's wife Ann Druyan was\nasked about the origin of the phrase \"baloney detection kit\", she said that\n\n> It didn't really come from Carl. It actually came from a friend of mine\n> named Arthur Felberbaum who died about forty years ago. He and Carl and I\n> once sat down for dinner together. His politics were very left wing, so Carl\n> and Arthur and I were trying to find common ground so that we could have a\n> really good dinner together. And at one point, Arthur said, \"Carl, it's just\n> that I dream that every one of us would have a baloney detection kit in our\n> head.\" And that's where that idea came from.^[3]\n\n### Misuse of science[edit]\n\nSagan indicates that science can be misused. Thus, he is highly critical of\nEdward Teller, the \"father of the hydrogen bomb\", and Teller's influence on\npolitics, and contrasts his stance to that of Linus Pauling and other\nscientists who took moral positions.^[citation needed]\n\nSagan also discusses the misuse of science in representation. He relates to\nthe depiction of the mad scientist character in children's TV shows and is\ncritical of this occurrence. Sagan suggests an addition of scientific\ntelevision programs, many of which would take a look at believed hoaxes of the\npast and encourage viewers to engage in critical thinking to better represent\nscience on popular Television.\n\n#### Misuse of psychiatric authority[edit]\n\nSagan indicates that therapists can contribute to the growth of pseudoscience\nor the infusion of \"false stories\". He is critical of John Mack and his\nsupport of abduction cases, which were represented in his patients.\n\nSagan writes about the story of Paul Ingram. Ingram's daughter reported that\nher father had sexually abused her. He was told that \"sex offenders often\nrepressed memories of their crimes.\"^[6] Ingram was eventually able to have a\nfoggy visualization of the claimed events, and he suggested that perhaps \"a\ndemon might be responsible.\"^[6] Sagan describes how once Ingram started\nremembering events, so did several other individuals and family members. A\n\"memory recovery\" technique was performed on Ingram, and he confessed to the\ncrimes. A medical examination was done on his daughter, where none of the\nscars she described were actually found. Sagan writes that Ingram later tried\nto plead innocence once \"away from his daughters, his police colleagues, and\nhis pastor.\"^[6]\n\n#### Hoaxes[edit]\n\nHoaxes have played a valuable role in the history of science by revealing the\nflaws in our thinking and helping us advance our critical thinking skills. One\nof Sagan\u2019s examples is the \"Carlos hoax\" by James Randi that revealed flaws in\nreporting by news media. Carlos was described as an ancient spirit that\nsupposedly possessed Jos\u00e9 Alvarez and provided Alvarez with advanced knowledge\nabout the universe. Many news outlets assumed this was true and reported it as\nsuch, which spread misinformation.\n\nSagan also cites crop circles as hoaxes.\n\n## Reception and legacy[edit]\n\nThe book was a New York Times bestseller.^[7] The contemporary skeptical\nmovement considers it an important book.^[8]^[9]^[10]^[11] The Demon-Haunted\nWorld has been criticized (in Smithsonian magazine and The New York Times) for\nnot incorporating certain information relevant to the items he discusses in\nhis book. The Smithsonian article by Paul Trachtman argues that Sagan relates\nissues of government choices and declining scientific thinking skills to\npseudoscience topics like astrology and faith healing but ignores other issues\nthat may be causing governmental bodies and other individuals to turn away\nfrom science. One such issue is consequences of pouring governmental money\ninto cancer research. Trachtman writes, \"it is not because of such beliefs\nthat Congress now approaches the NIH budget with an ax. In fact, billions of\ndollars spent on years of research in the war on cancer have spawned growing\nprofessional bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits.\"^[12] Trachtman\nargues that Sagan does not include problems like growing bureaucracies and\ndiminishing medical benefits as reasons for a lack of scientific attention. In\nhis review for the New York Times, James Gorman also argues for an unaddressed\nissue in Sagan's book, saying Sagan fails to emphasize the idea that\nscientists should take a more active role in reaching science to the public,\nwhile he does mention the failures of the education system to do so.^[13]\n\nThe review in the Smithsonian magazine and a review in the New York Review of\nBooks provide a range of opinions on Sagan's attitude towards religious ideas.\nPer the New York Review article, \"when it comes to the Supreme\nExtraterrestrial he is rather circumspect.\"^[14] The Smithsonian article\nsuggests Sagan was very clear about his religious beliefs in the book, for he\n\"splits his universe in two, into science and irrationality.\" The Smithsonian\ngoes on to say that Sagan's defined religious views fall within the area of an\nuntestable claim, a type of claim he argues against in The Demon-Haunted\nWorld.^[12]\n\nThe article in the New York Review also claims that Sagan includes something\nin The Demon-Haunted World which he also is arguing against in that same text.\nThe article mentions how Sagan discusses a natural predisposition people have\ntowards science; but, the article says, \"He does not tell us how he used the\nscientific method to discover the \"embedded\" human proclivity for\nscience.\"^[14] Sagan heavily discusses the importance of using the scientific\nmethod in his book, and this article claims he strays away from his own\nmessage by not including a description of his use of the scientific method on\nthis topic.\n\nAn article in the Los Angeles Times describe Sagan's book positively. The Los\nAngeles Times describes Sagan's book as \"a manifesto for clear thought\", with\nthe main issue being the length of eight chapters.^[15] This lengthy\ndiscussion is also addressed in the archived New York Times article,^[16]\nwhich relates to the book as having areas which repeat themselves.\n\nThe Demon-Haunted World has been defined in more current sources as still\nrelevant. An article in The Guardian, 2012, suggests the still current\nrelevance of The Demon-Haunted World.^[17] Another article from The Verge in\n2017 also supports this relevance.^[18] The latter article mentions a\ndisconnect between what is proven by science to be the best answer and what is\nchosen to be done by governmental bodies.^[19] Carl Sagan covers this concept\nas a prominent issue in his book (1995), and this article outlines it as a\nproblem still occurring in 2017.\n\n### Relevance[edit]\n\nThe Demon-Haunted World provides many arguments about our society that will\nalways remain relevant. Sagan mainly argues for increased education among\nyounger populations regarding critical thinking and scientific literacy.\nFirst, he explains that scientific literacy and critical thinking are\nessential for democracy, especially in the United States. Democracy allows\npeople to share their beliefs, but with this come many different perspectives\nand arguments. Critical thinking is required to determine which are true or\nfalse. Scientific literacy provides similar tools and benefits to critical\nthinking; Sagan asserts science allows us to participate in the most\nsignificant method of understanding our Universe. Science is constantly\nevolving and is intertwined with our democracy, so to fully participate in\ndemocracy, you must be able to understand science. Sagan explains that science\ncan be used to escape poverty, aid us in determining how to preserve our\nworld, and to understand our origin and place in the Universe, \u201cWithout\nscience and democracy, we risk being a nation of suckers.\u201d^[20] Science can\nalso be a valuable tool in examining a community\u2019s social, political, and\neconomic systems to reveal flaws and provide methods of improvement. Sagan\nasserts all individuals should have the ability to recognize errors.\n\nSagan insists that \"there are no stupid questions\" because asking questions is\nhow we advance scientific knowledge. Denying that any questions are stupid\nalso encourages children to develop critical thinking skills. Some examples\nSagan provides include \u201cWhy is the grass green?\u201d and \u201cWhy do we have\ntoes?\u201d^[21] Both of these help answer questions about biology, evolution, and\nthe human body. Discouraging anyone from asking these questions and instead\njust accepting that these are facts of life may contribute to flaws in\nthinking patterns in the future. Being used to accepting the way things are\njust because is exactly what Sagan is attempting to fix, encouraging everyone\nto remain skeptical and question everything. He also places emphasis on using\nthe \u201cBaloney Detection Kit\u201d to spot flaws (see above).\n\nIn the decade or so prior to the publication of The Demon-Haunted World, alien\nabduction accounts were common. Sagan provides concrete examples for why we\nshouldn\u2019t assume things are true and instead use tools such as Occam's razor\nto seek more reasonable, science-based explanations.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Science portal\n  * Philosophy portal\n  * Books portal\n\n  * Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds \u2013 1841 book by Charles Mackay\n  * Junk science \u2013 Scientific data considered to be spurious or fraudulent\n  * Pathological science \u2013 Research into why people are tricked into false results\n  * Rationalism \u2013 Epistemological view centered on reason\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Sagan, Carl (1997).
