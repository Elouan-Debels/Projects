DEADLINE to ENTER is 04/26/24 @\n11:59pm (PST) Developed by Microsoft it\u2019s Based around their HoloLens 2 smart\nglasses headset technology. It\u2019s now part of a roughly $400 million dollar\ndefense contract with an upper limit of $22 billion dollars, so a lot is at\nstake with this device. What exactly is IVAS? According to the army it\u2019s \u201ca\nmixed reality heads-up display that integrates next generation situational\nawareness tools and high resolution simulations to provide soldiers with\nimproved mobility and lethality during the day or at night.\u201d So essentially It\naims to replace your night vision goggles, communications, GPS and take over\nhow you target enemy positions and run training simulations with your squad.\nWritten by: Chris Cappy Edited by: Michael Michaelides How much does it weigh\nexactly? Todd South of the army times wrote an article stating the IVAS 1.0\nversion weighed a total of 3.4 pounds with 2.4 of those lbs being the most\nimportant part which is placed on the soldiers noggin. For context, I was\nsurprised to learn that the ENVG-B also weighs about 2.5 lbs. But unlike that,\nthis is something you\u2019re wearing all day long. This suggests to me that it's\npossible the slimmed down 1.2 version of the goggles weigh even less so thats\nencouraging news. And in fact, Right off the bat the first thing that jumps\nout to me about the initial images of the version 1.2 compared to the older\nvariants, is the much improved lower profile smaller glasses. The first\nversion in 2018 looked like cumbersome skii goggles and now they look like\nlighter weight hater blockers. I mean look at the original version, they look\na little goofy. Looks like robocop 2014 when I want to look like robocop 1987.\nIn all seriousness this new version is a big step up in addressing one of the\nbiggest points of criticism that troops had who tested the first version,\nwhich was that it was uncomfortable and annoying to wear.
