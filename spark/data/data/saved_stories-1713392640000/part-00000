When we arrive at this reality that\nwas once sci-fi fodder remains the question. Now, for the first time,\nresearchers have successfully created an interface that allows for two\nmachines to connect and share stored quantum information, essentially the\nfirst tangible steps towards a \u201cquantum internet.\u201d The feat was also achieved\nat a wavelength compatible with the optical fiber system we use today for\ntelecommunications.\n\nThe breakthrough takes us closer to a world where information can be\ntransmitted with absolute security, and complex computations can be performed\nat lightning speed. This is the promise of quantum technologies, which harness\nthe bizarre properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and\nentanglement. However, realizing this potential requires the ability to\ntransfer and store quantum information, which is typically carried by single\nparticles of light called photons.\n\nOne of the most promising platforms for generating these photons is\nsemiconductor quantum dots \u2013 tiny islands of material that can emit light with\nunique quantum properties. These quantum dots are like artificial atoms, and\ncan be engineered to produce photons on demand, making them ideal candidates\nfor quantum communication protocols. However, to build a functional quantum\nnetwork, these photons need to be stored and processed, which is where atomic\nquantum memories come in. These memories use ensembles of atoms to absorb and\nstore the quantum state of light, allowing it to be retrieved at a later time.\nThe challenge lies in getting these two systems to talk to each other\neffectively.\n\nThe key to bridging this divide is to match the properties of the light\nemitted by the quantum dot with the requirements of the atomic memory. This is\nno easy task, as quantum dots typically emit light with a slightly different\ncolor and character than what atoms prefer to absorb.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, the researchers, led by Dr. Sarah Thomas from\nImperial College London and Lukas Wagner from the University of Stuttgart,\nused a range of cutting-edge techniques. First, they carefully engineered the\nquantum dot to emit light at a wavelength of 1529.3 nm, which falls within the\nlow-loss telecommunication band \u2013 the same band used by our internet\ninfrastructure. This is crucial for integrating quantum technologies with\nexisting communication networks.\n\nNext, they fine-tuned the properties of the light, using a series of filters\nand modulators to match its spectral and temporal profile to the requirements\nof the atomic memory. The memory itself is based on a protocol called ORCA\n(Off-Resonant Cascaded Absorption), which uses a cloud of rubidium atoms. When\na strong control pulse of light is applied, it dynamically changes the\nabsorption properties of the atoms, allowing them to store the quantum state\nof the incident photon.\n\nThe team\u2019s quantum dot setup at Imperial College London. (Credit: Imperial\nCollege London)\n\nThe team demonstrated that they could store single photons from the quantum\ndot in the rubidium memory with an efficiency of 12.9%, and retrieve them at a\nlater time of their choosing. Importantly, the retrieved photons retained\ntheir quantum character, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 18.2. This means that\nthe memory can store and release the fragile quantum information carried by\nthe photons without significant degradation.\n\nThis research, published in the journal Science Advances, represents a\nsignificant step towards the realization of hybrid quantum networks, where\ndifferent quantum systems are interconnected to perform complex tasks. By\ninterfacing solid-state photon emitters with atomic memories, we can envision\na future where quantum information is generated, transmitted, stored, and\nprocessed across a distributed network, much like classical information is\ntoday across the internet.\n\n\u201cInterfacing two key devices together is a crucial step forward in allowing\nquantum networking, and we are really excited to be the first team to have\nbeen able to demonstrate this,\u201d Thomas says in a media release.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges to overcome. The efficiency of the storage\nand retrieval process needs to be improved, and the storage time of the memory\nneeds to be extended. The researchers are already working on techniques to\nenhance these parameters, such as using dynamic control fields to compensate\nfor the motion of the atoms, which currently limits the memory lifetime.\n\nFurthermore, to truly scale up these systems, it will be necessary to\nintegrate them on chip-based platforms, where multiple quantum dots and\nmemories can be connected via waveguides and switches. This will require\nadvances in nanofabrication and materials science, as well as the development\nof new interface protocols.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential payoff is immense. Quantum networks\ncould enable applications such as unhackable communication, distributed\nquantum computing, enhanced sensing and metrology, and fundamental tests of\nquantum mechanics over large scales. By bringing together the best of solid-\nstate and atomic physics, this work opens the door to a new era of quantum\ntechnologies.\n\n\u201cMembers of the quantum community have been actively attempting this link for\nsome time. This includes us, having tried this experiment twice before with\ndifferent memory and quantum dot devices, going back more than five years,\nwhich just shows how hard it is to do,\u201d says co-author Dr. Patrick Ledingham\nfrom the University of Southampton. \u201cThe breakthrough this time was convening\nexperts to develop and run each part of the experiment with specialist\nequipment and working together to synchronize the devices.\u201d\n\nThe exciting experiment demonstrates the feasibility of storing and retrieving\nsingle photons from a quantum dot in an atomic quantum memory. It showcases\nthe power of hybrid quantum systems, and the potential for telecommunications\nband operation \u2013 a key requirement for real-world applications. As we continue\nto push the boundaries of quantum science and engineering, such hybrid\ninterfaces will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of quantum\ntechnologies. The future of quantum networking is bright, and it\u2019s getting\nbrighter one photon at a time.\n\nArticle reviewed by StudyFinds Editor-in-Chief Steve Fink.\n\nTags: quantum, quantum computing\n\n2 Comments\n\nAbout the Author\n\n### StudyFinds\n\nView StudyFinds's article archive\n\nThe contents of this website do not constitute advice and are provided for\ninformational purposes only.
