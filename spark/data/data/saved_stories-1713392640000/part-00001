Stonestreet was 43 and working\nas a self-employed web developer when he began experiencing strange nerve pain\nin his hands, feet, and legs. After a frightening afternoon when he found\nhimself struggling to walk, he got diagnoses of congenital spinal stenosis and\ndegenerative disc disease, conditions that required two major spinal surgeries\nto correct.\n\nDuring the nearly yearlong recovery that followed, Stonestreet was unable to\nwork. Basista left her job as a regional sales manager to take a new sales\nrole that allowed her more time at home while her partner recovered, but it\ncame with a significant pay cut. As the couple's income plummeted,\nStonestreet's insurance premiums soared to $1,200 a month.\n\n\"We realized we couldn't afford the mortgage and the car payments and\neverything,\" Stonestreet told me. \"The conventional American lifestyle just\nwasn't in our reach anymore.\" The couple sold their house in Denver, but that\nwasn't enough to break even. Over the next year and a half, they hatched an\nescape plan. In 2017, the pair relocated to Cuenca, Ecuador, and continued\nworking their old jobs remotely. Their monthly expenses dropped by 70%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasista and Stonestreet are part of an emerging cohort of Americans who, fed\nup with the cost of living at home, are seeking a better quality of life\nelsewhere. They swap advice on Reddit boards like AmerExit (57,000 members)\nand I Want Out (2 million members), consult with concierge relocation-service\nproviders that cost a few hundred to several thousand dollars a pop, and teach\nothers how to follow in their footsteps. They toss around terms like\n\"geoarbitrage\" (the notion of saving money by moving somewhere cheaper) and\nacronyms like FIRE (short for \"financial independence, retire early,\" which is\nequal parts target and mantra).\n\nSome, like Basista and Stonestreet, envision the move as the first step in a\nlong-term plan that ends in a leisurely retirement abroad. Others are drawn to\na digital-nomad lifestyle that allows them the flexibility and extra income to\ntravel the world indefinitely on a remote paycheck. Either way, they're moving\nto save money for the future, to pay off debts, or to afford more of what life\nhas to offer \u2014 all while propping up a cottage industry of companies catering\nto their every need.\n\nIt's tricky to know exactly how many Americans have relocated to other\ncountries, let alone the details of when or why. But as of 2023, there were\nalmost 161 million US passports in circulation, one for nearly half of all\nAmericans. (A generation ago, only 10% of Americans had a passport.) The State\nDepartment estimated in 2020 that a total of 9 million US citizens lived\nabroad, up from an estimated 5 million in 2010 \u2014 though those numbers include\ndual citizens born and raised abroad. The nonprofit advocacy group American\nCitizens Abroad puts the figure closer to 4 million.\n\n> \"Americans work more, vacation less, spend more on healthcare, and die\n> sooner than people in other high-income economies.\"\n\nWe do know, however, that the yearning is there. In a recent poll from\nMonmouth University, one-third of Americans said they'd like to settle in\nanother country, compared with just 12% who said the same in a 1995 Gallup\npoll. In InterNation's 2023 survey of 12,000 expats from 172 countries, the US\nwas the country of origin for the largest share of the expats.\n\nThe longing to move abroad will likely be unsurprising to anyone who has\nrecently gasped over their weekly grocery bill or chipped in on an\nacquaintance's medical GoFundMe with a six-figure goal. The Bureau of Labor\nStatistics reported that the average US household's monthly expenses jumped\nfrom $5,111 in 2020 to $6,081 in 2022. In a new Financial Technology\nAssociation survey, 61% of American workers indicated they were living\npaycheck to paycheck.\n\nAnd for what? Though there's no question that Americans enjoy a higher\nmaterial standard of living than most of the world, the nation measures poorly\nagainst its wealthy Western peers on several quality-of-life indexes:\nAmericans work more, vacation less, spend more on healthcare, and die sooner\nthan people in other high-income economies.\n\nThese factors likely explain why some Americans are moving to countries that\naren't generally considered low-cost-of-living locales. Data from the global\nrecruitment firm Deel suggests the UK, Germany, Canada, and France are among\nthe top seven international destinations for American job seekers. In places\nwith universal healthcare, government-subsidized childcare, and cultures that\nencourage a better work-life balance, your dollar can stretch further.\n\nMaliya Fale, a 22-year-old digital nomad and content creator from Minneapolis,\nhad been traveling through Latin America off and on for nearly three years\nwhen, in February, she left the US for good. \"I'm genuinely going crazy having\nto live in a toxic American capitalist society,\" she announced in a TikTok\nvideo titled \"Moving out of America.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we spoke in March, Fale was staying in the coastal town of Puerto\nMorelos, Mexico, and scoping out her next move. She said that living abroad\nafforded her a degree of flexibility and spontaneity that would be out of\nreach back home. She supports herself with remote content gigs and follows\nwhichever adventures come her way. \"The cost of America is not going to allow\nme to do that,\" she told me.\n\nOthers who have followed similar paths say they've never looked back. In\nNovember 2015, the writer Cristina Johnson packed three suitcases and boarded\na one-way flight from Pennsylvania to Belize. Johnson, now 53, has a\ndisability that makes it difficult to hold down enough work to make ends meet\nin the States. In Belize, where her monthly expenses are a mere $250, Johnson\nhas been able to build a home and save thousands while earning about $1,200 a\nmonth as a content-marketing copywriter. \"I could not even venture a guess on\nhow much I've saved over the years,\" she told Business Insider last year, \"but\neven if I saved a million dollars, it would not be as valuable as the mental,\nemotional, physical, and psychological things I have gained.\"\n\nIt has never been easier for Americans to test international waters \u2014\nparticularly in countries where greenbacks can stretch much further than they\nwould in a typical US city. More than 50 countries offer digital-nomad visas\nto remote workers able to prove they have enough funds to support themselves.\nCombine a strong US dollar with the relative ease of obtaining remote and gig-\nbased work through freelancing platforms such as Fiverr and Upwork, and it's\nno wonder that Americans of all ages are open to weighing their options\nabroad.\n\n> \"Retirement wasn't even on our radar when we were still in the US.\"\n\nAmong the numerous companies that have cropped up to meet the burgeoning\ndemand is Mexico Relocation Guide, based in Austin. Founded in 2019 by the\nhusband-and-wife duo of Mariana and Dustin Lange, the company sells relocation\nguidebooks geared toward Americans who are interested in retiring early or\nreducing their cost of living without compromising on lifestyle.\n\n\"We are very careful not to give the false idea that people are going to live\nlike kings on pennies, because that's not the case,\" Mariana Lange told me.\n\"But people do see that they can increase their quality of life for the same\namount, or even a lower amount, of money.\" She said that while some farther-\nflung destinations offer greater bang per buck than Mexico, her clientele of\nmostly 40-plus Americans see the country's relative proximity to their family\nand friends back home as a fair trade-off. Some are even able to keep seeing\ntheir primary-care providers in the US after they move. Since the pandemic\nlockdowns have subsided, Lange's business has boomed.\n\nBusiness owners in other arenas have similarly taken note of the expanding\nglobal expat population. Mark Zoril, the North Carolina-based founder of the\nfinancial-planning firm PlanVision, began working with expat clients eight or\nnine years ago, helping them manage cross-border assets and save for the\nfuture while living abroad. Today, thanks in part to a high-profile\nendorsement from Andrew Hallam, the author of \"Millionaire Expat,\" these\nclients account for a significant proportion of his company's business.\n\nZoril said most of his clients planned to remain abroad indefinitely, largely\nbecause of the high cost of returning. \"They just haven't accumulated a lot of\nassets during their working years,\" he told me. \"And so for them to come back\nto the States would be a challenge.\" He identified Central America, Portugal,\nand Spain as particularly popular destinations because of their relatively low\ncosts of living and mild climates.\n\nThough he hasn't noticed a change in the demographic makeup of his expat\nclientele \u2014 people in their 30s and 40s who don't have large savings and are\nworking to support themselves \u2014 Zoril said that in recent years these\ncustomers have generally become savvier about researching and weighing their\noptions, learning online about \"where they can live inexpensively, how they\ncan access cash, and how they can invest.\" He added: \"They can join social\ncommunities with other people that are also living this way. They have a\nbetter support network of people they can reach out to and learn from before\nthey go.\"\n\nExpat life does come with its share of potential downsides. A lower cost of\nliving often means significantly reduced earnings, which can impede someone's\nfinancial ability to return home. Cultural differences and language barriers\nadd a layer of complexity and a risk of alienation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the people whose towns and neighborhoods have recently transformed into\nexpat hot spots, the dynamic is especially fraught. On a visit to Lisbon this\nFebruary, I was shocked by the relatively few locals I saw in the city's\ncenter, where swaths of housing have been gobbled up by foreign investors and\nabsorbed into a short-term-rental market catering to international tourists,\nexpat settlers, and waves of digital nomads. With residential-property costs\nup by nearly 30% over the past five years, both old and new residents of the\nPortuguese capital are feeling the squeeze.\n\nOther expat destinations pose challenges of their own. Amid political unrest\nin Ecuador, Stonestreet and Basista swapped their adopted home for a semi-\nnomadic \"slow travel\" lifestyle in Europe. They don't regret leaving America,\nthough. From their temporary perch in Tirana, Albania, the couple told me via\nWhatsApp that their only regret about moving abroad was not doing it sooner.\nWithin three years of leaving the US, they said, they were able to pay off\n$60,000 in consumer debt and double down on saving for retirement.\n\n\"Retirement wasn't even on our radar when we were still in the US,\"\nStonestreet told me. \"We just assumed we'd work till we dropped. But life is\nshort. Tomorrow's not guaranteed.\"\n\nKelli Mar\u00eda Korducki is a journalist whose work focuses on work, tech, and\nculture.
