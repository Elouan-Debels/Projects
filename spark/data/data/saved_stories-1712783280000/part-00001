They land on a sponge cloth impregnated with\nfood and an overhead camera captures images.\n\nAI establishes if they are Asian hornets, which are an existential threat to\nthe UK\u2019s bees. If they are Asian hornets, it sends an alert to the operator\u2019s\nphone or computer.\n\nOnce the hornet has discovered an apparently safe food source they are likely\nto return and a team will be able to track the Asian hornet back to its nest.\n\nAsian hornets (Vespa velutina) have already invaded much of mainland Europe\nand last month it emerged that they may have become established in the UK\nafter the earliest-ever sighting of the insect was recorded.\n\nThey sit outside honeybee hives and capture bees as they enter and exit. Just\none Asian hornet can hunt down and eat 30 to 50 honeybees in a day.\n\nThe invention by the Exeter researchers, named VespAI, could be a gamechanger\nas it is crucial to spot the arrival of Asian hornets to an area early before\nnew queens are produced as once they are established it is almost impossible\nto get rid of them. The aim is to keep the cost of components below \u00a3100 so\nthe device can be widely used.\n\nHornets land on a sponge cloth impregnated with food inside the device and an\noverhead camera captures images.

Typically, fewer than 1% of suspected Asian hornet sightings prove\nto be correct.\n\nVespAI uses a compact processor \u2013 in effect a small computer \u2013 to operate, and\nremains dormant unless its sensors identify an insect within the size range of\na hornet.\n\nIf this happens, the system\u2019s AI algorithm activates, analysing the image to\ndetermine if it is an Asian hornet. If an Asian hornet is detected, the\nmonitor sends an alert to the user.\n\nDr Peter Kennedy, who worked on the project, said: \u201cThe majority of reports\nsubmitted are misidentified native species, meaning the agencies have to\nmanually validate thousands of images every year.\n\n\u201cIn some parts of Europe, detection relies on hornet trapping \u2013 but such traps\nkill a lot of native insects, and do little to impact Asian hornet numbers.\nVespAI ensures that live hornets can be tracked back to the nest, which is the\nonly effective way to destroy them.\u201d\n\nTracking teams can find the nest by watching which way they fly off. Repeating\nthis from other nearby spots allows the likely location of the nest to be\nestimated by triangulation.\n\nThe system was tested on the island of Jersey, which experiences high numbers\nof Asian hornet incursions. Thousands of images of Asian hornets and other\ninsects were collected and the AI learned to identify Asian hornets, based on\ncolouration, size, and morphology.\n\nThis year, the team will begin deploying additional prototypes in\ncollaboration with the UK government, the National Bee Unit, the British\nBeekeepers Association and the company Vita Bee Health.\n\nA paper on the device, titled \u201cVespAI: a deep learning-based system for the\ndetection of invasive hornets\u201d, is published in the journal Communications\nBiology.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Insects\n  * Invasive species\n  * Wildlife\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Animals\n  * Conservation\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Invertebrate of the year 2024: all hail Earth\u2019s spineless heroes\n\n2 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Monster of the moth world\u2019: why Clifden nonpareil is ultimate prize for collectors\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### In defence of slugs and moths: the pesky invertebrates Britain loves to hate\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Bedbug crisis sparks political row in Paris as insect \u2018scourge\u2019 continues\n\n29 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### At home with the red fire ant \u2013 and its many potent relatives\n\n11 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Red fire ant colonies found in Italy and could spread across Europe, says study\n\n11 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Seven new \u2018walking leaf\u2019 insect species discovered\n\n31 Aug 2023\n\n  * ### A vintage butterfly summer in Britain \u2013 what\u2019s going on?\n\n31 Aug 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Five million bees escape after crates of hives fall off truck in Canada\n\n31 Aug 2023\n\n  * ### Lax post-Brexit trade rules pave way for invasive species to come to Britain\n\n25 Aug 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
