The labor market is tight and our staff are burning\nout, should we not ease our process and forgo coding challenges, so that we\nmight secure butts-in-seats more quickly?\u201d\n\nThe Manager turned to them, and upon seeing that they were truly desperate,\nsought to teach them them using this parable:\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nA hiring manager interviewed four engineers for a new role, and as each one\napproached, the hiring manager explained that the candidate must first pass a\nsimple, non-leetcode challenge in order to advance to the next stage. The\nfirst candidate heard this and scornfully mocked the hiring manager,\n\n\u201cBro, I\u2019m an experienced engineer, if you can\u2019t look at my github and\nportfolio, and my work history and see that I can code, I don\u2019t want to work\nwith you.\u201d\n\nThis made the hiring manager feel sad.\n\nThe second candidate was nicer and agreed to take the challenge. But upon\nfailing, the candidate offered up many excuses and complaints about their\nlocal dev environment, troubles with the coding platform, and that they were\njust dealing with a stupid bug.\n\nThe third candidate accepted the challenge gladly, but upon seeing the problem\nand attempting it, hung their head and wept, for the problem was beyond their\nskill to complete. The hiring manager had pity on them, and gave them an\neasier problem, which they completed gladly.\n\nThe final candidate accepted the challenge gladly, completed it successfully\nin one-tenth the required time, and even managed to work in a few tests and an\noptimization before time expired. The hiring manager was overjoyed and the\ncandidate moved on to the next stage.\n\nThe other candidates were outraged, and they spake angrily unto the hiring\nmanager, saying:\n\n\u201cWe were qualified too, bro (brothers? brethren?), if you just give us a\nchance! Not everyone can pass a coding interview under pressure, and\nfurthermore, the problem you gave involved pirates and recursion, and pirates\nare clearly not what we\u2019d be working on on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nBut the wise hiring manager simply smiled and said, \u201cThank you for your time.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nWhen the Manager finished the parable, the engineers asked him its meaning. So\nhe explained it to them, saying, \u201cThe wise hiring manager knew that each of\nthese candidates would approach their work much as they approached the\ninterview.\n\nThe first candidate is the engineer who doesn\u2019t seem to understand that they\nadd value to the company by coding well and fast. Instead, they spend their\ntime writing careful specs, crafting stories, practicing over-the-top-TDD, and\nwriting pages of documentation that no one will ever read. But somehow, when\nit comes time to do work, they always seem to produce code at a snail\u2019s pace.\nThey work between 12 and 18 months at each job, careful to move on before\ntheir work product catches up to them and they\u2019re fired. And they manage their\njob hunt carefully, so that each new job is slightly better-looking than the\nlast, ensuring them a steady upward trajectory.\n\nThe second candidate is the engineer who will eagerly accept a new assignment\nor project, but once they encounter the typical obstacles, they will come up\nwith every excuse they can think of, blaming anything or anyone else for why\nthey\u2019re still not done. They\u2019re a pro at offering these excuses, and they can\noften keep stringing you along with very believable excuses for month after\nmonth, before they too move along to their next victim job.\n\nThe third candidate is the engineer who is extremely driven and willing to do\nwhatever it takes, but at the end of the day, just can\u2019t get the job done.\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking because this job will be disappointment to them, and to\ntheir manager. But this is a professional team, and lowering standards will\nhurt everyone on the team.\n\nThe final candidate is the engineer who is both humble and confident enough to\nbe ok with a test of their skills, because they know that the way they add\nvalue in their job is by coding well, and they\u2019re happy to prove it.\nFurthermore, they demonstrated problem solving by wrangling the buggy/broken\ntools they\u2019re given, under pressure, which may not be their day to day job,\nbut is great when the team is in a tight corner or when things go sideways in\nproduction on some legacy system.\n\nThis engineer is worth 10, sometimes 100 times the other developers.\u201d\n\nThe engineers left, and everyone marveled at the common sense wisdom of The\nManager.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Email\n\nHiring\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### About This Site\n\nThis may be a good place to introduce yourself and your site or include some\ncredits.\n\n### Find Us\n\nAddress 123 Main Street New York, NY 10001\n\nHours Monday\u2014Friday: 9:00AM\u20135:00PM Saturday & Sunday: 11:00AM\u20133:00PM\n\n### Categories\n\n  * Hiring\n  * Management\n  * Security\n  * Series: Core Controls for the Transcendent CISO\n  * Technology\n  * Uncategorized\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * The Parable of the Wise Hiring Manager\n  * Learnings from 5 years of tech startup code audits\n  * The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Secure-by-default\n  * You Don\u2019t Need Hundreds of Engineers to Build a Great Product\n  * Technology ROI Discussions are Broken\n  * 5 Software Engineering Foot-guns\n  * The Backlog Peter Principle\n  * How to find great senior engineers\n  * The Googler\u2019s Dilemma: Why Experience Will Always Have a Premium\n  * 5 Red Flags Signaling Your Rebuild Will Fail\n  * Core Control #6: Log Everything\n  * Core Control #5: Secure by Default\n  * Core Principle #4: Managing Privileged Access\n  * Core Principle #3: Continuous Security\n  * Core Principle #2: Know Your Software\n\n### Pages\n\n  * About\n  * Blog\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ken Kantzer's Blog\n\nTheme by Anders Noren \u2014 Up \u2191\n\n", "frontpage": false}
