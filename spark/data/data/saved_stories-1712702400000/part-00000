Co-author,\nProfessor Rory Naismith (Dept. of Anglo-Saxon, Norse & Celtic; Corpus Christi\nCollege), says:\n\n\u201cThere has been speculation that the silver came from Melle in France, or from\nan unknown mine, or that it could have been melted down church silver. But\nthere wasn't any hard evidence to tell us one way or the other, so we set out\nto find it.\u201d\n\nPrevious research has tested coins and artefacts from the silver mine at Melle\nbut Naismith and his colleagues turned their attention to less-studied coins\nwhich were minted in England, the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France.\n\nHelpfully, Naismith had \u201ca powerhouse of early mediaeval numismatic research\u201d\non his doorstep: The Fitzwilliam Museum.\n\nTo begin, 49 of the Fitzwilliam\u2019s coins (dating from 660 to 820 AD) were taken\nto the laboratory of Dr Jason Day in Cambridge\u2019s Dept. of Earth Sciences for\ntrace element analysis.\n\nNext, the coins were analysed by \u2018portable laser ablation\u2019 in which\nmicroscopic samples were collected onto Teflon filters for lead isotope\nanalysis.\n\nThis is a new technique, pioneered by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which\ncombines the minimally invasive sampling of laser with the high precision\nresults of more traditional methods in which physical samples of silver are\ntaken.\n\nWhile the coins mostly contained silver, the proportion of gold, bismuth and\nother elements in them guided the researchers to the silver\u2019s previously\nunknown origins. Different ratios of lead isotopes in the silver coins\nprovided further clues.\n\nThe analysis revealed two major findings...\n\nProf. Rory Naithsmith\n\nProf. Rory Naithsmith\n\nThe Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge\n\nThe Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge\n\n## Byzantine silver\n\nIn the 29 coins tested from the earlier period (660 \u2013 750 AD) \u2013 which were\nminted in England, Frisia and Francia \u2013 the researchers found a very clear\nchemical and isotopic signature matching 3^rd to early 7^th century silver\nfrom the Byzantine Empire in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nImage: Byzantine Emperor Constans II (641-668) or his son Constantine IV\n(668-685) depicted in the 7th-Century AD Mosaic of Imperial Privileges at the\nBaslica of Sant Apollinare in Classe, Italy\n\nThe silver was homogenous across the coins and characterised by high gold\nvalues (0.6 \u2013 2%) and a consistent isotopic range, with no distinguishable\nregional variations among them.\n\nNo known European ore source matches the elemental and isotopic\ncharacteristics of these early silver coins. Nor is there any meaningful\noverlap with late Western Roman silver coins or other objects. These coins did\nnot recycle late Roman silver.\n\n\u201cThis was such an exciting discovery. I proposed Byzantine origins a decade\nago but couldn\u2019t prove it,\u201d Naismith says.\n\n> \u201cNow we have the first archaeometric confirmation that Byzantine silver was\n> the dominant source behind the great seventh-century surge in minting and\n> trade around the North Sea.\u201d\n>\n> Rory Naismith\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Dr Jane Kershaw, from the University of Oxford, says:\n\n\u201cThese coins are among the first signs of a resurgence in the northern\nEuropean economy since the end of the Roman Empire. They show deep\ninternational trade connections between what is now France, the Netherlands\nand England.\u201d\n\nThe researchers emphasise that this Byzantine silver must have entered Western\nEurope decades before it was melted down because the late 7th century was a\nlow point in trade and diplomatic contacts.\n\n\u201cElites in England and Francia were almost certainly sitting on this silver\nalready,\u201d says Naismith. \u201cWe have very famous examples of this, the silver\nbowls discovered at Sutton Hoo and the ornate silver objects in the\nStaffordshire Hoard.\u201d\n\nTogether, Sutton Hoo\u2019s Byzantine silver objects weigh just over 10kg. Had they\nbeen melted down they would have produced around 10,000 early pennies.\n\nKershaw says: \u201cThese beautiful prestige objects would only have been melted\ndown when a king or lord urgently needed lots of cash. Something big would\nhave been happening, a big social change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was quantitative easing, elites were liquidating resources and pouring\nmore and more money into circulation. It would have had a big impact on\npeople\u2019s lives. There would have been more thinking about money and more\nactivity with money involving a far larger portion of society than before.\u201d\n\nNaismith hopes to establish how and why so much silver moved from the\nByzantine Empire into Western Europe. He suspects a mixture of trade,\ndiplomatic payments and Anglo-Saxon mercenaries serving in the Byzantine army.\nThe new findings also raise tantalising questions about how and where silver\nwas stored and why its owners suddenly decided to turn it into coins.\n\nThe study\u2019s second major finding revealed a later shift away from Byzantine\nsilver to a new source.\n\nShallow silver bowl from Sutton Hoo\n\nShallow silver bowl from Sutton Hoo\n\n## The rise of Frankish silver\n\nThe team analysed 20 coins from the second half of the period (750 \u2013 820 AD)\nincluding a coin of Pippin III (747 \u2013 68), five of Offa of Mercia (757 \u2013 96),\ntwo of Charlemagne (792/3 \u2013 814), a Danish Charlemagne imitation, seven of\nLouis the Pious (814 \u2013 822/3), and five of Coenwulf of Mercia (796 \u2013 821).\n\nThey discovered that the silver was very different.\n\nIt now contained low levels of gold which is most characteristic of silver\nmined at Melle in western France. Previously obtained radiocarbon data has\nshown that mining at Melle was particularly intense in the 8^th and 9^th\ncenturies.\n\nThe study proposes that Melle silver permeated regional silver stocks after\nc.750 and was mixed with older, higher-gold stocks, including Byzantine\nsilver. In the coins minted closest to Melle, the proportion of gold was\nlowest (under 0.01%) while furthest away, in northern and eastern Francia,\nthis climbed to 1.5%.\n\nWe already knew that Melle was an important mine but it wasn\u2019t clear how\nquickly the site became a major player in silver production.\n\n> \u201cWe now know that after the Carolingian dynasty came into power in 751,\n> Melle became a major force across Francia and increasingly in England too.\u201d\n>\n> Rory Naismith\n\nThe study argues that Charlemagne drove this very sudden and widespread surge\nin Melle silver as he took increasing control over how and where his kingdom\u2019s\ncoins were made.\n\nA detailed record from the 860s talks about Charlemagne\u2019s grandson, King\nCharles the Bald, reforming his coins and giving every mint a few lbs of\nsilver as a float to get the process going. \u201cI strongly suspect that\nCharlemagne did something similar with Melle silver,\u201d Naismith says.\n\nManagement of silver supply went hand-in-hand with other changes introduced by\nCharlemagne, his son and grandson including changing the size and thickness of\ncoins and marking their name or image on the coins.\n\nNaismith says: \u201cWe can now say more about the circumstances under which those\ncoins were made and how the silver was being distributed within Charlemagne's\nEmpire and beyond.\u201d\n\n## Image captions\n\n  * Image 1\n\n(Left) A coin of Charlemagne (768-814) and (Right) a coin of Offa (757-96),\nboth from the Fitzwilliam Museum\n\n  * Image 2\n\nThe silver mines at Melle\n\n  * Image 3\n\nLouis-F\u00e9lix Amiel, Charlemagne, empereur d'Occident (742-814) (Oil on canvas,\n1839)\n\n(Left) A coin of Charlemagne (768-814) and (Right) a coin of Offa (757-96),\nboth from the Fitzwilliam Museum\n\n(Left) A coin of Charlemagne (768-814) and (Right) a coin of Offa (757-96),\nboth from the Fitzwilliam Museum\n\nThe silver mines at Melle\n\nThe silver mines at Melle\n\nLouis-F\u00e9lix Amiel, Charlemagne, empereur d'Occident (742-814) (Oil on canvas,\n1839)\n\nLouis-F\u00e9lix Amiel, Charlemagne, empereur d'Occident (742-814) (Oil on canvas,\n1839)\n\n## England and Francia\n\nThe findings give new context to Charlemagne\u2019s delicate diplomatic relations\nwith King Offa of Mercia in England. Like Charlemagne, Offa took an active\nrole in the silver trade and currency management. Both kings saw trade and\npolitics as inseparable.\n\nIn a surviving letter sent to Offa in 796, Charlemagne discussed trade in\ncommodities as well as political exiles. The pair also entered a trade embargo\nwhen a marriage negotiation turned sour.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of communication and tension between Charlemagne and Offa,\u201d\nNaismith says. \u201cOffa wasn\u2019t in the same league, his kingdom was much smaller,\nhe had less power over it, and he certainly didn\u2019t have as much silver. But he\nremained one of Europe\u2019s most powerful figures who was outside of\nCharlemagne's control.\n\n\u201cSo they maintained a pretence of equality. Our findings add to a dynamic that\nEngland and France have had for a very long time.\u201d\n\nNaismith has no doubt that people in England would have been very aware that\ntheir silver was coming from Francia and that they depended on it.\n\n\u201cWhen commodities are only in certain places in limited quantities, questions\nof power and national interest will always come into play,\u201d Naismith says.\n\n\u201cIn the early Middle Ages, this transcended borders and rulers weren\u2019t the\nonly people involved. Merchants, churches and other wealthy people all had an\ninterest. Rulers taking much more direct action was new for this period.\u201d\n\nFunding\n\nThis research was carried out under an ERC Starter Grant awarded to Jane\nKershaw (Action number 802349) and an AHRC Leadership Fellowship\n(AH/S005498/1) awarded to Rory Naismith.
