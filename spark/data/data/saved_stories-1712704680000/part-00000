At\nfirst, this popularity was driven by predictive AI use cases like\nrecommendation engines and fraud detection. But increasingly, this adoption is\nall coming from generative AI.\n\n## What is vector data?\n\nLet\u2019s say that we decide to launch a very useless version of Netflix where we\nonly offer 5 movies and we only have 5 users for our service. To decide what\nmovies to recommend to each user, we might start by looking at movies each\nuser has watched all the way through:\n\nET| The Godfather| The Matrix| Star Wars| Indiana Jones  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nMike  \nDiane  \nMelissa  \nBob  \nRuth  \n  \nThen to decide which movies to recommend for a given user, we might look at\nthe movies each user has watched to find similar users who share the same\ntaste in movies. If there are no exact matches, then we move on to see which\nuser is closest. For example here, Mike and Bob both watched The Godfather and\nStar Wars, but Bob also watched ET, so that might be a good recommendation for\nMike.\n\nThis example is trivial, but imagine that we were performing this exercise\nwith 500k movies or 50M users. Now this problem becomes much more challenging\nand where high-dimensional vector data is an important tool to solve these\nproblems.\n\nOne possible vector representation would be to represent every cell in our\ntable as a 1 or a 0, using a machine learning technique called one hot\nencoding:\n\n    \n    \n    Mike: [0,1,0,1,0] Diane: [1,0,0,0,1] Melissa: [1,1,0,0,0] Bob: [1,1,0,1,0] Ruth: [0,1,0,0,1]\n\nIf you ever studied calculus and/or linear algebra, you may be thinking that\nwe could probably do matrix operations on this data to yield some interesting\nresults or compare high-dimensional vectors using techniques like dot products\nor cosine similarity and you would be exactly correct! As we\u2019ll see later in\nthis post, these techniques are widely used in vector databases!\n\n### Vector embedding models and the explosive growth of vector data\n\nWhile use cases like recommendation engines were certainly valuable, they\naren\u2019t responsible for the massive adoption of vector database capabilities\nthat we\u2019ve seen since the launch of ChatGPT. As more developers and companies\nstarted exploring ways to use large language models (LLMs), they often\nencountered limitations of pre-trained foundational model like GPT. These\nmodels didn\u2019t have access to the necessary internal information required to\nanswer questions for customers or match the tone and style that a company\u2019s\nmarketing department had built up over the years.\n\nAs a result, companies went looking for the most effective way to provide an\nLLM with relevant context. What they usually found is a certain type of\nmachine learning model that was created to handle exactly this type of\nproblem: text embeddings.\n\nA text embedding model provides a way to create mathematical representations\nof the semantic meaning of a string of text as an array of floating point\nnumbers. This unstructured data could be used to identify the most similar\nvectors which in turn would give you the piece of relevant text which has\nopened up the door for the explosion of generative AI applications we\u2019re now\nseeing today.\n\n### Other uses of vectors\n\nWhile embeddings are an important use case, it\u2019s important to remember that\nthey are not the only application for vectors and that applications such as\ncomputer vision, image recognition, object detection, and classification tasks\nalso benefit from vector representations.\n\n## What exactly is a Vector Database?\n\nNow that we understand what vector data is and why it\u2019s grown so much in\npopularity and importance, we can now consider the capabilities needed to\nstore and query this type of data effectively.\n\nAt its core, a vector database is essentially a specialized type of search\nengine. Like almost all search engines (and traditional databases), it relies\nheavily on search indexes to facilitate this capability. Typically this\nprocess starts with a user providing a query vector, and requesting that the\ndatabase perform an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search.\n\nJust like our movie example above, an ANN search will retrieve the most\nsimilar vectors to the query vector supplied by the user. Because it\u2019s common\nthat the user needs more than just one vector retrieved, you\u2019ll often see\npeople refer to this as a k-ANN search where k is the number of nearest\nneighbors to return.\n\nSo two very important capabilities of a vector database are to efficiently\nstore these data points so they can be searched, and to provide efficient\nvector search for all the vectors stored in search indexes within the\ndatabase.\n\nHowever, if the only data stored in a vector database was the vectors\nthemselves, it wouldn\u2019t be very useful as arrays of numbers aren\u2019t\nparticularly meaningful on their own. This is why there also needs to be\ncapabilities to manage and access the metadata associated with each vector.\nThis could be the chunk of text that was used to generate the vector along\nwith all the data points you might want to retrieve as well, such as the\ndocument where the context was sourced from.\n\nWhen combined with either generative AI models or more traditional machine\nlearning models, a vector database becomes an immensely useful tool that\nprovides capabilities often unavailable from a more traditional database.\n\n### Vector Databases vs. Relational Databases\n\nIncreasingly, this is becoming a false dichotomy as many databases like\nPostgreSQL add support for vector search with add-ons like pgVector. However,\nthere are definitely architectural differences between general purpose\ndatabases and those purpose-built around the needs of this specialized vector-\noriented data type.\n\nThe first core difference you\u2019ll encounter as a developer is around data\nmodeling. With specialized vector databases like Pinecone, the primary data\ntype you\u2019ll work with is a vector index. Alongside the vector index, you\u2019ll\ntypically have a metadata index which is used to manage the metadata\nassociated with each vector.\n\nYour data modeling for vector databases typically revolves around a\nfundamental decision of how many dimensions your vectors will have, which will\nbe determined by the embedding model you use for generative AI use cases.\nYou\u2019ll also need to consider the metadata filtering and retrieval that you\u2019ll\nneed to support your use cases.\n\nThe query results you\u2019ll receive from these systems will differ as well. A\nvector database will typically return a similarity measure such as the dot\nproduct, cosine similarity, or euclidean distance between the input vector and\nthe nearest neighbors along with any requested metadata for the returned data\npoints. The interface for vector databases is often a REST API or a\nPython/TypeScript library wrapper on top of that API.\n\nLikewise, many older databases that are adding vector support were built for\nthe J2EE era and rely on binary protocols with limited support for more modern\nlanguages. For this reasons, many AI engineers and app developers find\nthemselves reaching for purpose built vector databases for greenfield\napplications while those incorporating generative AI capabilities into\nestablished applications reach for their existing database with a bolt-on\noption.\n\n## How Vector Databases Work\n\n### How Do Vector Databases Store Data?\n\nVector databases store data by using vector embeddings. Vector databases excel\nat managing high-dimensional vectors, typically by storing data on multiple\nnodes, often relying on sharding and/or partitioning techniques to provide\nscalable search across large volumes of vectors. This capability to store and\nindex high-dimensional vector data efficiently sets vector databases apart\nfrom traditional databases.\n\nIndexing these vectors, a process critical for performing efficient similarity\nsearches, utilizes specialized structures optimized for Approximate Nearest\nNeighbor (ANN) search. This allows a vector database to quickly perform many\nvector similarity search requests against the underlying structures of the\nindexes. This augments metadata storage and allows vector databases to manage\nand search through massive datasets, a task that is difficult for traditional\ndatabase systems.\n\n## Key Features of Vector Databases\n\nA vector database excels at managing both high dimensional vectors and vector\ndata within a multidimensional vector space, setting it apart from traditional\nrelational databases. It is optimized for storing and indexing vector\nembeddings, essential components that encapsulate data\u2019s essence, ranging from\nboth numerical data and graph data to sensor data. This optimization allows\nLLMs to efficiently process and retrieve vectors and \u201cunderstand\u201d complex\ninformation.\n\n### Fast and Accurate Similarity Search\n\nOne of the key capabilities of a vector database is its ability to conduct\nefficient similarity searches through vector space, using similarity measures\nlike cosine similarity. This functionality of vector search is crucial for\napplications such as semantic information retrieval and anomaly detection,\naiming to find items or patterns similar to a given query in vector space. The\nprecision and speed of these searches are enhanced by advanced indexing\ntechniques, such as Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, enabling quick\nretrieval of large vectors and facilitating approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch searches.\n\n#### Significance of Similarity Search in AI\n\nVector search, or similarity search, enabled by a vector database, permits AI\nsystems to precisely identify the nearest neighbors in a dataset based on\ncomplex similarity measures. This approach, based on vector embeddings,\nexceeds the capabilities of traditional databases by utilizing the vector\ndatabase\u2019s ability to manage vector embeddings and perform similarity searches\nacross extensive, vector datasets. The use of vector embeddings and embedding\nmodels increases the relevance and accuracy of search results, crucial for\ntasks like image recognition, content recommendation, machine learning, and\ncomputer vision.\n\n### Handling Large Volumes of Vector Data\n\nMost vector databases have an architecture that enables it to manage large\ndata volumes within a multi-dimensional space efficiently. It employs data\nstructures optimized for the nearest neighbor search and efficient similarity\nsearch, supporting complex AI applications that require access to vast amounts\nof training data, including those involved in machine learning, deep learning,\nand AI vision.\n\n### Real-time Updates\n\nThe dynamic capability of a vector database to support real-time access\ncontrol and updates, including the addition of new vector embeddings and\nadjustments of managing vector embeddings indexes without significant downtime\nor re-indexing, is crucial. This feature is particularly important for\napplications requiring access control and immediate data updates, such as\ndynamic pricing models, fraud detection systems, and real-time content\npersonalization machine learning models.\n\nThe unique capabilities of a vector database, make it an indispensable tool\nfor modern AI applications.They contribute to the advancement of machine\nlearning technologies and are a must-have for most enterpises.\n\n## Advanced Algorithms and Techniques\n\nVector databases use advanced algorithms and techniques for efficient storage,\nindexing, and retrieval of vectors, with Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)\nsearch methods being key.\n\n### Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)\n\nThe HNSW algorithm, notable for its efficiency, constructs a multi-layered\ngraph to enable swift navigation through each vector index within a hierarchy.\nThis key algorithm is one of the most important aspects to how vector\ndatabases work.\n\n### How a Vector Database Indexes Vectors\n\nVector databases adopt various strategies for indexing, such as distributing\ndata across nodes for parallel processing and using hashing to reduce search\nspaces. Data structure techniques also help vector databases excel in\noptimizing storage and retrieval processes based on the target similarity\nmetrics.\n\nThe machine learning models you use to generate text embeddings will dictate\nthe number of dimensions per vector. Each dimension corresponds to a feature\nin the hidden state of the model. In practice, this means that larger vectors\ncan represent more nuanced meaning in language, but with a trade off around\nsearch performance and the storage required to manage your indexed vectors on\nan ongoing basis.\n\n#### Optimizing Query Vector Retrieval\n\nOptimizing query vector retrieval involves strategies to ensure fast and\nrelevant search results. Distributing the dataset, utilizing machine learning\nmodels for organization, and implementing quantization are methods used by\nvector databases to enhance the efficiency of retrieving query vectors,\ncritical for maintaining the performance of AI applications as data volumes\ngrow.\n\n## Applications and Use Cases\n\n### Enhancing Generative AI and Large Language Models\n\nThe integration of vector databases significantly boosts the performance of AI\nmodels, especially in generative AI and large language models. These vector\ndatabases provide enable the efficient handling and retrieval of high-\ndimensional data, which is crucial for training sophisticated AI systems.\n\nBy providing rapid access to relevant vector embeddings, they enhance the AI\nmodels\u2019 ability to understand and generate human-like text, images, or other\ncontent.\n\n### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is by far the single biggest driver for\nvector databases and represents a groundbreaking approach allowing developers\nto leverage unstructured data in generative AI use cases. RAG uses a query\nvector to fetch related chunks of unstructured data from a vector database,\nenriching the context available to a natural language processing model during\nthe generation process. Retrieval augmented generation allows for the creation\nof more accurate, contextually rich, and nuanced outputs, demonstrating the\ncritical role of efficient data retrieval in natural language processing\ntasks.\n\n### Semantic Search and Recommendations\n\nIn the realm of semantic search and recommendation systems, the ability for\nvector databases to conduct vector searches is key. By analyzing user queries\nand content through vector embeddings, these hybrid search and recommendation\nsystems can identify and recommend items in ways far better than simple\nkeyword matching and is a growing use case for vector databases.\n\n## The Future of Vector Database and Generative AI Technologies\n\n### Challenges and Opportunities\n\nManaging high-dimensional data introduces both challenges and opportunities\nfor AI innovation. When you bring in a purpose built vector database, it adds\ncomplexity to your overall architecture. You have one more potential point of\nfailure to monitor, one more component to manage and another piece of\ninfrastructure to budget for.\n\nThat said, vector databases offer considerable opportunities as well. Almost\nevery organization will certainly have a growing number of use cases that rely\non generative ai. Adopting a vector database early ensures you have one of the\nkeep capabilities in your generative AI tech stack to support your roadmap for\nthe coming years.\n\nAt the same time, as your application portfolio grows, you will almost\ncertainly need to vectorize more and more data into your vector database. It\nis entirely possible that enterprises will seek ways to put their entire\ncollective knowledge into a vector database so that it\u2019s easily available as\nyou incorporate generative AI models into existing and new applications.\n\nAs this happens, managing these vector indexes and applying governance to\nensure they remain accurate and up to date becomes a bigger and bigger\nchallenge (and one that Vectorize is here to solve for you!).\n\n## Best Practices and Tips\n\n#### Pick the right embedding model\n\nYour vector database performance and costs will largely be tied to the\nquantity of vectors and how many dimensions each of those vectors has, along\nwith the amount of metadata you will be storing for each vector. Generally\nspeaking, you will want to select your embedding model by using a data driven\napproach to determine which models give you the most relevant context along\nwith an assessment of the price-performance tradeoffs you\u2019ll make.\n\nFor example, we conducted the following experiment with a representative\nsample of data using the Vectorize experiment feature:\n\nYou can see from the average relevancy scores above, this corpus of documents\nabout prompt engineering achieved slightly better results with the OpenAI\ntext-embeddings-v3-large model vs the smaller model from Mistral, but just\nbarely. However, the vectors from OpenAI are 3x larger than the Mistral\nembeddings and your costs to use the embedding API from OpenAI will result in\nconsiderable additional costs for a tiny improvement in relevancy.\n\n#### Mitigate stale data and vector drift\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that developers and companies encounter when\nadopting vector databases is that their vector indexes slowly get out of sync\nas the source data from their knowledge repositories changes.\n\nOne of the advantages to using a platform like Vectorize is that your vector\ndatabase automatically gets updated as soon as any change in the source data\nis detected, usually in real time with any systems that have a change event\nnotification API.\n\n#### Consider your data engineering capabilities\n\nMost organizations typically have data engineering capabilities that revolve\naround structured data ETL. These tools are usually a poor fit for the\nunstructured data that you\u2019ll primarily be ingesting into your vector database\nor vector store for use cases like retrieval augmented generation.\n\nData engineering for your vector database poses unique challenges as well.\nWith traditional data engineering, your end state is well defined. However,\nwith vector databases, you only know that your output should be a vector.\n\nVectorize gives you the ability to ingest data from any unstructured data\nsource such as files, knowledge bases, and SaaS platforms and use a data\ndriven approach to know for certain that your vector database is optimized to\nachieve optimal relevancy and performance for your data.\n\n#### Use metadata filtering\n\nEspecially as the volume of vectors in your vector database grows, it will be\nincreasingly important for you to think about the metadata fields you\u2019ll want\nto filter on. This has the effect of narrowing down the vector set where\nyou\u2019ll perform your similarity search and in turn improves the performance\ntime of your ANN searches.\n\nVectorize has powerful metadata detection and automation capabilities that\ngreatly simplifies the process of capturing, collecting, and organizing your\nmetadata in your vector database.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVector databases are an essential component for organizations preparing their\ndata strategy to support generative AI. As machine learning continues to\nevolve and as we increasingly rely on generative AI to accelerate almost every\njob in every business, having the right data infrastructure is of paramount\nimportance. This of course includes picking the right vector database but also\nthe data engineering and ongoing management capabilities that surround it. For\nany organization who doesn\u2019t want to get left behind as competitors use\ngenerative AI to disrupt industries, vector databases and vector data\nmanagement must be considered a top priority.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Pinterest\n  * Threads\n  * X\n\n### Related\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n#### Search\n\n#### Categories\n\n#### Recent posts\n\n  * Retrieval Augmented Generation: The Surprisingly Easy Path To AI Relevancy\n\n  * The Ultimate Guide To Vector Database Success In AI\n\n  * How to Make the Most of Prompt Engineering\n\n#### Tags\n\nRAG Retrieval Augmented Generation\n\nThe easiest, fastest way to connect your data to your LLMs.\n\n##### Resources\n\n  * Support center\n  * Documentation\n  * Community\n  * Hosting\n\n##### Company\n\n  * About us\n  * Latest news\n  * Contact us\n  * Resources\n\n\u00a9 Vectorize AI, Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n## Discover more from Vectorize\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\nLoading Comments...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
