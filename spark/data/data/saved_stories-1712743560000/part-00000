The rule advances President Joe Biden\u2019s\ncommitment to environmental justice by delivering critical health protections\nfor communities burdened by industrial pollution from ethylene oxide,\nchloroprene and other dangerous chemicals, officials said.\n\nAreas that will benefit from the new rule include majority-Black neighborhoods\noutside New Orleans that EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited as part of\nhis 2021 Journey to Justice tour. The rule will significantly reduce emissions\nof chloroprene and other harmful pollutants at the Denka Performance Elastomer\nfacility in LaPlace, Louisiana, the largest source of chloroprene emissions in\nthe country, Regan said.\n\n\u201cEvery community in this country deserves to breathe clean air. That\u2019s why I\ntook the Journey to Justice tour to communities like St. John the Baptist\nParish, where residents have borne the brunt of toxic air for far too long,\u201d\nRegan said. \u201cWe promised to listen to folks that are suffering from pollution\nand act to protect them. Today we deliver on that promise with strong final\nstandards to slash pollution, reduce cancer risk and ensure cleaner air for\nnearby communities.\u201d\n\nWhen combined with a rule issued last month cracking down on ethylene oxide\nemissions from commercial sterilizers used to clean medical equipment, the new\nrule will reduce ethylene oxide and chloroprene emissions by nearly 80%,\nofficials said.\n\nThe rule will apply to 218 facilities spread across Texas and Louisiana, the\nOhio River Valley, West Virginia and the upper South, the EPA said. The action\nupdates several regulations on chemical plant emissions that have not been\ntightened in nearly two decades.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Troy Carter, whose Louisiana district includes the Denka\nplant, called the new rule \u201ca monumental step\u201d to safeguard public health and\nthe environment.\n\n\u201cCommunities deserve to be safe. I\u2019ve said this all along,\u201d Carter told\nreporters at a briefing Monday. \u201cIt must begin with proper regulation. It must\nbegin with listening to the people who are impacted in the neighborhoods, who\nundoubtedly have suffered the cost of being in close proximity of chemical\nplants \u2014 but not just chemical plants, chemical plants that don\u2019t follow the\nrules.\u201d\n\nCarter said it was \u201ccritically important that measures like this are\ndemonstrated to keep the confidence of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe new rule will slash more than 6,200 tons (5,624 metric tonnes) of toxic\nair pollutants annually and implement fenceline monitoring, the EPA said,\naddressing health risks in surrounding communities and promoting environmental\njustice in Louisiana and other states.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Denka last year, saying it had been releasing\nunsafe concentrations of chloroprene near homes and schools. Federal\nregulators had determined in 2016 that chloroprene emissions from the Denka\nplant were contributing to the highest cancer risk of any place in the United\nStates.\n\nDenka, a Japanese company that bought the former DuPont rubber-making plant in\n2015, said it \u201cvehemently opposes\u201d the EPA\u2019s latest action.\n\n\u201cEPA\u2019s rulemaking is yet another attempt to drive a policy agenda that is\nunsupported by the law or the science,\u201d Denka said in a statement, adding that\nthe agency has alleged its facility \u201crepresents a danger to its community,\ndespite the facility\u2019s compliance with its federal and state air permitting\nrequirements.\u201d\n\nThe Denka plant, which makes synthetic rubber, has been at the center of\nprotests over pollution in majority-Black communities and EPA efforts to curb\nchloroprene emissions, particularly in the Mississippi River Chemical\nCorridor, an 85-mile (137-kilometer) industrial region known informally as\nCancer Alley. Denka said it already has invested more than $35 million to\nreduce chloroprene emissions.\n\nThe EPA, under pressure from local activists, agreed to open a civil rights\ninvestigation of the plant to determine if state officials were putting Black\nresidents at increased cancer risk. But in June the EPA dropped its\ninvestigation without releasing any official findings and without any\ncommitments from the state to change its practices.\n\nRegan said the rule issued Tuesday was separate from the civil rights\ninvestigation. He called the rule \u201cvery ambitious,\u201d adding that officials took\ncare to ensure \u201cthat we protect all of these communities, not just those in\nCancer Alley, but communities in Texas and Puerto Rico and other areas that\nare threatened by these hazardous air toxic pollutants.\u201d\n\nWhile it focuses on toxic emissions, \u201cby its very nature, this rule is\nproviding protection to environmental justice communities \u2014 Black and brown\ncommunities, low-income communities \u2014 that have suffered for far too long,\u201d\nRegan said.\n\nPatrice Simms, vice president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice,\ncalled the rule \u201ca victory in our pursuit for environmental justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always more to do to demand that our laws live up to their full\npotential,\u201d Simms said, \u201cbut EPA\u2019s action today brings us a meaningful step\ncloser to realizing the promise of clean air, the promise of safe and livable\ncommunities and... more just and more equitable environmental protections.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### EPA sets strict emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks and buses in bid\nto fight climate change\n\nAP | Washington\n\n### EPA issues new auto rules aimed at cutting carbon emissions and boosting\nelectric vehicles and hybrids\n\nAP | Washington\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Joseph Biden\n  * C\u00e1ncer\n  * Environmental Protection Agency\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So wenig kosten Treppenlifte 2024 wirklichTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nSolar Vergleich\n\nLohnt sich eine Solaranlage?
