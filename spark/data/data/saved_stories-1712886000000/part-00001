TSA officers found 1,503 firearms,\nwhich amounts to about 16.5 guns found each day across the nation\u2019s airports,\nwhich is slightly down for the same time period last year when officers found\n16.8 firearms per day or 7.9 firearms per one million passengers, according to\nthe news release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis handgun was discovered in the carry-on bag of a passenger at Baltimore\nWashington International Airport.\n\n(TSA )\n\n\u201cWhile it is certainly promising that the rate of passengers bringing firearms\nto the checkpoint has decreased, one firearm at the checkpoint is too many,\u201d\nTSA Administrator David Pekoske said in the news release. \u201cThe demand for air\ntravel is as strong as ever and security is always our number one priority.\nEvery time we discover a firearm at the checkpoint, the security screening\nprocess is slowed down for all.\u201d\n\nWorld & Nation\n\n### Some travelers will be able to screen themselves at security at Las Vegas\nairport. Here\u2019s how it works\n\nTSA is unveiling a self-service security screening system at the Harry Reid\nInternational Airport in Las Vegas.\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\nPeople can travel with firearms, but they need to properly pack and check\ntheir baggage, Pekoske said. The baggage with the firearms must also be\ndeclared to the airline at the ticket counter and should be packed unloaded in\na hard-sided case.\n\n\u201cWe always recommend passengers start with a clean bag when they pack to\nensure no firearms, weapons or other prohibited items are present,\u201d Pekoske\nsaid.\n\nA TSA spokesperson demonstrates how to pack a gun in a case accepted by the\nagency for checked luggage.\n\n(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe TSA does not confiscate guns at its checkpoints, but instead contacts\nlocal law enforcement to safely unload and take possession of the firearm,\naccording to the TSA. This could lead police to arrest or cite the passenger,\nand the TSA could impose a fine up to $15,000. Those passengers could also\nlose access for up to five years to the TSA\u2019s expedited screening process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were about 15 million more travelers screened this year than last year,\nbut the TSA did not provide a breakdown for individual airports.\n\nLast year, TSA officers found 145 guns in travelers\u2019 carry-on luggage across\nfive Southern California airports. That includes 81 guns found on passengers\nat LAX; 20 at Ontario International Airport; 25 at John Wayne Airport in\nOrange County; nine at Hollywood Burbank Airport and 10 at Long Beach Airport,\naccording to the TSA. Data for 2023 continued a steady increase for previous\nyears for the five airports, where 94 firearms were discovered in 2018.\n\nSecurity officers found 33 firearms in the first quarter of this year across\nthe five airports, according to officials, and 37 in the previous year, with\nLAX leading the pack with 16 in 2024 and 18 in 2023.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Judge rules California background check, anti-importation rules for ammo unconstitutional\n\nJan. 31, 2024\n\n  * ### New gun law has blocked more than 500 firearms from being bought by young people, attorney general says\n\nJan. 6, 2024\n\n  * ### Passenger complaints against airlines set to double this year after catastrophic 2022\n\nDec. 18, 2023\n\nWorld & NationCaliforniaBreaking News\n\nNathan Solis\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n\nNathan Solis is a Metro reporter covering breaking news at the Los Angeles\nTimes.
