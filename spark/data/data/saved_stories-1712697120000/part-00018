Are they safe?\n\n## Smoke-free, flavored nicotine pouches, including the brand Zyn, are popular\namong young people and are going viral on TikTok. Johns Hopkins behavioral\npharmacologist Tory Spindle weighs in on their safety.\n\nBy Malissa Rodenburg\n\n/ Published\n\nMar 8\n\nIn an impressive showing of alliteration, Sen. Chuck Schumer recently\ndescribed the trending nicotine product Zyn as a \"pouch packed with problems\"\nwhile delivering a warning to parents and calling for a federal investigation\ninto the brand's marketing tactics and health effects.\n\nImage caption: Tory Spindle\n\nYou may not have heard of Zyn or its peers\u2014brands like On!, VELO, and\nRogue\u2014but sales of these smoke-free, often tobacco-free nicotine pouches\nincreased from 126 million units between August and December 2019 to more than\n808 million between January and March 2022. In 2022, tobacco conglomerate\nPhilip Morris International bet big on Zyn, acquiring its parent company\nSwedish Match as part of its push into smokeless products. Zyn and other oral\nnicotine products are expected to bring $2 billion in U.S. revenue this year.\nAnd on social media sites like TikTok, the product is popular among so-called\n\"zynfluencers\" who document their use daily, tucking a pouch discreetly into\ntheir upper lip before school, work, or gym sessions, in the middle of sports\ngames, while playing video games, and conducting taste-tests with friends.\n\nSold in 3 mg and 6 mg doses, the pouches deliver nicotine directly into the\nbloodstream through the mouth's membrane lining, rather than through the\nlungs. In many ways, the pouches are safer than other nicotine products on the\nmarket because they do not use tobacco leaves and therefore have fewer\ncarcinogens. But they are not risk-free: They can be addictive and cause\ncardiovascular issues, gum damage, and nausea. Experts also express concern\nabout how easy they are to conceal and the variety of flavors\noffered\u2014peppermint, coffee, and citrus, to name a few\u2014that make them appealing\nto kids.\n\nThese brands \"really highlight flavors, and all of the pouches have catchy one\nsyllable names. It almost seems like they're trying to make them come off more\nlike a gum rather than an actual nicotine product,\" says Tory Spindle, an\nassociate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\n\"Something that concerns us are claims about the product being discreet,\" adds\nMeghan Moran, an associate professor in the Department of Health, Behavior,\nand Society at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who is\nworking with Spindle to research nicotine pouches. \"We are worried that this\ncould be appealing to young people\u2014and we are currently conducting a study to\nfind out if this is the case.\"\n\nThe Hub caught up with Spindle to learn more about this emerging form of\nnicotine.\n\n### What initially caught your attention about nicotine pouches as a\nresearcher?\n\nI saw a lot of parallels between e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. They seem\nlike they have a lot of flavors that would make them appealing to [youth], but\nthe harm with youth using nicotine products is there are unknowns with their\nlong-term effects, and it also could lead to other product use. But on the\nother hand, they're unquestionably safer than existing tobacco products.\n\nAnd so that's where the public health dilemma is: How do we make them\naccessible to cigarette smokers or oral tobacco users\u2014people who dip or\nchew\u2014so they can use a less harmful product, while not also inadvertently\nmaking a bunch of new people addicted to nicotine who otherwise would have\nnever tried products like that?\n\n### When you say we don't yet know the long-term effects of these products,\nare you referring to nicotine on its own, sans tobacco?\n\nThe pouches have flavorings and other constituents in there that haven't\nhistorically been in nicotine products before. So while they don't have the\nconventional carcinogens we know are present at high levels in tobacco, we\ndon't know what some of the other things are going to do.\n\nThe other thing, too, is that when people are using any drug when they're\nstill in adolescence, their brain is still developing. Use of nicotine or\nother addictive things can impact your brain development in ways that are hard\nto predict.\n\n### So what is known about nicotine pouch safety?\n\nWe do know from my research that they can cause acute adverse events. Some\npeople report nausea. Some people have reported developing mouth lesions from\nusing them too much. But it's undeniable that they have less conventional\ncarcinogens compared to oral tobacco products, like chewing tobacco and\nwhatnot.\n\n### I've also seen it promoted as a stimulant, something that improves mental\nclarity. Is there any science behind that?\n\nThere [are studies showing] that nicotine is a stimulant and can boost\ncognitive functioning. There is some truth to that. But do you want young\npeople who otherwise wouldn't use a tobacco product to be using it for that\npurpose over another stimulant with less abuse potential and issues\u2014caffeine,\nfor example?\n\n### Are there major differences among the various brands on the market?\n\nNot all of them are actually tobacco free. Some of them contain tobacco-\nderived nicotine. There are trace components of tobacco-specific nitrosamines\nand things that are harmful, but it's still much, much lower than chewing\ntobacco, for example. Then there are other pouches that contain synthetically\nmade nicotine, which is made in the lab and is not derived from tobacco. I\ndon't know if it's always apparent from the label whether it's synthetic or\nnot, but that's a nuance that we've seen in our research.\n\nPosted in Health, Voices+Opinion\n\nTagged psychiatry, social media, behavioral science, e-cigarettes, vaping\n\nShare on X\n\nShare on Facebook 34\n\nPin it on Pinterest\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on X\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nPin it on Pinterest\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\n###### You might also like\n\nTechnology+Society\n\n##### How to measure the health of online communities\n\nMar 6\n\nBeing dominated by one group or ideology is the hallmark of an unhealthy\nonline space, Hopkins experts say\n\n##### Awestruck\n\nWinter 2023\n\nAs researchers discover the benefits of this little-understood, larger-than-\nlife emotion, Johns Hopkins scientists figured out how to measure it. / Johns\nHopkins Magazine\n\nPsychiatry\n\n##### A history of healing\n\nSummer 2023\n\nKay Redfield Jamison discusses her latest book, which takes a nonlinear\napproach to cataloging the history of psychotherapy / Johns Hopkins Magazine\n\nPsychiatry\n\n##### A history of healing\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\nKay Redfield Jamison discusses her latest book, which takes a nonlinear\napproach to cataloguing the history of psychotherapy\n\n###### Trending\n\nAstronomy\n\n##### Hopkins experts discuss the total solar eclipse\n\nApr 5\n\nPanelists encouraged viewers to witness the rare event on April 8 firsthand if\npossible, and shared the science behind what makes a total solar eclipse so\nspecial\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\n##### 'Nonstop, relentless, inspiring'\n\nApr 4\n\nThe FastForward U innovation hub will be renamed in honor of Pava Marie\nLaPere, a trailblazing entrepreneur both at Johns Hopkins University and in\nBaltimore who died last year\n\nUndergraduate Honors\n\n##### Two juniors named Goldwater Scholars\n\nApr 5\n\nGoldwater Scholarship provides financial support to undergraduates pursuing\nresearch careers in STEM fields\n\nHealth+Well-being\n\n##### The pros, cons, and unknowns of popular weight-loss drugs\n\nJan 11\n\nAre in-demand drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy safe and effective?
