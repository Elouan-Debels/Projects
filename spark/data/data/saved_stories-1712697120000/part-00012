They focused\non three different white dwarfs, which all behaved very differently.\n\nThe first white dwarf studied \u2013 known as ZTF J0328-1219 \u2013 appeared steady and\n\u201cwell-behaved\u201d over the last few years, but the authors found evidence for a\nmajor catastrophic event around 2010.\n\nAnother star \u2013 known as ZTF J0923+4236 \u2013 was shown to dim irregularly every\ncouple of months, and shows chaotic variability on timescales of minutes\nduring these fainter states, before brightening again.\n\nThe third white dwarf analysed \u2013 WD 1145+017 \u2013 had been shown by Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology (MIT) in 2015 to behave close to theoretical\npredictions, with vast variations in numbers, shapes and depths of transits.\nSurprisingly in this latest study, the transits are now totally gone.\n\n\u201cThe system is, overall, very gently getting brighter, as the dust produced by\ncatastrophic collisions around 2015 disperses,\u201d said Gaensicke. \u201cThe\nunpredictable nature of these transits can drive astronomers crazy \u2013 one\nminute they are there, the next they are gone. And this points to the chaotic\nenvironment they are in.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the fate of our own solar system, Gaensicke, said: \u201cThe sad\nnews is that the Earth will probably just be swallowed up by an expanding sun,\nbefore it becomes a white dwarf.\n\n\u201cFor the rest of the solar system, some of the asteroids located between Mars\nand Jupiter, and maybe some of the moons of Jupiter may get dislodged and\ntravel close enough to the eventual white dwarf to undergo the shredding\nprocess we have investigated.\u201d\n\nThis study is published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal\nAstronomical Society (MNRAS).\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Space\n  * Physics\n  * University of Warwick\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
