Credit: Dmitriy Aronov\n\nBlack-capped chickadees have extraordinary memories that can recall the\nlocations of thousands of morsels of food to help them survive the winter. Now\nscientists at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute have discovered how the\nchickadees can remember so many details: they memorize each food location\nusing brain cell activity akin to a barcode. These new findings may shed light\non how the brain creates memories for the events that make up our lives.\n\n\"We see the world through our memories of objects, places and people,\" said\nDmitriy Aronov, Ph.D., a principal investigator at Columbia's Zuckerman\nInstitute and an assistant professor of neuroscience at Columbia's Vagelos\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons.\n\n\"Memories entirely define the way we see and interact with the world. With\nthis bird, we have a way to understand memory in an incredibly simplified way,\nand in understanding their memory, we will understand something about\nourselves.\"\n\nThis barcode-like formatting of memory, revealed for the first time in the\njournal Cell, may be a common tactic in animal brains, including those of\nhumans.\n\n\"There are many findings in humans that are totally consistent with a barcode\nmechanism,\" said postdoctoral research fellow Selmaan Chettih, Ph.D., the\nstudy's co-first author along with Emily Mackevicius, Ph.D.\n\nChickadees are \"memory geniuses,\" said Dr. Aronov, the study's corresponding\nauthor. They are masters of episodic memory\u2014the brain's ability to recall\nspecific moments, such as stashing a bit of food away under tree bark or in a\nknothole. This can prove a matter of life or death for them, since unlike most\nbirds that live in cold places, chickadees don't migrate during the winter.\nThis means their survival hinges on remembering where they hid food during\nwarmer months, with some making up to 5,000 of these stashes per day.\n\nChickadees caching seeds in the testing arena. Credit: Cell/Chettih et al.\n\nScientists have long known that these birds rely on the hippocampus\u2013a brain\nstructure critical for memory in all vertebrates, including humans\u2013for storing\nmemories of their caches. However, no one had identified the specific neural\nactivity in the hippocampus that encodes episodic memories such as food-\ncaching events.\n\n\"The question we're trying to answer is, 'What physically is a memory?'\" Dr.\nChettih said.\n\nChickadees may help scientists unlock this mystery. To explore the prodigious\nmemories of chickadees, Dr. Aronov and his team built indoor arenas inspired\nby the birds' natural habitats.\n\n\"Scientists have marveled at the memory of these birds for decades, but what\nhas been a mystery is what was going on in their brains to support these\nmemories,\" said Dr. Aronov. \"Now we have neural recording and behavior\ntracking tools at our disposal to advance our knowledge of how these birds are\ncapable of these feats of memory.\"\n\nIn typical experiments, a black-capped chickadee instinctively hides sunflower\nseeds in holes in the arenas as the researchers monitor activity in the\nhippocampus. Meanwhile, six cameras also record the birds as they flit about,\nwith an artificial intelligence system automatically tracking them as they\nstash and retrieve seeds.\n\nChickadee seed caching with 3D postural tracking. Credit: Cell/Chettih et al.\n\nThe scientists unexpectedly found that each time a chickadee stashed a seed,\nhippocampal neurons fired in a unique pattern. These fleeting patterns\nreactivated when the birds retrieved that specific food cache.\n\n\"These are very striking patterns of activity, but they're very brief\u2014only\nabout a second long on average,\" Dr. Chettih said. \"If you didn't know exactly\nwhen and why they happened, it would be very easy to miss them.\"\n\nAs the researchers mulled over their data, the idea of neural barcodes as\nunique labels for different events began to make sense, they said.\n\nThese barcode patterns exist independently from the activity of hippocampal\nneurons, called place cells, which encode memories of locations. Each barcode\nremains distinct, even when it comes to stashes hidden at the same place but\ndifferent times, or at neighboring stashes made in quick succession.\n\n\"Many hippocampal studies have focused on place cells, with the Nobel Prize\nawarded for their discovery in 2014,\" Dr. Aronov said.\n\n\"So the assumption in the field was that episodic memory must have something\nto do with changes in place cells. We find that place cells don't actually\nchange when birds form new memories. Instead, during food caching, there are\nadditional patterns of activity beyond those seen with place cells.\"\n\nGoing forward, the researchers want to see if the chickadees activate barcodes\nwhen looking for caches from remote locations.\n\n\"That's what we might expect if they are planning to retrieve a cached item\nbefore they actually do it,\" Dr. Chettih said. \"We want to identify those\nmoments when a bird is thinking about a location but it's not there yet, and\nsee if activating a barcode might drive a bird to go to a cache.\"\n\nThe researchers are also eager to know if the barcoding tactic they have\nuncovered chickadees is in widespread use among other animals, including\nhumans. Such research may help shed light on a core part of the human\nexperience.\n\n\"If you think about how people define themselves, who they think they are,\ntheir sense of self, then episodic memories of particular events are central\nto that,\" Dr. Chettih said. \"That's what we're trying to understand.\"\n\nMore information: Barcoding of episodic memories in the hippocampus of a food-\ncaching bird, Cell (2024).
