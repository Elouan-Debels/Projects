(Credit: Veronica Tollenaar,\nUniversit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles.)\n\nUsing artificial intelligence, satellite observations, and climate model\nprojections, a team of researchers from Switzerland and Belgium calculate that\nfor every tenth of a degree of increase in global air temperature, an average\nof nearly 9,000 meteorites disappear from the surface of the ice sheet. This\nloss has major implications, as meteorites are unique samples of\nextraterrestrial bodies that provide insights into the origin of life on Earth\nand the formation of the Moon.\n\n## Disappearing at an alarming rate\n\nBy 2050, about a quarter of the estimated of 300,000 - 800,000 meteorites in\nAntarctica will be lost due to glacial melt. By end of the century,\nresearchers anticipate that number could rise approaching a loss of meteorites\ncloser to three-quarters of the meteorites on the continent under a high-\nwarming scenario.\n\nPublished in the journal Nature Climate Change, Harry Zekollari co-led the\nstudy while working under Professor Daniel Farinotti in the Laboratory of\nHydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology at the Department of Civil, Environmental\nand Geomatic Engineering at ETH Zurich. Zekollari and co-lead Veronica\nTollenaar, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, reveal in the study that ongoing\nwarming results in the loss of about 5,000 meteorites a year, outpacing the\ncollection efforts of Antarctic meteorites by a factor five.\n\n## Meteorites \u2013 time capsules of the universe\n\nZekollari, now an Associate Professor of Glaciology at Vrije Universiteit\nBrussel, calls for a major international effort to preserve the scientific\nvalue of meteorites, \u201cWe need to accelerate and intensify efforts to recover\nAntarctic meteorites. The loss of Antarctic meteorites is much like the loss\nof data that scientists glean from ice cores collected from vanishing glaciers\n\u2013 once they disappear, so do some of the secrets of the universe.\u201d\n\nMeteorites are fragments from space that provide unique information about our\nsolar system. Antarctica is the most prolific place to find meteorites, and to\ndate, about 60 percent of all meteorites ever found on Earth have been\ncollected from the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet. The flow of the ice\nsheet concentrates meteorites in so-called \u201cmeteorite stranding zones\u201d, where\ntheir dark crust allows them to be easily detected. In addition to\nintensifying recovery operations, there is potential to increase the\nefficiency of meteorite recovery missions in the short term. This potential\nrelies mainly on data-driven analysis to identify unexplored meteorite\nstranding zones and mapping areas exposing blue ice where meteorites are often\nfound.\n\n1 / 3\n\nAntarctic meteorite (HUT 18036) partially in the ice, in contrast to most\nsamples that are collected while lying on the surface.

As this heat transfers from the meteorites to the ice, it\ncan warm up the ice, and eventually cause the ice to locally melt, leading to\na sinking of meteorites underneath the surface of the ice sheet. Once the\nmeteorites enter the ice sheet, even at shallow depths, they cannot be\ndetected anymore, and they are thus lost for science.\n\nAs atmospheric temperatures increase, so does the surface temperature of the\nice, intensifying the loss. \"Even when temperatures of the ice are well below\nzero, the dark meteorites warm-up so much in the sun that they can melt the\nice directly beneath the meteorite. Through this process, the warm meteorite\ncreates a local depression in the ice and over time fully disappears under the\nsurface,\u201d says Tollenaar.\n\nScientists conclude that in the long-term, the only way to preserve most of\nthe remaining unrecovered Antarctic meteorites is to rapidly reduce greenhouse\ngas emissions.\n\nBy playing the video you accept the privacy policy of YouTube.Learn more OK\n\nAn exceptionally large meteorite found on the Nansen blue ice area, close to\nthe Belgian Antarctic research station Princess Elisabeth.
