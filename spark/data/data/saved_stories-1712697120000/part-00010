It is almost impossible to keep\nup with everything. That is the reason why I love to curate my own feeds. I am\na huge fan of RSS, and I love to create a personal backlog of blog posts and\narticles I would like to read and consume. To do that, I am using a couple of\napps which make reading online a joy. For the longest time, Reeder by Silvio\nRizzi has been my preferred RSS reader. I use it mostly to stay up to date\nwith news and tech blogs. Besides that, a couple months ago, I started using\nReadwise Reader to keep up with personal blogs of people I admire, and\nindependent and insightful media and online magazines. The fact that Readwise\nReader directly integrates with Readwise and therefore resurfaces the\nhighlights I took from the articles I read and sends them to my email inbox in\na neat newsletter every single day, got me even more attracted to the app.\n\nFor the past couple of weeks, a third app found its spot on my iPhone and Mac,\nand became part of my reading flow. The app I am talking about and devoting\nthis deep dive to is called Flyleaf. Flyleaf is an app designed and built by\nMax Melzer, a theologian and software developer from Germany. As a quick\nsummary, you can say that Flyleaf is a fully native read-it-later app for\niPhone, iPad, and macOS, that gives you the possibility to sync your articles\nacross all your devices through iCloud, features a lovely design and great\ntypography with loads of customization options, does not need an account, and\nthere are no ads or tracking involved. To further understand what sets Flyleaf\napart from other read-it-later apps, read on.\n\nWhenever I read an article within one of the read-it-later or RSS apps I used\nin the past, something felt off, however I was never able to pinpoint what\nexactly gave me that kind of feeling, until I tried out Flyleaf.\n\nNo matter which read-it-later app you are currently using, chances are high\nthat whenever you read an article or blog post, you will find yourself\nscrolling from top to bottom, and vice-versa when you are revisiting a\nspecific paragraph or section. While those apps provide interfaces which are\noptimized for a nice reading experience, i.e. specific type settings, better\ncolor themes, removing any kind of distractions, the biggest drawback is the\nfact that there is the need to scroll, well the scrolling part itself might\nnot be the actual drawback, but whenever you stop reading and want to get back\nwhere you left, you have to scroll to find the paragraph to continue reading\nthe article. Depending on the length of the article you have been reading,\nthis can become quite tedious.\n\nIn Flyleaf, reading feels exciting. And you can easily continue reading where\nyou left. The reason for that is a feature that makes Flyleaf unique\n(personally I have never seen it in any other read-it-later app), distinguish\nit from other reading apps, and delivers a lovely reading experience. Instead\nof scrolling vertically to read articles, Flyleaf implemented book-style\npagination, which means you can read articles page by page. No matter if you\nare reading on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, the pagination interaction in\ncombination with a lovely interface makes Flyleaf an incredible beautiful\nread-it-later app.\n\nSpeaking of the interface, it is a great blend of components and UI elements\nthat feel Apple native and have a more customized touch. I love that. For the\nlongest time, I felt like fully natively designed apps look to similar,\ntherefore, Flyleaf's interface delivers some fresh air. The floating tab bar\non the iOS and iPadOS version immediately stands out, in a very positive way.\nIt gives you access to the articles you have saved, archived, favorited, and\nthe one you have tagged (which is a paid feature).\n\nThe reading experience feels great. For the full distraction-free experience,\nyou can hide away the left sidebar (on the iPadOS and macOS versions), which\ndisplays your articles, to only put the article you are currently reading in\nfocus. With a single tap or click, you can then get access to a little popover\ncomponent to peek into your reading list if you want to switch to another\narticle. Within the reading view you are able to quickly favorite the article,\narchive it if you are done, open it in your browser, share it with others, tag\nit, or customize the overall reading interface by changing the theme (you can\nchoose between black and gray for dark mode and white for light mode for the\nfree version, the paid version of Fyleaf gives you access to six additional\nthemes for both, light and dark mode), the font (you can choose from a set of\n13 serif and sans-serif fonts), the font size, the line-height, and you can\nturn on or off the book-style pagination, the darkening of bright images in\ndark mode, and hide your mouse over text if it is idle.\n\nFurther customization options give you the possibility to set an accent color\nfor both light and dark mode, choose between a translucent sidebar or a non-\ntranslucent one, change the sorting of your articles within the sidebar, pin\nrecent articles to the top of the sidebar, change the length of the summaries\nof the articles, and further options that you can turn off or on like showing\nthe website icon, the publication name, estimated reading times, assigned\ntags, and reading progress.\n\nChances are high that you are already using a dedicated read-it-later app. So,\nto give Flyleaf a try, you probably want to import your articles. If you are\nusing Instapaper, Later, or GoodLinks, Flyleaf offers dedicated import\nfunctions for those apps, with guides how to export from them first to bring\nover your articles. Besides that, Flyleaf gives you the possibility to export\nall the articles that you have saved within the app.\n\nAll in all, Flyleaf is a delightful read-it-later app which stands out because\nof its book-like pagination feature while reading articles, raising your\nreading experience onto another level. The core functionalities of the app are\nall free, only if you are seeking for more customization options, you need to\nupgrade to Flyleaf's paid version which will cost you either \u20ac2 per month or\n\u20ac18 per year, which is a great deal.\n\nFlyleaf for iPhone, iPad and Mac\n\nRead later app with modern design, iCloud sync and book-style pagination.\n\nMax Melzer\n\nFlyleaf Read Later\n\nFlyleaf is a \u201cread-later\u201d app that displays articles from the web in a\nmeticulously designed reading view, without popups, ads or other distractions.\nYou can add articles from any app that has a share sheet, through a\nbookmarklet, or by manually entering the URL.
