Excitement\nwas obvious in Mexico, several US states, and Canada during the total solar\neclipse that occurred on April 8, 2024. Dubbed the Great North American\nEclipse, millions gathered outdoors to witness the Moon pass between Earth and\nthe Sun, casting darkness over fortunate states. Amidst the typical gesture of\nputting the eclipse glasses on and taking them off, depending on if people\nwere looking at the sky during the total eclipse, or before or after, what\nhappened to Internet traffic?\n\nCloudflare\u2019s data shows a clear impact on Internet traffic from Mexico to\nCanada, following the path of totality. The eclipse occurred between 15:42 UTC\nand 20:52 UTC, moving from south to north, as seen in this NASA image of the\npath and percentage of darkness of the eclipse.\n\nLooking at the United States in aggregate terms, bytes delivered traffic\ndropped by 8%, and request traffic by 12% as compared to the previous week at\n19:00 UTC (14:00 Eastern, 12:00 Pacific).\n\nBytes delivered percentage change (-8% at 19:00 UTC)HTTP requests percentage\nchange (-12% at 19:00 UTC)\n\nThe state-level perspective in terms of traffic drop at the time of the\neclipse, as compared to the previous week, is much more revealing. Here\u2019s a\nsummary of the US states' traffic changes. We can almost trace the path of the\neclipse, as shown in the previous NASA image.\n\nFrom our data, Vermont, Arkansas, Indiana, Maine, New Hampshire, and Ohio\nexperienced traffic drops of 40% or more around the time of the eclipse. These\nstates were all in the path of totality, which was not the case for several\nothers.\n\nIn the next table, we provide a detailed breakdown of the same perspective\nshown on the US map ordered by drop in traffic. In all of these charts, we're\nusing UTC as the time. We include the time of the biggest traffic drop\ncompared to the previous week, at a 5-minute granularity, and also the\npercentage of drop compared to the previous week. States where it was possible\nto see at least part of the total eclipse are highlighted in bold. At the\nbottom are those with no clear difference.\n\nThe US: traffic change at time of the eclipse  \n---  \nState| Time of drop (UTC)| Local time| % of drop  \nVermont| 19:25| 15:25| -60%  \nArkansas| 18:50| 13:50| -54%  \nIndiana| 19:05| 15:05| -50%  \nMaine| 19:30| 15:30| -48%  \nNew Hampshire| 19:20| 15:20| -40%  \nOhio| 19:10| 15:10| -40%  \nKentucky| 19:05| 14:05| -33%  \nMassachusetts| 19:25| 15:25| -33%  \nMichigan| 19:15| 15:15| -32%  \nKansas| 18:50| 13:50| -31%  \nMissouri| 18:55| 13:55| -31%  \nConnecticut| 19:20| 15:20| -29%  \nMaryland| 19:15| 15:15| -29%  \nNew York| 19:25| 15:25| -29%  \nOklahoma| 18:45| 13:45| -29%  \nRhode Island| 19:25| 15:25| -29%  \nNew Jersey| 19:20| 15:20| -28%  \nArizona| 18:15| 11:15| -27%  \nIllinois| 19:05| 14:05| -26%  \nPennsylvania| 19:15| 15:15| -26%  \nWest Virginia| 19:15| 15:15| -24%  \nWisconsin| 19:05| 14:05| -22%  \nWyoming| 18:20| 12:20| -19%  \nAlaska| 20:15| 12:15| -18%  \nDelaware| 19:20| 15:20| -18%  \nDistrict of Columbia| 19:15| 15:15| -16%  \nNew Mexico| 18:25| 12:25| -16%  \nOregon| 18:15| 11:15| -16%  \nNebraska| 18:50| 13:50/12:50| -15%  \nTexas| 18:45| 13:45| -15%  \nColorado| 18:25| 12:25| -14%  \nVirginia| 18:20| 14:20| -14%  \nAlabama| 19:00| 14:00| -13%  \nTennessee| 19:00| 15:00/14:00| -13%  \nIowa| 18:15| 13:15| -12%  \nNevada| 18:10| 11:10| -12%  \nGeorgia| 19:05| 15:05| -11%  \nNorth Carolina| 19:10| 15:10| -10%  \nCalifornia| 18:15| 11:15| -9%  \nFlorida| 18:15| 14:15| -7%  \nUtah| 18:15| 12:15| -5%  \nMontana| 18:25| 12:25| -4%  \nSouth Carolina| 19:00| 15:00| -4%  \nHawaii| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \nLouisiana| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \nMinnesota| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \nMississippi| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \nNorth Dakota| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \nIdaho| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \nSouth Dakota| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \nWashington| \u2014| \u2014| \u2014  \n  \nVisualized, here's what Vermont\u2019s 60% drop looks like:\n\nAnd here's what the traffic drops in Arkansas, Maine, and Indiana look like:\n\nIn terms of states with larger populations, New York took the lead:\n\n## Mexico got the eclipse first\n\nBefore the eclipse became visible in the US, Mexico experienced it first.\nStates within the eclipse zone, such as Coahuila, Durango, and Sinaloa,\nexperienced noticeable drops in traffic. Even Mexico City, located further\nsouth, was affected.\n\nMexico: traffic change at time of the eclipse  \n---  \nState| Time of drop (UTC)| Local time| % of drop  \nDurango| 18:15| 12:15| -57%  \nCoahuila| 18:15| 12:15| -43%  \nSinaloa| 18:10| 11:10| -34%  \nMexico City| 18:10| 12:10| -22%  \n  \nHere\u2019s the Durango and Coahuila state perspectives:\n\n## Canada at last: an island stopped to see the eclipse\n\nAfter Mexico and the US, Canada was next in the path of the eclipse. Prince\nEdward Island experienced the most significant impact in Canada. This region,\nwith a population of less than 200,000, is one of eastern Canada's maritime\nprovinces, situated off New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in the Gulf of St.\nLawrence. Next came New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nCanada: traffic change at time of the eclipse  \n---  \nState| Time of drop (UTC)| Local time| % of drop  \nPrince Edward Island| 19:35| 16:35| -48%  \nNew Brunswick| 19:30| 16:30| -40%  \nNewfoundland and Labrador| 19:40| 16:10| -32%  \nNova Scotia| 19:35| 16:35| -27%  \nQuebec| 19:25| 15:25| -27%  \nOntario| 19:15| 15:15| -21%  \n  \n## Conclusion: Internet is a human\u2019s game\n\nAs we've observed during previous occasions, human and nature-related events\nsignificantly impact Internet traffic. This includes Black Friday/Cyber Week,\nEaster, Ramadan celebrations, the coronation of King Charles III, the recent\nundersea cable failure in Africa, which affected 13 countries, and now, this\ntotal eclipse.\n\nThis was the last total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States\nuntil August 23, 2044, with the next eclipse of similar breadth projected for\nAugust 12, 2045.\n\nFor this and other trends, visit Cloudflare Radar and follow us on social\nmedia at @CloudflareRadar (X), cloudflare.social/@radar (Mastodon), and\nradar.cloudflare.com (Bluesky).\n\nWe protect entire corporate networks, help customers build Internet-scale\napplications efficiently, accelerate any website or Internet application, ward\noff DDoS attacks, keep hackers at bay, and can help you on your journey to\nZero Trust.\n\nVisit 1.1.1.1 from any device to get started with our free app that makes your\nInternet faster and safer.\n\nTo learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, start here.\nIf you're looking for a new career direction, check out our open positions.\n\nDiscuss on Hacker News\n\nCloudflare RadarTrendsInternet Traffic\n\nFollow on X\n\nJo\u00e3o Tom\u00e9|@emot\n\nCloudflare|@cloudflare\n\nRelated posts\n\nMarch 26, 2024 1:00 PM\n\n## From .com to .beauty: The evolving threat landscape of unwanted email\n\nIn this 2023-early 2024 email analysis, we examine how certain generic Top-\nLevel Domains (TLDs) are primarily used for spam and phishing, and their\nevolution over a year.
