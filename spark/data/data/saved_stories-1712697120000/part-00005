First introduced\nby journalistic websites that were suffering from the loss of advertising\nrevenue to big tech platforms, Meta adopted the approach for Instagram and\nFacebook in November 2023. In this video, we explain what this is all about\nand why this approach is dangerous for free consent online.\n\nIn November 2023, Meta introduced a paid subscription for Instagram and\nFacebook users who don't want to be tracked. The move came in response to a\nCourt of Justice (CJEU) ruling in July 2023, which declared Meta's handling of\nuser data illegal. Now, instead of asking users for their consent, the company\nis forcing them to either pay a fee of up to \u20ac 251.88 a year or agree to be\ntracked for targeted advertising.\n\nIn reality, most people have no choice but to accept the use of their data\nwhen faced with such a fee, even though the vast majority have no interest in\nbeing tracked. This is a major issue.\n\nAs this video is being recorded, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) is\nworking on a binding opinion on 'Pay or Consent', which will determine whether\nEuropeans continue to have a realistic option to protect their privacy online.\nIf the approach is legitimised for Meta, companies across all industries could\nfollow suit - which would mark the end of genuine consent to the use of\nEuropean's data.\n\nIn the video below, Max Schrems of noyb explains what is at stake:\n\n## Share\n\n## Related articles\n\n  * 19.03.2024\n\nForced Consent & Consent Bypass\n\n### \"Pay or Okay\": 1,500 \u20ac a year for your online privacy?\n\nShould \u201cPay or Okay\u201d be legitimised for Meta, companies across all industries\ncould follow its lead.
