Today we've proven\nthat metric and we're announcing the General Availability of the platform that\nwill service the next 99 million.\n\nWe've been production-ready for years now. We kept the \u201cbeta\u201d label because we\nwanted to make sure that our organization can support all types of customers,\nno matter their demands.\n\nToday we're confident in our ability to take any profile of customer and help\nthem become successful. We have a crew of amazing Postgres engineers and\nsupport staff who work tirelessly to educate customers with Postgres\ntechnicalities, improving our product simultaneously.\n\nWhether you're an indie hacker or a Fortune 500, Supabase can scale\ncomfortably for your production workload. Rocket ships like Udio, Krea,\nHumata, and Pika use Supabase to build fast and scale faster. Enterprise\ncustomers such as Mozilla, PWC, Johnson & Johnson, and 1Password use Supabase\nto manage their applications securely. 30% of the last Y Combinator batch used\nSupabase to launch their start ups.\n\n> Supabase has been great to develop applications. As a firm focused on\n> security, we've been happy to work with Row Level Security Policies to\n> secure database operations.\n\n  * Matthieu, Tech Lead. PWC France\n\n## Open Source & Community\n\n02\n\nOur community is the driving force behind the development and adoption of\nSupabase.\n\nThe GitHub community is the foundation of our company: submitting feature\nrequests, discovering bugs, creating PRs, and pushing our team to develop a\nuseful product.\n\nWe're committed to our licenses - all of our public repos have OSI-compliant\nlicenses. We have no plans to change this.\n\nSelf-hosting is easier than ever. You can get started in less than 5 minutes\non a hosted VPS.\n\nWe're committed to our free tier - we know the importance of this for testing\nhobby projects and prototyping. Almost all of the largest databases on\nSupabase today started on the free tier, a clear indication that our free tier\nis important for building an enduring platform.\n\n## 65,000\n\nGitHub stars\n\n## 106,000\n\nTwitter followers\n\n## 25,000\n\nDiscord members\n\n## 23,000\n\nYouTube subscribers\n\n## 10,000\n\nReddit subs\n\n## Build in a weekend, scale to millions\n\n03\n\nOur tagline is \u201cBuild in a weekend, scale to millions\u201d. This isn't hyperbole.\nIn the past, reaching 1 million users was an incredible challenge. It took\nInstagram 2.5 months, Facebook 10 months, and Twitter 24 months.\n\nIn the past year, we've had 12 companies start on Supabase and grow from zero\nto over 1 million users.\n\nMost of these were AI companies, like Udio, Krea, Humata, Chatbase, Pika,\nQuivr, Mendable, Markprompt and MDN search by Mozilla.\n\nPostgres has been instrumental in our scalability and adoption. It's\nversatility is best demonstrated by pgvector: we were the fist cloud provider\nto offer it, and today 15% of all new Supabase projects use pgvector for AI\nand ML workloads. Look out for a few related announcements this week.\n\n## Enterprise\n\n04\n\nSupabase can now scale comfortably to any workload. Companies such as\n1Password, PWC, & Johnson & Johnson use Supabase to build Postgres-backed\napplications.\n\nWe've spent years working with larger organizations to meet their requirements\nfor running Supabase in production. This includes enhanced security tooling,\nindustry best-practices (SOC2 and HIPAA), round the clock support, and SLAs.\n\nThis week we've added support for Supabase in the AWS Marketplace. Enterprise\ncustomers can now purchase Supabase as part of their committed AWS spend.\n\nWe'll continue to expand the Supabase Enterprise offering to include more\ndeployment options, including \"Bring your own cloud\". If you're interested in\nusing Supabase in your organization, get in touch via the Supabase for\nEnterprise form.\n\nSOC 2\n\nHIPAA\n\nData Encryption\n\nRole-based access control\n\nBackups\n\nDDoS Protection\n\n## Our partners\n\n05\n\nThe Supabase community doesn't exist in isolation. It's part of a group of\ndeveloper focused companies and communities who are constantly pushing the\nboundaries of developer experience and developer productivity.\n\nWe've teamed up with Fly to bring Postgres to developers across the world.\n(More on this later this week).\n\nVercel users can use the Supabase integration to connect Supabase to their\nNext.js projects, and we have deep integrations with Flutterflow, Resend, and\nTwilio.\n\nCloudflare recently announced the Supabase integration for Workers and\nHyperdrive.\n\nDevelopers have different preferences on how to connect to their database, and\nSupabase is \"just Postgres\" you can connect natively with Prisma, Drizzle, or\nKysely.\n\nYou can find the full list of partners and integrations on our Partners page.\nIf you're interested in partnering with Supabase head over to the Partner\nPortal.\n\n## What's new?\n\n06\n\nIn addition to General Availability, we also have several other major\nannouncements to make today.\n\n  * The Supabase Index Advisor is now available inside Supabase Studio. As its name suggests, this will analyze your database and make recommendations to add or remove table indexes. This is just the beginning of our plan to make automated data analysis tooling available to all developers.\n\n  * Supabase Branching works like Git branches. You can create and test database changes or try out features in a separate, temporary instance without affecting your production setup. Today Branching enters public availability.\n\n  * Supabase has acquired Oriole. Oriole is a company founded by Postgres Hacker Alexander Korotkov to solve the hairy problems of Postgres.\n\n  * We're constantly on the lookout for ways to remove the friction in getting started with your new projects. Supabase Bootstrap is now the easiest way to get started with Supabase and your favorite development framework.\n\n  * Today Supabase Swift SDK will join supabase-js as an officially supported client library, and supabase-swift maintainer Guilherme Souza will join the Supabase team full time. The goal of Supabase is to become the default backend for all kinds of developers.\n\n## What's next?\n\n07\n\nOne of our key metrics at Supabase is \"Time to Value\". How fast can a user go\nfrom idea to production? We'll never stop pushing on what's possible here.\n\nIt is only the first day of Supabase GA Week. Today's releases are just the\nstart: we have 4 more days of exciting announcements to come. Follow the new\nannouncements here.\n\nIf you want to try Supabase today, we just started an asynchronous hackathon.\nIt's a great way to try out all the new features. Go here to read the rules\nand start hacking.\n\nTogether with the developer community we're looking forward to deploying our\nnext 100 million databases.\n\n## Build in a weekend, scale to millions\n\n## Footer\n\nWe protect your data.More on Security\n\n  * SOC2 Type 2 Certified\n  * HIPAA Compliant\n\nTwitter\n\nGitHub\n\nDiscord\n\nYoutube\n\n###### Product\n\n  * Database\n\n  * Auth\n\n  * Functions\n\n  * Realtime\n\n  * Storage\n\n  * Vector\n\n  * Pricing\n\n  * GA Week\n\n###### Resources\n\n  * Support\n\n  * System Status\n\n  * Become a Partner\n\n  * Integrations\n\n  * Experts\n\n  * Brand Assets / Logos\n\n  * Security and Compliance\n\n  * DPA\n\n  * SOC2\n\n  * HIPAA\n\n###### Developers\n\n  * Documentation\n\n  * Changelog\n\n  * Contributing\n\n  * Open Source\n\n  * SupaSquad\n\n  * DevTo\n\n  * RSS\n\n###### Company\n\n  * Blog\n\n  * Customer Stories\n\n  * Careers\n\n  * Company\n\n  * Terms of Service\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n  * Acceptable Use Policy\n\n  * Support Policy\n\n  * Service Level Agreement\n\n  * Humans.txt\n\n  * Lawyers.txt\n\n  * Security.txt\n\n\u00a9 Supabase Inc\n\nWe only collect analytics essential to ensuring smooth operation of our\nservices.
