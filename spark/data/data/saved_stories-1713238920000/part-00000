Reciprocity, a well-known concept in social science, shows most people\nrespond to a positive action with another positive action. In contrast, poor\nunhappy path design leads to annoyed customers and churn.\n\nTwo recent experiences reminded me of the importance of designing for the\nunhappy path when building products.\n\n####\n\nVinted\u2019s poor unhappy path\n\nVinted is a marketplace for second hand clothes and goods in the United\nKingdom. Sellers post no longer used clothes and buyers snap them up. I\u2019ve\nbeen using Vinted for about 12 months with little complaint - though with a\nfew ideas on how to make posting items easier! Unfortunately, a couple of\nmonths ago a seller sent me the wrong item before a holiday. The seller\nacknowledged their mistake and confirmed a return. Vinted has a time limit to\nreturn items. I missed the timeline and my requests for an extension were not\ngranted.\n\nThe amount in question was small, user error was present, and I am now the\nunproud owner of a Paul Smith graphic t-shirt. I have also stopped using\nVinted. I was too frustrated by the buying experience when the purchase did\nnot proceed as planned.\n\n####\n\nLime Bike\u2019s reciprocity\n\nLime Bikes (or their equivalents) are now as ubiquitous in large global cities\nas ambulance sirens, chic coffee shops, and FOMO. Electric bikes that you can\nrent by the minute. The trouble is, like any mechanical product, they often\nbreak. A flat tyre, a bent wheel, a faulty brake.\n\nWhen a ride has started and a fault then found, you report the issue via\nLime\u2019s app. It would be easy for Lime to withhold any refund until verifying\nthe fault. This is not their approach - at least for the average user. Within\n2-3 clicks, they grant a refund leaving the harried commuter to find the next\nbike and get on their way. This has happened to me many times over the last\nmonth. I reciprocate the ease of refund with remaining a Lime Bike user.\n\nI had a similar experience with Amazon\u2019s Kindle a decade or so ago. After a\nfault within the first month, Amazon sent out a replacement. Whilst they asked\nme to return the faulty Kindle, there was no obligation. I still use that\nKindle today - buying hundreds of books from Amazon in the meantime.\n\n####\n\nProvide unreasonable support\n\nProviding your users with - at least what they feel to be - unreasonable\nlevels of support will pay off in loyalty and retention. It is efficient too.\nThe cost of keeping an existing user loyal is often less than the cost of\nacquiring new customers.\n\nRory Sutherland, the great ad man, has a story of a clothes shop owner who\njangles their keys for an extra minute as they lock up each day. Every so\noften, a customer rushes up and begs the owner to let them in for an urgent\npurchase. The shop owner sighs, smiles and reopens the shop. The result - a\nloyal customer for life.\n\nThanks for reading The Kahneman Bot!
