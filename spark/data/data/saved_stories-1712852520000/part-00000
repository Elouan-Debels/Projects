As general models, they can fulfill a wide range of roles,\n> including those of more specialized models. We assess the performance of\n> GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in zero shot, few shot and fine-tuned settings on the\n> aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task. Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 achieves a\n> state-of-the-art F1 score of 83.8 on the joint aspect term extraction and\n> polarity classification task of the SemEval-2014 Task 4, improving upon\n> InstructABSA [@scaria_instructabsa_2023] by 5.7%. However, this comes at the\n> price of 1000 times more model parameters and thus increased inference cost.\n> We discuss the the cost-performance trade-offs of different models, and\n> analyze the typical errors that they make. Our results also indicate that\n> detailed prompts improve performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings but\n> are not necessary for fine-tuned models. This evidence is relevant for\n> practioners that are faced with the choice of prompt engineering versus\n> fine-tuning when using LLMs for ABSA.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2310.18025 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2310.18025v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.18025arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Paavo Huoviala [view email] [v1] Fri, 27 Oct 2023 10:03:21 UTC (718 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Large language models for aspect-based\nsentiment analysis, by Paul F.
