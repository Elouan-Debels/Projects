Which begs the question: will manual labor soon be performed\nremotely?\n\nA teleoperated humanoid robot allows for the performance of complex tasks that\nare \u2013 at least at this stage \u2013 too complex for a robot to perform\nindependently. But achieving whole-body control of human-sized humanoids to\nreplicate our movements in real-time is a challenging task. That\u2019s where\nreinforcement learning (RL) comes in.\n\nMore Stories\n\nRobotics\n\nThree-legged asteroid-hopping robot passes Zero-G airplane ride test\n\nMilitary\n\nNorthrop Grumman debuts Manta Ray robotic underwater glider\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nRL is a machine-learning technique that mimics humans\u2019 trial-and-error\napproach to learning. Using the reward-and-punishment paradigm of RL, a robot\nwill learn from the feedback of each action they perform and self-discover the\nbest processing paths to achieve the desired outcome. Unlike machine learning,\nRL doesn\u2019t require humans to label data pairs to direct the algorithm.\n\nRemote teleoperated humanoids: example 1\n\n\u201cH2O teleoperation is a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that\nfacilitates the real-time whole-body teleoperation of humanoid robots using\njust an RGB camera,\u201d Tairan He, CMU\u2019s LeCAR (Learning and Control for Agile\nRobotics) Lab and one of the project\u2019s lead researchers, told Tech Xplore.\n\u201cThe process starts by retargeting human motions to humanoid capabilities\nthrough a novel \u2018sim-to-data\u2019 methodology, ensuring the motions are feasible\nfor the humanoid\u2019s physical constraints. This refined motion dataset then\ntrains an RL-based motion imitator in simulation, which is subsequently\ntransferred to the real robot without further adjustment.\u201d\n\nRemote teleoperated humanoids: example 2\n\nUsing this approach, the researchers could leverage images taken by an RGB\ncamera \u2013 one that collects visible light and converts it to a color image\nreplicating normal human vision \u2013 and a 3D pose estimator to enable the\nmotions of human teleoperators to be mimicked by H2O.\n\nRemote teleoperated humanoids: example 3\n\nThe results, seen in videos taken by the researchers, speak for themselves. In\nthem, H2O can be seen kicking a ball, binning a box, sidestepping while in a\nboxing stance, and walking (albeit like an unsteady toddler) with a stroller.\nTo the researchers\u2019 knowledge, this is the first demonstration of real-time\nwhole-body humanoid teleoperation.\n\nRemote teleoperated humanoids: example 4\n\nThe CMU researchers described their approach in a paper posted on the arXiv\npre-print website.\n\nA longer video from the LeCAR Lab at CMU, below, shows off more of H2O\u2019s\ncapabilities, including punching an Amazon box while wearing boxing gloves and\nthen performing a victory salute (I can\u2019t help but wonder if that\u2019s robot\npayback), jumping backwards, and being kicked in the back by a human to\ndemonstrate its robustness.\n\nLearning Human-to-Humanoid Real-Time Whole-Body Teleoperation\n\nFurther research will examine the introduction of inputs other than from the\nhuman teleoperator, such as force feedback and verbal and conversational\nfeedback, which could enhance H2O\u2019s capabilities. And a promising direction\nfor future research is incorporating lower-body tracking to enable the\nhumanoid to perform more skillful human motions like sports and dancing.\n\nThis brings us back to the earlier question: Could H2O, or something like it,\nenable remote labor? CMU's announcement regarding H2O has generated some\nthought-provoking discussion on Reddit\u2019s r/Futurology subreddit.\n\nAn example of the r/Futurology subreddit discussion generated by CMU's H2O\nannouncement\n\nReddit\n\nObviously, using teleoperated humanoids means humans get to keep their jobs (a\npositive). Another plus is employing these humanoids for risky work or search-\nand-rescue missions in remote and/or human-inaccessible regions.\n\nHowever, there are some downsides, the most apparent one being related to\nlabor. As pointed out by Reddit user lughnasadh, \u201c[I]t opens up more avenues\nfor job offshoring in rich countries.\u201d Then there\u2019s the slippery-slope\nargument: Teleoperated robots now, fully autonomous (read: job-stealing)\nrobots later.\n\nInterestingly, a 2022 study to gauge public acceptance of using teleoperated\nrobots to perform labor jobs found that many people are open to remote work\nwith lower pay than onsite roles. Again, it\u2019s one of those \u2018time will tell\u2019\nsituations we\u2019ve become accustomed to in the swiftly advancing AI/robotics\nspace.\n\nSource: CMU, Tech Xplore\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.
