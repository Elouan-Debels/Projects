He referred to gaps between components\nthat emerged during the plane's assembly.\n\nAsked if he would put his own family on one of 787s, he responded: \"Right now,\nI would not.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating Salehpour's claims,\nwhich were first reported last week by the New York Times.\n\nBoeing, one of the world's two major producers of commercial planes, has again\ninsisted its jets are safe, and disputed the engineer's assertions.\n\nIt told NBC: \"These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are\ninaccurate. The issues raised have been subject to rigorous engineering\nexamination under FAA oversight.\"\n\nAt an earlier event on Monday, the company said 99% of gaps conformed to the\nstandard, and that testing showed \"zero fatigue\".\n\nConcerns also have been raised in recent years about the safety of Boeing's\n737 Max jets.\n\nIn January, a 737 Max 9 was forced to return to its point of departure in\nPortland, Oregon, making an emergency landing after a door panel blew out in\nmid-air.\n\nPassengers escaped serious injury, but the incident led to thousands of flight\ncancellations and renewed scrutiny of Boeing - which previously had grounded\nthe 737 Max 8 after deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nSalehpour's allegations were labelled \"deeply serious\" by Democratic Senator\nRichard Blumenthal, who will chair Wednesday's hearing.\n\nOthers expected to testify on Wednesday include a representative of the\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nBoeing representatives will not join them, but the firm says it is co-\noperating with proceedings by offering to provide \"documents, testimony and\ntechnical briefings\".\n\n## Boeing hit after new whistleblower raises concerns\n\n## United Airlines says Boeing blowout cost it $200m\n\nBoeing\n\nAviation safety\n\nAir travel\n\nRelated\n\n## United Airlines says Boeing blowout cost it $200m\n\n3 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Boeing hit after new whistleblower raises concerns\n\n8 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Probe after Boeing plane engine cover falls off\n\n7 Apr 2024\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n1 day ago\n\n## EasyJet suspends flights to Israel until October\n\nThe airline blames the \"evolving situation in Israel\" for stopping journeys to\nTel Aviv\n\n1 day ago\n\n2 days ago\n\n## What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?\n\nIf you face disruption because flights are cancelled or delayed, then what can\nyou do?\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Flights cancelled after Iran's strike on Israel\n\nEasyJet has suspended planes travelling to Tel Aviv until 21 April following\nTehran's attack.\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Could Scots aviation pioneer inspire more women flyers?\n\nWinnie Drinkwater was one of the first female commercial airline pilots \u2013 so\nwhy have so few heard of her?\n\n2 days ago\n\nScotland\n\n5 days ago\n\n## Replica Spitfire unveiled at former WW2 airfield\n\nIt honours two pilots who died in an accident at the site 80 years ago.\n\n5 days ago\n\nTyne\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
