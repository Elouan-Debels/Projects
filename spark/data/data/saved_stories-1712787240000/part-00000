Wrapping up\n\n## Sign up for the Newsletter\n\nOnce a week. Three links. No spam. Unsubscribe anytime.\n\nI\u2019m very pleased to announce the launch of Xmrit.\n\nOver the past eight months, my team at Commoncog have been iterating on a tool\nto rapidly create and share XmR charts. We\u2019ve been using Xmrit operationally\nfor about five months now, and we are very confident that the tool is ready\nfor wide use.\n\n(Xmrit is pronounced \u2018xa-merit\u2019, in case you\u2019re wondering.)\n\nSo, what is it? Xmrit is a free, browser-based tool that makes it easy for you\nto create, modify, experiment with and share XmR charts. Here\u2019s what it looks\nlike:\n\nIf you do not know what XmR charts are, the broad pitch is that XmR charts\ntell you when something has changed in your data. This simple property unlocks\nsomething quite powerful: it allows you to uncover the causal structure of\nyour business. For more information on how you may use XmR charts to\naccomplish this, read Becoming Data Driven, From First Principles.\n\nThere are a number of features that make Xmrit useful. For instance, I can\ngenerate links to quickly share analyses. The following is a chart of\nCommoncog\u2019s Average Session Duration:\n\nYou may play with this chart yourself at this link.\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice that there\u2019s a divider placed in the chart. This is another\nXmrit-only feature. Try dragging the divider around. Observe how Xmrit\u2019s chart\nresponds and recalculates limit lines based on your divider position.\n\nThe divider position that you see in the image above is not accidental: it\ncorresponds to the week where we launched the Commoncog Case Library. Average\nsession duration shifted permanently after we launched. When we discovered\nthis behaviour, we started thinking:\n\n  1. Hmm. Maybe the Case Library is sticky!\n  2. We should probably redesign the Commoncog website to make the library more prominent. If doing so increases average session duration even further, then we have confirmed point (1).\n\nThis is what I mean when I say (quoting statistitican Donald Wheeler): \u201cXmR\ncharts are the beginning of knowledge\u201d. Knowledge is defined as \u2018theories or\nmodels that allow you to better predict the outcomes of your business\nactions.\u2019 We observe an exceptional change in our metrics. We investigate and\ndiscover some causal action. We then take new action to confirm that the\ncausal relationship is true.\n\nRinse and repeat. At this point we\u2019ve had maybe a dozen such insights. We are\n\u2014 as a teammate put it \u2014 slowly uncovering the causal structure of Commoncog\u2019s\ncore business. (\u201cI never thought we would be able to understand how a business\ntruly works\u201d one of them said, during one of our WBRs). We\u2019ve already doubled\nrevenue over the past year, as a result of such knowledge. I am quietly\nconfident that we can do the same this year (and perhaps even surpass that\ntarget; it depends on what other pieces of knowledge we uncover in the coming\nweeks).\n\nAnd now \u2014 with Xmrit \u2014 you can do the same.\n\nThere are a few more features that make Xmrit special:\n\n  * You can integrate with it by programmatically creating share links: read this guide for more details. This is, incidentally, how we integrate with our own internal WBR software.\n  * You can lock limit lines. Read this section of the User Manual for why you might want to do this.\n  * We\u2019re going to open source it in a few days. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable plugging your company data into Xmrit, wait a few more days. Xmrit was always intended to be open sourced. If you\u2019d like an update, I recommend signing up for the free email course on Xmrit.com. That puts you on our mailing list. We\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s out.\n\nAnd on that note ...\n\n## Sign up for Xmrit\u2019s Free Email Course!\n\nSam Taylor is my collaborator on Xmrit. In a previous life, Sam worked in\nmanufacturing. He has been very influential on my thinking about industrial\nmethods and industrial business models. Over the past month, we\u2019ve been hard\nat work at writing up a free email course over at Xmrit.com to introduce you\nto these methods.\n\nI\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. This is over 10,000 words of\nteaching, spread over nine days, and I think it\u2019s pretty good stuff. It\u2019s very\nmuch what I wish I had when I first encountered these methods.\n\nAnd so! To reiterate: if you\u2019re interested in using XmR charts in your\ncompany, you should sign up for the free email course.\n\nIn a couple of months, we\u2019ll be launching a paid course called The Metrics\nMasterclass \u2014 which covers everything you\u2019ll need to know about using XmR\ncharts in practice.\n\nComing later this year.\n\nSam and I intend to turn Xmrit.com into the world\u2019s best place to learn about\nthese \u2014 and other \u2014 methods. (And, if you can believe it, Sam is even more\npassionate about these tools than I am!)\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t need to buy multiple books and read a dozen statistical papers,\nor do 1.5 years of trial and error to figure out how to use these charts\noutside of manufacturing. (Which, ahem, is what we\u2019ve done). The method is so\nsimple and so useful that you should be able to use it today. The good news is\nthat we\u2019ve already done the hard work for you.\n\nThe Metrics Masterclass will be $299 at launch. At preorder, it costs $199.\nAnd if you go through the free email course on Xmrit.com, you\u2019ll get an\nadditional discount at the end.\n\nWe hope that over the next few years, using our free tools, some simple\nmethods, and much education \u2014 both free and paid \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to increase\nthe number of data-driven companies that exist in the world.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nI\u2019d like to thank a number of people for working on Xmrit with me. Aw Hang Bin\nwrote the first version of Xmrit during an internship he did with us last\nyear. Sam Taylor, of course, tested and shaped the Xmrit tool for a huge chunk\nof the life of the project. Ben rewrote the tool, and thought up and created\nthe integration for Xmrit \u2014 which led us to learn that we didn\u2019t have a good\nsense of routine variation in our metrics. I\u2019d also like to thank the rest of\nthe Commoncog team who have been testing Xmrit in their own work contexts.\n\nCommoncog members received early access to Xmrit a few weeks ago, so this\nisn\u2019t news to them. And hopefully they\u2019ve already started experimenting with\nit!\n\nIf I could say one last thing:\n\nI hope that you\u2019ll take these ideas seriously. Go on, give it a try. The point\nof writing all these essays, of testing these ideas in practice, and now \u2014 of\nbuilding free tools that we release to the world \u2014 is so that you can use\nthem. As I joke to my friends, crudely: \u201cthe goal is not to talk; it is to use\nthese methods and get rich!\u201d\n\nI look forward to hearing how it\u2019s turned out.\n\nPS: Sam and I were on the Monday Morning Data Chat to talk about Xmrit and\nabout Statistical Process Control.
