Regulation works.\n\nLately you can\u2019t throw a digital camera without hitting a story on the various\nregulatory and legal challenges Apple\u2019s been facing. While some have decried\nthese actions as interference in the internal operations of a company, there\u2019s\none salient detail that I think those opinions often overlook.\n\nRegulation works.\n\nHere are just a handful of examples from the past few months of Apple changing\nits policies due to regulations\u2014or, in some cases, the mere threat of\nregulation:\n\n  * In January, Apple announced that it would now allow developers of game streaming apps to submit a single app containing the entire game catalog. That had previously been a sticking point for Microsoft bringing Xbox Game Pass to the platform in 2020\u2014and, as we later found out, was one of the areas of concern in the antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice just a couple months later.\n  * Late last week, Apple changed another of its longstanding App Store rules by allowing \u201cretro game console emulator apps\u201d. Interestingly, one of the only other announced third-party marketplaces coming to the EU is AltStore, the marquee title in which will be Delta, a Nintendo emulator developed by AltStore proprietor Riley Testut.\n\n  * Just today, Apple announced that it would it relax rules around used parts for repairing iPhones. Apple\u2019s Self Service Repair program, which was put into place to comply with Right to Repair legislation passed in some states, launched in 2021. But critics pointed out that Apple\u2019s initial foray still required a restrictive \u201cparts pairing\u201d process that made third-party repairs more limited and more expensive, and Oregon recently made a law that bans the approach. Today\u2019s change effectively undoes that process, though it does still include provisions to prevent stolen parts from being used.\n\nNone of this even takes into account the massive changes made to iOS as the\nresult of the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which may already be resulting in\nconsumer changes.\n\nApple is unquestionably a behemoth in the technology industry, one of a\nhandful that domiante our lives. And while there are places that those\ncompanies butt up against each other and compete, it\u2019s also apparent that\ncorporations of this size are not subject to the same degrees of competition\nthat much smaller players might be. Their core businesses are relatively\nstable, even if they skirmish around the edges: Apple and Amazon can, for\nexample, squabble over the (relatively small) market of smart home speakers,\nbut Apple\u2019s no more likely to come up with a killer retail site that unseats\nAmazon than Amazon is to make a world-class smartphone.\n\n^1\n\nMore to the point, these handful of tech companies are so large that the\nchances of being upset, or even threatened, by small upstarts is vanishingly\nsmall. (And in the rare cases where it might happen, it\u2019s a simple matter for\nthe large companies to simply acquire the smaller ones.)\n\nThat means the only entities powerful enough to impose any sort of pushback\nagainst the companies are government bodies.\n\n^2 Apple details this in its annual 10-K filing, which lays out risk factors\nto the company\u2019s business. One entire heading in that section is \u201cLegal and\nRegulatory Compliance Risks\u201d, which includes the follow sub-heading:\n\n> The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations\n> worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\n> costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe simple fact is that, without some sort of threat, Apple was never going to\nchange any of its business practices, because there was absolutely no reason\nto do so. Apple would happily have never offered a self-service repair program\nor allowed emulators or changed its policies about game streaming\u2014we know\nbecause there were literally years of people asking for these changes without\nthe company lifting a finger\u2014until governments got involved.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Apple, either. Broadband companies weren\u2019t about to start giving\ncustomers clearer and more accessible information about their plans without\nregulatory intervention from the FCC.\n\nThe absence of meaningful challenges breeds complacency. And complacency leads\nto the temptation to collect increasing revenue without corresponding\ninnovation because, well, it sure is a lot easier, isn\u2019t?\n\nMuch as some might pooh-pooh government intervention in the market, these\nregulatory and legal threats are ultimately efficacious because Apple ended up\nchanging its behavior. In some cases, it may take months or years for the\nimpacts on the consumer to be felt\u2014and, in some cases, as detractors point\nout, it may not happen at all if users decide they don\u2019t want these\ncapabilities or alternatives. And you know what? That\u2019s totally fine\u2014because\nthen it\u2019s users choosing to stick with the status quo, as opposed to having no\nother option than the one that they\u2019re given.\n\n  1. \ud83d\udd25 \u21a9\n  2. There are still other external risk factors that affect everybody, of course, like foreign exchange rates and, say, pandemics. \u21a9\n\n[Dan Moren is the East Coast Bureau Chief of Six Colors.
