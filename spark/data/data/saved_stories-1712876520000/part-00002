Fast forward to today, it\u2019s settled into a very mature leader,\nwith slow growth but impressive efficiency ... at a stunning $2.4 Billion in\nARR.\n\nOperating Margins are a wildly impressive 33%, but revenue growth has slowed\nto a very mature 6%, and paid customer count actually dropped last quarter.\nAdded together, it does equal \u201cThe Rule of 40\u201d. But Wall Street doesn\u2019t just\nwant profitability. It wants efficient growth. And as a result, DropBox\u2019s\nmarket cap is $7.8 Billion today.\n\nIt trades at just 3x ARR. And that includes $1.4B in cash. Net of cash, it\ntrades at just over 2x ARR.\n\nProfitability matters, but it isn\u2019t everything.\n\n5 Interesting Learnings:\n\n### #1. 18,000,000 Paying Customers (!), Up 2% Year over Year \u2014 But Paying\nCustomers Shrank This Quarter\n\nDropBox has a big business push, but in many ways at this scale, it\u2019s as much\na consumer company as a business software company. HubSpot has 200,000 paying\ncustomers. DropBox has almost 10x as many \u2014 albeit they pay 1/10th as much at\njust $139.38 a year. But it\u2019s just about saturated the market. New customers\ndid grow 2% year over year, but actually decreased last quarter for the first\ntime.\n\n### #2. ARPU Up 4% at $139.38\n\nMany in SaaS have found a way to drive their ACV and ARPU up over the past\n18-24 months with price increases, more products, and more. But DropBox\u2019s ARPU\nhas stayed relatively flat the past few years. Still, at this maturity, even a\nmodest increasing in ARPU makes a difference, and pricing is up 4%. Combine\nthat with only 2% customer growth, and overall revenue growth is (just) 6%\n\n### #3. Seat Contraction and Churn Remains Elevated\n\nDropBox is still seeing elevated levels of customers reducing seat count and\nelevated churn.\n\n### #4. Ending Unlimited Storage\n\nThis seems to be a theme with many mature SaaS leaders, as they meter what\nthey used to allow unlimited use of. While DropBox cites abuse as a core\nreason, financial engineering appears to be the core driver given how high\nDropBox\u2019s gross margins are. These high-usage, low ARPU customers do appear to\nbe churning based on cutting back on unlimited storage, leading to the\ndecrease customer count above, for now.\n\n### #5. MultiProduct Bundles Didn\u2019t Incent Customers to Pay More\n\nA big theme for the leaders in SaaS the past few years has been going\nmultiproduct to continue to fuel growth at scale. So far, it\u2019s only been a\npartial succcess for DropBox, which in many ways is still a one core product\nplus extension company vs. true multi-product. They attempt to drive up\npricing and ARPU by bundling multiple product, but customers weren\u2019t willing\nto pay a higher effective price. At least not yet.\n\nAnd a few other interesting learnings:\n\n### #6. Paying $79 million to get out of their SF lease, but expecting to save\n$220m over the full term.\n\nWe\u2019re all still figuring out the distributed and hybrid world!\n\n### #7. On Track for Almost $1 Billion in Free Cash Flow in Fiscal 2024\n\nYes, SaaS models can. be highly profitable at scale. They should be.\n\nDropBox is a fascinating case study of incredible, viral product-market fit\nthat fueled a rocketship engine to the first $1B in ARR. But then growth\nslowed as it became, in many ways, just a single-product company. As they\nacknowledge below, they are still early into their second act. Getting this\ntiming and shift right is tough, but critical, as you cross 10%+ market share\nin your first core product and market.\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * The $1 Billion+ ARR Club\n\n  * 5 Interesting Learnings from Box at $1 Billion in ARR\n\n  * 5 Interesting Learnings from Databricks at $1.5 Billion in ARR\n\nJason Lemkin\n\nFounder SaaStr\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * The $1 Billion+ ARR Club\n\n  * 5 Interesting Learnings from Box at $1 Billion in ARR\n\n  * 5 Interesting Learnings from Databricks at $1.5 Billion in ARR\n\n#### Get The Best SaaS Advice\n\nGet fresh insights, articles, and SaaS events delivered right to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n#### <img class=\"rss-widget-icon\" style=\"border:0\" width=\"14\" height=\"14\"\nsrc=\"https://www.saastr.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png\" alt=\"RSS\" /> Industry\nNews\n\n  * Checkr, the background-screening platform last valued at $5 billion, cuts 32% of workforce\n  * Guesty raises $130 million at $900 million valuation, eyeing IPO in 2025\n  * Klaviyo Gains In Mid-Market As Customers Consolidate Vendors\n  * CRO Confidential: How to Sell in a Hyper-Competitive Space with Apollo CRO Leandra Fishman\n  * 6 Tips to Optimize Short Term Rental Cleaning Operations - Operto\n  * Blackbird nets $800m payday from Canva share sale\n  * AI data security startup Cyera confirms $300M raise at a $1.4B valuation\n  * Model N to be Acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1.25 Billion\n  * Sydney start-up Honey Insurance lands blockbuster $108m US investment\n  * Thoma Bravo Targets $20 Billion for Next Buyout Fund\n\n## Subscribe to the SaaStr Newsletter\n\nGet from $0 to $100 Million in ARR with less stress and more success.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n#### Resources\n\nQ&A\n\nBlog\n\nVideos\n\nPodcasts\n\nAcademy\n\nEbooks\n\n#### Events\n\nSaaStr Annual\n\nSaaStr Summit\n\nSaaStr Europa\n\nSaaStr Scale\n\n#### About Us\n\nSaaStr Fund\n\nCompany\n\nContact Us\n\nSitemap\n\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\n[caldera_form_modal type=\"button\" id=\"\" width=\"600\"]\n\n### Pin It on Pinterest\n\nShare This\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * Buffer\n\n  * Gmail\n\n\u00d7\n\nWe Value Your Privacy\n\nSettings\n\nNextRoll, Inc.
