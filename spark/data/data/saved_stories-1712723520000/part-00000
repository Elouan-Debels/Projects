Do His Claims Add Up?\n\nZen Goziker worked at TikTok for only six months. Many of his allegations\nabout the company and the US government are improbable. But he still may have\nshaped how the app is viewed in Washington.\n\nPhoto-illustration: Jacqui VanLiew; Getty Images\n\nThe United States government is currently poised to outlaw TikTok. Little of\nthe evidence that convinced Congress the app may be a national security threat\nhas been shared publicly, in some cases because it remains classified. But one\nformer TikTok employee turned whistleblower, who claims to have driven key\nnews reporting and congressional concerns about the app, has now come forward.\n\nZen Goziker worked at TikTok as a risk manager, a role that involved\nprotecting the company from external security and reputational threats. In a\nwrongful termination lawsuit filed against TikTok's parent company ByteDance\nin January, he alleges he was fired in February 2022 for refusing \u201cto sign\noff\u201d on Project Texas, a $1.5 billion program that TikTok designed to assuage\nUS government security concerns by storing American data on servers managed by\nOracle.\n\nGoziker worked at TikTok for only six months. He didn\u2019t hold a senior position\ninside the company. His lawsuit, and a second one he filed in March against\nseveral US government agencies, makes a number of improbable claims. He\nasserts that he was put under 24-hour surveillance by TikTok and the FBI while\nworking remotely in Mexico. He claims that US attorney general Merrick\nGarland, director of national intelligence Avril Haines, and other top\nofficials \u201cwickedly instigated\u201d his firing. And he states that the FBI helped\nthe CIA share his private information with foreign governments. The suits do\nnot appear to include evidence for any of these claims.\n\nFeatured Video\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is full of outrageous claims that lack merit and comes from an\nindividual who significantly exaggerates his role with a company he worked at\nfor merely six months,\u201d TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a\nstatement.\n\nYet court records and emails viewed by WIRED suggest that when Goziker raised\nthe alarm about his ex-employer\u2019s links to China, he found a ready audience.\nAfter he was fired, Goziker says he began meeting with elected officials, law\nenforcement agencies, and journalists to allege that, court documents say, he\nhad discovered proof that TikTok\u2019s software could send US data to Toutiao, a\nByteDance app in China. That claim directly conflicted with TikTok executives\u2019\nassertions that the two companies operated separately.\n\nGoziker says in court filings that what he saw made it necessary to reassess\nProject Texas. He also alleges that his account of the internal connection to\nChina formed the basis of an influential Washington Post story published in\nMarch last year, which said the concerns came from \u201ca former risk manager at\nTikTok.\u201d\n\nTikTok officials were quoted in that article as saying the allegations were\n\u201cunfounded,\u201d and that the employee had discovered \u201cnothing more than a naming\nconvention and technical relic.\u201d The Washington Post said it does not comment\non sourcing.\n\n\u201cI am free, I am honest, and I am doing this only because I am an American and\nbecause USA desperately need help and I cannot keep this truth away from\nPUBLIC,\u201d Goziker said in an email to WIRED.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nWatch the Total Solar Eclipse Online Here\n\nReece Rogers\n\n  * Politics\n\nThe Solar Eclipse Is the Super Bowl for Conspiracists\n\nDavid Gilbert\n\n  * Business\n\nHow I Became a Python Programmer\u2014and Fell Out of Love With the Machine\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Security\n\nA Vigilante Hacker Took Down North Korea\u2019s Internet. Now He\u2019s Taking Off His\nMask\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nHis March lawsuit alleging US officials conspired with TikTok to have him\nfired was filed against Garland, Haines, Secretary of Homeland Security\nAlejandro Mayorkas, and the agencies they work for.\n\n\u201cGoziker's main point is that the executives in the American company TikTok\nInc. and certain executives from the American federal government have colluded\nto organize a fraud scheme,\u201d Sean Jiang, Goziker\u2019s lawyer in the case against\nthe US government, told WIRED in an email. The lawsuits do not appear to\ncontain evidence of such a scheme. The Department of Homeland Security and\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to requests\nfor comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nJiang calls the House\u2019s recent passage of a bill that could force ByteDance to\nsell off TikTok \u201cproblematic,\u201d because it \u201cblames ByteDance instead of TikTok\nInc for the wrongdoings of the American executives.\u201d He says Goziker would\nprefer to see TikTok subjected to audits and a new corporate structure.\n\nGoziker shared records with WIRED showing that as he sought to share his\nconcerns about TikTok, he scheduled meetings with officials from the DHS, FBI,\nand the Tennessee Attorney General\u2019s office. He also purported to have met\nwith staff in the offices of several US senators, including Missouri\nRepublican Josh Hawley, Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, and Virginia Democrat\nMark Warner, who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nHawley and Warner each introduced separate legislation last year that would\nhave allowed the US government to ban TikTok, and all three senators have\nvoiced support for the more recent TikTok bill that already passed the House.\n(Hawley has expressed skepticism that it would get through the Senate.)\nRepresentatives for the senators did not respond to requests for comment about\nwhether their staff have met with Goziker. The FBI declined to comment and a\nrepresentative for the Tennessee Attorney General did not respond to a request\nfor comment.\n\nJeremy Daum, a scholar at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School, says\nhe wasn\u2019t surprised that US authorities may have been willing to engage with\nGoziker. Lawmakers have grown increasingly worried about threats from China\ndespite a lack of clear evidence that TikTok poses a unique security threat\ncompared to other internet platforms. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly easy to get people\nto focus on China these days,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a smoking gun about\nTikTok.\u201d\n\nGoziker, who has sometimes used the first name Gene instead of Zen, started\nworking as a risk manager at TikTok in August of 2021, reporting to the senior\ndirector of operations. Goziker says in court filings that he joined TikTok\nfrom the National Bank of Pakistan, where he worked as a senior vice president\nin charge of enterprise risk management for its Americas\u2019 operations. In court\nfilings, he says that he was born in Ukraine in 1978 and started his career at\nCitibank after receiving a graduate degree from the London School of Economics\nand Political Science in 2006.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nWatch the Total Solar Eclipse Online Here\n\nReece Rogers\n\n  * Politics\n\nThe Solar Eclipse Is the Super Bowl for Conspiracists\n\nDavid Gilbert\n\n  * Business\n\nHow I Became a Python Programmer\u2014and Fell Out of Love With the Machine\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Security\n\nA Vigilante Hacker Took Down North Korea\u2019s Internet. Now He\u2019s Taking Off His\nMask\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nDespite not holding a senior position, Goziker claims that his main job at\nTikTok was \u201coverseeing\u201d Project Texas to ensure the social media app\u2019s plan to\nsecure US user data would be effective. The goal was to implement a set of\nsafeguards that would satisfy the Committee on Foreign Investment in the\nUnited States, an interagency body charged with evaluating national security\nrisks associated with foreign firms acquiring or taking major stakes in US\ncompanies. CFIUS has the power to force companies to unwind deals it considers\nrisky, and since 2019 has been investigating ByteDance\u2019s 2017 purchase of a\nlip-syncing app called Musical.ly, which was later merged into TikTok.\n\nGoziker claims that he interviewed more than three dozen people at TikTok and\nByteDance about Project Texas, according to court filings. He says that he\nidentified flaws in the initiative that led him to refuse to \u201csign off\u201d on it,\ndespite alleged pressure from his manager and other executives at the company.\nGoziker tried to flag his concerns to TikTok\u2019s top leadership, including the\nCEO and board of directors, according to court records.\n\nGoziker alleges in court filings that he found evidence TikTok\u2019s software\ncould send data to China in January of 2022\u2014weeks before he was fired. He\nclaims in the filings that through \u201ccollaborative and willful joint effort\nwith ByteDance engineers from mainland China,\u201d he obtained \u201ca verified\nartifact\u201d in TikTok\u2019s software that connected the platform to Toutiao, a\npopular Chinese news aggregation app also owned by ByteDance. Goziker said\nthat his findings demonstrated US data from TikTok could still flow to the\nPeople\u2019s Republic, despite TikTok\u2019s assertions to the contrary. The filings do\nnot contain detailed documentary evidence of his allegations.\n\nIn March last year, two weeks after Goziker's claims appeared in The\nWashington Post, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared before Congress and got a\ngrilling about his app's links to China. Afterward, US representatives Jan\nSchakowsky, a Democrat, and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, each sent\nquestions to TikTok about the claims aired in the Post story.\n\nTikTok responded by saying that many of the allegations in the article were\nunfounded. It stated that the reference to Toutiao in TikTok\u2019s code \u201cdoes not\nin any way indicate a correlation between, integration of, or network\nconnectivity between Toutiao and TikTok,\u201d adding that the \u201cToutiao news\napplication cannot interfere with TikTok data flows once Project Texas is\ncomplete.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuits and an email record reviewed by WIRED, Goziker revealed that\nhe had also been in touch with a Forbes journalist who has written a number of\ninfluential stories about TikTok\u2019s data security practices and links to\nByteDance. In June of 2022, when the journalist worked at BuzzFeed News, they\npublished an article based on 80 internal meetings at TikTok in which nine\ndifferent employees reportedly made statements \u201cindicating that engineers in\nChina had access to US data between September 2021 and January 2022.\u201d\n\nGoziker asserted to WIRED that he was the source of the recordings. Forbes\ntold WIRED it does not comment on sourcing.\n\nSenator Warner and Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican and the vice chair of the\nSenate Select Intelligence Committee, later cited that BuzzFeed story in a\nletter urging the Federal Trade Commission to start an investigation into\nTikTok. Politico reported this month that the agency heeded that call and\nopened a probe into whether the app \u201cdeceived its users by denying that\nindividuals in China had access to their data.\u201d\n\nAs Goziker was filing his lawsuits, US lawmakers were getting closer to\nbanning the app than ever before. The House of Representatives approved a bill\nlast month that would force ByteDance to sell off TikTok within six months\nbefore the app would become illegal to download from US app stores. The\nlegislation is now being considered by the Senate, and President Joe Biden has\nalready said he would sign it into law.\n\nUpdated 4/4/2024, 6:15 pm EDT: The House passed the bill that would force\nByteDance to sell TikTok with a clear majority, but not unanimously.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Introducing Politics Lab, your guide to election season\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
