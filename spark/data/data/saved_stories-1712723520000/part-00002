The\ntext is then used as a prompt to make the nude body and the real person\u2019s head\nis added using a face swap tool. NUCA uses Stable Diffusion and controversial\nAI image generator Civitai to make the nude body.\n\nVef and Gro\u00df tell 404 Media that they are not intending to sell NUCA despite\nmaking promotional videos for the contentious gadget.\n\n\u201cWe tried to find out basically how people would react to it because we have\ndifferent reactions ourselves,\u201d Vef says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a critical subject, as\nyou see with everything in the news from Taylor Swift to these kids in Spain\nwho made their classmate\u2019s nude.\u201d\n\nThe nude people are completely AI-generated but people\u2019s faces have been\nswapped in.\n\nOn its website, NUCA says the camera \u201cbrings the fantasy of Superman\u2019s X-ray\nvision to life.\u201d But adds that unlike other deepfakes, the NUCA device \u201cties\ncreator and subject physically together and shows the result immediately,\ntaking away the anonymity that is inherent in internet deepfakes and contrasts\nplayfulness with this nightmare trend.\u201d\n\nVef and Gro\u00df say the camera operates \u201cunder strict ethical guidelines\u201d\nrequiring \u201cexplicit consent and is intended for adult use only.\u201d\n\nThe creators also hope that the project arouses debate on AI\u2019s beauty\nstandards and the \u201cdistorted views of algorithmic bias that AI inherits,\nsetting these perceptions that contrast the user\u2019s own self-image.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by 404 Media if Vef and Gro\u00df are worried that making this camera is\na bad idea, Gro\u00df replied: \u201cI think this is actually the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not putting it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cWith this twist that is an object\nthat\u2019s a camera, we really tie people who are photographed and the person\nwhose picture is being taken together in the same space, and with that we had\nreally, really interesting conversations. I think this is maybe the most\nvaluable bit.\u201d\n\nWhile the camera is not for sale, it will be exhibited in Berlin on June 29 in\na show called Uncanny in the Nuud.\n\nImage credits: NUCA.\n\nFeatures, Technology\n\naicamera, aiimage, aiimagegenerator, ainude, deepfake, nude, nudes\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCamera Takes Pictures by Describing What it Sees to AI\n\nThis \u2018Camera\u2019 Lacks a Sensor or Lens and Uses AI to \u2018Capture\u2019 Images\n\nOne-of-a-Kind 1970 Leica CL Prototype is Available Now for $65,000\n\nThe FlatCam Lens-less Camera is Thinner Than a Coin\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nThis Prototype AI Camera Unclothes its Subjects\n\nApr 08, 2024\n\nTesting Which Camera Has the Best Black and White JPEG Profile\n\nApr 06, 2024\n\nLarge Format Photos Capture Humanity\u2019s Destruction of Earth\n\nApr 06, 2024\n\nShowstopping Photos of the Solar Eclipse Taken During \u2018Once in a Lifetime\u2019\nEvent\n\n13 hours ago\n\nPhotographer Captures Statue of Liberty Getting Zapped by Lightning\n\nApr 04, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
