One subject settles the\ndebate\u2014dating.\n\n  * By Elizabeth Svoboda\n  * September 30, 2016\n  * Illustration by Ellen Porteus\n\n  * Add a comment\n  * Share\n\nFacebook Twitter Pocket Reddit Email\n\nIn the age of online dating there are more romantic options than there are\nfish in the, well, you know. On the appropriately named site Plenty of Fish,\nfor instance, you can pore over profiles of hundreds or thousands of potential\nmates before deciding which ones to contact. Such unfettered choice means a\nbetter shot at true love\u2014or so many daters believe. The more options you have,\nthe assumption goes, the more likely you are to find the one who truly suits\nyou.\n\nYet many daters are finding that less romantic choice yields top-notch results\nwithout all the angst. My longtime friend Shannon Whitaker, a family-practice\nphysician in the Pittsburgh area, found her husband using eHarmony, which has\nits customers fill out a detailed compatibility survey, then sends them a\nrestricted number of matches, typically anywhere from a few to a dozen or so\nat a time. Two weeks after she signed up for the site, Whitaker spotted a guy\nwho intrigued her. They clicked so well that their second date stretched to 11\nhours, and within months, they were starting to talk marriage. Whitaker was\nshocked\u2014and thrilled\u2014to have found the love of her life with relative ease. On\nsites with countless options, \u201cthere would have been so many people who would\nnot have been good fits,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have enjoyed\nweeding them all out\u2014it would have been way too much work.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

When presented with fewer choices, daters are likely to spend\ntime reflecting on a person\u2019s deeper qualities.VCG/VCG via Getty Images\n\nSuccesses like Whitaker\u2019s are unsurprising to Barry Schwartz, Dorwin\nCartwright Professor of Social Theory and Social Action at Swarthmore College.\nSchwartz has spent years arguing that limiting our options consistently leads\nto better outcomes. He thinks too much choice overwhelms us and makes us\nunhappy\u2014a phenomenon he calls the paradox of choice. Endless choices, Schwartz\nsays, are more stultifying than gratifying. In one canonical experiment dubbed\n\u201cthe jam study,\u201d grocery-store shoppers scanning 24 different gourmet jams\nwere less likely to make a purchase than shoppers who looked at only six jams.\nThe shoppers choosing from a wider selection were also unhappier with the jam\nthey\u2019d bought.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe problem, Schwartz explains, is that when you have more options, you tend\nto put more pressure on yourself to make the perfect choice\u2014and you feel more\nlet down when it doesn\u2019t turn out to be perfect, after all. \u201cEven when you\nchoose well, you end up disappointed,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cYou\u2019re convinced that\neven though you did well, you should have done better.\u201d Based on work by\npsychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who have shown bad feelings\nabout losses are stronger than good feelings we have about gains, Schwartz\nargues that as you\u2019re presented with countless choices, your pleasure at the\nprospect of more options is canceled out by the anticipated loss of making a\nwrong choice.\n\n> Faced with too much input, the brain functions like an overloaded circuit.\n\nSince 2004, when Schwartz published The Paradox of Choice, researchers have\nquibbled with the idea that lots of choices are bound to overtax our mental\nresources, leading to decision paralysis and unhappiness. When Benjamin\nScheibehenne, a professor of cognition and consumer behavior at the University\nof Geneva, set out to replicate the jam study, he found no evidence that\npeople were less satisfied with their choices when they had a larger array to\nselect from. \u201cIt seems to be fairly difficult to overload or confuse or\nfrustrate people just based on the number of options,\u201d Scheibehenne says. \u201cIn\nmost situations, people are quite good at coping.\u201d He points out that if\nabundant choice were really as paralyzing as Schwartz and others have\nproposed, people would constantly get stymied in everyday situations like\ndeciding which shirt to wear or what to have for lunch.\n\nInstead, Scheibehenne argues that people generally avoid being overwhelmed by\npracticing a kind of quick-and-dirty mental judo, using some kind of shortcut\nto limit their choices\u2014whether that means giving certain factors more weight\nor simply skipping some of the presented choices. \u201cIf there are more initial\noptions available, all decision-makers have to do is tune their filtering\nprocedure,\u201d he says. Scheibehenne thinks it\u2019s smart to use some sort of\nconscious method to narrow your sights\u2014whether that means relying on a web\nsite\u2019s compatibility formula or concocting your own instinctive rule of thumb.\nPeople who do this, he says, \u201cusually end up with a set of reasonably good\noptions that fit their needs, and they\u2019re not overwhelmed anymore.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Where they differ is on whether having a large number of initial\nchoices breeds dissatisfaction. Scheibehenne\u2019s research indicates it doesn\u2019t.\nBut Schwartz counters that while we often like the idea of unrestricted\nchoice, the satisfaction we think it will bring doesn\u2019t always materialize.\n\u201cWe always think we want choice,\u201d Schwartz writes, \u201cbut when we actually get\nit, we may not like it.\u201d\n\nThe debate over the paradox of choice has often revolved around the mundane:\nwhat digital camera to buy, which tropical vacation spot to book, what to\nwatch on Netflix. Now independent research reveals that when it comes to\nhelping people obtain what they truly need\u2014a romantic partner, someone with\nwhom to share life\u2019s traumas and triumphs\u2014less is indeed more. Nowhere are the\nbenefits of choice-limiting more profound than in the quintessentially human\nrealm of love.\n\nThe brain\u2019s architecture helps explain why a choice free-for-all can burn us\nout so easily. While the logic- and reason-guided prefrontal cortex is a key\nplayer in the decision-making process, it can get overwhelmed under duress.\nResearch at Temple University\u2019s Center for Neural Decision Making has shown\nthat when people were bombarded with complex information, brain activity in\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) ramped up\u2014but only to a point.\nFaced with too much input, the DLPFC responded by decreasing its activity,\nmuch like an overloaded circuit switching itself off.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In a\nHarvard study where people were presented with a series of similar options,\nbrain areas responsible for anxiety lit up on their functional MRI scans as\nthey struggled to make a decision. Since the Internet, social media, and\ncrafty marketers present us with so many more similar choices now than we had\neven 20 years ago, our brains are likely churning out this anxious response on\na regular basis. Over time, such constant indecision can darken your mood and\noutlook. The dopamine system, involving brain chemicals and neural actions\ninvolved in reward and punishment, is working overtime. \u201cUnder continued\nstress, the dopamine system tends to get depleted, and you might fall into\nfeelings of continual despair,\u201d says biological anthropologist Helen Fisher,\nauthor of The Anatomy of Love, revised and updated this year. \u201cThis sort of\nthing could happen to the brain when you get too many choices.\u201d\n\nSeasoned online daters can testify to the way their eyes glaze over after\nthey\u2019ve clicked through a few dozen profiles. And when you don\u2019t have any\nclear way to rank your options\u2014when you dredge up a bunch of prospects who are\nall brunette, funny, and into rock-climbing\u2014you\u2019ll probably start to feel like\nthe donkey who starved in a hayfield because he couldn\u2019t decide which hay pile\nto eat. \u201cThe more people you look at, the less likely you are to choose\nanybody,\u201d says Fisher. Humans lived in small hunter-gatherer groups for many\nthousands of years and often chose their mates from within those groups. So it\nmakes perfect sense, Fisher says, that we\u2019re not biologically equipped to\nprocess the mate-choice bonanza of the Internet age. (Fisher is Chief\nScientific Advisor at Match.com, where she has designed a personality test for\nusers.)\n\n> When you have a lot of options, you put more pressure on yourself to make\n> the perfect choice.\n\nWhen you try to surpass your mental limitations, you may get caught up in your\nfear of making a wrong choice, just as Schwartz would predict. A 2016\nUniversity of Wisconsin study of online daters found that daters who chose\nfrom a pool of 24 possible partners were less satisfied with who they picked\nthan daters who chose from a pool of only six. On top of that, the daters who\nhad more options were more likely to want to reverse their decisions. Perhaps\nthey just couldn\u2019t shake the thought that they were missing out on something\nbetter.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

When online\ndaters had more search options in a University of Taiwan study, they spent\nless time considering each possibility and found it harder to sort the good\nprospects from the bad ones. Stretching your cognitive capacity too thinly,\nthe researchers explain, tends to hamstring you on irrelevant details and\ndistract you from the criteria you consider most important. That suggests that\nin order to assess the qualities that matter\u2014which, for most people, are\nthings like a partner\u2019s honesty, his dependability, her sense of humor\u2014you\nneed to go deeper in your search, not wider.\n\nDoes that mean you should opt for the expert-guided, custom-flight approach\nproffered by vendors like eHarmony? Quite a few daters appreciate curated\nselection enough to be willing to pay extra for it, and Hanna Halaburda, a\nvisiting professor at New York University and senior economist at the Bank of\nCanada, conducted a study (independent of eHarmony) to figure out why. For\nstarters, Halaburda says, you face less competition in a restricted-choice\nscenario. You\u2019ll be one of the few options that appears in other daters\u2019\nlists, meaning they\u2019ll consider you more seriously than they would if you were\none of thousands. And when your own choice is curtailed, you\u2019ll evaluate your\noptions differently, too. \u201cHaving less choice forces you to look more\ncarefully at the person,\u201d Halaburda says. \u201cYou don\u2019t dismiss them as much.\u201d\nThat means you might hit the romantic jackpot with someone you\u2019d once have\nshunned for a superficial reason (their cartilage piercing, say, or their love\nfor the Oakland Raiders).\n\nMost sites focused on curation also ask users to jump through some hoops to\nparticipate. The eHarmony compatibility questionnaire, for instance, can take\npeople hours to complete, and that creates a different, smaller user pool from\nthe beginning. \u201cYou know that once you are on this platform, your potential\npartner has also invested a lot to be on this platform,\u201d Halaburda says. That\ncommitment signifies the seriousness of your would-be paramour\u2019s intentions, a\nbig plus for many busy professionals. Whitaker, who was preparing to start her\nresidency when she signed up for eHarmony, didn\u2019t have time for flaky or\ncommitment-shy beaux. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky that I found someone right away,\u201d she\nsays.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a choice-narrowing computer program that takes a range of factors\ninto account\u2014personality quirks, religious beliefs, professed values\u2014can save\nyou from your own worst romantic impulses. Left to face too many choices on\nyour own, you might revert to superficial preferences without even realizing\nit. In one study of speed daters, women chose their partners mostly on the\nbasis of appearance, giving deeper qualities more weight only when they had\nfewer partner choices. \u201cYou\u2019re likelier to make bad decisions when there are\nlots of options,\u201d Schwartz says, \u201cespecially if it\u2019s a complicated decision.\u201d\nWith a smaller pool, you can devote your mental resources to making sure your\npotential partners have the vital qualities most important to you in a\nrelationship.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe less-is-more calculus changes a bit if you expect your future partner to\nfit very specific criteria. Northwestern marketing professor Alexander Chernev\nhas found that people who have strong ideas about what they want relish\nchoosing from a larger assortment. Ruthless filtering may help explain this\nresult: If you only want to date a Sikh like yourself, or a vegan, your set of\nserious options will end up being manageable post-filter, even if your initial\npool of options is large. For those whose preferences aren\u2019t so specific,\nthough, the filtering process isn\u2019t as easy or straightforward, and the threat\nof overwhelming choices looms larger.\n\nBut whether the choosing process is simple or protracted, it\u2019s no easy feat to\nbanish the grass-is-greener thoughts that always seem to pop up later on,\ntelling you to widen your horizons, keep your options open, bail out when\nthings get rough. Still, Schwartz says, familiarity with the pain of too many\nchoices\u2014losing a true soul mate, perhaps, because you had one eye on other\nprospects\u2014may help temper the anxiety of limiting your options. \u201cThe way you\nlearn this is by suffering with the problem of choice,\u201d he says.\n\nEven if limiting your dating choices brings practical and emotional benefits,\nit\u2019s worth asking whether those benefits justify giving up a certain amount of\nindividual agency. Signing up for a choice-limiting site involves trusting a\ncomputer algorithm to make key calls for you\u2014like deciding which handful of\npeople, out of a potential pool of thousands, you\u2019ll be able to get to know\nmore deeply. The algorithm is a black box, the contents of which remain in\nflux as programmers tweak this or that line of code or re-weight one\npersonality variable against another. Even outside the online-dating realm,\nsome might argue that any option-limiting shortcut is a copout\u2014that you need\nto take the full measure of a choice like who your life partner should be,\neven when choosing is tedious or uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s a compelling argument, one born of the same impulse that drives Western\ncultural resistance to arranged marriage. And importantly, it\u2019s clear that we\nreally don\u2019t like to bail out of the choice process entirely. In Tulane\nUniversity experiments where people were only given one DVD player option to\nbuy, they were less likely to make a purchase than they were if they had two\nor more options\u2014a reaction researcher Daniel Mochon calls \u201csingle-option\naversion.\u201d The paradox of choice may be alive and well, but our choices,\nromantic and otherwise, must also be numerous enough to be meaningful.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nSo is there an ideally sized choice set when it comes to dating\u2014one large\nenough to include variety and depth, yet small enough that you can fairly\nweigh each prospect\u2019s potential without tripping your brain\u2019s overload switch?\n\u201cPeople are trying to make a hard problem easy by suggesting there\u2019s a magic\nnumber,\u201d Schwartz says. In experiments involving consumer products, he points\nout, the optimal number of choices seems to be between 8 and 12.\n\nFisher puts people somewhere in the middle of that range. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve met\nnine people who are vaguely in the ballpark, choose one and get to know that\nperson better. If nothing works in that nine, go for another nine,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBut stop going out with a million different people. The human brain has never\nbeen built to have 20,000 choices for a partner.\u201d Until recently in human\nhistory, most people only would have had a handful of mate choices. Yet most\npartners stayed together for life, and real-life stories of deathless\nlove\u2014Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, Marie and Pierre Curie\u2014still echo through\nthe generations.\n\nWhat forms and cements lasting partnerships, then as today, is not unfettered\nchoice that serial daters imagine will usher in the perfect match. It\u2019s\nfinding someone who feels like home, in the truest sense of the word, and\nsettling in. \u201cOften, you don\u2019t find out about the things that matter until you\nget to know somebody pretty well,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cWith a million options,\nyou\u2019re less likely to persevere.\u201d\n\nIn the realm of relationships, then, keeping choice in check is what frees you\nto forge the thoughtful connections that make for lasting love. Mulling a\nmanageable number of options with care and depth is a strategy more\nexhaustive\u2014and, ultimately, more effective\u2014than scanning every single profile\non dating sites. Paradoxically enough, narrowing your sights might end up\nbeing the most liberating romantic choice of all.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
