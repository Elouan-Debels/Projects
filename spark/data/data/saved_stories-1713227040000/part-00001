Sir Andrew McFarlane,\npresident of the Family Division, said the final divorce had to stand and that\nthere was no precedent for overturning an order where there had been no\nprocedural irregularity.\n\nThe outcome prompted an outpouring of support from lawyers on social media for\nthe person who made the mistake. The firm\u2019s founder and president Ayesha\nVardag told the Gazette that no blame was attached and urged those in charge\nof the system to remember that it is dealing with human beings.\n\nVardag: Court decision is the kind that makes people run from the profession\n\nSource: Jonathan Goldberg/Shutterstock\n\nVardag said: \u2018The young lawyer who made the slip with the drop down menu on\nthe new divorce portal is one of the best of the next generation. Not sloppy,\nnot careless. Totally committed, extremely able. That young lawyer, our\nbrilliant young lawyer, genuinely needs support to deal with the trauma of it\nall.\n\n\u2018Even with me saying \u201cany of us could have done this\u201d, and with collective\nresponsibility, it\u2019s the kind of thing that wakes people up at night, gives\nthem breakdowns or makes them run away from the law completely.\u2019\n\nAdvert\n\nVardag said the mistake happened after the wrong name was clicked on from a\ndrop-down menu on the divorce portal. She claimed that court staff had\nadmitted this had happened a few times and that it felt like a design flaw.\n\nCommenters on social media asked why the system required users to click on\nnames rather than require them to input case references, which would prevent\nthis type of mistake from happening.\n\nVardag added: \u2018The courts shouldn\u2019t change people\u2019s marital status based on a\nslip on an online portal. Whether the person makes the slip themselves or\ntheir lawyer does. It goes against the principle of intention which suffuses\nour law. It\u2019s absurd that we can have orders amended under the \u201cslip rule\u201d and\neveryone understands it happens, but when it\u2019s a slip on the portal it\u2019s set\nin stone.\u2019\n\nLondon firm Ribet Myles had represented the husband in the divorce proceedings\nand had opposed the application to set aside the final order.\n\nJulian Ribet, the firm\u2019s founding partner, said his client had not known for\nmonths whether he was divorced or not and he wanted his legal status to be\nconfirmed.\n\nHe added: \u2018The wife\u2019s solicitors hoped that the order would be treated as an\nadministrative error and deemed never to have existed.\n\n\u2018We objected on the basis that the divorce had been properly applied for, and\nwas therefore effective, notwithstanding the fact that the wife\u2019s solicitors\nhad in fact applied on behalf of the wrong client.\u2019\n\nThis article is now closed for comment.\n\n  * 24 Comments\n\n  * Save article\n\nPlease Sign in to your account to use this feature\n\n### 24 Readers' comments\n\n  * Anonymous#CommentAvatarLabel Commented on: 15 April 2024 3:56pm\n\nI agree.

They won't make that mistake again. Having read the\njudgment, the error appears to have been compounded by the manner in which the\nhigher-ups in the firm and their counsel subsequently tried to undo it. As\nothers have said, the main issue, as ever, is probably money. I understand the\nreason an applicant may delay applying for decree absolute (or whatever its\ncalled these days) is to ensure that financial matters are resolved first, so\nthat pension and inheritance rights are only curtailed upon the divorce taking\neffect. I make no assumptions about the underlying circumstances, but the\napplicant having control of the timing of the divorce can sometimes be used to\napply undue pressure in the financial negotiations.\n\nUnsuitable or offensive?

It's the way in which the employer deals with it. It wasn't a\nsimple pressing of a wrong button. It appears to have been not paying\nattention to what was being done. That can happen to the best of us. This\nneeds to be looked at proportionately. It's not like the not paying attention\nhappened in a car when the consequences could have been catastrophic and life\nchanging. The person who filed the order needs to know we all make mistakes\nand that whilst this is serious, it's only money, the employer is insured and\nthat he or she has the support of the employer.\n\nUnsuitable or offensive?

The husband agrees with the result. Apart from wanting to\nminimise the understandable embarrassment what purpose would have been served\nby returning to the status quo ante? Assuming the Judge had granted the\napplication it would have been sooner or later but probably very soon been\nfollowed by another application for an absolute.

The SRA may yet impose a\nsanction though. Surely Marley v Rawlins is a good case that ought to be cited\non appeal here (in that case non-compliance with the Wills Act 1837 over-\nruled).

Since all human beings make errors,\nsystems should be designed to reduce the chance of an error occurring. For\nexample, if one had to manually type in both the case number and the name of\none's client, this kind of mistake would be very difficult to make. If one\nmerely has to choose a name from a drop-down menu, a slight tremor of the hand\njust before clicking may cause the wrong name to be selected without the eye\nor the brain having registered that this has occurred. Yes, the names of the\nparties are then displayed, but it comes naturally to a human being trying to\nget something done simply to assume that the correct name was selected and not\nwhere he or she needs to look on the screen in order to check that this was\nthe case.\n\nAlso, what happens if one has two clients with the same name? One could be\ndealing with more than one Williams v Williams divorce.\n\nUnsuitable or offensive?

I suspect we do not.\n\nI think that the whole approach to online justice mirrors this decision. If\nthe button is clicked, it stands - error, or not. I suspect that the reason\nfor that trajectory is the simpler administration of the process and the use\nof AI/bots on the court side.

In this profession, mistakes can\nbe very costly and it\u2019s important to recognise that, rather than try and\nminimise the effect. In PI, if you add an extra 0 onto an offer, you may get\nit set aside at court as a mistake, or you may have to pay out 10x what you\nintended; I\u2019ve seen both happen. If you make a slip up in a criminal law\ncontext, it could cost someone their freedom, or prevent justice from being\ndone. You may accidentally sell someone\u2019s house from under them if you put the\nwrong date of sale in a conveyancing document. It can happen, and it has\nnothing to do with using a portal or not.\n\nThis was a careless mistake that must nonetheless be acknowledged and learned\nfrom, else there will be more mistakes from the firm and the lawyer. In the\nend, we\u2019ll all end up paying, either in increased PII premiums or from PC fees\nfrom compensation fund pay outs.\n\nUnsuitable or offensive?

Like many\nsimilar online processes, an operator may only get to the final screen where\nthe final click of the mouse is made after travelling through a series of\nearlier screens. First of all, a solicitor, who may have a series of different\ndivorce proceedings 'live' on the system at any one time, must select one\nparticular case. It was at this stage that the error made by Vardags'\noperative apparently took place. Thereafter a number of other screens must be\ntraversed, each of which prominently bears the names of the parties (for\nexample 'Williams v Williams'). At the final stage, after clicking the request\nfor a final order, a further screen comes up inviting the operative to confirm\nthat this is indeed what is sought \u2013 again the name of the case is prominently\ndisplayed on this screen.\u201d\n\nUnsuitable or offensive?
