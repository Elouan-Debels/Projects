The disease most commonly begins in middle age, but\nmuch younger age groups can be afflicted, and until now there is no cure or\nprevention.\n\nAbatacept is currently used as an effective second or third line treatment for\npeople living with established rheumatoid arthritis and is given by weekly\ninjections at home or in hospital via a drip.\n\nThe research team recruited 213 patients at high risk of the disease to\nunderstand whether a year-long treatment of the biologic drug could be used to\nprevent progression to rheumatoid arthritis. They recruited men and women over\nthe age of 18 with early symptoms such as joint pain but no joint swelling,\nand treated half with the drug and half with a placebo every week for a year.\nThe study drug was then stopped, and study participants monitored for a\nfurther 12 months.\n\nAfter twelve months of treatment, 6% of patients treated with abatacept had\ndeveloped arthritis compared to 29% in the placebo arm. By 24 months, the\ndifferences were still significant, with a total of 25% progressing to\nrheumatoid arthritis in the abatacept arm compared to 37% in the placebo arm.\n\n> This trial is important because it is the largest study examining prevention\n> of rheumatoid arthritis to date and uses advanced imaging to understand the\n> full extent of joint inflammation during the study. This gives the study\n> researchers significant power to understand who, when and how to target\n> people at risk of arthritis.\n>\n> Professor Andrew Filer, University of Birmingham, Institute of Inflammation\n> and Ageing\n\nSecondary outcomes for the trial showed that abatacept was associated with\nimprovements in pain scores, function and quality of life measurements, as\nwell as lower scores of inflammation of the lining of joints detectable by\nultrasound scan.\n\n## Leading the way in ultrasound technology\n\nAs the study was aimed at preventing arthritis from developing, it was crucial\nfor researchers to know without doubt whether there was arthritis in the\njoints when participants developed any new symptoms.\n\nTo be able to precisely assess this, the team scanned patient\u2019s joints using\nstate-of-the-art ultrasound technology designed by Professor Andrew Filer\u2019s\nteam at the University of Birmingham. Ultrasound is significantly more\nsensitive than examination by clinical staff, and it\u2019s also fast, painless and\nhas no side effects.\n\nProfessor Filer\u2019s group worked with international collaborators to create a\nprotocol for joint scanning for the trial, and then trained all 28\nparticipating units across the UK and the Netherlands. The group has extensive\nexperience in scanning patients in the earliest phases of arthritis as part of\nthe NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre longitudinal arthritis cohorts.\n\n## New hope for arthritis patients\n\nPhilip Day, a 35-year-old software engineer and founder of FootballMatcher\nfrom Eltham, was at high-risk for rheumatoid arthritis. A keen football\nplayer, Philip\u2019s joint pain deterred him from playing and affected his day-to-\nday life. He was enrolled in the trial in 2018, at the age of the 30, and was\nprescribed abatacept.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe pain got so terrible I stopped going to football, and I got\nlazier and felt progressively worse physically and mentally. The pain was\nunpredictable, it would show up in my knees one day, my elbows the next, and\nthen my wrists or even my neck. At the time, my wife and I wanted to have\nchildren and I realised my future was pretty bleak if the disease progressed.\nI\u2019d always wanted to be the kind of dad that played football with his son and\nI knew the pain would stop me from realising that dream.\n\n\u201cEnrolling in the trial was a no-brainer; it was a ray of hope at a dark time.\nWithin a few months I had no more aches or pains and five years on I\u2019d say\nI\u2019ve been cured. Now, I can play football with my three-year-old son and have\na normal life.\u201d\n\nOne year\u2019s treatment with abatacept costs the NHS about \u00a310,000 per patient\nand is not without risk. Side effects include upper respiratory tract\ninfections, dizziness, nausea and diarrhoea, but these are generally mild.\n\nProfessor Andrew Cope, from King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThis is the largest\nrheumatoid arthritis prevention trial to date and the first to show that a\ntherapy licensed for use in treating established rheumatoid arthritis is also\neffective in preventing the onset of disease in people at risk. These initial\nresults could be good news for people at risk of arthritis as we show that the\ndrug not only prevents disease onset during the treatment phase but can also\nease symptoms such as pain and fatigue. This is also promising news for the\nNHS as the disease affects people as they age and will become more expensive\nto treat with a growing aging population.\n\n\u201cThere are currently no drugs available that prevent this potentially\ncrippling disease. Our next steps are to understand people at risk in more\ndetail so that we can be absolutely sure that those at highest risk of\ndeveloping rheumatoid arthritis receive the drug.\u201d\n\n## Featured staff\n\n## Professor Andrew Filer\n\nProfessor of Translational Rheumatology\n\n## Topics\n\nHealth & medicine\n\n## Featured staff\n\n## Professor Andrew Filer\n\nProfessor of Translational Rheumatology\n\n## More in Health & medicine\n\n## Live long and prosper? 7 top tips for targeting inflammaging and promoting\na longer healthier life\n\nAs people are living longer, experts from the Institute of Inflammation and\nAgeing cover seven evidence-based recommendations to tackle 'inflammageing'.\n\nPublished today\n\n## Objective biomarker test could predict heart disease risk for patients with\ncommon arrhythmia\n\nPatients with Atrial Fibrillation deemed high risk following analysis had five\ntimes as many cardiovascular events as low-risk cluster\n\nPublished 13 April 2024\n\n## Targeting RAS proteins may prevent relapse in Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nTargeting RAS family proteins in FLT3-ITD+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia shuts off a\ncommon route to drug resistance.\n\nPublished 9 April 2024\n\n## New research partnership set to improve health in China\u2019s Greater Bay area\n\nThe University of Birmingham and Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen\nUniversity are working together to improve healthcare in China and beyond.\n\nPublished 5 April 2024\n\n## Fontan circulation link to changes in genetic code may lead to new\ntreatment for heart conditions\n\nProcedure used to treat children born with heart conditions may provide a new\ntreatment opportunity\n\nPublished 4 April 2024\n\n## Doctors on front line of tackling childhood obesity but more training and\nresources needed\n\nIn-depth interviews reveal little training for healthcare professionals or\nadditional resources to support families\n\nPublished 4 April 2024\n\n## Most popular\n\n## University of Birmingham and Fraunhofer UMSICHT renew applied research\npartnership\n\nPublished 26 March 2024\n\n## 3D mouth of an ancient jawless fish suggests they were filter-feeders, not\nscavengers or hunters\n\nPublished 10 April 2024\n\n## Cloud engineering could be more effective \u2018painkiller\u2019 for global warming\nthan previously thought\n\nPublished 11 April 2024\n\n## Horizon Europe funding awarded for glycan research\n\nPublished 11 April 2024\n\n  * Edgbaston\n  * Birmingham, B15 2TT\n  * United Kingdom\n\nTel:+44 (0)121 414 3344\n\n  * University of Birmingham Instagram page\n  * University of Birmingham Linkedin page\n  * University of Birmingham Twitter page\n  * University of Birmingham Facebook page\n  * University of Birmingham Weibo page\n  * University of Birmingham We Chat\n  * University of Birmingham YouTube page\n\n  * Culture and collections\n  * Schools, institutes and departments\n  * Services and facilities\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Legal\n  * Modern slavery\n  * Accessibility\n  * Intranet\n  * Canvas Learning Environment\n  * Publication scheme\n  * Information for applicants\n  * Freedom of information\n  * Charitable information\n  * Cookies and cookie policy\n  * Website feedback\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 University of Birmingham 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
