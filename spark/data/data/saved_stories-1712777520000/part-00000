Solis/AP\n\nEPA is limiting PFAS chemicals in drinking water in the U.S.\n\nRogelio V. Solis/AP\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced new drinking water standards\nWednesday to limit exposure to a class of chemicals called PFAS.\n\n\"There's no doubt that these chemicals have been important for certain\nindustries and consumer uses, but there's also no doubt that many of these\nchemicals can be harmful to our health and our environment,\" said EPA\nadministrator Michael Regan in a call with reporters.\n\nThis is the first time the agency has set enforceable limits on PFAS in\ndrinking water.\n\nPFAS stands for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances \u2013 a large group\nof man-made chemicals that have been used since the 1940s to waterproof and\nstainproof products from clothing, makeup and furniture to firefighting foam\nand semiconductors.\n\nManufactured by several large companies including Dupont and 3M, PFAS have\nstrong molecular bonds that don't break down for a long time, which is why\nthey're known as \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nPFAS from the 1940s \"are still in our environment today,\" says Anna Reade,\nlead scientist on PFAS for the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"The levels\nof these chemicals keep building up in our water and our food and our air.\"\n\nEvidence for their harmful effects on human health have also accumulated.\n\"Long term exposure to certain types of PFAS have been linked to serious\nillnesses, including cancer, liver damage and high cholesterol,\" the EPA's\nRegan said.\n\nThe EPA also noted PFAS exposure has been linked to immune and developmental\ndamage to infants and children.\n\n### Science\n\n### PFAS 'forever chemicals' are everywhere. Here's what you should know about\nthem\n\nThat's why the EPA has finalized a rule restricting six PFAS chemicals in the\nwater \u2013 individually, or in combination with each other or both \u2013 meaning\nwater systems are required to monitor for these chemicals and remove them if\nthey're found above allowable levels. While some states have instituted their\nown PFAS limits, this is the first time it's happening on the federal level.\n\nPublic water systems will have five years to address their PFAS problems \u2013\nthree years to sample their systems and establish the existing levels of PFAS,\nand an additional two years to install water treatment technologies if their\nlevels are too high, senior government officials told reporters.\n\nThe EPA expects that excess PFAS levels will be found in around 6-10% of water\nsystems, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.\n\n\"This is historic and monumental,\" says Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean\nCape Fear, an advocacy group working to protect communities from PFAS\ncontamination. \"I didn't think [the EPA] would ever do it.\" Donovan lives in\nan area of North Carolina which has been contaminated with PFAS from the\nChemours chemical manufacturing plant.\n\nShe says seeing the EPA set limits is \"validating.\" Six years ago when her\ngroup first raised the issue of PFAS, she says they were told that the water\nmet or exceeded state and federal guidelines. \"And that's because there\nweren't any,\" she says. \"It really broke public trust for so many people in\nour community.\"\n\n\"The final rule is a breakthrough for public health,\" says Erik Olson, a\nsenior director with NRDC. \"We believe it's going to save thousands of lives\nas a result of reduced exposure of tens of millions of people to these toxic\nchemicals in the tap water.\"\n\nThere are more than 12,000 known PFAS chemicals. The six that the EPA is\nrestricting \"have had many animal and, in many cases, human studies, so [the\nEPA] feels confident that they have estimated the safe levels of these\nchemicals,\" says Elizabeth Southerland, a former EPA official in the Office of\nWater, who left the agency in 2017.\n\nSoutherland says the new limits are a bold first step towards addressing the\nPFAS problem. And while the EPA has focused on only six chemicals, the\ntreatments that water utilities use to remove these chemicals will also remove\nother chemicals of concern from drinking water.\n\nIn addition to other PFAS, \"they will also be taking out all kinds of\npesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products that are unregulated\nnow under the Safe Drinking Water Act, but [which] we know have serious health\neffects,\" Southerland says.\n\nThe agency estimates that it will cost $1.5 billion a year for water companies\nto comply with the regulation \u2013 for as long as PFAS continues to show up in\nthe drinking water. \"The costs are not just for a one time sampling and then\nputting in the treatment,\" Southerland says. They include ongoing monitoring\nand maintaining equipment, for instance replacing carbon filters on a regular\nschedule.\n\nThe EPA says the benefits will equal, if not exceed the cost, in terms of less\ncancer, and fewer heart attacks, strokes and birth complications in the\naffected population.\n\nThe announcement comes with $1 billion in grants to help water systems and\nprivate well owners conduct initial testing and treatment. It's part of a $9\nbillion funding package for PFAS removal in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\nCompanies that made these chemicals are also on the hook for more than $10\nbillion from a class action lawsuit \u2013 money which will go to public water\nsystems to remove PFAS.\n\nIf water systems can't access those funds, or if the funds run out, some of\nthose costs may eventually get passed on to consumers, says the NRDC's Olson.\n\n  * PFAS\n  * forever chemicals\n  * drinking water\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Family\n\n#### National Siblings Day is a celebration born of love \u2014 and grief\n\n##### Mental Health\n\n#### A gunman stole his twin from him.
