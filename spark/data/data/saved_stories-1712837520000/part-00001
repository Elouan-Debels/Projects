The lithium that we use to power much of our\nlives these days is so common as to seem almost prosaic. But this element\nturns out to be a wild card, a rebel that\u2019s been challenging our most basic\nunderstanding of the formation of the universe itself.\n\nBeyond the lithium ion-powered batteries, beyond the glass and ceramic\nmanufacture, optical systems, air purification, fireworks and rocket\npropellants, nuclear weapons, and mood stabilizing pills, lithium is cast\nabout the cosmos. But there is not nearly as much of it out there as there\nshould be. And we don\u2019t know why.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThis wily little element has defied explanation for generations, refusing to\nobey the rest of our cosmological orthodoxy. The robust Big Bang theory, among\nother accomplishments, allows us to precisely predict the abundances of all of\nthe light elements across the universe.\n\nExcept lithium.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhich means there might be something wrong with our understanding of the Big\nBang. There might be something wrong with our measurements. There might be\nsomething wrong with both. Or this might be a signal that there are new, as-\nyet undiscovered forces that were at work in the early universe. Whatever the\nsolution is, this rebel and its so-called \u201ccosmological lithium problem\u201d are\nhere to teach us a radical new fact about the universe.\n\nWe just have to figure it out.\n\nHere on Earth, lithium had laid underfoot since the planet\u2019s formation, with\nnobody suspecting that the element even existed. Taken from the Greek word for\n\u201crock,\u201d on Earth, lithium is usually only found in trace amounts in larger\nmineral conglomerations. In 1800, the Brazilian chemist Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de\nAndrada e Silva discovered it as a new ore on the island of Uto, Sweden.\nSeventeen years later, the chemist J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius isolated the new\nelement within the ore. Since then, the silvery-white metal has found itself\nmaking possible so many of our contemporary luxuries.\n\nBut most of the universe\u2019s lithium is bound up inside of stars.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

And\n> we don\u2019t know why.\n\nRoughly 25 percent of all the lithium in the universe\u2014including the lithium in\nhousehold electronics\u2014originated in the first few minutes of the Big Bang.\n\nThe Big Bang theory tells us that 13.77 billion years ago the entire\nobservable cosmos\u2014containing every star and every galaxy in a volume now\nspanning more than 90 billion light-years across\u2014was compressed into a volume\nno bigger than a peach.\n\nMere moments into the Big Bang, the temperatures were so high that all protons\nand neutrons were just melted together into their constituent components,\nwhich are tiny particles known as quarks. Any time some quarks got together to\nmake a proton, they just got smashed apart by some violent collision or high-\nenergy radiation. But as the universe expanded, it cooled. At a certain point,\nsomewhere about three minutes into the Big Bang, that exotic plasma cooled to\naround 1 billion Kelvin\u2014still terrifically hot, but cool enough to allow for\nthe production of stable protons and neutrons.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThese nuclear reactions continued, with the newly formed protons and neutrons\nthemselves binding together, creating the four lightest elements on the\nperiodic table: hydrogen, helium, lithium, and beryllium. But after about\n10-20 minutes of this dance, the expanding universe got too cold to sustain\nfurther reactions, locking these elements in place.\n\nIt would take until the formation of the first stars, hundreds of millions of\nyears later, for new elements to be fashioned again in the universe.\n\nTHE BIG PULL: Cosmologists continue to puzzle over the apparent lack of\nlithium in the universe. They currently think about three quarters of it comes\nfrom orbiting star systems in which a dense white dwarf pulls hydrogen off of\nits partner, eventually sparking a classical nova and a fusion reaction that\nsolders components of hydrogen into lithium. Image by Nazarii_Neshcherenskyi /\nShutterstock.\n\nOne of the greatest triumphs of the Big Bang theory is its ability to predict\nthe abundance of these light elements. First calculated by physicist Ralph\nAlpher in the 1940s using the then-new knowledge of nuclear physics, the work\nwas fully fleshed out in a famous paper he coauthored.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThese calculations, collectively known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, offer one\nof the most powerful predictions of the Big Bang theory: a precise, on-the-\nnose estimate of how much of the light elements were made in those first fiery\nminutes, tested by astronomers through the study of the oldest stars,\ngalaxies, and nebulas in the cosmos.\n\nExcept lithium.\n\nThese nucleosynthesis calculations predict roughly three times as much lithium\nas has been observed in old stars (our best proxy for early conditions of the\nuniverse). Conversely, in keeping with the element\u2019s paradoxical nature,\nnewborn stars tend to have much more lithium than we would expect.\n\nAnd all of this is only the first quarter of the lithium in the universe.\nCosmologists now think the other 75 percent may come from a particular kind of\nexploding star known as a classical nova. In a classical nova, a white\ndwarf\u2014the leftover remnant core of a sun-like star\u2014has an orbiting companion.\nThe gravity of the white dwarf vacuums hydrogen gas off of the companion,\nforming an atmosphere around itself. But when the densities reach a critical\ntrigger point, the hydrogen spontaneously undergoes a runaway fusion reaction,\nblowing up the atmosphere (and occasionally appearing in our sky as a \u201cnew\u201d\nstar\u2014a nova). Because lithium is composed of three protons and some neutrons,\nthe fusion of hydrogen during a nova readily makes lithium in abundance.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> Roughly 25 percent of all the lithium in the universe originated in the\n> first few minutes of the Big Bang.\n\nBut lithium is also highly unstable, as it has the lowest binding energy of\nthe light elements, meaning that it takes the least amount of energy to tear\nit apart again. So most of the lithium produced during a nova evaporates into\nhydrogen and helium. What remains is subject to the ravages of cosmic rays,\nwhich can pierce its nuclear heart and destabilize it, vaporizing it in the\nsame way ... or be spontaneously created when a cosmic ray strikes a heavier\natom.\n\nConfused? You\u2019re not alone. Astronomers cannot figure out which processes play\nthe most important role and what the final tally of lithium should be after\nall this astrophysical mixing and mashing. All this means that we only have a\nhazy connection between the lithium produced in the fires of the Big Bang and\nthe lithium that we see scattered across the cosmos today.\n\nWhen mysteries like this persist through the decades, scientists take it as a\nsign that the universe is telling them something important. The nature of that\nimportant thing is a matter of some debate. And as is usual in physics\ndebates, the theorists blame the observers, and the observers blame the\ntheorists.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nOne possibility for the strangeness of lithium is that our theoretical\nunderstanding of nuclear physics, especially the intense physics operating in\nthe first few minutes of the Big Bang, is not up to par.\n\nThis is difficult to reconcile because, given our mastery of nuclear power\nplants and nuclear weapons, we seem to have a pretty good handle on these\ninteractions. But there are some intriguing openings. For example, extra-rare\nreaction chains may contribute to some extra lithium without upsetting the\nbalance of the other elements. Or resonances may play a role. These are\nspecial combinations of pressure, temperature, and interaction volume that\nlead to greater-than-average production of elements. We may have\nunderestimated the importance of some of these resonances in Big Bang physics\nsimply because they don\u2019t crop up often in Earthbound experiments.\n\nOn the other hand, our observations may be leading us astray. Lithium is a\nfragile element, so it\u2019s difficult to get a handle on primordial populations\nthat have not been touched or contaminated by other processes. The best we can\ndo is search for the oldest existing stars in the galaxy and try to measure\nthe amount of lithium on their surfaces. These old stars are the most likely\nto be \u201cpure\u201d\u2014to reflect the primordial amounts of lithium manufactured in the\nBig Bang rather than in later stellar fusion processes. These measurements are\nless than straightforward, requiring a significant amount of calibration and\nfine-tuning, because we can only infer the amount of lithium once we know the\nstar\u2019s temperature and abundance of other elements. If those calibrations are\noff, so are our estimates of lithium, giving us only a rough and unrefined\npicture of how much lithium was kicking around the universe when those stars\nfirst formed.\n\n> As is usual in physics debates, the theorists blame the observers, and the\n> observers blame the theorists.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAnd it turns out that the surfaces of stars might not even be the best place\nto look for lithium. The vast bulk of every star is made of the two lightest\nelements, hydrogen and helium. Lithium, being heavier than both, might simply\nslink into the inner depths of each star, hiding itself from our view. If it\nsinks too far down, the intense temperatures and pressures may disassociate\nit, converting it into even more hydrogen and helium.\n\nThe most thrilling possibility is that both the theorists and observers are\nright, but we\u2019re completely missing some interesting bit of new physics in the\nearly universe. Perhaps some dark matter, the ever-present mysterious particle\nthat appears to make up most of the matter in the universe, can spontaneously\ndecay into other particles, which messes up the nuclear chain reactions of\nnucleosynthesis and alters the abundances of lithium. Some physicists have\neven proposed that the fundamental constants of nature, including the speed of\nlight or the charge on the electron, might have been different in the deep and\ndistant past, which would throw off many of our calculations.\n\nWhile most astronomers think that the answer is likely in some ho-hum\ndirection like the destruction of lithium in stellar atmospheres, that\nsolution has not been confirmed. We can\u2019t crack open stars and see what\u2019s\ngoing on inside, and so we can\u2019t directly test the hypothesis.\n\nSome mysteries lead to vast upheavals of previous norms. Some resolve quietly.\nBut no matter what, rebels can be some of the best teachers, if we are open to\nthem. They force us to reconsider the status quo and realign our perspectives.\nThey act as agents provocateurs that guard us from complacency and keep us on\nour toes. Lithium is doing all that. No scientific theory is perfect, and the\nBig Bang is no exception. It\u2019s only through the corners, the edges, and the\ngray areas that we have the opportunity to grow and expand our knowledge of\nthe universe.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

It can explain the\nexistence of ancient relic radiation. And it can explain the composition and\narrangement of matter throughout the cosmos.\n\nExcept lithium.\n\nLead image: Juan Roballo / Shutterstock\n\n  * ###### Paul M.
