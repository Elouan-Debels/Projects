The Biden\nadministration on Wednesday, April 10, 2024, finalized strict limits on\ncertain so-called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water that will require\nutilities to reduce them to the lowest level they can be reliably measured.\n(AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel, File)\n\nBy MICHAEL PHILLIS\n\nUpdated 9:05 AM UTC, April 10, 2024\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * X\n\n  * Reddit\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Flipboard\n\n  * Print\n\nThe Biden administration on Wednesday finalized strict limits on certain so-\ncalled \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water that will require utilities to\nreduce them to the lowest level they can be reliably measured. Officials say\nthis will reduce exposure for 100 million people and help prevent thousands of\nillnesses, including cancers.\n\nThe rule is the first national drinking water limit on toxic PFAS, or\nperfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which are widespread and long\nlasting in the environment.\n\nHealth advocates praised the Environmental Protection Agency for not backing\naway from tough limits the agency proposed last year. But water utilities took\nissue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and\nthat customers will end up paying more for water.\n\nWater providers are entering a new era with significant additional health\nstandards that the EPA says will make tap water safer for millions of\nconsumers \u2014 a Biden administration priority. The agency has also proposed\nforcing utilities to remove dangerous lead pipes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nEvers vetoes a Republican-backed bill targeting PFAS chemicals\n\nCourt approves 3M settlement over \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 in public drinking water\nsystems\n\nEPA bans asbestos, a deadly carcinogen still in use decades after a partial\nban was enacted\n\nUtility groups warn the rules will cost tens of billions of dollars each and\nfall hardest on small communities with fewer resources. Legal challenges are\nsure to follow.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan says the rule is the most important action the\nEPA has ever taken on PFAS.\n\n\u201cThe result is a comprehensive and life changing rule, one that will improve\nthe health and vitality of so many communities across our country,\u201d said\nRegan.\n\nPFAS chemicals are hazardous because they don\u2019t degrade in the environment and\nare linked to health issues such as low birth weight and kidney cancer.\nThey\u2019ve been used in everyday products including nonstick pans, firefighting\nfoam and waterproof clothing. Although some of the most common types are\nphased out in the U.S., others remain. Water providers will now be forced to\nremove contamination put in the environment by other industries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that accumulation that\u2019s the problem,\u201d said Scott Belcher, a North\nCarolina State University professor who researches PFAS toxicity. \u201cEven tiny,\ntiny, tiny amounts each time you take a drink of water over your lifetime is\ngoing to keep adding up, leading to the health effects.\u201d\n\nPFAS is a broad family of chemical substances, and the new rule sets strict\nlimits on two common types \u2014 called PFOA and PFOS \u2014 at 4 parts per trillion.\nThree other types that include GenEx Chemicals that are a major problem in\nNorth Carolina are limited to 10 parts per trillion. Water providers will have\nto test for these PFAS chemicals and tell the public when levels are too high.\nCombinations of some PFAS types will be limited, too.\n\nRegan will announce the rule in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental and health advocates praised the rule, but said PFAS\nmanufacturers knew decades ago the substances were dangerous yet hid or\ndownplayed the evidence. Limits should have come sooner, they argue.\n\n\u201cReducing PFAS in our drinking water is the most cost effective way to reduce\nour exposure,\u201d said Scott Faber, a food and water expert at Environmental\nWorking Group. \u201cIt\u2019s much more challenging to reduce other exposures such as\nPFAS in food or clothing or carpets.\u201d\n\nOver the last year, EPA has periodically released batches of utility test\nresults for PFAS in drinking water. Roughly 16% of utilities found at least\none of the two strictly limited PFAS chemicals at or above the new limits.\nThese utilities serve tens of millions of people. The Biden administration,\nhowever, expects about 6-10% of water systems to exceed the new limits.\n\nWater providers will generally have three years to do testing. If those test\nexceed the limits, they\u2019ll have two more years to install treatment systems,\naccording to EPA officials.\n\nSome funds are available to help utilities. Manufacturer 3M recently agreed to\npay more than $10 billion to drinking water providers to settle PFAS\nlitigation. And the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes billions to combat\nthe substance. But utilities say more will be needed.\n\nFor some communities, tests results were a surprise. Last June, a utility\noutside Philadelphia that serves nearly 9,000 people learned that one of its\nwells had a PFOA level of 235 parts per trillion, among the highest results in\nthe country at the time.\n\n\u201cI mean, obviously, it was a shock,\u201d said Joseph Hastings, director of the\njoint public works department for the Collegeville and Trappe boroughs, whose\njob includes solving problems presented by new regulations.\n\nThe well was quickly yanked offline, but Hastings still doesn\u2019t know the\ncontamination source. Several other wells were above the EPA\u2019s new limits, but\nlower than those the state of Pennsylvania set earlier. Now, Hastings says\ninstalling treatment systems could be a multi-million dollar endeavor, a major\nexpense for a small customer base.\n\nThe new regulation is \u201cgoing to throw public confidence in drinking water into\nchaos,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry\ncommunications firm.\n\nThe American Water Works Association, an industry group, says it supports the\ndevelopment of PFAS limits in drinking water, but argues the EPA\u2019s rule has\nbig problems.\n\nThe agency underestimated its high cost, which can\u2019t be justified for\ncommunities with low levels of PFAS, and it\u2019ll raise customer water bills, the\nassociation said. Plus, there aren\u2019t enough experts and workers \u2014 and supplies\nof filtration material are limited.\n\nWork in some places has started. The company Veolia operates utilities serving\nabout 2.3 million people across six eastern states and manages water systems\nfor millions more. Veolia built PFAS treatment for small water systems that\nserve about 150,000 people. The company expects, however, that roughly 50 more\nsites will need treatment \u2014 and it\u2019s working to scale up efforts to reduce\nPFAS in larger communities it serves.\n\nSuch efforts followed dramatic shifts in EPA\u2019s health guidance for PFAS in\nrecent years as more research into its health harms emerged. Less than a\ndecade ago, EPA issued a health advisory that PFOA and PFOS levels combined\nshouldn\u2019t exceed 70 parts per trillion. Now, the agency says no amount is\nsafe.\n\nPublic alarm has increased, too. In Minnesota, for example, Amara\u2019s Law aims\nto stop avoidable PFAS use. It\u2019s been nearly a year since the law\u2019s namesake,\nAmara Strande, died from a rare cancer her family blames on PFAS contamination\nby 3M near her high school in Oakdale, although a connection between PFAS and\nher cancer can\u2019t be proven. Biden administration officials say communities\nshouldn\u2019t suffer like Oakdale. 3M says it extends its deepest condolences to\nAmara\u2019s friends and family.\n\nLosing Amara pushed the family towards activism. They\u2019ve testified multiple\ntimes in favor of PFAS restrictions.\n\n\u201cFour parts per trillion, we couldn\u2019t ask for a better standard,\u201d Amara\u2019s\nsister Nora said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very ambitious goal, but anything higher than that\nis endangering lives.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nAssociated Press data journalist Camille Fassett in San Francisco and reporter\nMatthew Daly in Washington D.C. contributed to this story.\n\n## ___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for\ncoverage of water and environmental policy.
