But today, the SFMTA is eager to abandon its reliance on 51\u20444-inch\nfloppy disks\u2014just give it about six more years and a few hundred more million\ndollars.\n\nMembers of the SFMTA recently spoke with the ABC7 Bay Area News and detailed\nthe agency's use of three 51\u20444-inch floppy disks every morning. The floppies\nhave been part of Muni Metro's Automatic Train Control System (ATCS) since its\ninstallation in the Market Street subway stop in 1998. The ATCS has multiple\ncomponents, \"including computers onboard the trains that are tied into\npropulsion and brake systems, central and local servers, and communications\ninfrastructure, like loop cable signal wires,\" Michael Roccaforte, an SFMTA\nspokesperson, told Ars Technica.\n\nThe floppy disks are for loading the software running the central servers,\nRoccaforte said:\n\n> When a train enters the subway, its onboard computer connects to the train\n> control system to run the train in automatic mode, where the trains drive\n> themselves while the operators supervise. When they exit the subway, they\n> disconnect from the ATCS and return to manual operation on the street.\n\nRoccaforte said initial planning for an overhaul of the ATCS, including moving\noff floppy disks, started in 2018 and was expected to take a decade from\ninitial planning to completion. Because of an 18-month-long COVID-19-related\nhiatus, completion is expected in 2029 to 2030. SFMTA expects to settle on a\ncontractor by early 2025 and will release a detailed project timeline then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ultimately, our goal is to have a single train control system for the entire\nrail system,\" Jeffrey Tumlin, SFMTA's director of transportation, told ABC7.\n\n## Floppy flaws\n\n\"If it ain't broke don't fix it,\" some say. But while the floppy disk-reliant\ntrain control system is currently working, there are challenges to relying on\nthe dated technology, which SFMTA has highlighted for years.\n\nThe transportation body says the train control system was built to last for\njust 20 to 25 years, meaning it surpassed its expected lifetime in 2023. In\n2020, the Muni Reliability Working Group, said to be composed of local and\nnational transit experts, recommended replacing the transit control system\nwithin five to seven years.\n\nWhen asked how \"dire\" it is to upgrade off of floppy disks, Tumlin told ABC7\nthat it's all about risk.\n\n\"The system is currently working just fine, but we know that with each\nincreasing year, risk of data degradation on the floppy disks increases and\nthat at some point there will be a catastrophic failure,\" Tumlin told ABC7.\n\nPreviously, the transportation agency claimed that the ATCS had become harder\nand more expensive to maintain over time. It has also discussed the challenges\nit has in finding workers who know how to use the dated system.\n\n\"We have to maintain programmers who are experts in the programming languages\nof the '90s in order to keep running our current system, so we have a\ntechnical debt that stretches back many decades,\" Tumlin told San Francisco's\nKQED in February 2023.\n\nIn 2020, a company spokesperson told the San Francisco Chronicle that the\nSFMTA's transportation controller graduation rate at the time was 40 to 50\npercent.\n\nWhen asked if moving off floppies would result in job losses, Roccaforte told\nArs:\n\n> With the new train control system, there will still be plenty of work for\n> [current] staff, and they will be trained in the new technology. A key part\n> of our project strategy is to develop in-house skill sets and training for\n> existing staff. In addition, we\u2019ll [need] to hire more skilled positions,\n> such as signaling engineers, to help support the new train control system.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n79\n\nScharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Product Reviewer writing\nnews, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops,\nmechanical keyboards, and monitors.
