This access comes with the persistent threat of SSH password-\nguessing brute-force attacks (BFAs) directed at sshd-enabled devices connected\nto the Internet. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of such\nattacks on a production facility (CloudLab), offering previously unreported\ninsight. Our study provides a detailed analysis of SSH BFAs occurring on the\nInternet today through an in-depth analysis of sshd logs collected over a\nperiod of four years from over 500 servers. We report several patterns in\nattacker behavior, present insight on the targets of the attacks, and devise a\nmethod for tracking individual attacks over time across sources. Leveraging\nour insight, we develop a defense mechanism against SSH BFAs that blocks 99.5%\nof such attacks, significantly outperforming the 66.1% coverage of current\nstate-of-the-art rate-based blocking while also cutting false positives by\n83%. We have deployed our defense in production on CloudLab, where it catches\nfour-fifths of SSH BFAs missed by other defense strategies.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
