Walking the\nstreets of a new city, they come across a square where a group of people are\nworking in a communal open kitchen, serving delicious hot meals free of\ncharge.\n\nThe people enjoying the food come from all walks of life: rich, poor, young,\nold... Most patrons get their plates, say \u201cthank you\u201d, take their meals to one\nof the many tables and eat, making appreciative noises of satisfaction. Some\nleave a few coins in a jar as a token of their appreciation.\n\nBut not Jo. Jo grabs a plate, and after one bite says: \u201cIt\u2019s too hot! Too\nsalty! Too spicy! This dish has got no meat in it! I\u2019m not vegan!\u201d.\n\nThe people making and serving the meals, look at each other and then one says:\n\u201cThis is an open kitchen, my friend. Anyone can use it. Come! Join us. Here\nare the pots and the pans, vegetables, and meats. Here are the knives, the\nspatulas, a drum of oil, and some spices. Everything is free to use. You can\nmake a dish to your liking.\u201d\n\nJo doesn\u2019t budge and just yells back: \u201cI\u2019m no cook^*! That\u2019s your job!\u201d\n\nThe people running the kitchen respond: \u201cIt\u2019s not our \u2018job\u2019 either. We\u2019re\ndoing it for free to help others...\u201d.\n\nAt which point, Jo throws the plate on the floor and storms off to go and\ncomplain on Reddit.\n\n^* Not everybody has to be a cook in this metaphor. They can wash dishes,\nserve the patrons, contribute food to the collective... But Jo is having none\nof that either.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * Reddit\n  * Lemmy\n  * More\n\n  * Telegram\n  * Print\n  * Email\n\n  * This weekend I am contributing to Transitous.
