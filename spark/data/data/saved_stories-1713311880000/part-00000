All prices\nare subject to change, and this article only reflects the prices available at\ntime of publication.\n\nThe Radxa Zero 2 Pro is single-board computer with an Amlogic A311D processor\nfeaturing four ARM Cortex-A73 high-performance CPU cores, two Cortex-A53\nefficiency cores, Mali-G52 MP4 graphics, and a neural processing unit with up\nto 5 TOPS of on-device AI performance.\n\nIt also features a surprising amount of I/O features packed into a really tiny\npackage: the Radxa Zero 2 Pro measures just 65 x 36mm (2.6\u2032\u2032 x 1.4\u2032\u2032), making\nit just a little (6mm) wider than a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. But it\u2019s also\nsubstantially more expensive than Raspberry Pi\u2019s little computer.\n\nA Radxa Zero 2 Pro with 4GB of LPDDR4 memory and 16GB of eMMC 5.1 storage is\nnow available for $65 from Arace or Allnet China.\n\nTheoretically prices are supposed to start at $55 for model with 4GB of RAM\nand no storage, but that version isn\u2019t in stock yet. Higher priced\nconfigurations with up to 8GB of RAM and 32GB of storage are also listed, but\nunavailable at time of publication.\n\nEach version of the little computer features:\n\n  * 1 x USB 3.0 Type-C Host port\n  * 1 x USB 2.0 Type-C OTG/Host port\n  * 1 x micro HDMI 2.0 port (4K/60fps)\n  * 1 x microSD card reader\n  * 1 x MIPI-DSI display connector\n  * 1 x MIPI-CS camera connector\n  * 1 x 40-pin GPIO header\n\nThe Radxa Zero 2 Pro also supports WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 wireless\nconnectivity and has an external antenna connector. And there\u2019s an optional\nheat sink + fan that sells for less than $8.\n\nRadxa provides Debian and Ubuntu Server images for the board on its website,\nand there are Manjaro and Armbian images available from GitHub. The company\nsays the Zero 2 Pro should also support Android, but I don\u2019t see any builds of\nthat operating system available for download yet.\n\nYou can find more information and documentation for the Radxa Zero 2 Pro at\nthe Radxa wiki.\n\nvia Radxa Blog\n\n## Support Liliputing\n\nLiliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links\n(if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on\nAmazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).\n\nBut there are several ways you can support the site directly even if you're\nusing an ad blocker* and hate online shopping.\n\n### Contribute to our Patreon campaign\n\nor...\n\n### Contribute via PayPal\n\n* If you are using an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and seeing a pop-up message at the bottom of the screen, we have a guide that may help you disable it.\n\n## Subscribe to Liliputing via Email\n\nJoin 9,543 other subscribers\n\nTagged: radxa, radxa zero 2 pro, sbc\n\n## Join the Conversation\n\n12 Comments\n\nCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

AFAICT the\nA311D2 could definitely manage 8GB RAM but the A311D can manage a max. of\n4GB...\n\nReply\n\n  2. Upgrade pi-top [3] says:\n\n04/07/2024 at 10:09 AM\n\n@ifThenError, fair if you\u2019re looking for ARMv9 but are there other devices\navailable with this chip in this compact a form factor? Usually people want a\nZero for its sff.\n\nReply\n\n  3. persondb says:\n\n04/07/2024 at 12:04 AM\n\nRadxa is kinda of a mess. The Radxa Zero 3W is already out for months or more,\nso it feels odd that they are now basically re-releasing the never released(in\nfact) zero 2. And it\u2019s expensive enough that it doesn\u2019t really make much sense\nto get one of those over a RP5 or so. The A311D is quite good, but I don\u2019t\nthink it would be this good in this package.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Upgrade pi-top [3] says:\n\n04/06/2024 at 2:03 AM\n\n@ifThenError which more up to date chip were you looking for? The A311D has\npretty good mainline support and is actually quite performant compared with\nthe RPi4 and even 5...\n\nReply\n\n    1. ifThenError says:\n\n04/06/2024 at 7:59 AM\n\nWell that\u2019s the issue! The A311D was released about 5 years ago and uses an 8\nyear old CPU design. Ever since it\u2019s been very very quiet on the AML side. The\nonly newer chip I\u2019m aware of is the S928X and it still uses a 5 year old Arm\nv8 CPU.\n\nGuess I was hoping we\u2019d finally see a device with an at least somewhat up to\ndate processor.\n\nAnd of course software support matures with older chips, that\u2019s the dilemma.\nStill there are already devices with this chip available, but there are\nexactly none with an Arm v9 CPU.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Upgrade pi-top [3] says:\n\n04/05/2024 at 1:57 AM\n\nAlso, the infographic from Radxa indicates there will be up to 128Gb eMMC\nversions available. Is it really only eMMC 4.1, rather than 5.1? Strangely,\nthere doesn\u2019t seem to be an introductory thread from Radxa about the Zero 2\nPro on their forum...\n\nReply\n\n    1. Brad Linder says:\n\n04/05/2024 at 5:58 AM\n\nWhoops, that was a typo. It has eMMC 5.1 storage.\n\nReply\n\n  6. Upgrade pi-top [3] says:\n\n04/05/2024 at 1:42 AM\n\nAn A311D with 8Gb RAM?! I thought the maximum it could carry was 4Gb?\n\nReply\n\n  7. ifThenError says:\n\n04/04/2024 at 5:48 PM\n\nIt\u2019s 2024 and we are still seeing new boards with Cortex A73s and A52s... Will\nthe SBC community never move to A715s?\n\nAlso I think the first picture might show the (previous gen) Radxa Zero. At\nleast the SOC is labeled S905Y2.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Brad Linder says:\n\n04/04/2024 at 5:58 PM\n\nWhoops. That image came from the Zero 2 Pro listing at Allnet China, but\nyou\u2019re right, it appears to be the wrong model!\n\nReply\n\n      1. ifThenError says:\n\n04/05/2024 at 1:55 PM\n\nYeah, never trust AliExpress and Allnet China. Quite many dubious informations\nthere.\n\nThe other pics however really seem to show a new model with almost identical\nlayout, but indeed another chip. But I still think the outdated chip is\nsomething of a disappointment.\n\nReply\n\n  8. Sword says:\n\n04/04/2024 at 1:21 PM\n\nFinally a smaller than a full size pi with MIPI-DSI. Too expensive for me, but\nI like the trend.\n\nReply\n\n## Follow\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n  * AMD launches Ryzen PRO 8040 mobile and Ryzen PRO 8000 desktop chips with Ryzen AI\n\n  * Lilbits: Apple allows game console emulators in the App Store now... but not this one\n\n  * GMK NucBox K9 is an Intel Meteor Lake mini PC with Thunderbolt 4 and 2.5 GbE LAN\n\n## Latest Deals\n\n  * Daily Deals (4-12-2024)\n\nDisclosure: Some links on this page may be monetized by Skimlinks and Amazon's\nand eBay's affiliate programs.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Liliputing.
