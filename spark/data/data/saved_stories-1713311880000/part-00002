may\nbe bouncing back\n\nPublished Tue, Apr 16 20241:25 PM EDT\n\nRohan Goswami@in/rohangoswamicnbc/@rogoswami\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Andreessen Horowitz raised $7.2 billion for several funds, the bulk of which will go towards late-stage, or growth, investments.\n  * The firm is reeling in hefty amounts of cash while the broader startup and IPO markets remain depressed.\n  * Andreessen Horowitz didn't announce any further fundraising for its crypto arm.\n\nMarc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz\n\nGetty Images\n\nAndreessen Horowitz said Tuesday that it raised $7.2 billion across five\ndifferent funds, a sign of optimism in the tech startup world, which has seen\na dearth of significant exits over the past two years.\n\n\"This marks an important milestone for us,\" Ben Horowitz, who co-founded the\nfirm with Marc Andreessen in 2009, wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe biggest chunk of new funding is in Andreessen Horowitz's growth fund,\nwhich reeled in $3.75 billion. That money gets invested in later-stage\ncompanies that are viewed as closer to going public, or capital-intensive\nbusinesses that require big checks.\n\nHorowitz said in the post that $1.25 billion will be dedicated to\ninfrastructure, which includes artificial intelligence investments, while $1\nbillion will go to app investments, $600 million to games and another $600\nmillion to what the firm calls American Dynamism, or \"founders and companies\nthat support the national interest.\" That includes aerospace, defense,\neducation and housing.\n\nThe firm had initially aimed to raise $6.9 billion from investors for a new\nset of funds, including two with an AI focus, Bloomberg previously reported.\nAI investing has been red hot in Silicon Valley and beyond, while the broader\nmarket has been in a downturn.\n\nSince 2021, when tech IPOs and startup investing surged to a record, venture\ninvestors have closed their wallets. Soaring inflation and rising interest\nrates in 2022 pushed investors out of risky assets and forced cash-burning\nstartups to dramatically cut costs. Even with the stock market recovering,\nventure deals have remained depressed.\n\nDeal volume for U.S. venture investments in the first quarter sank to its\nlowest level since 2017, according to data published earlier this month by\nPitchBook. The story was similar across the globe, with worldwide volume\nreaching its lowest since 2016 and total deal value falling to a level not\nseen since 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been very few tech IPOs since the end of 2021. Reddit\nand Astera Labs went public in the first quarter, the first venture-backed\ntech companies to debut since September. They accounted for 73.4% of total\nexit value in the U.S. in the period, according to PitchBook.\n\nHorowitz made no reference to the market slowdown in his post. Nor did he\nsuggest that any new funding will be dedicated to cryptocurrencies, an area\nwhere Andreessen Horowitz was particularly bullish during the crypto craze\nthat lifted bitcoin to a record in 2021. The firm raised a $4.5 billion crypto\nfund in 2022, bringing its total amount raised for crypto and blockchain\ninvestments to $7.6 billion.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz remains on track to raise more money for its crypto fund\nand a separate biotechnology fund, a person familiar with the matter told\nBloomberg. The firm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne of Andreessen Horowitz's more notable bets of the past couple years\ninvolved WeWork's controversial co-founder Adam Neumann and his new startup\ncalled Flow. Andreessen Horowitz wrote a $350 million check to the company,\nwhich was just getting started and has yet to make inroads in the residential\nreal estate market.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz said in a blog post at the time that Neumann's efforts to\nredesign the office experience at WeWork are \"often under appreciated\" and\nthat the firm loves \"seeing repeat-founders build on past successes by growing\nfrom lessons learned.\"\n\nWATCH: Adam Neumann deserves second shot, CEO says\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:2602:26\n\nAdam Neumann deserves a 'second shot', says RSE Ventures CEO\n\nThe Exchange\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
