Put that credit card away.\n\nIt\u2019s completely free to use while we continue to roll out Blip. Going forward,\nwe want to keep Blip free for personal use. We may introduce paid plans for\ncommercial use or special features.\n\nAbsolutely not, don't be silly ;-)\n\nReally fast. The Blip high-speed network supports multi-gigabit speeds, even\nover long distances where other services slow down.\n\nBecause there are no separate \u201cupload\u201c and \u201cdownload\u201c steps, sending with Blip\ncan be at least twice as fast as many other services, because the recipient\nwill start receiving right away rather than having to wait for you to finish\nuploading.\n\nNow, Blip might seem like magic, but it can\u2019t break the laws of physics!\nPerformance will be affected by the upload speed of the sender\u2019s internet plan\nand the download speed of the recipient\u2019s internet plan.\n\nWe built \u201cLAN direct connect\u201d into Blip to boost speeds when both devices are\nconnected to the same network, e.g. between devices in the same building.\nThese transfers will be unconstrained by your internet plan.\n\nBlip transfers files directly to the other person, so it\u2019s way (way) faster\nthan waiting for files to upload and then be downloaded from file sharing\nsites.\n\nAnd unlike file sharing sites, with Blip there are no insecure links to your\nfiles floating around.\n\nRead more info about Blip as an alternative to WeTransfer.\n\nLike the big guys, Blip squeezes high performance from your network\nconnection, but is also simple and straightforward.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to download and set up Blip by yourself. You don\u2019t need to \u201ctalk to\nsales\u201d, set up special servers, or pay a $10,000 minimum!\n\nYou can be sending files with Blip, for free, in under a minute.\n\nRead more info about Blip as an alternative to Aspera.\n\nBlip doesn\u2019t store your files in the cloud. This means you won\u2019t run into\nspace limitations, and can organize your files however you like. You don\u2019t\nhave to keep files in a special folder to be able to share them.\n\nAnd unlike cloud storage, Blip is very external drive friendly\u2014in fact, it\u2019s\ndesigned for them.\n\nRead more info about Blip as an alternative to Dropbox.\n\nApple\u2019s \u201cAirDrop\u201d and Google\u2019s \u201cNearby Share\u201d can be really handy. However\nthey have some important limitations: they aren\u2019t compatible with each other,\nand require devices to be physically nearby. They are also unreliable when\ntransferring very large files, and will often lose your progress.\n\nBlip doesn\u2019t need devices to be nearby, so it\u2019s much more reliable. Blip works\nwherever your internet connected devices are in the world, and works\nregardless of what kind of device you own. You can transfer from Android to\nMac, Windows to iPhone, and much more.\n\nNo, because Blip doesn\u2019t upload your files to the web! Web links can be slow,\ninsecure, and hard to keep track of.\n\nInstead, with Blip you send directly to other Blip users in real-time.\n\nBlip is designed with security in mind. It doesn\u2019t use insecure web links. The\nthings you share are sent directly to the person you choose, without being\nuploaded to a website somewhere.\n\nFiles you send are encrypted in transit, to protect from nosy neighbours.\n\nYes! Unlike many other services, Blip can send Final Cut Pro .fcpbundle files\nwithout needing to zip them first.\n\n.fcpbundle files are technically folders, and Blip fully preserves folder\nstructures and any links within.\n\nAnd of course, Blip works regardless of the tool you use, be it Final Cut Pro,\nAdobe Premiere, or something else entirely.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
