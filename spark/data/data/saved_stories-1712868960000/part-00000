A total of $12.5bn (\u00a310bn) was embezzled, the\nequivalent of almost 3% of Vietnamese gross domestic product, but prosecutors\nsaid on Thursday the total damages caused by the scam now amounted to $27bn.\n\n\u201cThe defendant\u2019s actions ... eroded people\u2019s trust in the leadership of the\n[Communist] party and state,\u201d read the verdict at the trial in Ho Chi Minh\nCity.\n\nLan was found guilty of swindling money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) over\na decade. She had been on tried alongside 85 others, including former central\nbankers and government officials, as well as previous SCB executives.\n\nThe trial is part of a national corruption crackdown led by the secretary\ngeneral of the Communist party of Vietnam, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng. The campaign,\nwhich is also known as \u201cBlazing Furnace\u201d and has increased in recent years,\nhas led to the indictment of thousands of people, as well as the resignation\nof two presidents and two deputy prime ministers.\n\nLan, who was arrested in October 2022, had denied the charges. A relative told\nReuters before the verdict that she would appeal. The death sentence is an\nunusually severe punishment for a corruption case.\n\nState media reported last week that Lan told the court she had joined the\nbanking industry without sufficient experience and blamed a \u201clack of\nunderstanding of legal matters\u201d. She said she had \u201cthought of death\u201d in\ndesperation, and asked the court for leniency for her husband, a Hong Kong\nbusinessman, and niece who were on trial as accomplices.\n\nThe verdicts announced on Thursday followed a five-week trial that has been\ncovered in great detail in Vietnam\u2019s tightly controlled state media.\n\nDocuments related to the trial, kept in 105 boxes, weighed 6 tonnes, according\nto VN Express, which reported the authorities had installed security cameras\nand fire safety equipment to protect the evidence ahead of the hearings. More\nthan 1,000 properties belonging to Lan have been seized, and nearly 2,700\nindividuals were summoned for the trial, which included 200 lawyers.\n\nDr Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme at\nthe Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, said the case was unprecedented, and a\nmilestone in Vietnam\u2019s anti-corruption crackdown. It was, he said, \u201cthe\nbiggest case against a private business, with the biggest number of\ndefendants, the biggest number of evidence and of course, the biggest number\nof money involved\u201d.\n\nAlthough Lan did not directly hold executive power at SCB, she owned 91.5% of\nthe bank\u2019s shares through third parties and shell companies.\n\nShe was accused of setting up fake loan applications to withdraw money from\nthe bank over a period of 11 years, from 2012 to 2022. The loans accounted for\n93% of the total credit the bank has issued, according to state media.\n\nTo cover up the fraud, Lan and other SCB bankers were accused of giving state\nofficials $5.2m, the largest bribe recorded in Vietnam. The money was handed\nover in Styrofoam boxes, Do Thi Nhan, a former chief banking inspector at the\nState Bank of Vietnam, said during the trial. Nhan said that after realising\nthe boxes contained money, she refused the boxes but that Lan declined to take\nthem back, state media reported.\n\nSince 2021, thousands of people have been indicted for corruption in the\ncountry, in what analysts have described as the most comprehensive anti-\ncorruption effort in the history of the Communist party of Vietnam.\n\nLast month, the Vietnamese government announced the resignation of its second\npresident in as many years, Vo Van Thuong, over alleged \u201cviolations and flaws\u201d\nthat had \u201cnegatively affected public perception, as well as the reputation of\nthe party and the state\u201d. He had been in power for just over a year after his\npredecessor, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, was forced out because of corruption scandals\ninvolving officials under his control.\n\nEvaluating public sentiment in Vietnam, a one-party state, is challenging.\nHowever, social media comments suggested many were shocked by the scale of the\nscandal, said Giang. While some welcomed the state crackdown, others questions\nhow corruption on such a huge scale could go unchecked for so long.\n\n\u201c[The case] might indirectly signal that the state hasn\u2019t really been doing\nwell in terms of managing the system in terms of the increasingly complex\nmarket economy and also the state is incapable of controlling their own public\nofficials,\u201d said Giang.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Vietnam\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
