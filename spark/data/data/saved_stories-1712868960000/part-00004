Starting this fall, owners of an iPhone 15 or newer will be able to\nget their broken devices fixed with used parts \u2014 including screens, batteries\nand cameras \u2014 without any change in functionality.\n\nWhen an iPhone breaks, owners have historically had three options: They can\nget it repaired using expensive new replacement parts from Apple, aftermarket\nparts made by third-party suppliers, or used parts pulled from other iPhones.\nThe catch? If you take either of the latter two routes, the parts won\u2019t work\nexactly the same as the originals.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThese limitations have long frustrated repair shops, researchers and consumer\nadvocates who say these practices can scare people away from cheaper,\nindependent fixes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple won\u2019t supply repair shops or technicians with used parts, John Ternus,\nthe company\u2019s senior vice president of hardware engineering, said in an\ninterview. And this shift in policy won\u2019t apply to older versions of the\niPhone.\n\nStill, the change could be especially helpful for people who can\u2019t afford\nApple Store prices for an out-of-warranty repair, or for those whose most\nconvenient repair option is a local shop.\n\nApple\u2019s about-face is a big change, one that\u2019s been in the works for years,\nTernus said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn older versions of the iPhone, replacing certain parts with components\nharvested from other iPhones yields an on-screen warning and a disabling of\nsome features. Swap a screen from one iPhone into another, for example, and\nthe True Tone feature \u2014 which makes colors on your screen look more natural \u2014\nstops working. That would happen even if that replacement screen came from a\nnew iPhone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s because these parts are effectively locked to the device they came with\noriginally \u2014 a practice commonly known as \u201cparts pairing.\u201d Historically, the\nonly way to restore full functionality is for an authorized repair person to\nuse new Apple parts that the company has certified through a \u201csystem\nconfiguration\u201d process.\n\nGoing forward, Apple says, that configuration will happen right on the phone\nand won\u2019t require a repair person to provide a part\u2019s serial number.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe company also announced on Thursday that it is extending its anti-theft\nActivation Lock feature to the parts inside iPhones. If you get your phone\nfixed by a less than scrupulous repair outfit that used parts from a stolen\niPhone, those parts can\u2019t be configured to work correctly.\n\nTernus told The Post that Apple engineers from across the country have had to\nfigure out how to change the design of products, their components and the\nmanufacturing process \u201cto enable the use of used parts without compromising.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, these changes will make it a little less tricky \u2014 and a little less\nexpensive \u2014 to get a busted iPhone running as well as before.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed, however, is Apple\u2019s approach to aftermarket replacement\nparts built by other companies. If one of these components \u2014 say, a\nreplacement battery or screen \u2014 is used to fix an iPhone, the owner will\ncontinue to see a warning that the part may not be \u201cgenuine\u201d and that related\nfeatures like True Tone or the battery health readout will not work.\n\nTernus said Apple \u201ctotally believes that third-party parts should be usable in\nrepair\u201d as long as the use of those parts is disclosed to a device\u2019s owner.\nBut the reason those aftermarket parts in iPhones won\u2019t work the same as\noriginal parts do, he added, is because Apple doesn\u2019t know how to calibrate\nthem to work as the company intended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven so, the company may have no choice but to more fully embrace parts it\ndoesn\u2019t make.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn late March, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D) signed into law a right-to-repair\nbill that includes one strict requirement missing from similar legislation in\nstates like New York, Minnesota and California.\n\nThe law, which is set to take effect in January 2025, would prevent device\nmakers like Apple from using parts pairing to deter people and repair shops\nfrom using third-party replacement parts.\n\nThe law also specifically says that companies can\u2019t use parts-pairing\npractices to \u201creduce the functionality or performance of consumer electronic\nequipment.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a first for right-to-repair laws in the United States and seemingly\nrequires Apple to ensure that iPhones repaired with aftermarket or third-party\nreplacement parts act identically to ones full of genuine Apple components.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Apple might approach this requirement on a technical level\nbecause it has no control over the companies building their own replacement\nscreens and batteries.\n\nNeither Ternus nor Apple spokespeople commented on what changes may have to be\nmade to abide by Oregon law, but the company said in an earlier statement that\nthe bill\u2019s language \u201cintroduces the possibility that Apple would be required\nto allow unknown, non-secure third-party Face ID or Touch ID modules to\nunlock\u201d a user\u2019s personal information.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to support repair legislation, but strongly believe this\nbill does not offer the consumer protections Oregonians deserve,\u201d the company\nsaid at the time.\n\nCompanies that violate the law are subject fines of up to $1,000 per day \u2014 a\ndrop in the bucket considering iPhones generated nearly $70 billion in revenue\nfor Apple last quarter. With enforcement set to begin in July 2027, the ball\nis in Apple\u2019s court to further expand its repair plans, push back or let the\nfines pile up.\n\n### Help Desk: Making tech work for you\n\nHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and\ntake control of the technology used in everyday life.\n\nTake control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and\nadvice on how to make your tech a force for good.\n\nTech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation online\n\nData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.
