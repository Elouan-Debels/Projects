We updated\n> this post on April 7 in relation to the great \"More Agents Is All You Need\"\n> paper.\n\n#### Introduction\n\nAs users become more familiar with AI language models, the limitations of the\nmodels can become increasingly apparent and frustrating, leading to a desire\nfor more intelligent and controllable AI interactions. Beam, a groundbreaking\nchat modality in big-AGI, addresses this need by enabling users to easily\nengage multiple models simultaneously, fuse their best responses, and achieve\nbetter output, wiser decisions with lower risk and reduced AI hallucinations.\n\n#### What is Beam?\n\nBeam is a new chat modality in big-AGI that leverages multiple AI models from\ndiverse families simultaneously. Users Beam a chat message for:\n\n  * better brainstorming and idea generation abilities\n  * more informed decisions, with more breadth of exploration\n  * to dilute and reduce the incidence of LLM hallucinations\n  * higher-stake outputs that far exceed cost tradeoffs\n\nWhen engaging in a Beam chat the user sends a message to Beam (Ctrl + Enter)\ninstead of just a single LLM. This is represented in the diagram below.\n\nBeam generates responses from user-selected models independently, then\nsynthesizes them using advanced merging techniques to produce a single,\ncoherent and comprehensive output.\n\n#### Achieve next-gen LLM performance with today's models.\n\nAndrew Ng, a recognized leader in AI, stated that \"[...] you may be able to\nget closer to (GPT-5) level of performance with agentic reasoning and an\nearlier model\".\n\nRecently, the \"More Agents Is All You Need\" paper has measured model\nperformance improvements when running multiple instances of the same model.\nSimilarly to Beam, both techniques involve a sampling and a voting phase,\nhowever Beam goes further by using AI to analyze and fuse the best part of\neach answer, and by using diverse model families altogether, which provides\nstronger diversification benefits.\n\nBeam shows that it is possible to exceed today's level of performance of GPT\nmodels, and its design will likely allow to always stay ahead. Beam is\ndesigned with principles of human guidance for system stability, parallelism\nfor time-saving, dynamic interfaces for bird's-eye-view decision-making, and\northogonality to maximize the strengths of diverse LLM families, effectively\nbringing \"The Wisdom of Crowds\" to the LLM world.\n\n> \\- \"This is really a big deal and it yields better results than the current\n> leading models\" - Discord - \"This is incredible. I can't praise the Devs\n> enough for releasing this tech.\" - Discord - \"It eliminates a huge number of\n> hallucinations and bad answers.\" - Reddit\n\n## Technology\n\nWe illustrate the technology with a special kind of text generation: Code.\nLanguage models text outputs tend to be verbose, too persuasive, and too\nsingular and time consuming to compare in an article. Thus, we requested\nHTML/CSS code, which makes it for an easier at-a-glance evaluation. A short\nvideo example here.\n\n### The exploration: Beaming\n\nBig-AGI allows you to Beam your chat message to multiple models. You can also\nrefine and improve your conversation history by Beaming previous messages.\nThis phase alone allows:\n\n  * Brainstormers to explore a wider range of ideas and perspectives, sparking creativity and innovation\n  * Researchers to gather more comprehensive information, ensuring no stone is left unturned, by tapping into the collective knowledge of various AI engines\n\nTo illustrate the power of beaming, let's consider a code example. We asked\ndifferent LLM families: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and Mistral, to \"Make a cool\nlooking capybara shape animation using css in an html file\".\n\n> Beaming - the responses generated by the AI models vary in their\n> effectiveness: the OpenAI and Google models fail to resemble a capybara,\n> while the Mistral model, though interesting and eye-catchy, misses the mark.\n> The Anthropic Claude 3 Opus model is the closest but still needs refinement.\n\nThe first phase of Beam is a UX feature that allows the user to quickly gather\na diverse set of relevant responses without any intelligent analysis, yet. In\nthis initial phase, the user can easily probe multiple models independently,\nas many times as they want, to explore the solution space and narrow it down\nto a set of relevant options.\n\nBeam's side-by-side comparison already allows for quick evaluation of each\nmodel's output, whether it's a legal document, code or a story, saving time\nand effort in identifying the most promising starting points for further\ndevelopment.\n\n### The secret: Fusions\n\nThe power of Beam lies in its ability to fuse the disparate responses from\nmultiple LLM into a cohesive, optimized answer that leverages the best of\neach. This is where the second phase of Beam comes into play, Fusions. In the\nFusions phase, Beam uses LLMs to analyze the generated responses, identify\ntheir key components, and intelligently combine them to create a unified,\nsuperior answer. Fusion enables:\n\n  * Decision-makers to arrive at a clear, well-justified course of action, by synthesizing the most relevant and insightful elements of each answer.\n  * Coders to get to a more robust, optimized solution, by leveraging the strengths of different AI models and filtering out the noise.\n\nAt the introduction, four options are available for this phase:\n\n  * Fusion auto-selects the optimal parts of all answers to satisfy the original user's query.\n  * Checklist lets the user choose the merge strategy after identifying the orthogonal components of the answers.\n  * Compare helps the user decide which AI-generated could be closer to their needs by creating a comparison table.\n  * Custom uses a user-decided merge strategy to amalgamate in a specific manner.\n\nTo showcase the power of fusions, let's apply two Fusion Merges to the earlier\nfour AI-generated animations.\n\n> Fusion Merge - asking two different models to fuse the 4 AI-generated\n> responses. Notice how both converged to a more 'cool' (as requested by the\n> user) result than any of the starting options.\n\nIn this example, both the Claude 3 Opus (left) and OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (0125)\nmodels have successfully synthesized a more visually appealing and coherent\nanimation than four starting AI-generated options. The merged animations are\nmore visually appealing and closely resemble the desired user outcome.\n\nWhat this means for the user, is that they can now go beyond what's possible\nwith the best available single model, which is particularly useful for high-\nstakes chat sessions.\n\nWhen more is at stake, such as when writing a legal document, planning a\nvacation, or conceiving a complex software architecture, you now have the\nability to harness the collective intelligence, leveraging the proverbial\nWisdom of Crowds.\n\n> This is a groundbreaking step forward in the field of AI interactions, and\n> something we believe every chat should implement for their users.\n\n#### The extra kicker: Guided merge\n\nThe Guided merge provides the user with a simple check-list to choose the\ndirections in which to move the search for the perfect answer.\n\nThis merge breaks down all all the responses into their principal orthogonal\ncomponents, which is as intellectually challenging as illuminating.\n\n> Checklist Merge - the user is presented with key insights from the analysis\n> of all the AI-generated answers. In this particular case the user chooses to\n> combine answers according to specific criteria: \"Basic capybara shape\",\n> \"Blinking eyes\", and \"Up and down movement\".\n\nThis merge is fascinating as it brings principal component analysis from the\nrealm of statistics into linguistics, but we will zoom in on those at an\nappropriate time and blog.\n\nFor the user this means that they have an additional tool to enrich their\nunderstanding about what are the basic component that matter in the answer\nthey are searching.\n\n> This is a novel AI interaction, and a leap into a future where the user\n> points the AI in a precise direction at each new step.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBeam enables users to achieve next-gen LLM performance with today's models.
