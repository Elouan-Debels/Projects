Since the pandemic, Airbnb\nhad overtaken an estimated 39,000 rental units, hollowing out neighborhoods\nand causing already-high rents to grow even higher.\n\n\u201cYou would see tourists on the streets in neighborhoods where there weren\u2019t\nany hotels,\u201d recalls New York-based artist and activist Murray Cox. The sound\nof rolling suitcases could be heard at all hours. Once tight-knit communities\nbegan to feel lifeless. When Cox ran the numbers on his own neighborhood \u2014\nBed-Stuy in Brooklyn \u2014 he found about 1,000 listings. Cox also heard horror\nstories from other parts of the city. \u201cPeople would move into a building and\nthen find that the building was full of tourists day in and day out,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIn some cases, they would be so uncomfortable they\u2019d feel forced to leave.\u201d\n\nNew York City\u2019s crackdown on Airbnbs is part of a growing trend.

A\nseries of bold requirements capped the total number of short-term rentals\n(STRs) and limited guests to just two at a time. They required STR operators\nto be primary homeowners \u2014 and to be present in the home while hosting. The\ncity also promised to enforce those requirements, a move that would wipe out\nnearly 90 percent of active listings at the time.\n\nThough it may sound revolutionary, New York\u2019s crackdown isn\u2019t the first of its\nkind. In fact, it\u2019s part of a growing trend \u2014 one largely spearheaded by much\nsmaller towns. Over the last decade, communities from Irvine, California, to\nDurango, Colorado, have implemented clever regulations, taxes and zoning\npolicies to hobble the STR market \u2014 or, in some cases, eliminate it\naltogether. As the success stories pile up, a growing body of research points\nto the dramatic positive impacts of policies like these, including lower\nrents, more equitable housing markets and the promise of a sustainable tourism\neconomy.\n\nWhen Airbnb was founded more than a decade ago, it was heralded as the\nharbinger of a new sharing economy. In theory, home-sharing platforms \u2014\nincluding Airbnb, Couchsurfing, VRBO, FlipKey and Homestay \u2014 would put\nunderutilized bedrooms to use, matching budget-conscious travelers with locals\nin need of a little extra cash. The system would funnel tourism dollars into\nsmall towns in a more equitable way. It seemed like a win-win. But within a\nfew years, one clear loser emerged: communities.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take very long for people to realize the sharing economy was\nbasically a scam,\u201d explains Cox, who later went on to found data-sharing\nplatform Inside Airbnb. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t using that car that was sitting in the\ndriveway to drive Uber. And people weren\u2019t just renting out a sofa or a spare\nbedroom.\u201d Instead, people saw an economic opportunity they could invest in.\nAnd they started buying whole homes to rent out on Airbnb.\n\nIn many cases, speculators and investment companies were buying multiple homes\nexpressly for short-term rental use. According to Cox, about two-thirds of\nAirbnb rentals in the US are in a property portfolio, which means the host\nowns and rents more than one property. And the top one percent of operators\nhave more than 300,000 Airbnb listings among them \u2014 a stat that points to huge\nconglomerates gobbling up the market.\n\nIn September of 2023, New York City enacted bold requirements that capped the\ntotal number of short-term rentals and limited guests to just two at a time.\nCredit: RightFramePhotoVideo / Shutterstock\n\nThese days, Airbnb isn\u2019t just a way to share underutilized bedrooms; it\u2019s big\nbusiness.\n\nRight now, about 90 percent of Airbnbs in Bozeman, Montana, and Nashville,\nTennessee \u2014 both popular vacation spots \u2014 are whole homes. Both Bozeman and\nNashville are also relatively small towns with exploding local populations and\nlimited housing stock. That means that every home set aside for a year-round\nSTR listing is a home unavailable to local residents struggling to find \u2014 and\nafford \u2014 housing. In extreme cases, the STR explosion has forced longtime\nlocals to move away. The so-called \u201cAirbnb Effect\u201d can hollow out once-vibrant\ncommunities.\n\nThis effect is most visible in popular vacation hot spots. In Hawaii, for\nexample, out-of-towners have bought up so many homes that few are left for\nNative Hawaiians.\n\n### Crushed by negative news?\n\nSign up for the Reasons to be Cheerful newsletter.\n\n\u201cOn Maui alone, 52 percent of homes are sold to nonresidents, and 60 percent\nof condos and apartments have gone to investors and second homeowners,\u201d writes\nStanford researcher Noah Jordan Magbual in a recent report. \u201cThe once\nindigenous population of the Hawaiian archipelago are now outcasts in their\nown home.\u201d\n\nThe Airbnb Effect also impacts bigger urban areas. In 2015, one study found\nthat STRs had sucked at least 10 percent of New York\u2019s available housing off\nthe market. Another New York study showed that this reduction in supply led to\nrent increases of up to hundreds of dollars per year. In Barcelona, the effect\nis even more severe, with rents rising by seven percent and housing costs\nrising by up to 17 percent in popular neighborhoods.\n\nFor some cities, the proliferation of STRs has become more than just an\neconomic issue; it\u2019s existential. That\u2019s especially true in New Orleans, the\nlongtime home of Jeffrey Goodman, an urban planner and consultant who\nspecializes in STRs.\n\nCredit: Mr. Nixter\n\nTourists are drawn to New Orleans for culture: art, food, music and more. But\nthe city is becoming less and less affordable for the people who make those\nthings possible.\n\n\u201cWe were one of the earlier cities to experience the growth in short-term\nrentals,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in a unique place because so much of what\nwe sell is culture. It\u2019s art. It\u2019s food. But the people who make the art and\ncook the food and play the trumpets have a hard time living here.\u201d So, if the\nlocals who make New Orleans special are forced to move away, what\u2019s left?\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of cities asking themselves this question,\u201d says Goodman.\n\u201cAre we a city anymore or are we just Disneyland?\u201d\n\nAccording to Goodman, the Airbnb Effect is stronger in small communities, like\nmountain towns or beach towns, which tend to have limited housing stock, high\nhome prices and little flexibility to adapt to fluctuations in housing\navailability. That may be why small towns were among the first to fight back.\n\nIn 2014, Durango \u2014 a town of 20,000 in southwestern Colorado \u2014 passed a series\nof regulations to combat what one local newspaper called \u201cThe Airbnb\nApocalypse.\u201d The town, an adventure epicenter for mountain bikers, climbers,\nskiers and other outdoor sports enthusiasts, isn\u2019t just a tourist magnet. It\u2019s\nalso home to Fort Lewis College, a premiere university for Native American\nstudents and Colorado locals. That was an experience Durango was anxious to\nprotect.\n\nDurango\u2019s 2014 regulations banned STRs outright in student neighborhoods. They\nalso limited STRs to two percent of the housing stock elsewhere.\n\nTourists ride the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad along the Animas\nRiver.

Today, he says, STRs make up just 1.4\npercent of the city\u2019s total housing stock. They just aren\u2019t really an issue\nanymore.\n\nA year later, Santa Monica \u2014 an affluent California beach town of 90,000 \u2014\npassed its own ordinances, banning STRs offering stays of less than 30 days\nfor an entire home. The city also extended its 14-percent hotel tax to STR\noperators and made it illegal to operate them without a valid business\nlicense. According to one estimate, the ordinance has since dropped the city\u2019s\nnumber of Airbnb listings by 61 percent, potentially returning more than 1,000\nhomes to the long-term rental or purchasing markets.\n\nMany of these novel STR policies look great on paper, but the truth is that\nthey\u2019re hard to enforce. Few cities have spent more time thinking about this\nissue than San Francisco.\n\nSan Francisco-based housing activist Dale Carlson first heard about the Airbnb\nEffect back in 2014, when the city was undergoing a major housing\naffordability crisis. When he learned that nearly five percent of the city\u2019s\nlimited housing stock was devoted to Airbnbs, he decided to get involved.\n\nCarlson helped bring together a coalition of tenants, hotels and property\nrights groups. By 2015, they\u2019d successfully lobbied for a city ordinance that\nrequired hosts to register their STRs, have a business license and pay hotel\ntaxes. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nCredit: Dale Cruse / Flickr\n\nCities across American watched as San Francisco enacted its platform-\naccountability policies. Now, some of those cities have enacted policies of\ntheir own.\n\n\u201cWe still ended up with 15,000 or 16,000 listings,\u201d Carlson says. So, his\ngroup asked voters to get behind an entirely new concept: the principle of\nplatform accountability.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that [the rental platform] can list and or rent anything it\nwants, but it can only collect a booking fee on the stuff that\u2019s legal,\u201d\nCarlson explains. If passed, the ballot measure would put the onus on Airbnb \u2014\nnot the city \u2014 to police unregistered and therefore illegal listings. Airbnb\nfought the initiative, and it fought hard.\n\n\u201cWe were defeated in the ballot. Airbnb spent close to $10 million\u2014they\noutspent us 20 to 1,\u201d Carlson says. But despite the heavy spending, Airbnb\nbarely eked out the win. \u201cSo many people had told us, \u2018You\u2019re never going to\nbeat them because they\u2019re too big and powerful,\u2019\u201d Carlson says. \u201cBut suddenly\nthey didn\u2019t look so powerful. And we didn\u2019t seem so vulnerable.\u201d\n\n### Become a sustaining member today!\n\nJoin the Reasons to be Cheerful community by supporting our nonprofit\npublication and giving what you can.\n\nJoin\n\nCarlson\u2019s coalition reworked the initiative and tried again. The next time,\nthe ballot measure passed. Within a few months, Carlson says, Airbnb listings\nin the city had dropped by about 90 percent. Cities across America were\nwatching. Others, like Boston and New York, ultimately adopted platform-\naccountability policies of their own.\n\nAnother important aspect of San Francisco\u2019s policy is that hosts can only use\ntheir primary residences as STRs. According to Carlson, that\u2019s dramatically\nlimited speculative purchasing.\n\n\u201cAll the folks who were buying up units or renting units and then subletting\nthem on Airbnb \u2014 that\u2019s all gone,\u201d he says.\n\nA few years later, Irvine, California, enacted an even more severe policy \u2014\nwith more dramatic results. In 2018, the city banned all short-term rentals\nunder 30 days and hired a fintech firm to track down and report scofflaw\nhosts. This ban more than halved the number of Airbnb properties. Eight years\non, rents in the city have dropped by up to three percent, according to a\nrecent study. That saves tenants about $114 per month on average.\n\nThe city of Irvine banned all short-term rentals under 30 days, cutting the\nnumber of Airbnb properties down by more than half.

Some towns might need a combination of\nordinances, while complete bans might work better in others. But according to\nMichael Seiler, the College of William and Mary researcher who led the Irvine\nstudy, we now have strong evidence that limiting STRs can indeed reduce rents.\nAnd, he says, it\u2019s likely that Irvine\u2019s solution could be successfully applied\nin other towns.\n\n\u201cIf I was another policy maker in a sister city, I would say let\u2019s at least\ntry it,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve shown that it does work here.\u201d\n\nNew York hasn\u2019t been the only city to act in recent years. In 2023, Bozeman\npassed regulations forcing STR platforms to ask for operators\u2019 permit numbers.\nThe policy makes it difficult for bad actors to list their homes illegally,\nand makes it easy for the city to double-check that listings are appropriately\nregistered and legally operating. Bozeman also mandated that STRs be primary\nresidences \u2014 not second homes purchased as rental properties.\n\nThere may also be some market solutions around the corner. A cadre of startups\nare taking up Airbnb\u2019s original mission and reworking it into a more holistic,\ncommunity-friendly approach. New platforms like Trusted Housesitters and\nReFlat are making it easier to find mutually beneficial housing swaps, while\nmillennials are bringing time-shares back into vogue in Colorado ski towns.\n\nIn the future, these regulatory and entrepreneurial solutions could work\ntogether to give travelers affordable lodging options \u2014 without sacrificing\nthe needs of local communities.\n\n\u201cA lot of people will say Airbnb is here to stay, but New York City shows you\nthat\u2019s not necessarily the case. When they decided to enforce their housing\nlaws, it was really effective,\u201d says Cox. \u201cNew York City\u2019s approach is a good\nmodel to show that we can be as restrictive as we want. It\u2019s up to us.\u201d\n\nRead more about how tourism-dependent Western towns are grappling with the\nshort-term housing market in the Durango Herald.\n\n#### Corey Buhay\n\nCorey Buhay is a Colorado-based freelance writer and a former editor of\nBackpacker Magazine.
