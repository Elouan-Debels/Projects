Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander\nEurope, told the House Armed Services Committee in a hearing.\n\n\"Over the past year, Russia increased its front-line troop strength from\n360,000 to 470,000,\" Cavoli continued, adding that the bolstered numbers\nstemmed from Russia raising its conscription age from 27 to 30.\n\nThe increase, Cavoli said, meant that Russia was able to enlarge \"the pool of\navailable military conscripts by 2 million for years to come.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In sum, Russia is on track to command the largest military on the continent,\"\nCavoli said in his opening statement to Congress.\n\n\"Regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, Russia will be larger, more\nlethal, and angrier with the West than when it invaded,\" he added.\n\nRelated stories\n\nRepresentatives for Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a\nrequest for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.\n\nCavoli isn't the first US official to have highlighted the threat posed by a\nresurgent Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said that Russia has\n\"almost completely\" restored its military after sustaining heavy losses in\nUkraine.\n\n\"Its newfound capabilities pose a longer-term challenge to stability in Europe\nand threatens NATO allies,\" Campbell told attendees at a dialogue hosted by\nthe Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank, on\nApril 3.\n\nCavoli and Campbell's warnings of an invigorated Russian army come amid waning\nUS support for the Ukraine war. The GOP has repeatedly blocked attempts by the\nBiden administration to send aid to Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that his country \"will\nlose the war\" without additional support from the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If we do not continue to support Ukraine, Ukraine will run out of artillery\nshells and will run out of air defense interceptors in fairly short order,\"\nCavoli said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Based on my experience in 37-plus years in the U.S. military, if one side can\nshoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back\nloses,\" he continued.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: The war in Ukraine by the numbers, one year later\n\nRussia Ukraine russia ukraine war\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
