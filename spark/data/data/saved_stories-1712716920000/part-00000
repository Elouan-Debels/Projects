It completed what is called the standard model of particle\nphysics.\n\nA famously shy man, he told journalists: \"It's very nice to be right\nsometimes.\"\n\nHis work earned him the Nobel Prize for physics a year later.\n\nOPEN\n\nPeter Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1929. At school in Bristol he\nwas a brilliant student who won prizes for his science work - though it was in\nchemistry, not physics.\n\nHe completed a PhD at King's College in London but was beaten to a job there\nby his friend. Instead he went to the University of Edinburgh where he\ncontinued to ask the question: why do some particles have mass?\n\nHis theory struggled to find a place in scientific journals - partly because\nfew understood it - but it was finally published in 1964.\n\nDespite rumours about \"Eureka\" moments, he said his theory was formed over\nyears.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeter Higgs spent much of his life in Edinburgh\n\nTwo other groups of scientists also published work at that time about the same\nidea.\n\nBut the particle became known as the Higgs boson - and for 50 years scientists\nlooked for it using some of the most spectacular technology on Earth.\n\nProf Higgs retired from the University of Edinburgh in 2006, but he continued\nto watch developments at Cern in Geneva, where scientists were using the Large\nHadron Collider to look for the Higgs boson.\n\nCERN\n\nCern's Large Hadron Collider Atlas detector under construction in Geneva\n\nThe particle accelerator, built at a cost of $10bn, was the most powerful yet.\nIt was considered the machine that could prove - or disprove - Higgs's theory.\n\nThe boson had been nicknamed the 'God particle' by the media, after a book by\nNobel laureate Leon Lederman. Scientists object to the term because they say\nreligion has no role to play in evidence-based physics.\n\nIn 2012 physicists at Cern finally announced to great fanfare that they had\ndiscovered the Higgs boson.\n\nAn advance notice had been sent: \"Peter should come to the CERN seminar or he\nwill regret it.\" He changed travel plans to visit Geneva for the stunning\nannouncement.\n\n\"It's been a long wait but it might have been even longer, I might not have\nbeen still around,\" Higgs said. \"At the beginning I had no idea whether a\ndiscovery would be made in my lifetime.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeter Higgs (L) worked with eminent scientists around the world including\nFrancois Englert (R) and Rolf Heuer (C)\n\nA year later the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences tried to call him. It's\nbecome a trope that winners miss the crucial phone call telling them they have\nbeen awarded a Nobel Prize. But Peter Higgs did not even own a mobile phone.\nThe announcement was made in his absence.\n\nA neighbour stopped him in the street to break the news that he'd won -\nalongside Belgian physicist Francois Englert.\n\nHe was known first for the boson, but second for his shy and low-key\npersonality - more interested in his work than fame.\n\nOxford emeritus professor Ken Peach talked about returning from a conference\nwhere scientists were referring constantly to Peter Higgs.\n\n\"I saw Peter in the coffee lounge and said 'Hey Peter! You're famous!'\" He\nresponded with a diffident smile.\n\nAnd some friends feel Peter Higgs did not make the kind of impact that might\nbe expected of a physicist of his ability.\n\n\"I wouldn't say he was shy,\" said Prof Michael Fisher, who died in 2021.\n\n\"I might say that he was a little too retiring perhaps for the good of his own\ncareer.\"\n\nInside the atom-smasher\n\nPallab Ghosh goes inside the largest particle accelerator in the world - which\ndiscovered the Higgs boson.\n\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer\n\nPhysics\n\nParticle physics\n\nRelated\n\n## Peter Higgs, father of 'God particle', dies aged 94\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nScience & Environment\n\n## The hunt for physics' mysterious 'ghost' particles\n\n25 Mar 2024\n\nScience & Environment\n\n## Frozen antimatter may reveal origins of Universe\n\n22 Feb 2024\n\nScience & Environment\n\nMore\n\n5 Feb 2024\n\n## New atom-smasher could spark physics revolution\n\nResearchers want a new, much bigger supercollider but is it worth us paying\nthe \u00a312bn price tag?\n\n5 Feb 2024\n\nScience & Environment\n\n27 Sep 2023\n\n## Scientists closer to solving mystery of antimatter\n\nThe elusive substance holds the key to discovering how the Universe was\nformed.\n\n27 Sep 2023\n\nScience & Environment\n\n10 Aug 2023\n\n## Scientists close in on fifth force of nature\n\nPhysicists believe that an unknown force could be acting on sub-atomic\nparticles known as muons.\n\n10 Aug 2023\n\nScience & Environment\n\n29 Jun 2023\n\n## Galaxy's ghost particles captured in Antarctic ice\n\nAn extraordinary image of ghost particles in the Milky Way is captured by an\nobservatory buried at the South Pole.\n\n29 Jun 2023\n\nScience & Environment\n\n5 Jul 2022\n\n## New particles hold clues to Universe's make-up\n\nThey hope they will help us understand the \"strong force\" that holds the\ninsides of atoms together.\n\n5 Jul 2022\n\nScience & Environment\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
