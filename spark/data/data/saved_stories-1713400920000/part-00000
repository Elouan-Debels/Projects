At launch, it features two apps, including Testut's\nDelta game emulator and clipboard manager app Clip. Delta is also being\nsimultaneously released in the App Store outside of the European Union, but it\nlooks like EU customers will need to download it from AltStore.\n\nTestut says that once AltStore PAL is \"running smoothly,\" third-party app\ndevelopers will be able to submit their apps for distribution outside of the\nApp Store. The app marketplace is designed to be decentralized with no\ndirectory, so developers will need to self-promote their apps and direct users\nto their websites to install an app through AltStore.\n\nDistributing apps through AltStore is free of charge, but it is worth noting\nthat apps that see more than one million first annual installs will need to\npay Apple an 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee. App marketplaces have to pay the\nfee for every install with no free allowance, so AltStore is charged 0.50\neuros each time it is installed. To afford the fee, Testut is charging 1.50\neuros per year for AltStore PAL access.\n\nTestut has been working on AltStore PAL since Apple announced plans to support\nalternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4. It is open to all apps, but Testut\nsays that it makes the most sense for \"smaller, indie apps that otherwise\ncouldn't exist due to App Store rules.\"\n\nAltStore PAL is equipped with Patreon integration to allow developers to\nmonetize their apps. Developers can offer their apps to just their patrons,\nand this method of distribution also allows for a sub-1 million cap on those\nwho can subscribe to use an app.\n\niPhone users in the European Union can download AltStore PAL from the AltStore\nwebsite. Alternative app marketplaces are not available outside of the\nEuropean Union.\n\nTag: European Union\n\n[ 110 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nHavoc035\n\n2 hours ago at 10:47 am\n\n> Here\u2019s more information on it posted earlier today.\n>\n> https://www.theverge.com/24100464/altstore-pal-dma-eu-launch-delta-nintendo-\n> emulator-clip-clipboard-manager\n\nI especially hate that Delta now isn't coming to the App Store in Europe.

That reality never happened. Delta has to\nbe in an alternative store because Apple kicks developers out of the App Store\nin the EU if they want to distribute anything else at all (like AltStore)\noutside of Apple's market. This is entirely Apple's doing, not the consequence\nof a fully open market (which it still isn't).\n\nScore: 9 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nnicolas_s\n\n1 hour ago at 11:32 am\n\n> Delta is also being simultaneously released in the App Store\n> ('https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/') outside\n> of the European Union, but it looks like EU customers will need to download\n> it from AltStore.\n\nGreat, now us Europeans will have to download all these cr*p alt stores\nbecause developers will force us to install their store to use their apps,\nwhile US users will enjoy the convenience and safety of having just one\nofficial app store for everything. Great user experience.\n\n\"But it won't change anything, it'll just give you more choices\" they said.\n\nScore: 5 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nMikeZTM\n\n2 hours ago at 10:50 am\n\nWho said you can always use AppStore if you don't want a third-party\nmarketplace again?\n\n\"It's just a new option\" \"more choice is always better\"\n\nScore: 5 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nMikeZTM\n\n2 hours ago at 11:00 am\n\n> I'm 100% confident this exact argument was made because companies would\n> willingly pull out of the App Store.
