A family earning\n$86,000 could spend a quarter of their salary on care for an infant or\ntoddler, which blows past federal standards that say child care should not\ncost more than 7% of a household's income. Meanwhile, about a quarter of child\ncare workers live in poverty, reports show, and some neighborhoods have fewer\nchild care options since many closed after the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe way that we price child care actually has nothing to do with what the\ncost of it is,\u201d said Lauren Melodia, deputy director of economic and fiscal\npolicies at the New School's Center for New York City Affairs. \u201cParents can't\nafford the market rate and providers also can't afford to work at the market\nrate. So there's this gap that really needs to be filled by public\ninvestment.\u201d\n\nGothamist spoke to child care experts across the state and six early childhood\neducation providers across the five boroughs to understand why families are\npaying so much for care. They said the long-term fix is to move toward\nuniversal child care, which is why fighting to keep 3-K expansion is crucial.\n\n#### Why does child care cost so much?\n\nChild care facilities are tightly regulated.\n\nThere are rules governing how many children can be in a room, how much square\nfootage is required for each child, and the ratio of adults and caregivers to\nchildren. For childcare facilities based in a home, there has to be at least\none caregiver for every eight children with a maximum of two infants. That\nmakes staffing a major expense for providers.\n\nBut even though more staff are needed for fewer children, these early\nchildhood education programs are not subsidized in the same way that public\nK-12 schooling is.\n\n\u201cA lot of our child care challenges, the shortage of care, the lack of\naffordability of care, all these things are rooted in a decision that we've\nmade as a country to not treat child care like a public good,\u201d said Pete\nNabozny, director of policy at the Children's Agenda.\n\n\u201cWe don't treat it the same way that we treat the education system. This has\nbeen a real challenge for many decades, but it keeps on getting more severe of\na problem for families and we seem to be sort of reaching some kind of\nbreaking point,\u201d he said.\n\nFamilies can expect to pay about $20,000 a year for center-based childcare for\ninfants and toddlers.\n\nGraph from a 2023 report from the Citizens' Committee for Children of New\nYork.\n\n#### What are the types of child care programs? And are some more expensive\nthan others?\n\nCenter-based child care programs operate out of commercial spaces, while home-\nbased or group-family care programs are run out of private residences. Home-\nbased programs can\u2019t have more than eight children while group-family programs\ncan have as many 16 kids.\n\nProviders say child care programs based in homes often offer families more\nflexibility, such as non-traditional hours, locations closer to where they\nlive or work, and more spots for infants.\n\nIn general, home child care programs are less expensive than center-based\ncare. Rates for infant care are more costly than for older children due to\nlower staffing ratios.\n\n\u201cSince there's very, very few slots for infants and toddlers, there's usually\nnot a choice for families looking for infant and toddler care because they\nonly have home base as an option,\u201d said Nina Piros, senior early childhood\ndirector at Grand Street Settlement, which runs center-based programs in\nManhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nShe said center-based providers need to have at least 30 square feet per\nchild, which also adds to costs.\n\n#### Are there price differences by neighborhood?\n\nProviders say they can only charge what their community can afford and in\nlower-or middle-income neighborhoods that\u2019s not always enough to cover their\noperating costs, particularly for home child care businesses. For example,\nprograms in Castle Hill or other parts of the Bronx can't charge what a\nprogram in Riverdale does.\n\n\u201cIf a parent just got a job, say they just started a job at Costco, Walmart or\nsomething like that, you think they're going to be able to afford $450 [a\nweek] for child care?,\u201d said Andrea Davilar, a group-family provider in St.\nAlbans, Queens.\n\nFamilies in Brooklyn and the Bronx are the most cost-burdened and pay a higher\npercentage of their incomes toward child care, according to a report by the\nCitizens\u2019 Committee for Children of New York.\n\nThe report found that households in Mott Haven and Hunts Point in the Bronx\nspent as much as 63% of their income on infant and toddler care and just 0.4%\nof families could afford it, based on federal affordability standards. But the\nproblem doesn\u2019t just affect low-income areas. According to the report, there\nare only two community districts in the entire city where a large majority of\nfamilies can afford infant and toddler care: Greenwich Village and Tribeca.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the cost of care and the cost of housing in New York\nCity, it really is this incredible affordability crisis conundrum,\u201d said\nJennifer March, executive director of the Citizens\u2019 Committee for Children of\nNew York.\n\nThere are also 14 community districts that are considered child care deserts,\nmeaning there are three or more children for every available child care seat,\naccording to a 2023 report by the Center for New York City Affairs. That\nprimarily includes parts of Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nSome of New York City's wealthiest neighborhoods can afford childcare.\n\nGraphic from a A 2023 report from the Citizens' Committee for Children of New\nYork.\n\n#### What is the most costly budget item for child care providers?\n\nStaffing.\n\n\u201cOur budget, about 80% is salary and fringe,\u201d said Willing Chin-Ma, chief\noperating officer for Grand Street Settlement. \u201cThe fringe includes the\npayroll and includes the health insurance, and we want to be competitive so we\nhave a 401k.\u201d\n\nChild care providers who operate out of their homes said paying for an\nassistant also absorbs most of their earnings, even though they largely pay\nminimum wage. Home-based providers said they pay their staff first, and even\nthough they can\u2019t afford to offer benefits, that usually means there isn\u2019t\nenough left over for them to earn a salary.\n\n\u201cI'm in this business not because of what I earned, but because of the\ngenerosity of my husband. He has carried the bills, because if it was me, I'd\nbe in the poorhouse,\u201d said Doris Irizarry, a group-family provider in Castle\nHill in the Bronx and co-founder of ECE on the Move, an organization of early\nchildhood educators. She said she needs the money to cover her mortgage, her\nutility bills, workers comp, and supplies for the children.\n\nThe Center for NYC Affairs found that the median home-based provider made\nabout $10.61 per hour in 2021.\n\n#### Is this problem worse in New York City than elsewhere?\n\nWhile child care affordability is a national problem, providers said New York\nCity\u2019s cost of living makes it even harder for both parents and child care\neducators.\n\n\u201cReal estate is driving the cost. The cost of paying for rent is outrageous,\u201d\nChin-Ma said of commercial rents for center-based providers.\n\nProviders who run programs out of their homes and pay rent also have to\ngrapple with rising New York City rents.\n\nJerika Espinoza runs a group-family \u2014 a program run out of her home that can\nserve up to 16 children \u2014 on Staten Island and said her take-home pay has\nremained the same even as costs for food, materials and utilities have jumped.\n\n\u201cWe used to make $3 an hour for children, that\u2019s not enough money to pay\npayroll, rent, internet, cable, you need to get disability,\u201d she said.\nEspinoza added that she can\u2019t charge more for her program because families\ncan\u2019t afford it.\n\nMeanwhile, she said providers like her, who have been in the business for 20\nor more years, don't have pensions, retirement funds or health insurance.\n\nA map of childcare deserts in New York City shows a need in Brooklyn and parts\nof Queens.\n\nMap courtesy of a 2023 report from the New School's Center for New York City\nAffairs.\n\n#### How does the cost of care affect staffing levels?\n\nProviders said there\u2019s a staffing shortage and retention issue in the child\ncare sector, which makes it harder for operators to keep their doors open.\nThere\u2019s also an issue of pay parity as center-based providers compete with the\nDepartment of Education\u2019s 3-K and pre-K programs, which can pay staff more for\nthe same qualifications.\n\nHome-based and group-family providers are also moving on to more sustainable\njobs that allow them to build a retirement savings plan or obtain health\ninsurance.\n\n\u201cThat's why a lot of providers left this industry, they went to do home\n[health] care,\u201d Irizarry from the Bronx said. \u201cHomecare is paying $22 an hour\nand all the benefits, vacations and everything else. They get health\ninsurance, they get vacation pay, holiday pay. We can't afford that. That's\nwhy a lot of them leave.\u201d\n\nChild care workers are disproportionately women and women of color, according\nto the 5Boro Institute, the think tank. The report said more than half of\nchild care workers earn incomes low enough that they qualify for public\nbenefits and child care subsidies for their own children.\n\nhome-based providers are the lowest paid childcare providers.\n\nGraph courtesy of A 2023 report from the New School's Center for New York City\nAffairs.\n\n#### What are families paying for?\n\nProviders said they wear many hats as they care for the youngest New Yorkers.\n\n\u201cWe're not just we're not just teaching the kids, we're we're providing meals\nfor them, we're cooking daily, we're doing diaper changes, we're teaching them\nhow to use the potty,\u201d Davilar said.\n\nPiros said some child care centers also work with families to get them\ninvolved and understand their needs.\n\n\u201cChildren need to be in settings with all these children so that they can\nenhance their social skills, enhance the language skills, enhance their\nlearning and cognitive skills,\u201d she said so that they can be prepared for\nkindergarten and beyond.\n\n#### What about subsidy programs, do those help?\n\nFamilies who can\u2019t afford care may be eligible for a voucher to cover part of\nthe cost. Families who earn below certain income levels, are homeless or\nreceive cash assistance can be eligible. The child must be a U.S. citizen or\nhave legal immigration status to qualify.\n\nBut providers say the rates of reimbursements don\u2019t cover the full cost of\ncare. The state sets the reimbursement rates through a market-rate survey\nevery three years and recently slightly increased the rate, but Melodia said\nit\u2019s a flawed methodology that doesn\u2019t take the actual cost of what it takes\nto operate a facility into account.\n\n\u201cWe're all kind of linked into this system where we're reinforcing these\npayment rates that don't cover the cost of care,\u201d Melodia said. \u201cWe're asking\npeople to take a cut to take care of low-income families.\u201d\n\n#### How can we solve this problem?\n\nChild care experts say the city and state need to move toward universal child\ncare. The City Council passed a bill last year that creates an advisory board\nto figure out how to get to universal child care within five years.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn't expect that the price is going to go down because we should\nactually expect that if we want high-quality care, we're going to have to pay\nfor it,\u201d Melodia said.\n\n\u201cThere's plenty of evidence that it shouldn't be a cost that households have\nto bear on their own and that there should be real concerted effort by the\ngovernment, by all the layers of the government to figure out how to fill that\ngap,\u201d she said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the chief\noperating officer for Grand Street Settlement.
