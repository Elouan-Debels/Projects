The people who made it lived in\nMesopotamia, in what is now southern Iraq. They were Sumerians, the earliest\nknown civilisation in the region, who thrived in ancient cities around 4,000\nto 6,000 years ago.\n\nAn ancient recipe discovered etched into a clay tablet is written as a poem to\nNinkasi, the goddess of beer. \"Ninkasi, it is you who handle [the] dough with\na big shovel, mixing, in a pit, the beerbread with sweet aromatics,\" it reads.\n\"It is you who bake the beerbread in the big oven, and put in order the piles\nof hulled grain.\" The poem reveals that the beer they were drinking was made\nnot only from the usual grains, yeasts and water \u2013 but also from bread.\n\nThe Sumerians loved it \u2013 the pictograph for beer is among the most commonly\nused in Sumerian written language. And unlike most beer made today, it uses\n\"beer bread\", a twice-baked barley bread, to provide some of the sugars needed\nto get the brewing process started.\n\nMillennia later, in 2016, the founders of Toast Brewing in London decided to\nrevive this ancient recipe when they were confronted with the huge amounts of\nfood waste created by factories and supermarkets. Tristram Stuart is an\nenvironmental campaigner at the non-profit Feedback, and Louisa Ziane is a\nsustainability expert at consultancy The Carbon Trust. They decided to make\nbeer from wasted bread after stumbling upon the possibilities presented by the\nhumble loaf.\n\nSign up to Future Earth\n\nSign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and\nhopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman.

Stuart caught a\nglimpse of the scale of this waste in 2013, on a visit to a sandwich factory\nthat supplied a UK supermarket with packaged sandwiches.\n\n\"There was a big skip sitting out there that was just full of bread slices,\"\nsays Ziane. When Stuart had a conversation with the company, they estimated\nthere were 13,000 slices in that skip. Stuart's discussion with the factory\nrevealed that the heel end of loaves and often the slices next to it are\ntypically thrown away because they're not perfectly square.\n\nToast Brewing\n\nFood waste is a major source of carbon emissions globally (Credit: Toast\nBrewing)\n\nSoon after, a chance visit to Belgium \u2013 and a taste of a bread-based brew at\nthe Brussels Beer Project \u2013 inspired Stuart to turn wasted bread into valuable\nbeer. \"The idea that ancient peoples would revere the grain, and use it in a\nway to create a drink that helped to celebrate where that grain came from,\ntells the story of beer,\" Ziane says. Toast Brewing launched in 2016 with\nbottles of beer made from leftover loaves from London bakeries.\n\nPerhaps the beer of the future could begin to look more like that of the past.\nLess lumpy, a little colder, but just as loved\n\nA warm reaction to Toast's launch showed beer to be a novel way to engage\npeople with a planet-sized issue. Around a third of all food produced is lost\nor wasted, and this accounts for as much as 8-10% of global greenhouse gas\nemissions. \"We thought this is a really cool way for us to support the UK\nbakery industry to tackle food waste, while raising awareness among beer\ndrinkers,\" says Ziane .\n\nBrewing beer from bread is not without its challenges. \"Early beers probably\nwere a little bit bitty and maybe like an alcoholic porridge,\" Ziane says. The\nmethod took some adapting \u2013 including an industrial shredder to crumb the\nbread slices, and rice hulls to prevent the bread from becoming an\nimpenetrable sponge in the tank.\n\nThe recipe Toast settled on replaces 25% of the grain with bread. In doing so,\nit replaces 25% of the carbon, water and land needed to grow the grain.\n\nStefan Schaltegger is founder of the Center for Sustainability Management at\nLeuphana University of L\u00fcneburg in Germany and advises Krombacher, the largest\nbeer manufacturer in Germany, on sustainability. Farming grain negatively\nimpacts the environment in several ways, he says. \"One important impact\ncategory is the contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas\nemissions. Another important impact category is water use and a third one\nis...biodiversity loss.\"\n\nToast Brewing\n\nAncient beers were probably a bit like an alcoholic porridge \u2013 the recipe has\nmoved on a bit since then (Credit: Toast Brewing)\n\nAround half of beer's environmental impact happens during the production of\ngrain \u2013 an impact that is avoided when waste bread is used instead. Toast have\ncalculated that, between 2016 and 2022, their use of waste bread avoided 61\ntonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).\n\nThe brewery's production process is the other major contributor to its impact.\n\"There the main issue is energy use, and typically fossil fuels are used,\"\nSchaltegger says. \"These are huge quantities, because you need very high\ntemperatures, and you have to cool the beer down relatively fast, depending on\nwhat kind of beer you produce.\" Toast's brewery runs on gas and grid\nelectricity rather than renewables, but making this shift is an immediate\npriority. The company's carbon footprint in 2022 was 206 tonnes of CO2e, which\nthey plan to reduce to net zero by 2030.\n\nSalvaging bread from landfill also prevents the release of methane, which is\nproduced when bread, or any food, rots in an oxygen-poor environment. Methane\nis a highly potent gas that has a global warming impact more than 80 times\nhigher than CO2 over a 20-year period. (Read more about eight hidden sources\nof methane worldwide.)\n\nIt is important that the grains and bread that have had their sugars extracted\nduring the brewing process don't meet the same fate. Toast sends all their\nspent grains and soggy breadcrumbs to a local farm in south-east England to\nhave a final use as animal feed.\n\nThis byproduct \"starts smelling cheesy within a few hours, so it really needs\ndaily collections,\" says Ziane. This means that the farmer collecting it must\nbe based nearby \u2013 just as, in an ideal world, the bread would come from a\nbakery next door. (Read more about the climate benefits of eating locally on a\nbudget).\n\n\"If you look back to pre-industrialisation periods, where you would have lots\nof little businesses co-located, you would often have a local brewer and a\nbakery next door to each other. The bakery would use surplus yeast from the\nbrewer, and the brewer could use surplus grains from the bakery. It's become\nmuch more difficult to operate like that. But there's something really lovely\nabout the potential for resilience through creating those relationships,\" says\nZiane.\n\nEarly beers were a little bit bitty - like an alcoholic porridge \u2013 Louisa\nZiane\n\nThough Toast now sources bread from the UK's larger commercial bakeries, the\ncompany is committed to keeping sales close to home. In other countries,\nincluding Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia, Toast partners with local\nbrewers and bakeries to source bread and sell beer locally.\n\nThe final result is that Toast's beer has a carbon footprint of 604g (21oz)\nper litre compared to a UK average of around 700g (25oz) per litre, and a US\naverage of 900g (32oz) per litre \u2013 although Toast's figure includes some of\nthe carbon associated with the bread's production, despite the fact that the\nbread would otherwise be wasted.\n\nThere is still work to be done. Packaging typically makes up a big part of\nbeer's environmental impact \u2013 ranging from 19 to 46% in the UK \u2013 and Toast is\nno exception. Packaging is responsible for as much as 56% of Toast\u2019s carbon\nfootprint. The company is now in the process of switching from glass bottles\nto cans, which according to the company halves the carbon footprint from\npackaging.\n\nThe best option for packaging depends on the options for reuse and recycling\nthat are available locally. In countries like the UK that only use single use\nbottles or cans, the environmental burden is substantially higher, compared to\ncountries like Germany which has a bottle return scheme, says Schaltegger.\n\nTom Moggach\n\nThe measures Toast Brewing has taken has shaved emissions off its production\nprocess (Credit: Tom Moggach)\n\nAnd while it is clear that using a waste product instead of new raw materials\nis better for the environment, Schaltegger suggests caution when using waste.\n\"If you take a broader systems perspective, is that the best place to use the\nold bread? Or would there be other places where you could use the old bread\nand reduce even more CO2?\" Making sure the wasted bread gets eaten \u2013 and\ntherefore prevents other bread from being produced \u2013 may be the optimum\nsolution, says Schaltegger.\n\nBut until systems are in place that can eliminate food waste, repurposing\nunwanted bread is a smart idea. \"You don't have to produce the respective\namount of barley and malt, and of course the malting process needs a lot of\nenergy. If you look at beer as a product, it will improve the carbon footprint\nof that beer,\" says Schaltegger.\n\nFor the environmental benefits of beer from bread waste to really make an\nimpact, it needs to become mainstream. A small number of other brewers are\nalready using bread, including Crumbs Brewing in the UK, Modist and Jester\nKing Brewery in the US, Breer in Hong Kong, and N\u00e4\u00e4s Fabriker in Sweden. Toast\nhas also made a home brew recipe available online for anyone interested in\nexperimenting with the stale ends left in their bread bin. But the biggest\nstep will be made by convincing big commercial brewers to integrate bread into\ntheir recipes. \"We estimated that, based on the amount of beer that's brewed\nin the UK, if we can get brewers to switch just 10% of their malt base to\nsurplus bread, then we could halve bread waste in the UK,\" Ziane says. \"That's\nobviously a huge challenge, because the beer recipe is quite sacred.\"\n\nCarbon Count\n\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The\ndigital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page\nview. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nThe volume of bread wasted means that sourcing at this scale is unlikely to be\na problem. The availability of unwanted bread is \u2013 sadly \u2013 consistent, Ziane\nsays. \"We have a fairly reliable supply, unfortunately. Because what happens\nis that bakeries... tend to plan to bake a little bit more, to avoid fines or\ndelisting if they don't fulfil orders. So there tends to always be \u2013 excuse\nthe pun \u2013 surplus baked in.\"\n\nHowever, there will be plenty of loaves languishing in skips and pantries that\ncould make their way into a frosty glass, until the problem of overproduction\nis addressed. Toast donates 100% of its profits to environmental charities,\nincluding Feedback, which are campaigning to end overproduction.\n\nAbove all, the ingenuity of the Sumerian's ancient recipe is a reminder that\nfood has a value that we have come to forget. \"The reason that we waste so\nmuch food is because we've lost this connection to where our food comes from,\nand this appreciation of nature and everything that goes into producing our\nfood in the first place,\" says Ziane.\n\nAs Toast and their fellow bread-brewers attempt to make bread-based beer the\nnorm, perhaps the beer of the future could begin to look more like that of the\npast. Less lumpy, a little colder, but just as loved.\n\n\\--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to\nthe Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked\nselection of features and insights.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nClimate\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood\n\nHistory\n\nEarth\n\nFuture Planet\n\nFeatures\n\nRelated\n\n## The simple Costa Rican secrets to longevity\n\n38 mins ago\n\nTravel\n\n## Eight of the best bagels in New York City\n\n1 day ago\n\nTravel\n\n## Eating at the biggest water fight in the world\n\n2 days ago\n\nTravel\n\nMore\n\nJust now\n\n## 'Brexit food charges will eradicate my cheese shop'\n\nFood business owners say new EU import tariffs risk pushing smaller firms to\nthe brink.\n\nJust now\n\nScotland\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## Why 'selfless' workers earn less\n\nThe \"heroisation\" of certain professions has ironic effects on their workers'\nearning potential.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nWorklife\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## Titanic survivor on the moment ship sank\n\nMore than a century since the Titanic sank, this first-person testimony of\nsurvivor Frank Prentice remains a powerful and harrowing account of the sheer\nterror felt by those on board.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nCulture\n\n3 hrs ago\n\n## How will Ulez sway voters in the mayoral election?\n\nCandidates are clear on what they want to do with Ulez so will it also\ninfluence voters?\n\n3 hrs ago\n\nLondon\n\n7 hrs ago\n\n## Carrots imported from Israel after record rainfall\n\nRecent floods are having a significant impact on the UK's supply of fresh\nvegetables.\n\n7 hrs ago\n\nHull & East Yorkshire\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
