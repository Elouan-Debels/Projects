Together with our API, we\u2019re introducing a few\nchanges to our platform, including an adjusted pricing system.\n\nOver the past months, the LetzAI community has created a great repository of\nAI Models on our platform. These models come with a unique token: their model\nname which you\u2019re using with @ in your LetzAI prompts.\n\nThese tokens can be triggered with @ in your LetzAI prompts to easily generate\nimages of custom content, e.g. \u201c@mischstrotz eating a burger\u201d.\n\nWith the LetzAI API, we are making those tokens available to other platforms.\n\n## LetzAI Models on other platforms\n\nWith our new API, other platforms can integrate LetzAI\u2019s model system into\ntheir own AI tools. This will enable developers to benefit from our intuitive\ntext prompting system: They can trigger all the public LetzAI Models using the\n@ character on their own platforms.\n\nTo showcase this in practice, we have teamed up with creators to make\nCustomGPTs using the new API. This means that you can now use LetzAI models\ninside of ChatGPT, if the custom GPT uses the LetzAI API.\n\nYou can trigger LetzAI inside of GPTs by visiting the page of the GPT\ndirectly, or by simply tagging the GPT with \"@letzai\" inside your prompts. Be\ncareful not to mix ChatGPT's @ character functionality with our own. Since\nChatGPT has its own tagging functionality, you need to make sure that the @\nyou're using for your prompts are not tagging other GPTs. To try out\nCustomGPTs, you will need ChatGPT+.\n\n### LetzAIGPT\n\nOur very own GPT knows all our models. It's basically LetzAI inside of\nChatGPT. It can also remix your images, interpret your LetzAI Image URLs, and\nmore!\n\n### PRMPT by Mark \"Marco\" Isle\n\nPRMPT GPT - your expert in editorial fashion, photography, and styling\nprompts. Creating structured, summarised, and experimental prompts for you to\nexplore! It will provide you with prompts that you can bring to LetzAI, or you\ncan ask it to generate your prompts directly!\n\n### URBAN MELANCHOLY GPT by Julie Wieland\n\nThis \"Urban Melancholy\" GPT specializes in generating images that capture the\nvibrant neon glow and atmospheric mood of Hong Kong-inspired urban nights. It\nfocuses on creating AI-photography that evokes deep, unspoken emotions and\nnostalgic ambiance, portraying the silent tales of cityscapes bathed in red\nlight. This unique style invites viewers to immerse themselves in the warm,\nmelancholic beauty of nocturnal urban settings.\n\nIf you want to build your own application that uses LetzAI\u2019s models and image\ngeneration capabilities, please refer to our API documentation.\n\n## New subscription plans\n\nWith the launch of the API, we\u2019re changing our subscription system. We are\nchanging the \u201cJust Testing\u201d plan into a \u201cTop up\u201d function, meaning you can Top\nup if you\u2019ve run out of credits on a subscription.\n\nThe other plans keep the same price but receive more monthly credits, with the\nBeginner plan now offering 5000 Credits and the Pro Plan 50\u2019000 Credits. In\nother words, Image Generation becomes cheaper.\n\nWe\u2019re also increasing the number of images you can generate simultaneously,\nwith 6 being the current maximum on the Pro plan.\n\nFinally, each subscribed user now has the option to disable the Watermark. If\nyou disable the watermark on your account, it will also be disabled on your\nAPI calls.\n\nIf you need more Credits and more simultaneous generations for your app,\nplease reach out to us about our Enterprise solutions.\n\n## Getting an API Key for your subscription\n\nTo use the LetzAI API, you can now generate API Keys for your account on the\nSubscription page.\n\nAPI Keys are currently only available to users on a paid plan with the maximum\nnumber of API Keys per account being 10.\n\nAll your API keys are linked directly to your subscription. This means that\nrunning any API application will deplete credits from the account of the key\nowner.\n\nImportant note: Any image that is generated using your API key will be saved\ndirectly to your profile, and will give you the option to publish them on your\nLetzAI profile. Please consider this when writing the Privacy Policy for your\napplication. You don\u2019t want to surprise your users by publishing their images\nat random. We reserve the right to revoke your API Keys and close your account\nin case of infringements.\n\nIf you want to properly segment your applications and sort the created images\nper applications, we recommend creating multiple accounts on LetzAI - one for\neach of your apps.\n\n## Using the API\n\nYou can use the LetzAI API to generate images using our model names and their\ntokens, or to retrieve a list of available models.\n\nWe provide 4 first simple endpoints during launch:\n\n  * POST /images\n  * GET /images/{id}\n  * GET /models\n  * GET /models/{id}\n\nYou will need to pass your API key as a bearer token for all of them. To learn\nmore on how to use Bearer Tokens, please see here.\n\nPlease find the entire API Documentation here.\n\n## Case Study: Making a CustomGPT with LetzAI\n\nTo make your own CustomGPT using the LetzAI API, you need to do two easy\nthings:\n\n  * Write proper Instructions for your GPT\n  * Set up Actions using our OpenAPI YAML docs\n\n### Writing instructions for a GPT\n\nTo tell your GPT what it should do, you\u2019ll need to write a set of custom\ninstructions. You can tell it how to call itself, which language to speak, and\nwhich special things it can do (like generating an Image using the LetzAI\nAPI).\n\nTo get you started, here is an example instruction set, that you can paste\ninto your CustomGPT.\n\n### Set up Actions\n\nSetting up Actions is very simple. All you need to do is copy the following\nfile and paste it into your GPT\u2019s Actions input field:\n\nOpen OpenAPI YAML file\n\nThis YAML file contains all of our API methods and \u201cteaches\u201d your GPT on how\nto use them.\n\n## About the LetzAI API\n\nThe launch of the LetzAI API is a big milestone for us. We are planning to\nrelease more functions in the future. In the meantime, we\u2019re looking forward\nto what you will create and how you will use our new API.\n\nWe would also love to hear your feedback, so if you have any requests or\nthings you want to tell us, please reach out to us at contact@letz.ai or via\nSocial Media.\n\n## Links\n\nOpen the LetzAI API documentation\n\nBy connecting and using Letz.ai you agree to our Terms of Service\n\nBlogFAQ\n\nEnglish | L\u00ebtzebuergesch\n\nThis website contains cookies and tracking technology \u2013 you can find further\ninformation on this topic in our privacy policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
