Citations are coming.\n\nResidents have chafed in recent weeks after their vehicles were ticketed while\nsitting in the same spots they\u2019ve used for years. Now, those types of\ncitations are poised to multiply.\n\nSan Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Director Jeffrey Tumlin\nannounced Tuesday that parking control officers will soon begin conducting\nintensive enforcement operations across the city.\n\n\u201cIn many San Francisco neighborhoods, given the scarcity of parking control\nofficers that we have faced for several years, there are people who think that\nthe rules don\u2019t exist,\u201d Tumlin said during Tuesday\u2019s SFMTA Board of Directors\nmeeting. \u201cWe want to get the word out that we are finally able to start\nenforcing the rules.\u201d\n\nThe new intensive enforcement plan will fall outside of parking control\nofficers\u2019 regular duties. During the intensive enforcement operations, parking\ncontrol will descend on one supervisorial district a week at a time, issuing a\nflurry of tickets in that neighborhood.\n\nThe initiative is possible because the city\u2019s parking control team is fully\nstaffed for the first time since the beginning of the Covid pandemic,\naccording to Tumlin.\n\nSMTA's Agency Director Jeffrey Tumlin announced intensive parking enforcement operations will soon be taking place across the city. | Source: Paul Kuroda for The Standard\n\nThe weeklong intensive push will happen in each district about once every\nthree months, according to SFMTA spokesperson Michael Roccaforte.\n\nIntensive deployments will prioritize safety-related violations, such as\nparking on sidewalks or in bike lanes, blocking crosswalks and parking too\nclose to an intersection, said Roccaforte.\n\n\u201cPeople who park on the sidewalk, in bike lanes or in a crosswalk put\npedestrians and bicyclists at risk by forcing them into traffic or obstructing\npeople using wheelchairs or other mobility devices,\u201d a spokesperson for Mayor\nLondon Breed told The Standard.\n\nSan Francisco street safety has taken center stage since a family of four was\nkilled in March after an SUV crashed into a bus shelter. In response, Breed\ncalled for a complete overhaul of city streets and renewed San Francisco\u2019s\ncommitment to Vision Zero, an initiative that aims to eliminate traffic\nfatalities.\n\nTwelve people have died in traffic incidents in San Francisco in 2024,\naccording to preliminary SFMTA data.\n\nTrevor Adams, a parking control officer for the SFMTA, issues a parking ticket on March 21, 2017. | Source: Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nDespite a decade of work under Vision Zero\u2019s banner, the program has failed to\nstem deaths on city streets. However, Breed has recently thrown her weight\nbehind the initiative, identifying her top priorities as designating more\nintersections as \u201cno right on red\u201d, expanding the practice of daylighting\nintersections by removing parking spots close to crosswalks and ramping up\nenforcement.\n\nSFMTA has faced criticism for moving too slowly on street safety\ninfrastructure projects since Vision Zero launched back in 2014. In March,\nSupervisor Connie Chan announced her intention to introduce an emergency\ndeclaration prioritizing the completion of Vision Zero infrastructure projects\non the city\u2019s most dangerous streets.\n\n\u201cThis request today reflects the emergency on our streets right now, which has\nbeen exacerbated by the SFMTA\u2019s lack of management, strategy and urgency to\nprioritize these projects in a timely fashion,\u201d Chan said.\n\nNoah Baustin can be reached at nbaustin@sfstandard.com\n\n## Filed Under\n\nNewsSFMTATransportation\n\n## Read More\n\n  * ### Alaska Airlines flights delayed from SFO, grounded nationwide by FAA\n\nA spokesperson said the airlines was \"working to resolve the issue as quickly\nas possible\" after a system performance upgrade went awry.\n\n  * ### Drug market confessions: Exhibition sheds light on fentanyl crisis\n\nAn exhibition at San Francisco's Main Public Library has become a confessional\nbooth for people living on the city\u2019s fringes.\n\n  * ### Jon Jacobo resigns after Standard reports sex-crime allegations; lawmaker calls for hearings\n\nAllegations against Jacobo range from stalking and threats to domestic\nviolence, sexual assault and rape.\n\n  * ### Alameda County DA to face recall vote\n\nThe movement seeking to oust Pamela Price has collected more than the required\nnumber of valid signatures to hold a recall vote.\n\n  * ### Feds say developer who bribed city officials should skip prison time\n\nSia Tahbazof, who admitted to giving bribes in a plea deal, also received a\nletter of support from longtime San Francisco politician John Burton.\n\n## Popular Today\n\n  1. 1\n\n### Alaska Airlines flights delayed from SFO, released after FAA ground stop\n\n  2. 2\n\n### Drug market confessions: Exhibition sheds light on fentanyl crisis\n\n  3. 3\n\n### The Standard nabs City Hall office, a first for San Francisco news in five\nyears\n\n  4. 4\n\n### Jon Jacobo resigns after Standard reports sex-crime allegations; lawmaker\ncalls for hearings\n\n## Stay up-to-date on what\u2019s happening in your city.\n\nFrom a daily rundown of the most recent stories to a dose of arts and culture\nto an inside look at City Hall and local politics, The Standard delivers all\nthe latest San Francisco news to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\n\u00a9 The San Francisco Standard.
