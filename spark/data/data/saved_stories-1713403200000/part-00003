Turning out the lights at night could save countless fatal\ncollisions.\n\nIt was a foggy Thursday morning when animal services supervisor Josh Henderson\nreceived news of a mass mortality. On May 4, 2017, 395 migratory birds died\nafter smashing into one office tower in Galveston, Texas. Henderson rushed to\nthe scene to witness the gruesome spectrum of feathers from yellow and orange\nto blue and grey of the lifeless small-featured bodies.\n\n\"It was awe-inspiring and tragic,\" says Henderson, who is now the executive\ndirector of the Humane Society in Galveston.\n\nOn the move\n\nTo celebrate the current spring migration season, you can follow the movement\nof billions of birds with stories from BBC Future Planet. Be sure to check\nback and join us as we explore how we can all help birds travel safely on\ntheir epic migrations.\n\nMost of them were warblers: small, bright, colourful birds that are\nparticularly abundant in Texas. They had been on their homecoming spring\nmigration, an epic journey that takes them from wintering sites as far south\nas Mexico to nesting sites as far north as Canada, according to the National\nAudubon Society, a US-based bird conservation group.\n\nFor birds, Texas is a major flyover state: approximately two billion birds, or\none in three birds migrating through the US, fly through the Lone Star State\nin the spring. It is snugly situated at the convergence of two major migratory\nflyways \u2013 the broad north-south routes that many different bird species all\nuse to migrate. Both the Central Americas Flyway, which stretches from the\nCanadian Arctic to the southern tip of Argentina, and the waterway-rich\nMississippi Flyway, beloved by migratory waterbirds, pass through Texas.\n\nAlong the route, hazards abound \u2013 including bright city lights. Though the\nGalveston collision was a particularly dramatic example, birds hitting\nbuildings is a common phenomenon. Every year, between 365 million and one\nbillion birds are thought to be killed in building collisions in the US. The\nrisk increases when they migrate and pass through cities in large numbers.\n\nMore than half of those fatal crashes are actually with low-rise buildings,\nsuch as people's homes. Birds may collide with them in small numbers per\nbuilding, but it adds up, as houses are so widespread. However, as the\nGalveston case and mass bird crashes in other US cities show, big lit-up\nbuildings such as skyscrapers, convention centres and office blocks can pose a\ndisproportionate threat, killing hundreds of birds at once, because of each\nbuilding's sheer scale. In October 2023, nearly 1,000 birds died in a single\nnight during their autumn migration from striking a lakeside convention centre\nin Chicago.\n\nHow you can help the spring migration\n\nHere are two simple ways you can help, according to bird conservation experts:\n\n* Switch off non-essential outdoor lighting to reduce confusion and crashes\n* Pick up litter and avoid littering \u2013 litter can be dangerous for birds when mistaken for food and swallowed\n\nThe scene of the mass collision in Galveston was a 23-floor skyscraper called\nOne Moody Plaza. The tallest building in downtown Galveston used four corner\nspotlights pointing straight up in the sky and a glowing green halo of LED\nlights around the top of the tower.\n\n\"You could be seven miles offshore in a boat and the first thing you'd see was\nthe green light,\" Henderson tells BBC Future Planet.\n\nNot unlike the title character in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, the\nbirds appeared to be fatally attracted to this alluring green light.\n\nThe influence of artificial light in urban spaces is a well-known phenomenon\namong birds, but is still not fully understood. Birds tend to migrate by\nnight, and use the stars to navigate. By day, they use the position of the Sun\nto orient themselves. During nocturnal migration, they are often seen\ngathering around or crashing into lit-up windows and structures, or gathering\naround beams of projected life. The artificial glow of cities also appears to\nattract them for stopovers. One explanation is that they may generally fly\ntowards light sources, but also, that the artificial light confuses, traps and\ndisorients them.\n\n\"Every tragedy is an opportunity to educate,\" says Henderson. He sorted and\nidentified the bodies of the deceased birds, which were then entered into the\nnatural history collections at Texas A&M University and Louisiana State\nUniversity. Henderson's team was able to save and rehabilitate three birds.\n\nJosh Henderson\n\nThese birds collided with an office tower in Galveston, Texas (Credit: Josh\nHenderson)\n\n\"It was determined that the building's illumination may have played a part in\nattracting and disrupting the birds during the storm,\" says Scott Campbell,\nthe senior vice president of corporate communications at American National.\n\"We did not take the incident lightly.\"\n\nThe accident prompted Houston Audubon, a bird conservation organisation, and\nAmerican National Insurance Company, which occupies the building, to take\naction and jointly develop a science-based response.\n\nAt the time, several existing, successful campaigns in the US and Canada\nencouraged building owners, developers and businesses to switch off non-\nessential lighting to help travelling birds. One was Toronto's Fatal Light\nAwareness Programme (FLAP). The National Audubon Society also had Lights Out\ncampaigns in several cities and states, which encouraged businesses and\nindividuals to switch off unnecessary outdoor lights at night.\n\nAmerican National Insurance implemented \u2013 and still follows \u2013 a policy of\nturning off their exterior building spotlights and interior lights at night\nduring the spring and fall migratory seasons, says Campbell. After the\ncollision event, American National Insurance Company partnered with the\nHouston Audubon Society to hold workshops in Galveston to educate the\ncommunity on migratory bird patterns in the Gulf Coast portion of Texas.\n\nThe first Lights Out for Birds programme was formed soon after in the Houston\narea, which has now expanded into the statewide \"Lights Out, Texas!\" effort\nwith Audubon Texas.\n\nThe 2017 mass bird crash was the only collision event at the One Moody\nbuilding, Campbell added.\n\nTexas is a place where we want to make sure that passage is as easy and safe\nas possible \u2013 Andrew Farnsworth\n\nAround the same time as the Galveston bird crash, the Cornell Lab of\nOrnithology developed a way to forecast bird migration during specific times\nand locations, using radar. The resulting BirdCast migration forecast maps are\nfreely accessible. Their live migration map allows anyone to check how many\nbirds are migrating now, and where, as well as how many are predicted to pass\nin the near future. For one night in October, they recorded a \"billion bird\nnight\", with that number or more birds passing in a single night.\n\nIn 2020, Cornell, Houston Audubon and a range of other organisations joined\nforces to start the \"Lights Out, Texas!\" campaign, which encourages building\nowners, developers and businesses to switch off non-essential lighting from\n11pm to 6am each night during spring and autumn migration. Timed for around\nMarch-June (spring migration) and August-November (autumn migration), the\ncampaign aims to help create a safe passage for nocturnally migrating birds.\nSince then, Lights Out Texas has taken hold in every major city in Texas. The\nstate is considered an especially important place for the campaign given its\nposition as a mass bird migration hotspot.\n\n\"Texas is a place where we want to make sure that passage is as easy and safe\nas possible,\" says Andrew Farnsworth, a migration ecologist at the Cornell Lab\nof Ornithology. The community of birds that migrate through Texas are smaller\nsongbirds, he says, including a diversity of warblers and sparrows. In his\nview, those are the birds that benefit most from the Lights Out effort in\nTexas because that state is on their route.\n\nJosh Henderson\n\nTurning out more of the lights of the American National building can help save\nbirds' lives (Credit: Josh Henderson)\n\nAround 24 communities in Texas have pledged to follow the Lights Out\nrecommendations.\n\nEarly data collection suggests that Lights Out is effective, says Chloe\nSaucedo Crumley, the public affairs and engagement manager at Audubon Texas.\nAfter tracking the bird crashes at Chicago's towering McCormick Place over 20\nyears, researchers found a 60% decrease in bird mortality when lights are\nturned off.\n\nIn Texas, given the limited data and uncontrollable factors of studying\nanimals that travel thousands of kilometers, \"it's hard to assign causation\nand correlation already\" says Crumley. In the meantime, scattered volunteer\nbirdwatchers monitor how migrating birds interact with asphalt jungles in\nTexan cities. More than 3,600 individual birds representing 127 species have\nbeen identified by volunteers as colliding with buildings since 2020.\nResearchers at the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife have generated a heat map\nthat identifies which buildings have had the most collisions.\n\nChicago, Houston, Dallas, New York City and Atlanta are the cities where the\nthreat to migrating birds is greatest, in terms of light pollution, Farnsworth\nsays. All these cities maintain a Lights Out campaign, according to Audobon's\nrecords.\n\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022 The flying scientists saving rare birds\n\n\u2022 The argument for switching off lights at night\n\n\u2022 How light pollution confuses plants\n\nProtecting birds is vital both for their own sake and for the wider ecosystem,\nFarnsworth says. \"The whole canary-in-the-coalmine euphemism is true. Birds\nare good bioindicators and proxies for ecosystem health,\" he says. \"Plus,\nbirds look really cool, sound really cool and have really interesting\nbehaviours.\"\n\nCarbon Count\n\nThe travel emissions it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital\nemissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\nFind out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nHowever, protecting species that move presents special challenges for\nresearchers and conservationists, compared to protecting a resident\npopulation, Farnsworth points out. Migrating birds can travel thousands of\nkilometres, crossing and stopping in many different habitats, traversing\nborders, and flying through cities \u2013 which are continuing to grow around the\nworld, with urban sprawl replacing and fragmenting birds' habitats.\n\nFarnsworth suggests that given this complex picture, there is no single\nsolution to helping migrating birds. Instead, in his view, spreading\nawareness, empathy and efficient enforcement are all crucial in keeping them\nsafe and avoiding collisions. \"We need to keep our connection to nature\nthrough our eyes, ears, nose, whatever \u2013 and use senses to experience the core\nof all this research and observation.\"\n\n\\--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your\ninbox every Friday.\n\nAnimal Migration\n\nCities\n\nEarth\n\nEnvironment\n\nFeatures\n\nFuture Planet\n\nWildlife\n\nRelated\n\n## How an English castle became a stork magnet\n\n31 Mar 2024\n\nFuture\n\nMore\n\n4 hrs ago\n\n## Where to find the best banh mi in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nVietnamese American chef and author Andrea Nguyen scours the backstreets of\nformer Saigon for the famed sandwiches, from classic breakfast options to\nafter-dark favourites.\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n8 hrs ago\n\n## Inside the home of a modern-day Leonardo da Vinci\n\nRecently opened to the public, this artists' residence surprises whomever\nventures in, making them wonder how such a splendid place exists in an\notherwise sleepy Venetian square.\n\n8 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n8 hrs ago\n\n## Council declares nature emergency amid decline\n\nNew measures include allocating at least 30% of land for nature by 2030.\n\n8 hrs ago\n\nScience & Environment\n\n9 hrs ago\n\n## SAT optional?
