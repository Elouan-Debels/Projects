Lush plantings,\nporches or trinkets can capture the attention of passersby and spark\nconversation. Other lawns say \u201cstay away,\u201d whether it\u2019s through imposing\nfences or foreboding signs.\n\nBut to what extent do yards serve as a window into the people who tend them \u2013\nand how they feel about their home, neighborhood and city?\n\nIn our study of nearly 1,000 front yards in Buffalo\u2019s Elmwood Village\nneighborhood, we found that the livelier and more open the front yard, the\nmore content and connected the resident.\n\n## Cultivating a sense of place\n\nOur study of front yards is part of a larger investigation into the ways in\nwhich American neighborhoods can cultivate a stronger \u201csense of place,\u201d which\nrefers to the feeling of attachment and belonging one feels to their home,\nneighborhood and city.\n\nFor decades, psychological, geographical and design research has linked sense\nof place to happier neighborhood residents and stronger ties among neighbors.\n\nWe decided to focus on Buffalo\u2019s Elmwood Village for this particular study.\nThere was the convenience factor, of course \u2013 we\u2019re both professors at the\nUniversity at Buffalo. But in 2007, Elmwood Village had also been honored by\nthe American Planning Association as one of \u201c10 Great Neighborhoods in\nAmerica.\u201d\n\nWe wanted to know what set Elmwood Village apart.\n\nLocated north of downtown Buffalo, this leafy neighborhood is famed for its\nparkways designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who also\nhelped plan New York\u2019s Central Park and Boston\u2019s Emerald Necklace.\n\nIn 2007, Buffalo\u2019s Elmwood Village was honored by the American Planning\nAssociation as one of \u201810 Great Neighborhoods in America.\u2019 benedek/E+ via\nGetty Images\n\nElmwood Avenue is the neighborhood\u2019s commercial heart and is surrounded by a\ndense blend of single-family and multifamily homes. In earlier research we had\nalready shown that Elmwood Village\u2019s residents have a strong sense of place.\nThey especially appreciated the parkways and the area\u2019s large, historic homes\nthat had been built along tree-lined streets.\n\nBut we wanted to know whether residents could also reinforce their own sense\nof place from their homes, particularly the parts that are visible to all\npassersby.\n\nIn the precious few feet in front of the home, residents can put their values\nand interests on display, whether it\u2019s garden gnomes, Little Free Libraries,\nelaborate gardens, sports allegiances and political loyalties.\n\nWhile hanging out or working from their yards, residents can easily chat with\nneighbors; in fact, one study found that more than 3 out of 4 new neighborhood\ncontacts are made from the front yard.\n\nThey\u2019re like bridges to the rest of the neighborhood, where each resident can\ndecide how much they want to express themselves to their neighbors and\npassersby. At the same time, front yards can also be used to cordon off the\nhome, blocking views or discouraging access with fences, hedges and warnings.\n\nMore than 3 out of 4 of new neighborhood contacts are made in the few feet in\nfront of a home.

We ended up not being\nable to reliably track lawn care or home maintenance, since each researcher\nhad different opinions on the measures. (Unfortunately, in this particular\nneighborhood, garden gnomes and Little Free Libraries were too rare to\ninclude.)\n\nWe then compared the data from the students\u2019 fieldwork to responses from\nsurveys we had administered asking residents about their attachment to their\nhomes, neighbors and neighborhood; whether they felt their neighborhood had a\nstrong identity; and if they felt they could connect to nature.\n\nThe results proved remarkably consistent. Whether they proudly displayed\nBuffalo Bills flags or simply had a couple of flower pots on their front\nporch, residents who expressed themselves with items in front of their house\nreported feeling a greater sense of place.\n\nElmwood Village residents celebrate after planting a garden and erecting a\nwelcome sign on a front lawn in 2006.

Interestingly, unwelcoming signs such as \u201cNo\nTrespassing\u201d or \u201cSmile, You\u2019re on Camera\u201d did not.\n\nEven objects as simple as toys or plastic playground gear left out on the\nfront yard seemed to foster a sense of place. To us, this says a couple of\nthings: Homeowners trust that their property won\u2019t get stolen, and parents\ndon\u2019t seem all too concerned about letting their kids play outside with\nneighborhood friends.\n\nThis connects to our strongest result: Elements that facilitate socializing \u2013\na garden chair, a porch, a bench \u2013 strongly boosted residents\u2019 sense of place\nin every dimension and scale, whether it was their view of their home, their\nstreet or their neighborhood.\n\n## Building better neighborhoods\n\nOur study finally validates urbanists\u2019 decades-old contention that lively\nfront yards make better neighborhoods.\n\nAnd it turns out that places with tiny front yards, or even none at all, can\nalso play along.\n\nOne study of Rotterdam, Netherlands, found that the port city\u2019s residents,\neven with little-to-no space in front of their densely built, urban homes,\nnonetheless embellished their sidewalks with seats, planters and knickknacks\nto express themselves. These small gestures strengthened community ties and\nmade residents happier.\n\nA Virgin Mary shrine in front of a home in Somerville, Mass.\nsushiesque/flickr, CC BY-NC\n\nIn our view, the results of our study should serve as a gentle reminder to\narchitects, planners and developers that when they design homes and\nneighborhoods, they ought to create spaces for sharing values and\nconversations in front of homes \u2013 to prioritize porches over parking, and\ncanvases for self-expression over saving space or money. While American\ndesigners and builders are under enormous pressure to produce more housing,\nthey shouldn\u2019t forget that only residents can turn them into homes.\n\nPeople have an amazing ability to mold their surroundings to suit their needs\n\u2013 just look at what the citizens of Rotterdam were able to do.\n\nElmwood Village\u2019s residents already know this, though. They\u2019re busy organizing\ntheir next Porchfest, the annual front-yard arts and music festival that\nburnishes the neighborhood\u2019s reputation as one of America\u2019s best places to\nlive.\n\n  * Cities\n  * Crime\n  * Plants\n  * Toys\n  * Flowers\n  * Community\n  * Homes\n  * Play\n  * Buffalo\n  * Houses\n  * Neighborhoods\n  * Urban residents\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Senior Enrolment Advisor\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
