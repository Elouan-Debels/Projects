Who doesn\u2019t! They were once state of the art \u2013 those are\nwhat airplanes were supposed to look like - almost a century ago. Now imagine\nhow progress in aviation would seem like if the only advances made since then\nwere only with materials and electronics \u2013 would a carbon fiber covered\ntitanium framed biplane with digital fuel injection sound like the peak of\naviation development to you?\n\nWould PlaneExif feature old aircraft with the latest developments in\nironically inappropriate undercarriage tires, patina by numbers, and smug\npurveyors of artistically diminished airworthiness for the edgy iPilot? Well,\nthat\u2019s not too far off from what\u2019s happened to the motorcycle world. For the\nhigh performance end of the market, how many years in a row of bold new\ngraphics, .01mm smaller valve stems with 1.2 degrees less included angle for\n2.4 more horsepower, and 17% more bodywork tortuosity does everyone have to\nget from press release regurgitators before everyone tunes out?\n\nAre motorcyclists that braindead? I\u2019m not innovation intolerant - if the OEMs\nwon\u2019t offer real innovation, fine, I\u2019ll take that as an opportunity to do it\nmyself. I don\u2019t have any qualifications, credentials, or connections to do\nwhat I\u2019m doing, but if the results from the qualified, credentialed, and\nconnected are anything to go by, I\u2019m better off for that.\n\nI see the vast majority of the motorcycle industry as horrifyingly uninspired,\nunenthusiastic, and antipathetic. Look at any of the \u201cMotorcycle Art\u201d sites\nand bore yourself to death with endless images of Battle TartsTM on dystopian\ncaf\u00e9 racers. How do you get that screwed up to think that\u2019s exciting,\nattractive, or even remotely interesting? Am I the only one that doesn\u2019t \u201cGet\nit\u201d? Maybe I need to look pretty far back to see why I\u2019m headed the other way.\n\nAs a product of 1962, my early childhood was heavily influenced by that era\u2019s\nboundless optimism and progress in aerospace, and having older brothers that\nenjoyed explaining it to me made it stick for life. The constant stream of new\nand exciting advances in aerospace meant there was always something\ninteresting to learn. I couldn't wait to see what would come next: the future\nwas going to be awesome! Then came the end of the Apollo program, the end of\nSST, XB-70, B-1A, etc. Well, one of my older brothers was also into homebuilt\naircraft - the EAA\u2019s Sport Aviation magazine introduced me to the excitement\nbrought to that world at first by Jim Bede, then later by Burt Rutan. No need\nto wait for some factory or government program: the portal to the future is\nyour own workshop, order that set of plans today!\n\nWell, airplanes are really cool, fast, and all that, but they are still\nexpensive to build, operate, and store. I soon concluded that motorbikes have\nthe best !/$ ratio of any vehicle. Then while talking about motorcycle design,\nmy older brother explained that if modern engineers were to start designing\nbikes for the first time, they would look very different, with vastly better\naerodynamics, comfort, and chassis dynamics than bikes based on 19th century\nconfigurations. The only hints of such possibilities were the Mead & Tomkinson\nNessie and Newell\u2019s Quasar; to the teenage me, they seemed horrifically ugly,\nheavy, and misguided.\n\nThen came motorcycling\u2019s own era of boundless optimism and progress. The\nchopper fad imploded and the sportbike market exploded! The de Cortanze ELF\nracers hit both the tracks and the magazines. A GP class for the rest of us\ncalled \u201cBattle of The Twins\u201d started running at the national level. James\nParker showed us what was possible with his RADD creations - his MC2 in\nMotorcyclist showed us that the future was going to be awesome! Tony Foale\u2019s\nchassis book boosted my confidence on the subject of chassis dynamics and\ndesign. And if all those aircraft homebuilders could produce stunning\naircraft, then how much easier should it be to produce a stunning motorcycle?\n\n\"Whenever there's a breakthrough, a true breakthrough, you can go back and\nfind a time period when the consensus was 'Well, that's nonsense!' So what\nthat means is that a true creative researcher has to have confidence in\nnonsense.\"\n\n\\- Burt Rutan\n\nWhile all of the other Funny Front Ends had logical explanations, I didn\u2019t\nlike any of them. Too many would illustrate their structural superiority with\na side view of the load path, but none of them would illustrate that same path\nwhen seen from above \u2013 they\u2019re worse than any fork from that direction.\nWouldn\u2019t it be really cool just to have 2 straight links in pure\ncompression/tension? No way will that work, and I wanted to see for myself\nwhat would go wrong \u2013 except that it did work \u2013 on paper, anyway. Around the\nsame time, Gene Church was dominating Pro-Twins BOTT racing on a Harley, while\nnobody seemed to be sure if Ducatis were still imported to the USA or even\nstill in business In Italy. Is anyone going to take that company with an\nelephant logo seriously?\n\nHarley was known to make engines without making any changes for decades\n(Unlike the 2 year engine design lifespan from the Big 4 at the time), and the\nnew Evo engines had far greater performance potential than the previous\ngeneration. So I went with the Harley engine. Since so much of my new design\nwas unproven, racing seemed like a bad idea for initial concept testing.\nLovely yet hardly used roads were nearby (Sunspot, New Mexico), so the first\nbike project would be vaguely street legal. A new 1988 Sportster 883 was\nbought, torn down in the living room while my wife was away with relatives,\nand construction started in an unused 2nd bedroom.\n\nI\u2019d never built a motorcycle before, but books like the Aircraft Spruce &\nSpecialty catalog, Carroll Smith\u2019s excellent books, and the usual workshop\nbooks from Finch and Fournier got me started. The frame was made of 1\u201d and 2\u201d\n.065\u201d wall mild steel cold drawn seamless tubing. The welding supply catalogs\nsaid that nickel silver brazed joints should be even stronger than welding, so\nthat\u2019s what I did. All of the tube fitting was done with a few hand files and\na hacksaw \u2013 slow, but cheap. The engine was squared up to the table and stuck\nin position with bondo (AKA \u201cJig in a can\u201d). Careful placement of tubing, with\nthe assistance of my neighbor Ed Harthan\u2019s fire resistant hands, made a frame\njig unnecessary.\n\nThe only bent tube on the entire bike was the upper brace tube on the swingarm\n\u2013 packing the tube with sand, capping it, heating the bend area up with a\nrosebud torch, and hand bending it around a sheetmetal faced radius block got\nit done. The bodywork was carved then sanded from chunks of Styrofoam from\nAircraft Spruce, fiberglassed with \u201cSaf-T-Poxy\u201d (...later banned because it\napparently wasn\u2019t safe enough), then smoothed out with Feather Fill and lots\nof wet sanding \u2013 just like building a composite homebuilt airplane!\nAfterwards, all of the foam was chipped out and/or dissolved out.\n\nSome of the BOTT Harley roadracers used low oil sump placements, so that\u2019s\nwhere mine ended up and I never had any oil feed issues. The board-track style\nexhaust pipes were the result of laziness, it was supposed to get a 2-1\nexhaust system (and 1200cc big bore kit, etc.) but I just wanted to find out\nif the bike worked or not. And losing a few percent of horsepower on an engine\nthat already made very little power made it hard to notice the difference.\nBoth wheels were 18\u201d Akront Nervi rims, just like the state of the art GSX-Rs\nat the time; I was never a fan of the 16\u201d wheels that were popular elsewhere.\nThe big \u201cinside out\u201d brake rotor was used to provide clearance for the virtual\npivot arms; braking was a lot better than expected. The only problem was rapid\npad wear, until race compound pads were installed.\n\nThe seat was shaped by assuming the position and hand forming a piece of\nperforated sheet metal to fit the interface area, then sandwiching it with\nfiberglass. Even with a quarter inch of foam rubber, it was an all-day\ncomfortable seat, or at least it was for 135-pound twenty-something me. The\nonly handling issues were an occasional vague weave, which would go away as\nsoon as the steering system rod ends were oiled. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t use\nTeflon lined rod ends, as stiction in the pivots will make an otherwise good\nsteering system unrideable. By keeping the virtual pivot arm forward rod ends\nas close together as possible, 3 inches apart, the usual steering weirdness\nassociated with the OEC Duplex was completely avoided.\n\nMuch about that project was printed in an article featured in the October 1991\nissue of Motorcyclist magazine. I thought media exposure would change\neverything; all I had to do next was brace myself for the inevitable onslaught\nfrom rabid enthusiasts heaving large sacks of cash at me to build them exotic\nHD powered sportbikes!\n\nYeah, no, that didn\u2019t happen. Maybe it\u2019s because it was based on a Sportster\nand not a Big Twin \u2013 everyone knows which one gets the Big Money! But as well\nas the first one worked, it wasn\u2019t race proven. So clearly another secret to\nsuccess is racing! Sell that first project at a huge loss and build that Big\nTwin racer now!\n\nThe engine/primary/transmission assembly was lifted out of my 1988 FXRS-SP and\nmounted inside a new frame and suspension system. Then, no matter how I\napproached it, it was impossible to escape the fact that the primary case was\ngoing to hit the ground long before it cornered at serious lean angles, even\nwith a custom offset chain drive sprocket. After facing all of that and a lot\nof other design details that weren\u2019t thoroughly thought through, the engine\nwas sold, the leftovers were thrown out, and interest in designing and\nbuilding what I thought were going to be seen as two-wheeled Cobras came to an\nend.\n\n\"Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing.\"\n\n\\- Wernher von Braun\n\nBy this time Ducati was back in the game and winning races with the 851/888\nseries. Harley became a peddler of lifestyle accessories with no apparent\ninterest in roadracing competitively (competently?) anymore.\n\nA few years earlier Kevin Cameron published an article in the January 1987\nissue of Cycle magazine explained why Funny Front Ends weren\u2019t really going to\ndo much and that two-wheel steering could change everything - in theory. I\nthought that was nonsense; FFEs make everything better at braking and turn-in!\nI delighted in late braking with my first project far later than I\u2019d have ever\ndared with other bikes and their icky telescopic forks, and then flicking it\nin for a late apex and hammering the throttle out of the corner. Well, that\nsure is the most exciting way to make riding at 7/10ths feel fast on the\nstreet, but it isn\u2019t really fast. And while the front end always remained\ntotally composed with tons of feel, it was the back end that started to alarm\nme by feeling like it was going to come up and hit me in the back of the head\nunder hard braking braking.\n\nNo amount of component rearrangement would change the fact that motorcycles\ndynamically become virtual unicycles at the extreme ends of performance. Kevin\nwas right - the only way to significantly increase performance is use both\ntires all of the time by increasing the wheelbase and steering both wheels.\nHow do you do that? Well, if national security depended on it (Peace Through\nSuperior Lap Times), it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but my last name isn\u2019t DARPA\nand I don\u2019t have Skunk Works budgets or facilities. None of the chassis\ntheoreticians had any relevant experience or even helpful opinions on the\nsubject; there\u2019s no prior art available. But I really want to know what it\nfeels like to go a lot faster - a challenge that ought to be a lot of fun.\n\nBy this time, the BOTT class was eliminated and national club racing had gone\nentirely to factory production based formulas. Silly peasant, motorcycle\nracing isn\u2019t about racing: it\u2019s about OEMs and organizers! Those icky bike\nbuilders in shabby vans with no advertising budgets shall not sully the\ngleaming row of race transporters and mobile hospitality suites in the pits\nany longer! Well who needs the AMA anyway when the local racing clubs are\nalive and well with accommodating rules? But which engine? Which class? What\u2019s\nthe Next Big Thing?\n\nBob Brant\u2019s excellent 1993 EV book, Alan Cocconi\u2019s electric Honda CRX\nconversion, the GM EV1, the threat of an EV mandate in California, and later,\nthe AC Propulsion T-Zero made the challenge of designing and building a high\nperformance electric motorcycle racer seem like a very exciting opportunity.\nHaving enough kilowatt hours to get a few laps worth of screams and giggles\nmeant that the bike would probably have about a quarter ton of lead-acid\nbatteries \u2013 the far superior lithium battery pack would have cost well into 6\ndigits and was a nightmare to manage. Performing two-wheel steering system\nstability and control experiments with a fast heavy motorcycle sounded like a\nreally bad idea.\n\nA rear steering mixer was designed that would infinitely vary both the front\nto rear steering ratio and the relative direction, but having a two axis\nsteering control with just a handlebar wasn\u2019t feasible. And the anticipated\nstretched out kneeling position was a source of weight distribution,\nstructural, and ergonomic nightmares, even if it looked totally radical.\n\nA visit to a bicycle shop presented an unexpected solution.\n\nI\u2019d previously regarded recumbent bikes as contrarian contraptions, generally\nridden by old guys with degenerative personality disorders. But here in front\nof me at that bicycle shop was an old Ryan recumbent with a long wheelbase and\nan aerodynamic yet comfortable rider position which eliminated all of the\nkneeler design issues \u2013 the perfect configuration. I sit corrected! And for\nthat two axis control, well, just replace the remote handlebar pivot with an\naircraft-style control stick! So I built a lightweight test version of that\nelectric racer that was in my head out of fillet brazed 7/8\u201d and 1-1/8\u201d (which\nfits nicely in cheap conduit benders) mild steel tubing. This time, a full\nframe fixture was built out of straight lengths of wood lath \u2013 good for one\ntime use only, but cheap, easy, and effective. I then discovered that tubes\ncould be held in place with a small blob of Bondo \u2013 by the time they were\ntacked together, the heat would pop off that blob cleanly and the brazed joint\ncould be finished.\n\nAn order was placed for two high-speed Heinzmann electric hubs from a shop in\nEngland, before such hubs became illegal in Europe and unobtainable elsewhere.\nAll of the other hard-to-find electrical bits and pieces came out of the KTA\nServices catalog, a pre-internet gold mine for EV builders. The bike minus the\nbatteries weighed about 70 pounds, and the 3 lead-acid \u201cU1\u201d batteries also\nweighed about 70 pounds. The bike handled somewhat like an airplane \u2013 tilting\nthe stick to the left made the front wheel turn to the right, which made the\nbike roll to the left. That\u2019s just basic counter steering in action, but it\nstill took a lot of unlearning/relearning before I could relax while riding.\n\nThe stick was in two wheel steering/same direction mode almost all of the time\n\u2013 the only time it went into opposite mode was in very low speed sharp\ncorner/U-turn situations. And the biggest surprise came from just going around\nin a fixed circle with different rear steering ratios \u2013 the more both ends\nsteered in the same direction, the smaller the lean angle \u2013 none of the\nsteering theoreticians predicted that. While the two-axis control stick was\ninvaluable for testing, it was not a viable racer control system. Since then,\nthe bike has served as a lovely suspended decoration in my living room.\n\nThe budget still wasn\u2019t there to build a full sized electric racer, but by\nthen the Go-Ped craze was peaking \u2013 all sorts of cheap little bits and pieces\nwere available for their 23cc engines. And there was even a local racing\nseries held in large hotel parking lots around Denver and elsewhere. A 2WS Go-\nPed powered ultra-low recumbent racer was built and tested. The 2WS system\u2019s\n2:1 F/R steering ratio reduced lean angles a lot, making it easy to ride hard\nand slide around; front end slides didn\u2019t result in an instant lowside. I\nfigured that I could make and sell frame kits with little trouble; a humble\nstart in motorsports, but a great way to introduce the 2WS concept to the\nworld and an opportunity to grow towards far greater things!\n\nCycle World expressed interest in both the 2WS Go-Ped racer and the 2WS/2WD\nelectric test bike. Supposedly, articles were written, including one by Kevin\nCameron, only to get canned. I don\u2019t know why and never got to read them, but\nI still have the pictures that were taken for the article.\n\nUnfortunately, the Go-Ped craze soon imploded, taking the racing series and\naftermarket with it. My machine spent the next few years hanging over my desk\n\u2013 my favorite kind of art. Then it became a depressing reminder of what didn\u2019t\nhappen \u2013 nothing new was discovered with it anyway - the engine was sold, and\nthe leftovers were thrown out.\n\nBy now, there was enough information to proceed with confidence on a real 2WS\nmotorcycle. There were also a new set of unknowns, but there\u2019s only one way to\nfind out. All of the known methods and techniques used to make virtual\nunicycles work would probably have detrimental effects on a bike that actually\nuses both tires for traction all of the time.\n\nIs a 50/50 weight distribution going to make the back end step out since it\ndoesn\u2019t transfer enough weight to the rear end under acceleration, or would a\nrear end weight bias work better, especially since the rear tire is wider than\nthe front? Are long swingarms dynamically beneficial or just stress\nmultipliers for a long wheelbase bike? Since total weight transfer isn\u2019t\nhappening anymore, is a half foot of suspension travel even necessary? Is a\nregressive spring rate a good idea with a lot less travel? Is anti-squat on\nthe throttle/chatter off the throttle rear end geometry still a good idea?\nWould some front end brake dive help stabilize the chassis during the\ntransition between braking and cornering? Will linked brakes be effective?\nWhat\u2019s wrong with having steering geometry that works well all of the time?\n\nThe more you study about what others know about motorcycle dynamics, the more\nyou find out that they really don\u2019t know anything at all other than: \u201cThis is\nhow we\u2019ve always done it - it\u2019s the proper way\u201d.\n\nThe budget was nil, again, but low-interest credit cards were easily obtained\nat the time \u2013 why, it would be foolish not to proceed, jump through that wide-\nopen window of opportunity now! So the racer was designed to be dirt cheap and\neasy to build using an EX500 donor bike. It wouldn\u2019t be competitive, but at\nleast it would tell me if I was going in the right direction. The 16\u201d wheels\nhurt it a lot since no race tires fit them, but the shape of the wheel hubs\nmade the machine work a lot easier, especially for the split hub center\nsteering on the rear hub.\n\nIdeally, this sort of work would be done under contract from a large company\nand tested in top secret on proving grounds that don\u2019t show up on maps, with\nonly the fully developed production model revealed to the public many years\nlater. But that\u2019s not how the Backyard Industrial Complex works. It was built\nin my garden shed with square and rectangular steel tubing - no fancy frame\njig required \u2013 3D geometric precision through C-clamps and angle iron. All of\nthe welds were done with a nice little Lincoln MIG unit and cost nothing in\nlabor. All of the machining was done in my kitchen with a small cheap\nlathe/mill combination machine \u2013 very slow, but it made a lot of perfectly\ngood parts when it was too cold/dark/wet to work in the shed.\n\nThe bodywork was also kept as simple as possible, while still trying to keep\nit from being as ugly as possible. Parts which could have been lightened\nconsiderably weren\u2019t; as good as lighter parts are in a racer, additional\nhours of work delay the answer to the most important question: Will it even\nwork?\n\nImage courtesy Tracy Helmhold  \n---  \n  \nIt did work! The local club (MRA) and local track (High Plains Raceway) were\nreally cool about letting me race with them - I can\u2019t say enough good things\nabout them. And even though it wasn\u2019t competitive, operating it in a\ncompetitive environment generated far more valuable experience than just\nrenting the track and droning around with the intent to make haste on the next\nlap, not to mention socially engaging, and even a lot cheaper. Real racing at\na real race track stimulates a mindset that can\u2019t be simulated.\n\n\"The building of the bike is possibly the most interesting part of it. But, I\nsuppose, unless you're prepared to go through with putting it against the\nracing world, well, then, you've really proven nothing.\"\n\n\\- John Britten\n\nImage courtesy Michael Moore  \n---  \n  \nAfter the last race, it was going to become another living room fixture. But\nthen I had an opportunity to show it off at the 2019 Quail event, which\nsounded like a good excuse to take it out one last time. The Quail event was a\nlot of fun \u2013 I got positive coverage from some enthusiastic writers and met a\nlot of interesting people. I'm glad we went.\n\nImage courtesy Michael Moore  \n---  \n  \nAfter a quarter century of electric racer dreaming, the time to wake up and\nactually make one is at hand - or so I\u2019m told. While I would dearly love to\nbuild and race the electric racer that\u2019s in my head (I\u2019m very jealous of my\nmental test rider \u2013 he\u2019s entered countless races, smashed lap records, and\nloves it...), my next racer will have an internal combustion engine for 2\nreasons: weight and cost. Until you see a successful season of high\nperformance air racing with electric airplanes, you won\u2019t see a successful\nseason of high performance roadracing with electric motorcycles for identical\nreasons. As long as I\u2019m using my available credit rather than someone else\u2019s\nlarge sack of cash to finance the next racer, leaded racing gas mixed 20:1\nwith castor oil is still the key to optimizing that !/$ ratio and making the\nfuture awesome.\n\nCheck out Robert's photo gallery for more cool pictures of his work.\n\n\"This new form will have to be a complete concept - not just a mass of little\nimprovements. It is hard to prove the advantages of wings by attaching them to\na toad; they really do work best on a bird. To leap from the toad to the bird\nis generally too radical a step for conservative business corporations. They\nhave invested too much money in producing better toads.\n\nThe novel concepts, therefore, come from nutty individuals, many of whom seem\nto like change for its own sake. Because of this they can make mistakes that\nmake even their good ideas appear laughable; consequently, these ideas must\nwait until traditional thinking is completely bankrupt. Then they are widely\nadopted and labeled 'progress'.\"\n\n\\- Kevin Cameron\n\nContribute to OddBike on Patreon  \n---  \n  \nPosted by\n\nOddBike at\n\n7/15/2019 06:00:00 am\n\nLabels: 2 wheel steering, 2ws, electric, ex500, FFE, funny front end, guest\npost, harley davidson, innovation, kawasaki, ninja, racing, Robert Horn,\nRohorn, sportster\n\n#### 17 comments:\n\n  1.

Now it seems I am semi fascinated by funny\nrear ends as well! The only thing holding me back from full fascination of\nboth was the opinion of a number of significant riders that raced the Britten\nthat they would have done better with a set of forks. Robert Holden in\nparticular always pushed John to change over/back to forks. One rider\nexplained that it was akin to developing a better wheel barrow.

The\nonly addition from my wish-list would be multiple small wheels. Why stop at\ntwo, when you could have 5 smaller steered go-kart wheels like an inline\nskate, all with smaller hub motors.

Needs\nto add your FFE and recumbent. I have been an interested observer from the\ndays of the English Qasar and feet forward movement, 40?yrs ago. Dan Gurneys\nefforts also deserve respect, but is any manufacturer ever going to break the\nmold.
