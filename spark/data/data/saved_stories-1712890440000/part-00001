However, it is not based on\nDOOM; the DESCENT engine works quite differently, using 3-D models (rather\nthan sprites) to render enemy robots, and has \"six degrees of freedom\".\nDESCENT also has very little of the blood or gore of DOOM.\n\nThere were two games made for the DOS platform, DESCENT (1995) and DESCENT II\n(1996, which was also made for Windows 95), as well a sequel for Windows 9x,\nDESCENT^3 (1999). There have been many expansions for and re-releases of each;\nthe Game Info pages detail as many of those that I know about.\n\nFor the moment, the rest of the pages will be concentrating on the first\nmission, DESCENT: First Strike. In the future I may make DESCENT II pages; but\nthat remains to be seen.\n\nQuestions or comments about the pages, a specific level, or Descent in general\nmay be directed to insectoid (at) budwin (dot) net; please put IWP: in the\nsubject line.
