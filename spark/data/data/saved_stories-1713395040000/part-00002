April 17, 2024 - 11 mins\n\ndeveloper altstore\n\nThis is a day I\u2019ve been looking forward to for over 10 years.\n\nI\u2019m thrilled to announce a brand new version of AltStore \u2014 AltStore PAL \u2014 is\nlaunching TODAY as an Apple-approved alternative app marketplace in the EU.\nAltStore PAL is an open-source app store made specifically for independent\ndevelopers, designed to address the problems I and so many others have had\nwith the App Store over the years. Basically, if you\u2019ve ever experienced\nissues with App Review, this is for you!\n\nWe\u2019re launching with 2 apps initially: my all-in-one Nintendo emulator Delta \u2014\na.k.a. the reason I built AltStore in the first place \u2014 and my clipboard\nmanager Clip, a real clipboard manager that can actually run in the\nbackground. Delta will be FREE (with no ads!), whereas Clip will require a\nsmall donation of \u20ac1 or more. Once we\u2019re sure everything is running smoothly\nwe\u2019ll then open the doors to third-party apps \u2014 so if you\u2019d like to distribute\nyour app with AltStore, please get in touch.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the gist! Europeans running iOS 17.4 or later can now install\nAltStore PAL directly from the AltStore website, bringing entirely new apps to\niOS for the first time ever \u2014 including, of course, Delta. This has been a\npersonal dream of mine ever since I started building emulators for iOS over a\ndecade ago, and is what my co-founder Shane Gill and I have been working\ntowards since launching AltStore almost 5 years ago. It truly doesn\u2019t seem\nreal that starting today people can finally use Delta as a real app, and I\ncan\u2019t wait for y\u2019all to experience it \ud83d\udc9c\n\nDelta\u2019s store page in AltStore PAL.\n\n## Sideloading For Everyone\n\nUnlike the App Store, all apps on AltStore are self-hosted. Once an app has\nbeen notarized by Apple, developers can download the processed \u201calternative\ndistribution packet\u201d (ADP) and upload it to their own server. To then\ndistribute with AltStore, a developer just needs to create a \u201csource\u201d \u2014 which\nis just a JSON file containing basic app metadata uploaded to a public URL.\nUsers must then add this source to their AltStore, after which all apps from\nthat source will automatically appear for them to download.\n\nSources are integral to AltStore\u2019s design and allow it to be completely\ndecentralized. This means there is no central directory of apps; the only apps\nyou\u2019ll see in AltStore are from sources you\u2019ve explicitly added yourself. It\u2019s\nup to developers to self-promote their apps and direct users to their\nwebsites, where users can add their source with a single tap via AltStore\u2019s\naltstore://source?url=[source URL] URL scheme (or by copying & pasting the\nsource URL directly). Distributing apps with AltStore is also completely free\nof charge \u2014 anyone can distribute an app for free on AltStore as long as they\nmake a source.\n\nIf you think this all sounds similar to Apple\u2019s recently announced Web\nDistribution feature...that\u2019s because it is! In fact, you can think of\nAltStore not as an app marketplace, but more as a glorified \u201csideloading tool\u201d\nthat simply reads JSON files and automatically notifies users of app updates.\nIf you\u2019ve ever used Sparkle on macOS, sources are very similar conceptually to\na Sparkle XML file \u2014 except in addition to releasing app updates, you also use\nthem to customize your app\u2019s store page in AltStore.\n\nThanks to sources, distributing apps with AltStore is entirely in your control\n\u2014 you decide when to publish new app versions by choosing when to upload your\nupdated source JSON. Of course there\u2019s a bunch more you can do with sources,\nso we\u2019ve updated the AltStore FAQ with complete documentation on the source\nJSON format.\n\nYou can customize your source page with your own personal branding.\n\n## What kinds of apps belong on AltStore?\n\nAll apps are welcome, but I believe AltStore makes the most sense for smaller,\nindie apps that otherwise couldn\u2019t exist due to App Store rules. There are\ncountless examples of these that aren\u2019t allowed in the App Store for one\nreason or another; we just don\u2019t know about them because there\u2019s never been a\ndistribution option for these poor apps.\n\nOne of the most popular apps on AltStore today is UTM, a full-featured virtual\nmachine for iOS and iPadOS. You can use it to literally run Windows on your\niPad. Unfortunately App Review Guideline 5.2 forbids apps from using\n\u201cprotected third-party material such as trademarks, copyrighted works, or\npatented ideas in your app without permission\u201d, which \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\nincludes Windows.\n\nOr take OldOS, a beautifully-made recreation of iOS 4 built entirely in\nSwiftUI. Clearly a labor of love that does no one any harm, but it\u2019s not\nallowed in the App Store because it \u201cappears confusingly similar to an\nexisting Apple product, interface, [or] app\u201d (5.2.5).\n\nOr for an even simpler example, Kotoba is literally just the built-in iOS\ndictionary repackaged into a standalone, easy-to-use app. Yet even it\u2019s not\nallowed because apps can only display third-party content if \u201cyou are\nspecifically permitted to do so under the service\u2019s terms of use\u201d\n(5.2.2)...which apparently does not include the iOS system dictionary\n\u0304\\\\_(\u30c4)_/ \u0304\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the app my high school asked me to build to promote their\nupcoming 5K. I spent months of my sophomore year working on it...yet in the\nend it was rejected because it did \u201cnot provide enough of an engaging and\nlasting iOS specific user experience that is different from that of a web\nbrowser\u201d (4.2), crushing my 16-year-old self \ud83e\udd72\n\nI\u2019m sure you get the point. Not all apps are rejected for interesting reasons;\nsometimes people just want to make cool things that don\u2019t fully align with\nApple\u2019s goals. Our hope with AltStore is to give apps like these another path\nforward. We think iOS as a whole could benefit greatly from giving developers\na chance to fully explore their ideas without arbitrary restrictions, and now\nthat the App Store has real competition, we\u2019re hopeful Apple will feel\npressured to allow apps they otherwise wouldn\u2019t.\n\nAnd in fact...that\u2019s already happened! Just recently, Apple updated their App\nReview Guidelines to officially allow retro game emulators like Delta \u2014 a\nperfect example of a competitive market at work. To be clear, this never would\nhave happened if it wasn\u2019t for the Digital Markets Act, and proves competition\ncan, in fact, pressure Apple to make the App Store better for everyone. I\u2019m\nhopeful we\u2019ll see even more rule changes soon as Apple realizes all the money\nideas they\u2019ve been missing out on (looking at you, clipboard managers!).\n\nOldOS recreates the exact look and feel of iOS 4 \u2014 including a virtual home\nbutton!\n\n## Will there be paid apps?\n\nOf course, this is an app store marketplace after all! However, we\u2019re doing\nsomething a little different: it\u2019s all based around Patreon donations.\n\nIn addition to content restrictions, the App Store also forbids certain\nbusiness models \u2014 such as distributing betas \u201cin exchange for compensation of\nany kind, including as a reward for crowd-sourced funding.\u201d (2.2). This is\nunfortunate, because not only is this a proven way to monetize software in\nother markets, but since launching 5 years ago AltStore and Delta have been\nentirely funded by doing exactly this and providing pre-release access to our\npatrons through our Patreon.\n\nI strongly believe this business model works well \u2014 especially for indie\ndevelopers \u2014 so we\u2019ve gone all-in and added deep Patreon integration to\nAltStore to allow all developers to monetize their apps the same way we do.\nDevelopers can choose to offer some (or all) of their apps to just their\npatrons, and even control which tiers unlock which apps on a per-app basis.\nAnd to further encourage Patreon use, AltStore will take no commission on\nPatreon donations, allowing developers to keep the entirety of their Patreon\nproceeds.\n\nBesides being a new way to monetize apps, it also gives developers a direct,\npersonal relationship with their users. Patreon was built for creators to\nconnect with their audience in ways that just haven\u2019t been possible on the App\nStore, such as providing access to private Discords or offering exclusive\ncontent. Now app developers can leverage this too \u2014 plus you can even issue\nrefunds, what a concept!\n\nOf course, there\u2019s another reason why we encourage developers to distribute\ntheir apps with Patreon: it allows them to cover Apple\u2019s \u20ac0.50-per-user Core\nTechnology Fee.\n\nYou can set a specific pledge amount for Patreon apps, or optionally let users\nchoose their own pledges.\n\n## About that Core Technology Fee...\n\nWhile Apple does waive the CTF for the first million installs of an app, this\ndoes not apply to app marketplaces themselves. This means every download of\nAltStore costs us \u20ac0.50, period. This is clearly unsustainable for a free app\nsupported entirely by donations \u2014 especially considering we already have\nmillions of users \u2014 and we\u2019ve seen a lot of discussion hypothesizing how we\ncould possibly afford this.\n\nTo us though, the answer is obvious...we can\u2019t! So instead, we\u2019re going to\ncharge \u20ac1.50/year for AltStore PAL and pass the CTF onto our users.\n\nWe\u2019ve done the math \u2014 a lot of math \u2014 and \u20ac1.50 is just enough to cover the\nCTF (+ payment processing) for our apps. This obviously isn\u2019t ideal, but our\npriority is making sure we run AltStore sustainably so that developers can\nconfidently distribute their apps with us \u2014 and this ensures we can pay\nApple\u2019s CTF no matter how many users we get.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather not pay though \u2014 or if you\u2018re unlucky enough to live outside\nthe EU \u2014 don\u2019t worry: the existing version of AltStore isn\u2019t going anywhere\nand will remain entirely free to use! Of course, that version has more\nlimitations than AltStore PAL due to how it works (such as requiring a\ncomputer to sideload apps, and having to refresh them every 7 days), so it\u2019s\nup to you whether that\u2019s worth it.\n\n## Seriously...why are you doing all this? Do you really love emulators that\nmuch?\n\nLook, I just wrote a whole blog post trying to answer this very question, so I\nrecommend giving that a read.\n\nBut, this is about much more than emulators. This is about all the indie\ndevelopers who\u2019ve ever received a phone call telling them their app is\nrejected, but not telling them how to fix it; all the high schoolers who\ncouldn\u2019t release their app because it \u201cwasn\u2019t good enough\u201d; all the startups\nwho missed their launch dates due to Apple requesting yet another\nresubmission; all the users who think tech is boring now (it is) and assumes\nthat\u2019s just how it has to be (it doesn\u2019t).\n\nHonestly, Shane and I are heavily inspired by the Super Smash Bros. Melee\ncommunity. They\u2019re some of the most die-hard Nintendo fans you can imagine,\nyet Nintendo does almost everything in their power to push them away. They\nkeep fighting to play this 20-year-old game no matter how many times Nintendo\ntries to stop them, all because they (rightfully) think it\u2019s just that cool.\nNintendo has clearly forgotten how much fans like that matter.\n\nI view Apple and Nintendo as very similar, and just like Nintendo, I think\nApple has forgotten about their biggest fans: indie developers. This is\nincredibly disheartening, because Apple has one of the most vibrant and\ntalented developer communities on the planet. My hope is that AltStore can\npressure Apple into caring about indies more simply by being the best indie\napp marketplace it can be \u2014 because if there\u2019s one thing the Smash community\nhas taught me, it\u2019s that the only way to change the rules is to keep playing\nthe game :)\n\n\u00ab Happy 10th Birthday GBA4iOS!\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n  * Happy 10th Birthday GBA4iOS!\n  * Delta 1.3 - Nintendo DS Emulation For Everyone\n  * Thoughts on the App Store\n  * Introducing Clip\n  * Introducing AltStore\n\n#### Riley Testut\n\nIndependent iOS developer, USC student, and Apple fan.\n\nTweet Share\n\nRiley Testut \u00a9 2024\n\nBased on the Indigo theme by Kopplin\n\n", "frontpage": false}
