We require a paid plan as verification and to cover\nthe additional technical requirements of ensuring safe email sending across\nour platform.\n\nYes, free users can either email us directly in UnInbox or use our community\nchat server on Discord. Paid users receive chat support.\n\nYes, we'll even give you a handy guide to get things set up. Support for self-\nhosting is through our Discord community or by purchasing a support contract.\n\nOur initial focus is ensuring the stability of the email app and a seamless\nuser experience. We'll introduce new features, including the calendar, once\nthe app is stable.\n\nYes, it will come soon after launch and let you create email aliases either\nwith our domain UnAlias.com or your own custom domains.\n\nYes.\n\nYes. We encrypt data at rest and in transit. Emails will be encrypted via TLS\nwhen available. It's a top priority for us to add robust encryption measures\nfor emails. We're working to seamlessly implement additional encryption\n(S/MIME, PGP) without disrupting any features / functioning, ensuring smooth\nemail transfers and sharing within the organization.\n\nWe aim to make De-Googling and migrating from other email service providers\nsuper easy. While it's not possible yet, it's on our list of priorities.\n\nYes, over time, prices may increase due to rising costs. However, if you have\nan active subscription, your price will be locked in until your subscription\nexpires.\n\nNo, we are built on very different technologies and there's simply no way to\nmake them compatible. If you really need to use another email client, check\nfor another service or use our forwarding feature.\n\nYes, you get a personal email address with UnInbox, and a dedicated forwarding\naddress. Any emails sent to your forwarding address will appear in your\nUnInbox. You can also forward all emails for a custom domain to your UnInbox\norganization.\n\nYes, in order to bring our vision to life, we will need significant time and\nresources. Crowdfunding, donations and bootstrapping were deeply considered,\nbut deemed not viable enough for our vision. Any potential investor will be\ncarefully vetted by our founders - and by peers in the open source community -\nto ensure they align with our open source principles, and it will be made\nabundantly clear that an acquisition is not in our future. Special agreements\nwill be put into place to ensure the longevity of UnInbox if we were ever to\nhalt doing business.\n\n100% of the code for all the features and functionality needed to run your own\ninstance of UnInbox are released under a permissive software license called\nAGPLv3. This allows anyone to copy the code and modify it however they want,\nso long as they also release the code publicly under the same license. A few\nfeatures or modules in the app are not open source, but instead released under\na commercial license and mostly publicly available. These features or modules\nare things that are only relevant to large enterprise companies such as SSO or\nOIDC - or related to the billing system of UnInbox.\n\nUnInbox will be offering data storage in the US with global replication or an\nEU only hosting at launch. You will be able to choose your region at account\ncreation.\n\nOur OSS Friends\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024. All rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
