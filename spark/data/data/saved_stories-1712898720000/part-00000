She quickly\nlearned how to meet with families and give dogs and cats basic physical exams\nand shots.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d said Sylvia, who is interning with the pet hospital again\nas a senior and hopes to work there full time after attending Purdue\nUniversity. \u201cI got to put myself into the vet\u2019s shoes.\u201d\n\nVictory\u2019s program is a leader in Indiana in connecting high school students to\nworkplace experiences, even for a state that\u2019s made work-based learning a\npriority in recent years and hopes to transform high school by making it a\ncenterpiece of student\u2019s high school experience. The Indiana Department of\nEducation gave Victory and the program one of three Excellence in Student\nPathways awards last fall.\n\nNow in its fifth year, the program places students each spring with three\ndozen businesses and nonprofits as part of their regular school week, busing\nthem to workplaces when needed.\n\n\u201cWhat sets us apart here is this is compulsory for 11th, and 12th graders,\u201d\nsaid Andrew Hayenga, the school\u2019s chief development officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not\nreserved for the top 10% of kids. It\u2019s not reserved for the kids who may want\nto go into a trade. We\u2019re trying to open the possibilities up to every student\nin 11th and 12th grade.\u201d\n\nRahul Jyoti, the school\u2019s readiness director, said many schools might balk at\ngiving up class time for 11 Fridays out of a 40-week school year to career\nexposure, often out of worry that students\u2019 test scores in math and English\nmight suffer.\n\nBut Victory considers it a crucial part of students\u2019 education, particularly\nthose who are low-income; and whose parents don\u2019t have connections in high-\npaying fields. Jyoti said many students were graduating without knowing what\ncareers they could seek or chose majors in college that weren\u2019t leading to\ngood fits for them, so the school needed to step in and help.\n\n\u201cWe know the academics are important, but we realized that no matter how\nstrong their academics are, if they don\u2019t have that networking, professional\nexperience and the soft skills, they are not able to be truly ready to go to\ncollege and truly ready to grow into a career,\u201d Jyoti said. \u201cTaking away those\ndays throughout the year actually helps them to be more prepared on all the\nother school days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ended up having our juniors and seniors be the most professional students,\nbeing more successful in college, and being really engaged in presenting\nthemselves after they graduate because they\u2019ve had so many of these\nexperiences,\u201d he added.\n\nBusinesses and nonprofits have stepped up to take on student interns, with\nmany participating in the program year after year.\n\nChad Miller, managing director of Miller Insurance Group, said his small\nbusiness couldn\u2019t take on a full-time intern, but Victory organizes the\nprogram, has students go to businesses for a reasonable amount of time and\neven gives employers a guide on how to help students.\n\n\u201cThis is a commitment that I feel like I and my team can bite off and it\u2019s\nsustainable for us and hopefully provides a value to them,\u201d Miller said.\n\nShamika Buchanan, owner of Intelligent Minds Child Development, said interns\nat her daycare center \u201chave been amazing.\u201d She tries to have students learn\nboth about child care and how to run the business.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d Buchanan told other businesses as the program\nlaunched for the year in the fall, \u201cWe\u2019ve grown together. I\u2019ve even employed\nsome over the summer to come and work for my childcare.\u201d\n\nThe pet hospital has also asked Sylvia to fill in for absent employees outside\nof her internship.\n\n\u201cOur relationship has grown incredibly strong,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always rely on\nme for multiple things, so I\u2019m excited to be part of their group.\u201d\n\nVictory can\u2019t always find such perfect matches for students, Jyoti admits,\nsince there are a limited number of employers volunteering for the program. So\nthe school tries to find close or related matches, and stresses that time in\nany workplace develops skills students can use anywhere.\n\n\u201cI tell the students, you are not necessarily learning about the field you\u2019re\ninterested in, but it\u2019s still a really valuable experience,\u201d Jyoti said.\n\u201cBeing successful in any field requires skills in a professional way that\nyou\u2019re going to learn. And most of our partners are small business owners that\nhave a lot of different areas and functions in their business. So students,\neven if they are not 100% sure of what they want to do, can find something to\nbe engaged with at their site.\u201d\n\nSenior Devin Stewart, who will attend Purdue University to pursue a career in\ncybersecurity and information technology, is one of those students who did not\nhave a direct match to his career plans. After interning with a public\nrelations firm as a junior, he\u2019s interning with a community development and\naffordable housing nonprofit as a senior.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t mind because he\u2019s learning how businesses work.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be valuable for me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom has always had an\nidea for me to start a business on my own, so with business development, and\nthings of that nature, it\u2019ll help me have the skills that I need to\npotentially start a business if I want.\u201d\n\nGet stories like these delivered straight to your inbox.
