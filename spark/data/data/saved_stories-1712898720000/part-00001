Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the\ncontent's credibility:\n\nfact-checked\n\ntrusted source\n\nproofread\n\n# Flourishing romances are more the result of proactive behaviors than\nsoulmate spark, study finds\n\nby Brigham Young University\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nSixty percent of Americans believe in the idea that true love is found in a\none-and-only soulmate relationship, confirming that the quest to find one's\nsoulmate continues to play a significant role in our modern dating culture.\nHowever, a new report finds that enduring connection in romantic relationships\nresults more from the personal virtues and intentional efforts of the\npartners, than it does from spontaneous love and emotional spark.\n\nThe report, \"The Soulmate Trap: Why Embracing Agency-Based Love is the Surest\nPath to Creating a Flourishing Marriage,\" from the Wheatley Institute at\nBrigham Young University, presents extended analysis from a recent study\ninvolving 615 couples (1,230 individuals) across the United States and Canada.\nThe report challenges the notion that loving and lasting relationships are\nfounded on the idea of a soulmate love.\n\nInstead, the study finds that couples who are flourishing are significantly\nmore likely than other couples to engage in proactive behaviors such as\nshowing compassion to each other, spending meaningful time together, regularly\nengaging in acts of kindness, and participating in regular maintenance\nbehaviors to improve their relationship. In fact, flourishing couples report\nscores that are typically three times higher than other couples on these\nintentional aspects of relationships.\n\n\"While I believe that the root desire to be connected to 'the one' in a\nspecial and enduring marriage is a healthy aspiration, I am concerned about\nthe risks soulmate thinking poses for healthy relationships, especially among\nyoung adults, said Jason Carroll, the Director of the Family Initiative at the\nWheatley Institute and lead author of the report.\n\n\"The problem with the soulmate model of marriage is that it provides a deeply\nflawed conception of how to achieve this aspiration. This is because soulmate\nbeliefs tend to place relationship success outside of one's agency or\nchoices.\"\n\nThe report examined how personal virtues and proactive behaviors are closely\nassociated with the quality of relationships using data from the recently\npublished study \"Satisfaction or Connectivity?: Implications from the Strong\nRelationality Model of Flourishing Couple Relationships\" published in the\nJournal of Marital and Family Therapy. The study compared high-connection and\nlow-connection couples to see what makes high-connection couples different\nthan other couples.\n\nCouples were compared on relationship factors including:\n\n  * Personal virtues including, commitment, other-centeredness and compassion,\n  * Responsible actions such as acts of kindness, quality time together, and relationship maintenance, and\n  * Relationship outcomes including satisfaction and meaning in life.\n\nAmong the report's findings:\n\n  * Spouses in high-connection marriages have a nearly three times higher average percentile score on commitment to their relationship than do spouses in low-connection marriages (72% vs. 26%).\n  * The average percentile score on personal virtues, such as other-centeredness and compassion, is nearly three times higher for spouses in highly connected marriages compared to those in low-connection marriages (other-centeredness = 60% vs. 21% and compassion = 56% vs. 18%).\n  * High-connection marriages have more than three times high scores on proactive behaviors than low connection couples, specifically in spending meaning time together (71% vs. 19%), doing acts of kindness for each other (72% vs. 18%), and forgiving offenses in their marriage (70% vs. 21%).\n  * Spouses in high-connection marriages score nearly twice as high as spouses in lowconnection marriages on relationship maintenance behaviors, such as addressing problems and finding ways to strengthen their relationship together (53% vs. 30%).\n  * Spouses in high-connection marriages score more than twice as high as spouses in low-connection marriages on their ratings of their current levels of life satisfaction (63% vs. 27%) and the amount of meaning and purpose they have in their lives (60% vs. 30%).\n\n\"At their core, soulmate beliefs provide a backwards depiction of the proper\nsequence of healthy relationship development. Such beliefs suggest that\nsomeone exists as your 'one and only' before you have even met. However, the\nfindings of our study illustrate that oneness in marriage is primarily made,\nnot found,\" said Adam Galovan, a professor at the University of Alberta and a\nco-author of the report.\n\nIn other words, rather than finding your soulmate, Galovan suggests finding\nsomeone that you like and get along with and seeing how the relationship\ndevelops rather than worrying about finding \"the one.\" Then once both partners\nhave committed to the relationship, he says, \"They should put effort into\nbuilding a 'soulmate' relationship with the person they've committed to.\"\n\n\"Agency-based understandings of love are particularly important as couples\ntransition out of the early phases of initiation and attraction in their\nrelationship and need to create enduring patterns of partnership and romantic\ncompanionship,\" added David Schramm, an associate professor at Utah State\nUniversity and co-author of the report.\n\n\"Our research shows that lasting marriages tend to be true partnerships in\nwhich spouses are devoted to creating a shared life together that is deeper\nthan the emotional payoff of the marriage.\"\n\nThe authors of the report recommend that single adults shift their thinking\nfrom finding a \"One-and-Only\" relationship to creating what they call an\n\"Only-One\" marriage. The report details five solutions for setting aside\nsoulmate thinking:\n\n  * Avoiding a consumer approach to relationships,\n  * Fostering realistic expectations about relationships,\n  * Developing a mature understanding of love,\n  * Following healthy dating trajectories, and\n  * Maintaining optimism while resolving break-ups.\n\nEvidence shows that humans have a unique capacity for deep attachment in long-\nterm relationships such as marriage. The report's authors conclude that\ncultural myths surrounding the search for \"the one\" may be undermining the\nquality and longevity of these relationships while a focus on personal virtues\nand purposeful behaviors has been found to help couples achieve higher rates\nof relational connectivity and flourishing in marriage.\n\nMore information: The Soulmate Trap\n\nProvided by Brigham Young University\n\nCitation: Flourishing romances are more the result of proactive behaviors than\nsoulmate spark, study finds (2024, April 5) retrieved 11 April 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-04-flourishing-romances-result-proactive-\nbehaviors.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
