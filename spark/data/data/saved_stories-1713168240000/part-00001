Stories are usually defined by progress: the\ndevelopment of events toward their conclusions, characters toward their fates,\nquestions toward understanding, themes toward fulfillment. But unlike\nmarriage, murder, and war, rejection offers no obstacles to surmount,\nmilestones to mark, rituals to observe. If a plot point is a shift in a state\nof affairs\u2014the meeting of a long-lost twin, the fateful red stain on a\nhandkerchief\u2014rejection offers none; what was true before is true after.\nNothing happens, no one is materially harmed, and the rejected party loses\nnothing but the cherished prospect of something they never had to begin with.\nIf the romance plot sets up an enticing question\u2014Will they or won\u2019t they?\u2014the\nrejection plot spoils everything upfront: they won\u2019t. There the story stalls;\nbut, strangely, continues. Even with no hope of requital, desire can persist,\neven intensify, with no guarantee of ending. The lack of happening is the\ntragedy.\n\nRejection isn\u2019t the same as heartbreak, which entails a past acceptance. A\nrejection implies that you don\u2019t even warrant a try. From the reject\u2019s\nperspective, the reciprocity of heartbreak looks pretty appealing. And if\nyou\u2019re going to suffer, it may as well be exciting. Who would choose the flat\ndesolation of rejection over rough-and-tumble drama, especially if they end\nthe same way? The clich\u00e9\u2014tis better to have loved and lost than never to have\nloved at all\u2014is comforting to the heartbroken, but damning to the rejected. No\nmatter how unpleasant or unequal, a breakup is at least something you share\nwith someone else. Rejection makes only one reject. \u201cUnrequited love does not\ndie,\u201d writes Elle Newmark in The Book of Unholy Mischief, \u201cit\u2019s only beaten\ndown to a secret place where it hides, curled and wounded. For some\nunfortunates, it turns bitter and mean, and those who come after pay the price\nfor the hurt done by the one who came before.\u201d A story that begins with\nclosure can never end.\n\nThe basic plot of rejection is simple. First comes the yearning, where \u201cby the\nsuccessive inventions of his desires, his regrets, his disappointments, and\nhis projects, the lover constructs an entire novel around a woman he does not\nknow,\u201d as Proust writes. Eventually you make a proposition and are declined.\nYou may try again, but only the same happens\u2014nothing.\n\nWhat science has to say about rejection is mostly what everyone already knows:\nit\u2019s real and it hurts. In an fMRI study researcher Naomi Eisenberger\ndemonstrated that being rejected lights up the dorsal anterior cingulate\ncortex, the part of the brain that deals with physical pain, with a\ncorresponding release of dopamine and cortisol. The social psychologists Roy\nBaumeister and Dawn Dhavale\u2019s study \u201cTwo Sides of Romantic Rejection,\u201d typical\nof much writing in their field, spells out common sense to a point of absurd\nrigor (they note that \u201cit is better to be intelligent and beautiful than\nstupid and ugly\u201d). They define romantic rejection as a situation in which \u201ca\nperson refuses the romantic advances of another, ignores / avoids or is\nrepulsed by someone who is romantically interested in them, or unilaterally\nends an existing relationship.\u201d The measure of rejection is the \u201cdiscrepancy\nbetween desired and perceived relational evaluation,\u201d which is \u201cthe degree to\nwhich a person regards his or her relationship with another individual as\nvaluable, important, or close\u201d\u2014in other words, you want your relationship to\nmatter to the other person more than it does. Certain categories of people are\nmore likely to be rejected: those considered \u201cdangerous, having little to\noffer, as exploitative, or rejecting of us.\u201d And the leading cause of\nrejection, they argue, is hypergamy: desiring people more desirable than\noneself.\n\nMost notably, they observe that \u201cthe culture has not provided them with good,\neffective scripts for rejecting love,\u201d causing them to experience \u201ca pervasive\nsense of scriptlessness.\u201d Rejectors have their prefab lines (\u201cIt\u2019s not you,\nit\u2019s me,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not dating right now,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not a good match\u201d), but rejects\ndon\u2019t. What is there to say, after all?\n\nTo whatever extent the mind is a part of nature, it too abhors a vacuum. Just\nas infatuation drives you to project intimate fantasies onto strangers, the\nblank slate of rejection, the lack of a script, invites you to devise an\nelaborate narrative about why you were rejected, and what that says about you.\nBut even stronger than the temptation to dwell in the past (what might have\nhappened) or dread the future (what won\u2019t be) is the urge to wallow in an\neternal present. Your life can\u2019t move forward, so it moves sideways, to a\nparallel reality. At parties you imagine the date you didn\u2019t bring, then go\nhome to share your bed with a ghost. Absence becomes the realest thing in your\nworld. So the true rejection plot is the one the reject devises in the absence\nof a plot.\n\n***\n\nNarrative is a way of giving not only shape and coherence to chaos, but\nprogress and closure; its absence creates a feeling of endless languishing.\nFor this reason one often sees rejection described as halting time, as Miss\nHavisham orders every clock stopped at the precise minute she was left at the\naltar, wallows in her moldering wedding clothes, and makes Estella and Pip\nreenact the romance that ended with her stood up at the altar. (\u201cI sometimes\nhave sick fancies,\u201d she tells Pip, \u201cand I have a sick fancy that I want to see\nsome play.\u201d) In Cut Loose, Helen Fisher quotes an anonymous eighth-century\nJapanese poet who writes, \u201cMy longing has no time when it ceases\u201d; the men of\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s Sepik River province who\u2019ve had their marriage offers\nrejected compose songs describing the marriages that could have been.\n\nIn this way, the true object of your fixation may not be your rejector, but\nrather the fantasy devised in the process of yearning. The perfection of this\nfantasy makes it hard to give up. (Proust: \u201cWhat is necessary is the\nrisk\u2014which may even be the object to which passion in its fretfulness tries to\ncling, rather than to a person\u2014of an impossibility.\u201d) Your secret hope is to\nbecome Pygmalion, convinced that your desire can somehow be made real through\nsheer agonizing persistence. Pygmalion, it\u2019s worth remembering, is disgusted\nby real women (\u201cdismayed by the numerous defects / of character Nature had\ngiven the feminine spirit, / stayed as a bachelor, having no female\ncompanion\u201d) and only loves the one he creates by his own hand.\n\nDevotion\u2014putting someone in an exalted position, as Pygmalion places Galatea,\non a literal pedestal\u2014feels like empathy, in their shared sense of\nunderstanding someone deeply, but is actually the opposite. When wishful\nthinking becomes confused with reality, the real person vanishes, as does the\nentire world around that person. The thing you\u2019ve been denied is always\nperfect. In \u201cTo a Magazine,\u201d Mary Ruefle writes, \u201cthe rejected know another\nknowledge\u2014that if they were not rejected, heaven would descend upon the earth\nin earthly dreams [...] The rejected know if they were nonrejected a clear\ncerulean blue would be the result, an endless love ever dissolving in more\nendless love.\u201d For all their power over the nature of your imagined reality,\nit can feel as if the rejector is a divinity of sorts\u2014Borges writes, \u201cTo fall\nin love is to create a religion with a fallible god,\u201d noting also that\nBeatrice had rejected Dante in life (\u201cInfinitely Beatrice existed for Dante;\nDante existed very little, perhaps not at all, for Beatrice. Our piety, our\nveneration cause us to forget that pitiful inharmony, which was unforgettable\nfor Dante\u201d). And so in his own poem he makes Beatrice the immortal docent of\nHeaven, a place he doesn\u2019t belong. One is only rejected from Heaven, never\nHell.\n\n***\n\nThe rejection plot usually peters out, as over time the wound becomes less\ninteresting and meaningful. But this isn\u2019t always the case; what if they\nchange their mind? What if you can help them change their mind? Such hope is\noften toxic, but not always unwarranted. Everyone has heard of a case where\nsomeone\u2019s ill-advised, ethically dubious persistence paid off\u2014He just wore me\ndown!\u2014which means you can never fully convince yourself that any rejection is\ntruly final. (\u201cIn a surprising minority of cases,\u201d write Baumeister and\nDhavale in their study on rejection, \u201cstalkers eventually become the romantic\npartners of the people they have stalked.\u201d)\n\nAnd so another way of answering rejection is to be willfully oblivious: to\nreject rejection, through sheer gumption or delusion. Pride and Prejudice is\nfull of rejections issued and ignored, preemptive and rescinded. When the\narrogant Mr. Collins receives Elizabeth\u2019s firm refusal of his marriage\nproposal, he tells her:\n\n> \u201cI am not now to learn,\u201d replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\n> hand, \u201cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man\n> whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour;\n> and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I\n> am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall\n> hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\u201d\n\nHe later adds, \u201cAs I must, therefore, conclude that you are not serious in\nyour rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of\nincreasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant\nfemales.\u201d\n\nNot taking the hint is a strategy of attrition; keeping the proposition on the\ntable indefinitely, you hope, will increase your odds. Since you can\u2019t just\nswitch off your feelings for someone, you hold out for the unlikely reversal,\neven at the expense of your well-being. The fact that this is possible (which\nis not to say wise, ethical, or appropriate) permits the reject to believe\nagainst all evidence that a mistake has been made, that everything could work\nout if enough of an effort is made. The reject haggles, disputes, demands to\nknow why, tries to poke holes in something that isn\u2019t an argument, until\neventually he turns into something uglier: the creep. For its ability to\nrepulse and coerce, creepiness can be a strange form of power, one perhaps\neven unsought by the one who wields it, since it can feel more like\npowerlessness. But no one said power always feels good.\n\n***\n\nOne of the oddest stories of rejection in the internet age was authored\nspontaneously by dozens of people. Known informally as \u201cThe Saga of Denko,\u201d it\nbegan in 2011 with a post on the anonymous Japanese message board 2channel\n(#OP is the original poster, and #2ch are his responders):\n\n> [Help!] The Girl I Like Won\u2019t Respond to My Emails ( \u0301\u00b7\u03c9\u00b7`)\n>\n> #OP\n>\n> There\u2019s this girl I\u2019ve had feelings for since high school, and now we\u2019re in\n> college together. We\u2019ll call her Denko.\n>\n> Once we hit second year, we went out drinking, and I worked up the courage\n> to exchange numbers.\n>\n> We started out talking often, but she hasn\u2019t answered me in three days now.\n>\n> I\u2019m getting depressed just thinking that Denko might be sick, or that\n> something happened to her... ( \u0301\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`)\n>\n> Please, somebody give me some advice.\n\nAt first the reactions #OP gets range from earnest to mocking, until he\nreveals that he has been emailing her six hundred times a day with no\nresponse, at which point the board begins heckling him; #OP keeps asking for\nadvice anyway. Across five threads totaling over 18,000 words in the English\ntranslation, #OP reveals himself by turns to be a guilelessly deluded,\nobsessive stalker. Convinced that Denko secretly likes him but won\u2019t admit it,\nhe interprets everything as encouragement, never questioning his own motives\nor Denko\u2019s interest. By his own account, he begins calling her at home, then\nvisiting her house to look for her. When she emails him to tell him to stop\nemailing her, and threatens to call the police, he wonders if she\u2019s testing\nhim, or if her mother put her up to it.\n\nFrom this point on, the community\u2019s tone shifts from jeering to morbid\nfascination: several try to egg him on further, suggesting he keep trying, or\nstuff thirty hamsters in a box and send them to her. Some try in good faith to\nshout above the noise and get him to see his own delusion, or convince him of\nDenko\u2019s obvious lack of interest; in others, it\u2019s less clear whether he\u2019s\nbeing mocked, or defended by someone equally deluded:\n\n> #2ch\n>\n> Screw you guys. OP\u2019s persistence should be COMMENDED.\n>\n> Sending massive amounts of emails out of worry!\n>\n> Buying clothes to improve his appearance!\n>\n> And I say try even harder!\n>\n> Send 1000 emails a day!\n>\n> Girls love men who worry about them!\n>\n> #2ch\n>\n> I know I\u2019D hate you.\n>\n> #2ch\n>\n> Serious post here.\n>\n> If you don\u2019t get a reply after three times, stop.\n>\n> If she\u2019s making excuses about work and busyness, she really doesn\u2019t like\n> you.\n>\n> She\u2019s only not saying it because she thinks it would hurt you.\n>\n> Denko getting 600 emails from a guy who isn\u2019t even her boyfriend is no doubt\n> going to scare her.\n>\n> But she\u2019s probably a nice girl if she isn\u2019t admitting it.\n>\n> There are people out there who just can\u2019t be blunt.\n>\n> So stop it, please.\n>\n> #2ch\n>\n> Even from a boyfriend, 600 emails in three days is scary.\n\n#OP maintains his obliviousness, acknowledging the bullying replies with\npolite befuddlement, and he eventually shares an email that he sends to Denko:\n\n> #OP\n>\n> Subject: This Is How I Feel\n>\n> Contents:\n>\n> I\u2019m sorry for making you worry.\n>\n> I would never consider killing or raping you, Denko, so don\u2019t worry. Is that\n> what you thought I would do?\n>\n> Now, I want you to take what I\u2019m saying seriously.\n>\n> I really, truly love you, Denko.\n>\n> I think I would be willing to die for you, Denko.\n>\n> I\u2019ve always been trying to ensure your happiness first.\n>\n> And I don\u2019t think my feelings for you will ever change.\n>\n> It\u2019s very unfortunate things got like this right after we started dating,\n> but we can start over.\n>\n> That would be great, wouldn\u2019t it?\n>\n> Remember what I said when I confessed to you?\n>\n> I still feel the way I did back then...\n\nAfter nearly a month of these posts, OP signs off, the end of his saga\ninconclusive. As it often goes with internet folklore, the story\u2019s provenance\nhas become disputed. It\u2019s not clear whether #OP was as guileless as he\nacted\u2014the story\u2019s coherence, and his willingness to ignore and carry on\nagainst overwhelming opprobrium, is highly suspect, and the post\u2019s translator\nalso unearthed a post from three weeks earlier by someone who used the same \u201c(\n\u0301\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`)\u201d kaomoji, claiming that he\u2019d sent six hundred emails to see if his\ncrush was safe after an earthquake. It\u2019s also possible #OP posed as some of\nhis own hecklers.\n\nSuppose this is the case\u2014that it was a social experiment, a fictional story\ndesigned to elucidate something about rejection communally. Ordinarily the\ngoal of trolling is to either make people angry, expose their gullibility, or\ndraw out their ugly qualities. But mixed in with the trolls are attempts to\ncommunicate or commiserate with the hapless #OP; rather than ragebait, he\nmanaged to make empathybait, curiositybait. Here we are, contemplating him\nnow. Can attention be a form of acceptance?\n\n***\n\nThere may be no good way to accept rejection, but there are many terrible\nways, and frustration often makes a turn toward anger. A 2015 article in The\nCut, \u201cIs There Any Right Way to Reject a Guy?,\u201d describes an incident with Ben\nSchoen, the former host of a popular Harry Potter podcast. It began with\nSchoen sending flirtatious Twitter DMs to the BuzzFeed writer Grace Spelman;\nwhen Spelman didn\u2019t reply, he took to Facebook (where seven years earlier, as\na fourteen-year-old Harry Potter fan, Spelman had added him as a friend) and\nsent her a series of DMs:\n\n> Grace you do a remarkable job of making your personality shine through\n> online\n>\n> It\u2019s hyperactively beautiful\n>\n> And you seem really introspective\n>\n> So what I\u2019m saying here is you wanna get married at one of those drive thru\n> places\n>\n> If you can\u2019t handle such spontaneity I understand how I might be getting\n> ahead of myself\n>\n> I\u2019m starting a new podcast I would love for you to listen and if you like it\n> I would love having you on an episode\n>\n> You had me when you posted that Kendrick Lamar vid\n>\n> That\u2019s when I realized you are probably definitely a special soul (aka \u201cthe\n> one\u201d)\n>\n> That smile emoji was unintentionally creepy\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to observe how, consciously or not, the messages are crafted\nto preempt rejection. Though obviously motivated by sincere attraction, they\nmove from over-the-top flattery (\u201chyperactively beautiful\u201d) to facetious\nflirtation (\u201cwanna get married\u201d) that is intended to soften the pitch, so it\ncan be played off as a joke if it fails. He then nods at the possibility of\nrejection (\u201cI might be getting ahead of myself\u201d), while implying that the only\nreason she might reject him is because she \u201ccan\u2019t handle such spontaneity\u201d\u2014her\nfault, not his. The proposition is garnished with a career opportunity,\nfollowed by more hyperbolic flattery and self-deprecation.\n\nSpelman let Schoen down easy, leavening her response with the type of\nexclamation points one might use in a work email: \u201cHi Ben! Thank you for the\nkind words but I actually have a boyfriend! Hope you stay well!\u201d She then\nunfriended him on Facebook and blocked him on Twitter.\n\nSoon after, Schoen flung insults at Spelman publicly on Twitter:\n\n> just bc you work at Buzzfeed doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re good. Good luck finding\n> meaning in all that garbage you call content\n>\n> and u don\u2019t even have the fortitude to tell me to fuck off? You have 10,000\n> followers bc of a good profile pic + listicles\n>\n> the way you ghosted me was immature and insulting. I Messaged you to make u\n> laugh nothing more\n>\n> before you 86 someone maybe you should use your intellect and see if the\n> person could be useful to your career?\n>\n> it\u2019s funny. You delete me off Facebook when I was about to offer you a job\n> at a company in NY that pays at least double\n\nIn the reverse-polarity of rejection, every quality he previously flattered\nher for is now wielded against her. If before she was \u201cbeautiful,\u201d now she is\nnothing but \u201ca good profile pic.\u201d Her introspection is recast as rude and\nimmature; having once praised her online content, now he uses it to trivialize\nher. He accuses her of lacking the \u201cfortitude\u201d to reject him properly, even\nthough clearly stating your unavailability is a classically proper rejection.\nAny implication that his podcast offer was a veiled quid pro quo is now made\nexplicit as a playground taunt: I was gonna give you something cool, but now\nI\u2019m not gonna.\n\nIn the article, Spelman assessed Schoen\u2019s response frankly: \u201cYou can\u2019t win in\nthese types of situations. Even if you are polite in your rejection, they\u2019ll\ndemand that you tell them WHY you did it. It\u2019s just a mixture of entitlement\nand the fragility of the ego.\u201d True enough; the demand for an explanation\nstems from a hope that the rejector can be somehow proven wrong. But except in\nrare cases of misunderstanding\u2014the Mr. Darcy kind, far rarer than any reject\nwould like to believe\u2014the rejector is always right. If someone isn\u2019t attracted\nto you, that\u2019s neither their choice nor your business. And however convinced\nyou may be that someone would be happier if they accepted your affections,\ntheir happiness is still their prerogative, and they aren\u2019t obligated to let\nyou prove otherwise. In fact, nobody is obligated to love anybody; it isn\u2019t\neven possible to put anyone under those obligations, and as convenient as it\nwould be if love were rational, it has no criterion other than whether it is\nfelt. Love, we must repeat, is a matter of taste, and so cannot be disputed.\n\n***\n\nIn Miss Manners\u2019 Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior (1982), Judith\nMartin offers a pragmatic path to solace:\n\n> The rejectee\u2019s first duty (and only available pleasure) is to turn down any\n> such offer [of consolation or friendship]. One ought to reply, as the\n> Republican Party is said to have done to Mr. Nixon when he offered to help\n> with the 1976 election, \u201cThank you, but I think you\u2019ve done enough already.\u201d\n>\n> The smartest thing a dumped one can do is to get out of sight, or at least\n> to hide all traces of misery. This is not easy to do, but it is one of those\n> rare instances in which the hardest work brings the greatest chance of\n> success.\n>\n> Success, in this case, must be defined as making the other person suffer as\n> much as oneself ... Such suffering is never caused by see-how-miserable-you-\n> made-me-feel. It is caused, as the rejectee ought to know, by the\n> realization that a person who used to love you doesn\u2019t any longer. Thus, the\n> proper behavior for someone whose heart is breaking is to be cheerful, not\n> pained; ungrudgingly forgiving, not accusing; busy, not free to be\n> comforted; mysterious, not willing to talk the situation over; absent, not\n> obviously alone or overdoing attentions to others.\n\nHere Martin plays the astute friend who, to avoid condescending to you,\ndoesn\u2019t try to minimize your pain. Instead she validates your desire for\nrevenge, framing your rejector\u2019s suffering as the \u201conly available pleasure.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a shame, then, her basic assumption\u2014that rejectors suffer most when you\nmove on\u2014is plainly untrue. Rejectors, obviously, want you to forgive and\nforget, fast. Which means if you really wanted to make them suffer, you\u2019d\napply yourself single-mindedly to \u201csee-how-miserable-you-made-me-feel.\u201d\n\nSo while the classy, healthy, and ethical thing to do is move on, what would\ntruly please you, following Martin\u2019s logic, is revenge. As we\u2019re told that you\ncan only hurt the ones you love, the capacity to wound even furnishes proof of\nthat love. Certainly this comes at the cost of their affection, but what can\nthey do, reject you again? This might explain why, in lieu of love, certain\ndesperates will fashion from rejection a different plot. They seek a bond\nthat\u2014like the idealized, imagined love they\u2019ve lost\u2014is exclusive and\npermanent: the bond of death, which has its own clich\u00e9: If I can\u2019t have you,\nnobody will.\n\n***\n\nIn the revenge plot, both in literature and life, a woman\u2019s life is often\nforfeit. Roderigo, turned down by Desdemona, and Iago, passed over for a\npromotion, conspire to manipulate Othello into murdering Desdemona. Phaedra,\nspurned by Hippolytus, kills herself and frames him for it, leading to his\ndeath. In The Brothers Karamazov, Elder Zosima tells the story of a friend who\nin his youth killed a woman who rejected him, got away with it, and only years\nlater confesses his crime. Even when Goethe\u2019s Werther takes his own life after\nbeing rejected by Charlotte and the Weimar nobility, it\u2019s mentioned in passing\nthat \u201cCharlotte\u2019s life was despaired of.\u201d (Not just hers\u2014the book spawned an\noutbreak of real-world copycat suicides.)\n\nHannah Arendt called loneliness \u201cthe common ground for terror\u201d\u2014the double\nentendre being common. An analysis of fifteen mass shootings between 1995 and\n2001 found that at least six perpetrators had \u201cexperienced a recent romantic\nrejection\u201d; 97 percent of all 197 American mass shootings since 1966 were\ncommitted by men, and 46 percent of mass shootings between 2015 to 2022\ntargeted current or former romantic partners or family members. In The Bully\nSociety, Jessie Klein writes that \u201cin at least twenty-three school shootings,\nthe perpetrators\u2019 stated motives related to relationship stresses: rejection,\njealousy, a desire to protect girls, or frustration or perceived failure with\ngirls,\u201d suggesting that the killers considered \u201ctheir responses more\nunderstandable and perhaps even justified.\u201d The mass shooters George Sodini,\nGeorge Hennard, Marc L\u00e9pine, and Elliot Rodger all explicitly cited their\nrejection by, and hatred of, women as their casus belli; the Virginia Tech\nshooter Seung-hui Cho had been reported for stalking female students; the\nSandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza wrote an essay about \u201cwhy females are inherently\nselfish.\u201d The Columbine shooter Eric Harris had been turned down by a girl\nhe\u2019d asked to prom three days before the massacre; high schoolers Luke\nWoodham, Michael Carneal, Kip Kinkel, Andrew Wurst, Mitchell Johnson, and\nJaylen Fryberg also retaliated against rejections. Six-year-old Dedrick Owens\nshot a girl his own age after she rejected him for a kiss.\n\nHow does something as immaterial as rejection enlarge and solidify in the\nmind, until murder seems like a fair response? Perhaps because, while\nrejection itself can be light, the intensity of the feelings it evokes is not,\nfueled by the reject\u2019s limitless counterfactual imaginings. Since its outcomes\nare total, the intentions behind them feel equally total, so \u201cI don\u2019t like you\nin that way\u201d is heard as \u201cI despise you.\u201d When a rejection gets construed as\nan attack, the temptation is to fight back, accuse them of assuming the worst\nabout you, repay the insult, or demean the rejector to invalidate their\nrejection. You assume they have dismissed you out of active hatred, even\nthough rejections can happen out of fleeting mood, circumstance, indecision,\nbusyness, romantic orientation, or forgetfulness. Even when they do dislike\nyou, it\u2019s not always personal; as in cases of bigotry, it can stem from the\nrejector\u2019s shortcomings rather than your own. (Sometimes, though, the problem\nreally is you.)\n\nThe blankness of the rejection plot may be the crux. It feels absurd to be so\nundone by nothing; only by reconceiving your rejection as a top-tier\ncatastrophe, a special torment with life-or-death stakes, does the suffering\nfeel proportionate. So neglect becomes crucifixion, wound-licking is justice,\ndisrespect is death, and rejection by one is rejection by all. By causing real\nsuffering and death, the killer wants to assert the reality and intensity of\nthe pain it emerged from. And since rejection lacks its own narrative, it co-\nopts others\u2014not just their plot, but their style. To quote another famously\nheartsick homicidaire, you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose\nstyle\u2014and you can count on a mass killer for an overwrought one. The killers\u2019\nfantasies of revenge dwarf even their actual deeds. In his manifesto, Elliot\nRodger envisions \u201ca fair and pure world\u201d in which women are rounded up in\nconcentration camps and \u201cdeliberately starved to death.\u201d In his videos he\ndeclares that he will turn everyone into \u201cmountains of skulls and rivers of\nblood,\u201d just as Seung-hui Cho announces that he will cause \u201cmillions of deaths\nand millions of gallons of blood on the streets.\u201d\n\nIt used to be that the bogeyman of popular imagination was the serial killer,\nwhose archetype was often surprisingly charming or sociable: Ted Bundy, Paul\nKnowles (the \u201cCasanova Killer\u201d), John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer; or their\nfictional progeny, the compassionate Dexter Morgan, erudite Hannibal Lecter,\nsmoldering Paul Spector. With something like a diabolical humanism, this\narchetype kills for pleasure, relishing each one. These have been supplanted\nby the newer archetype of the mass shooter, or parallel killer\u2014an antisocial\nreject who wants to get it all out at once, acting out of imagined justice\nrather than pleasure. In their parallel worlds, all is permitted and possible,\nand the reject is god. Seung-hui Cho: \u201cI die, like Jesus Christ, to inspire\ngenerations of the Weak and Defenseless people.\u201d (Cho also told his roommate\nthat he had a girlfriend from outer space named Jelly.) Elliot Rodger: \u201cI\u2019ll\nbe a god, exacting my retribution on all those who deserve it.\u201d Describing\nhimself as \u201cone who always loved fantasy and magic, and who always wished that\nsuch things were real,\u201d Rodger was a fan of The Secret, a superstitious self-\nhelp book about getting things you want, like Pygmalion, simply by wanting\nthem hard enough.\n\nIn 2015, a bow-tie designer named Tyrell Shaw went on a daylong spree in\nManhattan, striking Asian women in the face with a blunt object in four\nseparate incidents, before hanging himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been rejected by Women my\nentire life,\u201d his blog begins. \u201cI never agreed with violence, but I knew the\nonly way I could overcome that sense of rejection-would start by assaulting\nthe women that carelessly rejected me.\u201d (But he had propositioned them just as\ncarelessly: elsewhere he claimed to have complimented a hundred Asian women in\none day, listing the exact time of each compliment.) \u201cI realized that I would\nhave to use violence in order get the response that I desire,\u201d he later\ncontinued. \u201cBy starting an independent civil war where I will hit over a\nmillion Asian Women in the face with a stick will change history.\u201d\n\nThe delusion of consequence, and of one\u2019s vengeance serving a higher purpose,\nspeaks to the malleability of the rejection plot: it feels very bad, so it\ncan\u2019t mean nothing, and since you want it to mean something, and it could mean\nanything, it\u2019s got to mean everything. Because the rejection plot has no\nclosure of its own, the thoughts and desires can only be discharged by forcing\nsomething to happen. And so a new script emerges for others to act out,\nachieving deadly closure. Shooters explicitly copying Elliot Rodger include\nChristopher Harper-Mercer, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, Alek Minassian, and Keshav\nBhide, who, a month after Rodger\u2019s massacre, declared on YouTube: \u201cI am the\nnext Elliot Rodger and guess what I\u2019ll do the right thing this time.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThere is one other surefire way to end a story that doesn\u2019t progress, and that\nis to stop reading it (or writing it). Those who feel patronized by hope, have\nhad enough of languishing, and don\u2019t err into vengeance, may contemplate\nopting out of love altogether. But when being loved is ubiquitously understood\nas the sine qua non of fulfillment, no one gives it up willingly. The problem\nis, we like love, we love to yearn, we cherish the hope and payoff of grand\nambitions realized, we want to want to want. A hero is not supposed to quit.\n\nThe parallel killer is a descendant of Dostoyevsky\u2019s Underground Man: an\noutcast narcissistically reveling in self-laceration and offense, rejected by\nsociety. We may pity him, but we can only root for him insofar as we relate to\nhis feelings.\n\nDo other scripts exist? Is there a plot in which the reject is somehow heroic,\nby dint of his rejection? We see some novels where the protagonists forebear\ntheir loneliness with admirable lightness, like Mildred Lathbury in Barbara\nPym\u2019s Excellent Women, who suffers the condescension of her married peers with\nself-deprecating charm\u2014though this is undercut by the fact that in later\nnovels, she winds up married.\n\nAnother novel begins with the same premises but arrives at different\nconclusions\u2014its protagonist is a lonely, isolated wretch awash in self-pity,\nliving a plotless life in which nothing ever happens:\n\n> Others have someone who is devoted to them. I\u2019ve never had someone who even\n> considered devoting themselves to me. That is for others: me, they just\n> treat decently.\n>\n> I recognize in myself the capacity to arouse respect but not affection.\n> Unfortunately I\u2019ve done nothing that in itself justifies that initial\n> respect and so no one has ever managed to fully respect me either.\n\nIn him we recognize the reject\u2019s self-loathing and resentment:\n\n> Other people of lesser intelligence are in fact much stronger than me. They\n> are better than I am at carving out their lives amongst other people, more\n> skilled at administering their intelligence. I have all the necessary\n> qualities to influence others but not the art with which to do so, nor even\n> the will to want to do so.\n\nHis preference for fiction over reality:\n\n> I feel closer ties and more intimate bonds with certain characters in books,\n> with certain images I\u2019ve seen in engravings, than with many supposedly real\n> people, with that metaphysical absurdity known as \u201cflesh and blood.\u201d\n\nFrustration with his stagnant, meaningless life:\n\n> I\u2019ve done nothing nor will I ever do anything useful to justify my\n> existence. The part of my life not wasted in thinking up confused\n> interpretations of nothing at all, has been spent making prose poems out of\n> the incommunicable feelings I use to make the unknown universe my own. Both\n> objectively and subjectively speaking, I\u2019m sick of myself. I\u2019m sick of\n> everything, and of everything about everything.\n>\n> Hope? What have I got to hope for? The only promise the day holds for me is\n> that it will just be another day with a fixed course to run and a\n> conclusion.\n\nLamenting about his Godless existence:\n\n> No Christ died for me. No Buddha showed me the right path. In the depths of\n> my dreams no Apollo or Athena appeared to me to enlighten my soul.\n\nFraming his desire as a matter of mortal consequence:\n\n> It\u2019s enough for me to want something for that thing to die. My destiny,\n> however, is not powerful enough to prove deadly to just anything. It has the\n> unfortunate disadvantage of being deadly to only those things I want.\n\nHe even calls his writings \u201cconfessions,\u201d as if being rejected is a state of\nsin or crime. This is Bernardo Soares, one of Fernando Pessoa\u2019s heteronyms, in\nhis posthumous and unedited novel The Book of Disquiet. Presented as diary\nentries, the faceless office drone Soares is capable of deep perception,\ngentleness, and self-knowledge, but is no less a reject, with all its\nhallmarks. He lives an airless life with a deep relationship to fantasy (\u201cIn\nmy case the two realities I attend to have equal weight\u201d), and he\u2019s prone to\ncosmically grandiose proclamations about himself, though with a self-effacing\ntwist: \u201cI am the nothing around which all this spins, I exist so that it can\nspin, I am the center that exists only because every circle has one ... I am\nthe center of everything surrounded by the great nothing.\u201d\n\nUnlike Miss Havisham, Mr. Collins, #OP, or Roderigo\u2014unlike Sodini, Cho, or\nRodger\u2014Soares not only radically accepts his condition but aestheticizes it.\nFor him the blankness of rejection is a canvas: \u201cBecause I am nothing, I can\nimagine myself to be anything. If I were somebody, I wouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201d\nWhile a bookkeeper could imagine himself as anyone, he argues, the King of\nEngland can\u2019t, because \u201chis reality limits what he can feel.\u201d Instead of\ntrying to bring his parallel life in line with his real one, he rejects both:\n\u201cI reject life because it is a prison sentence, I reject dreams as being a\nvulgar form of escape.\u201d His conviction is that the world\u2019s beauty and\nperfection are located in its very unattainability. His parallel world stays\nparallel, because if he were not rejected, if he got what he wanted,\nperfection wouldn\u2019t exist at all, and life would mean less: \u201cWe worship\nperfection because we can\u2019t have it; if we had it, we would reject it.\u201d\n\nWhat one might call heroic is Soares\u2019s success in finding a different\nperspective on the dogma of love. And not with the kind of delusional spite\nthat degrades love, but actually appreciates it:\n\n> It is not love itself but the outskirts of love that matter ... The\n> sublimation of love illuminates the phenomena of love much more clearly than\n> the actual experience of it. There are some very wise virgins in the world.\n> Action has its compensations but it confuses the matter. To possess is to be\n> possessed and therefore to lose oneself.\n\nThis idea that love can only be truly appreciated from the outside may feel\nlike sour grapes, like the purest cope, but where does that feeling come from?\nOf course everyone wants love; still, consider how often lovers say their\nbeloved completes them, and they can\u2019t live without them, and so on. If the\nprice of love is losing yourself in another, then accepting unrequital is a\nspecial kind of self-knowledge, one that does not pretend that acceptance\ncomes with any greater reward. Even if everyone would prefer the fulfillments\nof love, that doesn\u2019t negate the virtue of its absence. Whether you wanted\nthis virtue or not.\n\nTony Tulathimutte is the author of Private Citizens. Rejection is forthcoming\nin September 2024. He is the founder of CRIT, a writing class in Brooklyn.
