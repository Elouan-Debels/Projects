Though a minor skirmish in the theatre of\noperation of the Eastern Front, the Izbushensky charge had great propaganda\nresonance in Italy and it is still remembered as one of the last significant\ncavalry charges in history.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nOn 20 August, the Soviets launched an offensive on the Don river. The Italian\n2nd Infantry Division Sforzesca was unable to withstand the enemy attack and\nin two days it was routed.^[1] The Regiment \"Savoia Cavalleria\" (3rd) under\ncommand of Colonel Alessandro, Count Bettoni Cazzago, was sent as a relief\nforce in the area, with orders to occupy \"objective spot height 213,5\". During\nthe evening of 23 August, it set camp 1,000 meters short of its objective,\nready to occupy it the next morning. During the night, two battalions (first\nand second)^[2] of the Soviet 812th Rifle Regiment deployed on the objective.\nThey entrenched themselves in an arc facing the Italian camp about 1,000\nmeters wide, waiting until sunrise to attack.\n\n## Charge[edit]\n\nOn August 24 at 3:30 am, an Italian mounted patrol, sent to recon the\nobjective, made contact with the Soviets. The Soviets, having lost the element\nof surprise, opened fire on the entire line. With the camp under fire,\nAlessandro had no choice but to order, as a last resort, a cavalry charge with\ndrawn sabers and hand grenades against entrenched infantry. While the horse\ndrawn artillery (so called \"flying batteries\" or voloire in Piemontese)\nquickly deployed its four pieces and opened fire, the machine guns deployed at\nthe front of the Italian camp and started firing back. Alessandro Bettoni then\nordered the 2nd squadron (over 100 horsemen) to attack the Soviet left flank.\nUnder the command of Captain De Leone, the squadron began a winding maneuver\nthrough a gorge, succeeding in engaging the Soviets at the left end of the\nfront, outflanking it and storming it longitudinally with drawn sabers and\nhand grenades.\n\nCorporal Lolli, unable to draw, as his saber was stuck in its sheath, charged\nholding high a hand grenade; Trumpeter Carenzi, having to handle both trumpet\nand pistol, unintentionally shot his own horse in the head.^[3] Some horses,\neven though riddled by bullets, would keep galloping for hundreds of meters,\nsquirting blood at every beat, suddenly collapsing only a while after their\nactual death.^[4] After having crossed just about half of the Soviet line the\nstrength of the squadron was already reduced by half, and the commander\nhimself was grounded.\n\nRealizing that the 2nd squadron was taking heavy casualties, and perceiving\nthrough his binoculars that the Soviet riflemen, after the horsemen had jumped\nover their holes, would get up and shoot at their backs, Colonel Bettoni\nordered the 4th squadron to dismount and launch a frontal attack. This would\nallow the 2nd squadron to regroup behind Soviet lines and perform a return\ncharge. The 4th squadron was led by Captain Silvano Abba, who was killed while\nleading his men. He was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.\nOnce the 2nd squadron was back, its commander urged a new attack. This was\nperformed by 3rd squadron, led by the impatient Captain Marchio, who rushed\nfrontally at the Soviets without taking the detour through the gorge at the\nside of the battlefield. Major Alberto Litta Modignani decided on his own\naccord to join the 3rd squadron charge, together with the remaining dozen\nhorsemen of the command.\n\nAll action ceased by 9:30 am, six hours after the engagement had commenced.\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nAccording to Italian sources, 32 cavalrymen died, including the commanders of\nthe 3rd and 4th squadrons, 52 were wounded. Well over 100 horses were also\nlost. From the Soviet side, 304th Rifle Division battle report No. 2 from\nAugust 24th preliminary evaluates Italian losses for that day as up to 500\ndead.^[2] The Soviets, by Italian records, left behind 150 dead, 300 wounded,\n600 prisoners (including some Mongolian platoons equipped with Italian\nuniforms, which had been taken from the Sforzesca division), 4 cannons, 10\nmortars and 50 machine guns.^[5] From the Soviet perspective, 304th Rifle\nDivision operational report No. 70 from the early hours of August 25th tolls\nthe losses taken by the whole division for the previous day at 184 killed and\n82 wounded.^[6]\n\nShortly afterwards German liaison cavalry officers arrived. They were deployed\nat the left of the Savoia and they had witnessed everything from the\nneighbouring heights. They expressed their wonder and admiration for the\nanachronistic episode to Alessandro, saying: \"Colonel, these kinds of things,\nwe cannot do them anymore\".^[7]\n\nAfter removing the wounded and the dead, the battlefield remained covered with\ndead horses. The relatively high casualties that would have resulted from\npursuing the Soviet troops would have had the effect of precluding the\nlaunching of any more charges, should the need arise. Given this\nconsideration, Commander Bettoni decided not to pursue the Soviets, who\ntherefore retained a solid foothold on the west bank of the Don River.\nNonetheless, the \"Izbushensky Charge\", as it was subsequently named,\ntemporarily relieved the whole area of Soviet pressure, delayed the full\nSoviet attack on Tschebotarewskij by 24 hours, and likely bought time for the\nrouted \"Sforzesca\" division to seek safety.^[5] By the 27th of August,\nhowever, the 304th Rifle Division was on the offensive once again.^[8]\n\nThe bold action of the Italian troops was repaid by adding the Gold Medal of\nMilitary Valor to the regiment standard and by awarding the medal to Captain\nSilvano Abba and Major Alberto Litta Modignani, both of whom had died in\naction. Another 54 Silver Medals of Military Valor and 49 war crosses were\nalso awarded.^[9]\n\nA much-loved and much-honoured survivor of the Izbushensky charge was Albino,\na horse which, though blinded in the battle, lived until 1960.^[5]\n\n## Media representations[edit]\n\nIn September 1942 the \"Istituto Luce\" dispatched a film crew in order to take\nstaged footage of the Savoia in action. The only original pictures were shot\nby Cpt. Abb\u00e0 right before starting the attack with the 4th squadron. His\ncamera was found on his body and was returned to his mother by 2nd ltn.\nCompagnoni. They show, from far away, the dust of the 2nd squadron about to\nend the first swipe.^[5]\n\nIn 1952 the movie \"Carica Eroica\" was made, directed by Francesco De Robertis\nand based on the Izbushensky Charge.\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Roberto Biagioni \"Isbushenskij: la carica della gloria\"\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0430 304 \u0441\u0434\" (in Russian). \u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 1941-1945.
