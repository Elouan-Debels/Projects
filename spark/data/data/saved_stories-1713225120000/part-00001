To work around this, simply rename the bookmark adding back\nthe amount of blank space you'd like.\n\n### How do I change the size of the blank space bookmark?\n\nRename the bookmark \u2014 adding more spaces will make the bookmark longer.\n\n### Why does there need to be a transparent icon?\n\nIf there is no icon the browser will create a default icon \u2014 so creating a\nblank bookmark requires a blank icon.\n\nIn this case the icon is a transparent 32px by 32px png embedded in a .ico\nfile.\n\nThis is to make the icon compatible with pretty much every browser and as\nsmall as possible \u2014 105 bytes.\n\nTags\n\n    \n\n  * focus\n  * working on computers\n  * white space\n  * removing friction\n  * cognitive ease\n  * free\n\nPublished\n\n    18 Apr 2024\nUpdated\n\n    18 Apr 2024\n\nFound this useful?
