What car\nculture is really about is death.\n\nToday, cars are better than they have ever been\u2014and, not unrelatedly, more\nsimilar to one another\n\n1995 Ford Contour.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Cars\n  * Money and Power\n  * War\n\n#### Share and Save\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instapaper\n\n### Email Newsletter\n\nGet n+1 in your inbox.\n\nThe Buick display at this year\u2019s New York International Auto Show was located\nin the far back corner of the Jacob Javits Center\u2019s third-floor main exhibit\nhall, the kind of dim and lonely zone where you would expect to stumble upon\nunused sound equipment from the 2016 Hillary Clinton victory party. What I saw\ninstead was a solitary, sickly orange Buick Envista, a crossover SUV\npresumably named to match its sisters Encore, Envision, and Enclave. One\nproblem with this is that Encore, Envision, and Enclave are real words.\n\nAn auto show, like any trade show, is an assertion of hierarchy, and it was\nobvious from the press days I attended late last month that Buick\u2014once a\nglorious American enterprise, more recently a middling brand with a Tiger\nWoods endorsement deal\u2014is at the bottom. Like visitors to a car dealership\nsubjected to none of the sales pressure, auto show attendees can take all the\ntime they want examining, entering, photographing, filming, touching, and\nslamming the doors of the contemporary American automobile. I sat down inside\nthe Envista and considered the market potential of a cheap-feeling crossover\nwith the rear-seat headroom of a coupe, which struck me as limited. Walking\naround the Javits I got the sense that after a decade of unquestioned SUV\ndominance we are now in the early days of decrossoverification: small and\nsmall-adjacent SUVs seem to be getting lower, more compact, and more sedanlike\nthan their recent antecedents. Unlike the Envista, however, most of them\nmanage this transition without forcing rear-seat occupants to lean forward\nlike they\u2019re in a hospital waiting room waiting to be told the bad news.\nBuick\u2019s old-school crappy display featured piles of branded cowboy hats and\nnothing at all in the way of persuasion. \u201cIs this the company\u2019s first compact\ncrossover?\u201d I found myself asking Buick\u2019s lone and passive sales rep. That was\na real low point for me.\n\nEveryone has a first convention center and Atlanta\u2019s Georgia World Congress\nCenter is mine. I attended my first auto show there in 1992 or 1993, and back\nthen I would have seen every major brand and model on the market. This hasn\u2019t\nbeen the case at the Javits for some time. Besides an outdoor Jeep test track,\nat NYIAS there was no presence from Stellantis\u2014no Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Fiat,\nAlfa Romeo, or Maserati. There were no German manufacturers around other than\nVolkswagen and a handful of Porsches\u2014unimaginable even a few years ago. GM\ndidn\u2019t bother bringing Cadillac, its most interesting brand, and Ford showed\nup without Lincoln, which in 2016 had a huge stand featuring its brand-new\nNavigator concept and its then ambassador, Matthew McConaughey. Mazda didn\u2019t\nshow up, which was too bad, and neither did Mitsubishi, which was\nunsurprising. The last time I saw them there, I think in 2017, their display\nwas desultory and Buick-like.\n\nMy sentient life has roughly coincided with an era of unprecedentedly high\nautomotive quality. In the 1990s, during my early auto show\u2013going days, the\nxenophobic Reagan-era freakout about Japanese imports was giving way to a\nnear-universal great leap forward. American cars were getting better, as were\nGerman cars and Korean cars, while the Japanese econoboxes had attained an\nexalted realm that seemed to surpass mere questions of reliability. Today,\ncars are better than they have ever been\u2014and, not unrelatedly, more similar to\none another. There are fewer major car companies, more shared parts and\nplatforms, a stronger regulatory environment, and far less overall\neccentricity. I don\u2019t think any of this is bad per se, but I wonder if the\noft-noted decline of auto enthusiasm isn\u2019t in large part a consequence of our\nhigh-quality epoch. It seems to me that there is an essential relationship\nbetween idiosyncrasy and fandom, that the latter can\u2019t function without the\nformer. Fans of midcentury English cars bonded over their MGs\u2019 and TVRs\u2019\nghastly wiring problems and frequent breakdowns, and turn-of-the-millennium\nSaturn nerds had whatever it was they had at their annual gatherings in Spring\nHill, Tennessee.\n\nThe only contemporary brand that encourages this kind of collective intensity\nis, of course, Tesla. Tesla famously and not unreasonably hates car dealers,\nso there\u2019s no way they would ever appear at an event organized by the Greater\nNew York Automobile Dealers Association (GNYADA). It was wonderful not to have\nto actively think about Tesla, one of the most important car companies in the\nworld, and also one of the hardest to theorize without hype or prejudice. But\nclearly other people were thinking about it a lot. At a press conference\nintroducing the Prologue, the Honda representative emphasized the model\u2019s\nretractable panoramic sunroof, throwing shade (and shade) at Tesla\u2019s\nunyielding, overheating-prone glass version of the same. The sunroof, the guy\nsaid, was \u201cone of my favorite things about Prologue,\u201d along with its low\nroofline (more evidence of decrossoverification) and the fact that it has the\nbiggest wheels and tires in Honda history. At both the Honda event and the\nAcura press conference I attended beforehand the presenters got very energized\nby their cars\u2019 logos. The logos haven\u2019t been redesigned or anything\u2014there they\nwere in the middle of the grilles, like always.\n\nAcura is Honda\u2019s luxury vehicle division, a category I\u2019ve always been\nsuspicious of. What\u2019s the point of paying a huge premium for a rebadged Toyota\nCamry with leather seats and wood paneling? Without BMW, Mercedes, and\nStellantis\u2019s numerous brands, the Japanese luxury divisions had way too much\nspace and not enough to fill it with. My main impression of their display\nareas was that there was a lot of carpeting, which didn\u2019t do much to soften\nthe Javits\u2019s blunt-force concrete hostility. Infiniti, the upmarket Nissan,\nwas a little more impressive than Acura or Lexus, giving over the entirety of\nits floor space to a semi-interactive experience dedicated to its new QX80, a\nbeastly full-size SUV with air curtains larger than my head. The Infiniti\nstand featured swelling electronic strings, blue-green lava lamp illumination,\nelusive hors d\u2019oeuvres, and a weird interactive audio component showcasing the\nInfiniti\u2019s Klipsch Reference Premiere Audio System\u2014all of which seemed like\nthe appropriate amount of effort needed to sell an SUV that costs $30,000 more\nthan the nearly identical Nissan Armada.\n\nOf course there\u2019s no inherent relationship between display quality and market\nshare. Tesla is no less powerful for failing to show up, and even Matthew\nMcConaughey wouldn\u2019t have helped Buick make its case. But if some of the heavy\nhitters asserted their presence via absence, a few brands did so via emphatic\npresence. Toyota had wheelchair basketball and a bouncy castle meant to evoke\na swimming pool, in honor of the company\u2019s Paralympic and Olympic\npartnerships. The row of sneakers at the Nissan stand were there to promote\nthe Kicks compact crossover, a car named after shoes and possibly also\ndesigned to resemble them.\n\nI\u2019m not immune to good marketing, and the cup of citrusy beet tea poured from\na stone teapot at the Genesis booth was good marketing. Genesis is a luxury\nbrand like Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus, but it presents itself with swagger and\nindividuation, distinct from both its parent company (Hyundai) and its\nJapanese and German competitors. The Genesis booth, by far the most elegant at\nthe Javits, had the radiant, unfussy vibe of a French regional bank\nheadquarters from the tail end of the trentes glorieuses. Genesis\u2019s cars are\nlike its beet tea: subtle, refined, ennobling. It used to bother me that the\ncompany\u2019s grilles and logos so shamelessly evoked latter-day Bentley models,\nbut then at last year\u2019s auto show I sat down in the back seat of a G70, closed\nthe door behind me, heard the most perfect thunk I\u2019ve ever heard, and realized\nthat in every respect these cars are superior to Bentleys\u2014at a quarter of the\nprice. I will never be in the financial position to purchase a luxury car or a\nnew car, but Genesis is the only brand that makes some minor degree of free-\nfloating longing feel non-humiliating.\n\nThree Genesis cars (Geneses?) on display had the same vivid orange color as\nthe tea. I forget which ones were to the left and right of the X Gran\nBerlinetta concept because no other car at the show so dominated the visual\nfield. With its impossible wheels, huge haunches, and narrow cockpit it\nresembled nothing so much as a racecar that has undergone a BBL. Once I got\nover the pornographic shock of the thing my mind drifted, auto-biographically,\nto the car racing games in the Need for Speed series, which featured cars like\nthe Berlinetta traveling through pleasant, nighttime European landscapes. In\nthese games driving was easy and frictionless\u2014supercars could travel through\nmoonlit German villages at 300 km/h, bounce off the town square\u2019s guardrails,\nand keep on cruising. Today the only people who get to drive frictionlessly\nare billionaire failsons who pilot their Koenigseggs and Paganis through LA\nand New York at 140 mph. I usually learn about their efforts in graphic news\nfootage of their million-dollar cars crushed against lampposts and\nstorefronts, with pedestrians as collateral damage.\n\nThe US\u2019s bestselling automotive brands are Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet. The\nbestselling models in 2023 were the Ford F-Series, the Chevy Silverado, the\nRam Pickup, the Toyota RAV4, and the Tesla Model Y. The VIPs of the New York\nInternational Auto Show, however, were the Koreans. While Genesis held it down\nfor the Korean luxury sector, Kia did its best as Hyundai\u2019s somewhat lesser\nquasi-subsidiary. Introducing its heroically ugly K4, the Kia representative\ndevoted most of his press conference time to the model\u2019s various technological\ninnovations, including its generative AI capability, which allows drivers to\nhear about their \u201cstocks, sports scores, and owners\u2019 manual content.\u201d Over and\nover again at the show I heard about the width of various digital instrumental\npanels, possibly the saddest example of dick-measuring I\u2019ve encountered in an\nindustry permanently committed to the practice. (The K4\u2019s screen is thirty\ninches wide, if Big Display Energy is the sort of thing that gets you going.)\n\nFor all this self-debasement, Kia\u2019s fleet is solid and capable. Anytime I rent\na car I\u2019m disappointed if it\u2019s not a Kia. But the star of the show was the\nparent company. Hyundai\u2019s press conference was the slickest, its product the\nmost appealing. At last year\u2019s show I fell in love with the Ioniq 5, a modern\nelectric car free from Tesla\u2019s obnoxious influence. I suspect that even Tesla\nsuperfans have a hard time generating enthusiasm for the company\u2019s current\nproduct line\u2014too ubiquitous, too outdated, too vulgar. The Ioniq 5, by\ncontrast, is designed to thrill. Its exterior has a crisply modular quality,\nas if one could disassemble it and replace the batteries, but it doesn\u2019t look\ncheap\u2014just user-friendly, a little like a 1980s vacuum cleaner. Its orderly\ngrid of taillights is a creative design detail I haven\u2019t seen anywhere else.\nLike the car as a whole the grid\u2019s futurism is present-tense, a soothing\ncontrast to both the industry\u2019s retro doom loop and the hegemony of aggressive\nblack fascias and interchangeable rooflines. On the Hyundai test track inside\nthe Javits, the charismatic driver treated me to a few laps in the Ioniq 5 N,\nwhich can do zero to sixty in a little over three seconds. The acceleration\nwas startling, effortless, and genuinely fun. I never thought I could enjoy\nsimulated engine sounds, which have always struck me as a terminal gimmick,\nbut the Ioniq 5 N made even this seem playful\u2014the opposite of Tesla\u2019s strained\nand effortful innovations. Musk famously endowed his cars with a feature that\nproduces fart sounds, an inanity that came to mind as I was looking around a\nbooth that sold faux vanity license plates. I was thinking of getting my\ndaughter a plate with her name on it\u2014maybe New Mexico, with its perfect\nlivery\u2014until I saw, in close succession, an Indiana plate that read BIG TITS\nand a Georgia plate that read BUST A NUT. Nope! The entire Tesla project feels\nlike a collection of advanced if often undertested technologies with the ethos\nof these license plates.\n\nThe salespersonship at the Hyundai press conference was impressive.\nIntroducing two lesser new models, the CEO of the company\u2019s American division\nannounced Hyundai\u2019s \u201call-new human-centric technology\u201d: the \u201creturn of some of\nthose knobs and dials\u201d that nearly every brand\u2014other than noble anti-\nflatscreen holdout Mazda\u2014has renounced over the past few years. But these\nsurface-level tweaks weren\u2019t the big story. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting customers where\nthey are on the journey to electrification,\u201d Parker said with great pride. If\nin recent years electric cars had appealed to a smallish number of early\nadopters, Hyundai is now working toward \u201cwhat we call the early majority,\u201d a\nbrilliant piece of branding that feels like something Democratic consultants\nget paid millions of dollars to (fail to) come up with.\n\nI was 11 when GM introduced the EV1, the subject of the documentary Who Killed\nthe Electric Car?, and the experience of seeing the first real generation of\nelectric cars fail to take flight\u2014thanks to corporate conspiracy, consumer\ndisinterest, or both\u2014was radicalizing. Now, nearly three decades later, a\ngroup of executives from the most ambitious car company in the world were\ndiscussing electrification with a disorienting sense of inevitability. The\nHyundai crew didn\u2019t have much to say about climate change, but then again, why\nwould they? Auto manufacturers are no more likely to \u201csolve\u201d climate change\nthan oil companies or hedge funds. I admire Hyundai\u2019s earnest commitment to\nelectrification and find its belatedness inescapably tragic.\n\nLike the Hyundai CEO, Polestar\u2019s Thomas Ingenlath\u2014a kind of Germanic Tom\nCruise\u2014was unreservedly excited about the electric future. While the other\nmanufacturers suppress the political-environmental implications of their\nelectric vehicles, Polestar\u2014a Swedish company owned by Volvo\u2014labels its seats\nwith sans-serif details about the carbon footprint of its fabrics and the\nassertion that \u201canimal welfare [has been] secured.\u201d This is smug, probably\neffective, and made me feel like I was sitting inside a bottle of Aesop hand\nlotion.\n\n\u201cDid it come from the stars?\u201d someone asked in the Polestar promotional video\nthat played before the unveiling of the Polestar 4. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it has\none on it.\u201d OK. I have to say that I was pretty seduced by Polestar\u2019s\nvision\u2014its beautiful, low-slung 3; its hot CEO; its Scandinavian\nminimalism\u2014until I started talking to a hedge fund guy also hanging around the\nbooth. He had rented a Polestar 2 recently and found it extremely\nuncomfortable to get in and out of. He had a pretty bearish view of the state\nof the electric market (unrelated to his rental experience), though he was\nbullish on Hyundai. At the moment the problem with electric cars, he said, is\nthat not enough people are buying them. EV credits have receded but the price\npremium hasn\u2019t, the US regulatory cudgel is weak, and gas is cheap. What will\nmove the needle? I asked. Another war, the hedge fund guy responded, hedge\nfund guyishly.^1\n\nIngenlath, for his part, devoted most of his time to the Polestar 4\u2019s lack of\na \u201ctraditional rear window,\u201d which has been replaced by a camera linked to the\nrearview mirror (now no longer a mirror, but a screen). Over the past few\nyears of upheaval in the car design space I\u2019ve gotten used to the elimination\nof the grille, the dashboard, and other automotive features I once thought\nwere as essential as wheels or doors. But seeing a sea of white recycled steel\nwhere a rear windshield should be felt like a new frontier. After the Polestar\npresentation I walked over to the Volkswagen stand and discovered that the\nfake-mirror epidemic was more widespread than I\u2019d thought. Sitting in the\ndriver\u2019s seat of the ID. Buzz microbus I looked at both side mirrors and saw a\nbright blue LED pattern, clearly staged for the auto show. You could make\nanything appear on these things! It took me a few too many seconds for me to\ngrasp that what I was looking at was the booth\u2019s LED backdrop, reflected in\nmirrors that were still blessedly real. For now.\n\nOn the morning of the second press day I went down to the basement level to\nattend the World Traffic Safety Symposium, organized by GNYADA. On the show\nfloor the industry people, finance guys, and vloggers\u2014so many vloggers\u2014were\nrecovering from the party circuit, but down here I was in the realm of the\nperennial bureaucrats. Most of the bureaucrats were very tall. I shared a\ntable with the tallest person in the room\u2014a poised, captivating man who had\nthe air of a benign Robert Moses. This turned out to be New York State DMV\nhead Mark Schroeder, a celebrity sighting that far exceeded my brief encounter\nwith McConaughey years earlier. During his remarks Schroder praised Kathy\nHochul as not only New York\u2019s first woman governor, but \u201cthe only governor in\nNew York State history who has run a DMV.\u201d He told a good David Paterson joke\nand said the words \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d without embarrassment,\nwith none of the hesitation the CEOs upstairs displayed when tiptoeing around\nthe subject of climate change.\n\nJennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board,\ndelivered the keynote via Zoom from Baltimore, where she was negotiating the\naftermath of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, a topic that everyone at\nthe show seemed to be speaking about in muted whispers. Homendy\u2019s speech was\nupsetting and frustrating. \u201cIn just these next fifteen minutes,\u201d she said,\n\u201cone person will die on our nation\u2019s roads,\u201d at which point she launched into\na horrific discussion of two recent car crashes the NTSB had investigated,\nboth of which, the agency concluded, could have been prevented with existing\ntechnology. In Las Vegas, a driver doing 103 in a 35 zone slammed his Dodge\nChallenger into a Toyota Sienna minivan. In the Sienna was a family with four\nchildren, the youngest of whom was 5 years old. Everyone in both cars was\nkilled. In Avenel, California, a drunk driver in a Dodge Journey SUV going 98\nin a 55 zone collided with a Ford F-150 carrying eight people, seven of whom\nwere kids between the ages of 6 and 15, all of whom died along with the\ndriver. Homendy\u2019s repeated invocations of these events via their place\nnames\u2014Las Vegas, Avenel\u2014reminded me of the shorthand we use when talking about\nschool shootings. I misheard \u201chard-braking events\u201d as \u201cheartbreaking events\u201d\nand don\u2019t think I was wrong to do so.\n\nHomendy\u2019s point was that \u201ccrashes can be prevented by life-saving tech in\nvehicles\u201d that already exists\u2014intelligent speed assistance, passive alcohol\ndetection technology, and so on. Fair enough. But there was a passivity to her\nremarks, a sense that in the end, all this unspeakable cruelty was up to the\ncar companies to resolve. I was pleased to hear her bring up the weight of\nelectric vehicles\u2014a serious concern\u2014and then troubled to realize that this\nfact was cited not in defense of pedestrians and bikers, but of the roads\nthemselves.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s true that heavy vehicles are wearing down roads more quickly\nthan anticipated, but with Las Vegas and Avenel on my mind this didn\u2019t seem\nlike the central problem American government officials needed to contend with.\nEvery morning I walk my daughter to school through two intersections so poorly\ndesigned that we have to go to elaborate lengths to avoid the nearly 100\npercent of drivers who illegally plow through a few flimsy bollards and always\nfail to stop at the crosswalk. I\u2019m glad that New York\u2019s intelligent speed\nassistance program seems to be having a positive effect, just as I\u2019m glad\nabout congestion pricing. But the scale of the safety crisis is vast,\nradically out of proportion to all the cheerful innovating taking place\nupstairs.\n\nThe US\u2019s biggest infrastructure project\u2014bigger than the New Deal\u2013era dams and\nthe Erie Canal\u2014was the highway system, which destroyed the American city and,\narguably but I think not that arguably, American society itself. The country\u2019s\nmidcentury racist spatial self-destruction is a crime that will never be\nsufficiently atoned for. Whenever a child walking along a four-lane exurban\nroad is killed by a driver who swerves into the shoulder, whenever someone is\nsimply able to drive 98 miles per hour in a 55 zone, whenever a family of\nseven in an ostensibly safe minivan is killed despite the self-evident\ntechnological ability to limit speeds, redesign roads, and enforce existing\nregulations, it seems reasonable to infer that what car culture is really\nabout aren\u2019t sexy concept cars or futuristic taillights. What car culture is\nreally about is death.\n\n\u201cActually SO FUCKED that luxury victims have safety options lower trim lines\ndon\u2019t,\u201d I wrote in my notepad during Homendy\u2019s keynote. I meant \u201cvehicles,\u201d\nnot \u201cvictims,\u201d but the point stands. It\u2019s obvious that American life is a\nseries of cruel disparities, but the idea that automatic emergency braking and\nforward collision warning are options only available to a privileged few,\ndespite the absence of any technical constraints to universal adoption, still\nfeels, well, fucked. We are in desperate need of much more stringent safety\nregulations and we seem unlikely to get them.\n\nDuring the Hyundai press conference discussion of Hyundai Pay, a technology\nthat places the brand \u201cat the nexus of the auto industry, the payments\nindustry, and the EV charging industry,\u201d I had the thought that the interior\nof a new car is the only place where one can experience the total tech dream\nas it\u2019s been conceived of by its proselytizers. While driving you can turn\nyour Klipsch Reference Premiere Audio System all the way up, suppress the\noutside world, and attain pure, blissful dissociation\u2014unless a bridge\ncollapses under you, or (much more likely) you get distracted by a text and\ncrash your car into the side of a minivan.\n\n\u201cIt drives so much smaller than it really is,\u201d I overheard an Infiniti QX80\nsalesperson tell a couple of potential customers. Immediately this stood out\nto me as one of the truest and most ambiguous claims anyone could make about\nlife in the 21st century. Electrification is a real if unstable trend, and\ndecrossoverification is probably not nothing, but the story that matters above\nall others is that cars continue to get bigger, even as that size is mitigated\nby all kinds of refinements. For a recent trip I needed to rent a car with six\nseats and was upgraded by Thrifty to an eight-seat Chevy Tahoe, which also\ndrove much smaller than it really is. At nearly six thousand pounds, the thing\nwas smooth and nimble: easy to accelerate, easy to steer through the Taconic\nState Parkway\u2019s precarious curves, and easy to forget the smaller and more\nvulnerable cars\u2014and their passengers\u2014in the other lanes. I don\u2019t think that\nany of this constitutes progress. Size inflation has been normalized to such\nan extent that it\u2019s almost impossible to appreciate the enormity of American\ncars. The desire for status, the desire for height, a fragile and increasingly\nattenuated relationship to masculinity, the global war on terror, the rise of\nsafety-consciousness, a legal regime that has made the production of fuel-\ninefficient vehicles far more appealing to car manufacturers than smaller and\nmore eco-conscious ones\u2014all these have been held responsible for the rise of\nthe SUV and all these are indeed responsible. But the desire to wall oneself\noff from the world, to float above degraded infrastructure and the threat of\nviolence even as one contributes to both: this is an explanatory factor that\nshouldn\u2019t be underrated.\n\nAs Kate Aronoff has written in the New Republic, emissions standards are\nimproving (too slowly) but don\u2019t come close to adequately addressing the\nproblem the EPA itself helped create: a two-tiered system by which SUVs and\nlarge trucks can keep on trucking with embarrassing gas mileage. Automakers\nwho lobbied for this legal regime in the first place have responded\nrationally, by making more SUVs and large trucks and fewer regular cars. At\nthe Ford stand I took note of a limited-edition Sydney Sweeney\u2013branded robin\u2019s\negg blue Mustang, with Sweeney\u2019s \u201cheart bolt emblem\u201d emblazoned all over the\ncar\u2019s interior and exterior. (Her signature is on the engine.) This struck me\nas a world-historically smart collaboration (notwithstanding the creepy online\nfreaks obsessed with Sweeney\u2019s breasts as an arbiter of Western civilization\u2019s\nrevival or whatever), but also a sideshow, given that the Mustang is the only\nremaining passenger car in Ford\u2019s lineup.^2\n\nI understand that life goes on in the imperium as people die in a genocide\nsupported and underwritten by the US. I\u2019ve been to movies over the past six\nmonths, have attended and even hosted children\u2019s birthday parties. And still\nthe experience of spending two days inside a convention center reflecting on\nan industry that has done so much to destroy and destabilize this country and\nour planet and millions of its inhabitants filled me with disgust and despair.\nDownstairs on the first day, I saw a customized Toyota Land Cruiser with a\nrear windshield sticker that read SORRY FOR MY SCRATCHES AND DENTS, THESE ARE\nACTUAL WAR WOUNDS. The Land Cruiser was, of course, spotless.\n\nIt felt right to spend my final minutes at the show with the Hummer. My family\nhad just immigrated to the US when the Hummer went on sale to the general\npublic in the wake of the company\u2019s PR triumph during the Gulf War, and by the\ntime the brand was sold to GM and started to conquer the hearts and minds of\nAmerican suburbanites in 1999 I was a little more attuned to the market. The\ngigantic Ford Excursion was launched around the same time, and it was\nimpossible to ignore the public\u2019s lust for size. Positioned not far from the\nBuick Envista in GM\u2019s Siberian sector of the Javits, the GMC Hummer EV looked\nand felt massive. Inside, every drawer, compartment, and air vent seemed to be\nat least three times the size of what was normal and necessary, but then that\ngoes for the Hummer itself. The truck\u2019s most notable feature is a black-on-\nblack American flag embossed at the top of its C-pillar.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Force has purchased over two thousand Hummers from the US\nover the past decade, and three of four military utility vehicles manufactured\nin Israel are based on American trucks. (The fourth, the MDT David, is based\non platforms from the Land Rover Defender and the Land Cruiser.) Sitting\ninside the EV, with its outrageous scale and terrible sight lines, I had the\nthought that the last (and sometimes first) US-produced object many victims of\nwars throughout the world see is probably a Hummer.\n\n  1. Considering the contrast between the hedge fund guy\u2019s analysis and the Hyundai crew\u2019s unstoppable train\u2013like account of technological transition (the train in this account is electric), I recalled how at the Trump-era auto shows I attended, it was automation that had been treated as a fait accompli. That vision always felt impossibly overstated\u2014a product as much of a self-fulfilling tech hype cycle than any sober assessment of technological or infrastructural possibility\u2014so I wasn\u2019t surprised that this time around there was very little rhetoric about our triumphant autonomous future. But I did wonder about the ratio of progress report to snake oil I\u2019d hear about at, say, the 2034 New York International Auto Show. \u21a9\n\n  2. Particularly ironic for a brand whose Taurus sedan explicitly launched the American quality revival in the late \u201980s. The commercial is an all-time banger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n12lyKTAa50&ab_channel=MrClassicAds1980s. \u21a9\n\nIf you like this article, please subscribe or leave a tax-deductible tip below\nto support n+1.\n\n$\n\nUSD\n\nPlease enter an amount between $1-$100,000.\n\n### Related Articles\n\ncard-default flavor-tag type-magazine term-issue-9 format-pullquote tax-issue\nfeatured-\n\nOf all classic capitalist problems mass unemployment has probably been the one\nto trouble living Americans least.\n\nIssue 9 Bad Money\n\n  * Full Employment\n  * Benjamin Kunkel\n\ncard-default flavor-tag type-online-only term-podcast format-no_image tax-\nonline-only featured-\n\nPodcast\n\n  * Episode 26: Uncanny Valley\n  * Aaron Braun, Malcolm Donaldson, Emily Lyver, Eric Wen\n\ncard-default flavor-tag type-online-only term-online-only format-with_image\ntax-online-only featured-\n\nOnline Only\n\n  * The Situation of Unfreedom\n  * Konstantin Olmezov\n\ncard-default flavor-tag type-magazine term-issue-21 format-with_image tax-\nissue featured-\n\nIssue 21 Throwback\n\n  * Destiny, USA\n  * Steve Featherstone\n\n### More by this Author\n\ncard-default flavor-author type-online-only term-online-only format-no_image\ntax-online-only featured-\n\nOnline Only\n\n  * On Anthony Veasna So\n  * Brit Bennett, Peter Blackstock, Ariel Chu, Jonathan Dee, Mark Doten, Jane Hu, Claire Jarvis, Mark Krotov, Christopher James Llego, Rachel Ossip, Zeynep \u00d6zakat, Allison Pitinii Davis, Angela Qian, Dana Spiotta, Shelley Wong, Su Wu\n\ncard-default flavor-author type-online-only term-film-review format-with_image\ntax-online-only featured-\n\nFilm Review\n\n  * I Might Get the Hazelnut\n  * Mark Krotov\n\ncard-default flavor-author type-magazine term-issue-26 format-pullquote tax-\nissue featured-\n\nIn 2016, Twitter, like money, was speech.\n\nIssue 26 Dirty Work\n\n  * #worstelectionever\n  * Mark Krotov\n\ncard-default flavor-author type-online-only term-online-only format-no_image\ntax-online-only featured-\n\nOnline Only\n\n  * Until They Inevitably Find and Kill Each Other\n  * Greg Afinogenov, Gillian Brassil, Cosme Del Rosario-Bell, Jonah Furman, Emma Janaskie, Mark Krotov, Chris Looft, Nausicaa Renner, Tony Tulathimutte, Gabriel Winslow-Yost\n\nn+1\n\nn+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics\npublished three times a year.
