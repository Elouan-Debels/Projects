It's not comprehensive, but it's\nstill a fascinating look at the myths that made America, highlighting real\npeople who reached folkloric status as well as those who were invented in\nstories and song.\n\nYou can hover to zoom or see a larger version of the map here. Every region's\nfolk heroes are identified below. Your state probably has a hero \u2014 and it may\nbe one you didn't know about already.\n\n(William Gropper)\n\n### The Northeast\n\nWilliam Gropper's American Folklore Map.

Some claim his apples were used for hard cider.\n\nTony Beaver (West Virginia): A woodsman from Eel River, he is occasionally\ncalled a cousin of Paul Bunyan and is known for his passion for griddle\nskating.

He enjoyed practical jokes, shooting cups of whiskey off his\nfriends' heads, and being strong.\n\nDaniel Boone (Kentucky): Most closely associated with Kentucky, Boone was an\nexplorer who also served in the Virginia General Assembly. Like Davy Crockett\nlater on, Boone's legendary exploits overshadowed his real ones.\n\nThe Sissy From the Hardscrabble County Rock Quarries (Indiana): This tale has\na simple moral: compared with the tough men who work the quarries, a man who\nrides panthers and uses a rattlesnake as a whip is a wimp.\n\n### The Southeast\n\nWilliam Gropper's American Folklore Map.

The disappearance of its colonists remains a\nmystery.\n\nOld Black Joe (South Carolina): Stephen Foster wrote a song about the slave\nOld Black Joe.

He was both a smuggler and\na pirate.\n\nCasey Jones (Tennessee/Mississippi): This real engineer from Tennessee\nfamously guided the Cannonball Express, which collided with a freight train in\nVaughan, Mississippi.

The two became fast friends.\n\n### The Midwest\n\nWilliam Gropper's American Folklore Map. (Library of Congress)\n\nLittle Brown Bulls (Wisconsin): This traditional song of Wisconsin lumberjacks\ndetails logging along the river. The central story is a contest between some\n\"big spotted steers\" and \"little brown bulls\" to see which could haul the most\nwood.\n\nHiawatha (Undefined): The prehistoric Native American leader is usually placed\nsomewhere in New York, though this map puts him in the Midwest. He's a famous\nsymbol for his leadership of the Iroquois confederacy.\n\nPaul Bunyan Festivals (Minnesota): The legendary lumberjack has a home\nthroughout the Midwest, but Minnesota might have the strongest claim on him\nand his trusty friend, Babe the Blue Ox. Bunyan first appeared in print in a\n1916 promotional pamphlet for the Red River Lumber Company.\n\nThe Three Ravens (the Midwest): This version of an English ballad tells the\nstory of three ravens who saw a slain knight. (In the Midwestern United\nStates, the knight is occasionally replaced with a horse.)\n\nThe Old Gray Mare (the Midwest): This folk song tells the story of an aging\nmare or mule. Some sources place the song in New Jersey, others credit Stephen\nFoster, and still others say it comes from a campaign song.\n\nDeadwood Dick (South Dakota): Popularized in dime novels by Edward Lytton\nWheeler, the character became a symbol of the infamous cowboy town of\nDeadwood, and many real cowboys used the name. He's also a pseudonym for\nAfrican-American cowboy Nat Love.\n\nCalamity Jane (South Dakota): Frontierswoman and fighter Martha Jane Canary\nbecame a folk hero for her strong personality.\n\nFebold Feboldson (Nebraska): The Swedish plainsman and cloudbuster was also a\nfarmer and frontiersman who pioneered in the Old West.\n\nGeneral Custer (Montana): The Civil War general hailed from Ohio and was\nkilled at Little Bighorn, Montana. \"Custer's Last Stand\" remains an infamous\nbattle in American history.\n\nThe Pacing White Mustang (The West): Emblematic of the American West as a\nwhole, the pacing white mustang represents the wandering of the West.\nDescribed by Washington Irving in 1832, the mustang first appeared in Oklahoma\nas a near apparition with a wandering soul, too fast to be caught.\n\nBuffalo Bill (Kansas): An infamous figure in the Wild West, Buffalo Bill rode\nin the Pony Express, fought in the Civil War, and explored the frontier. He\nbegan touring in 1883, in a show that burnished his legend as a cowboy.\n\nGit Along Little Dogies (Midwest and West): A traditional cowboy ballad, the\nsong refers to motherless calves and the cowboy's call while herding them.\n\n### The Southwest\n\nWilliam Gropper's American Folklore Map. (Library of Congress)\n\nBig Foot Wallace (Texas): A ranger famous for his exploits in early Texas,\nWilliam A. A. Wallace fought Native Americans and Mexicans. Over time, his\nadventures became more legendary.\n\nFrankie and Johnny (Missouri): The story of feuding lovers was most famously\ninspired by a murder in St. Louis, when a 22-year-old woman shot her 17-year-\nold lover. It became famous through the folk song of the same name.\n\nJohn Brown (Kansas): John Brown is more a figure of history than folklore, but\nhis raid on Harpers Ferry became a legendary moment in American history. The\nfamous abolitionist was later executed.\n\nJesse James (Missouri): From Missouri, James was the Old West's most infamous\noutlaw and a celebrity even when alive. His death at the hands of Robert Fort\nsecured his place in American folklore.\n\nKemp Morgan (Oklahoma/Texas): The Paul Bunyan of the oil fields, he could\nsmell oil underground and drill for it more effectively than any normal man.\n\nSam Bass (Texas): This train robber and outlaw was shot in 1878 when scouting\na train robbery. He died the next day and became one of a few infamous\nstagecoach robbers.\n\nPecos Bill (Texas): The most iconic fake cowboy, Pecos Bill appeared in print\nin the short stories of Edward S. O'Reilly. He rode a mountain lion and\nlassoed a twister, among other exploits.\n\nKit Carson (Colorado): The frontiersman roved the mountains of Colorado and\nbecame a legendary guide in his lifetime thanks to his help guiding explorer\nJohn C. Fr\u00e9mont. Carson later took part in the Mexican-American War and the\nCivil War, and was involved in many conflicts with Native Americans in the\nWest.\n\nFin Mac Cool (Texas): An Irish hunter and warrior whose original name was\nFionn mac Cumhaill, Fin Mac Cool appears on this map in Texas. A Paul Bunyan\nfigure in Ireland, he may appear in a localized incarnation on the map.\n\nRoy Bean (Texas): This saloon keeper/judge supposedly held court in a saloon\nalong the Rio Grande. He became infamous as a hanging judge (despite little\nevidence that he did so much in real life).\n\nDeath Valley Scotty (California): Walter Edward Perry Scott became known by\nthis name for his many gold-mining scams and his notable mansion in Death\nValley, California.\n\n### The West\n\nWilliam Gropper's American Folklore Map. (Library of Congress)\n\nBabe the Blue Ox and Paul Bunyan (the West): Though Bunyan is best associated\nwith Minnesota, he's depicted here wandering across the Pacific Northwest,\nwhere numerous logging opportunities would be available.\n\nJohnny Inkslinger (the West): Like Bunyan, Johnny Inkslinger probably belongs\nin Minnesota or Wisconsin. Still, his unusual story is worth a mention: he was\nPaul Bunyan's timekeeper and accountant. He made his pen by connecting it to a\nbarrel of ink with a rubber hose.\n\nThe Famous Idaho Potato (Idaho): Less folklore than industry observation, the\nIdaho potato is the best-selling potato in the United States.\n\nCoronado (California): Francisco Vazquez de Coronado searched for the Seven\nCities of Gold in the 1500s, a quest that took him from Mexico to California\nand even to Kansas. Though he never found the seven cities, his efforts made\nhim famous.\n\nThe Celebrated Jumping Frog (California): The frog was immortalized in Mark\nTwain's story \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" which became\nnotable as a fable about gambling (and a very impressive amphibian).\n\nMormons (Utah): Why include Mormons on a map about folklore? It probably\nreflects the epic migration to Utah and the hardships suffered in the process.\nMormons' identification with the state continues today, but it was probably\neven stronger in 1946, when the map was made.\n\nJohn A. Sutter (California): Born in 1803, Sutter became symbolic of the\nCalifornia Gold Rush, and later established a fort that would become\nSacramento.\n\nGold Rush (California): The catalyst for much of the settling and exploration\nof California, the 1840s Gold Rush captured the nation's attention and spurred\nWestern migration (and the American imagination).\n\n### What the map means\n\nThe map of folklore shows the state of the American imagination (and Gropper's\nfascinations) in 1946. Notable gaps include the Pacific Northwest and the two\nfuture states of Hawaii and Alaska. Some inclusions \u2014 like Old Black Joe and\nMormons \u2014 make for an unusual fit for modern eyes. But overall, it shows the\niconic figures \u2014 real and fictional \u2014 that shaped the American imagination in\nthe '40s and continue to do so today.\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
