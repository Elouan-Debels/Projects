We were also made\naware of an article posted that same day with the same accusations. We have\ninvestigated these claims and are publishing the C&D letter, our response and\nthe source code origin document resulting from our investigation.\n\nThe OpenTofu team vehemently disagrees with any suggestion that it\nmisappropriated, mis-sourced, or otherwise misused HashiCorp\u2019s BSL code. All\nsuch statements have zero basis in facts.\n\nHashiCorp has made claims of copyright infringement in a cease & desist\nletter. These claims are completely unsubstantiated.\n\nThe code in question can be clearly shown to have been copied from older code\nunder the MPL-2.0 license. HashiCorp seems to have copied the same code itself\nwhen they implemented their version of this feature. All of this is easily\nvisible in our detailed SCO analysis, as well as their own comments which\nindicate this.\n\n## Documents\n\n  * HashiCorp's C&D Letter\n  * Our Response\n  * Source Code Origin Document: [HTML, PDF] \u21d0 For the detailed code analysis, see here.\n\nTo prevent further harassment of individual people, we have redacted any\npersonal information from these documents.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite these events, we have managed to carry out significant development on\nOpenTofu 1.7, including state encryption, \u201cfor_each\u201d implementation for\n\u201cimport\u201d blocks, as well as the all-new provider-defined functions supported\nby the recently released provider plugin protocol.\n\nOn that note, we will be releasing a new pre-release version next week, and we\nare eager to gather feedback from the community.\n\n\u2014 The OpenTofu Team\n\nThe image in this blog post contains code licensed under the BUSL-1.1 by\nHashiCorp.
