Using cryo-electron microscopy, we reveal how the fractal assembles\nfrom a hexameric building block. Although different stimuli modulate the\nformation of fractal complexes and these complexes can regulate the enzymatic\nactivity of citrate synthase in vitro, the fractal may not serve a\nphysiological function in vivo. We use ancestral sequence reconstruction to\nretrace how the citrate synthase fractal evolved from non-fractal precursors,\nand the results suggest it may have emerged as a harmless evolutionary\naccident. Our findings expand the space of possible protein complexes and\ndemonstrate that intricate and regulatable assemblies can evolve in a single\nsubstitution.\n\n## Main\n\nFractals are repeating patterns in which substructures at smaller scales\nresemble structures at larger scales^1. These shapes are fascinating because\nthey can be constructed using simple mathematical rules that result in\nstructures of extraordinary complexity and beauty^1. Fractals exist in nature\nin the branching patterns of plant leaf veins, in coastal lines and in river\nsystems^2,3,4. Most natural fractals are irregular. That is, their structures\nat different scales do not exactly match. Instead, their self-similarity\nemerges from similar levels of detail in structures formed at different\nscales. The rare examples of regular fractals in nature, such as the repeating\nstructures in Romanesco broccoli, have been intensely studied to understand\nthe underlying mechanisms that produce exact self-similarity^13.\n\nAll known regular fractals in nature are made by living organisms and exist at\nthe macroscopic scale. However, none have yet been discovered in nature at the\nmolecular scale despite the extraordinary diversity of biomolecular assemblies\nknown to science^14,15. The reason for this may be that fractal construction\nalgorithms are difficult to translate into molecular self-assembly. For\nexample, the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, one of the best known regular fractals^16,\ncan be created by triangular subdivision or through a stochastic \u2018chaos game\u2019\nthat relies on non-local rules^17, or by colouring in all elements of Pascal\u2019s\ntriangle that have odd binomial coefficients. Conversely, self-assembly of\nbiomolecules occurs through the sequential addition of subunits rather than by\nsubdivision and relies on local contacts between protomers to coordinate\nassembly.\n\nSynthetic designs have overcome these constraints and have built Sierpi\u0144ski\ntriangles out of small organic molecules. A key element of these designs is a\nmolecular building block in which the structure traces out a 120\u00b0\nangle^5,6,7,8,12. This angle matches that between subtriangles within the\nequilateral Sierpi\u0144ski triangle and allows a single monomer to bridge between\nsubtriangles in a manner that passivates their edges. This arrangement ensures\nthat new triangles can only be attached on the tips of an existing triangle\nand thereby produces the large voids of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. Other designs\nuse metal coordination to enforce this angle^9,10,11. All designer fractals\nrequire special surfaces, precise temperature control during assembly or\nfinely tuned ratios of different precursors to produce Sierpi\u0144ski\nfractals^5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Such delicate assembly requirements are unlikely\nto be met in cells, which makes the possibility of natural versions of these\nfractals seem remote.\n\nHere we report the discovery of a natural metabolic enzyme capable of forming\nSierpi\u0144ski triangles in dilute aqueous solution at room temperature. We\ndetermine the structure, assembly mechanism and its regulation of enzymatic\nactivity in vitro and finally how it evolved from non-fractal precursors.\n\n## A protein that forms Sierpi\u0144ski triangles\n\nBacterial citrate synthase (CS) proteins are homo-oligomeric enzymes that can\nassemble into dimers and hexamers^18. We discovered that CS from the\ncyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 7942 (SeCS) forms an unusual assembly. Mass\nphotometry (MP) analyses of the purified enzyme at nanomolar concentrations\nrevealed a complex comprising 18 CS subunits (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig.\n1a).\n\nFig. 1: CS of S. elongatus PCC 7942 assembles into Sierpi\u0144ski triangles.\n\na, Distribution of oligomeric protein complexes of purified CS from two\ncyanobacterial species, S. elongatus PCC 7942 (SeCS, monomer mass = 44.3 kDa)\nand Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (monomer mass = 45.9 kDa), measured by MP.\nCartoons represent the assembly of known CS proteins. b, Distribution of SeCS\nsubunits in the different oligomeric complexes corresponding to the MP\nmeasurements in a. c,d, 2D class averages of purified SeCS recorded by\nnegative-stained EM. The 6mer complexes did not produce top-views (Extended\nData Fig. 1b). Therefore, an isolated 6mer of the 18mer class average was used\nfor representation. Schematics of the images are on the right. e, Box-counting\nquantification of the Hausdorff dimensions (D) using the class averages of the\n18mers and 54mers. Data are presented as the mean values of three different\ngrid positions, and error bars correspond to s.d. D was obtained from the\nslope of the regression line (R^2_54mer = 0.996, R^2_18mer = 0.997). f, R_g\nvalues inferred from SAXS data for SeCS and a hexameric variant (SeCS L18Q;\nFig. 5d) at varying protein concentrations. The experiment was conducted by\nstarting at the highest concentration and then serially diluting the protein.\nLarger assemblies are therefore reversible. One sample for each concentration\nstep was measured over ten frames. The data presented are the inferred R_g\nvalues using Guinier approximation, and error bars correspond to the s.d. of\nfit values calculated from the covariance matrix (Sc\u00c5tter IV). Dashed lines\nindicate R_g values calculated from the indicated structural models of the\n6mer, 18mer and 54mer.\n\nFull size image\n\nWe investigated the structure of these assemblies by negative-stain electron\nmicroscopy (EM) and observed that SeCS assembles into regular triangular\ncomplexes of different sizes (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1b\u2013f). The\n18mer contains 9 discernible densities, each corresponding to a dimer. Three\ndimers are first arranged in a hexameric ring and three hexamers then connect\ninto a triangle. This 18mer represented the main oligomeric species under MP\nconditions (>80% of all CS subunits at 50 nM; Fig. 1b). Rarely (on the order\nof 3\u20134% of particles; Methods), we observed even larger complexes comprising\n36 or 54 CS subunits on the micrographs, which were recorded at a 9 times\nhigher protein concentration than for MP (450 nM). The 54mer consisted of\nthree 18mers arranged into an even larger triangle with a large void at its\ncentre (Fig. 1c). The 6mer, 18mer and 54mer represent the zeroth, first and\nsecond order of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, a well-known regular fractal\ngeometry. The 36mer represents another kind of triangle, but shares the 6mer\nbuilding block and the overall triangular shape (Fig. 1d). Additional regular\nassemblies that were sporadically observed also retained the triangular edges\n(Extended Data Fig. 1g).\n\nTo validate that the 18mer and the 54mer assemblies are fractal geometries, we\napproximated their Hausdorff dimension D. For non-fractal shapes, D takes on\ninteger values (a square has 2, a cube has 3, and so on), whereas for\nfractals, it can be non-integer, with different fractals having their specific\ncharacteristic D values. We applied the box-counting method, which produced\nnon-integer values that closely corresponded to the calculated fractal\ndimension of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, considering also the limitations of box\ncounting^19,20 (Fig. 1e; D_18mer = 1.53 \u00b1 0.02, D_54mer = 1.67 \u00b1 0.02,\nD_Sierpi\u0144ski = 1.59; mean \u00b1 s.d.). Mathematical fractals repeat themselves\ninfinitely, so we explored whether our protein fractal could increase in size\nbeyond 54 subunits. We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements\nto assess the radius of gyration (R_g) in solution at a range of\nconcentrations and compared our measured values to theoretical R_g values\ncalculated for structural models of the 6mer, 18mer, and 54mer (Supplementary\nFig. 2). At concentrations above 100 \u03bcM (approximately 220 times higher than\nthe concentrations used for negative-stain EM, and 2,000 times higher than for\nMP measurements), we measured R_g values that exceeded the size of 54mers and\nrapidly reached the limit of detection (Fig. 1f). Although we cannot prove\nthat the larger assemblies are Sierpi\u0144ski triangles rather than some other\ntype of assembly, these experiments indicate that the protein is capable of\nextended growth, as predicted for fractal assembly.\n\n## Structural basis of Sierpi\u0144ski assembly\n\nTo assemble a hexameric building block into a Sierpi\u0144ski fractal, a new\ninterface needs to be introduced between dimers. This interface has to satisfy\ntwo conditions. First, it has to connect hexamers along their 120\u00b0 external\nangle to result in a triangle. Second, the interface has to be made between\nonly two dimers, such that no more subunits can associate into the edges of\nthe triangle (Fig. 2a). These criteria ensure that the edges of the triangles\nremain passivated and enables the large voids of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle to\nform. These demands are difficult to meet with protein\u2013protein interfaces that\nare commonly found in homomers^21. However, a 120\u00b0 angle between hexamers can\nbe achieved through the introduction of a three-fold symmetrical, head-to-tail\nC3 interface between dimers. But such an interface fails our second demand\nbecause it allows a third dimer to associate into it, which results in a\ntriangular lattice and not a fractal. We could satisfy our second demand with\na two-fold, head-to-head C2 interface between dimers, but this requires that\nhexamers no longer interact at the correct angle, which results in a hexagonal\nlattice (Fig. 2a).\n\nFig. 2: Levels of fractal assembly.\n\na, Schematic representation of the requisites needed to produce a Sierpi\u0144ski\nfractal from hexameric blocks and the symmetry-based constraints on oligomeric\nassembly. Green and blue dots represent active or open interfaces,\nrespectively. b, Cryo-EM density maps of Sierpi\u0144ski triangles of the zeroth,\nfirst and second fractal level. The 6mer (3.1 \u00c5) was derived from the\nhexameric \u03942\u20136 SeCS variant. The 18mer (3.9 \u00c5) was derived from the wild-type\n(WT) SeCS. The 54mer (5.9 \u00c5) was derived from the pH-stabilized variant H369R\nSeCS.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo understand how the fractal forms assemble, we solved structures for the\nzeroth order (6mer, 3.1 \u00c5), first order (18mer, 3.9 \u00c5) and second order\n(54mer, 5.9 \u00c5) of the protein Sierpi\u0144ski triangle by cryo-EM (Fig. 2b,\nExtended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 3\u20135).\n\nIn the 18mer (level 1), CS dimers assemble into hexamers through a\nheterologous interface similar to known hexameric CS proteins. The 18mer is\nthen formed through an additional contact between two dimers of adjacent\nhexamers. This interface has an unusual geometry, whereby only one monomer\nfrom each dimer participates in the interaction. This is uncommon for\ninterfaces that create dimers of dimers, in which normally all four chains\nparticipate equally in the interface^14. The two participating monomers form\nan interface between the amino terminus of one monomer and the carboxy\nterminus of the other and vice versa (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). An\ninteraction between the residue E6 from one monomer and H369 of the other\nestablishes an important contact, and mutating either E6 or H369 to alanine or\ndeleting amino acids 2\u20136 (\u03942\u20136 SeCS) abolishes the formation of fractals\n(Extended Data Fig. 2b). In the two non-participating monomers, the termini\nface outwards. They cannot engage in the same interaction with another dimer\nwithout causing a steric clash (Extended Data Fig. 2c) and thereby passivate\nthe edge of the triangular assembly. In the 18mer, the non-equivalence between\nchains allows the interaction to form at the correct angle and ensures that no\nmore dimers can associate into it. This geometry further proves that 18mers\nare not merely a substructure of an otherwise ordinary triangular lattice but\nactually represent the first order of a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle.\n\nFig. 3: The molecular basis of fractal assembly.\n\na, Close-up of the interface that produces the 18mer. Two out of the four\nadjacent protomers are making the connection (dark red and light blue). b,\nStructural alignment of a free \u03942\u20136 SeCS hexamer with an extracted hexamer\nfrom the 18mer structure. Black arrows indicate the molecular displacement in\nthe 18mer, which corresponds to a rotation of the connecting dimers around an\ninternal axis (black axis). The symmetry axes of the dimer interfaces are\nshown as dotted lines for reference. c, Dihedral angles between dimers\ninteracting across the fractal interface are depicted for the connection\nwithin and between 18mers in a 54mer. Dimers are shown as blue and red, and\ngreen and olive outlines, respectively.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo understand how this interface forms, we compared the geometry of a variant\nthat could only assemble into hexamers (\u03942\u20136 SeCS; Fig. 2b and Extended Data\nFig. 2b) to that of a hexamer within the 18mer. We extracted a hexamer from\nthe 18mer structure, aligned its free corner dimer onto one dimer of \u03942\u20136 SeCS\nand then compared the positions of the two unaligned dimers between the\nstructures (Fig. 3b). This analysis revealed that the two dimers engaging in\nfractal connections undergo a small clockwise rotation relative to their\nconformation within a free hexamer, which subtly breaks the D3 symmetry of the\nhexameric building block within the fractal (Fig. 3b).\n\nWe next sought to understand how 18mers then assemble into 54-mers. We could\nnot obtain a structure of the 54mer from wild-type SeCS because the protein\ntended to aggregate on the grids. Together with a strong tendency for\npreferential orientation, this resulted in too few top views of 54mers to\nsolve a structure. Instead, we solved this structure for a point mutant\n(H369R), which we generated in the course of a structure\u2013function analysis\n(described further below). This protein also forms 18mers at levels that are\nindistinguishable from wild-type SeCS at 50 nM (Extended Data Fig. 2b).\nMoreover, it is capable of forming the larger assemblies. It produced less\naggregated cryo-EM grids, which enabled us to solve a 5.9 \u00c5 structure of the\n54mer.\n\nThis structure first revealed that edges are passivated along its outward\nfacing edges as well as those facing its large internal void, which did not\nallow hexamers to attach there without introducing steric clashes (Extended\nData Fig. 2e,f). It also revealed that the interaction that holds 18mers into\nthe 54mer uses the same surface as the interaction that holds 6mers into the\n18mers. However, the dihedral angle between dimers across the interaction is\ndifferent for the two types of connection within the 54mer (Fig. 3c). That is,\nthe interaction between 6mers is made at 60\u00b0, which is identical to the angle\nat which it is made in a free 18mer. By contrast, the angle between 18mers\nwithin the 54mers is 34\u00b0. This different angle is necessary because the\ndihedral angle of interaction between hexamers is too large across the length\nof an 18mer to close the triangle in a 54mer (Extended Data Fig. 2g). For even\nlarger assemblies, this angle would have to shrink further because it is\namplified over even larger distances. The large assemblies we observed in our\nnegative-stain EM experiments imply that small dihedral angles (which would be\nnecessary to close large triangles) are possible. However, they may be less\nenergetically favourable, which may explain why first-order fractals form\nreadily at low nanomolar concentrations, whereas larger assemblies only occur\nat micromolar concentrations.\n\nThe 36mers and other complexes we sporadically observed seemed to partially\nviolate the assembly rules we discovered in 18mers and 54mers. These complexes\nmore closely resemble a two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice, but with sharp\ntriangular edges (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1g). The main difference that\ndistinguishes 36mers from the fractal 18mers and 54mers is a three-way\njunction of dimers in the centre of the 36mer. The interaction we discovered\nin 18mers cannot support such a three-fold association (Extended Data Fig.\n3a). This result suggests one of two possibilities. One, this three-way\njunction is not a fully formed interface and the subunits are merely in close\nproximity. The other possibility is that this three-way junction is formed by\na distinct C3 interface between dimers that we do not observe in our 18mer,\nwhich would imply that SeCS can also form regular triangular lattices\n(Extended Data Fig. 3a). Our 2D class average of the 36mer was not of\nsufficient resolution to distinguish between these possibilities, but two\nlines of evidence argue against an additional C3 interface. First, a mutation\nthat ablates the fractal interface we see in the 18mer through a steric clash\nresults in only hexamers and no larger stoichiometries (Fig. 1f). If an\nadditional C3 interface exists, it must therefore overlap with the interface\nwe see in 18mers. Second, we created a mutant that significantly weakened the\ninterface to form hexameric subcomplexes but leaves the residues that form the\nfractal interaction intact (D147A). If an additional C3 interface is present,\nthis variant should form hexamers and tetramers through the fractal\ninteraction. We observed mostly tetramers with this mutant, with only a small\nfraction of hexamers and larger complexes (Extended Data Fig. 3b\u2013i). This\nresult implies that no strong additional C3 interface is present, which is\nalso consistent with the fact that we see roughly similar numbers of 36mers\nand 54mers, despite the much larger subunit number of the latter (the number\nof particles observed in negative-stain EM was 186 for 36mers and 200 for\n54mers).\n\nTogether, these observations reveal the larger principle at work from which\nSierpi\u0144ski triangles emerge. All assemblies we observed seemed to minimize the\nnumber of unsatisfied fractal interfaces. At stoichiometries for which\nSierpi\u0144ski triangles can be built (18, 54, 162, and so on), they are always\nthe most efficient way to achieve this, leaving only 3 dimers at the corners\nof the triangle unsatisfied (Extended Data Fig. 4a). At intermediate\nstoichiometries, the protein apparently populates non-fractal but still\ntriangular assemblies, which leave more dimers partially unsatisfied in the\ninterior of the triangle (although we note that six 36mers could be arranged\ninto a different type of fractal that is based on Pascal\u2019s triangle; Extended\nData Fig. 4b). What unites all these assemblies is their distinct triangular\nshape, which also distinguishes them from the few other natural proteins that\nform 2D lattices^22. Notably, SeCS achieves these assemblies without the help\nof metal coordination or symmetrical surfaces to assemble on, which synthetic\nSierpi\u0144ski triangles usually require. Instead, this ability emerges from the\nflexibility of individual protomers, breaking local symmetries as they\nassemble into higher-order structures. Conformational flexibility is a feature\nof many proteins^23, and there are no other obvious properties that make the\nhexameric building blocks of SeCS particularly suited to constructing\nSierpi\u0144ski triangles when compared with other dihedral homomeric protein\ncomplexes. Fractals and other non-crystalline 2D assemblies may therefore be\nconstructed using a variety of other proteins and common assemblies as\nbuilding blocks.\n\n## Function of Sierpi\u0144ski assemblies\n\nWe next investigated whether the assembly into 18mers, which were the dominant\noligomeric species at physiological protein concentrations, has functional\nconsequences for the enzyme. CS catalyses the condensation of acetyl-CoA and\noxaloacetate to citrate as the first step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.\nAddition of either of the substrates or the reaction product resulted in the\ndisassembly of the structure into hexamers (Fig. 4a), which implies that\nhexamers are the catalytically active stoichiometry. We tested this idea in\ntwo ways. We first measured enzyme kinetics of the wild type and a variant\nthat is incapable of forming fractals (SeCS L18Q). Under saturating substrate\nconditions, which completely disrupt fractal assembly, the kinetic parameters\nof both variants were almost identical (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 5a).\nUnder non-saturating conditions, in which part of the 18mers remain, the wild-\ntype SeCS was only half as active as the hexameric variant (Fig. 4b). Second,\nwe constructed a mutant (cys4) that covalently stabilizes the fractal\ninterface through a disulfide bridge. For this variant, a proportion of the\nfractal complexes remained at saturated substrate concentrations (Extended\nData Fig. 5b). The k_cat of cys4 was reduced compared with wild-type SeCS.\nThis decline in activity was reversible after addition of reductant, which\nbreaks the disulfide bridges (Extended Data Fig. 5c). These results imply that\nassembly into fractal complexes significantly reduces catalytic activity.\n\nFig. 4: Fractal formation affects catalysis in vitro but not fitness in vivo.\n\na, Fraction of SeCS subunits in 6mers and 18mers at different concentrations\nof the two substrates acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate and the product citrate\nquantified by MP.

Comparison of the citrate-bound\nconformation and the 18mer is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6b. d, MP\nquantification of SeCS subunits in 18mers at different pH values for the WT\nand the H369R variant.

Serial dilutions of three independent cultures\nare shown for each time point. Uncropped image in Supplementary Fig. 1b.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo understand why 18mers are less active, we solved a crystal structure of a\ncitrate-bound hexamer at 2.7 \u00c5 (Extended Data Table 2 and Extended Data Fig.\n6a). Comparing this structure to the one of a free hexamer (\u03942\u20136 SeCS)\nrevealed that the CS dimers within the hexamer undergo an anticlockwise\nrotation after binding to citrate (Fig. 4c). This rigid-body rotation is well\nknown from other CS enzymes^24,25. It takes place following substrate binding\nand pushes CS from an open conformation (which corresponds to the conformation\nin the \u03942\u20136 SeCS structure) into a closed form in which catalysis takes\nplace^26. The rotation into the closed form is in the opposite direction to\nthe clockwise rotation that dimers undergo to associate into the fractal. This\nresult implies that fractal complexes have to perform a significantly larger\nconformational movement to induce substrate binding or catalysis, which\nprobably imposes a higher energetic barrier that could explain the decrease in\nenzyme activity (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).\n\nWe next asked whether this unusual assembly might have a function in S.\nelongatus, perhaps as a means to regulate the enzyme. We were led in this\ndirection because fractal complexes are pH sensitive. Indeed, an increase in\nthe pH from 7.5 to 9 led to complete disassembly of the structure into\nhexamers (Fig. 4d). This behaviour is driven by the residue H369 in the\nfractal interface, and changing it to arginine abolished the pH sensitivity\nwithout compromising its assembly into fractals (Fig. 4d and Extended Data\nFig. 6d\u2013g). Notably, S. elongatus undergoes a diurnal change in its\nintracellular pH that nearly matches the pK_a of the fractal interface. During\nthe day, its carbon concentration mechanism pushes the pH to 8.4 through the\nimport of bicarbonate. At night, the pH returns to around 7.3 (ref. ^27).\nBecause fractal assembly reduces activity, the circadian pH shift could\ninhibit SeCS activity at night. This scenario seems plausible for two reasons:\nthe intracellular substrate and product levels we observed were substantially\nbelow what would be necessary to disrupt 18mers (Extended Data Fig. 6h\u2013i).\nTherefore, the assembly could reasonably form at night when the pH is\nsufficiently low. Second, CS is en route to 2-oxoglutarate, the only known\nprecursor for nitrogen assimilation into glutamine and glutamate in S.\nelongatus, and several other enzymes in this pathway are known to be shut off\nat night^28. To test this idea, we created genetically modified strains\ncarrying the wild-type CS or a mutant CS incapable of forming fractals at the\nnative locus in S. elongatus. We quantified their growth under continuous\nlight and under a 12-h day\u2013night cycle, but found no differences in either\ncondition (Fig. 4e). We also investigated whether the formation of fractals\nprevents the depletion of the tricarboxylic acid cycle owing to the synthesis\nof amino acids during nitrogen starvation. Such a regulation is described in\nthe related cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (ref. ^29), but the\nregulators of this specific mechanism are not present in S. elongatus^30. We\ntherefore tested both genetically modified S. elongatus strains for recovery\nfrom nitrogen starvation. We again found no difference between the strains\ncarrying the wild-type CS or non-fractal CS variant (Fig. 4f). Even though the\nassembly has many hallmarks of being regulatory (catalytic differences between\nstoichiometries, responsiveness to physiological conditions), it is apparently\nnot important for fitness under our experimental conditions, although we\ncannot rule out that it might be under natural conditions.\n\n## Evolution of the Sierpi\u0144ski assembly\n\nBased on these observations, we wondered whether this assembly could simply be\nan accident of history that is functionally inconsequential. We therefore\nsought to understand its evolutionary history. To that end, we first inferred\na phylogenetic tree for CS proteins within Cyanobacteria, with CS proteins\nfrom marine Gammaproteobacteria as an outgroup (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig.\n6). Based on this tree, we then characterized CS proteins from several\nrelatives of S. elongatus (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We did not find 18mers in\nany of these relatives, except for Planktothrix mougeotii. Here we observed a\nvery low abundance of 18mers that could be abolished by deleting the same\nN-terminal residues that abrogate assembly in SeCS (Fig. 5b). This result\nimplies that 18mers, and by extension fractals, must have evolved along the\nlineage to S. elongatus, probably in the last common ancestor of P. mougeotii\nand S. elongatus and were then quickly lost again along the lineage to\nCyanobium/Prochlorococcus.\n\nFig. 5: Evolution of the SeCS fractal.\n\na, Phylogenetic tree of CS in Cyanobacteria (full phylogeny in Supplementary\nFig. 6). Internal nodes that were resurrected by ancestral sequence\nreconstruction are labelled with branch support by Felsenstein\u2019s bootstrap and\napproximate likelihood test statistic. b, MP of purified extant CS from the\nPlanktothrix clade and its N-terminal truncation. c, MP of purified ancestral\nCS. PP, average posterior probability of the maximum a posteriori state of the\nreconstructed sequence over all amino acids. d,g, MP of ancestral CS proteins\nwith individual historical substitutions (lowercase and uppercase letters\nrefer to ancestral and derived amino acids, respectively). e,f, Location of\nthe substitutions within the structure of the SeCS 18mer.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo test this theory, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect\nancestral CS proteins at successive nodes leading from SeCS towards the root\nand characterized their assemblies by MP (Fig. 5c). The most recent of the\nancestors (ancA) also formed 18mers at nanomolar concentrations and at\nabundances similar to SeCS. ancB, the immediate predecessor of ancA, also\nformed 18mers, but at a lower abundance, which indicated a weaker fractal\ninterface. Results from SAXS analyses also verified that ancB can form larger\nassemblies at higher concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 7b). All subsequent\nancestors (ancC\u2013ancE) only formed hexamers. Together, these data suggest that\nrelatively weak fractals evolved from hexamers between ancC and ancB, which\nthen became stronger between ancB and ancA. Similar results were obtained when\nresurrecting alternative, less likely sequences for these ancestors (Extended\nData Fig. 8a\u2013e).\n\nWe then sought to identify which historical amino acid substitutions enabled\nfractal assembly. Notably, the side chains E6 and H369, which form the crucial\nand pH-sensitive contact of the fractal interface, are already present in\nancestors that do not yet form fractals (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). Only one\nsubstitution, q18L (lowercase and uppercase letters refer to ancestral and\nderived amino acids, respectively) occurred in the fractal interface within\nthe interval between ancC and ancB, when fractals first evolved. Introducing\nonly q18L into ancC was sufficient to trigger the formation of fractal\ncomplexes (Fig. 5d), including complexes larger than 18mers (Extended Data\nFig. 8h). Reversing this substitution (L18q) in SeCS abolished fractal\nassembly (Fig. 5d). In our 18mer structure, the L18 side chains from the two\nnon-participating monomers are at the centre of the fractal interface (Fig. 5e\nand Extended Data Fig. 8i), but do not interact across the interface. q18L\ntherefore probably removed a repulsive polar interaction from the interface\nthat prevented fractals from forming in ancC. Introducing the substitution\nq18L into more ancient ancestors than ancC did not, however, produce fractals\n(Extended Data Fig. 8j). The historical window of opportunity in which\nfractals could evolve through just the q18L substitution was therefore very\nnarrow.\n\nWe next searched for substitutions that strengthened the fractal interface\nalong the interval between ancB and ancA. Only two conservative substitutions\noccurred at interfaces along this interval: k8R, which is located in the\nfractal interface and potentially allowed a more stable hydrogen bonding\ninteraction with the backbone of the opposing monomer (Fig. 5e and Extended\nData Fig. 8k), and y80F, which is located in the older interface connecting\ndimers into hexamers. In SeCS, our density analysis suggested that F80 engages\nin a cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction across the hexamer interface (Fig. 5f and Extended\nData Fig. 8l). y80F may have affected the strength of this interaction^31,\npotentially making the dimer rotations that are necessary to associate into\n18mers more favourable. Neither substitution alone led to more stable 18mers\nwhen introduced into ancB. Both substitutions together, however, produced a\nfraction of 18mers comparable with that of ancA (Fig. 5g). Conversely,\nreversing these historical substitutions in wild-type SeCS destabilized the\n18mers (R8k, F80y; Extended Data Fig. 8m).\n\nTogether, our results show that building a stable fractal required a markedly\nsmall number of substitutions and no new strong contacts in the fractal\ninterface. This result is consistent with previous studies showing that\nindividual substitutions can substantially shift the occupancy of oligomeric\nstates or induce supramolecular assembly^32,33,34,35,36. This facile origin\nand almost immediate subsequent losses in two lineages (Extended Data Fig. 8b)\nmake a non-adaptive origin at least plausible. Moreover, the pK_a of the new\ninterface was already primed to match the physiological pH fluctuations as\nsoon as the assembly emerged: introducing q18L into ancC (which, without this\nmutation, cannot make 18mers) resulted in an interface that dissociated over a\nsimilar pH range as in wild-type SeCS (Extended Data Fig. 8n). The apparently\nphysiologically tuned pK_a of the assembly is therefore either a molecular\nspandrel (a feature that initially evolved for reasons unrelated to its\ncurrent use^37) or simply a coincidence that looks deceptively adaptive. The\nlarge assemblies this protein can build are more clearly an evolutionary\naccident: as beautifully regular and complex as higher-order Sierpi\u0144ski\ntriangles are, they only appear at non-physiological concentrations and their\nsize would be difficult to fit into the cytoplasm of S. elongatus. Even if the\n18mer fulfils a useful function, the ability of the protein to make larger\nassemblies is almost certainly an accidental by-product of the unusual\nsymmetry it happened to have evolved.\n\nBased on our findings, we suspect that evolutionary transitions in self-\nassembly may be more common than structural databases make it seem. As\ntechniques to characterize protein complexes improve, we may discover a\nmenagerie of assembly types that come and go as proteins evolve. Perhaps only\na small fraction ever become important to their organisms and persist. Many\nothers will fade as quickly as they appeared. We can therefore only wonder\nabout how many unique assemblies have evolved over the eons that never made it\nto the present for us to observe.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Molecular cloning\n\nThe gene encoding CS from S. elongatus PCC 7942 was amplified from genomic DNA\nby PCR (Q5 High-Fidelity 2\u00d7 Master Mix, New England Biolabs) and introduced\ninto the pLIC expression vector^38 by Gibson cloning (Gibson Assembly Master\nMix, New England Biolabs). All other extant and ancestral CS sequences were\nobtained as gene fragments from Twist Bioscience and introduced into the same\nexpression vector by Gibson cloning. All CS sequences were tagged with a\nC-terminal polyhistidine tag for purification (tag sequence: LE-HHHHHH-Stop).\nFor single-site mutants and deletions of the CS sequences, KLD enzyme mix (New\nEngland Biolabs) was used. Mutagenesis primers were designed with\nNEBasechanger and used to PCR-amplify the vector encoding for the gene that\nwas to be changed. Resulting PCR products were added to the KLD enzyme mix and\nsubsequently transformed. All cloned genes were verified by Sanger sequencing\n(Microsynth) before use in experiments.\n\nThe DNA sequences of all purified proteins and NCBI identifiers of all extant\nsequences are presented in Supplementary Table 2.\n\n### Protein purification\n\nFor heterologous overexpression, the vectors with the gene of interest were\ntransformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells.\nTransformed colonies were used to inoculate expression cultures (500 ml) made\nfrom LB medium supplemented with 12.5 g l^\u20131 lactose (Fisher Chemical). The\ncultures were incubated overnight at 30 \u00b0C and 200 r.p.m. Cells were collected\nby centrifugation (4,500g, 15 min, 4 \u00b0C), resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris,\n300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, pH 8) and freshly supplemented with DNAse I\n(3 units \u03bcl^\u20131, Applichem). The cells were disrupted using a Microfluidizer\n(Microfluidics) in 3 cycles at 15,000 psi and centrifuged to spin down cell\ndebris and aggregates (30,000g, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C). The clarified lysate was loaded\nwith a peristaltic pump (Hei-FLOW 06, Heidolph) on prepacked nickel-NTA\ncolumns (5 ml Nuvia IMAC Ni-Charged, Bio-Rad) that were pre-equilibrated with\nbuffer A. The loaded column was first washed with buffer A for 7 column\nvolumes and then with 10% (v/v) buffer B (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM\nimidazole, pH 8) in buffer A for 7 column volumes. The bound protein was\neluted with buffer B and either buffer-exchanged with PD-10 desalting columns\n(Cytiva) into PBS or 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 or further purified by\nsize-exclusion chromatography (SEC). For SEC, the protein was injected on an\nENrich SEC 650 column (Bio-Rad) with PBS as the running buffer using a NGC\nChromatography System (Bio-Rad). The purity of the proteins was analysed by\nSDS\u2013PAGE. After either buffer exchange or SEC, the purified proteins were\nflash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C before further use.\n\n### Phylogenetic analysis and ancestral sequence reconstruction\n\nAmino acid sequences of 84 CS genes from Cyanobacteria and marine\nGammaproteobacteria as the outgroup were collected from the NCBI Reference\nSequence database and aligned using MUSCLE (v.3.8.31)^39. The maximum\nlikelihood (ML) phylogeny was inferred from the multiple sequence alignment\n(MSA) using raxML (v.8.2.10)^40. The LG substitution matrix^41 was used as\ndetermined by automatic best-fit model selection as well as fixed base\nfrequencies and a gamma model of rate heterogeneity. The robustness of the ML\ntree topology was assessed by inferring 100 non-parametric bootstrap trees\nwith raxML, from which Felsenstein\u2019s and transfer bootstrap values were\nderived using BOOSTER (https://booster.pasteur.fr). Using PhyML (3.0)^42, we\nalso inferred approximate likelihood-ratio test^43 for branches to\nstatistically evaluate branch support in the phylogeny.\n\nBased on the CS tree and the MSA, ancestral sequences were inferred using the\ncodeML package within PAML (v.4.9)^44. To adjust for gaps and the different\nlengths of N termini in the CS sequences, their ancestral state was determined\nusing parsimony inference in PAUP (4.0a) based on a binary version of the MSA\n(1 = amino acid, 0 = gap, no residue). The state assignment for each node in\nthe tree (amino acid or gap) was then applied to the inferred ancestral\nsequences.\n\nThe initial reconstruction of the crucial amino acid substitution q18L was\nambiguous in the ancestors ancB and ancA. We determined that this was the case\nbecause this L residue is present in the Planktothrix clade and S. elongatus,\nbut not in the Cyanobium/Prochlorococcus clade. Therefore, the L residue was\neither gained once and then lost along the lineage to\nCyanobium/Prochlorococcus or it was gained convergently twice in Planktothrix\nand S. elongatus. We therefore added the CS sequence from the cyanobacterium\nProchlorothrix hollandica to the alignment, which has been stably inferred as\na sister group to S. elongatus and the Cyanobium/Prochlorococcus clade by\nmultiple studies^45,46,47. This sequence was previously omitted from analysis\nas its position on the tree could not be inferred with high support. We\nmanually added a branch to the tree, placing P. hollandica as a sister group\nto S. elongatus and the Cyanobium/Prochlorococcus clade. Branch lengths were\nreoptimized using raxML and the ancestral reconstruction repeated using PAML.\nThe results gave high support to the substitution q18L being found in both\nancB and ancA (Extended Data Fig. 8b) because P. hollandica also contains the\nL at position 18. This made the hypothesis of one gain and a subsequent loss\nin the Cyanobium/Prochlorococcus clade much more probable compared with three\nindependent gains in Planktothrix, P. hollandica and S. elongatus.\n\n### MP analysis\n\nMeasurements were performed on a OneMP mass photometer (Refeyn). Reusable\nsilicone gaskets (CultureWellTM, CW-50R-1.0, 50-3 mm diameter \u00d7 1 mm depth)\nwere set up on a cleaned microscopic cover slip (1.5 H, 24 \u00d7 60 mm, Carl Roth)\nand mounted on the stage of the mass photometer using immersion oil\n(IMMOIL-F30CC, Olympus). The gasket was filled with 19 \u03bcl buffer (PBS or 20 mM\nTris, 200 mM NaCl pH 7.5) to focus the instrument. Then, 1 \u03bcl of prediluted\nprotein solution (1 \u03bcM) was added to the buffer droplet and thoroughly mixed.\nThe final concentration of the proteins during measurement was 50 nM unless\nstated otherwise. Data were acquired for 60 s at 100 frames per s using\nAcquireMP (Refeyn, v.1.2.1). The resulting movies were processed and analysed\nusing DiscoverMP (Refeyn, v.2.5.0). The identified protein complexes with\ncorresponding molecular weight were plotted as histograms, and the individual\noligomeric state populations appeared as peaks that were fitted by a Gaussian\ncurve (implemented in DiscoverMP). All complexes within the respective\nGaussian curve were used to calculate the fraction of CS subunits in each\noligomeric state. The instrument was calibrated at least once during each\nmeasuring session using either a commercial standard (NativeMark unstained\nprotein standard, Thermo Fisher) or a homemade calibration standard of a\nprotein with known sizes of complexes.\n\nFor substrate titrations, the prediluted protein sample (2 \u03bcM) was incubated\nfor 10 min with the respective substrate concentration. The same substrate\nconcentration was also included in the buffer in the gasket that was used for\nfocusing. For each substrate concentration, three separate measurements were\nperformed. For pH titrations, the protein sample was diluted into the buffer\nwith the corresponding pH value (20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl pH 7\u20139.5). The\ndilution factor was at least 200, including predilution and final dilution in\nthe gasket. For each pH value, two separate measurements were performed.\n\n### Native mass spectrometry\n\nThe purified protein samples were buffer-exchanged into 200 mM ammonium\nacetate by using centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra) and three\nsuccessive rounds of concentration and dilution. The concentration of protein\nwas determined by UV absorbance (NanoDrop spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher)\nand diluted into aliquots at appropriate monomeric concentrations.\nNanoelectrospray was carried out in positive-ion mode on a Q Exactive UHMR\nmass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher), using gold-coated capillaries prepared in-\nhouse and the application of a modest backing pressure (about 0.5 mbar).\nSulfur hexafluoride was introduced into the collision \u2018HCD\u2019 cell to improve\ntransmission, and the instrument was operated at a resolution of 6,250 (at 200\nm/z), with \u2018high detector optimization\u2019, and a trapping pressure in the HCD\ncell set to 4. The rest of the parameters were optimized for each sample, with\nthe following ranges: capillary voltage of 1.2\u20131.5 kV; capillary temperature\nof 100\u2013250 \u00b0C; in-source trapping from \u221215 to \u2212150 V; injection times of\n50\u2013100 ms; and 1\u201310 microscans. Mass spectra were deconvolved using UniDec^48.\n\n### Kinetic enzyme assays\n\nFor the CS kinetic assays, the colorimetric quantification of thiol groups was\nused based on 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)^49,50. The\nphotospectrometric reactions were carried out in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl,\n0.1 mg ml^\u20131 DTNB and 25 nM protein concentration at 25 \u00b0C. To measure K_m\nvalues, one substrate was saturated and added to the reaction mix (1 mM\noxaloacetate or 0.5 mM acetyl-CoA). The other substrate was varied in\nconcentration and added last to start the reaction. For kinetic measurements\nat non-saturating substrate concentrations, the protein was diluted only\nimmediately before the reaction start to prevent the disassembly of complexes\nand added last to the reaction mix. Reaction progress was followed by\nmeasuring the appearance of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate at 412 nm (extinction\ncoefficient of 14.150 M^\u22121 cm^\u22121) in a plate reader (Infinite M Nano+, Tecan)\nusing Tecan i-control (v.3.9.1). Data analysis and determination of\nMichaelis\u2013Menten kinetic parameters was done using GraphPad Prism (v.8.4.3).\nFor the kinetic assays with the cys4 variant, the protein was dialysed in a\nbuffer with a glutathione redox system to induce the formation of disulfide\nbonds of the cysteine residues (50 mM Na_2HPO_4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM glutathione\nand 0.5 mM glutathione disulfide, pH 8). After overnight dialysis, part of the\nprotein sample was used for kinetic assays. The remainder was reduced by\nincubation with 10 mM dithiothreitol for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C and again used for\nkinetic assays. To exclude additional effects by the treatment itself, the WT\nSeCS was handled accordingly (dialysis in redox buffer and reduction with\ndithiothreitol) and measured kinetically for comparison.\n\n### Box counting\n\nTo quantify fractal scaling, we used a fixed grid scan. The images of the\nclass averages of the 18mer and 54mer assemblies were overlaid with a non-\noverlapping regular grid (Adobe Illustrator, v.24.0.2). The squares that were\nneeded to fill out the structure were manually counted. This process was\nrepeated for nine different box sizes of the grid (85\u201317 px). The entire\nprocedure was replicated for three separate grid orientations for both\nassemblies. Linear regression was performed using GraphPad Prism (v.8.4.3).\n\n### Cultivation of S. elongatus and sample preparation for metabolomics\nanalysis\n\nS. elongatus PCC 7942 was genetically modified to harbour variants of CS by\nhomologous recombination as previously described^51. The standard vector\npSyn_6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as the backbone. A homology\ncassette was constructed by amplification and extraction of the CS gene and\n1,000 bp of the neighbouring homologous regions by PCR from genomic DNA of WT\nS. elongatus PCC 7942. These were introduced into the pSyn_6 vector that\nincluded a spectinomycin-resistance gene to select for transformants. The\nrespective sequence changes of the CS were introduced into this vector (L18Q)\nto create the corresponding homology cassette. The constructed homology\ncassettes (WT, L18Q) were transformed into WT S. elongatus PCC 7942 and plated\non BG11 plates with 10 \u03bcg ml^\u20131 spectinomycin for selection. Transformants\nwere re-streaked on fresh BG11 plates with spectinomycin, and resulting\ncolonies were analysed for successful integration through the extraction of\ngenomic DNA. All strains were verified by PCR amplification of the introduced\ncassette (primers were designed to bind outside the introduced DNA region) and\nSanger sequencing. All sequences of the homology cassettes are presented in\nSupplementary Table 3.\n\nS. elongatus PCC 7942 cultures and genetically modified strains were grown in\nBG11 medium at 30 \u00b0C, 100 r.p.m., ambient CO_2 levels and alternating light\nconditions: 12 h of light (photon flux of 120 \u03bcmol m^\u22122 s^\u22121) and 12 h of\ndarkness. Before the growth experiment, precultures were entrained for 5 days\nin the circadian conditions to synchronize cells. Then 3 main cultures (50 ml)\nwere set up from 3 independent precultures and inoculated to an OD_750 of\n0.025 or 0.05. Samples for metabolomics analysis were cultivated in specific\nflasks to facilitate the isolation of culture solution through a syringe\nvalve, which led to slower growth behaviour compared with the standard flasks.\nThe samples were taken at 6 different time points (days 3, 5 and 7) after a\nlight and a dark period.\n\nFor recovery experiments under nitrogen deficiency, S. elongatus strains were\ngrown in BG11 medium at full light to an OD_750of 0.5 in triplicate. The cells\nwere then shifted to medium without a nitrogen source. To do this, the cells\nwere washed twice with BG11 without nitrate and then continuously cultivated\nin BG11 without nitrogen. The cells underwent chlorosis and fully bleached in\nthe subsequent days. After 14 and 20 days, a serial dilution of the respective\ncultures was spotted on BG11 agar plates and incubated for 7 further days for\nrecovery.\n\n### Sample preparation for metabolomics analysis\n\nThe culture volume (1 ml) was taken from the shaking flask through a syringe\nand immediately quenched in 1 ml 70 % methanol that was precooled in a \u221280 \u00b0C\nfreezer. The sample was mixed and centrifuged (10 min, \u221210 \u00b0C, 13,000g). The\nsupernatant was removed and the pellet was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the\nendometabolome was extracted. At each time point, the cell number and size\nwere measured for each culture using a Coulter counter (Multisizer 4e, Beckman\nCoulter). The respective biovolume for each cell pellet was then calculated\nand used to infer a normalized amount of extraction fluid for each sample\n(extraction fluid = 20,00 \u00d7 biovolume). All steps of the metabolome extraction\nwere performed on ice and with precooled (\u221220 \u00b0C) reagents. To extract the\nmetabolites, the calculated amount of extraction fluid (50% (v/v) methanol,\n50% (v/v) TE buffer pH 7.0) was added to the cell pellets together with the\nsame amount of chloroform. The samples were vortexed and incubated for 2 h at\n4 \u00b0C while shaking. The phases were then separated by centrifugation (10 min,\n\u221210 \u00b0C, 13,000g). The upper phase was extracted with a syringe and the same\namount of chloroform added again. After mixing, the sample was centrifuged\nagain (10 min, \u221210 \u00b0C, 13,000g) to get remove residual cell fragments and\npigments. The upper phase was isolated, added to LC\u2013MS vials and stored at \u221220\n\u00b0C until analysis.\n\n### Quantification of intracellular metabolites from S. elongatus by LC\u2013MS/MS\n\nQuantitative determination of acetyl-CoA and citrate was performed using\nLC\u2013MS/MS. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent Infinity\nII 1290 HPLC system (Agilent) using a Kinetex EVO C18 column (150 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 3\n\u03bcm particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size, Phenomenex) connected to a guard column of\nsimilar specificity (20 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 3 \u03bcm particle size, Phenomoenex). For\nacetyl-CoA, a constant flow rate of 0.25 ml min^\u20131 with mobile phase A being\n50 mM ammonium acetate in water at a pH of 8.1 and phase B being 100% methanol\nat 25 \u00b0C was used. The injection volume was 1 \u03bcl. The mobile phase profile\nconsisted of the following steps and linear gradients: 0\u20130.5 min constant at\n5% B; 0.5\u20136.5 min from 5 to 80% B; 6.5\u20137.5 min constant at 80% B; 7.5\u20137.6 min\nfrom 80 to 5% B; and 7.6 to 10 min constant at 5% B. An Agilent 6470 mass\nspectrometer (Agilent) was used in positive mode with an electrospray\nionization (ESI) source and the following conditions: ESI spray voltage of\n4,500 V; nozzle voltage of 1,500 V; sheath gas of 400 \u00b0C at 11 l min^\u20131;\nnebulizer pressure of 30 psi; and drying gas of 250 \u00b0C at 11 l min^\u20131. The\ntarget analyte was identified based on the two specific mass transitions\n(810.1 \u2192 428 and 810.1 \u2192 302.2) at a collision energy of 35 V and its\nretention time compared with standards.\n\nFor citrate, a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml min^\u20131 with mobile phase A being\n0.1% formic acid in water and phase B being 0.1% formic acid methanol at 25 \u00b0C\nwas used. The injection volume was 10 \u03bcl. The mobile phase profile consisted\nof the following steps and linear gradients: 0\u20135 min constant at 0% B; 5\u20136 min\nfrom 0 to 100% B; 6\u20138 min constant at 100% B; 8\u20138.1 min from 100 to 0% B; and\n8.1 to 12 min constant at 0% B. An Agilent 6495 ion funnel mass spectrometer\n(Agilent) was used in negative mode with an ESI source and the following\nconditions: ESI spray voltage of 2,000 V; nozzle voltage of 500 V; sheath gas\nof 260 \u00b0C at 10 l min^\u20131; nebulizer pressure of 35 psi; and drying gas of 100\n\u00b0C at 13 l min^\u20131. The target analyte was identified based on the two specific\nmass transitions (191 \u2192 111.1 and 191 \u2192 85.1) at a collision energy of 11 and\n14 V and its retention time compared with standards.\n\nChromatograms were integrated using MassHunter software (Agilent). Absolute\nconcentrations were calculated based on an external calibration curve prepared\nin sample matrix.\n\n### Negative-stain EM\n\nCarbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh) were hydrophilized by glow discharging\n(PELCO easiGlow, Ted Pella). Next, 5 \u03bcl of 450 nM protein suspensions were\napplied onto the hydrophilized grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate after\na short washing step with double-distilled H_2O. Samples were analysed using a\nJEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of\n120 kV. A 2k F214 FastScan CCD camera (TVIPS) was used for image acquisition.\nAlternatively, a JEOL JEM1400 TEM (operated at 80 kV) with a 4k TVIPS TemCam\nXF416 camera was used. For 2D class averaging, images were taken manually and\nprocessed with cisTEM^52. The following number of particles were averaged:\n1,491 particles for 18mers; 200 particles for 54mers; and 186 for 36mers. The\n36mer and 54mer particles were isolated from an extended dataset, in which we\nspecifically looked for larger assemblies. The exact percentage of complexes\nlarger than 18mers was difficult to estimate because of very strong\npreferential orientation. Most particles seemed to have landed not on the face\nof the triangle but on one of its edges or even one of its tips (Extended Data\nFig. 1). To obtain an estimate, another dataset of 150 micrographs without a\nbias towards larger assemblies was collected. All particles were manually\ncounted for these micrographs and included the assemblies that were laying on\ntheir edge and appeared as rectangles. By measuring the edge length, we could\nassign them to be either a 36mers (30 nm) or 54mers (40 nm). The analysis\nrevealed that under negative-stain TEM conditions (450 nM) approximately 92.8%\nof detected assemblies were identified as 18mers (1,773 particles), 3.5% as\n36mers (66 particles) and 3.8% as 54mers (72 particles). Our estimate of the\nabundance should still be taken with care and by comparison with our SAXS\ndata, which showed that large complexes only start being reasonably common\nabove 25 \u03bcM protein concentration. For the H369R variant of SeCS, a protein\nconcentration of 450 nM was used and 136 particles were averaged to produce\nthe 2D class average of the 18mer shown in Extended Data Fig. 6d.\n\n### Crystallography and structure determination\n\nCrystallization was performed using the sitting-drop method at 20 \u00b0C in 250 nl\ndrops (Crystal Gryphon, Art Robbins Instruments) consisting of equal parts of\nprotein and precipitation solutions (Swissci 3 Lens Crystallisation Plate).\nProtein solutions of 250 \u03bcM were incubated with 5 mM acetyl-CoA for 10 min at\nroom temperature to induce disassembly into hexamers. The crystallization\ncondition was 0.1 M citrate pH 5.5,and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate. Before data\ncollection, crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using a cryo-\nsolution that consisted of motherliquor supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol.\nData were collected under cryogenic conditions at P13, Deutsches Elektronen-\nSynchrotron. Data were processed using XDS and scaled with XSCALE^53. All\nstructures were determined by molecular replacement with PHASER^54, manually\nbuilt in WinCOOT (v.0.9.6)^55 and refined with PHENIX (v.1.19.2)^56. The\nsearch model for the structure was the hexameric \u03942\u20136 variant. Images of the\nstructure were generated using PyMOL (v.2.5.2).\n\n### Cryo-EM\n\nFor cryo-EM sample preparation, 4.5 \u03bcl of the protein sample (22.5 \u03bcM) was\napplied to glow-discharged Quantifoil 2/1 grids, blotted for 4 s with force 4\nin a Vitrobot Mark III (Thermo Fisher) at 100% humidity and 4 \u00b0C, and plunge\nfrozen in liquid ethane, cooled by liquid nitrogen. Cryo-EM data were acquired\nwith a FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) using\nSerialEM software^57. Movie frames were recorded at a nominal magnification of\n\u00d729,000 using a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). The total electron dose\nof about 55 electrons per \u00c5^2 was distributed over 30 frames at a pixel size\nof 1.09 \u00c5. Micrographs were recorded in a defocus range from \u22120.5 to \u22123.0 \u03bcm.\n\n### Image processing, classification and refinement\n\nFor the SeCS 18mer, all processing steps were carried out in cryoSPARC\n(v.3.2.0)^58. A total of 1,408 movies were aligned using the patch motion\ncorrection tool, and contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were\ndetermined using the patch CTF tool. An initial set of 10,173 particles were\nacquired through several rounds of blob picking, 2D classification and\ntemplate picking for training a Topaz convolutional neural network particle\npicking model^59. From all the corrected micrographs, 273,259 particles were\nextracted in a box size of 350 by 350 pixels at a pixel size of 1.09 \u00c5 using\nthe Topaz extract tool together with the trained model. Overall, 224,041\nparticles were selected for the ab initio reconstruction after removing poor\nparticles through 2D classification. The initial density map was then three-\ndimensionally (3D) classified and refined using the heterogenous refinement\ntool, which resulted in three classes. The dominant class (56.7% particles)\nwas subjected to another round of heterogenous refinement, which led to two\nclasses. A 3D non-uniform refinement of the main class (79.8% particles)\nimposing a C3 symmetry, followed by a local CTF refinement produced a final\nresolution of 3.93 \u00c5 (GSFSC = 0.143), which was used for model building. Local\nresolution of the density map was calculated with the local resolution\nestimation tool.\n\nFor the \u22062\u20136 sample, cryo-EM micrographs were processed on the fly using the\nFocus software package^60 if they passed the selection criteria (iciness <\n1.05, drift 0.4 \u00c5 < x < 70 \u00c5, defocus 0.5 \u03bcm < x < 5.5 \u03bcm, estimated CTF\nresolution < 6 \u00c5). Micrograph frames were aligned using MotionCor2 (ref. ^61)\nand the CTF for aligned frames was determined using GCTF^62. From 5,419\nacquired micrographs 1,687,951 particles were picked using the Phosaurus\nneural network architecture from crYOLO^63. Particles were extracted with a\npixel box size of 256 scaled down to 96 using RELION (v.3.1)^64 and underwent\nseveral rounds of reference-free 2D classification. Overall, 1,271,457\nselected particles (\u22062\u20136) were re-extracted with a box size of 256 and\nimported into Cryosparc (v.2.3)^58. For each sample, ab initio models were\ngenerated and passed through heterogeneous classification and refinement.\nSelected particles were re-imported to RELION and underwent several rounds of\nrefinement, CTF-refinement (estimation of anisotropic magnification, fit of\nper-micrograph defocus and astigmatism and beamtilt estimation) and Bayesian\npolishing^65. Final C1 refinement produced models with an estimated resolution\nof 3.1 \u00c5 for \u22062\u20136 (gold standard FSC analysis of two independent half-sets at\nthe 0.143 cut-off). Local resolution and 3D FSC plots were calculated using\nRELION and the \u201cRemote 3DFSC Processing Server\u201d web interface^66,\nrespectively.\n\nFor the H369R SeCS 54mer and 18mer, all processing steps were carried out in\ncryoSPARC (v.4.4.0). In total, 29,126 movies were aligned using the patch\nmotion correction tool, and CTF parameters were determined using the patch CTF\ntool. Next, 8,583 micrographs of estimated CTF fit \u2264 3.5 \u00c5 were selected for\nsubsequent analysis. A Topaz particle picking model was generated by running\nseveral rounds of Topaz train and Topaz extract from an initial set of 150\nmanually picked particles. A total of 95,268 particles were picked using the\ntrained model and extracted in a box size of 1,200 by 1,200 pixels at a pixel\nsize of 0.79 \u00c5. The particles were downsampled to a pixel size of 1.58 \u00c5\nbefore 2D classification. 2D classes corresponded to the SeCS 54mer were\nselected to reconstruct two densities map using the ab initio reconstruction\ntool. All the extracted particles were re-aligned and 3D classified by running\nthe heterogenous refinement tool using the density map corresponded to an\nintact 54mer as a reference. The 3D class (18.0% particles) was further\nrefined by non-uniform refinement, which resulted in a final resolution of\n5.91 \u00c5 (GSFSC = 0.143), which was used for model building. To reconstruct the\nmutant 18mer, 899,109 particles were picked using a 2D class corresponding to\nthe 18mer as a template and extracted in a box size of 500 by 500 pixels at a\npixel size of 0.79 \u00c5. A total of 552,353 particles were selected from 2D\nclassification to generate 3 initial maps. The major class was 3D classified\nand aligned, followed by a non-uniform refinement to produce the final 18mer\ndensity at 3.34 \u00c5 (GSFSC = 0.143). Local resolution of the density map was\ncalculated with the local resolution estimation tool, and preferred\norientation was assessed using the orientation diagnostics tool.\n\nFor 18meric SeCS, initial models were generated separately from their protein\nsequences using alphaFold^67 and then fitted as rigid bodies into the density\nusing UCSF Chimera. The model was manually rebuilt using WinCoot (v.0.9.6)^55.\nNon-crystallographic symmetry constraints were manually defined in PHENIX\n(v.1.19.2)^56 so that each monomer within one hexamer is linked to the two\ncorresponding monomers in the other two hexamers (corresponding to a C3\nsymmetric refinement of the 18mer). For the \u03942\u20136 hexamer, a hexameric subunit\nwas extracted from the 18mer model as a starting model for refinement. The\nmodel was firstly rigid-body fitted into the density, and manually refined in\nWinCoot (v.0.9.6)^55. Both models were subjected to real-space refinements\nagainst the respective density maps using phenix.real_space_refine implemented\nin PHENIX (v.1.19.2)^56. Images of the structures were generated using PyMOL\n(v.2.5.2). For the 54mer structure of SeCS H369R, we used the dimers extracted\nfrom the WT 18mer structure as our starting model and fitted them as rigid\nbodies into the density using UCSF Chimera. We then truncated all side chains\nusing pdbtools within PHENIX (v.1.19.2)^56. The structure was then subjected\nto one round of real space refinement using default parameters in PHENIX. For\nthe 18mer structure of SeCS H369R, we also used the 18mer SeCS structure as\nthe starting model. Individual dimers were first fitted as rigid bodies into\nthe density using UCSF Chimera. We then subjected the structure to one round\nof flexible fitting with default parameters, followed by refinement with\ndefault parameters using the Namdinator server^68. The model was then manually\nrebuilt in WinCoot (v.0.9.6)^55. In this model, we truncated the substrate\nlids (residues 220\u2013312, which are not part of the fractal interface) in all\nchains owing to poorly resolved density in our map, which made it difficult\nnot to introduce register errors during refinement.\n\n### SAXS data collection and analysis\n\nSAXS experiments were carried out at the BM29 beamline at the ESRF^69 using a\nPILATUS3X 2M photon counting detector (DECTRIS) at a fixed distance of 2,827\nm. Protein samples were prepared in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 and 200 mM\nNaCl as a dilution series. Buffer matching was achieved by dialysis and all\nmeasurements were carried out at 20 \u00b0C. The sample delivery and measurements\nwere performed using a 1 mm diameter quartz capillary, which is part of the\nBioSAXS automated sample changer unit (Arinax). Before and after each sample\nmeasurement, the corresponding buffer was measured and averaged. A total of\nten frames (one frame per second) were taken for each sample. All experiments\nwere conducted with the following parameters: beam current of 200 mA; flux of\n2.6 \u00d7 1,012 photons s^\u20131 at sample position; wavelength of 1 \u00c5; and estimated\nbeam size of 200 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm. Processing and analysis of collected SAXS data were\nperformed using Sc\u00c5tter IV^70.The R_g was determined by Guinier approximation.\nPlotting of the SAXS profiles and Guinier regions used BioXTAS RAW^71.\n\n### Construction of atomic models of the 54mers using 18mers\n\nWe used the align, translate, and rotate commands within PyMOL (v.2.5.2) to\nmodel how a 54mer complex would assemble if the 4.0\u00b0 and 4.2\u00b0 dimer rotations\nand 60\u00b0 dihedral angle between dimers that are observed in the 18mer structure\nwere applied. The rotation was applied to the connecting dimers of the three\n18mer-subcomplexes that built the 54mer. To do this, copies of the hexamers\nthat constitute the 18mer were rotated by 120\u00b0, so as to overlay the corner\ndimers by edge dimers. Two 18mer copies were subsequently connected to the\nrotated corners by two steps of structural alignment, which placed the\nresidues that should form the third interface 210 \u00c5 from each other (Extended\nData Fig. 2g).\n\n### Calculation of R _g values\n\nCalculation of R_g values was done using gmx gyrate from the GROMACS 2022.2\nsimulation package^72 from the atomic models of the 6mer, 18mer and the 54mer.\n\n### Displacement vectors, rotational axes and dihedral angles of atomic models\n\nSymmetry axes were generated with AnAnaS^73, and rotation axes and angles were\ncalculated using PyMOL (v.2.5.2) and a compatible script. Displacement vectors\nwere drawn between C\u03b1 atoms of the aligned structures using the object\nargument and cgo-arrow. Dihedral angles between dimers across the fractal\ninterface were calculated in PyMOL (v.2.5.2). The centre of mass of both\ndimers, as well as of one monomer from each dimer, was first calculated with\nthe com command. The dihedral angle was then calculated using get_dihedral\nalong the axis defined by the two centres of mass of the dimers.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAtomic structures reported in this paper have been deposited into the Protein\nData Bank under accession codes 8AN1, 8BP7, 8BEI, 8RJK and 8RJL.

The size exclusion chromatography runs were\nperformed three independent times for both samples with similar results. Inlay\nshows a SDS-PAGE gel of the purified WT SeCS (Uncropped image in Supplementary\nFig. 1a). (b) 2D class averages from negative stain electron microscopy of a\n6mer SeCS variant (SeCS L18Q, s. Fig. 5d) which yielded different particle\norientations but no top views. (c) 2D class averages from negative stain\nelectron microscopy of the 18mer SeCS complexes. Strong preferential\norientation towards side views, where the complex lays on the edge or tip of\nthe triangle. Compare also cryo-EM 2D class averages supplementary Fig. 3.\n(d-f) Detail from example micrographs from negative stain electron microscopy.\nFor the depicted structures we observed for the 18mer = 1491 particles, 54mer\n= 200 particles and the 36mer = 186 particles. Symbols (star, triangle, arrow)\nindicate the respective complex and orientation in the overview micrograph\n(f). (g) Additional assemblies that were observed only 2\u20134 times from a total\nof 20 micrographs (4096\u00d74096 pixels). The largest shown assembly was observed\nonly a single time but we created a model based on hexameric subcomplexes, see\nbelow the micrograph. Subunits colored in grey rely on a three-way junction of\ndimers and subunits colored in green rely on a two-way junction. For 18mers\nand 54mers all connections are two-way junctions. The central connection of\n36mers is in contrast a three-way junction.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Interface residues of the 18mer and construction of\n54mers.\n\n(a) Close-up of the 18mer cryo-EM density at the interface that connects\nhexamers with key residues annotated. (b) MP measurements of variants of SeCS.\n(c) Addition of a hexamer to the edge of an 18mer via the interface residues\nthat do not participate in the fractal connection (dark-red dimer from hexamer\nbinding to a blue dimer from 18mer). The angle of this interaction would force\nthe added hexamer out of the plane of the 18mer. The interaction would also\nintroduce steric clashes with the salmon-colored dimer of the 18mer. (d)\nSchematic depiction of different interactions of the hexameric subcomplexes\nwithin subsequent levels of Sierpi\u0144ksi triangles. Addition of a hexamer to the\nedge (e) or central void (f) of an 54mer connecting to the interface residues\nthat do not participate in the fractal connection via the same interaction\nthat is observed between 18mers. In both cases the added hexamer tilts out of\nthe plane of the 54mer and introduces steric clashes with a dimer within the\n54mer. (g) Formation of 54mer from the 18mer structures. The 18mer is a flat,\nclosed triangle because of the internal rotation introduced by the interface\nof the connecting subunits. If the corner dimers of the 18mers are rotated by\nthe same 4\u00b0 rotation when forming a 54mer the angle between 18mer subcomplexes\nis too large and does not form planar, closed triangles. Our empirical density\nof the closed 54mer is shown in comparison.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 36mer complexes are not stabilized via an additional\nC3 interface.\n\n(a) Pascal\u2019s triangle-like 36mer complexes contain a three-fold connection in\ntheir center that is not observed in fractal-like 18mers and 54mers. From the\n18mer structure a three-way interaction via the observed interface is not\npossible as it passivates the subunits. Therefore, either only two subunits\ncan connect in the center (I), no subunits interact (II) or there is a\ndistinct C3-interface that allows for a threefold interaction (III). (b) The\nmutation D147A destabilizes the interface connecting three dimers to a\nhexamer, that forms the building block of all larger oligomers. The interface\nthat induces fractal assembly is unchanged and allows for formation of 4mers.\nIn case of an additional distinct C3-interface, the formation of stable 6mers\nis expected. (c) Mass photometry measurements of the D147A variant reveal\ndimers and the disruption of the hexamer interface. (d) Native mass\nspectrometry of D147A SeCS at high protein concentration (20 \u03bcM). (e) The\ndistribution of oligomers determined from (d) revealed a strong preference for\nthe formation of 4mers. A low abundance of 6mers renders an additional\ndistinct C3-interface as unlikely or at least much less stable. Larger\noligomers arise probably due to an incomplete disruption of the hexamer\nsubcomplex interface. Cartoons indicate potential structures that correspond\nto the larger observed oligomers. (f) MP measurement of an additional variant\nin which the fractal interface was also disrupted (SeCS D147A + L18Q). This\nvariant showed to form only dimers at nanomolar concentrations using MP. (g)\nNative mass spectrometry of D147A + L18Q SeCS at high protein concentration\n(35 \u03bcM). (h) The distribution of oligomers determined from (g) revealed the\nformation of mostly dimers and hexamers. (i) The formation of hexamers in the\nvariant D147A + L18Q SeCS additionally supports that the hexamer interface was\nnot completely destroyed by the mutant D147A and that the larger oligomers (\u2265\n8mer, d + e) are formed because of residual affinity in the hexamer interface,\nnot because of an additional C3 interface.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Interface occupancy in fractal and non-fractal\nassemblies.\n\n(a) Assembly into Sierpi\u0144ski-triangle complexes from hexameric subcomplexes\nalways results in only three unsatisfied dimers at the corners of the\ntriangle. When assembled into other complexes e.g. the 36mers or larger forms\nof lattice-like triangles at least 4 or more dimers stay unsatisfied. * The\nactive but unsatisfied interfaces in the inner part of the represented\nstructures can be located at different positions, similar to a resonance\nstructure. Depicted is one possibility. (b) Schematic depiction of a fractal\npattern that can be assembled from 36mers.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Enzyme kinetics of SeCS and its variants.\n\n(a) Michaelis-Menten kinetics of SeCS and the hexameric L18Q variant. Data\npresented as mean values, error bars = SD, n = 3 biological replicates with 3\ntechnical replicates each. (b) Schematic depiction of the cys4-variant of\nSeCS, which stabilizes 18mer-complexes by a reversible disulfide bridge in the\nfractal interface and prevents the disassembly at high substrate\nconcentration. MP measurements of SeCS and the cys4-variant under oxidizing\nand reducing conditions, with and without oxaloacetate (oxAc). (c) Michaelis-\nMenten kinetics of SeCS and cys4-variant after oxidation and subsequent\nreduction. Data presented as mean values, error bars = SD, n = 3 biological\nreplicates with 3 technical replicates each.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 Structural changes in the citrate-bound SeCS,\nstructural integrity of the H369R variant, and intracellular CS metabolite\nconcentrations.\n\n(a) Molecular model of hexameric SeCS bound to citrate, solved by X-ray\ncrystallography to a resolution of 2.7 \u00c5. Zoom displays the density of a\ncitrate-molecule inside the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme. (b)\nAlignment of the citrate-bound structure with a hexameric subcomplex from the\n18mer structure. Arrows depict the molecular displacement from the 18mer to\nthe citrate-bound structure, which can be described by a 9\u00b0 rotation around an\ninternal axis within the dimer-subcomplexes (black axis). The symmetry axes of\nthe dimer-interfaces are shown as dotted lines for reference. (c) Comparison\nof the conformational changes between \u03942-6 SeCS (representing the typical open\nform of CS structures^24), citrate-bound SeCS (representing the closed form of\nCS) and the fractal form of 18meric SeCS. (d) Negative stain 2D class average\nof the 18mer formed by H369R SeCS at 450 nM. (e) Detail of a negative stain\nmicrograph showing a 54mer formed by H369R SeCS at 450 nM. We collected 196\nmicrographs (2048\u00d72048 pixel) in total. (f) Close up on the interaction\nbetween R369 and E6 in the 18mer structure H369R SeCS. (g) Cryo-EM density of\nan 18mer from the H369R SeCS variant resolved to 3.5 \u00c5. (h) Growth curve of S.\nelongatus PCC 7942 cultivated under circadian cycles (12 h light and 12 h\ndarkness). Grey columns indicate the growth phases, in which samples were\ntaken for metabolomic analysis. Cultures were set up in three biological\nreplicates, data are presented as mean values and error bars indicate SD. (i)\nIntracellular concentration of metabolites in S. elongatus grown under\ncircadian conditions. Samples were taken at the end of a full dark or light\ncycle, respectively. Oxaloacetate concentrations could not be measured due to\nlow abundance and stability but are thought to be extremely low^75. The\nconcentration values that induce the disassembly of 18mers are taken from the\ntitrations in Fig. 4a. Data are presented as mean values, error bars indicate\nSD from three biological replicates.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 7 Oligomeric state of extant cyanobacterial CSs and\nancestral CSs.\n\n(a) MP measurements of purified CS from extant cyanobacteria. Assembly into\nfractal 18mers was only detected in the CS of P. mougeotii. The CS from\nCyanobium sp. PCC7001, which belongs to the immediate sister-group of S.\nelongatus formed only dimers. The fractal assembly was therefore lost in this\nlineage. (b) R_g measurements for ancA-C at varying protein concentrations\nbased on SAXS measurements. One sample for each concentration step was\nmeasured over 10 frames. The data presented is the inferred R_g value using\nGuinier approximation and error bars correspond to the standard deviation of\nfit values calculated from the covariance matrix (Sc\u00c5tter IV). Dashed lines\nindicate R_gs calculated from structural models of the 6mer, 18mer, and 54mer.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 8 Alternative reconstructions of the ancestral proteins\nand emergence of fractal assembly.\n\n(a) MP measurements of purified alternative ancestral proteins (altall = all\nposition changed to the second most likely amino acid, if PP > 0.2). (b)\nPosterior probability for the position 18 of ancA-B. The initial\nreconstruction was very ambiguous about this state reconstructing Q or L with\nsimilar probabilities. The alternative ancestors therefore contained a Q at\nposition 18. The sequence from P. hollandica was added as sister to S.\nelongatus and the Cyanobium-/Prochloroccous group to the phylogeny, which is\nwell established in cyanobacterial species trees (see methods). Subsequent\nancestral sequence reconstruction with the modified alignment shifted the\nprobability strongly towards leucine at position 18. Indicated on the tree are\nthe losses of fractal assembly on two branches, which were observed from the\nassembly state of extant CS from P. hollandica and Cyanobium (c) MP\nmeasurement of the purified CS from P. hollandica. (d) We adjusted the altall\nsequences of ancA-B to include q18L corresponding to the reconstruction\nincluding P. hollandica. MP measurements of purified modified altall ancA-ancB\nshowed assembly into 18mers supported the inference of ancestral assembly\nstates of ancA-B. (e) MP measurements of ancA and SeCS with a reversal to\nL18q, which prevents assembly into 18mers. (f) Alignment of the inferred amino\nacid sequences of the ancestral proteins ancA-E and SeCS. Interface residues\nE6 and H369 are colored in blue and historical changes that were found to have\nhad an influence on the assembly into fractals are colored in red (residues 8,\n18, 80). (g) Histograms that display the distribution of the posterior\nprobabilities of the maximum a posterior state across reconstructed sites for\nall five ancestral proteins. (h) R_g measurements ancC q18L at varying protein\nconcentrations based on SAXS measurements. One sample for each concentration\nstep was measured over 10 frames. The data presented is the inferred R_g value\nusing Guinier approximation and error bars correspond to the standard\ndeviation of fit values calculated from the covariance matrix (Sc\u00c5tter IV).\nDashed lines indicate R_gs calculated from structural models of the 6mer,\n18mer, and 54mer. (i) Close-up of cryo-EM density of SeCS with key\nsubstitution L18 annotated. (j) MP measurements of ancC-E variants with the\nq18L substitution. The substitution only triggers the formation of 18mers when\nintroduced into ancC. Close-up of cryo-EM density of SeCS with key\nsubstitutions R8 (k) and F80 (l) annotated. (m) MP measurements of SeCS\nvariants in which the identified important historical substitutions between\nancB and ancA were reversed (F80y, R8k).
