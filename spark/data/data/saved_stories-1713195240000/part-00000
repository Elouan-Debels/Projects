Forecasters from the US Space Force predict\n\"excellent\" weather for the primetime launch.\n\nFalcon 9 will blaze a familiar trail into space, following the same profile as\ndozens of past Starlink missions.\n\nThe rocket's first-stage booster will shut off its nine kerosene-fueled Merlin\nengines about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight, reaching a top speed of\nmore than 5,000 mph (8,000 km per hour). The first stage will detach from the\nFalcon 9's upper stage, which will continue firing into orbit. The 15-story-\ntall Falcon 9 booster, meanwhile, will follow an arcing trajectory before\nbraking for a vertical landing on a drone ship floating in the Atlantic Ocean\nnear the Bahamas.\n\nThe 23 flat-packed Starlink spacecraft will deploy from the upper stage a\nlittle more than an hour after liftoff, bringing the total number of Starlinks\nin low-Earth orbit to more than 5,800 spacecraft.\n\n## A hunger for launch\n\nPretty much every day, SpaceX is either launching a rocket or rolling one out\nof the hangar to the launch pad. At this pace, SpaceX is redefining what is\nroutine in the space industry, but the rapid-fire launch rate also means the\ncompany is continually breaking records, mostly its own.\n\nFriday night's launch will break another one of those records. This first-\nstage booster, designated by the tail number B1062, has flown 19 times since\nits first flight in November 2020. The booster will now be the first in\nSpaceX's inventory to go for a 20th flight, breaking a tie with three other\nrockets as the company's fleet leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen SpaceX debuted the latest version of its Falcon 9 rocket, the Falcon 9\nBlock 5, officials said the reusable first stage could fly 10 times with\nminimal refurbishment and perhaps additional flights with a more extensive\noverhaul. Now, SpaceX is certifying Falcon 9 boosters for 40 flights.\n\nThis particular rocket has not undergone any extended maintenance or long-term\ngrounding. It has flown an average of once every two months since debuting\nthree-and-a-half years ago. So the 20-flight milestone SpaceX will achieve\nFriday night means this rocket has doubled its original design life and, at\nthe same time, has reached the halfway point of its extended service life.\n\nIn its career, this booster has launched eight people and 530 spacecraft,\nmostly Starlinks. The rocket's first two flights launched GPS navigation\nsatellites for the US military, then it launched two commercial human\nspaceflight missions with Dragon crew capsules. These were the all-private\nInspiration4 mission and Axiom Mission 1, the first fully commercial crew\nflight to the International Space Station.\n\nEnlarge / A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off Sunday, April 7, on the Bandwagon\n1 rideshare mission.\n\nSpaceX\n\nRemarkably, this will be the sixth Falcon 9 launch in less than eight days,\nmore flights than SpaceX's main US rival, United Launch Alliance, has launched\nin 17 months.\n\nIt will be the 38th Falcon 9 launch of the year and the 111th flight of a\nFalcon 9 or Falcon Heavy rocket\u2014the 114th launch by SpaceX overall\u2014in the last\n365 days. More than a third of SpaceX's Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy missions, a\nnumber that will stand at 332 after Friday night's flight, have launched in\nthe past year.\n\nThis month, for the first time, SpaceX demonstrated it could launch two Falcon\n9 rockets in less than five days from the company's launch pad at Vandenberg\nSpace Force Base, California. SpaceX has also cut the turnaround time between\nFalcon 9 rockets at Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The\ncompany's most-used launch pad, SLC-40, can handle two Falcon 9 flights in\nless than four days.\n\nIt's not just launch pad turnaround. SpaceX uses its drone ships\u2014two based in\nFlorida and one in California\u2014for most Falcon 9 landings. In order to meet the\nappetite for Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX is getting rockets back to port and re-\ndeploying drone ships back to sea at a faster rate.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n109\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
