The work shows how various contaminants, including per- and\npolyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and organochlorine compounds, find their way\ninto the seabirds\u2019 fatty and protein-rich tissues.\n\nSource: \u00a9 Cindy Kassab/Getty Images\n\nKing penguins were found to have a range of different PFAS pollutants in their\nblood\n\nHalogenated chemical pollutants are a global problem, found almost everywhere\n\u2013 in soil, rainwater, rivers and tap water. Because these compounds are\ndifficult to break down, they persist in the environment and can bioaccumulate\nin food chains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, a team led by Alice Carravieri from the University of La Rochelle,\nFrance, has analysed the levels of organohalogens in blood samples taken from\nking penguins in the Crozet Islands in the southern Indian Ocean.\nSpecifically, the team took samples from penguins that were fasting during\ntheir moulting and breeding periods. By monitoring changes in the\nconcentrations of the contaminants, the researchers could gain insight into\nhow the different compounds are mobilised while different tissues are\nmetabolised.\n\nOver 25-day fasting periods, the researchers noted that the total\nconcentration of pollutants in the penguins\u2019 blood plasma doubled. This is\nbecause the contaminants are released into the bloodstream when fatty and\nprotein-rich tissues in which they accumulate are burned for energy.\n\nOf the 36 compounds that the researchers searched for, 26 were detected in\npenguins\u2019 blood. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was by far the most\nprominent contaminant, accounting for 60% of the total pollutant\nconcentration. While compounds like PFOS and hexachlorobenzene were shown to\nincrease in the blood plasma of both breeding and moulting penguins, levels of\nperfluoroundecanoate and perfluorotridecanoate decreased in the blood of\nmoulting penguins. The researchers suggest that a significant amount of these\npollutants are incorporated into the penguins\u2019 feathers.\n\nThe researchers also note that the mobilisation of PFOS and long-chain\nperfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids is a cause for concern, as these compounds are\nhighly toxic and can be transported to sensitive tissues including eggs and\nthe brain. They say that further research is urgently needed to monitor the\nimpacts of these compounds on the physiology and fitness of seabirds,\nparticularly during prolonged periods of fasting.\n\n### References\n\nM Mollier et al, Environ.
