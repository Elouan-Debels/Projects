If you\nwant to accelerate your career advancement, then you need to go \u00bbbeyond the\ncode\u00ab. That's what my book, Beyond the Code, is designed to help you do.\n\nDetermine Your Destination\n\nTo begin, let\u2019s start our journey to become a highly successful software\nengineer by considering a familiar but powerful analogy. Imagine that it\u2019s\nyour birthday and you\u2019ve received the best present ever: a brand new airplane!\nIt\u2019s a big, magnificent plane with a living room, a bedroom, and a separate\nkitchen. In fact, it\u2019s big enough that you can bring your family, friends, and\neven your household pets.\n\nMost likely you are imagining a place right now that you\u2019ve always wanted to\ngo visit. A faraway place you have pictured to yourself time and time again. A\nplace that you just can\u2019t wait to see and experience. Chances are you have\nbeen dreaming and fantasizing about that certain place for a long time. Can\nyou feel and sense the excitement you\u2019ll feel when you finally arrive at your\ndestination?\n\nDo you have a specific place in mind? Great! Envisioning and picturing this\nspecial place shows that you have the ability to visualize and determine your\ndestination. So, what would you do next? Most likely you wouldn\u2019t waste a\nminute and would let the captain know exactly where you want to go, right?\n\nOh, I forgot to mention, the captain is part of the package, too. This is a\nspecial captain, one you have not encountered on any commercial airplane. The\ncaptain is \u00bbYOUR\u00ab captain, available and ready whenever you want to fly\nsomeplace new.\n\nYour captain never needs to rest and is standing by twenty-four hours a day,\nseven days a week. Whenever you want to fly, your captain is already waiting\nfor you in the cockpit warming up the engines. You can take off anytime, day\nor night, summer, spring, winter or fall. Wow!\n\nNow, let\u2019s come back to our defined destination \u2013 you still have that place in\nmind, right? For the purpose of this book let\u2019s pick Silicon Valley, a world-\nfamous hub for technology companies and home to some of the world\u2019s best\nsoftware engineers. With your destination in mind you might say: \u00bbCaptain, can\nyou please take me to San Francisco?\u00ab\n\nWith that simple statement, you would communicate clearly where you want to\ngo. It\u2019s not a vague description, but a clear and precise definition of the\ndestination.\n\nNow let me provoke a thought experiment and ask you a different question.\nWould you ever say something like the following to the captain of your new\nplane? \u00bbCaptain, let\u2019s take off right now and then let\u2019s just float in the air\ntill we have decided where to go. We\u2019ll simply cruise around in circles till\nwe have determined our destination. If we happen to run out of fuel, then so\nbe it, we crash, but that\u2019s totally fine with me.\u00ab\n\n>_\n\nclearly define who you want to become\n\nIt\u2019s fair to assume that no sane human being would ever want to run out of\nfuel and crash their brand new airplane.\n\nYet, quite often when software engineers come to my coaching sessions and I\nask them where they want to take their career, they initially cannot provide a\nprecise answer. Oftentimes I hear them say that they are not sure, that they\nwill just wait and see what happens. They don\u2019t know what their destination\nis!\n\n>_\n\nyou can become highly successful if you have a vision\n\nBut if you don\u2019t know where you want to take your career, then it is\nessentially the same as telling your inner captain to take off with the plane\nand then see what happens. It is like hoping that you\u2019ll figure out where you\nwant to go while already flying at cruising altitude. What I have realized as\nan engineer and manager is that truly successful software engineers know where\nthey want to go. That\u2019s one thing exceptional engineers have in common and\nthat sets them apart from all the others. They know that having a goal and a\nclear vision for their future is crucial for their success. They know that\nhaving a well-defined destination is like owning a mental map that enables\nthem to navigate even when the going gets tough.\n\nOnce you have clarity, then every decision you make from this point forward\nwill be aligned with your mission and bring you closer to your destination.\nYou won\u2019t take one step in the right direction and then another step in the\nopposite direction. Your inner captain, or inner compass if you will, will\nmake sure you get closer to your goal and will prevent you from getting lost\non the way.\n\n>_\n\nalign every single decision with your mission\n\nOf course, the weather won\u2019t always be sunny throughout your journey, there\nmight be rain and gusty winds. However, your inner captain can adjust to\nsituations while in the air and will prevent you from straying off course.\n\nOnce you have logged in the coordinates of where you want to go, that inner\ncaptain will take the fastest route possible and navigate directly to your\ndestination.\n\nPlease note: believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path\ndoes not mean you are completely certain about everything. Rather, it means\nthat you are generally heading in the right direction. That you don\u2019t\nconstantly change your mind every other day based on a new outside stimulus or\nwhat other people are doing.\n\nMaking adjustments on your way is natural and expected, but having a clear\ndestination enables you to ignore all the distractions on your journey.\n\nOnce you have clarity, you will feel energized, you will feel like you are in\nthe captain\u2019s seat and you will start to have greater control over your\njourney. In fact, having a well-defined goal allows you to bear pretty much\nanything along the way. Perhaps most importantly, once you know where you want\nto go, you can enjoy the flight. Making progress every day towards a goal you\nhave defined brings not just success but true happiness.\n\nThrough 12 highly effective, hands-on lessons, my book Beyond the Code is\nintended to help you accelerate your career advancement and become highly\nsuccessful as a software engineer.
