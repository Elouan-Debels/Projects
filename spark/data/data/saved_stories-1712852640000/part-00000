HP\ncontinued to sell it through 1999, an unusually long run for a 1990s computer\nmodel. In this blog post, we\u2019ll dig into this largely forgotten form factor\nand why it became such a quiet success.\n\n## What was a palmtop?\n\nThe HP 200LX palmtop ran MS-DOS, cramming the equivalent of a late 1980s Turbo\nXT into the palm of your hand. It quietly sold well and retains a following\neven today.\n\nPalmtops were an early take on mobile computing. Unlike the Apple Newton or\nPalm Pilot, palmtops squeezed a simple desktop computer into a format about\nthe size of a modern smartphone.\n\nYou unfolded the palmtop to reveal a monochrome LCD screen and a calculator-\nstyle miniature keyboard. It was like having an XT clone in the palm of your\nhand.\n\nAdmittedly, that wasn\u2019t a lot of power. But these weren\u2019t intended to be your\nprimary computer. The idea was you would carry the palmtop with you where even\na laptop might not be practical. It could run useful MS-DOS programs to let\nyou do simple computing tasks on the go, and then, when you got back to your\ndesk, you could exchange data with your full-size computer.\n\nThe first company to introduce a product in this category was, believe it or\nnot, Atari. It is easy to forget Atari had a PC clone business alongside its\ngame consoles, 8-bit home computers, and the ST series. Atari\u2019s palmtop, the\nPortfolio, reached the market in June 1989.\n\n### HP\u2019s DOS-based and Windows CE-based palmtops\n\nBut in the end, Hewlett-Packard, yes, the printer people, ended up being the\nmost prolific manufacturer of palmtops. They entered the market in 1991 with\nthe Model 95, followed up with the Model 100, and then issued the Model 200 in\n1994 before pivoting to Windows CE. The 95, 100, and 200 all ran MS-DOS and\nincluded DOS and some useful programs built into ROM.\n\nHP continued marketing palmtop computers until 2007. At that point, the\nBlackberry was providing most of what people would want to do with a palmtop,\nand of course, the modern smartphone as we know it today was emerging. HP\nwisely decided it was the end of the line.\n\nThe HP 200 LX quietly gathered a devoted following, and it maintained it,\nbeing the fastest DOS-based palmtop for those who liked the form factor and\ndidn\u2019t want to use Windows CE.\n\n## HP 100LX versus 200LX palmtops\n\nThe HP 95 used an NEC V20 CPU, a CPU that was showing its age in 1991, but\nstill adequate for running text-based DOS programs. The model 100 dusted off\nthe Intel 186 CPU, a processor that wasn\u2019t frequently used in PCs. But it was\nfine in this application, offering better performance while keeping very\nreasonable battery life.\n\nThe 200 iterated on the model 100. It was essentially the same hardware, but\nin addition to offering the option of more memory, is also included an\nadditional application built into ROM. That application, Quicken, was a very\npopular personal finance application at the time. Online banking largely made\nQuicken obsolete, but in the early 1990s, it was a perennial best seller.\n\nThe 200LX is really a throwback to a different era, with not one, but two\npowerhouse third party PC applications built in. Microsoft would soon control\nand define the PC ecosystem, so the model 200 is one of the last relics of the\nera when Microsoft had to share.\n\n### The HP 200LX\u2019s hidden superpower\n\nAnd if you were careful, the 200LX was really fast. If you bought one of the\nmodels that had at least 2 MB of RAM, you ended up with a 1.3 MB RAM disk.\nThat\u2019s almost as much space as a three and a half inch floppy disk, and enough\nspace to hold one useful program. But unlike a floppy disk, access to a RAM\ndisk is nearly instantaneous. Similar to a modern SSD, but 20 years earlier.\n\nWhile the 200LX may not have been the ideal platform to run the last versions\nof Word or Wordperfect for DOS, it would have run previous-generation word\nprocessors very well, while possibly leaving enough room left over in the RAM\ndisk for another text based program.\n\nToday, you can use a PCMCIA to compact flash adapter to put 32 MB of solid\nstate storage in a 200LX, and then you really do have the equivalent of a late\n80s turbo XT that fits in your pocket.\n\n## The HP200LX\u2019s quiet following\n\nI remember people showing off their Apple Newtons, Palm Pilots, and\nBlackberries in the 90s. I do not remember ever seeing someone showing off an\nHP palmtop.\n\nOne speculation I\u2019ve heard is that large companies bought them for their\nemployees in large quantities. That seems plausible. They did cost $800, but\nit was much less expensive to buy an employee a desktop PC and a palmtop then\nit was to buy a 1990s laptop. The $3,000 laptop my former coworker sent flying\noff the roof of his car was no fluke. Well, at least the price wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt was also a very different style of mobile computing. It was text and\nkeyboard based, rather than stylus-based in the case of the Palm Pilot or\nNewton, and if you read your email on it, you were reading email offline, not\nonline like a BlackBerry.\n\nThe HP 200LX wasn\u2019t a status symbol like the other mobile platforms. It was\npractical, not flashy. And it was quietly cutting edge. While the technology\nwas rather old at the time, the ability to shrink it down that small and run\nit off a pair of AA batteries certainly wasn\u2019t.\n\nI saw a Palm Pilot as a burden when my boss told me it was time for me to\nstart carrying one. I don\u2019t think I would have recoiled as much at an HP\npalmtop, partly because the thing actually worked.\n\nIf you found this post informative or helpful, please share it!\n\n  * share\n  * save\n  * share\n  * share\n  * share\n  * share\n  * pocket\n  * share\n  * email\n  * RSS feed\n\nDave Farquhar\n\nDavid Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.\nHe started his career as a part-time computer technician in 1994, worked his\nway up to system administrator by 1997, and has specialized in vulnerability\nmanagement since 2013.

I sort of feel like they are a\nkind of spiritual successor to the HP Palmtop form factor. I don\u2019t make GPD\nmoney so these aren\u2019t in the budget but the do look pretty cool and quite\ncompelling to those that could use such a thing.\n\nReply\n\n    * Dave FarquharPost author\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 8:37 pm\n\nPermalink\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of the GPD Pocket products but they sure do look like a modern\nversion of a palmtop! It goes to show that good ideas never die.\n\nReply\n\n  * Frank McConnell\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 4:43 pm\n\nPermalink\n\nAnd then someone named Mack figured out how to double the clock speed (and\nwrite some code to run at startup to fix the display timing to work with that)\nand add a 32MB RAM disk inside the 200LX. Not merely fast, but faster! And you\ncould still use the PCMCIA socket for flash storage (mine\u2019s a Sandisk 256MB).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t flashy, there wasn\u2019t much to show off, it was an XT-class PC with\nsome built-in applications that you could carry round and get stuff done\nanywhere. In a world of landlines, you might also carry a battery-powered\nmodem and cables so you could download your e-mail and upload your replies and\nwritings. In the data center, you might use it as a serial console for\nconfiguration or diagnosis.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
