This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 of 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 of 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices.

Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, about news reports that staff\nmembers from her agency had sent cables to the National Security Council that\nsaid famine had begun in parts of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cDo you think it is plausible or likely that parts of Gaza, and in particular\nnorthern Gaza, are already experiencing famine?\u201d Mr. Castro asked.\n\nMs. Power replied that that appeared to be the case, and cited an assessment\nby the global Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative, whose\nmethodology she described as sound. She did not specify what assessment she\nwas referring to. Last month the initiative said in a report that the food\nshortage in Gaza had become so severe that \u201cfamine is imminent\u201d for the\nnorthern part of the enclave, which has been all but cut off from relief\ndeliveries.\n\n\u201cThat is their assessment and we believe that assessment is credible,\u201d Ms.\nPower said.\n\n\u201cSo famine is already occurring there?\u201d Mr. Castro replied.\n\n\u201cThat is \u2014 yes,\u201d Ms. Power said.\n\nShe said later in her testimony that the rate of severe malnutrition among\nGazan children had become \u201cmarkedly worse\u201d since Oct. 7, when a Hamas-led\nterrorist attack prompted Israel to launch its military offensive in Gaza.\n\n\u201cIn northern Gaza, the rate of malnutrition prior to Oct. 7 was almost zero,\nand it is now almost one in three kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of actual severe\nmalnutrition for under-5s, that rate was 16 percent in January and became 30\npercent in February. We are waiting for the March numbers but we expect that\nto continue.\u201d\n\nMs. Power urged Congress to \u201cpress our Israeli partners to actually follow\nthrough with the commitments they have made\u201d to allow more humanitarian aid to\nenter the Gaza Strip.\n\nShe also said that the United States had seen no evidence from its partner\norganizations that Hamas was seizing food aid on a significant scale. Israel\nhas accused Hamas of stealing aid meant for Gazan civilians, a claim that\nHamas officials have denied.\n\nIn February, the U.S. special envoy for humanitarian issues in the Middle\nEast, David Satterfield, also said Israel had failed to provide evidence that\nHamas was stealing aid shipments.\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing Hamas dictating where food is provided,\u201d Ms. Power told\nCongress on Wednesday. \u201cI can assure you that if the government of Israel saw\nHamas doing that,\u201d she added, \u201cwe would be hearing about it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Liam Stack reporting from Jerusalem\n\n## Israel says it\u2019s still working on opening a border crossing for aid to\nnorthern Gaza.\n\nImage\n\nAid was unloaded at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza on\nSaturday.Credit...Mahmoud Issa/Reuters\n\nThere has been no apparent work done yet on increasing aid to Gaza by opening\nan additional border crossing from Israel and accepting shipments at a nearby\nIsraeli port, but Israel said on Wednesday that both changes remain in the\nworks.\n\nFacing international condemnation after an Israeli airstrike killed seven\nworkers for an international aid group, Israel said last week that it would\nreopen the Erez crossing between Israel and northern Gaza for aid delivery.\nBut satellite imagery taken on Tuesday showed that the road leading to Erez on\nthe Gaza side was blocked by rubble from a destroyed building, a crater and\nother damage that was also visible in images from last week and last month.\n\nA spokeswoman for the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Wednesday that\nanother crossing into northern Gaza, near Zikim, a kibbutz, would open\ninstead, and not the one near Erez. It was not clear if that was because of\nthe damage at Erez.\n\nISRAEL\n\nErez\n\ncrossing\n\nGAZA\n\nDamage\n\nRoad to\n\nGaza City\n\nErez\n\ncrossing\n\nGaza\n\nCity\n\nDamage\n\nDamage\n\nGAZA\n\nSTRIP\n\nRubble from\n\ndestroyed\n\nbuilding\n\nISRAEL\n\nErez\n\ncrossing\n\nGAZA\n\nDamage\n\nRoad to\n\nGaza City\n\nDamage\n\nDamage\n\nErez\n\ncrossing\n\nRubble from\n\ndestroyed\n\nbuilding\n\nGAZA\n\nSTRIP\n\nSatellite image from Maxar Technologies, April 5. Damage appeared to remain in\nmore recent imagery.\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nMr. Gallant told reporters that the government had approved a new border\ncrossing and the use of the port of Ashdod, around 20 miles northeast of Gaza,\nfor aid shipments, but he did not offer a time frame for either.\n\nThe United Nations says that a man-made famine is looming in Gaza, and many\nexperts say that conditions in northern Gaza \u2014 which has mostly been cut off\nfrom aid deliveries since early in the war \u2014 already meet the criteria for a\nfamine to be declared there. In that part of the territory, a few hundred\nthousand people are surviving on an average of 245 calories a day, according\nto Oxfam, an aid group.\n\nAid groups, the United Nations and a growing number of governments blame\nIsrael for restricting aid into Gaza. U.N. figures show that an average of\nabout 110 aid trucks have entered each day since Oct. 7. Though the daily\naverage has risen since February, it is still far lower than the 500 trucks of\ncommercial goods and aid that arrived in Gaza each day before the war.\n\nIsrael maintains that aid agencies have failed in their responsibility to\ndistribute the aid. The groups say Israel has not created safe conditions that\nwould allow them to distribute aid effectively.\n\nThe count of aid trucks Israel has allowed into Gaza recently has also been\nthe subject of contention, raising questions about how to gauge the results of\nanother pledge Israel made after the deadly airstrike against aid workers,\nwhich was to boost the number of trucks being screened at two existing\ncrossings into southern Gaza.\n\nIsrael says the number has spiked, with COGAT writing in a social media post\non Wednesday that an average of 400 trucks had entered per day over three\nrecent days. The agency also posted photographs of street vendors selling\ncucumbers, potatoes and juice with the caption \u201cmarket scenes in northern\nGaza.\u201d\n\nPeople in northern Gaza have said in interviews that the little food available\nin street markets has long been out of reach for most, with many items priced\nat several times their original cost.\n\nImage\n\nFree meals were distributed at the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip in\nMarch. The United Nations says that a man-made famine is looming in\nGaza.Credit...Mahmoud Essa/Associated Press\n\nBy contrast, U.N. data shows that a total of 533 aid trucks entered Gaza in\nthe three days after Saturday. More broadly, U.N. figures show no increase in\nthe daily average of trucks going into Gaza in the first week of April,\ncompared to the previous week.\n\nThe reasons for the discrepancy are not clear, but one is the differing\nmethods Israel and the United Nations use to track trucks, said Jens Laerke, a\nspokesman for the U.N. humanitarian office.\n\nTrucks screened \u2014 and counted \u2014 by Israel at the two working border crossings\nusually enter Gaza only half full, after Israeli inspectors prohibit some of\ntheir contents, said Mr. Laerke. Once inside Gaza, they are unloaded, repacked\nas full trucks and sent to warehouses operated by the United Nations, which\ncounts the number of full trucks that arrive, likely leading to a lower tally.\n\nOther complications also mean that trucks often don\u2019t pass through a crossing\nand arrive at a warehouse in the same day, meaning the daily counts at\ncrossings and the warehouses often do not match, he said.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, COGAT criticized the U.N.\u2019s \u201cflawed counting\nmethod,\u201d which it called \u201can attempt to conceal their logistical distribution\ndifficulties.\u201d\n\nPrevious Israeli promises to scale up aid have not greatly increased\ndeliveries. Under U.S. pressure in mid-December, Israel reopened one crossing\nto Gaza, Kerem Shalom, for aid trucks, committing to permit 200 trucks a day\nto enter. But aid agencies say that stringent Israeli inspections have kept\nthe numbers far lower than what is needed.\n\nAnd Mr. Laerke and other aid officials said enormous challenges remain to\ndistributing the aid inside Gaza, particularly to the north, where Israel has\ndenied access for UNRWA, the main U.N. relief agency working in the territory.\n\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting.\n\n\u2014 Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Vivian Yee and Lauren Leatherby\n\n## Biden says Israel has improved the aid flow to Gaza but must do more.\n\nImage\n\nPresident Biden said that Israel had done more to provide aid but that he\nexpected additional action.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nIsraeli authorities have improved aid delivery to Gaza but still \u201cneed to do\nmore,\u201d President Biden said on Wednesday, offering a measured assessment of\nhow well Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was living up to promises he made\nlast week.\n\nIn a call with Mr. Netanyahu last Thursday, Mr. Biden said that the United\nStates could withhold support for Israel over its conduct of the war against\nHamas, unless it did more to protect civilians and ensure adequate supplies\nfor Gaza. On Wednesday, he said he had been \u201cblunt and straightforward\u201d with\nthe Israeli leader.\n\nSince then, Mr. Biden said, Israel has done more to provide access for food,\nmedicine and other critical supplies, but he added that he still expected\nadditional action. Mr. Netanyahu committed to increasing the number of aid\ntrucks entering Gaza and to opening another border crossing into the\nterritory.\n\nThe president said Israel had done more to provide access in recent days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThey need to do more, and there\u2019s one more\nopening that has to take place in the north. So we\u2019ll see what he does in\nterms of meeting the commitments he made to me.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations says that the number of aid trucks entering Gaza has not\nchanged significantly from last week. Israel says the number of trucks\nreaching Gaza has increased sharply.\n\nStill, the president has left vague what kind of action he will take if Israel\ndoes not satisfy his demands. Speaking at a news conference in the Rose Garden\nalongside the visiting Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, Mr. Biden did\nnot respond to a question about whether he would explicitly make future U.S.\narms shipments to Israel dependent on how Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government responds.\n\nMr. Biden made a point of adding that Hamas should agree to a proposal offered\nover the weekend by the United States to release hostages it seized on Oct. 7\nin exchange for a six-week cease-fire and the release of hundreds of\nPalestinians held in Israeli prisons on terrorism and other charges. \u201cThey\nneed to move on the proposal that\u2019s been made,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nHe emphasized his commitment to winning the freedom of the more than 130\nhostages still being held, including a handful of American citizens. Vice\nPresident Kamala Harris met privately with family members of some of the\nhostages on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get these hostages home where they belong but also bring back a six\nweek cease-fire that we need now,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\n\u2014 Peter Baker Reporting from Washington\n\n## An Israeli strike kills 3 sons of the political leader of Hamas.\n\nImage\n\nAn Israeli strike on a vehicle killed the three sons of the political leader\nof Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh.Credit...Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nAn Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip killed three sons of Ismail Haniyeh,\nthe political leader of Hamas, both Mr. Haniyeh and the Israeli military said\non Wednesday. Hamas-affiliated media reported that three of his grandchildren\nwere also killed.\n\nThe Israeli military identified the three sons as Amir, Mohammad and Hazem\nHaniyeh, and said that all three were active in Hamas\u2019s military operations.\nIn a brief statement, the military said the strike took place in \u201ccentral\nGaza,\u201d but it was not more specific and did not address reports that Ismail\nHaniyeh\u2019s grandchildren were also killed.\n\nMr. Haniyeh did not specify his sons\u2019 roles in Hamas but called them martyrs,\nsaying in an statement on the group\u2019s official Telegram account that they had\nremained in the Gaza Strip while he headed Hamas\u2019s political bureau from\nexile.\n\nHamas\u2019s critics have accused the organization\u2019s leadership of living luxurious\nlifestyles abroad as the people in Gaza suffer under Israeli bombardment and\nincreasingly dire humanitarian conditions. But Mr. Haniyeh, who has long\nshuttled between Qatar and Turkey, likened his pain to that of all Gazans on\nWednesday and cast his loss in the broader context of Palestinian suffering.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political leader, in Beirut in 2021.Credit...Aziz\nTaher/Reuters\n\n\u201cAll our people and the families of Gaza residents have paid a heavy price\nwith the blood of their children, and I am one of them,\u201d he said in the\nstatement. He added that \u201cthe blood of my sons is not more precious\u201d than the\nblood of the estimated 32,000 people who Gazan health authorities say have\nbeen killed since the war began in October.\n\nMr. Haniyeh also expressed defiance, saying that the killings would not change\nthe positions held by Hamas, which has been negotiating with Israel through\ninternational mediators seeking to broker a cease-fire and secure the release\nof hostages held in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cWhat the enemy failed to extract through killing, destruction and\nannihilation he will not take in the negotiations,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Mr. Haniyeh said his sons were in a car, on\nthe way to visit family members in the Shati refugee community for Eid, when\nthe car was struck.\n\nThe Reuters news agency released photos of a destroyed vehicle in the Shati\nneighborhood of Gaza City that it said had carried Mr. Haniyeh\u2019s sons.\n\nHamas also said that the strike took place in northern Gaza and that Mr.\nHaniyeh had received condolence calls from the Turkish president and the\nQatari prime minister. He also got a rare call from the president of the\nPalestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, a harsh critic of Hamas, the group said.\n\nAaron Boxerman and Adam Rasgon contributed reporting.\n\n\u2014 Cassandra Vinograd\n\n## Hamas does not have 40 hostages who meet the terms of a potential swap with\nIsrael, an official says.\n\nImage\n\nA rally on Sunday in Jerusalem calling for the release of the remaining\nhostages as the war in Gaza reached the six-month mark.Credit...Sergey\nPonomarev for The New York Times\n\nA senior Hamas official said on Wednesday that Hamas did not have 40 living\nhostages in Gaza who met the criteria for an exchange under a proposed cease-\nfire agreement with Israel being negotiated.\n\nA senior Israeli official said Israel had been relayed Hamas\u2019s claim, and the\nsenior Hamas official said that the group had informed mediators facilitating\nthe negotiations. The Israeli official and the Hamas official requested\nanonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.\n\nThe assertion raised fears that more hostages might be dead than previously\nbelieved and came as talks between Hamas and Israel stalled amid disagreements\nover the permanency of a cease-fire, the return of displaced Palestinians to\nnorthern Gaza and other issues.\n\nInternational negotiators have proposed an initial six-week cease-fire during\nwhich Hamas would release a first group of 40 hostages \u2014 including women,\nolder people, ill hostages and five female Israeli soldiers \u2014 in exchange for\nhundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons as well as other demands.\n\nIsraeli officials believe there are about 130 hostages remaining in Gaza, and\nIsraeli intelligence officers have concluded that at least 30 of those have\ndied in captivity.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Israel would now demand that young men and\nsoldiers be included among the first 40 released captives. Those hostages had\nbeen expected to have to wait for a later phase of the deal.\n\nThe development came days after the Israeli military said it had recovered the\nbody of an Israeli hostage who, like around 240 others, was abducted during\nthe Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack.\n\nThe Israeli government and Hamas held a brief cease-fire in Gaza in November\nto allow for the release of around 100 hostages captured during the assault in\nexchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, offering a\nrespite from a devastating bombing campaign.\n\n\u2014 Adam Rasgon and Remy Tumin Reporting from Jerusalem and New York\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\n\nSee subscription options\n\n", "frontpage": false}
