Turing Award.\n\nAndrea Kane/Institute for Advanced Study\n\n#### reader comments\n\n23\n\nComputational scientist and mathematician Avi Wigderson of the Institute for\nAdvanced Study (IAS) at Princeton University has won the 2023 A.M. Turing\nAward. The prize, which is given annually by the Association for Computing\nMachinery (ACM) to a computer scientist for their contributions to the field,\ncomes with $1 million thanks to Google. It is named in honor of the British\nmathematician Alan Turing, who helped develop a theoretical foundation for\nunderstanding machine computation.\n\nWigderson is being honored \"for foundational contributions to the theory of\ncomputation, including reshaping our understanding of the role of randomness\nin computation and for his decades of intellectual leadership in theoretical\ncomputer science.\" He also won the prestigious Abel Prize (essentially the\nNobel for mathematics) in 2021 for his work in theoretical computer\nscience\u2014the first person to be so doubly honored.\n\n\"Avi has made fundamental contributions to the theory of computation from\nparallel algorithms to cryptography to absolutely all aspects of complexity\ntheory,\" said Shafi Goldwasser, director of the Simons Institute for the\nTheory of Computing, who won the 2012 Turing Award. \"His numerous\ncontributions over decades to the areas of derandomization and\npseudorandomness has led us to a deep understanding of the deep role of\nrandomness in computing.\"\n\nBorn in Haifa, Israel, Wigderson was the son of an electrical engineer and a\nnurse. His father passed his own love of solving puzzles and mathematics to\nhis son. Wigderson was an undergraduate at the Technion (Israeli Institute of\nTechnology) and went on to earn his PhD in computer science from Princeton in\n1983. He held a few short-term positions before joining the faculty of Hebrew\nUniversity three years later. He has been with the IAS since 1999 and a full-\ntime resident since 2003.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / Wigderson is also recognized as mentor to the next generation of\npromising young researchers.\n\nAndrea Kane/Institute for Advanced Study\n\nWhile computers are fundamentally deterministic systems, researchers\ndiscovered in the 1970s that they could enrich their algorithms by letting\nthem make random choices during computation in hopes of improving their\nefficiency. And it worked. It was easier for computer scientists to start with\na randomized version of a deterministic algorithm and then \"de-randomize\" it\nto get an algorithm that was deterministic.\n\nIn 1994, Wigderson co-authored a seminal paper on hardness versus randomness\nwith Noam Nisan, demonstrating that as useful as randomness can be, it is not\na necessity. Essentially, \"Every probabilistic algorithm that's efficient can\nbe replaced by a deterministic one, so you don't really need [randomness],\"\nWidgerson told Ars. \"The power believed to be in probabilistic algorithms\ndoesn't exist.\" He subsequently coauthored two more highly influential papers\nfurther extending that work on randomness, among many others.\n\nWigderson's 2019 book, Mathematics and Computation: A Theory Revolutionizing\nTechnology and Science, is available for download on his website. \"One central\ntheme is that computation happens everywhere, not just in computers,\"\nWigderson said. \"It is part of the processes in our brain, the way we can talk\nand the cells in our body, but also trees growing or weather and celestial\nthings. In all these natural processes, there are the laws of nature, which\nare local, and they evolve systems. Like in a computer, there are very simple\nrules, and you start with a problem and discover a complex solution to it. So,\nthe methodology is applicable to essentially any science process or study.\nThere are fantastic collaborations with statistical physics, with quantum\nphysics, with computational biology, with economics, with social science\u2014lots\nof beautiful, extremely fruitful connections.\"\n\nAvi Wigderson in conversation with David Nirenberg, director of the Institute\nof Advanced Study.\n\nWigderson's own research is purely theoretical. \"I'm not motivated by\napplications,\" he said. \"But I know that fundamental work, we find uses. Think\nabout Alan Turing. He wrote a mathematical paper in logic in an obscure\njournal about Entscheidungsproblem. It was not motivated by application. But\nthis is what starts computer science. He himself recognized the model he was\nsuggesting is so simple, that we can just start building it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, he does confess to being pleasantly surprised by the eventual\napplication of his work on zero-knowledge interactive proofs in the mid-1980s.\nWith Silvio Micali and Oded Goldreich, Wigderson extended Micali's earlier\nwork on interactive proofs to NP problems, concluding that the solution to\nevery such problem can also be proved with a zero-knowledge proof.\n\n\"Basically we discovered that everything that can be proved, can be proved,\nwithout revealing to the person who is verifying the proof any knowledge they\ndidn't know,\" said Wigderson. \"The motivation came from cryptography, where I\nwant to prove to you that I selected my secret key in the way the protocol\nrequires, but I don't want to tell you what my secret key is. The result is\nvery general and while very satisfying, it was a theoretical solution that it\nseemed to me very complicated to implement. But now variants of it are part of\nblockchains and other crypto systems. So sometimes we are surprised by the\ndiligence of people who really care about practice and really want to see\nthings working.\"\n\nWigderson remains as actively curious as ever and is particularly excited\nabout getting to collaborate with fresh groups of postdocs every year. One\ncurrent project concerns convex optimization in non-Euclidean settings. Convex\noptimization has been broadly applied in machine learning, signal processing,\ncomputer vision, and automatic control systems, for example. Wigderson's\nproject seeks to \"generalize the theory to manifolds, to structures that\nappear in quite a variety of mathematical and physics areas\u2014quantum\ninformation theory, invariant theory, and definitely in computer science,\" he\nsaid. \"It also appears in analysis, for proving inequalities, and in algebra\nfor proving identities. It's pretty broad, and I'm very excited about it.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n23\n\nJennifer Ouellette Jennifer is a senior reporter at Ars Technica with a\nparticular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from\nphysics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV\nseries.
