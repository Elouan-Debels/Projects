The court asked her to compensate the\nbank $26.9 million.\n\nDespite mitigating circumstances \u2014 this was a first-time offense and Lan\nparticipated in charity activities \u2014 the court attributed its harsh sentence\nto the seriousness of the case, saying Lan was at the helm of an orchestrated\nand sophisticated criminal enterprise that had serious consequences with no\npossibility of the money being recovered, VnExpress said.\n\nEARLIER COVERAGE\n\nWhat to know about the real estate tycoon sentenced to death in Vietnam\u2019s\nlargest fraud case\n\nA Vietnamese property tycoon accused of embezzling $12.5 billion begins her\ntrial\n\nHer actions \u201cnot only violate the property management rights of individuals\nand organizations but also push SCB (Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank) into\na state of special control; eroding people\u2019s trust in the leadership of the\nParty and State,\u201d VnExpress quoted the judgement as saying.\n\nHer niece, Truong Hue Van, the chief executive of Van Thinh Phat, was\nsentenced to 17 years in prison for aiding her aunt.\n\nLan and her family established the Van Thing Phat company in 1992 after\nVietnam shed its state-run economy in favor of a more market-oriented approach\nthat was open to foreigners. She had started out helping her mother, a Chinese\nbusinesswoman, to sell cosmetics in Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s oldest market,\naccording to state media Tien Phong.\n\nVan Thinh Phat would grow to become one of Vietnam\u2019s richest real estate\nfirms, with projects including luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels\nand shopping centers. This made her a key player in the country\u2019s financial\nindustry. She orchestrated the 2011 merger of the beleaguered SCB bank with\ntwo other lenders in coordination with Vietnam\u2019s central bank.\n\nThe court found that she used this approach to tap SCB for cash. She\nindirectly owned more than 90% of the bank \u2014 a charge she denied \u2014 and\napproved thousands of loans to \u201cghost companies,\u201d according to government\ndocuments. These loans then found their way back to her, state media VNExpress\nreported, citing the court\u2019s findings.\n\nShe then bribed officials to cover her tracks, it added.\n\nFormer central bank official Do Thi Nhan was also sentenced Thursday to life\nin prison for accepting $5.2 million in bribes.\n\nLan\u2019s arrest in October 2022 was among the most high-profile in an ongoing\nanti-corruption drive in Vietnam that has intensified since 2022. The so-\ncalled Blazing Furnace campaign has touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese\npolitics. Former President Vo Van Thuong resigned in March after being\nimplicated in the campaign.\n\nBut Lan\u2019s trial shocked the nation. Analysts said the scale of the scam raised\nquestions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred,\ndampening Vietnam\u2019s economic outlook and making foreign investors jittery at a\ntime when Vietnam has been trying to position itself as the ideal home for\nbusinesses trying to pivot their supply chains away from China.\n\nThe real estate sector in Vietnam has been hit particularly hard. An estimated\n1,300 property firms withdrew from the market in 2023, developers have been\noffering discounts and gold as gifts to attract buyers, and despite rents for\nmixed-use properties known in Southeast Asia as shophouses falling by a third\nin Ho Chi Minh City, many in the city center are still empty, according to\nstate media.\n\nIn November, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam\u2019s top\npolitician, said that the anti-corruption fight would \u201ccontinue for the long\nterm.\u201d\n\nANIRUDDHA GHOSAL\n\nGhosal covers the intersection of business and climate change in southeast\nAsia for The Associated Press.
