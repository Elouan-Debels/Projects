The study, \"Rare genetic\nvariation in Fibronectin 1 (FN1) protects against APOE\u03b54 in Alzheimer's\ndisease,\" was published online in the journal Acta Neuropathologica.\n\nThe discovery of the protective variant, which appears to allow toxic forms of\namyloid out of the brain and through the blood-brain barrier, supports\nemerging evidence that the brain's blood vessels play a large role in\nAlzheimer's disease and could herald a new direction in therapeutic\ndevelopment.\n\n\"Alzheimer's disease may get started with amyloid deposits in the brain, but\nthe disease manifestations are the result of changes that happen after the\ndeposits appear,\" says Caghan Kizil, Ph.D., a co-leader of the study that\nidentified the variant and associate professor of neurological sciences (in\nneurology and in the Taub Institute) at Columbia University Vagelos College of\nPhysicians and Surgeons.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that some of these changes occur in the brain's\nvasculature and that we may be able to develop new types of therapies that\nmimic the gene's protective effect to prevent or treat the disease.\"\n\n## An attractive drug target?\n\nThe protective variant identified by the study occurs in a gene that makes\nfibronectin, a component of the blood-brain barrier, a lining surrounding the\nbrain's blood vessels that controls the movement of substances in and out of\nthe brain.\n\nFibronectin is usually present in the blood-brain barrier in very minute\namounts, but it is increased in large amounts in people with Alzheimer's\ndisease. The variant identified in the fibronectin gene seems to protect\nagainst Alzheimer's disease by preventing the buildup of excess fibronectin at\nthe blood-brain barrier.\n\n\"It's a classic case of too much of a good thing,\" Kizil says. \"It made us\nthink that excess fibronectin could be preventing the clearance of amyloid\ndeposits from the brain.\"\n\nThe researchers confirmed that hypothesis in a zebrafish model of Alzheimer's\ndisease and have additional studies in mice underway. They also found that\nreducing fibronectin in the animals increased amyloid clearance and improved\nother damage caused by Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"These results gave us the idea that a therapy targeting fibronectin and\nmimicking the protective variant could provide a strong defense against the\ndisease in people,\" says study co-leader Richard Mayeux, MD, chair of\nneurology and the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Professor of Neurology, Psychiatry,\nand Epidemiology.\n\nThe newest treatments for Alzheimer's disease target the amyloid deposits\ndirectly and are very efficient at removing the deposits via the immune\nsystem. However, simply removing the deposits this way doesn't improve\nsymptoms or repair other damage.\n\n\"We may need to start clearing amyloid much earlier and we think that can be\ndone through the bloodstream,\" Mayeux adds. \"That's why we are excited about\nthe discovery of this variant in fibronectin, which may be a good target for\ndrug development.\"\n\n## Protective gene was found in people resilient to Alzheimer's disease\n\nThe researchers discovered the protective variant in people who never\ndeveloped symptoms but who had inherited the e4 form of the APOE gene, which\nsignificantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"These resilient people can tell us a lot about the disease and what genetic\nand non-genetic factors might provide protection,\" says study co-leader Badri\nN. Vardarajan, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurological science (in\nneurology, the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center, and the Taub Institute), who is\nan expert in using computational approaches to discover Alzheimer's disease\ngenes.\n\n\"We hypothesized that these resilient people may have genetic variants that\nprotect them from APOEe4.\"\n\nTo find protective mutations, the Columbia researchers sequenced the genomes\nof several hundred APOEe4 carriers over age 70 of various ethnic backgrounds,\nincluding those with and without Alzheimer's disease. Many participants were\nresidents of Northern Manhattan who were enrolled in the Washington\nHeights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project, an ongoing study that has been\nconducted by Columbia University's Department of Neurology for more than 30\nyears.\n\nThe study identified the fibronectin variant. Based on the Columbia team's\nobservations, another group from Stanford and Washington universities\nreplicated the study in an independent cohort of APOEe4 carriers, mostly of\nEuropean origin.\n\n\"They found the same fibronectin variant, which confirmed our finding and gave\nus even more confidence in our result,\" Vardarajan says.\n\nThe two groups combined the data on their 11,000 participants, which allowed\nthem to calculate that the mutation reduces the odds of developing Alzheimer's\nin APOE4 carriers by 71% and forestalls the disease by roughly four years in\nthose who eventually develop the disease.\n\nThe researchers estimate that 1% to 3% of APOEe4 carriers in the United\nStates\u2014roughly 200,000 to 620,000 people\u2014may also carry the protective\nfibronectin mutation.\n\n## Wide therapeutic potential\n\nThe fibronectin variant, though discovered in APOEe4 carriers, could protect\nagainst Alzheimer's disease in people with other forms of APOE.\n\n\"There's a significant difference in fibronectin levels in the blood-brain\nbarrier between cognitively healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's\ndisease, independent of their APOEe4 status,\" Kizil says.\n\n\"Anything that reduces excess fibronectin should provide some protection, and\na drug that does this could be a significant step forward in the fight against\nthis debilitating condition.\"\n\nMore information: Rare genetic variation in Fibronectin 1 (FN1) protects\nagainst APOE\u03b54 in Alzheimer's disease, Acta Neuropathologica (2024).\n\nProvided by Columbia University Irving Medical Center\n\nCitation: Newly found genetic variant defends against Alzheimer's disease\n(2024, April 10) retrieved 11 April 2024 from\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-newly-genetic-variant-defends-\nalzheimer.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
