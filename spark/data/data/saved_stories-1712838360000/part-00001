Hart\n\nIt is not hard to cut a bagel into two equal halves which are linked like two\nlinks of a chain.\n\nTo start, you must visualize four key points. Center the bagel at the origin,\ncircling the Z axis. A is the highest point above the +X axis. B is where the\n+Y axis enters the bagel. C is the lowest point below the -X axis. D is where\nthe -Y axis exits the bagel.\n\nThese sharpie markings on the bagel are just to help visualize the geometry\nand the points. You don't need to actually write on the bagel to cut it\nproperly.\n\nThe line ABCDA, which goes smoothly through all four key points, is the cut\nline. As it goes 360 degrees around the Z axis, it also goes 360 degrees\naround the bagel.\n\nThe red line is like the black line but is rotated 180 degrees (around Z or\nthrough the hole). An ideal knife could enter on the black line and come out\nexactly opposite, on the red line. But in practice, it is easier to cut in\nhalfway on both the black line and the red line. The cutting surface is a two-\ntwist Mobius strip; it has two sides, one for each half.\n\nAfter being cut, the two halves can be moved but are still linked together,\neach passing through the hole of the other. (So when you buy your bagels, pick\nones with the biggest holes.)\n\nIf you visualize the key points and a smooth curve connecting them, you do not\nneed to draw on the bagel. Here the two parts are pulled slightly apart.\n\nIf your cut is neat, the two halves are congruent. They are of the same\nhandedness. (You can make both be the opposite handedness if you follow these\ninstructions in a mirror.) You can toast them in a toaster oven while linked\ntogether, but move them around every minute or so, otherwise some parts will\ncook much more than others, as shown in this half.\n\nIt is much more fun to put cream cheese on these bagels than on an ordinary\nbagel. In additional to the intellectual stimulation, you get more cream\ncheese, because there is slightly more surface area.\n\nTopology problem: Modify the cut so the cutting surface is a one-twist Mobius\nstrip. (You can still get cream cheese into the cut, but it doesn't separate\ninto two parts.)\n\nCalculus problem: What is the ratio of the surface area of this linked cut to\nthe surface area of the usual planar bagel slice?\n\nFor future research: How to make Mobius lox...\n\nNote: I have had my students do this activity in my Computers and Sculpture\nclass. It is very successful if the students work in pairs, with two bagels\nper team. For the first bagel, I have them draw the indicated lines with a\n\"sharpie\". Then they can do the second bagel without the lines. (We omit the\nschmear of cream cheese.) After doing this, one can better appreciate the\nstone carving of Keizo Ushio, who makes analogous cuts in granite to produce\nmonumental sculpture.\n\nAddendum: I made a video showing how to do this.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
