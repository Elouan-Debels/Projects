How is it different than other\ncooling methods?

The two\nsemiconductors of the couple are connected electrically in series by soldering\neach semiconductor to a copper / metal interconnect.\n\nThe couple is then soldered to ceramic plates to give it structural rigidity\nand a flat surface for good heat transfer.\n\nAlthough a minimum of one couple is needed for thermoelectric cooling, in\npractice, sometimes hundreds of couples are used per thermoelectric module.\nSee below image of a thermoelectric cooling module that shows the couples\ninside.\n\nA thermoelectric cooler module (Peltier cooler module) that has been\ndisassembled with heat. The metal interconnects are still bonded to the top\nceramic plate underside (not visible) but the semiconductor thermoelements\nhave been unsoldered from the interconnects\n\nWhen an electrical current is applied to the terminals a thermoelectric\ncooling module, heat is transported from one side of the semiconductor to the\nother. As a result, this creates a cold side where heat is removed and a hot\nside where the heat is deposited.\n\nA thermal image of a thermoelectric module showing hot side and cold side. The\nhot side and cold side can be swapped by reversing the polarity / current flow\nat the power terminals.\n\nThe rate at which heat is moved from one side to the other is proportional to\nthe number of couples (semiconductor p and n pairs) and to the rate of\nelectrical current flow provided to the module.\n\nBelow is a 3D schematic of a thermoelectric cooling module.\n\nThermoelectric cooling module [Peltier cooling module] schematic showing\nn-type and p-type semiconductors connected electrically by metal interconnects\nand sandwiched between ceramic substrates.\n\nReversing the polarity of a thermoelectric cooling module reverses the current\nflow. And reversing the current flow swaps the side that gets hot and the side\nthat gets cold. See below animation. The same side of the module can be made\nto cool down to a lower temperature or heat up to a higher temperature.\n\nAnimated thermal image of a thermoelectric /Peltier module in cooling and\nheating mode\n\n# Unmatched Technical Services for Your Product or Application\n\nTechnical, engineering and consulting services for your thermoelectric cooling\nor thermoelectric power generation idea, application or product.\n\n  * Overcome your current challenge\n  * Take the fastest, least risky and most effective route to your goals\n  * Your idea to prototype and beyond\n\nExplore Our Services\n\nWork with Us\n\nWith thermoelectric / Peltier couples and modules, charge carriers are\nelectrons and holes (a \u201chole\u201d in material science is the absence of an\nelectron).\n\nP-type charge carriers are holes and n-type charge carriers are electrons.\nWhen charge carriers move, they take heat with them.\n\nCharge carriers moving to a higher energy level at the semi-conductor and\nmetal interface (also knows as a junction) absorb heat at the cold side. And\ncharge carriers that move to a lower energy level release heat to the hot\nside.\n\nA Peltier / thermoelectric cooling couple showing charge carriers that are\nelectrons and holes.\n\nThe schematic below shows what happens when the electrical current flow is\nreversed. Charge carriers in the p-type and n-type materials now move in the\nopposite direction. Heat is now moved in the opposite direction. The build up\nof heat creates the hot side and the reduction of heat on the opposite side\ncreates the cold side.\n\nThermoelectric cooling couples showing the reversal of heat flow when the\ndirection of current flow is reversed.\n\nFor a deeper description of the physics behind the heat transfer through a\nthermoelectric / Peltier module, please read more about how heat is\ntransported in a Peltier Module. And follow the link.\n\n## What is the Difference Between a Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) and a\nThermoelectric Generator (TEG)?\n\nThermoelectric / Peltier cooler modules are almost identical to thermoelectric\ngenerator (TEG) modules. And in some case are identical. However in contrast,\nrather than using electrical power to move heat like thermoelectric / Peltier\ncooler modules, thermoelectric generator (TEG) modules work in reverse and use\nheat to create electrical power.\n\nFor more information on how thermoelectric generators (TEG) work, see the\nbelow article.\n\nHow Thermoelectric Generators (TEG) Work\n\n## Can Thermoelectric Cooling Make Ice or Boil Water?\n\nThe following video answers the question of whether or not thermoelectric\ncooling can make ice. The video also answers the question of whether or not\nthermoelectric heating can boil water.\n\n## Who Invented / Discovered Thermoelectric Cooling?\n\nJean Charles Athanase Peltier discovered the Peltier effect in 1834. During\nhis experiment, Peltier connected two different metals and applied an\nelectrical current through the two metals connected in series. He discovered\nthat at the connection point between the two metals (junction), cooling or\nheating would be produced depending on the direction of the electrical\ncurrent. Today, rather than using metals to make thermoelectric cooling\nmodules, semiconductors are used. Semiconductor properties increase the\nefficiency of thermoelectric cooling modules and thermoelectric generator\nmodules.\n\nJean Charles Athanase Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA\n\n## What Thermoelectric Semiconductor Materials are used for Thermoelectric\nCooling?\n\nBismuth telluride (Bi_2Te_3) is the key semiconductor material used for\nthermoelectric cooling. This semiconductor is made from a combination of\nbismuth and tellurium. Bismuth telluride is doped with selenium and antimony\nto increase electrical conductivity and to give n-type and p-type properties\nrespectively.\n\nBismuth telluride has been in use for thermoelectric cooling and\nthermoelectric generator waste heat recovery since the 1950\u2019s.\n\nThermoelectric material performance is characterized by the thermoelectric\ndimensionless figure of merit, zT. Higher zT means increased thermoelectric\ncooling performance.\n\nDoped p-type and n-type bismuth telluride semiconductor \"dice\".

All of these names are\ngenerally referring to the same technology.\n\n## Advantages of Thermoelectric Cooling\n\n1\\. Solid-State, No Moving Parts, Reliability \u2013 Solid-state thermoelectric\ndevices have no moving parts. Therefore there are no moving parts to wear out.\nThis leads to high reliability that is seen in other solid-state electronics.\n\n2\\. Operable in Any Orientation \u2013 Some cooling and heating technologies have\nrestrictions on how they can be mounted relative to gravity. With\nthermoelectric / Peltier cooling, there are no such restrictions.\nThermoelectric devices can cool or heat in any orientation.\n\n3\\. Operable Under Zero and High-G \u2013 Some cooling technologies are unable to\noperate under high G-loading (high acceleration forces) or in zero-G (zero\ngravity). Peltier cooling does not have these restrictions.\n\n4\\. No Greenhouse Gases \u2013 Many cooling methods such as vapor compression\ncooling use greenhouse gases that are fundamental to their operation. With\nPeltier or thermoelectric cooling devices, no such greenhouse gases are\nrequired.\n\n5\\. Cooling and Heating in One Device \u2013 Typically, when an application\nrequires both heating and cooling, the heating is performed with one\ntechnology such as an electric heater, and the cooling is performed with\nanother technology, such as vapor compression refrigeration. With\nthermoelectric cooling, cooling and heating are performed with the same device\nby simply reversing the direction of electric current to the module. This can\nlead to reduced complexity and lower costs for some applications.\n\n6\\. Compact Size \u2013 Thermoelectric modules are very compact with simple\ngeometry. This is not the case with other technologies that are typically\nbulky and complex. Using thermoelectric cooling enables increased design\nflexibility.\n\n7\\. Completely Silent and No Vibration \u2013 Thermoelectric and Peltier cooling\ncan be designed to be completely silent for some applications. Since there are\nno moving parts, there is no vibration or noise associated with thermoelectric\nmodules outside of a fan that may be required for some applications.\n\n8\\. Scalability \u2013 Peltier / thermoelectric cooling can be scaled to any size\nfrom microwatts of cooling all the way up to kilowatts and beyond. This kind\nof full range scalability is not available for other cooling methods. This\nleads to more possible applications of thermoelectrics. Whether the\napplication is miniature or large scale or somewhere in between,\nthermoelectrics can be designed to handle the cooling load.\n\nTiny thermoelectric cooling module\n\n9\\. Precise Temperature Control \u2013 Thermoelectric cooling modules can be used\nto control the temperature of an object very precisely to within +/- 0.1\ndegrees Celsius.\n\n10\\. Efficiency (COP) \u2013 COP (Coefficient of Performance) is one measure of\nefficiency of a thermoelectric cooling. The higher the COP, the more efficient\nthe thermoelectric cooler. COP of 1 means the thermoelectric cooler can move\n(pump) 1 unit of heat with 1 unit of power consumption. COP of 2 means the\nthermoelectric device can move 2 two units of heat with 1 unit of power\nconsumption. The COP of any given thermoelectric module can be very high and\nbe much-much higher and 2. But it depends on the application, the design of\nthe thermoelectric module and the electrical operation.\n\n11\\. Zonal Cooling (Efficiency and Low Power Consumption) \u2013 Thermoelectrics\ncan be used for spot cooling, also known as distributed cooling or zonal\ncooling. This means rather than cooling a full enclosure with a bulky cooling\nsystem, a thermoelectric module is used just to cool the small part that needs\nto be cooled. With other cooling methods, more often than not this in not\npossible. Using thermoelectrics can lead to a huge cost savings and electrical\npower consumption savings.\n\n12\\. Below Ambient Cooling \u2013 Air cooling is incapable of cooling an object\nbelow the ambient air temperature. Below ambient cooling is possible with\nthermoelectric cooling.\n\n13\\. No Internal Liquids \u2013 Popular methods of refrigeration such as vapor\ncompression refrigeration or liquid cooling cooling rely on internal liquids\nfor heat transport. And these liquids tend to eventually leak out. This is not\nthe case for thermoelectrics as the heat is transferred using charge carriers\n(electrons and holes).\n\n14\\. No Maintenance \u2013 With no moving parts to wear and no internal liquids to\nleak out over time, thermoelectric cooling has an advantage of being a\nmaintenance free cooling technology.\n\n15\\. Heating COP > 1 \u2013 Typical resistive heaters are limited a COP of 1. That\nis one unit of electrical power provides one unit of heat. Thermoelectric\ncooling can be designed to have a COP that is greater than one. One unit of\nelectrical power can move more than one unit of heat. This makes\nthermoelectric heating a more efficient heating technology for some\napplications.\n\n## Disadvantages of Thermoelectric Cooling\n\n1\\. Efficiency / Coefficient of performance \u2013 Efficiency / coefficient of\nperformance (COP) can be very high in some thermoelectric cooling applications\nand / or with proper system design. In other thermoelectric cooling\napplications and /or with poor system design, COP can be very low relative to\nother cooling technologies. So efficiency depends on the application and how\nwell the system is engineered.\n\nAnother important idea is high thermoelectric cooling efficiency is not always\nneeded. Small purposefully designed inefficient low-cost thermoelectric\nrefrigerators are a popular and viable product that would not be viable with\nother cooling technologies. And customers are completely happy without ever\nconsidering if the product has a high cooling efficiency or not.\n\nEfficient products are often desired because they consume less power which\nmakes them less costly to operate. To achieve less power consumption,\nthermoelectric cooling can be used for spot, zonal or distributed cooling\nrather than cooling an entire enclosure with another cooling technology that\nis not capable of spot cooling.\n\nAlthough some cooling technologies can more efficient (higher COP) than\nthermoelectric cooling in some cases, the power consumption is still lower for\nthe spot or zonal cooling using a thermoelectric cooling.\n\nFor example one could use 10 watts of power to cool an object using an\ninefficient design or technology. Or use the most efficient cooling technology\nthat cools an entire enclosure with 100 watts of power. High efficiency\nbecomes irrelevant here. The choice is to use 10 watts or 100 watts of power\nconsumption. It does not matter if the 100 watts of cooling is generated with\na more efficient technology, it\u2019s still 100 watts of power rather than 10\nwatts.\n\n2\\. Deceivingly Simple Appearance \u2013 Thermoelectric cooling modules look simple\nenough. No moving parts, no complex mechanical contraptions, lights, sounds or\nvibrations. This simplistic look sometimes sends the wrong impression. The\nimpression is that anybody can work with thermoelectric modules and achieve\nthe desired results.\n\nAs it turns out, many try and fail to achieve results before asking for help.\nWorse yet, some assume that since they could not make the thermoelectric\nmodule do what they wanted it to, nobody can. And another unique and viable\nthermoelectric cooling product can go unrealized.\n\n3\\. Cost-per-watt of Cooling \u2013 If the only consideration for a given cooling\napplication is cost per watt of cooling power, in some cases for some\napplications, cooling methods outside of thermoelectric cooling can be lower\ncost-per-watt of cooling power. However, cost-per-watt is never the only\nfactor to be considered for a given application. Even if cost-per-watt is\nlower for a non-thermoelectric cooling application, other costs may be high\nwhen taking into other considerations such as reliability, size, design\nflexibility, environmental factors, temperature control, scalability,\nefficiency, maintenance, and other factors.\n\n4\\. Limited Thermoelectric Engineering Expertise \u2013 There is a limited amount\nof engineering expertise to apply thermoelectric cooling to product design.\nBecause of this, good help is hard to find. Thermoelectric module manufactures\ndirect customers to try their products. And when the desired outcome is not\nachieved, customers give up and assume thermoelectric technology is not right\nfor their application.\n\n5\\. A Lot of Variables \u2013 To achieve a viable product that uses thermoelectric\ncooling, many variables need to be considered. Sometimes it is obvious that\nthermoelectric cooling is not right for a particular application, but most of\nthe time that determination requires a skilled engineer, experience, deep\nthought, and computer simulations.\n\n# Unmatched Technical Services for Your Product or Application\n\nTechnical, engineering and consulting services for your thermoelectric cooling\nor thermoelectric power generation idea, application or product.\n\n  * Overcome your current challenge\n  * Take the fastest, least risky and most effective route to your goals\n  * Your idea to prototype and beyond\n\nExplore Our Services\n\nWork with Us\n\n## How Fast do Thermoelectric Cooling Modules Get Cold?\n\nThe video below shows how fast a thermoelectric / Peltier module can get cold.\nIt also shows how fast a thermoelectric / Peltier module gets hot.\n\n## What is a Multi-Stage or Cascade Thermoelectric Cooler Module?\n\nA multi-stage thermoelectric cooling module is sometimes referred to as a\ncascade thermoelectric module.\n\nThese multi-stage modules, when compared to single-stage modules are designed\nto achieve much higher temperature differences between the hot and cold side.\nThis typically translates to a much colder cold side temperature.\n\nWith multistage modules, additional single-stage modules are essentially\nattached to the hot side of the first stage in order to cool the hot side.\nEach stage added to the hot side of the previous stage requires more cooling\npower than the previous stage and therefore is either bigger in size to\naccommodate more couples or is the same size with a higher couple density.\n\nMulti-stage thermoelectric coolers (in-general) consume much higher electrical\npower and have much lower cooling rate than a similar single-stage\nthermoelectric module.\n\n3-stage cascade stacked thermoelectric multi-stage module\n\n2-stage cascade thermoelectric cooling module showing p and n-type\nsemiconductors and copper interconnects between semiconductors\n\nMulti-state cascade thermoelectric cooler module [Peltier cooler module]\nrendering\n\nMulti-state cascade thermoelectric cooler module [Peltier cooler module]\nrendering\n\n## Why does Thermoelectric Cooling Require both a p-type and n-type\nSemiconductor?\n\nThermoelectric cooling modules can be made from all p-type or all n-type\nsemiconductors. However doing so makes a thermoelectric module that is not\nvery practical.\n\nFor example, below is a schematic of a thermoelectric module that contains\nonly n-type semiconductors. In this schematic, the n-type semiconductors are\nconnected together electrically in parallel. The problem arises when there is\na need to increase the cooling capacity to a practical level. To increase\ncooling, many n-type semiconductors are needed. Adding more semiconductors\nelectrically in parallel reduces the electrical resistance of the\nthermoelectric module to very low levels. This in-turn increases the magnitude\nof electrical current required to operate the thermoelectric module to very\nhigh levels. These high magnitude electrical currents are impractical and in\nmany cases unachievable.\n\nn-type electrically parallel semiconductor thermoelectric cooling module\n[Peltier Cooling module] wired electrically parallel. To increase cooling\ncapacity to be practical, more n-type elements are required. This reduces the\nelectrical resistance of the module and increases the required electrical\ncurrent to impractical levels.\n\nLike the purely n-type module above, the schematic below is made of all p-type\nsemiconductors. The same practicality issues arise here as with the n-type\nmodule.\n\nIt is interesting to compare the purely n-type modules and the purely p-type\nmodule configurations. By only changing the semiconductor type, without\nchanging the electrical flow direction, the heat flow direction completely\nreverses.\n\np-type electrically parallel semiconductor thermoelectric cooling module\n[Peltier Cooling module] wired electrically parallel. To increase cooling\ncapacity to be practical, more p-type elements are required. This reduces the\nelectrical resistance of the module and increases the required electrical\ncurrent to impractical levels.\n\nIf connecting all n-type or all p-type semiconductors electrically in parallel\ncauses a problem, why not connect all n-type or all p-type semiconductors\nelectrically in series?\n\nThe following figures show why this is a problem. The electrical connection\nwhich is usually copper is also a very good conductor of heat. When connected\nelectrically in series, the heat from the hot side thermally conducts to the\ncold side and negates the cooling. This is also known as a thermal short\ncircuit. So connecting either two n-type or two p-type semiconductors\nelectrically in series does not solve the problem.\n\nn-type electrically series semiconductor thermoelectric cooling module\n[Peltier Cooling module] wired in electrical series showing a thermal short\ncircuit on the electrical connector that connects the n-type elements in\nseries.\n\np-type electrically series semiconductor thermoelectric cooling module\n[Peltier Cooling module] wired in electrical series showing a thermal short\ncircuit on the electrical connector that connects the p-type elements in\nseries.\n\nThe solution to the problems of low electrical resistance, high electrical\ncurrent or thermal short circuit is to connect one p-type and n-type\nsemiconductor couple electrically in series. And then add couples to increase\nthe cooling rate.\n\nThermoelectric cooling semiconductors in series showing heat flow direction,\ncurrent flow direction and charge carriers\n\n## What are the Applications of Thermoelectric / Peltier Cooling?\n\nThermoelectric cooling is used for a wide range of applications such as\nrefrigeration, temperature control, cooling, heating, thermal management, and\nair conditioning.
