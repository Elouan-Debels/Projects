You might think this\nis obvious, but think about creationists and homeopaths and people who think\nthe moon landing was a hoax.\u201d And then further on in this vein.\n\nAnd I thought: \u201cNO NO NO NO NO NO NO!\u201d\n\nI will make a confession. Every time someone talks about the stupidity of\ncreationists, moon-hoaxers, and homeopaths, I cringe.\n\nIt\u2019s not that moon-hoaxers, homeopaths et al aren\u2019t dumb. They are. It\u2019s not\neven that these people don\u2019t do real harm. They do.\n\nWhat annoys me about the people who harp on moon-hoaxing and homeopathy \u2013\nwithout any interest in the rest of medicine or space history \u2013 is that it\nseems like an attempt to Other irrationality.\n\nIt\u2019s saying \u201cLook, over here! It\u2019s irrational people, believing things that we\ncan instantly dismiss as dumb. Things we feel no temptation, not one bit, to\nbelieve. It must be that they are defective and we are rational.\u201d\n\nBut to me, the rationality movement is about Self-ing irrationality.\n\nIt is about realizing that you, yes you, might be wrong about the things that\nyou\u2019re most certain of, and nothing can save you except maybe extreme\nepistemic paranoia.\n\nTalking about moon-hoaxers and homeopaths too much, at least the way we do it,\nis counterproductive to this goal. Throw examples of obviously stupid false\nbeliefs at someone, and they start thinking all false beliefs are obvious.\nGive too many examples of false beliefs that aren\u2019t tempting to them, and they\nstart believing they\u2019re immune to temptation.\n\nAnd it raises sloppiness to a virtue.\n\nTake homeopathy. I can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019ve heard people say:\n\u201cHomeopaths don\u2019t realize beliefs require evidence. No study anywhere has ever\nfound homeopathy to be effective!\u201d\n\nBut of course dozens of studies have found homeopathy to be effective.\n\n\u201cWell, sure, but they weren\u2019t double-blind! What you don\u2019t realize is that\nthere can be placebo effects from...\u201d\n\nBut of course many of these studies have been large double-blinded randomized\ncontrolled trials, or even meta-analyses of such.\n\n\u201cOkay, but not published in reputable journals.\u201d\n\nIs The Lancet reputable enough for you?\n\n\u201cBut homeopaths don\u2019t even realize that many of their concoctions don\u2019t\ncontain even a single molecule of active substance!\u201d\n\nBut of course almost all homeopaths realize this and their proposed mechanism\nfor homeopathic effects not only survives this criticism but relies upon it.\n\n\u201cBut all doctors and biologists agree that homeopathy doesn\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nHave you ever spent the five seconds it would take to look up a survey of what\npercent of doctors and biologists believe homeopathy doesn\u2019t work? Or are you\njust assuming that\u2019s true because someone on your side told you so and it\nseems right?\n\nI am of course being mean here. Being open-minded to homeopaths \u2013 reading all\nthe research carefully, seeking out their own writings so you don\u2019t\naccidentally straw-man them, double-checking all of your seemingly \u201cobvious\u201d\nassumptions \u2013 would be a waste of your time.\n\nAnd someone who demands that you be open-minded about homeopathy would not be\nyour friend. They would probably be a shill for homeopathy and best ignored.\n\nBut this is exactly the problem!\n\nThe more we concentrate on homeopathy, and moon hoaxes, and creationism \u2013 the\nmore people who have never felt any temptation towards these beliefs go\nthrough the motions of \u201cdebunk\u201d-ing them a hundred times to one another for\nfun \u2013 the more we are driving home the message that these are a representative\nsample of the kinds of problems we face.\n\nAnd the more we do that, the more we are training people to make the correct\napproach to homeopathy \u2013 ignoring poor research and straw men on your own side\nwhile being very suspicious of anyone who tells us to be careful \u2013 their\nstandard approach to any controversy.\n\nAnd then we get people believing all sorts of shoddy research \u2013 because after\nall, the world is divided between things like homeopathy that Have Never Been\nSupported By Any Evidence Ever, and things like conventional medicine that\nHave Studies In Real Journals And Are Pushed By Real Scientists.\n\nOr losing all subtlety and moderation in their political beliefs, never\nquestioning their own side\u2019s claims, because the world is divided between\nPeople Like Me Who Know The Right Answer, and Shills For The Other Side Who\nTell Me To Be Open-Minded As Part Of A Trap.\n\nThis post was partly inspired by Gruntled and Hinged\u2019s You Probably Don\u2019t Want\nPeer-Reviewed Evidence For God. But there\u2019s another G&H post that got me\nthinking even more.\n\nInoculation is when you use a weak pathogen like cowpox to build immunity\nagainst a stronger pathogen like smallpox. The inoculation effect in\npsychology is when a person, upon being presented with several weak arguments\nagainst a proposition, becomes immune to stronger arguments against the same\nposition.\n\nTell a religious person that Christianity is false because Jesus is just a\nblatant ripoff of the warrior-god Mithras and they\u2019ll open up a Near Eastern\nhistory book, notice that\u2019s not true at all, and then be that much more\nskeptical of the next argument against their faith. \u201cOh, atheists. Those are\nthose people who think stupid things like Jesus = Mithras. I already figured\nout they\u2019re not worth taking seriously.\u201d Except on a deeper level that\nprecedes and is immune to conscious thought.\n\nSo we take the intelligent Internet-reading public, and we throw a bunch of\nincredibly dumb theories at them \u2013 moon-hoaxism, homeopathy, creationism,\nanti-vaxxing, lizard people, that one guy who thought the rapture would come a\ncouple years ago, whatever. And they are easily debunked, and the stuff you\nand all your friends believed was obviously true is, in fact, obviously true,\nand any time you spent investigating whether you were wrong is time you\nwasted.\n\nAnd I worry that we are vaccinating people against reading the research for\nthemselves instead of trusting smarmy bloggers who talk about how stupid the\nother side is.\n\nThat we are vaccinating people against thinking there might be important\ntruths on both sides of an issue.\n\nThat we are vaccinating people against understanding how \u201cscientific evidence\u201d\nis a really complicated concept, and that many things that are in peer-\nreviewed journals will later turn out to be wrong.\n\nThat we are vaccinating people against the idea that many theories they find\nabsurd or repugnant at first will later turn out to be true, because nature\ndoesn\u2019t respect our feelings.\n\nThat we are vaccinating people against doubt.\n\nAnd maybe this is partly good. It\u2019s probably a good idea to trust your doctor\nand also a good idea to trust your climatologist, and rare is the field where\nI would feel comfortable challenging expert consensus completely.\n\nBut there\u2019s also this problem of hundreds of different religions and political\nideologies, and most people are born into ones that are at least somewhat\nwrong. That makes this capacity for real doubt \u2013 doubting something even\nthough all your family and friends is telling you it\u2019s obviously true and you\nmust be an idiot to question it at all \u2013 a tremendously important skill. It\u2019s\nespecially important for the couple of rare individuals who will be in a\nposition to cause a paradigm shift in a science by doubting one of its\nfundamental assumptions.\n\nI don\u2019t think that reading about lizard people or creationism will affect\npeople\u2019s ability to distinguish between, let\u2019s say, cyclic universe theory\nversus multiverse theory, or other equally dispassionate debates.\n\nBut if ever you ever need to have a true crisis of faith, then any time you\nspend thinking about homeopathy and moon hoaxes beyond the negligible effect\nthey have on your life will be time spent learning exactly the wrong mental\nhabits.\n\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged rationality.

Going through the motions of \u201cdebunk\u201d-ing these sort of\nthings a hundred times to one another for fun seems like an excellent summary\nof the \u201cskeptic community\u201d, a community that I have always disliked. It seems\nlike a bunch of atheists got bored rehearsing the same ten or so arguments for\natheism and decided to move onto similar issues they could argue with\nimaginary people about. These people have decided that they like science and\nthings that look like science, and don\u2019t like religion and things that look\nkind of like religion. They also have a general approval of academia and the\nmainstream opinion, as well as probably a moderate contempt for beliefs that\nare lower-class. Then they proceed to go through all the evidence for the side\nthey support so that they can argue it better. In short, these people pick\ntheir beliefs on purely aesthetic grounds and then go on to find the evidence\nto support that belief. This is pretty much the polar opposite of rationality.\n\nHide\n\n     * BenSix says:\n\nApril 16, 2014 at 5:38 am ~new~\n\nIndeed. Sometimes I long for the days when \u201cnerd\u201d made reference to one\u2019s\nacademic dedication and not one\u2019s aesthetic preferences. Sure, being described\nin such terms often implied that one was to receive a wedgie but at least it\nalso hinted at one\u2019s accomplishments. Nowadays, to say that one is an admirer\nof science can mean nothing more than that one likes Dr Who and inspirational\nmemes featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Witness the \u201ci fucking love science\u201d\nFacebook page.\n\nSo much \u201cskepticism\u201d seems to be the IQ equivalent of picking on the shortest\nkid in the playground. When it comes to matters of importance it can be\nstartling how irrational such defenders of objective thought can be. The\nskeptic community has been riven by allegations of sexual harassment against\nsome of its leading lights \u2013 a matter on which its members have very firm\nopinions given that none of the cases have seen the inside of a courtroom.\n\nHide \u2191\n\n       * ozymandias says:\n\nApril 16, 2014 at 7:05 am ~new~\n\nMuch of the controversy about sexual harassment in the atheist community is\nabout sexual harassment of convention-goers. It is not illegal to sexually\nharass a person attending a convention (it is illegal to sexually harass your\n*employee*, but if someone is just going to the con it\u2019s not). Therefore, much\nof the controversy could not possibly end up in a courtroom.\n\nOf the ones that don\u2019t end up in a courtroom, like... have you seen how much\nshit people get for accusing people of sexual harassment, even without naming\nthe person they\u2019re accusing? Going to court could only make that worse. It\nseems perfectly reasonable to me that a legitimately sexually harassed person\nwould go \u201cactually, I want *fewer* death threats rather than *more*, thank\nyou.\u201d In addition, most of the groups accused are charities that are doing\ngood work, and legal defense is expensive; it seems reasonable that people\nmight want to put pressure on them from the outside rather than drawing money\naway from the good work that they\u2019re doing. And it seems reasonable that the\nlevel of certainty that would make you comfortable making someone pay a fine\nis higher than the level of certainty that would make you comfortable avoiding\nsomeone or not inviting them to parties.\n\nHide \u2191\n\n         * BenSix says:\n\nApril 16, 2014 at 8:20 am ~new~\n\nI don\u2019t want to name names but the cases I was thinking of concern one\ngentleman who may or may not be rad and another who I\u2019ll hint towards in rhyme\nbecause I have no way of murmuring it. My understanding is that both of them\nare headed to the courts but perhaps I am misinformed on that.\n\nRegardless, it seems irrational to draw firm conclusions from either one of\ndifferent accounts of events that involved absolute strangers (and this view\nis only reinforced by the fact that the conclusions skeptics appear to have\ndrawn depend entirely on which side of \u201csexual harassment at conferences\u201d\naffair they took).\n\nHide \u2191\n\n     * peterdjones says:\n\nApril 19, 2014 at 6:17 am ~new~\n\n+1\n\nImo, the people who are more right about rationality are the philosophers.\nThey are generally delighted to find a good arguments for unpopular topics, as\nit makes things more interesting.\n\nHide \u2191\n\n  2. adbge says:\n\nApril 15, 2014 at 10:07 pm ~new~\n\n> (yes, I did just use \u201cself\u201d as a verb. I don\u2019t even have the excuse of it\n> being part of a philosophical tradition)\n\nWell, it\u2019s a part of this philosophical tradition.\n\nAnd if anyone needs doubt training, try adopting a 1:1 reading ratio. If you\nlean left, read Chomsky, then read The Anti-Chomsky Reader, then read another\nsmart progressive, then a smart conservative. Repeat.\n\nThe generalization being, of course, explicitly attempt to read the opposite.\nAny contentious belief can be paired this way \u2014 reductionism, utilitarianism,\nwhatever. Don\u2019t stick to books, either. Surrounded by vegan or feminist jokes?\nTry reading r/feminism or whatever \u2014 you know, expose yourself to people who\nactually hold that belief.\n\nHide\n\n     * Benquo says:\n\nApril 15, 2014 at 10:16 pm ~new~\n\nFinding opposite opinions that are likely to convince you is difficult to do\nin a single swoop. I would instead suggest finding the most reasonable-to-you-\nsounding person in that direction, finding out who they read further in that\ndirection, and iterating.\n\nFor example, I moved leftward from libertarianism by reading Matthew Yglesias\nand Will Wilkinson, not Marx, and rightward by reading Scott, not\nneoreactionaries or regular conservatives.\n\nHide \u2191\n\n       * peterdjones says:\n\nApril 19, 2014 at 6:25 am ~new~\n\nPlus there\u2019s usually material available in a debate or pro and anti format.\n\nHide \u2191\n\n     * ChristianKl says:\n\nApril 16, 2014 at 8:24 am ~new~\n\nWhen I go looking for smart conservatives, where do I go?\n\nHide \u2191\n\n       * BenSix says:\n\nApril 16, 2014 at 9:21 am ~new~\n\nHere, here, here and here are good places to start.

Perhaps if the complaint is\nmild enough, there could be another control group who was told by their doctor\nthat the ailment would resolve itself in a few days without drugs.\n\nI don\u2019t know if such a study exists, but I\u2019d love to see one.\n\nHide \u2191\n\n     * Scott Alexander says:\n\nApril 16, 2014 at 7:45 pm ~new~\n\nI disagree with the thrust of your post.\n\nYou can No True Scotsman your way to \u201cno good studies show homeopathy exists\u201d\nif you define \u201cgood study\u201d as \u201cone that produces the correct answer\u201d.\n\nBut where I was going with this is...well...we start with people in armchairs\npontificating that it seems to them that X must be true, and other people in\ndifferent armchairs equally certain X must be false.\n\nScience is supposed to be an improvement on that process \u2013 where no matter\nwhat your opinion, experiments produce brute facts and then you are forced to\neither accept them or be clearly revealed as a fraud.\n\nBut the actual process is really messy. What really happens is that some\nstudies show X, other studies show not X, and people sit in their armchairs\npontificating about how only the studies that show X are any good, and other\npeople sit in different armchairs equally certain that only the studies that\nshowed not X were valid.\n\nA relativist would stop there and say science doesn\u2019t work. I would be less\npessimistic and say that first of all not all science is like that, and second\nof all disputes about which studies are correct tend to be much more\nresolvable than disputes about what\u2019s true, especially since the worst case\nscenario is you just do more studies and see who can predict their outcome.\n\nBut the \u201conly bad studies show homeopathy\u201d thing seems to me simplistic. If it\nwere as simple as \u201call the studies that show homeopathy forget to include a\nplacebo group\u201d, then fine. But the problems are actually much subtler than\nthat, sometimes no one knows exactly what they were, and a smart homeopathist\ncould probably come up with equally plausible sounding problems with the\nstudies that debunk homeopathy.\n\nSo I think the problem I\u2019m trying to bring up here is that the standard\nphrasing suggests Science succeeds at its goal of mechanistically producing\ntruth in a way that leaves no room for opinion, whereas the reality is that\nScience sort of chips away little by little at the need for opinion and is\nable to inject some truth in there, but it\u2019s still really really ugly.\n\nThis is why we have things like meta-analyses, Cochrane Reviews, and why a lot\nof really well-studied questions (like whether antidepressants outperform\nplacebo in mild depression) are still very controversial.\n\nThere are probably \u201cgood studies\u201d for most people\u2019s definition of good on both\nsides of the antidepressant study.

You\u2019re not wrong for wanting to\nchoose both 1A and 2B. You\u2019re just a human with a normal non-linear utility\nfunction, rather than the linear one that most naive EV calculations assume.\n\nThe key is in the sentence in the wiki that says \u201cexpected utility theory,\nequal outcomes added to each of the two choices should have no effect on the\nrelative desirability of one gamble over the other\u201d. That\u2019s only true if you\nhave a linear utility function (which no sane person does). It\u2019s actually that\nthe equal outcomes between the gambles are taken for granted as definitely\noccuring.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve taken for granted that you\u2019ll get $1M (in Experiment 1), Gamble\n1B\u2019s reward structure changes. Rather than being $0/$5M, it\u2019s $-1M/$4M. That\n1% chance of loss isn\u2019t just staying normal, it\u2019s giving back the $1M you\u2019ve\nalready mentally claimed, and adjusted your utility for. For nearly all\npeople, going from \u201chas $1M\u201d to \u201chas $0\u201d is a far greater drop than the\nimprovement from gaining an additional four million, so Gamble 1A is the right\nchoice.\n\nExperiment 2 lines up more with the wiki\u2019s summary. Since the shared outcome\nis $0, that\u2019s what gets taken for granted \u2013 nothing will happen by default,\nand you\u2019re gambling on something happening. Then the two gambles are more\nequitable \u2013 a 100% chance of $1M, or a 9% chance of nothing and a 91% chance\nof $5M. It\u2019s now reasonable for people to choose Gamble 2B.\n\nYou probably could hack people\u2019s preferences here \u2013 rather than offering\nGamble 2B, just offer Gamble 2A, then for the winners, offer them a quintuple-\nor-nothing bet on 1:10 odds. Leaving the bet leaves you with 2A\u2019s payment\nstructure, taking it gives you 2B\u2019s structure. But I\u2019d bet more people would\nleave the bet in this situation than would take 2A when presented the two\ngambles up-front.\n\nAlways remember that linear-utility EV maximizers are insane, and not a model\nof human behavior, or even rational behavior. They\u2019ll consider Martingale\nbetting a great deal, and pass up a guaranteed million for a 51% chance of\n$100M and a 49% chance of $-98M.\n\nHide \u2191\n\n         * Douglas Knight says:\n\nApril 18, 2014 at 12:35 am ~new~\n\nUsually when people say that utility isn\u2019t linear, they mean it isn\u2019t linear\nin money. You appear to be saying this, but it is completely irrelevant to the\nAllais paradox. What is relevant to the Allais paradox is that utility should\nbe linear in probability. Humans fail at this and they are wrong. \u201cAdded\u201d does\nnot mean added money, but added possibilities: situation 1 is a choice between\nA and B. Situation 2 is we flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, you get no\ninput in the decision, where as if it comes up tails, you get put in situation\n1, except that you have to make the decision ahead of time. The answer being\ndifferent in 1 and 2, that is, before and after seeing the coin, is failure of\nreflective consistency.\n\n(Actually, my situation 1 doesn\u2019t come up. The real version is two versions of\n2, one in which the heads result is money and one where it is no money;\nprobably because people vary in their response to my situation 1, but the two\nversions of 2 produce the same results.)\n\nHide \u2191\n\n         * Sniffnoy says:\n\nApril 19, 2014 at 10:38 pm ~new~\n\nDouglas Knight has already made the basic point I wanted to, but I wanted to\nexpand on it a bit more.\n\nIn short, you are pretty mixed-up about what people are talking about when\nthey talk about utility functions and linearity. It is indeed the case, as you\nsay, that utility functions are not required to be linear in money, nor in\nquantity of any other good; and the direction and the degree to which it\ndeviates from linearity determines to what extent you are risk-averse or risk-\nseeking.\n\nUtility functions are, however, required to be \u201clinear in probability\u201d \u2014\nexcept that really, the preceding statement is actually an abuse of notation,\nas I\u2019ll get to in a moment. Otherwise you don\u2019t have a utility function; you\njust have a preference (pre-)ordering. (Some people do use the phrase \u201cutility\nfunction\u201d in this way, but seeing as this does not seem to be the sense under\ndiscussion, I\u2019m just going to ignore it. Also, to me it seems silly to\nintroduce a function to the real numbers when all you wanted to talk about was\na preordering.)\n\nThe Allais paradox is a violation of \u201clinearity in probability\u201d; it does not\nin any way rely on linearity in money. Your comments about the latter are\nbasically irrelevant.\n\n(Although, I must disagree with your final comment that a utility function\nwhich is linear in money is insane and irrational \u2014 by what means are you\njudging another agent\u2019s terminal values? I mean, sure, it seems nutty for a\nperson to build such an agent, and I\u2019d certainly question its builder\u2019s\nrationality, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s meaningful to state that the agent itself\nis \u201cirrational\u201d.)\n\nBut back to the point \u2014 I have so far not justified why utility should be\n\u201clinear in probability\u201d, but in the case of the Allais paradox, where the\nindependence assumption of the VNM theorem is violated, the problem can be\nseen via a Dutch Book argument.\n\nAnd indeed I\u2019m not going to give any justification for this beyond A. pointing\nout the VNM theorem and, B. making some comments on why (in my opinion) the\nVNM axioms make sense. (At least, they make sense if you already accept the\nnotion of measuring strength-of-belief with probability; otherwise you need\nsomething like Savage\u2019s Theorem. But you seem to already be assuming that, so\nI\u2019ll use the VNM framework.)\n\nWell, OK \u2014 you haven\u2019t done anything to challenge totality, transitivity, or\nthe Archimedean property, so let\u2019s just talk about independence. But if you\naccept totality and transitivity, then independence becomes easy to justify,\nbecause of exactly the sort of Dutch book argument Eliezer makes in his post\non it! So, really, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re coming from here.\n\nNow I should note here that I\u2019ve really basically been counterarguing rather\nthan refuting; I haven\u2019t actually addressed your argument that this choice is\nconsistent. But you haven\u2019t really given one \u2014 you haven\u2019t actually given an\nexample of a utility function that will make this consistent; your\ncalculations are just of the form \u201cwell, it could turn out this way\u201d. But as\nhas already been noted, because this violates the independence axiom, there\ncan be no such utility function \u2014 at least, not with the definition of\n\u201cutility function\u201d that\u2019s actually under discussion.\n\nFinally, a note on the \u201cabuse of notation\u201d issue I\u2019ve been mentioned \u2014\nproperly speaking, a utility function is a function (call it f) from\nconsequences to real numbers, not a function (call it F) from gambles to real\nnumbers. Obviously one can induce F from f (by making F \u201clinear in\nprobability\u201d, though \u201caffine\u201d might be a better word than \u201clinear\u201d). But what\nmakes f a utility function is that the F determined in this way actually\nreflects the agent\u2019s preferences. If there were not required to be any\nrelation between the f describing the agent\u2019s preferences among outcomes and\nthe F describing the agent\u2019s preferences among gambles, what would be the\npoint of talking about f? It would be useless except under conditions of\ncertainty. (And why would we use functions to the real numbers rather than\njust pre-orderings?) Of course, by the VNM theorem, if our agent satsifies the\nappropriate axioms, then f is not useless because it in fact determines F\nentirely, obviating any need for talking about F as a separate object \u2014 hence\nwhy the simpler object f, not its extension F, is referred to as the \u201cutility\nfunction\u201d.

Until fairly recently\n(say post-WWII), most drugs were discovered by synthesizing new chemicals and\nthrowing them at test subjects willy-nilly. Even today, rational drug design\nis at best a strategy for weeding out the drug design space from \u201cmind-\nblowingly astronomical\u201d to \u201cgargantuan\u201d, and often (at least in\npsychopharmacology) the theory of how they will work turns out to have almost\nnothing to do with how they do work.\n\nIt\u2019s problematic (that is, it creates problems) to project backward\nanachronistic frames on historical discoveries. At the time they were\ndeveloping, vaccination and homeopathy were very similar ideas\u2013both derive\nfrom Paracelsus\u2019 maxim \u201cwhat makes a man ill also cures him.\u201d\n\nHomeopathy as a system ran aground on the idea of \u201csuccussion\u201d\u2013the\nastronomical dilutions that skeptics use to bingo-card the whole subject. Yes,\n15x, 20x, 30x preparations are just expensive magic water. But 3x, 4x, 5x?\nSome of those might work.\n\nA steelmanned homeopathy would be a hypothesis about nonlinearity in drug\neffect curves, and another about immune signaling. And we have tons of real\ndata there.\n\nBoo-light time, not that anyone\u2019s still reading: actually existing homeopathic\n\u201cremedies\u201d are bullshit and I\u2019d never waste money on them.

The point is not that LWers who engage in politics have irrational\nbeliefs, but that their beliefs seem indistinguishable from the beliefs of\nnon-LW people of the same position, i.e. progressive LWers sound the same as\nprogressive non-LWers, libertarian LWers sound the same as libertarian non-\nLWers, and so on.

LWers know that politics is the mindkiller, and so they have a good reason\nto stay away from politics altogether, lest they be mindkilled themselves. The\nfact that so many LWers are engaged in politics is evidence that they haven\u2019t\nfully absorbed this lesson, and instead of using the lessons of the sequences\nto make themselves more accurate epistemologically, are just using them to\njustify their position and beat up on their opponents more effectively.

Many of us in the \u201cinoculation\u201d world (honestly,\nI\u2019ve read hundreds of articles on vaccines, and inoculation may have been used\nonce) think that the Lancet has some serious explaining to do about its\nquality of peer review.\n\nA rational scientific skeptic examines the quantity and quality of evidence\nbefore walking to a conclusion.
