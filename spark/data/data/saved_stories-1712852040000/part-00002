We also removed items from the\nConsumer Price Index that we feel should not be in there, because these items\nare mostly traded between players and NPCs.\n\nAsteroids are now valued at 70% refining value. The following graphs are\naffected by this change:\n\n  * Production vs. Destruction vs. Mining\n\n  * Summary of Key Economic Figures by Region\n\nOverseer Personal Effects, Sleeper Components, Triglavian Data, Rogue Drone\nAnalysis Data and Bounty Encrypted Bonds were removed from the CPI. These\nchanges have minor effects on the following graphs:\n\n  * Economic Indices - Full History\n\n  * Economic Indices - Since 2018\n\n  * Decomposition of Consumer Price Index\n\nYou can download all of the raw data used in this report here.
