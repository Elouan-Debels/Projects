She came up with a solution:\na job working on the floor of Tesla\u2019s auto manufacturing facility in Fremont,\nCalifornia. It paid about $20 an hour.\n\nTurley\u2019s grandparents had worked at the same plant when it made cars for\nGeneral Motors. She knew what working on an assembly line would entail and\nhoped to stay; her grandparents had worked there for decades. \u201cI don\u2019t have a\nproblem with doing hard labor,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cThe problem was the sexual harassment. It was the racism,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthe constant disrespect.\u201d\n\nOn her second day of training, Turley noticed the phrase \u201cBlack bitches need\nto go home\u201d written on the bathroom walls. Once she started working on the\nline, she heard her white male lead\u2014the person who supervised her on the\nfloor\u2014use the N-word and other racial slurs like \u201ccoon,\u201d according to a legal\ncomplaint she filed later. He also frequently used the words \u201cbitch\u201d and\n\u201ccunt.\u201d He \u201cused just about every awful and offensive word I can think of,\u201d\nTurley said in the filing. It wasn\u2019t just him; other white coworkers also\noften used the N-word around her and her fellow Black coworkers. She\nfrequently saw the word \u201cbitch\u201d written on the bathroom walls alongside the\nN-word and \u201cKKK.\u201d\n\nTurley likes to wear layers, dressing like a \u201ctomboy,\u201d she said. Her lead and\nanother coworker started making comments about her being gay, harassing her\nfor her appearance.\n\nTurley had never experienced anything like it at a workplace before. \u201cNever,\u201d\nshe said. In her filing, she wrote: \u201cEvery day that I had to show up to work\nwas difficult for me; it was hard to walk into the factory knowing the\ntreatment that I was going to face.\u201d In late December 2020, she sent Tesla\u2019s\nhuman resources department a complaint laying out her lead\u2019s racial and sexual\nharassment. The company didn\u2019t address the issue, she said.\n\n#### Current Issue\n\nApril 2024 Issue\n\nInstead, Turley continued, after she made the complaint, the men \u201creally\nstarted harassing me.\u201d One day when she got angry at them, her lead moved her\nto a new line assignment, in a place \u201cwhere he knew I wasn\u2019t tall enough,\u201d she\nsaid. At her new station, a car would come down the line and she had only a\nfew minutes to install the floor and seats before the next car would arrive.\nTurley, who is five feet tall, wasn\u2019t able to reach inside, so she had to\nclimb inside the car. She protested that she couldn\u2019t safely do the work but\nwas ignored. Rushing to install the necessary components, she nearly fell out\nof the door, catching herself but breaking her wrist in the process.\n\nTurley was sent to the on-site urgent care facility, where, she said, she was\ngiven an over-the-counter pain reliever and a hand brace and sent back to the\nline. Her lead told her that if she didn\u2019t keep doing the same task, he would\n\u201cfire [her] black ass,\u201d according to her legal complaint.\n\nIn February 2021, Turley had finally had enough. With around 10 other women\nshe\u2019d been hired with, she walked out, never to return. \u201cIt felt like I was\nkind of letting my grandmother down,\u201d she recalled. Financially, \u201cit was\ndevastating.\u201d But, she added, \u201cit\u2019s better to have my sanity.\u201d\n\nTake it from the top: Elon Musk is known for closely monitoring his company\u2019s\nfactories and for opposing safety reforms. At left, the names of four Tesla\ncar models spell out \u201cS3XY.\u201d (Bloomberg)\n\nTesla, by far the country\u2019s top maker of electric vehicles, is riding the wave\nof EV adoption. Its vehicles and technology offer a way to tackle climate\nchange. Such a cutting-edge company is attractive to plenty of people looking\nfor meaningful work. Not to mention that a position as a production associate,\nan entry-level factory floor job, currently pays around $25 per hour\u2014less than\nwhat unionized autoworkers can expect, though much more than what most\nservice-sector workers make. But a review by The Nation of more than 50 legal\ndocuments, government records at the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA) and the National Labor Relations Board, along with\ninterviews with workers and their lawyers, paints a picture of a company whose\nfactory floors are stuck in another century.\n\nDozens of Black workers have alleged that racism is not only rampant but\ntolerated at the company\u2019s factories, from menacing white-power graffiti to\nBlack workers being shunted to the most grueling jobs with no chance of\ngetting a promotion. At least a dozen women have described a work environment\nthick with sexual innuendo and complain of inappropriate touching and catcalls\nhurled at them daily. Cars zip down the line at dangerous speeds, workers say,\nforcing them to piece the cars together at a breakneck pace, made all the more\ndifficult by the insufficient training they are given. Many workers, like\nTurley, have had to endure all these violations at the same time.\n\nDiscrimination and harassment can happen on any factory floor. How a company\nreacts to it dictates how pervasive and severe the behavior gets and whether\nemployees feel safe. Tesla employees who have complained about these problems\nsay they were either ignored or retaliated against. Many didn\u2019t think it was\nworth speaking up. It was, after all, many of their supervisors who were\ncasually using the N-word and blatantly ogling women\u2019s butts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an atmosphere on the line that allows for mistreatment,\u201d said J.\nBernard Alexander III, an attorney at Alexander Morrison + Fehr, who has\nrepresented some of the workers at the Fremont plant. When workers feel\ndesperate enough to complain, he continued, \u201cthere\u2019s no responsiveness. As\nlong as the line is moving, progress is being made, they can\u2019t care less.\u201d\n\nSuch a corporate culture, with its pervasive dehumanization and permissive\nattitude toward abusive behavior, usually rots from the top, and in the case\nof Tesla, it\u2019s easy to draw a straight line back up to its CEO, Elon Musk, who\nhimself has been accused of sexual harassment. He named his company\u2019s cars the\nModels S, 3, X, and Y\u2014that is, \u201cSEXY.\u201d In case the innuendo wasn\u2019t obvious\nenough, Musk made it explicit: \u201cWe just trademarked \u2018sexy,\u2019\u201d he once boasted,\nand the company emblazons \u201cS3XY\u201d on all kinds of merchandise, including on the\nseat of red satin shorts.\n\nWhite-collar workers at Tesla have also complained of mistreatment. In 2016,\nAJ Vandermeyden, a former engineer at Tesla, sued the company for ignoring her\ncomplaints of sexual harassment and then passing her over for promotions and\npaying her less than male coworkers. Seven former employees have accused\nSpaceX, another Musk-run company, of failing to promote women and of\npermitting sexual harassment. Another employee, Michelle Dopak, recently sued\nthe company for paying her less than male coworkers, refusing to promote her,\nand retaliating after she reported that her manager forced her into a quid pro\nquo sexual relationship.\n\nBut racial and sexual harassment seems to be particularly common on Tesla\u2019s\nfactory floor, and Musk has taken an especially hands-on approach there,\nclaiming to have frequently slept overnight at the Fremont factory. In 2018, a\nformer safety expert at Tesla told Reveal that leaders at the factory avoided\ndemarcating dangerous areas with yellow, because Musk doesn\u2019t like the color.\n\u201cMusk\u2019s name often was invoked to justify shortcuts and shoot down concerns,\u201d\nReveal reported. A chief executive who is that deeply involved in the\nworkplace not only must be fully aware of what is happening on the factory\nfloor but also likely sets the tone for what behavior is and isn\u2019t going to be\nconsidered acceptable.\n\nTesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn Tesla\u2019s factories, \u201cit\u2019s survival of the fittest,\u201d Alexander said. The\npeople who can\u2019t survive \u201cthe toxic atmosphere,\u201d he added, \u201care ultimately\nweeded out.\u201d\n\nExposed to the elements: In Fremont, California, Tesla has erected production\ntents outside of its main plant; workers say Black employees are\ndisproportionately assigned to work there. (Bloomberg / Getty Images)\n\nAfter Jermaine Keys\u2019s twins were born, he needed more than the $15 an hour he\nwas earning at a construction company. So in September 2019, Keys got a job at\nTesla\u2019s Fremont factory, which paid about $23 an hour. \u201cIt was a big\ndifference,\u201d he told me. At first, Keys enjoyed the job. But a few months in,\nhis supervisor started calling him \u201cboy.\u201d Keys heard white coworkers use the\nN-word and call people \u201cmonkey.\u201d There was a swastika drawn with a black\nmarker near where he clocked in to work every day. Black workers, he said,\nwere made to do things like clean up the work area when the assembly line was\nslow; white ones weren\u2019t. \u201cIt was just hurtful,\u201d Keys said. When he said\nsomething to a supervisor, he was told to put his head down so he wouldn\u2019t get\nfired.\n\n\u201cI wanted to quit,\u201d Keys said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t quit, because I had to take\ncare of my family.\u201d Instead, he started missing days of work. That meant\nforgoing income, forcing him to borrow money from his mother. He looked for\nanother job but couldn\u2019t find one that paid as well.\n\nBy April 2020, Keys had had enough. He quit because he \u201ccould not continue to\nwork in such a degrading, hurtful, and intimidating environment,\u201d he said in a\nlegal filing.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty tough,\u201d Keys told me last year. He nearly lost his house. He\nwas still paying his mom back. \u201cI\u2019m still damaged from it.\u201d\n\nAd Policy\n\nIn 42 legal complaints reviewed by The Nation, former Tesla Fremont workers\nrepeatedly describe hearing non-Black coworkers, including leads and\nsupervisors, using racist language, sometimes directed at them. Their\ncomplaints date as far back as November 2014, when Stephan Winchester, who\nworked on the factory floor as a production associate, said in a legal filing\nthat he heard the N-word \u201cevery day.\u201d It was still happening as recently as\nDecember 2022, when Demetrias De Loach, who worked as a material handler and\nforklift operator at the plant, said he heard the N-word \u201cday in and day out.\u201d\nAskari Hunt, who worked at the factory until July 2022, said in a legal filing\nthat a non-Black coworker told him, \u201cI fucking hate you, you fucking [N-word]\nI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Many of the filings say workers frequently heard \u201cboy\u201d and\n\u201cmonkey\u201d used to refer to Black workers and that Tesla employees called the\nfactory \u201cthe plantation\u201d and \u201cthe slave ship.\u201d\n\nCrystal English, who had worked at the auto and parts manufacturers ZF\nFriedrichshafen AG and Ford Motor Company before starting at Tesla\u2019s Fremont\nfactory, said in a legal filing that when she worked at those other companies,\n\u201cI never heard employees use this kind of language on the job, and the company\nhad made clear that there were serious consequences for any kind of racist\nbehavior.\u201d\n\n#### More from Bryce Covert\n\n  * ##### What We Can Learn From Minnesota Unions\u2019 Big Contract Wins\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\n  * ##### Lina Khan\u2019s Anti-Monopoly Power\n\nDecember 9, 2023\n\n  * ##### As Costs and Demand Skyrocket, Abortion Funds Struggle to Keep Up\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nRacist graffiti in the factory\u2019s bathrooms, which Winchester saw when he\nworked there in 2014 and was still a problem when De Loach worked there in\n2022, was rarely removed. When it was, more would appear. Cleon Waters, who\nworked at the factory from September 2016 until June 2019, said he saw\ndrawings of hanging Black men and of nooses on boxes on the factory floor. \u201cIt\nmade me feel like I couldn\u2019t trust my co-workers and that I was unsafe as a\nBlack man in the Tesla factory,\u201d Waters said in his legal complaint.\n\nAlthough Tesla says all new hires get anti-harassment training on the first\nday of their orientation, a number of workers said they received little to no\nantidiscrimination or harassment training. English said in her legal complaint\nthat the lack of training \u201cwas very different\u201d from her previous experiences;\nat Friedrichshafen, new employees had been required to attend a\n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d two-day off-site training, and at Ford they had to attend an\neight-hour in-person training. \u201cThe only communications I remember from Tesla\nabout discrimination and harassment are the emails that Elon Musk has sent to\nall employees and a three-page document Tesla has called the \u2018Anti-Handbook\nHandbook,\u2019 which only addresses discrimination and harassment by saying to\ntreat others the way you want to be treated,\u201d she stated in her complaint.\n\nIn filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla says that\nemployees \u201care encouraged to speak up both in regard to misconduct and safety\nconcerns\u201d through a number of channels. But some workers who experienced\nharassment never spoke up because they didn\u2019t think anything would be done\nabout it. Of those who reported what was happening, all say the company did\nnot take meaningful action; to their knowledge, employees who used racist\nlanguage were never disciplined. One worker said that not long after he told\nhis supervisor about the language making him uncomfortable, the same\nsupervisor called him the N-word.\n\n## Popular\n\n\u201cswipe left below to view more authors\u201dSwipe \u2192\n\n  1. ### The Toxic Culture at Tesla The Toxic Culture at Tesla\n\nFeature / Bryce Covert\n\n  2. ### Lauren Oyler and the Critic in the Internet Age Lauren Oyler and the Critic in the Internet Age\n\nBooks & the Arts / Alana Pockros\n\n  3. ### The End of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d Marks the End of an Era The End of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d Marks the End of an Era\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Bessner\n\n  4. ### Coaching Great Dawn Staley Defends Trans Athletes Coaching Great Dawn Staley Defends Trans Athletes\n\nDave Zirin\n\nWorkers also describe the Fremont factory as being racially segregated. Tesla\nhas erected a tent behind the factory building in which additional production\nhappens; it offers little protection from the cold at night, portable toilets\ninstead of proper bathrooms, and no indoor places to eat. Black workers say\nthat they are more likely than others to be forced to work in the tent. They\nare also disproportionately assigned the most physically demanding tasks on\nthe factory floor, such as lifting heavy panes of glass and installing bulky\ncar seats. Non-Black workers are more likely to work in electronics, quality\nassurance, and the office\u2014jobs that can be done while sitting.\n\nThrough conversations with coworkers, Turley learned that she and other Black\npeople were paid less than other workers. In his complaint, Winchester said\nthat he worked seven days a week, never called in sick, and performed at the\nsame level as his coworkers. Yet he never received an evaluation from his non-\nBlack supervisors that was high enough to make him eligible for a raise or an\nincrease in a benefit like stocks.\n\nSeveral workers who filed complaints said that nearly all of the supervisors,\nleads, and managers were white and that Black people weren\u2019t given the same\nopportunities to move up as other employees. (As of 2022, Tesla\u2019s workforce\nwas 33 percent white, 28 percent Hispanic, 21 percent Asian, 11 percent Black,\nand 2 percent Native Hawaiian; in 2020, the leadership was 59 percent white\nand 4 percent Black.)\n\nMoses Sullivan hoped his experience in accounting and his bachelor\u2019s degree\nwould help him get a job in Tesla\u2019s accounting department. He started working\non the factory floor in January 2020 to \u201cget my foot in the door,\u201d he said.\nThen he was assigned to a tent behind the building. \u201cIt was a Jim Crow\nsituation,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThe Black people, honestly, were in a position to\ndo the grunt work.\u201d He applied for a job related to accounting and was\nrebuffed. \u201cYou want to contribute or be in a position where you can bring your\nskills in, your knowledge, degrees, your expertise,\u201d he said. Yet no matter\nhow many openings he saw for jobs he was qualified to do, he never moved up.\n\nOne day, someone spray-painted a swastika in the parking lot in a conspicuous\nspot. Sullivan said he never saw anyone at the company ever clean it away or\npaint it over. \u201cThat just made me sick,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t care how\nbig this company is or what they\u2019re offering, this just does not meet my moral\nstandards.\u2019\u201d He quit that April. In his legal complaint, he wrote that it was\n\u201cdevastating to see an organization so large, so technologically advanced, and\nso forward-thinking in some ways be so regressive in its practices regarding\nrace and discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe filings at the Fremont factory are part of a potential class-action\nlawsuit charging Tesla with racial discrimination. Last April, a jury ordered\nthe company to pay a former employee, Owen Diaz, $3.2 million after it found\nthat the company had created a hostile work environment by failing to address\nracism on the job. In addition to these lawsuits, the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission has sued the company for allowing racial harassment at\nits plant and retaliating against those who complained, as has the California\nDepartment of Fair Employment and Housing.\n\nOn the line: Inside the Tesla plant in Fremont. (San Francisco Chronicle /\nGetty Images)\n\nTyonna Turner was hired to work at the Fremont factory in November 2020. Just\n18 at the time, she was \u201cpersistently\u201d sexually harassed, she alleges in a\nlegal complaint. She was hit on \u201capproximately 100 times\u201d by her coworkers,\nwho commented on her appearance, invited her over to their homes, made noises\nat her, and stalked her. Several months in, she decided to complain to her\nsupervisor, who told her, \u201cThat\u2019s just how people are.\u201d Starting in January\n2022, a coworker began harassing her for months, asking her to come to his\napartment, commenting on her clothing and weight, and following her around and\nstaring at her, even after she told him to leave her alone. She finally\ncomplained about him to her supervisors in September. She was fired the very\nsame evening, supposedly for not meeting the company\u2019s \u201cintegrity standards.\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s experience was not an isolated one. In 10 legal complaints alleging\nsexual harassment on the floors of Tesla factories reviewed by The Nation,\nworkers describe an environment in which women, who made up just 21 percent of\nTesla\u2019s workforce in 2020 and 17 percent of its leadership, were constantly\nsubjected to sexually charged comments, lascivious stares, and unwanted\ntouching. \u201cTesla\u2019s factory floor more resembles a crude, archaic construction\nsite or frat house than a cutting-edge company,\u201d according to some of the\ncomplaints. Approximately 45 other people have brought cases making similar\nclaims.\n\nJessica Barrazza needed money to support her two sons, and working at Tesla\nwould provide nearly double the pay she was earning at a boutique. So she took\na job at the Fremont factory in October 2018, hoping she might make a career\nthere, according to an interview she gave to Rolling Stone in 2022. But almost\nevery day she heard male coworkers, including supervisors, making comments\nlike \u201cLook at those titties,\u201d \u201cShe has a fat ass,\u201d and \u201cGo ahead, sexy\u201d as she\nwalked to and from her workstation, according to a legal filing reviewed by\nThe Nation. Others whistled or stared suggestively. A lead propositioned her\nby text message, writing: \u201cI just think you sexy asf\u201d and \u201cI always had a\ncrush on yo fine ass.\u201d Coworkers brushed up against her with their groins.\n\nShe reported the behavior, but HR didn\u2019t do anything to stop it. Then, in\nSeptember 2021, according to her complaint, she felt a man put his leg between\nhers as she was clocking out. That incident led to a panic attack. Barrazza\nwent on medical leave and was ultimately fired.\n\nJessica Brooks was harassed on her first day of orientation in June 2021; a\nman called out, \u201cWoohoo, yeah!\u201d as she did squats as part of a warm-up\nexercise, according to her legal complaint. Once she started the job, the\nverbal and physical harassment was so constant that she started stacking boxes\naround her station to discourage men from getting close or ogling her, and she\nbought flannel shirts to tie around her waist. On Alisa Blickman\u2019s first day\nat the Fremont factory in March 2021, she saw male workers taking photos of a\nfemale worker\u2019s butt, which were then circulated among the other workers. Her\nsupervisor touched and rubbed her lower back every morning, and the harassment\ndidn\u2019t end after she reported it.\n\nAlize Brown, who was the sole provider for her 3-month-old baby when she\nstarted working at the factory in November 2020, said in a legal complaint\nthat a male coworker called her a \u201ccow\u201d and said she was \u201cmilking\u201d because she\nwas breastfeeding. Michala Curran, who was 18 when she started at Tesla in\nDecember 2019\u2014it was her first job out of high school\u2014said in her complaint\nthat a factory supervisor told her she had a \u201cbig butt\u201d and tried to slap it\nwithin her first weeks. A coworker asked her to give him a hand job in the\nparking lot.\n\nMany of the women were deeply affected by what they went through. Some\ndescribed it as traumatizing and nightmarish, and some suffered debilitating\nanxiety in the aftermath. Most ended up quitting because they couldn\u2019t deal\nwith the abuse or were fired when they refused to return to work.\n\nWorkers allege that there was virtually no anti-harassment training. Blickman\ntold Rolling Stone that at her orientation, a man in a \u201cS3XY\u201d T-shirt read off\nthe company\u2019s policies in a monotone and then played a video that mostly\ncontained examples of women harassing men. \u201cI thought, \u2018If I\u2019m sexually\nharassed, they\u2019re not going to care,\u2019\u201d she said. Most women didn\u2019t make\ncomplaints, but those who did said little to nothing was ever done.\n\nIn its response to some of the sexual harassment lawsuits, Tesla has filed\nstatements from supervisors and coworkers who claim to have never seen or\nheard sexual harassment and who say they would have reported it if they had.\nThe company attempted to force these cases into private, individual\narbitration\u2014it requires every employee to sign an arbitration agreement to\nwork there\u2014but in May 2022 a court denied that move, allowing the women to\nproceed with their cases.\n\nPervasive problems: Workers\u2019 reports suggest that Tesla\u2019s plant in Sparks,\nNevada, has a racist and sexist environment similar to the one in Fremont.\n(Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nTesla took over the Fremont factory, its first, in 2010. The site was\npreviously occupied by New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI), a joint\nventure between General Motors and Toyota. Tesla employed 47,000 people in\nCalifornia as of 2022, and the Fremont plant has produced more than 2 million\nvehicles. In the years since then, the company has opened other factories in\nthe United States, in Sparks, Nevada; Buffalo, New York; and Austin, Texas.\nThe same pervasively racist and sexist environment seems to have spread to at\nleast one of them. In June 2020, Carlos Hicks started working at the\nGigafactory in Sparks, which produces cars and batteries. The job paid well\u2014he\nmade about $22 an hour as an entry-level material handler\u2014and the schedule\nallowed him to keep going to school. \u201cThe work was pretty interesting,\u201d he\ntold me, and he hoped to work his way up in the company. But he immediately\nbegan seeing racist graffiti\u2014including swastikas, Confederate flags, and\nphrases like \u201cBring slavery back\u201d\u2014scrawled in bathrooms and elevators. He\nassumed that the graffiti would be painted over and that managers would tell\nemployees to stop. He had worked at other large corporations before\u2014Amazon,\nFedEx, Walmart. \u201cUsually, those kinds of things are mitigated,\u201d he told me.\n\nBut \u201cthroughout my entire time there, I\u2019ve never seen any corrective action or\nmaintenance over those writings,\u201d he continued. In a legal filing, he also\nalleges that Black employees like him were made to work in \u201cunfavorable and\nunsafe work areas\u201d and that less physically demanding work was given to non-\nBlack workers, just as workers have alleged in Fremont.\n\nSevere sexual harassment has also spread beyond the Fremont factory. Shauna\nIsrael starting working at the Sparks factory in October 2017. In a legal\nfiling, she said that she was subjected to sexual harassment \u201cthrough almost\nthe entirety of [her] employment.\u201d A coworker repeatedly made sexual comments\nand put his arms around her, rubbed her arms, shoved her face toward his\ncrotch, and tried to physically stop her from walking away. She \u201crepeatedly\ncomplained\u201d to HR, but nothing was done to make it stop, she alleges. In June\n2021, the hostile environment drove her to quit.\n\nHicks also witnessed sexual harassment. In a legal filing, he said that in an\ninternal group-messaging platform used by all employees, including management,\nan employee wrote, \u201cI need a hug from a cute redhead girl\u201d and \u201c1st floor\nneeds to be heated. My skin is as dry as a lesbian\u2019s tongue.\u201d Only one woman,\nwho had red hair and identified as a lesbian, worked on their team. It made\nher \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d Hicks told me. But he never saw anyone do anything about\nit. \u201cThat said to me that this behavior is welcome,\u201d he said.\n\nSo Hicks complained to HR. \u201cI\u2019m a guy who speaks up about what I see,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI\u2019m big on doing what\u2019s right.\u201d Plus, he added, every warehouse had a\nbanner telling employees that if they saw something, they should say\nsomething.\n\nAfter Hicks complained, his supervisor \u201csabotaged\u201d his ability to get\npromoted, he told me, giving him a \u201cneeds improvement\u201d review for offering\n\u201cfeedback\u201d in January 2021 in what Hicks alleges was retaliation. That review\nblocked his attempts to advance; he eventually resigned. \u201cThey were trying to\nmake me not want to work there anymore, and it worked,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s a popping company. There\u2019s a sense of pride,\u201d Hicks said. But \u201cno one\nis really asking the questions on what goes into actually producing this\nproduct.\u201d\n\nThe lack of accountability at Tesla has also resulted in such a severe neglect\nof safety standards that, workers say, their employer routinely puts them at\nrisk. Paul (who asked to use a pseudonym because he\u2019s involved in a workers\u2019\ncompensation case against Tesla) started at the Fremont factory in early 2022.\nHe had been working as a mental health counselor, a job he was passionate\nabout, but the pay wasn\u2019t enough for him to put money away in savings. At\nTesla, he was assigned to work in the tent attaching subframes to the base of\ncars, some of the hardest work available, along with other mostly Black\ncoworkers. The workers were pressured to go as fast as possible, Paul said. If\nhe and his coworkers didn\u2019t finish their tasks quickly enough, they were moved\nto less desirable and more physically taxing tasks or eventually reassigned to\nanother section. \u201cThese people are continuously pushing us to get out these\ncars,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, you could try to speed up,\u201d but that means \u201cwe\u2019re\nputting ourselves at even more danger.\u201d\n\nThen Paul\u2019s daily discomfort turned to acute pain. His job was to screw in two\nbolts to secure the subframe to the car, using a torque wrench that hung from\nthe ceiling. He was told to stabilize the wrench with his body, Paul said.\nThis led to a bruise on his lower abdomen; soon, it started to turn into a\nlump. Shifting the position of the wrench to avoid the pain led to a lump on\neach side of his body. Tesla sent him home, and during months of confusion\nabout whether or when he was supposed to return, Paul said, the company didn\u2019t\npay him. He started to fall behind on his bills, so he took out a personal\nloan, which he\u2019s still trying to pay off. \u201cI was really depressed,\u201d he said.\n\nTyonna Turner said in her complaint that she suffered three workplace\ninjuries: a concussion, wrist strain from repetitive motion, and a damaged\nknee and thigh from when a car backed into her. Albert Blakes, who started\nworking at the Fremont factory in September 2019, said in a legal complaint\nalleging racial discrimination that he injured his hand \u201cbecause of the\nphysically demanding work\u201d and, despite repeatedly complaining about the pain\nto his supervisor, was told to keep working; he eventually had to go on leave.\nMoses Sullivan told me that cars came down the line so quickly that workers\ndidn\u2019t always clean up tools and debris. \u201cIt\u2019s fast,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put\nyourself at risk.\u201d\n\nHealth and safety records back up employees\u2019 descriptions of an unsafe\nworkplace. According to a review of OSHA records by The Nation, the agency\nfound 80 violations related to Tesla\u2019s auto manufacturing between January 2019\nand February 2024, for which the agency levied a cumulative $525,020 in fines.\nCompanies routinely dispute OSHA fines, and Tesla has succeeded in reducing\nthat total by $53,395. Last December, the company was hit with $38,000 in\nproposed fines from California\u2019s Division of Occupational Safety and Health,\nor Cal/OSHA, for four safety violations after an employee was seriously\ninjured by getting stuck in a car.\n\nIn June 2019, an employee in Fremont using a pallet jack turned into an eight-\nfoot blind spot created by a shelving unit. He rear-ended a dolly and\nfractured his tibia, requiring surgery. In November 2021, an employee at the\nplant fell more than 20 feet from a second-story mezzanine. He fractured his\njaw, suffered contusions on his knee and elbow, and broke 13 teeth.\n\nSafety problems have been occurring frequently at Tesla\u2019s factories since at\nleast 2014. Between 2014 and 2018, according to a review by Forbes, Cal/OSHA\nfined the company a cumulative $236,730 for 54 violations. The violations and\nfines \u201cdwarfed\u201d those levied by state inspectors against 10 other large auto\nmanufacturing plants, according to Forbes, including ones owned by BMW, Ford,\nGM, and Nissan, even when taking Tesla\u2019s bigger workforce into account. In\n2015 and 2016, Tesla\u2019s injury rate was significantly higher than the average\nfor the industry. The company touted that it had gotten the rate down to the\naverage in 2017, but in 2018 it shot up again.\n\nThe employee training the company offers is \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d Reveal\nreported in its investigation. Turley told me she was never taught how to do\nher job and only shown videos that included a history of the plant and\ninformation about Tesla, but nothing about the work she would be doing. \u201cYou\npretty much have to learn from the people that\u2019s in there,\u201d she said. Cleon\nWaters also said in his filing that he was never given any training for his\njob assembling parts of car motors. California safety regulators cited Tesla\neight times for deficient training between 2013 and 2018.\n\nWhistleblower: Carlos Hicks reported the racial and sexual harassment he saw\nat the Sparks, Nevada, plant.\n\nAuto manufacturing is difficult work, and people get injured at all plants.\nSuch male-dominated workplaces are no strangers to sexual harassment. But\nother auto giants have rules and processes that keep the injury rates lower\nand are intended to squash discrimination before it becomes entrenched. One\nreason for that is the presence of unions: Workers at the Big Three\nautomakers\u2014Ford, GM, and Stellantis, which makes Chryslers and Jeeps\u2014are\nrepresented by the United Auto Workers. None of Tesla\u2019s six US factories are\nunionized. After the UAW\u2019s historic wins last year in its contract\nnegotiations with the Big Three, the union vowed to organize nonunion auto\nplants in the United States, including Tesla\u2019s.\n\nBut it\u2019s been tried before. In the summer of 2016, a group of Tesla employees\ncreated an organizing committee in coordination with the UAW to try to\nunionize the Fremont plant. Richard Ortiz, one of the lead organizers, had\nworked at NUMMI, a unionized plant, doing the same job he did at Tesla, and\nwas paid \u201ca lot more money\u201d than he made at Tesla, he told More Perfect Union\nin 2022\u2014$30 to $35 an hour. At Tesla, he said, employees made about $20 an\nhour, including premium pay. They had to work 12-hour shifts, six days a week.\nHe and other workers were also worried about safety, but when they brought up\ntheir concerns, the company \u201cdidn\u2019t really\u201d respond. \u201cWe\u2019re not disposable,\u201d\nOrtiz said. \u201cWe\u2019re human beings. We matter.\u201d\n\nTesla launched an aggressive counteroffensive against their organizing. The\nNational Labor Relations Board found that management coercively interrogated\nOrtiz three times. In a 2017 memo to employees, Musk called the UAW\u2019s\norganizing tactics \u201cdisingenuous or outright false\u201d and promised workers\nfrozen yogurt stations and a roller coaster. Ortiz was fired in October 2017\nalong with hundreds of other workers\u2014part of an effort, they allege, to\nreplace pro-union employees with temps. Then, in May 2018, Musk tweeted that\n\u201cvoting union\u201d would mean \u201cgiv[ing] up stock options.\u201d\n\nThe employees, along with the UAW, filed unfair-labor-practice charges against\nthe company with the NLRB, arguing that the actions violated the organizing\nprotections enshrined in the National Labor Relations Act. In March 2023, a\npanel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that Tesla had engaged in\nillegal anti-union activity and ordered Musk to delete the tweet and the\ncompany to offer Ortiz reinstatement and back pay. Tesla then requested an en\nbanc review of the decision, which is still pending. In the meantime, Ortiz\nstill doesn\u2019t have a job at Tesla, and Musk\u2019s tweet is still up.\n\nOther employees have levied charges against the company. The NLRB found merit\nin two workers\u2019 allegations that the company engaged in illegal union-busting\nat its Buffalo factory. Tesla also faces open charges of refusing to reinstate\nat least one employee who went on strike in Nashville, Tennessee; retaliating\nagainst a worker who was organizing in Tampa, Florida; and using a variety of\nanti-union tactics in Austin, Texas.\n\nSince she left Tesla, Turley is back to doing hair, and she\u2019s earning decent\nmoney. But the experience has left a mark on her. \u201cIt most definitely made my\nnerves bad and made me aware of my surroundings,\u201d she told me. If she\ninterviews for a job and gets the sense that she might be exposed to a similar\nenvironment, she walks away. She\u2019s sworn off working on a factory line or even\nin a warehouse.\n\nOne of Turley\u2019s daughters wanted to work at Tesla recently\u2014the pay is good,\nafter all. Turley told her she couldn\u2019t do it. She swears she would never work\nthere again. \u201cI\u2019ll never go back,\u201d she said. \u201cI even ain\u2019t buying no Tesla.\u201d\n\nKeep Reading\n\n  * Submit a correction\n  * Send a letter to the editor\n  * Reprints & permissions\n\n## Thank you for reading The Nation!\n\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
