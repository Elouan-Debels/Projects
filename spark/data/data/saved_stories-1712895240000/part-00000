Wu\n\nSusanne Foitzik / Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz\n\nMay 18, 2021\n\nDeep in the forests of Germany, nestled neatly into the hollowed-out shells of\nacorns, live a smattering of ants who have stumbled upon a fountain of youth.\nThey are born workers, but do not do much work. Their days are spent\nlollygagging about the nest, where their siblings shower them with gifts of\nfood. They seem to elude the ravages of old age, retaining a durably\nadolescent physique, their outer shells soft and their hue distinctively\ntawny. Their scent, too, seems to shift, wafting out an alluring perfume that\nendears them to others. While their sisters, who have nearly identical\ngenomes, perish within months of being born, these death-defying insects live\non for years and years and years.\n\nThey are Temnothorax ants, and their elixirs of life are the tapeworms that\nteem within their bellies\u2014parasites that paradoxically prolong the life of\ntheir host at a strange and terrible cost.\n\nA few such life-lengthening partnerships have been documented between microbes\nand insects such as wasps, beetles, and mosquitoes. But what these ants\nexperience is more extreme than anything that\u2019s come before, says Susanne\nFoitzik, an entomologist at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, in Germany,\nwho studies the ants and their tapeworms. Infected Temnothorax ants live at\nleast three times longer than their siblings, and perhaps much more, she and\nher colleagues report in a study published today in Royal Society Open\nScience. No one is yet sure when the insects\u2019 longevity tops out, but the\nanswer is probably in excess of a decade, approaching or even matching that of\nant queens, who can survive up to 20 years.\n\n\u201cSome other parasites do extend life spans,\u201d Shelley Adamo, a parasite expert\nat Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia, who was not involved in the study,\ntold me. \u201cBut not like this.\u201d\n\nUnder typical circumstances, Temnothorax ants live as most other ants do. They\nreside in communities ruled by a single fertile queen attended by a legion of\nworkers whose professional lives take a predictable trajectory. They first\ntend the queen\u2019s eggs as nurses, then graduate into foraging roles that take\nthem outside the nest. Apart from the whole freaky parasite thing, \u201cthey are\npretty boring,\u201d Foitzik told me.\n\nNormalcy goes out the door, however, when Temnothorax larvae ingest tapeworm-\negg-infested bird feces trucked in by foragers. The parasites hatch and set up\npermanent residence in the young ants\u2019 abdomens, where they can access a\nsteady stream of nutrients. In return, they offer their host an unconventional\nrenter\u2019s fee: an extra-long life span that Foitzik and her colleagues managed\nto record in real time.\n\nRead: How the zombie fungus takes over ants\u2019 bodies to control their minds.\n\nThe researchers spent three years monitoring dozens of Temnothorax colonies in\nthe lab, comparing the fates of workers who\u2019d fallen prey to the parasites and\nthose who remained infection-free. By the end of their experiment, almost\nevery single one of the hundreds of worm-free workers had, unsurprisingly,\ndied. But more than half the parasitized workers were still kicking\u2014about the\nsame proportion as the colonies\u2019 ultra-long-lived queens. \u201cThat was amazing to\nsee,\u201d Biplabendu Das, an ant biologist and parasite expert at the University\nof Central Florida, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told me. And despite\ntheir old age, the ants\u2019 bodies still bore the hallmarks of youth. They were\ndifficult to distinguish from uninfected nurses, who are usually the most\njuvenile members of the colony\u2019s working class.\n\nThe tapeworm-laden ants didn\u2019t just outlive their siblings, the team found.\nThey were coddled while they did it. They spent their days lounging in their\nnest, performing none of the tasks expected of workers. They were groomed,\nfed, and carried by their siblings, often receiving more attention than even\nthe queen\u2014unheard of in a typical ant society\u2014and gave absolutely nothing in\nreturn.\n\nThe deal the ants have cut with their parasites seems, at first pass, pretty\ncushy. Foitzik told me that her team couldn\u2019t find any overt downsides to life\nas an infected ant, a finding that appears to shatter the standard paradigm of\nparasitism. Even the colonies as a whole remained largely intact. Workers\ncontinued to work; queens continued to lay eggs. The threads that held each\nTemnothorax society together seemed unmussed.\n\nOnly when the researchers took a closer look did that tapestry begin to\nunravel. The uninfected workers in parasitized colonies, they realized, were\nlaboring harder. Strained by the additional burden of their wormed-up\nnestmates, they seemed to be shunting care away from their queen. They were\ndying sooner than they might have if the colonies had remained parasite-free.\nAt the community level, the ants were exhibiting signs of stress, and the\nparasite\u2019s true tax was, at last, starting to show. \u201cThe cost is in the\ndivision of labor,\u201d Das said. The worms were tapping into not just \u201cindividual\n[ant] physiology, but also social interactions,\u201d Farrah Bashey-Visser, a\nparasitologist at Indiana University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told\nme.\n\nRead: Life is tough for teenage parasites.\n\nScientists think of social insects not as single bugs, but as interlaced parts\nof a giant \u201csuperorganism,\u201d Manuela Ramalho, an ant biologist at Cornell\nUniversity, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told me. When one individual\nacts, others around it react; in a colony, no ant can truly act alone.\nParasites of these communities automatically extend their reach to multiple\nanimals at once, a rippling mind-control effect that spreads and amplifies the\nconsequences of infection. Although the tapeworms had infected only a fraction\nof the Temnothorax workers, they were puppeteering the entire society.\n\nThat altered existence might play directly into the parasite\u2019s hands.\nTapeworms of these species can\u2019t mature into adults and produce eggs until\ntheir ant host is consumed by a bird\u2014a fate that insects in full possession of\ntheir faculties try to avoid. But ants who spend all their time lazing around\nthe house make for easy prey; hosts who are pampered and long-lived have a\nhigh chance of surviving until they\u2019re eaten. The worm\u2019s most ingenious move\nmight play out in some ants\u2019 final moments, as they trade their natural fear\nof intruders for a dollop of ennui. When Foitzik and her students crack open\ninfected Temnothorax colonies, the parasitized workers do little more than\nstare expectantly skyward. \u201cEveryone else is just taking the larvae and\nrunning,\u201d Foitzik said. \u201cThe infected workers are just like, Oh, what\u2019s going\non?\u201d\n\nDown to the molecular level, the parasite is pulling the strings. Sara Beros,\nFoitzik\u2019s former doctoral student and the paper\u2019s first author, told me she\nhas split open Temnothorax abdomens and counted up to 70 tapeworms inside.\nFrom there, the worms can unleash a slurry of proteins and chemicals that futz\nwith the ant\u2019s core physiology, likely impacting their host\u2019s hormones, immune\nsystem, and genes. What they achieve appears to be a rough pantomime of how\nant queens attain their mind-boggling life span, a feat humans still don\u2019t\nunderstand. (The tapeworms\u2019 grasp of ant aging is far more advanced than\nours.) The parasites are effectively flash-freezing their host into a\npreserved state\u2014one that will up their own chances of survival, and help\nguarantee that their species lives on.\n\nThe worms\u2019 MO is subtle and ingenious. They are agents not of disaster, but of\nan insidious social sickness that sets reality only slightly, barely\nperceptibly, askew. Infected workers get a taste of invincibility and status,\nswaddling themselves in youth and the benefits it brings. They also form\nresource sinks that sap the energy of those around them. They become echoes of\nthe microorganisms they harbor. They are, in the end, parasites themselves.\n\nKatherine J. Wu is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
