That's an advert. Paused a video? That's an advert\n\nMatthew Connatser\n\nWed 17 Apr 2024 // 18:15 UTC\n\nRoku TVs of the future may throw up targeted ads on the screen whenever you\npause a video.\n\nA Roku-assigned patent application, filed in the US as 20230388589A1 and\ntitled \"HDMI customized ad insertion,\" outlines a fairly convoluted system\nthat ultimately shows adverts on your telly or some other display whenever\nsome kind of pause in playback is detected.\n\nThe proposed patent, published at the end of last year and spotted now,\ndescribes a display device that can show advertising after identifying a pause\nin the video content from an HDMI-connected media device.\n\nCrucially, it says the display and media hardware can be the same device, ie:\na smart TV like that from Roku. There are two ways of looking at this design:\nA way for standalone televisions, monitors, and projectors to show their own\nads during a pause, and a way for integrated smart displays to do the same.\n\nThis would presumably also mean ads can run in the middle of a gaming session\nor a video being played via a PC, if the monitor or TV in use were to adopt\nthis tech.\n\nRoku even helpfully attached a flow chart to the patent application that\noutlines all the cases where an ad would be played. These include not only the\ndetection of a pause button press but also instances where the TV infers a\npause from various criteria.\n\nThese criteria include checking whether new frames are being created, if\nthere's any audio, and even if a pause symbol is on the screen. In those\ninstances, the TV or display will then begin serving an ad that goes right on\ntop of whatever is on the screen.\n\nThe patent does not specify whether these ads will be in the form of still\nimages, audio, or video, though Roku does detail that they will be served\nbased on whatever content is playing on the screen. The patent details lots of\nways it will analyze content to determine what ad to show, such as video\nmetadata, watermarks, and the audio. Checking the source device and even the\nsoftware application running are options too, perhaps coming in handy when the\ndevice in question is a gaming console or some other purpose-made device with\na specific name.\n\n  * Roku makes 2FA mandatory for all after nearly 600K accounts pwned\n  * Lawsuit claims Meta hobbled Facebook Watch to help Netflix\n  * Dumping us into ad tier of Prime Video when we paid for ad-free is 'unfair' \u2013 lawsuit\n  * Netflix to crack down on account sharing, offer ad-laden cheaper options\n\nThe draft patent never mentions artificial intelligence when discussing\ncontent recognition, so its detection may be pretty rudimentary. However,\nsince the TV likely has to communicate with some outside server to get the ad,\nany AI-powered part of the process may be done in the cloud away from this\ndesign seeking patent protection.\n\nWhile this kind of ad injection isn't something that currently happens with\nsmart TVs, it's technically already possible. Back in 2015, Samsung\naccidentally set its Australian TVs to play muted Pepsi commercials over and\nover on top of movies played through Plex Media Server. Although the ads were\nclearly a bug, it does indicate that Samsung was working on something similar\nto what is outlined in the Roku patent.\n\nOf course, this is all at the patent application stage, it may never happened,\nand plenty of patents never make it to actual products. We've asked Roku to\ncomment on whether the feature could become reality. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * IoT\n  * Television\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * IoT\n  * Television\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * Firmware\n  * Star Trek\n\n#### More about\n\n6 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * IoT\n  * Television\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * IoT\n  * Television\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * Firmware\n  * Star Trek\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Qualcomm and Qt partner to supercharge UI development for IoT devices\n\nPlus: Qualy punts a 'micro-power' Wi-Fi system for the industrial kit\n\nSystems8 days |\n\n#### YouTube now sabotages ad-blocking apps that stream its vids\n\nEFF lambastes latest 'lazy and deliberately malicious move'\n\nApplications24 hrs | 54\n\n#### CISA in a flap as Chirp smart door locks can be trivially unlocked\nremotely\n\nHard-coded credentials last thing you want in home security app\n\nSecurity2 days | 49\n\n#### Reducing the cloud security overhead\n\nWhy creating a layered defensive strategy that includes security by design can\nhelp address cloud challenges\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Meta accused of snarfing people's Snapchat data via traffic decryption\n\nI ain't afraid of no ghosts, but in this case...\n\nPersonal Tech21 days | 20\n\n#### How to improve Chinese TV?
