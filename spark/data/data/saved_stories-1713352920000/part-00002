High Voltage! \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nJaan Juurikas April 16, 2024\n\nSubscribe | Advertise | Upgrade\n\n\u275d\n\nInformation wants to be free.\n\nThis is the maxim that I\u2019ve built the whole EV Universe on.\n\nMy goal today is simple: give you the best-detailed overview of 2023 EV sales\nglobally that you can get anywhere, without you having to spend thousands of\ndollars to get it. Any dollars, for that matter.\n\nSee, that\u2019s my big issue nowadays. The information we need sits out there\nready for taking and making sense of it. But it is all so fragmented, or stuck\nbehind hefty paywalls.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to see the big picture if you don\u2019t spend 24/7\nmonitoring all EV news. And all this makes it easier for the clickbait FUD\nheadlines to spread.\n\nThere are a few good teams out there putting together this kind of data. And I\nappreciate them. But they are, naturally, selling these insights only\nbusiness-to-business. That comes with a price tag only the bigger companies\ncan pay. Whereas I...\n\nI am but a common EV geek.\n\nI can\u2019t budget a $4.5k/year to $10k/year subscription for this research and\nall its benefits. Neither can most enthusiasts and businesses in the EV space.\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nLeft with no other choice, I took this matter into my own hands.\n\nI\u2019ve managed to track down 10,311,976 battery-electric vehicle sales across 57\ncountries in 2023 right here. I estimate that it is over 99% of all EV sales.\n\nWe\u2019ve got nearly all of Europe. We\u2019ve got US and China, Australia and New\nZealand. We\u2019ve even got countries like Thailand, Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia,\nPeru, India, Japan.\n\nThis took me days upon days to put together. If you want to support my work,\nyou can:\n\n  1.

Drop a few kWh in this high-voltage Tip Jar \u26a1\ufe0f that I just made.\n\nThank you. Now, come and dig in with me.\n\nWords: 4,087 | Graphs: 9 | Time to read: 10-15 min | Feeling: we\u2019re so back\n\n### RESOURCES:\n\nInsights all below, and in the same article online. Visuals below, but I also\nuploaded them on Google Drive here. Numbers: all in this Google spreadsheet.\nAll the sources are linked to in the Column U.\n\nIncluded:Only battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). This is what we call \u201cEV\u201d\nhere.Only new 4-wheeled light-duty vehicles. That\u2019s passenger cars, SUVs,\npickup trucks and light vans.| Excluded:Nothing here with a combustion engine.\nNo plug-in hybrids here. (I don\u2019t do PHEVs, here\u2019s why).No medium- and heavy-\nduty vehicles here, and no 2- and 3-wheelers  \n---|---  \n  \nReady to zoom into the EV Universe?\n\n10,311,976 battery-electric vehicles were sold in the world in 2023. I\u2019d\nestimate about 100k more were sold in reality, but I haven\u2019t been able to\ntrack those down yet.\n\n34.7% is how much EV sales grew globally in 2023, compared to 2022.\n\nPer the best estimate for all car sales I\u2019ve found so far, these 10.3M EVs\nwould make up 11.45% of all 90.1M light-duty vehicles sold in the world. So\nglobally, we also reached a major milestone:\n\nEvery 9th car to hit the roads of the Earth in 2023 was fully electric!\n\nLet that settle in for a moment. Isn\u2019t it crazy how far we\u2019ve come?\n\nThe top three best-selling EVs globally in 2023 were:\n\n  1. Tesla Model Y: 1,212,601\n\n  2. Tesla Model 3: 529,287\n\n  3. BYD Yuan Plus: 418,994\n\nNow, for a moment let\u2019s look at the past decade or so to witness how fast it\nall happened. The period I like to call the \u201cModern Era of EVs\u201d.\n\n## EV sales growth 2010-2023 globally\n\n7,657,277 EVs were sold in 2022, and then EVs took up 9.45% of the overall 81M\ncar sales. And before that... well I\u2019ll let this graph I made do the talking:\n\nHere are a few things I found mapping this out:\n\n  * The EV sales have increased 53 times within just 10 years.\n\n  * Just 13 years ago, there were 7,200 EVs sold globally the whole year, now the same amount of EVs are sold every six hours!\n\n  * Does all this look like EVs are doomed to you?\n\n## EV sales in 2023 per region\n\nOk, so let\u2019s start breaking the data down. This is how the 10.3M EV sales of\n2023 was distributed:\n\n60.7% in China: every 4^th car sold was an EV. 19.6% in Europe: every 6-7th\ncar sold was an EV. 11.5% in the US: every 13th car sold was an EV. 8.2%\nelsewhere: every 42nd car sold was an EV.\n\nThe EV future is already here. It is just unevenly distributed.\n\nThis year I decided to break all the EV sales down for you looking at the\ndifferent milestones reached.
