If you are from most nations in the global north, there\u2019s probably\nstill plenty of time to make arrangements. But, according to our analysis,\ncitizens from 132 of the 134 countries in the global south need a visa to\nvisit the United States, whereas this is true for people from only 20 of the\n61 countries in the global north. (See Supplementary information for how we\ndesignated global south countries.) And obtaining those visas is not\nstraightforward: as of 4 April, the next available appointment at the US\nconsulate in New Delhi, India, is not until October. It\u2019s February 2025 at the\nconsulate in Cotonou, Benin, and March 2026 in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\n\nIt\u2019s not just trips to the United States that are problematic. Scholars from\nthe global south face obstacles when travelling to many hotspots for\nscientific research, which include Canada, Japan and most European countries.\nBy contrast, citizens from more than 80% of countries in the global north need\nno visa to go to Germany or Japan.\n\nScientists have most impact when they\u2019re free to move\n\nVisa costs are higher for people in economically weak countries than for those\nliving elsewhere^1. Citizens of southern Asia must pay almost US$59, on\naverage, for a tourist visa to another country \u2014 equivalent to 2 weeks of work\nfor an average earner in this region. Those in sub-Saharan Africa pay $52,\nequating to 3 weeks\u2019 work. Yet citizens in Western Europe pay less than $18,\non average, which could be equivalent to less than an hour\u2019s work.\n\nOn arrival in some countries, people travelling from the global south might\nalso have to show months of financial statements and prove that they have\nreceived particular vaccinations. They might be denied entry despite meeting\nthese requirements.\n\nCitizenship privilege is an asset experienced by citizens of the global north,\nsimply because of the country they were born in (see \u2018Unearned advantages\u2019).\nAs with other forms of privilege, people without it can experience safety\nconcerns and feelings of distress, anxiety, uncertainty and inadequacy^2 \u2014 in\naddition to the bureaucratic difficulties. This inequity affects many\nresearchers. It\u2019s time that academics take action to rebalance the scales.\n\n### Unearned advantages\n\nAs a US-born citizen, one of us (T.J.) is privileged by her citizenship. The\nother (M.C.), born in the global south, lacks this privilege. Here are four of\nmany privileges \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 that neither of us has earned (see\ngo.nature.com/3vjkmbu).\n\n\u2022 I am (not) able to travel to most countries on short notice.\n\n\u2022 I do (not) need to provide evidence of my intent to return home, my travel\nhistory dating back ten years or the fact that I have the financial means to\nsupport myself.\n\n\u2022 I do (not) have to fear being deported by border control because of my race,\nethnicity, language differences, travel history, other cultural barriers or\nconcerns that I am a national-security threat.\n\n\u2022 I do (not) have to worry about travelling to my home country to renew or\nextend my lawful visa status, or about how visa rejection might hamper my\ncareer.\n\n## Mobility opens up careers\n\nThe expectation that researchers will travel and work internationally is baked\ninto academia. For example, a study of more than 40,000 advertisements for\nresearch positions on a European job platform showed that more than 60% listed\nmobility as a desirable attribute^3. This preference stems from the idea that\nmobile researchers are more productive and have better skills and networks\nthan their less-mobile counterparts, making them more competitive in a fierce\njob market^4^,^5. Governments, funding agencies and research universities\npromote mobility in the hope that it will build research capacity and boost\neconomies^6.\n\nThe pressure to move abroad to build a competitive career is often highest for\nearly-career researchers^4. Consider short-term postdoctoral fellowship awards\nfrom prestigious organizations, such as the European Commission\u2019s Marie\nSk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions, the Human Frontier Science Program and the European\nMolecular Biology Organization (EMBO). These all require applicants to leave\nthe country where they earned their PhD and take a position elsewhere, but the\nchances for citizens of the global south to work in another global south\ncountry are limited. Applicants must instead typically move to the United\nStates or particular European countries.\n\nMost international meetings are located in the same few countries. An analysis\nof global health conferences held between 1997 and 2019, for instance, found\nthat 71% took place in high-income countries, with 31% in the United States\nalone^7.\n\nTogether, these factors make travel and migration beneficial for researchers\u2019\ncareers \u2014 especially if that movement is to or between global north countries.\nIndeed, one study indicates that 82% of researchers who move between countries\nfor their first postdoc are destined for the global north^8. The United States\nis the most common destination, but the United Kingdom, Germany and\nSwitzerland are also popular^8^,^9.\n\nEven after a move, academics from the global south remain at a disadvantage.\nForeign researchers are more likely to face bullying and harassment from\nmentors than are domestic researchers, and they are less likely to report it\nbecause of the threat that their visa will not be renewed. Visa inequity can\ncause anxiety, stress and depression^10. All foreign nationals on visas are\nvulnerable, but scholars who have identities that make them susceptible to\nencountering intersecting forms of discrimination are at a greater\ndisadvantage and thus in a more precarious position.\n\n## Close the gaps\n\nSix steps can help to redress the balance.\n\nUniversities should educate their employees about citizenship privilege, to\nhelp reduce hiring biases. Institutional leaders should advocate for change\nand ensure that their human-resource and international-service offices are\nstaffed by people who understand citizenship privilege and the lived\nexperiences of immigrants. This would help immigrant scholars facing language\nbarriers, financial pressures, homesickness and cultural shock^11.\n\nWhy the mental cost of a STEM career can be too high for women and people of\ncolour\n\nAcademic institutions should help students and researchers to offload visa\npaperwork to trained administrative staff. Too often, institutions assist\nincoming international scholars with visa sponsorships, but leave academics\nwho are already in a post to fend for themselves when it comes to visa\nrenewals or complications. Institutions should establish safeguarding\nframeworks to prevent bullying. And they should lobby for and adopt visa types\nthat provide researchers with stability, flexibility and safety \u2014 skilled-\nworker visas instead of short-term ones, for example.\n\nConference organizers should hold international meetings in global south\ncountries where visas are not needed, or where visa processing is fast and\ninexpensive, such as Cambodia, Rwanda or Ecuador. Affordability should be a\nconsideration, because currency differences can make conferences in the global\nnorth unaffordable for researchers from low- and middle-income countries.\n\nResearchers should be given at least six months\u2019 notice of conferences, and\norganizers should help participants to apply for visas by issuing invitation\nletters and communicating with embassies. Some of these changes are already\nbeing implemented \u2014 for instance, the joint meeting held by the American\nSociety for Cell Biology and EMBO has started to expedite abstract reviews and\nissue customized visa invitation letters to conference attendees.\n\nOrganizers should offer lower registration fees for scholars from visa-\nunderprivileged countries, which they could calculate using a country\u2019s per\ncapita income or the Henley Passport Index, which ranks countries according to\nthe number of nations to which their citizens can travel visa-free (see\n\u2018Global mobility divide\u2019). Organizers should also set aside funds to award\nmore travel grants to researchers from low-income countries, and make those\ngrants larger. All conferences should include virtual options to increase\ninternational attendance.\n\nLastly, early-career researchers from visa-underprivileged countries must\nroutinely be included in conference organizing and institutional leadership\ncommittees, expanding the pool of decision makers to bring diverse immigrant\nperspectives to the table.\n\nSome might argue that the world\u2019s scientific output is already becoming less\ncentred on the global north, negating the need for these steps. It is true\nthat global south countries such as India, China, South Africa and the United\nArab Emirates are publishing more papers and producing more science graduates\nthan ever (see, for example, Nature 620, S2\u2013S5; 2023). However, most\ngatekeepers of knowledge, such as journal editors and reviewers, are located\nin the global north^12.\n\nBeyond perpetuating a global divide, citizenship privilege intersects with\nother biases that favour cisgender, white and male researchers. The\nprofessoriate in global north countries such as the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom remains predominantly white. Some countries\u2019 policy choices\npose immense challenges to making academia more equitable, including the US\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision to end race as a considering factor in admissions,\nand US subnational policies that limit access to gender-affirming care and\ncreate a hostile environment for global immigration. Lowering mobility\nbarriers is a key step in driving change.\n\nNature 628, 499-501 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01080-x\n\n## References\n\n  1.
