Conventional\n> evaluation methods, typically designed primarily for LLM development, yield\n> numerical scores that ignore the user experience. Therefore, our study\n> shifts the focus from model-centered to human-centered evaluation in the\n> context of AI-powered writing assistance applications. Our proposed metric,\n> termed ``Revision Distance,'' utilizes LLMs to suggest revision edits that\n> mimic the human writing process. It is determined by counting the revision\n> edits generated by LLMs. Benefiting from the generated revision edit\n> details, our metric can provide a self-explained text evaluation result in a\n> human-understandable manner beyond the context-independent score. Our\n> results show that for the easy-writing task, ``Revision Distance'' is\n> consistent with established metrics (ROUGE, Bert-score, and GPT-score), but\n> offers more insightful, detailed feedback and better distinguishes between\n> texts. Moreover, in the context of challenging academic writing tasks, our\n> metric still delivers reliable evaluations where other metrics tend to\n> struggle. Furthermore, our metric also holds significant potential for\n> scenarios lacking reference texts.\n\nComments:| 9 pages, 2 figures, under review  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Information Retrieval (cs.IR)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.07108 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.07108v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07108arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jiawei Liu [view email] [v1] Wed, 10 Apr 2024 15:46:08 UTC (392 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled From Model-centered to Human-Centered: Revision\nDistance as a Metric for Text Evaluation in LLMs-based Applications, by\nYongqiang Ma and 7 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.IR\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
