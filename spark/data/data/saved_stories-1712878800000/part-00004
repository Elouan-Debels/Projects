Now\nNASA engineers have identified the fault and found a potential workaround.\n\nAn artist's illustration of Voyager 1 with its antenna pointed back at Earth.\n(Image credit: NASA/JPL)\n\nFor the past five months, the Voyager 1 spacecraft has been sending a steady\nstream of unreadable gibberish back to Earth. Now, NASA engineers finally know\nwhy.\n\nThe 46-year-old spacecraft sends regular radio signals as it drifts further\nfrom our solar system. But in November 2023, the signals suddenly became\ngarbled, meaning scientists were unable to read any of its data, and they were\nleft mystified about the fault's origins.\n\nIn March, NASA engineers sent a command prompt, or \"poke,\" to the craft to get\na readout from its flight data subsystem (FDS) \u2014 which packages Voyager 1's\nscience and engineering data before beaming it back to Earth.\n\nAfter decoding the spacecraft's response, the engineers have found the source\nof the problem: The FDS's memory has been corrupted.\n\nRelated: NASA's Voyager 1 sends readable message to Earth after 4 nail-biting\nmonths of gibberish\n\n\"The team suspects that a single chip responsible for storing part of the\naffected portion of the FDS memory isn't working,\" NASA said in a blog post\nWednesday (March 13). \"Engineers can't determine with certainty what caused\nthe issue. Two possibilities are that the chip could have been hit by an\nenergetic particle from space or that it simply may have worn out after 46\nyears.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014NASA hears 'heartbeat' signal from Voyager 2 probe a week after losing\ncontact\n\n\u2014Historic space photo of the week: Voyager 2 spies a storm on Saturn 42 years\nago\n\n\u2014NASA reestablishes full contact with Voyager 2 probe after nail-biting 2-week\nblackout\n\nAlthough it may take several months, the engineers say they can find a\nworkaround to run the FDS without the fried chip \u2014 restoring the spacecraft's\nmessaging output and enabling it to continue to send readable information from\noutside our solar system.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nLaunched in 1977, Voyager 1 zipped past Saturn and Jupiter in 1979 and 1980\nbefore flying out into interstellar space in 2012. It is now recording the\nconditions outside of the sun's protective magnetic field, or heliosphere,\nwhich blankets our solar system.\n\nVoyager 1 is currently more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from\nEarth, and it takes 22.5 hours for any radio signal to travel from the craft\nto our planet.\n\nBen Turner\n\nStaff Writer\n\nBen Turner is a U.K. based staff writer at Live Science.

And in the odd\nchance that the wrong person reads this post before both posts are deleted\nthen let us hope that they do not screenshot it or remember it. What he is\ninquiring about was the ultimate destruction of a specific video game in which\neven the professional legit community and the non legit hacker community came\ntogether to stand up against underclocking and it was still not successful. So\nif two opposing sides Joint Forces and it still does no good- then you can\nunderstand the severity of what I know and why I prefer to keep my mouth shut\nand my virtual mouth shut.\n\nReply\n\n  * SkidWard\n\nJust cut the % of ram needed... skip the bad sectors\n\nReply\n\n  * kloudykat\n\nFDS = fl1ght da1a sub5ystem5\n\nReply\n\n  * 5ft24dave\n\nThis is pretty old news, like 6 months old.
