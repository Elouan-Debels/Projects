But that won't stop people from repeating the quote.)\n\nBryan Lunduke\n\nApril 07, 2024\n\nThe year is 1981. A young Bill Gates takes the stage at a computer conference.\n\nIn that speech, he utters one of the most famous quotes in all of computing:\n\n> \"640K ought to be enough for anybody!\"\n\nThere's a few teensy-tiny problems with that story:\n\n  1. Nobody can remember what computer conference this might have been at.\n  2. Nor if the year was even 1981.\n  3. Not a single soul, on Earth, appears to have actually heard this quote first hand.\n  4. Likewise, there are many disagreements on what the exact words were... it could have been \"640K is more memory than anyone will ever need\" or something like that.\n\nThere's also the inconvenient fact that Bill Gates, himself, denies ever\nhaving said it. Here is one such denial, from a 1996 piece on \"Career\nOpportunities in Computing\":\n\n> \"I've said some stupid things and some wrong things, but not that. No one\n> involved in computers would ever say that a certain amount of memory is\n> enough for all time.\n>\n> The need for memory increases as computers get more potent and software gets\n> more powerful. In fact, every couple of years the amount of memory address\n> space needed to run whatever software is mainstream at the time just about\n> doubles. This is well-known.\n>\n> When IBM introduced its PC in 1981, many people attacked Microsoft for its\n> role. These critics said that 8-bit computers, which had 64K of address\n> space, would last forever. They said we were wastefully throwing out great\n> 8-bit programming by moving the world toward 16-bit computers.\n>\n> We at Microsoft disagreed. We knew that even 16-bit computers, which had\n> 640K of available address space, would be adequate for only four or five\n> years. (The IBM PC had 1 megabyte of logical address space. But 384K of this\n> was assigned to special purposes, leaving 640K of memory available. That's\n> where the now-infamous \"640K barrier\" came from.)\n>\n> A few years later, Microsoft was a big fan of Intel's 386 microprocessor\n> chip, which gave computers a 32-bit address space.\n>\n> Modern operating systems can now take advantage of that seemingly vast\n> potential memory. But even 32 bits of address space won't prove adequate as\n> time goes on.\n>\n> Meanwhile, I keep bumping into that silly quotation attributed to me that\n> says 640K of memory is enough. There's never a citation; the quotation just\n> floats like a rumor, repeated again and again.\"\n\nSo, did Bill Gates actually make that famous \"640k\" quote?\n\nPretty darned unlikely.\n\nNo witness. Conflicting details. Full denial from Gates.\n\nIn fact, I'd say this is one of the easiest myths to debunk in all of computer\nhistory -- with similar debunkings done by several publications over the last\nfew decades. But that won't stop people from repeating the quote.\n\nEvery day.\n\nUntil the end of time.\n\nAs a wise man once said, \"A lie can travel halfway around the world while The\nLunduke Journal is still putting on its shoes.\"\n\nPictured here: A young Bill Gates, not saying \"640K ought to be enough for\nanybody.\"\n\n### A Parting Thought...\n\nBill Gates has said and done many, many things that are worth mockery. Real\nthings. Not made up things.\n\nMy favorite: In 2015, he tried to convince the world to drink poop water.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nThe Lunduke Journal had debunked many common myths in computer history. Here's\na few others that people (including many Tech Journalists) get wrong far too\noften.\n\n  * The first computer bug was a real moth.\n  * Ada Lovelace was the first computer programmer.\n  * The C++ mascot is not a diseased rat named Keith.\n  * The Palm Pilot / Apple Newton was the first PDA.\n  * Windows 3.1 did not have real multitasking.\n  * The legendary 8008 CPU was designed by Intel.\n  * Blackberry / iPhone was the first smartphone.\n\nJoin the Lunduke Community\n\nTo read more articles like this, sign up and join my community today\n\n29\n\nView All\n\n9\n\nWhat else you may like...\n\nVideos\n\nPodcasts\n\nPosts\n\nArticles\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\n16 hours ago\n\nNew Exclusive Leak: Red Hat CEO states racist hiring goals at company meeting\n\nPlus: Red Hat CEO responds to O'Keefe leaks.\n\n[Originally published on December 22nd, 2023.]\n\n00:04:47\n\n8\n\nView All\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nVideo: Myth - \"HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee\"\n\nThe article: https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5499910/myth-html-was-invented-\nby-tim-berners-lee\n\n00:29:58\n\n20\n\nView All\n\n9\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 09, 2024\n\nThe War on Meritocracy in Tech\n\nTry to leave political leanings at the door on this one.

One key spot to get all of the Tech stories, of every\nkind. And we're giving things a bit of a facelift while we're at it.\n\nIf you've already got a subscription at Lunduke.Locals.com, you're all set.\nYou'll simply now get more content in one spot... and everything will look a\nlittle classier.\n\n### The Long, Long Version\n\nThe Lunduke Journal has grown a great deal over the last few years, with some\nsignficant successes -- publishing some of the biggest stories in the entire\nTech industry... and managing to stay in business without taking a dime from\nBig Tech or advertisers. No small feat (nobody else has done it).\n\nBut, along with those successes, there have been a few missteps along the way.\n\nBecause it's always good to learn from our mistakees... Today, we're going to\nfix those missteps -- to make The Lunduke Journal even more awesome.\n\n### Things That Needed Fixing\n\nThere are 4 key issues that had to be addressed.\n\n  1. The rule of not publishing politically charged content directly to Lunduke.Locals.com has resulted in some of the biggest stories of the year (such as the Red Hat leaks) being seen by far fewer people. For a multitude of reasons.\n  2. Having two different sites (Lunduke.Locals.com and ConservativeNerds.Locals.com) with Computer and Computer Industry related content has proven confusing & cumbersome. This needs to be simpler.\n  3. The multittude of subscription options to The Lunduke Journal has been overwhelming and confusing.\n  4. The original Lunduke Journal logo was difficult to read and recognize at smaller sizes. It also lacked the polish that The Lunduke Journal deserves. Likewise, the design of the video productions also needed some love to make them a bit more professional... in The Lunduke Journal style.\n\nI a nutshell: Things need to be simplified. All articles and videos need to be\navailable in one spot, under one brand. And, while we're at it, everything\nneeds a little spit and polish.\n\n### The Fixes!\n\nAnd that, my nerdy friends, is exactly what we're doing today.\n\nHere's the changes you'll see:\n\n  * All Tech-related articles & videos, no matter how politically charged the topic, will all be published on the same site (Lunduke.Locals.com).\n  * Lunduke.Locals.com will remain politics-free... except for instances where the poltics intersects directly with Computers or the Computer industry.\n  * ConservativeNerds.Locals.com -- which previously hosted all \"politically charged\" Tech articles & videos -- will continue to exist as a place to discuss politics (without the trolls found in so many other social sites).\n  * The Lunduke Journal has a new logo, and new look for video productions.\n  * The options for new subscriptions are being greatly simplified. There will now simply be \"Monthly\" and \"Yearly\" subscription options.\n\nAll of these changes are being implemented now -- including republishing (to\nLunduke.Locals.com) the most critical Tech-related articles which were\npreviously posted only to ConservativeNerds.Locals.com.\n\n### The New Lunduke Journal Branding\n\nThere were a few key goals with the new branding of The Lunduke Journal:\n\n  1. Be easy to read when small.\n  2. Be simple and text-focused.\n  3. Be classy and professional, with inspiration from key, past print publications.\n  4. Be destinct and unique.\n\nWith that, I present to you... the new Lunduke Journal logo.\n\nWe couldn't get rid of the pixel art version of Lunduke, now could we?\n\nThe new design for video productions will also debut this week -- with a\nsimilar focus on class, while still being unique.\n\n### Politics? Mixed with my Tech? Heresy!\n\nWhile I am a strong believer in keeping Computers and Politics separate --\nand, in a perfect world, that would be ideal for The Lunduke Journal -- the\nreality is a bit more complicated.\n\nComputer companies, foundations, and Open Source projects are implementing\nextreme, political policies right and left. Policies which dramatically impact\nhundreds of thousands of people who work in IT (in addition to computer users\naround the globe). And, since no other Tech News outlets are covering these\ntopics... if The Lunduke Journal doesn't cover them... these stories simply\nwon't get told.\n\nSo tell them, we will.\n\nThe Lunduke Journal will continue to have a firm \"no non-Tech politics\" rule.\n\nThe Lunduke Journal is not a soap box to spout off about whatever political\ntopic I like. This is a Tech publication. But, when a Big Tech company takes\nan extreme action... I'm going to follow that story wherever it goes. No\nmatter how messy or politically charged it gets... or how much it upsets a\nsegment of the Tech world.\n\nWhile most other Tech Journalists steer clear of covering many of these\nstories -- for fear of backlash from certain political factions -- for me, as\nthey say, that genie is already out of the bottle.\n\nMy political views are well known, and regularly yelled about, throughout the\nTech and Open Source world. I have, for better or worse, become a bit of a\npolarizing figure within the Tech industry. And, as such, a certain segment of\nthe population is going to object to -- and often boycott -- my work... no\nmatter how non-Political it is.\n\nAt this point, it makes sense to bring the Political (but distinctly Tech\nrelated) content into The Lunduke Journal. It makes reading those articles --\nwhich were previously only available on ConservativeNerds.Locals.com -- easier\nfor the largest audience, and gives those pieces the Lunduke Journal stamp of\napproval.\n\nNot everyone is going to like this change. I get that. But most will. And,\nregardless, it's for the best.\n\nI am planning on implementing a system where we include a \"Politics Warning\"\nlabel on all politically charged content. That way, should you want to avoid\nany article or show with even a hint of political content, it will be easy for\nyou to do so.\n\n### F.A.Q.\n\nQ: What if I already have a Lifetime or Yearly Triple Pass Subscription?\n\n> A: All existing subscriptions -- of every kind -- will always be honored. If\n> you have a Lifetime, you always have a Lifetime. If you have a \"Yearly\n> Triple Pass\", you still do. So you're good to go.

Heck, if it's a day that ends\nin \"Ay!\", there's likely some random, usually overblown, drama happening in\none Open Source organization or another.\n\nBut, sometimes, within that drama, there exists a bigger story.\n\nSuch is the case with \"Red Hat vs Hyprland\".\n\nWithin this drama there lies a tale of extremist poltiics, abuse of corporate\npower, and silencing of political \"undesirables\". The things we learn here --\nburried beneath the layers of drama -- are deeply disturbing, with significant\nramifications for the entire Open Source industry.\n\n### Cutting through the noise\n\nAs with all drama, there's a lot of finger pointing. And... noise. So much\nnoise. Let's cut through all of that and get right to the facts.\n\nThe basic facts of this event:\n\n  1. The core developer behind Hyprland (a tiling Linux window manager which has gained significant traction), a man who goes by the name \"Vaxry\", has been banned from any involvement in the Freedesktop project (an umbrella project covering Xorg, Wayland, and many other core Linux Desktop projects).\n  2. This ban means that Vaxry will not be allowed to report bugs or submit code patches to Freedesktop projects -- often directly relevant to his own work on the Hyprland window manager.\n  3. The ban (affecting Freedesktop) was enacted by a Red Hat representative (using a RedHat.com email address), based on a perceived 2 year old \"Code of Conduct Violation\" on a Hyprland chat server.\n  4. Red Hat, Freedesktop, and Hyprland are all separate organizations.\n\nAs with any drama, there's a great deal of other information out there --\nalong with frenzied onlookers yelling about it from the sidelines -- but those\nare the core actions and facts.\n\nThe key takeaway: A representative from Red Hat was using corporate power to\nforce a person out of other (read: non-Red Hat) organizations. For reasons not\nrelated to Red Hat. Nor related to the organization the person was being\nbanned from.\n\nIn essence, Red Hat flexing it's muscle -- bending large portions of the Open\nSource world to do it's bidding.\n\nBy itself, that's bad enough. But it gets worse. Much worse.\n\n### What was the \"violation\"?\n\nIn order to understand how truly disturbing this issue is, we need to know a\nfew additional details. Starting with the initial \"Code of Conduct Violation\".\n\nBack in 2022 -- yes, two years ago -- on the Discord chat server for the\nHyprland window manager project, a man who identified as \"Trans\" listed his\npreferred prouns as \"she/her\".\n\nA moderator on that Hyprland chat server changed that \"Trans\" person's\npronouns to list as \"who/cares\".\n\nScreenshot of the \"Code of Conduct Violation\".\n\nFlash forward to 2024, and this \"who/cares\" action comes to the attention of\nanother man who identifies as \"Trans\". An employee of Red Hat named Lyude\nPaul.\n\nTo give you an idea of the motivations of the actions which follow: Lyude Paul\nhas a publicly stated goal of \"bullying\" anyone who does not adequately show\nrespect to \"Trans\" issues, as shown in his social media posts.\n\nSource: Lyude Paul's Mastodon account.\n\nLyude Paul also promotes the idea that \"right-wing people are not welcomed\" in\norganizations.\n\nSource: Lyude Paul's Mastodon account.\n\nAs Lyude Paul has a stated objective of \"bullying\" people -- making sure they\nare \"not welcomed\" -- if they do not profess the correct political ideals (or\ndo not support \"Trans\" activism in the proper way)... it is not entirely\nsurprising that this gentleman would use his position at Red Hat to ban those\nhe disagrees with.\n\nAnd that is exactly what happened.\n\nSource: Lyude Paul's official email from RedHat.com.\n\nLyude Paul -- using his Red Hat email address -- informed Vaxry (the lead\ndeveloper of Hyprland -- the project where the \"who/cares\" chat server\nincident occurred) that he was now banned from the entirety of the Freedesktop\nproject and organization.\n\nAn important note: When a person sends an email from their corporate email\naccount, they are acting on behalf of the corporation. That is a hard and fast\nrule that has been in place since... well... forever. Likewise Red Hat has not\ndistanced itself from these actions in the least.\n\nYou can read the full emails, from Lyude Paul / Red Hat, as published by\nVaxry.\n\n### The Red Hat Problem\n\nThis is an example of Red Hat, a corporation with a wild history of\ndiscrimination and censorship, using their corporate power (and strength\nwithin the Linux and Open Source world) to bully and silence those they\npolitically disagree with.\n\nRed Hat could condemn these actions (which were done in Red Hat's name) by\ntheir employee. They have not done so.\n\nNone of this should be terribly surprising, considering what we already know\nabout the IBM subsidiary. They have a history of taking extreme political\nstances... and they actively discriminate against employees who deviate from\ntheir allowed, always extremely politically Leftist, ideals.\n\n  * Red Hat holds official \"Anti-White\" training programs.\n  * Red Hat / IBM employees are given \"badges\" for being a good \"ally\".\n  * Red Hat has a \"Word Usage Council\" where they actively find words and thoughts to ban.\n  * Red Hat / IBM has racist hiring quotas and more.\n\nConsidering Red Hat's historical stances and actions, it is no surprise that\nan employee of Red Hat would be able to use the corporate power of Red Hat to\nbully others who possessed the wrong ideas (as was the publicly stated\nobjective of Lyude Paul).\n\n### A singular bit of drama... and a trend.\n\nThis particular incident has elicited strong reactions -- and has grabbed the\nattention of many across the Linux and Open Source industry. Lots of drama.\nLots of opportunities to quote people who are making big, outlandish\nstatements.\n\nAnd most of that drama is little more than distracting fluff.\n\nBut the core -- the facts -- are truly disturbing. And, once again, Red Hat\nfinds itself at the center of another story where people are being\ndiscriminated against.\n\nA few closing thoughts.\n\n  * If this sort of bullying, censorship, and blacklisting of those with the \"wrong politics\" is allowed to continue... it will get worse.\n  * Lyude Paul is guilty of far more extreme \"Code of Conduct\" violations than Vaxry -- as is shown in the screenshots above. Yet Lyude Paul has not been banned, censored, or punished in any way by Red Hat or Freedesktop.\n  * It would appear fairly obvious that the \"Code of Conduct\", at least in this case, is being used as a weapon to selectively harm specific individuals.\n  * Considering Red Hat / IBM's history and dedication to discriminating against specific groups, it seems a fair assumption that these actions are not only allowed but encouraged by corporate leadership. Should that not be the case, The Lunduke Journal encourages Red Hat and IBM to make a statement regarding it. If such a statement is made, The Lunduke Journal will publish it in full.\n  * Will Open Source organizations -- such as Freedesktop -- allow these sorts of discriminatory actions to continue?\n  * Should Freedesktop, and others, continue allowing this type of discrimination... what result will that have on existing Open Source projects and users of those projects?\n\nThe Lunduke Journal has reached out to representatives from IBM and Red Hat\nfor comment. As of the time of publication The Lunduke Journal has received no\nresponse.\n\nRead full Article\n\n12\n\nView All\n\n7\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\n16 hours ago\n\nCrazy Tech People Who Hate Lunduke - Part I\n\nLunduke drives Tech Journalists to mADnEsS & destroys entire projects... with\nhis magic words!\n\nOne of my super-powers (apparently) is writing words which burrow into the\nbrains of many nerds... driving them slowly insane.\n\nTech Journalists, Software Developers, Project Managers... even your average\ncomputer nerds are susceptible to my wizardly words of wickedness.\n\nAnd, because I have to see their linguistic detritus, I am now going to\nsubject all of you to the insanity which they spew.\n\nI present to you: \"Crazy Tech People Who Hate Lunduke - Part I\"\n\nYeah.

Feeling pretty powerful right now.\n\nWonder which project I should mention next...\n\n### elementary OS\n\nHere is a -- definitely very sane and reasonable -- post from the founder (and\ncurrently sole employee) of elementary OS (a fork of Ubuntu). That post is\nentitled \"Assault, death, transphobia, etc\".\n\nWait. What did I do?\n\nI'm not 100% sure... but I think he's saying I... took out a hit on him?\nLike... in a mafia movie? By... posting an article about computers? And if\nsomeone else shares the link to that article... that person is now part of...\nthat hit? Or something?\n\nOr maybe my words are like that VHS tape in The Ring? You know... you read a\nfew of my words then a creeply lady starts crawling around your laptop before\nyou die?\n\nHuh!\n\nWell. Either way. You heard it here first, folks. Sharing links to my words\nis, like, literally murder. The future is weird!\n\n### Rent free, baby!\n\nWhat have we learned today?\n\n  * My words drive Tech Journalists to mADnEsS.\n  * I can \"tear apart\" open source projects with two words.\n  * If you share a link to my words, you are comitting murder.\n\nOne thing is also clear: They can't stop talking about me... my wizard words\ncompel them.\n\nIn fact, it's gotten to the point where people are issuing \"Stop reposting\nBryan Lunduke Challenges\".\n\nGood luck, buddy.\n\nIf past performance is any indication of future performance... that challenge\nwill end poorly. Especially after I write up some more of my Black Magic Words\nof Wonder.\n\nWhew!\n\nWonder what we'll learn in Part II?\n\nRead full Article\n\n8\n\nView All\n\n2\n\nReply\n\nSee More\n\nSign Up To Lunduke\n\nSign Up for free to see more from this community or subscribe to Lunduke for\n$6/month to support Lunduke for more interaction and exclusive content.\n\nLogin Signup\n\nAvailable on mobile and TV devices\n\nPowered by Locals\n\nAbout Community\n\nLunduke\n\n6174 Members\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nSeptember 22, 2023\n\nLunduke Journal Link Central (tm)\n\nLooking for some of the biggest articles and shows from The Lunduke Journal?\nOr Podcast feeds?
