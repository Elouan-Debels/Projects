This fact would eventually drag the gadget into the existing\nmoral panic about adolescent drug use of the era.\n\nThe pager panic began with a 1988 Washington Post report on the gadgets\nprevalence in the drug trade, quoting DEA and law enforcement officials. The\npiece was syndicated throughout the US under headlines like \u201cBeepers flourish\nin drug business\u201d , \u201cBeepers Speed Drug Connections\u201d and \u201cDrug beepers: Paging\ndevices popular with cocaine dealers\u201d\n\nThe spread of the story stoked concerns that beepers in the hands of youths\nweren\u2019t just a distraction - a common complaint from teachers - but also a\ndirect line to drug dealers. One school district official told The New York\nTimes: \"How can we expect students to 'just say no to drugs' when we allow\nthem to wear the most dominant symbol of the drug trade on their belts.\"\n\n\"How can we expect students to 'just say no to drugs' when we allow them to\nwear the most dominant symbol of the drug trade on their belts\" - James\nFleming, Dade Public Schools, The New York Times, 1988\n\nIn response schools, towns, states and even the Senate would pass rules\nagainst beepers. New Jersey prohibited beepers for under-18s entirely,\npossession could result in a 6-month jail-term - a law proposed by ex-\npoliceman and Senator Ronald L. Rice.\n\nA city ordinance in Michigan mandated 3-month jail terms for children caught\nin possession of one within school grounds. Chicago passed a ban that its\nPublic Schools Security chief said would also reduce prostitution:\n\n\"We've got girls 11 years old. They get a call and they're out of school to\nturn a trick\u201d - George Sims, Chicago Public Schools Security Chief ,\nAssociated Press\n\nOther states proposed community service, fines and 1-year drivers license bans\nas punishment. Thousands of of young people were victims of these heavy handed\nprohibitions - some of which made headlines:\n\nReferences: Top Left, Top Right, Bottom\n\nSome schools regularly referred students found with pagers to police, one\n16-year-old - Stephanie Redfern - faced a disorderly persons charge. A\n13-year-old was handcuffed. Chicago was particularly aggressive in its\nenforcement: over 30 children were arrested and suspended for \u2018beeper\nviolations\u2019 in one police sweep at a school - many parents couldn\u2019t locate\ntheir kids for more than 6-hours. This was just the start:\n\nAccording to Police Lt. Randolph Barton - head of the Chicago public school\npatrol unit at the time - by April 1994 there had been 700 beeper arrests in\nChicago schools, with the prior school year seeing 1000. Some still felt these\nnumbers were too low:\n\n\u201cRight now I don\u2019t think enough people are being arrested for wearing or\nbringing beepers into Chicago schools\u201d - Ald. Michael Wojcik (35th)\n\nIn 1996 a 5-year-old in New Jersey was suspended for taking a beeper on a\nschool trip, outrage ensured - catching the attention of Howard Stern, leading\nto calls for the laws to be amended or repealed.\n\nEven young adults didn\u2019t escape the beeper prohibition: 18-year-old Anthony\nBeachum feared a jail term after trying to sell a beeper to a student on\nschool grounds. State prosecutors sought a criminal conviction for Beachum -\nthat would have barred him from his hopes of joining the military. The judge\nsettled for probation and 10 hours of community service.\n\nHampton University required students register beepers with campus police, even\nthough there was no evidence of them increasing drug access. VP of student\naffairs at the time would admit as much:\n\n\u201cThere is not a single case where I can make a connection between beepers and\ndrugs\u201d - Hampton University, VP of Student Affairs\n\n###\n\nBIG BEEPER FIGHTS BACK\n\nThe beeper backlash was a BIG problem for Motorola who had 80% of the pager\nmarket at the time. The company had a hit on its hands - that was introducing\nthe brand to a whole new generation - so in 1994 it fought back, partly by\nrallying youth. A move reminiscent of TikTok\u2019s recent lobbying tactics.\n\nMotorola enlisted children of its employees to help design pro-beeper\ncampaigns, emphasizing the importance of pagers as legitimate communication\ndevices for the young. \u201cWho better to help plan for the battle than teens\nthemselves\u201d one report on the efforts would say. At a week long event, one\nattendee came up with the slogan \u201cPages for All Ages.\u201d\n\nThe company ran television ads promoting pagers as a tool for child parent\ncommunication and in 1996, partnered with PepsiCo to offer 500,000 pagers to\nyouths at a low price.\n\nThe promotion angered lawmakers - like State Senator Ronald Rice - who\u2019d been\na leading player in the war on beepers. Around this time moves to over-turn\nbans emerged, by other lawmakers calling them outdated - partly fuelled by the\nsuspension of a 5-year-old alluded to earlier. New Jersey would amend the law\nin 1996, but not repeal it.\n\n3 decades later, the New Jersey law was still on the books. The original\nsponsor of the bill - Senator Ronald Rice - sought to repeal it in 2017 saying\n\"Fast forward almost three decades and it's no longer an issue.\"\n\nThere is little evidence it ever was an issue, in-fact - the subsequent rise\nof cellphones in schools coincided with a massive reduction in youth drug\ntaking, while causation has been suggested by some - it certainly serves as\nstronger evidence against the idea of mobile messaging increasing drug access.\n\nSenator Ronald Rice passed away in 2023 - the New Jersey Pager ban still in\nplace - months later The Washington Post editorial board would call on schools\nto ban cellphones entirely - part of a new moral panic about kids and digital\ndevices, many of whose parents were once prohibited from bringing pagers to\nschool.\n\nNod to Ernie Smith of Tedium.co the only other person to cover the beeper\nbans, a piece that helped highlight a few fun examples included in this piece\n\nShare Pessimists Archive Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the Pessimists Archive Newsletter\n\n36 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n36\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Forgotten War on Beepers\n\nnewsletter.pessimistsarchive.org\n\n5\n\nShare\n\n5 Comments\n\nDanielle NewnhamDanielle NewnhamApr 10Liked by Louis AnslowI have fond\nmemories of mine although others did seem to lean towards thinking I was a\ndrug dealer, as a result!Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nKeith HaydenHayden Academy Collective (HAC)...Apr 15Slightly ahead of my time,\nbut I remember hearing about beepers everywhere when I was a kid.
