Run \ud83e\udd17 Transformers directly in\nyour browser, with no need for a server!\n\nTransformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face's\ntransformers python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models\nusing a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different\nmodalities, such as:\n\n  * \ud83d\udcdd Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.\n  * \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n  * \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.\n  * \ud83d\udc19 Multimodal: zero-shot image classification.\n\nTransformers.js uses ONNX Runtime to run models in the browser. The best part\nabout it, is that you can easily convert your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow,\nor JAX models to ONNX using \ud83e\udd17 Optimum.\n\nFor more information, check out the full documentation.\n\n## Quick tour\n\nIt's super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python\nlibrary, we support the pipeline API. Pipelines group together a pretrained\nmodel with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it\nthe easiest way to run models with the library.\n\nPython (original)| Javascript (ours)  \n---|---  \n      \n    \n    from transformers import pipeline # Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis pipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis') out = pipe('I love transformers!') # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999806941}]\n\n|\n\n    \n    \n    import { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers'; // Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis'); let out = await pipe('I love transformers!'); // [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999817686}]  \n  \nYou can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the\nsecond argument to the pipeline function. For example:\n\n    \n    \n    // Use a different model for sentiment-analysis let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'Xenova/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment');\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install via NPM, run:\n\n    \n    \n    npm i @xenova/transformers\n\nAlternatively, you can use it in vanilla JS, without any bundler, by using a\nCDN or static hosting. For example, using ES Modules, you can import the\nlibrary with:\n\n    \n    \n    <script type=\"module\"> import { pipeline } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xenova/transformers@2.17.0'; </script>\n\n## Examples\n\nWant to jump straight in?

You can customize this as follows:\n\n### Settings\n\n    \n    \n    import { env } from '@xenova/transformers'; // Specify a custom location for models (defaults to '/models/'). env.localModelPath = '/path/to/models/'; // Disable the loading of remote models from the Hugging Face Hub: env.allowRemoteModels = false; // Set location of .wasm files. Defaults to use a CDN. env.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = '/path/to/files/';\n\nFor a full list of available settings, check out the API Reference.\n\n### Convert your models to ONNX\n\nWe recommend using our conversion script to convert your PyTorch, TensorFlow,\nor JAX models to ONNX in a single command. Behind the scenes, it uses \ud83e\udd17\nOptimum to perform conversion and quantization of your model.\n\n    \n    \n    python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id <model_name_or_path>\n\nFor example, convert and quantize bert-base-uncased using:\n\n    \n    \n    python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id bert-base-uncased\n\nThis will save the following files to ./models/:\n\n    \n    \n    bert-base-uncased/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.json \u251c\u2500\u2500 tokenizer.json \u251c\u2500\u2500 tokenizer_config.json \u2514\u2500\u2500 onnx/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 model.onnx \u2514\u2500\u2500 model_quantized.onnx\n\nFor the full list of supported architectures, see the Optimum documentation.\n\n## Supported tasks/models\n\nHere is the list of all tasks and architectures currently supported by\nTransformers.js. If you don't see your task/model listed here or it is not yet\nsupported, feel free to open up a feature request here.\n\nTo find compatible models on the Hub, select the \"transformers.js\" library tag\nin the filter menu (or visit this link). You can refine your search by\nselecting the task you're interested in (e.g., text-classification).\n\n### Tasks\n\n#### Natural Language Processing\n\nTask| ID| Description| Supported?  \n---|---|---|---  \nFill-Mask| fill-mask| Masking some of the words in a sentence and predicting\nwhich words should replace those masks.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nQuestion Answering| question-answering| Retrieve the answer to a question from\na given text.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nSentence Similarity| sentence-similarity| Determining how similar two texts\nare.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nSummarization| summarization| Producing a shorter version of a document while\npreserving its important information.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nTable Question Answering| table-question-answering| Answering a question about\ninformation from a given table.| \u274c  \nText Classification| text-classification or sentiment-analysis| Assigning a\nlabel or class to a given text.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nText Generation| text-generation| Producing new text by predicting the next\nword in a sequence.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nText-to-text Generation| text2text-generation| Converting one text sequence\ninto another text sequence.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nToken Classification| token-classification or ner| Assigning a label to each\ntoken in a text.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nTranslation| translation| Converting text from one language to another.| \u2705\n(docs) (models)  \nZero-Shot Classification| zero-shot-classification| Classifying text into\nclasses that are unseen during training.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nFeature Extraction| feature-extraction| Transforming raw data into numerical\nfeatures that can be processed while preserving the information in the\noriginal dataset.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \n  \n#### Vision\n\nTask| ID| Description| Supported?  \n---|---|---|---  \nDepth Estimation| depth-estimation| Predicting the depth of objects present in\nan image.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nImage Classification| image-classification| Assigning a label or class to an\nentire image.| \u2705 (docs) (models)  \nImage Segmentation| image-segmentation| Divides an image into segments where\neach pixel is mapped to an object.
