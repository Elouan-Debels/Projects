The readings were off the charts.\n\nTop view of Dhaka in the winter morning\n\nZomato's delivery partner, Mannu Kumar, on his way to deliver an order across\nthe Yamuna river in east Delhi.\n\nBy Zuha Siddiqui, Samriddhi Sakunia and Faisal Mahmud\n\n27 February 2024 \u2022 Lahore, Pakistan\n\nEspa\u00f1olPortugu\u00eas\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57)DeutschFran\u00e7ais\n\nAt 9 on a cold January morning, Sami Iqbal got ready for work at his home in\nLahore\u2019s old quarter, a stone\u2019s throw from the historic Badshahi Mosque. It\nwas 6 degrees Celsius (42.8 degrees Fahrenheit) and the city was beginning to\ncome alive \u2014 chai stalls in the vicinity pushed open their shutters and the\ndoughy smell of flatbreads puffing up in iron skillets filled the air. Iqbal\nwrapped a muffler around his face before revving up his Honda motorbike to\nbegin his day as a bike-taxi rider.\n\nIqbal is a self-employed gig worker who works across multiple ride-hailing\napps, including Careem, Bykea, and inDrive. As he set off for his first job\nthat day, the city was covered in a thick, poisonous smog. He drove through\nvisible specks of reddish dust and other particulate matter, breathing through\nhis muffler and trying to ignore the metallic, almost sulfurous stench\npermeating his nostrils.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been ill for a week,\u201d Iqbal told Rest of World, his voice hoarse. \u201cIt\u2019s\nprobably because of the smog. I\u2019m on the road for so long.\u201d\n\nLahore is the most polluted city in the world, according to Swiss air quality\nmonitoring platform IQAir. In November, the air was so poisonous that\nauthorities issued a citywide lockdown, closing schools, markets, and parks\nfor four days, and advising people to stay indoors.\n\nOther cities in South Asia have similarly alarming levels of air quality:\nEight out of the top 10 most polluted cities globally are in the region.\nCauses include rapid urbanization, construction, vehicular pollution, coal-\nfueled power plants, crop burning, and the operation of brick kilns. Air\nquality in the region is at its worst from October to February due to\natmospheric conditions which cause pollutants to be trapped closer to the\nground.\n\nExposure to this pollution can have serious health impacts \u2014 from headaches\nand breathing difficulties to heart and lung disease, stroke, and cancer. For\ngig workers, who often have no choice but to work in the smog, the effects are\nclear. By the end of a day\u2019s work, Iqbal said, his whole body feels lifeless.\n\u201cI also experience exhaustion, I get a lot of headaches. I get body aches,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n### Riders in the smog\n\nFrom toxic skies to health hazards: Rest of World measured air quality for\nriders in Lahore, New Delhi, and Dhaka. The results were devastating.\n\nPollution is worsening in South Asia\u2019s major cities, but few occupations face\nmore risk than gig riders. Many have no options for alternate work, and\nreceive little help from employers. we spoke to 25 gig workers in Lahore, New\nDelhi, and Dhaka, all of whom reported symptoms that health experts believe\nare the consequence of routine exposure to carcinogenic pollutants.\n\nListen to our reporting to find out just how poisonous the air has become.\n\nWritten by Zuha Siddiqui, Samriddhi Sakunia and Faisal Mahmud. Narrated by\nMithila Phadke.\n\nOriginal story: https://restofworld.org/2024/riders-in-the-smog-gig-workers-\npollution/\n\n0:00/21:52\n\nLong Reads by\n\nExplore more episodes >>\n\nRest of World spoke to 25 gig workers in Lahore, New Delhi, and Dhaka, all of\nwhom reported symptoms that health experts believe are the consequence of\nroutine exposure to carcinogenic pollutants, including eye and throat\nirritation, persistent coughs, dizziness, and nausea. \u201cI can\u2019t even stand\nbecause of how tired I get, and most days I just cough and cough the entire\nshift,\u201d Sachin Gupta, a 29-year-old Swiggy and Zomato delivery worker in New\nDelhi, told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cOutdoor workers are particularly vulnerable because of the number of\npollutants they\u2019re inhaling,\u201d Muhammad Irfan Malik, a pulmonologist in Lahore,\ntold Rest of World. \u201cPollution [has become] an invisible killer that we are\nseeing all year long.\u201d\n\n  * Dhaka at 10:57 a.m. on January 10, 2024.\n  * Lahore at 8:24 a.m. on January 9, 2024.\n\nTo better understand air quality exposure among gig workers in South Asia,\nRest of World gave three gig workers \u2014 one each in Lahore, New Delhi, and\nDhaka \u2014 air quality monitors to wear throughout a regular shift in January.\nThe Atmotube Pro monitors continually tracked their exposure to carcinogenic\npollutants \u2014 specifically PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 (different sizes of particulate\nmatter), and volatile organic compounds such as benzene and formaldehyde.\n\nMethodology: How we measured pollution exposure\n\nThe data revealed that all three workers were routinely exposed to hazardous\nlevels of pollutants. For PM2.5, referring to particulates that are 2.5\nmicrometers in diameter or less \u2014 which have been linked to health risks\nincluding heart attacks and strokes \u2014 all riders were consistently logging\nexposure levels more than 10 times the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended\ndaily average of 15 micrograms per cubic meter. Manu Sharma, in New Delhi,\nrecorded the highest PM2.5 level of the three riders, hitting 468.3 micrograms\nper cubic meter around 6 p.m. Lahore was a close second, with Iqbal recording\n464.2 micrograms per cubic meter around the same time.\n\nAlongside tracking specific pollutants, the Atmotube Pro gives an overall\nreal-time air quality score (AQS) from 0\u2013100, with zero being the most\nseverely polluted, and 100 being the cleanest. According to Atmo, the company\nthat makes the Atmotube monitors, a reading of 0\u201320 should be considered a\nhealth alert, under which conditions \u201ceveryone should avoid all outdoor\nexertion.\u201d But the three gig workers found their monitors consistently\ndisplayed the lowest possible score.\n\nAs Iqbal went about his work picking up and dropping off customers, his\npollution monitor barely budged from a score of zero. \u201cIs this device even\nworking?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe only briefly achieved a score over 40 \u2014 considered simply \u201cpolluted\u201d \u2014 when\nhe went indoors to eat lunch and pray.\n\nRest of World followed gig workers during their shifts in three of the world\u2019s\nmost polluted cities.\n\nRest of World followed gig workers during their shifts in three of the world\u2019s\nmost polluted cities.\n\nIn Dhaka, we met with 30-year-old Mohammad Noor Afsar, who is all too familiar\nwith the city\u2019s pollution \u2014 first as a battery salesman and now as a delivery\nperson.\n\nIn Dhaka, we met with 30-year-old Mohammad Noor Afsar, who is all too familiar\nwith the city\u2019s pollution \u2014 first as a battery salesman and now as a delivery\nperson.\n\nAfsar rides a bicycle for RedX, a logistics company with a vast delivery\nnetwork across Bangladesh.\n\nAfsar rides a bicycle for RedX, a logistics company with a vast delivery\nnetwork across Bangladesh.\n\n\u201cSchool traffic clogs the roads twice daily, with private car fumes choking\nthe air,\u201d Afsar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare on a bike.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool traffic clogs the roads twice daily, with private car fumes choking\nthe air,\u201d Afsar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare on a bike.\u201d\n\n### Danger to health\n\nWhen Manu Sharma, a 35-year-old rider for Indian food delivery platform\nSwiggy, set out for his shift on his electric bike around 2:45 p.m. that day,\nhe couldn\u2019t see through the smoke in the air. \u201cThere is so much pollution and\nsmog that I can\u2019t even see the next building,\u201d he told Rest of World.\n\nIntrigued by Rest of World\u2019s experiment, Sharma initially doubted there was\nanything left to learn about New Delhi\u2019s polluted air. \u201cYou can just have a\nlook around, and with decreasing visibility it\u2019s obvious,\u201d he said. He hadn\u2019t\nnoticed any health issues until he started gig work, and now has constant\nheadaches and fever, Sharma said. He often feels as if he cannot breathe. When\nhe heads out to work, he wears a cloth mask over his face. \u201cIn a few days, I\nthink we will have to carry oxygen cylinders with us,\u201d he joked.\n\nBut as Sharma\u2019s shift came to an end around 7:45 p.m., he was concerned about\nwhat the pollution monitor showed he had been inhaling through the day.\nSimilar to Iqbal, the device\u2019s AQS reading had been stuck on zero for the\nmajority of the day, with PM2.5 levels mostly oscillating between 100\u2013200\nmicrograms per cubic meter. Sharma, who moved to New Delhi from the eastern\nstate of Bihar in July, said he is now contemplating moving back out of the\ncity.\n\nMohammad Noor Afsar, the 30-year-old RedX delivery rider who carried the Atmo\ndevice for Rest of World on a foggy January morning in Dhaka, has been\nbattling the fumes from the city\u2019s traffic for years. Before joining the\ncourier service, he worked as a battery salesman. Though it has been a welcome\nchange, he said, he continues to struggle with the pollution.\n\nAs traffic intensified around him toward the evening, so did the air\u2019s\nheaviness. The metallic tang of exhaust, the grit of dust \u2014 Afsar felt the\ngrim cocktail filling his lungs. \u201cYou can just feel the pollution,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut thankfully, my shift ends soon.\u201d\n\n##### Dhaka 4:07 p.m.\n\nAfsar\u2019s ride along Panthapath Road in the Karwan Bazar area of Dhaka.\n\nJust as for Iqbal and Sharma, the air quality monitor showed Afsar was\nroutinely breathing in much higher levels of PM2.5 and PM10 than are\nconsidered healthy. A single notable moment of respite \u2014 visible in the data \u2014\noccurred around 7 p.m., when Afsar retreated to his office for a while. Even\nthen, PM levels were well above the WHO\u2019s guidelines.\n\nAmong health experts, PM2.5 is a particular concern. According to the United\nStates Environmental Protection Agency, particles of this size can get deep\ninto the lungs, and some particles may even get into the bloodstream. Health\neffects attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 include \u201cischemic heart\ndisease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower-\nrespiratory infections (such as pneumonia), stroke, type 2 diabetes, and\nadverse birth outcomes,\u201d according to the State of Global Air initiative, a\ncollaborative project which analyzes trends in air quality around the world.\n\n> \u201cThere is so much pollution and smog that I can\u2019t even see the next\n> building.\u201d\n\nAs South Asia\u2019s megacities top global air pollution rankings, hospitals are\npiling up with patients suffering from pollution-related illnesses. In\nNovember, a pulmonologist at New Delhi\u2019s Manipal Hospital noted that up to 50%\nof the beds in their intensive care unit had filled up with patients who had\nrespiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and asthma, despite having no history\nof these conditions.\n\nPhysicians Rest of World spoke with sounded alarm bells. \u201cWe\u2019ve found people\nwho don\u2019t have a family history of asthma coming to us with severe lung\ndisease,\u201d Malik, the Lahore-based pulmonologist, said. \u201cThis is called\nchemical-induced lung injury because of exposure to particulate matter, such\nas PM2.5.\u201d\n\nMalik and his colleagues have now begun to associate cases of respiratory\ndistress with a new subclassification of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\ncalled COPD-P \u2014 in which P stands for pollution.\n\nNeetu Jain, a New Delhi-based pulmonologist, has also been witnessing a rise\nin patients reporting coughs, shortness of breath, and wheezing. \u201cThere is a\ndefinite increase in viral and bacterial lung infections,\u201d she told Rest of\nWorld.\n\nPollution-related conditions can have long-term health impacts. The 2023 Air\nQuality Life Index, carried out by the Energy Policy Institute at the\nUniversity of Chicago, found that air pollution shortens lives by an average\nof 11.9 years in New Delhi, 8.1 years in Dhaka, and 7.5 years in Lahore. A\nnonprofit called Fair Finance Pakistan has estimated that air pollution leads\nto at least 128,000 deaths every year in the country. In India, pollution has\nled to more than 1.6 million premature deaths, according to a 2019 study by\nThe Lancet. And in Bangladesh, the World Bank projects that air pollution will\nbe responsible for 186,000 premature deaths by 2030.\n\nAlthough pollution can affect anyone exposed to it, delivery riders are\nparticularly vulnerable owing to the nature of their work: They are outside\nfor extended periods of time, often on congested streets, with little shelter\nfrom the smog.\n\nLahore at 7:52 a.m. on January 9, 2024.\n\nIn September 2020, environmental scientist Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder from the\nCenter for Atmospheric Pollution Studies in Dhaka and three other researchers\npublished a case study on the impact of air pollution on rickshaw pullers in\nDhaka. Majumder and his team spoke with 35 rickshaw pullers \u2014 all non-smokers\nwith no history of respiratory issues \u2014 and measured their lung function.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the respondents had various seasonal and environmental\ndisorders since coming to Dhaka,\u201d Majumder told Rest of World. \u201cForty-six\npercent of the respondents mostly had eye irritation, fever, and cough during\nwinter, which decreased their ability to pull their rickshaws.\u201d\n\nA study on gig workers in Ghaziabad, a city adjoining New Delhi, found that\nthey were exposed to levels of particulate matter and carcinogenic compounds\nsuch as benzene that were much higher than the safe levels set by local\nauthorities and the WHO.\n\nManu Sharma, 35, works as a delivery rider for Indian online food delivery\ngiants Swiggy and Zomato in New Delhi.\n\nManu Sharma, 35, works as a delivery rider for Indian online food delivery\ngiants Swiggy and Zomato in New Delhi.\n\nSharma did not have health issues until he moved to New Delhi from Bihar, a\nstate in eastern India, eight months ago.\n\nSharma did not have health issues until he moved to New Delhi from Bihar, a\nstate in eastern India, eight months ago.\n\nAfter experiencing frequent headaches and bouts of fever, Sharma said he is\nconsidering moving back to his village.\n\nAfter experiencing frequent headaches and bouts of fever, Sharma said he is\nconsidering moving back to his village.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the sun rise in this city for almost two weeks,\u201d Sharma said.\n\u201cThis job and this city are not for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the sun rise in this city for almost two weeks,\u201d Sharma said.\n\u201cThis job and this city are not for me.\u201d\n\n### Broken solutions\n\nPart of the reason air quality is so poor in these South Asian cities is due\nto what environmental author Siddharth Singh calls a \u201cmeteorological\nmisfortune.\u201d In his book The Great Smog of India, he explains that the\nlandlocked parts of the country are geographically positioned such that the\nwinds from the coastal regions collect pollutants on their way inland, which\nthen get \u201ctrapped\u201d before the Himalayas. \u201cThe air pressure pushes from one\ndirection, and with the inability to escape quickly in the other, the\nparticulate matter accumulates over the northern plains,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis\naccumulation and entrapment affect not only Delhi, but the entire expanse\nbetween Punjab in the west to West Bengal in the east.\u201d\n\n##### New Delhi 3:45 p.m.\n\nSharma\u2019s ride through the Krishna Nagar ward in Delhi.\n\nAbid Omar, founder of the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, a think tank\nfocused on air pollution research, told Rest of World this affects other South\nAsian cities too, especially in winter. \u201cThat misfortune is what results in\ntemperature inversion, which keeps the pollution trapped close to the lower\natmosphere, where it builds up,\u201d he said. Temperature inversion occurs as\nwarmer air rises, trapping pollutants in a blanket of cooler air close to the\nEarth\u2019s surface, such that they can\u2019t escape. It is also why pollution isn\u2019t\nsuch a visible problem in the summer months, even if the number of harmful\nemissions does not change.\n\nIqbal, the Lahore-based bike-taxi rider, noted that he experienced more\nsymptoms in the winter months. \u201cI\u2019ve ridden my bike in the summer months, too.\nThe effects aren\u2019t as adverse,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t experience eye irritation in\nthe summer. But I do in the winter.\u201d\n\nOn the day Rest of World followed Iqbal, he could not stop coughing through\nhis muffler by the time he finished work. \u201cI\u2019ve been ill for a week, have had\nfever, chills, and a bad cough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could say that my cough is due\nto air pollution, because I\u2019m out on the road for up to 10\u201312 hours a day.\u201d\n\n### Measures of air quality\n\n### PM1\n\n    Particulate matter (PM) refers to microscopic particles in the air that are small enough to be inhaled. These can include dust, dirt, or soot. PM1 are particles equal to or less than a single micrometer in diameter.\n\n### PM2.5\n\n    PM2.5 \u2014 any particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter \u2014 is particularly harmful to human health, causing conditions including heart disease and lung cancer.\n\n### PM10\n\n    All particulate matter under 10 micrometers in diameter is of concern, as these particles are small enough to get into the lungs and may even enter the bloodstream.\n\n### VOCs\n\n    Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are gasses that can harm human health, and include benzene and formaldehyde. Most come from manmade sources such as solvents and industrial emissions.\n\n### AQI\n\n    Air Quality Index (AQI) is an overall measurement of air quality, based on the density of pollutants in the air. The best score is 0; the worst is 500.\n\n### AQS\n\n    AQS is Atmo\u2019s own overall air quality score, intended to give a real-time idea of general air quality. For AQS, 100 represents the cleanest air; 0 is the most polluted.\n\n### Temperature\n\n    Temperature can impact air quality in different ways. One phenomenon is temperature inversion, which occurs when a layer of warm air traps cooler air \u2014 and the pollutants in it \u2014 closer to the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nAs pollution climbs to worrying levels in the subcontinent, local governments\nare scrambling for solutions. In Lahore, some officials are washing roads in\nan attempt to reduce dust and other pollutants, while others are trying out a\ntechnology called cloud seeding to create artificial rain in 10 locations\naround the city using a small Cessna plane. Indian scientists, too, are\nmulling the use of cloud seeding to trigger heavy rain in some parts of New\nDelhi.\n\nIn Bangladesh, officials have brought in carbon taxes in an attempt to reduce\nthe number of vehicles on the road \u2014 a measure they claim will help decrease\nboth the emissions and traffic congestion. But experts say these attempts\naren\u2019t tackling the biggest source of Dhaka\u2019s pollution: the at least 1,252\nbrick kilns operating in the suburbs, which account for more than 58% of the\npollutants circulating in the city\u2019s air.\n\nSimilarly, Omar, of the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, said cosmetic\ntechnical fixes like road washing do not solve air pollution. Instead, he\nsaid, the country\u2019s environmental laws should be improved and enforced. \u201cYou\nhave to measure factory emissions, make sure they stay within certain limits.\nAnd there are different standards that apply to a cement plant versus a power\nplant. All of these rules and regulations exist, but they\u2019re not enforced.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, gig workers told Rest of World the attempts to reduce the\neffects of pollution had had negative impacts for them. Iqbal, the bike-taxi\nrider in Lahore, said he spent more time on the road when Lahore locked down\nsome institutions due to pollution. \u201cBecause people were out and about, there\nwas actually more traffic on the streets,\u201d he said.\n\n##### Lahore 9:29 a.m.\n\nIqbal\u2019s ride near Bagh-e-Jinnah park in Lahore.\n\n\u201c[Lockdowns to reduce pollution] don\u2019t help in a city like Lahore where there\naren\u2019t alternatives for transport,\u201d Hassan Aftab Sheikh, a climate scientist\nfrom Lahore based in Oxford, told Rest of World. \u201cYou need to have\nalternatives for mobility if you\u2019re restricting mobility.\u201d\n\nGig platforms operating in these cities are aware of the pollution their\nworkers face. In a November social post, Indian food delivery giant Zomato\neven joked about the conditions, telling customers that their chat support\n\u201ccan\u2019t help if your chicken gets delivered as smoked chicken.\u201d\n\nIn November 2020, Pakistan\u2019s leading ride-hailing platform, Careem,\ndistributed \u201csmog kits\u201d \u2014 consisting of masks, paracetamol, and nasal spray \u2014\nto its riders in Islamabad and Lahore. Careem\u2019s parent company, Uber, had\nlaunched a similar initiative in Lahore in 2017.\n\nRest of World asked Careem if these kits are still being distributed among\nriders, but received no response. Rest of World also reached out to Pathao,\nBykea, inDrive, Zomato, and Swiggy to ask if they had introduced smog-\ncombating initiatives \u2014 such as mask mandates or smog kits \u2014 for riders, or\noffered any other accommodations. Most did not reply; Zomato and Swiggy\ndeclined to comment.\n\nThirty-two-year-old Sami Iqbal has been a gig worker in Lahore since 2019.\n\nThirty-two-year-old Sami Iqbal has been a gig worker in Lahore since 2019.\n\nHe spends 10 hours a day riding a motorbike-taxi, and earns about 90,000\nrupees ($322) a month.\n\nHe spends 10 hours a day riding a motorbike-taxi, and earns about 90,000\nrupees ($322) a month.\n\nScientists say Lahore\u2019s residents may lose up to seven years of life\nexpectancy from breathing toxic air.\n\nScientists say Lahore\u2019s residents may lose up to seven years of life\nexpectancy from breathing toxic air.\n\n\u201cMy whole body feels lifeless by the time I get home,\u201d Iqbal said.\n\n\u201cMy whole body feels lifeless by the time I get home,\u201d Iqbal said.\n\n### Inequity in breathing\n\nGig workers told Rest of World they were left with no choice but to continue\nworking on the streets, breathing toxic air day in and day out.\n\nGupta, the New Delhi-based delivery worker, said he was \u201cwell aware\u201d that his\nhealth symptoms were a direct fallout of the severe pollution, but that he\ncouldn\u2019t quit the work \u2014 even though his family had asked him to. \u201cWe can\u2019t\nquit the job just because of pollution and risk our livelihood, can we? We\naren\u2019t that privileged,\u201d he said.\n\nMalik, the pulmonologist from Lahore, has been telling his patients with COPD\nand asthma to consider moving away from the city. \u201cBut when I suggest this to\nthem, they look at me, and they cry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Where will we go?\nWe don\u2019t have money to resettle. Where will we work?\u2019\u201d\n\nThough the air has changed for everyone in the region, there remains an\n\u201cinequity in exposure to air pollution,\u201d Pallavi Pant, an air quality\nscientist from New Delhi, told Rest of World. \u201cWho among us has the means to\nreduce exposure? Many people are getting exposed to high levels of air\npollution as a result of their job or their occupation. How can we best\nprotect people knowing that some cannot afford to sit at home, or purchase air\npurifiers?\u201d\n\nMany workers told Rest of World they were also concerned about the impact of\npollution on their families. Lahore-based Foodpanda delivery rider Rizwan Khan\nsaid he had considered sending his children away for short stretches to their\ngrandfather\u2019s village, just so they could breathe fresh air. \u201cYou know kids,\nthey want to run around outside and want fresh air, but the air is so\npoisonous. I can\u2019t keep them shut inside the house,\u201d he said. Khan\u2019s youngest,\na 2-year-old boy, has a wheezing cough. \u201cYou can hear a whistling sound.\u201d\n\nIyaz Kamran, 30, who works with inDrive in Lahore, migrated to the city with\nhis wife and two children in 2019. Now, his 6-year-old daughter has been\ndiagnosed with asthma, and he takes her to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital every few\ndays so she can get nebulized \u2014 a treatment for the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t afford\nto buy a nebulizer because it costs 60,000 rupees [$215] and that\u2019s how much I\nmake in a month,\u201d he told Rest of World.
