And globally it was the warmest March\non record, the tenth record-breaking month in a row.\n\nSo what part does climate change play in our washout weather?\n\nImage source, Crown\n\nImage caption,\n\nWinter stats from the Met Office show it was was warmer and wetter than\naverage for most of the UK\n\n## Warmer means wetter\n\nWetter weather will be a feature of our changing climate in the UK.\n\nThe Met Office predicts that by 2070, winters in the UK will be up to 30%\nwetter than they were in 1990 and that rainfall will be up to 25% more\nintense.\n\nSummers will actually get drier overall \u2013 with more heatwaves and droughts \u2013\nbut when rain does come it will be heavier, 20% more intense than it was in\n1990.\n\nThe most violent downpours \u2013 more than 30mm of rain in an hour \u2013 are expected\nto occur twice as often as they used to.\n\nThis means the increased risk of flooding \u2013 with ground becoming saturated by\npersistent winter rainfall and drainage systems overwhelmed by summer deluges.\n\nImage source, BBC Weather Watcher / Gary Gimmick\n\nImage caption,\n\nRecent flooding on the River Ouse in York\n\n## Why more rain?\n\nThe simple answer is that warm air is able to hold more moisture.\n\nFor every degree of warming the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere\nincreases by around 7% fuelling more intense rainfall.\n\nOverall the earth\u2019s climate has already warmed by more than 1\u00b0C since pre-\nindustrial times, and recent months have been even warmer than that. For as\nlong as this warming trend goes on the atmosphere\u2019s capacity to hold water\nvapour will continue to increase.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it will get wetter everywhere though. Climate change is also\naltering wind patterns meaning that some areas such as parts of southern\nAfrica and the Amazon are becoming drier and hotter.\n\nImage source, Shutterstock\n\nImage caption,\n\nDrought in the Brazilian Amazon pushed the flow of the Branco River to\nhistoric lows in March 2024\n\n## Why has the UK been so wet recently?\n\nClimate change alone doesn\u2019t explain our recent washout. It is also down to\nthe jet stream.\n\nThe flow of winds high in the atmosphere that steers weather systems has been\nmaking a beeline for us \u2013 spinning up areas of low pressure, including a\nnumber of named storms, and sending them in our direction. And low pressure\ntends to bring rain.\n\nBut in a warmer world those rain-bearing weather systems are likely to be\nwetter. Imagine low pressure areas as sponges full of water. Climate change\nmeans they\u2019ll be loaded with even more water than before and when they\u2019re\nwrung out, we\u2019ll see more rainfall.\n\nFor the latest forecast \u2013 rain or not \u2013 check BBC Weather online or on the\napp.\n\n## Check the latest warnings\n\n  * https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/warnings/weather\n\n## Flood warnings\n\n  * https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/warnings/floods\n\n## Features\n\n  * Why is it raining so much?\n\n    * Published\n\n6 hours ago\n\n  * Weather for the Week Ahead.
