This marks an important\nmilestone for us.\n\nWhen Marc and I started the firm in 2009, the conventional wisdom in Venture\nCapital was that in any given year, only 15 companies would ever generate\n$100M in revenue and those 15 companies would drive almost all of VC returns.\nAt that time, the conventional wisdom was right. Venture Capital firms\nconfigured themselves to address a market of 15 important companies. This\nmeant relatively small fund sizes and a small number of partners in a single\nfund was the optimal approach. Andreessen Horowitz began in exactly this way\nwith a $300M fund and 2 General Partners.\n\nShortly after we started the firm, all that began to change. My partner Marc\nsaw the new world coming and wrote about it in 2011 in a piece called,\n\u201cSoftware is Eating the World.\u201d What he predicted then came true. In the past\n10 years, nearly every significant business has been reimagined as a software\ncompany, and the market for these companies has, as a result, increased\ndramatically. Along the way, each submarket \u2013 American Dynamism, Apps\n(Consumer, Enterprise, Fintech), Bio+Health, Crypto, Games, Growth, and\nInfrastructure \u2013 has become as big as the original entire Venture Capital\nmarket.\n\nAs a result, to win in each category, we needed to expand from one great\ninvestor in each segment to a dedicated investing team with a differentiated\nplatform in each category to help the best founders in those fields build\namazing companies. Each area requires deep expertise, so it\u2019s not wise to try\nto cross-train someone in, for example, Games and Infrastructure. More\nimportantly, founders building AI foundation models need an entirely different\nset of networks and capabilities than founders building biotech therapies.\n\nTo best serve the market, we created dedicated venture funds, each with its\nown team of experts and capabilities, specifically focused on each segment.\n\nWe did this because we believe as former entrepreneurs that your investors\nreally matter. A great investor with the right help, the right networking, and\nthe right expertise at the right time can be the difference between success\nand failure.\n\nFinally, we would like to thank our amazing Limited Partners who have enabled\nus to grow and innovate tremendously over the past 15 years.\n\n### Want more a16z?\n\nSign up to get the best of a16z content, news, and investments.\n\n###### Thanks for signing up for the a16z newsletter.\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome note.\n\nMANAGE MY SUBSCRIPTIONS By clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nContributor\n\n  * Ben Horowitz is a Cofounder and General Partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n    * Follow\n    * X\n    * Linkedin\n\nMore From this Contributor\n\n  * Money, power, politics, and the internet\u2019s next battleground Ben Horowitz, Marc Andreessen, Chris Dixon, and Robert Hackett\n  * Fixing Higher Education & New Startup Opportunities with Marc and Ben Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz\n  * Crisis in Higher Ed & Why Universities Still Matter with Marc & Ben Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz\n  * The Future of Longevity with Tony Robbins Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, and Tony Robbins\n  * Politics and the Future Ben Horowitz\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management,\nL.L.C.
