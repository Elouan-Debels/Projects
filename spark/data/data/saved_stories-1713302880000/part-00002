And every year,\npeople line up to get their updated vaccine, hoping the researchers formulated\nthe shot correctly.\n\nThe same is true of COVID vaccines, which have been reformulated to target\nsub-variants of the most prevalent strains circulating in the U.S.\n\nThis new strategy would eliminate the need to create all these different\nshots, because it targets a part of the viral genome that is common to all\nstrains of a virus. The vaccine, how it works, and a demonstration of its\nefficacy in mice is described in a paper published today in the Proceedings of\nthe National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to emphasize about this vaccine strategy is that it is broad,\u201d\nsaid UCR virologist and paper author Rong Hai. \u201cIt is broadly applicable to\nany number of viruses, broadly effective against any variant of a virus, and\nsafe for a broad spectrum of people. This could be the universal vaccine that\nwe have been looking for.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, vaccines contain either a dead or modified, live version of a\nvirus. The body\u2019s immune system recognizes a protein in the virus and mounts\nan immune response. This response produces T-cells that attack the virus and\nstop it from spreading. It also produces \u201cmemory\u201d B-cells that train your\nimmune system to protect you from future attacks.\n\nThe new vaccine also uses a live, modified version of a virus. However, it\ndoes not rely on the vaccinated body having this traditional immune response\nor immune active proteins \u2014 which is the reason it can be used by babies whose\nimmune systems are underdeveloped, or people suffering from a disease that\novertaxes their immune system. Instead, this relies on small, silencing RNA\nmolecules.\n\n\u201cA host \u2014 a person, a mouse, anyone infected\u2014 will produce small interfering\nRNAs as an immune response to viral infection. These RNAi then knock down the\nvirus,\u201d said Shouwei Ding, distinguished professor of microbiology at UCR, and\nlead paper author.\n\nThe reason viruses successfully cause disease is because they produce proteins\nthat block a host\u2019s RNAi response. \u201cIf we make a mutant virus that cannot\nproduce the protein to suppress our RNAi, we can weaken the virus. It can\nreplicate to some level, but then loses the battle to the host RNAi response,\u201d\nDing said. \u201cA virus weakened in this way can be used as a vaccine for boosting\nour RNAi immune system.\u201d\n\nWhen the researchers tested this strategy with a mouse virus called Nodamura,\nthey did it with mutant mice lacking T and B cells. With one vaccine\ninjection, they found the mice were protected from a lethal dose of the\nunmodified virus for at least 90 days. Note that some studies show nine mouse\ndays are roughly equivalent to one human year.\n\nThere are few vaccines suitable for use in babies younger than six months old.\nHowever, even newborn mice produce small RNAi molecules, which is why the\nvaccine protected them as well. UC Riverside has now been issued a US patent\non this RNAi vaccine technology.\n\nIn 2013, the same research team published a paper showing that flu infections\nalso induce us to produce RNAi molecules. \u201cThat\u2019s why our next step is to use\nthis same concept to generate a flu vaccine, so infants can be protected. If\nwe are successful, they\u2019ll no longer have to depend on their mothers\u2019\nantibodies,\u201d Ding said.\n\nTheir flu vaccine will also likely be delivered in the form of a spray, as\nmany people have an aversion to needles. \u201cRespiratory infections move through\nthe nose, so a spray might be an easier delivery system,\u201d Hai said.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers say there is little chance of a virus mutating\nto avoid this vaccination strategy. \u201cViruses may mutate in regions not\ntargeted by traditional vaccines. However, we are targeting their whole genome\nwith thousands of small RNAs. They cannot escape this,\u201d Hai said.\n\nUltimately, the researchers believe they can \u2018cut and paste\u2019 this strategy to\nmake a one-and-done vaccine for any number of viruses.\n\n\u201cThere are several well-known human pathogens; dengue, SARS, COVID. They all\nhave similar viral functions,\u201d Ding said. \u201cThis should be applicable to these\nviruses in an easy transfer of knowledge.\u201d\n\nShare this Article\n\nFacebookXLinkedInEmailPrintFriendly\n\n### Media Contacts\n\n#### Jules Bernstein\n\nSenior Public Information Officer\n\nEmail (951) 827-4580\n\nTags\n\nCollege Of Natural And Agricultural Sciences\n\nRSS Feeds\n\nCollege of Natural and Agricultural Sciences\n\nHomepage\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### Related Articles\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### Physicists solve puzzle about ancient galaxy found by Webb telescope\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### An earthquake in New Jersey?\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### Discovery could end global amphibian pandemic\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### Better math adds up to trillions in climate-related savings\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave. Riverside, CA 92521\n\nTel: (951) 827-1012\n\n  * UCR Library\n  * Campus Status\n  * Campus Store\n  * Career Opportunities\n  * Diversity\n  * Maps and Directions\n  * Visit UCR\n\n## University of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave. Riverside, CA 92521\n\ntel: (951) 827-0000 email: webmaster@ucr.edu\n\nFind Us\n\n### Related Links\n\nFollow Us:\n\n  * Privacy and Accessibility\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * \u00a9 2024 Regents of the University of California\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\nSearch\n\nThis website uses cookies to enable essential site functionality, improve your\nexperience, and analyze website traffic.
