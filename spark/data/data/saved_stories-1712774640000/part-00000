And you have problems getting the budget\nfor more developers? The first reason is probably that your founder thinks\nthis is a tech company but doesn\u2019t act like a tech CEO. They want to be Google\nbut don\u2019t act like Google - except pushing senseless OKRs on you.\n\nThe second reason is your CEO thinks marketing is a profit center and tech is\na cost center.\n\nA profit center is a department, where you put in $1 and get out $2. A cost\ncenter is where you put in $1 and get no money in return. When they spend\nmoney on marketing, they get new customers and more money back. When they\nspend money on tech, they don\u2019t get more money back. So they spend on product\n& tech only the smallest amount they need to while lavishing marketing with\nmoney in the hope of doubling it.\n\nWhat CTOs need to change, is to position product & tech as a profit center.\nThis is called framing. In the current frame, tech is a cost center (Read\n\u201cDon\u2019t Think Of An Elephant!\u201d, the most important book for CTOs.) With this\nframe in place, whatever you do, you will hardly get more money. You need to\nshift the frame to \u201cTech is a profit center\u201d and then getting more money is\neasy.\n\nDirectly tie product to revenue. One way to do this is revenue attribution. In\nmost companies, revenue and revenue growth is tied to marketing or sales.\nMaking the point that product provided the thing to sell and the features that\ndraw in customers is difficult to make. Product, in this regard, looks\npassive, and marketing or sales are actively doing something. It is easier to\nattribute recurring revenue to product because it prevents churn and increases\nupsells and add-on products.\n\nOne model would be looks like this. The first six months of customer value are\n100% attributed to marketing and/or sales, the next six months are 50%\nattributed to marketing and/or sales, and 50% are attributed to product &\ntech. After twelve months, revenue is 100% attributed to product & tech\nbecause they prevent churn and keep customers engaged. All upsell and add-on\nproducts revenue is attributed to product & tech from day one.\n\nProduct & tech understands customers by source, segment, etc. and in this way\ndeeply understands churn and feature usage. To make this work, you need to\nmeasure all usage of all features, have a dashboard and metrics, like X% of\ncustomers are using 80% of features in their first month. Customers who only\nuse Y% of features will churn. Customers who use feature f1, f2 and f3 will\nupgrade. Having this in place and discussing this with the CEO will make your\nargument work that product & tech is responsible for revenue. And you are\ndirectly responsible to drive revenue. With this alignment, the company will\nmake more money.\n\nIt is then clear, who is responsible for what revenue. With revenue attributed\nto product & tech it is clear, product & tech is a profit center. I put $1 in\nproduct & tech, and I get back $2. Now let the CEO gamble on you.\n\nTo optimize being a profit center, move everything except development, like\nlaptop provision etc. outside development, e.g. to the CFO. Move all license\ncosts (even GitHub) if possible to the CFOs budget, but at least don\u2019t have\nmarketing licensing costs in your budget like Hubspot, or internal costs like\nLinear or Notion (you do budgeting, don\u2019t you?). Activate software development\nas capital to further increase your usefulness in dollars. Think about patents\nto tie more income to product & tech.\n\nOne final point for companies to understand, is that developers add more money\nas a percentage of revenue, while marketing and sales add a constant amount of\nmoney. When a developer adds an upsell feature (costing $1 of developer time),\nand the company has 5 customers, they might get 1 customer to upsell. When the\ncompany has 5 million customers, that one developer might get 1 million\ncustomers to upsell. More developers are more beneficial when there already\nare more customers. When marketing spends $1 on marketing, they get 1 new\ncustomer. Independently of how much revenue the company already has.\n\nMake sure the CEO is aware of this too.\n\n## Join CTO Newsletter\n\n### Join more than 2000 CTOs and Engineering Managers\n\n### More Stuff from Stephan\n\n## Let New Hires Write A Todo App\n\n## Procrastination Does Not Exist\n\n## The ZigZag Model of Vision and Strategy\n\n## How To Succeed With A Rewrite\n\n## The Luck Formula\n\n## The AI Manager - The End of Programming\n\n## Other interesting articles for CTOs\n\n\u2022 Best books for CTO \u2022 The CTO Book \u2022 Experienced CTO Coach \u2022 CTO Coaching \u2022\nCTO Mentor \u2022 CTO Mentoring \u2022 CTO Newsletter \u2022 How many developers do you need?\n\u2022 Postgres for Everything Product Roadmaps for CTOs \u2022 How to become a CTO in a\ncompany - a career path\n\nBooks By Stephan Amazing CTO Book Other Articles\n\nProcrastination Does Not Exist\n\n\u2728 Min vs Max Problem Solving\n\nMisconceptions about the CPTO role\n\nOur Fetish with Failover and Redundancy\n\nThe 5 Reasons Not to Use Scrum\n\nOther Articles\n\nDear Paul Graham, there is no cookie banner law\n\nRemote Work and Fair Developer Salaries\n\nLearn from Success Not From Failure\n\nOur Fetish with Failover and Redundancy\n\nMy CTO Book | Contact: stephan@amazingcto.com | Privacy | Impressum\n\n", "frontpage": false}
