We\u2019re all\nworried about this. Timed really scared us.\u201d\n\nPam Melroy has warned of the dangers of 'space junk' Credit: Eric\nThayer/Bloomberg\n\nOn Tuesday, Nasa launched its Space Sustainability Strategy, which aims to\nbetter map and monitor satellites and debris, and keep orbits as clear as\npossible.\n\nThere are currently more than 10,000 satellites orbiting the Earth \u2013 a four-\nfold increase since 2019 \u2013 and numbers are set to grow exponentially.\n\nSome 400,000 satellites have been approved globally for low Earth orbit, with\nSpaceX alone poised to launch another 44,000 for its Starlink internet\nconstellation.\n\nExperts have predicted that once all the planned internet constellations are\noperational there will be around 16,000 decaying satellites at any one time\nthat will need to come out of orbit.\n\nNot only are the dead satellites clogging up valuable orbit space but they\nrisk setting off a major disaster.\n\n## Kessler Syndrome\n\nIn 1978, Donald Kessler, a Nasa scientist, predicted that when enough objects\nare in low Earth orbit, any collision would set off a catastrophic chain\nreaction that would send wreckage into the path of other satellites, breaking\nthem apart and releasing more debris.\n\nIt is known as Kessler Syndrome, and the subsequent swirling debris cloud of\nfast-travelling wreckage would make space inaccessible for everyone and wipe\nout critical satellite systems.\n\nNasa said it was planning to invest more heavily in detection, tracking, and\ncollision avoidance to prevent a catastrophic smash. It said it would start in\nEarth\u2019s orbit, then move on to tracking objects around the Moon and further\nafield.\n\nThe space agency also warned that failing to keep space clear could damage\nastronomy. Many large telescopes now struggle with streaks in their images\nwhere satellites have flown across their field of view.\n\nCol Melroy added: \u201cThis problem is monumental. We can\u2019t even agree on how many\npieces of debris are in orbit because we have so many models out there.\n\n\u201cSpace is busy. We have been making it harder on ourselves and so Nasa is\nputting a way forward that will make sure we do the right thing.\u201d\n\nSeveral companies, including Airbus, Astroscale and ClearSpace are working on\nspacecraft which can catch dead satellites and bring them down to the Earth.\n\nThe first tests of the technology are expected to take place within the next\ntwo years.\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Nasa (National Aeronautics and Space Administration),\n  * International Space Station,\n  * Roscosmos,\n  * Satellites\n\n29\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
