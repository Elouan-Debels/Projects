For the disease affecting elm\ntrees, see Dutch elm disease.\n\nIn economics, Dutch disease is the apparent causal relationship between the\nincrease in the economic development of a specific sector (for example natural\nresources) and a decline in other sectors (like the manufacturing sector or\nagriculture).\n\nThe term was coined in 1977 by The Economist to describe the decline of the\nmanufacturing sector in the Netherlands after the discovery of the large\nGroningen natural gas field in 1959.^[1]\n\nThe presumed mechanism is that while revenues increase in a growing sector (or\ninflows of foreign aid), the given economy's currency becomes stronger\n(appreciates) compared to foreign currencies (manifested in the exchange\nrate). This results in the country's other exports becoming more expensive for\nother countries to buy, while imports become cheaper, altogether rendering\nthose sectors less competitive.\n\nWhile it most often refers to natural resource discovery, it can also refer to\n\"any development that results in a large inflow of foreign currency, including\na sharp surge in natural resource prices, foreign assistance, and foreign\ndirect investment\".^[2]\n\n## Model[edit]\n\nNatural gas concessions in the Netherlands (June 2008), the Netherlands\naccounts for more than 25% of all natural gas reserves in the EU.\n\nThe classic economic model describing Dutch disease was developed by the\neconomists W. Max Corden and J. Peter Neary in 1982. In the model, there is a\nnon-tradable sector (which includes services) and two tradable sectors: the\nbooming sector, and the lagging (or non-booming) tradable sector. The booming\nsector is usually the extraction of natural resources such as oil, natural\ngas, gold, copper, diamonds or bauxite, or the production of crops, such as\ncoffee or cocoa. The lagging sector is usually manufacturing or agriculture.\n\nA resource boom affects this economy in two ways:\n\n  1. In the \"resource movement effect\", the resource boom increases demand for labor, which causes production to shift toward the booming sector, away from the lagging sector. This shift in labor from the lagging sector to the booming sector is called direct deindustrialization. However, this effect can be negligible, since the hydrocarbon and mineral sectors tend to employ few people.^[3]\n  2. The \"spending effect\" occurs as a result of the extra revenue brought in by the resource boom. It increases demand for labor in the non-tradable sector (services), at the expense of the lagging sector. This shift from the lagging sector to the non-tradable sector is called indirect deindustrialization.^[3] The increased demand for non-traded goods increases their price. However, prices in the traded good sector are set internationally, so they cannot change. This amounts to an increase in the real exchange rate.^[4]\n\n### Resource-based international trade[edit]\n\nIn a model of international trade based on resource endowments as the\nHeckscher\u2013Ohlin/Heckscher\u2013Ohlin-Vanek, the Dutch disease can be explained by\nthe Rybczynski theorem.\n\n## Effects[edit]\n\nSimple trade models suggest that a country should specialize in industries in\nwhich it has a comparative advantage; thus a country rich in some natural\nresources would be better off specializing in the extraction of those natural\nresources.\n\nHowever, other theories suggest that this is detrimental, for example when the\nnatural resources deplete. Also, prices may decrease and competitive\nmanufacturing cannot return as quickly as it left. This may happen because\ntechnological growth is smaller in the booming sector and the non-tradable\nsector than the non-booming tradable sector.^[5] Because that economy had\nsmaller technological growth than did other countries, its comparative\nadvantage in non-booming tradable goods will have shrunk, thus leading firms\nnot to invest in the tradables sector.^[6]\n\nAlso, volatility in the price of natural resources, and thus the real exchange\nrate, limits investment by private firms, because firms will not invest if\nthey are not sure what the future economic conditions will be.^[7] Commodity\nexports such as raw materials drive up the value of the currency. This is what\nleads to the lack of competition in the other sectors of the economy. The\nextraction of natural resources is also extremely capital intensive, resulting\nin few new jobs being created.^[8]\n\n## Minimization[edit]\n\nThere are three basic ways to reduce the threat of Dutch disease: (1) slowing\nthe appreciation of the real exchange rate, (2) boosting the competitiveness\nof the adversely affected sectors, and (3) demographic adaptation. One\napproach is to withhold the boom revenues, that is, not to bring all the\nrevenues into the country all at once, and to save some of the revenues abroad\nin special funds and bring them in slowly. In developing countries, this can\nbe politically difficult as there is often pressure to spend the boom revenues\nimmediately to alleviate poverty, but this ignores broader macroeconomic\nimplications.\n\nWithholding shall reduce the spending effect, alleviating some of the effects\nof inflation. Another benefit of letting the revenues into the country slowly\nis that it can give a country a stable revenue stream, giving more certainty\nto revenues from year to year. Also, by saving the boom revenues, a country is\nsaving some of the revenues for future generations. Examples of these\nsovereign wealth funds include the Australian Government Future Fund, Iranian\nnational development fund, the Government Pension Fund in Norway, the\nStabilization Fund of the Russian Federation, the State Oil Fund of\nAzerbaijan, Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund of Alberta, Canada, the\nPermanent School Fund and Permanent University Fund of Texas, the Alaska\nPermanent Fund and the Future Generations Fund of the State of Kuwait\nestablished in 1976. Recent^[when?] talks led by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme in Cambodia \u2013 International Oil and Gas Conference on\nfueling poverty reduction \u2013 point out the need for better education of state\nofficials and energy CaDREs (Capacity Needs Diagnostics for Renewable\nEnergies) linked to a sovereign wealth fund to avoid the resource curse\n(Paradox of plenty).^[9]\n\nAnother strategy for avoiding real exchange rate appreciation is to increase\nsaving in the economy in order to reduce large capital inflows which may\nappreciate the real exchange rate. This can be done if the country runs a\nbudget surplus. A country can encourage individuals and firms to save more by\nreducing income and profit taxes. By increasing saving, a country can reduce\nthe need for loans to finance government deficits and foreign direct\ninvestment.\n\nInvestments in education and infrastructure can increase the competitiveness\nof the lagging manufacturing or agriculture sector. Another approach is\ngovernment protectionism of the lagging sector, that is, increase in subsidies\nor tariffs. However, this could worsen the effects of Dutch disease, as large\ninflows of foreign capital are usually provided by the export sector and\nbought up by the import sector. Imposing tariffs on imported goods will\nartificially reduce that sector's demand for foreign currency, leading to\nfurther appreciation of the real exchange rate.^[10]\n\n## Diagnosis[edit]\n\nIt is usually difficult to be certain that a country has Dutch disease because\nit is difficult to prove the relationship between an increase in natural\nresource revenues, the real-exchange rate, and a decline in the lagging\nsector. An appreciation in the real exchange rate could be caused by other\nthings such as productivity increases in the Balassa-Samuelson effect, changes\nin the terms of trade and large capital inflows.^[11] Often these capital\ninflows are caused by foreign direct investment or to finance a country's\ndebt. However, evidence does exist suggesting that unexpected and very large\noil and gas discoveries do cause the appreciation of the real exchange rate\nand the decline of the lagging sector across affected countries on\naverage.^[12]\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\n  * Gold and other wealth imported to Spain and Portugal during the 16th century from the Americas.^[13]^[14]\n  * Australian gold rush in the 19th century, first documented by Cairns in 1859.^[13]\n  * Kuwaiti oil from the 1960s to present.^[15]\n  * Indonesia's greatly increased export revenues after the oil booms in 1974 and 1979.^[16]\n  * The effect of North Sea oil on manufacturing sectors in Norway and the United Kingdom in 1970\u20131990.^[17]\n  * Analysts have argued that the United Kingdom's increasing reliance on the financial sector since the 'Big Bang' in 1986 is preventing manufacturing growth.^[18]^[19]^[20] A similar argument has been made regarding London's booming property market.^[21] This financial sector growth has been concentrated, almost exclusively, on the City of London exacerbating regional economic differences such as the North\u2013South divide \u2013 the North previously having a strong industrial and manufacturing base. Paul Krugman (among others) has written about the effect of a strong financial sector on UK manufacturing and a potential readjustment following Brexit, should the financial sector reduce its reliance on London.^[22]^[23]^[24]\n  * Nigeria and other post-colonial African states in the 1990s.^[25]\n  * Venezuelan oil for certain periods throughout its history. A notable case occurred during the first presidency of Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez when he established Venezuela as a rentier state.^[26]\n  * Post-disaster booms accompanied by inflation following the provision of large amounts of relief and recovery assistance such as occurred in some places in Asia following the Asian tsunami in 2004.^[27]\n  * Canada's rising dollar due to foreign demand for natural resources, with the Athabasca oil sands becoming increasingly dominant, hampered its manufacturing sector from the early 2000s until the oil price crash in late 2014/early 2015.^[28]^[29]\n  * The Philippines' strong foreign exchange market inflows in the 2000s leading to appreciation of currency and loss of competitiveness.^[30]\n  * Signs of emerging Dutch disease in Chile in the late 2000s, due to the boom in mineral commodity prices.^[31]\n  * Australian mineral commodities in the 2000s and 2010s.^[32]^[33]^[34]\n  * Russian oil and natural gas in the 2000s and 2020s.^[35]^[36]\n  * Azerbaijani oil in the 2000s and 2020s.^[37]\n  * In the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area's reliance on the high technology sector in the 21st century.^[38]\n  * Ransoms from Somali piracy.^[39]\n  * Nauru's heavy reliance on phosphate mining, combined with a lack of taxes and large government expenses, caused issues after the depletion of much of its reserves. The country came close to bankruptcy in 2000, and the unemployment rate rose to 90% in 2004. Nauru was for a time the world's richest country (GDP per capita), but has since fallen in ranking to 117th place (Worldbank, 2022).^[40]^[41]^[42]^[43]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Balance of trade\n  * Price\u2013specie flow mechanism\n  * Beggar thy neighbour\n  * Tragedy of the commons\n  * Resource curse\n  * Norwegian paradox\n  * Zero-sum game\n  * Gentrification\n  * Rasizade's algorithm\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"The Dutch Disease\" (PDF).
