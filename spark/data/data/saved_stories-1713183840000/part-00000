Patel\n\nDec. 1, 2015\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nOn September 19, 1990, a forgettable event failed to change the course of\nhuman history. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigned the Soviet\nUnion .su as its country code top-level domain. This presumably would have\nmattered a great deal more if the \u201cEvil Empire\u201d hadn\u2019t collapsed 15 months\nlater, but .su, notably, didn\u2019t collapse with its country. The domain lives on\nand now, 25 years laters, it\u2019s making a strange and unsettling comeback.\n\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning: ccTLDs are like the country codes used in\ninternational phone calls. As opposed to top-level domains like .com (for\ncommercial entities) or .org (for organizations in the public interest),\nccTLDs are reserved for use by people or groups operating in a specific\ncountry, state, or territory \u2014 for the most part anyway. Back when the\ninternet was first becoming a popular tool, different countries began\nregistering their own ccTLDs. In 1985, the U.S. got .us, the U.K. got .uk, and\nIsrael got .il. A year later Australia (.au), West Germany (.de), France\n(.fr), Japan (.jp), and a few others all registered their own ccTLDs as well.\n\nThe Russians were predictably late to the party. The country had many other\nproblems to deal with at the time, so you can\u2019t really blame Moscow for\nfailing to notice the internet. At the time, getting on line generally meant\nqueuing up for beets.\n\nSoviet propaganda\n\nAfter others from the ol\u2019 communist bloc \u2014 like Poland (.pl), Yugoslavia (.yu)\nand East Germany (.dd) \u2014 got their ccTLDs registered, the Soviets finally got\naround to registering .su. At the time, few USSR webpages existed, and most of\nthem were used by academics trying to connect with their colleagues around\nthem world. A four-letter .ussr domain would have been more appropriate, but a\nsuggestion by a 19-year-old Finnish student lead to .su. (This raises many\nquestions as to how much influence international teenagers had over the\ndirection of cyberspace within the Soviet Union, and whether this may have\nextended to other parts of the Russian life. Could explain decades of\nbelligerent, bellicose foreign policy.)\n\nWhen the country finally dissolved in December of 1991, the domain was\nsupposed to be phased out, as was the case for others like .dd and .yu. But it\ndidn\u2019t go softly: .ru wasn\u2019t even assigned until 1994, meaning there was a\ntwo-month period when any newly minted Russian who wished to create a website\nhad to use .su. When IANA, which is now part of ICANN, was supposed to finally\nwithdraw .su, there was enough pushback by Russian officials \u2014 loyalists after\na fashion \u2014and users to persuade them to spare its life.\n\nFast-forward to 2001, when the managers of the domain, the Russian Institute\nfor Public Networks, opened up .su to new registrations, in spite of ICANN\u2019s\npublic desire to terminate it. As of today, there are 119,423 registered .su\nsites. Anyone \u2014 and I really do mean anyone \u2014 can get one for a flat fee of\n$29.95 per year. All you have to do is go to Register.su and provide the\nnecessary information.\n\nStrangely, the site is operated by a team based in New York City. Inverse\u2019s\nRepeated attempts to contact them failed, but those interested in registering\ntheir own .su website just have to get in touch with Register.su by phone or\nemail. It typically takes one business day to get registered (assuming you pay\nvia PayPal).\n\nBecause of how easy it is to register, the .su domain has attracted a lot of\nattention from cybercriminals looking for a safe haven to conduct operations.\nAdministrators for Russia\u2019s .ru domain began tightening rules in late 2011,\nspurring a migration to .su starting in 2012. \u201cIn my opinion more than half of\ncybercriminals in Russia and former USSR use it,\u201d Andrei Komarov, from Russian\ninternet watchdog Group-IB, told the Guardian in 2013.\n\nThese activities range from sending spam, launching DDoS attacks against other\nwebsites, mediating networks of hijacked computers that can empty bank\naccounts, to publishing credit records belonging to ordinary citizens and\ncelebrity figures alike. Moreover, many registrars in other countries who\nstill operate arcane domains will ignore requests to take down illicit and\nabusive websites. If you have a .su website and are complicit in illegal\nactivities, chances are you\u2019re not losing the URL.\n\nUsers of .su reportedly include anti-Russian Ukrainians, who are adopting the\ndomain of the former Soviet Union as a way to harken back to the \u201cantifascism\u201d\nof the communist bloc. So, if you got a lot of time on your free hands, and\nsome up-to-date antivirus software installed on your computer, go ahead and\nstart plugging in .su website into the url bar, and take a stroll down one of\nthe weirdest parts of the internet.\n\nNext time you drop your MacBook in St. Petersburg, you\u2019ll definitely want to\nhead to the local \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442-\u043a\u0430\u0444\u0435 and go to ironbook.su.
