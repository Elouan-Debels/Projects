The screamer, Hugh\nPanero, blames Mossberg for his company's recent problems: falling stock\nprice, a sudden plunge in consumer interest. Mossberg is annoyed but hardly\nintimidated. As the author of the weekly \"Personal Technology\" column in The\nWall Street Journal, he's used to dealing with disgruntled execs. He lets\nPanero shout. A crowd is gathering. Finally, Mossberg yells back, \"I don't\ngive a fuck about your stock price!\"\n\nIn truth, Mossberg liked Panero's company, XM Satellite Radio, which beams\nmore than 100 channels of music \u2013 rock, hip hop, jazz, country, you name it \u2013\ndirectly to cars nationwide. The early reviews were enthusiastic, and\ninvestors loved the stock. But Mossberg hated the special radios that drivers\nneeded to buy from the company to get the signal. In his column, he slammed\nthe spotty reception and said the radios were poorly designed, hard to use,\nand too expensive. On the morning the column appeared, just five days before\nthe conference opened, XM's stock fell 8.5 percent. Reuters reported that\nMossberg's column was driving down the price.\n\nWaiting for a flight back to Washington after the conference, Mossberg is\neating a Burger King breakfast at Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport\nwhen Panero walks by. This time the entrepreneur is calm. The two men realize\nthey're on the same plane and arrange to sit together in first class.\n(Mossberg got his ticket using upgrade coupons.) Once they're in the air,\nPanero admits that Mossberg is right about XM's hardware. A few months later,\nXM rolls out a new line of price-slashed radios with better controls for\nscrolling channels, plus larger screens for identifying the songs and artists.\nA year after the original review, in January 2003, Mossberg writes a column\nwholeheartedly recommending the new offerings.\n\nTrending Now\n\nBefore the i-Everything, There Was Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak & the Apple lle\n\nXM is only one of dozens of companies that have redesigned products in\nresponse to Mossberg's unsparing criticism. RealNetworks overhauled its\nRealJukebox player. Intuit revamped TurboTax. Mossberg even forced Microsoft\nto scrap Smart Tags, which would have hijacked millions of Web sites by\ninserting unwanted links to advertisers' sites. Few reviewers have held so\nmuch power to shape an industry's successes and failures. Mossberg evokes\ncomparisons to Robert Parker on wine and Frank Rich during Rich's\ncontroversial tenure as the Broadway critic of The New York Times. At least\none grad school thesis has been written on Mossberg's clout. \"He's one of the\nmost trusted and influential voices in technology,\" says Yahoo! cofounder\nJerry Yang.\n\nDisarmingly bright, blunt, fervent, and combative, Mossberg was an\ninvestigative reporter for two decades before becoming a tech pundit, and he\nhas a heady sense of his ability to keep the industry chieftains in check. His\nMO: posing as the champion of the \"normal\" or \"average\" tech consumer, though\nhe's hardly one himself. Close friend and Journal reporter Kara Swisher calls\nhim \"a freakish geek.\"\n\nStill, his success comes from demystifying the digital realm for readers who\naren't regular Slashdot contributors. He's on a mission to remake the tech\nworld according to his own fetish for simplicity, reliability, effectiveness,\nand great design. Chances are he has influenced the look, feel, and\nperformance of your laptop, mobile phone, and MP3 player.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nMossberg's been a fiery crusader since the opening line of \"Personal\nTechnology,\" which debuted in 1991: \"Personal computers are just too hard to\nuse, and it isn't your fault.\" His quest has earned him legions of fans, but\nhe's also angered many, who think he's arrogant, curmudgeonly, and subjective\n\u2013 and who wonder how deeply he understands the nitty-gritty of technology. His\nlatest enemies: open source partisans, who chafed when he picked Microsoft\nOffice over StarOffice, an open source darling.\n\nThe detractors and the wounded multiply, but Mossberg keeps expanding his\nvaluable franchise. Unfazed by a 1997 heart attack and subsequent quadruple\nbypass, he does three weekly columns in addition to a weekly appearance on\nCNBC's Power Lunch and a monthly column for Smart Money. And, with Swisher, he\nhosts D: All Things Digital, the annual $2,995-a-person, three-day executive\nconference in early June at the Four Seasons resort in Carlsbad, California.\n\nWhen I visit Mossberg at the Journal's Washington bureau, a few blocks north\nof the White House, he's blasting Billy Joel's \"An Innocent Man\" in his\nspacious private office. Friends say that Mossberg has three obsessions:\nmusic, Star Trek (he knows all the episodes and gadgets), and the Boston Red\nSox. He's 57, a baby boomer who loves the Beatles, Motown, Paul Simon, Chuck\nBerry, James Taylor, and Mary Chapin Carpenter. Lately his assistant, Katie\nBoehret, 23, and his son Steven, 26, who's trying to make it as a professional\nmusician, have gotten him into newer music. He says he's \"nuts\" for Fountains\nof Wayne, and he likes Coldplay and John Mayer.\n\nMossberg holds an unlit cigar, which he'll carry and chomp on throughout the\nafternoon but never light up. Smoking isn't allowed at the office. He puffs $7\nCohibas (the legal Dominican ones) but buys cheaper brands for chewing. Like\nSteve Jobs, his wardrobe leans toward the monotonous. He favors Eddie Bauer\noxford shirts with button-down collars, and Dockers or jeans. He may be a\nmedia big shot, but Mossberg's tastes aren't grand. He lives in an\nunremarkable house in Potomac, Maryland, that he's owned for 10 years. He\ndrives a Mercedes, but it's a C-Class, which he describes as \"the cheapest and\nsmallest Mercedes, with an iPod velcroed to the dashboard and jacked into the\naudio system.\"\n\nAs we walk around the bureau, we come to a kitchen. Mossberg offers me a Diet\nCoke, puts a quarter into the vending machine, then hesitates.\n\n\"Is it going to bias you if I buy you a soda?\"\n\nI'm not sure if he's joking.\n\nHe takes me to Boehret's windowless office, which includes \"the vault,\" a\nstorage room holding the many unsolicited products they receive \u2013 and always\nsend back after they play with them. An earlier assistant, James Hoppes,\ncreated a database to track all the stuff they get. \"Every day was like\nChristmas,\" Hoppes recalls. \"Big packages with cool gadgets.\" Mossberg keeps\nnone of it. The product clutter is even worse at home. \"Oh my God,\" says Edie,\nhis wife, \"the proliferation! Everything has to be sent back, so you can't get\nrid of the boxes. They grow like topsy. I say, This is it! Everything's got to\ngo by Thanksgiving. Clear out the living room.\"\n\nAlan Deutschman (deutschman@aol.com) is the author of The Second Coming of\nSteve Jobs and A Tale of Two Valleys.\n\nBack in Mossberg's office, he shows me his \"computer museum\": a wall of\nbookshelves filled with vintage machines. There's a Timex Sinclair 1000 (his\nfirst computer), an Apple IIe, a portable Apple IIc, a first-gen Macintosh, a\nRadio Shack TRS 80 Model 100, a Palm Pilot, an Atari 800. Mossberg was an\nearly home-computing hobbyist, enraptured by the possibilities of technology\nbut frustrated by its limitations. He souped up his Apple IIe by adding\nmemory, one chip at a time, which amazed Edie. \"This was a guy who wasn't\nmechanical in any way,\" she says. \"He wasn't handy.\" Mossberg even tried to\nexchange text messages with Journal colleague Rich Jaroslovsky on 300-baud\nmodems before the advent of online services.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nMossberg is interrupted by a phone call from a flack at Apple about his\ncritique of the iPod mini, which will run in tomorrow's paper. The publicist\nis concerned that Mossberg will write about his prerelease model crashing,\neven though the problem has since been fixed in the final production version.\nHe was the only reviewer to receive preproduction minis from Apple, which\nenables him to publish the first real review of the new gadget \u2013 an enviable\nscoop. Mossberg will mention the crash, but overall his column will be\npositive. \"Tell Steve not to get upset,\" Mossberg says.\n\nThe star of The Wall Street Journal, that bastion of elite capitalism, comes\nfrom the working class. His grandfather toiled as an upholsterer. His father\npeddled dishes and blankets door-to-door to millworkers.\n\nMossberg discovered journalism as a teenager in suburban Warwick, Rhode\nIsland, when he cowrote a weekly column about high school for the Providence\nJournal-Bulletin. (He collaborated with his best friend, James Woods, the\nfuture film star.) Mossberg relished going downtown to turn in his copy at the\n\"old smelly newsroom with fans and peeling green paint,\" he recalls. \"I was\nbitten by the journalism bug.\"\n\nAs a Brandeis student he protested the Vietnam War and campaigned for\nDemocratic presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy in the 1968 primary. But\nalready \"he was focused on being a reporter,\" recalls dormmate Ira Shapiro. He\nspent summers covering crime and politics for the Providence newspaper.\n\nHe met Edith Marcus as a freshman in Politics 1A. They married the week after\ngraduation and headed to Columbia University \u2013 Walt for a master's in\njournalism, Edie to Teachers College. The journalism students were assigned to\n\"hang out\" at publications between semesters. Mossberg ended up at The Wall\nStreet Journal. \"I had never read the Journal,\" he says. \"My grandfather was a\nunion organizer. We were workers.\" But the paper impressed him.\n\nIn 1970, Mossberg accepted a reporting job there for $9,000 a year. His\nambition was to cover Washington, but the editors told him to name three\nsmaller bureaus, promising he'd get one of them. He requested San Francisco,\nChicago, or Boston. The call came back: \"When can you be in Detroit?\"\n\nSporting shoulder-length hair and long sideburns, Mossberg arrived at the\nDetroit bureau and took a desk next to another rookie, Norman Pearlstine (who\nbecame the Journal's managing editor a decade later). \"He was whip smart,\"\nPearlstine recalls, \"and he typed faster with one finger than anyone I knew.\"\n\nMossberg's earliest scoop was uncovering that American Motors Corporation was\ngoing to announce the industry's first bumper-to-bumper warranty. When he\nasked AMC's executives for comment, they called the Journal's brass in New\nYork and threatened to pull their ads if the story ran prior to AMC's big\nannouncement. The managing editor told the Detroit bureau chief: Hold the\nstory for one night so Mossberg can triple-check the facts, and then we'll run\nit even longer and with a bigger headline. AMC pulled its ads; Mossberg's\nbosses gave him a raise. \"I learned about the power and integrity of a great\nnewspaper and how it feels to report and write what you think is the real\nstory,\" he says. \"It was exhilarating.\"\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nIn 1973, Mossberg moved to Washington, where he covered a series of beats over\ntwo decades: labor, energy, defense, and economics. After the Three Mile\nIsland disaster, he searched through Nuclear Regulatory Commission records and\nuncovered similar problems at other atomic plants. During the Reagan years, he\nrevealed classified documents about new weapons failing tests and busting\nbudgets.\n\nIn 1987, Mossberg cowrote a front-page story on the stock market crash that\nprompted Treasury secretary James Baker to shut himself off from the press for\nthree months. (The piece convincingly argued that Baker was in over his head\nwhen it came to economic policy.) When Baker became secretary of state under\nPresident Bush, Mossberg became the Journal's diplomatic reporter. \"I flew\naround the world nonstop with Baker during tremendous upheaval,\" Mossberg\nsays. \"The end of the Cold War. The reunification of Germany. Moscow, Eastern\nEurope, then Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War.\"\n\nThe frenetic travel proved difficult on his family life. \"We knew when he was\nleaving, but we never knew when he would be coming back,\" Edie recalls. In\n1990, when Mossberg's sons were 8 and 12, he conceived of a new gig that would\nenable him to wield influence from home: a tech column. He had been captivated\nby computers and gadgetry for 20 years. As PC sales skyrocketed in the early\n'90s, he sensed a historic shift: \"I believed that the tech market was about\nto broaden and democratize, and the column could catch the wave.\"\n\nFrom its launch, Mossberg knew exactly what he wanted. \"Personal Technology\"\nwould be utterly different from the reviews already out there: \"They were by\ngeeks for geeks, filled with jargon, condescending to nontechies, and\nreverential about the computer and the computer industry,\" he says. \"I wanted\nto write for the nontech user and be critical of the industry.\"\n\nMossberg may have been clear about his new direction, but many of his higher-\nups were not. \"There was extraordinary resistance on all levels of Dow Jones\n[which owns the Journal],\" recalls Pearlstine, who greenlighted the column and\nstuck by his old friend. \"People said, We don't render opinions on our news\npages, and who cares about personal computers?\"\n\nAt first, he had to fight the perception that he'd dropped out of the race for\npower and influence. \"Many Washington journalists I'd worked with, and some\npeople in government, wondered if I'd been demoted,\" Mossberg says. \"James\nBaker said, 'What the hell would you want to do that for?'\"\n\nBut when it debuted on October 17, 1991, \"Personal Technology\" was an\nimmediate hit. Mossberg's voice, amplified by the power of the Journal,\nresonated like no other. In 1992, he recommended America Online, an also-ran\nwith only 200,000 subscribers, over Prodigy, the leader with 1.8 million\nsubscribers and powerful backers, including Sears and IBM. \"Prodigy tried to\nget me fired,\" he recalls. Mossberg's endorsement \"really helped put AOL on\nthe map,\" admits founder Steve Case. \"It turbocharged our growth.\"\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nMossberg's proudest moment came in 2001, when he objected to Smart Tags, a\nfeature he tested in a beta version of Windows XP. Smart Tags could turn any\nword on a Web page into a link to a Microsoft property or sponsor's site\nwithout consent from the site's author.\n\nMossberg's column, which decried Smart Tags as a dangerous abuse of power,\ncreated an immediate uproar. Three weeks later, Microsoft executives leaked to\nMossberg that they were killing the feature \u2013 and privately said that his\ncolumn was why. \"Walt was in heaven with that one,\" says Paul Steiger, who\nsucceeded Pearlstine as the Journal's managing editor.\n\nMore recently, Mossberg blasted Intuit's TurboTax for \"treating everybody like\na criminal\" by secretly installing a monitoring program on PCs to prevent\npiracy. So he urged his readers to buy the rival, Tax Cut. Intuit received\nhundreds of emails in response \u2013 and backed off.\n\nHe delights in his mission to \"dress down companies when they need it.\" And he\nhardly seems daunted by taking on tech powers. \"It was hard for me to imagine\nbeing afraid of the wrath of Gates or Jobs when I had been criticized by the\nWhite House, the Pentagon, and the State Department.\"\n\nHis columns can be subjective \u2013 intentionally so. \"In the late '80s and early\n'90s, the industry put a lot of pressure on the computer press to wring the\nsubjectivity out,\" he says. \"But there's no way to do a bar chart that shows\nthat the Treo or the iPod is beautifully made and feels great in the hand.\"\n\nThe Mossberg brand is a vital franchise for the Journal, which has taken\nextraordinary measures to keep him. In 1997 \u2013 two years after Norm Pearlstine\nbecame editor in chief of Time Inc. \u2013 he tried to lure Mossberg to write for\nTime, Fortune, and Money. \"It was a huge offer,\" Mossberg says, \"just as my\nkids were starting to go to college.\" Paul Steiger told me that he approached\nPeter Kann, the CEO of Dow Jones, and asked if it could match Pearlstine's\noffer. That would have meant paying Mossberg more than Steiger himself earned.\nNevertheless, Steiger pushed for it, even enlisting the support of the\nJournal's ad salespeople, who confirmed that Mossberg's credibility helped\nattract tech advertisers.\n\nKann approved the request, and Mossberg stayed. A published report says that\nMossberg is the Journal's highest-paid writer, at $500,000 a year. Mossberg\nsays the figure isn't accurate (but not whether it's high or low) and that he\ndoesn't know what anyone else there makes. Pearlstine allows $500,000 \"doesn't\nseem unreasonable\" but that Mossberg \"may be making more than that now.\"\n\nAlong the way, Mossberg has been a generous mentor to many younger writers.\nAfter admiring Kara Swisher's work at The Washington Post, he got her a job at\nthe Journal. Mossberg even gave away Swisher at her wedding to Megan Smith,\nthe former CEO of PlanetOut, in a waterfront ceremony in Northern California.\n\"My father died when I was 5,\" Swisher explains. At the reception, Mossberg\ndelivered a funny, moving tribute. Edie later told him: \"Why couldn't we have\nhad such a nice wedding?\"\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nMossberg has had two brushes with death. On 9/11 he left his hotel at the\nWorld Trade Center and took a taxi uptown a half hour before the first plane\nhit. In 1997, he had a major heart attack. It wasn't totally unexpected,\nMossberg says. The men in his family have a history of heart problems that\nstrike young.\n\nIn the hospital after his cardiac arrest, while awaiting bypass surgery,\nMossberg lay in bed studying Web sites on the subject. \"By the time he met the\nsurgeons, he had read all about them,\" Edie recalls. They transplanted an\nartery from his arm to his heart in a quadruple bypass. When Mossberg returned\nto work three months later, \"he seemed to come out of it very well,\" says\nSteiger. \"His spirits were very strong and his health seemed much stronger.\"\n\nMossberg dieted and slimmed down to what one Journal staffer called \"the sleek\nnew Walt.\" His revitalization inspired confidence that he could maintain and\neven expand his workload. In addition to writing \"Personal Technology\" and\n\"Mossberg's Mailbox,\" a Q&A feature, he launched \"The Mossberg Solution\" and,\nlast year, the D conference. It helps that much of the research and product\ntesting for \"Solution\" is done by Katie Boehret, who brings a youthful,\nunmonied, and female perspective to complement Mossberg's well-off aging male\npersonality.\n\nHer influence showed when Mossberg tested the Suunto PDA wristwatch this\nwinter. The technology comes from Microsoft, where it was a longtime pet\nproject of Bill Gates himself. But the watch is ridiculously large and clunky\nbecause it needs space for a screen. \"I asked Katie, Would you date someone\nwho was wearing this watch?\" he says. \"And she said, 'No!'\" In his column two\ndays later, Mossberg is unsparing: \"In addition to the fact that the watches\nlook ugly and cheap to me, they don't deliver really detailed information.\"\n\nMossberg has gotten overweight again, which concerns his friends and family.\nWhen I asked Edie how much the heart attack changed Walt, she blurted, \"It\nshould have changed him more. When you first come out of it, you're healthy,\nhealthy! Now he slides back and forth.\" Mossberg admits, \"I'm bad at diet and\nexercise.\"\n\nHe remains intensely driven. He writes his columns the day before they're\npublished. (Now he types quickly with two fingers rather than one.) He has no\nbacklog. He begins work at 7 am and often tests products at home at night and\nsends emails until 1 am.\n\nThe D conference \u2013 which Mossberg and Swisher staged for the first time last\nyear \u2013 is the kind of new challenge he finds refreshing. It was named\nconference of the year by Conferenza.com, which reviews power schmooze-fests.\nThe first year's speakers included both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who rarely\nhave patience for these events anymore \u2013 and hadn't shared a stage with each\nother in many years. Other promoters would have to plead and bargain to land\nsuch big names; Mossberg just had to ask.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nThe conference drew a who's who of other marquee megaplayers: USA\nInteractive's Barry Diller, AOL Time Warner's Steve Case, eBay's Meg Whitman,\nYahoo!'s Terry Semel, and Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin. And Gates and\nJobs are returning for a second time, despite the prospect of being\ninterrogated onstage by Mossberg.\n\nAll this raises the possibility that Mossberg's objectivity and independence\nmight be compromised by his close ties to top execs. Besides being chummy with\nthem, he needs them to agree to appear at his conference. Doesn't that make\nhim pull punches? Mossberg rejects the idea. Sure enough, he criticized\nMicrosoft's clunky PDA watch in his column after Gates had agreed to serve as\na leading attraction for the confab.\n\nWhen Mossberg \"launched \"Personal Technology,\" Pearlstine wanted him to move\nto Silicon Valley. Mossberg refused to uproot his family. \"How will you see\nall the new products?\" Pearlstine asked. \"I'll go there a few times a year,\"\nMossberg responded, \"but they'll come to me whether I'm in Juneau or Fargo,\nbecause I'm The Wall Street Journal.\"\n\nHe was right. CEOs and product designers visit him in Washington every week to\ndemonstrate upcoming releases. Mossberg subjects them to probing\ninterrogations. \"If you want to pitch a product to Walt Mossberg, you better\nknow everything about it,\" says Hoppes, his former assistant.\n\nNaturally, some companies try to use their meetings with him to glean\nintelligence they can incorporate into products that he'll later review. Four\nyears ago, he sent a mass email to the publicists who pitch him: \"I am not a\nconsultant or adviser for you. I am not part of your development process. Even\nwhen I receive prerelease software or hardware or an advance look at a site or\nservice, I am not a tester. If I make opinionated comments or ask pointed\nquestions during a meeting or by email or phone while trying out products, it\nis strictly to elicit information from you for my own journalistic purposes. I\ntypically try to ask the questions and offer the reactions I imagine my\nreaders would. I state my views strongly, but I never utter them in the belief\nI am some sort of consultant or guru, and you would be mistaken to look upon\nthem that way.\"\n\nNonetheless, sometimes Mossberg does provide what amounts to free consulting.\nHoppes, in his 2001 Georgetown master's thesis (\"A Personal Technology\nJournalist's Influence on the Diffusion of Innovation \u2013 Case Study: Walt\nMossberg\"), reported that Mossberg stayed in touch with MusicMatch CEO Dennis\nMudd after publishing his review \"and still gives him advice about how to\nimprove the product.\" Mossberg denies that.\n\nMudd told Hoppes: \"His insights are exceptional. We really take them to heart.\nAt one point we were using opt-out personalization. Walt shot me an email and\nlet me know this was a big mistake, and recommended we should stay out of this\ngray area. We changed the policy per his recommendation. In hindsight, it was\nclearly the right thing to do.\" In his thesis, Hoppes concluded that \"Mossberg\nsometimes has a direct hand in the design of a product.\" And how many former\ndiplomatic reporters can say that?\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nThe Mossberg Effect\n\n| Walt said| What happened\n\n| \"CNET is the real deal \ufffd a serious, scrappy online news organization.\" (1996) | CNET\ufffds stock climbed 33 percent in the five days after the review.\n\n| \"This is simply the most gorgeous personal computer I\ufffdve ever seen or used.\" (2000) | Apple\ufffds stock price jumped 10 percent the day after his Cube review hit stands.\n\n| \"The initial radios are poorly designed \ufffd Navigation is a nightmare.\" (2002) | XM\ufffds stock dropped nearly 9 percent the day Mossberg panned its radios.\n\n| \"Overall, we like Vialta\ufffds idea of incorporating your television into a videophone.\" (2003) | Vialta\ufffds stock rose 15 percent the day the column ran.\n\n| \"Try it.
