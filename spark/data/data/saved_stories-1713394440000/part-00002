Easy flight in the\nsuper-dense atmosphere and ultra-low gravity of Saturn\u2019s cryogenic moon,\nTitan, makes it the perfect celestial body on which to test the idea. Paul\nMarks spoke to the team behind NASA\u2019s Dragonfly.\n\nIn 2034, high above Saturn\u2019s largest moon, the handiwork performed years\nearlier by engineers at a laboratory in Maryland will snap into action, if all\ngoes as planned. After a six-and-a-half-year cruise through deep space,\npunctuated by a gravity assist from Venus, a NASA-funded probe will plunge\ninto the thick orange haze of Titan\u2019s upper atmosphere, a heat shield\nprotecting the planetary explorer ensconced in its aeroshell from the\nincandescence of atmospheric entry.\n\nThis explorer, Dragonfly, will be unique in the annals of space exploration.\nAn octocopter roughly the size of a Mini Cooper, it will fly out of the\naeroshell and descend to its nominal flight altitude of 400 meters, where it\nwill train lidar and high-resolution cameras on the terrain below to seek a\nsafe, solid landing spot.\n\n## Related Stories\n\nBringing Mars down to Earth\n\nDragonfly\u2019s descent won\u2019t be anything like the complex \u201cseven minutes of\nterror\u201d skycrane deployment NASA\u2019s Curiosity and Perseverance rovers had to\nendure to land on Mars.\n\n\u201cOur entry, descent and landing profile on Titan is more like two hours of\nconcern,\u201d says Ken Hibbard, mission systems engineer and technical lead for\nDragonfly at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in\nMaryland.\n\nWhy so long? Titan\u2019s smog-laden atmosphere extends up to an altitude of over\n1,200 kilometers, or 10 times higher than the atmosphere of Mars. At the\nsurface, its density is 4.3 times that of Earth\u2019s, and its atmospheric\npressure is 1.4 times higher. And with only one-seventh of Earth\u2019s gravity\ngently tugging the spacecraft down, the consequence is a very slow descent\nindeed.\n\nOnce safely on the surface, Dragonfly can begin what its designers hope will\nbe more than three years of science operations at dozens of sites. After\nlanding, the drone will sample the surface material beneath it, analyze its\nchemistry and beam its data to Earth. But unlike wheeled rovers, it can then\nstart its rotors again and fly off to some very different, and very distant,\ngeological locations \u2014 using its cameras to navigate optically, informed by\nmapping data gleaned from flybys of NASA\u2019s Cassini probe \u2014 and do another\nbatch of surface science.\n\nIt\u2019s a three-year mission because one day on Titan, known as a T-sol, is 16\ndays on Earth \u2014 and Dragonfly\u2019s nominal mission length is slated at 74 T-sols,\nwhich equates to 3.2 terrestrial years. And in that time, says Hibbard, it\ncould have flown at least 180 kilometers, perhaps more. That\u2019s an order of\nmagnitude more than Curiosity, which has managed 28 kilometers over its decade\non Mars.\n\nAnd it is this science return that has dictated much of Dragonfly\u2019s\nengineering design. So what will scientists be trying to learn from it? The\nanswer: a whole lot about the primordial soup that led to the emergence of\nlife on Earth.\n\nDuring a 2012 flyby, NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft took the six images that formed\nthis mosaic of Titan orbiting in front of Saturn. The Dragonfly rotorcraft\u2019s\n2034 attempt to land on Titan will be the first since late 2004, when Cassini\ndeployed the European Space Agency\u2019s Huygens probe for a parachute-assisted\nlanding in early 2005. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute\n\n\u201cTitan might be the equivalent of the prebiological chemical state of Earth\nbillions of years ago,\u201d says Hibbard.\n\nA shade bigger than Mercury, Titan is deemed the most Earth-like celestial\nbody in our solar system because its dense nitrogen-based atmosphere \u2014 laden\nwith methane and a complex hydrocarbon haze of ethane, propane, ethylene and\nmethacetylene \u2014 supports a system that\u2019s in some ways comparable to Earth\u2019s\nhydrological cycle. But it is based on the condensation of methane, rather\nthan water: On Titan, clouds, rain, rivers, lakes and seas run with liquid\nmethane, thanks to the moon\u2019s cryogenic surface temperatures of minus 180\ndegrees Celsius, mainly a result of it being more than nine times farther from\nthe sun than Earth is, and global cooling due to the haze.\n\nAnd there is evidence from Titan\u2019s crater morphology that asteroid and comet\nimpacts may have melted water ice. That liquid water could therefore have\npersisted in the resulting craters for extended periods \u2014 perhaps for tens of\nthousands of years \u2014 due to the impact heat, says Dragonfly principal\ninvestigator Elizabeth \u201cZibi\u201d Turtle of the Applied Physics Lab, or APL.\n\nAnd that adds up to some very tantalizing possibilities. For one, \u201cTitan has\non its surface, or has had in its past on its surface, all of the ingredients\nwe know to be necessary for life,\u201d says Turtle.\n\nWith sunlight driving complex chemistry among large hydrocarbon molecules in\nTitan\u2019s upper atmosphere, some of the products of those reactions fall to the\nsurface, which is riven with wind-sculpted dunes comprised of mysterious\norganic, sandy particulates of unknown makeup. APL has not been able to create\nthese grainy substances in the lab. And if they meet water from Titan\u2019s\nsubsurface ocean or impact crater meltwater, \u201cyou\u2019ve got liquid water and\norganic material mixing for extended periods of time, much longer than we can\ndo experiments in the laboratory,\u201d says Turtle.\n\n\u201cAnd so Titan has been doing experiments in prebiotic chemistry \u2014 the chemical\nsteps that enabled chemistry to take the leap to biology \u2014 possibly over\nmillions of years. And really what Dragonfly is designed to do is to go pick\nup the results of those experiments.\u201d\n\n## Designing a relocatable lander\n\nTo date, the only craft that\u2019s touched down on Titan\u2019s surface is the\nEuropean-built Huygens lander in 2005 that hitched a ride aboard NASA\u2019s\nCassini probe, but that spacecraft was not designed for longevity and its\nbatteries died a little over an hour after its parachute-assisted descent. The\ngoal of engineering another mission to Titan has sparked some ambitious ideas\nover the years, Hibbard and Turtle say, including a boat or submarine that\ncould travel in its cryogenic oceans or balloons, helicopters and airplanes\nthat could fly to multiple locations in the dense, lift-generating atmosphere.\n\nThe APL team preferred a mobile explorer because Cassini, having mapped Titan\nover the span of 13 years and 126 flybys, found the terrain to be too highly\nvaried to gain a broad enough spread of science results at a single rover\nsite. There are, for instance, widely separated regions of organic sand dunes,\nbroad and flat interdune spaces, methane and ethane rivers, lakes, seas and\nnumerous impact craters. How could such a craft be controlled stably and also\nautonomously fly the many hundreds of kilometers between these sites? And how\ncould it be powered, given that Titan\u2019s haze makes the sun 100 to 1,000 times\ndimmer than on Earth?\n\nIn 2016, when NASA said it would consider Titan missions under its New\nFrontiers program, some members of the APL team realized that the convergence\nof two aerospace technologies suddenly made a rotorcraft an option for Titan.\n\n\u201cThe drone revolution had happened, and so an autonomous rotorcraft was no\nlonger a crazy idea,\u201d says Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at APL. He\nrecalls hatching the initial idea for a multirotor Dragonfly in a conversation\nwith his colleague Jason Barnes, a planetary scientist at the University of\nIdaho. The pair hashed out how such a craft might work over a group dinner at\na Texas restaurant after a NASA Outer Planets Assessment Group meeting.\n\nAnother fortuitous development: A new kind of plutonium power source, the\nMulti-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, had been developed by\nAerojet Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems under a U.S. Department of\nEnergy contract and was being made available to NASA missions that needed one.\nOne MMRTG had already flown on Curiosity, and another was planned for the\n(then upcoming) Perseverance rover.\n\n\u201cI had a head-slap moment, namely the realization that a rotorcraft of some\nsort would be a perfect fit with the MMRTG that NASA would make available,\u201d\nLorenz says. \u201cI had advocated Titan helicopters 16 years earlier, before the\nMMRTG had been developed, but the idea had seemed fanciful, and there wasn\u2019t\nthen available a power source that would work in a planetary atmosphere.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, NASA gave the Dragonfly project the go-ahead and a budget of $850\nmillion, excluding launch and operations costs. Lorenz is now mission\narchitect for Dragonfly, and Barnes is the program\u2019s deputy principal\ninvestigator.\n\nCurrently slated for a launch in June 2027 and arrival at Titan in 2034,\nDragonfly is the second NASA-commissioned planetary exploration rotorcraft\nafter the Ingenuity helicopter, which landed on Mars slung beneath\nPerseverance in 2021. During the 32 flights Ingenuity has made as of\nSeptember, it has demonstrated the sheer usefulness of dispatching a camera-\nequipped air scout to assess terrain for potential sampling. And underscoring\nthis success, in a change to NASA\u2019s Mars Sample Return program, mission\nplanners announced in July they\u2019ve decided to send two new uprated \u201cIngenuity-\nclass\u201d helicopters aboard MSR\u2019s Sample Retrieval Lander, scheduled to launch\ntoward Mars in 2028. Unlike the first Ingenuity, each would be equipped with\nwheels so they could traverse the surface and robot arms so they could grasp\nand carry sample test tubes \u2014 basically assisting Perseverance when needed.\n\nAnd there is fruitful cooperation between the rotorcraft teams at APL and\nNASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where Ingenuity was built and tested: \u201cAs\nwe\u2019ve been developing Dragonfly, we\u2019ve had a lot of really good, healthy\ninteractions with the Ingenuity team,\u201d Hibbard says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very\nsupportive of us, and we\u2019ve learned lessons from them. And some of their chief\nengineers are on our review boards.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Dragonfly\u2019s major subsystems faced preliminary design review analyses\nin July and August. So what does Dragonfly currently look like?\n\nDragonfly [See diagram] comprises a lander body supported on skids, measuring\n2.4 meters high from the ground to the top of a deployable high-gain antenna\nused for communicating with Earth. Four outriggers, each carrying two motors\nand two rotors, project from each side of the lander body, making the\n450-kilogram octocopter 3.7 meters wide. And from the nose to the MMRTG\ncontainment capsule at the rear, it also measures 3.7 meters.\n\nOne of the issues under the microscope is how, in Titan\u2019s excruciatingly cold\nambient temperatures of minus 180 Celsius, Dragonfly\u2019s electronics inside that\nlander body can be kept anywhere near warm enough to function well. On Mars,\nby comparison, Ingenuity basks in a toasty minus 60 C.\n\nAn early problem the Dragonfly engineering team overcame was how to customize\nits MMRTG power source. As supplied, the unit normally comprises a cylinder\ncontaining a radioactive heat source and thermocouples that use a\nsemiconductor junction to convert heat into a current, generating 110 watts of\nelectricity. Fins the length of the cylinder usually radiate away waste heat.\n\nOn ultra-frigid Titan, however, heat is valuable.\n\n\u201cBecause the MMRTG has about 2,000 watts of thermal power that are waste heat,\nwe actually try to trap all that inside our lander to keep it warm,\u201d Hibbard\nsays. \u201cSo we\u2019ve cut the fin length in half because we don\u2019t want to radiate\nthat heat away. And we have a series of fans that pull the waste heat from the\nMMRTG and distribute it under the lander body up to the nose.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s vital with the thermal management of Dragonfly is to ensure that the\nscience platform at the heart of the machine does not freeze up. That science\npackage comprises:\n\n  * a mass spectrometer to identify every chemical in samples vacuumed up from the surface,\n  * a neutron-activated gamma-ray spectrometer to assess the broad elemental composition of the surface Dragonfly is sitting on,\n  * a seismometer to measure Titan\u2019s quake activity and subsurface structures,\n  * meteorological and atmospheric sensors, and\n  * 10 cameras and two lidars to image geological features and provide imagery and altitude and ranging measurements for navigation.\n\nInsulating all these instruments is an ongoing issue. \u201cWe\u2019re still trading\nsome of the material choices, as we\u2019re in preliminary design,\u201d says Hibbard.\n\nTraditional spacecraft materials such as titanium, aluminum, aluminum\nhoneycomb and magnesium are in the frame for the structures. What looks\ncertain is that the entire lander body is to be coated in a 7-centimeter-thick\nlayer of an aerospace-grade insulating plastic foam, made from\npolymethacrylimide and known commercially as Rohacell, which gives renderings\nof the drone their distinctive coppery, tan color.\n\nThe aim of all the ongoing thermal design trades, says Hibbard, is to ensure\nDragonfly\u2019s interior remains in a range from minus 40 C to 30 C, and that its\nlithium-ion battery, in particular, is kept at its preferred temperature of\naround 20 C. \u201cSo most things inside will be somewhere between zero and 30\ndegrees Celsius,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd to ensure that the 11.5 kilowatt-hour battery pack is as reliable as\npossible \u2014 it will be trickle-charged by the MMRTG to power all Dragonfly\u2019s\nsystems \u2014 APL is building it using large, high-energy-density cells made by GS\nYuasa of Japan, whose li-ion batteries were deemed reliable enough to have\nbeen fitted spaceside on the International Space Station. With a trusted human\nspaceflight technology like that on the market, \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to invent new\ntechnology,\u201d says Hibbard.\n\n## Less bother in the hover\n\nWhere APL does need to innovate, however, is on the propulsion side, though\nthey are aided hugely by the munificence of Titan\u2019s physics. Thanks to the\nmoon\u2019s high atmospheric density and low gravity (again, 4.3 times more dense\nthan Earth\u2019s and one-seventh the gravity), the power needed to make a\nrotorcraft of a given mass hover on Titan is, astonishingly, only 2.5% of the\npower it would take to make the same aircraft hover on Earth. \u201cWhich is why\nTitan is such an ideal place to fly,\u201d says Hibbard.\n\nSo just how big should the rotors be? They would need to provide adequate\npower, but making the rotors longer than necessary would waste valuable mass\nand volume. So the engineers plugged in Titan\u2019s gravitational acceleration and\natmospheric density into their rotorcraft math, in which hovering power is\ninversely proportional to the square root of the total swept area of the rotor\ndisks. The APL team, knowing the volume of the 5-meter-diameter aeroshell\nDragonfly must fit in for its launch and cruise from Earth, could work out\nsome options. They did so for a quadcopter and an octocopter, and it turned\nout that rotors 1.35 meters long would do the optimum job.\n\nThey also chose the octocopter option. \u201cRedundancy, more than anything, really\ndrove us,\u201d says Hibbard. \u201cWith the octocopter, we can lose one rotor and still\nfly.\u201d\n\nOne reason Dragonfly might lose a rotor (or a motor) is the mysterious organic\nsand that the APL team suspects Titan\u2019s dunes are made of: If it\u2019s a hard\nparticulate, debris kicked up by the rotors on multiple landing and takeoff\ncycles could eventually damage the rotors, especially if embrittled by the\ncryogenic temperatures. So one option under consideration is to make the\nrotors from aluminum but with a tough titanium leading edge, says Hibbard.\nThat said, the team is also keeping an eye on NASA research into cryogenic-\ntemperature-tolerant composites \u2014 a welcome weight saving compared to a\ncomposite rotor.\n\nThe brushless DC motors that will drive those rotors are being custom made by\nMoog Inc. of New York. They are being dual wound, for redundancy, and are\n\u201cbeing designed specifically for Dragonfly to provide the necessary torque-to-\nmass ratio for our blades,\u201d says Hibbard.\n\nBut when Dragonfly lands to do surface science, its electric motors, stuck out\nin Titan\u2019s atmosphere on those outriggers, will need to be able to survive the\ncryogenic temperatures when they are switched off. To cope with this, Hibbard\nsays the motors will contain a specially designed lubricant that can freeze\nwithout causing internal damage. When it\u2019s flight time, mission controllers\nsimply activate heaters to warm the motor up to operational temperature so it\ncan fly to a new science site.\n\n> \u201cTitan has on its surface, or has had in its past on its surface, all of the\n> ingredients we know to be necessary for life.\u201d\n>\n> Elizabeth \"Zibi\" Turtle, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory\n\nWhen it gets there, a novel vacuum-based sampling system gets to work. Instead\nof the robot arms on a rover like Perseverance, Dragonfly will have rotary\npercussive drills to break up surface material on either side of its front\nskid support, alongside tubes to suck up the debris.\n\n\u201cBecause we have this great atmosphere on Titan, we can use pneumatic\ntransport,\u201d says Turtle. \u201cWe just vacuum up the material into the mass\nspectrometer.\u201d\n\nBut how do the engineers ensure that materials sucked up from one site do not\ncontaminate samples from other sites that Dragonfly flies to? After all, when\nseeking prebiotic chemicals \u2014 precursors to amino acids and perhaps proteins \u2014\nknowing where they were found will be vital.\n\nThe answer lies in some smart single-use technology in the mass spectrometer\nitself: \u201cThe pneumatic sample transfer system uses one-shot [sample] cups to\nminimize the site-to-site crosstalk,\u201d says Lorenz. \u201cWe can also run the\nblowers that suck the air through the system for an extended period before and\nafter a sampling operation to flush any material out of the pipes.\u201d\n\nAlongside the preliminary design review of every Dragonfly subsystem and\ninstrument \u2014 including the sampling system \u2014 APL has also begun test flights\nwith a half-scale octocopter in the physically (if not thermally and\natmospherically) similar landscape of California\u2019s Imperial Dunes, west of\nYuma, Arizona.\n\n\u201cThe scale model tests at Yuma are only for exercising the optical navigation\nsystem on representative terrain,\u201d says Lorenz. \u201cWhat have we learned? That\nthe system works well. A complication in the tests that we won\u2019t have on Titan\nwhere the illumination is very diffuse, is that the system can lock onto the\nlander shadow as a false \u2018fixed\u2019 feature in the navigation images.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear from talking to the Dragonfly engineers that they are a passionate,\nimaginative team. So with those wheels and robot arms being added to the new\nIngenuity-class helicopters for Mars Sample Return, is there any temptation to\nlet their imaginations fly and make late additions to Dragonfly\u2019s\ncapabilities?\n\nApparently not: Dragonfly\u2019s design includes everything its science objectives\ndemand and its New Frontiers budget can cope with, says Turtle.\n\n\u201cSo at this point, we are not looking to make additions to the payload.\nAlthough we can all of course think of other interesting experiments to do,\nthose will lead the way for future missions.\u201d\n\n## Related Topics\n\nSpace Science\n\n## About Paul Marks\n\nPaul is an award-winning journalist in London focused on technology,\ncybersecurity, aviation and spaceflight.
