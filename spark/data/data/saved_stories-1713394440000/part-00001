This is also true in other contexts but especially true\nin school. Thread is extensive, these are the highlights translated into my\nperspective. A lot of it is that a bully has experience and practice, they\nknow how to work the system, they know what will cause a response, and they\nare picking the time and place to do something. The victim has to respond in\nthe moment, and by responding causes conflict and trouble that no one wants.\nAlso we are far more willing to punish generally rule-following people who\nbreak a rule, than we are to keep punishing someone who keeps breaking the\nrules all time, where it seems pointless.\n\nStudy finds bullying has lifelong negative effects.\n\n> Abstract: Most studies examining the impact of bullying on wellbeing in\n> adulthood rely on retrospective measures of bullying and concentrate\n> primarily on psychological outcomes. Instead, we examine the effects of\n> bullying at ages 7 and 11, collected prospectively by the child's mother, on\n> subjective wellbeing, labour market prospects, and physical wellbeing over\n> the life-course.\n>\n> We exploit 12 sweeps of interview data through to age 62 for a cohort born\n> in a single week in Britain in 1958. Bullying negatively impacts subjective\n> well-being between ages 16 and 62 and raises the probability of mortality\n> before age 55. It also lowers the probability of having a job in adulthood.\n> These effects are independent of other adverse childhood experiences.\n\nMy worry, as usual, is that the controls are inadequate. Yes, there are some\nattempts here, but bullying is largely a function of how one responds to it,\nand one\u2019s social status within the school, in ways that outside base factors\nwill not account for properly.\n\nBullying sucks and should not be tolerated, but also bullies target \u2018losers\u2019\nin various senses, so them having worse overall outcomes is not obviously due\nto the bullying. Causation is both common and cuts both ways.\n\n####\n\nTruancy\n\nEver since Covid, schools have had to deal with lots of absenteeism and\ntruancy. What to do? Matt Yglesias gives the obviously correct answer. If the\nnorm is endangered, you must either give up the norm or enforce it. Should we\naccept high absentee rates from schools?\n\nWhat we should not do is accept a new norm of non-enforcement purely because\nwe are against enforcing rules. The pathological recent attachment to not\nenforcing rules needs to stop, across the board. The past version, however,\nhad quite the obsession with attendance, escalating quickly to \u2018threaten to\nruin your life\u2019 even if nothing was actually wrong. That does not make sense\neither.\n\nThen in college everyone thinks skipping class is mostly no big deal, except\nfor the few places they explicitly check and it is a huge deal. Weird.\n\nI think the correct solution is that attendance is insurance. If you attend\nmost of the classes and are non-disruptive, and are plausibly trying during\nthat time, then we cut you a lot of slack and make it very hard to fail. If\nyou do not attend most of the classes, then nothing bad happens to you\nautomatically, but you are doing that At Your Own Risk. We will no longer save\nyou if you do not pass the tests. If it is summer school for you, then so be\nit.\n\n####\n\nAgainst Active Shooter Drills\n\nNew York State is set to pass S6537, a long overdue bill summarized as\nfollows:\n\n> Decreases the frequency of lock-down drills in schools; directs that such\n> drills shall be implemented with a trauma-informed approach; permits parents\n> to opt their children out of such drills.\n\nReduced frequency, from the currently required four per year (seriously what\nin the world? An actual 2% chance each school day that you will simulate\ngetting shot at?) to one is a big win.\n\nSo is the opt out. I actively attempted to opt out when one of my sons was\nattending a public school and was told there was no legal way to do that. I\nhope most parents take that option once it is available, rendering the drills\npointless or at least mostly harmless.\n\nI also note that a \u2018trauma-informed approach\u2019 does seem better than a \u2018trauma-\nuninformed\u2019 approach, but also if you need a trauma-informed approach then\nthis strongly suggests that the \u2018trauma-informed\u2019 approach to active shooter\ndrills would be to... not have active shooter drills?\n\nSo yes, yay for a 75% reduction and opt out clause. Still 25% to go.\n\n####\n\nCensorship\n\nA study on what books are actually banned. A school library is much smaller\nthan the set of books, or the set of age-appropriate reasonable-to-stock\nbooks. So any given library will \u2018ban\u2019 most books. The important question is\nwhat kinds of books are more likely to be stocked, not whether efforts\nconspicuously remove certain books sometimes. If books advocating your\nworldview and perspectives end up in lots of libraries, and those advocating\nmine don\u2019t, then that is what matters.\n\nIf your controversial book is in 50% of school libraries but has been removed\nfrom 25% of them, and my controversial book was never in the libraries to\nbegin with, whose has been banned?\n\nThen again, if your book was not that interesting or popular, so we don\u2019t\ncare, that\u2019s not a ban either. And of course, if no one checks the book out\neither way, it did not matter if you stocked it.\n\nMostly I noticed, when reading about this, that I care mostly about whether\nthey stock good books, classic books, books I actively want people to read.\nAll this talk about recent books that seem highly ephemeral, who cares, what I\nwant to know is why only 75% of schools carried The Communist Manifesto, and\nbe sure that 100% have The Wealth of Nations.\n\n####\n\nWoke Kindergarden\n\nNo, seriously, that is not me or anyone else putting on a label.\n\nThe organization is literally named Woke Kindergarden.\n\n> Carl: Woke Kindergarten is a real organization that sells their services to\n> schools. Their mission is teach kids we can abolish work, landlords, Israel,\n> and borders! One Bay Area school paid them 250k and watched student scores\n> drop. Their \u201cwoke wonderings\u201d are sadly hilarious.\n>\n> Noah Smith: The craziest thing about \"Woke Kindergarten\" is that THAT IS\n> ACTUALLY ITS REAL OFFICIAL NAME.\n>\n> I never want to hear anyone complaining about the use of the term \"woke\"\n> again \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nNow, let\u2019s not be too hasty, that 250k was over three years. So only 83.3k per\nyear.\n\nIncluded are some of those \u2018wonderings\u2019 that the government paid to put on\nclassroom walls, the places children were forced to go on threat of violence:\n\nTo be fair, I do think that at least two of these are very good questions,\nalthough they seem a bit complicated and difficult for Kindergarten given I\nhave never seen a plausible answer for either of them.\n\nAnyone reading these signs knows what is going on here, but also: How many\nstudents can read these signs?\n\nHere is their website, which highlights gems like:\n\nAnd (these are directly from their website):\n\nThey follow this motto:\n\nDo you... feel... safe?\n\nMeanwhile, test scores fell even further, with less than 4% of students\nproficient in math and under 12% at grade level in English, both down 4% since\nthe program started.\n\n> San Francisco Chronicle: District officials defended the program this past\n> week, saying that Woke Kindergarten did what it was hired to do. The\n> district pointed to improvements in attendance and suspension rates, and\n> that the school was no longer on the state watch list, only to learn from\n> the Chronicle that the school was not only still on the list but also had\n> dropped to a lower level.\n\n####\n\nTracking\n\nMatthew Yglesias calls for improving student tracking. He points out some\nobvious things I doubt anyone reading this fails to understand, that different\nkids that are the same age need different lessons and if you don\u2019t do this\nmany kids will be lost or bored, neither of which leads to learning.\n\nHe also notes that a lot of this is framing. If you call it \u2018advanced\ncoursework\u2019 everyone realizes it is good but if you say the word \u2018tracking\u2019\npeople freak out. And that a lot of it is that there is a left-wing idea that\nstandardized tests are racist.\n\nHe says that without standardized tests you can\u2019t tell where to put different\nkids without risking huge bias. I think that is not true. There is a very\nsimple way to do this, which is to let families choose, if they can pass the\nmost recent test in the advanced class. If the kid is acing everything, you\nsuggest moving them up. If the kid is failing, you urge them to move down. If\nthey outright fail you force it. That is it.\n\nI do not think this addresses anyone\u2019s true objection, because I believe the\ntrue objection is that tracking is unequal. Those objecting for real, who\nactually don\u2019t like such proposals, disagree with my and I hope your position\nthat it is good when more children learn more things. What they care about is\nthat all the children learn the same things, and about certain particular\nthings they learn.\n\nAs in, they oppose eighth grade algebra because you did not bring enough\ncupcakes for the whole class, if everyone can\u2019t solve for x then x must remain\na mystery. Or, rather, that one child has a mild gluten allergy and can\u2019t eat\ncupcakes, so no one can ever have any cupcakes.\n\n####\n\nThe Case Against Education\n\nThere is the Bryan Caplan case against formal education, saying it fails to\neducate people and is mostly signaling, and there are better ways to learn. I\nlargely buy that.\n\nThen there is the case against education that says that kids learning things\nis bad.\n\nThere\u2019s the whole \u2018ban eighth grade algebra because if not all kids know math\nthen none of them should\u2019 idiocy, but oh, we can do so much better.\n\n> Omar Shams: never seen a case of brain worms this bad, now I understand why\n> SF banned algebra education for children.\n>\n> Emily Mills: Here\u2019s a slide deck from Mentava, a company Garry Tan is\n> invested in with his Network State bros where they claim they\u2019re gonna have\n> kids done with Algebra 2 in fourth grade. It\u2019s called Mentava and is selling\n> itself as cheaper than private school.\n>\n> And why do these folks want kids learning math so fast? They want their\n> labor and productivity to \u201caccelerate human achievement.\u201d\n>\n> These investors literally want the kids\u2019 labor. Here\u2019s a video with Amjad\n> Masad of Replit, who also invests in Mentava, speaking at the Network State\n> conference.\n>\n> Replit is *specifically* named in Bajali\u2019s scheme to create a \u201cparallel\n> education system.\u201d\n>\n> At the same conference, Balaji said: \u201cImagine a thousand startups, each\n> replacing a different legacy institution. They exist alongside the legacy in\n> parallel, gaining in strength, till eventually they pull away all the\n> users.\u201d To start a new country.\n\nI looked at the slide deck and this all looks awesome, actually. Devil of\ncourse is in the details, I will believe you can make iPad apps that work this\nwell when I see them in action. But surely we can agree that if this product\nwas good, and you could buy hypereffective education in short periods of time\nfor $5k/year, that would be great?\n\nI mean, they\u2019re only raising a few million. My first question was, are they\ntaking angel money? Not asking for a friend. Alas, it looks like I was far\nfrom alone, and now it was too late.\n\n> Niels Hoven (founder): How it started [see above] vs. How it's going.\n\nI do notice that he searched for \u2018stripe\u2019 and dates are not listed, so this\nmight not be all that impressive. Still, seems too late.\n\nAlso they are constantly getting more encouragement.\n\n> Steven Sinofsky: Seattle has long had a rivalry with SF. While SF just did\n> away with algebra, Seattle said hold my beer.\n>\n> Rachel Bowman: Seattle closes gifted and talented schools because they had\n> too many white and Asian students, with consultants branding black parents\n> who complained about the move \u2018tokenized.\u2019\n\nSeattle has ended all of its gifted and talented programs. If you complain\nthat making everyone worse off is bad, actually, then they call you names.\n\n####\n\nHome Schooling\n\nThis chart was very surprising to me.\n\n> Rosey: Did not realize home schooling was up this much, gonna have a lot\n> more weirdos in the future.\n\nWhat surprises me is how much the additional home schooling has stuck so far.\n\nI would have expected a huge peak in 2020-22, to roughly this level, with the\npandemic making schools a different level of dystopian nightmare than usual,\nthen most people throwing in the towel. That was what we did.\n\nInstead it looks like 80% of the increase stuck around for 2022-23. It seems\nthis was a case of there being a lot of startup costs and network effects.\nOnce you learn how to homeschool and you try it, most people decided to keep\ngoing and the change was sustainable.\n\nThis is a strong endorsement of home school by the families that tried it.\n\n####\n\nDespair\n\nMany kids despair for our world, and not because of AGI.\n\n> Conor Sen: Most parents of young kids are looking at this chart and thinking\n> \u201cHow do I keep my kid from tracking that?\u201d\n\nYes, it does seem like girls outshine boys in essentially all media now, and\nthere are tons of pro-girl messages but almost no pro-boy messages or good boy\nrole models. And girls seem to be crushing boys in school more every year, as\nyou would expect given how schools increasingly work. One commentator notes\nthat Bluey (a fantastic show all around, it is odd how literal everyone agrees\non this, myself included) is fully neutral, and that even this is remarkable.\n\nHere are some thoughts on graphs like this one:\n\n> Matt Grossmann: Depression & anxiety have been increasing, especially among\n> young girls; increasing social media & smartphone use are likely an\n> important factor.\n>\n> Matt Blackwell: Seems like increases in schizophrenia might provide some\n> decent negative control for the effect of smartphones on mental health\n> outcomes. That is, I doubt phones cause schizophrenia, so maybe there are\n> other (time-varying) confounders for all the mental health outcomes.\n>\n> As Matt points out down thread, increases in reporting and decreases in\n> stigma are hard to rule out as confounders.\n\nI totally buy reporting and stigma as confounders. We definitely need to\ncorrect for those. The 67% increase in schizophrenia seems like it shouldn\u2019t\nobviously be smartphone related, and could be a proxy for measurement\nadjustments, as could the 57% for bipolar. Then you need to explain how all\nthis isn\u2019t causing much ADHD, which is only up 72%, but seems like something\nphones would make much worse and also something with a big diagnosis and\nstigma shift.\n\nAnd all that still leaves way too much depression and anxiety.\n\n####\n\nGoals\n\nWhat should they be?\n\n> snav: I remember seeing a 100 year old ad for a university targeted at\n> parents, where the selling point was that a humanities education would\n> prepare your child for taking over executive leadership of your business.\n>\n> I feel like whatever change in humanities education people have been\n> decrying for a while is directly, fiscally downstream of university\n> education no longer being for the purpose of training business executives. a\n> well rounded sensitivity to the human condition isn't relevant.\n>\n> Harold Lee: Remarkable how much \"what you want for your kids\" has changed\n> among wealthy parents.\n>\n> I went to school with some pretty rich kids and they had the same anxieties\n> and strove for the same McKinsey/tech/academia careers as the rest of us.\n> Starting over from square one.\n\nAiming for McKinsey is of course a tragedy, although they pay well. Academic\njobs are mostly a trap and I am sad my parents did not warn me, although I got\naway clean before any major damage. If you are rich, the pay cut and rough\nmarket might not matter so much, since failure is an option. Tech jobs are\nfine modulo AI concerns.\n\nNone of them seem anywhere near \u2018take over the family business\u2019 if that is an\noption for you. That seems great. Nor do they hold a candle to \u2018start your own\nbusiness\u2019 if you have what it takes to do that, and having the funding is a\ngreat start.\n\nWhy would you want a \u2018normal job\u2019 if you are very rich? The whole point of\nsuch jobs is risk aversion and paying the bills.\n\nObvious exception if you have a real passion. Some people really, really want\nto do academic work, or be a doctor or a teacher or what not. If so, go ahead,\nand plan for that. But if you are rich and your kid is spending their\nchildhood working towards a generic job they have no passion for, I feel like\nyou messed up.\n\n####\n\nTaking the Developing World to School\n\nIs our children learning? In developing nations, they got 5.4 years of\nschooling in 2000, versus 1.6 years in 1960. But schooling is not learning or\neducation. The time spent in school is a cost, which one must not confuse with\nwhat one would hope to be the intended benefit. Lauren Gilbert asks in\nAsterisk, are we getting the benefit, and was it even the goal?\n\nBasic components of such production are frequently absent. And by basic\ncomponents, I mean the teachers and students.\n\n> Consider perhaps the most basic measure of a functioning school: that there\n> are teachers in the school teaching classes. On any given day, nearly a\n> quarter of teachers in rural India simply do not show up. And when they do\n> turn up, they\u2019re often not teaching. A World Bank report found that even\n> when Kenyan teachers were present, they were absent from their classrooms\n> 42% of the time.\n>\n> Students, too, are regularly absent. In Kenya, one in ten students skips\n> school on any given day; in India, it\u2019s one in three; in Mozambique, it\u2019s\n> over half. And there\u2019s a very real chance these numbers are underestimates;\n> students and parents claim that they show up^2 more often than unannounced\n> spot checks would suggest.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> For instance, in Rwanda, English is the official language of instruction\n> across all grade levels. Yet just 38% of teachers have a working command of\n> the language, and so Rwandan schools end up as a comedy of errors. Teachers\n> who don\u2019t speak English attempt to teach children who also don\u2019t speak\n> English in English, out of English language textbooks.\n\nThe limited budgets cause a host of other problems as well. The results are\nwhat you would expect.\n\n> Somewhere between 70-80% of children in primary school in a low-income\n> country cannot read a simple story. More than half will still be unable to\n> read by age 10.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Up to 70% of rural Indian third graders cannot subtract, and 70% of fifth\n> graders cannot do division.\n\nBut then, were reading, writing and arithmetic ever the point?\n\nI am going to quote this passage at length, because people keep (fnord) not\nseeing it:\n\n> Policymakers in developing countries tend to believe the primary purpose of\n> schooling is none of these. Instead of focusing on either economic returns\n> or personal development, they would prefer schools to create dutiful\n> citizens.\n>\n> In a discrete choice experiment in which bureaucrats in education^7 were\n> asked to make trade-offs between foundational literacy, completion of\n> secondary school, and formation of dutiful citizens, respondents valued\n> dutiful citizens 50% more than literate ones.^8 For many policy makers, the\n> goal is not the production of knowledge, but the fostering of nationalism.\n>\n> This may sound like an odd set of priorities, but both European and Latin\n> American countries had similar priorities when they expanded their education\n> systems to serve more than a small elite around the turn of the 20th\n> century. The goal was not to produce scientists or entrepreneurs but to\n> inculcate a reliable workforce that would support the state.\n>\n> In 1899, the U.S. commissioner of education, William T. Harris, said exactly\n> this. He wished U.S. schools had the \"appearance of a machine,\" one where\n> the goal was to teach students \u201cto behave in an orderly manner, to stay in\n> his own place, and not get in the way of others.\" At that time, emphasis was\n> considerably more on the \u201cdutiful\u201d part of \u201cdutiful citizens.\u201d\n>\n> Developing--country schools are trying to achieve much the same ends.\n> Students learn to memorize, to obey, and to not question \u2014 but they do not\n> particularly learn to read or write.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> The same study suggests that policymakers\u2019 second priority is to shepherd\n> pupils through secondary school. This, too, they are making progress on.\n\nThe first goal of such school is obedience. The second goal of such school is\nmore school. The third goal is literacy.\n\nIt is odd that even the author steps back from the obvious implications.\n\n> In the developed world, it almost goes without saying that you go to school\n> in order to learn academic skills. These skills \u2014 referred to as \u201ccognitive\n> skills\u201d in the academic literature \u2014 are a major determinant of what you\n> earn as an adult. The more you learn, the more you earn.\n\nThis very much does not go without saying. Or rather, it does, except that is\na bad thing, because the statement is false. Yes, cognitive skills are\nrewarded in the job market, but that is entirely compatible with school being\nabout other things.\n\nIf you did want to teach students to read and write, there are known highly\neffective techniques to do that, that work at scale, relative to current\nefforts of going through fixed motions:\n\n> Targeting lessons to what students know \u2014 rather than what their official\n> grade level is \u2014 is considerably more effective. This has been shown to be\n> successful at scale in India. In one case, students learned as much in a\n> 10-day Teaching at the Right Level \u201clearning camp\u201d as they would have in\n> four years of \u201cregular school.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if you teach students what they do not already know and also\nare ready to learn, you get two orders of magnitude more learning. I am not\nsympathetic to this being \u2018hard to implement.\u2019\n\nIf you actually cared, you could - for example - implement this by sending all\nthe students home 75% of the time so you could have the resources to do this\nduring the other 25%, and have them spend the 75% of the time reading books\nand using ChatGPT. Or 90%.\n\n> An American who is one standard deviation above average at math will make\n> 28% more over their lifetime, but the labor market for a math whiz in rural\n> Kenya is quite different from the one faced by a New York City math genius.\n\nIf that statistic is accurate, and they are indeed controlling for literacy,\nthen it seems odd to claim that intelligence has only a modest impact on\nearnings. Seems like the actual thing is valued quite a bit. As the author\nnotes here, we cannot assume this kind of value will transfer to developing\ncountries, but I am going to go ahead and say math and literacy have very high\npractical utility in almost every context, and are super valuable economically\nwithin the ranges considered here. That does not rule out soft skills as also\nvaluable.\n\nI will leave this here:\n\n> Courtney Meyerhofer: Kids are insatiably curious...\n>\n> Yet many dread going to school.\n>\n> It's not the kids that are broken.\n\n####\n\nPrimary School\n\nIt seems our children are not learning, in many places.\n\n> Marina Medvin: Not a single student can do math at grade level in 53\n> Illinois schools. As state spending per student goes up in Illinois, student\n> performance goes down. Why is that? Most of the problematic schools are in\n> Chicago.\n\nIf schools commonly have literal zero students at \u2018grade level\u2019 in math, and\nwe continue to give them increasingly large amounts of money per pupil to not\nteach those students, one can only conclude that our schools, too, are not\nabout learning.\n\nIn what is remarkably good news considering everything, San Francisco is\npaying millions of dollars to \u2018pilot\u2019 the return of 8th grade algebra,\nincluding $300k for \u2018pilot data collection and analysis.\u2019 This should of\ncourse cost $0, go back to what you did before, but is also worth the price.\n\nAnother more straightforward place our children are not learning, according to\nthe Barbara Bush Foundation: 130 million adults in the USA, 54% of the\npopulation, lack proficiency in literacy, meaning sixth grade level reading\nskills.\n\nBy contrast, The National Center for Education Statistics in 2019 estimated\nonly 43 million adults possess \u2018low literacy skills,\u2019 but even in that much\nbetter case, that\u2019s still 21% of the population.\n\nSo while this is still a vast, vast improvement over historical literacy rates\nwhen you take the sufficiently long view, it is not exactly what you love to\nsee.\n\n####\n\nGuessing the Teacher\u2019s Password\n\nI absolutely plan on talking this way increasingly over time, because it is\ntrue. Indeed, I eagerly await the day I can teach my children such lessons.\nThey are not yet ready.\n\n> Patrick McKenzie: It occurs to me that I have explicitly explained to my\n> children that teachers respond well to guessing their password and that a\n> rule of the game is you aren\u2019t supposed to explicitly say that is what you\n> are doing.\n>\n> \u201cRemember this is just game, not all games have the same rules.\u201d\n\nThe sooner they learn that school is not real, the better.\n\n####\n\nCorrecting the Teacher\u2019s Incentives\n\nWisconsin passed Act 10, discontinuing teachers\u2019 collective bargaining over\nsalary schedules, allowing institution of flexible pay schedules. What\nhappened next was what you would expect.\n\n> Compensation of most US public school teachers is rigid and solely based on\n> seniority. This paper studies the effects of a reform that gave school\n> districts in Wisconsin full autonomy to redesign teacher pay schemes.\n> Following the reform some districts switched to flexible compensation.\n>\n> Using the expiration of preexisting collective bargaining agreements as a\n> source of exogenous variation in the timing of changes in pay, I show that\n> the introduction of flexible pay raised salaries of high-quality teachers,\n> increased teacher quality (due to the arrival of high-quality teachers from\n> other districts and increased effort), and improved student achievement.\n\nIf increased teacher quality was due to transfer from other districts, then\nthat part of the change does not leave students overall better off. The\nstudents are however better off if better teachers enter, and worse teachers\nexit, and teachers increase in quality in response to the incentives, which\nwill also happen.\n\nThe most interesting part of this is that many districts, freed from\ncollective bargaining, used that freedom to raise rather than lower teacher\npay. So what was previously being collectively bargained for was a regime with\nlower overall salaries, and the union had to be busted to raise wages.\n\n####\n\nMathematics\n\nI\u2019ve heard this point before but this was unusually well put.\n\n> Cirkelnio: It's depressing how much mainstream math education is actively\n> misleading about what \"math\" even means... imagine going to music class for\n> 6 years and it's exclusively about memorizing \"twinkle twinkle little star\"\n> in perfect detail. like ofc you'd grow up thinking music sucks\n>\n> Math is also stuff like the tarski undefinability theorem which says that if\n> you have a set of rules describing an object, you can't know which object\n> you're actually describing \u2013 there's no way to answer arbitrary yes/no\n> questions about that object a priori. Isn't that a trip.\n>\n> maybe the \"twinkle twinkle\" metaphor is a bit strained but I hope you see\n> how frustrating I find it for a subject which I'd describe as \"the\n> generalized study of patterns in reasoning\" be reduced to memorizing\n> multiplication tables...\n\nIdeally you can find patterns while incidentally getting the memorization done\nin the background, you do it because it is obviously the thing to do. At some\npoint for everyone that stops working, and then everything goes to hell.\n\n####\n\nLet Kids Be Kids\n\nGood news:\n\n> Etienne: this is strangely heartwarming: the canadian pediatrics association\n> now recommends that children engage in risky play\u2014\"thrilling and exciting\n> forms of free play that involve uncertainty of outcome and a possibility of\n> physical injury\"\u2014because of benefits e.g. to mental health\n\nI strongly endorse. You of course want guardrails against disaster, but you\ncan have vastly better such guardrails than anyone in the past ever dreamed\nabout while still getting most of the benefits here, because cell phones, if\nonly you could be confident others wouldn\u2019t call the cops. The extent to which\nthe risk is \u2018load bearing\u2019 and needs to stay, versus it being hard to avoid\nbut not inherently valuable, varies.\n\nOr we could keep doing things like this:\n\n> Lenore Skenazy: Child development much?\n>\n> A \"top\" school in NC enforces silent lunch because admins \"found that 15\n> minutes was not enough time to eat if the children were allowed to talk.\"\n>\n> Less talking = more instruction time! Better test scores! All that matters!\n\n####\n\nMandatory Work We Encourage\n\nWhat is the net impact of \u2018enrichment activities\u2019 that we enable or often\nforce children to do, including homework? New paper says Not Great, Bob:\n\n> Using time diary data from the Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the\n> Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find that the net effect of\n> enrichment on cognitive skills is small and indistinguishable from zero and\n> that the net effect of enrichment on non-cognitive skills is quite negative\n> and significant. This negative effect on non-cognitive skills is\n> concentrated in high school, which is when enrichment activities become more\n> oriented around homework and less oriented around social activities.\n\nThere are obviously many different such \u2018enrichment activities,\u2019 with the\npaper examining the overall practical average. No doubt some of them are net\npositive, others are net negative. It also matters what other activities are\nbeing displaced. These results still clearly suggest we overschedule and\noverburden children in general.\n\nMy presumption is that homework is a highly below-average \u2018enrichment\u2019\nactivity.\n\nI would also guess that activities kids actively want to do are overall net\npositive.\n\nI would also add that this result is entirely consistent with the system\npushing children towards more such activities. The activities have other\npurposes, most importantly signaling to aid in college applications and to\nhave everyone feel they are accomplishing something and being responsible. Who\nthought homework was about learning?\n\n####\n\nMandatory Work We Discourage\n\nOn the flip side, I strongly endorse that it is good for children to be able\nto do modest amounts of real work. It is good to learn what that is like and\nwhat is expected of workers, screw up when the price of doing so is still low,\ndevelop responsibility and good habits and earn some cash.\n\n> Elizabeth Nolan Brown: I started babysitting for pay at age 11, got my first\n> non-babysitting job\u2014food service at the community pool (so many microwave\n> pizzas!)\u2014 at age 14. I really hope experiences like these aren't going\n> extinct because of our ongoing, excessive infantilization of adolescents.\n>\n> Suderman: I started working summers and after school at age 13, via a\n> parent-run community yard work service. Got my first real paycheck job at a\n> hotel pool at 15. Waited tables at a crazy Florida tourist trap for many\n> summers. Crappy paid work taught me more than most classes.\n\nThere is of course a limit where it turns abusive and quite bad, but the\ncorrect amount of economically useful labor for a child to do is very\nobviously not zero. The craziest of course is babysitting, where not only do\nwe let an 11-year-old babysit, we actively require a babysitter for them in\nturn. Which, in most cases, is nuts.\n\n####\n\nAir Quality Matters\n\nPaper finds that spending more on basic school infrastructure like HVACs and\nremoving pollutants raises test scores but not home prices, whereas spending\non things like athletic facilities raises home prices but not test scores.\nThus, house prices are responding to the impression of the school, not to the\nquality of the education, on the margin, counting on the correlation to make\nthat reasonable. This implies that, if you are paying close attention, you can\ndo arbitrage.\n\nThis also emphasizes the importance of pollution and clean air. If HVACs are\ngreat investments for schools, investing in good air filters at home should\nhave great returns as well.\n\n####\n\nSchool Choice\n\nIf you want to argue against school choice then at minimum you need to ensure\nall the schools meet the minimum standard of \u2018a child who goes here might\nlearn something.\u2019\n\nWayne: This is my local high school. Here\u2019s the thing progressives need to\nunderstand: you literally couldn\u2019t pay me to send my kids to this school. It\u2019s\nnot going to happen, so just shut up about it. They are not going there.\n\nThere is literally no value in criticizing charter schools or private schools\nor homeschooling or anything else so long as fewer than 1% of the students at\nmy local high school are proficient in math. My kids just simply will not\nattend school with peers who are that far behind.\n\n> Notorious S.E.B.: I don't like charter schools, but there is a massive blind\n> spot on the left about the apocalyptic state of public education in most\n> cities. It goes almost completely un-talked about, progressives and liberals\n> put forth no solutions\n>\n> the reason the unholy alliance between conservatives who ideologically hate\n> public schools and usually black urban liberals on this issue is that the\n> situation is so, so bad, and the left is not putting forth any solution, or\n> even really talking about the problem.\n\nI do not know how to fix such public schools. What I do know is \u2018support our\nteachers and schools and give them more funding\u2019 is not going to be\nsufficient. They are starved for funds in practice, but it seems there are\nsystems that will eat any budget increase without benefiting students, and\neven if not money would only go so far. And we have had a lot of time to fix\nsuch situations using such solutions, without much success.\n\nYou also are not going to fix the problem by pretending it doesn\u2019t exist:\n\n> Brennan Colberg: Here's mine. Yeah, I'll do it myself instead, thank you\n> very much.\n>\n> The punchline? two members of the school board responsible for these\n> incredible numbers are running for the OR legislature on their strength (as\n> the 91% graduation rate was only 89% six years ago!). One proclaims that he\n> \"knows our leaders must be accountable for outcomes.\" Hmmmm\n\nIf you do not have reading and mathematics \u2018proficiency\u2019 you should not\ngraduate until such time as you do. Period. The threat of choice and\ncompetition seems like the only reasonable option, if things reach this level.\n\nAlabama funds students instead of systems, becoming the 11th state with\nuniversal school choice.\n\n####\n\nFull Access to Smartphones Is Not Good For Children\n\nThis was the main topic of a recent CWT with Jonathan Haidt, which I cover\nhere. I covered Tyler\u2019s additional thoughts with the section Antisocial Media\nin AI #59, along with additional thoughts from Matt Yglesias and Sean Patrick\nHughes.\n\nWe also have Jean Twenge writing that Smartphones are Damaging Our Kids.\n\n> Jean Twenge (National Review): Imagine that a company began mass-producing a\n> new toy. This was not a toy for little kids; instead, it appealed most to\n> adolescents. The toy became wildly popular, first with teens and eventually\n> with younger children as well. The toy was so engaging that some teens\n> stayed up until 2 a.m. just to play with it. Before long, teens spent so\n> much time using the toy that they cut back on socializing in person.\n>\n> This is not a fictional story. The toy is the smartphone, and this is the\n> story of teens\u2019 lives beginning around 2012.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> By 2023, U.S. teens were spending an average of nearly five hours a day\n> using social media, according to Gallup.\n\nThat certainly does not sound like teens now have a handle on social media\nuse.\n\nOne should remember these graphs (note the y-axes do not start at 0):\n\nThat is an additional 15% of kids not sleeping seven hours, and a 25%+ drop in\nsocializing that mostly pre-dates the pandemic.\n\nI would also note the dramatically difference between socializing in 10th\ngrade versus 12th grade, which I was not previously aware of. Wow.\n\nThe piece presents the case well, but is also long and mostly duplicative of\nprevious discussions. So if you\u2019ve been following the whole time, you can\nsafely skip it.\n\nI did notice this at the end:\n\n> Last year, leaked internal documents revealed that Meta valued each teen\n> user at $270 of \u201clifetime value.\u201d Is it really necessary to argue that our\n> children\u2019s mental health is worth more than that?\n\nThat is obviously way smaller in magnitude than the lifetime value of being a\ncustomer of Meta. There is a 99%+ chance that either you should pay $1,000 for\nlifetime access to Meta, or you should pay $1,000 to have a lifetime without\n(at least full) access to an account with Meta. Meta has a remarkably poor\nability to profit from the endless hours you spend with their apps.\n\nAt Vox, Eric Levitz offers a contrasting perspective, seeing the evidence as\nmixed.\n\n> Eric Levitz: In truth, it\u2019s not entirely clear that there even is an\n> international decline in teen mental health that requires explanation.\n\nThat\u2019s a bold strategy. The case is laid out in the first section of the case\nagainst the case. Essentially, the counterargument is that suicide rates are\nhigher among American adults as well, whereas suicide rates of teens elsewhere\nare not rising, and everything else is potentially \u2018diagnostic inflation.\u2019\n\n> Data on hospital visits for self-harm, suicidal ideation, and mental health\n> problems are vulnerable to similar distortions, University of Oxford\n> psychologist Andrew Przybylski told Vox.\n>\n> This is because hospital systems\u2019 recordkeeping protocols can change over\n> time. In 2015, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) \u2014 a World\n> Health Organization guide that instructs hospitals how to code diagnoses in\n> official records \u2014 implemented a new edition, which recommended multiple\n> major changes to coding practices.\n\nIf this is purely because there was a step change in recordkeeping protocols,\nthen we can correct for that. Otherwise, this seems mostly like it should be\nreal.\n\nThis is distinct from the question of whether suicide rates in teens are up\nbecause suicide rates are up for everyone, which of course does not make the\nteen situation better. Also here is a graph?\n\nIt seems highly disingenuous to look at this graph and say young people in\nAmerica do not have a suicide problem? I notice I am confused by this claim?\n\nThe second counterargument is that social media use only explains 15 percent\nof variation in mental health issues. Wait, \u2018only\u2019? Especially when part of\nthe effect is network effects and overall changes? What exactly were we\nexpecting? Obviously there are also many other things going on that impact\none\u2019s mental health. I don\u2019t get why this is a counterargument.\n\nThe third counterargument is to argue against Haidt\u2019s specific experimental\nevidence, and perhaps they are right that it was weak, but I wasn\u2019t relying on\nthis particular evidence at all and had forgotten it existed.\n\nThe fourth counterargument is that Haidt\u2019s natural experiments are\ncontradicted by better data. They claim that changes in broadband\nsubscriptions in areas in 202 countries over 19 years did not predict teen\nmental health outcomes. I agree that is some evidence.\n\nThen the section concludes with a classic Law of No Evidence invocation.\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that isn\u2019t present in any of the past panics about\n> video games, Dungeons & Dragons, or silent movies,\u201d Przybylski told Vox.\n> \u201cEach of these, you have a new technology, a vulnerable group and a new\n> mechanism. It\u2019s always \u2018This time it\u2019s different,\u2019 but there\u2019s nothing in\n> these claims that actually distinguishes it in terms of scientific\n> evidence.\u201d\n\nI roll my eyes at statements like that. If you cannot differentiate this from\nDungeons & Dragons panic, which was only played by a few million kids,\ntypically for only a few hours a week, was a niche business and involved\nspending time with other kids in person doing play? If you can only look at\ndata that has been properly filed and analyzed into the proper scientific\nformat, and do not think what has been presented counts?\n\nSimilarly for silent movies, the average child saw between one and two movies\na week. This is simply not that much time compared to social media.\n\nWhereas for television, by 1961 the average child ages 3-12 was watching 21\nhours a week. And to those who say that turned out fine and was a false alarm,\nI would ask: Did it? Was it? I am not at all convinced. I think the alarm case\nthere as basically correct, we simply paid the price, and the price was high\nbut not existential.\n\nFor video games, I think that if children had typically spent hours a day on\nthem, a moral panic would have been highly reasonable. And indeed, if your\nchild spent five hours a day playing video games, then depending on\ncircumstances you might want to panic a little. It might be fine but it is a\nrather large effect on their life and development. Whereas at the height of\nthe panic over video games, typical use was about half an hour a day. There\nwas also a panic over the violence, which was misplaced, but that seems like a\nclearly distinct case and that is not hindsight talking, I was very much alive\nand of that opinion at the time.\n\nI do think \u2018evaluate only the strictly peer-reviewed evidence-backed claims\nand see whose stack up\u2019 is a useful thing to do, and perhaps the conclusion\nreached here that this in particular is mixed is reasonable. I just don\u2019t\nthink that is the right way to do Bayesian evidence and decide what to\nbelieve. Indeed, the final section is called \u2018I still suspect phones are bad,\u2019\nof course if evidence is inconclusive that suggests \u2018suspecting\u2019 it anyway.\nAnd indeed, the reasoning in this final section is very simple common sense.\n\nCould this turn out to mostly be one big moral panic in the end? I suppose\nthis is possible. But at minimum, I believe it is a justified panic, based on\nwhat we know at the time. If there was a new thing invented, and within a\ndecade young people were spending hours a day on it, and you did not have\nserious concerns about that, this seems like your mistake even if you happen\nto be right?\n\n####\n\nLifetime Learning\n\nAndrej Karpathy warns against \u2018learn this in 10 minutes\u2019 videos, advises\ngetting your entertainment and education separately and deciding which one you\nwant now. For education, he says, allocate four hour windows. Dive into\ntextbooks.\n\n> Ethan Mollick: Classes that actively involved students upped test scores in\n> a Harvard class by 33%... but students thought they were learning more from\n> non-active lectures.\n>\n> The paradox; being challenged results in learning, but it also shows us how\n> little we know, which makes us feel ignorant.\n\nThat is one theory. My theory has always been that \u2018active learning\u2019 is\ntypically obnoxious and terrible as implemented in classrooms, especially\n\u2018group work,\u2019 and students therefore hate it. Lectures are also obnoxious and\nterrible as implemented in classrooms, but in a passive way that lets students\ndodge when desired. Also that a lot of this effect probably isn\u2019t real,\nbecause null hypothesis watch.\n\n### Subscribe to Don't Worry About the Vase\n\nBy Zvi Mowshowitz \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nA world made of gears.
