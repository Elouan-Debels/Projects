Now, we are creating a new class of uncrewed underwater\nvehicles (UUV) with Manta Ray. Taking its name from the massive \u201cwinged\u201d fish,\nManta Ray will operate long-duration, long-range missions in ocean\nenvironments where humans can\u2019t go.\n\n## Advancing UUV Technology\n\nWe developed our unique full-scale demonstration vehicle using several novel\ndesign attributes that support the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s\n(DARPA\u2019s) vision of providing ground-breaking technology to create strategic\nsurprise. Manta Ray is:\n\n  * Payload-capable to support a variety of missions\n  * Autonomous, without the need for on-site human logistics\n  * Energy-saving, with the ability to anchor to the seafloor and hibernate in a low-power state\n  * Modular, for easy shipment in five standard shipping containers to support expeditionary deployment and in-field assembly world-wide\n\n## A Leader in Uncrewed Systems\n\nFrom unmanned aerial vehicles and underwater mine hunting systems to defense\nreadiness targets, Northrop Grumman is a leader in autonomous systems,\nartificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nLearn More > Autonomous SystemsLearn More > Artificial Intelligence and\nMachine Learning\n\n## In the News\n\n### Northrop Grumman Completes Assembly of Manta Ray Uncrewed Underwater\nVehicle\n\nLearn More\n\n### Engineering Imitating Life\n\nLearn More\n\n### DARPA Selects Performers to Build, Test Manta Ray Unmanned Underwater\nVehicles\n\nLearn More\n\n## Contact Us\n\nMariah Pulver mariah.pulver@ngc.com\n\nRequest More Information\n\n## Stay Connected\n\n  * Facebook - Northrop Grumman\n  * Instagram - @NorthropGrumman\n  * LinkedIn - Northrop Grumman Corporation\n  * Twitter - @NGCNews | @NorthropGrumman\n  * Youtube - Northrop Grumman Media\n  * Threads - Northropgrumman\n\n## Stories\n\n  * ### A Riveting History\n\nLearn More\n\n  * ### From Blackboard to Blueprint\n\nLearn More\n\n  * ### Fifty Years at the Rocket Ranch: Q&A with Ranch Manager Boyd\n\nLearn More\n\n## Navigation\n\n  * Home\n  * Who We Are\n  * What We Do\n  * Careers\n  * Investors\n  * Sustainability\n  * Suppliers\n  * News\n\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Manage Cookie Preferences\n  * Terms of Use\n  * EEO\n  * Corporate Governance\n  * Workplace Accommodations\n  * E-Verify\n  * Suppliers\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Northrop Grumman.
