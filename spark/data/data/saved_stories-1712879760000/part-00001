Sometimes\nthey\u2019re successful, and sometimes they immediately get caught. A bit over a\nweek ago, someone tried to sneak onto a Delta flight, using a method I\u2019ve\nnever heard of. And he almost got away with it, except for one little\nproblem...\n\nI first wrote about this last week, but wanted to provide an update, as\nthere\u2019s now video footage of this guy\u2019s ploy, and it\u2019s quite interesting to\nsee.\n\nIn this post:\n\n## How someone snuck onto a Delta flight from Salt Lake City\n\nThe FBI is investigating a 26-year-old who managed to sneak onto a Delta\nflight from Salt Lake City (SLC) to Austin (AUS) on Sunday, March 17, 2024.\n\nThe man reportedly intended to fly with Southwest to Austin. He had a \u201cbuddy\npass,\u201d which was presumably given to him by a Southwest employee, to be able\nto fly with the airline on a space available basis. So he cleared security\nwith that standby pass, though unfortunately the Southwest flight was full,\nmeaning he wouldn\u2019t be able to take the flight.\n\nDesperate to get to Austin, the man then used a different strategy. He went to\nthe gate for the Delta flight to Austin, and used his phone to take pictures\nof the boarding passes of other passengers without their knowledge. No one\nnoticed this at the time, but rather this was only uncovered using security\ncamera footage after the fact.\n\nHe then boarded the aircraft using the barcode on another passenger\u2019s boarding\npass. Now, he did sort of think this through \u2014 he didn\u2019t simply take the seat\nassociated with that boarding pass, since he knew it would be occupied.\nInstead, he boarded and then tried to hide in the lavatory. The goal was to\nlet everyone else board, and then take whatever empty seat was left.\n\nThe problem is, there were no empty seats on the flight. So when he emerged\nfrom the lavatory and the plane began taxiing, flight attendants realized\nsomething was wrong, and the plane returned to the gate. The aircraft was met\nby police, where the traveler \u201cadmitted he had made a mistake and was only\ntrying get home.\u201d Police say the man is being held on a federal detainer at\nthe Salt Lake County Metro Jail. The flight ended up departing around 30\nminutes late.\n\nBelow is a video clip from Good Morning America, showing video footage from\ninside the terminal. You can see how the man chats up people near him, takes\npictures of their boarding passes, and then boards the plane.\n\n## The guy deserves credit for creativity\n\nLet me start by saying that of course you shouldn\u2019t try to sneak onto a plane.\nNot only because it\u2019s unethical, but because the risk is high, and the reward\nis low.\n\nEvery so often we see stories of people trying to sneak onto planes. In some\ncases it\u2019s because they genuinely have a reason that they want to go to a\ncertain destination and either can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to pay for a flight, while\nin other cases it seems to be a game, or mental illness, or both.\n\nI have to at least give this guy credit for sort of thinking this through, and\nsneaking onto a plane as well as one possibly could:\n\n  * A barcode for an eligible ticket is all that it takes to get onto a domestic flight in the United States, as IDs aren\u2019t generally checked at the gate (but rather only when you check-in and when you go through security)\n  * He made sure that he boarded before the the passenger who had the boarding pass information that he stole; when the other passenger tried to board, the system suggested that this passenger had already boarded, though the gate agent assumed it was a glitch, so allowed that person to board\n  * He was smart for going to the lavatory until boarding was complete, and then hoping to snag whatever seat was empty\n  * He was also of course brilliant for sneaking onto a Delta flight; who wouldn\u2019t want to fly with the airline that gets a revenue premium for its excellence, and which has Airbus A350-1000s on order \ud83d\ude09\n\nThis plan would have likely worked if it weren\u2019t for every single seat on the\naircraft being occupied. So if you are going to sneak onto a plane, this is\nabout as good of a job as one could do. I think his one mistake was not\nchecking the seat map prior to following through with this scheme. When he\nfound out the flight was at capacity, that would\u2019ve certainly been a clue.\n\nI\u2019m also curious how premeditated all of this was, or if he has done it\nbefore. He seems to have had a legitimate buddy pass, so he had a real way of\ngetting through security. Did he just come up with this scheme on the spot, or\nhad he thought through the logistics in advance?\n\nThis might have worked if the flight weren\u2019t full\n\n## Bottom line\n\nA man tried to sneak onto a Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Austin. He had\na buddy pass for Southwest, but that flight was full, so he needed to find a\nnew way to travel. So he went to the gate area for a Delta flight, took a\npicture of someone else\u2019s boarding pass, and then boarded with that.\n\nOnce onboard, he headed to the lavatory, where he stayed until boarding was\ncomplete. His plan was to take any open seat, though the issue is that the\nflight was at capacity. Police then met the flight, and the man was arrested.\n\nWhat do you make of this Delta stowaway scheme?\n\nAir Peace Plans Nigeria To United States Flights\n\nRead More\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nConversations (45)\n\nThe comments on this page have not been provided, reviewed, approved or\notherwise endorsed by any advertiser, and it is not an advertiser's\nresponsibility to ensure posts and/or questions are answered.\n\nWrite a comment\n\n  * Most Recent\n  * Oldest First\n  * Most Helpful\n\nCancel reply\n\n  1.

Exit Row Seat Guest\n\nMarch 27, 2024, 11:37 am\n\nDisturbed that a photo of a boarding pass is enough to fool the system. Need\nsomething like checks which have a ghost image to detect Xerox copies. Also,\ngate agents should have raised a flag. Each \"beep\" is reflected as the\nofficial manifest. If there had been empty seats, he would have gotten away\nwith it.\n\nHelpful\n\nReply\n\n    1. Never In Doubt Guest\n\nMarch 27, 2024, 11:52 am\n\nIdeally, it would be an NFC \"pass\" like you get for many sporting events (and\nconcerts?). Photos of those are meaningless.\n\nBut if you watch the video, the system caught that the boarding pass had\nalready been used, but the gate agent let the real ticket holder go anyway.\nThat's a human factors problem.\n\nHelpful\n\nReply\n\n  7.
