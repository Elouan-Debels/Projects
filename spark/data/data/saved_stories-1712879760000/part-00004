But the connection is still\nthere, all the way down to the bone. About 150 million years ago, in the\nJurassic, the first birds evolved from small, feathery, raptor-like dinosaurs,\nbecoming another branch on the dinosaur family tree. For more than 80 million\nyears, birds of all sorts flourished, from loon-like swimmers with teeth to\nbeaked birds that carried streamer-like feathers as they flew.\n\nWith hindsight, birds can be categorized as avian dinosaurs and all the other\nsorts\u2014from Stegosaurus to Brontosaurus\u2014are non-avian dinosaurs. The entire\nreason paleontologists make that split is because of a catastrophe that struck\n66 million years ago. An asteroid more than 6 miles across struck what\u2019s now\nthe Yucatan Peninsula, triggering the fifth mass extinction in the world\u2019s\nhistory. Some of the debris thrown into the atmosphere returned to Earth, the\nfriction turning the air into an oven and sparking forest fires as it landed\nall over the world. Then the intensity of the heat pulse gave way to a\nprolonged impact winter, the sky blotted out by soot and ash as temperatures\nfell. All told, more than 75 percent of species known from the end of the\nCretaceous period, 66 million years ago, didn\u2019t make it to the following\nPaleogene period. The geologic break between the two is called the K-Pg\nboundary, and beaked birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the disaster.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of discussion about what enabled modern-type birds to\nsurvive the K-Pg extinction while other birds groups, non-avian dinosaurs, and\neven pterosaurs perished,\u201d says Royal BC Museum paleontologist Derek Larson.\nThe end of the Cretaceous boasted an entire array of birds and bird-like\nreptiles. But of these groups, it was only the beaked birds that survived. The\nhappenstances of evolution had given birds a lucky break, the key events set\nin motion long before the asteroid struck.\n\nAll living birds have toothless beaks, but this wasn\u2019t always so. The very\nfirst bird, the 150 million-year-old Archaeopteryx, initially confounded 19th\ncentury naturalists because it had teeth. For tens of millions of years after\nArchaeopteryx, toothed birds continued to thrive and evolve alongside their\ndinosaurian relatives. And some of these toothed birds eventually lost their\nteeth, plucking up their meals with toothless beaks instead.\n\nThe question is what evolutionary pressures pushed birds to lose teeth when\nteeth seem so useful. Given that most birds fly, adaptation to the air seemed\nlike a possibility. \u201cOlder hypotheses focused on the idea of weight reduction\nfor flight,\u201d says University of Texas at Austin paleontologist Grace Musser,\nbut the discovery that some toothed birds were strong fliers has led\nresearchers back to the drawing board.\n\nRather than flight, food might have given birds an evolutionary nudge towards\ntoothless beaks as ancient avians thrived among other dinosaurs.\nPaleontologists have noticed that some dinosaur groups, including birds,\nevolved beaks and lost teeth as they became more herbivorous. While the\nearliest birds had teeth to nab insects and other small morsels, some bird\nlineages started to specialize on fruit, seeds, and other plant foods. Instead\nof teeth to catch, the birds evolved beaks to pluck and pick.\n\nAmong the birds that began to lose teeth in favor of beaks, the way beaks form\nduring development may have helped the evolutionary shift. \u201cChanges to the\nskull and face as the beak became more complex may have moved developing\ntissues around, changing how they interact in the embryo, and resulted in the\nloss of tooth formation,\u201d says King\u2019s College London anatomist Abigail Tucker.\n\n\u201cAll the things that make birds, birds, were already in place well before the\nmass extinction,\u201d says University College London anatomist Ryan Felice.\n\nWhen the extinction struck, the traits birds had been evolving for millions of\nyears made the difference between life and death. While some birds survived\nthe impact and its aftermath, not all of them did. \u201cWhen we think about\nhypotheses of traits that let birds survive, we need to take into account that\nit was only a small sliver of diversity that made it to the other side,\u201d\nFelice says. Entire groups of birds, such as toothed birds called\nenantiornithes, went extinct. It\u2019s unlikely that one single trait determined\nthe fate of all these species. Still, surviving extinction often comes down to\nluck, and beaks may have been some birds\u2019 ace.\n\nBy the end of the Cretaceous, beaked birds were already eating a much more\nvaried diet than their toothed relatives. These birds weren\u2019t specialized on\ninsects or other animal food, and so they were able to pluck up hard food\nitems like seeds and nuts. And in the aftermath of the extinction, when animal\nlife was severely cut back, those hard, persistent little morsels got beaked\nbirds through the hard times. Beaked birds were able to feed on the seeds of\nthe destroyed forests and wait out the decades until vegetation began to\nreturn.\n\nNot that beaks guaranteed survival of the impact event. The duck-like bird\nVegavis lived at the end of the Cretaceous and had a beak, yet there\u2019s no\nindication that this avian survived. \u201cJust having a beak was not enough,\u201d\nTucker says. Rather, it\u2019s that birds with beaks and powerful gizzards capable\nof crushing tough seeds had an unexpected advantage that increased their\nchances of survival.\n\nBoth fossils and the timeline of bird evolution discerned from their genetic\nrelationships indicates that early members of modern bird groups\u2014such as birds\nrelated to ducks, parrots, and chickens\u2014were around by time the asteroid\nstruck. These groups still suffered losses, but enough survived to set up a\nnew pulse of bird evolution in the millions of years following the\ncatastrophe. Many bird lineages became smaller in size while maintaining their\nbrain size. Through evolutionary shrinking, birds wound up with larger brains\ncompared to their body size, setting the stage for avian intelligence beyond\nwhat the non-avian dinosaurs could have evolved.\n\nBut big evolutionary changes often come with constraints. \u201cThe loss of teeth\ndoes limit the number of dietary niches birds could explore,\u201d Felice says.\n\u201cHerbivorous mammals and non-avian dinosaurs evolved ever-growing teeth so\nthat could continue eating as the plants wore their teeth down, but this just\nisn\u2019t possible with a beak,\u201d Felice says. And that means that bird skulls\nhaven\u2019t needed to vary as much to support different jaws and ways of feeding,\nmeaning that birds look like evolutionary slowpokes compared to non-avian\ndinosaurs\u2014as Felice and colleagues found in a new study of bird skull\nevolution.\n\nTo understand more about how birds managed to survive and make a living in a\nworld recovering from one of the worst mass extinctions of all time, the task\nat hand is to find more fossils from the time directly following the mass\nextinction, from a time called the Paleocene. Paleontologists have some great\nexamples of fossil birds from about 10 million years after the disaster, from\na time called the Eocene, but birds fossils from the slice in between the\nCretaceous and Eocene are fragmentary and hard to find. These are the bones\nthat may reveal new secrets.\n\nGet the latest Science stories in your inbox.\n\nRiley Black | | READ MORE\n\nRiley Black is a freelance science writer specializing in evolution,\npaleontology and natural history who blogs regularly for Scientific American.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
