Photograph: Thomas Harding\n\nThe ObserverHolocaust\n\nInterview\n\n# \u2018Mum knew what was going on\u2019: Brigitte H\u00f6ss on living at Auschwitz, in the\nZone of Interest family\n\nThomas Harding\n\nHer father was Rudolf H\u00f6ss, the camp\u2019s commandant. He was arrested by the\nJewish great-uncle of the writer Thomas Harding, to whom Brigitte gave this,\nher final interview \u2013 and confession\n\nShare\n\nIt was the morning of 16 December 2021, a week before Christmas. Across from\nme sat Brigitte, the daughter of Rudolf H\u00f6ss, the commandant of Auschwitz. I\nwas here to ask what life was like next to the camp.\n\nBrigitte was 88 years old. With pale lips, thin arms and wisps of white hair,\nshe was frailer than she had been the last time I saw her. Her voice was\nweaker too, her speech more languid and halting. But she was still able to\nthink clearly and her eyes still sparkled with life.\n\nWe were sitting in Brigitte\u2019s curtains-drawn house in the suburbs of\nWashington DC. The neighbourhood was full of senators, lobbyists and lawyers.\nThe streets were wide and lined with trees that had long lost their leaves.\n\nNext to me stood a scraggy Christmas tree. From its branches hung homemade\nornaments that decades before Brigitte had brought from Germany. \u201cMutti made\nmany of those,\u201d she told me with a fond smile. Mutti was Hedwig H\u00f6ss, the wife\nof the commandant of Auschwitz.\n\nI had first interviewed Brigitte in 2013. Up till then, she had said little to\nher children about Auschwitz. She had never before spoken to a journalist. It\nhad taken me three years to persuade her to talk with me.\n\nThe H\u00f6ss family in the Auschwitz villa, 1943. Anticlockwise from left:\nBrigitte, Hedwig holding Annegret, Hans J\u00fcrgen, Heidetraud, Rudolf and Klaus.\nPhotograph: Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte M\u00fcnchen\n\nIn all, I spoke with Brigitte for more than 20 hours. This became the basis\nfor an article I wrote for the Washington Post which was syndicated around the\nworld. It was the first time that one of Rudolf H\u00f6ss\u2019s children had chosen to\nspeak publicly, the first time that one of them had opened up about life in\nthe villa next to the camp.\n\nDuring these interviews, Brigitte had provided the basic facts: in 1940, she\nhad been seven years old when she arrived at the camp with her family. She had\nremained at the villa till 1944 when they moved to Berlin for the final months\nof the war.\n\nIn April 1945, just before the Soviet army took Berlin, her father had gone on\nthe run. He took on the identity of a seaman and worked at a farm near\nFlensburg in northern Germany. Brigitte, her mother and siblings hid in a\nnearby sugar factory.\n\nA year later, a captain from the British army was given the job of searching\nfor Brigitte\u2019s father. This captain happened to be my great-uncle, Hanns\nAlexander, who was a German Jew from Berlin. He found Brigitte and the others\nin the sugar factory and demanded to know where her father was hiding.\nBrigitte told me that he shouted so hard at her that for the rest of her life\nshe had headaches. With information provided by Hedwig, he tracked down Rudolf\nH\u00f6ss and arrested him. I later wrote a book about this story, Hanns and\nRudolf.\n\nBrigitte left Germany in the 1950s and started a new life in Spain. For three\nyears, she was a model for Balenciaga in Madrid, where she met her Irish-\nAmerican husband, an engineer. They moved to Washington in the 1970s and\nBrigitte worked in a fashion boutique for 35 years.\n\nIn the years since carrying out these interviews, I came to realise that there\nwere gaps in the history. Episodes that needed completing. Questions that\nneeded to be answered. I wanted to get Brigitte on the record one last time\nbefore it was too late. For the sake of history. It would be one final\ninterview.\n\nSo it was that eight years later, in December 2021, I was once again sitting\nin Brigitte\u2019s living room in the gloomy and cluttered house outside Washington\nDC. \u201cWhat was your first memory?\u201d I started by asking. \u201cAuschwitz,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember anything before that.\u201d\n\nAnd her siblings, what were they like? \u201cI was closest to my younger brother,\nHans J\u00fcrgen,\u201d she said. \u201cI had most fun with him. I went horseback riding with\nmy sister.\u201d Brigitte slept in the villa with her sister Heidetraud. Her two\nbrothers Klaus and Hans J\u00fcrgen shared a bedroom while baby Annegret slept in a\nlittle basket in a room with a nanny who looked after her. \u201cI remember we had\nfun,\u201d she said, \u201cWe had a little swimming pool in the backyard. And my mother\nhad a beautiful garden house with flowers. She loved flowers. I inherited\nthat, I love flowers too.\u201d They also had pets. Two tortoises called Jumbo and\nDilla and two big dalmatians.\n\nBut she was always aware of danger. When there was an air-raid warning they\nhad to dash to the basement. \u201cWe had a little suitcase next to our bed with\nclothes in it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWe picked it up and went downstairs when my mom\nsaid: \u2018Let\u2019s go downstairs.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer mother and father were very close, Brigitte told me. \u201cThey loved each\nother.\u201d At the weekends, her father didn\u2019t have to go to what she called\n\u201cwork\u201d. He could spend time with his family.\n\n\u201cHe was a wonderful dad,\u201d she said. \u201cOn Sundays he smoked a cigar through the\nwhole house. We had breakfast, lunch or dinner, like a nice family.\u201d She then\nadded: \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know what his work was really.\u201d\n\nOne of her favourite times of the year was Christmas. Her parents would hang\nornaments on the tree and when they were finished her father would ring a\nbell. Brigitte made a ting-a-ling sound when she recounted this story.\n\n\u201cDad then opened the door. And there was a tree with all the lights on, real\nwhite candles. And so you could look at it. But first we had to eat Christmas\nEve dinner. And then after this we could get under the tree. Always there were\nreal cookies. And we could get some down. And eat some. Not all, just a\ncouple.\u201d\n\nBrigitte said she knew that the people who worked in the villa and garden were\nprisoners in the camp. \u201cThey were always very happy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey called\nmy mother, the Angel of Auschwitz.\u201d Seeing my surprise, Brigitte said: \u201cMy mom\nwas just a nice person. Period.\u201d\n\nRudolf H\u00f6ss after his arrest. He had been beaten up. Photograph: Yad Vashem\n\nIn the 1970s, Hedwig visited Brigitte in Washington but they rarely discussed\nAuschwitz. \u201cIt was too painful,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure my mom knew what was\ngoing on [in the camp]. She was very sad about it. But she couldn\u2019t help. She\njust tried to be nice with the children and with my father.\u201d\n\nBefore he was hanged in Auschwitz, in April 1947, Rudolf H\u00f6ss wrote his final\nwords to Brigitte and her sister Heidetraud. I read this to Brigitte:\n\n\u201cYou are yet too young to learn the extent of the hard fate dished out to us.\nBut you especially, my dear good girls, are specially obligated to stand at\nyour poor unfortunate mother\u2019s side and with love assist her in every way you\ncan. Surround her with all your childlike love from your heart and show her\nhow much you love her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat just sounds like my dad,\u201d she said when I finished. \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nSo what was her father like? I asked. \u201cHe was a wonderful, absolute wonderful\nperson,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have wished for a better father.\u201d\n\nWas he affectionate, I asked?\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe was always hugging. At night, he would give us a\nkiss and tell us: \u2018Schlaf sch\u00f6n Nacht meine Kinder\u2019 [Sleep well my children].\u201d\n\nBrigitte paused. \u201cLater, we found out what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t really like to\ntalk about it because I didn\u2019t like this idea what they did. But I know it was\nnot my dad\u2019s fault.\u201d She paused again, before adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think he knew\nwhat he got into when he started. Because he was very unhappy many times. And\nwhen I talked with my mom after all this happened, you know, she told me he\nwas a very unhappy man.\u201d\n\nI pushed her on this. How could her father be an \u201cabsolute wonderful person\u201d\nif he was responsible for the murder of over a million women, men and\nchildren?\n\n\u201cWell ...,\u201d she stammered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fact. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she conceded. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think ... I mean I don\u2019t see it like this.\u201d\n\nArchive picture of the H\u00f6ss children playing in their pool. Photograph: Rainer\nH\u00f6ss/Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte M\u00fcnchen\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s true. You do agree it\u2019s true? You know, it\u2019s true?\u201d I pushed.\n\n\u201cWell, it happened,\u201d she said weakly.\n\n\u201cIt happened at Auschwitz?\u201d I said to be clear.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice barely audible.\n\n\u201cAnd your father was the commandant?\u201d I continued.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said again.\n\n\u201cSo he was responsible?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I said, things happen sometimes.\u201d She then waited a moment, and added:\n\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to know certain things.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d I pressed. \u201cYou know that he was responsible. You do know\nthat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she still resisted, \u201cbecause there were people on\ntop of him, who made him do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he still did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, I guess,\u201d she at last conceded, \u201cI have to say yes.\u201d\n\nAnd with that the interview was over. I packed up my recording equipment, put\naway my notes and said goodbye.\n\nBrigitte and Heidetraud with soldiers in Auschwitz. Photograph: Rainer H\u00f6ss\n\nLess than two years later, in October 2023, Brigitte died. The only one of her\nsiblings still alive is Annegret, but she was just a baby when they lived at\nthe camp. And so with Brigitte\u2019s death we have lost the last person to\nremember what life was like for the commandant\u2019s family who lived in the villa\nin Auschwitz.\n\nOn 10 March 2024, The Zone of Interest won two Oscars for best international\nfeature film and best sound. This film tells the story of what life was like\nfor the H\u00f6ss family in the villa next to Auschwitz. It was released after\nBrigitte died.\n\nI am therefore glad that I was able to record her testimony on the record for\nthe sake of history, for the sake of anyone who wants to understand how human\nbeings are capable of carrying out such an atrocity, for anyone who wants to\nstop such things from happening again.\n\nThomas Harding is the author of Hanns and Rudolf (Windmill, \u00a312.99)\n\nYou can follow him on X: @thomasharding\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Holocaust\n  * The Observer\n  * Nazism\n  * The Zone of Interest\n  * Second world war\n  * Germany\n  * Europe\n  * Family\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
