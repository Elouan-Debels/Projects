RealPeopleGroup/Getty Images\n\n  * Women on TikTok are reporting surprise pregnancies while using Ozempic.\n  * This occurs because GLP-1 drugs can interfere with how birth control pills are absorbed.\n  * Metabolic improvements due to weight loss may also play a role.\n  * The maker of Ozempic advises going off this medication before conceiving.\n  * Health experts say if you do become pregnant while using it, you should stop taking it immediately.\n\nIn a new trend that many have dubbed \u201cOzempic babies,\u201d women are reporting on\nsocial media that they are becoming pregnant after using GLP-1 drugs like\nOzempic (semaglutide) for weight loss.\n\nSome, like TikToker @fxshel1995, are reporting that they became pregnant after\nyears of infertility.\n\nIn a response post, @dkalsolive, shared she was told she was infertile after\nher second c-section but also became pregnant four months after she began\ntaking Ozempic.\n\nYet others, like @haleyfriend11, replied to the post saying that they became\npregnant despite taking precautions.\n\n\u201cI also got pregnant on Ozempic & was on the pill! Baby boy is due in June,\u201d\nshe wrote.\n\nAnd, although children conceived while using the drug are often called\n\u201cOzempic babies,\u201d some expectant moms, like @Chelsea, were proclaiming success\nwith other GLP-1 drugs as well.\n\n\u201cStruggled with infertility for 8 years. Started Mounjaro, and 10 months later\npregnant with our miracle baby,\u201d she commented.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on with the Ozempic baby boom? Are GLP-1 drugs somehow able\nto boost fertility? Or is something else going on?\n\n##\n\nHow GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic can interfere with oral birth control\n\nDr. Neha Lalani \u2014 a board certified endocrinologist with a private practice at\nBluebonnet Diabetes & Endocrinology in West Lake Hills, Austin, Texas \u2014\nconfirmed that the phenomenon is definitely real.\n\n\u201cWe have seen cases of failure of oral contraception as well as boosted\nfertility with drugs like GLP-1 agonists,\u201d she stated.\n\nRegarding the failure of birth control pills, Lalani said it has to do with\nhow GLP-1 agonists, as well as GIP/GLP-1 agonists, work.\n\nThese medications slow down stomach emptying, so they affect how food and\nmedications are absorbed.\n\n\u201cThis causes oral birth control pills to not be absorbed consistently,\nespecially each time the dose of GLP-1/ GIP+ GLP-1 agonists are stepped up,\u201d\nshe explained. \u201cThis is resulting in failure of oral birth control pills.\u201d\n\nLalani advises that people should use alternative methods of birth control\nwhen they are using these medications.\n\n##\n\nHow fertility may be affected by GLP-1 Drugs like Ozempic\n\nRegarding any direct effects on fertility, Lalani noted that more research is\nneeded before we can say how GLP-1 agonists affect reproductive function.\n\nHowever, Lalani speculated that the effect could be due to the fact that these\nmedications cause weight loss.\n\n\u201c[I]ncreased fertility and surprise pregnancy has been well-reported in\npreviously infertile patients, even with modest weight loss (approximately 5%)\nwith lifestyle modification as well as other weight loss medications,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nLalani added that the improvements in metabolic health created by weight loss\ncould be capable of restoring ovarian function.\n\nDr. Jamie Grifo, Program Director at NYU Langone Fertility Center in New York\nCity and Chief Executive Physician at Inception Fertility, agreed with this\nassessment, saying, \u201cMany high BMI patients do not ovulate, some have\npolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and many just don\u2019t ovulate regularly.\n\n\u201cWith the weight loss from these drugs, many women who are anovulatory start\nto have regular ovulation and menses, which takes them from a low fertility\nsituation to a more normal fertile state,\u201d he explained.\n\n##\n\nWhat to do if you become pregnant while taking Ozempic\n\n\u201cThere are serious risks to pregnancy when on these drugs, and women need to\nbe monitored very closely, especially if they are trying to get pregnant,\u201d\nadded Grifo, going on to explain that a medical endocrinologist who\nspecializes in weight loss, diabetes, and endocrine issues would be the best\nchoice for supervising your case.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the maker of the Ozempic and Wegovy brands of semaglutide \u2014\nwhich are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity,\nrespectively \u2014 provided Healthline with a statement saying it is not currently\nknown how safe these medications are for use in pregnant people.\n\nThose people who were either pregnant or trying to become pregnant were\nexcluded from semaglutide trials, so not enough human data is available to\nestablish whether semaglutide is associated with major birth defects,\nmiscarriage, or adverse outcomes for either the mother or the baby.\n\nHowever, animal studies done with Wegovy suggest that there may be risks to\nusing it.\n\nA study looking into the safety of Wegovy during human pregnancy is ongoing\nand not due to be completed until August 2027.\n\nCurrently, the prescribing information for Ozempic states that people should\ndiscontinue the drug for at least two months prior to becoming pregnant to\nallow sufficient time for the drug to be eliminated from their bodies.\n\nWegovy provides a similar warning while additionally stating that it may cause\nharm to the fetus and should be discontinued as soon as someone knows they are\npregnant.\n\n\u201cIndividual patient decisions should be made together with a healthcare\nprovider, as part of a shared decision-making process,\u201d the drugmaker advised.\n\n##\n\nTakeaway\n\nSeveral people are taking to social media to report that they have become\npregnant after using GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic \u2014 sometimes after previous\ninfertility or despite being on birth control pills.\n\nDoctors say GLP-1 drugs interfere with the absorption of birth control pills,\nmaking them less reliable.\n\nThe fact that weight loss improves metabolic health, which might help restore\novulation in infertile women, may also play a role.\n\nIt is not currently known whether GLP-1 drugs are safe during pregnancy.\nHowever, animal studies indicate that they could be harmful to the developing\nfetus.\n\nIt is advised that people stop taking drugs like Ozempic two months prior to\ntrying to become pregnant.\n\nIf they become pregnant while using one of these medications, they should\nimmediately stop taking it and consult with a physician.\n\n### How we reviewed this article:\n\nOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and
