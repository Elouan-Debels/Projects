Turing Award\n\nAn honor regarded as the \u201cNobel Prize of Computing\u201d\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n## Press Contact\n\nLee Sandberg\n\nlsandberg@ias.edu\n\n609-455-4398\n\n  * Email\n  * Share\n  * Share\n  * Tweet\n\nDan Komoda\n\nAvi Wigderson, Herbert H. Maass Professor in the Institute for Advanced\nStudy\u2019s School of Mathematics, was named by the Association for Computing\nMachinery (ACM) as the recipient of the 2023 ACM A.M. Turing Award, often\nreferred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing.\" With this honor, Wigderson has\nbecome the first person to receive both a Turing Award and the Abel Prize,\nwidely considered to be the highest recognition for lifetime achievement in\nmathematics.\n\nThe Turing award recognizes Wigderson\u2019s foundational contributions to the\ntheory of computation, which include reshaping understanding of the role of\nrandomness in computation, and decades of intellectual leadership in\ntheoretical computer science.\n\nWatch this video of Wigderson discussing his Turing Award and research career\nin a conversation with IAS Director and Leon Levy Professor David Nirenberg.\n\n\"I am excited that the ACM has again recognized with this award the theory of\ncomputation community, which has contributed so much to computing practice and\ntechnology,\" said Wigderson. \"I feel lucky to be part of this extremely\ndynamic community, whose fundamental goals have deep conceptual, intellectual,\nand scientific meaning, well beyond practical motivations. My four decades in\nthis field have been a continuous joyride, with fun problems, brilliant\nresearchers, and many students, postdocs, and collaborators who have become\nclose friends.\" An invitation to the important field and its many parts is\navailable in Wigderson\u2019s book Mathematics and Computation, which is freely\navailable from his website.\n\nAt IAS, Wigderson leads a program in Computer Science and Discrete Mathematics\n(CSDM), which was formally established in 1999 with his appointment to the\npermanent Faculty. However, the Institute\u2019s history as a leading center for\ncomputational research stretches back far beyond this. The Electronic Computer\nProject (ECP), led by founding IAS Faculty John von Neumann, resulted in the\nconstruction of one of the world\u2019s first stored-program computers on the\nInstitute\u2019s campus. The computer produced by the ECP was the practical\nrealization of the mathematical foundations of computing articulated by\nBritish mathematician Alan M. Turing, after whom the ACM A.M. Turing Award is\nnamed. Von Neumann has also made many theoretical contributions to\nunderstanding computation in cellular automata, fault-tolerant circuits, and\nthe brain.\n\n\"Ever since von Neumann\u2019s IAS computer project turned Turing\u2019s theoretical\ncomputational model into a reality that launched the computing revolution,\ntheorists following their curiosity and mathematical insights have paved the\nway for the new computing technologies we all use,\" said David Nirenberg, IAS\nDirector and Leon Levy Professor. \"Avi has continued that tradition at the\nInstitute for the past quarter century, and I am delighted to congratulate him\non the 2023 ACM A.M. Turing Award, which recognizes his many contributions to\nthe theoretical foundations of computer science.\"\n\nWigderson\u2019s key contributions have enhanced understanding of the role of\nrandomness and pseudorandomness in computation. Computer scientists have\ndiscovered a remarkable connection between randomness and computational\ndifficulty (i.e., identifying natural problems that have no efficient\nalgorithms). Working with colleagues, Wigderson authored a highly influential\nseries of works on trading hardness for randomness. They proved, under\nstandard and widely believed computational assumptions, that every\nprobabilistic polynomial time algorithm can be efficiently derandomized\n(namely, made fully deterministic). In other words, randomness is not\nnecessary for efficient computation. This sequence of works revolutionized the\nways in which computer scientists think about randomness, ideas which were\napplicable to many areas of theoretical computer science.\n\n\"Avi has made fundamental contributions to the theory of computation from\nparallel algorithms to cryptography to absolutely all aspects of complexity\ntheory,\" said Shafi Goldwasser, Director of the Simons Institute for the\nTheory of Computing, a past IAS Visiting Professor (2021), and a 2012 A.M.\nTuring Award Laureate. \"His numerous contributions over decades to the areas\nof derandomization and pseudorandomness has led us to a deep understanding of\nthe deep role of randomness in computing.\"\n\nAndrea Kane\n\nWigderson engaged in discussion with participants at his \"Optimization,\nComplexity and Invariant Theory\" conference, hosted on the IAS campus in June\n2018\n\nIn addition to these groundbreaking technical contributions, Wigderson is\nrecognized as an esteemed mentor and colleague, who has advised countless\nyoung researchers.\n\nPrior to joining the IAS Faculty, Wigderson held academic appointments at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley (1983\u201384); IBM Research, San Jose\n(1984\u201385); Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley (1985\u201386);\nPrinceton University (1990\u201392); and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n(1986\u20132003).\n\nWigderson is the recipient of numerous other awards, including the Rolf\nNevanlinna Prize (1994); Levi L. Conant Prize (2008); G\u00f6del Prize (2009);\nDonald E. Knuth Prize (2019); Abel Prize (2021); and Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize\nin Distributed Computing (2023). He is currently a Fellow of the ACM (since\n2018) and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 2011)\nand the National Academy of Sciences (since 2013).\n\nAbout the Institute\n\nThe Institute for Advanced Study has served as one of the leading independent\ncenters for theoretical research and intellectual inquiry since its\nestablishment in 1930, advancing the frontiers of knowledge across the\nsciences and humanities. From founding IAS Faculty Albert Einstein, Erwin\nPanofsky, and John von Neumann to influential figures Emmy Noether, George\nKennan, and J. Robert Oppenheimer to the foremost thinkers of the present, IAS\nis dedicated to enabling independent inquiry and fundamental discovery.\n\nEach year, the Institute welcomes more than 250 of the world\u2019s most promising\npost-doctoral researchers and scholars who are selected and mentored by a\npermanent Faculty, each of whom are preeminent leaders in their fields. Among\npresent and past Faculty and Members, there have been 35 Nobel Laureates, 44\nof the 62 Fields Medalists, and 23 of the 27 Abel Prize Laureates, as well as\nwinners of the Pulitzer Prize in History; the Wolf, Holberg, and Kluge prizes;\nand many MacArthur and Guggenheim fellows, among other honors.\n\nAvi Wigderson\n\nComputer Science\n\nElectronic Computer Project\n\nJohn von Neumann\n\nSchool of Mathematics\n\nShafi Goldwasser\n\nidea\n\n### Mathematics and Computation\n\nA book by Avi Wigderson\n\nIAS News\n\n### \u201cBecoming Bodies\u201d Exhibition Explores the History of Computing,\nCybernetics, and Cyberorganisms\n\nMarch 08, 2024\n\nPress Release\n\n### Avi Wigderson Awarded 2021 Abel Prize\n\nMarch 17, 2021\n\nInstitute for Advanced Study 1 Einstein Drive Princeton, New Jersey 08540 USA\n\n### Phone\n\n(609) 734-8000\n\n### Email\n\ncontactus@ias.edu\n\n## Support\n\nHelp our scientists and scholars continue their field-shaping work.\n\nGive Now\n\n## Connect\n\neNews Signup\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Institute for Advanced Study\n\n", "frontpage": false}
