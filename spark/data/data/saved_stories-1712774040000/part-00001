More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.\n  * Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python function names in traces.\n  * Many large and small performance improvements (like PEP 709 and support for the BOLT binary optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.\n\n## Type annotations\n\n  * New type annotation syntax for generic classes (PEP 695).\n  * New override decorator for methods (PEP 698).\n\n## Deprecations\n\n  * The deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623.\n  * In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).\n  * The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package continues to provide the distutils module.\n  * A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.\n  * Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the future.)\n  * The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation for performance enhancements. (This should not affect most users as it is an internal detail, but it may cause problems for Cython-generated code.)\n\nFor more details on the changes to Python 3.12, see What's new in Python 3.12.\n\n# More resources\n\n  * Online Documentation.\n  * PEP 693, the Python 3.12 Release Schedule.\n  * Report bugs via GitHub Issues.\n  * Help fund Python directly or via GitHub Sponsors, and support the Python community.\n\nFull Changelog\n\n# Files\n\nVersion| Operating System| Description| MD5 Sum| File Size| GPG| Sigstore|\nSBOM  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nGzipped source tarball| Source release| 3c5498a34d5226c9b746b1199f0bf2d9| 25.9\nMB| SIG| .sigstore| SPDX  \nXZ compressed source tarball| Source release|\n8defb33f0c37aa4bdd3a38ba52abde4e| 19.7 MB| SIG| .sigstore| SPDX  \nmacOS 64-bit universal2 installer| macOS| for macOS 10.9 and later|\n6114a3bb9b288f23ab38dbbb959be1bf| 43.6 MB| SIG| .sigstore  \nWindows installer (64-bit)| Windows| Recommended|\nc86949710e0471a065db970290819489| 25.5 MB| SIG| .sigstore  \nWindows installer (ARM64)| Windows| Experimental|\nef016521b5a147f3ded730801d36a350| 24.7 MB| SIG| .sigstore  \nWindows embeddable package (64-bit)| Windows|\n38cce2bf5b4de76db19a31f46a0720de| 10.5 MB| SIG| .sigstore  \nWindows embeddable package (32-bit)| Windows|\n65d873c723db66d6746e9872df5a715e| 9.4 MB| SIG| .sigstore  \nWindows embeddable package (ARM64)| Windows| 3229271cac55ff913aad1bb46ebc9931|\n9.8 MB| SIG| .sigstore  \nWindows installer (32 -bit)| Windows| a95c4fbdce0b6a22ca7cfb450f57c616| 24.2\nMB| SIG| .sigstore  \n  \n\u25b2 Back to Top\n\n  * About\n\n    * Applications\n    * Quotes\n    * Getting Started\n    * Help\n    * Python Brochure\n  * Downloads\n\n    * All releases\n    * Source code\n    * Windows\n    * macOS\n    * Other Platforms\n    * License\n    * Alternative Implementations\n  * Documentation\n\n    * Docs\n    * Audio/Visual Talks\n    * Beginner's Guide\n    * Developer's Guide\n    * FAQ\n    * Non-English Docs\n    * PEP Index\n    * Python Books\n    * Python Essays\n  * Community\n\n    * Diversity\n    * Mailing Lists\n    * IRC\n    * Forums\n    * PSF Annual Impact Report\n    * Python Conferences\n    * Special Interest Groups\n    * Python Logo\n    * Python Wiki\n    * Code of Conduct\n    * Community Awards\n    * Get Involved\n    * Shared Stories\n  * Success Stories\n\n    * Arts\n    * Business\n    * Education\n    * Engineering\n    * Government\n    * Scientific\n    * Software Development\n  * News\n\n    * Python News\n    * PSF Newsletter\n    * PSF News\n    * PyCon US News\n    * News from the Community\n  * Events\n\n    * Python Events\n    * User Group Events\n    * Python Events Archive\n    * User Group Events Archive\n    * Submit an Event\n  * Contributing\n\n    * Developer's Guide\n    * Issue Tracker\n    * python-dev list\n    * Core Mentorship\n    * Report a Security Issue\n\n\u25b2 Back to Top\n\n  * Help & General Contact\n  * Diversity Initiatives\n  * Submit Website Bug\n  * Status\n\nCopyright \u00a92001-2024.
