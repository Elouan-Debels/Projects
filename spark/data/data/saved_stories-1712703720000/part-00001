We aim to understand\n> the presence of these nutrients within atmospheres that show the presence of\n> water cloud condensates, potentially allowing the existence of aerial\n> biospheres. In this paper we introduce a framework of nutrient availability\n> levels based on the presence of water condensates and the chemical state of\n> the CHNOPS elements. These nutrient availability levels are applied to a set\n> of atmospheric models based on different planetary surface compositions\n> resulting in a range of atmospheric compositions. The atmospheric model is a\n> bottom-to-top equilibrium chemistry atmospheric model which includes the\n> atmosphere-crust interaction and the element depletion due to the formation\n> of clouds. While the reduced forms of CNS are present at the water cloud\n> base for most atmospheric compositions, P and metals are lacking. This\n> indicates the potential bio-availability of CNS, while P and metals are\n> limiting factors for aerial biospheres.\n\nComments:| accepted for publication in International Journal of Astrobiology,\n12 pages + 11 pages appendix  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04029 [astro-ph.EP]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04029v1 [astro-ph.EP] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Oliver Herbort [view email] [v1] Fri, 5 Apr 2024 11:22:00 UTC (15,285\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Habitability constraints by nutrient\navailability in atmospheres of rocky exoplanets, by Oliver Herbort and 3 other\nauthors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nastro-ph.EP\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\nastro-ph\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
