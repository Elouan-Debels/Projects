The narrative of progress provides moral cover to the tech industry\nand lulls people into thinking they no longer need to exercise moral judgment.\n\nJanuary 14, 2015 \u2022 Eric Giannella \u2022 Articles Technology & Society \u2022 morality /\nprogress / Silicon Valley / tech industry / Weber\n\nIllustration by A. Leydenfrost, 1952. CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nBrian Mayer didn\u2019t expect to become the \u201cmost hated person in San Francisco,\nfor a day.\u201d After spending thirty minutes in line for a food truck, he built a\nservice that would book reservations at Bay Area restaurants under fictional\nnames and then sell those reservations to people willing to pay to get a table\nat the last minute. To horrified observers, it was scalping and gentrification\nall in one. It even led a writer at TechCrunch, which normally channels the\ngo-go anxiety in Silicon Valley, to post an article titled \u201cStop the Jerk\nTech.\u201d When replying to critics on his blog, Mayer wrote, \u201cIs this even legal?\nIs it ethical? ... To be honest, I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time thinking\nthrough these questions. I built this site as an experiment in consumer demand\nfor a particular product...\u201d\n\nPart of the reason for the backlash against Mayer is that his service\nepitomized a shift toward amorality in Silicon Valley. It hasn\u2019t always been\nthis way. For much of its history as the heart of information technology,\npeople in Silicon Valley had robust conversations about morality and ethics.\nIn the 70s and early 80s, debates about software (free vs. commercial) and\ncompeting visions of technological utopias (e.g., libertarian vs. socialist)\nwere relatively commonplace and infused engineering choices with a distinctly\nmoral dimension. Even as recently as a decade ago, the Google founders\ninsisted they understood the distinction between opportunism and ethical\nbusiness through their motto, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201d At a minimum, debate forced\npeople to think about and articulate moral views. Yet, over time, dramatic\nexamples such as the personal computer, the internet, and search engines seem\nto have convinced those of us in Silicon Valley that information technology is\ngenerally a force for good.^[1] Moreover, the fact that these technologies\nhappen to be beneficial to people and successful in the marketplace has lulled\nmany into thinking that market success is ethics enough. As Mayer puts it, \u201cIf\nsomeone does pay for it willingly, is it really unethical?\u201d\n\nCritiques of recent scandals in Silicon Valley rightly place the blame on a\nculture that supports amorality, thoughtlessness, and ignorance rather than\nill intent.^[2] But the problem runs much deeper, because Silicon Valley\u2019s\namorality problem arises from the implicit and explicit narrative of progress\ncompanies use for marketing and that people use to find meaning in their work.\nBy accepting this narrative of progress uncritically, imagining that\ntechnological change equals historic human betterment, many in Silicon Valley\nexcuse themselves from moral reflection. Put simply, the progress narrative\nshort-circuits moral reflection on the consequences of new technologies.\n\n> The idea that technology will bring about a better world for everyone can be\n> traced back to the Enlightenment aspiration to \u201cmaster all things by\n> calculation\u201d in the words of Max Weber.\n\nThe progress narrative has a strong hold on Silicon Valley for business and\ncultural reasons. The idea that technology will bring about a better world for\neveryone can be traced back to the Enlightenment aspiration to \u201cmaster all\nthings by calculation\u201d in the words of Max Weber.^[3] The successes of science\nand technology give rise to a faith among some that rationality itself tends\nto be a force for good.^[4] This faith makes business easier because companies\ncan claim to be contributing to progress while skirting the moral views of the\nvarious groups affected by their products and services. Most investors would\nrather not see their firms get mired in the fraught issue of defining what is\nmorally better according to various groups; they prefer objective benefits,\nmeasured via return on investment (ROI) or other metrics. Yet, the fact that\nbusiness goals and cultural sentiments go hand in hand so well ought to give\nus pause.\n\nThe idea of progress is popular because it ends up negating itself, and as a\nresult, makes almost no demands upon us. In Silicon Valley, progress gets us\nthinking about objectively better, which suggests that we come up with some\nrational way to define better (e.g., ROI). But the only way to say that\nsomething is better in the sense we associate with progress is to first ask\nwhether it is moral. Morality is inherently subjective and a-rational.\nSuggesting that a technology represents progress in any meaningful, moral\nsense would require understanding the values of the people affected by the\ntechnology. Few businesses and investors would be willing to claim they\ncontributed to progress if held to account by this standard. If people are\nconcerned with assessing whether specific technologies are helpful or harmful\nin a moral sense, they should abandon the progress narrative. Progress, as we\nthink of it, invites us to cannibalize our initial moral aspirations with\nrationality, thus leaving us out of touch with moral intuitions. It leads us\nto rely on efficiency as a proxy for morality and makes moral discourse seem\nsuperfluous.\n\n#### Why progress and rationality are so closely linked in our imagination\n\nWe need to look to our cultural history to see why our understanding of\nprogress is so bound up with rationality. Silicon Valley\u2019s faith in progress\nis the purest distillation of Enlightenment ideas that Max Weber saw embodied\nin early Americans like Ben Franklin.^[5] Weber was interested in the rapidly\ngrowing role of rationality in changing how people lived and experienced\nlife.^[6] People like Ben Franklin not only thrived on a pragmatic, rational\napproach to life, they celebrated it. They took the rational and calculating\nstyle of thought that made the sciences so successful and applied it to every\naspect of life. Because worldly success demonstrated one\u2019s grace (in\nProtestant America), productivity became a moral issue and rationality was its\nengine. This allowed early Americans to view a purely means-ends approach to\nlife as praiseworthy rather than shallow.\n\nOnce this means-ends approach to life was introduced, Weber thought that there\nwas no going back. Rationally designed and managed firms would spread because\nthey would outcompete firms that were run on more traditional bases \u2013 such as\na mixture of family obligation and devotion to craft. Henry Ford\u2019s\nmanufacturing system for the Model-T would beat any other system for producing\ncars. Yet it was not just businesses that saw rationality applied in greater\nmeasure. In the German city-states of the late 19^th century, professional\nadministrators following explicit rational procedures allowed the government\nto attain a previously unimaginable level of speed, coordination and power.\nThe rapidly expanding use of rationality in planning and running human affairs\ncould also be seen in religion, the law, and even the university.\n\nWhile it had innumerable practical benefits, applying more rationality to more\nof life took an existential toll. Combined with scientific explanations of the\nnatural world, the observation that so much of life could be controlled\nthrough systematization reduced, for some, the power of traditional sources of\nmeaning \u2013 superstition, religion, as well as pre-modern ethics like honor.\nWith science being able to explain so much, and technology able to control so\nmuch, the world had become disenchanted.\n\n#### Why progress became a source of meaning\n\nWeber knew that people need narratives to provide coherence between their\nlives and their understanding of the world. He wondered what new beliefs\nmodern people would invent to find meaning in their lives. Ironically, with no\ncommon ground left but the tools of disenchantment, we have enchanted those\ntools. John Gray describes the general pattern\n\n> Modern myths are myths of salvation stated in secular terms. What both kinds\n> of myths have in common is that they answer to a need for meaning that\n> cannot be denied. In order to survive, humans have invented science. Pursued\n> consistently, scientific inquiry acts to undermine myth. But life without\n> myth is impossible, so science has become a channel for myths \u2013 chief among\n> them, a myth of salvation through science.^[7]\n\nTo put it another way, progress is the only myth left when rationality has\neviscerated other sources of meaning. Because of our faith in progress we have\ngranted rationality itself a positive moral valence.\n\nThis problem of meaning is brought to a head in Silicon Valley. In trying to\nanswer the question, \u201cwhat does all this new technology mean for us?\u201d Silicon\nValley executives, investors and journalists often default to a story about\nhuman progress. Moreover, many in Silicon Valley are so privileged and\ntalented that they can ask themselves what they would like their work to mean\nbeyond simply making them richer. Venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs\nregularly invoke phrases like \u201cmake a difference,\u201d \u201chave an impact,\u201d or\n\u201cchange the world,\u201d which suggest that they at least partially view their work\nin moral terms; in terms of beneficence. Of the thousands of investments VCs\nmight screen per year, they end up funding less than one percent. Yet, it is\ntroublingly hard to glean consistent moral criteria from their investment\nchoices. For people with so much discretion, one would think a robust concern\nwith \u201cchanging the world\u201d in any meaningful, moral sense, would at least\npreclude them from investing in companies such as Zynga; or, for that matter,\ncause them to fire the management team of Uber.\n\n> One way to claim moral credit and disavow blame is to equate economic\n> benefits with moral benefits. If productivity improves, that is morally\n> good.\n\nThe narrative of progress proves very useful here. One way to claim moral\ncredit and disavow blame is to equate economic benefits with moral benefits.\nIf productivity improves, that is morally good. If productivity does not\nimprove, it is not good, but it is also not bad. The rhetoric around\ninnovation relies on this logic. The harshest condemnation one can receive is\n\u201cnot innovative.\u201d Talking about innovation provides a means for having a\npseudo-moral discourse. It celebrates the good but fails to condemn the bad.\nMoreover, by placing all technologies within the same category, the innovation\nrhetoric legitimates each new technology product, however frivolous, by\nassociation with major beneficial technologies such as email and databases.\nThe halo cast by a tiny minority makes inquiring about the moral implications\nof new technologies appear less urgent.\n\nAnother business benefit of finding meaning in a story about innovation is\nthat it can motivate people. Imagining that major technological change might\noccur at any moment keeps buyers attentive. Journalists would rather write\nabout the significance of historical trends than incremental changes in a\nbusiness. Entrepreneurs would like to believe that the technology they are\ncommercializing will be of tremendous consequence. Some engineers can indulge\nin the knowledge that they do the hard and under-appreciated real work of\nbuilding celebrated products and services. Innovation justifies purchases,\nassigns roles, and allows people to have something bigger and more interesting\nto talk about than the fortunes of a company, but it will never lead to\nserious moral evaluation of a technology.\n\n#### When the only means are rationality, the ends become more rationality\n\nA common business model today is to optimize some activity. Information\ntechnology is perfectly suited as a tool to make activities more efficient\n(i.e., rational in a technical sense). Only a few ideologues would flat-out\nclaim that more rationality is, as a rule, good.^[8] Yet, because we\u2019ve gotten\nso adept at using information technology to rationally plan, we\u2019d like to be\nable to claim that making things more rational is good. This Enlightenment\nmotif that \u201cmore rationality = progress\u201d justifies the countless products and\nservices whose origins can be traced to someone noticing an opportunity for\noptimization. But, if we put this default assumption aside for a moment, there\nare many cases in which we need to question whether making activities more\nrational in a technical sense is moral. Is workforce-scheduling software that\nmakes single-parents\u2019 lives even more demanding a good thing? Is automating\nsomeone\u2019s job if we know they will struggle to find other work a good thing?\n\nThis brings us back to why our notion of progress is self-negating. We would\nlike progress to be defined in moral terms. Yet, because not everyone shares\nthe same morals, businesses and governments try to redefine progress in\nobjective terms. Because we fear charges of subjectivity, we look to rational\nmeans and rational measures for pursuing objective goals. Besides, moral goals\nwould, in many cases, make it impossible to serve everyone (to \u201cscale,\u201d in the\nlocal parlance). As a result, we take a technocrat\u2019s approach to progress: we\ntry to define it in objective terms and pursue it through rational means.^[9]\nYet, the only criteria we have for better (i.e., progress) are informed by\nsubjective, moral intuitions. How we might define and measure better, even in\nan economic sense (e.g., cost-of-living adjusted income or reduced income\ndisparity), is informed by moral intuitions. If we deny the importance of\nthese moral intuitions, we cannot say much, if anything, about whether\nsomething is good or bad.^[10] In our culture, progress is self-negating\nbecause we define and pursue progress solely in objective, rational terms,\nthus ignoring our inherently subjective moral intuitions and allowing them to\natrophy. It is a classic story of the means overtaking the ends.\n\n#### We need to talk more openly about moral consequences of new technologies\n\nWhat if we allowed ourselves to reflect on and talk about morality a bit more?\nA more robust public moral discourse would make it less likely that companies\nsuch as Zynga, which has a history of treating employees and customers\nterribly, receive venture capital funding or find qualified job applicants.\nMarc Pincus, the longtime CEO, was known by many as extremely focused on\n\u201cwinning\u201d\u2014dominating competitors and going public. He convinced some of the\nmost prestigious venture capital firms in the Bay Area to bankroll his\nefforts. Apart from rampant copying of other developers\u2019 games, extreme\noverwork of engineers, and vicious treatment of some employees, the design of\nZynga\u2019s games also revealed an astounding disrespect for its users. It used an\nunderstanding of behavioral psychology, even hiring a psychologist, to design\ngames to be more addictive. Had public conversation in Silicon Valley been\nmore focused on moral issues, it would have been more difficult for Pincus to\nget venture capital funding and hire sought-after engineers.\n\nThere are, of course, cases more nuanced than Zynga that would have benefitted\nfrom a more robust discourse about morality. Until it was banned by the FDA\nfrom selling a product with unproven health claims, many celebrated 23andMe\nfor doing something \u201cinnovative.\u201d (In fact, many then complained that the\ninjunction represented a \u201cgovernment threat to innovation.\u201d) The company found\na way to sell personal genetic tests for $99. People argued for the benefits\nthat the company would bring: it would lower the cost of other forms of\ngenetic testing; it would provide a massive repository of genetic data for\nresearchers. It would bring the promise of genomic medicine closer to reality.\n\nDespite 23andMe\u2019s seeming aspirations to make money while helping people, any\nconcrete benefits to consumers were far off into the future \u2013 and there were\npotential harms to consumers that were buried in Silicon Valley\u2019s excitement.\nIn other words, there were moral implications of selling the tests that we\nmight have attended to if not for our desire to have another example of a\ncommercially successful technology that helps people. For instance, do we\nthink it is good for people to obtain hard-to-interpret genetic test results?\nSome patients might get unjustified medical tests, experience unwarranted\nanxiety, change their lifestyles or, in the worst cases, may decide to stop\ntaking medications. Of course, 23andMe\u2019s investors would not want to see the\nproduct marketed as a novelty (though some consumers treated it this way).\nMany more people would be willing to purchase the product if it represented a\ncheap medical screening.\n\nThe FDA had been trying for at least four years to get 23andMe to prove its\nhealth claims or to stop making health claims. In its letter telling the\ncompany it could no longer sell products in the U.S., the FDA noted:\n\n> ...your company\u2019s website at www.23andme.com/health (most recently viewed on\n> November 6, 2013) markets the PGS [Personal Genome Service] for providing\n> \u201chealth reports on 254 diseases and conditions,\u201d including categories such\n> as \u201ccarrier status,\u201d \u201chealth risks,\u201d and \u201cdrug response,\u201d and specifically\n> as a \u201cfirst step in prevention\u201d that enables users to \u201ctake steps toward\n> mitigating serious diseases\u201d such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, and\n> breast cancer.\n\nBanned from sale in the U.S., 23andMe just began selling its product in the\nU.K. In a recent interview on the BBC, CEO Anne Wojcicki could be heard again\nexplaining the potential health benefits of her firm\u2019s genetic tests.\n\nSecond, and perhaps just as troubling, is what 23andMe has long planned to do\nwith genetic data. In order to justify the low price of its tests to\ninvestors, 23andMe will recoup money by selling aggregated data to other\ncompanies. The recently announced $60 million deal with Genentech suggests the\nreal money will be made here. Unfortunately, because genomics is such an\nimmature field, it is unclear what information is truly anonymous and what\ninformation might someday provide clues for exposing personal genetic data.\nThe marketing emphasis on medical relevance rather than fun novelty makes\nconsumers much more willing to compromise on their privacy.\n\n> 23andMe should have been a long-term research project, not a Silicon Valley\n> startup.\n\n23andMe should have been a long-term research project, not a Silicon Valley\nstartup. Given its business model, investors should not have funded it, nor\nshould the media have celebrated it. There were too many questions to be\nresolved in terms of consumer\u2019s use of the test results and potential misuse\nof genomic data by other firms.\n\nMy overall point is that the progress narrative is counterproductive. We ought\nto abandon it. A simple step is to stop using obfuscating terms that prop up a\nprogress narrative. Words like innovation, impact and disruption invite an\nabstract style of thinking and talking that leaves little room for moral\nreflection.^[11] Talking about technology in terms of progress invites a\ntechnocratic and uncritical approach to thinking about the human good. It\nquickly moves from real benefits for real people to abstract systems upon\nsystems that may someday benefit people. By encouraging this hyper-analytical\nthinking, the idea of progress desensitizes us to the use of moral judgment.\nIt allows our moral intuitions to become dull.^[12] It serves a function: it\npreserves the false connection between what some Silicon Valley firms do, in\nterms of consequences for real people, and what they claim to do in terms of\nushering in a better future. The progress narrative shrouds the tech industry\nin virtue for playing a key role in technological change while weakening moral\nevaluation of new products and services.\n\nWe ought to treat the tech industry as any other industry and put aside the\nassociation with human progress. Some technologies do improve our lives in\ngeneral, but the assumption that technology is a force for good has proved\nharmful. Letting go of the idea of progress would allow us to talk more\nclearly about the moral consequences of new products and services.\n\n#### An alternative narrative about contribution\n\nThere are alternatives to the progress narrative for making work in technology\nmeaningful. Many people find meaning in their work through a narrative about\nmaking a contribution. Rather than thinking about contribution in a historic\nsense (i.e., progress), contribution can be thought in terms of specific\ngroups of people.^[13] People in many fields\u2014teachers, cooks, doctors, among\nothers\u2014find meaning in their work through making a contribution to specific\npeople. In tech, some might define the affected group more broadly, for\nexample, programmers who rely on a software development tool, the users of a\nword processor, or the people who enjoy a particular game. The point is that\nknowing who will be affected by our work keeps us honest in terms of what we\nthink is a contribution.\n\n> Many of the complaints about Silicon Valley\u2019s service and social media tools\n> focus on the fact that they reflect the concerns and interests of privileged\n> young urbanites.\n\nThere is a second benefit to thinking of contribution in terms of specific\npeople or groups rather than human progress generally. Knowing a group through\nindividuals rather than via market segments prevents professionals from\ninadvertently imposing one set of values on groups with disparate values. In\nother words, thinking about contributions in terms of specific groups\nencourages understanding the people within those groups.^[14] Many of the\ncomplaints about Silicon Valley\u2019s service and social media tools focus on the\nfact that they reflect the concerns and interests of privileged young\nurbanites. Tools developed with the idea of contributing to specific groups\nwould do less to encourage convergence of views about what constitutes the\n\u201cgood life.\u201d^[15]\n\nNone of this is to say that there are no do-gooders in tech. There are people\nwho have a clear idea of how the technologies they are developing will serve\nspecific groups \u2013 whether pursuing social justice in the United States or for\nproviding better medical care in poorer nations. The morality of these causes\ndoes not stem from their association with progress \u2013 it flows from the desire\nto bring about real benefits that real people affected would say are good.\nAlthough it would be ideal if everyone could pursue such causes, that day is a\nlong way off.\n\nThat does not leave everyone else off the hook. Everyone can, at a minimum,\nask whether they are doing more harm than good. The trouble in Silicon Valley\nis that many talented, highly educated young people seem relatively\nunconcerned with the potential for harm. To be more aware of not harming\npeople, much less helping them, we need to cultivate moral intuitions by\ndiscussing the consequences of our work for specific people.^[16] The search\nfor solidarity with specific people, not some objectively better moment in\nhuman history, keeps us exercising our moral intuitions.\n\n#### References and Footnotes\n\n  1.

Weber\u2019s notion that formal and substantive rationality are often in competition captures an important tension here. Weber called the use of rationality to make activities more internally coherent rationalization. Rationalization is a process of logically orchestrating a set of activities in order to pursue certain ends. (Note that this is exactly what many information technologies help us do). Weber was particularly interested in the spread of formal rationality in recent history. Formal rationality strives for consistent, objective logic across contexts \u2013 it needs no reference to culture, time or place. As reliance on formal rationality expands, it often conflicts with substantive rationality. Substantive rationality is about whether something is reasonable in a particular context \u2013 it relies on subjective understandings of the people in that context. The spread of a single, technically efficient way of doing things might trample on a variety of local norms and values. The conflict in this essay might be reframed as faith in progress leading people to embrace formal rationality at the expense of substantive rationality.\n  15.

I am not claiming that we should only evaluate actions in light of their consequences (i.e., consequentialism). I am saying that, as a starting point for moral reflection, people might ask themselves whether they expect a new product or service to be beneficial or harmful to the people affected.
