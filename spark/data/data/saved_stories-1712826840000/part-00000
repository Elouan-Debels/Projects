Now,\nresearchers are trying to find out what they are actually saying.\n\nA growling \"throp\" noise emanates from the research vessel's underwater\nspeaker. A humpback breaks away from its group and approaches. The mammal\ncircles the boat. It surfaces and then dives again, tail slipping noiselessly\ninto the water, and echoes the call back.\n\nResearchers who \"conversed\" with a humpback whale say their encounter could be\nthe first step towards communication with non-human intelligence. It was in\n2021, off the coast of south-east Alaska, that the team of six scientists\nplayed a recording of a humpback greeting call using an underwater speaker.\nThey were stunned when one humpback whale they had named Twain responded in a\nconversational manner.\n\n\"It's like experiencing another world. You hear them come up to the surface.\nThen there's this big breath, you can see it, and they're all together as a\ngroup. It's just incredible,\" says Josie Hubbard, an animal behaviourist\ncurrently studying for her PhD at the University of California, Davis.\n\nHubbard was on the research vessel which was floating, all engines silenced,\nin Frederick Sound, Alaska, when she encountered humpback whales for the first\ntime. \"As per regulations, you have to stop a couple of hundred metres away\n[from the whales] and turn your engine off,\" says Hubbard. Rarely, she says,\nthe whales may approach. In this instance, 38-year-old Twain did move towards\nthe boat, and proceeded to circle the vessel for 20 minutes.\n\nHubbard is part of a Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) research\nteam, hoping to understand the communicative complexity and intelligence of\nhumpback whales. Up on the top deck, Hubbard was oblivious to the work of the\nacousticians going on beneath the surface. Below deck, Brenda McCowan was\nbroadcasting a recorded humpback contact call \u2013 a \"whup\" or \"throp\" \u2013 through\nan underwater speaker. When Twain finally moved away, Hubbard ran downstairs\nto find a hubbub of excitement. Twain had \"spoken\" back, engaging in a\n\"conversation\" that lasted a full 20 minutes.\n\nYou can listen to some of that conversation in the video below.\n\nThe first ever recorded conversation between humans and a humpback whale\n\nLong, rhythmic and constantly evolving, whales' haunting songs can flow across\nentire ocean basins. They chatter with whistles and pulses, or use\necholocation to paint pictures of their underwater world.\n\nWhales have enchanted humans for centuries. In fact, whales display a long\nlist of behaviours similar to humans. They cooperate with one another, as well\nas other species. They teach each other useful skills, look after each other's\nyoung, and play.\n\nHowever, unlike humans, the dominant sense in whales is not sight, but\nhearing. Sink 200m (660ft) below the ocean surface, and you'll travel beyond\nthe reach of light. Sound, on the other hand, can move farther and faster in\nwater than it does in the air.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Why are orcas suddenly ramming boats?\n\n\u2022 Why saving whales can help fight climate change\n\n\u2022 The hidden ocean pollution killing marine mammals\n\nBaleen whales, including humpbacks, right whales and blue whales, have evolved\na unique larynx that allows them to produce super low-frequency sounds which\ncan travel huge distances. Blue whales, for instance, emit frequencies as low\nas 12.5 Hz, classed as infrasound and below the threshold of human hearing.\nToothed whales, meanwhile, which include sperm whales, dolphins, porpoises and\norcas, are the among loudest animals on Earth and use ultra-fast clicks for\necholocation, to \"see\" their world, as well as soft burst pulses and whistles\nto communicate.\n\nCetaceans have evolved over 50 million years to produce and hear a variety of\ncomplex sounds. They rely on noise to communicate with each other, to\nnavigate, find mates and food, defend their territories and resources, and\navoid predators. Their young babble much like human infants, some are believed\nto have names, and groups from different parts of the ocean have regional\ndialects. Whales have been heard mimicking the dialects of foreign groups \u2013\nand some are even thought to have given human language a shot.\n\nThe songs of the humpback whale are thought to be among the most complex in\nthe animal kingdom. The first recording of humpback whale song was made in\n1952 by US Navy engineer Frank Watlington. Almost 20 years later, marine\nbiologist Roger Payne noticed these calls were organised in repeating\npatterns. This transformed our understanding of whale vocalisations and\nsparked an interest that would lead to decades of research.\n\nResponsible whale watching\n\nWhale watching is big business, with over 13 million people worldwide taking a\nwhale watch trip every year. And, while an encounter with a whale can be an\nincredible experience, it's important to do it in a way that doesn't cause\nthem harm. The researchers featured in this article had special permits to\ncarry out their work. Here's how you can whale watch responsibly.\n\nFast forward to today, and the Seti research team hopes deciphering whale\ncommunication could help us to understand aliens, should we encounter any. The\ngroup hypothesises that whale sounds contain complex, intelligent messages\nakin to languages used by humans or potentially extraterrestrials. However,\nsays McCowan, our understanding of whale communication is still very much in\nits infancy.\n\nOn that particular day off the coast of Alaska, McCowan had already broadcast\na host of different sounds, with no response. \"But this one call was recorded\nthe day before,\" she says, \"and it was from this population of whales. After\nplaying the contact call three times, we got this huge response. Then, to keep\nthe animal engaged, I started trying to match the latency of her calls to our\ncalls. So, if she waited 10 seconds, I waited 10 seconds. We ended up matching\neach other. We did this 36 times over a 20-minute period.\"\n\nThroughout the exchange, Twain consistently matched the interval variations\nbetween each playback call. This is thought to be the first intentional human-\nwhale interaction in humpback whale \"language\". And, as the recording was of\nTwain's family group, adds Hubbard, this could indicate some form of\nrecognition, possibly even self-recognition.\n\nHowever, studying whales is not without its challenges. McCowan emphasises\nTwain chose to approach the boat and was free to leave whenever she wanted \u2013\nbut therein lies the problem. Whales can usually be found wherever the fish\nare, adds Hubbard. \"But we don't know where the fish are. So, you have to\nsearch to find them in order to study them.\" And, to get a complete picture,\nresearchers need to replicate the data with multiple unique pods.\n\nNext, the team plan to vary the calls they broadcast. \"We're still at a very\nearly stage,\" says McCowan. \"A big challenge for us is classifying those\nsignals and determining their context, so we can ascertain meaning. I think AI\nwill help us do that.\"\n\nDan Tchernov\n\nScientists placed hydrophones in the ocean to collect recordings of sperm\nwhale vocalisations (Credit: Dan Tchernov)\n\nMore than 5,000 miles (8,000km) away, a group of artificial intelligence and\nnatural language processing experts, cryptographers, linguists, marine\nbiologists, robotic experts and underwater acousticians are also hoping to use\nAI \u2013 this time to decipher sperm whale conversation.\n\nLaunched in 2020, Ceti (Cetacean Translation Initiative), led by marine\nbiologist David Gruber, has been continuously recording a group of whales off\nthe coast of Dominica, an island in the Caribbean, using microphones on buoys,\nrobotic fish and tags fitted to the whales' backs.\n\nGruber is somewhat of an anomaly. He is a microbiologist \u2013 a scientist who\nstudies the microscopic \u2013 who has gone on to work with some of the largest\ncreatures on the planet. He began his career looking at the interactions of\nbacteria and protozoa in the ocean in relation to carbon cycling and climate\nchange. From this he moved through coral, jellyfish and sharks until his\ninterests brought him to whales. \"It's really about seeing the world from the\nperspective of animals,\" he says, or in the case of whales, \"hearing the\nworld\".\n\nWe should probably do more listening, and less talking \u2013 Samantha Blakeman\n\nSperm whales, which have the largest brains of any animal, gather at the\nocean's surface in family groups and communicate using Morse code-like\nsequences of clicks known as codas. The group of sperm whales that Ceti has\nbeen working with is made up of around 400 mothers, grandmothers and calves.\nThis pod , or two evenly spaced clicks and then three clicks in quick\nsuccession.\n\n\"It's difficult for us to peer into their world, other than these very brief\ninteractions at the surface. This is such a unique, gentle creature, and\nthere's just so much going on,\" says Gruber. \"Each time we look, we find\ndeeper complexity and structure in their communication.\" He believes that we\nare reaching a point of technological advancement that means we could \u2013\n\"possibly\" \u2013 decode whale communication.\n\nThe data collected has been processed using machine-learning algorithms to\ndetect and classify clicks, with results due to be published in 2024. The aim,\nsays Gruber, is to be able to reconstruct \"multi-party conversations\" \u2013 in\nother words to create a \"conversation\" using the sperm whales' own\nvocalisations.\n\nListen to conversations between whales while they hunt their next meal\n\nBut even if we could talk to whales, should we? Could the ability to call to\nwhales be used to hunt them, for instance?\n\nSign up to Future Earth\n\nSign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and\nhopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman.

Take sonar, which can be used to\nlocate and scare whales to the surface where they can be more easily shot. \"We\nshould probably do more listening, and less talking,\" says Samantha Blakeman,\na marine data manager for the National Oceanography Centre. She warns we\nshould be wary of anthropomorphism. \"As a scientist, you try to study things\nwithout bias,\" she says. \"You're always trying to remove yourself from the\nequation \u2013 but it is really difficult to do.\"\n\nBaleen whales are at the top of the food chain, notes Blakeman, which means\nthey play a really important role in the ecosystem. \"They're an indicator for\nthose of us studying the health of ocean ecosystems \u2013 because anything that\nhappens lower down in the food chain will affect what happens at the top,\"\nBlakeman says. More than a quarter of all cetacean species are under threat,\nlargely because of human activity.\n\nWhales are also natural fertilisers, says Blakeman. A limiting factor for life\nin the ocean is a lack of iron. Phytoplankton needs light and nutrients to\ngrow. They can usually find nitrates and phosphates \u2013 but iron tends to be\nmissing. But whales' faeces has a high concentration of iron. \"They feed in\none area and excrete in another,\" she says, \"putting the iron back into the\nwater, which can cause a flurry of life in this new area\".\n\nAmanda Cotton\n\nSperm whales communicate using morse code-like sequences of clicks known as\ncodas (Credit: Amanda Cotton)\n\nWhales also play an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle. Marine\nplankton captures carbon through photosynthesis. This plankton is then eaten\nby whales. \"When they die [whales] sink to the bottom of the ocean,\" says\nBlakeman. \"So, that carbon is kept from the atmosphere for a very, very long\ntime.\"\n\nGruber hopes Ceti's work will increase humans' connection to nature. \"AI could\nallow us to understand the communication systems of many other life forms on a\nmuch deeper level. I think it would be a good thing for the world if we really\nlisten \u2013 if we care deeply about what whales are saying.\"\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your\ninbox every Friday.\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter\nor Instagram.\n\nAnimal\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nEarth\n\nEnvironment\n\nFeatures\n\nLanguage\n\nOcean\n\nWhale\n\nRelated\n\n## The turtle that sparked a plastics revolution\n\n2 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n## Solar eclipses affect the animal world, too\n\n4 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n## The unique songbird that's gone forever\n\n8 days ago\n\nFuture\n\nMore\n\n5 hrs ago\n\n## How AI is helping to prevent future power cuts\n\nArtificial intelligence software is being used to predict electricity demand\nand supply.\n\n5 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n11 hrs ago\n\n## US English: Why do Brits hate it so?\n\nThe British sometimes have a few bugbears when it comes to US English\nspellings, but is it justified?\n\n11 hrs ago\n\nLanguage\n\n13 hrs ago\n\n## Government endorses land management overhaul\n\nA new body to transform the management of Dartmoor in Devon will be created,\nthe government says.\n\n13 hrs ago\n\nDevon\n\n13 hrs ago\n\n## How 'forever chemicals' get into tap water\n\nThe US is introducing new environmental protections aimed at limiting long-\nlived PFAS chemicals in tap water, but these are only the tip of a very\npersistent iceberg.\n\n13 hrs ago\n\nFuture\n\n16 hrs ago\n\n## Fallout video-game adaptation is a 'brutal romp'\n\nSince the 90s, the Fallout games have been a phenomenon \u2013 and now this\nvisually terrific, blackly humorous TV spin-off should prove equally as\npopular, with fans and newbies alike.\n\n16 hrs ago\n\nCulture\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
