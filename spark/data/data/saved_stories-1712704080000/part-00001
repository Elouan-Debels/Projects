However, many of them view artificial\nintelligence (AI) as a valuable tool for initial screenings of the vast pool\nof annual applicants. It\u2019s also a rising trend in corporate recruiting.\nAccording to a recent Infojobs report, AI was used by 5% of Spanish companies\nfor hiring in 2023, with plans to extend this to another 11% soon. Ultimately,\nhuman judgment prevails in the final decision-making process. While Spanish\npublic universities do not currently use AI for this purpose, private\nuniversities may embrace it in the future. The application of AI in student\nselection was a topic of discussion among university officials at the\nReinventing Higher Education conference co-hosted by Spain\u2019s IE University and\nthe University of Miami in Florida.\n\n\u201cThe top areas where AI can bring huge benefits are healthcare and education.\nSo, I think it\u2019s a mistake to try to avoid or ban it,\u201d said University of\nMiami President Julio Frenk, who has launched a pilot program in admissions.\n\u201cWe review 50,000 applications every year and select around 8,000 to 9,000\nstudents. If advanced language models can enhance selection, admission\ncommittees can make better-informed, fairer decisions for students.\u201d\n\nThe University of Miami requires candidates to submit their grades and write\nan essay about their life experiences. \u201cWe seek traits to spot individuals\nwho\u2019ve conquered challenges. While we still need human judgment, AI can\nefficiently sift through huge applicant pools.\u201d Frenk firmly denies their\napproach is elitist. \u201cIt\u2019s pointless to accept someone only for them to leave\nafter a year because they\u2019re overwhelmed by the workload. This approach helps\nus focus our scholarships more effectively.\u201d\n\nUniversities looking interested in applying AI in admissions processes need to\nclearly define the essential skills and competencies they require in students.\nBy integrating an AI platform and training a customized algorithm, they can\nidentify candidates who meet their criteria, while reducing individual biases.\nAI can also schedule and conduct interviews, keeping candidates informed\nthroughout the admissions process. People must monitor the process closely and\nanalyze student grade data for insights on trends and areas for improvement.\n\nDavid Garza, rector and executive president of the prestigious Monterrey\nInstitute of Technology (TEC) in Mexico, says his university has not\nconsidered using AI in admissions because their priority has been on applying\nit in teaching. TEC created its own bot to answer practical questions from\nuniversity students and help teachers plan and prepare classes. Garza says\nhe\u2019s in favor of AI in admissions because \u201cit can help us synthesize\ninformation. However, the final decision in a sensitive process like this one\nshould remain in the hands of committees.\u201d TEC requires an admission exam, a\nsummary of academic achievements and an essay. If the application\u2019s authorship\nis in doubt, a video is requested. TEC annually admits 6,000 students who go\nthrough a special high-school prep course, and another 6,000 from a pool of\n18,000 applicants.\n\nA class at Spain's IE University in Madrid.IE\n\nMany universities in Singapore, a global powerhouse in AI research, use AI in\nadmissions processes. But not Singapore Management University. It\u2019s vice-\nrector for research, Archan Misra, attended the conference in Miami and told\nus that if the university decides to use it in the future, it would implement\n\u201ca kind of feedback loop,\u201d so that students who exhibited the same pattern of\nsuccess would be consistently selected. Misra, a computer science professor,\noffered another useful application of language models. \u201cWe\u2019re considering AI\nto suggest interview questions for students, but the interviewer has the final\ncall on which questions to ask. It\u2019s a tool, not an AI-based student ranking\nsystem.\u201d\n\nAt IE University, with campuses in Madrid and Segovia, the admission process\nis quite complex since it attracts students from 160 countries. They have a\nunique approach to using AI in admissions. University President Santiago\n\u00cd\u00f1iguez described their development of an AI application to assist students in\nselecting a major. \u201cWe have two applications that provide uniform answers to\nthe students\u2019 questions and help them identify the most suitable major.\u201d\n\u00cd\u00f1iguez believes these types of applications are very helpful as they store\nand draw on all the information from previous candidate interviews.\n\nIE University \u201cno longer gives as much weight in admissions to essays and\nmotivational letters,\u201d said \u00cd\u00f1iguez. Letters of recommendation have also\ndropped in importance. The AI used in admissions weighs an applicant\u2019s\ncomplete academic record, admission test results and interview (to assess\nmaturity). IE University accepts 9% of its applicants.\n\nMinerva University president and founder Ben Nelson, which claims to be more\nselective than Harvard with a 1% admission rate, is concerned about AI in\nadmissions leading to \u201cfalse positives\u201d and \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d He advises\nrigorous testing before implementation. \u201cIt can be useful, but you have to be\nvery confident about it.\u201d His San Francisco-based university uses \u201cmany of its\nown automated formulas\u201d to evaluate the applicants\u2019 mathematics and language\nachievements, and the rest of the process is \u201cmanual.\u201d About 25,000 students\napply to Minerva every year.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Biden is showcasing student loan relief efforts as he campaigns in\nCalifornia\n\nAP | Los Angeles\n\n### Classes in the metaverse are now real\n\nSusana P\u00e9rez de Pablos | Madrid\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Miami\n  * Madrid\n  * Segovia\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So wenig kosten Treppenlifte 2024 wirklichTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nCheckfox\n\nAnstatt eine teure Solaranlage zu kaufen machen Hausbesitzer einen\nAngebotsvergleichCheckfox|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\nIn a lawsuit, Angelina Jolie accuses Brad Pitt of physically abusing herEl\nPa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nCelebrity reactions to the New York Earthquake: Did we just have an\nearthquake?!AS\n\nAS\n\nList of Texas schools closed for the total solar eclipse on April 8AS\n\n_\n\n### newsletter\n\nSign up to EL PA\u00cdS in English Edition bulletin\n\nAp\u00fantate\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
