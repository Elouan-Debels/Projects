Information elements appear directly on an\ninfinite virtual desktop (usually created using vector graphics), instead of\nin windows. Users can pan across the virtual surface in two dimensions and\nzoom into objects of interest. For example, as you zoom into a text object it\nmay be represented as a small dot, then a thumbnail of a page of text, then a\nfull-sized page and finally a magnified view of the page.\n\nZUIs use zooming as the main metaphor for browsing through hyperlinked or\nmultivariate information. Objects present inside a zoomed page can in turn be\nzoomed themselves to reveal further detail, allowing for recursive nesting and\nan arbitrary level of zoom.\n\nWhen the level of detail present in the resized object is changed to fit the\nrelevant information into the current size, instead of being a proportional\nview of the whole object, it's called semantic zooming.^[1]\n\nSome consider the ZUI paradigm as a flexible and realistic successor to the\ntraditional windowing GUI, being a Post-WIMP interface.^[citation needed]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nIvan Sutherland presented the first program for zooming through and creating\ngraphical structures with constraints and instancing, on a CRT in his\nSketchpad program in 1962.^[2]\n\nA more general interface was done by the Architecture Machine Group in the\n1970s at MIT. Hand tracking, touchscreen, joystick, and voice control were\nemployed to control an infinite plane of projects, documents, contacts, video\nand interactive programs. One of the instances of this project was called\nSpatial Dataland.^[3]\n\nAnother GUI environment of the 70's, which used the zooming idea was Smalltalk\nat Xerox PARC, which had infinite desktops (only later named such by Apple\nComputer), that could be zoomed in upon from a birds eye view after the user\nhad recognized a miniature of the window setup for the project.\n\nThe longest running effort to create a ZUI has been the Pad++ project begun by\nKen Perlin, Jim Hollan, and Ben Bederson at New York University and continued\nat the University of New Mexico under Hollan's direction. After Pad++,\nBederson developed Jazz, then Piccolo,^[4] and now Piccolo2D^[5] at the\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, which is maintained in Java and C#. More\nrecent ZUI efforts include Archy by the late Jef Raskin, ZVTM developed at\nINRIA (which uses the Sigma lens^[6] technique), and the simple ZUI of the\nSqueak Smalltalk programming environment and language. The term ZUI itself was\ncoined by Franklin Servan-Schreiber and Tom Grauman while they worked together\nat the Sony Research Laboratories. They were developing the first Zooming User\nInterface library based on Java 1.0, in partnership with Prof. Ben Bederson,\nUniversity of New Mexico, and Prof. Ken Perlin, New York University.\n\nGeoPhoenix, a Cambridge, MA, startup associated with the MIT Media Lab,\nfounded by Julian Orbanes, Adriana Guzman, Max Riesenhuber, released the first\nmass-marketed commercial Zoomspace in 2002\u201303 on the Sony CLI\u00c9 personal\ndigital assistant (PDA) handheld, with Ken Miura of Sony\n\nIn 2002, Pieter Muller extended the Oberon System with a zooming user\ninterface and named it Active Object System (AOS).^[7] In 2005, due to\ncopyright issues, it was renamed to Bluebottle, and in 2008, to A2.\n\nIn 2006, Hillcrest Labs introduced the HoME television navigation system, the\nfirst graphical, zooming interface for television.^[8]\n\nIn 2007, Microsoft's Live Labs released a zooming UI for web browsing called\nMicrosoft Live Labs Deepfish for the Windows Mobile 5 platform.\n\nApple's iPhone (premiered June 2007) uses a stylized form of ZUI, in which\npanning and zooming are performed through a touch user interface (TUI). A more\nfully realised ZUI is present in the iOS home screen (as of iOS 7), with\nzooming from the homescreen in to folders and finally in to apps. The photo\napp zooms out from a single photo to moments, to collections, to years, and\nsimilarly in the calendar app with day, month and year views.^[9] It is not a\nfull ZUI implementation since these operations are applied to bounded spaces\n(such as web pages or photos) and have a limited range of zooming and panning.\n\nFranklin Servan-Schreiber founded Zoomorama, based on work he did at the Sony\nResearch Laboratories in the mid-1990s. The Zooming Browser for Collage of\nHigh Resolution Images was released in Alpha in October 2007. Zoomorama's\nbrowser is all Flash-based. In 2010, project development ended, but many\nexamples are still available on the site.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, GNOME Shell used a zooming user interface for virtual\nworkspaces management.^[10] This ZUI was eventually replaced by a different,\nscrolling-based design.\n\nIn 2017, bigpictu.re offers an infinite (pan and zoom) notepad as a web\napplication based on one of the first ZUI open-source libraries.^[11]\n\nIn 2017, Zircle UI was released. It is an open source UI library that uses\nzoomable navigation and circular shapes.^[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Peter Bright. \"Hands-on with Windows 8: A PC operating system for the tablet age\".
