We spent our mornings binging on history and our afternoons\ndrinking beers in the river: a quiet, wide-mouthed expanse of cool, fresh\nwater, surrounded by grassy clusters of giant flat rocks and sandy banks.\n\nMy companions and I were in awe. Compared to the packed tourist crowds of San\nFrancisco\u2019s parks and beaches, this was positively idyllic. One guy, a local\nresident, laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go back to\nSan Francisco, tell them it was terrible.\u201d He was smiling, but his eyes said\nhe was serious.\n\nMy first reaction was to wrinkle my nose. His comment reminded me of the\nNIMBY-ish attitudes of urban dwellers who complain about newcomers moving in\nand \u201cruining\u201d their neighborhoods. I generally believe that people, interests,\nand potential kinships are unevenly distributed by geography. Cities are\nliving organisms, and changing demographics is part of what makes them\nbeautiful.\n\nPortland to San Francisco: \u201cGo back to California\u201d Via SF Gate / The Oregonian\n\nBut then I remembered that I\u2019ve made a similar argument about online\ncommunities. I enjoy poking around the weirder parts of the internet. People\ncome together over some really strange stuff, and because so many of these\nexchanges are public or semi-public, it\u2019s easy for lurkers like me to read and\nfollow along from a respectful distance.\n\nSometimes I think it\u2019d be fun to write about the things I stumble upon. There\nare so many interesting subcultures hiding in plain sight! Shouldn\u2019t I help\nmore likeminded people find each other?\n\nBut not every community wants to be found. The online equivalent of NIMBYism\nis the \u201cGET OFF MY BOARD\u201d battle cry, which comes from 4chan\u2019s /r9k/, but\nprobably summarizes the collective sentiment of a lot of hidden subcultures\nthat lurk in shallow waters, just beneath the surface.\n\n## The gates to the underworld\n\nAnyone who\u2019s made it as a regular on an internet forum has likely experienced\na form of gentle hazing, in which they are ignored, mocked, and shouted down\nbefore they eventually flee for the hills, or else stand their ground and earn\nthe respect of their peers.\n\nLike the Underworld in Greek mythology, the gates to these worlds are\ntechnically open to living souls, so long as you find a way to cross the river\nStyx. But nobody\u2019s going to make it easy for you, and that\u2019s kind of the\npoint. While these attitudes might appear exclusionary, it\u2019s the city\u2019s way of\nretaining their identity, protecting themselves from unforeseen landslides\nthat might irrevocably damage their way of life. Driving the winding mountain\nroad up to a summit can be an excruciating experience, filled with motion\nsickness and cliffhanging perils, but once you make it, the journey you\nendured feels that much more satisfying. [^2]\n\nWhile some communities haze their newcomers, others resist being defined at\nall. Ribbonfarm\u2019s Venkatesh Rao, for example, frequently downplays the term\n\u2018postrationalist\u2019 as well as the very idea of fostering a community around it,\ndespite the fact that many people are clearly attracted to the same watering\nhole. I tend to interpret this dismissiveness as a way of saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t\nwant to become a \u2018thing\u2019 because \u2018things\u2019 are destroyable by outsiders.\u201d\nAvoiding labels is a way of keeping hidden cities away from the colonizers,\nlike a nomadic tribe on the move.\n\nSome of these adaptive mechanisms are a function of size. New York City is\nenormous: it can welcome millions of tourists per year without changing its\nfundamental nature. By contrast, when I visited Reykjavik recently, it was\nclear that the 2 million tourists to Iceland per year had subsumed the\nresident population of less than 200,000. Blasting a fragile ecosystem with a\nfirehose of outsiders, even if they have good intentions, can destroy its\nessence.\n\nOnline communities are even more vulnerable to outside attention than physical\ncities, because mobility is so much easier. Visiting Iceland requires a plane\nticket and a hotel reservation; visiting an online community is just a couple\nclicks away from my bedroom.\n\n## Invisible tourism\n\nA few years ago, I spent the better part of a year sampling croissants with a\ngroup of friends, searching for the best croissant in San Francisco. (Mostly\nit was an excuse to hang out and eat delicious pastries.) When we tried the\ncroissants at a bakery called Arsicault, there was no contest. What\u2019s better,\nit was nestled away in a quiet part of the city, hidden from prying crowds.\n\nI kept going back. I was even delighted to share my discovery with a few\nappreciative friends. But then Bon Appetit published an article declaring\nArsicault one of the \u201cbest new bakeries\u201d in America, and just like that, our\nsecret was gone. For the next two years, the lines were always out the door.\nThe staff had to impose limits upon how many pastries a customer could order.\nI stopped going until the crowds subsided.\n\nThe difference between a bakery and an internet subculture is that one makes\ncroissants and the other makes ideas. As far as I can tell from public\ninformation, the press was good for Arsicault. It turns out they had only\nopened a year before, and all the public attention helped them open up a\nsecond location. More customers, under the right circumstances, means more\ncapital to expand operations. The crazy lines eventually died down to a more\nmanageable wait, too.\n\nOnline communities are different, because what they \u201cproduce\u201d (i.e. the\ncontent we read, whether public Twitter exchanges, Reddit AMAs, or forum\nthreads) is a function of the members who participate. Croissants are\npassively consumed by paying customers; nobody is jumping over the counter and\ntrying to make the croissants themselves.\n\nBut in an online community, because there aren\u2019t clear boundaries between who\nconsumes and who produces ideas, too much unwanted attention and catering to\nnewcomers can detract from, and ultimately damage, the incubative state of\nideas.\n\nWhen I was a college student traveling around Europe (and before we had\ninternet on our phones), I\u2019d observe what I called the \u201cLonely Planet effect\u201d.\nAs a backpacker, you go to the places recommended in your Lonely Planet\nguidebook, but because all the other backpackers go there too, eventually,\nthese \u201clocal\u201d recommendations become displaced by tourists. You walk into a\nrestaurant and see clusters of your tired ilk, each clutching their tattered,\nhighlighted, Lonely Planet guidebooks, trying to pretend they\u2019re having an\nauthentic experience. [^3]\n\nTourists don\u2019t go to recommended restaurants just to eat the food. They also\ngo for the experience of being somewhere local. The ambiance of the restaurant\nis at least as important as the food they pay for.\n\nIn the physical world, tourism is a rivalrous good. My presence is necessary\nfor me to \u201cconsume\u201d the experience, but it also detracts from the experience\nof others. But on the internet, you can choose whether you want to make\nyourself visible. While more people might flood online communities than\nphysical cities, it\u2019s also easier to be an invisible tourist online.\n\nWe\u2019re not used to thinking about the passive consumer experience of social\ncontent as an explicit choice, but maybe we should. You can visit an online\ncommunity, can enjoy reading through the interactions of people you might\notherwise never get to know, without interfering with their magic. You don\u2019t\nhave to become a member of that community to eat their croissants.\n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re sharing something you\u2019ve found, it\u2019s not really\npossible to tell your audience how to behave. And recommendations still move\nthrough pneumatic tubes rather than evaporation ponds. One tweet, post, or\narticle from someone with a big enough audience is like sunlight on a\nmagnifying glass, concentrating screaming hordes of people onto a single,\nunsuspecting point that spontaneously combusts into flames. I can\u2019t quite\nblame some communities for wanting to avoid press, even good press.\n\n## Finding the rate of change\n\nStill, there\u2019s a part of my brain that whines, \u201cDon\u2019t be a Luddite!\u201d Isn\u2019t the\nunpredictable rise and decline of human activity what makes communities so\ninteresting? I don\u2019t want to be a conservationist, vainly trying to save every\nendangered species, every native language, instead of embracing the boom-bust\ncycle of death and life that afflicts every living organism. Maybe the role I\nplay in that system is to make weird ideas more digestible to the public and\nspread them around more widely.\n\nI don\u2019t want to suggest that we should resist change entirely. I do think we\ncan be thoughtful about the rate of change that we introduce. I also think\nit\u2019s a choice, rather than an inevitability, to drop bombs that throw an\nentire ecosystem off-balance.\n\nThere\u2019s that classic sign in national parks that reads, \u201cTake only pictures,\nleave only footprints\u201d. Online, it\u2019s possible to be a lurker, to enjoy the\nfruits of someone else\u2019s labor without jumping in. But how do you know when to\nmove from observing to participating? When should you write about a topic,\nversus respecting a community\u2019s intentions to stay off the radar? When does\nenthusiasm cross over to exploitation? I\u2019m not sure I know the difference yet,\nbut I know that there is one.\n\n### Notes\n\n  1. Name omitted, of course, to protect the undiscovered. \u21a9\n\n  2. Lest this require clarification, I\u2019m not condoning hostility towards newcomers, but trying to understand where it comes from. I think it\u2019s possible to expect that newcomers demonstrate skin in the game, without being rude or unkind towards them. \u21a9\n\n  3. I\u2019m convinced that \u201cbackpacker culture\u201d arose not just from shared values, but out of necessity, as being forced into the same closed quarters, and traversing the same paths, creates a new meta-culture that displaces the authentic. \u21a9\n\nFor future updates, subscribe via newsletter or RSS.
