Is it because tech feels too new and not\ntimeless enough? Or because technologies often lack the autonomy or agency of\nthe Raven or the Raptor? Or even that people are just not excited about\ntechnology enough? Yes, many occupations that use technology are represented,\nsuch as brewing or drilling for oil, but only rarely are the technologies\nthemselves given as a name for a team. Well, I don\u2019t care. I want to see the\nCleveland Robots play the Kansas City Pocket Watches.\n\nIn the meantime, I have compiled a list of all of the sports teams named after\ntechnologies that I could find. For this, I am using technology necessarily\nbroadly, as any sort of human-made device or tool. Because technology is far\nmore than modern gadgets. It\u2019s not just, as Alan Kay said, provocatively and\npresumably somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that \u201ctechnology is anything that was\ninvented after you were born.\u201d\n\nPlease send me any further additions to the list. A few notes: I'm not\ncounting fire as a technology, as it's really more about harnessing it, so\nsorry Calgary Flames. There are also a bunch of minor league team edge cases\nthat I frankly don\u2019t even know how to categorize and have kept off the list.\nFor example, Lehigh Valley IronPigs (a steel raw material), Akron RubberDucks\n(this is a toy), Motor City Cruise (maybe it\u2019s a car?), and Kannapolis Cannon\nBallers (it might be referring to cannonballing into a pool?). Also, what\u2019s\nthe deal with the Detroit Red Wings? Any insights are welcome. I've also\nskipped clothing, at least for now. Note that I\u2019ve also skipped many teams\nwith similar names, like minor league affiliates with the same name their\nmajor league team.\n\n(text adapted from my essay \"Sports Teams Named for Technologies\")\n\n## Sports Teams Named After Technologies\n\nThis list is a continuing project.
