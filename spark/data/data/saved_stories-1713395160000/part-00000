It works with popular\ngame controllers, and supports cheats, save states, backups, syncing, and\nmore. As this is Testut's longtime project, it is more polished and feature\nrich than other emulators that have popped up.\n\nOther features include custom controller skins, an option to fast forward, a\n\"hold\" button for games where a button needs to be consistently held, support\nfor Haptic Touch, and appropriate box art for imported games. Local\nmultiplayer gaming is available, and up to four players can participate.\n\nEarlier this week, Apple approved iGBA, a direct copy of Testut's original\nGBA4iOS app. iGBA made it to the top of the App Store charges, but Apple\npulled it after learning that it was a knockoff.\n\nDelta can be downloaded from the App Store for free, and it does not collect\ninformation or include ads. The app is available in the United States and\nother countries, but it is not available in the European Union where it is\ninstead being offered through an alternative app marketplace.
