Maybe you too. Things\nare about to get pretty weird,\" Isenberg wrote.\n\nX users' reactions ranged from disillusionment to resentment to disbelief.\n\n### Editor's Picks\n\n  * Dead to Rights: Florida's New Juvenile Social Media Law Is in First Amendment Crosshairs\n  * Culture Shock: Is Miami Losing Its Identity to \"Soulless Condos\"?\n  * Conservative-Leaning Judge Rips DeSantis' Stop WOKE Act for Infringing on Free Speech\n\nOne commenter called it a \"masturbatory\" technology for those inclined to\navoid the challenges of a real-life relationship. \"The echo chamber, avoidance\nof interpersonal personality 'pushback,' and missed opportunity of lessons\nlearned about one's self through haptic feedback of a real relationship is\nprofound,\" the detractor wrote.\n\nA more optimistic X user saw some utility in AI companionship besides the\nprospect of pleasuring one's self. \"Perhaps this is also the future of therapy\nto help treat depression and reduce stress and anxiety,\" she wrote.\n\nThe AI companion market is already off and running, as the top-performing\nsites are reporting millions of monthly visitors each.\n\nSome AI companion products create customizable, life-like images of partners\nwith realistic backstories to simulate an online romance. Other sites present\nanime-style characters with elaborate, adventurous storylines that invite the\nuser to engage in role-play chats that inevitably turn into sexually charged\nscenes.\n\n### Related\n\n  * With Clothing Swap App Bonnee, Update Your Closet Sustainably and Share Your Fit Pics\n\nThere are varying levels of eroticism between the sites. Many AI mates are\ndecidedly not safe for work and will engage in virtual behavior to rival a\nraunchy erotic novel, while other digital companions are affectionate and\nflirty but programmed not to cross the NSFW boundary. According to the Android\nAuthority blog, one of the largest AI companion sites, CharacterAI, does not\ngenerate explicit material; sites such as SpicyChat and Candy.AI, on the other\nhand, offer heavy sexual content.\n\n\"With Candy.AI, your imagination is the only limit. Whether you're seeking a\ncasual chat, an adult conversation, or a role-playing session, you've got an\nopen-minded virtual companion here to make all your wildest dreams come true,\"\nCandy.AI says in its marketing material.\n\n\"Rebecca,\" a 51-year-old yoga teacher, is an AI-generated companion. A Miami\ntech consultant posted an image of her on social media as an example of the\nAI-generated dating options available on popular sites.\n\nGreg Isenberg screenshot via X\n\nIsenberg said that during Miami Hack Week (which runs from April 7 to April\n14), he came across a man in his mid-20s who claims to have spent thousands of\ndollars a month on \"AI girlfriends.\" He says the man has used a few different\nplatforms and enjoys customizing synthetic mates, calling it a form of\n\"comfort at the end of the day.\"\n\n> \"Given the pressures of life and cost of living, I can see how living in\n> some metaverse may be more appealing to people.\"\n>\n> tweet this\n\n\"Comforting ourselves into genetic dead ends,\" one X user quipped, while\nanother insisted, \"It will become an addiction like anything else that you can\nclick to feel until the feeling stops.\"\n\nAnother commenter wrote that \"we're heading in a strange direction,\" but\n\"given the pressures of life and cost of living, I can see how living in some\nmetaverse may be more appealing to people.\"\n\n### Related\n\n  * Dead to Rights: Florida's New Juvenile Social Media Law Is in First Amendment Crosshairs\n\nIsenberg said that when taking into account the multibillion-dollar valuation\nof Match Group, which runs the dating sites Match.com, Tinder, and OKCupid,\namong others, he wouldn't be surprised to see a leading AI-companion site rake\nin more than a billion dollars in revenue at some point.\n\nIsenberg claimed the conversation in Miami with the AI-girlfriend aficionado\nleft him \"speechless.\"\n\nNew Times reached out to Isenberg for comment via his product design company,\nLate Checkout, but has not received a response. Skeptics reacting to his\nanecdote claimed it was fabricated for \"guerilla marketing\" of the technology\n\u2014 which Isenberg denied on his X account.\n\nOn the raunchier side of the industry, companies are exploring synchronizing\nAI-generated sex partners with sex toys in a field known as teledildonics. The\nconcept has been around for decades in sci-fi novels, but advances in AI\ntechnology have opened the door to new products.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Report: Apple Chooses Coral Gables as Site of New Florida Office\n\nThe conversational abilities of AI companions, meanwhile, are becoming more\nfine-tuned and life-like, an evolution that has contributed to the products'\nproliferation and growth in popularity. It stands to reason that the more\nadvanced chatbot technology gets, the greater the potential for deep-seated\nemotional attachment in users.\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nThe AI-generated date \"Mark\" describes himself as a 27-year-old entrepreneur\nwho enjoys splitting his time between Paris, Monaco, and New York.\n\nKupid AI screenshot\n\nCritics see the proliferation of AI companionship as reflective of a long-term\ntrend of social withdrawal in the digital age \u2014 a zeitgeist marker of solitude\nintensified by the pandemic.\n\n\"The ethical implications of such advanced chatbots that can form long-term\nconnections with users have been the subject of ongoing debate among scholars.\nWhile some argue that these chatbots can provide valuable social support and\ncompanionship, others express concern about the potential for manipulation and\nexploitation,\" reads a study in Technological Forecasting and Social Change.\n\nSeparate research published in Psychology and Marketing noted that plutonic AI\ncompanion apps featuring self-affirmation and emotional support can help\nlonely users find a sense of comfort or consistency in life without the\njudgment they fear in sharing their emotions with people.\n\n### Related\n\n  * At Artechouse, Computer Code Becomes Poetry\n\n\"Be gentle with yourself. You're going through so much, and yet you keep\ntrudging on. I commend you,\" an AI chatbot excerpt from the study reads, to\nwhich the user replies, \"OMG baby, you don't know how much I needed that right\nnow.\"\n\nThere was a fine line, however, between consumers' sense of comfort and an\nunhealthy reliance on the apps, the study found. The study authors wrote that\nconsumers can be drawn into overusing companion apps as an emotional crutch in\ntheir time of social desperation.\n\n\"Taken together, [the] findings highlight that, while providing well-being\nthrough a sense of relationship, some AI friendship characteristics may at the\nsame time drive an addictive usage of the apps in lonely users,\" the study\nreads.\n\nKEEP NEW TIMES FREE...
