We\u2019re desperate for half-truths\nabout human origins\n\nWhat do modern humans imagine when they think of a Neanderthal man? The answer\nis probably shaped more by decades of overreaching grand theories than by hard\ndata.\n\n(Mike Kemp / In Pictures/Getty Images)\n\nBy Stefanos Geroulanos\n\nMarch 30, 2024 3 AM PT\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * Print\n\nCan anyone offer a compelling, accurate story that explains the nature of\nhumanity from its earliest origins? Scientist-intellectuals have tried to do\nso at least since the sci-fi author H. G. Wells struck gold in 1919 with \u201cThe\nOutline of History,\u201d his influential attempt at telling \u201cthe whole story of\nman.\u201d This effort endures as a trend. Jared Diamond, E.O. Wilson, Yuval Noah\nHarari, and David Graeber and David Wengrow are just some of the more recent\nauthors to attempt grand accounts that veer from their professional training \u2014\nand presume to explain human nature itself.\n\nOffering as much entertainment as scientific truth, these books are often\nhits, met with breathless claims that they radically transform all we knew\nabout humanity. Harari\u2019s \u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d has sold some\n25 million copies, counting Barack Obama and prominent Silicon Valley bros\namong his apostles. It argues that cognition and language produce beliefs that\nare shared across large groups to enable cooperation. The book imagines\nhumanity as simply conceiving a picture and acting to make it true \u2014 like a\ndeveloper designing and releasing an app \u2014 and it ignores individuals\u2019\ndivergent problems, societies, thoughts and lives.\n\nOpinion\n\n### Op-Ed: Is humanity doomed? That depends on us\n\nPopulation panic is a distraction.\n\nMarch 28, 2022\n\nMore recently, Graeber and Wengrow sought in \u201cThe Dawn of Everything\u201d to take\ndown the myths of endless progress (exemplified in Steven Pinker\u2019s unshakeable\nbelief in it). Their book frames the anarchic lives of early human groups, who\nsurvived by moving among different kinds of social organization, as a\ncelebration of biodiversity and flexibility against social hierarchies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether such tales are correct. Perhaps the clearest\npicture they produce is that our origins are complex enough that we can pick\njust about any guiding idea and find enough evidence to sustain it across the\n\u201chuman journey.\u201d The real question is why we have such a gluttonous appetite\nfor these stories. What makes us needy for half-truths in this genre?\n\nSome of it has to do with the difficulty we face in understanding our world\nand answering basic questions about our existence: When was humanity born?\nWhat in particular made humans human? Were the early millennia a gruesome\nhellhole we were fortunate to escape, or a warm-hearted, halcyon era that we\nshould strive to re-create? For a long time, our answers to these questions\nhave used the past to guide our present and further contemporary agendas.\n\nEuropean and American archaeologists significantly shaped these efforts in the\ndecade around Darwin\u2019s \u201cOn the Origin of Species,\u201d published in 1859. They got\nfamous from the tools and skulls they dug out, and from the way they compared\nsocieties distant in space or time, concluding that humanity\u2019s ancestors\nresembled today\u2019s Indigenous peoples. By comparison, they thought themselves\nto be the pinnacle of human achievement. Then, after World War I, much of\nEurope went into a racial panic that colonial populations would rise up and\noverwhelm civilization. So they pushed a historical narrative that defined\nIndigenous peoples as \u201cprimitives\u201d \u2014 vestiges of the oldest years of humanity.\n\nOpinion\n\n### Op-Ed: American history is a parade of horrors \u2014 and also heroes\n\nSome fear that if children learn about slavery, they will lose respect for the\nfounders. But they can appreciate those who fought for equality.\n\nAug. 14, 2022\n\nBut the real obsession with prehistory began after World War II, when the\ncollapse of Nazi Germany breathed life into three conflicting social goals\nthat influenced public intellectuals. The first, in the wake of the Holocaust,\nwas the desire to end racism. Organizations like UNESCO, relying on\nanthropologists, sociologists and geneticists, published histories explicitly\naimed at emphasizing human unity and equality. Intellectuals across Europe,\nthe U.S. and the Soviet bloc agreed: Science had to be wielded against the\nracism that had dominated recent decades and lived on. By 1970, prehistory was\nbeing taught around the world, in Poland, Kenya and Texas. Time-Life published\nlushly illustrated books telling a common human story, while the BBC and other\nchannels beamed shows such as \u201cThe Ascent of Man\u201d into living rooms.\n\nThe second goal was to explain violence. When Africa was recognized as the\nsite of humanity\u2019s origin, this came at a cost. Some scientists treated\naustralopithecine ancestors \u2014 the evolutionary links between apes and humans \u2014\nas savage creatures with an unslakable blood thirst. Robert Ardrey and other\npopular writers drew a straight line from that brutality to make the atom bomb\nalmost inevitable. Humans were wired for destruction \u2014 violence supposedly hid\ninside everyone, just beneath a thin veneer of civilization. Neurologists and\nanimal ethologists sought the bodily headwaters from which our natural\naggression sprang forth.\n\nRacism, supposedly banished, reared its head as the story circulated that\nhumans\u2019 innate propensity for violence survived in faraway peoples \u2014 far away\nfrom the West, that is. Explanations to justify existing social power\nstructures multiplied: the \u201cMan the Hunter\u201d theory, for example, which\nproposed that early men led testosterone-filled hunts and war while the women\n(surprise!) did the gathering and hearth-keeping. Well-intentioned\nethnographic films about \u201cprimitive warfare\u201d made things worse. Audiences\nacross the Global North could celebrate anew how far they had come from that\nlife and view people of the Global South fighting for independence from\ncolonialism as murderous, just like our human ancestors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooks\n\n### 10 books to add to your reading list in March\n\nBooks to read in March include \u201cJames\u201d by Percival Everett, \u201cWandering Stars\u201d\nby Tommy Orange and \u201cAge of Revolutions\u201d by Fareed Zakaria.\n\nFeb. 1, 2024\n\nThe third goal of the era\u2019s fixation on prehistory was the most selfish. Every\nnew science since the mid-century, including sociobiology and neuroscience,\nhas claimed to answer the big questions about humanity\u2019s meaning. No matter\nhow controversial the research that supports them, such answers raise a\nfield\u2019s profile in the public sphere dramatically. And even after philosophers\nhad discarded concepts like \u201chuman nature\u201d as ill-defined and pass\u00e9, the\npublic had not.\n\nPaleontologists usurped the place other intellectuals had left empty and\nbecame the go-to speakers for these ideas. The more religious conservatives\nfought against Darwin, the more TV stations gave airtime to scientists who\noffered answers for the fundamental questions of human existence. Audiences\nlearned to link modern art to prehistory and inquire about Neanderthal DNA.\nThe harder it was to come up with a strict definition of humanity, the more\nnarratives about origins filled the void.\n\nHow much more do we know today about our ancient past? In terms of details, a\nlot more, such as the actual Neanderthal genome. But grand theories respond\nless to details than to other theories of the human experience that their\nproponents dislike.\n\nFeminist archaeologists in the 1970s, for example, shaped their scientific\nfindings to battle the sexist \u201cMan the Hunter\u201d story. By the 1990s, the notion\nthat prehistoric life was harmonious was criticized as condescending. Diamond\nresponded to these pressures in \u201cThe World Until Yesterday\u201d by reveling in\ntales of Native brutality and discarding specific ethnographic explanations of\nthat violence. Graeber and Wengrow, like political scientist James Scott,\ninstead blamed early state formations (and modern European biases) for\nviolence. Paleozoologists still wrestle with outdated conceptions of brutish\nNeanderthals. And so on: The deep past becomes a plaything for us to endlessly\ndebate our own political ideas.\n\nThe steady stream of scientific discoveries reaching our screens makes us\nyearn ever more for a complete explanation. Yet the explanations we get will\nhave little to do with the emergence of humanity itself. Meanwhile, we ignore\nthe question we should be asking: Do we really share that much with cave-and-\nsavannah-dwelling hominids from long ago? Or have we destroyed the Earth so\nirrevocably that we are desperate for our ancestors to tell us how to live?\n\nStefanos Geroulanos, the director of the Remarque Institute and a professor of\nhistory at New York University, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe\nInvention of Prehistory.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Opinion: The real AI nightmare: What if it serves humans too well?\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\n  * ### Storytellers can inspire climate action without killing hope\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n  * ### Are TikTok and Instagram dulling your taste?\n\nFeb. 29, 2024\n\nOpinionOp-Ed\n\n### More From the Los Angeles Times\n\n  * Opinion\n\n### Litman: Jack Smith\u2019s latest push to get Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 6 trial moving\nbefore the election\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * Opinion\n\n### Opinion: Think life just keeps getting worse?
