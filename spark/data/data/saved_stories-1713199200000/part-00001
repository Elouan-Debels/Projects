It survives by\nobtaining sugar through the connections between its roots and those of\nneighboring normal redwood(s), usually the parent tree from whose base it has\nsprouted.^[1]^[2]^[3] Sap exchange through roots is a general phenomenon among\nredwoods.^[4] About 400 are known.^[4] They can be found in Henry Cowell\nRedwoods State Park, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, San Francisco Botanical\nGarden, Huddart Park, and The Santa Lucia Preserve,^[5] with eleven trees in\nthe first.^[4] The exact locations are not publicized to protect the rare\ntrees.^[6] They reach a maximum height of about 20 m (66 ft).^[1] Other\nconifers lack the ability to graft their roots, so 'albino' mutants of other\nspecies do not survive to become sizable trees.^[1]\n\nThe trees were important to Native Americans and were recorded in their\nlegends. For example, the Pomo people used them in their cleansing\nceremonies.^[7]\n\nAlbino redwoods are generally regarded as parasitic plants, but as of 2016 one\nresearcher speculates that they are supported by other trees for their role in\nstoring toxic heavy metals. Albinos apparently accumulate more metals than\nnormal trees because of defective stomata, which cause them to lose more water\nthrough transpiration, forcing them to compensate by taking up more water\nthrough their roots.^[4]\n\nSix phenotypes of albino redwood have been classified: white, bright yellow,\ncellular virescent green, pale green, mottled and nonchimeric variegated. Such\nmutants can be either basal (growing from a burl at the base of a tree) or\naerial (branching off from a tree above the ground). The bright yellow form is\nexclusively aerial and is thought to be associated with excess xanthophyll\nproduction. The pale green form lacks just one specific type of chlorophyll\nand is almost always basal. Cellular virescent green trees have a few normal\ncells (whose abundance may vary over time) interspersed among the mutant\ncells.^[8]\n\nTen cases are known of chimeric redwoods that have a mosaic of albino and\nnormal tissues.^[9] Only a single chimeric redwood is known to produce cones.\nFormerly threatened by the Sonoma\u2013Marin Area Rail Transit rail\ndevelopment,^[10] it has since been replanted.^[11]\n\nThree phenotypes of chimeric redwoods have been noted: sectorial, mericlinal\nand periclinal. In sectorial mutants, albino cells are present vertically\nthrough all cell layers, with genotype boundaries usually parallel to the\nstem. Mericlinal trees have mutant cells in only some cell layers and have an\nunstable phenotype; the albino cells can disappear and reappear in successive\nyears. A periclinal chimera has both mutant and normal cells distributed\nhorizontally across the tip of each bud propagating at equal rates, leading to\na very stable phenotype.^[12]\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n  * An 'albino' redwood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, northern California\n\n  * Another example in Humboldt Redwoods State Park\n\n  * Albino foliage in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California\n\n  * Example in the Santa Cruz Mountains\n\n  * Example of an Albino Redwood tree in Montgomery Redwood State Reserve\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Albinism is defined in various ways; see Albinism in biology\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Stienstra, T.
