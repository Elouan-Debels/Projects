Creating and running\nflows is great. The visuals, the feedback loop, the almost lincoln-log-esque\nsense of operating something in real, tangible space. Something that can be\nsorely missing for a builder. But when that's all said and done\n\nJan 22, 2024 3 min read\n\nFeatured\n\n## Icons, Minimize, Pin, Tabs as Blocks...

Event Chains, Board Subscriptions \ud83d\udc40\n\nFlow integrations continue... I was going to save \"ETL stuff\" for after\nrelease as an add-on, until I realized that I can instead make it a hackable\nvisual blueprints play that can read & write to any part of the sys (actions,\nscripts, mutate client UI, cross-client, sub-flows.\n\nJan 10, 2024 1 min read\n\nTweets Featured\n\n## Adding \"flows\" into the mix...\n\nYou knew it was coming eventually... I've been chasing this idea for several\nyears of a \"unified\" prezi/logic interface (all flow-based), while very cool,\nit isn't always practical for day to day data work AND prod dashboarding.\nBetter?

Snapshots!\n\nTake a snapshot of the state of all parameters, sizes, locations - and then\nswap between them like dashboard tabs.

Yes.\n\nThat about explains it. ;) Dragging a compatible already-made viz on to a grid\nand watch it \"weave by dimension X\"... Experimenting a bit.

Things are getting interesting! Drill-\ndown / drill \"through\". Any aggregate can be reduced to it's base group-bys,\neven hopping down though nested sub-queries if need be.
