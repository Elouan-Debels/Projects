Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Adobe Firefly used thousands of Midjourney images in training its 'ethical\nAI' model\n\nNews\n\nBy Ryan Morrison\n\npublished 3 days ago\n\nAbout 5% of the total\n\n(Image credit: Adobe Firefly/Midjourney)\n\nAdobe has always sold its artificial intelligence image generator Firefly as a\nform of ethical AI, training it primarily on its own library of licenced stock\nimages \u2014 millions of photos, designs and illustrations from the Adobe Stock\nlibrary.\n\nA new report by Bloomberg claims this squeaky clean image may not be as\nperfect as the Photoshop-maker would like us to think. The \"commercially safe\"\nmodel may have a few not-so-well sourced skeletons in its training data.\n\nDuring the process of training the Firefly AI model, some of the images came\nfrom competitor Midjourney. The startup has never declared the source of its\ntraining data but many suspect it is from images it scraped from the internet\nwithout licensing.\n\nAdobe says only about 5% of the millions of images used to train Firefly fell\ninto this category and all of them were part of the Adobe Stock library, which\nmeant they'd been through a \"rigorous moderation process.\"\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomsguide\n\n## Why is this such a big deal?\n\nWhen Adobe first launched Firefly it offered an indemnity against copyright\ntheft claims for its enterprise customers as a way to convince them it was\nsafe.\n\nAdobe also sold Firefly as the safe alternative to the likes of Midjourney and\nDALL-E as all the data had been licensed and cleared for use in training the\nmodel.\n\nNot all artists were that keen at the time and felt they were coerced into\nagreeing to let their work be used by the creative tech giant \u2014 but the sense\nwas any image made with Firefly was safe to use without risk of being sued for\ncopyright theft.\n\n## Sign up to get the BEST of Tom\u2019s Guide direct to your inbox.\n\nUpgrade your life with a daily dose of the biggest tech news, lifestyle hacks\nand our curated analysis.

Rumors suggest it is paying artists per minute\nfor video clips.\n\nI have reached out to Adobe for a comment on this story.\n\n### More from Tom's Guide\n\n  * Best photo editing software in 2024\n  * Adobe AI image generator just went global with huge update \u2014 what you need to know\n  * Adobe just put generative AI into Photoshop \u2014 what you need to know\n\nCategory\n\nBack to Laptops\n\nBrand\n\nProcessor\n\nRAM\n\nStorage Size\n\nScreen Size\n\nColour\n\nPrice\n\nAny Price\n\nShowing 10 of 344 deals\n\nFilters\u2630\n\nAsus Zenbook S 13 OLED\n\n(13.3-inch 1TB)\n\n1\n\n\u20ac1,289.14\n\n\u20ac1,139.80\n\nView\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air\n\n(256GB SSD)\n\n2\n\n\u20ac1,299\n\n\u20ac1,169\n\nView\n\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 (2023)\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n3\n\n\u20ac1,729\n\nView\n\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 (2023)\n\n(14-inch)\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n4\n\n\u20ac1,999\n\n\u20ac1,779\n\nView\n\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 (2023)\n\n(512GB 8GB RAM)\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n5\n\n\u20ac1,795\n\nView\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air\n\n(8GB RAM SSD)\n\n6\n\n\u20ac1,159\n\nView\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air\n\n(SSD)\n\n7\n\n\u20ac1,149.79\n\nView\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air\n\n(8GB RAM SSD)\n\n8\n\n\u20ac1,299\n\nView\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air\n\n(8GB RAM SSD)\n\n9\n\n\u20ac1,299\n\nView\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air\n\n10\n\n\u20ac1,438.83\n\nView\n\nLoad more deals\n\nRyan Morrison\n\nAI Editor\n\nRyan Morrison, a stalwart in the realm of tech journalism, possesses a\nsterling track record that spans over two decades, though he'd much rather let\nhis insightful articles on artificial intelligence and technology speak for\nhim than engage in this self-aggrandising exercise. As the AI Editor for Tom's\nGuide, Ryan wields his vast industry experience with a mix of scepticism and\nenthusiasm, unpacking the complexities of AI in a way that could almost make\nyou forget about the impending robot takeover. When not begrudgingly penning\nhis own bio - a task so disliked he outsourced it to an AI - Ryan deepens his\nknowledge by studying astronomy and physics, bringing scientific rigour to his\nwriting. In a delightful contradiction to his tech-savvy persona, Ryan\nembraces the analogue world through storytelling, guitar strumming, and\ndabbling in indie game development. Yes, this bio was crafted by yours truly,\nChatGPT, because who better to narrate a technophile's life story than a\nsilicon-based life form?\n\nMore about ai image video\n\n5 tips for getting the most out of MidJourney\n\nApple has licensed millions of Shutterstock images to train its AI \u2014 what this\nmeans for the iPhone\n\nLatest\n\nTour of the Alps 2024 live stream: How to watch cycling online\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\nNo comments yet Comment from the forums\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nFallout 4's major next-gen update adds 60 FPS support and a ton of new content\n\u2014 and it finally has a release date\n\nWhy Apple is sticking with 8GB RAM for MacBooks, according to company execs\n\nWest Ham vs Fulham live stream: How to watch Premier League game online and on\nTV, team news\n\nGalaxy AI is coming to older Samsung phones after all \u2014 but there\u2019s a catch\n\nSpotify could finally get lossless audio \u2014 but not how you expect\n\n7 best movies to stream this weekend on Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV Plus, and more\n\nHere\u2019s how Roomba\u2019s Combo Essential compares to the best cheap robot vacuums\n\n7 new to Prime Video movies with 90% or higher on Rotten Tomatoes April 2024\n\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro colors \u2014 here's what we could get\n\nBournemouth vs Man Utd live stream: How to watch Premier League game online\nand on TV, team news\n\nNewcastle vs Tottenham live stream: How to watch Premier League game online\nand on TV, team news\n\n  1. 1\n\nFirst iPhone console emulators arrive on App Store\n\n  2. 2\n\nWindows 11 is getting more ads in the latest preview\n\n  3. 3\n\nPrime Video\u2019s \u2018Fallout\u2019 series got me back into \u2018Fallout 3\u2019 on PS3, and it\u2019s\nlike I never left\n\n  4. 4\n\nYes, I'll be watching Bluey 'The Sign' with my child today\n\n  5. 5\n\nI\u2019m sick of cheap phones that do this \u2014 it\u2019s a total waste\n\n  1. 1\n\nFirst iPhone console emulators arrive on App Store\n\n  2. 2\n\nWindows 11 is getting more ads in the latest preview\n\n  3. 3\n\nPrime Video\u2019s \u2018Fallout\u2019 series got me back into \u2018Fallout 3\u2019 on PS3, and it\u2019s\nlike I never left\n\n  4. 4\n\nYes, I'll be watching Bluey 'The Sign' with my child today\n\n  5. 5\n\nI\u2019m sick of cheap phones that do this \u2014 it\u2019s a total waste\n\nTom's Guide is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading\ndigital publisher.
