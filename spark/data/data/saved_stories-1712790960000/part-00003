They should be able to work\nremotely, either as someone self-employed or in collaboration with or as an\nemployee of a company.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut it's not as simple as showing up with your luggage and laptop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisa applicants must earn three times the minimum level required for exemption\nfrom participation in healthcare costs. That comes out to just under \u20ac28,000\nannually or about $30,400.\n\nFurther requirements include health insurance coverage for the duration of\nyour stay, proof of accommodation, and candidates will have to show they've\nbeen a remote worker elsewhere for at least six months or a digital nomad for\nthe same period of time.\n\nAnd while the digital nomad visa is only good for one year, it can be renewed\n\u2014 and your family can be included.\n\nYou may, however, get rejected if you've been convicted of a crime in the last\nfive years, Euronews said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's the latest effort from Italy to encourage growth. For a while now, aging\nItalian towns have offered their homes up for just one euro in an effort to\ncurb underpopulation. The deal attracted foreigners who took advantage of the\nfixer-uppers.\n\nStill, elsewhere in Europe, several countries are rolling back their \"golden\nvisas\" that once allowed outsiders to obtain residency permits after investing\nover $500,000 in real estate.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Migrants who died in Italy shipwreck paid 8,000 euros each\n\nItaly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
