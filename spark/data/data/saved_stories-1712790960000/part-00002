Nap\u2019s declarative YAML\nformat means you can check your tests into source control to share them with\nyour team.\n\nRun locally or integrate with your favorite CI/CD tool.\n\nNap compiles cross-platform to a single executable file. Run in Windows, Linux\nor Mac OS with ease.\n\nGet Started View on Github\n\nNap is a command-line interface (CLI) for running HTTP requests using YAML\nfiles with a clear, concise syntax. You can write routines, requests and even\nlimited scripts using your favorite text editor. You can then check those\nfiles into source control and intregate Nap with your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nBrowse the docs to learn more about how Nap can save you and your customers\ntime and frustration with better, faster test automation.\n\n## Why Nap?\n\nHere are just a few of the reasons our users enjoy Nap:\n\n  * REMARKABLE SPEED. Nap is able to break apart your test suite and run different parts of it at the same time. Even large-scale workloads only take about as long as your slowest scenario.\n  * SIMPLIFIED SYNTAX. With Nap, there\u2019s no need to memorize a bunch of cURL flags or open a big fancy editor to design your tests. Each request is a single, compact file.\n  * VERSATILE EXPRESSIONS. Write your tests in expressions that make sense at first glance. Asserts, variable captures and even explicit javascript are all at your disposal.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere are two ways to get started using Nap.\n\n### Download\n\nYou can download directly from the dist folder on Github, or use one of the\nquick download buttons:\n\nDownload for Windows (x64) - v0.4.8 Other Platforms (View All)\n\nOnce downloaded, add nap\u2019s location into your $PATH for convenience.\n\n### Using Go\n\nIf you already have the Go language installed, simply run the command to\ninstall nap:\n\n    \n    \n    $ go install github.com/davesheldon/nap@latest\n\nOnce you have Nap installed, go read about The Basics to start writing your\nfirst test.\n\n## Credits\n\nNap was heavily inspired by another HTTP CLI project called Hurl. If you don\u2019t\nfind Nap useful, you may like Hurl instead.\n\nBack to top\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Dave Sheldon\n\n", "frontpage": false}
