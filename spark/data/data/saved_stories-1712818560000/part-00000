Despite its importance, water quality is not\nguaranteed and varies considerably throughout the world's countries,\ninfluenced by natural and man-made factors.\n\nMeasuring the safety of the drinking water in each area of a country is\nvitally important, as it helps that country determine where to focus its\nefforts in order to ensure the long-term health of its citizens and the\nsustainability of its water supply.\n\n## How is the safety of drinking water determined?\n\nLocalized testing is the most common method of determining the safety of a\nregion's drinking water. In developed countries, testing may be conducted by\nthe water utilities or by various local, state, or federal agencies. In\ndeveloping and least-developed countries, testing may be much less consistent\nand reliable.\n\nOne of the most widely respected aggregators of water quality data is Yale\nUniversity's Environmental Performance Index, which tracks 40 performance\nindicators\u2014including \"Sanitation & Drinking Water\"\u2014in order to pinpoint the\nmost environmentally friendly countries in the world. Additional performance\nindicators tracked by the EPI include environmental health, climate change\nmitigation, air quality, waste management, biodiversity, fishery populations,\nand more.\n\n## How is water quality rated?\n\nThe EPI measures water quality in terms of \"age-standardized disability-\nadjusted life-years lost per 100,000 persons (DALY rate) due to exposure to\nunsafe drinking water\" (EPI). According to the DALY scale, a score of 100\nindicates countries with the purest and least-contaminated water and a score\nof 0 indicates the 5% of countries with the most contaminated water on the\nplanet.\n\n## Top 10 Countries with the Best Water Quality in the World (2022 DALY\nscore):\n\nCountry| EPI Score  \n---|---  \nUnited Kingdom| 100  \nNetherlands| 100  \nGreece| 100  \nAustria| 100  \nSwitzerland| 100  \nFinland| 100  \nNorway| 100  \nIreland| 100  \nMalta| 100  \nIceland| 100  \n  \n## 10 Countries with the Worst Water Quality in the World (2022 DALY score):\n\nCountry| EPI Score  \n---|---  \nNiger| 1.7  \nNigeria| 4.3  \nTogo| 4.9  \nBurundi| 5.4  \nMadagascar| 6.2  \nEritrea| 6.4  \nGuinea Bissau| 6.6  \nLesotho| 7.2  \nCameroon| 7.5  \nBurkina Faso| 7.9  \n  \n#### Source\n\nThe countries that the EPI has ranked top 10 in terms of clean water can\ndeviate from each other by as much as a 5th percentile in this regard. This is\nbecause an EPI score of 100 means a country is in the best 5th percentile. A\nsimilar yet converse observation can be made about the lowest ranking 10\ncountries.\n\n  * Drinking water quality is measured as part of the annual Environmental Performance Index (EPI). Higher scores indicate higher water quality.\n\nCSV JSON\n\n### Download Table Data\n\nCountry| EPI Score  \n---|---  \nUnited Kingdom| 100  \nNetherlands| 100  \nGreece| 100  \nAustria| 100  \nSwitzerland| 100  \nFinland| 100  \nNorway| 100  \nIreland| 100  \nMalta| 100  \nIceland| 100  \nGermany| 98.6  \nSweden| 97.9  \nItaly| 97.8  \nLuxembourg| 97.8  \nDenmark| 95.8  \nSpain| 94.8  \nFrance| 93.8  \nIsrael| 93.8  \nBelgium| 93  \nJapan| 91.8  \nCyprus| 91.7  \nCanada| 90.9  \nUnited States| 89.3  \nSingapore| 88.9  \nPortugal| 85.7  \nSouth Korea| 84.6  \nAustralia| 81.2  \nBrunei| 79.9  \nNew Zealand| 74.5  \nSlovenia| 70.3  \nTaiwan| 67.2  \nChile| 66.8  \nPoland| 65.7  \nCzech Republic| 65.2  \nSlovakia| 64.6  \nMauritius| 63.6  \nCroatia| 63.3  \nUruguay| 61.8  \nArmenia| 61.7  \nBelarus| 60.7  \nHungary| 60.6  \nSerbia| 60.5  \nArgentina| 59.5  \nEstonia| 59.2  \nChina| 58.4  \nNorth Macedonia| 58.3  \nBulgaria| 58  \nLatvia| 57.7  \nLithuania| 57.4  \nBosnia and Herzegovina| 57.3  \nKuwait| 57.2  \nQatar| 57  \nMontenegro| 56.8  \nKazakhstan| 56  \nRussia| 55.8  \nRomania| 55.4  \nCosta Rica| 55.3  \nUkraine| 55.1  \nJordan| 54.4  \nUzbekistan| 54  \nGeorgia| 52.3  \nUnited Arab Emirates| 51.7  \nSaudi Arabia| 51  \nVietnam| 50.9  \nMoldova| 50.8  \nAlbania| 50.3  \nColombia| 50.1  \nMexico| 50  \nAlgeria| 49.1  \nTunisia| 49.1  \nIran| 48.8  \nTrinidad and Tobago| 48.5  \nMalaysia| 48.2  \nBahamas| 47.8  \nBarbados| 47.8  \nTurkmenistan| 47.7  \nKyrgyzstan| 47.3  \nJamaica| 47.3  \nTurkey| 47  \nLebanon| 46.8  \nSri Lanka| 46.7  \nEcuador| 46.7  \nAzerbaijan| 46.5  \nOman| 46.5  \nCuba| 46  \nIraq| 45.9  \nSeychelles| 45.8  \nBrazil| 45.2  \nParaguay| 45.2  \nAntigua and Barbuda| 45.2  \nGrenada| 44.4  \nMaldives| 44.2  \nMongolia| 43.8  \nVenezuela| 43.6  \nDominica| 43.5  \nPeru| 42.8  \nTonga| 42.8  \nThailand| 42.7  \nNicaragua| 42.2  \nSaint Lucia| 42.2  \nPanama| 41.7  \nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines| 41.1  \nEl Salvador| 40.8  \nSamoa| 40.4  \nBelize| 39.6  \nBolivia| 38.5  \nEgypt| 36.7  \nMorocco| 36.7  \nSuriname| 35.4  \nDominican Republic| 35.2  \nCape Verde| 34.5  \nPhilippines| 34.4  \nSao Tome and Principe| 34.1  \nCambodia| 33.3  \nMicronesia| 33  \nGuyana| 32.6  \nFiji| 32  \nTajikistan| 31.7  \nBhutan| 31.5  \nHonduras| 30.9  \nMarshall Islands| 30.3  \nMyanmar| 30  \nEquatorial Guinea| 29.6  \nAfghanistan| 27.8  \nGuatemala| 27.2  \nGabon| 27.2  \nBangladesh| 26.9  \nTimor Leste| 26.2  \nLaos| 26.1  \nNepal| 25.9  \nIndonesia| 24.9  \nSouth Africa| 23.4  \nSudan| 22.6  \nVanuatu| 21.4  \nGhana| 20.4  \nBotswana| 20.2  \nBahrain| 20.1  \nGambia| 19  \nNamibia| 18.9  \nTanzania| 18.4  \nIndia| 18.3  \nDjibouti| 18.2  \nUganda| 17.7  \nIvory Coast| 17  \nRwanda| 17  \nMozambique| 16.5  \nZimbabwe| 16.2  \nPapua New Guinea| 15.8  \nKiribati| 15.6  \nComoros| 15.4  \nPakistan| 15.3  \nRepublic of the Congo| 14.5  \nSolomon Islands| 14.4  \nHaiti| 13.9  \nKenya| 13.7  \nBenin| 13.6  \nMauritania| 13.6  \nDR Congo| 13.4  \nZambia| 13.2  \nSenegal| 13  \nEswatini| 12.2  \nMalawi| 12.1  \nAngola| 12  \nSierra Leone| 11.6  \nEthiopia| 11.3  \nGuinea| 11  \nLiberia| 9.5  \nMali| 8.3  \nBurkina Faso| 7.9  \nCameroon| 7.5  \nLesotho| 7.2  \nGuinea Bissau| 6.6  \nEritrea| 6.4  \nMadagascar| 6.2  \nBurundi| 5.4  \nTogo| 4.9  \nNigeria| 4.3  \nNiger| 1.7  \n  \nshowing: 178 rows\n\n### Which country has the best water quality in the world?\n\nAustria, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Netherlands, Norway,\nSwitzerland, and the United Kingdom are tied for the top spot, boasting the\ncleanest water in the world.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n  1.
