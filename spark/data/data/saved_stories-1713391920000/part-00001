GQL is a new language for graph databases, like SQL is\nfor relational databases.\n\nHere is the link to it on the ISO web site:\n\n  * ISO/IEC 39075:2024\n\nThis is the culmination of work that has been going on formally within ISO\nsince 2019 and for several years more before that in preparation. (There was\neven a manifesto! How can you go wrong?)\n\nI suppose this doesn\u2019t affect my usual work with PostgreSQL and SQL much. But\nhaving a new database language to work on in the same ISO working group that\ndeals with SQL has definitely created new energy and injected new ideas into\nthe process. Some of the new functionality in SQL:2023 was influenced by or\nintentionally shared with GQL, such as the SQL/PGQ sublanguage, and also less\nobvious things like this. I expect more synergies like that in the future.\n\nNow, I wish graph database vendors good fortunes in implementing all this. \ud83d\ude09\n\n## Peter Eisentraut\n\n  * Peter Eisentraut\n  * peter@eisentraut.org\n\n  * petere\n  * petereisentraut\n\nPeter Eisentraut's blog\n\n", "frontpage": false}
