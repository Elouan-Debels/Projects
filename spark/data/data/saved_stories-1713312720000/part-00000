Is it cool if\nI crash at your place?\" Response: \u201cYes\u201c or \u201cno\u201d.\n\nGuess culture: \"Hey, great news! I'll be in town this weekend for a business\ntrip!\" Response: Infer that they might be telling you this because they want\nsomething from you, conclude that they might want a place to stay, and offer\nyour hospitality only if you want to. Otherwise, pretend you didn\u2019t infer\nthat.\n\nThe two basic rules of Ask Culture: 1) Ask when you want something. 2)\nInterpret things as requests and feel free to say \"no\".\n\nThe two basic rules of Guess Culture: 1) Ask for things if, and *only* if,\nyou're confident the person will say \"yes\". 2) Interpret requests as\nexpectations of \"yes\", and, when possible, avoid saying \"no\".\n\nBoth approaches come with costs and benefits. In the end, I feel pretty\nstrongly that Ask is superior.\n\nBut these are not the only two possibilities!\n\n\"I'll be in town this weekend for a business trip. I would like to stay at\nyour place, since it would save me the cost of a hotel, plus I would enjoy\nseeing you and expect we\u2019d have some fun. I'm looking for other options,\nthough, and would rather stay elsewhere than inconvenience you.\" Response: \u201cI\nthink I need some space this weekend. But I\u2019d love to get a beer or something\nwhile you\u2019re in town!\u201d or \u201cYou should totally stay with me. I\u2019m looking\nforward to it.\u201d\n\nThere is a third alternative, and I think it's probably what rationalist\ncommunities ought to strive for. I call it \"Tell Culture\".\n\nThe two basic rules of Tell Culture: 1) Tell the other person what's going on\nin your own mind whenever you suspect you'd both benefit from them knowing.\n(Do NOT assume others will accurately model your mind without your help, or\nthat it will even occur to them to ask you questions to eliminate their\nignorance.) 2) Interpret things people tell you as attempts to create common\nknowledge for shared benefit, rather than as requests or as presumptions of\ncompliance.\n\nSuppose you\u2019re in a conversation that you\u2019re finding aversive, and you can\u2019t\nfigure out why. Your goal is to procure a rain check.\n\n  * Guess: *You see this annoyed body language? Huh? Look at it! If you don\u2019t stop talking soon I swear I\u2019ll start tapping my foot.* (Or, possibly, tell a little lie to excuse yourself. \u201cOh, look at the time...\u201d)\n  * Ask: \u201cCan we talk about this another time?\u201d\n  * Tell: \"I'm beginning to find this conversation aversive, and I'm not sure why. I propose we hold off until I've figured that out.\"\n\nHere are more examples from my own life:\n\n  * \"I didn't sleep well last night and am feeling frazzled and irritable today. I apologize if I snap at you during this meeting. It isn\u2019t personal.\"\n  * \"I just realized this interaction will be far more productive if my brain has food. I think we should head toward the kitchen.\"\n  * \"It would be awfully convenient networking for me to stick around for a bit after our meeting to talk with you and [the next person you're meeting with]. But on a scale of one to ten, it's only about 3 useful to me. If you'd rate the loss of utility for you as two or higher, then I have a strong preference for not sticking around.\"\n\nThe burden of honesty is even greater in Tell culture than in Ask culture. To\na Guess culture person, I imagine much of the above sounds passive aggressive\nor manipulative, much worse than the rude bluntness of mere Ask. It\u2019s because\nGuess people aren\u2019t expecting relentless truth-telling, which is exactly\nwhat\u2019s necessary here.\n\nIf you\u2019re occasionally dishonest and tell people you want things you don't\nactually care about--like their comfort or convenience--they\u2019ll learn not to\ntrust you, and the inherent freedom of the system will be lost. They\u2019ll learn\nthat you only pretend to care about them to take advantage of their\nreciprocity instincts, when in fact you\u2019ll count them as having defected if\nthey respond by stating a preference for protecting their own interests.\n\nTell culture is cooperation with open source codes.\n\nThis kind of trust does not develop overnight. Here is the most useful Tell\ntactic I know of for developing that trust with a native Ask or Guess. It\u2019s\nsaved me sooooo much time and trouble, and I wish I\u2019d thought of it earlier.\n\n\"I'm not asking because I expect you to say \u2018yes\u2019. I'm asking because I'm\nhaving trouble imagining the inside of your head, and I want to understand\nbetter. You are completely free to say \u2018no\u2019, or to tell me what you\u2019re\nthinking right now, and I promise it will be fine.\" It is amazing how often\npeople quickly stop looking shifty and say 'no' after this, or better yet\nbegin to discuss further details.\n\n## New to LessWrong?\n\nGetting Started\n\nFAQ\n\nLibrary\n\nCommunication Cultures10\n\nFrontpage\n\n# 264\n\nMentioned in\n\n262Your Cheerful Price\n\n108Social status part 1/2: negotiations over object-level preferences\n\n91Reveal Culture\n\n76AI Safety and Neighboring Communities: A Quick-Start Guide, as of Summer\n2022\n\n742020 Review Article\n\nLoad More (5/17)\n\nTell Culture\n\n18th Jan 2014\n\n120Julia_Galef\n\n36Creutzer\n\n25Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\n26Oscar_Cunningham\n\n68DaFranker\n\n8cos\n\n5Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\n2wassname\n\n10ChristianKl\n\n2bokov\n\n3ChristianKl\n\n2TheOtherDave\n\n2blacktrance\n\n5TheOtherDave\n\n2blacktrance\n\n1TheOtherDave\n\n1blacktrance\n\n8shokwave\n\n33Said Achmiz\n\n5Lachouette\n\n5maia\n\n2ChristianKl\n\n6Creutzer\n\n4ChristianKl\n\n2shokwave\n\n5wedrifid\n\n5therufs\n\n3wedrifid\n\n-4ialdabaoth\n\n6ChristianKl\n\n9ialdabaoth\n\n4Creutzer\n\n66TheOtherDave\n\n17David_Gerard\n\n49Kawoomba\n\n24LoganStrohl\n\n22Kawoomba\n\n8redlizard\n\n0LoganStrohl\n\n24Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\n1MuonManLaserJab\n\n5Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\n1MuonManLaserJab\n\n2solipsist\n\n7Gunnar_Zarncke\n\n3glomerulus\n\n6ChristianKl\n\n2Kawoomba\n\n5PlacidPlatypus\n\n-2Kawoomba\n\n42jbash\n\n77shokwave\n\n17Gunnar_Zarncke\n\n14Kaj_Sotala\n\n11jbash\n\n7Creutzer\n\n2Said Achmiz\n\n2Creutzer\n\n1Said Achmiz\n\n3Creutzer\n\n2Said Achmiz\n\n3Creutzer\n\n1Said Achmiz\n\n0Creutzer\n\n0Said Achmiz\n\n1David_Gerard\n\n10KnaveOfAllTrades\n\n39jbash\n\n7KnaveOfAllTrades\n\n24jbash\n\n15KnaveOfAllTrades\n\n11Dre\n\n3shokwave\n\n-1Alicorn\n\n0KnaveOfAllTrades\n\n4ChristianKl\n\n37MixedNuts\n\n31shokwave\n\n16Kaj_Sotala\n\n7shokwave\n\n-1MixedNuts\n\n19ThrustVectoring\n\n1MixedNuts\n\n10TheOtherDave\n\n0SilentCal\n\n10lukeprog\n\n5Said Achmiz\n\n1Philip_W\n\n0Vaniver\n\n0Philip_W\n\n0Philip_W\n\n0Philip_W\n\n0Philip_W\n\n30pianoforte611\n\n9Creutzer\n\n5[anonymous]\n\n4jdgalt\n\n19Moss_Piglet\n\n4Luke_A_Somers\n\n4Creutzer\n\n19Kaj_Sotala\n\n8LoganStrohl\n\n18Scott Garrabrant\n\n10Rob Bensinger\n\n17ChristianKl\n\n21LoganStrohl\n\n14ChristianKl\n\n6MalcolmOcean\n\n13ChristianKl\n\n16V_V\n\n9Nornagest\n\n4Lumifer\n\n5wedrifid\n\n1blacktrance\n\n1wedrifid\n\n4blacktrance\n\n2hyporational\n\n-2blacktrance\n\n-2V_V\n\n3A1987dM\n\n1ialdabaoth\n\n3Creutzer\n\n2ialdabaoth\n\n4MugaSofer\n\n2TheOtherDave\n\n3ialdabaoth\n\n4TheOtherDave\n\n1ialdabaoth\n\n-2Eugine_Nier\n\n2TheOtherDave\n\n1MugaSofer\n\n-1MugaSofer\n\n-1V_V\n\n1TheOtherDave\n\n6V_V\n\n0TheOtherDave\n\n1V_V\n\n1TheOtherDave\n\n0wedrifid\n\n0Luke_A_Somers\n\n2V_V\n\n0Luke_A_Somers\n\n0V_V\n\n0Luke_A_Somers\n\n0V_V\n\n4Luke_A_Somers\n\n0V_V\n\n0Luke_A_Somers\n\n13lukeprog\n\n12Gunnar_Zarncke\n\n4shokwave\n\n3torekp\n\n10Vaniver\n\n5AnnaSalamon\n\n9AndyWood\n\n9WalterL\n\n9wedrifid\n\n3kalium\n\n1Creutzer\n\n8Adam Zerner\n\n7LoganStrohl\n\n3Lumifer\n\n2arundelo\n\n7SilentCal\n\n1TheOtherDave\n\n0SilentCal\n\n0TheOtherDave\n\n1SilentCal\n\n7b1shop\n\n1Creutzer\n\n7Nornagest\n\n1Strange7\n\n2b1shop\n\n6Bayeslisk\n\n6Gunnar_Zarncke\n\n5Ronny Fernandez\n\n5[anonymous]\n\n5simplicio\n\n17TheOtherDave\n\n7simplicio\n\n7TheOtherDave\n\n7christopherj\n\n4Punoxysm\n\n4Stefan_Schubert\n\n8Kaj_Sotala\n\n17Stefan_Schubert\n\n4Creutzer\n\n3Emily\n\n1Kaj_Sotala\n\n6gjm\n\n6Richard_Kennaway\n\n2Stefan_Schubert\n\n2Stefan_Schubert\n\n2wedrifid\n\n3Kaj_Sotala\n\n5David_Gerard\n\n2Stefan_Schubert\n\n2Creutzer\n\n2Apprentice\n\n1Strange7\n\n0[anonymous]\n\n3Dagon\n\n4MalcolmOcean\n\n2TheOtherDave\n\n0Gunnar_Zarncke\n\n3CronoDAS\n\n2b1shop\n\n2Kenny\n\n1jdgalt\n\n1TheOtherDave\n\n1sauber\n\n1sauber\n\n1taryneast\n\n1Fossegrimen\n\n1SoundLogic\n\n7kalium\n\n4SoundLogic\n\n1TsviBT\n\n0turchin\n\n3entirelyuseless\n\n2turchin\n\n0Lumifer\n\n0turchin\n\n7Lumifer\n\n0flexive\n\n0Princess_Stargirl\n\n0nyralech\n\n0[anonymous]\n\n0shminux\n\nNew Comment\n\n229 comments, sorted by\n\ntop scoring\n\nClick to highlight new comments since: Today at 7:00 PM\n\nSome comments are truncated due to high volume.

I\n> propose we hold off until I've figured that out.\"\n\nI read this suggested line and felt a little worried. I hope rationalist\nculture doesn't head in that direction.\n\nThere are plenty of times when I agree a policy of frankness can be useful,\nbut one of the risks of such a policy is that it can become an excuse to\nabdicate responsibility for your effect on other people.\n\nIf you tell me that you're having an aversive reaction to our conversation,\nbut can't tell me why, it's going to stress me out, and I'm going to feel\ncompelled to go back over our conversation to see if I can figure out what I\ndid to cause that reaction in you. That's a non-negligible burden to dump on\nsomeone.\n\nIf, instead, you found an excuse to leave the conversation gracefully (no need\nfor annoyed body language), you can reflect on the conversation later and\ndecide if there is anything in particular I did to cause your aversive\nreaction. Maybe so, and you want to bring it up with me later. Or maybe you\ndecide you overreacted to a comment I made, which you now believe you\nmisinterpreted. Or maybe you decide you were just anxious about something\nunrelated. Overall, chances are good that you can save me a lot of stress and\nself-consciousness by dealing with your emotions yourself as a first pass, and\nmaking them my problem only if (upon reflection) you decide that it would be\nhelpful to do so.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Creutzer10y360\n\nInteresting, I have the exact opposite gut reaction. It could be rephrased in\nslight variations, e.g. \"until we've figured that out\", or, as shokwave below\nsuggested, with a request for assistance, but in general, if someone said that\nto me, I would, ceteris paribus, infer that they are a self-aware and\npeaceful/cooperative person and that they are not holding anything in\nparticular against me.\n\nWhereas when someone leaves a conversation with an excuse that may or may not\nbe genuine, it leaves me totally stressed-out because I have no idea what's\ngoing on and now I have the burden of figuring everything out on my own, about\nanother person who is obviously intent on not sending many informative\nsignals. Great.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Eliezer Yudkowsky10y250\n\nYes, my version of this always goes, \"I'm finding this conversation aversive\nand I don't know why. Hold on while I figure it out.\" In other words, it\ndoesn't delay a conversation until later, but it does mean that I close my\neyes for 60 seconds and think.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Oscar_Cunningham10y260\n\n> I'm finding this conversation and I don't know why.\n\nYou accidentally a word, I think?\n\nReply\n\n[-]DaFranker10y680\n\nIf you speak the words fast enough and with enough conviction, your audience's\nbrain will fill in the gap with whatever pleases them while you retain full\nplausible deniability. Win!\n\nReply\n\n8cos3y\n\nAh, how very guess culture of you!\n\n5Eliezer Yudkowsky10y\n\nFixed.\n\n2wassname1mo\n\n\"But Sir, I just need your order.\"\n\n[-]ChristianKl10y100\n\nI also find that line a bit strange. In nearly all cases where I would expect\nthat someone says: \"I'm beginning to find this conversation aversive, and I'm\nnot sure why\" I think I would take it as a topic change to why the\nconversation might bring up negative emotions in the person.\n\nIf we are in an environment of open conversation and I say something that\nbrings up an emotional trauma in another person and that person doesn't have\nthe self-awareness to know why he's feeling unwell, that's not a good time to\nleave him alone.\n\nReply\n\n2bokov10y\n\n?! Depends. If you don't understand that person intimately or aren't\nexperienced at helping less self-aware (aka neurotypical) people process\nemotional trauma, it's probably a very good time to leave him alone. Politely.\n\n3ChristianKl10y\n\nYou don't need to understand another person to help them. Even if you do\nunderstand another person well enough to know what triggered them, telling\nthem can be invasive and therefore needs some amount of implicit of explicit\npermission. Being there and being a stable anchor is often better than trying\nto interfere with their state. That means if you are mentally flexible about\nchanging your state opening up on your side and allowing the emotions to rise\nin you to a level that similar to the other person but more calm. If you are\nnot flexible and can meditate, that usually a good state to go to. For me the\nonly reason to leave is if I'm myself not in a stable emotional place. But I\ncan certainly understand if other people generally don't see themselves in a\nposition to help.\n\n2TheOtherDave10y\n\nInteresting. My default move would be to sit quietly in their presence and pay\nattention, rather than leave. Why would leaving be better?\n\n2blacktrance10y\n\nBecause if you don't know them intimately, you're likely to make them feel\nuncomfortable by intruding on their trauma.\n\n5TheOtherDave10y\n\nIs the likelihood of that greater than the likelihood of making them feel\nuncomfortable by abandoning them in their (recalled) trauma? (I realize that\n\"abandoning\" is a very connotationally loaded term; I choose it here to\ncounterbalance \"intruding.\" I'm happy to switch to less loaded terms if you\nprefer.)\n\n2blacktrance10y\n\nIt's likely to be worse than leaving them politely. Whether it's worse than\njust getting up and leaving depends on the person and situation.\n\n1TheOtherDave10y\n\nFair enough. I'm not at all sure that's true -- certainly when I'm\nexperiencing recalled trauma I would far prefer that people sit quietly with\nme than that they politely leave, but of course one data point isn't\nespecially useful in this case -- but certainly if it is true the rest\nfollows. Do you have any data to support that?\n\n1blacktrance10y\n\nNo data, just introspection and personal observation. Maybe it's a variation\nin people's preferences.\n\n8shokwave10y\n\nSomething like \"I'm finding this conversation aversive, and I'm not sure why.\nCan you help me figure it out?\" would be way more preferable. Something in\nrationalist culture that I actually do like is using \"This is a really low-\nvalue conversation, are you getting any value? We should stop.\" to end\nunproductive arguments.\n\n[-]Said Achmiz10y330\n\nTo the latter, your interlocutor says (or likely, thinks to themselves):\n\n\"Uh, actually, I was rather enjoying that conversation. I thought it had\nvalue. But I guess I was wrong; it seems you do not find me interesting, or\nthink that I am annoying. That hurts.\"\n\nWorking as intended?\n\nReply\n\n5Lachouette10y\n\nActually when a person is hurt they might not be in a state of mind to phrase\nit like that. I know that I tend to focus on the feeling of being hurt first,\nand it is incredibly difficult to not react indirectly with defensiveness\nwhich would be directed at something other than \"I guess you don't find me\ninteresting\", because that shows vulnerability. A person (like unreflected me)\nmight instinctively attack in a different area to \"retaliate\" to what they\nfelt was a surprise attack on their self-worth. I am working on this, but I\ndoubt most people with this problem are. Which should be kept in mind, I\nthink: I agree with ChristianKI that open communication is preferable here,\nbut in a situation where you create emotions in the other person they might\nfind it impossible to stay rational even if their system 2 wants to. Solution?\nI actually do like the idea of ending useless conversations very much. I would\nrephrase it less bluntly which reduces the confrontation. What bothers me\nabout this one is definite statements, e.g. \"We should stop\". It implies you\nexpect the other person to have the same opinion as you, which isn't in the\nspirit of Tell Culture. Suggestion: \"I got the feeling that this conversation\nis not really helping me right now. What is your impression on this? If you\nagree with me, perhaps we could switch topics?\" (or offer to shift the\nconversation into a specific direction that you would enjoy) Generally I would\nmatch the carefulness to my impression of how much the other person enjoys the\nconversation.\n\n5maia10y\n\nAlternately, they say: \"Uh, actually, I was enjoying that conversation. In\nparticular, I was interested in the part where [stuff]. Maybe we could focus\non talking about that part?\" And then maybe you compromise on a conversational\ntopic, rather than interpreting the rejection of the conversation as a\nrejection of you. Or in the ideal case, \"Oh, I wasn't actually enjoying it\neither, I was just talking about it because I thought you still wanted to.\nGreat, let's change the subject.\"\n\n2ChristianKl10y\n\nYes. Getting good social feedback is valuable. If the person says that you can\nreassure them that you generally like them as a person but that going down\nthat particular argument to decide who's right just doesn't interest you.\nThere are arguments about who's right that are unproductive and stopping them\nand explaining your reasoning to the other person can be valuable for a person\nwith low social skills even if it hurts them a bit. I rather prefer getting\nhonest social feedback and not getting looked down upon to not knowing what\nI'm doing wrong and getting looked down upon. But it does depend on the\nculture in which things are said. There are situations where one can be open\nand other's where it's more difficult. There might also be cases where the\nother person think the conversation has value and says: \"Actually you making\nthat argument is the first time I heard it, so even if you already made in ten\ntimes in the past, I'm really interested in understanding that argument\nbetter.\" That's very useful information and hearing it might make the\nconversation a lot more fun for both participants. The sentiment could be\nworded nicer, but it does achieve it's ends.\n\n6Creutzer10y\n\nThe end is you getting out of a conversation that annoys you with total\ndisregard for the other person's feelings? Because the way shokwave phrased it\nis really incredibly blunt.\n\n4ChristianKl10y\n\nThere are plenty of unproductive discussions in rational circles where you can\nreasonably assume that the other person is arguing to win a debate and not\nbecause he finds a discussion interesting. I think those discussion are\nsituation where shokwave might say those words. In those cases they are spoken\nwith the interest of the other person in mind. Of course you can be wrong\nabout that in your reading of the situation. If you pay attention to the other\nperson you should notice when they have a meaningful emotional reactions to\nthe words that you are saying. In those cases you can readjust the emotional\nimpact by telling them something nice about them and starting a new thread of\ndiscussion in the process. While I personally wouldn't be as blunt I have meet\nplenty of people who have no problem being that blunt while also doing enough\nto signal that they like the person they are interacting with to avoid harming\nthem strongly. Additionally I would personally prefer that if I'm walking\naround with body odor that someone would tell me, even if he would tell me in\na way that produces a bit of temporary emotionally displeasure. I would\npredict that a significant amount of people who are part of the rationalist\ncommunity share that preference. I like getting honest feedback from other\npeople. If someone puts me in a state of deep emotional turmoil I think they\nare responsible to stay there and do what they can to fix it if they aren't\nrequested to leave. But to the extend that I do have control over myself I\nwon't look down on them for providing honest feedback.\n\n2shokwave10y\n\nIt's possible that it is too blunt. My instinct (calibrated on around half a\nhundred nights of conversation with Australian LessWrongers in person) says\nthat it's not, though.\n\n5wedrifid10y\n\nIt seems that preferences must vary on this one. This one seems much more\npotentially problematical because it pulls the other into your (already\naversive) emotional world. It can work if there is already a huge amount of\nrapport and intimacy but the other more independent request seems safer. I\nreally do like whatever variants of the theme \"Agree to d\u0336i\u0336s\u0336a\u0336g\u0336r\u0336e\u0336e\u0336 STFU\"\nthat can be made to work.\n\n5therufs10y\n\nIf I'm having some kind of internal experience that may color my\ninterpretation of what my interlocutor is trying to tell me, I feel like I owe\nit to them and whatever we're discussing to stop the conversation as soon as I\nrealize something is wrong, since if e.g., it turns out I'm sleepy, taking a\nnap wouldn't (I think) be sufficient to fully counteract the negative opinion\nof the topic I formed when I was crabby. Could you give an example of a\ngraceful exit? For me, interrupting a conversation without saying why I'm\nactually doing it feels dishonest/rude, especially if we're discussing\nsomething that's important enough for me to care that I treat it fairly.\n\n3wedrifid10y\n\n[I do not endorse that particular conversation move. Nor do I particularly\ndiscourage it, between Tell culture users.] I observe that this objection to\nthe exit strategy the problem is that 'Tell culture' is not being used by the\nreceiving party. The receiving party is interpreting the information through\nthe filter of some variety of non-Tell culture and essentially reading a\ndifferent message than the one sent. This is a real problem but it is a real\nproblem relating to speaking a language different to the audience, not a\nproblem that applies to the communication via the language itself. Speaking\n'Tell Culture' phrases to someone who is not both familiar with the\ncommunication style and happy to use it should not be expected to work well.\nThe complimentary risk here is that your opposing policy can become (or\ninherently is) an excuse to abdicate responsibility for ones own thoughts and\nbehaviour onto someone else. Neither are particularly healthy habits. Note\nthat the speakers words explicitly claim responsibility and even go so far as\nto propose that even if the other person can figure the stuff out the speaker\nstill has to figure it out for herself before the condition is met. It also\ncontains no more (in fact, almost certainly much less) information than is\ncontained in the uncontrollable communication via facial expressions, voice\ntone and body language while ending the conversation. The difference is there\nisn't level of social 'role play' where people pretend that information has\nnot been communicated and where if that information is formally acknowledged\nto be communicated it is the equivalent to shouting or using all-caps. Or if\nlooking at from the perspective of assigning responsibility to the active\nparty that's a non-negligible burden that, someone walked up and forcibly took\nas there own because it wasn't kept hidden. The speaker actually set up\nboundaries around the aversion-experience-analysis territory that imply that\nwould be somewhat presumpt\n\n-4ialdabaoth10y\n\nThat can easily be exploited, however. If people know this is your reaction,\nthen they have an easy button to push to exclude you from any conversation\nwhere they don't want your voice heard. EDIT: I will retract this statement if\nsomeone explains what's wrong with it.\n\n6ChristianKl10y\n\nOne of the issues with the comment is that it presumes that the people with\nwhom you are interacting socially aren't trustworthy. To the extend that we\nwant improve culture, we usually want to create environments where people\ntrust each other by default. Secondly it assumes that people don't learn. If I\nhave a button that causes me serious discomfort that makes me want to escape a\nconversation and I understand the button, then I work on the issue and the\nnext time it comes up it might not cause me to leave. There are also topics\nwhich are just boring. It's probably not hard to find topics that\npredicatively bore me and that you could bring up to make me want to leave a\nconservation. Let's say I'm talking with Alice and Carol. Alice really wants\nto talk about some women issue with Alice with no guy around. She could bring\nup the topic of how the supermodel XY did something and how nobody should do\nthat. If I find that topic boring and leave the conversation, nothing bad\nhappened. I can spend my time elsewhere. Alice seems to be getting utility\nfrom discussing the topic with Carol, so overall utility might be gained by\nfinding a way to request gracefully that I leave the conversation.

It seems to me that a\nQuirrell wouldn't agree to this.\n\n5Eliezer Yudkowsky9y\n\nYou don't have to sacrifice your own power for that, the bonder sacrifices\npower.

Your argument only works if you can trust everyone else\nnot to defect, too - in a homogenous community of Briennes, for instance.

I may be wrong here, though,\nand my experiences could be a consequence of individual variation. One might\nnote in this context is that some of this might be reflected in\nconventionalized linguistic politeness strategies. For example, Russian\nconstructions used for polite requests are very Asky, and would be incredibly\nrude if translated literally into English or German. Of course, this is only\nvery weak evidence that present-day Russia has more of an Ask culture than the\nWest.\n\n2Said Achmiz10y\n\nCould you give some examples? (I speak Russian and English.)\n\n2Creutzer10y\n\nI was specifically thinking of \"\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c(\u0442\u0435) \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440(\u0430/\u044b)\" + Imperative is a very\n\"Asky\" way of phrasing a request, which is pretty direct and intrusive in\nEnglish. If you add \"\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\", the translation becomes plainly\nabsurd. And as far as I know - I might be miscalibrated, so correct me if I'm\nwrong - simple Imperative + \"\u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0430\" is also more polite than the English\ntranslation would be. I must admit that can do something similar to the \"\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c\n\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\" construction in my variety of German, but it's slightly less polite than\nthe Russian counterpart, I think. In general, (my variety of) German loves\nindirection, like English, which Russian doesn't really have. Cf. also the\nsimple \"\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e?\", whose translations are very rude. (I'm told\nthat \"\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e?\" works like \"won't you close the window?\",\nbut my experience with Russian is to scarce to know that first-hand.)\n\n1Said Achmiz10y\n\nHmm. I would render this into English as \"would you be so kind as to ...\",\nwhich doesn't seem rude. This has no analogue in English that I know of;\nyou're right, a literal translation would sound rather absurd (something like\n\"I'm asking you, please\"... no, that's not quite right, but yes, I agree.\n\"Please do X\"... seems reasonably polite, for a direct request. I'm not sure I\nsee the difference. Hm? Example please? Actually, this is more direct and less\npolite than what seems to be the direct English translation: \"won't you close\nthe window?\" Admittedly, if instead you render this as \"will you not close the\nwindow?\", it becomes less polite. Perhaps the contraction makes it a \"standard\npolite asking phrase\", rendering it less direct? I'm not sure. This is\nungrammatical. I'm not sure what you were going for with this one, but it's\nnot a thing people say. I guess the question is, how do you normally ask\npeople to do things in English? What are some examples of things you might ask\npeople to do, or ask people for; and what are rude or polite ways of phrasing\nthose things? We might compare them with their Russian versions, then.\n\n3Creutzer10y\n\nBut that is not remotely a literal translation, which is my point. Yeah, that\nwas a performance error. It should, of course, have read \"\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0448\u044c\n\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e\". Default strategies for making requests in English, which are\nvery indirect: \"Would you mind doing X?\" and \"Could you (please) do X?\" I feel\nthat \"please\" + imperative is extremely blunt to the point that I would never\nuse it. I suppose \"do X, will you?\" is a possibility in English, but only in\nvery informal contexts. For \"won't you do X\", see below. Wait, what? In my\nexperience, \"won't you close the window\" is a politer version of \"you're\nsupposed to close the window, so do it already\".\n\n2Said Achmiz10y\n\n[\"\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c(\u0442\u0435) \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440(\u0430/\u044b)\" -> \"would you be so kind as to ...\"] Uh, what? I\nstruggle to imagine how you would get a more literal rendering without\nbreaking English syntactical rules. Hm, perhaps removing the \"would you\" \u2014 \"Be\nso kind as to ...\" \u2014 would make it absolutely literal. Is that really a large\nchange in effect, though? That makes grammatical sense, but it's somewhat\nweird to phrase a request like this. Like, \"hey, will you be doing X?\" \u2014 that\nseems like a question. It could be a request... but only in Guess culture.\nI've almost never heard someone say this and just mean it as a request on its\nown; sometimes that sort of construction is followed by a request... Huh?? We\nseem to be running into some serious differences in experience here... In\nRussian, you could say (and people often do): \"\u041d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433 \u0431\u044b \u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e?\" \u2014\nwhich by direct translation becomes \"Could you close the window?\" \u2014 but the\nRussian phrase is quite polite-sounding, whereas the English phrase is less\nso. Of course, we've been using the informal \"you\" (\"\u0442\u044b\") in these phrases,\nbut using the formal/polite \"you\" (\"\u0432\u044b\") makes any of these phrases even more\npolite: \"\u041d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e?\" Plus, in conversation, I've usually\nexperienced such a phrase following a sort of \"warning of request\", like so:\n\"\u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043a \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044c\u0431\u0430... \" (interlocutor says \"\u0414\u0430?\" or \"\u042f \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u044e?\")\n\"\u041d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e?\" Which, rendered in English, looks like this: \"I\nhave the following request for you [formal/polite]...\" (\"Yes?\" or \"I'm\nlistening?\") \"Could you [formal/polite] close the window?\" I don't know...\nthat seems \"Asky\" to the extent that you are asking someone for something,\nrather than making them guess, but I don't see it as any more direct, per se,\nthan the English equivalents.\n\n3Creutzer10y\n\nHow about \"Be kind/nice, do X\"? It's grammatical - of course, it's a weird\nthing to say, but the entire point was that the literal translations are weird\nand/or pushy. \"would you be so kind as to\" is indirect in virtue of being a\nquestion and not containing an imperative; of course, it's the correct\ntranslation, but it's really a very different construction. Good to know. I\nonce read that it has something of \"you were supposed to do it, so are you\ngonna do it or what?\" about it, but as I said, I have no personal experience\nwith it. Yes, I agree. I would guess that the counterpart of \"could you hold\nthat for a minute?\" would perhaps be \"\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0430, \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0443\" - but\n\"hold that for a minute, please\" strikes me as really very rude in English.\nWell, for one thing, I feel it's weird to say \"I have a request for you\" in\nEnglish. You'd normally say \"could I ask you for something/a favor\". In that,\nthe Russian formulation is already more direct. Of course, as I said, all that\nis not exactly strong evidence in favor of Russia actually having more of an\nask culture, only very mildly suggestive. You can behave in an Ask or Guess\nculture way in either language, it's just that the conventionalized politeness\nstrategies of English make a lot of use of indirection (questions, and usually\nmoralized, virtually never imperatives), whereas in Russian, when saying\nsomething that is equivalent in politeness to a certain English construction,\nyou mention the request somewhat more directly (although, as you point out,\nthere is the more indirect \"\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b\" strategy). By the way, do you live in\nRussian or another Russian-speaking country? Because I've seen a study that\nshowed that heritage speakers of Russian (i.e. speakers who live in a\ndifferent linguistic community but learned the language from a parent) adopt\nmore English-like politeness strategies.

I at least would not use the term 'rationalist' in\nthis way to a broader audience for the reason you mentioned, but your comment\nmakes me think that avoiding ambiguity and not appropriating is not enough and\nperhaps even using it among ourselves is to be avoided, e.g. for the benefit\nof those 'looking in from the outside' who might be preemptively alienated. I\ndo think that 'Muggle' makes a useful distinction (something like a\ndistinction for those receptive to LW-school ideas and techniques?) in quickly\nconveying the referrent's mindset. I do remember that the first time I saw\nEliezer use the term in that way, I was not entirely convinced it was a\n'savoury' word to use, and your reaction is enough evidence for me to put a\nmoratorium on it in my own usage at least until I have a chance to think about\nit more, because it does indeed seem like it might foster a counterproductive\nresentful or oppositional mindset. I anticipated and agree that Crocker's\nrules are by far the most risky of the things I mentioned. I agree that there\nare possibly-significant (I'd have to think about it more) differences between\nTelling and some of the Sequences examples I gave. Perhaps more accurate\nwould've been for me to say that your original argument could have been\napplied to the LW-rationality approach generally, or to the bias-correcting\napproach based on the heuristics and biases literature. I certainly have a\nfriend who dislikes Eliezer's take on heuristics and biases and seems to have\nsort of become a bias denialist, although that's obfuscated by the possibility\nthey just got thrown by Eliezer hitting them where it hurts (the English\nLiterature).\n\n[-]jbash10y240\n\nThis may be getting into private-message territory.

However, I don't like the notion\nof these protocols as \"cultures\" because I don't think anybody follows, or\nshould follow, any one of them consistently all or nearly all the time.\nInstead, I believe reality is and should be, that the meaning of a statement\nwhich can be parsed as a request depends on how reasonable it would be if the\nasker (1) expects compliance (perhaps to the point of getting upset if it\ndoesn't happen), (2) intends it merely as a request (\"asker culture\"), and/or\n(3) would only dare ask if he is fairly sure the hearer will not take offense.\nObviously, as a request goes up the spectrum from something trivial (\"Excuse\nme\" as I push through a crowd to get out of a bus) to something the hearer is\nlikely to find quite burdensome, both speakers and hearers tend to move up\nfrom interpretation (1) to (2) to (3). Familiarity with the other person also\nmodifies this calculation, but that change can go in either direction\ndepending on what you know about that person and about how he views you. But\nwhere I part ways from the article writer is where he talks about \"ask\nculture\" as being superior to \"guess culture\". About the only place I see\nanything resembling \"guess culture\" is where a request (or a statement being\nparsed as a request, maybe erroneously) is about a subject the hearer has\nissues about{1}, for instance, when trying to get laid. And as I see it, the\nmere fact that a typical woman hearing such a request interprets it as a\ndemand (and/or \"an example of the guess culture\") does not mean that the asker\nshould be blamed for anything of the kind. {1} I have phrased this to step on\nas few toes as possible, and thus am avoiding conclusions about what such\n\"issues\" may imply about anyone's rationality. And for the same reason I\nshould probably stop here\n\n[-]Moss_Piglet10y190\n\nThe problem here is that, as far as I can tell, a \"Tell\" culture would\nimmediately become a \"Lie Ineptly\" culture.\n\nMost of the time, in my experience anyway, when you don't want to help someone\nit's usually for a reason you couldn't say without nuking or at least damaging\nthe relationship. Even worse, the level of detail / emotion in the \"Tell\" is\nmuch higher than the straightforward \"Ask\" which makes the usual evasions seem\nhollow and requires more elaborate excuses.

This reduction only occurs if you also assume that the agents\nare also compelled to do some degree of sloppy utilitarian aggregation.\nStating strong preferences doesn't compel people to give you more stuff. It\ntells people that to whatever extent they wish to give you stuff, which kind\nof stuff you would prefer to have. Consider Bob: * Bob values being given a\nchocolate cake 9. * Bob values a foot massage 2. * Bob values being given a\nbeer 1. Bob could lie and say: * I value being given a chocolate cake OVER\n9000!. * I value a foot massage OVER 9000!. * I value being given a beer OVER\n9000!. Consider Alice: * Alice giving a chocolate cake costs 4. * Alice giving\na foot massage to Bob costs 3. * Alice giving a beer costs 2. * Alice wishes\nto spend 5 on Bob (either in trade or out of altruism) and to do so in the\nmost effective way. Since Bob has overstated Alice concludes that giving a\nfoot massage and a beer will give Bob OVER 18,000! value while giving Bob a\nchocolate cake will give Bob a mere OVER 9,000! value. If Bob had stated his\npreferences accurately then Alice would have given him the cake and he would\nhave got his 9 value. He lied, so he got a mere 3 value. That was silly of\nhim.

If your friend Xerxes says he values chocolate cake at OVER 9000!!! and\nyour friend Ygnacio says he values it at 1, you care about both of them\nroughly equally, and you assume that they're stating their preferences\nhonestly, you should give the cake to Xerxes. But then there's an incentive to\nexaggerate one's preferences.\n\n1wedrifid10y\n\nNo, they really don't. Most significantly because most people don't behave as\nconsequentialists of any kind. Also, and this time fortunately, our\negalitarian instincts are sufficient to suppress that kind of folly. No, you\nshouldn't. Even if we ignore the type error of comparing Xerxes_value and\nYgnacio_value and your decision 'should' take into account other information\nincluding things like who you gave the strawberry tarts to ten minutes ago and\nassorted other social transactions. I have not met a single human who gives\nall his favours to the same person because they are the most enthusiastic (and\nwould consider the resultant behaviour to be repugnant and a behavioural red\nflag). Yes, as the grandparent observed, when the people being spoken to are\nboth gullible and utilitarian and the speakers are neither ethical nor\nutilitarian 'Tell' does devolve into 'Ask'. However if the listener is either\nnot-gullible or not a crude total utilitarian then exaggerating your\npreferences amounts to crippling your own ability to receive value via either\ntrade or gifts towards the limit of being only able to communicate booleans.\n(ie. It's purely destructive self-sabotage.)\n\n4blacktrance10y\n\nMost people don't consistently behave as consequentialists, but they do make\nconsequentialist decisions some of the time, particularly in cases like this\none. Consider a less extreme example. Suppose your friend Xerxes is obsessed\nwith Beethoven - he listens to every known composition and tries to learn it,\nand derives great enjoyment from doing so. Your friend Ygnacio also likes\nclassical music in general but has no specific fondness for Beethoven. While\ndigging in your belongings, you discover a sheet of antique sheet music\npersonally written by Beethoven. Coincidentally, Xerxes's and Ygnacio's\nbirthdays are coming up, and this would make a good gift for either of them -\nbut as there's only one sheet of music, only one of them can receive it.\nCertainly, Ygnacio would appreciate it, but Xerxes would like it much more. In\nsuch a situation, most people would give the sheet music to Xerxes, because he\nwould enjoy it more. As for the utility monster, that's a nonsequitur in this\ncontext, because we're not talking about true (agent-neutral) utilitarianism,\nonly about utility maximization, which is not the same thing. We're not\ncomparing XerxesValue and YgnacioValue, we're comparing\nHowMuchYouCareAboutXerxes x XerxesValue and HowMuchYouCareAboutYgnacio x\nYgnacioValue, which does not produce a type error. If you gave the strawberry\ntarts to someone ten minutes ago, it is reasonable to assume that because of\ndiminishing marginal utility, they won't value sweets as highly as they did\nbefore. But if you have reason to believe that they don't experience\ndiminishing marginal utility, or that their diminished derived utility would\nstill be greater than the utility derived by an alternative person, then you\nshould give it to the person who would derive greater utility (assuming you\nvalue them equally). It's true that people don't always give all favors to the\nmost enthusiastic person, but that is justified because it's reasonable to\nassume that enthusiasm isn't always a reliab\n\n2hyporational10y\n\nHow do you think caring about having more allies than one affects this\nsituation?\n\n-2blacktrance10y\n\nIf that's a term in your utility function, then you should consider it.

As blacktrance noted, usually there is\ncompetition. Even when there is no competition, Alice may be induced to spend\nmore on Bob if he hides or misrepresents his true preferences: If Bob\noverstated, Alice might think she is making him a great favour, and hence she\nis building lots of social capital, when in fact she isn't. There are also\nscenarios where it is useful to understate one's preferences: in a typical\nbargaining, for instance, the buyer often has an incentive to understate their\npreference for the good being traded (or overstate their preference for\nmoney), while the seller has an incentive to do the opposite. In general,\nagents often have an incentive to reveal their preferences as little as\npossible, in order to exploit the information asymmetry.\n\n3A1987dM10y\n\nI think that's only the case in competitive games, not cooperative ones. (ISTM\nthe optimal amount of information to reveal would be zero in the zero-sum-game\nlimit and everything you know (neglecting the cost of communication itself\netc.) in the identical-payoff-matrices limit.)\n\n1ialdabaoth10y\n\nA problem I continue to run into in real life is, \"how do you keep people from\nwire-heading their preferences whenever they find themselves in a positive-sum\ngame, so that they can play a zero-sum version instead?\"\n\n3Creutzer10y\n\nWhat does \"wire-head a preference\" mean?\n\n2ialdabaoth10y\n\nRewrite your utility function. Examples: Original preference - \"I just want a\ncar to get to work.\" Environmental change: \"Here, everyone gets a car for\nfree.\" Adjusted preference - \"Okay, then what I REALLY want is a faster car\nthan anyone else has.\" ... Original preference - \"I just want to be able to\neat.\" Environmental change: \"Here, there's enough food to go around forever.\"\nAdjusted preference - \"Okay, then what I REALLY want is for me to eat while\nthose guys have to watch, starving.\" ... Original preference - \"I just want to\nfeel safe.\" Environmental change: \"Here, you're in a space where everyone is\nyour ally and no one can hurt you.\" Adjusted preference - \"Okay, then what I\nREALLY want is for us to all gang up on the people who made us feel unsafe,\nand make THEM feel persecuted for a change.\"\n\n4MugaSofer10y\n\nYou mean \"What I REALLY want is to eat better than everybody else\", surely.\nGourmet food or organic or hand-prepared etc. etc. Unless this is intended to\nimply the current famines etc. are the product of a conspiracy and not\ncivilizational inadequacy, in which case yes, that would of course be evidence\nthat my model of human nature is wrong an yours is the correct one, if it's\ntrue.\n\n2TheOtherDave10y\n\nThe way you formulate this opposes the idea that the \"adjusted\" preference was\nactually the preference all along, and the originally stated preference was\nsimply an incorrect description of the system's actual preferences. Is that\ndeliberate, or just an incidental artifact of your phrasing?\n\n3ialdabaoth10y\n\nIt's an artifact of my phrasing. In my experience, people do truly want good\nthings, until those things become universally available - at which point they\nswitch goals to something zero-sum. When they do so, they often phrase it\nthemselves as if they really wanted the zero-sum thing all along, but that's\noften a part of trying to distance themselves from their lower-status past. Of\ncourse, I'm describing something that I only have personal and anecdotal\nevidence for; I'd REALLY like to be pointed towards either a legitimate, peer-\nreviewed description of a cognitive bias that would explain what I'm\nobserving. (And I'd be at least equally happy if it turned out to be my\ncognitive bias that's causing me to perceive people in this way.)\n\n4TheOtherDave10y\n\nWhat would you expect to experience differently if, instead, people truly want\nzero-sum things, but they claim to want good things until the universal\navailability of good things makes that claim untenable?\n\n1ialdabaoth10y\n\nI'll need some time to think on this. This might just be my tendency to find\nthe most charitable interpretation, even if other interpretations might be\nmore parsimonious.\n\n-2Eugine_Nier10y\n\nWhat do you mean by \"trully want\"? See the phenomenon Eliezer describes here.\n\n2TheOtherDave10y\n\nI intend the phrase to refer to whatever ialdabaoth meant by it when I quoted\nthem.\n\n1MugaSofer10y\n\nSo it was deliberate, and not an artifact of your phrasing. Did you perhaps\nmisread the grandparent?\n\n-1MugaSofer10y\n\nInterestingly, ISTM that is itself a Prisoner's Dilemma: the agent that\ndoesn't reveal it's (true) preferences has a much, much better chance of\nmanipulating an agent that does.\n\n-1V_V10y\n\nIf you know that the game is zero-sum then you usually already know all the\nother player preferences.\n\n1TheOtherDave10y\n\nCan you clarify how overstating preferences reduces to Ask culture?\n\n6V_V10y\n\nBecause you tend to always ask overstating your preferences, and the other\nparty understands that you are probably overstating, hence preference claims\nlose informative value, and at some point they can just be dropped.\n\n0TheOtherDave10y\n\nYou seem to be claiming that in an Ask culture, if I say \"I want X\" I expect\nothers to understand that I don't actually want X, but rather want some other\nthing Y for which X is an overstatement, where Y doesn't get stated\nexplicitly. Have I understood you correctly?\n\n1V_V10y\n\nNo. In Tell culture you say something equivalent to \"I want X with strength 9\nout of 10\". The problem is that if everybody always says \"9 out of 10\" the\nstated preference becomes meaningless and the message becomes \"I want X\".\n\n1TheOtherDave10y\n\nAh! I now understand what you're saying. Sure, that makes sense. Thanks for\nclarifying.\n\n0wedrifid10y\n\nTell culture with a preference weight cost certainly does devolve. It doesn't\ndevolve into guess culture (as described in the post), but into something\ndifferent and arguably (but not strictly) worse. Guess culture works passably\nwell when the asker/guesser is able to reliably model the response of the\nlistener. This 'stating preferences is costly' system doesn't handle that\nsituation correctly.\n\n0Luke_A_Somers10y\n\nWell, then... have a moderate social cost for stating strong preferences? I\nmean, it seems like you're saying that it's hard to get that balanced close\nenough that people can approximate optimal strategy as 'just tell the truth'.\nAnd you haven't at all argued that the change in this cost over time would be\naway from balance rather than towards, which is what unstable means.\n\n2V_V10y\n\nthere doesn't seem to be any obvious negative feedback to keep the balance\nstable.\n\n0Luke_A_Somers10y\n\nFirst off, you said it was unstable, which means there would have to be\npositive feedback to make it UN-stable. Secondly, it seems to me that there is\na source of negative feedback in that if people want to be able to express\nstronger preferences themselves, they might tolerate stronger preferences\nexpressed from others. Edited to Add Clarification: We are attempting to\ncalibrate the social cost of expressing strong preferences. The strength of\npreferences expressed will vary in normal encounters due to actual variance of\npreferences, variance in peoples' habits of how to express those preferences,\nand variance in details of delivery. If you would like to be freer to express\nyour preferences more strongly, you can dial back the social costs you\npersonally impose on others for expressing strong preferences. If they shift\nup their expressed preferences in response, then either you may as well or\nthey are being hypocritical. Conversely, if you think others are expressing\npreferences rather too strongly, first back off the strength of your own\nexpressed preferences towards the desired level and then begin imposing more\nsocial costs on strong expressions of preferences. Either do this gradually so\npeople hardly notice, or out in the open, negotiated. Both options seem fairly\nintuitive and natural to me, though of course either one will itself impose\nsocial costs. Social skills help a lot in mitigating these costs.\n\n0V_V10y\n\nYou don't need a positive feedback to have instability. Which means that there\nis an incentive to overstate preferences.\n\n0Luke_A_Somers10y\n\nYes you do. Like, rigid pendulum at the top of its swing, F = +kx. That's\npositive feedback. I suppose you can get around this requirement with discrete\ntimesteps or other hackery, but classically speaking positive feedback <->\ninstability. ... differentially so, from a starting point of understated\npreferences, so that's a correcting change.\n\n0V_V10y\n\nan unbiased random walk sufficies.\n\n4Luke_A_Somers10y\n\nOkay, so that's the definition of 'unstable' you were using. You've now taken\ncare of the nitpick and left the main thrust of the argument unaddressed.\n(edited for spelling)\n\n0V_V10y\n\nCan you rephrase the the main thrust of the argument?\n\n0Luke_A_Somers10y\n\nAll right.

What do you want? So I can say yes or no.\"\n\nI think we have to identify in which environment each of those methods work\nbest and use the appropriate strategy. That would be rational. Some thoughts:\n\n  * Tell is expensive (on both parties, but more on the teller) but allows quick establishment of rapport. It is suitable if initial trust has been established or can be assumed (e.g. in a date or in a rationalists meetup).\n\n  * Ask is cheap and efficient but puts a burden on longer relationships (any kind). Use it in highly dynamic situations or if you are under time or ressource constraints aka stress. Do not use it for longer time spans.\n\n  * Guess is extremely cheap on the receiver end but expensive on the teller. It is inefficient in situations where Ask wins but it is efficient where rules and norms are many and well-known as it minimizes conflict and overall cost.

We all know each other's expectations because we grew up\ntogether, and we all know how to communicate messages to one another\nimplicitly, in ways that allow for a request to be turned down without the\nneed for explicit rejection and all the emotional consequences of that, and we\nmake use of that shared context in our daily interactions to reduce social\nfriction.\n\nOf course, it makes life difficult for outsiders who interact with us, and\nhaven't grown up with that context, and therefore don't know how to\ncommunicate messages implicitly in our culture, and don't know how to\ninterpret the implicit messages we send them. Outsiders are either mute or\nboorish (or perhaps both).\n\nConversely, Guess/Hint culture works really poorly in culturally heterogenous\nenvironments, when basically everyone is an outsider.\n\nI observe that culturally heterogenous environments are a lot more common in\nthe world than they were, say, 200 years ago; advances in transportation and\ncommunication tech probably account for that.\n\nSo that's one factor that seems relevant. (Of course, one could apply your\nargument again to claim that cultural heterogeneity is a new development and\ntherefore suspect, and it's probably optimal for us to live in small isolated\ntribes.)\n\nReply\n\n7simplicio10y\n\nGood point. But I wonder whether, when two Guess culture variants collide in a\nheterogeneous society, it's better to (a) switch to Ask culture, or (b) adopt\nthe dominant culture's Guess dialect. I would suspect the latter, because I\nthink most people feel more at home in an alien status hierarchy than they do\nin an alien status hierarchy pretending it isn't one (a somewhat uncharitable\ngloss of Ask culture).\n\n7TheOtherDave10y\n\nHonestly, I think it's a weirdly constructed question. It seems more than a\nlittle like asking, when two linguistic communities collide in a\nlinguistically heterogenous society, whether it's better to (a) develop a\ncreole for communication purposes, or (b) adopt the dominant culture's\nlanguage. Sure, b will lead to easier communication if we can do it. But if we\ncan all speak the same language, what exactly did I mean when I called this a\ncollision of linguistic communities in the first place? I have had the\nexperience of trying to operate within an alien Guess/Hint culture. It's\nfrustrating. I am aware of what's going on at a high level -- there are cues\nbeing sent and expected that I'm unaware of and can't recognize, and nobody is\nwilling to explain what the cues are, and might well not even know. But\nknowing that doesn't help. Sure, it would have helped if I just switched to\ntheir dialect. But of course I couldn't do that, since I didn't know their\ndialect. Given that, it would have helped me if we could all have switched to\nAsk norms instead. It would have made me less of a boorish outsider, and made\nit easier for me to communicate. But of course, there's no particular reason\nwhy they should have wanted to help me in this way. FWIW, I agree that Ask\nculture has this property. Then again, I would claim Guess and Hint culture\nhave this property as well, and I think it's orthogonal to the aspects of\nAsk/Guess/Hint culture I've been discussing.\n\n7christopherj10y\n\nHint culture acts as a secret handshake that will reliably detect outsiders\n(they can't possibly learn the rules without identifying themselves as\noutsiders for a period of years).

The proper way to\naddress them would be in the third person, as in \"would the vicar care for\nanother cup of tea?\" And an old woman of whom you knew nothing might be\nrespectfully addressed as \"m\u00f8r\" (\"mother\"). Things have come to a pretty pass\nwhen knights can roam the countryside saying \"ni!\" to defenceless old women.\nPerhaps one of the Swedes here can say whether this is true?\n\n2Stefan_Schubert10y\n\nHehe. :) I never heard about it. Here is something I found when googling: \"The\nKnights who say Ni are rumoured to be connected to the mock subtitles in the\nopening credits which advertise Sweden. In the Swedish language, \"Ni\" is\nsecond person plural (the equivalence of the English plural \"you\") and used to\nbe the proper form for adressing people outisde your circle of family and\nfriends. This was however abandoned during the late 1960-ies/early 1970-ies in\nthe so-called \"du-reform\" (\"du\" being the second person singular form).\nAccording to the rumor, the joke with the knights saying \"Ni\" and people's\nnegative reaction to it is a mockery of how the \"ni\" form was rejected by\nalmost all Swedes, and thus no longer acceptable. Over the years the Pythons\nhave gone back and forth between denying that the rumour is true, and\nconfirming that it is indeed true.\"\nhttp://www.moviemistakes.com/film846/corrections Here is another source.\nhttp://blog.gashead.me/why-did-the-knights-who-say-ni-say-ni/\n\n2Stefan_Schubert10y\n\nEgalitarianism, I'd say (which probably is correlated with trust). In Sweden\nthe switch from the plural (\"ni\") to the singular (\"du\") form of you was done\nquite deliberately, as described in this article: \"The beginning of the du-\nreformen is associated with Bror Rexed, the then head of the National Board of\nHealth and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen), who in his welcome speech to the staff\nin 1967 announced that he would address everyone as du, increasing the effects\nof the reform and bringing it to a more frequent use. The actual reform had\nstarted earlier, including the amended language in the major newspaper Dagens\nNyheter. It was seen as a reform in a democratic and egalitarian direction.\nFirst, authorities and influential circles tried rehabilitating the Ni in a\nso-called ni-reform, but most people could not bring themselves to feel civil\nusing that. Then, almost overnight and dubbed the \"du reform\", the system\nbroke down and du (noted as informal above) became the accepted way of\naddressing any one person except royalty.\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du-\nreformen\n\n2wedrifid10y\n\nThis pattern seems a little off, I wonder if you intended to convey the\nimplicit caveat that you touched on in the preceding paragraph or if your\nactual pattern is a bit different to what your analysis would suggest.\nStrangers who for whatever reason you need to avoid offending (anticipate\nfuture interactions or believe they could harm you now) need the guessing.\nStrangers like, say, salespeople or various forms of gatekeepers like doctors\nare far better treated with Ask (especially if a Guess gambit isn't giving\ndesired results). Or do you give dispensing-NPCs \"guess\" treatment too?\n\n3Kaj_Sotala10y\n\nRight, my comment was mostly referring to people in the \"anticipate future\ninteractions or believe they could harm you now\" category. Interactions with\n\"dispensing-NPCs\" went into such a different mental category in my head that\nthe need to explicitly exclude them didn't occur to me.\n\n5David_Gerard10y\n\nI have frequently noticed that when geeks advocate untrammelled honesty in\ncommunication, they mean sending it; the same geeks reliably hit the roof when\nthey receive it.

I spent decades learning the intricacies of\nNorth-European politeness and I think I've finally more or less got it. Now\nthat I've learned it, I might be motivated to think that there is some actual\npoint to all this dancing around! I like Stefan's idea of connecting guess/ask\nwith wait/interrupt. We might also want to bring the guilt/shame axis into\nthis. It sounds like ask/interrupt/shame should make for a more honest and\nefficient society. The guess/wait/guilt stuff sounds pretty frakked up when it\nis described. But in practice it seems to be correlated with the best places\nto live in.

The shirt ironing example suggests as much. Words are sufficient\nto express ideas, but they don't always efficiently relay all encoded\ninformation. To accomplish this - to fill in the missing bits - empathy can be\na powerful facilitator. Perhaps the Guess cultures we find toxic are those in\nwhich this expectation of empathetic engagement has mutated into an\nexpectation to anticipate and manage others' emotions.\n\nReply\n\n1sauber3y\n\nThinking a bit more about this, in an unhealthy Guess culture, empathy starts\nto become problematic when fewer and fewer bits are provided until empathy is\nexpected to essentially replace a string of zeros. Eventually, the expectation\nis not just that you\u2019re supposed to anticipate what another person is thinking\nand feeling, but you\u2019re required to act on it. You have a responsibility for\nit, until finally you bear the responsibility for how they think and feel.\nThis evolution occurs when the distinction between people as discrete agents\nis blurred.
