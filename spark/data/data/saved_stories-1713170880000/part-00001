I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a lot of fun wherever I go. Since I\u2019m\ntrying to be very intentional about my college decision process, I\u2019ve\ninterviewed close to twenty students. And for the most part, all of them are\nhaving a great time!\n\nThis scares me. A lot.\n\nIf I can go anywhere and have a great time, then what should I choose my\ncollege based on? Ranking? Prestige? Food? Campus? Job opportunities? Cost?\n\nAfter thinking more about this problem, I realized that although I\u2019ll have fun\nwherever I\u2019ll go, it will also change me as a person. More specifically, I\nthink that each college will shift my values in a different way.\n\nValue shift is when, through one event or another, a person changes what they\nvalue. Their past self, seeing their future self with different values, might\nthink \u201coh no, I have become what I sought to destroy.\u201d Milder versions also\nexist. The classic example is what happens to a parent after they have a\nchild. If they had a value of \u201cstay alive\u201d before, it (usually) changes to\n\u201ckeep child alive then stay alive.\u201d Yet if you had told them in the past that\nthey would sacrifice themself for their child, they might not be okay with it\n(or they might be, in which case a value shift did not happen). The next\nquestion would be: why did you take an action (having children) that would\nshift your terminal values?\n\nSo when I look out over the imaginary cause and effect tree of me choosing\ncolleges, I see further. Not only do I see the effects of\n\n  1. how I will spend the next four years?\n  2. what people I will meet that I will know for the rest of my life?\n  3. what skills will I learn for the rest of my life?\n  4. what meta-skills (or mannerisms/habits of being) will I pick up?\n\nI also see the effect of\n\n  5. what will I be motivated to do with my life?\n\nI worry that the last one is the most important one, yet also the most\noverlooked. Naively, I could say that my future self will obviously be wiser\nthan my present self in choosing what to do with my life so I should not worry\nat all. After all, it has all of my experience plus four extra years! Jacob in\nfour years literally was me who was thinking these thoughts. Of course he\nwon\u2019t do something stupid.\n\nAnd if I were perfectly rational agent, I\u2019d say that this would be true. But\nI\u2019m not, I\u2019m a human. I have messy desires. Most (almost all?) of what I\nbelieve is not reasoned from first principles but instead picked up from my\nenvironment. Paul Graham says that cities have certain vibes that subtly\nchange your values when you live in them. According to him, New York tells you\nto make money, Boston tells you to be smarter, and the Bay Area tells you to\nbe more powerful. I suspect colleges have similar qualities. If all my friends\nare doing something, it will be insanely hard to not do it. And college is a\nhell of a strong optimizer! 41% of Harvard grads go into consulting or\nfinance. Heck, I have an immediate family member who got sucked into\nconsulting for ten years before realizing it wasn\u2019t what he wanted to do. I\ndon\u2019t want to spend ten years figuring this out.\n\nI hope you can now understand why \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll have fun at college!\u201d\nis so scary. Of course I\u2019ll have fun (I\u2019m lucky enough to have a pretty high\nhedonic set point), but will it corrupt my values in a way that I would\ncurrently regret? Maybe.\n\n# Solutions\n\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nAn easy solution would be to make a list of all the things that my future self\ncannot do no matter what. I could put \u201cNEVER do consulting or finance on it.\u201d\nThis strategy has a few nice benefits. If I always kept commitments to myself,\nthen I could make even stronger commitments in the future. Austin Chen wrote\nan argument for this called \u201cWhat We Owe the Past,\u201d which I think is pretty\nfunny. When he was 17, he made a commitment to go to church every Sunday, and\nhe still does even though he has a \u201c... a more complicated relationship with\nthe Catholic church.\u201d\n\nThis method seems pretty good, right? I think there are at least three ways it\nbreaks down, some philosophical and some practical.\n\nWhen making an acausal trade, as this method calls for, or really a trade of\nany kind, both parties need to benefit. If you only do this method once, the\npast agent is the only one that benefits. It knows that its values will be\npreserved into the future. But the future agent does not benefit; it is just\nbeholden to its past self.\n\nThe only way that the future agent benefits is if we do an iterated version of\nthis method. That way, it becomes the past agent and it then gets to impose\nits values on a future agent again. Since a trade only works when both parties\nget something, I would have to do this a bunch to reap the rewards of\nconsistency. But since this is so demanding of the future agent, I would not\ntake it lightly and would probably only do it a few times, which would kind of\ndefeat the point.\n\nEnough with the acausal trade philosophy. Practically, this breaks down\nbecause myself in the future might have more experience and information than\nmyself in the past. What if I learn that consulting is actually the greatest\nthing ever? And I get a really convincing argument? Should I still not do it?\nTo understand this point, we need to be clearer about what is a value?\n\nUp until now, I\u2019ve just been using value to refer loosely to anything that an\niteration of an agent believes or wants. But there seems to be a hierarchy of\ntypes of value. At the bottom level are facts and beliefs about the world,\nwhich I would pretty much never want to hold static. On the second level are\nwants. These are things like \u201cI want to make a lot of money\u201d or \u201cI want to\nhave good relationships\u201d or \u201cI want to help people.\u201d On the third and highest\nlevel are things like \u201cI want my future self to pick the best values according\nto a certain set of meta-values.\u201d You still need to specify the meta-values of\ncourse, but you do get more flexibility. I think I\u2019d probably not want any\n\u2018values\u2019 on the first and second levels, but only want ones on the third. That\nis, I\u2019d want my future self to choose his values based on a certain set of\nmeta values. (Of course, I\u2019d still have to worry about the meta values\nshifting.)\n\nFinally, if you keep adding strict prohibitions onto your future self, you are\nlimiting all your future options. With no way to amend them, it essentially\namounts to adding more and more constraints to your future behavior. After not\nthat long, some are bound to contradict and then the whole system breaks down.\n\nEven if we bite all these bullets, there is still something weird to me about\nthe contractual nature of it all. This is not some stranger I\u2019m trying to make\na deal with, it\u2019s myself. There should be a gentler, nicer, way to achieve\nthis same goal.\n\nIf agents have more mutual trust, they don\u2019t need to form a rigid contract\nbeforehand. They can negotiate a contract with each other by communicating\ncausally. The reason this method doesn\u2019t work in this case is because if you\ntried to negotiate, your past self could not speak!\n\nWhat if we could find a way to have a gentler interaction that is less\ncontractual without silencing the past self?\n\nWhen you read, you are essentially having a one-way conversation with the\nauthor. So, I could actually just write up a long document explaining all the\nreasons why I think that my future self should do something (when I predict it\nwill have a big choice). Even better, I should write another document with all\nmy current values. Then, when making any decision, my future self should take\na look at these documents and take them into account. But why would it be\nmotivated to do this? Decision theoretically, it would be motivated because it\nknows that it might want a self even further in the future to take into\naccount its preferences. However, as stated above, I don\u2019t think this will\nactually work in practice since I\u2019m not planning to do this that many times.\nGoing along with the \u201cgentler\u201d reasoning, it should want to do it because it\nhas camaraderie with its past self. It should want it\u2019s past self to be happy\nand it knows that to make it happy, it should take its preferences into\naccount.\n\nA document, however, is still not really a conversation since it only goes one\nway. To make this really good, I should make a chatbot with a custom voice\ntrained on my voice (using ElevenLabs or something similar) and then feed it\nmy documents and ask it to discuss the decision with my future self. Then,\nboth sides can communicate causally and have an equal say.\n\nWhile at WARP, I talked to some more people about this and came up with even\nmore ideas for giving my future self more information about what past\niterations of itself wanted:\n\nA way that could be even more salient than text is taking a video of me\ntalking about my current values, what I want for the future, and what I would\nlike my future self to do. I plan to do this at least once a year with the\nfirst one happening in the next 2 weeks. I would then re-watch these videos\nyearly and whenever I had a big decision to make.\n\nAnother method that I have started using is daily journaling. Besides the\npsychological benefits that come with journaling, it also will provide me with\na plethora of information about what I currently value for my future self to\ngo back upon and learn from.\n\n# Concrete Application\n\nLastly, I want to share another reason I\u2019ve been thinking about this besides\ncollege: I\u2019m considering taking a gap year and working at tech\nstartup(s)/doing research/independently learning stuff. When I mentioned this\nto my dad, he said that he worried that I would have such a good time and make\nenough money that I would get stuck in a local maximum and not want to go to\ncollege if I did this. He then claimed that this would be bad for \u2018social\nreasons.\u2019 My response was that if I did this, I would take into account his\nconcern at the end of the gap year when deciding if I should go to college.\nBut to actually do this, I would have to make sure that I was working from a\nclean(ish) headspace without any value-shift from the types of people I would\nbe around in startups. So as I forsee the possibility that I will have to make\nthe decision, I think it will be wise to use some of the above techniques to\ncombat some of the bad value drift also.\n\nConcretely, I will use all of these methods now (maybe except the chatbot) to\ncreate a treasure trove of information about what my current self wants and\nvalues. Then at the end of the gap year (if I decide to take one), I will take\ninto account all of this information before making any big decisions.\n\n# Benefits Right Now\n\nAs I\u2019ve been implementing some of the above methods, I\u2019ve realized that they\nhave an unexpected benefit for even my current self: it is easier to make\nbolder decisions. I no longer have to worry that my future self will go astry\non me, so I can make bolder decisions that will leave my future self in a\nposition where it could do things that are totally against my current\npreferences, but won\u2019t. For example, I feel more comfortable taking a gap year\nknowing that my future self will see all the media I\u2019ve left it in the past\nsaying that it should probably try college after the year is up, even if it\nreally thinks it is a bad idea. (I currently think trying college is a good\nidea.)\n\nThanks to many people for discussing this with me.\n\nSubscribe\n\nFeel to reach out to me at jacoblevgw at gmail\n\n", "frontpage": false}
