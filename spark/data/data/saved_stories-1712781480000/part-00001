Training on a corpus of human-scale in size (100M words), we\n> iteratively trained transformer language models on systematically\n> manipulated corpora and then evaluated their learning of a particular rare\n> grammatical phenomenon: the English Article+Adjective+Numeral+Noun (AANN)\n> construction (``a beautiful five days''). We first compared how well this\n> construction was learned on the default corpus relative to a counterfactual\n> corpus in which the AANN sentences were removed. AANNs were still learned\n> better than systematically perturbed variants of the construction. Using\n> additional counterfactual corpora, we suggest that this learning occurs\n> through generalization from related constructions (e.g., ``a few days''). An\n> additional experiment showed that this learning is enhanced when there is\n> more variability in the input. Taken together, our results provide an\n> existence proof that models learn rare grammatical phenomena by\n> generalization from less rare phenomena.
