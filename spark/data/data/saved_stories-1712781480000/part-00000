But over the past 48 hours, dozens of\nnew domain names have been registered that demonstrate how this change could\nbe used to craft convincing phishing links \u2014 such as fedetwitter[.]com, which\nis currently rendered as fedex.com in tweets.\n\nThe message currently displayed when one visits carfatwitter.com, which\nTwitter/X will now display as carfax.com in tweets and messages.\n\nA search at DomainTools.com shows at least 60 domain names have been\nregistered over the past two days for domains ending in \u201ctwitter.com,\u201d\nalthough research so far shows the majority of these domains have been\nregistered \u201cdefensively\u201d by private individuals to prevent the domains from\nbeing purchased by scammers.\n\nThose include carfatwitter.com, which Twitter/X will now truncate to\ncarfax.com when the domain appears in user messages or tweets. Visiting this\ndomain currently displays a message that begins, \u201cAre you serious, X Corp?\u201d\n\nThe same message is on other newly registered domains, including\ngoodrtwitter.com (goodrx.com), neobutwitter.com (neobux.com), roblotwitter.com\n(roblox.com), square-enitwitter.com (square-enix.com) and yandetwitter.com\n(yandex.com). The message left on these domains indicates they were\ndefensively registered by a user on Mastodon whose bio says they are a systems\nadmin/engineer. That profile has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nA number of these new domains including \u201ctwitter.com\u201d appear to be registered\ndefensively by Twitter/X users in Japan. The domain netflitwitter.com\n(netflix.com, to Twitter/X users) now displays a message saying it was\n\u201cacquired to prevent its use for malicious purposes,\u201d along with a Twitter/X\nusername.\n\nThe domain mentioned at the beginning of this story \u2014 fedetwitter.com \u2014\nredirects users to the blog of a Japanese technology enthusiast. A user with\nthe handle \u201camplest0e\u201d appears to have registered space-twitter.com, which\nTwitter/X users will now see as the CEO\u2019s \u201cspace-x.com.\u201d The domain\n\u201cametwitter.com\u201d already redirects to the real americanexpress.com.\n\nSome of the domains registered recently and ending in \u201ctwitter.com\u201d currently\ndo not resolve and contain no useful contact information in their registration\nrecords. Those include firefotwitter[.]com (firefox.com), ngintwitter[.]com\n(nginx.com), and webetwitter[.]com (webex.com).\n\nThe domain setwitter.com, which Twitter/X will currently render as \u201csex.com,\u201d\nredirects to this blog post warning about the recent changes and their\npotential use for phishing.\n\nSean McNee, vice president of research and data at DomainTools, told\nKrebsOnSecurity it appears Twitter/X did not properly limit its redirection\nefforts.\n\n\u201cBad actors could register domains as a way to divert traffic from legitimate\nsites or brands given the opportunity \u2014 many such brands in the top million\ndomains end in x, such as webex, hbomax, xerox, xbox, and more,\u201d McNee said.\n\u201cIt is also notable that several other globally popular brands, such as Rolex\nand Linux, were also on the list of registered domains.\u201d\n\nThe apparent oversight by Twitter/X was cause for amusement and amazement from\nmany former users who have migrated to other social media platforms since the\nnew CEO took over. Matthew Garrett, a lecturer at U.C. Berkeley\u2019s School of\nInformation, summed up the Schadenfreude thusly:\n\n\u201cTwitter just doing a \u201credirect links in tweets that go to x.com to\ntwitter.com instead but accidentally do so for all domains that end x.com like\neg spacex.com going to spacetwitter.com\u201d is not absolutely the funniest thing\nI could imagine but it\u2019s high up there.\u201d\n\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday 10th of April 2024 10:28 AM\n\nOther\n\nDomainTools.com Mastodon Matthew Garrett phishing Sean McNee Twitter.com X.com\n\n## 2 thoughts on \u201cTwitter\u2019s Clumsy Pivot to X.com Is a Gift to Phishers\u201d\n\n  1.
