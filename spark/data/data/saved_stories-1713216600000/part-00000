The next step in his \u201cspeed-running the chip stack\u201d to-do\nlist is designing a GPU from scratch. When finished this project is destined\nfor production via Matthew Venn\u2019s TinyTapeout 6.\n\nWe\u2019ve reported on enthusiast DIY CPU designs previously, as well as DIY GPU\nprojects. However, some of those feats have eaten through years of spare time\nfor the people involved. Majmudar must be on vacation and spending all his\nsurplus time on this \u201cspeed run\u201d project to have gotten as far as he has \u201cfrom\nscratch.\u201d\n\n> I've spent the past ~2 weeks trying to make a chip from scratch with no\n> prior experience.

You can click and read through all the steps leading up to the\ncurrent GPU focus via the embedded Tweet, above. We\u2019ve also bullet-pointed the\nspeed run steps which have been completed to date, below.\n\n  * Learning the fundamentals of chip architecture \u2013 a strong understanding is a critical foundation\n  * Learning the fundamentals of chip fabrication \u2013 materials, wafer prep, patterning and packaging\n  * Starting electronic design automation by making a CMOS transistor, layer-by-layer\n  * Creating my first full circuit in Verilog \u2013 \u201cmy first experience with programming hardware using software.\u201d\n  * Implementing simulation & formal verification for my circuit\n  * Designing my first full chip layout \u2013 designing and optimizing using OpenLane, which is an open-source EDA tool\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\n(Image credit: Adam Majmudar )\n\n(Image credit: Adam Majmudar )\n\n(Image credit: Adam Majmudar )\n\n(Image credit: Adam Majmudar )\n\n(Image credit: Adam Majmudar )\n\nAs we mentioned in the intro, the significant step that Majmudar now faces is\ndesigning a GPU from scratch. He knows this will be a difficult task and\nadmits that, after initial investigations, it is harder than expected. The\nfledgling chip designer explains that there simply aren\u2019t the learning\nresources online for building a GPU. \u201cBecause GPU companies are all trying to\nkeep their secrets from each other, most of the GPU architecture data is all\nproprietary and closed source,\u201d the engineer finds.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nDespite this hurdle, Majmudar says the big GPU-makers\u2019 secrecy has made this\npart of the project \u201cway more fun for me.\u201d Interestingly, Anthropic\u2019s Claude\nOpus AI tools have been useful during this GPU designing stage. \u201cI've been\nproposing my ideas for how each unit must work to Claude, and then somehow it\nwill guide me toward the right implementation approaches which I can then go\nand confirm with open-source repos,\u201d explained the engineer. However, he\nobserved that \u201cif I search some of the things publicly, nothing shows up which\nis a testament to how well hidden the implementation details are.\u201d\n\nAfter taking just two weeks or so to get through three out of five legs of his\nspeed run, the above concerns expressed regarding GPUs might make readers\nworry that Majmudar may have hit a speed bump, a snag, or even a brick wall.\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, as he optimistically predicts that his GPU\ndesign will be shipping \u201cin the next few days,\u201d and a cut-down version sent to\nbe taped out.\n\nIt may be well worth keeping an eye open for this engineer\u2019s next updates.\nHowever, we know it can take quite some time between submitting work to\nprojects like TinyTapeout and the production run. The maker of the Rickroll\nASIC, for example, said there were nine months between submitting his design\nand receiving the silicon.

The idea that one Monday morning this guy\ndecided to build a cpu from scratch with no knowledge and then 14 days later\nits ready to go seems unlikely to me.\n\nGenius level inteligence or down playing their own knowledge and experience? I\nbelieve that people go to university for years to learn the skills and\nknowledge to do this.\n\nReply\n\n  * Conor Stewart\n\nLearning things quickly isn't always a good thing.\n\n> Creating my first full circuit in Verilog \u2013 \u201cmy first experience with\n> programming hardware using software.\u201d\n\nThis is an example, by using verilog you are not programming hardware using\nsoftware, verilog is not a software programming language, it is a hardware\ndescription language. Yes you could argue they mean using software to\nsynthesize and implement the hardware but I doubt this is what they mean. Too\nmany people, especially software engineers which they claim to be, treat\nverilog and VHDL as just another programming language.\n\nSomething definitely seems off too, it would be hard but possible to go from\nno knowledge to a basic CPU in two weeks, however it would not be any more\nthan a demonstration, there is pretty much no way they went from no knowledge\nto an actually useful CPU in just two weeks unless they copied others work.\nBased on the fact they mention using some kind of AI and open source projects\nfor learning this might be the case.\n\nIt could also just be that this is an awful design but it does technically\nwork, maybe something like Ben Eater's breadboard computer that I believe only\nhad 16 bytes of memory and was 8 bit. It does work well enough to run a simple\nprogram like incrementing a counter or performing basic calculations but it is\nnot useful in any way other than just for learning.\n\nIf I remember bitluni's video on his tiny tapeout design then the cells they\nwere allowed were very small and he pretty much implemented a ROM and he\ncouldn't manage to fit much in, so it ended up being a very small ROM and even\nthen used up 4 of the available cells (I think bitluni was given a chance just\nbecause they had space to fill so that may be why he was allowed 4 cells, also\nhe wasn't given much notice or time to finish it which also probably also\nmeans it was just to fill space). So making a CPU within tiny tapeout, it\neither has to have no on board memory or it is a very very basic CPU with very\nlittle memory.\n\nI think there is probably a reason that people haven't implemented usable CPUs\n(like RISC-V) on tiny tapeout before.\n\nEdit: looking at tiny tapeout 6, someone may be trying to make a RISC-V EC\nprocessor on it but I'm not sure how functional it will be.\n\nReply\n\n  * rfdevil\n\n> Conor Stewart said:\n>\n> Learning things quickly isn't always a good thing.\n>\n> This is an example, by using verilog you are not programming hardware using\n> software, verilog is not a software programming language, it is a hardware\n> description language.

As far as I can tell, he just took some circuits that others created\n(e.g., debouncer, pwm) and hooked them up to create a 3 channel LED controller\nthat can output a pulse signal. That's it. He did go through the rest of the\nflow (synthesis, STA, P&R, etc.) but it seems to be the core only, there's no\npads or anything to connect the chip to a package, it's just the core logic.\n\nHe has not sent the design for fabrication (it would be rejected anyway) and\ndoesn't seem to have a plan to do so. His plan is to now jump to reverse\nengineering a full GPU and tape that out. I give him an A+ for effort and self\nmotivation, but he is not anywhere near as far along the path of designing any\nkind of real processor that he seems to think he is.\n\nReply\n\n  * CmdrShepard\n\n> artk2219 said:\n>\n> I wonder what the specs are and if he's actually gotten any code to run on\n> it.\n\nThis article sports a clickbait headline which is as misleading as the one\nabout the developer \"hacking\" Denuvo DRM.\n\nThe headline says \"Engineer creates CPU from scratch in two weeks\" and burries\nthe lede again by leaving the most important detail for the end.\n\nCPU has not been created -- it has only been designed. We don't even know if\nhis design was validated and whether he wants to tape it out, let alone what\nkind of CPU he was designing (i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit? RISC or something else?\nHow many registers? Size of instruction set?).\n\nWe don't have ballpark figures on the node size it will be made in, how many\nCPUs will be made, how much it's going to cost, as well as what are expected\npower consumption, working frequency, and performance.\n\nWe don't know whether he already has a dev toolchain for it nor whether he\neven intends to follow up and write some code for it.\n\nWe don't get any information about the Tiny Tapeout 6 but are left to research\nthat on our own.\n\nOh, and we don't get any information about what university this guy has\nfinished if any. People studying computer science on university of electrical\nengineering in my country get to design their own RISC CPU as part of their\nstudy so this is maybe nothing more than putting that kind of knowledge to\nuse.\n\nTL;DR -- Instead of providing us with useful info like what I just enumerated\nabove, this vapid, pointless, article does literally no effort to answer any\nof the questions its lack of facts raises.\n\nReply\n\n  * CmdrShepard\n\n> rfdevil said:\n>\n> If you check the twitter thread, he didn't create a CPU, or anything close\n> to one.
