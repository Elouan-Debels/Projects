Now It\u2019s Been Acquired\n\nThe app that turned green chat bubbles blue has been acquired by Automattic,\nthe parent company of Wordpress and Tumblr.\n\nIllustration: Hector Roqueta Rivero/Getty Images\n\nLate last year the messaging app Beeper raised the ire of Apple when it found\na way to recreate Apple\u2019s infamous \u201cblue bubble\u201d messaging on Android. Apple\nlater hobbled Beeper, but it\u2019s not an entirely unhappy ending: The startup has\nbeen acquired in a deal valued at $125 million.\n\nFounded three years ago, Beeper is being snapped up by Automattic, the\nrespected parent company of WordPress, the blogging and content management\nplatform, as well as Tumblr, which it acquired in 2019. Beeper cofounder Eric\nMigicovsky said that the company will continue to exist as a stand-alone\nproduct within Automattic, and that all of Beeper\u2019s 27 employees\u2014who, like\nAutomattic\u2019s employees, are entirely remote\u2014will be absorbed into the larger\nentity.\n\nExact financial terms of the acquisition weren\u2019t disclosed. Matt Mullenweg,\nthe founder of Automattic, is on a sabbatical and chasing the eclipse and\nwasn\u2019t available to comment. According to Migicovsky, Beeper will be part of\nAutomattic\u2019s broader strategy to offer more messaging features. Automattic\nfirst invested in Beeper in 2022, and late last year snatched up another\nmessaging app, Texts, for $50 million.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThe acquisition comes on the heels of a highly publicized battle between\nBeeper and Apple, in which Beeper tried to bridge the gap between Android\nmessaging and iMessage but was ultimately thwarted. It was unable to monetize\nits app and, with 30,000 users as of writing, hadn\u2019t reached critical mass.\n\n\u201cBeeper is not an \u2018easy mode\u2019 company, and one of the things I\u2019ve learned\nthrough this experience is that you\u2019ve got to know who your friends are,\u201d\nMigicovsky said. \u201cMatt [Mullenweg] and Automattic have been extremely\nsupportive, and as we talked about the future of chat and messaging, it was\njust clear that he and I saw eye-to-eye on this.\u201d\n\nBeeper was founded in 2020 by Migicovsky and Brad Murray. Migicovsky had\npreviously founded Pebble, an early 2010s smartwatch company that appealed to\nthe nerd crowd for its open source approach to software and innovative use of\nan E-Ink display. (The Beeper deal is, by all accounts, a better outcome than\nthe Pebble acquisition in 2016, when the flailing smartwatch company was sold\nto Fitbit.)\n\nCourtesy of Beeper\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nWatch the Total Solar Eclipse Online Here\n\nReece Rogers\n\n  * Politics\n\nThe Solar Eclipse Is the Super Bowl for Conspiracists\n\nDavid Gilbert\n\n  * Business\n\nHow I Became a Python Programmer\u2014and Fell Out of Love With the Machine\n\nScott Gilbertson\n\n  * Security\n\nA Vigilante Hacker Took Down North Korea\u2019s Internet. Now He\u2019s Taking Off His\nMask\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, Migicovsky became fixated on fragmented\nmessaging\u2014the generally recognized fact that most people have to use a variety\nof different apps to keep in touch with their contacts. Migicovsky and Murray\nstarted building a service that would collate all messaging in one app\ncontainer, using an open source, decentralized messaging protocol called\nMatrix.\n\nBut the holy grail for Migicovsky was to create texting equality between\nAndroid and iOS. Normally when an Android user sends a message to an iOS\ndevice, it shows up as a green bubble, while blue bubbles are reserved for\niMessage only. Beeper on Android would instead send secure, encrypted, \u201cblue\nbubble\u201d messages to iOS devices.\n\nThe standard version of Beeper used hundreds of Mac mini computers as relay\npoints so that Android messages to iOS devices wouldn\u2019t default to SMS. But\nMigicovsky and his team later created a forked \u201cmini\u201d version of their app\nthat reverse engineered the way iOS notifications work and let the messages\nflow between the Beeper app itself and iOS Messages. The blue bubble was\nachieved. Migicovsky charged $2 per month for this Beeper Mini app at launch.\n\nNo sooner did Beeper Mini roll out in late November than Apple took steps to\nsquash it, citing security concerns. Migicovsky and his team scrambled to\ncreate workarounds, and made the app free in the interim. But by the end of\n2023 it was clear that Beeper Mini was an untenable product, although Beeper\nhad succeeded in raising awareness around Apple\u2019s tight grip over its\nsoftware.\n\nIn December more than a dozen watchdog and digital rights organizations called\non the Department of Justice and the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate\nApple for anticompetitive behavior. The DOJ\u2019s investigation into Apple was\nalready long in the works, but earlier this month that suit finally landed\u2014and\ncited green bubbles as an antitrust concern.\n\nBeeper was ultimately more of a symbol of the challenges faced by upstarts who\nchallenge the entrenched interests of Big Tech than it was a stand-alone\nproduct. But Migicovsky insists he\u2019s not disappointed in the results. He\u2019ll\ncontinue on at Automattic as the head of the Beeper product, and he says he\u2019s\nglad Beeper wasn\u2019t sold to a giant tech company. \u201cI think this at least\nintroduced another philosophy around anti-competitiveness, like a company can\nhave monopolies in some markets or specific parts of markets,\u201d Migicovsky\nsaid.\n\nBeeper\u2019s reliance on an open source protocol, Matrix, was also appealing to\nAutomattic. While usage of the Beeper app wasn\u2019t widespread, it had managed to\nsupport more than a dozen different messaging platforms within its app. In\nthis way it\u2019s similar to Texts, the other Automattic-owned messaging app,\nwhich aggregates messages from iPhone, WhatsApp, Signal, Messenger, Slack, and\nothers all in one container.\n\nMullenweg said in an interview with TechCrunch at the time of the Texts\nacquisition that he thinks too many technology services became \u201cclosed,\u201d and\nthat the \u201cpendulum is now swinging very hard in the other direction towards\nmore open standards.\u201d While WordPress is Automattic\u2019s most important product\nright now, Mullenweg has said that he thinks messages, not websites, could\nhave a bigger impact in the long run.\n\nAt the very least, Beeper gets to live another day, which is more than a lot\nof tech startups can say.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
