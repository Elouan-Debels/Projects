The color gamut coverages of 95% Rec. 2020 and 92%\nRec. 2020 can be achieved in B/G/R tandem WOLED with a moderate microcavity\nand B/YG tandem WOLED with a strong microcavity, respectively. We have also\nboosted the optical efficiency by 62% for the tandem B/YG WOLED using the\nhigh-order antinodes at optimal conditions. Such a WOLED microdisplay helps\nreduce the power consumption of virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR)\ndisplays while keeping a wide color gamut.\n\nKeywords:\n\ntandem white micro-OLED; high-order antinode; wide color gamut; virtual\nreality; mixed reality\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nOrganic light-emitting diodes (OLED) have been widely used in flat panel\ndisplays ranging from smartphones to televisions [1,2]. With the rapid\ndevelopment of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), conventional\nactive-matrix OLED on glass substrate cannot meet the high-resolution density\nrequirement because multiple thin film transistors (TFTs) are employed in each\npixel. To greatly increase resolution density, OLED-on-silicon (also called\nMicro-OLED) has been developed. Compared to liquid crystal displays (LCDs)\n[3,4,5], OLED-on-silicon exhibits a higher resolution density, higher native\ncontrast ratio, smaller form factor and faster response time. The US-based\ncorporation eMagin employed red, green, and blue (RGB) OLEDs to generate full\ncolor [6]. However, the fabrication of small pixel-sized (<10 \u03bcm) RGB OLEDs is\nrather challenging because of the shadow effect of fine metal masks [7], so\nsome other companies such as Sony [8] and Kopin focus on white OLED (WOLED)\nwith color filters. But the efficiency and color gamut are the bottlenecks due\nto wide emission spectra of WOLEDs and the absorption and crosstalk of the\ncolor filters.\n\nThe simplest architecture of WOLEDs is single stack. However, the efficiency\nand lifetime of the single-stack WOLED need to be improved because only about\n25% of the white light transmits through the absorptive color filters. Tandem\nWOLEDs [9,10,11,12] have been developed to improve the current efficiency.\nSeveral emission layers (EMLs) are connected by charge generation layers\n(CGLs), which usually consist of an n-p semiconductor heterojunction layer\n[13]. Spatially separated recombination zones not only increase the current\nefficiency but also enable the EMLs to be located at respectively optimal\npositions according to the microcavity design. For example, LG Display\nreported a 3-stack WOLED in 2024 and Kopin demonstrated a 2-stack WOLED with\nan average current efficiency of 12 cd/A [14]. More (e.g., 4 or 5) stacks are\npossible, as demonstrated by OLEDWorks [15], but the driving voltage is\ninevitably increased. Considering the balance between driving voltage and\ncurrent efficiency, in this paper, we adopt a 2-stack tandem WOLED structure.\nDespite a higher current efficiency enabled by the tandem structures, the\nbrightness and lifetime of the WOLEDs are still inadequate for waveguide-based\nAR applications [16]. In this aspect, III-nitride micro-LED [17] using\ninorganic materials exhibits enormous potential to achieve ultrahigh\nbrightness while maintaining a long lifetime. However, some issues, such as\ncost-effective manufacturing and decreased light efficiency due to sidewall\ndefects, remain to be overcome before its widespread adoption for AR glasses\ncan be realized. For VR applications, the required brightness for the light\nengine is around 10,000 nits, which the tandem OLEDoS can achieve relatively\neasily. For those reasons, we focus on investigating 2-stack tandem white\nmicro-OLEDs for VR applications. With the integration of several cameras in VR\nheadsets, mixed reality (MR) enabled by the video see-through function can\nallow users to interact with the ambient world. Besides a high efficiency and\nlow power consumption, a wide color gamut is crucial for high-performance\nVR/MR headsets. However, the color gamut of WOLEDs is usually smaller than\n100% DCI-P3 because of their wide emission spectra and the crosstalk of color\nfilters. For example, Sony reported a micro-OLED with a color gamut of 108%\nsRGB [8], and BOE developed a micro-OLED with a color gamut of 90% DCI-P3 in\nDisplay Week 2023. More recently, Apple Vision Pro exhibits a color gamut of\n92% DCI-P3.\n\nTo widen the color gamut while keeping a high efficiency, we propose a new\nstructure leveraging high-order antinodes and patterned microcavities. To\nanalyze and optimize the performance of the whole system, we first simulate\nthe performance of WOLED and pancake VR, and then introduce five independent\nvariables. We also investigate two kinds of 2-stack tandem WOLEDs: B/YG and\nB/G/R. The former refers to a blue emission layer (EML) and a yellow green\n(YG) EML; the latter represents a blue EML, a green EML, and a red EML. Our\nsimulation results prove that the proposed structure helps B/YG and B/G/R\nWOLEDs achieve a wider color gamut and higher efficiency. The color gamut\ncovers 95% Rec. 2020 and 92% Rec. 2020 for the B/G/R WOLED with a moderate\nmicrocavity and B/YG WOLED with a strong microcavity, respectively. To the\nbest of our knowledge, 95% Rec. 2020 is the largest reported color gamut for\nthe WOLEDs with color filters. For the B/YG WOLED, we can boost its efficiency\nby 62% using the high-order antinodes at optimal conditions. We foresee such\nan improved WOLED structure will contribute to a more vivid and efficient\nVR/MR display.\n\n## 2\\. System Modelling\n\nThe performance of a WOLED microdisplay is determined by several factors, such\nas thin metal film, capping layer, number, and the position of the EMLs and\ncolor filters. For this reason, the WOLED structure should be well optimized.\nMeanwhile, the display performance of the VR system is jointly determined by\nthe microdisplay light engine and the imaging optics. Thus, the WOLED\nmicrodisplay and pancake optical system will be modelled in sequence, forming\nthe basis for the optimization processes. All calculations regarding the\nentire system are implemented using home-made MATLAB codes.\n\n#### 2.1. Tandem WOLED Microdisplay\n\nThe proposed WOLED comprises several tandem EMLs. The simplest tandem\nstructure consists of one fluorescent blue EML and one phosphorescent yellow\nEML. Different from conventional OLED TVs, the driving voltage of the OLED\nmicrodisplay is limited by the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)\ncircuits. Therefore, a low operating voltage is critical for WOLED\nmicrodisplays. To improve the color gamut and transmittance through color\nfilters, we also leverage microcavities by introducing different optical\ncavity lengths for the red, green, and blue subpixels [18]. More specifically,\nindium tin oxide (ITO) or hole injection layer (HIL) can be patterned below\nthe common EMLs, as shown in Figure 1. Compared to conventional microcavity\ntandem white micro-OLEDs where all the EMLs are placed in the respective\nantinode positions, the Fabry\u2013Perot microcavity with patterned layers helps\nnarrow the emission spectra before the light transmits through the color\nfilters. More specifically, a certain EML is placed in the antinode position\nto create constructive interference while another EML is placed in the node\nposition to produce destructive interference.\n\nFigure 1. The schematic of tandem WOLED microdisplay with a patterned ITO or\nHIL layer below the common EMLs.\n\nTo quantify the WOLED performance in a VR system, total light efficiency\n(TLE), color gamut coverage (CGC), and color nonuniformity are considered. TLE\nis the product of following three parameters: external quantum efficiency\n(EQE), optical transmission efficiency of color filters (\u03b7_CF), and optical\nsystem efficiency (\u03b7_OSE), as Equation (1) indicates:\n\nMore explicitly, EQE is the product of outcoupling efficiency (\u03b7_OSE) and\ninternal quantum efficiency (IQE). The outcoupling efficiency can be\ncalculated by the rigorous dipole model. The transmission efficiency of color\nfilters can be calculated using Equation (2):\n\nwhere K (\u03b8, \u03bb) is the power dissipation density corresponding to different\nemission angles and wavelength, and T_CF (\u03bb) is the transmission spectra of\ncolor filters, as shown in Figure 2. A higher transmission efficiency will\ncontribute to a higher TLE. Equation (3) shows how to calculate the optical\nsystem efficiency (\u03b7_OSE):\n\nwhere \u03b7_c (\u03b8, p) is the collection efficiency depending on the emission angle\nand the location of the point source, which is calculated as the ratio of\npower collected by the eye pupil to the power emitted from the point source.\nAccording to Equation (3), \u03b7_OSE is impacted by the emission cone of the\ndisplay panel and the collection cone. The emission cone is usually much\nlarger than the collection cone, thus leading to low optical system\nefficiency. Thus, a moderate or strong microcavity helps narrow down the\nangular distributions of the emitting pixels and thereby increase the optical\nefficiency. To quantify the color performance in a VR system, the position-\ndependent spectrum is defined in Equation (4):\n\nFigure 2. The transmission spectra of color filters employed the simulations\nof micro-OLEDs.\n\nThen, the CGC of the central pixel (p = 0) is defined in Equation (5):\n\nwhere A_display is the triangular area of the display whose three vertices are\ncolor coordinates calculated from S_red (\u03bb, 0), S_green (\u03bb, 0), and S_blue (\u03bb,\n0), respectively, and A_standard is the triangular area of the reference\nstandard (DCI-P3 or Rec. 2020). Stronger microcavities help narrow the\nemission spectra, leading to a larger CGC. But the TLE may decrease and the\ncolor nonuniformity may increase. Lastly, the color nonuniformity is defined\nas the color difference between the central pixel and the neighboring pixels.\nConsidering color mixing, the maximum color nonuniformity of the first 18\ncolors in Macbeth Color Checker is defined as the color nonuniformity in a VR\nsystem. For a tandem WOLED, TLE, and CGC, color nonuniformity can be obtained\nby incoherently superimposing the power dissipation density K of randomly\noriented dipoles in different EMLs.\n\n#### 2.2. Pancake Optical System\n\nThe pancake lens has become the mainstream of VR/MR headsets because of its\ncompact form factor. Here, we build a raytracing model in the LightTools\nsoftware, as shown in Figure 3. In this model, the distance from the display\nto the lens is 16.4 mm, the diameter of the lens is 41.2 mm, and the eye\nrelief is 13.3 mm. We model the display panel using 20-point sources with 1-mm\nspacing, which can achieve a ~100\u00b0 horizontal field of view with the\nmagnification of the pancake lens. The diameter of the eye pupil is 4 mm. The\nreflective circular polarizer can be made of a broadband quarter-wave plate\nand a reflective linear polarizer, or by simply using a cholesteric liquid\ncrystal film. In our model, a broadband quarter-wave plate and a reflective\npolarizer based on multilayer thin films are employed to function as a\nreflective circular polarizer. Figure 4 depicts the collection efficiency\ndepending on the emission angle and the location of the point source. The\nmaximum collection efficiency of ~12.5% is attributed to the 50% absorption\nloss of a circular polarizer placed in front of the point sources and the 75%\nloss from traversing through the half mirror twice. As a comparison, if we\nadopt a wire grid polarizer to act as a reflective linear polarizer, the\nmaximum collection efficiency is reduced to ~10% due to its intrinsic\nabsorption. On the other hand, the collection cone for almost all pixels falls\nwithin ~5\u00b0, arising from a telecentric design of the pancake lens and a small\neye pupil.\n\nFigure 3. The schematic of a pancake VR system consisting of a circular\npolarizer, a half mirror, and a reflective circular polarizer.\n\nFigure 4. The collection efficiency depending on the emission angle and the\nlocation of the point source.\n\n## 3\\. Analysis and Optimization\n\nBased on Figure 1, the layer from the bottom to the top can be listed as\nfollows: CMOS/anode/ITO/HIL/HTL/B-EML/CGL/YG-EML (or other EMLs) /ETL/Cathode\n(thin Mg:Ag alloy)/Capping (CMOS stands for complementary metal-oxide-\nsemiconductor; HTL refers to hole transportation layer; ETL represents\nelectron transportation layer). We consider the wavelength-dependent\nrefractive index for anode, ITO, and cathode and assume the same refractive\nindex of 1.8 for all remaining organic layers. Different EMLs are connected in\nseries with a charge generation layer (CGL). The thickness of the anode layer\nis 100 nm to provide a high reflection. All the EML thicknesses are 10 nm, and\nthe thickness of the ETL is 30 nm. If HIL is patterned to introduce different\noptical cavity lengths, the ITO thickness is fixed at 10 nm. If ITO is\npatterned, the HIL thickness is fixed at 20 nm. To perform system-level\nanalysis and optimization, we introduce five independent variables, which can\nbe denoted by D = [d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5]. More specifically, d_1, d_2, and\nd_3 are the HIL or ITO thicknesses corresponding to blue, green, and red\nsubpixels, respectively, d_4 is the cathode thickness, and d_5 is the capping\nthickness. The former three variables [d_1, d_2, d_3] mainly modulate the\nradiated intensity of multiple emissive layers; the latter two variables [d_4,\nd_5] mainly impact the resonance strength and the efficiency. For [d_4, d_5],\nwe set d_4 [10 nm, 25 nm] and d_5 [0 nm, 80 nm], respectively. Lastly, our\noptimization target is to find the maximum TLE while keeping a color gamut\ncoverage of no less than 99% DCI-P3 and the color nonuniformity \u0394 \u2264 0.02.\nConsidering three subpixels, the TLE is calculated as the averaged efficiency\nof three subpixels. We also investigate how wide the color gamut can be since\na larger color coverage leads to a better color saturation and viewer\nsatisfaction [19].\n\n#### 3.1. B/YG Tandem WOLED\n\nIn this section, we study the simplest tandem structure: B/YG WOLED. It\nusually exhibits a lower driving voltage than that with more emissive layers.\nIn the blue subpixel, the microcavity should be designed to obtain\nconstructive interference for blue light and destructive interference for\nyellow\u2013green light. To achieve a minimum thickness, we can locate the blue\nemitter around the first antinode of the reflective metal electrode and the\nyellow\u2013green emitter around the first node of the reflective metal electrode.\nTherefore, the spacing between the two EMLs and the CGL thickness can be\ncalculated, which is approximately 90 nm and 80 nm, respectively. Due to the\nCGL thickness, it is not possible to achieve the first antinode corresponding\nto the yellow\u2013green emitter, and thus the second antinode can be employed. Via\nphysical analysis, we choose d_1 \u2208 [5 nm, 35 nm], d_2 \u2208 [40 nm, 80 nm], and\nd_3 \u2208 [85 nm, 120 nm] as boundary constraints. In the following, we use a\ngreen subpixel as a preliminary demonstration because it greatly determines\nhow wide the color gamut can be.\n\nFigure 5 shows the spectra of the green subpixel corresponding to different\nangles, as indicated by solid lines. As a reference, the emission spectra of\nthe blue (BPPyA) and yellow\u2013green (Iracac) emitters are also included [18]\nusing dashed lines. If d_2 (HIL) = 60 nm, d_4 = 25 nm, and d_5 = 60 nm, we can\nobtain the spectrum with a central wavelength of 538 nm and the full width at\nhalf maximum FWHM = 32 nm. Such a narrow FWHM arises from the strong\nmicrocavity effect. If ITO is selected to control the cavity length\ncorresponding to the green subpixel, we can calculate d_2 (ITO) = 50 nm to\nachieve a similar result to Figure 5. To investigate how d_2 and d_4 impact\nthe transmitted spectra, we calculate the spectra and color coordinates\ncorresponding to different values for d_2 and d_4. As Figure 6 depicts, a\nthicker Mg:Ag film helps achieve DCI-P3\u2032s green primary given a certain d_2.\n\nFigure 5. Spectra of the green subpixel at different angles: 0\u00b0, 10\u00b0, and 20\u00b0.\nThe emission spectra of blue and yellow\u2013green emitters are also included. Note\nthat all spectra are given before light travels through the green color\nfilter.\n\nFigure 6. The CIE 1931 coordinates of the green subpixel as a function of d_2\nat d_4 = 10 nm and d_4 = 25 nm, respectively.\n\nBesides color coordinates, position-dependent color shift corresponding to\ndifferent d_2 is also simulated, as shown in Figure 7. For the source (pixel)\npositions ranging from 10 mm to 15 mm, the maximum color shift occurs. This is\nbecause the maximum collection efficiency corresponding to those pixel\npositions occurs at larger emission angles (~10\u00b0), as shown in Figure 4,\nleading to a larger color shift.\n\nFigure 7. Simulated color shift of the green subpixel corresponding to\ndifferent source positions and HIL thicknesses (d_2).\n\nAccording to this demonstration, it is feasible to eliminate the green color\nfilter because the blue light can be suppressed almost completely by the\ndestructive interference under certain conditions, as verified by Figure 5.\nThe same conclusion also applies to the blue subpixel because of the\ndestructive interference of yellow\u2013green light. Although color filters help\nincrease ambient contrast ratio, this advantage may disappear because we can\nlaminate another quarter-wave plate onto the circular polarizer to eliminate\nthe reflected light from the half mirror. Compared to the blue and green\nsubpixels, it is more challenging to eliminate the red color filter. In a red\nsubpixel, we would like to locate the yellow\u2013green emitter around the second\nantinode for a resonance wavelength of ~630 nm. Unfortunately, the blue\nemitter is simultaneously located closer to the second antinode for a\nresonance wavelength of ~460 nm. For this reason, dual peaks emerge in the red\nsubpixel. To improve optical efficiencies of the blue and green subpixels and\nachieve a decent color gamut, we can just pattern the red color filters.\n\nAs mentioned above, we can achieve DCI-P3\u2032s green primary with the low-order\nantinodes with a strong microcavity; however, the efficiency is inevitably\nreduced due to the higher absorption of the metal cathode. According to the\nprinciples of interference, a longer cavity length contributes to generating\nthe spectrum with a narrower FWHM. Therefore, we propose a B/YG WOLED with\nhigh-order antinodes to improve the color gamut and efficiency. We repeat the\nsame optimization process as the low-order antinodes except that d_1 \u2208 [110\nnm, 150 nm], d_2 \u2208 [160 nm, 200 nm], d_3 \u2208 [230 nm, 280 nm], and the CGL\nthickness is 110 nm. Compared to the low-order antinodes, we locate the blue\nemitter around the second antinode of the reflective metal electrode and the\nyellow\u2013green emitter around the second node of the reflective metal electrode.\nThe optimized result shows that the maximum color gamut can increase from 80%\nto 92% Rec. 2020. Also, the layer thicknesses for optimal solutions\ncorresponding to the low-order antinodes and high-order antinodes are D_l =\n[25 nm, 55 nm, 115 nm, 20 nm, 80 nm] and D_h = [120 nm, 180 nm, 255 nm, 15 nm,\n80 nm], respectively. The corresponding optimal TLE is 1.39 \u00d7 and 2.26 \u00d7 ,\nrespectively. The 1.6x TLE mainly arises from the reduced cathode thickness\n(d_4) required to achieve a color gamut of no less than 99% DCI-P3. Note that\na higher-order antinode helps to further widen the color gamut, but the\nefficiency may be reduced, and the conductivity could be an issue for organic\nlayers, which can be mitigated by organic materials with high carrier\nmobilities [20].\n\n#### 3.2. B/G/R Tandem WOLED\n\nIn this section, we investigate another tandem structure: B/G/R WOLED. We\ninput the emitted spectra from three EMLs, and then repeat the same\noptimization procedures as the B/YG WOLED. Figure 8 compares the color gamut\ncoverage between the B/YG WOLED and the B/G/R WOLED with the low-order\nantinodes. When D_l = [20 nm, 55 nm, 120 nm, 25 nm, 0 nm], 100% DCI-P3 or 80%\nRec. 2020 can be achieved via B/YG. To achieve a much wider color gamut, deep\ngreen with a high CIE y value is highly desired. With a green EML and a\ndesigned cavity, B/G/R-v2 and B/G/R-v1 can achieve a color gamut of 95% and\n90% Rec. 2020, respectively, when D_l = [10 nm, 50 nm, 110 nm, 25 nm, 0 nm]\nand D_l = [5 nm, 45 nm, 120 nm, 10 nm, 80 nm], respectively. To achieve an\nultrawide color gamut while keeping a high efficiency, we propose a B/G/R\nWOLED with high-order antinodes, just like B/YG WOLED. For example, when D_h =\n[110 nm, 165 nm, 255 nm, 15 nm, 0 nm], a color gamut with 95% Rec. 2020 can be\nachieved with a 15-nm cathode. This structure also enables a color gamut of\n93% Rec. 2020 with a 10-nm cathode when D_h = [110 nm, 165 nm, 265 nm, 10 nm,\n80 nm].\n\nFigure 8. Simulated color gamut corresponding to B/YG WOLED and B/G/R WOLED\nwith different d_4 and d_5.\n\nFor B/G/R WOLEDs, the layer thicknesses for optimal solutions corresponding to\nthe low-order antinodes and the high-order antinodes are D_l = [5 nm, 55 nm,\n100 nm, 10 nm, 80 nm] and D_h = [115 nm, 175 nm, 245 nm, 10 nm, 80 nm],\nrespectively. The corresponding optimal TLE is 3.64 \u00d7 and 3.58 \u00d7 ,\nrespectively. In comparison with B/YG WOLED with the low-order antinodes,\n~160% efficiency improvement is mainly attributed to the 10-nm cathode. All\noptimal solutions are marked in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. Optimization results of WOLED microdisplays: (a) B/YG (b) high-order\nB/YG (c) B/G/R, and (d) high-order B/G/R. Cyan points represent optimal\nsolutions corresponding to each case.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions and Future Perspectives\n\nWe have modelled the performance of WOLED in pancake VR headsets, forming the\nbasis for systematical analysis and optimization. For both B/YG and B/G/R\nWOLED, we first analyzed the boundary constraints for [d_1, d_2, d_3] to speed\nup the simulation process, and then optimized their performance. Our results\nindicated that it is possible to eliminate the blue and green color filters to\nimprove the optical efficiencies of B/YG WOLED. More importantly, we proposed\na new structure by combining the high-order antinodes with the patterned\nmicrocavities. Our simulation results also indicated that our proposed\nstructure can improve the efficiency of B/YG tandem WOLED from 1.39 \u00d7\n(corresponding to low-order antinodes) to 2.26 \u00d7 (corresponding to high-order\nantinodes) at optimal conditions. It also enabled a color gamut coverage of\n92% Rec. 2020 in B/YG WOLED with a strong microcavity. For B/G/R tandem WOLED,\na color gamut of 95% Rec. 2020 can be achieved with a moderate microcavity\nwhen D_h = [110 nm, 165 nm, 255 nm, 15 nm, 0 nm] (the cathode thickness is 15\nnm).\n\nOverall, the proposed methods help achieve tandem white micro-OLED with wide\ncolor gamut and high efficiency. These are important to VR/MR headsets. In the\nnear-term, tandem white micro-OLED integrated with patterned microcavities,\nmicrolens arrays, and optimized color filters is expected to dominate high-end\nVR/MR markets because of its high-resolution density, high efficiency, and\nwide color gamut. In the long- term, however, tandem RGB micro-OLEDs without\ncolor filters could be a strong contender if the cost-effective manufacturing\ntechnology can be realized.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nMethodology, Z.Y. and E.-L.H.; simulations, Z.Y.; writing\u2014original draft\npreparation, Z.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.-T.W.; supervision, S.-T.W.\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\n\n## Funding\n\nThe UCF group is indebted to Nichia for the partial financial support.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nThe data presented in this study are available from the authors upon\nreasonable request.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
