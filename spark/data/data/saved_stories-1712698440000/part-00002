He does amateur\nfights at university, where he finds \u014cnosato Daiki, 2000, formerly known as\nNakamura Daiki, the most prominent young fighter in top-level sumo today, a\nworthy rival.\n\nIt\u2019s 2017, Terunofuji Haruo, born in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, as Gantulgyn Gan-\nErdene in 1991, is a top-level \u014dzeki, the second highest sumo range. He is\nstrong as a monster, lifting other fighters and carefully placing them out of\nthe dohy\u014d, the sumo \u201cring\u201d, almost without resistance. He is an absolute\ndisplay of strength, but he\u2019s not immune to injury. After several knee\ninjuries and health problems, he is not able to fight for so long he is\nrelegated to lower sumo ranges, forced to fight in a lower division each\ncompetition he misses. He is forced to start in jonidan when he returns in\n2019. That\u2019s the fifth division in sumo.\n\nTerunofuji in 2023 (wikipedia)\n\nTerunofuji is back in business. During his first competition after the return\nhe secures the promotion to the sandanme, next he is promoted to makushita.\nTwo makushita competitions later, with a 6-1 record, he wins the makushita\ncompetition with an amazing 7-0, securing the promotion to j\u016bry\u014d, which he\nalso wins (13-2) once and has a very good performance next (10-5). He\u2019s back\nin makuuchi, the top level division. It\u2019s 2020.\n\nDuring the first top-level division competition after his return, Terunofuji\nwins the competition (13-2), also obtaining the special prizes for Outstanding\nPerformance and Technique. One year later, he is back at \u014dzeki range, winning\nthree of the six competitions he took part in during the year, and being in\nthe runner-up on five of them. After a great performance (14-1) he is promoted\nto yokozuna, the highest range in sumo, reserved only for the grandmasters of\nthe sport. In 2021, after a two-year comeback, he became the 73rd yokozuna in\nthe recorded sumo history (since 1798).\n\nThe young Takerufuji, who is still fighting in amateur sumo, decides to make\nthe jump to professional, inspired by Terunofuji\u2018s comeback. In November 2022,\nhe wins (7-0) his first jonokuchi competition, the lowest division in sumo. He\nis promoted to jonidan, that he also wins (7-0). Next he makes a great\nperformance in sandanme (6-1) and is promoted to makushita where he obtains\nvery good results (6-1, 6-1, 5-2 and 6-2) and is finally promoted to j\u016bry\u014d,\nthe second division. Now, he can consider himself a proper professional. It\u2019s\nJanuary 2024. Only a little bit more than a year passed since he started his\nprofessional attempt.\n\nTakerufuji in 2024 (wikipedia)\n\n\u014cnosato Daiki has also made his bet. In May 2023 he started at makushita\nlevel, as he was a top fighter in amateur sumo, he could skip lower divisions.\nAfter two good performances in makushita (6-1 and 4-3) he is promoted to j\u016bry\u014d\nand continues to perform at the same level (12-3 and 12-3) and is finally\npromoted to the top division, with a maegashira 15 range, in January 2024. In\nless than a year, thanks to his exceptional strength and technique, \u014cnosato\nsigns the third-fastest to reach the top division since 1989. He was so fast,\nhis hair hasn\u2019t grow enough yet to tie in a chonmage, the mandatory sumo\nhairstyle.\n\n\u014cnosato in 2023 (wikipedia)\n\nWhile \u014cnosato is doing a great performance in his top division debut, in\nJanuary 2024, ending with a great 11-4 record, Takerufuji is almost\nunstoppable in j\u016bry\u014d, winning the championship with an excellent 13-2 record\nand being thus promoted to the top-level division, where both young fighters\nwould meet, again since their amateur times, in March.\n\nIt\u2019s March 2024, and the time has come. Both \u014cnosato and Takerufuji have a\ngreat start, with 0 losses the sixth day. After the first two thirds of\ncompetition, the tenth day, both arrive with very good numbers: \u014cnosato with a\n8-1 after his loss against \u014cnosh\u014d the seventh day and Takerufuji has a\nsurprising non-loss streak, very rare on first division debutants, 9-0 that\nis.\n\nBoth having a similar range, and a very good record, are paired together.\n\u014cnosato is 40 kilograms heavier, he is very strong and his technique is sharp.\nTakerufuji is 8 centimeters shorter, and strong as a truck. In their first\nduel in the sumo top division, hopefully from many, \u014cnosato is blasted out of\nthe ring, and Takerufuji obtains his 10-0. Since the 15-day tournament format\nwas established in 1949, only the yokozuna Taiho conquered an eleven-win\nstreak in his first top-level competition.\n\nNext day, Takerufuji fights Kotonowaka, a young fighter at the \u014dzeki range,\nwinning the fight and matching Taiho\u2018s record. After this, he demonstrated he\ncould challenge the hardest fighters in the competition. Next day H\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b\ncomes, the young Mongolian fighter is one of the most feared in the \u014dzeki\nrange. H\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b is fast, strong and his technique, based on traditional\nMongolian wrestling, b\u00f6kh, is both accurate and hard to defend against.\n\nAfter a very intense start, H\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b lands a perfect technique and throws\nTakerufuji out of the dohy\u014d, putting an end to the 11 win streak, but not yet\nto the competition.\n\nThe 14th fight comes and Takerufuji has a 12-1 record, the best from all the\nparticipants. This time loses against Asanoyama injuring his ankle right at\nthe beginning of the fight. 12-2 that is, and everybody is afraid he won\u2019t\ncompete the last day, as he couldn\u2019t walk in his way out.\n\nThe last day of the competition starts, Takerufuji, with his 12-2 is one win\naway from the next fighter, \u014cnosato, who secured a great 11-3 record and is\none win away from the next in the list: H\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b.\n\nTakerufuji has an injured ligament, and his master has advised him not to\nfight. Nobody knows what would happen. When his turn comes, he walks to the\ncenter of the dohy\u014d with a bandage in his right ankle. Even if he loses he\nwould still have chances to win the tournament if \u014cnosato loses his fight\nagainst H\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b, but we all know he will try to win this fight against\nG\u014dnoyama, his spirit is one of a warrior.\n\nG\u014dnoyama, a great fighter (10-4 at the fight), has a great start, almost\ndropping Takerufuji, when he put too much weight in his injured ankle. But\nTakerufuji holds in place, grabs G\u014dnoyama\u2018s mawashi and push, push, push until\nhe is out. Takerufuji wins the competition and becomes the second fighter that\nwins the makuuchi competition as a debutant since Ryogoku, who won the summer\ntournament of 1914, that\u2019s 110 years.\n\nThe tournament continues, as some fights are left. \u014cnosato has to fight\nH\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b, the only sumo that was able to win against an uninjured Takerufuji.\nIn a spectacular display of technique and flexibility, H\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b throws \u014cnosato\nout of the dohy\u014d. 11-4 for \u014cnosato in the end, signing a great competition and\nalso wining fighting spirit and technique special prices.\n\nTakerufuji, also received all possible special prices: fighting spirit,\noutstanding performance and technique; and he is honored as the great warrior\nhe is. His name is now written in sumo history forever.\n\nMany have no doubt that Takerufuji, \u014cnosato, and probably H\u014dsh\u014dry\u016b, will\nbecome great yokozunas one day, but sadly, the only one we have now, the\ninspiration for this huge accomplishment, Terunofuji, was out of the\ncompetition, after a very poor start, due to his injuries and health problems\nat his 32 years of age.\n\nSupported by:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
