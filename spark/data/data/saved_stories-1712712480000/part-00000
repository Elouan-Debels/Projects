Built on artificial intelligence that makes use of large language\nmodels, or LLMs, the bots imitate the particular way the deceased person\ntalked by using their emails, text messages, voice recordings, and more. The\ntechnology is supposed to help the bereaved deal with grief by letting them\nchat with the bot as if they were talking to the person. But we\u2019re missing\nevidence that this technology actually helps the bereaved cope with loss.\n\n#### Related\n\nExcerpt: Can AI Make Us Emotionally Intelligent?\n\nHumans have used technology to deal with feelings of loss for more than a\ncentury. Post-mortem photographs, for example, gave 19th century Victorians a\nlikeness of their dead to remember them by, when they couldn\u2019t afford a\npainted portrait. Recent studies have provided evidence that having a drawing\nor picture as a keepsake helps some survivors to grieve. Yet researchers are\nstill learning how people grieve and what kinds of things help the bereaved to\ndeal with loss.\n\nAn approach to grief that focuses on continuing bonds with the deceased loved\none suggests that finding closure is about more than letting the person go.\nResearch and clinical practice show that renewing the bond with someone\nthey\u2019ve lost can help mourners deal with their passing. That means griefbots\nmight help the bereaved by letting them transform their relationship to their\ndeceased loved one. But a strong continuing bond only helps the bereaved when\nthey can make sense of their loss. And the imitation loved ones could make it\nharder for people to do that and accept that their loved one is gone.\n\nCarla Sofka, a professor of social work at Siena College in New York state, is\nan expert on technology and grief. As the internet grew in the mid-1990s, she\ncoined the term \u201cthanatechnology\u201d to describe any technology \u2014 including\ndigital or social media \u2014 that helps someone deal with death, grief, and loss,\nsuch as families and friends posting together on the social media profile of a\ndeceased loved one or creating a website in their memory. Other survivors like\nrereading emails from the deceased or listening to their recorded voice\nmessages. Some people may do this for years as they come to terms with the\nintense emotions of loss.\n\n> Griefbots could give the bereaved a new tool to cope with grief, or they\n> could create the illusion that the loved one isn\u2019t gone.\n\nIf companies are going to build AI simulations of the deceased, then \u201cthey\nhave to talk to the people who think they want this technology\u201d to better\ncreate something that meets their needs, Sofka said. Current commercial\ngriefbots target different groups. Seance AI\u2019s griefbot, for example, is\nintended for short-term use to provide a sense of closure, while the company\nYou, Only Virtual \u2014 or YOV \u2014 promises to keep someone\u2019s loved one with them\nforever, so they \u201cnever have to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nBut if companies can create convincing simulations of people who died, Sofka\nsaid it\u2019s possible that could change the whole reality of the person being\ngone. Though we can only speculate, it might affect the way people who knew\nthem grieve. As Sofka wrote in an email, \u201ceveryone is different in how they\nprocess grief.\u201d Griefbots could give the bereaved a new tool to cope with\ngrief, or they could create the illusion that the loved one isn\u2019t gone and\nforce mourners to confront a second death if they want to stop using the bot.\n\nPublic health and technology experts, such as Linnea Laestadius of the\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, are concerned griefbots could trap mourners\nin secluded online conversations, unable to move on with their lives. Her work\non chatbots suggests people can form strong emotional ties to virtual personas\nthat make them dependent on the program for emotional support. Given how hard\nit is to predict how such chatbots will affect the way people grieve, Sofka\nwrote in an email, \u201cit\u2019s challenging for social scientists to develop research\nquestions that capture all possible reactions to this new technology.\u201d\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped companies from releasing their products. But to develop\ngriefbots responsibly, it\u2019s not just about knowing how to make an authentic\nbot and then doing it, said Wan-Jou She, an assistant professor at the Kyoto\nInstitute of Technology.\n\n###### Get Our Newsletter\n\nSent Weekly\n\nShe collaborated with Anna Xygkou, a doctoral student at the University of\nKent, and other coauthors on a research project to see how chatbot\ntechnologies can be used to support grief. They interviewed 10 people who were\nusing virtual characters created by various apps to cope with the loss of a\nloved one. Five of their participants chatted with a simulation of the person\nthey lost, while the others used chatbots that took on different roles, such\nas a friend. Xygkou said that the majority of them talked to the characters\nfor less than a year. \u201cMost of them used it as a transitional stage to\novercome grief, in the first stage\u201d she said, \u201cwhen grief is so intense you\ncannot cope with the loss.\u201d Left to themselves, these mourners chose a short-\nterm tool to help them deal with loss. They did not want to recreate a loved\none to keep them at their side for life. While this study suggests that\ngriefbots can be helpful to some bereaved people, more studies will be needed\nto show that the technology doesn\u2019t harm them \u2014 and that it helps beyond this\nsmall group.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the griefbots didn\u2019t need to convince anyone they were human. The\nusers interviewed knew they were talking to a chatbot, and they did not mind.\nThey suspended their disbelief, Xygkou said, to chat with the bot as though\nthey were talking to their loved ones. As anyone who has used LLM-driven\nchatbots knows, it\u2019s easy to feel like there\u2019s a real person on the other side\nof the screen. During the emotional upheaval of losing a loved one, indulging\nthis fantasy could be especially problematic. That\u2019s why simulations must make\nclear that they\u2019re not a person, Xygkou said.\n\n> People may become more comfortable talking to computers, or poor oversight\n> might mean that many people won\u2019t know they are talking to a computer.\n\nCritically, according to She, chatbots are currently not under any regulation,\nand without that, it\u2019s hard to get companies to prove their products help\nusers to deal with loss. Lax lawmaking has encouraged other chatbot apps to\nclaim they can help improve mental health without providing any evidence. As\nlong as these apps categorize themselves as wellness rather than therapy, the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration will not enforce its requirements, including\nthat apps prove they do more good than harm. Though it\u2019s unclear which\nregulatory body will be ultimately responsible, it is possible that the\nFederal Trade Commission could handle false or unqualified claims made by such\nproducts.\n\nWithout much evidence, it\u2019s uncertain how griefbots will affect the way we\ndeal with loss. Usage data doesn\u2019t appear to be public, but She and Xygkou had\nso much trouble finding participants for their study that Xygkou thinks not\nmany mourners currently use the technology. But that could change as AI\ncontinues to proliferate through our lives. Maybe more people will use\ngriefbots as the shortage of qualified mental professionals worsens. People\nmay become more comfortable talking to computers, or poor oversight might mean\nthat many people won\u2019t know they are talking to a computer in the first place.\nSo far, neither questionable ethics nor tremendous cost have prevented\ncompanies from trying to use AI any chance they get.\n\nBut no matter what comfort a bereaved person finds in bot, by no means should\nthey trust them, She said. When a LLM is talking to someone, \u201cit\u2019s just\npredicting: what is the next word.\u201d\n\nTim Reinboth is a freelance science journalist and researcher in cognitive\nscience and science and technology studies.\n\n#### Share This Story\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on FlipBoard (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\nRepublish\n\nRead Next\n\nBooks\n\n##### Book Excerpt: How Robots Are Improving Surgery\n\nBy Daniela Rus and Gregory Mone\n\n03.22.2024\n\nViewpoints\n\n##### Opinion: Rape Kit Reform Is Overdue\n\nBy Pagan Kennedy\n\n03.12.2024\n\n###### Get Our Newsletter\n\nSent Weekly\n\n  * Usage Guidelines\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Submit a Proposal\n\nNotifications\n\n### Share this Story\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on FlipBoard (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\nWe'd like to show you notifications for the latest news and updates.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
