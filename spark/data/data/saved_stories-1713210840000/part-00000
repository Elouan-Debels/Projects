So when I found a place\nto live just a few blocks away on a street without buses, it was a relief.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know is that my health was still at risk\u2014from indoor pollution.\n\nThanks to a recent test conducted by my local Sierra Club chapter, I learned\nthat the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions from the hoodless gas stove I\u2019ve\nbeen cooking on for the last 30 years in my poorly ventilated galley kitchen\nexceed the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s maximum safe level of 100 parts\nper billion (ppb) for a one-hour exposure outdoors. (There is no EPA standard\nfor indoor air.)\n\nThe highest level the Sierra Club\u2019s air quality monitor detected when my oven\nand two burners were on was 103 ppb, but even at low concentrations, NO2\nirritates the upper respiratory tract and lungs, and longtime exposures have\nbeen associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and\nchildhood asthma.\n\nFortunately, I don\u2019t have COPD and I didn\u2019t contract asthma when I was young,\nperhaps partly because I grew up in a home with an electric range. But other\nWashingtonians may not be as lucky. While less than 40 percent of households\nnationwide cook on a gas stove, 62 percent of households in Washington do.\nPerhaps not coincidentally, a higher percentage of adults in the District\nsuffer from asthma than in all of the 50 states, and the prevalence of asthma\namong children under 18 in the nation\u2019s capital is second only to that of kids\nin Mississippi.\n\nCertainly, gas stoves are just one source of air pollution in the District.\nBut a study published in the December 2022 issue of the International Journal\nof Environmental Research and Public Health calculated that gas stoves are\nresponsible for 12.7 percent of childhood asthma cases in the United States,\ncomparable to the risk posed to children by secondhand smoke. The situation is\neven worse in some states. According to the study, gas stoves trigger more\nthan 20 percent of childhood asthma cases in California and Illinois, and\nnearly 19 percent in New York. The study concluded that these childhood asthma\ncases could have theoretically been prevented by using electric appliances.\n\nI was not fully aware of this issue until roughly a year ago, when I wrote a\ncolumn about it, and I\u2019ve been working for environmental organizations for 25\nyears. No doubt, the fact that gas stoves are hazardous to our health was also\nnews to most Americans. What accounts for that?\n\n## Fifty Years of Disinformation\n\nIt\u2019s no longer a secret that the US oil industry was well aware as early as\n1957 that its products threaten the climate. As we now know, fossil fuel\ncompanies lied about it for decades to protect their profits. Thanks to\nexemplary spade work by news organizations and advocacy groups (including my\norganization, the Union of Concerned Scientists), we have known about the\nindustry\u2019s duplicity for at least 20 years.\n\nLess known is the fact that the gas utility industry has been engaged in the\nsame kind of deceit. According to an October 2023 report by the Climate\nInvestigations Center (CIC), a nonprofit watchdog organization, the industry\nhas been gaslighting us by promoting the idea that \u201ccooking with gas\u201d is a\ngood thing, despite knowing as far back as 1970 that gas stoves pose a threat\nto public health and the environment.\n\nNow that there is a desperate need to slash global warming emissions worldwide\nto avoid the worst consequences of climate change, it is critical to rapidly\nphase out the use of all fossil fuels. That would of course include fossil\ngas, which consists of 85 to 90 percent methane, a significantly more potent\nheat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide.\n\nA 2022 study found that gas stoves leak methane, and more than three-quarters\nof the emissions occurred when the stoves were off. Meanwhile, a 2023 study in\nEnvironmental Research Letters concluded that as little as 0.2 percent of gas\nleaking from the gas production and delivery system would make gas as bad as\ncoal for the climate\u2014and it turns out the leaks are worse than that. The EPA\nestimates that about 6.5 million metric tons of methane leak from the oil and\ngas supply chain each year\u2014approximately 1 percent of total gas\nproduction\u2014five times more than the 0.2 percent threshold.\n\nIn my town, gas accounts for 23 percent of global warming emissions, according\nto the District\u2019s Department of Energy and the Environment. But gas emissions\nare likely much higher when accounting for leaks, which are widespread in the\nWashington metro area system.\n\nPublic health also hangs in the balance. Gas stoves, which are in 38 percent\nof US households, not only emit methane, but also toxic pollutants besides NO2\nthat are associated with respiratory ailments and cancer. A 2022 study in\nEnvironmental Science and Technology detected more than 20 volatile organic\ncompounds, including hexane, toluene and benzene, in unburned stove gas.\n\nIn spite of all of the data, the American Gas Association (AGA), the\nindustry\u2019s leading trade group that represents more than 200 investor-owned\ngas utility companies and their suppliers, contends there is no problem. It\nmaintains that gas stoves are a \u201cminor source\u201d of NO2 and dismisses the\nmounting evidence that gas stove emissions contribute to asthma and other\nrespiratory illnesses.\n\n## Following the Disinformation Playbook\n\nThe gas utility industry, which won over the public with its cooking with gas\ncampaign in the 1930s, found itself at a crossroads in the late 1960s when\nsales of electric ranges outpaced gas stove sales for the first time. In 1969,\nAGA launched a million-dollar advertising campaign (worth $8.45 million in\ntoday\u2019s dollars) in response to recapture the market, which was especially\ncritical given gas stoves function as a \u201cgateway\u201d appliance. If a new home has\na gas stove installed, homeowners are more likely to buy other big-ticket gas\nappliances\u2014a furnace, a water heater, a clothes dryer\u2014which use a lot more gas\nthan a stove.\n\nJust a year later, however, the industry encountered a potentially major\nobstacle: A study conducted by the government\u2019s National Air Pollution Control\nAdministration found a link between outdoor NO2 exposure and childhood\nrespiratory problems. The lead author of that study, Dr. Carl Shy\u2014who spoke\nwith NPR last fall for an article based on the CIC report\u2014recalled that when\nhe met with gas industry representatives after publishing the study, they\nconceded that gas stoves emit NO2 and that hood vents were not strong enough\nto remove it.\n\nShy\u2019s study provided a shining example of the threat posed by industrial\npollution that galvanized public attention in the late 1960s and led to the\nfirst Earth Day in April 1970. Given that heightened awareness, a Commerce\nDepartment advisory committee of electric and gas utility executives\nacknowledged at a meeting in the fall of 1970 that their industry needed \u201cto\nshow what they are doing about pollution [and] suggested that the gas industry\ntake a look at the NOx [nitrogen oxides] problem.\u201d\n\nSince then, however, the gas industry\u2014much like the oil industry\u2014has cribbed\nheavily from the tobacco industry\u2019s playbook to block government regulation by\nmanufacturing doubt about the reality and seriousness of its \u201cNOx problem.\u201d\nIts main tactics include funding studies that magnify uncertainties in health\nresearch to create confusion about the science, running deceptive public\nrelations campaigns, and creating front groups that spread disinformation to\nprotect\u2014and expand\u2014the industry\u2019s market share.\n\n## Attacking Credible Science\n\nSince the 1970s, the gas industry has been commissioning epidemiological\nstudies\u2014whose authors often failed to disclose their funding source\u2014that find\nno association between gas stove emissions and respiratory illness. As the CIC\nreport describes in painstaking detail, these studies were designed to call\ninto question the results of a growing number of studies that have discovered\nsuch a link. Many of the private labs and scientists the industry has\ncommissioned, including Battelle Laboratories in the 1970s and the Arthur D.\nLittle consulting firm in the 1980s, had previously done contract work for the\ntobacco industry for the very same purpose\u2014to poke holes in studies that found\nthat its products are hazardous by insisting that those findings were\n\u201cinconclusive\u201d or \u201cinvalid\u201d and that more research was needed.\n\nThis gas industry tactic continues today. Just last year, AGA contracted with\nGradient Corporation\u2014a scientific consulting firm with a history of\ndownplaying the health threat posed by toxic substances on behalf of its\nindustry clients\u2014to examine past studies that investigated the link between\ngas stoves and respiratory problems. Predictably, Gradient\u2019s review, published\nlast December in Global Epidemiology, concluded that the evidence presented in\nprevious studies was insufficient.\n\n## Running Misleading PR Campaigns\n\nFunding its own research is just one of the PR tactics the gas industry\nborrowed from the tobacco industry, the CIC report pointed out. Other tried-\nand-true tactics it appropriated include publicizing any information showing\nit in a positive light and disseminating the results of its research to\nlegislators, regulators, journalists, health professionals, and other opinion\nleaders.\n\nWhere did the gas industry pick up the finer points of PR disinformation? From\nthe very same firm that orchestrated Big Tobacco\u2019s campaign in the 1950s and\n1960s to sow doubt about the link between smoking and cancer: Hill & Knowlton.\n\nSuccessful PR campaigns also require advertising, and the gas industry has\nspent generously. Its 1969 million-dollar ad campaign, for instance\u2014called the\n\u201cmost ambitious advertising and marketing program [it has] ever\nundertaken\u201d\u2014featured commercials on the three television networks and ads in\nthe top mass-circulation magazines of the day, including Life, Reader\u2019s Digest\nand Better Homes & Gardens.\n\nIn recent years, the gas utility industry has embraced social media to make\nits pitch. Working with Porter Novelli and other PR firms, AGA and its sister\ntrade group, the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents\nmunicipally owned gas utilities, have been paying social media influencers\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to tout the benefits of gas stoves and other\nappliances in their posts.\n\nSince May 2018, AGA also has spent more than $113,000 on 440 Facebook and\nInstagram ads. The Consumer Energy Alliance, whose 350 members include AGA and\n78 other fossil fuel producers, suppliers and trade associations, has spent\nconsiderably more. Disingenuously calling itself the \u201cvoice of the energy\nconsumer,\u201d the group paid more than $700,000 for some 2,300 Facebook and\nInstagram ads over the same time period. Last August and September, the group\nposted a series of ads warning that EPA efforts to rein in methane emissions\nmay mean \u201chigher costs for your household\u201d and \u201cunintended consequences for\nevery American family.\u201d\n\nGas utilities have likewise launched their own social media campaigns.\nSouthwest Gas, for example, sponsors influencers on Facebook, Instagram and\nTikTok to reach potential customers in Arizona, California and Nevada,\naccording to the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that monitors\nthe oil, gas and utility industries. One Southwest Gas-funded TikTok spot\nfeatured an influencer in her kitchen parroting gas industry talking points\nwhile frying eggs on a gas stovetop. She then went on to rave about her gas\nclothes dryer and fireplace. The spot did not disclose who paid for it, but\nthe influencer\u2019s Instagram profile included a link to the Southwest Gas\nwebsite.\n\n## Hiding Behind Front Groups\n\nSome local governments across the country have responded to the climate crisis\nby changing their building codes to ban gas hookups in new homes and\nbuildings. In 2019, Berkeley, California, became the first city to initiate\nsuch a ban, but a federal appeals court in San Francisco overturned a lower\ncourt decision in a case brought by the California Restaurant Association,\nruling that federal energy efficiency standards preempt the ordinance.\n\nAlthough Berkeley agreed to repeal its ban last month, nearly 100 cities and\ncounties have passed similar ordinances, and another 35 cities and counties\nnow require \u201celectric readiness\u201d so newly constructed buildings can easily\nswitch to all-electric appliances. How the appeals court ruling will affect\nthose initiatives is not clear.\n\nNot surprisingly, AGA applauded the court decision, calling it a \u201chuge step\u201d\ntoward helping the nation \u201ccontinue on a path to achieving our energy and\nenvironmental goals.\u201d\n\nBesides getting a favorable ruling in what may prove to be a pivotal case, gas\nutilities have succeeded in lobbying legislators in at least 24 states to pass\nlaws blocking cities and counties from banning or restricting new gas hookups.\nLikewise, they have been busy shoring up their markets. In addition to paying\nsocial media influencers to hawk gas appliances, gas utilities operating in 17\nstates have been offering builders cash and free vacations to install gas\nappliances in new homes, according to a December 2023 Guardian investigation.\n\nAt least partly in response to the Berkeley gas ban, gas utilities in more\nthan a dozen states also have set up front groups to promote gas as \u201cclean,\nreliable and affordable,\u201d denigrate renewable energy, and oppose gas bans and\nother climate solutions, the Energy and Policy Institute has reported.\nSouthern California Gas Company, for instance, surreptitiously launched a\nphony grassroots group called Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions in\n2019. New Jersey Gas, New Jersey Natural Gas, and the Newark-based Public\nService Enterprise Group joined forces with local business associations to\ncreate Affordable Energy for New Jersey in 2020. And in 2022, Atmos Energy,\nBlack Hills Energy, Summit Utilities, and Xcel Energy were among the founders\nof Coloradans for Energy Access.\n\nSince May 2018, 15 of these state and regional front groups spent $3.6 million\non more than 14,000 Facebook and Instagram ads. The top spender, Natural\nAllies for a Clean Energy Future, paid more than $1 million for some 2,000\nads. Founded in 2020 with a war chest of more than $10 million, its members\ninclude the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America; gas pipeline\ncompanies Kinder Morgan, TC Energy, and Williams Companies; liquefied natural\ngas exporter Cheniere Energy; and Southern Company, owner of gas utilities in\nGeorgia, Illinois, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nThe result of all this activity? Notwithstanding initiatives to ban new gas\nhookups, the industry\u2019s 50-year disinformation campaign has thus far paid off.\nThe federal government has yet to set a stringent standard for toxic gas stove\nemissions, and the percentage of new single-family homes across the country\nwith an installed gas stove has jumped from less than 30 percent in the 1970s\nto nearly 50 percent in 2021.\n\n## Federal Agencies Fail to Protect the Public\n\nThe federal government has been aware of gas stove pollution issues for\ndecades. Remember, that 1970 study identifying a link between outdoor NO2\nexposure and respiratory problems in schoolchildren that so alarmed the gas\nindustry was conducted by the National Air Pollution Control Administration,\nwhich predated the EPA. Throughout the following decades, epidemiologists\nworldwide continued to find an association between gas stove emissions and\nrespiratory illnesses, as documented by the CIC report. In addition, some\nclinical trials examining the impact of NO2 on human volunteers under\ncontrolled conditions found pronounced increases in \u201cairway resistance\u201d even\nat low levels of NO2 exposure. Regardless, industry-funded studies have\ngenerated enough controversy over the conclusions of government and\nindependent studies to hold regulators at bay. The EPA finally introduced a\nmuch-delayed 1-hour exposure limit for outdoor NO2 in 2010, but there is still\nno comparable standard for indoor exposure.\n\nThe most recent attempt to address toxic gas stove emissions at the federal\nlevel came in January 2023, when Richard Trumka Jr., one of five members of\nthe US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), touched off a firestorm of\nprotest. He said his agency, which regulates dangerous household products,\nshould consider banning new gas stoves, calling them \u201ca hidden hazard.\u201d\n\nThe blowback, mainly from Republicans on Capitol Hill, was immediate.\n\u201cDemocrats are coming for your kitchen appliances,\u201d warned Arkansas Sen. Tom\nCotton. \u201cI\u2019ll NEVER give up my gas stove,\u201d exclaimed Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson,\na former White House physician. \u201cIf the maniacs in the White House come for my\nstove, they can pry it from my cold dead hands.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, CPSC Chair Alexander Hoehn-Saric issued a statement clarifying\nthe agency\u2019s position, explaining that the agency is not planning a ban but is\ninvestigating ways to curb toxic stove-related emissions. In March 2023,\nTrumka followed through, issuing a \u201crequest for information\u201d (RIF) on gas\nstove emissions and possible solutions, a potential first step in regulating\nthe appliances. In the RIF announcement, he pointed out that it was \u201cnot the\nfirst time CPSC has considered the health effects of chronic exposure to\nemissions from home appliances, particularly nitrogen dioxide.\u201d He listed five\nexamples, from 1982 to 2017, when the agency took up the topic, but each time\nit refrained from issuing a gas stove regulation.\n\nSupporters of CPSC taking action often cited the December 2022 International\nJournal of Environmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH) study that found\nthat 12.7 percent of childhood asthma cases in the United States \u201cis\nattributable to gas stove use.\u201d In rebuttal, AGA and APGA cited a 2013 Lancet\nstudy investigating the association between different cooking fuels and\nchildhood asthma in 47 countries. The study found that open fire cooking\nincreased the prevalence of asthma, but failed to find an asthma link with\ngas.\n\nHowever, according to a co-author of that Lancet study, environmental\nepidemiologist Bert Brunekreef, the study is an outlier. \u201cYou can always find\na study that doesn\u2019t find an effect,\u201d he told E&E News in January 2023, \u201cbut\nyou have to look at the combined effect of all the studies to reach a\nconclusion.\u201d The way AGA cited it, he added, is \u201cnot a good use of our study.\u201d\n\nBrunekreef also pointed out that the December 2022 IJERPH study linking asthma\nto gas stoves is \u201centirely based on\u201d a 2013 meta-analysis he co-authored that\nreviewed more than 40 research papers. It found that, in \u201cchildren, gas\ncooking increases the risk of asthma and indoor NO2 increases the risk of\ncurrent wheeze.\u201d\n\nRegardless, AGA sent CPSC a 97-page comment that dismissed Brunkreef\u2019s 2013\nmeta-analysis and cited his anomalous 2013 Lancet study to bolster its\nargument.\n\nBy the time CPSC closed its comment period on gas stoves in May of last year,\nit had received more than 9,000 comments. About 30 percent of them were\napparently generated by a template letter AGA promoted in ads on Facebook,\naccording to the Energy and Policy Institute. The sample letter, the group\nsaid, cited Brunekreef \u2018s 2013 Lancet study.\n\nThere is no way to gauge how much influence AGA\u2019s campaign has had, but since\nlast May, there has been no word from the agency. When contacted recently, a\nCPSC spokesperson said that \u201cno regulatory action is planned, and any such\naction would require a vote by the full commission, which has not expressed\nsupport for any regulation.\u201d\n\nA federal agency did issue a new regulation for gas stoves recently, but it\nwas the Department of Energy\u2014not the CPSC\u2014and it focused on reducing energy\nuse, not toxic emissions.\n\nIn late January, the DOE\u2014which is required by law to periodically update\nappliance efficiency standards\u2014announced a relatively modest new energy-\nefficiency regulation for new gas and electric stoves. The standards, which\nwill go into effect in 2028, will affect only 3 percent of gas stoves because\n97 percent already meet them today. The standards will have a bigger impact on\nelectric stoves. Nearly a quarter of them currently on the market would not be\nin compliance.\n\nDOE projects that the standards will save Americans approximately $1.6 billion\non their utility bills and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 4 million\nmetric tons over 30 years, roughly equivalent to the combined annual emissions\nassociated with 500,000 US households\u2019 combined energy consumption. But will\nthe new standards appreciably reduce gas stove emissions of NO2, methane or\nvolatile organic compounds? No.\n\nThe new standards for both gas and electric stoves will only cut an estimated\n7,610 tons of NOx and 34,700 tons of methane over a 30-year period, according\nto a DOE spokesperson. Those estimates, he said, not only include \u201cend use\u201d\nemissions from cooking on a gas stove, but also emissions from the entire fuel\ncycle, from extracting fuel to generating electricity. The agency, he added,\ndid not specifically calculate emission reductions for NO2 or volatile organic\ncompounds.\n\nSo, it is still up to the CPSC, which has been investigating the threat posed\nby indoor NO2 emissions for more than 40 years, to follow the science and do\nsomething to ensure new gas stoves are safe. But what about the 47 million US\nhouseholds (including mine) cooking with gas today? We can lower our health\nrisk by opening our windows while cooking, using exhaust fans and air\npurifiers, and switching to electric kettles, pressure cookers, toaster ovens\nand microwaves. Or, better yet, we can take advantage of government incentives\nand replace our gas stoves\u2014and other gas appliances\u2014with electric ones, which\nwould protect our health and the climate at the same time.\n\nPosted in: Climate Change, Energy\n\nTags: asthma, climate change, gas stoves, natural gas, toxic pollutants\n\n## Share\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn\n\nAbout the author\n\nMore from Elliott\n\nElliott writes about UCS-related topics for a range of news organizations.\nPrior to joining UCS, Elliott was the Washington communications director for\nthe Natural Resources Defense Council, a foreign news editor at National\nPublic Radio, the managing editor of American Journalism Review, and the\neditor of Nuclear Times and Public Citizen magazines.\n\n## More like this\n\nDisobeyArt/Getty Images\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n## Swiss Women Lead the Way in Historic Climate Justice Victory\n\nL.
