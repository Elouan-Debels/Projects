Stults\u2019s partner, Daisy Krigbaum, was\naddicted to Pinterest and YouTube, bingeing videos on her iPhone before going\nto sleep. Two years ago, they both tried Apple\u2019s Screen Time restriction tool\nand found it too easy to disable, so the pair decided to trade out their\niPhones for more low-tech devices. They\u2019d heard about so-called dumbphones,\nwhich lacked the kinds of bells and whistles\u2014a high-resolution screen, an app\nstore, a video camera\u2014that made smartphones so addictive. But they found the\nprocess of acquiring one hard to navigate. \u201cThe information on it was kind of\ndisparate and hard to get to. A lot of people who know the most about\ndumbphones spend the least time online,\u201d Krigbaum said. A certain irony\npresented itself: figuring out a way to be less online required aggressive\nonline digging.\n\nThe couple\u2013Stults is twenty-nine, and Krigbaum is twenty-five\u2014saw a business\nopportunity. \u201cIf somebody could condense it and simplify it to the best\noptions, maybe more people would make the switch,\u201d Krigbaum said. In late\n2022, they launched an e-commerce company, Dumbwireless, to sell phones, data\nplans, and accessories for people who want to reduce time spent on their\nscreens. This wasn\u2019t Stults\u2019s first attempt at entrepreneurship; his past\nefforts included a made-in-America clothing brand in Colorado (\u201cThat went\nunder,\u201d he said) and a coffee shop in the back of an ill-attended Hollywood\ncomedy club (\u201cA doomed enterprise,\u201d Krigbaum said). Dumbwireless, however, has\nbeen much more successful.\n\nThe couple\u2019s home, in East Los Angeles, has turned into a kind of dumbphone\nemporium, with five hundred boxed devices stacked up in what was supposed to\nbe a dining room. Stults takes business calls on his personal cell, and on one\nrecent morning the first call came at 5 A.M. (As the lead on customer service,\nhe has to use a smartphone\u2014go figure.) They pack each order by hand, sometimes\nwith handwritten notes. They have not yet quit their day jobs, which are in\nthe service industry, but Dumbwireless sold more than seventy thousand\ndollars\u2019 worth of products last month, ten times more than in March, 2023.\nKrigbaum and Stults noticed an acceleration in sales last October, which they\nspeculate may have had something to do with the onslaught of holiday-shopping\nseason. Some of their popular phone offerings include the Light Phone, an\ne-ink device with almost no apps; the Nokia 2780, a traditional flip phone;\nand the Punkt., a calculator-ish Swiss device that looks like something\ndesigned for Neo to carry in \u201cThe Matrix\u201d (which, to be fair, is a movie of\nthe dumbphone era).\n\nThe growing dumbphone fervor may be motivated, in part, by the discourse\naround child safety online. Parents are increasingly confronted with evidence\nthat sites like Instagram and TikTok intentionally try to hook their children.\nUsing those sites can increase teens\u2019 anxiety and lower their self-esteem,\naccording to some studies, and smartphones make it so that kids are logged on\nconstantly. Why should this situation be any healthier for adults? After\nalmost two decades with iPhones, the public seems to be experiencing a\ncollective ennui with digital life. So many hours of each day are lived\nthrough our portable, glowing screens, but the Internet isn\u2019t even fun\nanymore. We lack the self-control to wean ourselves off, so we crave devices\nthat actively prevent us from getting sucked into them. That means opting out\nof the prevailing technology and into what Cal Newport, a contributing writer\nfor The New Yorker, has called a more considered \u201cdigital minimalism.\u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nFriday Night Blind: Bowling Without Sight\n\nThe Light Phone d\u00e9buted in 2017, before smartphone exhaustion became a\nmainstream ailment. The company\u2019s co-founders, Kaiwei Tang and Joe Hollier,\nhave sold tens of thousands of phones. The Light Phone II, released in 2019,\nfeatures a monochrome touch screen that allows users to make calls, send text\nmessages, and use a few custom apps: an alarm and timer, a calendar,\ndirections, notes, music and podcast libraries. There are no social-media apps\nor streaming apps. \u201cThe point is to create useful utility that does not have\nthe attention economy built in,\u201d Tang said. Like Dumbwireless, Light Phone has\nrecently been experiencing a surge in demand. From 2022 to 2023, its revenue\ndoubled, and it is on track to double again in 2024, the founders told me.\nHollier pointed to Jonathan Haidt\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d about\nthe adverse effects of smartphones on adolescents. Light Phone is receiving\nincreased inquiries and bulk-order requests from churches, schools, and after-\nschool programs. In September, 2022, the company began a partnership with a\nprivate school in Williamstown, Massachusetts, to provide Light Phones to the\ninstitution\u2019s staff members and students; smartphones are now prohibited on\ncampus. According to the school, the experiment has had a salutary effect both\non student classroom productivity and on campus social life. Tang told me,\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking to twenty to twenty-five schools now.\u201d\n\nTo Tang and Hollier\u2019s surprise, some of the most willing Light Phone converts\nare Gen Z-ers. Some of them are younger than the iPhone. Digital technology\nhas been an inevitable feature of their lives, yet they are also better\nequipped, or better motivated, than generations past to confront its negative\nimpacts. Apple recently allowed third-party developers to write software that\naccesses the iPhone\u2019s Screen Time function, meaning that some new programs can\nnow help users limit their screen time by blocking apps. T. J. Driver and Zach\nNasgowitz, two engineers in their early twenties, took advantage of this\nchange to create an iPhone accessory called Brick, to fight their own\nexcessive phone usage. Brick, which launched in September of 2023, is a\nmagnetized plastic cube with a corresponding app that allows you to select\nwhich features you want to block on your smartphone. Tapping the brick\nactivates or lifts the blockage. Driver and Nasgowitz started with one 3-D\nprinter to produce the accessories; now they have fifteen machines running\naround the clock and are shipping a few hundred products a day.\n\nThere is no one dumbphone solution for everyone. Each digital addict is\naddicted in her own way. Stults, of Dumbwireless, uses an app called Unpluq,\nwhich works similarly to Brick, blocking specific apps from his smartphone\nwhile allowing him to maintain the store\u2019s customer-service channels,\nincluding e-mail and Shopify. Krigbaum has been a committed Light Phone user\nfor the past two years. She said that she doesn\u2019t miss her smartphone, but\nthat her new device can cause some awkwardness when she meets other young\npeople who ask how to keep in touch. They mean on social media, of course; for\nthe vast swath of Gen Z-ers who don\u2019t use dumbphones, exchanging numbers to\ntext message or, God forbid, call seems archaic. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying, \u2018I guess\nI\u2019ll see you if I see you,\u2019 \u201d Krigbaum said.\n\nWhen I want to escape from my iPhone, I pop the SIM card out (which,\nunfortunately, is not possible on some newer iPhones) and install it in a red\nNokia 2780 flip phone\u2014the closing snap of which brings me back instantly to my\nhigh-school days, when flip phones were cutting edge. After the surprisingly\neasy switching process, I take the simple device with me on my daily walks\nwith my dog. If I had my smartphone in hand, I\u2019d be refreshing Instagram or\ncompulsively checking my e-mail while my hound does her business or sniffs\ntree trunks. With the Nokia, I\u2019ve cut myself off from such meaningless digital\nstimuli but preserved my ability to answer texts or phone calls if necessary.\n(I\u2019m too much of a millennial to actually leave the house without any phone.)\nI find myself looking more at my surroundings, which are particularly\nenjoyable in springtime, and I am more relaxed when I return from the\nexcursions. When I switch the SIM card back into my iPhone, the device seems\nmomentarily absurd: an enormous screen filled with infinite entertainment and\ninformation that follows me wherever I go. Then I open all my usual apps in\nquick succession\u2014e-mail, Instagram, Slack\u2014to see what I\u2019ve missed. \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Searching for the cause of a catastrophic plane crash.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * Gloria Steinem\u2019s life on the feminist frontier.\n\n  * Where the Amish go on vacation.\n\n  * How Colonel Sanders built his Kentucky-fried fortune.\n\n  * What does procrastination tell us about ourselves?\n\n  * Fiction by Patricia Highsmith: \u201cThe Trouble with Mrs. Blynn, the Trouble with the World\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nKyle Chayka is a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of, most\nrecently, \u201cFilterworld: How Algorithms Flattened Culture.\u201d\n\nMore:SmartphonesiPhonesScreen timeSocial MediaCell Phones\n\n### Goings On\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching, listening to, and doing this week, online, in N.Y.C., and\nbeyond.
