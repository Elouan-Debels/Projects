The attack\ncaused major Internet platforms and services to be unavailable to large\nswathes of users in Europe and North America.^[3]^[4] The groups Anonymous and\nNew World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack, but scant evidence\nwas provided.^[5]\n\nAs a DNS provider, Dyn provides to end-users the service of mapping an\nInternet domain name\u2014when, for instance, entered into a web browser\u2014to its\ncorresponding IP address. The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack was\naccomplished through numerous DNS lookup requests from tens of millions of IP\naddresses.^[6] The activities are believed to have been executed through a\nbotnet consisting of many Internet-connected devices\u2014such as printers, IP\ncameras, residential gateways and baby monitors\u2014that had been infected with\nthe Mirai malware.\n\n## Affected services[edit]\n\nServices affected by the attack included:\n\n  * Airbnb^[7]\n  * Amazon.com^[8]\n  * Ancestry.com^[9]^[10]\n  * The A.V.

The\nattribution of the attack to the Mirai botnet had been previously reported by\nBackConnect Inc., another security firm.^[35] Dyn stated that they were\nreceiving malicious requests from tens of millions of IP addresses.^[6]^[36]\nMirai is designed to brute-force the security on an IoT device, allowing it to\nbe controlled remotely.\n\nCybersecurity investigator Brian Krebs noted that the source code for Mirai\nhad been released onto the Internet in an open-source manner some weeks prior,\nwhich made the investigation of the perpetrator more difficult.^[37]\n\nOn 25 October 2016, US President Obama stated that the investigators still had\nno idea who carried out the cyberattack.^[38]\n\nOn 13 December 2017, the Justice Department announced that three men (Paras\nJha, 21, Josiah White, 20, and Dalton Norman, 21) had entered guilty pleas in\ncybercrime cases relating to the Mirai and clickfraud botnets.^[39]\n\n## Perpetrators[edit]\n\nIn correspondence with the website Politico, hacktivist groups SpainSquad,\nAnonymous, and New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack in\nretaliation against Ecuador's rescinding Internet access to WikiLeaks founder\nJulian Assange, at their embassy in London, where he had been granted\nasylum.^[5] This claim has yet to be confirmed.^[5] WikiLeaks alluded to the\nattack on Twitter, tweeting \"Mr. Assange is still alive and WikiLeaks is still\npublishing. We ask supporters to stop taking down the US internet. You proved\nyour point.\"^[40] New World Hackers has claimed responsibility in the past for\nsimilar attacks targeting sites like BBC and ESPN.com.^[41]\n\nOn October 26, FlashPoint stated that the attack was most likely done by\nscript kiddies.^[42]\n\nA November 17, 2016, a Forbes article reported that the attack was likely\ncarried out by \"an angry gamer\".^[43]\n\nOn December 9, 2020, one of the perpetrators pleaded guilty to taking part in\nthe attack. The perpetrator's name was withheld due to his or her age.^[44]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Internet portal\n\n  * WannaCry ransomware attack\n  * Mirai (malware)\n  * Vulnerability (computing)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Level3 outage?
