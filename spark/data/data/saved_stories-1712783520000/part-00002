Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nAfter years of living underground, two broods of cicadas will emerge later\nthis spring in parts of the Southeast and Midwest. The total number of cicadas\ncould reach a trillion, according to the University of Connecticut.\n\nThe two broods are periodical, meaning they only come aboveground once every\n13 or 17 years. Brood XIII, or the Northern Illinois Brood, surfaces every 17\nyears. Brood XIX (the Great Southern Brood), which appears every 13 years,\nwill join this spring.\n\nThis year marks the first time the two broods have emerged in the same year\nsince 1803. It won\u2019t happen again for another 221 years, according to the New\nYork Times. The two broods are adjacent, but don\u2019t significantly overlap, per\nthe University of Connecticut. They could both appear in small patches of\nwoods in Illinois.\n\nWhile the large-eyed, noisy herbivores are a bit of a nuisance to some people,\nentomologists are excited for this unusual event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this for many years,\u201d\nCatherine Dana, an entomologist specializing in cicadas at the University of\nIllinois at Urbana-Chicago tells the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Milman. \u201cFor the\npublic, it\u2019s going to be a really special experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s magical, and that\u2019s part of their name,\u201d Tamra Reall, an entomologist at\nthe University of Missouri, says to ABC News\u2019 Andy Fies and Julia Jacobo.\n\u201cTheir genus name is magicada, and it\u2019s because it\u2019s a magical experience.\u201d\n\nShaped like small candy bars with transparent wings, cicadas make up more than\n3,000 species. Females typically lay eggs in tree branches, and after a few\nmonths the youngsters hatch and burrow underground. They develop while feeding\non liquids from tree roots and resurface once they\u2019ve matured to lay their own\neggs. They tunnel from underground using their forelegs, molt after they\nemerge and then start searching for a mate, writes the New York Times\u2019 Aimee\nOrtiz.\n\nMales produce the trademark cicada buzz using membranes on their abdomens. The\nmales make mating calls that females respond to by flicking their wings.\n\nThe cicadas should start appearing later in April, according to ABC News. The\nGreat Southern Brood may cover the largest geographic area of any periodical\nbrood\u2014Brood XIX insects appear in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\nArkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, per the University of\nConnecticut. Brood XIII appears around Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile annual cicadas appear every year, periodical broods only emerge in\ncertain years and wait until the soil temperature reaches 65 degrees\nFahrenheit, per National Geographic. Scientists have theorized that by coming\nout in large numbers all at once, it helps ensure that enough of them will\nsurvive predation to spawn offspring, writes the Guardian.\n\nResearchers also think they know how cicadas know when another year has\npassed\u2014the tree sap they drink gets richer in amino acids once a year when the\ntree blossoms, writes Scientific American\u2019s Meghan Bartels.\n\n\u201cWe know that\u2019s what they count; where they\u2019re putting their little chalk\nmarks on the wall, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Martha Weiss, an insect ecologist at\nGeorgetown University, tells the publication. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand how\nthey\u2019re keeping track of it.\u201d\n\nCicadas aren\u2019t the most resilient individuals. They have many potential\npredators and not much in the way of defense mechanisms\u2014they don't bite or\nsting and aren\u2019t poisonous, per ABC News.\n\n\u201cThey feed everybody, including fish, snakes, small mammals, large mammals,\nbirds,\u201d Dana tells the publication. \u201cI like to think of this event as\npotentially buffering some of the losses that we\u2019ve seen in our wildlife\n[populations].\u201d\n\nCicadas are \u201cnot great fliers and even worse landers,\u201d ending up in places\nthey can get squished by cars and people, Floyd W. Shockley, an entomologist\nat the National Museum of Natural History, says to the New York Times.\n\nThe ground will be covered with young cicadas and discarded exoskeletons, and\ntrees and plants will be filled with adults, Evan Lampert, an insect ecologist\nat the University of North Georgia, tells ABC News. The noise the cicadas make\ncould be louder than a plane in some places, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cSit back and be in awe at the spectacle,\u201d John Cooley, a cicada expert at the\nUniversity of Connecticut, says to the Guardian. \u201cThen think about where you\nwill be in 13 or 17 years. It\u2019s a time for introspection.\u201d\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nWill Sullivan | | READ MORE\n\nWill Sullivan is a science writer based in Washington, D.C.
