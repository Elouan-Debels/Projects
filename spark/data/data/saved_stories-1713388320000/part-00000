Introducing World Chain\n\n# Introducing World Chain\n\nA blockchain for humans\n\nWorld Chain is a new blockchain designed for humans.\n\nIt will be open for everyone, and verified humans will get priority blockspace\nover bots as well as a gas allowance for casual transactions. Developers will\nbe able to reach millions of these real users around the world, with apps\nfocused on utility for everyday life.\n\nThe network will be deeply integrated with the Worldcoin protocol to\naccelerate growth and leverage World ID\u2019s Proof of Personhood. It will also be\nsecured by Ethereum as an L2 and engineered for scalability with the\nSuperchain ecosystem.\n\nImportantly, it will be permissionless, open source, and intended to\nultimately be independently governed by the community.\n\nWorld Chain is expected to launch later this summer.\n\nMint this announcement\n\n04/17/2024\n\n4 Minute Read\n\nBlockspace for all humansPriority & gas for humansReal world apps for millions\nof humansBy humanity, for humanity\n\nShare to social\n\nWorldcoin launched nine months ago to accelerate the adoption of Proof of\nPersonhood and decentralized finance, which will be fundamental in the age of\nAI.\n\nAlready more than 10 million people in 160 countries have created a World ID\nand a compatible wallet, which they\u2019ve used to perform 75 million\ntransactions. As of today, 5,002,025 people have also verified their World ID\nusing an Orb.\n\nContinuing to onboard people at this accelerated pace will require significant\nleaps in blockchain technology, particularly around efficiency, user\nexperience, and utility.\n\nThis is an initial preview of World Chain\u2014a blockchain designed for humans,\nbuilt to scale the Worldcoin protocol and the broader Ethereum community to 1\nbillion people and beyond.\n\n## Blockspace for all humans\n\nWorldcoin user transactions currently represent about 44% of OP Mainnet\u2019s\nactivity, making it the largest application on the network. Often during\nspikes this rises over 80%, and at times it flat out exceeds the limits. Given\nthe scale and growth rate of the community, it\u2019s time to graduate to a\ndedicated network.\n\nWorldcoin users currently represent about 44% of all L2 gas consumed on OP\nMainnet.\n\nWorld Chain is designed first and foremost to significantly increase capacity\nso new people can continue to join at scale, and existing users can enjoy\nfaster, cheaper, and more reliable transactions.\n\nMigrating to a dedicated network will already yield meaningful gains. After\nthis, World Chain will be on the forefront of scaling and decentralizing the\nLayer 2 paradigm on Ethereum with the Superchain ecosystem. For more details\nvisit the technical post.\n\n## Priority & gas for humans\n\nMuch like the rest of the internet, many of the problems blockchains face\ntoday are aggravated by \u201cbots\u201d. By some estimates, as many as 80% of\nblockchain transactions are automated, and while many are for valid use cases,\nunproductive bots like airdrop farming ones often lead to congested networks\nand high fees. Ironically this tends to get worse as blockchains optimize for\nlow gas fees and high throughput.\n\nWorld Chain will address this with World ID. Just as people can use World ID\nto anonymously prove their humanity on apps\u2014like Discord servers and\nSubreddits\u2014they will have the ability to verify their addresses on World\nChain. This is optional and anonymized through zero-knowledge proofs, meaning\naddresses are fully delinked from the person\u2019s identity, and they simply get a\nverification akin to a blue checkmark.\n\nWorld Chain users can optionally and anonymously verify their addresses as\nreal humans using World ID to get priority blockspace and a gas allowance.\n\nAs a permissionless network, everyone will be able submit transactions to\nWorld Chain, but those created by verified humans will be prioritized for\nfaster confirmation times.\n\nVerified addresses will also receive an allowance of some free gas. The goal\nis not just to be more inclusive, but to minimize the friction to get started.\nThe protocol will seek to reach an equilibrium where gas for casual users is\nultimately covered by fees from bots and power users. In the meantime, it will\nbe sponsored by the Worldcoin Foundation.\n\nLastly, in addition to ETH which will remain the native token, it will be easy\nto pay fees using WLD. This means that when verified humans claim their WLD\ngrants every two weeks (where available*), they will immediately be able to\nuse it for their favorite apps.\n\n## Real world apps for millions of humans\n\nFor developers, World Chain will be a place to reach onchain users at scale.\nFrom day one more than 10 million people across 160 countries will be able to\nexplore and use onchain apps through compatible wallets, starting with World\nApp.\n\nRather than trying to cover every possible blockchain use case, World Chain\nwill be an ecosystem of decentralized financial and identity apps focused on\nutility for everyday life. This will be uniquely enabled by World ID\u2019s sybil\nresistance and built around Worldcoin, stablecoins, payments, rewards, ramps,\nlending, swapping, and more.\n\nFuture Worldcoin Community Grants, including the recently announced Wave 1\nprogram, will support developers in the community, and they will also be\neligible for consideration in Optimism Retroactive public goods funding. For\nany other types of World Chain partnerships you can reach out to the Worldcoin\nFoundation.\n\n## By humanity, for humanity\n\nAlong with the rest of Worldcoin, for World Chain to succeed it must be built,\nowned and governed by all of humanity.\n\nFrom day one it will be open source, permissionless and Ethereum aligned.\nDevelopers supporting the Worldcoin protocol will continue to contribute\ndirectly to the Ethereum network (just like they did for EIP-4844) and\ncollaborate with the developers working on the Optimism and Base networks, as\nwell as the rest of the Superchain ecosystem, on shared infrastructure,\nscaling, security and interoperability.\n\nImportantly, World ID and WLD will remain neutral public goods able to be used\nand deployed on networks beyond World Chain.\n\nWe expect a developer preview of World Chain very soon, and a full launch\nlater this summer.\n\nYou can apply for a Worldcoin Community Grant to build on World Chain today,\nreach out for partnerships and join the conversation on X and Discord.\n\nMint this announcement\n\nDisclaimer\n\n*Eligibility for Worldcoin (WLD) tokens is restricted based on geography, age, and other factors.
