You may see more images each second, scientists say\n\nElite athletes and professional gamers may have higher than average visual\ntemporal resolution, research suggests\n\nLinda Geddes Science correspondent\n\nShare\n\nIf you have wondered why your partner always beats you at tennis or one child\nalways crushes the other at Fortnite, it seems there is more to it than pure\nphysical ability.\n\nSome people are effectively able to see more \u201cimages per second\u201d than others,\nresearch suggests, meaning they\u2019re innately better at spotting or tracking\nfast-moving objects such as tennis balls.\n\nThe rate at which our brains can discriminate between different visual signals\nis known as temporal resolution, and influences the speed at which we are able\nto respond to changes in our environment.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that animals with high visual temporal\nresolution tend to be species with fast-paced lives, such as predators. Human\nresearch has also suggested that this trait tends to decrease as we get older,\nand dips temporarily after intense exercise. However, it was not clear how\nmuch it varies between people of similar ages.\n\nOne way of measuring this trait is to identify the point at which someone\nstops perceiving a flickering light to flicker, and sees it as a constant or\nstill light instead. Clinton Haarlem, a PhD candidate at Trinity College\nDublin, and his colleagues tested this in 80 men and women between the ages of\n18 and 35, and found wide variability in the threshold at which this happened.\n\nThe research, published in Plos One, found that some people reported a light\nsource as constant when it was in fact flashing about 35 times a second, while\nothers could still detect flashes at rates of greater than 60 times a second.\n\nThis is still some way off the temporal resolution of peregrine falcons, which\nare able to process roughly 100 visual frames a second.\n\nHaarlem said: \u201cWe think that people who see flicker at higher rates basically\nhave access to a little bit more visual information per timeframe than people\non the lower end of the spectrum.\u201d\n\nProf Kevin Mitchell, a neurobiologist at Trinity College Dublin who supervised\nthe research, said: \u201cBecause we only have access to our own subjective\nexperience, we might naively expect that everyone else perceives the world in\nthe same way we do. This study characterises one such difference. Some people\nreally do seem to see the world faster than others.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that visual temporal resolution appeared to be relatively\nstable over time within individuals, and that there was little difference\nbetween men and women.\n\nWhile it is not yet clear how such variation might affect our day-to-day\nlives, Haarlem suspects elite athletes and professional gamers may have higher\nthan average visual temporal resolution.\n\n\u201cWe believe that individual differences in perception speed might become\napparent in high-speed situations where one might need to locate or track\nfast-moving objects, such as in ball sports, or in situations where visual\nscenes change rapidly, such as in competitive gaming,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey may have an advantage over others before they have even picked up a\nracket and hit a tennis ball, or grabbed a controller and jumped into some\nfantasy world online.\u201d\n\nOne outstanding question is the extent to which this trait is trainable. While\npeople\u2019s reaction speeds can improve with practice, this is thought to relate\nto how long it takes them to respond to something after their brains have\nvisually perceived it.\n\nHaarlem said: \u201cThis is more like the information coming in to begin with.\n\n\u201cAt this stage we don\u2019t really know much about where this variation is coming\nfrom, and what it is connected to. It could have to do with our eyes, or it\ncould be related to the brain filtering out information.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Neuroscience\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### VR goggles for mice create immersive scenarios for brain research\n\n8 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Goalkeepers perceive the world differently, study suggests\n\n9 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### \n\nScience Weekly\n\nCould we end migraines for good? \u2013 podcast\n\n28 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### \n\nScience Weekly\n\nHas a 25-year-old bet taken us a step closer to understanding consciousness? \u2013\npodcast\n\n13 Jul 2023\n\n  * ### Short daytime naps may keep brain healthy as it ages, study says\n\n20 Jun 2023\n\n  * ### Paralysed man walks using device that reconnects brain with muscles\n\n24 May 2023\n\n  * ### Scientists discover brain signals for chronic pain\n\n22 May 2023\n\n  * ### Talking to babies may help shape brain structure, research finds\n\n15 May 2023\n\n  * ### \n\nScience Weekly\n\nWill psychedelic drugs transform mental health treatment? \u2013 podcast\n\n9 May 2023\n\n  * ### The big idea: why colour is in the eye of the beholder\n\n8 May 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
