Here, you will\nfind a meticulous compilation of data, analyses, and coverage from national\nand international media, providing a broad and unfiltered view of the events\nthat have shaped public debate.\n\nJoin us in our mission to bring clarity and awareness about the challenges\nfaced by society in the digital age, advocating for a future where\ncommunication is free and not curtailed by hidden interests.\n\nStart Here\n\n## Twitter Files - Brazil\n\nBrazil is engaged in a sweeping crackdown on free speech led by a Supreme\nCourt justice named Alexandre de Moraes. De Moraes has thrown people in jail\nwithout trial for things they posted on social media. He has demanded the\nremoval of users from social media platforms. He has required the censorship\nof specific posts without giving users any right of appeal or even the right\nto see the evidence presented against them.\n\nNow, Twitter Files, released here for the first time, reveal that de Moraes\nand the Superior Electoral Court he controls engaged in a clear attempt to\nundermine democracy in Brazil. They:\n\n  * illegally demanded that Twitter reveal personal details about Twitter users who used hashtags he did not like;\n  * demanded access to Twitter\u2019s internal data, in violation of Twitter policy;\n  * sought to censor, unilaterally, Twitter posts by sitting members of Brazil\u2019s Congress;\n  * sought to weaponize Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies against supporters of then-president Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe Files show the origins of the Brazilian judiciary\u2019s demand for sweeping\ncensorship powers, the court\u2019s use of censorship for anti-democratic election\ninterference, and the birth of the Censorship Industrial Complex in Brazil.\nTWITTER FILES - BRAZIL was written by Michael Shellenberger, David \u00c1gape, and\nEli Vieira.\n\nWe presented these findings to de Moraes, the Supreme Court (STF), and the\nHigh Electoral Court (TSE). None responded. Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n\u201cWe are... pushing back against the requests...\u201d On February 14, 2020,\nTwitter\u2019s legal counsel in Brazil, Rafael Batista, emailed his colleagues to\ndescribe a hearing in Congress on \u201cDisinformation and 'fake news.\u201d\n\nBatista revealed that members of Brazil\u2019s Congress had asked Twitter for the\n\u201ccontent of messages exchanged by some users via DMs\u201d as well as \u201clogin\nrecords - among other info.\u201d\n\nBatista said, \u201cWe are... pushing back against the requests,\u201d which were\nillegal, \u201cbecause they do not meet [Brazilian Internet law] Marco Civil legal\nrequirements for disclosure of user's records.\u201d\n\nBatista noted that some conservative Twitter users had gone to the Supreme\nCourt \u201cafter they learned from the media that the Congress was trying to get\ntheir IPs and DM content. In light of this, the Supreme Court granted an\ninjunction suspending the requirement given its failure to fulfill legal\nrequirements.\u201d\n\n# Context:\n\nBrazil\u2019s Supreme Court and Superior Electoral Court Seven justices comprise\nBrazil\u2019s Superior Electoral Court (TSE). Three of those justices are also\nmembers of the Supreme Court (STF). One of them, Alexandre de Moraes, presides\nover the TSE.\n\nHere's background on the rise of Brazil's Censorship Industrial Complex by\nDavid \u00c1gape:\n\n\u201cGoogle, Facebook, Uber, WhatsApp and Instagram provide registration data and\nphone numbers without court order\u201d\n\nOn January 27, 2021, Batista emailed his colleagues about a police\ninvestigation against him for refusing to give personal Twitter user data to\nthe S\u00e3o Paulo State Public Prosecutor Office.\n\nThe Prosecutor claimed that Twitter\u2019s \u201cattitude is isolated, because all the\nother big technology companies such as Google, Facebook, Uber, WhatsApp, and\nInstagram provide registration data and phone numbers without a court order.\"\n\nBut Twitter \u201chas not [sic] affirmative obligation to collect registration\ndata\u201d explained Batista to the prosecutor and \u201cthere is no phone number\nassociated with the account under investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first time an actual criminal investigation was filed against an\nemployee\u201d\n\nOn February 18, 2021, Batista emailed his colleagues again to report back on\nhis deposition. He said he told the prosecutor that \u201cTwitter operates in\nBrazil since 2012 and this is the first time an actual criminal investigation\nwas filed against an employee for allegedly non-compliance either with a\nrequest or a court order.\u201d\n\nBatista said he pointed out that \u201cThere is no affirmative obligation in the\ncountry for collection and consequently provision of 'registration data.\"\nMoreover, Brazil\u2019s Internet privacy law, \u201cMarco Civil... covers only:\"\n\nI - physical address; and\n\nII - personal qualifications: understood as full name, marital status and\nprofession\" - none of them collected by Twitter.\u201d\n\n## \u201cWe are unfortunately living strange times in Brazil.\u201d\n\nOne month later, on March 18, Batista emailed his colleagues again, this time\nwith, \u201cGreat news!\u201d\n\nA judge rejected the prosecutor\u2019s request for \u201cprivate user information absent\na court order\u201d and also \u201crebukes the prosecutor for forcing compliance through\na non-existent obligation, without clarity about the purpose of the criminal\ninvestigation and most importantly, reinforcing that acts that seek to\nidentify private and constitutionally protected information require previous\njudicial review.\u201d\n\nBatista's colleague Regina Lima replied to his email, \u201cWhat Rafa forgot to\nmention is that the employee under threat here was him. The matter continued\nto escalate in a dangerous way, and his resilience throughout the process was\namazing.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe are unfortunately living strange times in Brazil. We are seeing\na concerning trend on aggressive law enforcement requests and court orders\nrestricting fundamental rights.\u201d\n\n## \u201cAn unfortunate and surprising update.\u201d\n\nThen, on March 30, Batista emailed his colleagues again with \u201cAn unfortunate\nand surprising update\u201d: the S\u00e3o Paulo State Public Prosecutor Office was back\non the attack, \u201cinitiating a criminal proceeding\u201d and claiming a \u201cconflict of\ninterest/lack of impartiality of the Judge.\u201d\n\nOne week later, on April 5, 2021, Batista emailed his colleagues to say, \u201cI am\nhappy to share that we had great and relieving news.... The criminal court\npreliminary dismissed the charges against me mainly because it was not\npossible to identify any element of crime in my conduct.\u201d\n\nThe ruling was because Twitter does not collect \u201cregistration data\u201d of its\nusers and the Marco Civil \u201cclearly states that access to protected information\nsuch email - personal data - could only be done through specific judicial\nreview.\u201d\n\n## \u201cGoogle Brazil... weakens our stance on privacy since we have always pushed\nback...\"\n\nOn May 31, 2021, Batista wrote to his colleagues to lament that \u201cGoogle\ndelivered to the Brazilian Senate at least 200 gigs of videos that had been\ndeleted from YouTube by people connected to the federal government\u201d related to\na Brazilian Senate investigation of the government\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nBatista called Google\u2019s actions \u201ca very concerning precedent... that\ncontradicts and weakens our stance towards privacy since we have always pushed\nback against requests from congressional commissions, even when involving only\nbasic subscribe info and IPs....\u201d\n\nIn the same email, Batista noted that a member of Congress named Gleisi\nHoffmann, who presides over Lula da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, and who had sued\nTwitter for \u201cattacks against her honor,\u201d seeking \u201cprivate data and removal of\nsome Tweets,\u201d had finally dropped her lawsuit.\n\n## \"Unmask several Twitter accounts...\"\n\nIn the same email, Batista noted that a court in S\u00e3o Paulo had demanded that\nTwitter \u201cunmask several Twitter accounts... related to criticism/alleged\noffenses against Fernando Capez, a Brazilian professor and politician, former\ncongressman and currently special secretary in the S\u00e3o Paulo Consumer\nProtection Agency\u201d who was \u201ca defendant in criminal proceedings - recently a\nfederal court seized millions of reais from his bank account and the Tweets\nare related to these facts. We will therefore push back against this court\norder...\u201d\n\n## \u201cWe won't deliver any name at this stage...\u201d\n\nOn June 11, 2021, Batista emailed his colleagues to say that the government\nhad opened a criminal investigation against Twitter and that Brazilian\n\u201cauthorities are seeking the name and address of the person responsible for\nconducting the case internally at Twitter...\u201d\n\nBatista reassured his colleagues: \u201cWe won't deliver any name at this stage...\u201d\n\n## \u201cEven though the complaint is legitimate, the requests are unreasonable.\u201d\n\nBatista emailed his colleagues on June 14, 2021, to say that \u201cTwitter was\nserved last year with a 'complaint notice', which now was turned into a civil\ninvestigation against us.\u201d\n\nBatista explained that \u201cThe complaint was brought by Djamila Ribeiro, a\nBrazilian philosopher and journalist after racist offenses/hate crimes\ndirected to her (no specific content has been provided though). Among several\nrequests, she is seeking:\n\ni) monitoring measures of all trending topics to avoid offensive content\nespecially against black woman;\n\nii) disclosure of user information without court orders in racially motivated\ncrimes;\n\niii) message triggers in a regular basis informing people about ethical and\nlegal parameters of responsibility for what is published on social networks;\n\niv) standard messages/texts about such ethical and legal parameters to new\nusers;\n\nv) payment of collective moral damages.\"\n\nAnother case related to an \u201cextreme right\u201d blogger \u201cakin to Alex Jones\u201d named\nAllan dos Santos.\n\nTwitter wanted to suspend the user, explained Batista, but \u201cthe user's history\nof litigating to keep their accounts active... we worry that the inherent\nmessiness of the internal reviews [at Twitter] could make it challenging to\nexplain the basis of a suspension action.\n\nTherefore we've agreed to let the strike system play out, and have us take\naction when it is clear and unambiguous upon their next violation of our\nrules, which is just a matter of time considering his list of violations and\nrecent Tweets on COVID issues/misinfo...\u201d\n\n## Information \u201crelated to @CarlosBolsonaro (president's son)\u201d\n\nOn July 2, 2021, Batista reported on an information request \u201crelated to Carlos\nBolsonaro (president's son) - We received an official letter from the federal\npolice supported by a court order seeking registration data from\n@CarlosBolsonaro.\n\nTherefore, we are working on a reply where we will push back as follow\n\n(i) Twitter does not collect registration data - which under BR definition\nrefers to personal data such as professional qualification, address and full\nname;\n\n(ii) it is not possible to provide data relating to a specific tweet - no IP\navailable;\n\n(iii) even if it were possible, the legal retention period of logs in BR are 6\nmonths and it has already been exceeded - Tweets are from 2018; and\n\n(iv) the profile @CarlosBolsonaro is a verified account.\"\n\n## \u201cThere is a strong political component with this investigation.\u201d\n\nOn August 18, 2021, Batista emailed his colleagues to say that the Superior\nElectoral Court has demanded that the accounts of \u201cheavy supporters of\nPresident Bolsonaro\u201d who \u201chave been constantly engaging in coordinated attacks\nagainst members of the Supreme Court\u201d and \u201cSuperior Electoral Court... The\ncourt order is focused on the demonetization of these accounts - from\ndifferent platforms...\u201d\n\nThese demands appeared to be politically motivated to target pro-Bolsonaro\nsentiment. \u201cEven though this obligation initially does not touch us, the court\nalso determined Twitter, YouTube, Twitch TV, Instagram and Facebook to:\n\ni) refrain from algorithmically suggesting profiles and videos of political\ncontent discrediting the electoral system (legitimacy of elections) in\nassociation with those users/accounts and also\n\nii) identify the origin of specific content (we have not been served with any\nspecific Tweet URLs).\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s Head of Legal Diego de Lima Gualda, a colleague of Batista\u2019s,\nresponded saying, \u201cThere is a strong political component with this\ninvestigation and the court is trying to put pressure for compliance.\u201d\n\n## The \u201ccourt wants to identify account handles... and also somehow reduce\nengagement.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, On August 20, 2021, Batista reported some alarming news about\nnew demands from the Superior Electoral Court (TSE).\n\nBatista reported that \u201cit seems like the court wants to identify account\nhandles that would have specifically added certain types of trending hashtags\nand also somehow reduce engagement of specific content on the platform (ie.\nrefrain specific accounts from being suggested to others.\u201d\n\nThis represented a significant escalation in the court\u2019s anti-democratic\nefforts. Batista noted that \u201cPresident Bolsonaro himself and several of his\nsupporters are being investigated in this procedure (15 Twitter account\nhandles have been provided so far).\u201d\n\n## \u201cWe are going to push back.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s High Electoral Court (TSE), which de Moraes controls, also demanded\nthat Twitter reveal the identities of users.\n\nOn October 25, 2021, Twitter\u2019s senior legal counsel, Rafael Batista, emailed\nhis colleagues to let them know that the TSE was \u201ccompelling us to track down\nand unmask users who used specific hashtags.\u201d\n\nThe TSE\u2019s request was illegal, noted Batista, and so Twitter would resist the\ncourt\u2019s order. Batista said that Twitter was \u201cgoing to push back\u201d because\nthere was \u201cno evidence of illegality in the use of hashtags\u201d and because the\nTSE was demanding \u201cmass and indiscriminate disclosure of private user data,\nwhich characterizes a violation of privacy and other constitutional rights.\"\n\n## On November 26, 2021, the courts of Brazil issued sweeping censorship\ndemands.\n\nA court of appeals orders Twitter to \u201cglobally remove,\u201d not just in Brazil,\n\u201cspecific URLs related to the plaintiff.\u201d The court claimed that Brazilians\ncould find other ways to see the content, such as through a VPN, which masks a\nuser\u2019s location.\n\nThe court also sought to know the identities of users who were not in Brazil.\nIn another case, Twitter was \u201cpushing back against an injunction that granted\ndata provision (IP logs) to unmask 62 accounts that retweeted an original\nillegal content...\u201d Of the 62 accounts, \u201c8 accounts are not even located in\nBrazil...\u201d\n\n## The Police are \u201cunder a lot of pressure from the Superior Electoral Court.\u201d\n\nIn March 2022, Twitter\u2019s Head of Legal for Latin America said that he met with\n\u201cthe judge,\u201d referring to de Moraes.\n\nHe said he was surprised to find there the Federal Police (Brazil\u2019s FBI) and\ntechnical court staff working on the hashtag investigation.\n\nTSE pushed for private user data under the justification of \u201cexceptional\ncircumstances\u201d and wanted to use Twitter as a crime precognition machine to\n\u201canticipate potential illegal activities.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, Gualda said that the Federal Police \u201cis under a lot of\npressure from the Superior Electoral Court to provide tangible results for\nthis investigation (remembering that in this procedure the Federal Police is\nsupporting an investigation that is conducted by the Superior Electoral Court\nitself).\u201d\n\n## \u201cThere is no reason for this lawsuit to be under court secrecy.\u201d\n\nLeading up to the 2022 presidential election in Brazil, TSE made censorship\ndemands to prevent citizens from commenting on election policies and\nprocedures.\n\nOn March 30, 2022, the day after de Moraes took office as president of the\nTSE, the TSE mandated Twitter to, within a week and under the threat of a\ndaily fine of 50,000 BRL (US$ 10,000), supply data on the monthly trend\nstatistics for the hashtags #VotoImpressoNAO (\u201cPrinteVoteNo\u201d) and\n#VotoDemocraticoAuditavel (\u201cDemocraticAuditableVote\u201d).\n\nAdditionally, the TSE demanded subscription information and IP addresses of\nusers who used the hashtag #VotoDemocraticoAuditavel in 2021. Brazilians\nwanted to debate printouts to enhance their unique voting machines, but the\nTSE wasn\u2019t happy about their cause and pressured Twitter to give up their\npersonal data.\n\nIn an e-mail sent in November 2022, a Twitter lawyer detailed actions taken by\nMoraes and TSE during the presidential race. The judge wouldn\u2019t explain why he\nordered Twitter to remove Evangelical pastor Andr\u00e9 Valad\u00e3o\u2019s (@andrevaladao)\nentire account under a heavy fine.\n\nTwitter \u201cfiled an appeal against the order\u201d, pointing out they didn\u2019t know why\nthey were being ordered to do so, but complying. TSE would threaten Twitter to\ncomply \u201cin 1 hour\u201d under an hourly fine of BRL 100,000 [US$ 20,000] to censor\nan inactive account for disinformation committed elsewhere.\n\nTSE also targeted elected House members Carla Zambelli (@Zambelli2210) &\nMarcel van Hattem (@marcelvanhattem) for alleged misinformation, threatening a\nfine of BRL 150,000 (US$ 30,000) if Twitter did not comply within 1 hour.\nTwitter pushed back. Among other objections, it argued that \u201cthere is no\nreason for this lawsuit to be under court secrecy.\u201d\n\n## \u201cUnusual requests .... compelling us to provide... user data based on\nhashtag mentions.\u201d\n\nOn August 17, 2022, a member of Twitter\u2019s legal team emailed the groups saying\nthat Twitter \u201creceived a new court order\u201d relating to \u201can inquiry with the aim\nto identify individuals/groups behind a potential coordination of efforts to\nattack the institutions and the electoral system across different platforms.\n\nPresident Bolsonaro himself is investigated in this process...\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe have received several unusual requests coming from this\ninquiry, the most recent relevant one compelling us to provide an undetermined\namount of user data based on hashtag mentions.\n\nThe hashtags concern a mobilization around the elections - roughly translated\nas #PrintedVoteNO; #DemocraticAuditableVote and #BarrosoInJail - Barroso is\nthe former TSE President....According to the report we currently have, there\nwere 182 tweets in the period of interest... We need the content, user handles\nand respective BSI data asap...\u201d\n\n## \u201cTSE\u2019s request is clearly abusive\u201d\n\n\u201cTSE\u2019s request is clearly abusive\u201d, Brazilian attorney and legal scholar Hugo\nFreitas told us, when asked about the situation.\n\n\u201cPosting hashtags to promote legislative changes is completely appropriate for\na democracy and it\u2019s no crime predicted by Brazilian law.\u201d\n\n## Three months after de Moraes became TSE\u2019s president in August 2022, he\ndemanded censorship.\n\nDespite the fact that posting hashtags does not violate any specific legal\nstatutes, Twitter complied with the court's demands to avoid substantial\nfines.\n\nBrazil\u2019s high court and Twitter removed political speech and penalized users\nfor debating policies. In this way, the court appears to have interfered in a\nmajor presidential election.\n\n## Today: Fake News Bill For Censorship\n\nToday, Brazil\u2019s Censorship Industrial Complex is demanding that Congress pass\n\u201cFake News\u201d censorship legislation. The bill would hold social media companies\nhostage if they didn\u2019t comply with vague censorship requirements. The bill\ndoesn\u2019t define what \u201cfake news\u201d or \u201cdisinformation\u201d are.\n\nWhat the Fake News bill would do is require social media platforms to pay news\noutlets for the right to distribute their content. This is the exact same\napproach being pushed by governments in Australia and Canada.\n\nDe Moraes, the TSE, and Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court openly lobbied for the\nlegislation.\n\nThe public revolted against the censorship bill, and Congress stalled the bill\nin May 2023.\n\nThen, in February of this year, the TSE unilaterally implemented the\nlegislation, usurping the role of Congress.\n\n## No Free Speech In An Election\n\nTSE\u2019s censorship is an attack on the democratic process. Elections can remain\nfree and fair only if the public is able to debate and question election laws,\nsystems, and results. If there ever is electoral fraud in Brazil, nobody will\nbe allowed to talk about it, if de Moraes gets his way.\n\nFor centuries, candidates have complained that the election was stolen.\nHillary Clinton claimed this in 2016, Stacey Abrams claimed this in 2018,\nPresident Donald Trump claimed this in 2020, and President Jair Bolsonaro\nclaimed this in 2022.\n\nDe Moraes wants to make such speech illegal and punish social media platforms\nthat don\u2019t censor it.\n\n## The Solution: First Amendment-Level Protections For Brazil\n\nTwo legal scholars, Hugo Freitas and Andr\u00e9 Marsiglia, recently introduced new\nfree speech legislation aimed at bringing free speech protections in Brazil to\nthe same high standard as is held in the United States. The bill is a\n\u201cDeclaration of Rights of Freedom of Expression in Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe bill seeks to proclaim a Declaration of Free Speech Rights in Brazil,\nwhich, if enacted, would roughly align Brazilian law to that of the United\nStates in this regard.\n\nIt proposes to repeal the criminalization of speech in all but the most\nextreme instances, such as true threats or incitement to imminent lawless\naction. In contrast, conducts such as blasphemy, contempt of authority or\ncertain forms of hate speech and disinformation would cease to be\ncriminalized. The protection of political speech is especially emphasized.\n\nIn tort cases, the bill seeks to reduce judicial discretion by laying out\nclearer standards for assessing if the speech is protected or crosses into\nillegal conduct. In particular, the bill repeals provisions that have been\nused by prosecutors and private associations to retaliate against speech by\nclaiming compensatory damages, under allegations such as that it has caused\noffense to an unknown number of listeners or tarnished the reputation of broad\ncategories of people.\n\nFinally, the bill concerns itself with more modern forms of censorship\ntargeting the internet. A blanket ban is imposed on the practice, now frequent\nin Brazil, of government blocking the access to specific social media accounts\nin response to speech.\n\nMore subtle forms of internet censorship are also addressed. The government is\nbarred from censoring speech indirectly under the guise of content moderation\nby private platforms, following in the footsteps of recent court decisions in\nthe US. The bill reaffirms the provisions already in place in Brazilian\nlegislation exempting social media platforms from liability for the speech of\nits users in response to attempts by the government to revoke those provisions\nso as to force social media companies to censor preemptively according to\ngovernment wishes.\n\n/END\n\n### Website Created and Maintained by Roberto Arag\u00e3o\n\nGet in Touch\n\n2024 Twitter Files Brazil\n\n", "frontpage": true}
