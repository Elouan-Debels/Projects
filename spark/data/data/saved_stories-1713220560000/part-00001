Robinson\n\nfiled 02 August 2020 in Editor\u2019s Notes\n\nPaywalls are justified, even though they are annoying. It costs money to\nproduce good writing, to run a website, to license photographs. A lot of\nmoney, if you want quality. Asking people for a fee to access content is\ntherefore very reasonable. You don\u2019t expect to get a print subscription to the\nnewspaper gratis, why would a website be different? I try not to grumble about\nhaving to pay for online content, because I run a magazine and I know how\ndifficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.\n\nBut let us also notice something: the New York Times, the New Yorker, the\nWashington Post, the New Republic, New York, Harper\u2019s, the New York Review of\nBooks, the Financial Times, and the London Times all have paywalls. Breitbart,\nFox News, the Daily Wire, the Federalist, the Washington Examiner, InfoWars:\nfree! You want \u201cPortland Protesters Burn Bibles, American Flags In The\nStreets,\u201d \u201cThe Moral Case Against Mask Mandates And Other COVID Restrictions,\u201d\nor an article suggesting the National Institutes of Health has admitted 5G\nphones cause coronavirus\u2014they\u2019re yours. You want the detailed Times reports on\nneo-Nazis infiltrating German institutions, the reasons contact tracing is\nfailing in U.S. states, or the Trump administration\u2019s undercutting of the\nUSPS\u2019s effectiveness\u2014well, if you\u2019ve clicked around the website a bit you\u2019ll\nrun straight into the paywall. This doesn\u2019t mean the paywall shouldn\u2019t be\nthere. But it does mean that it costs time and money to access a lot of true\nand important information, while a lot of bullshit is completely free.\n\nNow, crucially, I do not mean to imply here that reading the New York Times\ngives you a sound grasp of reality. I have documented many times how the Times\nmisleads people, for instance by repeating the dubious idea that we have a\n\u201cborder crisis\u201d of migrants \u201cpouring into\u201d the country or that Russia is\ntrying to \u201csteal\u201d life-saving vaccine research that should be free anyway. But\nit\u2019s important to understand the problem with the Times: it is not that the\nfacts it reports tend to be inaccurate\u2014though sometimes they are\u2014but that the\nfacts are presented in a way that misleads. There is no single \u201cfact\u201d in the\nmigrant story or the Russia story that I take issue with, what I take issue\nwith is the conclusions that are being drawn from the facts. (Likewise, the\nheadline \u201cU.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest For A-Bomb Parts\u201d is technically\naccurate: the U.S. government did, in fact, say that. It was just not true.)\nThe New York Times is, in fact, extremely valuable, if you read it critically\nand look past the headlines. Usually the truth is in there somewhere, as there\nis a great deal of excellent reporting, and one could almost construct a\nserious newspaper purely from material culled from the New York Times. I\u2019ve\nwritten before about the Times\u2019 reporting on Hitler and the Holocaust: it\nwasn\u2019t that the grim facts of the situation were left out of the paper, but\nthat they were buried at the back and treated as unimportant. It was changes\nin emphasis that were needed, because the facts were there in black and white.\n\nThis means that a lot of the most vital information will end up locked behind\nthe paywall. And while I am not much of a New Yorker fan either, it\u2019s\nconcerning that the Hoover Institute will freely give you Richard Epstein\u2019s\ninfamous article downplaying the threat of coronavirus, but Isaac Chotiner\u2019s\ninterview demolishing Epstein requires a monthly subscription, meaning that\nthe lie is more accessible than its refutation. Eric Levitz of New York is one\nof the best and most prolific left political commentators we have. But unless\nyou\u2019re a subscriber of New York, you won\u2019t get to hear much of what he has to\nsay each month.\n\nPossibly even worse is the fact that so much academic writing is kept behind\nvastly more costly paywalls. A white supremacist on YouTube will tell you all\nabout race and IQ but if you want to read a careful scholarly refutation,\nobtaining a legal PDF from the journal publisher would cost you $14.95, a\nprice nobody in their right mind would pay for one article if they can\u2019t get\ninstitutional access. (I recently gave up on trying to access a scholarly\narticle because I could not find a way to get it for less than $39.95, though\nin that case the article was garbage rather than gold.) Academic publishing is\na nightmarish patchwork, with lots of articles advertised at exorbitant fees\non one site, and then for free on another, or accessible only through certain\ndatabases, which your university or public library may or may not have access\nto. (Libraries have to budget carefully because subscription prices are often\nnuts. A library subscription to the Journal of Coordination Chemistry, for\ninstance, costs $11,367 annually.)\n\nOf course, people can find their ways around paywalls. SciHub is a completely\nillegal but extremely convenient means of obtaining academic research for\nfree. (I am purely describing it, not advocating it.) You can find a free\nversion of the article debunking race and IQ myths on ResearchGate, a site\nthat has engaged in mass copyright infringement in order to make research\naccessible. Often, because journal publishers tightly control access to their\ncopyrighted work in order to charge those exorbitant fees for PDFs, the\nversions of articles that you can get for free are drafts that have not yet\ngone through peer review, and have thus been subjected to less scrutiny. This\nmeans that the more reliable an article is, the less accessible it is. On the\nother hand, pseudo-scholarhip is easy to find. Right-wing think tanks like the\nCato Institute, the Foundation for Economic Education, the Hoover Institution,\nthe Mackinac Center, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Heritage\nFoundation pump out slickly-produced policy documents on every subject under\nthe sun. They are utterly untrustworthy\u2014the conclusion is always going to be\n\u201clet the free market handle the problem,\u201d no matter what the problem or what\nthe facts of the case. But it is often dressed up to look sober-minded and\nnon-ideological.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy or cheap to be an \u201cindependent researcher.\u201d When I was writing\nmy first book, Superpredator, I wanted to look through newspaper, magazine,\nand journal archives to find everything I could about Bill Clinton\u2019s record on\nrace. I was lucky I had a university affiliation, because this gave me access\nto databases like LexisNexis. If I hadn\u2019t, the cost of finding out what I\nwanted to find out would likely have run into the thousands of dollars.\n\nA problem beyond cost, though, is convenience. I find that even when I am\ndoing research through databases and my university library, it is often an\nabsolute mess: the sites are clunky and constantly demanding login\ncredentials. The amount of time wasted in figuring out how to obtain a piece\nof research material is a massive cost on top of the actual pricing. The\nfederal court document database, PACER, for instance, charges 10 cents a page\nfor access to records, which adds up quickly since legal research often\ninvolves looking through thousands of pages. They offer an exemption if you\nare a researcher or can\u2019t afford it, but to get the exemption you have to fill\nout a three page form and provide an explanation of both why you need each\ndocument and why you deserve the exemption. This is a waste of time that\ninhibits people\u2019s productivity and limits their access to knowledge.\n\nIn fact, to see just how much human potential is being squandered by having\nknowledge dispensed by the \u201cfree market,\u201d let us briefly picture what \u201ctotally\ndemocratic and accessible knowledge\u201d would look like. Let\u2019s imagine that\ninstead of having to use privatized research services like Google Scholar and\nEBSCO, there was a single public search database containing every newspaper\narticle, every magazine article, every academic journal article, every court\nrecord, every government document, every website, every piece of software,\nevery film, song, photograph, television show, and video clip, and every book\nin existence. The content of the Wayback Machine, all of the newspaper\narchives, Google Books, Getty Images, Project Gutenberg, Spotify, the Library\nof Congress, everything in WestLaw and Lexis, all of it, every piece of it\naccessible instantly in full, and with a search function designed to be as\nsimple as possible and allow you to quickly narrow down what you are looking\nfor. (e.g. \u201cGive me: all Massachusetts newspaper articles, books published in\nBoston, and government documents that mention William Lloyd Garrison and were\npublished from 1860 to 1865.\u201d) The true universal search, uncorrupted by paid\nadvertising. Within a second, you could bring up an entire PDF of any book.\nWithin two seconds, you could search the full contents of that book.\n\nLet us imagine just how much time would be saved in this informational utopia.\nDo I want minute 15 of the 1962 Czechoslovak film Man In Outer Space? Four\nseconds from my thought until it begins. Do I want page 17 of the Daily Mirror\nfrom 1985? Even less time. Every public Defense Department document concerning\nVietnam from the Eisenhower administration? Page 150 of Frank Capra\u2019s\nautobiography? Page 400 of an economics textbook from 1995? All in front of\nme, in full, in less than the length of time it takes to type this sentence.\nHow much faster would research be in such a situation? How much more could be\naccomplished if knowledge were not fragmented and in the possession of a\nthousand private gatekeepers?\n\nWhat\u2019s amazing is that the difficulty of creating this situation of \u201cfully\ndemocratized information\u201d is entirely economic rather than technological. What\nI describe with books is close to what Google Books and Amazon already have.\nBut of course, universal free access to full content horrifies publishers, so\nwe are prohibited from using these systems to their full potential. The\nproblem is ownership: nobody is allowed to build a giant free database of\neverything human beings have ever produced. Getty Images will sue the shit out\nof you if you take a historical picture from their archives and violate your\nlicensing agreement with them. Same with the Walt Disney Company if you create\na free rival to Disney+ with all of their movies. Sci-Hub was founded in\nKazakhstan because if you founded it here they would swiftly put you in\nfederal prison. (When you really think about what it means, copyright law is\nan unbelievably intensive restriction on freedom of speech, sharply\ndelineating the boundaries of what information can and cannot be shared with\nother people.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not just profiteering companies that will fight to the death to keep\ncontent safely locked up. The creators of content are horrified by piracy,\ntoo. As my colleagues Lyta Gold and Brianna Rennix write, writers, artists,\nand filmmakers can be justifiably concerned that unless ideas and writings and\nimages can be regarded as \u201cproperty,\u201d they will starve to death:\n\n> Is there a justifiable rationale for treating ideas\u2014and particularly\n> stories\u2014as a form of \u201cproperty\u201d? One obvious reason for doing so is to\n> ensure that writers and other creators don\u2019t starve to death: In our\n> present-day capitalist utopia, if a writer\u2019s output can be brazenly copied\n> and profited upon by others, they won\u2019t have any meaningful ability to make\n> a living off their work, especially if they\u2019re an independent creator\n> without any kind of institutional affiliation or preexisting wealth.\n\nLyta and Brianna point out that in the real world, this justification is often\nbullshit, because copyrights last well beyond the death of the person who\nactually made the thing. But it\u2019s a genuine worry, because there is no\n\u201cuniversal basic income\u201d for a writer to fall back on in this country if their\nworks are simply passed around from hand to hand without anybody paying for\nthem. I admit I bristle when I see people share PDFs of full issues of Current\nAffairs, because if this happened a lot, we could sell exactly 1 subscription\nand then the issue could just be copied indefinitely. Current Affairs would\ncollapse completely if everyone tried to get our content for free rather than\npaying for it. (This is why you should subscribe! Or donate! Independent media\nneeds your support!)\n\nAt the end of last year, I published a book on socialism, and at first some\nconservatives thought it funny to ask me \u201cif you\u2019re a socialist, can I have it\nfor free?\u201d They were quieted, though, when I pointed out that yes, they could\nindeed have it for free. All they needed to do was go to the local socialized\ninformation repository known as a public library, where they would be handed a\ncopy of the book without having to fork over a nickel. Anyone who wants to\nread my book but cannot or does not want to pay for it has an easy solution.\n\nI realized, though, as I was recommending everyone get my book from the\nlibrary rather than buying it in a bookstore, that my publisher probably\ndidn\u2019t appreciate my handing out this advice. And frankly, it made me a little\nnervous: I depend for my living on my writing, so if everyone got my book from\nthe library, it wouldn\u2019t sell any copies, and then my publisher wouldn\u2019t pay\nme to write any more books. We can\u2019t have too many people using the socialized\ninformation repository when authors are reliant on a capitalist publishing\nindustry! In fact, a strange thing about the library is that we intentionally\npreserve an unnecessary inefficiency in order to keep the current content\nfinancing model afloat. Your library could just give you DRM-free PDFs of my\nbook and every issue of Current Affairs for free, but instead they make you go\nto the magazine room or check out one of a limited number of copies of the\nbook, because while we want books and magazines to be free, we cannot have\nthem be as free as it is possible to make them, or it would hurt the\npublishing industry too much. (Libraries preserve the fiction that there are a\nselect number of \u201ccopies\u201d available of a digital book, even though this is\nludicrous, because abandoning the fiction would hurt publishers. They could\noffer every book ever written to anyone at any time. They just can\u2019t do it\nlegally.)\n\nI also realized, however, that I wouldn\u2019t care how many people got my book for\nfree if my compensation operated on a different structure, where I was paid by\nthe number of people who read it rather than the number of people who bought\nit. \u201cImpossible!\u201d you say. \u201cWhere would the money come from?\u201d We can imagine\nsuch a set-up quite easily, though. We have our universal public knowledge\ndatabase, and anyone who wants to can type in the title of any of my books and\nread them for free.** But the number of people who read the book is tracked,\nand I am compensated two dollars for every person who reads it (a pittance,\nbut that\u2019s about what authors get for their sales). Current Affairs, likewise,\nis granted a budget proportional to its readership. Compensated from where?\nBudget from where? Why, from the universal public knowledge database of\ncourse. But from where do they get their money? Why, from taxes.* Free at\npoint of use services are not some alien concept. The NHS compensates doctors\nwhile charging patients nothing. (Of course, compensation for producers\nwouldn\u2019t even be that much of an issue in a society with a Universal Basic\nIncome and where the basics of life were guaranteed. I wouldn\u2019t care about\nmaking any money on my books if I could live decently regardless.)\n\nNow, I am sure there will be those who argue that any universal knowledge\naccess system of this kind will inhibit the creation of new work by reducing\nthe rewards people get. But let us note a few facts: first, dead people cannot\nbe incentivized to be creative, thus at least everything ever created by a\nperson who is now dead should be made freely available to all. The gatekeepers\nto intellectual products made by the dead are parasites the equivalent of a\nprivate individual who sets up a gate and a tollbooth in the middle of a road\nsomebody else has already built and starts charging people if they want to\npass. Actually, since parasites latch onto the living, they are better\ncompared with corpse-eating worms.\n\nSecond, creators are already exploited: Spotify is very much like the\nuniversal searchable information database for music, it just operates for\nprofit rather than for artists, and rights-holders get a fraction of a cent\nper Spotify play, an amount that must itself split between the label, the\nproducer, the artist, and the songwriter. The CEO of Spotify has said that if\nartists want more money, they should make more music. (He is worth $4\nbillion.) And if you ever want to make a professor laugh, ask how much they\nmake from royalties on their published academic articles. As Adam Habib, Vice-\nChancellor for research at the University of Johannesburg explains, academic\npublishing is a \u201ccompletely feudal system\u201d:\n\n> \u201cThe costs of the research production are borne by the universities, and as\n> a result, by public monies, in most cases. Then, private companies publish\n> the research, and charge the universities and public institutions for the\n> very research outputs that they paid for. This is effectively the subsidy of\n> the private sector by public money. There is a myth that this is an example\n> of entrepreneurialism. In my view, all it does is facilitate enrichment at\n> public cost with huge consequences for those most disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nThis problem has not been fixed by the rise of \u201copen-access\u201d scholarship,\nbecause it hasn\u2019t removed the profit motive, so poor countries are still\ngetting screwed by the existing publishing model.\n\nThird, when considering the free information repository\u2019s effects on content\ncreation, you cannot look only at one side of the equation. The question of\nhow much productivity would be inhibited by the state declining to enforce the\ncopyrights of academic journal publishers and Getty Images must be weighed\nagainst the phenomenal unleashing of human productive power that universal\nfree access to all human knowledge would create. You must add up how much\nresearchers could do with the time that they now have to spend trying to track\ndown and access things. No more would a certain thing only be in a certain\nlibrary and accessible through an inter-library loan request. No more would\nlibrarians have to spend any time managing subscriptions rather than helping\nwith searches. Researchers in the developing world would no longer be utterly\nunable to compete with American libraries that can afford vast fees. (I can\ntell you, personally, that as someone who is constantly having to find obscure\nused books for research and then order them and wait sometimes weeks for them\nto arrive, I could produce far more quickly if I could see the full content of\nthe book in ten seconds, and I am constantly exasperated by Google Books\u2019\n\u201csnippet view.\u201d)\n\nFurthermore, we would have to consider what would happen in a society where\nthe relative accessibility and cost of truth versus lies was adjusted. What if\nevery online course was free? What if textbooks cost nothing instead of $200?\nWhat if we made it as easy and cheap as possible to find things out and were\nguided by the desire to create the greatest possible access to knowledge\nrather than by economic considerations? I do not know what would happen, but I\nhope some rogue state (or microstate or seastead) that doesn\u2019t mind pissing\noff the world\u2019s most powerful corporations and governments tries to storm the\nBastille of information and free every bit and byte from its artificial\nprison. The only thing stopping them is law, and what is law but a threat?\n\nThe good news about our times is that the possibilities for democratizing\nknowledge are greater than ever. We could not have started Current Affairs in\n1990 unless we had about ten times more money than what we actually had. Sharp\nleft YouTubers are fighting hard to combat propaganda and debunk bad\narguments, there are tons of great podcasts, and even Twitter has its uses.\n(Where else do you get to yell at powerful and influential people and\npersonally tick them off?) But it is still true that Fox News and PragerU and\nthe American Enterprise Institute have a hell of a lot of money to blast out\ntheir message as widely as possible. There is nothing on the left of remotely\ncomparable size and influence.\n\nBut we are working on it. We are a long way from the world in which all\nknowledge is equally accessible. Hopefully someday our patchwork of\nintentionally-inefficient libraries will turn into a free storehouse of\nhumanity\u2019s recorded knowledge and creativity. In the meantime, however, we\nneed to focus on getting good and thoughtful material in as many hands as\npossible and breaking down the barriers we can. At Current Affairs we have no\npaywall, even though this might cost us some money, because we are trying to\nmake it as easy as possible to hear what we have to say. This is what the\nright does. They tell people what to think, offer them books and pamphlets and\nhandy five-minute YouTube videos. On the left we are not nearly as slick.\n\nWe can\u2019t afford to keep our reach to those who like us so much that they are\nwilling to pay money to listen, because then the free bullshit wins. It\u2019s hard\nfor small media institutions to figure out the right balance of depending on\nads, paywalls, and donations. The money has to come from somewhere, after all.\nA lot of the times, that means a heavy dependence on ads\u2014the traditional model\nof magazines has been ad-revenue based, not subscription-based\u2014so that\npaywalls are actually the less corrupted model; a podcaster who sells their\nproduct on Patreon rather than giving it away but filling it with mattress and\n\u201cbox-of-shit-a-month\u201d ads has an important kind of freedom: they only have to\nplease the audience, not the sponsors. At Current Affairs, we sell\nsubscriptions to keep the lights on, but even one person who could have read\nan article and doesn\u2019t is a loss. (I wish I could give my book to everyone too\nbut my publisher won\u2019t let me. I did make another one free, though.) The\nGuardian and the Intercept provide a lot of valuable material to the public\nfor free because they don\u2019t have paywalls, but the Guardian is funded by a\ntrust and the Intercept by a benevolent billionaire. (Such funding sources\nmake things much easier. Attention benevolent billionaires: we have a donate\npage.) Perhaps paywalls can help publications like the New York Times and the\nNew Statesman from having to partner with \u201cbranded content\u201d suppliers like\nShell Oil and Cigna, but at the expense of limiting reach. More reason to have\npublications funded by the centralized free-information library rather than\nthrough subscriptions or corporate sponsorship.\n\nCreators must be compensated well. But at the same time we have to try to keep\nthings that are important and profound from getting locked away where few\npeople will see them. The truth needs to be free and universal.\n\n* I will not be reading angry emails from Modern Monetary Theorists. I am assuming a country without a sovereign currency, so there.\n\n** You could, of course\u2014and I am sure many people would want to\u2014offer the\nuniversal database with a paywall and something like an \u201callowance\u201d each month\n(e.g. 5 books, 100 newspaper/magazine articles, 50 scholarly journal articles,\n20 films, and as many court records as they like) above which there would be a\ncost, and waive that cost for anyone below a certain income level. But this\nwould involve means-testing, which makes everything needlessly complicated and\ninevitably means that some people will not access things who otherwise would.\nWe do not means-test the public library and we should not means-test the\nuniversal public knowledge database.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider subscribing to our magnificent\nprint edition or making a donation.
