A multi-account strategy allows you to segregate environments,\nstreamline cost tracking, and maintain \"throwaway\" accounts for low-risk\ntesting. The benefits of using multiple accounts, even for personal projects,\nare well-known among the AWS community, and I was curious to see how others\nimplement their personal setups.\n\nWhile there are benefits to multi-account setups, they can also make\nmanagement more complex. At my workplace, we use AWS Organizations and AWS\nControl Tower to manage numerous accounts across a large organization with\ndedicated security, DevOps, and platform teams to support it. While lacking\nthe resources of a large organization, I still wanted to switch from storing\nmy resources in a single account to multiple accounts. I turned to X (Twitter)\nto gather insights from the wider community. In this post, I'll share some of\nthe recommendations I received.\n\n> If you use AWS for personal projects, do you leverage AWS Organizations and\n> Control Tower and have different accounts for specific purposes, or do you\n> run everything in one account? I have been running everything in one account\n> until now, but having accounts for specific purposes...\n>\n> \u2014 Chris Ebert (@realchrisebert) April 5, 2024\n\n### AWS Organizations\n\nAWS Organizations is a free service designed to help with account management.\nIt consolidates various AWS accounts under a single management account,\nfacilitating centralized billing, compliance, and security management. AWS\nOrganizations is the best way to start if you want multiple AWS accounts.\nAnother perk of Organizations is that each account gets its own AWS free tier,\nwhich could help lower your AWS spend.\n\nFor detailed guidance on setting up and configuring AWS Organizations, please\nrefer to the official AWS Organizations documentation. Once you have an AWS\nOrganization configured, you'll need to choose an account creation and\nmanagement approach that best suits your needs.\n\n### AWS Control Tower\n\nAWS Control Tower works in conjunction with AWS Organizations to streamline\nthe setup and governance of multiple organizational accounts. Leveraging\nControl Tower is widely regarded as a best practice for enterprises,\nparticularly in highly regulated industries, due to its detailed governance\nfeatures. However, for personal use, the complexities and potential costs\nassociated with AWS Control Tower might outweigh its benefits.\n\nTeri Radichel, a Cyber Security Architect and AWS Security Hero, provides\nvaluable insights on setting up AWS Control Tower and AWS Organizations\nsecurely in her blog posts, which can be found here. While her insights and\nguidelines are great for larger organizations, the complexities involved may\nnot be required for smaller non-production environments. Teri's extensive work\nconvinced me that I am not up for this complexity when managing my personal\naccounts.\n\n### Control Tower Alternatives\n\nWhen I sought input from others on this topic online, Danny Santiago mentioned\nan open-source project he started called Telophase. Telophase is described as\nan \"Open Source Control Tower.\" This tool facilitates importing, creating, and\ndeleting AWS organization accounts using code. I have limited experience with\nthis tool, but I downloaded it and could import my AWS organization accounts,\ncreate new accounts, and delete existing accounts. I have yet to use any\nadvanced features, such as assigning IaC blueprints to accounts. Read the Get\nStarted with Telophase documentation if this project interests you. To use\nTelophase, you'll need a basic understanding of Go package management and\nTerraform. With enough community support, this OSS project proposes eventually\nbuilding a web management interface to facilitate even easier account\nmanagement, making this project even more interesting. I plan on using\nTelophase to create \"burner\" AWS test accounts that I can easily destroy\nlater.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter reviewing guidance from various sources, I've determined that AWS\nControl Tower's complexity does not justify its use for my personal needs. My\nneeds only require managing a few accounts, focusing primarily on serverless\nservices with restricted privileges. I've prioritized setting up two-factor\nauthentication 2FA, AWS SSO, billing alarms, and limiting the use of the AWS\nroot account. This approach keeps my setup simple and focused on learning and\nprototyping with AWS services without the overhead of more complex\nconfigurations.\n\nIf you have additional thoughts or suggestions on this topic, feel free to add\na comment or start your own conversation or blog.\n\n## Navigating 2024 email requirements\n\nStarting in February 2024, Gmail and Yahoo Mail set the stage for a\nsignificant shift in email communication standards by enforcing new\nrequirements for bulk email senders.
