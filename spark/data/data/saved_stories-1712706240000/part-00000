In a world of LEDs, Western Neon illuminates this Seattle legacy for\nthe next generation.\n\nBy Benjamin Cassidy March 2, 2020 Published in the March 2020 issue of Seattle\nMet\n\nOn slick nights, a warm-white gloss envelops the intersection of East Union\nStreet and 23rd Avenue. As chelsea rain boots thump toward nearby luxury\napartments and buses barrel past, the reflection endures on the asphalt,\ndefying the bustle on this gentrifying Central District block. The light\u2019s\nsource isn\u2019t distinct from the neighborhood\u2019s transformation. Outlined in\nfaintly yellow neon tubing, identical signs that spell \u201cUncle Ike\u2019s\u201d have\nbeamed from adjacent sides of this corner storefront for only a handful of\nyears. But across a black facade, these three-foot cursive letters summon a\nbygone era, one when mom-and-pops could shine alongside the big boys. The\nargon-and-mercury script evokes a double-stroked signature that says, You can\ntrust me. I\u2019m family. In the shadow of apartment buildings guarded by keycards\nand punch codes, the message is stark in its invitation.\n\nThe twin signs also scream cannabis to locals. Ian \u201cUncle Ike\u201d Eisenberg\nstarted his line of pot shops on this turf back in 2014. Uncle Ike\u2019s was the\nsecond weed retailer to open in Seattle, a city by no means allergic to ganj\nbut, in those days, still fighting through its first hit of the drug\u2019s\nlegalization. \u201cPot back then really had a stigma around it,\u201d Eisenberg recalls\nof his store\u2019s infancy, \u201cand I thought something that blended in with the\nnostalgic fabric of the city might be more accepted by people that looked down\non cannabis.\u201d\n\nTo help mellow the traditionalists, Eisenberg turned to a scientific marvel\nthat has illuminated some of Seattle\u2019s most celebrated industries over the\nlast century: neon signage. Conjured by electrifying noble gases trapped in\nglass tubing, neon lighting has long provided the city\u2019s businesses with\nvibrant visuals. To craft his glowing letters, Eisenberg hired Western Neon, a\nSeattle firm largely responsible for neon\u2019s continued presence here, well\nafter technologies like LED have spurred its obsolescence elsewhere. For more\nthan 35 years, Western Neon has fashioned signs for Seattle brands both hip\nand historic, from Filson to Pick-Quick Drive In to Fremont Brewing.\n\nSeattleites, then, encounter Western Neon\u2019s work during commutes, shopping\nsprees, binges. Our rapidly scaling tech firms may not proclaim their names in\nneon a la Pike Place Market vendors, but many of the new spots where their\nhead counts play certainly do. Coders grab lunch at the Deck, the South Lake\nUnion food court distinguished by a lighted arrow. They find fizzy refreshment\nbelow the neon bottle of Rachel\u2019s Ginger Beer deep in Amazonia. They rest\ntheir heads at night in apartment complexes like Ava on Capitol Hill, where a\nradiant wrench hangs above a swanky common area. And, yes, they pick up Candy\nKush beneath the sheen of Uncle Ike\u2019s.\n\nWhile its portfolio touts a bevy of businesses on the come up, Western Neon is\nalso known for its restoration jobs. The company spent more than 500 hours\nrefurbishing the beloved 7,500-pound, 16-foot Wonder Bread sign that stood\natop its namesake\u2019s Central District factory since 1952. When a 248-unit\ndevelopment replaced baking operations, the new owner paid to return the red\nneon sign to the building\u2019s roof, appeasing grumbling neighbors. Most\nfamously, the company re-created the Rainier \u201cR\u201d that overlooked I-5 from the\ntop of the old Rainier Brewery for almost 50 years before its 2000\ntakedown\u2014another project that fuses the city\u2019s past and present.\n\n\u201cNeon is this medium that has this ability to be both nostalgic and futuristic\nat the same time,\u201d says Dylan Neuwirth. Western Neon\u2019s creative director, a\nGeorgia native with a Southern manner and a fondness for flat-brim hats,\nbelongs to the medium\u2019s new school, a wave of innovators who marry neon\u2019s\nartistic exploration to modern sign making and, in turn, keep it viable in the\ntwenty-first century.\n\nViable doesn\u2019t necessarily mean practical. Rachel\u2019s Ginger Beer founder Rachel\nMarshall says her company\u2019s neon signage adds \u201cwarmth to your storefront that\na more traditional sign wouldn\u2019t,\u201d but the lighting at her newest bar in South\nLake Union ran her about $30,000. That\u2019s before the inevitable maintenance; a\ncrack in the glass or a transformer snafu can leave you one glaring letter\nshort. (Inadvertent profanity lurks, especially if your business has the word\nglass in its name.)\n\nYet, unlike in many cities around the country, neon\u2019s shortcomings haven\u2019t\ncurtailed its popularity in Seattle. It isn\u2019t as prevalent today as it was\nduring the early- and mid-twentieth century, sure, but Western Neon\u2019s ubiquity\nsignals that contemporary business owners like Marshall and Eisenberg know now\nwhat business owners in old Seattle knew then: In this city, neon legitimizes.\n\nWestern Neon creative director Dylan Neuwirth belongs to neon\u2019s new school.\n\nImage: Mike Kane\n\nLovers adult store is going through a rebrand, Neuwirth explains. Western\nNeon\u2019s creative director stands across a workshop table from Will Kirtley, a\nkinetic glass bender in Saturday dad wear who eyes an illustration of the\nWashington-based company\u2019s new sign prototype: a looping purple-and-pink \u201cL\u201d.\nIn a bright basement room of the company\u2019s SoDo space, alongside staffers who\ngas-inject, seal, and temperature-check tubes, Kirtley clutches a torch in one\nhand and draws its heat to where two glass pieces meet. As he waits for them\nto join, he keeps a mouthpiece tucked between his lips, blowing ever-so-softly\nthrough a cylinder to prevent the glass pieces before him from collapsing\ninward. The job requires some tricky maneuvers, like bending the tubes to hook\nlike switchbacks on a mountain. But after more than 30 years of this work,\nKirtley is adept enough at the techniques to teach them.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way. In the late 1980s, Kirtley convinced his\ngrandmother that dropping out of DeVry University in Chicago to attend the\nNorthern Wisconsin Neon Workshop was a sound investment. Back then, Dean\nBlazek\u2019s six-week session in Antigo, Wisconsin, a farming town 90 minutes\noutside Green Bay, was one of the country\u2019s only programs. A week into\nBlazek\u2019s rigorous school, Kirtley was still struggling to make the difficult\nbut oft-requested double-back bend. His instructor, a pragmatist about as\ncuddly as Walter Matthau, called him and a couple others into his office,\ninforming them that they weren\u2019t cut out for the work and that he would refund\ntheir tuition. Kirtley cried that night. The next day, though, he returned\nresolute. I\u2019m not giving up on this, he told Blazek, who then urged him to\nstay. The teacher had just been testing him, instilling persistence. Later on,\nin Washington, as Kirtley bounced around different shops and worked out of his\ngarage, he would need it.\n\nBut Kirtley would always have Blazek\u2019s name to drop. That\u2019s how he landed a\ngig here in the Northwest, at a company helmed by his instructor\u2019s sons.\nMichael Blazek founded Western Neon in 1984, uprooting from Wisconsin to\nWashington to open the shop, initially located in Kirkland. Around 1990, his\nbrother Jay took over, expanded the company\u2019s client list, and added more\ntypes of signage. Both sons had been students of their father\u2019s, learning the\ntrade in a large warehouse surrounded by cornfields. The Wisconsin Sign\nAssociation had nudged Dean to start the program in the late 1970s, according\nto Michael, because most benders were nearing retirement age. By then the\nmedium had been around for the better part of a century.\n\nElectrified noble gases generate vibrant colors.\n\nImage: Mike Kane\n\nEarly in June of 1898 two British scientists hunkered down in a lab at\nLondon\u2019s University College, rushing to fill in the final empty spots of the\nperiodic table. A week earlier, one of these men, Sir William Ramsay, had\nisolated krypton, which belongs to a group of colorless, odorless, tasteless,\nand mostly inert elements; today, we call them the noble gases. Presumably\nstill feeling flush with discovery, the men experimented further with air\nliquefaction that afternoon until they unearthed neon. (The name stems from\nthe Greek word for new.) Along with its noble brethren\u2014argon, helium, krypton,\nand xenon\u2014the gas became a source of neon lighting.\n\nFrench engineer Georges Claude began sealing the gases in electrified tubing\nduring the early 1900s. His neon lighting migrated from Europe to the U.S. en\nmasse when a Packard car dealership in Los Angeles purchased two neon signs\nfrom Claude\u2019s company in the mid-1920s. In 1927 Electrical Products\nCorporation of Washington formed. With its gray weather and robust port\neconomy, Seattle quickly became a hub for \u201cletters of fire,\u201d as the Seattle\nSunday Times called neon lighting. Local businesses trumpeted the city\u2019s\nmodernity through enormous gas-in-glass signage. In 1930 the Port Commission\nerected a 320-foot \u201cPort of Seattle\u201d neon sign on top of the Bell Street\nTerminal, beckoning sailors just as the Uncle Ike\u2019s script draws cannabis\nconnoisseurs today. \u201cWe were perfectly situated as a neon city,\u201d says Leonard\nGarfield, the executive director of the Museum of History and Industry, which\nhouses the original neon Rainier \u201cR\u201d.\n\nYet, as the twentieth century waned, a phenomenon once considered reputable\nbecame viewed by many Americans as garish and inconvenient. LEDs, with their\nlong-lasting, energy-efficient glow, and other forms of lighting provided\nbusinesses with cheaper alternatives to handmade neon signs that demanded\nmaintenance. The gas\u2019s continued prominence in Las Vegas\u2014Sin City\u2014didn\u2019t help\nneon shed its ties to night vices, either. A 1961 Seattle Sunday Times article\nadvances this damning noir, noting that the war on crime transpired in \u201cthe\nneon glare of night spots, dark alleys and shabby hotel rooms.\u201d\n\nBy the 1970s, neon signs had undoubtedly declined in Seattle. But they hadn\u2019t\ngone completely dark.\n\nA basement workshop, aka neon tubing\u2019s womb. Will Kirtley bends and welds\nglass. Glasses on.\n\nImage: Mike Kane\n\nMichael Blazek wasn\u2019t sure his Chevy pickup\u2019s suspension would survive the\nRockies. He had just bought the truck to head west from Wisconsin to\nWashington. He planned to open a neon sign shop once he arrived, but an\nattached camper full of equipment\u2014the ribbon burners, the torches, the\nbombarder transformer, the boxes of glass\u2014was seriously weighing down those\nnew wheels.\n\nBy September of 1984, when Michael\u2019s father helped him load up his equipment\nfor the cross-country drive, neon had experienced a bit of a revival. Artist\nRudi Stern\u2019s 1979 book, Let There Be Neon, reminded the world of the gas\u2019s\nartistic potential. A college dropout in search of a trade, Michael took one\nof his father\u2019s first classes around that time. Later on, a fellow student\nenticed Michael to venture to Seattle. The city had continued to cherish its\niconic midcentury neon\u2014the pink Elephant Car Wash sign, the Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer globe, and Pike Place Market\u2019s array of radiant advertisements\noutside its shops.\n\nWhen Michael arrived, Chevy intact, he was mostly subcontracting for other\nsign companies in Washington. Boosted by interest in Dale Chihuly, the state\u2019s\ngrowing glass-art movement also helped sustain Western Neon\u2014and\nMichael\u2014financially and creatively.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Michael showed work at a host of galleries in Seattle and\nelsewhere.\n\nWestern Neon was still a small business when its founder departed Seattle in\n1990. After one particularly persuasive vacation in Australia, Michael decided\nto follow a colleague to Brisbane to help run a sign company there. He left\nWestern Neon to his brother and former apprentice, Jay, a runner who never\nfinished college. \u201cMy brother kind of took a gamble on me,\u201d Jay says today.\n\nIt paid off. Over the next two-plus decades, Jay Blazek turned Western Neon\ninto a fixture of Seattle\u2019s commercial sign industry. (\u201cHe transformed the\nbusiness,\u201d is how Michael puts it.) Jay\u2019s Western Neon made a range of\ndifferent signs for customers, including LEDs. \u201cNinety-eight percent of the\nneon on the planet has disappeared in the last 15 years due to LEDs, largely,\u201d\nJay says. \u201cI could see the writing on the wall.\u201d\n\nHe also knew how to seize the spotlight.\n\nA replica Rainier \u201cR\u201d replaced the Tully\u2019s \u201cT\u201d in 2013.

The iconic neon\nred Rainier \u201cR\u201d had stood atop the building for nearly half a century, but\nTully\u2019s Coffee, now operating a roastery in the structure, had hired Western\nNeon to replace the landmark with a neon green \u201cT,\u201d marking a new beverage\u2019s\nreign in the city.\n\nThe spectacle almost didn\u2019t happen. Jay Blazek had told Tully\u2019s a sign of that\nmagnitude required six to eight weeks of work. Three weeks before Independence\nDay, he got a call saying the installation would need to happen on the\nholiday\u2014and it would be broadcast on the 10 o\u2019clock news. Jay protested the\ntight deadline, but to no avail.\n\nOn the morning of arguably the most important day of his budding company\u2019s\nhistory, the owner was bending and replacing the piece\u2019s final tubes, hoping\nhe would have everything done in time. Ultimately, the unseating went off\nsmoothly. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do a swan dive off the tower,\u201d Jay quips now.\nWhile the televised event afforded Western Neon unprecedented publicity and a\nstream of new business, it was also a shining moment for neon itself. Michael\nBlazek could see that, even from thousands of miles away. \u201cThey knew if they\nput a big \u2018T\u2019 up there and lit it up on both sides,\u201d he says of Tully\u2019s,\n\u201ceveryone in Seattle would know they\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nThe eventual removal of the \u201cT\u201d also felt like a civic milestone. In 2013,\nTully\u2019s (chaired by none other than ex-Stormy Daniels attorney Michael\nAvenatti, who\u2019s been in a litany of legal trouble himself) called upon Western\nNeon once again. The owners announced the company would swap in a replica of\nthe Rainier \u201cR\u201d to honor the city\u2019s history. By then, though, Jay Blazek was\nin New Zealand. He had burned \u201cevery possible calorie of energy\u201d on the\nbusiness and needed a life change and followed his brother to the Southern\nHemisphere. But Jay wasn\u2019t going to sell the company to just anybody. At a\nconvention, he remembers, Rudi Stern once called the Blazeks \u201cthe first family\nof neon\u201d\u2014Jay had a reputation to uphold. He handpicked Andr\u00e9 Lucero, who swept\nfloors as an apprentice before working his way up to a managerial position, as\nhis successor. The new head of Western Neon also had other strengths\u2014in\nparticular, social media skills\u2014that Jay lacked.\n\nUnder Lucero, the roughly 25-employee business broadened an already impressive\nrange of clientele. Nonprofit and public sector projects now supplement its\nwork with businesses. On the afternoon Will Kirtley was bending the Lovers\nprototype, staffers upstairs were assembling a Seattle Children\u2019s Research\nInstitute sign that read \u201cStopping Disease.\u201d When light rail arrives in North\nSeattle next year, a re-creation of the giant Standard Radio sign will once\nagain shine on the site of the new Roosevelt Station. And an upcoming public\nart project in Renton will demonstrate the company\u2019s capabilities beyond neon,\ncapturing the city\u2019s industrial history in multiple forms.\n\nStill, neon courses through the company\u2019s veins, and cultivating an interest\nin the medium is at its heart. In 2017, Neuwirth, Lucero, and technical\ndirector Kelsey Fernkopf started a nonprofit that offers introductory and\nintermediate classes in bending and illuminating glass. At the Western Neon\nSchool of Art, students can practice some of the same techniques that Will\nKirtley struggled to grasp at Dean Blazek\u2019s workshop all those years ago. The\nprograms at the Seattle firm\u2019s headquarters aren\u2019t supposed to spit out\nKirtleys, mind you. \u201cWe\u2019re not training sign makers here,\u201d Neuwirth says.\nStudents learn the bending basics, sure, but their focus is on \u201cart that\nworks,\u201d as a sign above the school\u2019s eight workstations says. They examine the\nintersections of light, space, and technology, the mix that makes neon\ntimeless to enthusiasts, including a budding pot emperor.\n\nTwo Seattle institutions: The Ivar\u2019s sign inspired the one at Uncle Ike\u2019s, the\nsecond weed retailer to open in the city.\n\nImage: Mike Kane\n\nLong before he owned Uncle Ike\u2019s, Ian Eisenberg appreciated neon signs as a\nmeeting of art and science, the sculpture of the glass tubing\u2019s fabrication\ncoupled with the infusion of gas inside. The neon at Ivar\u2019s Acres of Clams\ndrew plenty of his admiration. Growing up in Madrona, Eisenberg, like everyone\nelse in the city, knew the seafood restaurant, which meant he knew of Ivar\nHaglund. The \u201cKing of the Waterfront\u201d opened Seattle\u2019s first aquarium on Pier\n54 in 1938, shamelessly promoting his undertaking by, among other stunts,\npushing a seal through Pike Place Market en route to a Santa photo op and\narranging a wrestling match between an octopus and a prizefighter. In 1946 he\nopened Ivar\u2019s Acres of Clams, a formal realization of a fleeting fish-and-\nchips business he had launched to accompany the aquarium. Ivar\u2019s was a hit in\nno small part due to the proprietor\u2019s sense of humor. Foremost among Haglund\u2019s\npromotional puns was \u201ckeep clam,\u201d an eye-roller or knee-slapper depending on\nyour taste but, like it or not, one that persists today in local parlance.\n\nEisenberg admired how Haglund\u2019s personality and his business were inextricably\ntied to one another, and his nascent cannabis empire\u2019s marketing tactics bear\nsome resemblance to Haglund\u2019s not-so-subtle quips. (The phone number for Uncle\nIke\u2019s is 1-800-GET-DRUGS.) With his business\u2019s glowing script, Eisenberg also\nwanted to mirror Haglund, whose cursive Ivar\u2019s signage represented the neon\naesthetic of waterfront businesses of that time. The two signatures aren\u2019t\nidentical\u2014the \u201cI\u201d in Uncle Ike\u2019s lacks the Ivar\u2019s flourish\u2014but they both\nconvey the same ownership, the same warmth. It\u2019s a measurable quality. Upon\nfinishing his first work on Uncle Ike\u2019s signage, Will Kirtley recalls fixating\non its color: an almost-yellow white measuring 3,000 kelvin on the color-\ntemperature spectrum, about as warm as it gets. \u201cIt is a very unusual white,\u201d\nhe says.\n\nThat warmth can spread. On a recent trip back to Seattle from Australia,\nMichael Blazek walked around Pioneer Square and other neighborhoods. Along the\nway, the Western Neon founder snapped photographs of neon signs shining\nthroughout the city he left decades ago. Though Seattle\u2019s dark skies lend\nthemselves to this time-tested medium, the city\u2019s climate has a less obvious\nbenefit: wetness. Soaked streets and sidewalks reflect the light. It spreads\nacross surfaces, businesses, and neighborhoods, new and old, coating\ncobblestones and concrete in orange or pink or emerald, defeating the city\u2019s\ngloom.\n\nFiled under\n\nHistory, Uncle Ike\u2019s\n\nShare\n\nShow Comments\n\n# Related Content\n\nHaunted History\n\n# The Toxic Legacy of Seattle\u2019s Lost Cemetery\n\n10/26/2023 By Ashli Blow\n\nAsked/Answered\n\n# Why Is It Called Capitol Hill?\n\n09/18/2023 By Seattle Met Staff\n\nFaking Left\n\n# Shaun Scott Chronicles Seattle\u2019s Civic Shortcomings through Sports\n\n10/23/2023 By Benjamin Cassidy\n\nRECORD KEEPING\n\n# The Most Memorable Snowstorms in Seattle History\n\n03/01/2023 By Zoe Sayler\n\n1416 NW 46th Street, Suite 105, PMB 136 Seattle, WA 98107 Phone: 206-957-2234\n\u2022 Fax: 206-447-3388\n\n\u00a9 2024 SagaCity Media\n\n## Will you support local journalism in 2024?\n\nEach day we share incredible stories about this amazing place we call home \u2014\nall at no cost.
