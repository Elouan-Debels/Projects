In fact, my country may have a bit\nof a brain drain problem. Talents are leaving.\n\n##\n\nThe white flag is a red flag\n\nYou see, if you are an employee, assuming you can tolerate the void in your\nsoul caused by the absence of decent cheese in America, and even after paying\nfor health care out of your pocket, the money is still better. Much better.\n\nIf you are a founder, French investors don't want to fight much, they are very\nrisk averse. This means your original projects will get canned more often,\nfunding is going to be super hard, and will bring less money if you succeed.\n\nI still remember when I was 20 something, some friends and I presented a word-\nof-mouth-based social network in a contest. The PoC was based on a concept of\nsocial proximity: if you needed a nanny or wanted to sell your house, you\ncould only propagate the info to people in your close circle, that would do so\nthemself, and so on. Propagation and curation all in one.\n\nWe won second place. A VC came to us, gave us his card and said: \"Once you are\nmaking money, call me\".\n\nThat's... not how a funding seed works, mate.\n\nSo you bootstrap, of course. But the French-speaking market is much smaller\nthan the English speaking one. I had a French blog before, and it took 10\nyears to reach the audience that this one got in 10 months. Simple maths.\n\nAlso it's hard to innovate.\n\nIndeed, customers and workers protection is high. Laws are everywhere. As the\ncitizen, this is often a net positive. Everybody hate on cookie banners, but I\nlike I can force FANNGS to delete my accounts, and let me download my stuff. I\nlove that spending a week in the hospital last year didn't register on my\nbudget. And I'm glad that people in the gig economy has to get decent social\nsafety net.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that Uber or AirBnB could never have been born\nin France. Whether you think it's a good or a bad thing, it's the elephant in\nthe room.\n\n##\n\nLuck meets opportunity\n\nEven without all those factors, there is the cruel reality of the network\neffect. If you live in the US, you'll be exposed to more possibilities, more\nskilled people, more interesting projects. Not to mention the energy, the\natmosphere that the American manage to bring up that you can't quite find\nanywhere else. Plus those guys are so good at selling. We could have a\nmountain of gold, they would manage to compete with us with shiny plastic\nreplicates, branded as lighter, shinier, and gluten free.\n\nFinally, the administration is heavy. You get used to it, I'm exceptionally\ngood at dealing with it compared to some of my international colleagues that\nseem to die when given the slightest report to write. But for universities?\nIt's a nightmare. I have a physicist friend, he spend so much time on things\nthat have nothing to do with the lasers he loves so much. Add on to this that\nthey are under paid, and that private/public partnerships are hard to setup.\nIt's a miracle we still have motivated PhD finding stuff out.\n\nAll those things mean the US is professionally highly attractive, while\nactively trying to get talents with the resource to pay for it and the\ninsistence of their market pressure.\n\nPersonally I chose the middle ground. I work on the cool gigs abroad, and I\ngive a piece of the pie to the French state so that I can enjoy the local\nlifestyle. It's a win-win. My carbon footprint sucks, though.\n\nTalking about carbon footprint, I'm going to Africa for a week or two, so the\nnext pytest article is going to be delayed a little.\n\n### Subscribe to Bite code!\n\nBy Bite Code! \u00b7 Launched a year ago\n\nNobody has time for Python\n\n3 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### French competitiveness in IT\n\nwww.bitecode.dev\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nXML is the future\n\nOkay, campers, rise and shine...\n\nJun 24, 2023\n\n116\n\nShare this post\n\n#### XML is the future\n\nwww.bitecode.dev\n\n22\n\nWhat's up, Python?
