Models assembled in India include the iPhone\n12 through to the latest iPhone 15, excluding premium Pro and Pro Max models.\n\nApple has been setting up iPhone manufacturing hubs in India ever since Prime\nMinister Narendra Modi began promoting his \"Made in India\" initiative, which\nrequires that 30% of products sold by foreign companies be manufactured or\nproduced within the country.\n\nThe Indian government says the growth in manufacturing has created 150,000\ndirect jobs at Apple's suppliers. That's a boon for Modi's administration,\nwhich has enticed foreign companies like Apple with financial incentives to\nrealize its ambition for the country to become a global manufacturing hub.\n\nFoxconn assembled nearly 67% and Pegatron around 17% of iPhones in India in\nthe fiscal year ending March 2024, according to Bloomberg's sources. The\nremaining devices were produced by Wistron.\n\nWhile China remains Apple's largest iPhone assembly base and biggest overseas\nmarket, it is also where Apple's revenues have been plummeting, due to the\nmeteoric rise of local vendors such as Huawei and a government ban on the use\nof iPhones in state workplaces.\n\nApple's diversification away from China hints at the company's growing\nawareness of rising geopolitical tensions and the need for supply chain\nresilience in the face of potential disruption. The pivot to India also likely\ntakes into account its fast-growing smartphone market \u2013 last year Apple also\nopened its first two stores there, in Mumbai and the capital New Delhi.\n\nTags: Bloomberg, China, India\n\n[ 10 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nklasma\n\n24 minutes ago at 05:51 am\n\n> How about assemble in US or Europe?\n\nThat would probably push pricing into the Vision Pro region.\n\nScore: 4 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\ntomtad\n\n21 minutes ago at 05:55 am\n\n> That would probably push pricing into the Vision Pro region.\n\nCould be an interesting experiment.
