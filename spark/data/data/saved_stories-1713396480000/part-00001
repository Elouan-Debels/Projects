BloomTech provides short-term, six- to nine-month\ntraining programs in areas such as web development, data science, and backend\nengineering. To finance its substantial $20,000 tuition, until 2024, BloomTech\noffered students income share agreements. Under the agreements, students could\nattend BloomTech if they agreed to pay the school a percentage of their\nmonthly income from a qualifying job with an income of at least $50,000 after\nthey graduate. Nearly all BloomTech\u2019s students funded their enrollment in its\nprograms with such agreements. The Bureau found that BloomTech and Allred made\nfalse representations about the income share agreements and the benefits\nstudents would receive if they entered them, including that the agreements\nwere not loans and carried no finance charge, that the school\u2019s interests were\naligned with its students\u2019 interests because the school got paid only when\nstudents got a high-enough paying job, and that the school had high job-\nplacement rates and a top-notch curriculum and instructors. The Bureau found\nthat BloomTech and Allred violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of\n2010\u2019s prohibition of deceptive and abusive acts or practices with its\ndeceptive statements and by taking unreasonable advantage of consumers\u2019\nreasonable reliance on BloomTech to act in their interests. The Bureau also\nfound that BloomTech violated the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing\nregulation, Regulation Z, by failing to disclose key facts about its financing\nagreements, such as the amount financed, finance charge, and annual percentage\nrate; and that BloomTech violated the Holder Rule by failing to include a\nprovision in its financing agreements making any holder of the agreement\nsubject to the legal claims that students could assert against BloomTech. The\nBureau\u2019s order permanently bans BloomTech from all consumer-lending activities\nand bans Allred from any student-lending activities for ten years. It also\nrescinds income share agreements for graduates who have not had a qualifying\njob in the past year; reforms income share agreements to eliminate the finance\ncharge for consumers who graduated the program more than 18 months ago and\nobtained a qualifying job making $70,000 or less; and gives current students\nthe option to withdraw from the program and cancel their income share\nagreement or continue in the program with a third-party loan or lawful income\nshare agreement. The order also requires that BloomTech and Allred pay civil\nmoney penalties of $64,235 and $100,000, respectively.\n\n##### Related documents\n\nConsent Order\n\nStipulation\n\n##### Press release\n\nCFPB Takes Action Against Coding Boot Camp BloomTech and CEO Austen Allred for\nDeceiving Students and Hiding Loan Costs\n\n##### Case Docket\n\nView case filings\n\n## Action Details\n\n### Forum\n\n  * Administrative Proceeding\n\n### Docket number\n\n2024-CFPB-0001\n\n### Initial filing date\n\nAPR 17, 2024\n\n### Status\n\nPost Order/Post Judgment\n\nSee status definitions\n\n### Products\n\n  * Student Loan Origination\n\n## Further reading\n\n### Blog\n\n  * ### Servicemembers continue to face major financial challenges\n\nNOV 01, 2023\n\n### Newsroom\n\n  * ### CFPB Takes Action Against Coding Boot Camp BloomTech and CEO Austen Allred for Deceiving Students and Hiding Loan Costs\n\nAPR 17, 2024\n\nView more\n\nBack to top\n\n  * About Us\n  * Contact Us\n  * Careers\n  * Events\n  * Industry Whistleblowers\n  * CFPB Ombudsman\n\n  * FOIA\n  * Privacy\n  * Website Privacy Policy & Legal Notices\n  * Data\n  * Open Government\n  * Information Quality Guidelines\n\n  * Diversity & Inclusion\n  * Administrative Adjudication\n  * Plain Writing\n  * Accessibility\n  * Office of Civil Rights\n  * No FEAR Act & Cummings Act\n  * Tribal\n\n  * USA.gov\n  * Office of Inspector General\n\nAn official website of the United States government\n\n", "frontpage": false}
