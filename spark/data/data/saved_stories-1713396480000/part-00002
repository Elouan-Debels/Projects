Tourists flock to the city\u2019s ancient temple to feed the macaques\nfresh fruit and photograph them as they maraud the streets. But, increasingly,\nresidents say they have had enough.\n\nThis week, after growing complaints from residents, wildlife officials\nannounced a plan to round up 2,500 of the urban monkeys and place them in\nlarge enclosures. It follows an incident in March where a woman\u2019s knee\nwasdislocated after she was kicked in the back by a monkey that wanted her\nfood. Separately, a man lost control of his motorcycle after a monkey tried to\ngrab a bag of food from him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want humans to have to hurt monkeys, and I don\u2019t want monkeys to have\nto hurt humans,\u201d Athapol Charoenshunsa, the director general of the department\nof national parks, wildlife and plant conservation, said at a news conference.\n\nSome people have fed the monkeys for generations and feel they are part of the\ncity\u2019s identity. Others say the macaque population has grown too big and that\nthe animals are damaging to businesses and properties and are endangering\npeople\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cPeople say that if there are no monkeys, then it is not Lopburi,\u201d one\nresident, Phairoth, told the Thai broadcaster Channel 3. \u201cI want people who\nsay that to take a monkey into their own house and look after it. Let\u2019s share\nthem, five per house, 10 per house. I\u2019ll help deliver the food to their house\nas well.\u201d\n\nThe monkeys are infamous for ambushing people and businesses in search of\nsnacks. Some food sellers have resorted to carrying slingshots to threaten the\nanimals if they approach. Shops have installed metal grilles and displayed\nlarge toy animals \u2013 crocodiles or tigers \u2013 to deter the intruders. When the\nThai prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, visited the city this year, residents\ntried to hand him a printed frame of an image that had gone viral on social\nmedia of a young girl holding a toy gun to warn off monkeys as she walked\nthrough the city.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram.

A small number of macaques would be allowed to remain in the city.\n\nWildlife authorities began rounding up the most aggressive males last week,\ncatching 37 so far. According to Thai media, four gang leaders are among those\nthat were caught. A fifth monkey, known for stealing underwear and necklaces\nfrom a shop, is still free.\n\nRival troops of monkeys occupy different buildings, including a derelict\ncinema. Monkeys that were caught would be kept in enclosures for their group,\nauthorities said.\n\n\u201cThere are people who like monkeys, while others don\u2019t. I think that, compared\nto 10 years ago, the population of monkeys has increased significantly,\u201d said\nresident Job Jirapat, adding that she understood both sides.\n\nThe authorities have run sterilisation campaigns, and from 2014-23 neutered\nabout 2,600 macaques.\n\nFemale monkeys are able to reproduce twice a year, and the abundance of high-\nsugar treats given over recent decades has meant they have plenty of energy to\ndo so. Last year, the population totalled 5,709.\n\n\u201cIf sterilisation can be carried out consistently, it is a good long-term\nsolution,\u201d said Job. \u201cI have a feeling that the government didn\u2019t take it\nseriously. It is possible that they were not able to continue because of a\nlack of funding, which is why the number of monkeys is increasing so quickly.\nAnother thing that we should do is stop feeding monkeys.\u201d\n\nExperts have previously called for greater education about what type of food\ncan be given to monkeys, and how and when they should be fed. The province\ncelebrates an annual \u201cmonkey buffet\u201d festival, where the monkeys are given\nhuge feasts of fruit and other treats.\n\nAthapol said the phased roundup of monkeys kwould \u201csolve the problem very\nquickly\u201d but some people are sceptical. \u201cIf the officers only capture a few\nones or only the mean ones, then, to be honest, it won\u2019t make any difference,\u201d\nPanya Phaopahol, a noodle seller, told Channel 7 TV.\n\nJob said that while monkeys may be a symbol of the city, having fewer around\nwould improve people\u2019s quality of life and keep the city cleaner. \u201cAnd I think\nLopburi has more to offer than just monkeys.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this story\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Thailand\n  * Animals\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Swiss farmers dump dead sheep in protest against rising wolf numbers\n\n6 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Five injured in second bear attack in Slovakia in three days\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Life at Norway\u2019s remote arctic fox breeding station \u2013 in pictures\n\n4 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### One of world\u2019s smallest fish found to make sound as loud as a gunshot\n\n27 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### The week in wildlife \u2013 in pictures: four rare Amur leopards, perching puffins and a hungry fox\n\n23 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### More than 2,700 dangerous wild animals kept in homes in Great Britain\n\n22 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Fluffy the alligator snapping turtle with \u2018nasty bite\u2019 found in Cumbrian tarn\n\n10 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Escaped monkey found snacking on peanuts in Highlands garden\n\n1 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Missing monkey trapped by yorkshire pudding in Scotland\n\n1 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Thai woman charged over lion cub filmed cruising resort in Bentley\n\n26 Jan 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
