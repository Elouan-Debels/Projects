I\u2019d probably be\nricher, too.\n\nApple Stock Price Between 1996 and 2024...\n\nBut my life sure would have been a lot less interesting, and my potential for\nimpact, a lot smaller. I would have missed so many incredible experiences and\npeople.\n\nI have zero regrets.\n\nStill, today\u2019s hiring environment represents additional challenges for people\nwith non-linear careers. I\u2019ve found this to be true for me personally, but\nalso for others I have worked with as an advisor and coach.\n\nFor every new role, companies are awash in applications and many are using\nsome form of pattern matching to manage the volume. If your career didn\u2019t\nfollow a straight line, you may find fitting the prescribed patterns to be a\ndifficult task.\n\nEven just to get a foot in the door, you need to be extra considerate about\nthe opportunities you pursue and how you go after them.\n\nIf you want to maximize your probability of success, here are a few strategies\nI have found to be helpful.\n\n  * Look for opportunities where being non-linear gives you super powers\n\n  * Customize a story of your career as a narrative to match the opportunity\n\n  * Cultivate a network of people who value the intersections in your career\n\n####\n\nPlaces where non-linear is a super power\n\nYou want to find opportunities where the diversity of your career is\nconsidered a strength, and not a liability. Below are a few broad areas where\nI have personally found that to be true.\n\nDo you know of others? I\u2019d love to hear about them in the comments.\n\n1) Bridging multiple domains\n\nExperience working in different domains can enable you to be a very effective\ntranslator, whether that\u2019s between sectors like healthcare and AI, or between\ndifferent roles, like engineering and sales.\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t worked in one of those domains, having already been an\n\u201cexpert turned newbie\u201d you are better positioned to translate for a new\ndomain.\n\nIn other words, you have experienced not know everything, and you know any one\ndomain is unlikely to have all the answers. That\u2019s a strength.\n\n> \u201cModern work demands knowledge transfer: the ability to apply knowledge to\n> new situations and different domains. Our most fundamental thought processes\n> have changed to accommodate increasing complexity and the need to derive new\n> patterns rather than rely only on familiar ones. - David Epstein: Range\n\n2) Turnarounds\n\nLeading turnarounds is another area where people who have more breadth of\nexperience can shine, particularly when you\u2019re talking about turnarounds that\nbecame necessary due to external factors*, such as changing market conditions.\n\nYour greater breadth means you have more exposure to other approaches, and the\nability to understand and learn from other domains can greatly increase your\noptions and your probability of success.\n\nYou also probably have seen a wider range of failures and success, are\nunlikely just to insist to keep doing what already failed, like the proverbial\nhammer in search of a nail.\n\n[* Stakeholders can often conflate internal and external factors. If you\u2019re\nconsidering tackling a turnaround, check out my last post on the subject]\n\n3) Entrepreneurship and creators\n\nStarting something new can greatly benefit from a broader experience base.\nResearch has demonstrated that exposure to diverse experiences can enhance\nindividuals' creativity and innovation capabilities.\n\nEntrepreneurs who have worked across multiple domains or industries may bring\nfresh perspectives and unconventional solutions to business challenges, which\ncan be compelling to investors looking for novel and disruptive ideas.\n\nThis is especially true if you\u2019re working to intersect domains where you have\nexperience, say applying expertise or familiar technology to another area you\nare intimately aware of.\n\n> When you step into an intersection of fields, disciplines, or cultures, you\n> can combine existing concepts into a large number of extraordinary ideas. -\n> Frans Johansson, The Medici Effect\n\n4) Coaching\n\nCoaching benefits from your accumulated expertise and insights to guide others\nalong their career journeys, especially for people taking a non-linear path.\n\nBy drawing on your own experiences and lessons learned, and providing\nmentorship, you not only contribute to the development of individuals but also\nreinforce your own understanding and mastery of the different subjects or\nindustries.\n\nA growing number of people are transitioning to new kinds of work, and whether\nvoluntary or involuntary, they can greatly benefit from the experience of\nsomeone who has navigated their own transitions.\n\n####\n\nCustomizing a story of your career\n\nAs mentioned previously, recruiters and hiring managers are increasingly using\npattern matching to manage the sheer volume of applicants.\n\nTo increase your chance of being interviewed and getting an offer, you\u2019ll want\nto practice and highlight a narrative for your career that succinctly\ndemonstrates how you are a good match for the opportunity.\n\nTo do this, you need to first step back and brainstorm several key elements.\n\n  * A passion or purpose that drove your career, and how it ties into the organization\u2019s reason for being\n\n  * Problems you solved that are highly relevant to the opportunity\n\n  * Skills or expertise that you used that were core to solving those problems\n\n  * Impact that you created, that the organization would value\n\n  * How the intersection of your domains and disciplines make you powerfully suited to tackle the opportunity\n\nThen use those elements to construct a narrative of your career, customized\nfor several important conversations and formats:\n\n  * For asking someone in your network for an introduction, referral or reference\n\n  * For outreach to a recruiter or hiring manager\n\n  * To customize your cover letter and resume\n\n  * For informational interviews or first conversations with recruiters\n\nFurthermore, if you make it far enough, you\u2019ll want to use these elements for\nyour interview preparation. Use them to customize a handful of case studies\nyou can draw on to answer questions during your interviews.\n\nUltimately, we are in a \u201cbuyers market\u201d for jobs: you can\u2019t rely on hirers to\nconnect the dots between the opportunity and your career. As much as possible\nyou need to do it for them, because you\u2019re the one that can look back and do\nso.\n\n> You can\u2019t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them\n> looking backward. - Steve Jobs\n\n####\n\nCultivating a network of people who value your intersections\n\nThis may be the most important step you can take, though also one that takes\nthe most time.\n\nThe goal is to activate a network of people who can send you opportunities and\nrefer you to roles where you will be valued. In particular, you want a group\nof people that:\n\n  1. Understand the value of non-linear careers, because they have one themselves or because they have worked with people who have\n\n  2. Can see your non-linear career as a differentiator, and recognize that the intersections of different aspects of your career give you a super power\n\n  3. Are steeped enough in a domain that they can help you customize your career narrative and your offer to companies to work in that domain\n\nAs an example, I ended up working at Facebook in large part due to a referral\nfrom a fellow entrepreneur that could recognize the value my non-linear career\noffered and who was well positioned to tell my story to people within Facebook\nthat mattered. Likewise, I was fortunate to be hired at Automattic by a leader\nexperienced enough to see my potential (with her own non-linear career), but\nwho was also connected to people in my network who could verify that value.\n\nIn contrast, here are a couple examples of feedback I\u2019ve gotten from people\nthat did not meet any of the above criteria:\n\n  * \u201cYou\u2019re clearly experienced with product, but we don\u2019t know what to make of everything else you have done.\u201d\n\n  * \u201cYou probably like working on different things because you know you\u2019re not good enough at any of them.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to encounter the above, cultivate a network of people who\nunderstand that not all value comes from straight lines.\n\n####\n\nNot all those who wander are lost\n\nI\u2019ll close with this poem from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings, a riddle\nwhich was given to Frodo by Gandalf to identify the real \u201cStrider\u201d, a ranger\nwho had been wandering Middle-earth for years.\n\n> All that is gold does not glitter,\n>\n> Not all those who wander are lost;\n>\n> The old that is strong does not wither,\n>\n> Deep roots are not reached by the frost.\n>\n> From the ashes a fire shall be woken,\n>\n> A light from the shadows shall spring;\n>\n> Renewed shall be blade that was broken,\n>\n> The crownless again shall be king.\n\nEven Aragorn, Hero of the Fellowship and future king of Gondor, needed help to\nbe recognized and for his wandering to be valued.\n\nLike Aragorn, show the world you may have wandered, but you are not lost.\n\nThanks for reading Probable Wisdom!
