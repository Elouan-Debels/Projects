The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose43 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 of 43\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 of 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 of 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 of 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 of 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

To some, that sounds like tempting fate.\n\nListen to this article \u00b7 9:41 min Learn more\n\nCredit...Weston Wei\n\nBy Talmon Joseph Smith\n\nApril 11, 2024, 5:02 a.m. ET\n\nFor much of modern history, even the richest nations have been subject to big\nperennial upswings and crashes in commercial activity almost as fixed as the\nfour seasons.\n\nPeriods of economic growth get overstretched by increased risk-taking. Hiring\nand investment crest and fall into a contraction as consumer confidence wanes\nand spending craters. Sales fall, bankruptcies and unemployment rise. Then, in\nthe depths of a recession, debts are settled, panic abates, green shoots\nappear, and banks begin lending more easily again \u2014 fueling a recovery that\nenables a new upswing.\n\nBut a brigade of academic economists and prominent voices on Wall Street are\nasking if the unruly business cycle they learned in school, and witnessed in\npractice, has fundamentally morphed into a tamer beast.\n\nRick Rieder, who manages about $3 trillion in assets at the investment firm\nBlackRock, is one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of ink spilled on what type of landing we will see for the\nU.S. economy,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients last summer \u2014 employing the\ncommon metaphor for whether the U.S. economy will crash or achieve a \u201csoft\nlanding\u201d of lower inflation, slower growth and mild unemployment.\n\n\u201cBut one point to keep in mind,\u201d Mr. Rieder continued, \u201cis that satellites\ndon\u2019t land and maybe that is a better analogy for a modern advanced economy\u201d\nlike the United States. In other words, dips in momentum will now happen\nwithin a steadier orbit.\n\nAnd there is some evidence that the current spurt of economic growth may have\nnot just months but several years to run, barring an external disruption (what\neconomists call an \u201cexogenous shock\u201d) or a return of high inflation that\nprompts the Federal Reserve to push the economy into recession.\n\n\u201cFinancial reporters and market strategists often argue about whether we are\n\u2018early-cycle,\u2019 \u2018mid-cycle\u2019 or \u2018late-cycle,\u2019\u201d David Kelly, the chief global\nstrategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a March 11 note to\ninvestors that closely aligned with Mr. Rieder\u2019s \u201csatellite\u201d thesis. \u201cHowever,\nthese perspectives are based on an outdated model of how the U.S. economy\nbehaves.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the U.S. economy\nbetween the 1850s and the early 1980s experienced 30 recessions lasting an\naverage of 18 months, with intervening periods of economic growth averaging\nonly 33 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHelping drive this pattern, Mr. Kelly and other economists explain, were\nhighly cyclical industries: Manufacturing and agriculture, now only a fraction\nof overall output, were once mainstays of the U.S. economy.\n\n## Inflation F.A.Q.\n\nCard 1 of 5\n\nWhat is inflation? Inflation is a general increase in prices, which will cause\na loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far\ntomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in\nprices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel,\ntransportation and toys.\n\nWhat causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But\ninflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do\nwith economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain\nproblems.\n\nIs inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell\ntrouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.\n\nHow does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to\nshoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their\nbudgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.\n\nCan inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells\ntrouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly\nduring inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their\nvalue better.\n\nToday, manufacturing accounts for about $2.3 trillion of gross domestic\nproduct, employs about 12 million people and indirectly supports other local\njobs. (Every manufacturing job, for instance, spurs seven to 12 new jobs in\nrelated industries, according to a McKinsey estimate.)\n\nBut the consumer-driven U.S. economy, mostly made up of services (health care,\nauto repair, nail salons, customer service, administration and so on), is\nalmost $30 trillion in size. Uptrends and pullbacks in the production of goods\nhave less impact now. The relative stability of total household spending in\nrecent years is a key part of why the United States has avoided a recession.\n\nAmerica\u2019s contemporary economy, Mr. Rieder argued in his note to clients, is\nless vulnerable to the boom-and-bust cycles of old \u2014 mainly because its\nprosperous consumers are service-oriented, less dependent than ever on\nfactories or farms. Consumption spending makes up about 70 percent of the\neconomy.\n\n\u201cConsumption doesn\u2019t really adjust that dramatically without some major form\nof economic stress,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne piece of data in favor of Mr. Rieder\u2019s \u201csatellite\u201d theory is the absence\nof any widespread weakness before the pandemic crippled economies worldwide.\n\nThat was consistent with a developing trend: Since the early 1980s, there have\nbeen only four recessions, lasting an average of nine months, with economic\nexpansions averaging 104 months.\n\nThe current period of job growth is in its 40th month.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to jinx it,\u201d Ann Harrison, the dean of the Haas School of\nBusiness at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview \u2014\nnoting that peak confidence in economic expansions frequently arrives right\nbefore their downfall. (Talk has picked up of a new \u201cRoaring Twenties,\u201d an era\nthat didn\u2019t end well.)\n\nAs ever, there are reasons to worry. The emergence and rapid growth of \u201cshadow\nbanks\u201d operating in private markets with little oversight of their lending has\nconcerned many economists and old-school regulators. And a range of industry\ninsiders in commercial real estate say the negative effects of lower office\noccupancy rates \u2014 for local economies and government budgets \u2014 have only just\nbegun.\n\nYet Mr. Kelly of J.P. Morgan lists various reasons that periods of U.S.\neconomic growth may be elongated and less chaotic going forward. Federal\ndeposit insurance, introduced after the Depression, sharply reduced bank\npanics and failures. Vastly improved information on inventory levels among\ngoods-producing businesses, he said, has \u201ctamed\u201d the inventory cycle,\npreventing mismatches between supply and demand that can cause mass layoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe rise of international trade, Mr. Kelly added, can often offset slowing\ndomestic demand since businesses, enabled by the internet, can find customers\nthroughout the globe. And the service sector\u2019s growth, he concluded, has \u201cmade\nthe economy more stable and, importantly, less sensitive to interest rates.\u201d\n\nAcross the economics profession, many are not feeling as reassured.\n\nWhen weighing recession risks, Thomas Herndon, a professor of economics at\nJohn Jay College of the City University of New York, doesn\u2019t take much long-\nterm solace in the growing sophistication of big business. There are, he said,\n\u201cmany, many, many causes\u201d for downturns \u2014 some of which are not directly\nlinked to financial instability.\n\nMr. Herndon noted the work of the 20th-century Polish economist Michal\nKalecki, who argued that business leaders feel \u201cundermined\u201d by the maintenance\nof full employment. Using their substantial influence over policy, Kalecki\nargued, they can help institute restrictive economic policies that bring times\nof economic expansion to an end and reset them with softer, more tolerable\nlabor power.\n\nAnd Mr. Herndon said he thought old-fashioned \u201cbubble\u201d manias and \u201ccredit\ncycles\u201d remained a danger, too.\n\nEliminating the longstanding economic cycle would be \u201cthe holy grail of\ncentral banking,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING,\nthe global bank. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s willingness to use innovative tools\u201d \u2014 like its\noff-the-cuff creation of lending facilities to keep credit flowing on Main\nStreet and heal bank balance sheets since 2020 \u2014 gives it \u201cmore levers to\nwiggle to help reduce the chance of a downturn,\u201d Mr. Knightley said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPhrases like \u2018This time it will be different\u2019\u201d generally have a bad track\nrecord, he said. \u201cBut maybe it will.\u201d\n\nIn several ways, this time has been different so far.\n\nTypically, the housing sector \u2014 and its interconnected industries, from\nconstruction and home improvement to real estate finance \u2014 accounts for nearly\n20 percent of U.S. output. The Federal Reserve has more than quadrupled its\ninterest-rate levels since the spring of 2022, bringing its key policy rate to\nover 5 percent from near zero. That drove mortgage rates to unaffordable highs\nand made financing new home building difficult. And the residential real\nestate sector, highly sensitive to interest rates, ground to a halt. But the\neconomy as a whole continued to grow.\n\nWhen in-person services plummeted during the pandemic, e-commerce and goods-\nbuying picked up the slack. By the time millions of households were sated with\ngoods purchases and manufacturing fell off, the in-person economy was\nreopening and in-person services began a booming recovery.\n\nThere are some market analysts, such as Jim Bianco of Bianco Research, who\nbelieve that the U.S. economy \u2014 in its dynamism, diversity and size \u2014 has in\nsome respects begun to resemble the global economy itself, which typically\ncontracts only when colossal shocks to output occur.\n\nThe global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 which were separated\nby only 10 years and did cause global recessions \u2014 show that while rare, such\nmaelstroms can coincidentally occur back to back. So, long expansions are no\nguarantee. On the flip side, Australia went about three decades without a\nrecession until Covid ended the streak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNina Eichacker, a professor of economics at the University of Rhode Island and\nthe author of two recent papers about government responses to crises, cited\nanother influence: a powerful school of thought that government interventions,\neven amid downturns, add \u201cfrictions and inefficiencies to markets\u201d and \u201cmake\nus worse off overall.\u201d\n\nThe robust federal response to the pandemic shock was enabled by a general\nview that it was an act of nature. Future financial stresses are more likely\nto have villains, which means proposed solutions are more likely to face\ndivision in Congress even if unemployment is notably rising.\n\nBut Ms. Eichacker thinks that those political limits to consensus may soften\nif this expansion rolls on and public opinion of the hefty federal response\nthat helped foster it grows fonder.\n\n\u201cI am sometimes freaked out by how optimistic I feel about the state of\nthings,\u201d she said. \u201cEconomically anyway.\u201d\n\nTalmon Joseph Smith is a Times economics reporter, based in New York.
