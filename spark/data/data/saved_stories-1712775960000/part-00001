It can be republished for free.\n\nAs Roach tracked the health of Arizona residents, the gap between mortality\nrates of people living in rural areas and those of their urban peers was\nwidening.\n\nThe health disparities between rural and urban Americans have long been\ndocumented, but a recent report from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic\nResearch Service found the chasm has grown in recent decades. In their\nexamination, USDA researchers found rural Americans from the ages of 25 to 54\ndie from natural causes, like chronic diseases and cancer, at wildly higher\nrates than the same age group living in urban areas. The analysis did not\ninclude external causes of death, such as suicide or accidental overdose.\n\nThe research analyzed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention death data\nfrom two three-year periods \u2014 1999 through 2001 and 2017 through 2019. In\n1999, the natural-cause mortality rate for people ages 25 to 54 in rural areas\nwas only 6% higher than for city dwellers in the same age bracket. By 2019,\nthe gap widened to 43%.\n\nThe researchers found the expanding gap was driven by rapid growth in the\nnumber of women living in rural places who succumb young to treatable or\npreventable diseases. In the most rural places, counties without an urban core\npopulation of 10,000 or more, women in this age group saw an 18% increase in\nnatural-cause mortality rates during the study period, while their male peers\nexperienced a 3% increase.\n\nWithin the prime working-age group, cancer and heart disease were the leading\nnatural causes of death for both men and women in both rural and urban areas.\nAmong women, the incidence of lung disease in remote parts of the nation grew\nthe most when compared with rates in urban areas, followed by hepatitis.\nPregnancy-related deaths also played a role, accounting for the highest rate\nof natural-cause mortality growth for women ages 25 to 54 in rural areas.\n\nThe negative trends for rural non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native\npeople were especially pronounced. The analysis shows Native Americans 25 to\n54 years old had a 46% natural-cause mortality rate increase over those two\ndecades. Native women had an even greater mortality rate jump, 55%, between\nthe two studied time periods, while the rate for non-Hispanic White women went\nup 23%.\n\nThe rural-urban gap grew in all regions across the nation but was widest in\nthe South.\n\n#### Email Sign-Up\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\n\nThe increased mortality rates are an indicator of worsening population health,\nthe study authors noted, which can harm local economies and employment.\n\nAs access to and quality of health services in rural areas continue to erode,\nrural health experts said, the USDA findings should spur stronger policies\nfocused on rural health.\n\nAlan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, said he found the\nreport \u201cshocking,\u201d though, \u201cunfortunately, not surprising.\u201d\n\nThe disparity warrants greater attention from state and national leaders,\nMorgan said.\n\nThe study does not address causes for the increase in mortality rates, but the\nauthors note that differences in health care resources could compromise the\naccessibility, quality, and affordability of care in rural areas. Hospitals in\nsmall and remote communities have long struggled, and continued closures or\nconversions limit health care services in many places. The authors note that\npersistently higher rates of poverty, disability, and chronic disease in rural\nareas, compounded by fewer physicians per capita and the closure of hospitals,\naffect community health.\n\nRoach said his past job as an epidemiologist included working with social\nvulnerability indexes, which factor in income, race, education, and access to\nresources like housing to get a sense of a community\u2019s resilience against\nadverse health outcomes. A map of Arizona shows that rural counties and\nreservations have some of the highest vulnerability rankings.\n\nJanice C. Probst, a retired professor at the University of South Carolina\nwhose work focused on rural health, said many current rural health efforts are\nfocused on sustaining hospitals, which she noted are essential sources of\nhealth care. But she said that may not be the best way to address the\ninequities.\n\n\u201cWe may have to take a community approach,\u201d said Probst, who reviewed the\nreport before its release. \u201cNot how do we keep the hospital in the community,\nbut how do we keep the community alive at all?\u201d\n\nThe disparities among demographics stood out to Probst, along with something\nelse. She said the states with the highest rates of natural-cause mortality in\nrural areas included South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, and others\nthat have not expanded Medicaid, the joint federal and state health insurance\nprogram for low-income people, though there are efforts to expand it in some\nstates, particularly Mississippi.\n\nIt\u2019s an observation the USDA researchers make as well.\n\n\u201cRegionally, differences in State implementation of Medicaid expansion under\nthe 2010 Affordable Care Act could have increased implications for uninsured\nrural residents in States without expansions by potentially influencing the\nfrequency of medical care for those at risk,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWesley James, founding executive director of the Center for Community Research\nand Evaluation, at the University of Memphis, said state lawmakers could\naddress part of the problem by advocating for Medicaid expansion in their\nstates, which would increase access to health care in rural areas. A large\ngroup of people want it, but politicians aren\u2019t listening to their needs, he\nsaid. James also reviewed the report before it was published.\n\nAccording to KFF polling, two-thirds of people living in nonexpansion states\nwant their state to expand the health insurance program.\n\nMorgan added the study focused on deaths that occurred prior to the covid-19\npandemic, which had a devastating effect in rural areas.\n\n\u201cCovid really changed the nature of public health in rural America,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI hope that this prompts Congress to direct the CDC to look at rural-urban\nlife expectancies during covid and since covid to get a handle on what we\u2019re\nactually seeing nationwide.\u201d\n\nIn Arizona, the leading cause of death for people 45 to 64 in 2021 in both\nrural and urban areas was covid, according to Roach.\n\nJazmin Orozco Rodriguez: jorozco@kff.org, @jazmin1orozco\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * Health Industry\n  * Race and Health\n  * Rural Health\n  * States\n  * Alabama\n  * Alaska\n  * Arizona\n  * Cancer\n  * Georgia\n  * Hospitals\n  * Mississippi\n  * Pregnancy\n  * South Carolina\n\nContact Us Submit a Story Tip\n\nShare This Story:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * Republish This Story\n\nWe want to hear from you: Contact Us\n\nRepublish This Story\n\n### Copy And Paste To Republish This Story\n\n# City-Country Mortality Gap Widens Amid Persistent Holes in Rural Health Care\nAccess\n\nBy Jazmin Orozco Rodriguez April 9, 2024\n\nWe encourage organizations to republish our content, free of charge.
