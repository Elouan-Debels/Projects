In the present study, we draw\non life history theory to examine the relationship between population density\nand fertility across 174 countries over 69 years (1950 to 2019). We find a\nrobust association between density and fertility over time, both within and\nbetween-countries. That is, increases in population density are associated\nwith declines in fertility rates, controlling for a variety of socioeconomic,\nsocioecological, geographic, population-based, and female empowerment\nvariables. We also tested predictions about environmental boundary conditions.\nIn harsher living conditions (e.g., higher homicide or pathogen rates), the\neffect of increased population density on fertility rates was attenuated. The\ndensity-fertility association was also moderated by religiousness and strength\nof social norms, where the relationship between density and fertility was\nattenuated in countries with high religiosity and strong social norms. We\ndiscuss why and when changes in population density may influence fertility\nrates and the broader implications of this work.\n\nOriginal language| English (US)  \n---|---  \nPages (from-to)| 933-946  \nNumber of pages| 14  \nJournal| American Psychologist  \nVolume| 76  \nIssue number| 6  \nDOIs|\n\n  * https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000862\n\n  \nState| Published - 2021  \n  \n## Keywords\n\n  * Crosscultural differences\n  * Demographic transition\n  * Fertility\n  * Life history theory\n  * Population density\n\n## ASJC Scopus subject areas\n\n  * General Psychology\n\n## Access to Document\n\n  * 10.1037/amp0000862\n\n## Other files and links\n\n  * Link to publication in Scopus\n\n## Fingerprint\n\nDive into the research topics of 'Increasing Population Densities Predict\nDecreasing Fertility Rates Over Time: A 174-Nation Investigation'.
