Nestled in the Allegheny Mountain\ntown of White Sulphur Springs, the Greenbrier has expanded over the centuries,\ngrowing from a series of summer cottages to a palatial hotel surrounded by\ngardens and golf courses. So, when the resort broke ground on a new wing in\nlate 1958, no one was surprised.\n\nBut observant locals soon noticed something odd about the project. The hole\ndug for the foundation was enormous, and vast amounts of concrete arrived\nevery day on trucks, along with puzzling items: 110 urinals, huge steel doors.\nGuards were stationed outside.\n\nWithin weeks of the groundbreaking, it was clear to many that the new West\nVirginia Wing held far more than just guest rooms and conference facilities.\nBut locals kept their suspicions private.\n\nA 19th-century depiction of the Greenbrier Public domain via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u201cEveryone just agreed to be in on the secret,\u201d says Ann Tate Bell, who grew up\nnearby.\n\nThanks to this discretion, nearly 35 years passed before the rest of the\ncountry learned the truth: The Greenbrier\u2019s West Virginia Wing sat atop a\nnuclear bunker the size of two football fields stacked on top of one another.\nInside, behind a 25-ton blast door, stood a living and working space equipped\nto hold every single member of the United States Congress. The hideout boasted\nmore than 1,000 bunk beds, a 400-seat cafeteria, individual auditoriums for\nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives, vast water tanks, and a\ntrash incinerator that could serve as a crematorium.\n\nGovernment officials chose the resort as the bunker site because of its\nisolated location, long relationship with the nation\u2019s political elite and\nproximity to Washington, D.C. (about a four-hour drive away). The Greenbrier\nwas, in the words of the Washington Post, \u201cthe ultimate congressional\nhideaway.\u201d\n\nView of the bunker under construction in January 1960 Courtesy of the\nGreenbrier\n\nTrish Parker, a lifelong resident of western Greenbrier County, says the\nbunker was the definition of an open secret. \u201cPeople wondered about it to\ntheir husband, their wife, their brother\u2014but they weren\u2019t going to wonder\nabout it to anyone else,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t talk about it to\noutsiders.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine such a secret being kept today, but the late 1950s were a\nvery different time. Construction of the bunker\u2014code-named Project Greek\nIsland\u2014began during the Cold War and was completed in 1962, the year of the\nCuban missile crisis. At this point in the conflict, ordinary Americans\nviscerally feared the threat of a Soviet attack. People built bomb shelters in\ntheir backyards and stockpiled Spam and Geiger counters. Elementary school\nstudents practiced \u201cduck and cover\u201d drills. (\u201cWhat are you supposed to do when\nyou see the flash?\u201d asked Bert the Turtle in a popular civil defense\nfilmstrip. \u201cDuck and cover!\u201d the children shouted, curled up turtle-like under\ntheir desks.) World War II, with its \u201cLoose Lips Sink Ships\u201d posters, wasn\u2019t\nlong in the rearview mirror.\n\n\u201cPeople were afraid,\u201d says Trish, who now works part-time at the Greenbrier,\ngiving public tours of the bunker facility. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to know too\nmuch.\u201d\n\nThe bunker was equipped to house the entirety of Congress. Courtesy of the\nGreenbrier\n\nIn Greenbrier County, this secrecy runs deeper than the Cold War. The\nGreenbrier was (and still is) by far the biggest employer in the area.\nMultiple generations of families worked there, often for life. This bred a\nsense of loyalty\u2014and fear of losing the only good job you could likely get\nnearby.\n\n\u201cTheir father worked there, their grandfather worked there, they worked there,\ntheir children were going to work there,\u201d says Trish. \u201cThere was the feeling\nthat what was good for the Greenbrier was good for Greenbrier County.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a family thing,\u201d says Christy Parker (no relation to Trish), whose\ngreat-grandmother started working at the Greenbrier as a young widow in the\nlate 1800s. Christy grew up in White Sulphur Springs and became a fourth-\ngeneration employee after college, eventually working her way up to conference\nservices manager, organizing massive corporate expos at the resort. \u201cI never\nwent past that magical door,\u201d she says, referring to the blast door that\ndivided the Greenbrier\u2019s public area from the bunker, which was hidden in\nplain sight behind floral wallpaper.\n\nA diagram of the bunker, which was hidden beneath the resort's West Virginia\nWing Courtesy of the Greenbrier\n\nPeggy Boso, a retired teacher from White Sulphur Springs, used to babysit at\nthe hotel. One night, just after the bunker was revealed in 1992, she babysat\na senator\u2019s children. The senator asked her if everyone in town had known the\nsecret.\n\n\u201cI said, basically, \u2018Yes, but nobody ever talked about it because it was a way\nof putting food on the table,\u2019\u201d Boso recalls.\n\nLoyalty and discretion didn\u2019t always keep children from talking, though.\nMargaret Clay Hambrick, secretary of the Greenbrier Historical Society, grew\nup in Greenbrier County in the 1950s and 1960s and heard rumors about the\nbunker at school. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018OK, that\u2019s great for them, but if a\nnuclear bomb explodes on top of the bunker, all of us here are toast,\u2019\u201d she\nsays.\n\nInstallation of a bunker blast door in May 1961 Courtesy of the Greenbrier\n\nLocal parents were quick to warn their children against loose talk. Bell\u2019s\nfather ran the Greenbrier Valley Airport, a few miles from the resort. The\nairport was extended when the bunker was built, using dirt dug from the\nenormous foundation hole. Bell\u2019s father had a government security clearance,\nwhich he took very seriously. One day, during construction, Bell\u2019s brother,\nwho was 8 or 9 at the time, was riding bikes with his friends around the\nbuilding site. They spotted a fancy new elevator being put in, and their eyes\nwidened. One of the construction workers noted their excited faces and offered\nthem an elevator ride. The boys were thrilled.\n\n\u201cAt dinner that night, my brother was telling us, and my father was\nhorrified,\u201d Bell recalls. \u201cFinally, he said, \u2018This is top secret\u2014you should\ncall your friends in, and I will give them the same lecture I\u2019m giving you.\nThis must never be mentioned.\u2019\u201d\n\nRobert Conte has spent some four decades as the Greenbrier\u2019s official\nhistorian, arriving at the resort in 1978. He immediately sensed that\nsomething was off about the West Virginia Wing.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, reading about it, I remember thinking, \u2018Why did it take\nthem three years to build a three-story building?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole thing\nseemed odd.\u201d\n\nThe Bunker At The Greenbrier\n\nWatch on\n\nConte became close friends with Fritz Bugas, manager of Forsythe Associates,\nthe audiovisual company that serviced the resort\u2019s televisions. It was\nstrange, Conte thought, that while all other Greenbrier workers, from\nelectricians to cooks to plumbers, were employees, the Forsythe staff were\ncontractors. He was right to be suspicious: Forsythe was a dummy company, and\nthe workers\u2019 real job was maintaining the bunker over the years.\n\nIn early 1992, a Washington Post reporter named Ted Gup stopped by the\nGreenbrier. Gup had received an anonymous tip about the bunker and was looking\nfor answers.\n\n\u201cOne of the most memorable moments of my life was [Gup] coming and putting a\ntape recorder on my desk and saying, \u2018I\u2019m here to talk about what\u2019s under the\nWest Virginia Wing,\u2019\u201d Conte says.\n\nConte, who still didn\u2019t know the truth himself, gave Gup the official line:\nRumors had always circulated about the Greenbrier, but they were just\nthat\u2014rumors.\n\n\u201cOf course, Gup didn\u2019t believe a word I said,\u201d Conte recalls, laughing.\n\nBunk beds in the Greenbrier bunker Courtesy of the Greenbrier\n\nThe Washington Times scooped the Post, publishing a story about the bunker on\nMay 29, 1992. Gup\u2019s expos\u00e9 appeared two days later in the Post magazine. \u201cThe\nGreenbrier was different in that it relied more on the element of secrecy than\non any mountain of rock to shield it from incoming bombs,\u201d Gup wrote. \u201cYet\ndespite the discretion of the resort staff, the existence of some kind of\nhidden government installation there was widely known.\u201d\n\nWhen the truth came out, few people in the area were surprised at the bunker\u2019s\nexistence, Conte says. But they were surprised to discover that it was\nintended for Congress. Most had believed it was for the president. (John F.\nKennedy, for his part, had two bunkers: one on the island of Nantucket in\nMassachusetts, near the Kennedy compound, and the other on Peanut Island,\nclose to the president\u2019s vacation home in Palm Beach, Florida.) This had given\nthe Greenbrier convenient cover over the years: Staff could simply deny that\nthe resort was home to a secret presidential facility.\n\nNewspaper articles about the bunker Courtesy of the Greenbrier\n\n\u201cThat was a secret within a secret,\u201d Conte says. \u201cNobody thought it was for\n1,100 people. That was the real jaw-dropper.\u201d\n\nMany locals were angry, even furious, with Gup and the Post.\n\n\u201cIt was a point of pride to have it there, to have that little bit of mystery\nthat no one else in the country knew about,\u201d says Trish. \u201cAnd then when\nsomeone who they considered an outsider came in and revealed it, they felt\nvery betrayed.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, congressional leadership expressed \u201cregret\u201d at the Post\u2019s\ndecision to publish the piece. \u201cIt was always clear that if the secret of the\nfacility\u2019s location were to be compromised, the effectiveness and security of\nthe program would be jeopardized, if not terminated,\u201d the leaders said.\n\nThe anonymous tipster who first alerted Gup to the bunker\u2019s existence has\nnever been publicly identified. But Conte understands them to be a person in\nthe federal government, who didn\u2019t like that money was being spent to maintain\na nuclear bunker in the post-Cold War era. When the story came out,\npoliticians did indeed come under fire, not only for spending taxpayer dollars\non an outmoded bunker but also for the very idea of saving Congress while\nordinary citizens were left out in the cold.\n\nDeclassified shortly after the expos\u00e9, the bunker opened for tours in 1995.\nThe first people to tour it were Greenbrier employees, who received the\nopportunity as a quiet thank you for their discretion. More than 30 years\nlater, tours of the site\u2014now overseen by the Greenbrier\u2019s owners rather than\nthe government\u2014remain incredibly popular with the public.\n\nWhen Trish leads tours, one of the most frequently asked questions is whether\nmore remains hidden: a new bunker, a deeper room, something yet unrevealed.\n\n\u201cIt would be lovely if there was,\u201d she says, \u201ca little mystery. But there\u2019s\nnot.\u201d\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?\n\nEmily Matchar | | READ MORE\n\nEmily Matchar is a writer from North Carolina.
