I feel like I shaved 12\nmonths off the time it would take us to get to product-market fit.\u201d\n\n### 01\n\nSecond time founder\n\n  * 02\n\n\u201cIf you think you know what it takes to get to PMF, this program helps you\nrealize that you really don't. But it also gives you the tools, support and\ncompanionship to accomplish the first key steps of the critical PMF journey.\u201d\n\n### 02\n\nFounder and former head of ML\n\n  * 03\n\n\u201cPMF Method added structure and rigor around the most important part of our\nfounder journey. The PMF framework is now deeply ingrained into our daily\nconversations about our customers and product.\u201d\n\n### 03\n\nFounder and former head of product\n\n  * 04\n\n\u201cFirst Round provided a stunning level of support. From close contact with\nexperienced partners to the evidence-based approach to find PMF, this was a\nonce-in-a-lifetime experience and worth every second.\u201d\n\n### 04\n\nFounder and former CTO\n\n  * 05\n\n\u201cThe program gave me the tools and systems I needed to approach sales and\npositioning with confidence. But the real secret sauce is the personalized\ncoaching, analysis, and guided process introspection \u2014 we definitely closed\nmore deals because of this program.\u201d\n\n### 05\n\nFounder and former head of product\n\n## FAQ\n\nAny early founder working on a new B2B SaaS company is welcome to apply. Bonus\npoints if you\u2019re technical (have an engineering, product, or design\nbackground), have a clear product idea but are less than 12 months in to\nworking full time on your company, and haven\u2019t yet raised funding.\n\nMost of them are in person at the First Round office in San Francisco. The\ninitial three sessions will happen at a retreat in Sonoma County. You\u2019ll cover\nairfare/transportation (or can join a carpool). Once you\u2019re there, we\u2019ll cover\nall housing, food, and activity costs. A few things like office hours and pod\nmeetings may happen over Zoom.\n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve created a number of programs \u2014 from Angel Track to The\nReview \u2014 to share what we\u2019ve learned with the broader startup community.\nDespite all the talk about product-market fit, it didn\u2019t seem like anyone was\nmeaningfully putting the pieces together to help founders increase their odds\nof finding it. So we created PMF Method \u2014 and like Angel Track and The Review,\nit\u2019s totally free. By sharing this information with early stage founders, we\nget an inside look at some of tomorrow\u2019s great companies \u2014 and you get an\ninside look at First Round. We love a good win-win. There are absolutely no\nfinancial strings attached, but we\u2019re hoping some of us just might like each\nother.\n\nOur team will screen applications and interview founders who seem like they\ncould be a good fit for PMF Method. You\u2019ll be notified if you\u2019ve been selected\nto participate by May 15th.\n\nIt\u2019s completely free. If you\u2019re accepted, the only \u201ccost\u201d is your time (well,\nand getting yourself to the kickoff retreat in Sonoma County). PMF Method\nhelps super early founders discover what customers really want, build the\nright v1 product, and close your first sales \u2014 all while keeping 100% of your\ncompany\u2019s equity.\n\nTo get the most out of PMF Method, we strongly encourage you to participate in\nall sessions. If something comes up and you absolutely can\u2019t make one, we\u2019ll\nwork to catch you up. If you know you can\u2019t make more than one session, please\nlet us know and we\u2019ll keep you in mind for a future round of PMF Method and\nprioritize founders who can make it to all the sessions this time around.\n\nYes, please do! Referrals are the best. You can share this website with them\nand have them fill out the application.\n\nWe plan to run PMF Method repeatedly, but don\u2019t have additional dates to share\nquite yet. Be sure to follow First Round on X and LinkedIn where we\u2019ll\nannounce new sessions in the future.\n\n## applytoday\n\nSUMMER 2024: MAY 29TH -AUGUST 28TH APPLICATION DEADLINE: MAY 7TH\n\n## previewsession 01\n\nGET A SNEAK PEEK AT PMF METHOD.
