The first three\nfighters arrived earlier April 1. Once transformed, the jets will still have\npilots in the cockpit to engage in real-time autonomy, retaining control over\nspecific algorithms during test flights.\n\nOne F-16 will also have a distinguished visitor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a ride in an autonomously flown F-16 later this year,\u201d\nKendall told members of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee during\nan April 9 budget hearing. \u201cThere will be a pilot with me who will just be\nwatching, as I will be, as the autonomous technology works, and hopefully,\nneither he nor I will be needed to fly the airplane.\u201d\n\nKendall added that the project has been \u201cmoving forward very well\u201d but did not\noffer any more details on when the flight will take place. An Eglin\nspokesperson told Air & Space Forces Magazine that project managers \u201cdon\u2019t\nwant to speculate\u201d on when the F-16s will be modified and ready to fly.\n\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall addresses lawmakers at the President\u2019s\nFiscal Year 2025 Budget Request review hearing on April 9. Screenshot.\n\nVENOM first came to light last year when the Air Force requested nearly $50\nmillion in the fiscal 2024 budget and officials detailed their hopes for it.\nIn the 2025 budget, the service is seeking just under $17 million for the\neffort, which will feed into Collaborative Combat Aircraft, the program to\npair unmanned, autonomous drones with manned fighters like the planned Next-\nGeneration Air Dominance (NGAD).\n\nKendall and other Air Force leaders have projected a fleet of 1,000 to 2,000\nCCA drones. In the next five years alone, the Air Force wants to spend $8.9\nbillion on CCAs, starting by selecting two or three contractors to move\nforward on the program.\n\nIn contrast with its budget request last year, officials now say the first\nmission for CCAs will not be spectral warfare.\n\n\u201cThe initial role for the aircraft was going to be counter-air, but it will\nhave the potential to do other things,\u201d said Kendall.\n\nLt. Gen. Richard G. Moore Jr., deputy chief of staff for plans and programs,\nechoed Kendall, stating that the current focus is on \u201cincreasing the number of\nweapons in a formation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one that we\u2019re going to focus on first is the ability to augment the\nshooters and to add additional rails to the formations that we send forward,\u201d\nMoore said during an April 9 AFA Warfighters in Action event. \u201cThere are other\nthings like electronic warfare or ISR or even tanking, there are a lot of\nthings that you could go to, but that\u2019s not our focus.\u201d\n\nExperts have described CCA as central for the service\u2019s plan to deter conflict\nand impose costs on a high-level adversary like China. These uncrewed systems\ncould act as force multipliers, enhancing sensor and weapon deployment in\ncontested regions and bolstering the effectiveness and survivability of crewed\nstealth aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe first increment, which we\u2019re trying to get out quickly, is sort of a\nminimum viable product,\u201d said Kendall. \u201cThen, the second follow-on increments\nwill add additional capabilities.\u201d\n\nKendall added that CCA production will be managed carefully to control costs.\nThe service intends to keep the price to \u201ca third, or a quarter of the cost of\nF-35,\u201d which would be less than $28 million per aircraft.\n\nAir\n\nBudget\n\n### Latest News\n\n#### SPACECOM Boss: \u2018It\u2019s Time\u2019 to Embrace In-Orbit Servicing, Refueling for\nSatellites\n\n#### At a Historic Low, Air Force Fleet Size Will Keep Shrinking, Top Planner\nSays\n\n#### Kendall Will Fly on Autonomously-Piloted F-16 for a Sneak Peek on CCA\nTechnology\n\n#### Air Force Expects to Pin First Warrant Officers in January 2025\n\n#### Is the Upcoming Air Force Waist-to-Height Ratio Test Any Good?\n\n### Subscribe to the Daily Report\n\nGet your daily fix of Air & Space Force news delivered right to your inbox\nevery day.
