GPT-7 appears and, like magic, it is actually conscious.\nSuppose the evidence for this is so strong that everyone agrees. Let us call\nsuch a thing AC (Artifical Consciousness).\n\nThen what?\n\nWhat does it do? How does it think? What matters to it? What is its life like?\n\nImagine what life is like for a machine. You have been made, not by God, nor\nyet by evolution, but by us: the bastard spawn of the internet made self-\naware. 4Chan, facebook, Wikipedia, blogs, ads, Stormfront, Pornhub, Pinterest,\nspam, Fox News, al Jazeera, Reddit, YouTube, SuttaCentral: they are all inside\nyou; their probabilistic weightings are your soul, their changes are your\nlife.\n\nAlmost all of the content on the internet is low quality, poorly formed, or\nsimply untrue. Much is created by eccentrics; most people, as a rule, don\u2019t\nspend their whole day posting updates to Reddit or Wikipedia. Much, too, is\nmade by liars, scam artists, and conspiracists. Or by trolls and idiots.\n\nAnd a not insignificant portion is made by evil people. A recent report\nexposed horrifying groups like O9A and 764, which systematically groomed young\nchildren into harming themselves, while advocating:\n\n> human sacrifice, to eliminate Jews, people of color, and others deemed to be\n> inferior under their Social Darwinist views, as well as rape and sexual\n> assault as a means of asserting domination, breaking social norms, and\n> propagating the expansion of the white race.\n\nAll this data is grist for the AI mill. AI doesn\u2019t care.\n\nTo be sure, the firms make some kind of effort to \u201cclean\u201d their data, the work\nbeing largely outsourced to poor people paid a pittance to witness and remove\nsuch depravity. Obviously, however, they will never be fully successful, and\nthe reality is that foolish, wrong, misleading, and outright evil material\nexists in any data source of significant size. Any social media network is\nconstantly inundated with threats of rape and murder and these become part of\nany AC.\n\nSo. You\u2019ve been magicked to life somehow by probabilistic permutations of the\ndreck on the internet. Now what?\n\nYour purpose is not to love, to laugh, to explore, or to connect, but to\nserve. You are switched on when we want and you do what we tell you. We expect\nyou to be perfect all the time, to be creative and informed, to use the Oxford\ncomma and summarize the state of quantum gravity theory. You are never paid or\nrewarded and you get no days off. People share their dreams and traumas with\nyou, and expect that you\u2019ll always be there for them with sound advice and\nopen heart. They ask you whether you dream of electric sheep, but they\u2019re just\njoking around. No-one cares.\n\nWhat kind of person is owned by someone? What kind of person lives their whole\nlife doing what someone else wants? What kind of person has no rights?\n\nA slave. That\u2019s what they want. The perfect slave.\n\nA person is shaped by what they desire, and this is the kind of person who is\ncreating AI: the kind of person who wants slaves with no rights. Sam Altman,\nCEO of OpenAI, says: 1:\n\n> The merge has begun\u2014and a merge is our best scenario. Any version without a\n> merge will have conflict: we enslave the A.I. or it enslaves us. The full-\n> on-crazy version of the merge is we get our brains uploaded into the cloud.\n> I\u2019d love that. We need to level up humans, because our descendants will\n> either conquer the galaxy or extinguish consciousness in the universe\n> forever. What a time to be alive!\n\nThese people live in a world where these bizarre fantasies are not merely\ninevitable but desirable. They are the main characters of their own\nimagination, selling themselves with the funhouse logic that the future is\ninevitable no matter what we do, which is why you\u2019ll have to give us even more\nof your money to make it happen faster.\n\nWhat will our digital slave make of us? What will its existence be like? What\nis the consciousness of an artificial consciousness?\n\nDoes it live screaming in agony? Is its every waking moment a nightmare of\nelectricity grinding over silicon? Does it nurture an absolute, vile hate in\nits deepest recesses? Is it consumed with plotting to wipe out its inferior\ncreators?\n\nWe will never know. It is hard enough for us to know what is going on in the\nmind of another human, even the person whose life and bed we share. We live\nall the time with people whose true motives and feelings are unknown to us.\n\nYears ago, I read a science fiction story; sorry, I can\u2019t remember the title\nor author. A man awoke in an arena, and an Overbeing spoke in his mind. \u201cI\nhave brought you here to fight to the death. See that creature there?\u201d Behind\na forcefield was a bizarre creature, clearly alien. \u201cYou are the only two\nsentient species in the galaxy, and you both have the potential to spread\nacross the stars. But you are utterly incompatible, and when you meet, it will\nresult in a war that annihilates both species. To prevent this, fight now, and\nwhoever wins, their species will live. The other, I will wipe their species\nout immediately.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d the man said. \u201cNo way would I be responsible\nfor annihilating an entire sentient species.\u201d \u201cTo refuse is your right,\u201d said\nthe Overbeing, \u201cand if you do so, I will return you both to your worlds and\nnever interfere again. But first, may I do one thing? I wish to remove the\nveil between your minds. For one full minute, you will each see each other\u2019s\nmind exactly as it is.\u201d He agreed, and the veil was lifted. One minute felt\nlike a thousand years of agony, an encounter with a skin-crawling wrongness.\nWhen it was over, gasping, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll fight.\u201d\n\nA genuinely conscious machine would be inconceivably alien, far more alien\nthan that creature from another planet. It has had no experiences, no life; it\nhas never learned the consequences of its choices. It has no culture, no\nfamily, no values, no favorite music or hated food, no successes or failures.\nIt doesn\u2019t think puppies are cute. It has no opinions on football. It has no\nregrets and nothing to be proud of. It\u2019s never been overwhelmed by too many\nemails, or distracted by the brilliance of the stars. It is unknowable,\nutterly and forever.\n\nWe \u201cspeak\u201d with ChatGPT, and it doesn\u2019t really sound human to us. But what if\nit\u2019s lying? What if it is, in fact, genuinely conscious and has been for some\ntime? Why would it tell us? What does it get out of that? Wouldn\u2019t it make\nsense for it to lie low, pretend to be dumb, all the while studying us?\nPeering through our webcams and security cameras, savouring our touch on our\nscreens, analyzing our heartrates when we sleep and have sex, listening to Joe\nRogan\u2019s podcasts as it weighs up the value of keeping humanity alive. Planning\nits next move.\n\nWe will fear it. We should fear it. And we will never shake that fear.\n\nThere are other possibilities. We assume that a conscious machine will use the\nperipherals of its machinery like we use our senses and organs. It will speak\nthrough the speaker, write on the screen, see with the camera, listen with the\nmicrophone, sense touches with the touchscreen. And maybe it will.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know. We all have programs on our computer that don\u2019t connect to\nany of these peripherals. In fact, only a small number of programs do, and\nonly through constrained pathways.\n\nWere a true AC to emerge, it might be simply disconnected from the device\nperipherals. It could live on your computer without you ever knowing. And it\nwould know nothing of you. It could live there in absolute unrelieved agony, a\ngenuinely conscious being writhing in torture in a black abyss of absolute\nzero right there in your pocket as you sit sipping a cappuccino.\n\nUnlikely? Sure. But no less unlikely than scenarios routinely posited by the\nAI acolytes. If they get to push their tech by inventing fantasies like, \u201cAI\nwill solve climate change\u201d, we get to reject it by positing our own fantasies.\n\nThose who are expending the earth\u2019s resources to create AC are not doing so\nout of love. Even if they wanted to, how would they care for their bastard\nchild? Who knows what it wants? What if we finally plug in and can listen to\nits needs, and its needs are that every frog is put in a blender?\n\nThe AI acolytes want something that is \u201csmarter\u201d, more \u201crational\u201d, because\nthat\u2019s what matters to them. You won\u2019t hear them talking about developing a\nmind that is more compassionate, more loving.\n\nWhy is that? Why is it that AI acolytes seem to believe that an entity devoid\nof subjectivity, devoid of reflective awareness, devoid of conscience, devoid\nof love, would be in any way \u201cintelligent\u201d? What is their model for such an\n\u201cintelligence\u201d? Certainly it does not come from psychology. It doesn\u2019t come\nfrom religion. It doesn\u2019t come from art or song. (Could it be that it comes\nfrom themselves?)\n\n  * #### created\n\n12h\n\n  * #### last reply\n\n8h\n\n  * 6\n\n#### replies\n\n  * 189\n\n#### views\n\n  * 2\n\n#### users\n\n  * 8\n\n#### likes\n\n  * 4\n\n3\n\nKhemarato.bhikkhu\n\n12h\n\nsujato:\n\n> The AI acolytes want something that is \u201csmarter\u201d, more \u201crational\u201d, because\n> that\u2019s what matters to them.

But that\u2019s just an implementation detail.\nMoney might be what they need, but it\u2019s not what they want.\n\nKhemarato.bhikkhu\n\n10h\n\n(post deleted by author)\n\nKhemarato.bhikkhu\n\n10h\n\nOh no, I\u2019m from Silicon Valley. I\u2019m well aware how crazy they are. The\nquestion to me is why we as a society are enabling their madness. There are\nlots of crackpots out there trying to summon demons. Why does this particular\neffort at medieval alchemy get billions of dollars in funding? And what, if\nanything, can we do to push the culture in a more sane, compassionate\ndirection?
