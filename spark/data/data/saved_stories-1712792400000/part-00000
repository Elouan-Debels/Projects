This was absolutely fascinating to me. I strongly recommend\nchecking the episode out if you can. One of the many reasons it captivated me\nis the fact that John Siracusa uses macOS in only a single space (the system\u2019s\nname for virtual desktops) and lays out windows in a very specific way to take\nadvantage of his entire display.\n\nThis is completely opposite of the way I\u2019ve been managing and arranging\nwindows on my Mac for the past ten years. To work on my Mac, I always heavily\nrely on having at least three spaces and switching between them on the fly\ndepending on the task at hand. Moreover, I rarely keep more than two or three\nwindows open at a time in each space.\n\nHowever, since I\u2019m always up for an experiment and shaking things up, I\nthought I would try going back to a single space on my Mac for a full week. I\napproached this by drawing inspiration from John Siracusa\u2019s window management\ntechniques and digging up an old Mac utility that helped me with the\ntransition. I\u2019ve learned a lot from this challenge; even more surprisingly, it\nhas sparked in me a newfound interest in Stage Manager on the Mac.\n\nLet me tell you how it went.\n\nFirst, I should briefly catch you up on why I\u2019m such a big fan of spaces on\nmacOS.\n\nWhen I purchased my very first Mac about ten years ago, I was coming from many\nyears of using Linux distributions as my main desktop operating systems. At\nthe time, I was particularly fond of the GNOME desktop environment, which\nstarted featuring a radically-redesigned user interface in 2011 called GNOME\nShell. That UI had one huge appeal for me: an overview called \u2018Activities\u2019\nwhere you could see all your open windows and all your virtual desktops laid\nout in a bird\u2019s-eye view. Sound familiar? That same year, as part of Mac OS X\n10.7 Lion, Apple also introduced a similar UI paradigm called \u2018Mission\nControl\u2019, which lets you see all your open windows, fullscreen apps, and\nactive spaces in a single interactive overview.\n\nSo suffice it to say, after switching to a Mac, I was feeling right at home.\nGNOME had already engraved in my brain this habit of spreading my open windows\nacross virtual desktops and constantly moving between them thanks to its\nintuitive UI. On the Mac, Mission Control allowed me to keep working this way,\nand that has been the case for the past ten years now. The Mac even has a\nspecial advantage to bring this workflow together: an amazing trackpad\nexperience. To this day, nothing beats macOS\u2019s fast and fluid three-finger\nswipe gesture to flick between spaces on the fly.\n\nGNOME\u2019s \u2018Activities\u2019 view, released in 2011, allowed you to see an overview of\nall your open windows and virtual desktops. It also acted as a full-blown app\nlauncher.

As far back as I can remember, I have always arranged them in\nthis way:\n\n  * All of my messaging and communication apps go in Desktop 1.\n  * The web browser goes in Desktop 2.\n  * Music, plus everything else overflowing from the first two desktops, goes in Desktop 3.\n\nMy usual three-space setup. Communication apps live in Desktop 1, Safari in\nDesktop 2, and everything else in Desktop 3.\n\nWhile this is flexible and can change to fit specific tasks, the main constant\nis to always keep Safari in Desktop 2, and always keep my messaging apps in\nDesktop 1. They\u2019re my anchor windows. The only exception is when I\u2019m on a\ncall, in which case I usually bring Discord or Zoom to Desktop 2 to keep them\nside by side with Safari.\n\nOtherwise, when I\u2019m working on a document or researching something, I like to\nadd Notes or Obsidian to Desktop 2, next to Safari. Similarly, if I\u2019m working\non a design in Figma or a project in VS Code, that\u2019s going to happen in\nDesktop 2 where the browser is. And if, during any of those tasks, I need to\nreply to a message, I can just swipe on the trackpad with three fingers to\nswitch to Desktop 1 where all my communication apps live, then swipe back to\nDesktop 2 or 3 when I\u2019m done.\n\nNow you can probably see why getting rid of my spaces and using only one\ninstead might be a considerable challenge for someone like me.\n\nStill, I went ahead and deleted my two extra spaces. Now, with all my windows\nstacked in a single space, I had to experiment with ways to make this work \u2013\nand make sense of the apparent mess.\n\nAfter merging all of my spaces into one, my Mac desktop looked like this.\n\nAfter experimenting for the first couple days of my single-space challenge, I\nput together a collection of tricks that have allowed me to start enjoying\nthis experience. Here are the main three:\n\n1\\. Generously hide your apps. I must admit, since I could always just switch\nto a different space at any time, I was really not used to hiding windows when\nI wasn\u2019t actively using them. However, switching to a single-space workflow\nmade this a necessity if I didn\u2019t want my desktop to look extremely cluttered,\neven during light tasks. This led me to discover a handful of macOS keyboard\nshortcuts that have been around for ages but that I had no idea existed.\n\nOf course, Command (\u2318) + H hides the application in the foreground. But that\u2019s\nnot all. If you hold Option (\u2325) and click a window in the background, this\nwill instantly hide the app you were previously on. Even better, if you hold \u2325\nand \u2318 at the same time and click any window, this will hide all apps except\nfor the one you just clicked. Both of these also work if you click an app\u2019s\nicon in the Dock. Using these keyboard shortcuts has made a world of a\ndifference in managing my windows on a single desktop.\n\nCleaning up my desktop in a few seconds by holding \u2325 or \u2325 + \u2318 when clicking on\nwindows.\n\nDespite these useful shortcuts, I was still finding myself drowning in windows\nat times. This was mainly due to the fact that I frequently need to reopen\nDiscord and other messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, and I tend to\nleave those visible in the background even when I\u2019m done with them. To solve\nthis, I dug up a tiny utility that I hadn\u2019t launched in a long time: Quitter\nby Marco Arment.\n\nQuitter is a fantastic free Mac app that automatically hides or quits apps\nafter a set amount of time. I\u2019ve set it to hide all my messaging apps\nautomatically after 10 minutes of inactivity. The result is that they\u2019re still\nopen and active in the background if I need them, but their windows will go\naway even I forget to hide them manually.\n\nMy Quitter rules include most of my messaging apps.\n\n2\\. Find a pattern to arrange your windows onscreen. If this experiment has\ntaught me one thing, it\u2019s that you can make your life a lot easier if you\nplace and resize every window with intention, instead of just letting them\npile up wherever they spawn. Let me explain.\n\nIn my case, since the web browser is central to most, if not all, of my\nworkflows, I came up with a general way of organizing my windows onscreen that\nmakes a lot of sense to my brain: Now, I always keep the Safari window in the\ncenter of the screen, with every other window around Safari along the edges of\nthe display, as if they\u2019re only poking out from under the Safari window. I\nlike to think of it as an imperfect planetary system. Safari is Saturn, and\nall the other apps are its orbiting moons. Moon windows can move around Safari\nfreely, but Safari always remains in the center.\n\nAnd if, at any point, I need to focus on a single application, I can just \u2325 +\n\u2318 + click it to make it the only visible window, then temporarily move it to\nthe center of the screen.\n\nMaking sense of my single-space desktop: I keep Safari in the center and all\nthe other apps \u201cin orbit\u201d around it. To the left of Safari are Ivory and\nMimestream. Telegram is in the top right corner, Obsidian on the right side of\nthe screen, and Music in the bottom right.\n\nA key part of making this work is not being afraid to make your windows\nsmaller. Apps don\u2019t have to fill the entire screen to be useful. Some apps can\neven be super tiny and still be fully usable in a corner of the display. This\nis especially true for Safari and other web browsers. In a world where most\npeople access the web on their phones, most sites will work just fine in a\nnarrow window.\n\nThis has also led me to rediscover the Music app\u2019s MiniPlayer window, which\nyou can activate by clicking on the album art of the currently playing track.\n(You can also \u2325 + click the album art to open the MiniPlayer while keeping the\nmain window open.) The MiniPlayer is super easy to tuck in a corner of the\nscreen so you can keep an eye on your current queue at all times. This has\nbeen a nice way to curb my habit of always keeping the main Music window open.\n\nIn the Music app, click the currently playing album art to switch to the\nMiniPlayer, or \u2325 + click the album art to open the MiniPlayer above the main\nMusic window.\n\nMy Safari-focused \u201cplanetary system\u201d arrangement is obviously very personal,\nand it may or may not work for you. If you want to try this approach, I\nrecommend first thinking about which app would work best as your centered\nwindow.\n\n3\\. Give Stage Manager a try. Alright, this may be a controversial one. As you\nknow, Stage Manager, first introduced in macOS Ventura, is Apple\u2019s newest mode\nfor managing windows on your Mac\u2019s desktop. It lets you group windows together\nand lists your recently active apps on the left edge of the screen. To be\nhonest, despite loving some aspects of working with Stage Manager on the Mac,\nI think it still has many flaws I can\u2019t quite get over.\n\nStage Manager has felt superfluous to me since its release. After all, I was\nalready used to grouping my windows together; I was just doing it using\nmacOS\u2019s spaces. However, during my single-space challenge, I was inexorably\ndrawn back to it.\n\nStage Manager is an amazing way of eliminating clutter on your desktop with a\nsingle click in Control Center, and I found myself turning it on sporadically\ninstead of relying on my above two tricks for managing windows. In many cases,\nit was just simpler to use Stage Manager instead of thinking about where and\nhow I should place my apps. And I must admit, the way it positions your active\napp in the center of the screen while still letting you keep an eye on all the\nother apps that are running to the side \u2013 it clicks for me.\n\nOne other reason that I was drawn to Stage Manager during the single-space\nchallenge is that I had a really hard time kicking the habit of swiping with\nthree fingers to switch between spaces. I often found myself reflexively\nswiping with three fingers to no effect. To address this, I re-enabled one of\nmy BetterTouchTool triggers, which allows me to three-finger swipe between app\ngroups in Stage Manager.\n\nWith the addition of this gesture, Stage Manager is so close to being perfect.\nIf it had a setting to open new windows in the current stage instead of\nspawning a new one every time, and the ability to reorder the app groups in\nthe strip by dragging them, I would keep it on permanently. But for now, I\njust like to toggle it on and off depending on the state of my desktop.\n\nNow that my single-space challenge is over, I find myself at a crossroads. To\nmy surprise, this experiment has been quite enjoyable, and now I honestly\ncan\u2019t decide whether I want to continue this way or revert to my ten-year-old\nthree-space setup. The answer is that I\u2019m probably going to land somewhere in-\nbetween. I will keep using a three-space setup, but I will upgrade Desktop 2\n(the center space) to the Safari-focused \u201cplanetary system\u201d arrangement.\nSimilarly, I will consider turning on Stage Manager when one of my of spaces\ngets too crowded.\n\nOverall, this past week has made me realize how amazing macOS can be when it\ncomes to window management. While it is severely lacking in some areas,\nespecially when it comes to tiling and snapping windows, the fact that you can\npick and choose which layers of Apple\u2019s window management tools you want to\nleverage means that, in just a week, you can get used to a workflow that would\nhave felt completely alien before. There is a certain beauty to this. My only\nhope is that Apple finally iterates on Stage Manager this year.\n\nTags: macOS, Mission Control, Stage Manager\n\nJoin\n\n### Unlock More with Club MacStories\n\nFounded in 2015, Club MacStories has delivered exclusive content every week\nfor over six years.\n\nIn that time, members have enjoyed nearly 400 weekly and monthly newsletters\npacked with more of your favorite MacStories writing as well as Club-only\npodcasts, eBooks, discounts on apps, icons, and services.
