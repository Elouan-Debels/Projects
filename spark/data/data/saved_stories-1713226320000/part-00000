by CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 4% on Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely\nimportant to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and\nincreasing productivity,\u201d Musk said in the memo obtained by CNBC.\n\n\u201cAs part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization\nand made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10%\nglobally,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo was first reported by Electrek.\n\nTesla had 140,473 employees as of December 2023.\n\nTesla shares have taken a bruising in recent months, falling 31% year to date.\nWhile electric vehicle sales are still gaining popularity worldwide, their\nsales growth rate has slowed especially for Tesla. The company now faces more\ncompetition than ever.\n\nTo end 2023, China\u2019s BYD temporarily dethroned Tesla as the world\u2019s top EV\nmaker. Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi in March said it would sell its first\nelectric car for far less than Tesla\u2019s Model 3.\n\nMusk has previously recognized that China, home to a large Tesla factory, may\nalso house the company\u2019s strongest competition. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who\nare out there who think that the top 10 car companies are going to be Tesla\nfollowed by nine Chinese car companies. I think they might not be wrong,\u201d Musk\nsaid in November.\n\nSome would-be Tesla customers are now skipping the brand owing to Musk\u2019s\nincendiary rhetoric\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported its first annual decline in vehicle\ndeliveries since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted production\nextraneous of demand \u2014 first-quarter deliveries fell by 8.5% on the year to\n386,810 in the first quarter, with output down 1.7% from a year earlier and\n12.5% sequentially despite discounts and incentives offered to customers\nthroughout the quarter.\n\nMore recently, Tesla trimmed the subscription price of its premium driver\nassistance system, marketed as its Full Self-Driving or FSD option, for U.S.\ncustomers. The move was sharply at odds with Musk\u2019s previous pledges that the\nFSD fee would only bulk up as Tesla added features and functionality to the\nsystem. Despite the brand name, the system does not make Tesla vehicles self-\ndriving and requires a driver attentive to the road, ready to steer or brake\nat any time.\n\nBut the squeeze on the company\u2019s operating margin \u2014 which came in at 8.2% in\nthe fourth quarter, down from 16% a year earlier \u2014 remains, and Tesla has\nwarned investors to brace that vehicle volume growth this year \u201cmay be notably\nlower\u201d than the rate logged in 2023, saying it is \u201ccurrently between two major\ngrowth waves.\u201d\n\nLogistical challenges exacerbated Tesla\u2019s problems this year. The company\u2019s\ncomponent supply was a casualty of disruptions caused by Yemeni Houthi\nmaritime attacks in the Red Sea, while the automaker\u2019s gigafactory near Berlin\nwas forced to briefly suspend production due to suspected arson at a nearby\nelectricity substation.\n\nTesla is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results on April 23.\n\nHere\u2019s the full memo from Musk (transcribed by CNBC):\n\nOver the years, we have grown rapidly with multiple factories scaling around\nthe globe. With this rapid growth there has been duplication of roles and job\nfunctions in certain areas. As we prepare the company for our next phase of\ngrowth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for\ncost reductions and increasing productivity.\n\nAs part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and\nmade the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally.\nThere is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be\nlean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.\n\nI would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work over\nthe years. I\u2019m deeply grateful for your many contributions to our mission and\nwe wish you well in your future opportunities. It is very difficult to say\ngoodbye.\n\nFor those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult\njob that remains ahead. We are developing some of the most revolutionary\ntechnologies in auto, energy and artificial intelligence. As we prepare the\ncompany for the next phase of growth, your resolve will make a huge difference\nin getting us there.\n\nThanks, Elon\n\nCorrection: Tesla\u2019s operating margin came in at 8.2% in the fourth quarter,\ndown from 16% a year earlier.
