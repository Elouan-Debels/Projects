Some senior members of staff were\nquestioned for three days.\n\nThe government denied the raids were connected to the documentary, and were\npart of an investigation into the BBC violating India\u2019s strict rules on\nforeign investment, accusing them of not fully disclosing profits.\n\nThe BBC, which has had a presence in India since 1940, said it remained\ncommitted to producing content from India not only English but in its channels\nbroadcasting in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu.\n\nUnder the new structure, four former BBC employees have set up a private,\nIndian-owned company that will create content broadcast on the BBC\u2019s six\nregional language channels. It will employ about 200 staff who previously\ndirectly worked for the BBC\u2019s regional news channels in India.\n\nCollective Newsroom will also be able to make content for other Indian\nbroadcasters. It is unclear if it will have to comply with the same standards\nof impartiality imposed on all BBC programming.\n\nRupa Jha, chief executive of Collective Newsroom, described the new operation\nas an \u201cindependent news organisation that leads with the facts, works in the\npublic interest and hears from diverse voices and perspectives.\u201d\n\nJha said they had a \u201ca clear, ambitious mission to create the most credible,\ncreative and courageous journalism\u201d.\n\nNinety employees will remain in India directly employed by the BBC in the UK\nand reporting to editors in London. Their content produced from India will be\naccessible to Indian audiences through services such as the BBC world news\nchannel and BBC World Service radio but it will be published out of the UK\nheadquarters.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * BBC\n  * India\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
