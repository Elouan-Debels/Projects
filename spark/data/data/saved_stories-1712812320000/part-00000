By now, though, we know that algorithms can be just as biased\nas the human decision-makers they inform and replace.\n\nWhat if that weren't a bad thing?\n\nNew research by Carey Morewedge, a Boston University Questrom School of\nBusiness professor of marketing and Everett W. Lord Distinguished Faculty\nScholar, found that people recognize more of their biases in algorithms'\ndecisions than they do in their own\u2014even when those decisions are the same.\nThe research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences, suggests ways that awareness might help human decision-makers\nrecognize and correct for their biases.\n\n\"A social problem is that algorithms learn and, at scale, roll out biases in\nthe human decisions on which they were trained,\" says Morewedge, who also\nchairs Questrom's marketing department. For example: In 2015, Amazon tested\n(and soon scrapped) an algorithm to help its hiring managers filter through\njob applicants. They found that the program boosted r\u00e9sum\u00e9s it perceived to\ncome from male applicants, and downgraded those from female applicants, a\nclear case of gender bias.\n\nBut that same year, just 39 percent of Amazon's workforce were women. If the\nalgorithm had been trained on Amazon's existing hiring data, it's no wonder it\nprioritized male applicants\u2014Amazon already was. If its algorithm had a gender\nbias, \"it's because Amazon's managers were biased in their hiring decisions,\"\nMorewedge says.\n\n\"Algorithms can codify and amplify human bias, but algorithms also reveal\nstructural biases in our society,\" he says. \"Many biases cannot be observed at\nan individual level. It's hard to prove bias, for instance, in a single hiring\ndecision. But when we add up decisions within and across persons, as we do\nwhen building algorithms, it can reveal structural biases in our systems and\norganizations.\"\n\nMorewedge and his collaborators\u2014Beg\u00fcm \u00c7eliktutan and Romain Cadario, both at\nErasmus University in the Netherlands\u2014devised a series of experiments designed\nto tease out people's social biases (including racism, sexism, and ageism).\n\nThe team then compared research participants' recognition of how those biases\ncolored their own decisions versus decisions made by an algorithm. In the\nexperiments, participants sometimes saw the decisions of real algorithms. But\nthere was a catch: other times, the decisions attributed to algorithms were\nactually the participants' choices, in disguise.\n\nAcross the board, participants were more likely to see bias in the decisions\nthey thought came from algorithms than in their own decisions. Participants\nalso saw as much bias in the decisions of algorithms as they did in the\ndecisions of other people. (People generally better recognize bias in others\nthan in themselves, a phenomenon called the bias blind spot.) Participants\nwere also more likely to correct for bias in those decisions after the fact, a\ncrucial step for minimizing bias in the future.\n\n## Algorithms remove the bias blind spot\n\nThe researchers ran sets of participants, more than 6,000 in total, through\nnine experiments. In the first, participants rated a set of Airbnb listings,\nwhich included a few pieces of information about each listing: its average\nstar rating (on a scale of 1 to 5) and the host's name. The researchers\nassigned these fictional listings to hosts with names that were \"distinctively\nAfrican American or white,\" based on previous research identifying racial\nbias, according to the paper. The participants rated how likely they were to\nrent each listing.\n\nIn the second half of the experiment, participants were told about a research\nfinding that explained how the host's race might bias the ratings. Then, the\nresearchers showed participants a set of ratings and asked them to assess (on\na scale of 1 to 7) how likely it was that bias had influenced the ratings.\n\nParticipants saw either their own rating reflected back to them, their own\nrating under the guise of an algorithm's, their own rating under the guise of\nsomeone else's, or an actual algorithm rating based on their preferences.\n\nThe researchers repeated this setup several times, testing for race, gender,\nage, and attractiveness bias in the profiles of Lyft drivers and Airbnb hosts.\nEach time, the results were consistent. Participants who thought they saw an\nalgorithm's ratings or someone else's ratings (whether or not they actually\nwere) were more likely to perceive bias in the results.\n\nMorewedge attributes this to the different evidence we use to assess bias in\nothers and bias in ourselves. Since we have insight into our own thought\nprocess, he says, we're more likely to trace back through our thinking and\ndecide that it wasn't biased, perhaps driven by some other factor that went\ninto our decisions. When analyzing the decisions of other people, however, all\nwe have to judge is the outcome.\n\n\"Let's say you're organizing a panel of speakers for an event,\" Morewedge\nsays. \"If all those speakers are men, you might say that the outcome wasn't\nthe result of gender bias because you weren't even thinking about gender when\nyou invited these speakers. But if you were attending this event and saw a\npanel of all-male speakers, you're more likely to conclude that there was\ngender bias in the selection.\"\n\nIndeed, in one of their experiments, the researchers found that participants\nwho were more prone to this bias blind spot were also more likely to see bias\nin decisions attributed to algorithms or others than in their own decisions.\nIn another experiment, they discovered that people more easily saw their own\ndecisions influenced by factors that were fairly neutral or reasonable, such\nas an Airbnb host's star rating, compared to a prejudicial bias, such as\nrace\u2014perhaps because admitting to preferring a five-star rental isn't as\nthreatening to one's sense of self or how others might view us, Morewedge\nsuggests.\n\n## Algorithms as mirrors: Seeing and correcting human bias\n\nIn the researchers' final experiment, they gave participants a chance to\ncorrect bias in either their ratings or the ratings of an algorithm (real or\nnot). People were more likely to correct the algorithm's decisions, which\nreduced the actual bias in its ratings.\n\nThis is the crucial step for Morewedge and his colleagues, he says. For anyone\nmotivated to reduce bias, being able to see it is the first step. Their\nresearch presents evidence that algorithms can be used as mirrors\u2014a way to\nidentify bias even when people can't see it in themselves.\n\n\"Right now, I think the literature on algorithmic bias is bleak,\" Morewedge\nsays. \"A lot of it says that we need to develop statistical methods to reduce\nprejudice in algorithms. But part of the problem is that prejudice comes from\npeople. We should work to make algorithms better, but we should also work to\nmake ourselves less biased.\n\n\"What's exciting about this work is that it shows that algorithms can codify\nor amplify human bias, but algorithms can also be tools to help people better\nsee their own biases and correct them,\" he says. \"Algorithms are a double-\nedged sword. They can be a tool that amplifies our worst tendencies. And\nalgorithms can be a tool that can help better ourselves.\"\n\nMore information: Carey K.
