Recently, the push for digital\ntransformation is usually induced by the furor surrounding emerging\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, big data,\nand blockchain.\n\nWith the hype around the emerging tech, many organizations, perhaps due to\nfear of missing out, are racing to transform their business to be \"digital\".\nBut what does that mean? If it's about adopting digital technology, we've had\na track record of that going back to a few decades ago. (The first digital\nalarm clock was first patented in 1956.)\n\nThanks for reading Amirul\u2019s Substack! Subscribe for free to receive new posts\nand support my work.\n\nFrom experience, when people talk about going digital, they usually mean\nadopting emerging technologies to realize its lofty promises: that big data\nand data analytics enable data-driven business decisions, and in some way or\nanother, AI is a silver bullet that can solve an organization's myriad\nproblems.\n\nOf course, the promises of big data and AI are real. However, they have led\nsome organizations to develop a lackadaisical strategy for digital\ntransformation. Decisions for digital transformation are mostly pivoted around\nthe procurement of emerging technologies, rather than by reimagining the\noperating system of the business and changing the ways of working; that is,\ntransforming the business operating model.\n\nThis is unfortunate. Digitalization should be an enabler and offer\nopportunities for lifestyle change instead of a mere leap in the technology\nbeing used. To do otherwise is to only assume the appearance of a smart\norganization. A masquerade.\n\n#\n\nMasquerading Digitalization with Digitization\n\nSimply carrying out a mere transition from paper to its digital forms (e.g.,\nPDF documents, image files, etc.) does not imply digitalization. Here's an\nexample.\n\nThere are a few local restaurants that I've personally experienced where their\neffort to digitalize backfires miserably, to the point where it would have\nbeen much easier to order the menu without the digital technology.\n\nThere's no longer any physical menu placed on the counter or the dining table.\nQR code stickers, however, are conspicuously glued onto each table. When\nscanned, it would lead to a shared Google Photos link containing the images of\nthe restaurant menu. With a bad cellular connection, it would take a while for\nthe thumbnails of the images to load at their full quality. There was quite a\nnumber of images; one image for each page. After a few swipes left and right\nor scrolling up and down the list of images, it can take a while to read most\nof the menus to find what I'm looking for before I can finalize my order.\n\nIn the end, replacing physical menus with digital copies does not make\ndiscovering (and re-discovering) menus easier. The overall experience turned\nout to be frustrating. To make things worse, everyone can see who has visited\nthe shared Google Photos link.\n\nClearly, whoever decided to replace the physical menu with digital pictures\nmuddled digitization for digitalization. Lifting and shifting your physical\ncopies of data into a digital landscape does not make your organization\ndigital. In fact, the meaning of digital transformation is evolving, with more\nthan 72% of industry leaders viewing digitalization as much more than lift-\nand-shift.\n\nTo give them the benefit of the doubt, for all I know, the restaurants were\njust trying to save some paper, albeit at the cost of a somewhat disappointing\ncustomer experience. But some of the worst offenders yet are those who lauded\nand coveted digitalization the most: Enterprise IT.\n\n#\n\nMasquerading Digitalization with Emerging Technology\n\nMigrating to the cloud is a no-brainer when organizations decide to \"go\ndigital\". The cloud had risen in favor over on-premise infrastructure for more\nthan a decade since Amazon first revealed a unique business model at the time,\nstemming from an idea -- a multi-billion dollar idea1 -- that their existing\ncompute and storage infrastructure can be offered as a service, with great\nagility and scalability.\n\nAccording to a 2023 cloud adoption statistics by Zippia, 61% of businesses\nmigrated their workloads to the cloud in 2020, although the share of workflows\non the cloud is quite low, at only 25%, according to The Economist.\n\nIn Brunei, a 2019 report by the Authority for Info-communications Technology\n(AITI), a statutory body that focuses on the development of IT in Brunei,\nshowed that most IT services infrastructure (e.g., data analytic tools,\nbusiness process automation, HR management system, etc.) are on-premise2, with\nless than 5% cloud adoption for each sector. That was five years ago.\n(Unfortunately, I couldn't find recent reports on cloud adoption in Brunei.)\n\nNevertheless, over the past few years, signs for cloud adoptions by local\nbusinesses are increasingly popping up, such as the adoption of AWS Managed\nServices by Datastream Digital Sdn Bhd (DST) and Progresif's partnership with\nAlibaba Cloud. Brunei's Digital Economy Masterplan 2025 by the Digital Economy\nCouncil (DEC) even mentioned \"Public Cloud Adoption\" as part of its key\nprojects in 2021, among other digital transformation initiatives.\n\nIt is all the more important, then, to understand what it really takes for an\norganization, especially those already operating for decades with the support\nof Enterprise IT to undergo digital transformation.\n\nMany Enterprise IT are prone to hold on to their long-held traditions. Most\nare unable to forgo IT processes and operational culture that are already\nwell-established and deeply entrenched in their organization. The processes\nare followed almost down to a dogmatic level, in the name of minimizing risks\nand ensuring stability and reliability.\n\nThe typical tradition includes loathsome bureaucratic IT processes. They are\nthe manual and tedious checks and balances organically injected at almost\nevery step of the value streams throughout the organization's lifetime, thanks\nto the learnings from past incidents and failures. In other words, they're the\norganization's counter-responses to past disappointments, which,\nunfortunately, end up introducing waste in the organization's value streams.\nFittingly, in the DevOps community, they are referred to as \"scar tissues\".\n\nTraditional change management processes are one example of scar tissue, where\neach \"normal\" change requires a lengthy process of approvals, careful planning\nand coordination, and manual testing and deployment methods. To make things\nworse, these are usually exacerbated by the lack of cooperation between teams\nin organizations that suffers the symptoms of organizational silos.\n\nOrganizational silos are the defining feature of traditional IT, where teams\nare locally optimized, but end-to-end cross-team value delivery are not. Thus,\nworks that require cross-team collaborations are impeded due to friction. The\nexistence of the friction is easy to explain from economic standpoint: the\nbuilders (e.g., software engineers, data engineers, data scientists) are\nincentivized by making more changes or adding more features in response to the\nchanging business needs, whereas the infrastructure team and the support team\nare disincentivized because they want to keep the software reliable and easy\nto support (by the virtue of less frequent changes and fewer features to\nsupport). As economists are wont to say, our actions are driven by incentives.\nWhen the incentives are not aligned, you get friction.\n\nWithout fixing the organization's processes and organizational structure,\nwhatever fancy technology the organization is trying to adopt will go to\nwaste. Suppose you have set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery\npipelines (CI/CD) which automatically run unit tests and integration tests\nagainst your application each time a change is made to your code in your\nversion control repository. Suppose also that you've painstakingly written\nsome custom scripts to allow an application custodian to pick a snapshot\nversion of the application to be automatically deployed to the production\nenvironment. If your organization still fanatically follows a traditional\nchange management process -- the likes that require approvals across multiple\nstages and require you to fill in numerous forms -- the value proposition of\nthe continuous property made available by the CI/CD pipelines will be\ndiminished. In short, the inherent culture of dogmatism and fanaticism for\ntraditional ways of working inhibits digital transformation from squeezing out\nits maximal value outcome.\n\nUnderstanding the implication of this masquerade, as described above, is\nparamount for successful digital transformation. In the effort to transform an\norganization to be digital, it would be neglectful to be obsessed with the\nprocurement and implementation of emerging technologies without expending more\nenergy and resources on transforming their people and the operating model\nthey're clinging to.\n\n#\n\nSeeing Through the Masquerade\n\nMixing emerging technology with traditional IT culture is a recipe for\ndisaster. As Gregor Hohpe, an Enterprise Strategist at Amazon Web Services\nwrote in his book Cloud Strategy:\n\n> If you don't know how to drive, buying a faster car is the worst thing you\n> can do.\n\nViral videos online showing amateur drivers driving recklessly and crashing\ntheir cars are all too common. Its dour consequences are obvious; and, grim as\nthey may be, they serve as effective reminders and warnings to other drivers.\n\nOrganizations driving the digitalization vehicle do not normally have this\nluxury. Instead, digitalization mishaps are difficult to notice: We're using\nthe cloud now, we're digital!, or We're using Docker to do the deployment! are\njust fanciful masquerades if symptoms of organizational silos are still\nrampant across the organization, or deliverables take months before they can\nbe deployed and realized.\n\nFor digitalization strategy and execution to be successful, it is paramount\nthat everyone across all levels in the organization can see through the\nmasquerades and understand the desired outcome of digitalization for the\norganization that maximizes its business value.\n\nThank you for reading Amirul\u2019s Substack.
