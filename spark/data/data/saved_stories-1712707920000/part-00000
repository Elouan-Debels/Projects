After 55 years, Small Press Distribution (SPD)\u2014one of the\nlast remaining independent book distributors in the US\u2014was shutting down\nimmediately, with no advance notice or transitional support. Its website went\ndark, its Twitter account was deleted, and no one was answering calls.\n\n\u201cThe small press world is about to fall apart,\u201d Goettel remembers thinking.\nShe\u2019s the executive editor of Black Lawrence Press, one of more than 400\npublishers that relied on SPD to fulfill online orders and make copies\navailable to bookstores and libraries. \u201cA lot of people are really angry,\u201d\nGoettel says. \u201cI\u2019m a little angry myself, but mostly I\u2019m sad about the loss of\nthis organization, and afraid of what it means.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the country, the executive editor of Noemi Press, Sarah\nGzemski, was about to hop on a Zoom for her day job at the University of\nArizona Poetry Center in Tucson when she received a text about SPD. \u201cWe were\nshocked, [though] some of the fulfillment issues we encountered over the past\nfew months began to make more sense,\u201d Gzemski says. \u201cWe\u2019re already working on\nshoestring budgets, so for our distributor to close abruptly, without warning,\nwhile not paying us our earned income, is devastating.\u201d\n\nDistributors are perhaps the most opaque and byzantine part of the publishing\nindustry. When you buy a book on Amazon or Bookshop.org, it\u2019s usually the\ndistributor\u2014not the publisher\u2014who ships you a copy from its warehouse. When\nbookstores, libraries, and schools order books for their brick-and-mortar\nlocations, they use online catalogs populated by distributors. Even further,\nmost distributors (including SPD, before it vanished) employ sales teams that\nwork to get copies in Barnes & Noble, independent bookstores, and other retail\noutlets like gift shops.\n\nWithout a distributor, presses like Black Lawrence and Noemi are completely\ncut off from their main sources of income\u2014and for some, SPD might have been\nthe only affordable option left.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where else these presses can go,\u201d says Meg Reid, executive\ndirector of the Hub City Writers Project in Spartanburg, SC. \u201cLarger\ndistributors are going to have sales minimums that might not be financially\nviable, and self-distribution basically takes them out of the system in terms\nof getting reviewed in major publications or public radio.\u201d\n\nReid\u2019s publishing imprint, Hub City Press, is distributed by Publishers Group\nWest, a once-independent distributor that was acquired by Ingram in 2016.\nBased just outside of Nashville, Ingram is the largest book wholesaler and\ndistributor in the US, with more than 17 million titles available (Ingram is a\nsponsor of Literary Hub). In its email to publishers last week, SPD said all\nof its 300,000 books had been transferred to either Ingram or Publishers\nStorage and Shipping (PSSC) warehouses\u2014but that publishers would have to\ncontact Ingram or PSSC themselves to get their books back.\n\nRight now, the future is extremely uncertain for SPD\u2019s former small\npresses\u2014but they\u2019re adapting as quickly as they can.\n\nTo make matters worse, many small presses say SPD owes them money. \u201cWe\u2019re owed\nupwards of $8,000,\u201d says Gzemski. \u201cWe just released three books [at Noemi],\nand all of the preorder and event order revenue from those books has\ndisappeared. This is an enormous loss for us that impacts how we\u2019ll need to\nproceed moving forward.\u201d\n\nBack on the east coast, Goettel says SPD owes Black Lawrence Press more than\n$17,000\u2014an enormous sum for a small press. \u201cIt could be devastating. I don\u2019t\nknow what will happen if we don\u2019t receive those funds,\u201d she says. In the\nmeantime, Black Lawrence Press has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help.\n\nAs of this week, it\u2019s unclear when or whether SPD will be able to pay its\npresses back. \u201cAs a California nonprofit, SPD\u2019s dissolution will be overseen\nby the Superior Court of California, which will determine the equitable\ndisposition of SPD\u2019s remaining assets to the extent all claims from creditors\ncannot be satisfied,\u201d SPD executive director Kent Watson wrote in his sudden\nemail on March 28.\n\nHowever, \u201cit\u2019s difficult to say what remaining assets exist,\u201d according to\nMary Gannon, executive director of the Community of Literary Magazines &\nPresses (CLMP), many members of which were distributed by SPD. \u201cHaving to\nsubmit claims and figure out what may or may not be owed puts a significant\nburden on these small operations, especially when we\u2019ve heard from some\npresses that they no longer have access to sales reports,\u201d Gannon says.\n\u201cAdditionally, any presses that want their books returned from either Ingram\nor PSSC will need to pay for shipping, [which is] an additional cost.\u201d\n\nI contacted Kent Watson at SPD to ask several questions for this story, but\ndidn\u2019t receive a response before publication. Gannon, Gzemski, and Goettel\nhave also attempted to contact Watson, with no response. In his mass email,\nWatson said that SPD staff had been \u201creduced to a minimal team that is in the\nprocess of winding down operations\u201d and that they \u201care not able to respond to\nindividual queries.\u201d\n\nRight now, the future is extremely uncertain for SPD\u2019s former small\npresses\u2014but they\u2019re adapting as quickly as they can. On an emergency Zoom call\norganized by the CLMP the day after the news broke, representatives from two\nalternative distributors answered questions from publishers: Bookmobile, a\nMinneapolis-based company long known for its beautiful typesetting and\nprinting services, and Asterism, a newer company founded in 2021 by Joshua\nRothes, publisher of his own small press in Seattle, Sublunary Editions.\n\n\u201cI was distributed by SPD for about a year until the troubling allegations\nabout the working environment came to light, which, coupled with the abysmal\nbusiness terms, made for an easy decision to try something different,\u201d Rothes\ntells me. He\u2019s referring to an essay published by a former SPD employee, as\nwell as further reports in 2021 that accused SPD of fostering a toxic\nworkplace and poor labor conditions, as well as \u201cfinancial issues and\nmismanagement.\u201d\n\nOn the CLMP\u2019s emergency Zoom, some presses were bullish on Asterism thanks to\nits low costs. But unlike Bookmobile and most other distributors, Asterism\ndoesn\u2019t currently offer returns to retailers, which leaves bookstores on the\nhook for any copies they ordered but didn\u2019t sell.\n\n\u201cOur returns policy has raised a few eyebrows, but I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve met\nfierce resistance over it,\u201d Rothes says. \u201cWe compromised with bookstores on\nevent orders, [more] than 200 bookstores have signed up for accounts with\nAsterism so far, and it seems booksellers are generally happy to order fewer\ncopies of more titles, and re-order when they need to.\u201d\n\nAsterism also doesn\u2019t currently distribute to Amazon, a major source of income\nfor many small presses who see it as a necessary evil. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell into\nmarketplaces that routinely discount titles below what booksellers can sell\nthem for,\u201d Rothes says, \u201cbut we\u2019re not exclusive and don\u2019t demand control over\nall of our publishers\u2019 sales channels. Publishers can and do manage their own\nAmazon seller accounts, or take advantage of the integration options through\nprint-on-demand services.\u201d\n\nStill, Rothes says Asterism will continue listening to what small presses\nneed: \u201cWe\u2019ll absolutely maintain a dialogue with both booksellers and\npublishers, old and new, to determine when we might need to compromise or\nchange course.\u201d\n\nThe CLMP says they\u2019re exploring even more options in addition to Ingram, which\ncould be prohibitively expensive, and Bookmobile or Asterism, which might be\nmore affordable. \u201cIf they have the bandwidth, these presses can also sell\ntheir books directly to consumers, but the problem is discoverability,\u201d Gannon\nsays, echoing Meg Reid. \u201cThis is a devastating and sudden turn of events, [but\nthose presses are] distinguished by their innovation and resilience.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoemi is exploring all of our options right now,\u201d says Gzemski. \u201cI feel some\ncomfort that we\u2019re in the same boat as everyone else, and rushing into a new\ndistributor without the proper research will not serve us well.\u201d\n\nGoettel is optimistic about Black Lawrence Press, but anxious about the\nsituation more broadly. \u201cI\u2019m not panicking at this point, but I would not be\nsurprised if some small presses completely close because of this.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the CLMP is planning on holding future Zooms with Ingram and\nIndependent Publishers Group (IPG), an international distributor based in\nChicago with more than 1,000 publishers, including its own parent company,\nChicago Review Press, which acquired IPG in 1987.\n\n\u201cThe contributions these small presses make is essential to writers, readers,\nand literature in our country,\u201d says Gannon. \u201cThey\u2019re in the business because\nof their dedication to publishing the work of writers who would otherwise not\nhave a home for their work. [The CLMP is] going to do everything we can to\nsupport them and find more robust solutions to make their books available.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to help the small presses impacted by SPD\u2019s sudden closure, you\ncan purchase books directly from their websites, and/or donate funds if\nthey\u2019re nonprofits like Noemi Press, Rose Metal Press, Fence, and The Song\nCave. Here\u2019s a full list of presses that were distributed by SPD as of January\n2024, courtesy of the CLMP.\n\nAdam MorganBlack LawrenceCLMPDiane GoetteldistributionIngramMary\nGannonNoemiSarah GzemskiSmall Press Distributionsmall pressesSPD\n\nShare:\n\n  * Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n###### Adam Morgan\n\nAdam Morgan is a culture journalist and critic whose work appears in Esquire,\nInverse, and elsewhere.
