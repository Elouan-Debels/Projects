So as not to keep you in suspense (if you haven't\nalready heard about it), here is the bad news in a nutshell:\n\nAll Polaroid film products (including all formats of instant film) will be\nphased out by the end of 2009.\n\nYes, this includes all formats, from 600 integral film to 660-series peel-\napart films, to 50-series 4x5 films-- all of them will be discontinued by the\nend of 2009. For more details, you can find a number of news items about it\nvia Google News (for example), but here's a link to a Bloomberg news article:\nPolaroid to Exit Instant Film as Demand Goes Digital\n\nNow, while this is certainly bad news to Polaroid fanciers, there are a few\nrays of hope that you should keep in mind: - First: Don't forget that Fuji\nmakes a line of Polaroid-compatible packfilms, so I'd assume those will still\nbe in production. The Fuji instant films have generally had very limited\ndistribution in the USA, but with Polaroid leaving the film market, one would\nsuspect that this will improve. - Second: In the meantime, Polaroid is\nactively trying to find a licensee to take over the production of instant film\nproducts, so it's quite possible that production of Polaroid film will\ncontinue under a new company.\n\nWhat's New (01/17/2008): Hey Hey Hey! I finally started doing some updates on\nthe site! Yeah, yeah, I've said that before, but this time it may actually\nhappen. I'm sure some of you out there will be glad to know that I finally\nupdated the Film page to reflect all the films that have been discontinued the\npast few years. (There may be more of those still to update as far as that\ngoes). Soon, I'll get the FAQ page updated with some new (and updated)\ncontent. I've also got some camera info updates in the works. Hmm. While\nwriting this, I realized that The Land List will be turning 15 this year. A\nlot has happened in the photographic industry in general the past 15 years.\nPolaroid Corp in particular has had a lot of ups and downs-- well, perhaps a\nfew ups and a *lot* of downs. We've seen the incredibly rapid growth and\nmaturity of digital photography-- what had been primarily seen as an expensive\ntoy for most people has become the mainstay of the camera industry. On that\nnote, I've started putting together a new section regarding early Polaroid\ndigital cameras. Digital photography seems to have become almost a forgotten\npart of Polaroid's product development history. As many of you know, for the\npast several years, all of the Polaroid-branded digital cameras (and other\nconsumer electronics) you've seen in stores have actually been produced under\na trademark licensing arrangment-- Polaroid Corp itself really hasn't had much\n(if anything) to do with the actual product designs or even their marketing.\nHowever, in the 1990's, Polaroid was actively involved in the development of\ndigital photography, and some of the cameras they produced were actually\nfairly interesting for their time. For whatever reason, Polaroid Corp had a\nlot of trouble making a corporate transition to the digital era. So, while\nKodak and Fuji have managed to survive in this new era of photography,\nPolaroid never really got there. ...However, as some of you know, some news\nlast year indicated that one of the 'old' Polaroid Corp's last such\ndevelopment projects may be coming back to life and finally reach the\nmarketplace. Back then, Polaroid was developing a new inkless themal-based\ncolor printing technology that they code-named \"Opal\" (along with a monochrome\nversion called \"Onyx\"). Opal never quite made it into a product-- the closest\nI saw was a press release some years ago regarding a photo booth vending\nmachine, but I don't know if it actually made it to market. Now the Opal\nprocess has been ressurrected under a spin-off company called \"Zink\". They\nannounced and demonstrated a pocket-sized mini photo printer last year. Will\nwe actually see it? I suppose time will tell..!\n\nWhat's New (02/28/2007): I've updated this page again to bring you two\nentirely unrelated Polaroid film news reports. I've got some good news and\nsome bad news. Which do you want first? Let's go with the good news first:\n\nSX-70 film is back?! Really?? Well, sort of. As many of you already know (and\nif you don't, check the previous few \"What's New\" items), Polaroid\ndiscontinued SX-70 Time-Zero film last year. However, apparently not everyone\ntook that sad news sitting down. Indeed, some SX-70 fans decided to take\nmatters into their own hands, and approached Polaroid Europe to produce a\n'special' run of 600 film with a custom-altered emulsion designed to mimic the\ncolor balance and contrast of SX-70 Time-Zero film. The film is called SX-70\nBlend film, and is available through Polanoid / Unsaleable (Europe and\nworldwide) and Lord of The Lens (USA) NOTE: I have no affiliation with either\nof these parties, nor have I actually used this product (at this time at\nleast); I'm providing this general information just because it may be of\ninterest to other Polaroid camera fans. Please use the contact info found on\nthose sites if you have more questions about this product or availablity. Here\nare a few bits of general information that I am aware of and should help\nanswer some basic questions that I'm sure you're asking yourself now (just as\nI was): Q: Can I do SX-70 photomanipulations with this new SX-70 Blend film?\nA: No. It's based on 600 film, and so shares the same lack of mallebility. Q:\nDo I have to make any modifications to my SX-70 camera to use this film? A:\nNo. It doesn't require any changes to the camera, nor does it require any\nextra filters or other accessories. It's designed to be ready to use in any\nSX-70 camera. The film cartridge is SX-70 style, so you don't need to cut off\nany plastic tabs or use any cartridge loading tricks (like you usually need to\ndo when using 600 film in a modified SX-70 camera). However, since the film is\nbased on 600 film, the film itself has the same film speed-- ISO/ASA 600. To\ncompensate for this, the film cartridge has a built-in neutral density (ND)\nfilter to reduce the 'effective' speed to be like SX-70 film. Q: Wait-- does\nthat mean I could remove the ND filter and use this film in a 600 camera if I\nwanted? A: Hey, I'd imagine you could. Perhaps I'll ask if anyone's done that.\nQ: So, what's the deal?? Isn't this just regular 600 film in a custom package\nwith an 2-stop ND filter stuck in in the film cartridge opening? A: No, not\nexactly. I don't know all the details, but I have confirmed with Lord of the\nLens that it does indeed have a different chemistry than regular 600 film.\nThere are some sample photos on the above web sites that illustrate the\ndifferences in color response and contrast between 600 film, the new SX-70\nBlend film, and the old SX-70 Time-Zero film. In general, SX-70 Blend film has\nhigher contrast and an emphasized blue range similar (but not identical) to\nthat of the old SX-70 T-Z film. So if you really like the SX-70 \"look,\" and\ndon't care about photomanipulations, this may be a good product for you. Q:\nCan't I buy this SX-70 Blend film from Polaroid directly or through my local\ncamera dealer? I don't even see this film on Polaroid's web site. A: This film\nwas made by Polaroid Corp, yes, but it was a custom run made specifically for\n(and financed by) the folks at Polanoid.net (note the spelling!) and so is not\na regular Polaroid catalog product. I might also speculate that as such,\nPolanoid and Lord of the Lens are almost certainly taking a significant\nfinancial risk on this venture, so I wish them best of luck in this project.\nAnyway, it's an interesting product idea, and it's nice to see that there are\nenough motivated Polaroid SX-70 fans out there that such a product even could\nbe possible. [ Hmm... Perhaps I really should approach Polaroid about making a\ncustom run of Type 47 or 42 film... :-) ]\n\nI did mention that there were two news items, right? Now for the bad news: A\nSad Day For 'Squares': Just three short years after its \"re-introduction,\" it\nappears that the 80-series 'square' packfilm format is going away again, this\ntime for good. I hadn't even noticed until a reader pointed it out to me\ntoday; indeed, it has already happened-- as the Polaroid web site points out,\nthe 80-series films are all being discontinued \"within the last 3 months of\n2006\", so if you want to stock up on some 80-series film, you better get it\nnow while you still can... I guess Square Shooters never win after all. :-/\n\n>>In other news, assuming you're still reading this stuff: I'll probably\nregret this, but now I'm going to link to a page for an unrelated 'project'\npage I originally wrote a few years ago but never before put up for public\nconsumption. It's called The Adventures of Grammar Repairman. This really\nstarted as a sort of private joke. Every so often, I encounter something\nonline that is just *riddled* with glaring grammatical errors, but is\notherwise fairly well thought out. [Of course, you're probably thinking the\nsame about this very web site. Or at least the first part of that sentence.]\nAnyway, check it out if you dare or care. I'm kinda wondering how long it will\ntake for someone to find some embarrassing grammatical errors on that page.\n\nWhat's New (01/18/2005): Another Polaroid news bulletin: As several observant\nvisitors to this site have emailed me (and I keep forgetting to post up here),\nSX-70 Time Zero isn't the only Polaroid film product now heading for the\nchopping block. According to the Polaroid web site, Type 665 film will be\ndiscontinued \"within the first 6 months of 2006 due to the phasing out of\ncomponents used in this film.\" Not surprisingly, its 'square'-format brother,\nType 85, will be gone as well (unfortunate, since Type 85 was introduced\nscarcely two years ago). What is surprising, however, is that Type 55 (the 4x5\nsheet-film version of this film) will still be in production. ...Which seems\nrather curious, since Type 55 is essentially the same film in a different\nformat, yet Type 665 is supposedly being discontinued because its material\ncomponents are being phased out. So, who knows what's really up with that.\nAnyway, for those of you out there who are fans of Type 665 (and its nifty\nability to produce high-quality instant negatives), you might want to stock up\nyour refrigerator before it's too late. Fortunately, Polaroid B&W film keeps\nparticularly well in the refrigerator, and should still be perfectly usable\nyears in the future. Since Type 55 will still be around (at least for now!),\nthat's also a viable option. Of course, if you don't already have a 4x5 camera\n(and Polaroid 4x5 film holder), that means you'd have to invest in some new\nequipment. I'll elaborate on this topic if there's interest, but if you're\nlooking for an easiest-and-cheapest solution, your best option is probably to\nfind yourself an old 4x5 press camera (such as a 4x5-format Speed Graphic /\nCrown Graphic, or B&J Press) and a used Polaroid #500 or #545 film holder.\n(See my FAQ page for an important caevat about the #500 holder though!) I also\nknow that some folks have converted old Polaroid Pathfinders to accept 4x5\nbacks, so that's another option.\n\nWhat's New (10/12/2005): My stack of \"Updates I Should Make\" for this site\nkeeps growing, and someday I hope to get around to it. :-) However, today I\nlearned of some news related to the world of Polaroid that I felt was\nimportant enough that it should be put up here in as timely a manner as\npossible. If you're a fan of Time-Zero film and/or SX-70 cameras in general,\nbe sure to read the announcment currently found on the Polaroid Corp. web site\nat: http://www.polaroid.com/sx70 Following is the main part of the English\nversion of the notice: \"Please be advised that Polaroid will be discontinuing\nthe manufacture of its SX-70 / Time-Zero film within the first 3 months of\n2006 due to the phasing out of components used in the production of this film.\nWe realise that this is disappointing news for our loyal SX-70 users and we\nwould like to underline that, although the circumstances made it inevitable,\nit was not an easy decision. We are very sorry for the inconvenience.\" :-(\nWell, I know that a lot of SX-70 artists aren't going to be happy about that.\nSure, there are ways of using 600 film in an SX-70 camera (some are even\noutlined the Polaroid.com web page accompanying the announcement), but that's\nnot going to be a viable solution for many people. I do wonder if Time-Zero\nfilm would have been discontinued long ago if wasn't for the evolution of\n'photo-manipulation' techniques that photographers and other artists devised\naround the distinct characteristics of this film. Interestingly, the same\nmallability that transformed Time-Zero film into a hand-craftable art medium\nwas originally considered by Polaroid to be one of this film's deficiencies--\nan engineering problem that was finally solved with the research and\ndevelopment that went into 600 film. Then again, to borrow a couple of common\nmaxims: \"One man's meat is another man's poison\" -and- \"That's not a bug,\nthat's a feature!\"\n\nWhat's New (09/10/2004): Actually, there's not a lot new here right now\n(though the FAQ has a few updates), but I figured I'd plug a future project\nwhile it's still timely. (drum-roll) First, there was The Land List. Then came\nIn Living Portacolor. Now, coming soon to the Whirled is yet-another product-\nspecific virtual museum-- The Radaranger Lookout Post! Right now, it's just a\nplaceholder page illustrating the preparation of corn-on-the-cob ala Amana\nRadarange. Bon apetit! If that weren't enough, other Whirled projects you\nmight see at some point in the vague future include... Phonografun: A\ncollection of odd (and not-so-odd) novelty phonographs. For example, one of\nthe items in this picture is actually a phonograph designed to play full-size\n45s or LPs (though does so very badly). Can you guess which one? Classic\nComputer Battle! Canon Cat vs. Cambridge Z88: Two people. Two visions. Two\ncomputers. Two user interfaces. Two 'modeless' office productivity programs.\nTwo marketplace dead-ends. Can there be one winner?\n\nWhat's New (06/04/2004): Various minor updates have been made to the FAQ and\nthe Non-Polaroid Instant Cameras pages-- including some photos of (and\ncommentary about) the KMZ Foton. I've also added a few new camera images\nscattered about the regular Camera Listings pages. Also, in response to the\nincreasing number of queries I receive about how to safely remove old grime\n(or yard-sale price stickers) from old Polaroid cameras, I've added a new\n\"HowTo\" page on that general topic.\n\nWhat's New (12/29/2003): \"Polaroid Says It's Hip To Be Square..?\" I don't\ngenerally comment much on Polaroid product introductions on this page, but\n(now that I finally got around to updating my Film Listings page\nappropriately) I thought it might be nice to highlight some additions/changes\nmade to Polaroid's line of peel-apart packfilms a few months ago, for they\nmight be of special interest to classic Polaroid camera owners. For one thing,\nyou may have noticed that the 80-series ('square'-format) packfilms had long\nappeared to be increasingly on the Polaroid \"endangered species list\",\nespecially in the USA. When was the last time you saw 80-series film in stock\nat your local camera store? Even a lot of the large mail-order stores stopped\ncarrying them. Type 87 film actually disappeared from Polaroid's USA web site\nyears ago (and presumed discontinued), and Type 88 was often hidden away on\nthe site, separated from its more glamorous rectangular-format bretheren.\nHowever, it appears that Polaroid has just had an abrupt change of heart for\nthe lowly square-pack. Like a phoenix, it has been reborn, stronger than\never-- this time as a new product line consisting of not just two, but five\ndifferent films, and even a re-designed OEM film back. Now Type 88 and 87 have\nbeen joined by three new \"pack\"-mates-- Types 84, 85, and 89. Yes, that new\nType 85 is a 'square' equivalent to Type 665 positive/negative film. ...And\nType 89 is based on the all-new Type 690 film. Even plain-old Type 88 is now\nbased on Type 669 rather than the creaky old Type 108 film emulsion. Also,\nlike all the new 80-series films, the 'improved' 88 will now have 10 prints\nper pack rather than eight. Square Shooters of the world rejoice, for you can\nonce again be bathed in the flash of a blue Electric Zip. Speaking of the new\nType 690 pack film, I've received several emails from people who have tried\nit, and most have generally regarded as the best color instant pack film\nPolaroid has ever made. Not only does it have even better color rendition than\nthe previous champ, Type 689, but the chemistry is apparently now almost\n\"self-timing,\" much like Polaroid integral films. In other words, no longer do\nyou need to keep a close eye on your watch to make sure you don't overdevelop\nthe film. This in and of itself is perhaps the biggest single technological\nimprovement to reach Polaroid pack films in quite some time. In any case, the\nresurrection of 80-series film has nothing to do with some sudden empathy at\nPolaroid for owners of 30-year-old plastic Square Shooters. What Polaroid is\nreally doing is re-positioning this film as a more efficient/economical format\nfor use in film backs for professional medium-format cameras-- one application\nthat has likely (so far) had a somewhat more minimal impact from digital\ntechnologies. Now, (*heh heh*) if only we could come up with a plausible new\nmarket for the old 40-series format... ;-) C'mon, Type 49 film? Can't you just\nsee it? :-) [ *rrring* *rrrring* \"Hello? Is this Polaroid Product Development?\nUm, haven't you noticed that deckle-edged prints are coming back in style? No?\nHow about prints with a big triangular-shaped tab on one side? You haven't\nseen that either? Well, trust me-- they're considered really arty these days.\nMy point? Oh, um, well, I think Polaroid needs to take advantage of this new,\num, 'trend' by re-introducing 40-series roll films, and perhaps even\nintroducing a new camera for that format, let's call it the Model 950. Doesn't\nthat sound great? *click* Hello?? Hello??\" ] Oh, well, maybe I should have\nsaid \"Model 110C\" instead.\n\nWhat's New (11/16/2003): After much delay, I have finally (!) crunched the\nnumbers on my Serial Number Project, and have updated the Cameras -> Rollfilm\nand Cameras -> Packfilm pages with my first preliminary set of estimated\nproduction numbers. See the Note following the Key to Symbols at the top of\nthose two pages for some quick tips about how to interpret these numbers. I\nwill update my Serial Number Project page in the near future with more details\nabout how the numbers were determined (for those interested in such things),\nbut I wanted to have something to put up for now. You may be surprised at the\nrelative production numbers of some models. Some may be surprising simply\nbecause they're not surprising. Heh.\n\nWhat's New (09/16/2003): First, some shameless self-promotion: Searching the\nGoogle News archives, I see that my original (text only) incarnation of The\nLand List made its debut on rec.photo on Sept 10, 1993. Looks like I missed\nthe 10th anniversary by 6 days. :-) Also, I see that the hit counter on this\npage has recently ticked over the 150,000 mark. Thanks to everyone for their\nsupport over the years! In other news, remember the Serial Number Project that\nI started here about two years ago..? Well, it has been a while indeed, but\nlittle by little, the log of collected serial numbers has been sloooowly\ngrowing, and is finally reaching the point where I think I can make some\nfairly useful production estimates (or at least 'guesstimates') for many\nPolaroid rollfilm cameras and folding packfilm cameras. I probably won't be\nready to \"publish\" the findings for a few weeks, but I felt a 'teaser' was in\norder. Also, I'd like to encourage anyone who wasn't previously aware of the\nproject to use the form on that page to send in the serial numbers from any\ncameras on that list that they own. Remember, every data point helps! Thanks\nto everyone for their help.\n\nWhat's New (05/29/2003): It's been a while, but finally some new updates are\ncoming to The Land List! Right now, I've added a few new items to the FAQ\npage, and added some content to the Cameras-Packfilm page. There should be\nsome more stuff added in the weeks ahead. In other parts of the Whirled, my In\nLiving Portacolor pages got some major updates last month (look for the new\nNot-A-Portacolor page in particular), and I'm starting to assemble together\nanother new \"mini-museum\" page which will feature some oddly-designed portable\nphonographs. More about that later.\n\nWhat's New (12/12/2002): Lots of updates these past couple of weeks, including\na number of corrections and informative tidbits sent in by site visitors.\nThanks to everyone! I've even updated the credits page. :-) Also, to coincide\nwith the addition of the new More! navigation page, I've added a new\n'feature'-- namely the Polaroid Advertising Archive page. Have fun!\n\nWhat's New (08/02/2002): Another old 'cobweb' in the corners of this site is\nfinally getting some badly-needed cleaning! Yes, it took long enough (about 3\nyears!), but I'm finally updating the Non-Polaroid Instant Cameras page.\nSheesh! This is actually 'Phase 1' of what should be a complete overhaul of\nthat section. In other news, (in case you care) the 'hit counter' for the main\nLand List page (the page you're reading right now) finally reached the 100,000\nmark in recent weeks. Thanks to everyone for their support! This got me\nthinking, though. The Land List (including its original, non-Web incarnation)\nis approaching its 10-year anniversary. (!) Perhaps you've noticed that while\nthis site contains plenty of product information, there has never actually\nbeen any product for sale on this site. Is there any merchandise (including\nmerchandising items) you'd like to see available here? ...Would you actually\nbuy any such products here if they were available? I'd be interested in your\ncomments.\n\nWhat's New (05/27/2002): Lots of small changes here and there. I also added a\nnew \"Mini-FAQ\" page which will replace the mailto: links on some pages. This\nshould help direct attention to the existence of the main FAQ page, which may\notherwise be overlooked. Also, I've added a Legal/Privacy info page. Yes, it\nseems like every site has one of those these days. I tend to look for them\ntoo. So, here's mine. It's sort of a work-in-progress for now though.\n\nWhat's New (02/04/2002): Okay, so it wasn't in the \"next few weeks,\" but\nhere's the start of a new Using a Polaroid Rollfilm Camera HowTo page. Yes, a\nPolaroid rollfilm camera user guide seems almost academic at this stage in the\ngame, but I do get asked about that from time to time, and I thought it'd be a\nnice idea.\n\nWhat's New (12/14/2001): Various minor changes have appeared from time to time\nin the months since August. I have now added a few new questions to the FAQ,\nas well as a new HowTo page about Close-Up Kit Substitutes for the Model\n180/195 Cameras. Another new HowTo page will probably appear in the next few\nweeks.\n\nWhat's New (08/07/2001): Made several minor updates to some camera and film\ndescriptions.\n\nWhat's New (05/28/2001): The FAQ hierarchy of pages now includes a new Serial\nNumber Info page. However, right now, it's a bit meager in terms of depth.\nEven so, I'm placing it on the site, as it relates to a little project I've\nbeen wanting to launch for a while. The project involves gathering serial\nnumbers from as many rollfilm and folding packfilm cameras as possible in\norder to try to estimate production runs and other statistics which are\notherwise unobtainable. You can help out by visiting the S/N Data Gathering\nProject page and submitting the serial numbers from any such camera that you\nhappen to have. It's painless, and if enough folks pitch in, perhaps in a year\nor so we'll actually be able to generate some useful statistics out of all\nthis!\n\nWhat's New (05/24/2001): Believe it or not, the Film Listings page has been\nupdated for the first time in (almost exactly) four years. (!) It has been\ncompletely overhauled, and contains considerably more information. In fact, in\nterms of HTML text size, it's close to 5 times the size as the old page. It\nalso now has image links like those found elsewhere on the site. Speaking of\nimages, the image links there and on the camera pages now open in a separate\nwindow. If you leave the 'link' window open and continue to click on image\nlinks, they too will open in that same window. Hopefully this will be more\nconvenient without being more annoying. In addition, a few additions have been\nmade to the camera listings pages, and the new navigation bars (and other\nnavigation improvements) continue to be phased in.\n\nWhat's New (05/04/2001): Regular visitors here may notice some major changes\nto the navigation bars found on various pages on this site. Hopefully, they'll\nhelp make the organization (or lack thereof) of this site a bit less\nconfusing. I'll probably tinker with the style a bit as I phase them in, but\neven now it should be an improvement over the old, static, navigation bars.\nAlso, the Accessories List page has been updated for the first time in over 18\nmonths, and (finally!) starts to include image links like those found on the\ncamera pages. More acessory images will be added as time goes on.\n\nWhat's New (04/26/2001): For the first time in about 2 years, the Battery FAQ\npage has been updated. Also, the less-than-obvious Alphabetical Camera Index\nhas been relocated to a more prominent place, as it is now incorporated with\nthe main Camera Listings page. With all the new camera images that have been\nadded to this site in recent months, I've started to wonder if the image links\nmight be more convenient if they were to open in a new window. While I'm not\nof the opinion that web sites should assume that I really want new windows\npopping up when I click a link, I thought I'd give it a trial run on the\ngallery update page. Let me know if you think it's annoying (or not). If you\nleave an image window open, all the subsequent image link clicks should open\nin that same image window, so you shouldn't have to worry about your desktop\nbeing flooded with new browser windows. In other news, the 'hit' counter for\nthe main Land List page (the very page you're reading right now) has just hit\nthe 50 thousand mark. Not exactly a big deal in the great scheme of things,\nbut not so bad considering that while the first 25,000 took some 3 years to\nachieve (from the point when I first started keeping a hit counter), the\nsecond 25k only took ten months. Thanks for visiting!\n\nWhat's New (03/23/2001): Even more image updates...\n\nWhat's New (03/21/2001): Lots of pictures, that's what. Some two dozen camera\nimages have been revised or added. If you're really curious which ones\nchanged, you can take a look at the gallery update page under the heading for\n3/21/01. In particular, I've concentrated on replacing all those old and/or\nout-of-focus and/or poorly color-balanced images linked from the rollfilm\ncamera page. Whew! Oh, and a few listings have been updated as well. Speaking\nof images, recently I started kicking around the idea (again) of putting up\nsome scans of various old Polaroid advertisements. Some are really quite\ninteresting, and they help demonstrate the evolution of not only Polaroid\ncameras, but the public perception/image of them as well. The problem,\nhowever, is that I'm not sure how to handle the copyright issues of providing\nsuch material here. We'll see.\n\nWhat's New (01/12/2001): By popular demand (?), there's a new \"How-To\" page\ndetailing how to replace the Ni-Cd battery in a #365 flash. There are also\nseveral new/revised camera illustrations for International-model pack cameras.\n\nWhat's New (12/09/2000): Made a few minor changes to a few camera listings,\nalong with some added camera images. Incidently, some of you might be\ninterested in a new (but much, much smaller) work-in-progress of mine. It's In\nLiving Porta-Color -- The Story of the Color Television Design That Wouldn't\nDie.\n\nWhat's New (10/13/2000): I've started a couple of camera model \"timeline\"\npages. These are pretty simplistic right now, and only cover rollfilm and\npackfilm cameras, but should provide a way to help see the progression of\ncamera designs through Polaroid's history. Right now, it's a text-only table,\nbut I may rework it as a fully graphical diagram sometime in the future.\n\nWhat's New (07/05/2000): Added or revised a number of camera illustrations.\n\nWhat's New (06/30/2000): Made several updates to the FAQ page, as well as some\nminor expansions to some of the descriptions in the rollfilm camera page. By\nthe way, I see that the 'hit' counter for the main Land List page has gotten\nbeyond the 25 thousand mark! This might almost sound impressive, except for\nthe fact that this particular counter has been running for almost three years.\n:-) Then again, I see that the hit frequency has been increasing at an almost\nexponential rate-- almost two thousand hits alone are from just this past\nmonth, for instance. Yeah, well, it's still not much to brag about (perhaps I\nshould just shut up while I'm ahead!), but I'm glad there are at least a few\nother people out there interested in old Polaroid cameras. :-) Thank you all\nvery much for all your support!\n\nWhat's New (05/24/2000): Thanks in part to my new digital camera, new images\nlinked to on the Camera Listings pages will now be improved both in quality\nand quantity (at last) ! [I started phasing in the new images in late April,\nso you may have noticed some of them already; the new images bear a copyright\n'stamp'.] Image updates will probably be fairly random, though. Also, I hope\nto start adding image links to the Accessories List page in the next month or\nso, as none of the accessory entries have had illustrations on the site so\nfar. By the way, if you're actually curious about finding the 'new' camera\npictures since the last time you visited, you can check this gallery update\npage. In addition to the new images, I've expanded some of the camera\ndescriptions a bit, and have added a new navigation aid to the packfilm\ncameras page. I'm planning to add a similar 'pictorial outline' table to the\nother camera listings pages eventually, but this one will be the most complex.\nAlso, I'll have to see if it's really useful or just adds unnecessary graphics\nto the page. (this may evolve into a camera timeline or something in the\ndistant future, as far as that goes).\n\nWhat's New (04/20/2000): The rollfilm camera conversion page has been revised,\nand now includes a 'gallery' of cameras (two, so far) actually converted by\nvisitors to this site.\n\nHey Hey! Thanks to a new domain name, now you can also directly access this\npage as www.landlist.org NOTE: There's no need to change your bookmarks\nthough, because it's simply a web forward. My email address stays the same too\n(though mail to mkuhn at landlist dot org should get forwarded to me anyway).\n...not that anyone will care, mind you, but I thought it'd be fun to create a\nweb banner 'ad' for the Land List now that it has its own domain. Don't\nworry-- it won't actually appear on the Land List home page-- but you can see\nyour choice of static or animated versions. [the only animated gif to be found\nas part of The Land List pages...] Of course, you may use these banners for\nthe purpose of web links to this site if you like.\n\n  * [COMING EVENTUALLY] Professional/Industrial Camera/Accessory Listings: A reference for industrial and other special-purpose Polaroid cameras.\n  * [COMING EVENTUALLY] A Brief History of Edwin Land and His Camera\n\nLast updated 02/09/2008\n\n\"Polaroid\", \"Land Camera\" and other camera names are trademarks of Polaroid\nCorporation.
