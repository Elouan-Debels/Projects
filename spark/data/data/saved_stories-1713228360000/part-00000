Filing a motion to\nblock the CID, MMFA told the court that the CID had violated the media\norganization's First Amendment rights, providing evidence that Paxton's\ninvestigation and CID had chilled MMFA speech.\n\nPaxton had requested Media Matters' financial records\u2014including \"direct and\nindirect sources of funding for all Media Matters operations involving X\nresearch or publications\"\u2014as well as \"internal and external communications\" on\n\"Musk\u2019s purchase of X\" and X's current CEO Linda Yaccarino. He also asked for\nall of Media Matters' communications with X representatives and X advertisers.\n\nBut perhaps most invasive, Paxton wanted to see all the communications about\nMedia Matters' X reporting that triggered the lawsuits, which, as US District\nJudge Amit Mehta wrote in an opinion published Friday, was a compelled\ndisclosure that \"poses a serious threat to the vitality of the newsgathering\nprocess.\"\n\nMehta was concerned that MMFA showed that \"Media Matters\u2019 editorial leaders\nhave pared back reporting and publishing, particularly on any topics that\ncould be perceived as relating to the Paxton investigation\"\u2014including two\nfollow-ups on its X reporting. Because of Paxton's alleged First Amendment\nretaliation, MMFA said it did not publish \"two pieces concerning X\u2019s placement\nof advertising alongside antisemitic, pro-Nazi accounts\"\u2014\"not out of\nlegitimate concerns about fairness or accuracy,\" but \"out of fear of\nharassment, threats, and retaliation.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Mehta's order, Paxton did not contest that Texas' lawsuit had\nchilled MMFA's speech. Further, Paxton had given at least one podcast\ninterview where he called upon other state attorneys general to join him in\ninvestigating MMFA.\n\nBecause Paxton \"projected himself across state lines and asserted a pseudo-\nnational executive authority,\u201d Mehta wrote and repeatedly described MMFA as a\n\u201cradical anti-free speech\u201d or \u201cradical left-wing organization,\u201d the court had\nseen sufficient \"evidence of retaliatory intent.\"\n\n\"Notably,\" Mehta wrote, Paxton remained \"silent\" and never \"submitted a sworn\ndeclaration that explains his reasons for opening the investigation.\"\n\nIn his press release, Paxton justified the investigation by saying, \"We are\nexamining the issue closely to ensure that the public has not been deceived by\nthe schemes of radical left-wing organizations who would like nothing more\nthan to limit freedom by reducing participation in the public square.\"\n\nUltimately, Mehta granted MMFA's request for a preliminary injunction to block\nPaxton's CID because the judge found that the investigation and the CID have\ncaused MMFA \"to self-censor when making research and publication decisions,\nadversely affected the relationships between editors and reporters, and\nrestricted communications with sources and journalists.\"\n\n\"Only injunctive relief will 'prevent the [ongoing] deprivation of free speech\nrights,'\" Mehta's opinion said, deeming MMFA's reporting as \"core First\nAmendment activities.\"\n\nMehta's order also banned Paxton from taking any steps to further his\ninvestigation until the lawsuit is decided.\n\nIn a statement Friday, MMFA President and CEO Angelo Carusone celebrated the\nwin as not just against Paxton but also against Musk.\n\n\"Elon Musk encouraged Republican state attorneys general to use their power to\nharass their critics and stifle reporting about X,\" Carusone said. \"Ken Paxton\nwas one of those AGs that took up the call and he was defeated. Today's\ndecision is a victory for free speech.\"\n\nPaxton has not yet responded to the preliminary injunction and his office did\nnot respond to Ars' request to comment..\n\nMedia Matters' lawyer, Aria C. Branch, a partner at Elias Law Group, told Ars\nthat \u201cwhile Attorney General Paxton\u2019s office has not yet responded to Friday\u2019s\nruling, the preliminary injunction should certainly put an end to these kind\nof lawless, politically motivated attempts to muzzle the press.\u201d\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n67\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
