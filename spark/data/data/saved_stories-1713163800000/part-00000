The full functionality is provided within\nthis React component!\n\n## Demo\n\nSearch/sort on a text's paragraphs of a webpage:\n\nhttps://mihaiii.github.io/semantic-autocomplete/\n\n## How to install\n\nInstall:\n\nnpm install --save semantic-autocomplete\n\nThen import:\n\nimport SemanticAutocomplete from \"semantic-autocomplete\";\n\n## Usage\n\nSince semantic-autocomplete extends MUI's autocomplete, the entire v5 MUI's\nautocomplete API will also work on semantic-autocomplete. The only exception\nis the filterOptions property.\n\nYou can see the component being used in code here and here.\n\nSee this page for how you can use MUI's autocomplete and therefore semantic-\nautocomplete too.\n\nBesides the MUI's autocomplete API, the following props are provided:\n\nthreshold: if it has a value, then the component will filter out options below\nthis cosine similarity value. Defaults to no value (meaning no filtering, only\nsorting). Click for code example.\n\nonResult: callback function once the sorting/filtering of the options is done,\nusing the resulted options areay as first param. Click for code example.\n\nmodel: the name of the Huggingface ML model repo. It has to have the ONNX\nembeddings model. The folder structure of the repo has to be the standard one\nused by transformers.js. If you're interested in changing the default used\nmodel, you might find this filter useful. Default value: TaylorAI/gte-tiny\n(pointing to this repo), which loads the ONNX quantized model having ~23 MB.\nClick here for code example\n\npipelineParams: the params to be passed to transformer.js when loading the\nmodel. Default value: { pooling: \"mean\", normalize: true }. For more info,\nplease see this page.\n\n## Thanks / credit\n\n  * xonova for building transformers.js, providing clear & in detail documentation, always being willing to help out and for having lots of demos on his HF account. The work for this component is based on his tutorial on how to build a React component using tranaformers.js.\n  * andersonbcdefg for building gte-tiny, which is the default model used in this component. It's an excellent model and it made this repo possible, given I needed a very capable and small model. Note that on TaylorAI there is even a smaller model (17.4 MB) that can be used via the model property of semantic-autocomplete: bge-micro-v2.\n\n## About\n\nA blazing-fast semantic search React component.
