This is not something I have tried\nout in any of my teams yet, but I might eventually do. This popped into my\nhead when one of our agile captains started to walk the team\u2019s kanban board\nfrom left to right. This was a mistake, and a team member reminded him that he\nshould walk the kanban board from right to left, to pull things through the\nprocess, rather than to push. The behavior of pushing work trough the process\nis deeply rooted in the minds of our team members, even if we have used Kanban\nfor quite some time.\n\nSo my idea is this, why not mirror (horizontally turn) the kanban board to\nsupport this behavior that seems to come naturally? Doing things from left to\nright is deeply rooted in our behavior in large parts of the world. You are\nreading this text from left to right as an example. In other parts of the\nworld reading is not done from left to right and there this idea might be less\napplicable.\n\n### Example of a \u201dmirrored kanban board\u201d\n\nHow would this look like in real life? First, here is a picture of a \u201dstandard\nkanban board\u201d.\n\nAbove is an example of a \u201dstandard kanban board\u201d where the flow is going from\nleft to right, and thus needs to be walked from right to left to get the pull\nbehavior.\n\nAbove is a \u201dmirrored kanban board\u201d which is walked from left to right to\nemphasize the pull behavior. Accordingly the flow is going from right to left.\n\n### Benefits\n\nWhat are the benefits of mirroring your kanban board? Here are some things\nthat I can think of:\n\n  * Emphasize the pulling behavior. The person walking the board will pull things through the process by walking the board from left to right.\n  * Emphasize the natural behavior of doing something from left to right, since this seems to be deeply rooted.\n  * Excitement of a new experiment. If you have a team that has used a \u201dstandard kanban board\u201d for a long time, this could be one way to shake them up a bit to open up their minds again for new ideas.\n\nThe possible drawback I can see is of course that this change can take some\ntime to get used to. Especially if the team has worked a long time with a\n\u201dstandard kanban board\u201d.\n\nI can also think that it might be a good idea to use the \u201dmirrored kanban\nboard\u201d to help the team members to get the pull behavior, and then when it\ncomes naturally switch back to a \u201dstandard kanban board\u201d.\n\n### Summary\n\nHave any one of you tried out something like this? I\u2019m eager to hear all your\nfeedback! After reading The Innovators I believe in sharing ideas even if they\nare not fully finished. Only when they are exposed to others that can\ncontribute, they will grow to become something really useful!\n\nAll the best, Tomas from TheAgileist\n\nBlog post update:\n\nCould this be the world\u2019s first mirrored kanban board?\n\nPosted in Agile, Innovation, Kanban, Management and tagged Mirrored kanban\nboard on 31 August, 2015 by Tomas Rybing. 9 Comments\n\n### Most popular\n\n  * Top Ten List - Books\n  * Design Thinking\n  * Mirrored kanban board\n  * Feedback Loops 2.0\n  * Greatness (by modern leadership)\n  * The Unicorn Project\n  * Team of Teams\n  * Salvation: The Bungsu Story\n  * Organization change - Turn the pyramid!\n  * Personal Kanban\n\n### Recent posts\n\n  * Remote Retrospective using spreadsheet\n  * Agile Conversations\n  * Remote working\n  * Team Planning day\n  * The Unicorn Project\n  * Design Thinking\n  * How to eat an Elephant?\n  * Salvation: The Bungsu Story\n  * Democratic retrospective\n  * Remote Retrospective using Lean Coffee\n  * Humans vs Computers\n  * More Agile ahead!\n  * Focus & Flow\n  * The Goal\n  * The Journey\n  * Philosophy \u2013 One Step Ahead\n  * Top Ten List \u2013 Books\n  * Agile Metrics in Action\n  * Self-Organization & The Planning Board\n  * Team of Teams\n  * The Blooming Garden\n  * King of Kanban\n  * Doing It\n  * Zero Inbox\n  * Concentration cone\n  * Tachometer to find perfect flow\n  * Planning with multiple timelines\n  * Switch\n  * Famban\n  * Retrospective with timeline\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * The Agileist\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
