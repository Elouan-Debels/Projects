Instagram thinks A.I. can lend a big\nhand.\n\nInstagram is pitching popular influencers on a program that relies on\nartificial intelligence to interact with fans, the latest example of how Meta,\nInstagram\u2019s parent company, is trying to expand the technology across its\nproducts.\n\nThe program, which is in its early stages of testing and known as \u201cCreator\nA.I.,\u201d would allow influencers to chat with fans through direct messages on\nthe social network and potentially through Instagram comments in the future,\naccording to five people briefed on the company\u2019s plans. The program will\nessentially be a chatbot that mimics the \u201cvoice\u201d of the Instagram influencer\nto respond to fans, the people said.\n\nMost of the messages would be sent automatically and would at least initially\ndisclose that they were A.I.-generated, according to two of the people.\n\nThe goal, according to the people, is to give creators with large followings\nthe ability to better connect with fans while decreasing the amount of work\nrequired to personally respond to large numbers of messages and comments. The\npeople spoke on condition of anonymity because they were asked to sign\nnondisclosure agreements as part of the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEva Chen, Instagram\u2019s director of fashion partnerships, recently pitched\ncreators on the effort and the platform has also been briefing agencies on it,\naccording to three of the people involved in the talks. It is unclear if the\nprogram will be widely released.\n\nCreators can select the data Meta uses to copy the way they speak, including\ntheir previous Instagram posts, direct messages, comments, and audio from\nReels and Instagram Stories, two of the people said. Influencers can also\ndictate specific responses to certain questions, one person said.\n\nA spokesman for Meta declined to comment.\n\nMeta has aggressively pushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into all\ncorners of the company\u2019s business, from improving its advertising systems to\nbuilding A.I. assistants into smart glasses and other hardware projects. Mark\nZuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, has said he believes artificial\nintelligence will become an \u201cincreasingly important driver of opportunity\u201d for\npeople, businesses and the economy as a whole.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg has also envisioned a world in which people will have\nomnipresent A.I. assistants to help them carry out daily tasks and other forms\nof work. Meta has spent billions of dollars redesigning the company\u2019s systems\nto improve its development of the technology, racing to compete with companies\nlike Google, Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nAnd Meta has been spending millions of dollars to court influencers to its\nsocial networks, including Instagram and Facebook, after years of neglecting\nto do so. Mr. Zuckerberg has said he wants to \u201cbuild the best platform for\nmillions of creators to make a living.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome influencers have recently received invitations to a May event in New\nYork, where Meta said it planned to demonstrate some of the company\u2019s new and\nexperimental A.I. products, according to two of the people familiar with\nMeta\u2019s plans.\n\nThe Creator A.I. program expands on Meta\u2019s earlier efforts to incorporate a\ncast of A.I. avatars built using the likenesses of celebrities like Kendall\nJenner and Mr. Beast. In that program, Meta created entirely new characters\nnamed \u201cBillie\u201d or \u201cZach\u201d on Instagram and Facebook \u2014 which were depicted with\nthe faces of participating celebrities \u2014 that could interact with fans.\n\nSome creators have been hesitant about the notion of automating their\ninteractions with their followers, saying that it could put words in their\nmouth that they don\u2019t agree with. Others have balked at the notion that a\nchatbot could replicate the substance of the interactions they have with fans.\nMany influencers have found success by interacting with people who crave more\nauthentic and direct connections with the online personalities they follow.\n\nStill, there is some precedent for the program. A number of creators already\nrely on outside agencies and tools used to help respond to messages they\nreceive across their Instagram and Facebook accounts. One such company, School\nof Bots, sells an A.I. chatbot program to influencers who want to automate\ndirect message discussions with their followers.\n\nIt does not yet appear that Meta\u2019s first batch of A.I.-powered avatars has\nbeen a breakout hit. While Billie, the character inspired by Ms. Jenner, has\n193,000 followers on Instagram, the comments on a recent video from the\naccount were largely bemused. \u201cThis is so stupid,\u201d one commenter said,\ngarnering more than 12,700 Likes. \u201cI wonder how Kyndall feels about this robot\nimpersonating her,\u201d said another, misspelling the star\u2019s name.\n\nAnd still another: \u201cwhy ya\u2019ll wanna text a robot?\u201d\n\nSapna Maheshwari reports on TikTok, technology and emerging media companies.\nShe has been a business reporter for more than a decade.
