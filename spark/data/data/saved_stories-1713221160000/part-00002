A new neuromodulation\napproach to treat tinnitus has emerged that combines sound with electrical\nstimulation of somatosensory pathways, supported by multiple animal studies\ndemonstrating that bimodal stimulation can elicit extensive neural plasticity\nwithin the auditory brain. More recently, in a large-scale clinical trial,\nbimodal neuromodulation combining sound and tongue stimulation drove\nsignificant reductions in tinnitus symptom severity during the first 6 weeks\nof treatment, followed by diminishing improvements during the second 6 weeks\nof treatment. The primary objective of the large-scale randomized and double-\nblinded study presented in this paper was to determine if background wideband\nnoise as used in the previous clinical trial was necessary for bimodal\ntreatment efficacy. An additional objective was to determine if adjusting the\nparameter settings after 6 weeks of treatment could overcome treatment\nhabituation effects observed in the previous study. The primary endpoint at\n6-weeks involved within-arm and between-arm comparisons for two treatment arms\nwith different bimodal neuromodulation settings based on two widely used and\nvalidated outcome instruments, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus\nFunctional Index. Both treatment arms exhibited a statistically significant\nreduction in tinnitus symptoms during the first 6-weeks, which was further\nreduced significantly during the second 6-weeks by changing the parameter\nsettings (Cohen\u2019s d effect size for full treatment period per arm and outcome\nmeasure ranged from \u2212 0.7 to \u2212 1.4). There were no significant differences\nbetween arms, in which tongue stimulation combined with only pure tones and\nwithout background wideband noise was sufficient to reduce tinnitus symptoms.\nThese therapeutic effects were sustained up to 12 months after the treatment\nended. The study included two additional exploratory arms, including one arm\nthat presented only sound stimuli during the first 6 weeks of treatment and\nbimodal stimulation in the second 6 weeks of treatment. This arm revealed the\ncriticality of combining tongue stimulation with sound for treatment efficacy.\nOverall, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events and a high\ncompliance rate (83.8%) with 70.3% of participants indicating benefit. The\ndiscovery that adjusting stimulation parameters overcomes previously observed\ntreatment habituation can be used to drive greater therapeutic effects and\nopens up new opportunities for optimizing stimuli and enhancing clinical\noutcomes for tinnitus patients with bimodal neuromodulation.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Daily high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation of bilateral\ntemporal cortex in chronic tinnitus \u2013 a pilot study\n\nArticle Open access 22 August 2019\n\nPeter M.

It\ncontinues to be a major health issue in our society with limited treatment\noptions^5,6. Encouragingly, there has been a recent convergence of findings\nacross multiple animal and human studies demonstrating that bimodal\nneuromodulation combining sound with electrical stimulation of peripheral\nnerves, including vagus, trigeminal and other somatosensory nerves, can drive\nneural plasticity relevant for tinnitus treatment and significantly improve\ntinnitus symptoms^7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Previous animal studies have\nshown that bimodal stimulation combining electrical body stimulation combined\nwith pure tones or wideband noise can alter brain activity within auditory\nregions associated with tinnitus^7,8,13,14,15. These studies demonstrated that\nelectrical stimulation of the vagus or trigeminal nerves or the surface of\ndifferent body regions in animals (e.g., tongue, face, neck and ear) can alter\nbrain patterns relevant for tinnitus treatment and reduce tinnitus symptom\nseverity in human patients. Furthermore, different patterns of stimuli appear\nto be effective. Bimodal neuromodulation comprising pure tones or wideband\nnoise drive significant neural plasticity in the brainstem, midbrain or cortex\nalong the auditory pathway^7,8,10,13,14,15,16. Different timing schemes\nbetween sound stimulation and somatosensory nerve stimulation have also been\nshown to reduce tinnitus symptoms, in which interstimulus delays can vary up\nto hundreds of milliseconds^7,9,11.\n\nIn 2020, results from a large randomized and blinded clinical trial for\nbimodal neuromodulation (TENT-A1 study; clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02669069) with\n326 enrolled participants supported the safety and efficacy of combined sound\nand tongue stimulation therapy using the Lenire device (Fig. 1a; CE-marked\nClass IIa medical device; Neuromod Devices, Ireland)^11. The TENT-A1 study\nshowed that bimodal neuromodulation reduced tinnitus symptom severity scores\nin more than 80% of participants during the 12-week treatment period that\ncould last for 12 months after the treatment ended. The scores were based on\ntwo widely used and validated outcome instruments: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory\n(THI) and Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)^17,18,19,20. About two-thirds of the\nparticipants also reported that they had benefitted from the tinnitus\ntreatment based on exit interview questions. These outcomes were consistent\nacross all three treatment arms in the study that included different parameter\nsettings, and there were no significant differences between arms. As detailed\nin the published TENT-A1 manuscript^11, \u201carm 1 (PS1 setting) consisted of\nsynchronized sound and tongue stimulation. A pure tone (ranging approximately\nfrom 500 to 8000 Hz, with repetition period of about 80 ms) was presented at\nthe same time that a train of pulses was presented to a specific location on\nthe tongue. The stimulation location on the tongue array was fixed for a given\npure tone frequency; this resulted in a fixed tone-to-tongue spatial mapping.\nArm 2 (PS2 setting) used the same auditory stimuli as PS1 but had short\ninterstimulus delays that varied in the range of 30\u201350 ms across each stimulus\npresentation and the tone-to-tongue spatial mapping was randomized across\nstimulus presentations. Arm 3 (PS3 setting) used lower frequency tones\n(approximately 100 to 500 Hz) with longer interstimulus delays (550\u2013950 ms)\nthan used in PS2.\u201d All three parameter settings included background wideband\nnoise and applied supra-threshold intensities for sound and tongue\nstimulation. These settings were fixed across the 12-week treatment period.\n\nFigure 1\n\nTimeline of different parameter settings for tinnitus treatment in the TENT-A2\nstudy. (a) The Lenire bimodal neuromodulation device developed by Neuromod\nDevices is shown (CE-marked Class IIa; previously referred to as MBT in the\nstudy). Sound stimulation is delivered through wireless headphones and\nelectrical stimulation is presented to the anterior-dorsal surface of the\ntongue via a 32-site electrode array. Both stimulation approaches are\ncontrolled using a battery-powered controller. Bimodal stimulation activates\nauditory and somatosensory pathways, as well as converging centers in\nauditory, limbic and attentional brain regions implicated in tinnitus. (b)\nTimeline of four treatment arms with different stimulation parameters over\ntime (see Supplementary Table S1 for detailed description). Arm 1 and arm 2\nare included for the primary endpoint analyses. Arm 3 and arm 4 are included\nfor additional analyses. Evaluations of device safety and efficacy were\nconducted at interim and final visits with post-treatment follow-ups planned\nat weeks 18, 38 and 64 from enrollment.\n\nFull size image\n\nTwo interesting observations from that previous TENT-A1 study^11 have raised\nfurther questions about which stimulus components and parameters are necessary\nand sufficient for treatment success. The first observation was that all three\ncombinations of parameter settings significantly reduced tinnitus symptom\nseverity, despite different tone frequencies, tongue stimulus patterns and\ninterstimulus delays. Given that all three combinations included background\nwideband noise, this raises the important question as to whether or not the\nnoise feature was necessary for bimodal treatment to be effective. The second\nobservation was that significant improvements in tinnitus symptom severity\noccurred primarily within the first 6 weeks of treatment, with diminishing\nimprovements during the second 6 weeks of treatment. This raises the question\nas to whether adjusting the parameter settings during treatment could overcome\nthe habituation effects and drive further therapeutic benefits. The motivating\nreasons for the current study, referred to as TENT-A2 (Treatment Evaluation of\nNeuromodulation for Tinnitus\u2014Stage 2; clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03530306), were\nto investigate and answer these two questions, as well as to confirm the\nsafety and efficacy results observed in the TENT-A1 study. The study design\nwas double-blinded because all participants were informed that they were\nreceiving an active treatment and neither they nor the participant-facing\ninvestigators could ascertain which treatment arm would provide the greatest\ntherapeutic benefit.\n\nTENT-A2 was statistically powered (arm 1 and arm 2 in Fig. 1b) to test the\nfirst question about whether the wideband noise component of the sound\nstimulus was necessary for therapeutic benefit at the 6-week endpoint. The\nnoise parameter was present in the parameter settings for arm 1 and absent for\narm 2 (see Supplementary Table S1 for a description of parameter settings).\nAdditional analysis assessed the second question about the effect of adjusting\nthe sound and tongue stimulus parameters at the 6-week (interim) visit. In arm\n1, the pure tone presentation and tongue stimulation were changed from being\nsynchronous to having a varied interstimulus delay with the location of\nstimulation on the tongue randomized across stimuli (i.e., PS1\u2013PS4). In arm 2,\nthe sound stimulus changed from pure tone stimuli to noise bursts with a\ndifferent range of interstimulus delays (i.e., PS6 to PS10). Comparisons at\nmultiple time points depicted in Fig. 1b, including follow-up visits, were\nallocated to exploratory analyses.\n\nThe study design also included two exploratory arms (arm 3 and arm 4) to\ninvestigate the contribution of different sound and tongue stimulus components\non therapeutic outcomes, without an expectation of hypothesis testing. The\nfirst 6-week period in arm 3 investigated the efficacy of a stimulation regime\nusing four simultaneous tones instead of single or dual tones as in the other\narms. In arm 4, the first 6-week period comprised a sound-only condition\n(without tongue stimulation), after which tongue stimulation was added in at\nthe interim visit. Further details and rationale for the parameter settings\nused in each arm are provided in a previously published protocol paper^21 with\na summary of the parameter settings in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nThe clinical site for the study was the Wellcome Trust-HRB Clinical Research\nFacility at St. James\u2019s Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. The study protocol was\nindependently reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the\nTallaght University Hospital-St James\u2019s Hospital (Reference: 2018-03-List-9).\nThe study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03530306). All methods were\ncarried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\nParticipants that were enrolled into the study were fitted with the Lenire\ndevice and instructed to use it for one hour per day for 12 weeks, with three\nfollow-up visits up to 12 months after the treatment ended (Fig. 1b). As in\nthe TENT-A1 study, THI and TFI were used for the outcome measures of the\nTENT-A2 study. Safety, acceptability, and efficacy results for the Lenire\ndevice for the full cohort of participants are presented in this paper. Other\nplanned analyses of subgroups, including patients with co-morbid hyperacusis\nand high tinnitus symptom severity groups, and additional exploratory\ninvestigations of different types of tinnitus outcome measures will be\npresented in a subsequent publication. Further details on the study design and\nanalysis plan are provided in a previously published protocol paper^21.\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics and summary of study participants\n\nStudy participants were recruited to the clinical trial using radio\nadvertising and directed to an online eligibility assessment. Eligibility was\ninitially assessed through a set of general pre-screening questions to manage\nthe large number of candidates expected to respond to the advertising^22. Of\nthese potential participants, 462 signed an informed consent and attended a\nclinical screening visit. On the basis of the inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria, 194 participants were randomized into the four treatment arms (Fig.\n2). Two of those individuals did not attend the enrollment visit while one\nparticipant was withdrawn at the enrollment visit prior to receiving the\ndevice by the study investigators, resulting in a total of 191 individuals\ncompleting enrollment and device fitting.\n\nFigure 2\n\nParticipant flow diagram. For the primary endpoint analyses, within-arm\ncomparisons from start of treatment to the 6-week assessment for THI and TFI\nwere performed with per-protocol analysis (PPA) for those who were compliant\nto treatment (at least 18 h of device usage over 6 weeks of treatment period).\nOnly arm 1 was included for the within-arm primary endpoint analyses whereas\nthe other arms were included as additional analyses. Between-arm comparison\nwas performed only between arm 1 and arm 2 for the primary endpoint analyses\nfor changes in THI scores from start of treatment to the 6-week assessment\nusing intention-to-treat (ITT) with imputation for missing values described in\nthe Methods. Additional exploratory analyses for THI and TFI were performed at\nother time points during treatment and up to week 64 (12 months post-\ntreatment) that are presented in this paper, with compliance and participant\nnumber information provided where appropriate for those analyses. Follow-up\n(FU) visits are depicted in Fig. 1.\n\nFull size image\n\nAs shown in Table 1, there were no significant differences between arm 1 and\narm 2 (P > 0.05; relevant for primary endpoint analyses) pertaining to several\ncharacteristics and stratification categories. There was a high retention rate\nof participants with 89.9% and 95.0% of enrolled participants returning to the\n6-week (interim) visit for arm 1 and arm 2, respectively. Across all four arms\nthere was also a high retention rate of participants of 93.2% at the 6-week\nvisit and 90.6% at the 12-week visit when the treatment ended. The high\nretention rate in this study is aligned with the high treatment compliance\nrate at the 6-week and 12-week assessments of 86.4% and 83.8%, respectively\n(Supplementary Fig. S2). Compliance at 6-weeks was defined as device usage of\nat least 18 h in the first 6 weeks of treatment while compliance at 12-weeks\nwas defined as device usage of at least 36 h during the 12 weeks of treatment;\nthese criteria were based on findings from a previous large-scale tinnitus\ntreatment study using the Lenire device^11. The device logged the time and\ndate of daily usage by each participant. There were no significant differences\nin the compliance rate or number of participants between arm 1 and arm 2 that\nare relevant for the primary endpoint analyses (P > 0.05). Participants\nattended their visits at the intended time points during the treatment period,\nas well as the 12-month follow-up visit (Week 64), as shown in Supplementary\nFig. S3. Due to scheduling conflicts, there was an average delay of one week\nfor the Week 18 visit (6-week follow-up) and an average shift of three weeks\nearlier for the Week 38 visit (6-month follow-up). These shifts in post-\ntreatment assessment dates did not affect the primary endpoint analyses of the\nstudy, which were based on only the first 6 weeks of treatment.\n\nTable 1 Characteristics of enrolled participants in each arm with key numbers\nfor each visit.\n\nFull size table\n\n### Background wideband noise stimulation is not necessary for achieving\nbimodal treatment efficacy\n\nIn arm 1, PS1 was provided during the first 6 weeks of treatment. PS1\nconsisted of pure tone bursts temporally and spatially synchronized with\nelectrical pulses presented to different locations on the surface of the\ntongue, together with background wideband noise. PS6 in arm 2 consisted of\nonly pure tone bursts paired with spatially randomized tongue stimulation with\nvarying interstimulus delays (700\u2013800 ms) and without any background noise. We\nobserved in the previous TENT-A1 study^11 that a synchronized sound and tongue\nstimulation paradigm or a spatially-temporally varying sound and tongue\nstimulation paradigm both achieved significant improvements in tinnitus\nsymptoms when including wideband noise, and there were no significant\ndifferences between paradigms. Thus, both types of stimulation paradigms were\nincluded in this TENT-A2 study, except that arm 2 did not include wideband\nnoise. Both sound and tongue stimuli were presented at supra-threshold\nintensities. A description of the parameter settings used in arm 1 and arm 2\nare presented in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nAt the 6-week assessment, arm 1 and arm 2 exhibited highly significant\nreductions in THI and TFI scores relative to their baseline scores (Fig. 3; P\n< 0.0001, paired two-tailed t-tests; adjusted significance level for multiple\ncomparisons is 0.0025 described in Conlon et al.^21). These improvements in\ntinnitus symptom severity correspond to an average reduction in THI score of\n12.9 and 11.5 points for arm 1 and arm 2, respectively, and in TFI score of\n11.6 and 11.7 points, respectively (Fig. 3). For Cohen\u2019s d^23, arm 1 exhibited\nan effect size (with confidence interval, CI) of \u2212 0.8 [95% CI: \u2212 1.0, \u2212 0.6]\nfor THI and \u2212 0.6 [95% CI: \u2212 0.7, \u2212 0.4] for TFI, while arm 2 exhibited an\neffect size of \u2212 0.8 [95% CI: \u2212 1.0, \u2212 0.6] for THI and \u2212 0.7 [95% CI: \u2212 0.9,\n\u2212 0.5] for TFI. A d value of 0.5 is considered a moderate effect size while a\nd value of 0.8 is considered a large effect size, indicating that bimodal\nstimulation drives a moderate to large reduction in tinnitus symptom severity\nwithin a 6-week treatment period. Although the within-arm primary endpoints\nwere achieved in this study, there was no significant difference between arm 1\nand arm 2 (P > 0.0275; adjusted significance level for multiple comparisons\ndescribed in Conlon et al.^21). Although this null difference does not reveal\nwhich parameter setting is superior (i.e., arm 1 versus arm 2), the within-arm\nresults confirm that the background wideband noise component is not necessary\nfor achieving significant reductions in tinnitus symptom severity with bimodal\nstimulation. As observed in the previous TENT-A1 study^11, synchronous bimodal\nstimulation or stimulation with interstimulus delays of several hundred\nmilliseconds, as well as different tone-to-tongue mapping strategies, are all\nsufficient to drive significant reductions in tinnitus symptom severity.\n\nFigure 3\n\nWithin-arm and between-arm analyses for primary endpoints at 6-weeks. The mean\ndifferences in THI and TFI scores across participants for arm 1 and arm 2 from\nbaseline to 6-week assessment for the within-arm cases, or the mean\ndifferences between arm 1 and arm 2 for the change in scores from enrollment\nto 6-week assessment for the between-arm cases are plotted with the \u00b1 95% CI.\nWithin-arm analyses were based on per-protocol analysis that included\ntreatment-compliant participants (\u2265 18 h treatment at 6-weeks) with baseline\nand 6-week scores. The baseline score corresponds to the average of the scores\nat screening and enrollment visits. Within-arm analyses for arm 1 and arm 2\nshowed a highly statistically significant reduction in THI and TFI scores\n(i.e., improvement in tinnitus symptom severity) based on paired two-tailed\nt-tests (P < 0.0001; 95% CI does not overlap the vertical line at zero).\nBetween-arm analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat analysis with\nchanges in THI or TFI scores from the enrollment to 6-weeks assessment and\ntested with multiple regression using enrollment score as a covariate. Missing\ndata were imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation\nmethod (further details are provided in the Methods), which leads to n values\nthat match the enrolled numbers for each arm. There was no significant\ndifference between arm 1 and arm 2 (P > 0.05; 95% CI crosses vertical line at\nzero). Note that primary endpoint analyses included within-arm changes for THI\nand TFI for arm 1 and between-arm differences for arm 1 and arm 2 only for\nTHI, but that the other within-arm and between-arm comparisons are presented\nin this figure for completeness. Parameter settings (see Supplementary Table\nS1 for details): arm 1\u2014PS1 (synchronized bimodal stimulation, includes pure\ntones and background noise stimuli); arm 2\u2014PS6 (includes only pure tones with\nno background noise stimuli and with varied interstimulus delays in the range\nof 700\u2013800 ms).\n\nFull size image\n\n### Therapeutic benefit is boosted by adjusting parameter settings and is\nsustained long term\n\nThe study was designed to track changes in tinnitus symptom severity at\nmultiple time points during treatment and up to 12 months after the end of\ntreatment. As shown in Fig. 4, there was a large reduction in tinnitus\nsymptoms during the first 6 weeks of treatment, which continued to decrease\nduring the second 6 weeks of treatment after the stimulation setting was\nchanged from PS1 to PS4 in arm 1 and PS6 to PS10 in arm 2 (Fig. 4). This\npattern of treatment outcome differs from the previous TENT-A1 study in which\nimprovements diminished during the second 6 weeks of treatment, when\npresenting the same stimulation setting for the entire 12-week treatment\nperiod^11. As further shown in Fig. 5, when adjusting the stimulation setting\nmidway through the treatment period, there were significant reductions in THI\nand TFI scores during the first 6 weeks of treatment and also during the\nsecond 6 weeks of treatment. A significant reduction in THI or TFI score was\nnot observed during the second 6 weeks of treatment in the previous TENT-A1\nstudy (Supplementary Fig. S4). These contrasting findings were consistently\nobserved across individual treatment arms (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). At\nthe end of the 12-week treatment period for the TENT-A2 study, there was an\naverage reduction across both arms of 18.5 points for THI and 15.3 points for\nTFI relative to the baseline scores. The improvements in tinnitus symptom\nseverity were sustained for 12 months after treatment was withdrawn, resulting\nin an average long-term reduction of 20.2 points for THI and 17.3 points for\nTFI. For the TENT-A1 study (see Fig. 5 in that study paper^11), there was an\naverage reduction across arms of 12.6 points for THI and 12.0 points for TFI\nwith a long-term reduction of 12.8 points for THI and 14.4 points for TFI,\nwhich are less than the improvements observed in the TENT-A2 study.\n\nFigure 4\n\nLong-term clinical efficacy of bimodal neuromodulation. Change in THI score\n(a) or TFI score (b) from baseline to the different time points are plotted up\nto the 12-month post-treatment visit (Week 64) for participants who were\ntreatment-compliant (\u2265 18 h treatment at interim and \u2265 36 h treatment at\nfinal) and attended all visits. Mean change values and 95% CIs are plotted for\neach arm. All data points with CIs are substantially below the zero line,\nsupporting that bimodal neuromodulation with sound and tongue stimulation\nachieves significant reduction in tinnitus symptoms that is sustained for 12\nmonths after treatment ended. For clearer visualization, data points and error\nbars were jittered in time.\n\nFull size image\n\nFigure 5\n\nAdditional reduction in tinnitus symptoms with adjustment of parameter\nsettings at the midway point during treatment. Absolute THI or TFI scores\n(distribution of values as violin plots) are presented at different time\npoints during the treatment period at Week 0 (baseline), Week 6 (interim),\nWeek 12 (final) and Week 64 (12-month post-treatment) for pooled data across\narm 1 and arm 2 for THI (a) and TFI (b). Data is included for participants who\nwere treatment-compliant (\u2265 18 h treatment at interim and \u2265 36 h treatment at\nfinal) and correspond to the same data shown in Fig. 4. Different stimulus\ncombinations were implemented in the first versus second 6-week period.\nAsterisks correspond to significant reductions in THI or TFI scores based on a\nWilcoxon signed-rank test (P < 0.05). Significant P-values accounting for\nmultiple comparisons based on the Bonferroni correction are labeled with\nasterisks in order from left to right in each plot: (a) P < 0.00001, P <\n0.00001; (b) P < 0.00001, P = 0.0047.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Different bimodal parameter settings improve tinnitus symptoms over time\n\nFor the primary endpoints, comparisons were performed for within-arm and\nbetween-arm changes in THI and TFI for arm 1 and arm 2. From those analyses,\nwe determined that significant therapeutic effects are achievable when\nproviding bimodal neuromodulation using tongue stimulation combined with only\npure tones (i.e., without requiring background noise stimuli) and with varying\ninterstimulus delays of up to 800 ms. A fixed tone-to-tongue spatial mapping\nwas also not essential for improving tinnitus symptoms with bimodal\nneuromodulation.\n\nIncluding two exploratory arms (arm 3 and arm 4) in the study design enabled\ntwo additional questions regarding the therapeutic efficacy of different\nstimulation parameters to be further investigated. The first explored whether\nsimultaneously presented tones are sufficient to drive therapeutic effects. In\nthe first half of the 12-week treatment period, PS7 was used in arm 3, which\nconsisted of four inharmonic-related tones instead of a single or\nharmonically-related dual tone as occurred for the other arms. The second\nquestion investigated the contribution of the tongue stimulation component on\ntreatment efficacy. Arm 4 comprised the PS9 parameter setting, which included\nonly the sound component of PS6 presented in arm 2 and excluded tongue\nstimulation. These exploratory arms serve to identify interesting research\nhypotheses to be tested in future studies.\n\nFigure 6 presents the within-arm changes in THI and TFI scores from baseline\nto the 6-week assessment for all four arms. Arm 1 and arm 2 data from Fig. 3\nare included again to enable visual comparison of the results across parameter\nsettings. Interestingly, PS7 in arm 3 exhibited variable effects on tinnitus\nsymptoms (i.e., represented by the wide 95% CI bars in Fig. 6a); however,\nthese wider CIs may be attributed to the smaller sample size in arm 3 compared\nto the other arms that will need to be confirmed in a larger future study. THI\nand TFI scores for each participant and for each arm are shown in\nSupplementary Fig. S7. Another interesting observation from Fig. 6a is that\narm 4 with only sound stimulation achieves small to moderate improvements in\ntinnitus symptoms with an average reduction of 8.0 points for THI and 5.5\npoints for TFI (small Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes of \u2212 0.2 to \u2212 0.4). This\ncontrasts with the larger mean reduction of about 12 points for THI and about\n12 points for TFI in arm 1 and arm 2 with bimodal stimulation (Cohen\u2019s d of \u2212\n0.6 to \u2212 0.8, corresponding to moderate to large effect sizes). These initial\ndata support the potential criticality of combining tongue stimulation with\nsound to drive additional therapeutic benefit for tinnitus.\n\nFigure 6\n\nWithin-arm analyses for the four different arms at 6-weeks and at 12-weeks.\n(a) The mean difference in THI or TFI score across participants for each arm\nfrom baseline to 6-week assessment are plotted with the \u00b1 95% CI. Within-arm\nanalyses were based on a per-protocol analysis that included treatment-\ncompliant participants (\u2265 18 h treatment at 6-weeks) with baseline and 6-week\nscores (note that the baseline score corresponds to the average of the scores\nat screening and enrollment visits). Within-arm analyses for all arms, except\nfor arm 3 for THI and arm 4 for TFI, showed a statistically significant\nreduction in THI or TFI score (i.e., improvement in tinnitus symptom severity)\nbased on paired two-tailed t-tests (P < 0.05; 95% CI does not overlap the\nvertical line at zero). Cohen\u2019s d effect size and 95% CI are also listed for\neach arm for THI and TFI. Parameter settings (see Supplementary Table S1 for\ndetails): arm 1\u2014PS1 (synchronized bimodal stimulation, includes pure tones and\nbackground noise stimuli); arm 2\u2014PS6 (includes only pure tones with no\nbackground noise stimuli and with varied interstimulus delays in the range of\n700\u2013800 ms); arm 3\u2014PS7 (same as PS6 except four tones presented simultaneously\nover a larger frequency range); arm 4\u2014PS9 (same sound stimuli as in PS6 but no\ntongue stimulation). (b) Similar to (a) except data is presented from baseline\nto 12-week assessment for treatment-compliant participants (\u2265 36 h treatment\nat 12-weeks). Parameter settings (see Supplementary Table S1 for details): arm\n1\u2014PS1 changed to PS4 (includes pure tones and background noise stimuli and\nwith varied interstimulus delays in the range of 0\u201330 ms); arm 2\u2014PS6 changed\nto PS10 (includes only wideband noise stimuli without pure tones and with\nvaried interstimulus delays in the range of 0\u201330 ms); arm 3\u2014PS7 changed to PS4\n(includes pure tones and background noise stimuli and with varied\ninterstimulus delays in the range of 0\u201330 ms); arm 4\u2014PS9 changed to PS6 (same\nsound stimuli as PS9 with addition of tongue stimulation).\n\nFull size image\n\nAs with arm 1 and arm 2, the stimulation setting was changed between the first\nand second halves of the 12-week treatment period for arm 3 and arm 4. For arm\n3, changing PS7 to PS4 did not reduce the variability in outcomes observed\nduring the first 6 weeks of treatment, though there was a further reduction in\nmean THI and TFI scores (about \u2212 11 points down to about \u2212 16 points; Fig.\n6b). For arm 4, following the 6 weeks of sound-only stimulation with 6 weeks\nof bimodal stimulation (PS9 to PS6) resulted in an equivalent 12-week\nimprovement as occurred with the other arms (\u2212 21.2 points for THI and \u2212 16.9\npoints for TFI). In particular, the addition of tongue stimulation to sound\nstimulation led to substantial improvements in Cohen\u2019s d from \u2212 0.4 to \u2212 1.0\nfor THI and \u2212 0.2 to \u2212 0.6 for TFI (Fig. 6). Figure 7 further shows\nsignificant within-arm improvements in THI or TFI between interim and final\nvisits after adding tongue stimulation to sound stimulation. These preliminary\nresults support the criticality of combining tongue stimulation with sound in\nbimodal stimulation to drive additional benefit for tinnitus, which can be\nvalidated in a proceeding confirmatory study.\n\nFigure 7\n\nChanges in tinnitus symptom severity for arm 4 between interim and final\nvisits after adding tongue stimulation to sound-only stimulation. Mean change\nin THI or TFI and 95% CIs are plotted between 6-week (interim) and 12-week\n(final) visits for all participants who were compliant to treatment (defined\nas \u2265 18 h at interim and \u2265 36 h at final). There is a significant improvement\nin tinnitus symptom severity after adding tongue stimulation (PS6) to sound-\nonly stimulation (PS9), supporting the criticality of combining tongue\nstimulation with sound to drive additional therapeutic benefit for tinnitus.\nPost-hoc statistical analysis was based on a paired two-tailed t-test (P <\n0.05; 95% CI does not overlap the vertical line at zero; P = 0.0039 for THI\nand P = 0.0180 for TFI). Cohen\u2019s d effect size and 95% CI are also listed for\nTHI and TFI on the right side of the figure. Note that n is equal to 13\ninstead of 14 as in Fig. 6 for arm 4 because compliance criteria of both 18 h\nand 36 h (rather than just one of them) must be satisfied by each participant\nto be included in the analysis.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe individual THI and TFI scores for each participant across all four arms\nare shown in Supplementary Fig. S8 and are consistent with the findings and\ninterpretations related to Fig. 6b. Across all arms and at the end of\ntreatment, the Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes ranged from \u2212 1.0 to \u2212 1.4 for THI and \u2212\n0.6 to \u2212 1.0 for TFI (listed in Fig. 6b). Furthermore, 95.0% of treatment-\ncompliant participants (n = 160) had improvements in THI score and 84.4% of\ntreatment-compliant participants (n = 160) had improvements in TFI score at\nthe end of treatment (Fig. 8a,b). This high percentage of responders was\nsustained out to 12 months after treatment ended, with 91.0% and 84.7%\nexhibiting improvements in THI and TFI, respectively (Fig. 8c,d; n = 111).\nOverall, these findings demonstrate that different bimodal stimulus components\nand parameters that are adjusted over time achieve significant and long-term\nimprovements in tinnitus symptoms in a large percentage of treatment-compliant\nparticipants using the Lenire neuromodulation device.\n\nFigure 8\n\nLong-term clinical efficacy of bimodal neuromodulation.

Adverse event type, seriousness,\nrelationship to study device, and whether or not an adverse event was\nanticipated was adjudicated by an independent device safety physician employed\nby Covance by Labcorp with support from the investigators and Medical Review\nBoard. An adverse event (AE) or a serious adverse event (SAE) was classified\nin line with ISO 14155:2011/MEDDEV2.7, and grouped into three relatedness\ncategories: device related, probably device related, and possibly device\nrelated (definitions are provided in \u201cMethods\u201d).\n\nIn this study, there were no treatment-related SAEs. We list the AEs\npotentially related to treatment across all arms for this study in Table 2.\nThere was a total of 156 treatment-related AEs, with 13 classified as related\nto the device, 58 being probably related to the device, and 85 being possibly\nrelated to the device. Of the different AEs, the most common was an increase\nin tinnitus symptoms, with a total of 79 AEs. This number corresponds to 71\nunique individuals (i.e., a single participant could have more than one AE for\nincreased tinnitus symptoms that occurred at different stages during and after\ntreatment). Table 3 further classifies the increased tinnitus AEs based on the\narm and stage of treatment (based on a total of 71 cases that occurred during\ntreatment across the two stages listed). For the first 6-week period of\ntreatment from enrollment to interim, there was no significant difference in\nrates across arms for increased tinnitus AEs (P > 0.05; Fisher\u2019s exact test).\nThere was also no significant difference in rates across arms during treatment\nfrom interim to final (P > 0.05). Bimodal stimulation did not result in any\nnoticeable differences in rate of increased tinnitus AEs compared to the\nsound-only condition (first row of data in Table 3), suggesting that this type\nof AE is associated with the sound component rather than the tongue component.\nIn a recent large-scale study characterizing the natural history of tinnitus\nin adults, 9% of participants (94 out of 1039) reported a worsening of their\ntinnitus^24; thus, a proportion of these increased tinnitus AEs are likely due\nto natural variation in tinnitus symptoms over time. Increase in tinnitus was\nself-reported by participants during compliance calls or directly to the\ninvestigation team either at a clinic visit or in between clinic visits if\nparticipants experienced that their tinnitus was louder or more bothersome.\nThere were also several cases of different types of AEs involving the mouth or\ntongue area. Any unanticipated AEs that were not described in the clinical\nstudy documents or expected from the previous TENT-A1 study^11 are listed in\nTable 4. Of the 156 treatment-related AEs, 135 AEs were resolved with the\nparticipants by the end of the study. The remaining 21 AEs correspond to 18\nunique individuals where 12 of them were referred to the appropriate medical\nprofessional during or at the end of the study. Six of the 18 individuals\ncould no longer be contacted during the study.\n\nTable 2 Safety data (AEs) recorded throughout the study. There were no\ntreatment related SAEs.\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 3 Percentage of participants with increased tinnitus AE for each arm and\nstage of treatment relating to AEs listed in Table 2. P-values were calculated\nfor comparing across arms using Fisher's exact test. There were 71 total cases\nfor the two stages listed (8 additional cases occurred outside of these two\nstages).\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 4 Unanticipated treatment related AEs listed in Table 2.\n\nFull size table\n\nOverall, the treatment proved to be safe and well tolerated with no SAEs and a\nhigh satisfaction rate across a large cohort of participants. A high\npercentage of participants used the device for at least the minimum compliance\nof 18 h over the first 6 weeks of treatment (86.4% of 191 across arms) and a\ncompliance of at least 36 h over the entire 12-week treatment period (83.8% of\n191; Supplementary Fig. S2). At the end of treatment, participants were asked\n\u201cOverall, would you say you have benefitted from using this device?\u201d Out of\n172 responses, 70.3% indicated \u201cYes\u201d (121 responders; Fig. 9a). They were also\nasked \u201cIf you knew someone with tinnitus, would you recommend they try this\ntreatment?\u201d Out of 172 responses, 87.8% indicated \u201cYes\u201d (151 recommenders;\nFig. 9b). Not all 191 participants were available to answer these two\nquestions (i.e., no responses from 19 individuals), in which some of them may\nnot have benefited from the treatment. Even if assuming that all 19\nindividuals were non-responders of treatment, this worst-case scenario would\nstill result in 63.4% (121 out of 191) benefiting from treatment, along with\n79.1% (151 out of 191) having a positive enough experience with the Lenire\ndevice to recommend it to others suffering from tinnitus. These high\ncompliance and satisfaction rates, when compared to the reported AEs, support\na strong benefit-to-risk profile for this medical device treatment for\ntinnitus.\n\nFigure 9\n\nSatisfaction rates in using treatment device. Two questions relating to the\nparticipant\u2019s satisfaction (a) or acceptability (b) of the treatment device\nwere asked at the final visit when the treatment ended, in which the\npercentage of YES or NO responses are shown. The \u201cother\u201d category refers to\ncases where the participant could not answer YES or NO or did not feel\ncomfortable in committing to an answer.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe TENT-A2 study was designed to investigate the effects of different sound\nand tongue stimuli on reducing tinnitus symptom severity over time. The study\nwas statistically powered to compare two treatment arms (arm 1 and arm 2) to\ndetermine whether background wideband noise was necessary for bimodal\ntreatment efficacy. An additional objective was to determine whether adjusting\nthe parameter settings at the midpoint of the 12-week treatment regimen could\ndrive additional therapeutic benefits. In the TENT-A2 study, we observed\nsignificant improvements in tinnitus symptoms for both arms within 6 weeks of\ninitiating treatment. In arm 1 there was a mean reduction in THI and TFI score\nof 12.9 and 11.6 points, respectively, and in arm 2 there was a mean reduction\nof 11.5 and 11.7 points, respectively (Fig. 6a; Cohen\u2019s d of \u2212 0.6 to \u2212 0.8,\ncorresponding with moderate to large effect sizes^23). There was no\nsignificant difference in outcomes between arm 1 and arm 2 for THI or TFI.\nAlthough this null difference does not reveal which parameter setting is\nsuperior (i.e., arm 1 versus arm 2), the within-arm results confirm that the\nbackground noise component is not necessary for achieving significant\nreductions in tinnitus symptom severity with bimodal stimulation.\n\nOne major discovery from the TENT-A2 study is that changing the parameter\nsettings during the second 6-week period of the 12-week treatment, regardless\nof the stimulus features within the first 6 weeks of treatment, significantly\ndrives additional improvements in tinnitus symptoms (Fig. 5). At the end of\ntreatment, Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes could reach as large as \u2212 1.4 for THI and \u2212\n1.0 for TFI (Fig. 6b), which are considered large effect sizes^23. These\nresults confirm that adjusting parameter settings over time can provide\nadditional therapeutic benefit and opens up new opportunities for enhancing\nclinical outcomes with the Lenire device. Furthermore, the results confirm\nthat these enhanced therapeutic benefits can be sustained out to 12 months\nafter the end of treatment (Fig. 8).\n\nAnother objective of the TENT-A2 study was to reproduce the safety, efficacy,\ntreatment compliance and patient satisfaction results from the earlier TENT-A1\nstudy^11. While there was a similarly high compliance rate of about 84% for\nthe 12-week treatment for both studies, we observed better efficacy values in\nthis TENT-A2 study compared to the previous TENT-A1 study. We attribute this\nfinding to the additional therapeutic benefit achieved by adjusting parameter\nsettings midway through the treatment period. We believe that this new\nstimulation strategy overcomes the treatment habituation effects observed in\nthe TENT-A1 study, where there were diminishing improvements in the second\n6-weeks using the same stimulation setting for the full 12-week treatment\nperiod. The mean reduction in THI and TFI scores ranged from 14.2 to 21.2\npoints in the TENT-A2 study, whereas THI and TFI scores ranged from 13.2 to\n14.6 points in the TENT-A1 study. In terms of percentage of responders, 95.0%\nof treatment-compliant participants (n = 160) had improvements in THI score\nand 84.4% of treatment-compliant participants (n = 160) had improvements in\nTFI score at the end of treatment in the TENT-A2 study. For the TENT-A1 study,\n86.2% of treatment-compliant participants (n = 260) had improvements in THI\nscore and 81.3% of treatment-compliant participants (n = 256) had improvements\nin TFI score at the end of treatment. Furthermore, 70.3% of participants in\nthe TENT-A2 study reported a benefit from bimodal treatment compared to the\n66.5% of participants in the TENT-A1 study; also, 87.8% would recommend the\ntreatment to other tinnitus sufferers in the TENT-A2 study compared to the\n77.8% in the TENT-A1 study. Both studies were consistent in terms of the\nsafety profile of the Lenire device, in which the highest percentage of AEs\nwere associated with increased tinnitus during or after the treatment period.\nThere were several AEs in the TENT-A2 study that were unanticipated (see Table\n4), but they were not serious AEs and the Lenire device still exhibited a\nstrong benefit-to-risk profile as was observed in the previous TENT-A1 study.\n\nTwo additional arms (arm 3 and arm 4) were included in the study to further\nexplore the effects of different stimulus features on tinnitus treatment. Arm\n3 included a different type of sound stimulus than used in the other arms, in\nwhich four inharmonic-related tones were presented simultaneously instead of\nsingle tones or dual harmonically-related tones. Arm 2 included what we view\nas the minimalist setting (PS6) for bimodal neuromodulation that includes\ntongue stimulation with only pure tones (no background noise component). Arm 4\nfurther dissected out the contribution of bimodal stimulus features on\ntinnitus treatment by removing tongue stimulation from PS6 (referred to as\nPS9). The sound component in PS6 and PS9 were identical. There were two main\nobservations for the results from arm 3 and arm 4. First, the use of complex\ntone stimuli appeared to introduce wide variability in outcomes in tinnitus\nsymptoms, in which some participants exhibited large improvements while others\nexperienced minimal improvements in THI and TFI scores. This finding suggests\nthat the type of tone stimuli may lead to different outcomes across tinnitus\npatients. Second, sound-only stimulation (without tongue stimulation) resulted\nin small improvements in tinnitus symptoms relative to what was observed for\nbimodal neuromodulation (Cohen\u2019s d of \u2212 0.2 to \u2212 0.4 for sound alone compared\nto \u2212 0.6 to \u2212 1.0 for bimodal stimulation). Adding tongue stimulation to\nsound-only stimulation achieved additional improvements in tinnitus symptoms,\nas shown in Fig. 7. These results suggest that tongue stimulation plays a\ncritical role in driving significant therapeutic effects for tinnitus\ntreatment.\n\nThe overall findings from this TENT-A2 study indicate that a diverse range of\nelectrical and sound stimulus combinations can significantly improve tinnitus\nsymptoms and aligns with findings from previous animal and human research on\nbimodal neuromodulation^7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Animal studies have shown\nthat sound stimulation paired with electrical stimulation of different body\nlocations (or related nerves), such as the face, neck, ear, tongue, back and\nlimbs can all drive extensive neural plasticity across the auditory pathway,\nincluding in the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus and auditory\ncortex^7,8,10,13,14,15,16. Both pure tone bursts and wideband noise bursts can\nbe effective at driving significant auditory plasticity with bimodal\nneuromodulation. There is also increasing evidence that a diverse range of\nbimodal stimulation patterns can drive greater plasticity within the auditory\nsystem and lead to larger reductions in tinnitus symptoms compared to sound-\nonly stimulation^7,8,13,16. For example, one study in a tinnitus animal model\nhas shown that bimodal stimulation with single pure tones (e.g., 8 kHz) paired\nwith electrical stimulation of the neck region with a specific interstimulus\ndelay of 5 ms elicits neural plasticity and improvements in behavior\nassociated with tinnitus to a larger extent than achieved with sound\nstimulation alone^7. Another study in animals demonstrated that bimodal\nstimulation with wideband noise paired with electrical stimulation of the\ntongue, neck or mastoid region with different interstimulus delays elicits\nneural plasticity within the auditory cortex or inferior colliculus that is\nabout double of what is achieved with sound stimulation alone^8. These animal\nresults are consistent with recent findings in humans using bimodal\nneuromodulation to treat tinnitus. In 20 human participants, bimodal\nneuromodulation with a complex sound stimulus (i.e., frequency spectrum\nmatched to the tinnitus percept instead of a single pure tone) paired with\nelectrical stimulation of the neck or face region reduced tinnitus symptoms by\nabout 2 to 3 times more than sound stimulation alone^7. In the current TENT-A2\nstudy, bimodal stimulation with several different sound stimuli paired with\ntongue stimulation with different interstimulus delays also drove reductions\nin tinnitus symptoms that was about double of what was observed with sound\nstimulation alone. In summary, these findings across animal and human studies\nprovide consistent evidence that multiple types of sound stimuli paired with\nelectrical stimulation of different body regions using a range of\ninterstimulus delays can all be effective at treating tinnitus that exhibit\ngreater auditory plasticity and improvements in tinnitus symptoms than\nachieved with sound stimulation alone.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design\n\nThe study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, four-arm parallel study\nto determine the contribution of different features of bimodal stimulation on\nclinical outcome and to investigate the therapeutic effects of changing\nparameter settings over time for a 12-week tinnitus treatment regimen. The\nTENT-A2 study was conducted as a follow-up to the earlier TENT-A1 trial^11. As\nboth trials assessed the same device, with additional parameters sets in\nTENT-A2 compared to TENT-A1; the study design, recruitment of participants,\nand statistical methodology of both trials are comparable. The description of\nmethods in the following sections are similar to the published TENT-A1\ntrial^11 with additional details on specific procedures applied in the TENT-A2\nstudy.\n\nIn TENT-A2, study participants were recruited to the clinical trial using\nradio advertising and directed to an online eligibility assessment.\nEligibility was initially assessed through a set of general pre-screening\nquestions to manage the large number of candidates expected to respond to the\nadvertising^22. Of these potential participants, 462 signed an informed\nconsent and attended a clinical screening visit. All candidates were assigned\na Unique Identifier Code (UIC) to ensure that files and data could be managed\nin a de-identified manner throughout the study. Of the 462 candidates (Fig.\n2), 194 individuals were randomized to the different treatment arms of which\n192 of them attended the enrollment visit. One participant was withdrawn at\nthe enrollment visit by the investigators due to a previously undisclosed\nmedical condition. Out of 191, 79 participants were allocated to arm 1 and 80\nparticipants were allocated to arm 2 that are relevant for the primary\nendpoint analyses.\n\nWhen participants returned for their enrollment visit, we performed several\ntinnitus assessments and health evaluations. Each participant was then fitted\nwith a Lenire device (CE-marked Class IIa; Neuromod Devices, Dublin, Ireland)\nand provided a training session on how to use the device. Participants did not\nreceive any other tinnitus education or counselling during the course of the\nstudy. The take-home device was self-administered by the participants with a\nrecommended use of two 30-min sessions per day over a 12-week period. These\ntwo sessions could be performed consecutively or at different times during the\nday. Outcome measures and health evaluations were performed at interim (6-week\nvisit) and at final (12-week visit at end of treatment). Participants returned\ntheir devices at the 12-week visit and were invited for post-treatment\nassessments at Week 18 (6-week follow-up), Week 38 (6-month follow-up) and\nWeek 64 (12-month follow-up). Safety information was collected throughout the\nstudy with any adverse events recorded from screening to the 12-month follow-\nup assessment. There were also two compliance phone calls at Week 3 and Week 9\nof the study to remind participants of the recommended use instructions.\nCompliance to treatment for the primary endpoint analyses was defined as\ndevice usage of at least 18 h by the 6-week interim assessment, with an\nadditional treatment compliance criterion of at least 36 h by the 12-week\nfinal assessment for other analyses presented in this paper and based on\nprevious publications^11,21. The study timeline is depicted in Fig. 1b with\nthe number of participants attending and completing assessments for each arm\nlisted in Fig. 2 and Table 1.\n\nFor randomization of participants to the four different treatment arms\n(5:5:1:1), stratification was performed based on four binary categories\nobtained at screening and using the minimization method^25, as described in\nthe published protocol paper^21. These categories include: (1) hyperacusis as\ndefined as having a sound level tolerance (or loudness discomfort level, LDL)\nthat was less than 60 dB sensation level (SL) for a pure tone presented at 500\nHz in either ear (dB SL equals dB HL minus hearing threshold level of sound\nstimulus); (2) hyperacusis with a LDL less than 70 dB SL; (3) high THI with a\nscore of greater than 56 points; (4) unilateral tinnitus; and (5) participants\nwho do not fall in any of the previous categories. Since we did not\nincorporate additional clinical criteria and questionnaire data relevant for\nclassifying hyperacusis into the stratification process, this category should\nbe interpreted more strictly as a sound sensitivity condition specific to 500\nHz rather than what is typically considered as hyperacusis. The word\n\u201chyperacusis\u201d is still used throughout this paper to remain consistent with\nthe previously published stratification terminology for the clinical study^21.\n\nSimilar to that in TENT-A1^11, the Lenire device delivered sound wirelessly\nvia Bluetooth headphones while electrical stimulation was delivered to the\nsurface of the tongue using a wired 32-site electrode array (Fig. 1a). The\ntransmission delay via the Bluetooth headphones was extensively characterized\nand, accordingly, the Lenire device compensated for the timing variations\nbetween sound and tongue stimulation. The delay variation was maintained\nwithin \u00b1 3 ms, with mean delay variation for each treatment session staying\nwithin \u00b1 2 ms. Electrical stimulation was delivered in the form of biphasic,\nanodic-leading pulses between approximately 5 and 210 \u03bcs duration and with a\nfixed amplitude. The sound volume range and electrical tongue stimulation\nintensities were customized to each participant\u2019s sensation thresholds. The\nparticipant\u2019s pure-tone audiometric thresholds (250 Hz to 8 kHz) were measured\nat the screening visit (Supplementary Fig. S1) and subsequently used to\nconfigure the intensity of the auditory stimuli to ~ 10 dB SL (i.e., ~ 10 dB\nabove their hearing threshold at each tone frequency). The participant could\nadjust the default auditory stimulus intensity between -12 dB and + 12 dB\nduring treatment using volume buttons on the controller. For safety reasons,\nthe upper stimulus intensity was limited for participants commensurate with\nthe degree of hearing loss. For those with severe to profound hearing loss,\nauditory stimuli did not exceed a time-weighted average of about 90 dBA, and\nfor those with normal or mild hearing loss, stimuli did not exceed a time-\nweighted average of about 70 dBA. Electrical stimulation intensity was\nconfigured for each participant by adjusting the intensity from sub-threshold\nto supra-threshold sensations to a comfortable intensity across different\nelectrodes, which was when the participant could feel sensations on the tongue\nbut below an intensity that was bothersome or painful. This comfortable\nintensity was used as the calibrated setting, and the participant could adjust\nthe electrical stimulation intensity down to 60% and up to 160% of this\ncalibrated setting using buttons on the controller. The treatment device\nreverted to the default intensities at the start of each new session.\n\nThe sequential stimulus settings utilized in this study for each arm during\nthe first and second 6-week stages of the 12-week treatment period are\ndescribed in detail in Supplementary Table S1. Briefly, PS1 followed by PS4\nwas used in arm 1, PS6 followed by PS10 was used in arm 2, PS7 followed by PS4\nwas used in arm 3, and PS9 followed by PS6 was used in arm 4. PS1 was\nidentical to the parameter setting used in the previous TENT-A1 study^11 that\nconsisted of tongue stimulation temporally and spatially synchronized with\ndifferent pure tones with additional background wideband noise. PS4 was\nsimilar to PS1, except that there were short delays between sound and tongue\nstimulation as well as a randomized tone-to-tongue spatial mapping. In\nTENT-A1, a stimulation strategy similar to PS4 still showed significant\nimprovements in tinnitus symptoms; thus, PS4 provided an alternative\nstimulation pattern than PS1 that could potentially overcome the habituation\neffects observed in TENT-A1 during the second 6-weeks of treatment. PS6\nconsisted of only pure tones paired with tongue stimulation with longer\ninterstimulus delays than used in PS4 and without any background noise\ncomponent, which was designed to address one of the main objectives of the\nstudy as described in the Introduction. PS10 was similar to PS4, except that\nnoise burst stimuli were presented instead of pure tones for the sound\ncomponent in order to assess if use of only noise stimuli could potentially\novercome habituation effects if PS4 was not sufficient. PS7 was similar to PS6\nexcept that four simultaneous tones across a larger frequency range were used\nfor the sound stimulus instead of single or dual tones in order to explore if\ngreater diversity in tonal input could affect clinical outcomes. PS9 consisted\nof the exact same sound stimuli as in PS6 but without tongue stimulation,\nwhich allowed assessment of the effects of the addition of the tongue\ncomponent on improving tinnitus symptoms.\n\nAEs were documented, and categorized in relation to type, seriousness,\nrelationship to the study device, and whether or not an AE was anticipated.\nThe AEs were classified in line with ISO 14155:2011/MEDDEV2.7 and informed by\nthe US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Volume 8, Section 812 where\ndefinitions are absent in ISO14155:2011. These AEs were then further grouped\ninto three relatedness categories. Device related was defined as an AE\nassociated with the investigational device, or with procedures beyond\nreasonable doubt. Probably device related was defined as having a relationship\nwith the use of the investigational device, or the relationship with\nprocedures, that seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably\nexplained by another cause. Possibly device related was defined as having a\nrelationship with the use of the investigational device or relationship with\nthe procedures that was weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative\ncauses are also possible (e.g., an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical\ncondition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment). Cases where\nrelatedness cannot be assessed, or no information has been obtained should\nalso be classified as possible. Assessments of causality were made by an\nindependent device safety physician.\n\n### Participants\n\nThe study recruited participants with chronic subjective tonal tinnitus.\nChronic subjective tinnitus is a phantom auditory percept that is attributable\nto abnormal firing patterns in the brain^1. Subjective tinnitus differs from\nobjective tinnitus, which is typically associated with sounds generated from\nvasculature or pulsation anomalies, abnormal muscle contractions or head/jaw\nmovements^1. For screening, participants who were between the age range of 18\nand 70 years and with a tinnitus duration between 3 months and 10 years were\nincluded in the study. We recruited participants with THI scores of 38 to 100\npoints and a Minimum Masking Level (MML) measurement between 20 and 80 dB HL.\nMML was determined by presenting a wide-band noise at increasing intensities\nuntil the sound stimulus masked the participant\u2019s tinnitus. We required that\nthe candidates have a maximum hearing loss of 40 dB HL in the measurement\nfrequencies in the range of 250 Hz to 1 kHz or of 80 dB HL in the measurement\nfrequencies in the range of 2\u20138 kHz for both ears. To be eligible,\nparticipants had to be able to read and understand English and provide\ninformed consent. They were also required to be willing to commit to the full\nduration of the study.\n\nCandidates were excluded if they had objective tinnitus or somatic tinnitus\ncaused by a head or neck injury, or if their tinnitus was comorbid with a\nneurological condition as assessed by a medical professional. Abnormal\notoscopy or abnormal tympanometry was another exclusion criterion. Further\nexclusions included candidates with: a hearing aid used within 90 days prior\nto eligibility assessment, any type of electro-active implantable device, a\nloudness discomfort level of < 30 dB SL at 500 Hz for either ear, a\ntemporomandibular joint disorder, anxiety determined by a score > 120 out of\n160 on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)^26,27, or moderate to severe\ndementia as indicated by a score < 20 on the Mini-Mental State Examination\n(MMSE)^28. A final set of exclusion criteria based on a medical history taken\nat the screening assessment were: Meniere\u2019s disease, oral piercings,\npregnancy, involvement in medico-legal cases, history of auditory\nhallucinations, current prescription of a drug for a central nervous system\npathology, and previous use of a Neuromod Devices\u2019 product. If deemed as not a\nsuitable candidate by the investigators of the study, a participant could also\nbe excluded for other reasons not listed above.\n\n### Clinical study endpoints\n\nThe primary endpoint analyses used the THI for performing within-arm and\nbetween-arm comparisons for arm 1 and arm 2 from start of treatment to the\n6-week assessment^21. TFI was also used for within-arm comparisons for arm 1\nfor the primary endpoint analyses. The THI^17,18 and TFI^20 are clinical\noutcome measures commonly used to assess tinnitus symptom severity^19. These\noutcome measures have been used across multiple studies that have supported\nclinical guidelines for tinnitus interventions^5,29. The only clinically\nrecommended treatment specifically for tinnitus, cognitive behavioral therapy,\nhas also leveraged these multi-item questionnaires for evidence that it is an\neffective tinnitus intervention^29.\n\nThe THI predominantly assesses the emotional and functional impact of\ntinnitus, in which 25 items are scored 4/2/0 on a categorical scale\ncorresponding to yes/sometimes/no. The global score of the THI (i.e., sum of\npoints across all 25 items) has a value from 0 to 100, with a higher score\nindicating a greater negative impact of tinnitus. Relating to the inclusion\nand exclusion criteria, participants can be enrolled if they have a THI score\nof 38\u2013100 at the screening visit, which includes moderate (38\u201356), severe\n(58\u201376), and catastrophic (78\u2013100) groups. Participants are excluded if they\nare in the no/slight handicap (0\u201316) or mild (18\u201336) group; thus, those who\nare less likely to seek Lenire treatment in the real-world clinical setting.\nThere were 62.3%, 30.4%, and 7.3% in the moderate, severe, and catastrophic\ngroup, respectively (out of 191 enrolled participants).\n\nThe TFI assesses a range of tinnitus-related functional complaints experienced\nover the week prior to assessment. Each of the 25 items is assessed on an\n11-point Likert scale, and the sum of the scores is normalized to give a\nglobal score from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a greater negative\nimpact of tinnitus.\n\nAn additional efficacy endpoint of the study was to determine the therapeutic\neffects of changing the stimulation parameters over time. The study was\nspecifically designed to assess this endpoint in which one parameter setting\nwas provided to each participant during the first half of treatment and a\ndifferent parameter setting was provided during the second half of treatment\n(Fig. 1). THI and TFI scores could then be compared across baseline, interim\nand final visits to confirm if adjusting stimulus settings over time could\ndrive additional therapeutic benefit during the treatment period.\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nThe primary endpoints and analyses of the study are described in a previously\npublished protocol paper^21. Primary efficacy analyses included within-arm\nchanges in THI and TFI scores in the full cohort of participants from baseline\n(average scores at screening and enrollment) to interim (initial 6 weeks of\ntreatment) for arm 1. To account for multiple comparisons, the a priori\nsignificance level (alpha) of 0.05 was distributed across several statistical\ntests, in which these within-arm comparisons were allocated an adjusted\nsignificance level of 0.0025. For the primary efficacy analyses, we also\nperformed a between-arm comparison for arm 1 and arm 2 for the changes in THI\nscores from enrollment to interim with an adjusted significance level of\n0.0275. Only THI, which is the most widely implemented tinnitus questionnaire,\nwas used for the between-arm comparison to ensure sufficient allocation of\nalpha level across required comparisons to achieve the objectives of the\nstudy. Both THI and TFI were used for the within-arm comparisons because the\nalpha level allocation was a small enough portion that comparisons could still\nbe implemented for both outcome measures. The remaining portion of the\nsignificance level was allocated to other statistical comparisons for\nsubtyping analyses that will be presented in a subsequent paper and is outside\nthe scope of this paper. Within-arm analyses for an additional endpoint were\nalso performed to compare THI and TFI scores at different time points and\nassess if greater therapeutic effects are achieved by adjusting parameter\nsettings midway through the treatment period. To account for multiple\ncomparisons for this additional endpoint, the Bonferroni correction was\napplied to the statistical analyses. For the within-arm primary efficacy\nanalyses, data from treatment-compliant participants were included. The\nminimum compliance was pre-specified for this study^21 as device usage of at\nleast 18 h by the 6-week interim assessment (and at least 36 h by the 12-week\nfinal assessment for additional analyses), based on efficacy data for the\nLenire treatment in a previous large-scale randomized study^11. The Lenire\ndevice was configured to allow extraction of data in regard to time and date\nof usage, duration of electrode contact with the tongue, and intensities of\nthe auditory and tongue stimuli for each treatment session.\n\nThe within-arm analyses used a per-protocol analysis that was tested with a\npaired two-tailed t-test where assumption of normality was confirmed with the\nShapiro\u2013Wilk test. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for cases that\ndid not satisfy the normality condition. Within-arm effect sizes reported in\nthis paper are based on Cohen\u2019s d and are calculated as the mean score at end\nof treatment minus the mean score at baseline, divided by the pooled SD for\nthe two scores. For between-arm analyses, an intention-to-treat analysis was\nperformed with multiple imputation and tested with multiple regression using\nenrollment scores as a covariate, where normality and equal variance\nassumptions were confirmed with the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and Bartlett\u2019s test,\nrespectively. Missing data was handled by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmultiple imputation method^30,31. For this method, 10 multiple imputed\ndatasets were first generated to fill in missing predictors. This procedure\nwas followed by a second imputation process that estimated the final outcome\nvariable within each imputed dataset. The imputation was based on a multiple\nregression model with multiple predictor variables^11,21. Inferences for the\nbetween-arm endpoints were evaluated on each imputed data set and the results\ncombined to yield the estimates, confidence intervals and associated\nsignificance values.\n\nThere were a few deviations to the protocol in which sensitivity analyses\nconfirmed that the primary endpoints were not affected when including or\nexcluding data from participants associated with those deviations (see\nSupplementary Information S1 for further details).\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are not publicly\navailable due to ethical restrictions [datasets contain pseudonymized special\ncategory health data of EU participants and cannot be available for access]\nbut are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request and with\nappropriate ethics approval.\n\n## Change history\n\n  * ### 10 July 2023\n\nA Correction to this paper has been published:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-38312-5\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nAE:\n\n    \n\nAdverse event\n\nCI:\n\n    \n\nConfidence interval\n\ndB HL:\n\n    \n\nDecibel hearing level\n\ndB SL:\n\n    \n\nDecibel sensation level\n\nFU:\n\n    \n\nFollow-up\n\nHz:\n\n    \n\nHertz\n\nITT:\n\n    \n\nIntention-to-treat\n\nkHz:\n\n    \n\nKilohertz\n\nLDL:\n\n    \n\nLoudness discomfort level\n\n\u03bcs:\n\n    \n\nMicrosecond\n\nms:\n\n    \n\nMillisecond\n\nMMSE:\n\n    \n\nMini-Mental State Examination\n\nMML:\n\n    \n\nMinimum masking level\n\nPPA:\n\n    \n\nPer-protocol analysis\n\nPS#:\n\n    \n\nParameter setting #\n\nSAE:\n\n    \n\nSerious adverse event\n\nSTAI:\n\n    \n\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory\n\nTENT:\n\n    \n\nTreatment Evaluation of Neuromodulation for Tinnitus\n\nTFI:\n\n    \n\nTinnitus Functional Index\n\nTHI:\n\n    \n\nTinnitus Handicap Inventory\n\n## References\n\n  1.
