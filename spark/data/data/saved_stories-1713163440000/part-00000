Thanks to cutting-edge observatories, instruments, and new\ntechniques, scientists are getting closer to experimentally verifying theories\nthat remain largely untested. These theories address some of the most pressing\nquestions scientists have about the Universe and the physical laws governing\nit \u2013 like the nature of gravity, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy. For decades,\nscientists have postulated that either there is additional physics at work or\nthat our predominant cosmological model needs to be revised.\n\nWhile the investigation into the existence and nature of Dark Matter and Dark\nEnergy is ongoing, there are also attempts to resolve these mysteries with the\npossible existence of new physics. In a recent paper, a team of NASA\nresearchers proposed how spacecraft could search for evidence of additional\nphysical within our Solar Systems. This search, they argue, would be assisted\nby the spacecraft flying in a tetrahedral formation and using interferometers.\nSuch a mission could help resolve a cosmological mystery that has eluded\nscientists for over half a century.\n\nThe proposal is the work of Slava G. Turyshev, an adjunct professor of physics\nand astronomy at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and research\nscientist with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He was joined by Sheng-wey\nChiow, an experimental physicist at NASA JPL, and Nan Yu, an adjunct professor\nat the University of South Carolina and a senior research scientist at NASA\nJPL. Their research paper recently appeared online and has been accepted for\npublication in Physical Review D.\n\nA new study shows how measuring the Sun\u2019s gravitational field could search for\nadditional physics.

In previous work, Turyshev and\nhis colleagues have investigated how a mission to the Sun\u2019s solar\ngravitational lens (SGL) could revolutionize astronomy. The concept paper was\nawarded a Phase III grant in 2020 by NASA\u2019s Innovative Advanced Concepts\n(NIAC) program. In a previous study, he and SETI astronomer Claudio Maccone\nalso considered how advanced civilizations could use SGLs to transmit power\nfrom one solar system to the next.\n\nTo summarize, gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where gravitational fields\nalter the curvature of spacetime in their vicinity. This effect was originally\npredicted by Einstein in 1916 and was used by Arthur Eddington in 1919 to\nconfirm his General Relativity (GR). However, between the 1960s and 1990s,\nobservations of the rotational curves of galaxies and the expansion of the\nUniverse gave rise to new theories regarding the nature of gravity over larger\ncosmic scales. On the one hand, scientists postulated the existence of Dark\nMatter and Dark Energy to reconcile their observations with GR.\n\nOn the other hand, scientists have advanced alternate theories of gravity\n(such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), Modified Gravity (MOG), etc.).\nMeanwhile, others have suggested there may be additional physics in the cosmos\nthat we are not yet aware of. As Turyshev told Universe Today via email:\n\n> \u201cWe are eager to explore questions surrounding the mysteries of dark energy\n> and dark matter. Despite their discovery in the last century, their\n> underlying causes remain elusive. Should these \u2018anomalies\u2019 stem from new\n> physics\u2014phenomena yet to be observed in ground-based laboratories or\n> particle accelerators\u2014it\u2019s possible that this novel force could manifest on\n> a solar system scale.\u201d\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of a proposed Solar Gravity Lens telescope.

These investigations, said Turyshev, would search for\ndeviations from the predictions of general relativity at the Solar System\nscale, something that has not been possible to date:\n\n> \u201cThese deviations are hypothesized to manifest as nonzero elements in the\n> gravity gradient tensor (GGT), fundamentally akin to a solution of the\n> Poisson equation. Due to their minuscule nature, detecting these deviations\n> demands precision far surpassing current capabilities\u2014by at least five\n> orders of magnitude. At such a heightened level of accuracy, numerous well-\n> known effects will introduce significant noise. The strategy involves\n> conducting differential measurements to negate the impact of known forces,\n> thereby revealing the subtle, yet nonzero, contributions to the GGT.\u201d\n\nThe mission, said Turyshev, would employ local measurement techniques that\nrely on a series of interferometers. This includes interferometric laser\nranging, a technique demonstrated by the Gravity Recovery and Climate\nExperiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission, a spacecraft pair that relies on\nlaser range finding to track Earth\u2019s oceans, glaciers, rivers, and surface\nwater. The same technique will also be used to investigate gravitational waves\nby the proposed space-based Laser Interferometry Space Antenna (LISA).\n\nThe spacecraft will also be equipped with atom interferometers, which use the\nwave character of atoms to measure the difference in phase between atomic\nmatter waves along different paths. This technique will allow the spacecraft\nto detect the presence of non-gravitational noise (thruster activity, solar\nradiation pressure, thermal recoil forces, etc.) and negate them to the\nnecessary degree. Meanwhile, flying in a tetrahedral formation will optimize\nthe spacecraft\u2019s ability to compare measurements.\n\n> \u201cLaser ranging will offer us highly accurate data on the distances and\n> relative velocities between spacecraft,\u201d said Turyshev. \u201cFurthermore, its\n> exceptional precision will allow us to measure the rotation of a tetrahedron\n> formation relative to an inertial reference frame (via Sagnac observables),\n> a task unachievable by any other means. Consequently, this will establish a\n> tetrahedral formation leveraging a suite of local measurements.\u201d\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of the path of the star S2 as it passes very close to the\nsupermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.

While scientists continue to probe the effect of\ngravitational fields on spacetime, these have been largely confined to using\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters as lenses. Other instances include observations\nof compact objects (like white dwarf stars) and supermassive black holes\n(SMBH) like Sagittarius A* \u2013 which resides at the center of the Milky Way.\n\n> \u201cWe aim to enhance the precision of testing GR and alternative gravitational\n> theories by more than five orders of magnitude. Beyond this primary\n> objective, our mission has additional scientific goals, which we will detail\n> in our subsequent paper. These include testing GR and other gravitational\n> theories, detecting gravitational waves in the micro-Hertz range\u2014a spectrum\n> not reachable by existing or envisioned instruments\u2014 and exploring aspects\n> of the solar system, such as the hypothetical Planet 9, among other\n> endeavors.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading: Physical Review D\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategoriesGravitational Lensing, Physics, sunTagsastrophysics, Cosmology,\nEarth, Featured, General Relativity, gravitational field, Gravitational\nLensing, interferometery, Solar System\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
