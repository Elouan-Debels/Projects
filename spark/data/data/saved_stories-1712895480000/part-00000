And\nyou end up running into a lot of fun experiences (for example, one of my\ninvestments ended up with me wiring ethernet on top of an NFL training\nfacility... not something I signed up for, but really some crazy shit.)\n\n## Did you know you can just say you have a \u201cfund\u201d and that\u2019s all you need to\ndo?\n\nAngel is kind of a weird thing, though: the span of \u201cangel investor\u201d can range\nfrom \u201chere\u2019s a check never talk to me again\u201d to \u201cthey directly helped us make\nthe IPO possible\u201d. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to get lumped in the former when really\nyou want to be known for the latter!\n\nRaising a full venture fund is a huge pain in the ass these days, though, so\nI\u2019m kinda going halfway: running my angel investments as a fund, without\nactually raising the fund. There\u2019s a bunch of brand reasons for this, as well\nas legal entity reasons. It also lets me better prep for raising a fund down\nthe line if I ever want to do that (if at all).\n\nOne nice thing is that since I don\u2019t have LPs, I can continue to do whatever\nthe fuck I want, like include \u201cfuck\u201d in the post announcement. I can also\ninvest in weird areas. Tifo is no different; the two main focuses are devtools\nand sports. Yeah, fucking weird combination, but it\u2019s my fund, dammit, and\nI\u2019ll cry if I want to.\n\nDeveloper tools is pretty obvious if you\u2019re been following along at home over\nthe years: my background of GitHub and GitLab is really unique in the\nindustry, and try as I may, my fifteen years in developer tools hasn\u2019t led me\nto hate the area yet. Far from it: I still hate how we all code, and still\nthink there\u2019s so much to do.\n\nSports might be kind of new to some of you, but I\u2019ve been falling into the\nbusiness side in a deep way the last few years. For one, I\u2019m a co-founder of\nWorkOn, a sports technology startup that will have some really fun things to\nannounce coming up. Secondly... I\u2019ve loved sports all my life (which is\nobvious if you understood the etymology behind Tifo), and I\u2019ve been getting\nfuther into club ownership in football (\u26bd\ufe0f) the last few years. I also think\nmost sports/tech startups are absolute trash. Rather than being disappointing,\nI think that fact is wildly exciting.\n\nSo Tifo. Already instantly the world\u2019s number one sports-and-developer tools\nfund on the planet. If you\u2019re working on something new, shoot me an email and\nlet\u2019s chat: zach@tifo.com.\n\nZach Holman\n\nYou'll want to follow me on Twitter. You can also find me on GitHub and on\nAngelList.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
