Notice an interesting event or trend? Send me a message.\n\nToday, we cover:\n\n  1. Industry pulse. The first mass layoffs at Apple since 1997 (or not?); amateurish URL rewrite at X (formerly Twitter); never-ending job interviews for engineering executives, and more.\n\n  2. The end of Hopin. It took Hopin just two years to become the fastest-ever growing European startup by valuation. Four years later, the company is no more. The final valuable parts of Hopin are being sold, and all staff are expected to be let go. Exclusive details on the StreamYard sale.\n\n  3.

The problem seems to be database-related: \u201csomething, something Oracle.\u201d\n\n  4. Adyen, the only major Fintech with zero mass layoffs? All major Fintech startups have let go of some staff over the past two years, except Adyen. Meanwhile, the business has quietly become one of Stripe\u2019s biggest competitors.
