And why do you wish to do\nso?\n\nPrinter friendly version of this tutorial (*.pdf)\n\nThere are many reasons for grinding your own mirror. Either you want a unusual\nsize, or focal length, or to satisfy your curiosity, or to have the \"pride of\nachievement\" by fabricating something as precise as a telescope mirror. You\ncould also live in a part of the world where telescope optics are not commonly\navailable, and this might be the only way to have a telescope.Does it save\nmoney? Well, that depends. Mostly on the mirror size you wish to grind, and\nthe prices of the local market. In the US, telescope mirrors are the cheapest.\nA decent 6\" (150 mm) mirror can be bought for under 100$. In Europe, prices\nare usually twice, if not three times that. In some countries telescope\nmirrors are unavailable, so they need to be imported, at high shipping,\ncustoms, and tax cost. A 6\" (150 mm ) or 8\" (200 mm) standard quality mirror\nwill be cheaper if bought ready made. 250 mm (10\") probably too.Until you have\npurchased the blank, abrasives, polish, and pitch, your expenses are very near\nto a ready made mirror. The finished mirror needs to be aluminized, there are\nalso shipping costs for this, and of course, your labor. But, as the mirror\nsize grows, prices go sky high. No mass production at these sizes anymore.. A\n400 mm (16\") mirror is practically impossible to find under 2000 \u20ac in Europe .\nPast the 12\" (300 mm) size, grinding your own really pays off. Or, you want to\nmake a super precise, highest quality mirror in the 150-200 mm size.The only\nproblem is, that a 400mm mirror is WAY too large to be your first time mirror\nproject, and your beginner skill is not enough to produce a 1/20 wfe razor\nsharp planetary mirror.  \n---  \n  \nLets learn and practice first\n\nA good starter size is the 150 mm (6\") mirror. A 200mm (8\") will also work.\nMost ATM books and websites recommend a Pyrex\u00ae mirror blank, but in my\nopinion, annealed plate glass is better for this first, \"learn and practice\"\nmirror. It is cheaper, it is softer and grinds faster, needing less abrasives\nand with these small sizes, the low expansion glass like Pyrex has no\npractical (visible at the eyepiece) advantage.  \n---  \n  \nYou might purchase a mirror grinding kit, and have everything you need\nincluded. If such a kit is unavailable, you need to do some scrounging. You\ncan order a 19 mm thick disc at your local glass shop. Such glass is usually\nused for tabletops and window displays. A ship porthole will also do very\nnicely. You can use sandblasting abrasives, make your own polishing pitch. Or\neven silver the finished mirror if aluminizing is unavailable or too\nexpensive.  \n---  \ntypical grinding kit  \n  \nNow you need to decide about the focal length of your future mirror. If you\nare making this mirror to practice your skills for a future, large mirror you\nwant to make, a fast, F4 - F5 mirror is probably your best choice. The future,\nlarge mirror will also be something like F4.5 so this is a good way to\npractice parabolising.If you want to make a mirror that you will turn into\nyour primary, visual use telescope, 1200 mm focal length would be recommended.\nThat would make a 150 mm F8 , or a 200 mm F6 mirror.  \n---  \n  \nFirst phase : rough grinding (or hogging out)\n\nIn this stage of grinding we want to dig out the flat glass blank, in other\nwords, create a saggita. Saggita is a section of a sphere, its radius of\ncurvature (ROC) is TWICE as long as the focal length of the mirror. Example :\na mirror with a 2000 mm ROC will have 1000 mm FL.  \n---  \n  \n\"Depth table\"\n\n150 mm mirror| 200 mm mirror  \n---|---  \nFL= 1200 mm| 1.17 mm| 2.07 mm  \nFL= 1000 mm| 1.4 mm| 2.5 mm  \nFL= 910 mm| 1.55 mm| 2.75 mm  \nFL= 750 mm| 1.87 mm| 3.33 mm  \n  \nAs you can see from the table, the \"faster\" the telescope (shorter focal\nratio) a deeper curve is needed. This of course means that more glass need to\nbe removed, which takes more time and effort. And, parabolising such a fast\ntelescope becomes more difficult. The 200 mm , 750 mm focal lenght mirror\nshown in this table is a bit of a extreme for visual use,... but it might be\nvery good for astrophotography.  \n---  \nTo start hogging out, we need the glass disc, rough grit (#80 typically) and a\ntool. But, before any grinding , the glass disc must be beveled.  \n  \nThe bevel is needed to prevent chipping of the disc edge while grinding. Use a\ntool sharpening stone, wet it with water, and grind at 45 degrees, around the\ndisc, (red arrow) . A 2 mm bevel is enough  \n---  \n  \nMaking a tile tool\n\n\"In the old days\" it was usual that a mirror kit is delivered with 2 glass\nblanks. One as the mirror, and the other as the tool. If you have such a kit,\nsave the second glass, and make a tile tool. Tile tools grind faster, and you\ncan make 2 mirrors instead of one. Or you can share the costs of a mirror kit\nwith a friend and make a mirror each.  \n---  \n  \nA tile tool is a disc poured from cement, with a layer of hard, porcelain\ntiles epoxied on it. Make it the same size as the mirror in diameter, 50 mm\nthickness is fine. Also, it is important to impregnate it. \"Painting\" the\nwhole tool with epoxy or boat varnish will be just fine. On all the ATM\nwebpage's and books you will see neat, equally sized, equally spaced tiles.The\nkey to successful mirror grinding is randomness in stroke numbers and tool and\ndisc rotation. Adding more randomness with a tile tool made from tiles that\nhave been smashed with a hammer cant do any harm :)  \n---  \n  \nAlways work wet! Sprinkle some water on the grit before you start grinding!\nGlass dust is very dangerous and can cause silicosis, a serious lung disease\nif inhaled!  \n---  \n  \nFor hogging out, we start with the \"chordal stroke\" Put the tool on the\nbottom, add half a teaspoon of #80 grit, sprinkle with water and place the\nmirror center near the edge of the tool. Use 1/3 mirror diameter strokes. This\nmeans that stroke is 1/3 length in total , 1/6 forward, 1/6th backwards. For a\n150 mm mirror, 25 mm forward, 25 mm back.  \n---  \n  \nIt is important that the mirror is suspended. A piece of old carpet, a old\ntowel, or a stack of old, wet newspapers will be just fine. This will prevent\nastigmatism due to uneven support of the glass disc...To get a sphere segment\nin the glass disc, we need to rotate both the mirror and the tool. As randomly\nas we can. Example : Make 6 strokes, rotate the mirror 40 degrees clockwise,\nand the tool 30 degrees counterclockwise. Make 7 more strokes, rotate the\nmirror 60 degrees clockwise, and the tool 20 degrees clockwise. Don't think in\ndegrees, nor numbers, just spin it randomly.Rough grit breaks up quite fast,\nYou will know that the grit is used up when the loud , crushing grinding noise\ndisappears. Add more grit, spray with water and continue. Rotate rotate\nrotate! Slowly.. you will see the first indentation starting to appear in the\nglass disc center... To see it and measure it, you need to rinse your mirror,\nand the tool from time to time. Prepare a bucket with water, and rinse your\nglass disc there. Do not rinse it in a sink or similar, because you will be\ncalling the plumber very soon. The used grit and glass mud settles on the\npipes like cement.  \n---  \n  \nAfter a while of grinding with the chordal stroke, you will notice that the\ndisc has developed a depression in the center, but the edges have not, or have\nhardly been touched. Measure your saggita, either with a spherometer if you\nhave one, or put a straight edge over the mirror center and use feeler gauges.  \n---  \n  \nIt is the same thing as the chordal stroke, only now you don't grind with the\nmirror center over the tool edge, go over the center. Again, rotate randomly,\nboth tool and mirror. As soon as the curve has reached the edge, and your\nsaggita is equal or slightly deeper (depending on method you use later) you\ncan go on with the fine grinding.| There are 2 ways to proceed. You can slowly\nreduce your overhang, and convert to the 1/3 center over center stroke, then\nalternate the \"tool on top\" (TOT) and \"mirror on top\" (MOT) to maintain the\nsaggita depth. When MOT , the curve becomes deeper, with TOT it becomes\nshallower.My favorite method is to grind with the chordal stroke a bit deeper\n(0.2-0.3 mm on this mirror size) than the target saggita , then use TOT until\nend of grinding. This saves a lot of grit! As you might noticed by now, much\nof the grit is wasted as it falls in the space between the tiles. Only the\ndepth matters, the edges will get grinded quickly as soon as you turn the tool\non top and grind a with 1/3 center over center strokes.  \n---|---  \nBut first, there is a major cleaning operation ahead :) Close your #80 grit\ncontainer and put it away. In short, you need to clean and dispose of every\nLAST grain of #80 grit from your mirror, your tool, your rinsing bucket, your\nmirror support, and yourself. Pour off the water from your rinsing bucket in\nthe drain, but leave the settled mud. It is very inert, its practically the\nsame as sand. You can throw it away in your garden, no problem.Clean the\nbucket thoroughly. Use a brush and scrub the channels on your tile tool. Clean\neverything, including your spray bottle. One, single grain of #80 grit can\ncause a bad scratch once you move on to finer grit. Also, take a shower,\nchange your clothes, and clean your fingernails before you continue with finer\ngrits.  \n  \nFine grinding\n\nAfter we have hogged out the saggita, we use smaller and smaller abrasives to\nremove all the remaining pits from rough grinding and prepare the glass disc\nfor polishing and figuring. A typical grit sequence can look like this : #120,\n#220, #400, #800, #1000, and one finer grade, if available. Grind with 1/3\ncenter over center strokes. Measure the saggita, but don't be worried if the\nmirror is not exactly a F8 or a F6. To perform well, the precision of the\noptical surface is important, and the mirror being a F6.2 or 7,9 is completely\ninsignificant. You will make your own custom fit tube for this telescope\nanyway :)As we have thoroughly cleaned all the tools and working space, we can\nstart with 120 grit. After a wet or two, this is a good time to test the\nsphere on the mirror. The test is very simple  \n---  \nRinse and wipe the mirror dry. Draw a grid on the mirror surface with a\npermanent marker (<\\--picture) Add the usual half teaspoon of grit, sprinkle\nwith water and grind for a couple of minutes, rotating tool and mirror often.\nRinse the mirror and inspect the grid lines. If the grid is worn out evenly,\nyou are doing fine. If you grinded with TOT, the edges will be more worn than\nthe center, and vice versa if MOT. This is okay. Any other irregularities\nindicate that there is something wrong either with your strokes, your tool or\nmirror support. Also, check your bevel! Fix if necessary. Take a magnifier, or\na 25 mm eyepiece (use reversed) to inspect the surface. When all the pits look\nuniform, and there are no remaining pits from previous grit sizes, you can\nswitch to finer grit. Check the edge, and the center, these are the places\nmost likely to \"hide\" pits. Take your time, and remove all the remaining pits.  \n  \nMirror surface after #220 grit  \n---  \n  \nThere is not really much to say about fine grinding. You will notice that the\ngrits last longer and longer, as smaller in size. Grinding noise becomes more\nand more silent. Perform the grid test once per grit size. Clean thoroughly\nafter going to finer grit. Past#400, the focal length will not change\n(significantly) anymore, and the glass becomes very smooth, even shiny if\nobserved at a low angle. It starts to look like a telescope mirror :)  \n---  \nThe #400 grit is the finest size you will add with the teaspoon. Finer than\nthat, they need to be premixed with water. Take a plastic bottle (from drinks\netc) 0.5 liters, add a few spoons of grit in the bottle and add 6-8 times the\nvolume of water. Shake well before pouring the grit on the mirror. It settles\nback in just a few minutes. Also, you can add a drop of glycerin into the\nmixture, this will prevent tool and mirror getting stuck, something that\nhappens quite often at very fine grit sizes....  \n  \n\u00a9 1999-2005 Berislav Bracun\n\n", "frontpage": false}
