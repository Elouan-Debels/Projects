Credit: WARNER\nBROS/GETTY IMAGES)\n\nFor many, Casablanca is not just any old movie but the old movie. When Woody\nAllen was looking for a heroic exemplar for his nebbish cineaste in Play it\nAgain, Sam, it was to Bogart\u2019s Rick Blaine that he turned. When Nora Ephron\nwanted to illustrate the practicality of women in When Harry Met Sally, it was\nBergman\u2019s example she held up (\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life in\nCasablanca married to a man who owns a bar\u201d). The source of endless spin-offs,\nparodies and skits, from the Marx Brothers\u2019 A Night in Casablanca to Saturday\nNight Live, Casablanca is the movie we go to when we want to invoke\nmovieishness itself, the dream factory at full tilt, a heroic foil to our\nmock-heroic age. As Umberto Eco put it in Casablanca: Cult Movies and\nIntertextual Collage, \u201cIt is movies\u201d.\n\nThis cultural ubiquity has entailed a certain sniffiness from critics, whose\nestimation has tended to chime with the Warner Brothers script reader who\nfirst assessed the screenplay: \u201cExcellent melodrama. Colourful, timely\nbackground, tense mood, suspense, psychological and physical conflict, tight\nplotting, sophisticated hokum.\u201d The Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma crowd, fully paid-up\nmembers of the cult of Bogie, none the less preferred his films with Howard\nHawks and John Huston. Even Pauline Kael called it \u201ca movie that demonstrates\nhow entertaining a bad movie can be\u201d. And that is how most approach it: as\ncamp, endlessly screened in revival houses such as Harvard\u2019s Brattle theatre,\nwhere it played from 1957 to audiences of student activists thrilling to its\ndramatisation of doing the right thing in a world turned upside down. At one\nscreening in the late Sixties, according to the New Yorker\u2019s David Denby,\nduring the final reel the sound failed and the audience, speaking as one,\nrecited the actors\u2019 words for them, finishing the film up to its famous last\nline, \u201cLouis, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\u201d\n\nThat kind of quasi-religious devotion is not, generally, inspired by hokum.\n\u201cDespite the artificial nature of the film it still speaks with uncommon\npoignancy to the exile condition,\u201d writes Noah Isenberg in We\u2019ll Always Have\nCasablanca, a devoted history of the film and its afterlife in countries such\nas Hungary and East Germany, where uncut versions of it circulated like\nsamizdat. Nearly all of the 100-plus actors and actresses in the film were\nimmigrants hailing from more than 34 different nations. Bogart was the lone\nAmerican; you also had Bergman (Sweden), Claude Rains and Sydney Greenstreet\n(England), Paul Henreid (Austria), Conrad Veidt (Germany) and Peter Lorre,\noriginally from Slovakia by way of London, who said that, like Brecht, he had\nchanged countries \u201coftener than our shoes\u201d. Hungarian SZ Sakall, who played\nthe head waiter, lost three sisters to the concentration camps.\n\nThe director Michael Curtiz, himself a Hungarian Jew, cast them all\npersonally, incorporating some of their stories into the movie: the trading of\njewellery for exit visas, the presence of pickpockets. There were so many\nGerman Jews playing the very Nazis they had fled that German was frequently\nspoken on set, which was known as the International House. When the time came\nfor the scene in which Victor Laszlo defiantly sings \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d, one\ncharacter actor noticed everyone was crying: \u201cI suddenly realised they were\nall real refugees.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s customary to regard the release of the film on 26 November 1942, less\nthan three weeks after General Patton\u2019s forces landed in French North Africa,\nprompting Churchill, Roosevelt, and de Gaulle to issue the Casablanca\nDeclaration, as the one of the greatest publicity coups ever to befall a film\n\u2013 \u201cGeneral Eisenhower has merely served them well as an advance agent\u201d\nremarked the New Yorker. The original play on which it was based, Everybody\nComes to Rick\u2019s, by the Jewish teacher and playwright Murray Burnett, was a\npiece of opportune reportage. In 1938, Burnett and his wife took a tour of\nEurope as it geared up for war. They found Vienna rife with anti-Semitism and,\non the road to Monte Carlo, a smoky nightclub with a black pianist working old\nstandards to an audience of refugees and military officials of every\nnationality \u2013 \u201ca great contrast to the tragedy and tears\u201d, wrote Burnett.\n\nSubscribe to the Saturday Read View all newsletters\n\nYour new guide to the best writing on ideas, politics, books and culture each\nweekend \u2013 from the New Statesman.\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nThe film\u2019s timely dramatisation of Bogart\u2019s change of heart, \u201cat first wary\nand independent, then changing incrementally until it headed in the opposite\ndirection\u201d, in the words of his most recent biographer Stefan Kanfer, would\nprove definitional for America: a big block of national myth as hefty as that\nof its founding.\n\nAnother caf\u00e9 serves as a creative nexus point in Alan K Rode\u2019s doorstopping\nnew biography of Curtiz: Caf\u00e9 New York in Budapest, a rowdy 24-hour bohemian\nhang-out not far from the Danube, where the young film director Mih\u00e1ly Kert\u00e9sz\nmixed with artists and card players, film writers, fakers and physicists:\n\u201cEveryone knew everyone,\u201d in the words of the film historian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kriston,\n\u201cthey all screwed the same chorus girls and got drunk together and worked and\nargued.\u201d\n\nAs a child Kert\u00e9sz slept four in a room with his brothers and, as a teenage\nacrobat, developed great physical agility. When snapped up by Warner Brothers\nfor one of his silents in the summer of 1926, he anglicised his name to\nMichael Curtiz and spent ten days living at a Los Angeles county jail to learn\nabout the criminal justice system in time for his first assignment, a thriller\ncalled The Third Degree. \u201cWhen I finish I know more about jail system and\nAmerican criminals than the Technicolour director they pay big dough to tell\nme about such things,\u201d he said in his pigeon English which, said David Niven,\nwas \u201ca source of joy for all of us\u201d during the shooting of The Charge of the\nLight Brigade. A sign hung on the door of Curtiz\u2019s soundstages read: \u201cCurtiz\nspoken here.\u201d\n\nAbout the only upside of being bawled out by Curtiz on set was that you\nfrequently never understood him. \u201cIt would be inaccurate to say that everyone\non Curtiz\u2019s set loathed him,\u201d writes Rode at one point. With damning fair-\nmindedness, the portrait of the director that emerges is of a cruel and\nmercurial autocrat, a kind of Hungarian Otto Preminger, who drove his cast and\ncrew to breaking point \u2013 The Charge of the Light Brigade killed at least three\nhorses, the flood sequence in Noah\u2019s Ark drew 38 ambulances. \u201cHe can be a real\nson of a bitch to the bit players,\u201d noted Bogart, who threatened to walk from\nthe set of Casablanca at one point unless the director \u201cshut up\u201d.\n\nCurtiz was no Oskar Schindler-like saviour. Casablanca was the result of\nalchemy by acrimony, with the Epstein brothers supplying its snappier dialogue\n(\u201cI am shocked, shocked, to learn that gambling is going on in here\u201d), its\npolitics coming courtesy of Howard Koch, its love story and ending fleshed out\nby Casey Robinson, with ad libs from the actors (\u201cHere\u2019s looking at you, kid\u201d)\nwhile they stood waiting for the day\u2019s pages to be handed over.\n\n\u201cCasablanca is best described as cinematic magic that occurred accidentally on\npurpose,\u201d writes Rode in pointed rebuke of the film critic Andrew Sarris, for\nwhom the picture was merely the \u201chappiest of happy accidents\u201d and Curtiz \u201cthe\nmost divisive exception to auteur theory\u201d. Auteur theory\u2019s point-man in\nAmerica, Sarris could no more countenance the idea that it might be the theory\nrather than Curtiz that is at fault \u2013 placing him in the \u201cLightly Likeable\u201d\ncategory \u2013 than the old communist apparatchiks could conclude that their\nsystem was at fault rather than the people.\n\nCurtiz was a \u201ccinematic genius\u201d said the screenwriter Robert Buckner who could\n\u201cmake a picture when he didn\u2019t know what it was about\u201d. How can you proclaim\nyour boy an artist, his every work bearing his imprint as breath animates the\nbody, when he is responsible for films as wildly different as the tough-\nknuckled Angels with Dirty Faces, the sweeping Charge of the Light Brigade,\nthe effervescent The Adventures of Robin Hood, the svelte Mildred Pierce, and\nthe most dearly be-loved film of all time, Casablanca. Oh, and White\nChristmas?\n\nOn the other hand: The Adventures of Robin Hood! Mildred Pierce! Casablanca!\nWhite Christmas! Film directing careers do not come more bejewelled. Curtiz\nmakes the film critic\u2019s job harder. No Catholic guilt. No recurring themes,\naccording to Rode, except a recurring commitment to \u201crealism\u201d, whatever that\nmeans: for Rode it seems to mean that Curtiz\u2019s pirates were hairier than the\nnext guy\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI want you to forget all this crap about composition because if the story is\nno good you can take the composition and stick it!\u201d Curtiz was instructed\nduring the making of Light Brigade by Warner\u2019s thrifty production head Hal\nWillis, who drummed any technical grandstanding out of him. Curtiz was forced\nto reduce the number of dollies, and learn how to cut in camera. And yet it\nwas precisely this creative rough-housing that resulted in Casablanca, and the\nfilm\u2019s remarkable blend of the tough and tender. As Olivia de Havilland said\nof Curtiz, \u201cOh I guess he was a villain but he was pretty good.\u201d\n\nMaybe our duty to Casablanca is to rescue it from the ghetto of camp and\nrecognise in it what the novelist Erich Maria Remarque called \u201cthe refugee\nglance \u2013 an imperceptible lifting of the eyelids, followed by a look of blank\nindifference as if we couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d Beneath that show of indifference,\nbeats Bogart\u2019s sturdy heart.\n\nTom Shone is a film critic and author of \u201cBlockbuster\u201d (Simon & Schuster)\n\nCasablanca: the Life, Legend and Afterlife of Hollywood\u2019s Most Beloved Movie\nNoah Isenberg Faber & Faber, 352pp, \u00a325\n\nMichael Curtiz: a Life in Film Alan K Rode University Press of Kentucky,\n704pp, \u00a338.50\n\n###### Content from our partners\n\n###### Unlocking the potential of a national asset, St Pancras International\n\nRichard Thorp\n\n###### Time for Labour to turn the tide on children\u2019s health\n\nNikita Sinclair\n\n###### How can we deliver better rail journeys for customers?\n\nSamir Jeraj\n\nRelated\n\nFood & Drink\n\n##### In wine\u2019s culture war, we\u2019ve all been winners\n\nMusic\n\n##### Schumann and the arrival of spring\n\nTV\n\n##### Tom Hollander\u2019s deliciously nasty Truman Capote\n\nThis article appears in the 11 Apr 2018 issue of the New Statesman, Syria\u2019s\nworld war\n\n### Tom Shone\n\n#### More from this author See All\n\nTom Shone\n\n###### If you think Spielberg can\u2019t do women, you\u2019re missing his point about\nmen\n\nTom Shone\n\n###### What Barbra Streisand tells us about the modern day diva\n\n### More of this topic\n\nBooks\n\n###### Percival Everett\u2019s American absurd\n\nBook of the Day\n\n###### The perils of polyamory\n\nBook of the Day\n\n###### How America bought up Britain\n\n### Recent Podcasts\n\nPodcasts\n\n###### Decaying Britain: how severe is the NHS dental crisis?\n\nPodcasts\n\n###### The Angela Rayner investigation: scandal or smear campaign?\n\nPodcasts\n\n###### How will the gender care report affect politics?\n\nNew Statesman\n\n  * About us\n  * History\n  * Help Centre\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertising & Partnerships\n  * RSS\n\nSocial\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n\nLegal\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * T&Cs\n\nNew Times New Ideas New Statesman\n\n\u00a9 2024 New Statesman Media Group\n\nTHANK YOU\n\n## We at The New Statesman value your privacy\n\nWe may store and access personal data such as cookies, device identifiers or\nother similar technologies on your device and process such data to enhance\nsite navigation, personalize ads and content when you visit our sites, measure\nad and content performance, gain audience insights, analyze our site traffic\nas well as develop and improve our products and services.
