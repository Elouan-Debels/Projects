I still don't want\nstreaming music and I don't miss it, but I've learned a few things along the\nway.\n\nLet's get one thing out of the way up front: streaming music is bad for\nartists.^[1]\n\nTrent Reznor, via NME:\n\n> \"I think the terrible payout of streaming services has mortally wounded a\n> whole tier of artists that make being an artist unsustainable,\" he said.\n>\n> \"And it's great if you're Drake, and it's not great if you're Grizzly Bear.\n> And the reality is: Take a look around. We've had enough time for the whole\n> \u2018All the boats rise' argument to see they don't all rise. Those boats rise.\n> These boats don't. They can't make money in any means. And I think that's\n> bad for art.\"\n\nIt was hard enough to make a living as an artist before streaming and it's\nnearly impossible to now. Recorded music has become a loss-leader for tours\nand touring is grueling^[2].\n\nArtists were better off when we were toting around iPods, Zunes, Dell Digital\nJukeboxes and buying mp3s one at a time. I think we were too.\n\nI've always been a fan of manual curation and the care that goes into\nmaintaining a collection, but instead of subsidizing a streaming \"collection\"\nto fill in gaps, I've retaken ownership of the whole thing. This has been both\nlimiting and empowering \u2014 I can't turn on a radio station but I can remember\nwhat's in my collection and what I want to throw on^[3].\n\nI track album releases via MusicHarbor, RateYourMusic and RSS. Anything I care\nabout goes on an Albums calendar, and that ICS feed gets parsed and displayed\non my site. Recommendations come from friends, Last.fm and, again\nRateYourMusic. I buy music from Bandcamp, 7digital and a few other retailers\nas availability dictates. I pick up vinyl and have too many band shirts^[4].\n\nService/app| Type| Price  \n---|---|---  \nAstiga| Playback from compatible storage| $4.99/month or $49.90/year  \nDoppler| Local music player (macOS/iOS)| $30 for macOS, $9 for iOS  \nemby| Media server| Varies  \niBroadcast| Cloud locker| $3.99/month or $44.99/year  \nJellyfin| Media servier| Varies  \nPlex/Plexamp| Media server| Varies  \nRoon| Music server| $14.99/month or $12.49/month (annual)  \nVLC| Local media player| Variable donations  \nVox Music Cloud| Cloud locker| $4.99/month  \n  \nAstiga remains a strong and flexible option, but I still don't love the\nSubsonic player landscape. Doppler is fantastic, but constrained by your local\nstorage^[5]. I've yet to try emby and I quite liked Jellyfin when I took it\nfor a brief spin \u2014 Manet is a great app to use with it. I'm not committed\nenough to set up a Roon server and VOX Music Cloud still fails to excite me.\nAll of this is to say outside of a brief (and fun) run with Doppler, I'm\nsticking with Plexamp^[6].\n\nPlex provides a great balance of features and flexibility \u2014 Plexamp isn't\nnative but it's still a joy to use. I get to update my metadata, update every\nsingle artist image^[7] \u2014 I even cleaned up the album genres Plex runs with\n(it was tedious, but here I am on the other side of the process). I'm\nscrobbling plays to Last.fm and ListenBrainz but am surfacing data from my own\n\u2014 relatively \u2014 simple implementation.\n\nI don't miss playlists, I've kept up with artists I care about and I've\ndiscovered new ones along the way. I remember what I have on hand and know\nwhat suits a given mood. I pay artists where I can and wish I could do more. I\nhave enough to keep me entertained and I'm glad I made the change.\n\n  1. It has and will only continue to get worse as said services look to increase profits. It's already looking grim for small artists \u2014 just wait until they're dropping releases in the same fashion as TV streamers or \u2014 imagine it \u2014 replacing actual artists with AI sludge. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. There are ever more hands out looking for a cut of merch sales on tour as well. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. My wife made the comment that I'm one of the few people that still listens to albums and I think there's a lot to be said for respecting the artist's intent and effort that went into sequencing the release. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. I'm down to buying shirts from Bifocal Media when they print something for NoMeansNo or Pyre Press and 20 Buck Spin (because they use Pyre Press for all their shirts). \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  5. This isn't a bad thing, necessarily. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  6. If things go sideways, Jellyfin is the runner up. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  7. I can do it, so I must. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\nDiscuss on Mastodon\n\n## Popular posts\n\n  * Data collection should always be opt in\n  * AI cannot and should not replace search\n  * A retrospective on a year without streaming music\n  * Go ahead and block AI web crawlers\n  * We have a content quality problem, not a content quantity problem\n\n## Recent links\n\n  * Opt-out is always wrong\n  * Again, my position on LLMs is that you absolutely shouldn\u2019t be using them with very, very few exceptions\n  * AI uses too much energy\n  * Clippy returned (as an unnecessary \u201cAI\u201d)\n  * Curation is the last best hope of intelligent discourse.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
