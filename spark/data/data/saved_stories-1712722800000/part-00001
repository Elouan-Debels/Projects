This\ncomprehensive draft legislation sets clear, national data privacy rights and\nprotections for Americans, eliminates the existing patchwork of state\ncomprehensive data privacy laws, and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms\nto hold violators accountable, including a private right of action for\nindividuals.\n\n\u201cThis bipartisan, bicameral draft legislation is the best opportunity we\u2019ve\nhad in decades to establish a national data privacy and security standard that\ngives people the right to control their personal information,\u201d said Chair\nRodgers and Cantwell. \u201cThis landmark legislation represents the sum of years\nof good faith efforts in both the House and Senate. It strikes a meaningful\nbalance on issues that are critical to moving comprehensive data privacy\nlegislation through Congress. Americans deserve the right to control their\ndata and we\u2019re hopeful that our colleagues in the House and Senate will join\nus in getting this legislation signed into law.\u201d\n\n\"This landmark legislation gives Americans the right to control where their\ninformation goes and who can sell it. It reins in Big Tech by prohibiting them\nfrom tracking, predicting, and manipulating people\u2019s behaviors for profit\nwithout their knowledge and consent. Americans overwhelmingly want these\nrights, and they are looking to us, their elected representatives, to act,\"\nsaid Chair Rodgers. \"I\u2019m grateful to my colleague, Senator Cantwell, for\nworking with me in a bipartisan manner on this important legislation and look\nforward to moving the bill through regular order on Energy and Commerce this\nmonth.\u201d\n\n\u201cA federal data privacy law must do two things: it must make privacy a\nconsumer right, and it must give consumers the ability to enforce that right,\u201d\nsaid Chair Cantwell. \u201cWorking in partnership with Representative McMorris\nRodgers, our bill does just that. This bipartisan agreement is the protections\nAmericans deserve in the Information Age.\u201d\n\nThe American Privacy Rights Act:\n\nEstablishes Foundational Uniform National Data Privacy Rights for Americans:\n\n  * Puts people in control of their own personal data.\n  * Eliminates the patchwork of state laws by setting one national privacy standard, stronger than any state.\n  * Minimizes the data that companies can collect, keep, and use about people, of any age, to what companies actually need to provide them products and services.\n  * Gives Americans control over where their personal information goes, including the ability to prevent the transfer or selling of their data. The bill also allows individuals to opt out of data processing if a company changes its privacy policy.\n  * Provides stricter protections for sensitive data by requiring affirmative express consent before sensitive data can be transferred to a third party.\n  * Requires companies to let people access, correct, delete, and export their data.\n  * Allows individuals to opt out of targeted advertising.\n\nGives Americans the Ability to Enforce Their Data Privacy Rights:\n\n  * Gives individuals the right to sue bad actors who violate their privacy rights\u2014and recover money for damages when they\u2019ve been harmed.\n  * Prevents companies from enforcing mandatory arbitration in cases of substantial privacy harm.\n\nProtects Americans\u2019 Civil Rights:\n\n  * Stops companies from using people\u2019s personal information to discriminate against them.\n  * Allows individuals to opt out of a company\u2019s use of algorithms to make decisions about housing, employment, healthcare, credit opportunities, education, insurance, or access to places of public accommodation.\n  * Requires annual reviews of algorithms to ensure they do not put individuals, including our youth, at risk of harm, including discrimination.\n\nHolds Companies Accountable and Establishes Strong Data Security Obligations:\n\n  * Mandates strong data security standards that will prevent data from being hacked or stolen. This limits the chances for identity theft and harm.\n  * Makes executives take responsibility for ensuring that companies take all actions necessary to protect customer data as required by the law.\n  * Ensures individuals know when their data has been transferred to foreign adversaries.\n  * Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission, States, and consumers to enforce against violations.\n\nFocuses on the Business of Data, Not Mainstreet Business\n\n  * Small businesses, that are not selling their customers\u2019 personal information, are exempt from the requirements of this bill.\n\nCLICK HERE to read the American Privacy Rights Act discussion draft.\n\nCLICK HERE to read the section-by-section of the discussion draft.\n\nShare on\n\n## Energy & Commerce Committee\n\n### Office\n\nMain: (202) 225-3641\n\nPress: (202) 226-4972\n\nMinority Website\n\nPrivacy\n\nAccessibility\n\n", "frontpage": true}
