The group\u2019s operations\nin support of Moscow\u2019s war aims have proven tactically and operationally\nadaptable, and as of today, appear to be better integrated with the activities\nof Russia\u2019s conventional forces than in any other previous phase of the\nconflict. To date, no other Russian government-backed cyber group has played a\nmore central role in shaping and supporting Russia\u2019s military campaign.\n\nYet the threat posed by Sandworm is far from limited to Ukraine. Mandiant\ncontinues to see operations from the group that are global in scope in key\npolitical, military, and economic hotspots for Russia. Additionally, with a\nrecord number of people participating in national elections in 2024,\nSandworm\u2019s history of attempting to interfere in democratic processes further\nelevates the severity of the threat the group may pose in the near-term.\n\nGiven the active and diffuse nature of the threat posed by Sandworm globally,\nMandiant has decided to graduate the group into a named Advanced Persistent\nThreat: APT44. As part of this process, we are releasing a report, \u201cAPT44:\nUnearthing Sandworm\u201d, that provides additional insights into the group\u2019s new\noperations, retrospective insights, and context on how the group is adjusting\nto support Moscow\u2019s war aims.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nSponsored by Russian military intelligence, APT44 is a dynamic and\noperationally mature threat actor that is actively engaged in the full\nspectrum of espionage, attack, and influence operations. While most state-\nbacked threat groups tend to specialize in a specific mission such as\ncollecting intelligence, sabotaging networks, or conducting information\noperations, APT44 stands apart in how it has honed each of these capabilities\nand sought to integrate them into a unified playbook over time. Each of these\nrespective components, and APT44\u2019s efforts to blend them for combined effect,\nare foundational to Russia\u2019s guiding \u201cinformation confrontation\u201d concept for\ncyber warfare.\n\nFigure 1: APT44\u2019s spectrum of operations\n\nAPT44 has aggressively pursued a multi-pronged effort to help the Russian\nmilitary gain a wartime advantage and is responsible for nearly all of the\ndisruptive and destructive operations against Ukraine over the past decade.\nThroughout Russia\u2019s war, APT44 has waged a high intensity campaign of cyber\nsabotage inside of Ukraine. Through the use of disruptive cyber tools, such as\nwiper malware designed to disrupt systems, APT44 has sought to impact a wide\nrange of critical infrastructure sectors. At times, these operations have been\ncoordinated with conventional military activity, such as kinetic strikes or\nother forms of sabotage, in an attempt to achieve joint military objectives.\n\nHowever, as the war has endured, APT44\u2019s relative focus has transitioned away\nfrom disruption to intelligence collection. The group\u2019s targets and methods\nhave shifted significantly in the second year of the war, with increasing\nemphasis placed on espionage activity intended to provide battlefield\nadvantage to Russia\u2019s conventional forces. For example, one long-running APT44\ncampaign has assisted forward-deployed Russian ground forces to exfiltrate\ncommunications from captured mobile devices in order to collect and process\nrelevant targeting data. APT44\u2019s approach to supporting Russia\u2019s military\ncampaign has evolved considerably over the past two years.\n\nFigure 2: APT44\u2019s wartime disruptive activity\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT44 is seen by the Kremlin as a flexible\ninstrument of power capable of servicing Russia's wide ranging national\ninterests and ambitions, including efforts to undermine democratic processes\nglobally.\n\nDespite being an arm of Russia\u2019s military, the group\u2019s sabotage activity is\nnot limited to military objectives and also spans Russia\u2019s wider national\ninterests, such as driving the Kremlin\u2019s political signaling efforts,\nresponses to crises, or intended non-escalatory responses to perceived slights\nto Moscow\u2019s stature in the world.\n\nAPT44\u2019s support of the Kremlin\u2019s political objectives has resulted in some of\nthe largest and most consequential cyber attacks in history. These operations\ninclude first-of-their-kind disruptions of Ukraine's energy grid in the\nwinters of 2015 and 2016, the global NotPetya attack timed to coincide with\nUkraine\u2019s Constitution Day in 2017, and the disruption of the opening ceremony\nof the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics in response to Russia's doping ban from the\ngames, to name a few.\n\nFigure 3: Timeline of consequential pre-war APT44 operations\n\nDue to its history of aggressive use of network attack capabilities across\npolitical and military contexts, APT44 presents a persistent, high severity\nthreat to governments and critical infrastructure operators globally where\nRussian national interests intersect. The combination of APT44's high\ncapability, risk tolerance, and far-reaching mandate to support Russia\u2019s\nforeign policy interests places governments, civil society, and critical\ninfrastructure operators around the world at risk of falling into the group's\nsights on short notice.\n\nWe also judge APT44 to present a significant proliferation risk for new cyber\nattack concepts and methods. Continued advancements and in-the-wild use of the\ngroup\u2019s disruptive and destructive capabilities has likely lowered the barrier\nof entry for other state and non-state actors to replicate and develop their\nown cyber attack programs. Russia itself is almost certainly alert to and\nconcerned about this proliferation risk, as Mandiant has observed Russian\ncybersecurity entities exercise their ability to defend against categories of\ndisruptive cyber capabilities originally used by APT44 against Ukraine.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nAPT44 will almost certainly continue to present one of the widest and highest\nseverity cyber threats globally. It has been at the forefront of the threat\nlandscape for over a decade and is responsible for a long list of firsts that\nhave set precedents for future cyber attack activity. Patterns of historical\nactivity, such as efforts to influence elections or retaliate against\ninternational sporting bodies, suggest there is no limit to the nationalist\nimpulses that may fuel the group\u2019s operations in the future.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s war continues, we anticipate Ukraine will remain the principal\nfocus of APT44 operations. However, as history indicates, the group\u2019s\nreadiness to conduct cyber operations in furtherance of the Kremlin\u2019s wider\nstrategic objectives globally is ingrained in its mandate. We therefore assess\nthat changing Western political dynamics, upcoming elections, and emerging\nissues in Russia\u2019s near abroad will also continue to shape APT44\u2019s operations\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\n## Protecting the Community\n\nAs part of our research, we take various steps to protect customers and the\ncommunity:\n\n  * Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) uses the results of our research to improve the safety and security of Google\u2019s products.\n\n    * Upon discovery, all identified websites and domains are added to Safe Browsing to protect users from further exploitation.\n    * All targeted Gmail and Workspace users are sent government-backed attacker alerts, notifying them of the activity, encouraging potential targets to enable Enhanced Safe Browsing for Chrome, and ensuring them that all devices are updated.\n  * Where possible, Mandiant sends victim notifications via the Victim Notification Program.\n  * If you are a Google Chronicle Enterprise+ customer, Chronicle rules were released to your Emerging Threats rule pack, and IOCs are available for prioritization with Applied Threat Intelligence.\n  * A VirusTotal Collection featuring APT44-related indicators of compromise is now available for registered users.\n\nWe are committed to sharing our findings with the security community to raise\nawareness, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted by\nthese activities.\n\nRead the APT44 report for our full analysis of this group, a detailed list of\nmalware used by APT44 since 2018, hunting rules for detecting the malware, and\na list of Mandiant Security Validation actions organizations can use to\nvalidate their security controls.\n\nPosted in\n\n  * Threat Intelligence\n\n##### Related articles\n\nThreat Intelligence\n\n### Apache XML Security for C++ Library Allows for Server-Side Request Forgery\n\nBy Mandiant \u2022 6-minute read\n\nThreat Intelligence\n\n### Cutting Edge, Part 4: Ivanti Connect Secure VPN Post-Exploitation Lateral\nMovement Case Studies\n\nBy Mandiant \u2022 31-minute read\n\nThreat Intelligence\n\n### SeeSeeYouExec: Windows Session Hijacking via CcmExec\n\nBy Mandiant \u2022 6-minute read\n\nThreat Intelligence\n\n### Life After Death?
