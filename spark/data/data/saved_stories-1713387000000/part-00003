The Alma 9.4\nbeta follows 20 days after Red Hat announced the beta test of RHEL 9.4 and\nRHEL 8.10.\n\nAs usual, the IBM subsidiary has a humongous set of release notes for the 9.4\nbeta, which in PDF form totals 167 pages. Highlights include new driver\nsupport for kit including Intel's Data Streaming Accelerator, NVMe-over-TCP,\nand support for DEP and the NX bit as early as the GRUB bootloader. Plus, at\nlong last, support for Intel's Software Guard Extensions. It took Intel a few\nyears to offer Linux drivers after SGX first appeared in 2013, and The Reg has\nbeen reporting on issues with the tech every year or two ever since.\n\nThe AlmaLinux team's beta release notes are much shorter and more to the\npoint, especially the changelog section. This summarizes the highlights: Git\n2.43, Git LFS 3.4.1, plus some optional new versions, Python 3.12, Ruby 3.3,\nPHP 8.2, nginx 1.24, MariaDB 10.11, and PostgreSQL 16.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Alma Linux 9.4 is set to support kit that RHEL\n$NEXT will drop. The beta modifies a small list of device drivers (aacraid,\nbe2iscsi, hpsa, lpfc, megaraid_sas, mpt3sas, mptsas, qla2xxx, and qla4xxx) to\ninclude PCI device IDs that Red Hat has removed. This will enable the drivers\nto work with a list of hardware that RHEL will soon no longer support.\n\n### Meanwhile, in Rocky-ville...\n\nAlthough there's no news yet of the corresponding beta of Rocky Linux, its\nprimary backer, CIQ, has announced an interesting new move. It is offering\nRocky Linux users the choice of using upstream LTS kernels.\n\nJeremy Allison, Distinguished Engineer at CIQ, told The Reg:\n\nGenerally speaking, upstream stable kernels provide greater security than\nvendor kernels. The Linux kernel interface to user space is what provides the\nstability that application vendors and customers rely on to support their most\ncritical workloads. Also, although some customers rely on absolute RHEL kernel\ncompatibility in order to support device drivers not yet merged into the\nupstream kernels, we believe the majority of customers would get greater\nsecurity and performance by using upstream stable kernels.\n\n  * Top five reasons to move from CentOS to RHEL (according to Red Hat)\n  * Red Hat greases migration to RHEL for CentOS 7 holdouts\n  * Rocky Linux and Oracle Unbreakable Linux also hit 9.3\n  * OpenELA flips Red Hat the bird with public release of Enterprise Linux source\n\nCIQ's interest in long-term support kernels is documented. It is a primary\nbacker of the Open Enterprise Linux Alliance, and, as we reported last month,\nthe OpenELA recently brought kernel 4.14 back into maintenance. On US\nIndependence Day last year, we reported on how the Rocky Linux development\nteam is obtaining RHEL kernel sources, and soon afterwards, on Oracle and SUSE\ngetting involved too.\n\nPerhaps we are being overly suspicious, but we wonder if the alliance is\nencountering some blockages or hiccups in this code pipeline, which could be\nwhy it's looking into alternative paths.\n\nExtra work to bring kernel 4.14 back into maintenance again was needed because\nthe kernel team has cut the number and lifetime of long-term kernels.\n\nFor as long as there have been long-support-lifetime enterprise distros, each\nvendor chooses its own kernel version for its long-lived products and then\nmaintains it for years. As we said when reporting on Canonical's support\nlifecycle for Ubuntu kernels, we feel that this is not ideal.\n\nFor us, the best outcome would be that the enterprise vendors coordinated with\nthe upstream kernel team, and they all worked together on shared, common LTS\nkernel versions. There would still be plenty of room for differentiation \u2013\nthey could continue to offer their own enhancements and backported\nfunctionality. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * RHEL\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Fedora\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * GNOME\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Red Hat\n  * Richard Stallman\n  * Software\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * RHEL\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Fedora\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * GNOME\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Red Hat\n  * Richard Stallman\n  * Software\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### NetBSD 10 proves old tech can still kick apps and take names three\ndecades later\n\nFOSDEM 2024 Proper old-school Unix, not like those lazy, decadent Linux types\n\nOSes7 hrs | 22\n\n#### OpenBSD 7.5 locks down with improved disk encryption support and syscall\nlimitations\n\nThe most secure Unix-like OS to date?\n\nOSes5 days | 49\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware13 days | 184\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Linux Foundation is leading fight against fauxpen source\n\nOpinion Shifts its transmission from vendor neutral into open source gear\n\nApplications5 days | 37\n\n#### GCC 14 dropping IA64 support is final nail in the coffin for Itanium\narchitecture\n\nLinux kernel cut it loose, now leading FOSS compiler lands depth-charge on\nItanic\n\nApplications5 days | 77\n\n#### Linux Foundation marshals support for open source alternative to Redis\n\nFollows the vendor's decision to overhaul licensing of the popular cache\ndatabase\n\nDatabases14 days | 7\n\n#### Torvalds intentionally complicates his use of indentation in Linux\nKconfig\n\nParamount penguin forces more robust whitespace handling\n\nOSes23 hrs | 74\n\n#### VMS Software prunes OpenVMS hobbyist program\n\nVintage OS editions go the way of the dodo as VSI cranks up exclusivity\n\nApplications8 days | 54\n\n#### Notepad++ dev slams Google-clogging notepad.plus 'parasite'\n\nUpdated Imitator seemingly swiftly sunk from search after plea to users for\nhelp\n\nApplications8 days | 104\n\n#### What can be done to protect open source devs from next xz backdoor drama?\n\nKettle What happened, how it was found, and what your vultures have made of it\nall\n\nResearch11 days | 91\n\n#### Open sourcerers say suspected xz-style attacks continue to target\nmaintainers\n\nSocial engineering patterns spotted across range of popular projects\n\nSecurity1 day | 23\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
