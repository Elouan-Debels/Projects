However, SiC bulk micromachining is still a challenge,\nwhich hinders the development of complex SiC MEMS. To address this problem, we\npresent the use of a carbon nanotube (CNT) array coated with amorphous SiC\n(a-SiC) as an alternative composite material to enable high aspect ratio (HAR)\nsurface micromachining. By using a prepatterned catalyst layer, a HAR CNT\narray can be grown as a structural template and then densified by uniformly\nfilling the CNT bundle with LPCVD a-SiC. The electrical properties of the\nresulting SiC-CNT composite were characterized, and the results indicated that\nthe electrical resistivity was dominated by the CNTs. To demonstrate the use\nof this composite in MEMS applications, a capacitive accelerometer was\ndesigned, fabricated, and measured. The fabrication results showed that the\ncomposite is fully compatible with the manufacturing of surface micromachining\ndevices. The Young\u2019s modulus of the composite was extracted from the measured\nspring constant, and the results show a great improvement in the mechanical\nproperties of the CNTs after coating with a-SiC. The accelerometer was\nelectrically characterized, and its functionality was confirmed using a\nmechanical shaker.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Graphene ribbons with suspended masses as transducers in ultra-small\nnanoelectromechanical accelerometers\n\nArticle 02 September 2019\n\nXuge Fan, Fredrik Forsberg, ...

Jongbaeg Kim\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe demand for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that are compatible with\nharsh environments is increasing^1. Traditional silicon (Si)-based MEMS cannot\nsurvive in extreme environments, such as high temperatures, because Si\njunction-based devices suffer from significant leakage at high temperatures.\nAdditionally, Si experiences plastic deformation at 500 \u00b0C^1, which is fatal\nfor devices with movable components. Silicon carbide (SiC), a representative\nwide bandgap material, has been recognized as a promising candidate for MEMS\ndevices that require operation in harsh environments^2,3,4,5,6. Due to SiC\u2019s\nwide bandgap, SiC-based electronics can work at a much higher temperature than\ntheir silicon counterparts. SiC has a critical electric field higher than that\nof Si and a thermal conductivity approximately three times greater than that\nof Si. In terms of mechanical properties, SiC has a Young\u2019s modulus 2.4 to 4.3\ntimes greater (depending on the polytype) than silicon, and it is one of the\nhardest materials ever discovered^7. Additionally, SiC retains its mechanical\nproperties even at very high temperatures.\n\nDespite these advantages, the development of SiC MEMS is impeded by the lack\nof sufficient bulk micromachining processes. The mechanical stability and\nchemical inertness of SiC decrease the effectiveness of conventional bulk\netching methods. SiC is stable in most known aqueous etching solutions. The\nexceptions are phosphoric acid and alkaline solutions of K_3Fe(CN)_6. However,\nthe aqueous etching processes exhibit issues such as a low etch rate and\noxidation^8. Molten salts, especially KOH, can etch SiC and have been widely\nused for studying defects in SiC, but etching requires a high temperature and\na dedicated container. Additionally, the process is isotropic and therefore\ncannot be used for fabricating high aspect ratio (HAR) structures^9. Reactive\nion etching (RIE) is the most promising technique for SiC bulk micromachining.\nHowever, most reported SiC dry etching processes still demonstrate\ninsufficient etching rates (typically 1 \u03bcm/min or less), poor selectivity to\nmask materials, rough etch surfaces, non-vertical profiles, and microtrenching\neffects^10,11,12,13. As summarized by Dowling et al., the aspect ratio of SiC\nstructures fabricated by plasma etching reported in the literature is usually\nless than 10, and these structures typically exhibit a \u201cV\u201d shape due to the\nnon-vertical nature of the sidewall^11.\n\nSurface micromachining is also essential in MEMS fabrication. Mono-crystalline\nSiC is nearly impossible for this application, as it cannot be grown on\nsacrificial materials. Fortunately, polycrystalline 3C-SiC can be deposited\nusing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) over an insulating substrate such as\nsilicon dioxide (SiO_2)^2,4. However, the SiC layer thickness is generally\nlimited by the low deposition rate and layer stress. For this reason, the\npoly-SiC device layers in all the reported SiC surface micromachining MEMS\ndevices do not exceed 10 \u03bcm^3,5,6,14,15,16,17. This limits several SiC MEMS\nimplementations.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, we present the use of a carbon nanotube array\nreinforced with SiC to form a SiC-CNT composite. The CVD of a vertically\naligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) array enables the fast fabrication of HAR\nstructures. The growth rate of CNTs can reach a few tens or hundreds of\nnanometers per second, and CNTs can reach several millimeters in length with\nan excellent vertical sidewall^18,19,20. However, CNT arrays have foam-like\nproperties because interwoven CNTs are only weakly bonded to each other by van\nder Waals forces. This makes the CNT array vulnerable to loads from both the\nvertical and horizontal directions. Fortunately, the porous nature of the CNT\narray allows us to densify it by filling with other materials, thus producing\na reinforced nanocomposite.\n\nIn recent years, there has been some research on modifying the intrinsic VACNT\nproperties with different filler materials. Ci et al. created reinforced CNT\narrays by infiltrating them with liquid-state polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The\nwork showed that the longitudinal modulus increased 33 times, and the damping\ncapability increased 21 times^19. In 2010, Hutchison et al. showed CNT arrays\ninfiltrated by poly-Si and silicon nitride (Si_3N_4). They found that the\nfiller material had improved mechanical properties and that the electrical\nconductivity was dominated by the CNTs^20. With this technique, a variety of\nactuators were implemented as demonstrators. In 2014, Poelma et al. studied\nthe mechanical properties of VACNT arrays coated with low-pressure chemical\nvapor deposition (LPCVD) amorphous SiC (a-SiC) by nanoindentation. The\ncompressive strength and Young\u2019s modulus of the coated VACNTs significantly\nincreased compared to those of the uncoated CNT array. The authors of that\nstudy suggested that the SiC-CNT composite can be useful in applications such\nas vertical interconnects and 3D supercapacitors^21. These representative\nworks prove that filler-reinforced CNT arrays have enhanced mechanical\nproperties and show potential for manufacturing MEMS devices.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate the fabrication of a SiC-CNT composite. The\nelectrical properties of this material are studied by characterizing the bulk\nresistivity and contact resistance with the metal layer. To demonstrate its\nfurther use in manufacturing HAR MEMS, we design, fabricate, and characterize\na MEMS accelerometer based on this composite. Based on the capacitive\nmeasurement result of the accelerometer, Young\u2019s modulus of the SiC-CNT\ncomposite is determined. The Young\u2019s modulus of the CNTs increases by 3 orders\nof magnitude after they are filled with a-SiC. To our knowledge, this\naccelerometer is the first MEMS sensor that has been fabricated using a CNT\narray reinforced by a filler.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nThe concept of our SiC-CNT composites is depicted in Fig. 1. First, a SiO_2\nlayer is deposited on the silicon substrate as a diffusion barrier for the\ncatalyst stack^22. This oxide layer is also used as a sacrificial layer for\nsurface micromachined devices. Then, a catalyst stack for CNT growth is grown\nby electron beam evaporation. The catalyst stack consists of 20 nm aluminum\noxide (Al_2O_3) and 2 nm iron (Fe), where the Al_2O_3 layer is evaporated\nprior to Fe to enhance the nucleation density of CNTs from Fe particles^23.\nAfter evaporation, the CNT arrays are grown by CVD using an Aixtron\nBlackmagic. The deposition procedure consists of an initial activation step in\na H_2 environment at 500 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by an actual growth step with\na gas mixture of H_2/C_2H_2 (700/50 sccm) at 80 mbar and 600 \u00b0C. The height of\nthe CNT array with respect to the deposition time is summarized in Appendix A\nTable A1. The deposition rate is tens of micrometers per minute; however, this\nrate decreases over time. This decrease occurs due to the depletion of the\ncatalyst layer, i.e., Fe in this case, which eventually terminates CNT\ngrowth^24. The cross-section after CNT growth is given in Fig. 1a, and Fig. 1c\nshows the surface of the as-grown VACNT array, where CNT fibers are weakly\ninterwoven together by van der Waals forces. The highest CNT array was\nobtained by a 5-min deposition and had a height of 96.3 \u03bcm, as shown in Fig.\n2. The test structures shown in the inset have aspect ratios ranging from 0.96\nto 96.3. Structures with an aspect ratio larger than 10 showed different\nextents of bending. Notably, the structures that are encircled by the red\ndashed box in Fig. 2 did not show bending even when the aspect ratio was\napproximately 20. This occurs because these structures are clamped at both\nsides to anchors, which act as mechanical supports. It implies that an aspect\nratio higher than 20 is still possible if the CNT arrays are properly\ndesigned. After the growth of the CNT arrays, the VACNT array was filled with\na-SiC, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The filling is performed by LPCVD of a-SiC.\nThe low deposition rate of a-SiC enhances the infiltration process of the\nfiller into the CNT array, thus producing a denser composite. The deposition\nused a dichlorobenzene (SiH_2Cl_2) and acetylene (C_2H_2) gas mixture diluted\nin hydrogen (H_2) at 760 \u00b0C and at 1 mbar. The flow rates of SiH_2Cl_2 and\nC_2H_2 were 3.25 sccm and 21.75 sccm, respectively. This recipe yielded a\ndeposition rate of approximately 0.25 nm/min. The result after deposition is\nshown in Fig. 1d. Comparing Fig. 1c and 1d, it can be seen that the individual\nCNT fibers became much thicker after deposition. These coating results are\nsimilar to what was reported by Poelma et al.^21. To verify whether the CNTs\ndeep inside the bulk were also uniformly coated, some structures were cut\ndeliberately with tweezers. As shown in Fig. A1, the amount of a-SiC coated in\nthe bulk is the same as that on the surface. As each individual CNT is coated\nwith a-SiC, it is inferred that the SiC-CNT composite will be as chemically\nstable as the pure a-SiC which demonstrated excellent inertness to wet\nchemicals^25,26. This suggests that SiC-CNT composites have the potential to\nbe applied in corrosive environments. Additionally, the SiC-CNT composite\nbecomes denser with increasing a-SiC deposition time, as shown in Fig. A2.\nThis means that the mechanical properties of the composite can be tuned by\nconducting different extents of the a-SiC filling process.\n\nFig. 1: The basic concept of fabricating SiC-CNT composites.\n\na VACNT array is grown on a prepatterned catalyst layer (Fe on Al_2O_3), b\nLPCVD a-SiC fills the porous CNT array; and c the surface of the CNT array\nbefore and d after being filled by 14 nm a-SiC\n\nFull size image\n\nFig. 2: SEM image of the as-grown VACNT array (tilted view).\n\nThe inset in the blue box shows the unclamped structure, which bends when the\nHAR reaches 10.

The measurements were performed with the four-\nprobe method to eliminate resistance from contacts and probe wires. The ELM\nstructures have an effective length of 300 \u03bcm and a height of 10 \u03bcm. The\nwidths of the test structures are 10 \u03bcm, 20 \u03bcm, and 40 \u03bcm. A current was\nforced into the ELM structures, sweeping from \u221250 \u03bcA to +50 \u03bcA. The I\u2013V\ncharacteristics are plotted in Fig. 3b. As seen from the measurements, the\nresistance of the ELM structure scales with the dimension. This result\nindicates good uniformity of the CNT arrays.\n\nFig. 3: The bulk resistivity measurement of SiC-CNT composite.\n\na ELM test structure fabricated with the SiC-CNT composite. b Four-probe\nmeasurement results for different ELM structures with the dimensions listed in\nTable 1. Inset: Resistance measured at elevated temperatures\n\nFull size image\n\nThe bulk resistivity is extracted from the measurement results and is listed\nin Table 1. The bulk resistivities of the coated arrays are very close to each\nother (0.701 \u00b1 0.010 \u03a9 cm). A sample (Sample #5) without SiC infiltration was\nalso measured and showed an intrinsic resistivity of 0.223 \u03a9 cm. The\nresistivity of the composite was more than 3 times greater than that of the\nintrinsic CNT array. The degradation may be attributed to part of the CNT\nconductive paths being disconnected during a-SiC deposition. Another factor\ncould be the degradation of CNTs during the furnace boat-in process when they\nare exposed to oxygen and could oxidize. However, compared to the resistivity\nof a-SiC (on the order of M\u03a9 cm^5), the bulk resistivity decreases on the\norder of 10^7. Therefore, we conclude that the bulk resistivity is dominated\nby the CNTs. If the resistivity of SiC-CNT composite is compared to that of\ndoped bulk SiC, it would correspond to a doping concentration of ~10^16\natom/cm^3 for nitrogen-doped SiC and ~5 \u00d7 10^19 atom/cm^3 for aluminum-doped\nSiC^7.\n\nTable 1 Resistance measurements of SiC-coated CNTs\n\nFull size table\n\nThe bulk resistivity of the SiC-CNT composite at high temperatures is also\nstudied and is summarized in Table 1. The resistance of the EML structure was\nmeasured up to 600 \u00b0C. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3b, the SiC-CNT composite\nstill exhibited a linear I\u2013V relationship at all the measured temperature\npoints, i.e. 150 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, 450 \u00b0C, and 600 \u00b0C. In addition, a negative\ntemperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) of approximately \u2212315 ppm/K is\nobserved. This result aligns well with the TCR of CNTs reported in^27,28. The\nnegative TCR might be related to the increase in conduction channels in the\nCNTs with increasing temperature^29. This further proves that CNTs play a\nmajor role in the electrical properties of the composite.\n\n### Contact resistivity\n\nTo interface with measurement instruments, a conductive interconnection layer\nis required for wire bonding. Typically, wire bonding should be performed on a\nsurface with low surface roughness to ensure the bondability and reliability\nof the wire bonds. However, the top surface of the SiC-CNT composite is rough\nand is not an ideal surface for wire bonding. Therefore it was decided to\nfabricate the interconnection layer before fabricating the SiC-CNT composite.\nThis means that the interconnection layer needs to withstand the high\ntemperature brought by CNT growth and SiC deposition. Titanium nitride (TiN)\nwas chosen for this purpose because of its high endurance under high-\ntemperature conditions. As a result, the contact region consists of TiN, the\nSiC-CNT composite, and possibly the Al_2O_3/Fe catalyst stack. In principle,\nAl_2O_3 is an insulator and prevents conduction between TiN and CNTs unless\nthe layer is sufficiently thin or if interdiffusion occurs^30. The contact\nresistivity of such a contact stack was measured with the transmission line\nmethod (TLM). As indicated in Fig. 4a, four resistors with different\nevaluation lengths, i.e., 190, 485, 690, and 885 \u03bcm, were measured. Again, the\nfour-probe method was used for TLM measurements. Figure 4b shows the measured\nresult and linear fitted curve. By extrapolating the fitting curve to the\ny-axis, the sum of the contact resistances on both contacts (2R_contact) is\nestimated to be 248 \u03a9. Combining this information with the transfer length\n(L_T) obtained from the x-axis intersect, i.e., L_T = 18.7 \u03bcm, the specific\ncontact resistivity is found to be 4.63 \u00d7 10^\u22124 \u03a9 cm^2. Due to the non-\nconductive nature of Al_2O_3, we infer that the conduction could be mostly\nattributed to electron tunneling between the interface.\n\nFig. 4: The measurement of specific contact resistivity between the\ninterconnect layer and composite.\n\na The TLM structure used in the measurement. b Measured resistances from\ndifferent segments of the TLM structure. The intersection between the curve\nand the y-axis is the value of the contact resistance\n\nFull size image\n\n### Comb-type capacitive accelerometer\n\nTo demonstrate the potential of using SiC-CNT composites for HAR devices, we\ndesigned, fabricated, and characterized a classical comb-type capacitive\naccelerometer fabricated with the SiC-CNT composite. The HAR structure is\nparticularly useful for capacitive sensors because it can effectively increase\nthe surface area that is used for capacitive detection^20.\n\nA schematic of the comb structure capacitive accelerometer is shown in Fig.\n5a. The device comprises a proof mass, interdigitated fingers (fixed fingers\nare anchored to the substrate, and movable fingers are attached to the proof\nmass), fixed anchors, and folded beams as the spring that connects the proof\nmass and anchors. Except for the anchors, all the structures are suspended by\nthe surface micromachining process. An array of 4 \u03bcm \u00d7 4 \u03bcm holes with a pitch\nsize of 9 \u03bcm was designed on the proof mass to help with releasing the\nstructure. The additional benefit of these release holes is that they act as\nvapor access holes to enhance the infiltration of a-SiC filler into the CNT\narray^20.\n\nFig. 5: A schematic of the accelerometer.\n\na Typical structure of a MEMS comb-type accelerometer, b single-meandered\nspring, c double-meandered spring\n\nFull size image\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Analytical model for an accelerometer\n\nThe accelerometer capacitance as a function of the acceleration C(a) is\nexpressed as follows:\n\n$$C\\left(a\\right)=\\frac{\\varepsilon {N}_{f}{L}_{f}h}{{d}_{0}-({Ma}/2k)}\\approx\n{C}_{0}\\left(1+\\frac{{Ma}}{2{d}_{0}k}\\right){{\\rm{where}}}\\,{C}_{0}=\\frac{\\varepsilon\n{N}_{f}{L}_{f}h}{{d}_{0}}$$\n\n(1)\n\nand the sensitivity to acceleration (S) is\n\n$$S=\\frac{{C}_{o}M}{{2d}_{0}k}$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the permittivity of the media, N_f is the number of fingers, L_f is\nthe overlap length between the fixed fingers and movable fingers, h is the\nthickness of the SiC-CNT composite, d_0 is the initial distance between two\nfingers, C_0 is the nominal capacitance without acceleration, M is the mass of\nthe proof mass, and k is the stiffness of the folded spring structure. To\nobtain better sensitivity, a higher C_0 is desired. To realize this design\ngoal, N_f, L_f, and h should be kept as high as possible, while d_0 should be\nminimized. Considering the footprint of the device, N_f and L_f are decided to\nbe 26 and 105 \u03bcm, respectively. The height of the SiC-CNT array is 10 \u03bcm,\nresulting in an aspect ratio of approximately 3 to minimize the shadowing\neffect and to produce mechanically robust structures. Here, as a proof-of-\nconcept design, the geometry tends to be conservative; thus, the aspect ratio\nis not designed to be the highest that we can achieve. d_0 is kept at 3 \u03bcm\nbecause individual CNTs in the current growth recipe sometimes protrude from\nthe CNT bundle, which will cause a short circuit between the plates if d_0 is\ntoo small. Based on the above device dimensions, C_0 is approximately 80.5 fF,\nand the mass of the shuttle M can be estimated to be 9.06 ng.\n\nAs per Eq. (2), the spring constant k also plays an important role in the\naccelerometer sensitivity. Figure 5b shows a typical folded spring, with two\nsegments of length L_1 and L_2 on each side. From^31, k of such a structure\ncan be expressed as:\n\n$$k=\\left(\\frac{{\\pi\n}^{4}}{6}\\right)\\frac{E{W}^{3}h}{{(2{L}_{1})}^{3}+{(2{L}_{2})}^{3}}$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere W is the width of the beam. In the actual design, two folded springs are\ncascaded together for a smaller k, as shown in Fig. 5c. The first spring has\nL_1 = 190 \u03bcm and L_2 = 170 \u03bcm, and for the second spring, L_1 = L_2 = 190 \u03bcm.\nThe effective k of the cascaded spring is approximately 16.81 N/m.\n\nAccording to the estimated C_0, M, k, and the process parameter d_0, the\nsensitivity of the designed accelerometer is calculated to be 0.07 fF/g. The\nmechanical properties of the composite, i.e., density and Young\u2019s modulus, are\nassumed to be determined only by the filling material during the estimation of\nM and k.\n\n### Accelerometer fabrication\n\nThe fabrication steps of the SiC-CNT accelerometer are summarized in Fig. 6.\nThe process starts with a bare 100 mm silicon wafer (Fig. 6a). A 3000 nm SiO_2\nlayer is deposited on the substrate not only as a diffusion barrier but also\nas a sacrificial layer to enable the fabrication of a surface micromachined\ndevice (Fig. 6b). A bilayer consisting of 10 nm Ti (titanium) and 50 nm TiN\nwas then deposited by reactive sputtering. Ti (10 nm) was sputtered prior to\nthe TiN layer to enhance adhesion. The Ti/TiN stack is etched by dichlorine\n(Cl_2) and hydrogen bromide (HBr) at 25 \u00b0C to form electrical contacts,\nresulting in the cross-sections shown in Fig. 6c.\n\nFig. 6: Process overview of the SiC-CNT composite fabrication method.\n\na A bare Si substrate, b 3000 nm PECVD SiO_2 deposited on the Si wafer, c a\nTi/TiN layer sputtered and patterned as electrodes, d a catalyst stack\n(Al_2O_3/Fe) fabricated via the liftoff process, e a CNT array grown on the\nprepatterned catalyst, f a porous CNT template filled with LPCVD a-SiC, g dry\netching performed on the entire sample to expose the contact area and the\nsacrificial layer, h a sample metallized by aluminum, followed by VHF to\nrelease suspended structures\n\nFull size image\n\nThe substrate is patterned with negative-tone photoresist, where the mass,\nspring, fingers, and anchor areas are left open for evaporation. Then, the\ncatalyst stack for CNT growth, i.e., Al_2O_3 and Fe, was evaporated as\ndescribed previously in section 2. After evaporation, the unwanted area of the\ncatalyst material was removed by N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) at 70 \u00b0C with the\naid of an ultrasonic bath (Fig. 6d). Using an Aixtron Blackmagic CVD system, a\nVACNT array with a height of approximately 10 \u03bcm was grown on the prepatterned\ncatalyst produced by the lift-off process, as shown in Fig. 6e. The height of\nthe CNT arrays has some non-uniformity across the wafer. From the edge to the\ncenter of the 4-inch wafer, the CNT height varies from 9.6 \u03bcm to 11.2 \u03bcm. This\nvariance mainly occurs due to the non-uniform temperature distribution\nresulting from the single-zone heating design of the CVD tool. After CNT\ngrowth, a thick layer of a-SiC (90 nm) was deposited by LPCVD to fill the\nVACNT array (Fig. 6f). The thickness of the a-SiC coating was measured with a\nSi dummy wafer (the same deposition as the process wafer), and the actual\nthickness was 89.25 nm, with a standard deviation of 0.68 nm. A thick a-SiC\nlayer is used to minimize the voids between the CNTs and to achieve\nmechanically robust suspended structures. As shown in Fig. 6f, a-SiC\ndeposition not only infiltrates CNTs but also deposits SiC on the entire\nwafer, thus forming a floor layer that covers the sacrificial oxide and TiN\ncontact pads. This floor layer prevents the sacrificial layer from releasing\nby vapor hydrogen fluoride (VHF). Additionally, the metal pads cannot have\nproper connections with instruments with a non-conductive a-SiC on top. Hence,\na blanket dry etching step is performed to remove the thin a-SiC layer on the\nentire wafer, i.e., no photoresist is used to pattern the wafer. Due to the\npoor selectivity of dry etching, a low-power dry etching recipe was used to\navoid over-etching of the TiN pads and excessive etching of the CNT arrays.\nThe etching was carried out for 90 s by a Sentech Etchlab 200 plasma etcher\nusing 13.5 sccm sulfur hexafluoride (SF_6) and 3.5 sccm oxygen (O_2) at a\npressure of 8 \u03bcbar and an RF power of 50 W. This recipe removes most of the\ncovering a-SiC without significantly affecting the height of the array (Fig.\n6g).\n\nAluminum metallization was applied prior to the VHF release of the structure.\nAn aluminum metallization layer was used on top of the TiN pads because we\nfound that the TiN layer was corroded during VHF release. The final step is to\nrelease the structure by VHF. A slow etching recipe was used to create a\ncontrollable etching process. The mixture consisted of 310 sccm HF, 350 sccm\nethanol and 1250 sccm of nitrogen (N_2) was used, which yielded a SiO_2\netching rate of 470 nm/min. A schematic cross-section of the final device is\nshown in Fig. 6h.\n\nThe completed device was inspected via SEM, and a full view of the device is\nshown in Fig. 7a. Figure 7b shows the array of the interdigitated fingers. A\nclose-up view of the finger is shown in Fig. 7c, where no physical contact can\nbe found between the movable and static capacitor plates. The gap distance\nbetween the fingers d_0 is crucial for determining the base capacitance of the\ndevice, so the gap distances of 30 pairs of fingers were measured. The average\ngap distance is 3.04 \u03bcm, which is very close to the design value of d_0 (3\n\u03bcm). The existing manufacturing error may be attributed to the lithography\nstep, including undesired effects such as overexposure. The green line in 7c\nindicates the feature edge, and the edge line roughness is calculated to be\n297 nm. In Fig. 7d, the sidewall profile of the SiC-CNT composite shows a\nnearly 90\u00b0 angle due to the vertical growth of the CNT array. In Fig. 7e, one\nof the 4 \u00d7 4 \u03bcm^2 release holes is shown, which allows a mild VHF recipe to\nrelease the structure. Figure 7f shows a 90\u00b0 tilted view of the suspended part\nof the device, where no sagging can be observed. These findings demonstrated\nthat the composite can fabricate a stiff enough structure for surface\nmicromachined devices.\n\nFig. 7: SEM inspection of the fabricated device.\n\na A full view of the accelerometer fabricated from the SiC-CNT composite (AA\u2019\ncross section corresponds to Fig. 6h). b Array of interdigitated fingers\nattached to the mass. c A zoomed-in view of a pair of fingers with the average\ngap distance indicated, and the green line indicates the feature edges. d The\nsidewall profile of the SiC-CNT composite. e A 4 \u00d7 4 \u03bcm^2 releasing hole on\nthe mass. f A side view of the suspended structure, where the gap can be\nclearly identified.

For each measurement point, a DC voltage bias\nV_bias is applied to the capacitor, sweeping from \u22125 V to +5 V with a step of\n100 mV. The measured C(V_bias) curve is plotted in Fig. 8a. At zero bias, the\nmeasured capacitance is 79.32 fF, which is close to the estimated C_0.\n\nFig. 8: Capacitance measurement on the accelerometer.\n\na Measured capacitance at the rest position and the extracted k when \u22125 V \u2264\nV_bias \u2264 5 V. b Measured rest-capacitance at different temperatures\n\nFull size image\n\nFigure 8a also shows that the capacitance is not constant with a given V_bias sweep. With larger | V_bias |, the capacitor plates move toward each other due to the electrostatic force F_es, leading to an increase in capacitance. This change in capacitance induced by F_es provides additional evidence that the proof mass is fully suspended over the substrate. Leveraging these data, the spring constant can be extracted. For each bias point, the equilibrium of forces is assumed to be applicable to the suspended proof mass, where F_es is equal to the force induced by the deformation on the spring (F_spring):\n\n$${F}_{{es}}={F}_{{spring}}$$\n\n(4)\n\nand,\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\\qquad\\,\\,{F}_{{es}}=\\frac{{Q}^{2}}{2\\varepsilon\n{N}_{f}{L}_{f}h}\\\\\\ \\quad{F}_{{spring}}=2k\\cdot \\Delta\nd({V}_{{bias}})\\end{array}$$\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Q is the amount of charge on the capacitor, which equals\nC(V_bias)\u00b7V_bias,\n\n\u2206d(V_bias) is the displacement of the proof mass due to F_es at different\nV_bias;\n\n$$\\Delta d\\left({V}_{{bias}}\\right)=\\frac{\\varepsilon\n{N}_{f}{L}_{f}h}{{C}_{0}}-\\frac{\\varepsilon\n{N}_{f}{L}_{f}h}{C\\left({V}_{{bias}}\\right)}$$\n\n(6)\n\nCombining Eqs. (4), (5), and (6), k is expressed as follows:\n\n$$k=\\frac{{[C\\left({V}_{{bias}}\\right){V}_{{bias}}]}^{2}}{4{\\varepsilon\n}^{2}{N}_{f}^{2}{L}_{f}^{2}{h}^{2}[\\frac{1}{{C}_{0}}-\\frac{1}{C({V}_{{bias}})}]}$$\n\n(7)\n\nWith Eq. (7), the spring constant can be extracted from the experimental\nC(V_bias) curve. As plotted in Fig. 8a, the extracted k is approximately 8.64\nN/m, which is approximately half of the estimated value. This result indicates\nthat the SiC-CNT composite has a lower Young\u2019s modulus than that of the bulk\nSiC. According to Eq. (3), Young\u2019s modulus of the composite coated with 90 nm\nSiC can be extracted and is 169.61 GPa. This is 3 orders of magnitude\nimprovement over the uncoated CNT array^32. Compared to ref. ^21, it can also\nbe concluded that the Young\u2019s modulus of the composite can be increased by\ndepositing more filler material. In separate work, we recently demonstrated\nthat the mechanical properties of the composite do not degrade up to at least\n900 \u00b0C^33.\n\nThe rest capacitance was also measured at elevated temperatures to investigate\nthe high-temperature compatibility of the nanocomposite. In situ capacitive\nmeasurements were conducted from room temperature to 200 \u00b0C. The result is\nshown in Fig. 8b. We can see that the capacitance increases with temperature.\nAn explanation for this effect may be that the fingers expand with respect to\ntemperature, inducing an increasing overlapping area as well as a reduced gap\nof the capacitor.\n\nThe accelerometer was also measured on a shaker to verify its response to the\nvibrating environment. A schematic overview of the corresponding setup is\nshown in Fig. 9a. The device was packaged in a dual inline package and mounted\non a shaker, as shown in Fig. 9b. The shaker was driven by a sinusoidal wave\nat a certain frequency (f = 90 Hz). By tuning the amplitude of the excitation\nsignal, different accelerations can be applied to the device. The acceleration\nprofile was recorded in real time by a commercial accelerometer, as shown in\nFig. 9c, where the amplitude of the acceleration (a_max) increases from 0 to\n14.8 m/s^2 by steps.\n\nFig. 9: An overview of the measurement setup and results.\n\na A schematic overview of the measurement setup for the vibration test. b The\npackaged chip on the dual inline package. c Real-time measured acceleration\napplied to the device and the sensed current (I_sense). d Derived capacitance\nchange with respect to the acceleration\n\nFull size image\n\nThe capacitance change induced by the acceleration is extremely small due to\nthe low sensitivity (estimated to be 0.07 fF/g). Therefore, direct measurement\nis difficult, and the acceleration versus capacitance change is indirectly\nmeasured. As the accelerometer\u2019s movement on the shaker can be approximated as\nsimple harmonic motion, the acceleration can be considered sinusoidal.\nAccording to Eq. (1), the capacitance of the sensor is also a sine curve with\nan amplitude of \u2206C(a_max). The accelerometer was biased at 10 V (V_DC) by a\nconstant voltage supply. While shaking, the capacitance changes induce a\ncurrent, which is sensed by a lock-in amplifier (LIA). The sensed current\n(I_sense) was recorded at the same time as the acceleration and is plotted in\nFig. 9c. The measured current demonstrates distinguishable output levels as\nwell as a fast response with respect to different applied accelerations.\nWithin half a period (T/2), we define:\n\n$${I}_{{sense}}\\cdot \\frac{T}{2}={V}_{{DC}}\\cdot {\\int\n}_{0}^{\\frac{T}{2}}\\Delta C\\left({a}_{\\max }\\right)\\cdot \\sin \\left(2\\pi\n{ft}\\right){{\\rm{d}}t}$$\n\n(8)\n\nFrom this equation, the change in capacitance as a function of acceleration\ncan be calculated; thus, the sensitivity can be approximated by linear\nfitting. The calculated result is plotted in Fig. 9d. The coefficient of\ndetermination (R^2) of the linear fit is 97.38%, and the slope of the linear\nfit curve reveals that the accelerometer sensitivity is approximately 0.14\nfF/g. The measured sensitivity is 2 times greater than the theoretical value.\nThis discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the spring is less stiff\nthan predicted, which results in a higher sensitivity of the sensor. Although\nthe current sensitivity of the device is relatively low compared to that of\nmature Si-based devices, it can still be improved by geometric optimization,\nsuch as increasing the rest capacitance, and fabricating springs with less\nstiffness.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we utilized a VACNT array coated with LPCVD a-SiC to produce a\nSiC-CNT composite, aiming to overcome the bottleneck in fabricating HAR SiC\nstructures. Due to the fast growth rate and vertical growth property of CNTs,\nthe prepatterned CNT array provides an excellent template for fabricating HAR\nmicrostructures. By taking advantage of the porous nature of CNT bundles,\na-SiC filler can easily penetrate the CNT template and be uniformly coated on\neach fiber, thus densifying the structure. The electrical resistivity of the\ncomposite and the contact properties were studied by the ELM and TLM\nstructures. The conductivity of the SiC-CNT composite was 10^7 times greater\nthan that of the a-SiC filler material. The TCR of the composite is\napproximately \u2212315 ppm/K, which is similar to that of pure CNTs. The contact\nresistivity of the SiC-CNT/TiN interface is 4.63 \u00d7 10^\u22124 \u03a9 cm^2.\n\nA surface micromachined accelerometer was designed and fabricated to\ndemonstrate using the composite in MEMS applications. The nominal capacitance\naligns with the design value, and the C-V curve indicates that the device was\nsuccessfully suspended. The Young\u2019s modulus of the composite is extracted from\nthe measured spring constant, which is 169.61 GPa. The high-temperature test\nshowed that the composite has the potential to be applied in harsh\nenvironments. The measured sensitivity of the accelerometer is 0.14 fF/g\n(based on an indirect measurement). Continued work on the mechanical\ncharacterization of the composite, real-time measurement of the capacitive\noutput, and integration with ASIC are planned.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
