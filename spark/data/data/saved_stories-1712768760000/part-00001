Cations are positively charged because they\nhave lost electrons, while anions are negatively charged because they have\ngained electrons. Another way to remember is to think of the \"t\" in cations as\nstanding for \"positive\" and the \"n\" in anions as standing for \"negative.\"\nThese mnemonics can help you recall the difference between the two types of\nions.\n\nMarty Bakk\n\nAuthor has 344 answers and 261.5K answer views\n\n5y\n\nA2A\n\nThe word \u2018negative\u2019 starts with \u2018n\u2019.
