In each case, the hackers have posted\nvideos to the social media platform Telegram that show screen recordings of\ntheir chaotic manipulation of so-called human-machine interfaces, software\nthat controls physical equipment inside those target networks. The apparent\nvictims of that hacking include multiple US water utilities in Texas, one\nPolish wastewater treatment plant, and, reportedly, a French water mill, which\nthe hackers claimed was a French hydroelectric dam. It\u2019s unclear exactly how\nmuch disruption or damage the hackers may have managed against any of those\nfacilities.\n\nA new report published today by cybersecurity firm Mandiant draws a link\nbetween that hacker group and Sandworm, which has been identified for years as\nUnit 74455 of Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. Mandiant found\nevidence that Sandworm helped create Cyber Army of Russia Reborn and tracked\nmultiple instances when data stolen from networks that Sandworm had attacked\nwas later leaked by the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn group. Mandiant couldn't\ndetermine, however, whether Cyber Army of Russia Reborn is merely one of the\nmany cover personas that Sandworm has adopted to disguise its activities over\nthe last decade or instead a distinct group that Sandworm helped to create and\ncollaborated with but which is now operating independently.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nEither way, Cyber Army of Russia Reborn\u2019s hacking has now, in some respects,\nbecome even more brazen than Sandworm itself, says John Hultquist, who leads\nMandiant\u2019s threat-intelligence efforts and has tracked Sandworm\u2019s hackers for\nnearly a decade. He points out that Sandworm has never directly targeted a US\nnetwork with a disruptive cyberattack\u2014only planted malware on US networks in\npreparation for one or, in the case of its 2017 NotPetya ransomware attack,\ninfected US victims indirectly with self-spreading code. Cyber Army of Russia\nReborn, by contrast, hasn\u2019t hesitated to cross that line.\n\n\u201cEven though this group is operating under this persona that\u2019s tied to\nSandworm, they do seem more reckless than any Russian operator we\u2019ve ever seen\ntargeting the United States,\u201d Hultquist says. \u201cThey\u2019re actively manipulating\noperational technology systems in a way that\u2019s highly aggressive, probably\ndisruptive, and dangerous.\u201d\n\n## An Overflowed Tank and a French Rooster\n\nMandiant didn't have access to the targeted water utility and hydroelectric\nplant networks, so wasn't able to determine how Cyber Army of Russian Reborn\ngot access to those networks. One of the group\u2019s videos posted in mid-January,\nhowever, shows what appears to be a screen recording that captures the\nhackers\u2019 manipulation of software interfaces for the control systems of water\nutilities in the Texas towns of Abernathy and Muleshoe. \u201cWe are starting our\nnext raid across the USA,\u201d reads a message introducing the video on Telegram.\n\u201cIn this video there are a couple of critical infrastructure objects, namely\nwater supply systems\ud83d\ude0b\u201d\n\nA screen recording shows Cyber Army of Russian Reborn clicking buttons on the\ninterface of a water utility in Texas.\n\nCyber Army of Russia Reborn via Telegram\n\nThe video then shows the hackers frenetically clicking around the target\ninterface, changing values and settings for both utilities\u2019 control systems.\nThough it\u2019s not clear what effects that manipulation may have had, the Texas\nnewspaper The Plainview Herald reported in early February that local officials\nhad acknowledged the cyberattacks and confirmed some level of disruption. The\ncity manager for Muleshoe, Ramon Sanchez, reportedly said in a public meeting\nthat the attack on the town\u2019s utility had resulted in one water tank\noverflowing. Officials for the nearby towns of Abernathy and Hale Center\u2014a\ntarget not mentioned in the hackers\u2019 video\u2014also said they\u2019d been hit. All\nthree towns\u2019 utilities, as well as another, in Lockney, reportedly disabled\ntheir software to prevent its exploitation, but officials said that service to\nthe water utilities\u2019 customers was never interrupted. (WIRED reached out to\nofficials from Muleshoe and Abernathy but didn't immediately hear back.)\n\nAnother screen recording shows Cyber Army of Russian Reborn tampering with the\ncontrol systems of a Polish wastewater treatment plant, seemingly changing\nsettings at radom.\n\nCyber Army of Russia Reborn via Telegram\n\nAnother video the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn hackers posted in January shows\nwhat appears to be a screen recording of a similar attempted sabotage of a\nwastewater utility in Wydminy, a village in Poland, a country whose government\nhas been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in the midst of Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cHi\neverybody, today we will play with the Polish wastewater treatment plants.\nEnjoy watching!\u201d says an automated Russian voice at the beginning of the\nvideo. The video then shows the hackers flipping switches and changing values\nin the software, set to a Super Mario Bros. soundtrack. The Wydminy facility\ndidn't respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment.\n\nA third screen recording shows Cyber Army of Russia Reborn's access to what\nthey believed was a French water utility, but is reportedly a small-town water\nmill.\n\nCyber Army of Russia Reborn via Telegram\n\nIn a third video, published in March, the hackers similarly record themselves\ntampering with the control system for what they describe as the Courlon Sur\nYonne hydroelectric dam in France. In fact, the French newspaper Le Monde\nrevealed Wednesday that they had instead accessed the control system for a\nsmall water mill running through a village of 300 people. That video was\nposted just after French president Emmanuel Macron had made public statements\nsuggesting he would send French military personnel to Ukraine to aid in its\nwar against Russia. The video starts by showing Macron in the form of a\nrooster holding a French flag. \u201cWe recently heard a French rooster crowing,\u201d\nthe video says. \u201cToday we\u2019ll take a look at the Courlon dam and have a little\nfun. Enjoy watching, friends. Glory to Russia!\u201d\n\nIn their Telegram post, the hackers claim to have lowered the French dam\u2019s\nwater level and stopped the flow of electricity it produced, though according\nto Le Monde, they failed to even affect the small water mill they actually\ntampered with.\n\nIn the videos, the hackers do display some knowledge of how a water utility\nworks, as well as some ignorance and random switch-flipping, says Gus Serino,\nthe founder of cybersecurity firm I&C Secure and a former staffer at a water\nutility and at the infrastructure cybersecurity firm Dragos. Serino notes that\nthe hackers did, for instance, change the \u201cstop level\u201d for water tanks in the\nTexas utilities, which could have triggered the overflow that officials\nmentioned. But he notes that they also made other seemingly arbitrary changes,\nparticularly for the Wydminy wastewater plant, that would have had no effect.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n\u201cYou can see them flipping through all kinds of stuff just to click the\nbutton,\u201d Serino says. \u201cI would say there\u2019s some level of understanding but not\na full understanding of how the system works.\u201d\n\n## Signs of Sandworm\n\nMandiant found multiple strong clues that Cyber Army of Russia was, at the\nvery least, created with support from Sandworm if not entirely controlled by\nthat unit of the GRU. YouTube accounts for Cyber Army of Russia were set up\nfrom an IP address known to be controlled by Sandworm, Google\u2019s Threat\nAnalysis Group found. (Mandiant, like YouTube, is a Google subsidiary.) On\nmultiple occasions, Sandworm has also carried out what Mandiant\u2019s Hultquist\ncalls \u201cattack-and-leak\u201d operations against Ukrainian targets: Sandworm would\npenetrate the victim's network and infect it with wiper malware to destroy the\ncontents of machines\u2014but not before stealing the data from the network, which\nin several cases was later leaked in posts on Cyber Army of Russia Reborn's\nTelegram account.\n\nHultquist notes that Cyber Army of Russia Reborn's relatively \u201chaphazard\u201d\nhacking\u2014and its entirely faulty targeting of what the hackers may have\nbelieved was a French dam\u2014doesn't appear to match the style of Sandworm, which\nhas, despite its incredibly callous cyberattacks, shown somewhat more\ndeliberation in its targeting and methods. That may suggest an unusual\nsituation, one in which a state-sponsored group created a more grassroots\nfront that has now gone on to carry out even more reckless operations of its\nown. The GRU, Hultquist says, has \u201cprobably been involved in creating this\ngroup and running it. If someone even more aggressive than them comes along\nand operates in that space, carrying out these attacks, they\u2019re not entirely\nblameless.\u201d\n\nEven as Sandworm's apparent spinoff carries out its chaotic attacks,\nMandiant's report notes that Sandworm itself has shifted somewhat away from\nthe more opportunistic disruptive operations it has carried out in the past.\nIn the first year of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it launched repeated wiper\nattacks against Ukrainian targets\u2014many of the relentless, quick-and-dirty\ndata-destroying strikes that Mandiant had previously attributed to the GRU as\na whole were specifically the work of Sandworm, it has now concluded. Sandworm\nalso carried out a third blackout attack in 2022, this time in concert with a\nmissile strike on the same area. More recently, however, Sandworm has\nincreasingly taken on an espionage and support role for Russia's physical war\neffort, the company's report notes.\n\nThat more careful coordination with Russia's physical forces has included an\noperation in which Sandworm used a piece of spyware that US government\nagencies dubbed Infamous Chisel to infect Android devices used by the\nUkrainian military for command-and-control, an apparent effort to gain\nbattlefield intelligence. Mandiant also points to a website set up on a\nSandworm-linked server that appears to be a tool for Russian troops to\nexfiltrate data from captured smartphones, including links for extracting\nmessages from apps like Signal and Telegram.\n\n\u201cAs their war aims have evolved, we've seen the group evolve as well,\u201d says\nDan Black, a Mandiant analyst and coauthor of its Sandworm report who served\nas NATO's deputy head of cyber threat intelligence until last year. Black says\nSandworm, like much of the Russian military, has had to change its approach,\nadapting to that espionage and support role as Russia's initial aim of quickly\ntoppling Ukraine's government has shifted into a protracted war of attrition.\n\u201cWhat we see is a real pivot away from that wiping activity toward espionage\nfor battlefield enablement,\u201d Black says.\n\nEven as Sandworm shifts into that more traditional military intelligence role,\nhowever, the Cyber Army of Russia group that it likely helped to create\ncontinues to run wild with disruptive operations, far beyond the front lines\nof Russia's war in Ukraine. If that spinoff hacker outfit is truly independent\nof Sandworm, Mandiant's Hultquist notes, that may mean it will continue to\ndemonstrate even less caution or discretion than the GRU's own hackers have.\n\n\u201cSomeone under this persona is doing some really aggressive stuff, and they\u2019re\ndoing it globally, and they could ultimately cause a very real incident,\u201d\nHultquist says. \u201cIf this is just some random group of hacktivists who lack the\nstructure and restraint of a military organization, they may cross lines in\nways that no one anticipates.\u201d\n\nUpdated 4/17/2024 9:40 am ET: French newspaper Le Monde reported on Wednesday\nthat the French hydroelectric dam Cyber Army of Russia Reborn claims to have\nbreached was, instead, a small town's water mill. We've updated this story to\nreflect that reporting.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * Hackers found a way to open 3 million hotel keycard locks\n\n  * A couple decided to decarbonize their home.
