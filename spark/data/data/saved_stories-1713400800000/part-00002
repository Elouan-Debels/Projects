(Eric Matuzsan)\n\nListen\n\n13 min\n\nShare\n\nComment883\n\nSave\n\nLess than two weeks after Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge was destroyed\nby an out-of-control cargo ship, another huge container ship passed beneath a\nbusy bridge connecting New York and New Jersey and then suddenly decelerated\nin a narrow artery of one of the nation\u2019s largest ports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a dead ship,\u201d said a voice over the maritime radio a short time later,\ninvoking an industry term that often refers to a ship that is unable to move\non it own.\n\nThree tug boats helped shepherd the APL Qingdao \u2014 a vessel more than 1,100\nfeet long and flying under the flag of Malta \u2014 from where it lost propulsion\nnear the Bayonne Bridge to a safe location, authorities said. The ship dropped\nanchor just upstream from the even busier Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which\ncarries about 200,000 vehicles per day.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe April 5 incident is one of hundreds in which massive cargo ships lost\npropulsion, many near bridges and ports, according to a Washington Post\nanalysis of Coast Guard records.\n\nThe findings indicate that the kind of failure that preceded the March 26\nBaltimore bridge collapse \u2014 the 984-foot Dali is believed to have lost the\nability to propel itself forward as it suffered a more widespread power outage\n\u2014 was far from a one-off among the increasingly large cargo ships that\nroutinely sail close to critical infrastructure.\n\nAround Baltimore alone, ships lost propulsion nearly two dozen times in the\nthree years before the tragedy last month, the Post review found \u2014 including a\nNovember 2021 incident in which a 981-foot container ship lost propulsion for\n15 minutes soon after it passed under the Key Bridge. In 2020, a ship the same\nsize as the Dali lost propulsion \u201cin the vicinity of the Bay Bridge\u201d near\nAnnapolis, records show.\n\nAdding to the danger, experts say, is a lack of consistent rules on when cargo\nships should be escorted by tug boats that can keep them on course even if\nengines turn off. While tugboats escorted the Qingdao, as was called for under\nlocal guidelines in the New York area, those attending to the Dali departed\nbefore it struck the bridge in Baltimore, where such decisions are left to\nship captains and local pilots, the specially trained sailors who guide ships\nin and out of ports.\n\nContainer ships like the Dali and the Qingdao have doubled in size over the\npast two decades, experts said, while some American ports \u2014 built up over\ncenturies around busy and cramped waterways \u2014 have struggled to adapt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve understood fully the consequences of these ships, of\nthese large ships, operating in these ports,\u201d said Aaron Davenport, a retired\nsenior Coast Guard officer and expert in maritime safety with the nonprofit\nresearch organization Rand.\n\nThe Post analysis found that 424 cargo ships longer than 600 feet reported\nlosing propulsion \u2014 meaning the engines were shut down \u2014 in U.S. waters over\nthe past three years. About a quarter of the incidents occurred near a port,\nbridge or other infrastructure, the analysis found.\n\nThe records on propulsion loss were up to date through March 17, before the\nincidents involving the Dali and the Qingdao. After reports of the Qingdao\nincident surfaced on social media, the Coast Guard said the ship suffered a\nloss of propulsion.\n\nIn some cases reviewed by The Post, engines suddenly cut out. In others, crews\nwere compelled to shut them down to deal with operating problems. The owner\nand operator of the APL Qingdao said that its engine was shut down in a\n\u201ccontrolled\u201d manner after an engine alarm was triggered and that the ship did\nnot lose electrical power.\n\nTracked locations of APL Qingdao\n\n8:17 p.m.\n\n8:16 p.m.\n\nSpeed: 0.5\n\nA tug arrived to help the vessel, according to Marine Traffic data.

Two other\ntugs were already nearby, serving as escorts.\n\nVerrazzano Narrows Bridge\n\nStaten Island\n\n1 MILE\n\nIn Baltimore, a pilots\u2019 association has said the Dali lost engine and\nelectrical power before it hit the Key Bridge on March 26, and National\nTransportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said investigators believe\nproblems with the electrical system were connected to the loss of control of\nthe ship. The FBI has opened a criminal probe that will look at least in part\nat whether the crew left the port knowing the vessel had serious systems\nproblems, The Post reported this week.\n\nThe Coast Guard reports identified several instances of ships striking objects\nafter losing propulsion, including in one case a grain dock in the Lower\nMississippi River. Other vessels were reported to have run aground near\ninfrastructure after losing propulsion.\n\nCoast Guard investigators found many causes for propulsion loss, the records\nshow. In some instances, a total loss of electrical power led to an engine\nshutdown; in others, the electrical system stayed online, but propulsion was\nlost because of mechanical and equipment failures. Valves malfunctioned, seals\nfailed, and filters were clogged.\n\nIn some cases, poor maintenance or deterioration were blamed for faulty\nequipment. In others, human error was blamed, including one case in which a\nship got underway while an engineer was still doing work on the fuel system.\nIn dozens of instances, investigators reported that tugboats had assisted\nships to safety after they lost propulsion.\n\nShips are at particular risk of losing propulsion when crews are maneuvering\nin confined waters such as ports, which can place additional demands on power\nsystems, according to a 2017 report by the London P&I Club, a leading maritime\ninsurance firm. Crews changing the type of fuel being used while the ship is\nunderway to comply with regional environmental regulations has also increased\nthe number of propulsion-loss incidents, the report said.\n\nJoseph Ahlstrom, a professor at the State University of New York\u2019s Maritime\nCollege, said in an interview that the frequency of propulsion loss points to\na risk that must be better managed. Ahlstrom said he hopes the use of tugboats\n\u2014 which routinely help ships dock and undock but can also guide vessels that\nhave lost propulsion to safety \u2014 would become more widespread after the\nBaltimore disaster.\n\n\u201cMost regulations are written in blood,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cIt takes something\nlike this for people to say, \u2018Whoa, we should do something.\u2019\u201d\n\n###\n\n\u2018Our ports are vulnerable\u2019\n\nShips traveling in U.S. waters are required by federal law to report any loss\nof propulsion to the nearest Coast Guard command. The Post reviewed hundreds\nof such reports filed to authorities along the coasts, focusing on those\ninvolving ships greater than 600 feet.\n\nWhile some of the 424 incidents occurred farther from shore in rivers and\nbays, in 103 instances, the ships suffered a loss of propulsion near a port,\nbridge or other infrastructure, according to the Coast Guard records.\n\nCapt. John Konrad, founder of the shipping news website gCaptain, said The\nPost\u2019s findings were cause for concern.\n\n\u201cOur ports are vulnerable,\u201d said Konrad, who was first to report on the\nQingdao incident in New York. \u201cAmerica has to decide \u2014 do we want to invest in\nvessel traffic service, stronger bridges, better maritime Coast Guard\ninvestigators? Or do we want to roll the dice?\u201d\n\nIn the case of the Agios Dimitrios, the ship that lost propulsion in 2021\nafter passing the Key Bridge as it sailed toward port in Baltimore,\ninvestigators concluded that an electrical fault made the engine\nnonresponsive. Two tugs had been with the ship at the time, and a third joined\nto assist it back under the bridge to an anchorage near Annapolis for repairs.\n\nGlobal Ship Lease, owner of the Agios Dimitrios, said in a statement to The\nPost that the crew followed \u201cestablished operating protocols.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn close coordination with local tug operators and the Coast Guard, the\nvessel was able to undergo prompt repairs and proceed without further\nincident,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn March 2022, an engine problem and strong winds combined to push a\n1,200-foot container ship out of a shipping channel near Norfolk, Coast Guard\nrecords show. The chief engineer of the Toledo Triumph requested that the\nship\u2019s engines be shut down after engine room fire alarms went off.\n\nAt first, according to the investigation report, the ship remained under\ncontrol. But water leaking from an engine cooling system turned to steam and\ntripped a separate alarm, preventing the crew from restarting the engine. As\nthe huge ship lost speed, it began to drift, and \u2014 pushed by winds of almost\n40 mph \u2014 it eventually ran aground. The ship suffered no significant damage\nand freed itself as the tide rose.\n\nShoei Kisen Kaisha, the Japanese company that manages the Toledo Triumph,\ndeclined to comment.\n\n###\n\nNo uniform standard for tugboats\n\nThere is no single standard for the use of tugs to escort large ships in and\nout of ports in the United States, experts said. Instead, their use is\ndetermined by a patchwork of federal and state laws, formal guidelines, long-\nstanding practices, the judgments of individual pilots and the financial\nincentives of ship owners.\n\nAs container ships have become larger, maritime officials in New York and New\nJersey have developed standards for managing the arrival into the port\noperated jointly by the states, issuing guidelines on tides, visibility and\nthe use of tugs.\n\nFor vessels 997 feet and longer, the guidelines say, two tugs should be on\nhand at the Narrows, the stretch of water between Staten Island and Brooklyn.\nAs many as five tugs can be required for the largest vessels passing through\nthe Kill Van Kull, the tidal strait between Staten Island and Bayonne, N.J.\n\nFederal laws passed since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill require tug escorts\nfor oil tankers heading into Prince William Sound in Alaska and Puget Sound in\nWashington state, with a similar state law governing ports in California.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Maryland Port Administration, which oversees the Baltimore port, and the\nVirginia Port Authority both said the use of tugs is a decision left to ship\ncaptains and to pilots.\n\nJoseph D. Harris, a spokesman for the Virginia agency, said the weather, the\nsize of a vessel and the volume of traffic are all factors pilots take into\naccount in making their decisions.\n\nJennifer Carpenter, the chief executive of American Waterways Operators, a\ntrade group for tug companies, said that given the diversity of ports in the\ncountry, different practices make sense. \u201cIt is important to take a port-\nspecific look at what are we trying to do here? What kind of traffic do we\nhave here? How fast are they going? How well are our bridges protected?\u201d\nCarpenter said. \u201cThose are all things that should go into an analysis.\u201d\n\nTug escort services cost thousands of dollars an hour, according to rate\nsheets published by major operators. Experts say some that ship owners are\nreluctant to use them as they look to keep costs down, and that some port\nauthorities oppose tugboat mandates for fear that charging extra fees will\nmake them lose business to competitors.\n\n\u201cA ship owner and his money are very hard to part, and unless you require it,\nthey\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d said Walter Nadolny, a professor emeritus at SUNY\nMaritime College. \u201cThey\u2019re not crazy about spending the money.\u201d\n\n###\n\nA \u2018dead ship\u2019 in the Kill Van Kull strait\n\nThe Qingdao arrived in New York on April 2 and, during a three-day stop,\nunloaded about 40,000 tons of imports, largely from India and Pakistan,\nranging from steel pipes to jasmine rice, according to cargo records.\n\nAt 7:29 p.m. on April 5, it set off from Staten Island\u2019s Howland Hook Marine\nTerminal, bound for Norfolk. The ship was escorted by three tugboats.\n\nThe Qingdao passed under the Bayonne Bridge, connecting New Jersey and Staten\nIsland, at 8 p.m., according to records from the shipping data service Kpler.\nAbout nine minutes later, as it moved eastward through the tight Kill Van Kull\nstrait, the ship slowed, eventually to 0.5 knots or about 0.6 miles per hour.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAt 8:17 p.m., tugboats began an operation to assist the Qingdao, Kpler records\nshow.\n\nAt 8:20 p.m., a voice on a marine radio channel covering the area said that\nthe Qingdao was experiencing difficulties. \u201cHe has lost propulsion,\u201d the\nunidentified voice said. \u201cLooks like he might be a dead ship there.\u201d The Post\nfound recordings of the remarks by reviewing marine radio traffic archived by\nBroadcastify.\n\nFederal regulations define a \u201cdead ship\u201d as one that has lost electrical power\nand for which backup systems \u201cfor bringing the main propulsion into operation\u201d\nare not available. Other authorities and maritime groups use the term for a\nvessel that has lost propulsion and steering.\n\nAt 8:24 p.m., a different voice came over the radio to say the Qingdao \u201chas\nlost engine power temporarily, has lost engine power but has regained it\nback.\u201d This person said the ship was headed for the Stapleton anchorage site\nnear the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which links Staten Island and Brooklyn.\n\nAbout 35 minutes later, a third voice on the radio said \u201cdead ship, just give\nme a little bit of time here,\u201d as an alarm seemed to blare in the background,\nand then a moment later says \u201cso we\u2019re a dead ship.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said in a statement that the Qingdao reported at about\n8:30 p.m. that it had lost propulsion in the Kill Van Kull. \u201cThe vessel\nregained propulsion and was assisted to safely anchor in Stapleton Anchorage\n... by three towing vessels,\u201d the statement said.\n\nJennifer Petrisko, a spokesperson for CMA CGM, the French shipping giant that\nowns the Qingdao, said in emails to The Post that the incident began when the\nship\u2019s main engine alarm sounded soon after it departed New York, \u201crestricting\nfull maneuvering.\u201d She did not respond when asked why the alarm activated.\n\nThe loss of propulsion was \u201ca controlled, agreed upon shutdown of the main\nengine with approval of the pilot and vessel command to temporarily fix an\nalarm,\u201d Petrisko said. She added that after inspections and tests, the ship\nwas declared seaworthy and was cleared by the Coast Guard to travel to\nVirginia. Records show that it departed Stapleton around 6 a.m. on April 6.\n\nRecords show that the Qingdao also experienced an engine problem that led to a\nloss of maneuverability as it left Savannah, Ga., on July 30. The Coast Guard\nfound that the crew had replaced fuel injectors with parts not recommended by\nthe engine\u2019s manufacturer and had failed to keep fuel at a proper temperature,\naccording to a summary of the investigation.\n\nPetrisko did not respond to questions about that incident.\n\nSamuel Granados contributed to this report.\n\n  * Video is said to show U.N. relief worker taking body of Israeli shot on Oct. 7\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nVideo is said to show U.N. relief worker taking body of Israeli shot on Oct. 7\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\n  * Mattis secretly advised Arab monarch on Yemen war, records show\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nMattis secretly advised Arab monarch on Yemen war, records show\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\n  * Precision equipment for Russian arms makers came from U.S.-allied Taiwan\n\nFebruary 1, 2024\n\nPrecision equipment for Russian arms makers came from U.S.-allied Taiwan\n\nFebruary 1, 2024\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
