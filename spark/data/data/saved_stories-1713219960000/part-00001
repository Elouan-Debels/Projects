Big embezzlers, small embezzlers, smart embezzlers and very smart\nembezzlers...\n\nThat\u2019s right, no dumb embezzlers because almost all the embezzlers we\nencounter are smart. Some are very smart. Some are brilliant.\n\nAnd, almost always, most would have made more money and had a more profitable\ncareer if they had simply stopped stealing and starting working honestly.\n\nI mean, figure it out. An embezzler has to not only do his or her job well so\nthat no one is looking over his or her shoulder but has to do their job so\nwell that they can steal for months or years and it won\u2019t show up. They have\nto be charismatic and knowledgeable enough so that no one bothers to double\ncheck their work. They have to be very steady in their work so that it cannot\nbe reviewed because they are on vacation or ill...in short, they have to be\ngreat employees. And either so boring that all ignore their existence or so\nwell liked that no one would question their character. Most choose the latter\nmode since it also allows access to more accounts and financial secrets.\n\nAnd when embezzlers run entire companies, they have to create a bottom line\nsuccessful enough for long enough that investors and business colleagues\nrespect and trust them after review of the books...at least for a time.\n\nTook me a long time to figure that out...for the first few years of practice,\nI found it incredible that such brilliant and attractive people would be dumb\nenough to risk it all for the relatively paltry gains that embezzlement can\nearn. I kept looking to see the underlying motivations since, I figured, I\ncould better advise clients what to look out for if I could figure out\nprecisely what makes an embezzler embezzle.\n\nNow I know.\n\nThey embezzle because they like it. They like the rush. They need money now,\nnot in five years. They like being smarter than the drudges they figure are\naround them. And they embezzle, I am convinced, because they want to get\ncaught sooner or later and that pattern is usually repeated over and over.\n\nTake one of my favorite embezzlers, a guy who once owned the famous Flamingo\nHotel in California until his world crumbled around him during a case our\nclient brought against him in the late 1970\u2019s. I had represented a minority\nshareholder in the venture and after perhaps a year of very aggressive\nlitigation, Eddie Chan (not his real name) called it quits, transferred the\nshell of a company that was left to my client along with most of the rest of\nhis assets, settled for a suspended sentence with the district attorney (to my\nfury) and then called me to invite me to lunch.\n\nI had only been practicing for five years at the time and was unused to the\nfoibles of opposing parties. I was nonplussed and immediately called his\ncounsel to ask if that would be OK...as required by the Code of Ethics.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d the relatively famous criminal defense attorney chirped, \u201cand tell him\nto pay my bill while you\u2019re at it.\u201d\n\nSo there I was two days later with Eddie at his favorite Italian restaurant,\nOrsi, watching him fiddle with his fettuccini, his hands nervously twitching\nevery so often, but immaculately dressed in a conservative business suit,\nexpensive cufflinks and watch, the picture of a successful and conservative\nbusiness man.\n\nHe had greeted me in a rather distracted manner, looking about the room, but\nfriendly enough. Since I had been instrumental in destroying his economic\nwell-being, and since he knew I had been demanding his incarceration for his\nembezzlement with the district attorney, I wondered why we were having this\nlunch. Cautious, I figured I\u2019d let him tell me. And, in turn, I\u2019d try to\nfigure out what made him tick.\n\nThe waiters all knew him. He was a regular and his waistline showed it.\nFriendly but not effusive, soft-spoken and understated, he appeared now as he\nhad been throughout the trial...a typical intelligent businessman slightly\nshocked that people were upset with him, but just maybe a hint of irony\nsomehow mixed into his replies. On the stand he had been asked what he had\ndone with the money.\n\n\u201cSpent it. I have none left. If I did, perhaps I would pay it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn what did you spend it? Are those assets in the United States at this\ntime?\"\n\nHe had stared at me for a moment, knowing I was looking for assets to attach,\nthen suddenly smiled sadly. \u201cI spent it on sweet, stupid things that make life\nan appropriate journey. Little things with some elegance attached. Things only\nworth buying because they have little value in the long run. Like life,\nitself.\u201d\n\nThere was some laughter in the court room but my client had begun to mutter\ndarkly at my side, furious that these \u201clittle things\u201d had bankrupted the\nhotel. As I sat there in that elegant restaurant, I decided that he had, for\nonce, been telling the truth.\n\n\u201cIs this lunch a little elegant thing to make life bearable, Eddie?\u201d I now\nasked.\n\nI thought he would smile but he looked at me steadily for the first time that\nafternoon. After a moment\u2019s silence, he said softly, \u201cYour courts are not used\nto hearing an honest statement, are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's that? You\u2019re telling me that you spent it all, nothing is left?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are still cross-examining me. You are still looking for assets. I am\nspeaking of honest answers. Of course I spent it. Why else take it? Money\ntaken like that should not be spent on necessities of life but on luxuries of\nlife. Necessities of life are the proper destination of grim jobs with little\nmen working at little desks.\u201d\n\nHe waved to the water to refill his wine glass. I was suddenly reminded of the\nmovie Casablanca in the coffee house with Sidney Greenstreet making a deal. I\nwas also angry. \u201cThose little people were your victims, Eddie. They work years\nand you take what they make and bankrupt businesses left and right. For\nluxuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I do. You are stating the obvious. What you are not stating is why\nit matters so much to arouse such passion. I am the one losing all. Not you\nand not your client. Do I appear upset?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t. He appeared bemused, not upset. He leaned forward. \u201cLook, that is\nthe past and I want to move forward. I want this to be a constructive\nmeeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeeting? Constructive meeting?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have an opportunity. You represent many clients who might be\ninterested. It should be very profitable.\u201d\n\nAnd for the next ten minutes he explained in some detail a new business\nventure he was considering involving Hong Kong property. Finally I could take\nit no longer.\n\n\u201cLook, Eddie,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. I\u2019m the guy who wanted\nyou in jail. Remember? I know you and your past. You seem to think I\u2019d tell my\nclients to invest in you. Are you nuts?\u201d\n\nHe was shocked. \u201cOf course you would. You already know who I am and what I do.\nYou don\u2019t have to worry about checking out my background. You can build all\nthe safeguards you need. This isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about the deal. If it\u2019s a\ngood deal, you should jump at it. Better the thief you know than the thief you\ndon\u2019t know. This is a perfect opportunity for you. Who else would think of\ninvesting with me?\u201d And off he went again with his business plan.\n\nI pushed my cannelloni around while he expounded on the future of Hong Kong\nand when he finally wound down, asked, \u201cDoes it not occur to you that people\nwant to do business with honest people they can trust? Not dishonest people\nthey have to watch?\u201d\n\nHe became exasperated. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell your client you have to create checks\nand balances in the company and watch each and every employee?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t you insist on systems being created in every company so that no one\ncan get away with cooking the books or taking from the company no matter who\nis in charge?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes...\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what difference does it make if someone you don\u2019t trust is involved? You\ndon\u2019t trust anyone anyway. If your systems work, they work. I am not any more\nof a danger to you than any other person. I don\u2019t see the problem.\u201d\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t see a problem. Either with his plan or his actions--except that\nhe was caught. Oh, perhaps a little guilt now and then...but nothing that good\nwine could not assuage. Business was business, and his was stealing if he\ncould get away with it.\n\nThere was a certain splendor in his lack of hypocrisy, a certain attraction in\nhis blunt appraisal of his own role.\n\nBut I would not recommend business with him to anyone.\n\nSince what Eddie didn\u2019t understand is that people are not only in business for\nthe money. Oh, it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s never just the money in my experience.\nIt\u2019s a dozen other things, the joy of creating something from nothing, the\nexcitement of success, the comradeship one gets from working in a team that is\ngood and effective, etc, etc.\n\nBusiness may be competitive, but there are rules and it is not war.\n\nTo Eddie, business was not only war, but war with the only rules being do not\nget caught if you can and make all the money you can. And trust no one.\n\nI had another client about the same time, an elderly business man disliked by\nalmost all that knew him, a truly unpleasant individual who never praised\nanyone, made more money than anyone I knew and could be cast as Scrooge except\nfor his enjoyment of fishing which was all that he truly cared about other\nthan money. But honest...he often would give more to the other side in the\nbargain than they asked because it was better business tactics to have a\nvendor who was making good money with you than not. During a break in a\nnegotiation I told him about Eddie, laughing.\n\nHe didn\u2019t think it was funny.\n\n\u201cEddie\u2019s just more honest than a lot of the business men I know. Get the money\nany way you can, any time you can, short-term thinking, everyone is a crook\nanyway, so what\u2019s the big deal? I know a lot of people like that. They think\nthey\u2019re smart. They\u2019re not. They grab a nickel here and lose a dollar in the\nlong run. Like him...but he\u2019s just crude and a little stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrude?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe smarter ones do it legally.\u201d He grinned and the negotiation began again.\n\nEddie died about three years later. I read in the papers that his funeral was\nwell-attended, even by some of his newly created victims. Perhaps they were\ngloating. Or perhaps they liked him.\n\nBecause, all in all, he was a pretty nice guy. Being a nice guy is how he made\nhis living, after all. Who would entrust their money to a grouch?\n\nArticle Categories\n\nLessons from the Combat Zone - Lawyer's Stories with a Moral\n\nWar Stories\n\n## Share this article!\n\nEmailGmailYahoo MailCopy LinkShare\n\n### Related Articles\n\n##### After The Embezzlement - Rebuilding The Business\n\n##### Conversion - The Basic Tort\n\n##### Embezzlement in Your Business\n\n##### Fraud and Deceit: What Are They and How Do You Prove It\n\n##### Story #8 - Buying Justice\n\n##### The American System of Criminal Justice\n\n##### Why Embezzlers Try to Destroy the Victim Business\n\n#### Find Articles in our Online Library\n\nFind helpful legal articles & summaries on key areas of the law!\n\n## Start resolving your legal matters - contact us today!\n\nFounded in 1939, our law firm combines the ability to represent clients in\ndomestic or international matters with the personal interaction with clients\nthat is traditional to a long established law firm.\n\nRead more about our firm\n\n\u00a9 2024, Stimmel, Stimmel & Roeser, All rights reserved | Terms of Use | Site by Bay Design\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": true}
