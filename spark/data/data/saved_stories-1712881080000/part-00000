Digital\nImaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the standard format for the\ncommunication and management of medical imaging information and related data.\nHowever, with the increasing threats to data security, ensuring the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical images transmitted\nover networks has never been more important. This guide provides a\ncomprehensive overview of how to securely transmit DICOM files over Transport\nLayer Security (TLS) using Mirth Connect, ensuring that sensitive patient data\nis protected against unauthorized access and cyber threats.\n\n## Setting Up Mirth Connect for DICOM over TLS\n\n### Getting Started\n\n  1. Download KeyStore Explorer https://keystore-explorer.org/. The commands in this guide are tailored to KeyStore explorer but can easily be swapped out for similar java tooling.\n  2. Download Mirth Channel\n\n### Video Tutorial\n\n### Generate and Import Certificates\n\nTo establish a TLS connection, you need a digital certificate from a trusted\nCertificate Authority (CA). This certificate can be self-signed but in some\ncircumstances a certificate from a recognized CA is recommended.\n\n  1. Generate Server Keys\n    \n        keytool -genkey -alias MirthServer_PK -keyalg RSA -keystore MirthServer_PK.pfx -storetype PKCS12 -storepass 123456 keytool -genkey -alias MirthServer_TS -keyalg RSA -keystore MirthServer_TS.pfx -storetype PKCS12 -storepass 123456\n\n  2. Generate Client Keys\n    \n        keytool -genkey -alias client_PK -keyalg RSA -keystore client_PK.pfx -storetype PKCS12 -storepass 123456 keytool -genkey -alias client_TS -keyalg RSA -keystore client_TS.pfx -storetype PKCS12 -storepass 123456\n\n  3. Export Certificate and import into Trust Store\n    \n        keytool -keystore client_PK.pfx -storetype pkcs12 -exportcert -file Client_Cert.crt -rfc -alias Client_Cert_Alias keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore mirthtlsKey_ts_trust.pfx -alias cl_pubdcm4chee -file Client_Cert.crt\n\n### Configure a Mirth Connect DICOM channel to use TLS\n\n  1. In our channel settings, select AES and set client auth to no\n  2. Add the path to the Keystore example: /opt/connect/appdata/keysandcerts/mirthtlsKey.pfx\n  3. Add the path to the Trust Store example: /opt/connect/appdata/keysandcerts/mirthtlsKey_ts_trust.pfx\n\n### Test the new DICOM over TLS Connection\n\nTest the transmission of DICOM files between the sender and receiver channels\nto ensure that the setup is working correctly. Use Mirth Connect\u2019s message\nlogging and error tracking features to troubleshoot any issues.\n\n## Best Practices and Considerations\n\n  * Keep your TLS certificates up to date to avoid disruptions in service.\n  * Regularly monitor and audit your DICOM transmissions to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations such as HIPAA.\n  * While TLS encrypts the data in transit, ensure your network is also secured through firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security measures.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSecuring DICOM transmissions is essential in today\u2019s digital healthcare\nenvironment. By leveraging Mirth Connect and TLS, healthcare organizations can\nprotect sensitive patient data during transmission. This guide serves as a\nstarting point for IT professionals in healthcare to implement secure,\ncompliant, and efficient DICOM data exchange workflows. As healthcare\ntechnology evolves, staying informed and adapting to new security standards\nwill continue to be paramount in protecting patient information and\nmaintaining trust in healthcare systems.\n\nHave questions or need help working with DICOM or Mirth Connect?
