Today the announcement\nwent out that we\u2019re combining the best technology from Beeper and Texts to\ncreate a great private, secure, and open source messaging client for people to\nhave control of their communications. We\u2019re going to use the Beeper brand,\nbecause it\u2019s fun. This is not unlike how browsers have evolved, where solid\ntech and encryption on top of an open ecosystem has created untold value for\nhumanity. Eric Migicovsky has written well about the plan going forward.\n\nA lot of people are asking about iMessage on Android... I have zero interest\nin fighting with Apple, I think instead it\u2019s best to focus on messaging\nnetworks that want more engagement from power-user clients. This is an area\nI\u2019m excited to work on when I return from my sabbatical next month.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n#### Podcast with Texts founder Kishan and Techcrunch\n\nKishan Bagaria and I had chance to catch up with Alex Willhelm on the\nTechcrunch Equity podcast, it's a bit of a time travel since we recorded this\non November 28th and there has been a ton of activity in the messaging space\nincluding the whole Beeper Mini launch and...\n\n#### Texts Joins Automattic\n\nTexts is a fun application (desktop only for now) that brings all of your\nmessages into one inbox.

Sassen says:\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 5:21 pm\n\nMatt, what an intriguing deal. I still remember Trillian and Pidgin well. With\nBepper and Texts, Automattic has become a messaging powerhouse. I have high\nhopes that the team will succeed in migrating the two platforms into a central\nmessaging app while prioritizing data privacy. Matt, you\u2019ve proven that you\nand your team are capable of achieving this.\n\nReply\n\n  2. Mohnish Thallavajhula says:\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 6:14 pm\n\nCongratulations! This is great.
