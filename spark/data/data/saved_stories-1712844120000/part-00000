The three excavated areas,\ncovering a total area of 60,000 m2, yielded a series of occupations ranging\nfrom the Neolithic to the Early Iron Age.\n\nThe earliest occupation is characterized by a monument consisting of three\ninterconnected enclosures, with a circular enclosure of 11 meters in diameter\nat its center.\n\nTo the north, a horseshoe-shaped enclosure measuring 8 meters in length\nabutted the circular enclosure, and to the south, another open enclosure\nbordered the central one. The presence of a gravel layer in the fill of the\ntwo lateral enclosures indicates the existence of a palisade. Various\nstratigraphic sections indicate that the three enclosures are contemporaneous.\n\nThis type of monument appears to be unprecedented, and no comparisons have\nbeen made yet. Dating is still uncertain, but the only artifacts found in the\ntrenches are carved flint stones, suggesting a chrono-cultural attribution to\nthe Neolithic. Radiocarbon analysis is currently underway to determine the\nprecise chronology of this monument.\n\nGeneral view of the Marliens site, with the triple monument at the bottom of\nthe image.

These include seven flint\narrowheads, two archer\u2019s bracelets, a flint lighter, and a copper alloy\ndagger.\n\nResidues of \u201ciron oxide\u201d corresponding to pyrite, an essential element for\nigniting fire, were observed on one of the bracelets. This series of objects\noften accompanies a burial, but due to their stratigraphic position at the\nbase of the site, this hypothesis could not be confirmed.\n\nAnalysis of the copper alloy composition of the dagger should help establish\nits origin and provide information about trade during the period.\n\nObjects found that make up the \u201cpanoply\u201d of a campaniform archer, including\nthe bracelet. Credit: Pauline Rostollan / INRAP\n\nThe occupation during the Early Bronze Age is characterized by the presence of\nseveral pits, which are the only evidence remaining of settlements from this\nperiod. Palynological and carpological analyses of the clay layers at the\nbottom of these structures provide abundant information about the natural\nenvironment and landscape of the valley in the first half of the second\nmillennium BCE.\n\nBetween 1500 BCE and 1300 BCE, a necropolis was constructed on the plain,\ncovering an area of 6,000 m2, with five circular enclosures, four open and one\nclosed. The acidity of the soil prevented the preservation of unburned bones,\nso no complete burials were discovered.\n\nHowever, traces of burials and a funeral pyre were identified in the ditches\nof the largest open enclosure, 24 meters in diameter.\n\nThe dating of this enclosure was based on five copper alloy pins and a\nnecklace with about forty amber beads found in the trench. The scarce pottery\nfragments found in the other enclosures confirm the dating of this necropolis\nand the contemporaneity of the various enclosures.\n\nReconstruction of the archer with his equipment.

It is characterized by the\ndiscovery of six incinerated remains dated to the Early Iron Age. The urns,\ncovered by a lid, contained a single bone deposit, sometimes accompanied by\nornaments (bracelets and/or rings of copper and iron alloy).\n\nThese small necropolises, occupying an area of less than 100 m2, are difficult\nto identify during surveys, and this is the first time one of these sites has\nbeen excavated in eastern Burgundy. Studies of the incinerated bones are being\nconducted to determine the funeral practices and gestures associated with\nthese deposits.\n\nThe results of this operation reveal the presence of numerous small and\nrelatively dense diachronic occupations in this part of the Ouche plain.\n\nThe excavation concluded in February, and various studies are now underway.\nCombined with paleoenvironmental studies, they will provide a wealth of\ninformation about spatial occupation, allowing us to propose a scenario for\nthe evolution of this area over time.\n\n#### Sources\n\nInstitut national de recherches arch\u00e9ologiques preventives (INRAP)\n\n  * Share this article:\n\n285 Neolithic Structures from over 4,000 Years Ago at the Pontcharaud\nArchaeological Site in France\n\nMathematical Analysis of Mysterious Folkton Drums Suggests they May Be\nMeasuring Units for the Construction of Stonehenge\n\nBurial Mounds with a Ritual Path and a Neolithic Chariot Tomb Found in\nMagdeburg\n\nAdvanced Material Culture from 45,000 Years Ago that Brings the Arrival of\nHomo Sapiens to China up to Five Millennia Earlier Discovered\n\nGiant 200,000-year-old prehistoric stone axe discovered in northwestern Arabia\n\nOne of Scandinavia's Oldest Dolmens is Intact from Neolithic Times, but Skulls\nand Other Parts of Buried People Are Missing\n\nAntiquity\n\n## The Story of the Discovery and Loss of the Golden Horns of Gallehus,\nCreated in the Germanic Iron Age\n\nThe story of the impressive and extraordinary Golden Horns of Gallehus, from\ntheir creation, discovery,...\n\nPrehistory\n\n## Europe\u2019s Oldest Wooden Staircase was found Inside a Bronze Age Mine, Only 2\nPercent of whose Tunnels have been Explored\n\nOne of the most important archaeological sites in the world is the Austrian\nvillage of...\n\nAncient Egypt\n\n## Egyptian Sky Goddess Nut Found to Be a Personification of the Milky Way\n\nThe ancient Egyptians were renowned for their religious beliefs and\nastronomical knowledge of the Sun,...\n\nAncient Rome\n\n## Scrinium Barbarorum, the Department of the Eastern Roman Empire in Charge\nof Barbarian Affairs\n\nSome time ago we dedicated an article to the frumentarii and agentes in rebus,\nwho...\n\nAncient Rome\n\n## The Temple of Isis at Pompeii, One of the First Buildings to be Unearthed\nfrom the Ashes\n\nThe Temple of the Egyptian goddess Isis in Pompeii was discovered in 1764\nduring the...\n\nAncient Greece\n\n## Lelantine War, the First Conflict Involving Greek Cities that no One won\nand whose Existence is Disputed\n\nIn ancient Greece, between 710 and 650 BC, a significant military conflict\nknown as the...\n\nScience\n\n## Huge Fossilized Bones Found Throughout Europe are from a Gigantic\nIchthyosaur Hitherto Unknown\n\nIn 1850, a British scientist named Samuel Stutchbury made an unusual\ndiscovery.
