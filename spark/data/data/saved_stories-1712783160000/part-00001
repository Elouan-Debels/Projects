Keep raising more money from\ninvestors, and hope to die before you get caught. This isn't a great\noption\u2014for a Ponzi scheme to sustain itself, it has to keep getting bigger,\nand raising more and more money is hard. Plus, the bigger it gets, the more\nlikely it is that people might start asking questions and find out that it's a\nPonzi scheme. And if it gets so big that the Securities and Exchange\nCommission finds out that it's a Ponzi scheme, they will arrest you and you\nwill go to jail for 150 years. Not good.\n\nSecond, you could stop doing the Ponzi scheme. This will probably upset your\nclients, because you will have to tell them that you don\u2019t have any of their\nmoney, because you were running a Ponzi scheme. It will also probably upset\nthe SEC, who will still arrest you and throw you in jail. But the judge might\ngive you a lighter sentence if you stop doing the Ponzi scheme on your own,\nwhen it\u2019s still a healthy Ponzi scheme and not a collapsing Ponzi scheme. I\ndon't know. Seems risky. It might be better to hope that you don\u2019t get caught.\n\nFinally, you could try to turn the Ponzi scheme into a real business? If your\nPonzi scheme hasn\u2019t imploded yet, you still have money in the bank. Do\nsomething real with it! Launch a startup. Trade crypto. Buy stocks that\nactually return a steady 11 percent a year. Open a coffee shop and sell it to\na yogurt company for $900 million. This is hard to do, and it\u2019s almost\ncertainly better to do it without doing the Ponzi scheme first, but if you\nalready stole the money, you might as well try to make the most of it. Best of\nall, if you pull it off, nobody will ever know that your business started as a\nPonzi scheme.1\n\nThough the SEC won\u2019t like this plan\u2014you still ran a Ponzi scheme, and they\nwill still want to arrest you for that\u2014your investors might be ok with it. A\nthing about Ponzi schemes is that they\u2019re great investments2 so long as you\nget out before they blow up. Financially speaking\u2014not ethically or morally,\nand definitely not legally\u2014your early investors are doing great! They have\nbeen making a steady, above-market, risk-free return! They probably want to\nkeep that. If you get arrested for running a Ponzi scheme, not only will you\ngo to jail for 150 years, they will have to give back all of their returns.\nBad for everyone.\n\nSo it seems like there's a trade here. You offer your existing investors a\ndeal: If they don't tell the SEC that you've been running a Ponzi scheme,\nyou\u2019ll pivot your Ponzi scheme into a legitimate business. If it doesn\u2019t\nwork\u2014if your coffee shop doesn\u2019t make it\u2014everyone loses, just as they would\u2019ve\nanyway: Your investors lose their money, and you go to jail.3 But if it works,\neveryone wins: Your investors keep their previous returns, they get new\nreturns from your successful company, and you don\u2019t go to jail. It\u2019s a\ngraceful escape, if you pivot to the right thing.\n\n#\n\nData is a four-letter word\n\nWell, not quite. Data is not a Ponzi scheme. Financial reporting and business\nintelligence are the only senses that many businesses have, and even the\nbiggest cynics can\u2019t contort themselves into saying that this stuff isn\u2019t\nimportant. And operational telemetry, and the automated algorithms built on\ntop of it, generates trillions in revenues in Amazon\u2019s warehouses, on Google\u2019s\nad networks, and across factory floors and insurance companies and trading\ndesks around the world. These are all real and enormously valuable\napplications of data.\n\nBut within the field of analytics\u2014the practice of trying to make better\nstrategic decisions with data and manual analysis\u2014the track record is less\ncompelling. Here, the animating narrative has long been the same: Data is full\nof useful insights. Companies that don\u2019t find them are doomed to fall behind\nand die. Analysts are the experts who can extract those insights. Sure, we\ncan\u2019t live up to our full potential today\u2014our data is too messy; our data is\ntoo unreliable; engineers are too busy to help keep it clean; our tools are\nbroken; our workflows are broken; we are buried behind less important work; we\ndistract ourselves; we don\u2019t know how to organize ourselves; executives don\u2019t\nsupport us; they treat us like second-class citizens; people don\u2019t know how to\nwork with us; people don\u2019t invite us into the important rooms; people are\nilliterate.4 But on the other side of these problems, just over the horizon,\nthere is an oasis of scholarship and shareholder value.\n\nKeep plugging, and we\u2019ll finally clean up this mess.5 Keep plugging, and our\npotential energy will become realized energy. Keep plugging, and we\u2019ll fulfill\nthe long-told prophecy that data will become every company\u2019s single most\nimportant asset. As data teams, this is our gospel: One day, when the glory\ncomes, it will be ours; one day, when this war is won.6\n\nAs a philosophical point, I suppose this might be true. Though I have my\ndoubts, it\u2019s impossible to know what could be, given more time to build better\ntools, cultivate better cultures, educate more coworkers, and enlighten more\nexecutives. As a practical point, however, I\u2019m not sure how much these\nhypotheticals matter. The question is not whether such a world exists, but if\nwe will ever get there?\n\nMore pointedly, it's this: Would you, as a reader of this blog and presumably\nsomeone who is at least vaguely optimistic about this whole analytics\nendeavor, bet your entire bank account7 that we will\u2014collectively, in general,\non average\u2014reach that promised land, in which data is democratized and\ninsights are liberated and businesses are empowered and various other nouns\nare actioned? Or would you take the other side, and bet that most analytics\nteams slog along, heaving slowly forwards through the same briar patches that\nwe\u2019ve been stuck in for years? A decade from now, will most analytics\nteams\u2014not your team, of course I have faith in you\u2014be seamlessly driving\ncritical corporate decisions? Will they be plucking new business opportunities\nout of haystacks of data? Will they be invited to weigh in every key debate,\nand have a seat around every key table? Will they be a competitive advantage?\n\nOr will they continue to toil on the fringes, responding to queues of feckless\nquestions, adding bits of value here and improving some marginal thing there,\nwhile continuing to say, to others and to themselves, that better days are\nahead?\n\nIf my life savings were on the line, my answer is that our hope is a mistake,\nand most analysts will never escape their current lot. As we\u2019ve talked about\nmany times before, analytics might be an inherently flawed enterprise. Data is\nfundamentally messy and fundamentally biased. Turning this data into useful\ninformation requires rare analytical skills; turning information into better\nbusiness results requires courage and a knack for persuasion. Unless we can\nteach these skills at scale, which we probably cannot, there will be little\ndemand for the everyday analytics team\u2019s work, and little advantage for the\neveryday company to invest in analytics.\n\nIn short, my answer is that analytics\u2014not as an industry or as a technology\necosystem, but as a discipline\u2014might not work. The average company may never\nbe able to make better decisions by hiring a team of average analysts. We can\nmake dashboards and be operational accountants. But the fun, exploratory,\n\u201cvaluable\u201d work may always be an indulgent, empty dessert, and never the\nentr\u00e9e we want it to be.\n\nWhich is an awkward answer, because in some rough way, my life savings is on\nthe line. For many of us who work in data, we were hired to build this data-\ndriven, insight-rich, collectively shared future. If we don\u2019t, the whole\napparatus\u2014our jobs, our conferences, our startups, our academies, our\nstatuses, all of it\u2014will fall apart.\n\nThough no, that\u2019s not exactly right. People in the analytics profession\nhaven\u2019t bet their life savings on building that future; we\u2019ve bet our life\nsavings on other people believing in that future. As long as people have faith\nin its potential, the machine can stay upright. Our executive overlords, many\nof whom probably feel that they aren't getting their money\u2019s worth out of what\nwe are, can mentally reclassify our salaries as down payments for what we will\nbe. Vendors can keep promising future insights. We can keep trotting out\nexplanations\u2014data quality, data literacy, executive support, the distractions\nfrom AI, whatever\u2014for why we aren\u2019t yet a true analytics team. Our Ponzi\nscheme can stay solvent, until I\u2019ll be gone and you\u2019ll be gone, and another\ngeneration can worry about what comes next.\n\n#\n\nThe walls close in\n\nHonestly, it might work. People unquestionably accept that data is valuable;\nit wouldn't take much to keep that faith alive.\n\nBut what if we assume we can't perpetuate it anymore? Suppose money gets\ntight, and the SEC (Stingy, Efficient CEO) runs out of patience. They demand\nto know how we plan on making our work worth what we\u2019re paid. They\u2019re onto our\nscheme, and our usual explanation\u2014that it\u2019ll all get better, once we complete\na few eternal prerequisites\u2014will no longer fly. This sounds like a Ponzi\nscheme, the SECEO will say, and in years of efficiency, Ponzi schemes get\nfired.\n\nOne obvious answer is to stop doing the Ponzi scheme. Dissolve the analytics\nteam. Trade in our big promises for something smaller. Instead of getting\nfired, take a reduced sentence: Twenty years to life of building reports and\nmaintaining operational infrastructure. Become more like IT or HR\u2014invaluable\ncomponents in the corporate machinery, but with fewer delusions of grandeur.\nAccept our lot in life as bean counters, concede that our \u201cinsights\u201d aren\u2019t\nbusiness-critical, no matter how much we beg people to use them, and count the\nbeans.\n\nI mean, maybe, but man, that is unsatisfying. People make decisions all the\ntime, those decisions are rooted in facts, and facts are rooted in data. This\nbasic logic seems so sound. Surely there\u2019s a way to make this work? Surely\nthere\u2019s something more legitimate, and more reliably useful, that we could\ngracefully pivot into?\n\n#\n\nThe adversarial analytics team\n\nGo to any data conference, and there will almost certainly be a few talks\nabout how data teams can be better partners with their business counterparts.\nIt would be funny if someone gave a talk on how we could be more adversarial\ninstead. Rather than showing people a dashboard of KPIs, use some black box\nalgorithm to blend them all into a single composite. Rather than giving\nsomeone a day-by-day time series or a scatter plot with individual data\npoints, make every chart a trend line. Rather than telling anyone the exact\nvalue of a metric, always round it to the nearest Fibonacci number: \u201cTwo\nmonths, we had 610 orders. Last month, about 610 again. This month, we\u2019re up\nto about 987. We can\u2019t share any more detail than that.\u201d\n\nThis is obviously kind of dumb, probably kind of fraud,8 and...might kind of\nwork? Because whenever we share metrics with people, this is mostly what they\ndo anyway: Squint, decide if the line is going up a lot, up a little, flat,\ndown a little, or down a lot. Though small statistical details matter for\noperational optimization problems, the analytical decisions that executives\nmake are mostly based on these sorts of directional vibes. The line is\nwiggling; is it noise or is something changing? Customer retention is\ndeclining; let\u2019s hire more account managers. Everyone is talking about AI;\nlet\u2019s send dump trucks of cash to the houses of famous AI experts. We struggle\nto sell to women; let\u2019s make a horror movie about it.\n\nThis is part of why customer interviews are often more valuable than analyzing\na bunch of data, even though the latter is the stuff of scientific inquiry,\nand the former is gossip. In so many cases, gossip is what people want.9 CEOs\nwant to know what their customers are thinking. Behavioral data isn\u2019t \u201ctruth;\u201d\nit\u2019s an observable proxy, the input to a kind of analytical alchemy that\nattempts to turn individual outcomes into generalizations about intentions. In\nsome sense, the careful rigor of data analysis is a red herring\u2014it\u2019s what we\nwere trained to sell, but not the main thing our customers want to buy.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s actually what\u2019s held us back for so long: numbers, more or\nless. Though most business decisions are driven by numbers, those numbers\nmatter because they define people\u2019s loose mental models for how the world\nworks, not because people need to know about the often-meaningless tedium of\nthings like statistical significance. By talking primarily in the language of\nexact facts and figures, we make ourselves dismissible, because nobody really\ncares about the precise amount some metric went up or down. At the end of the\nday, executives care if the world still works the way they think it does.\nEverything else is just bluster and bikeshedding.\n\nDisband or rebrand\u2014that may be our choice. Analytics teams don\u2019t have to be\nbound to data teams, and that association might be our problem. We might be\nbetter off finding other departments to operate in, and advertising ourselves\nas majors in that field with a minor in analytics, rather than the other way\naround. It might not be the fun thing we imagined, but it\u2019s the useful thing\nwe would get paid and promoted for. Because after flirting with a life of\ncrime, we might need to start keeping our backstory a secret, and learn to\nblend in with everyone else.\n\n1\n\nI mean, they might be suspicious. If, say, CryptoFX stopped offering \u201c\u2018risk\nfree\u2019 and \u2018guaranteed\u2019 crypto and foreign exchange investments,\u201d and started\nselling cold brew, the SEC will probably have some questions. But still. When\nthey show up, it would help if you had a real business and not just a Ponzi\nscheme.\n\n2\n\nissuing correction on a previous statement of mine, regarding Ponzi schemes.\nyou do not, under any circumstances, \"gotta hand it to them\"\n\n3\n\nSure, it\u2019s more complicated than this. If your Ponzi scheme gets raided by the\nSEC, your investors will lose their illegitimate returns, but they might\nrecover some of their principal. If you spend their money on a startup, they\nmight lose all of it on your business\u2019 expenses, like employees\u2019 salaries and\ncoffee beans and 350,000 H100 Nvidia graphics cards. Plus, if they make a deal\nwith you and you get caught, I assume they might also go to jail for \u201callowing\nthe fraud to continue unabated.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t change the overall point:\nYour investors would prefer that your Ponzi scheme becomes a legitimate\nbusiness, and would not prefer that Ponzi scheme blow ups.\n\n4\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t read Liz Lemon!\u201d\n\n5\n\nAll of our messy data sources will neatly write into a centralized warehouse.\nEach pipeline will be actively governed by a tightly written data contract.\nData marts will be documented with encyclopedic completeness and precision.\nPeople will know where to go to ask questions. Answers will be delivered in-\nline and on-demand. People will be skilled in its language and its limits.\nErrors will promptly trigger alerts. And so on and so forth.\n\n6\n\nYes, fair, on one hand, this is a melodramatic and appropriative link. On the\nother hand, it\u2019s a banger of a performance and everyone should watch it. I\u2019m\naware that our \u201cstruggles\u201d as analytics teams are, relatively speaking, quite\nsilly.\n\n7\n\nIf you are a generational baseball talent who throws 100 miles an hour, hits\nabsolute tanks, and steals 20 bases a season, do not bet on this! Do not bet\non anything! Please! You are our Shohei! Our only Shohei! You'll never know\nhow much we love you, please don't take our Shohei away!\n\n8\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Gensler, but the most we can say about our revenue is it either\nrounds to 102,334,155 dollars or 165,580,141 dollars. We don\u2019t keep track of\nwhat happens to the 63,245,986 dollars in between. No, you cannot look at my\npersonal bank statement.\u201d\n\n9\n\nGossip is the beginning of moral inquiry, as they say.\n\n### Subscribe to benn.substack\n\nBy Benn Stancil\n\nA weekly Substack on data and technology, with some occasional conversations\nabout culture, sports, and politics.\n\n64 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n7 Restacks\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Disband the analytics team\n\nbenn.substack.com\n\n58\n\nShare\n\n58 Comments\n\nPeter McNallyMar 23Liked by Benn StancilThe bigger Ponzi scheme seems to be\nthe data platforms that are making millions ( billions?) by enabling all these\nanalytics teams, no?Expand full commentLike (4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n5 replies by Benn Stancil and others\n\nDoug BryanMar 22Liked by Benn StancilWonderful insights presented in a\nwonderful way, as always.
