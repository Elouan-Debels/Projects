We\nuse an instrumented extruder to fit a function that maps nozzle pressures\nacross varying flow rates and temperatures for a given machine and material\nconfiguration. We then develop a method to extract real parameters for flow\nrate and temperature using relative pressures and temperature offsets. Our\nmethod allows us to successfully find process parameters, using one set of\ninput parameters, across all of the machine and material configurations that\nwe tested, even in materials that we had never printed before. Rather than\nusing direct parameters in FFF printing, which is time-consuming to tune and\nmodify, it is possible to deploy machine-generated data that captures the\nfundamental phenomenology of FFF to automatically select parameters.\n\nUse our pre-submission checklist\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFused filament fabrication (FFF) [1] is a rapid prototyping process, where\ntracks of molten polymers are extruded line-by-line and layer-by-layer through\na heated nozzle in order to build a part. The process continues to rise in\npopularity due to its low cost and simple nature, and is especially prevalent\namong open source machine builders, where a proliferation of new machine\ndesigns and material options is continually emerging.\n\nFFF printing requires that part geometries be transformed into machine\ninstructions in a process called slicing, to do so we use software packages\naptly named \u201cslicers\u201d. In order to print successfully, slicers must be\nconfigured such that the instructions they generate work with the particular\nmachine and material being used downstream. For example, two of the most\nrelevant configuration parameters that must be selected are the nozzle\ntemperature and the material flow rate; the first is set directly and the\nsecond is set indirectly as a function of track width, height, and speed.\nThese parameters relate to the materials\u2019 properties as well as to the\nparticulars of the machine: nozzle diameter is of course one major factor\naffecting flow rate, as is the overall thermodynamics of the nozzle (i.e.,\nmelt zone length and shape) and the extruder\u2019s ability to produce pressure.\n\nInstead of inferring optimal parameters from state-of-the-art models, most\nslicers deploy process parameter sets that are hand-tuned via extensive trial\nand error. Not only this is time-consuming, it is also non-transferable across\nmachines or materials: one parameter set is unique to one complete FFF\nconfiguration, meaning a machine (hotend design and nozzle diameter) and a\nmaterial. This leads to wasted time, material, and sub-optimal prints, and\nespecially presents a challenge to those among us who build or modify their\nmachines to perform beyond where most heuristic sets have been refined, or who\nuse novel materials that are recycled [2, 3], derived from biological origins\n[4], or have advanced properties including cell-free and cell-laden bioinks\n[5] and conductivity for additive electronics production [6].\n\nThe development of machines that can forgo this hand-tuning process may speed\nthe development of new FFF printers and the adoption of new, renewable and\nrecycled FFF materials. We try to do so in this paper. However, rather than\nbacking into a complex modeling exercise, we develop a workflow that deploys a\nsimple function fit with an online data gathering routine to automatically\nselect process parameters using an instrumented extruder that extends work\nfrom Coogan and Kazmer [7]. The workflow replaces roughly half of the hand-\ntuned parameters in state-of-the-art slicers with one dataset (generated with\nthe matching machine and material within tens of minutes and tens of grams of\nfilament) and one additional input parameter that specifies temperature and\nflow rate in relative terms.\n\nWe found that our method can consistently pick viable print parameters for\nknown and unknown materials when we used it to print a series of benchmark\nmodels using machine configurations that we had not tested previously. We were\nalso able to do this using the same input parameter across all configurations.\nWe hope that this method will be especially relevant to the emergence of\nadvanced and sustainable material blends, whose adoption is hampered by users\u2019\nnot having reliable access to viable print parameters.\n\nIn this paper we provide some background on the FFF process in \u201cThe FFF\nProcess, Extruder, and Limitations,\u201d and also an overview of how FFF process\nparameters are articulated in state-of-the-art slicers in \u201cTypical FFF\nParameter Sets.\u201d In our methods section \u201cMethods\u201d we provide detail on our\ninstrumented extruder (\u201cInstrumented FFF Extruder\u201d) and data gathering routine\n(\u201cData Gathering and Normalization\u201d), as well as the shape of our function fit\n(\u201cFunction Fitting\u201d) that maps pressure as a function of flow rate and nozzle\ntemperature set point \\\\(P = f(Q, T)\\\\). In \u201cExtracting Real Parameters from\nFunction Fits using Input Parameters,\u201d we explore the connection between our\nfunction fits for poly lactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene\n(ABS) and heuristically developed parameter sets for the same, and show how we\nselected a single input parameter for any configuration. We summarize how the\nsystem is deployed in \u201cSystem Summary.\u201d Finally in our \u201cResults\u201d section we\ndeploy our workflow on a litany of materials and on two machine\nconfigurations. Finally, we discuss limitations and future work in\n\u201cLimitations and Future Work\u201d and conclude the paper in \u201cConclusion.\u201d\n\n### Related Work\n\nAlthough some slicers can directly transmit low-level instructions to machines\n[8], and other tools omit the slicer entirely such as FullControl GCode\nDesigner^Footnote 1 in which users create print paths with Microsoft Excel [9]\nand p5.fab for direct control over FFF printing parameters through creative\ncoding [10], only one that we found can read data or configurations directly\nfrom an FFF machine; all others are configured in a feed-forward manner. The\nORNL Slicer 2.0 developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory is based on an on-\ndemand process that gathers sensor information at each layer and provides\nfeedback to the slicer, before generating partial G-code for the next layer.\nSensors are used in the form of thermal cameras and laser profilometers [11].\nOther instrumented printers that measure quality variables with sensors\ninclude: [12] and [13]. Kumar et al developed a low-cost multi-sensor strategy\nfor error detection during FFF printing, and used sensors for measuring\nvibration, current, and sound [14].\n\nPerhaps the closest aligned work to our own are two vision-based methods [15]\nand [16]. While these two methods are more effective parameter fine-tuners,\nthey require an initial set of printing conditions that produce viable output,\nwhereas ours does not. They also both require more input data than does our\nmethod. That said, their end results are of a higher overall quality than\nours, meaning that a combination of our method (to set initial conditions) and\nvision-based fine tuning is a viable path toward optimal printing.\n\nThe physics of FFF printing are well understood in the literature [17, 18] and\nit is likely possible to develop full-scale models of the FFF process that\ncould relate material models directly to machine models in order to pick\noptimal slicer configurations. However, to our knowledge no-one has made\nsubstantial effort to apply these models to automatically select parameters\nfor FFF machines, although much work has been done to evaluate the effects of\nparameter selection on the quality of printed outputs [19,20,21,22,23,24]. The\nfocus in this work is on how to rapidly select operating parameters from a\nshort, online rheological experiment.\n\n### The FFF Process, Extruder, and Limitations\n\nFFF is simple in principle but becomes complex when examined in closer detail.\nWe provide a diagrammatic representation of the basics in Fig. 1. In a coarse\nview, FFF machines push a thermoplastic filament into a heated cylinder using\nhobbed drive gears. As the filament travels through this hotend it melts, and\nis extruded out of a small diameter nozzle (e.g., 0.4mm). The molten extrudate\nis deposited in tracks, which are composed into layers and subsequently\ncomplete parts, by moving the nozzle very precisely as this extrusion is going\non.\n\nFig. 1\n\nThis figure shows a diagrammatic example of a typical FFF extruder, where a\ncylindrical filament is pushed, using hobbed drive gears, through a heated\nnozzle to precisely lay tracks on a moving bed\n\nFull size image\n\nInside the nozzle and melt zone, classical rheological models can be easily\napplied [25]. Indeed, [7] uses an instrumented extruder similar to the one in\nthis work to fit data to these rheological models, showing that much of the\nFFF process can be modeled as such. These models can tell us how much pressure\nneeds to be generated inside of a nozzle of a given shape, with a given\npolymer, in order to achieve a given flow rate.\n\nHowever, real-time operation of an FFF machine is often much more dynamic than\nthis, especially because flow rates are constantly changing; it is important\nto remember that even though feed rates are set at constant velocities,\nmachine controllers are continuously changing actual velocities as they limit\nacceleration into and out of corners [26]. This means that models appropriate\nfor steady-state rheology may not map well into real FFF operation.\n\nAt maximum flow rates, system limits are almost entirely thermodynamic [27].\nAcknowledgment of this insight is evident in the FFF community\u2019s recent\ndeployment of nozzles like the Bondtech CHT [28] and the E3D Revo High-Flow\n[29] that both increase nozzle to filament surface area (to improve\nconduction) in order to increase flow.\n\nThe nozzle is only one component of the complete dynamics of the FFF process.\nAlso important to consider is the mechanical limit to nozzle pressure\ngeneration [30]. FFF extruders typically use hobbed shafts that are preloaded\ninto the filament in order to drive material into the nozzle. Filaments\neventually shear under the stresses exerted on them by these hobbed shafts,\nmeaning that only a limited amount of pressure can be supplied to the nozzle.\nThis limit is acknowledged in the design of the Prusa Nextruder, which\nincreases the extruder\u2019s ability to generate pressure by increasing the number\nof sites at which the extruder\u2019s hobbed gear is engaged with the filament.\n\nFurther, complexity in FFF can be found outside of the extrusion process\nitself. As we will see in this work, flow can always be increased by\nincreasing nozzle temperature, but over-heating filament in the nozzle can\nlead to slumping of the printed part. This is simple to understand: once\nprinted, the filament is unconstrained and if it is too molten it will not\nhold its deposited shape. To compound this, the filament is typically resting\non a previous layer of filament, and so prints need to be strong enough, as\nthey are being printed, to remain self-supporting. This phenomenology has led\nto the inclusion of \u2018part cooling fans\u2019 in most extruder designs that allow\nnozzle temperatures to remain large while quickly cooling filament on exit to\navoid slumping.\n\nSlumping would be perhaps the most complex aspect of FFF to capture\naccurately; a prospective modeler would need not only to understand the nozzle\nand extruder, but also the part geometry itself, the machine\u2019s complete set of\nmotion dynamics (to estimate real layer times), and information about the\npart\u2019s cooling rate, the materials\u2019 own thermodynamic properties, and perhaps\neven expectations about the ambient temperature and airflow around and within\nprinter.\n\n### Typical FFF Parameter Sets\n\nRather than try to model all of these process intricacies (and additionally\ntry to articulate what \u201coptimal\u201d configurations might be), state-of-the-art\nslicers simply use a large number of user-specified feed-forward settings (a\nconfiguration) in order to develop their outputs. These configurations are\nhand-tuned via trial and error and are specific to a complete machine,\nmaterial set; whenever a nozzle diameter, extruder design, or material is\nchanged, a new configuration must be developed or adapted.\n\nTable 1 To understand how FFF machine instructions are generated in practice,\nwe include here, a table of settings from PrusaSlicer that affect flow rates\nand temperatures directly\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 2 Volumetric flow rates are not directly exposed in slicer\nconfigurations\n\nFull size table\n\nMany settings are geometric in nature (layer height, infill density, infill\npatterns, and shell thicknesses), and we consider these settings to be outside\nthe scope of this paper. Here, we are primarily concerned with what we see as\nthe two most important (and difficult to determine) parameters, which are\nprint speeds (in terms of flow rates) and temperatures. In our survey of two\npopular slicers, some data from which is available in Table 1, nearly half of\nthe total settings available in any given configuration were related to flow\nrate and temperatures (we present only these settings in the table), but the\nrelations were all indirect. For example, flow rate appears directly only\nonce, in the aptly named Max Volumetric Speed setting: elsewhere it is encoded\nindirectly by a combination of layer height, track width, and linear speeds.\nIn Table 2, we calculate actual flow rates for a few different track types\ngiven typical values. Some of these flow rates exceed maximum flow rates (as\nspecified elsewhere), we present those in bold. Nozzle temperatures at least\nare uncomplicated and direct, and are assigned per material.\n\nSince a considerable number of hours have been spent by FFF community members\ntuning these values, we can assume that they contain some insight as to how\nFFF machines should be operated, even though the exact logic behind any given\nvalue is not explicitly clear. The first take-away from these parameters is\nthat speed is often reduced when detail or precision is required (i.e., on\nexternal and small perimeters, and is maximized (toward apparent maximal\nvolumetric flow rates) when it is not so important (i.e., during infill).\nHowever, flow rates and temperatures are not all that informs these values:\nlower speeds also imply higher quality of motion from a machine\u2019s linear axes\nand dynamics.\n\n## Methods\n\nGiven the development of instrumented extruders, we wanted to develop a method\nfor print parameter selection that lay somewhere between the use of complete\nand complex models of the FFF process [31] (which seems daunting and messy),\nand state-of-the-art feed-forward (and blind) solutions. We also wanted our\nprocess to be deployable as an online solution; something users might run just\nahead of any new print, or whenever they load new filament into a machine.\n\nTo do so, we developed a simple function fit that relates typical nozzle\npressure to an operating temperature and flow rate \\\\(P = f(T, Q)\\\\) that we\ncan generate using data that only takes a few minutes to collect.\n\nThen, using the function fit, we can extract real parameters using input\nparameters that describe temperatures \\\\(T_{rel}\\\\) as offsets from initial\nflow conditions, and that select flow rates based on pressures \\\\(P_{sel}\\\\)\nrelative to the extruders\u2019 maximum pressure.\n\nTogether, these methods combine into a workflow that we describe in \u201cSystem\nSummary,\u201d where novel materials can be loaded into our printer, a set of\nparameters can be automatically generated and loaded into a slicer software,\nand prints can be carried out.\n\nTo aid in other researchers\u2019 reproduction and extension of this work, we have\npublished a Git repository at https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/jakeread/online-\nmeasurement-for-parameter-discovery-in-fff that includes mechanical designs,\ncircuit designs, and source codes for the firmware, frameworks, and\nexperiments discussed in this paper.\n\n### Instrumented FFF Extruder\n\nFollowing work on in-line rheological monitoring [7], we designed and built an\nFFF extruder (shown in Fig. 2) that allows us to measure a nozzle pressure\nanalog and to detect filament slip at the drive gears. We render the extruder\nhere in Fig. 2.\n\nFig. 2\n\nWe designed and built an instrumented extruder for FFF 3D Printing. It is\nlargely the same as most Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) FFF extruders, using\nand E3D V6 hotend (D) and Bondtech drive gears (B). To this assembly we add a\nload cell (C) that sits in the middle of the structural loop between the drive\ngears and the hotend, meaning that it measures all of the force exerted by the\ndrive gears onto the filament. We use this reading as a pressure analog.\nAdditionally, we developed a filament sensor (A) that measures the real linear\nfeed rate of the filament (A:1) using an idler gear attached to an encoder\n(A:3) preloaded by an idler roller (A:4). The roller is preloaded using a\nflexural hinge (A:5) and a lever arm. A hall-effect sensor (A:2) reads the\ndisplacement of this lever arm; these readings are calibrated and used to\nmeasure real filament diameter. More detailed figures and CAD models of these\ncomponents are included in the repository referenced at the beginning of this\nsection\n\nFull size image\n\nWhile [7] used an in-line pressure transducer in their work, we avoid the\ncostly and complex nozzle modification by instead measuring pressure\nindirectly. Our extruder mounts the hotend to the machine chassis via a load\ncell, meaning that any force exerted by the filament on the nozzle is measured\nin this load cell. This has the possible disadvantage of reading external\nforces as well (such as friction between the filament and the hotend tube\u2019s\nsidewall), and forces exerted on the nozzle by (for example) existing tracks\nof filament, but we found the measurements useful regardless, as our work does\nnot yet attempt to measure nozzle pressure during printing.\n\nWe additionally developed an instrument that measures the width and linear\nfeed rate of the filament before it enters the nozzle, based on a design from\n[32]. This is also pictured in Fig. 2. It does so with two idler wheels, one\nof which is hobbed in the same manner as the extruder\u2019s drive gears, the other\nof which is passive. The hobbed idler is fitted with a rotary encoder to sense\nlinear feed rate of the filament and the other is attached to a swing-arm,\nwhose displacement is analogous to changes in filament thickness. Together,\nthese readings can tell us the real volumetric feed rate of filament into the\nextruder. In this work, we use this instrument solely to detect filament slip,\ni.e., cases where the extruder\u2019s linear feed rate reads near zero but the\ndrive motor is continuing to spin.\n\nWhile our extruder is instrumented, its performance should be fundamentally\nsimilar to many other consumer FFF printers, since it uses the E3D V6 hotend\nand Bondtech drive gears, which have emerged as pseudo-standards in low-cost\nprinter designs. These are also the main components that contribute to\nextruder phenomenology, and are the same as those used in the machine that\nmatches our reference heuristics from \u201cExtracting Real Parameters from\nFunction Fits using Input Parameters.\u201d\n\n### Data Gathering and Normalization\n\nEach component of the hotend is fitted with a custom-designed circuit and\nlocal control logic. Devices are connected over a network to one another and\nto a systems coordinator, written in JavaScript that allows us to quickly\nwrite high-level routines for data collection [33]. More details on this\nsystem are available in the repository referenced in the beginning of this\nsection. We used this system to develop a simple data gathering routine whose\nsteps are enumerated below.\n\nFig. 3\n\nHere, we show cleaned data traces from samples taken across five flow rates\n5\\\\(\\hbox {mm}^{3}/s\\\\) to 25 \\\\(\\hbox {mm}^{3}/s\\\\) for ABS through a 0.8mm\nnozzle on an E3D V6 hotend. During each trace, we set the hotend to near its\nmaximum temperature of 290\\\\({^\\circ \\hbox {C}}\\\\), begin flowing filament at\nthe requested rate, and then simply turn the heating element off in the\nextruder. The resulting time-series gathers nozzle pressure (as a raw load\ncell reading, normalized from \\\\(0 \\rightarrow 1\\\\)), across a decreasing\nrange of temperatures (and increasing pressures) as the nozzle cools\nnaturally. Each point here, is an individual data point. They are collected at\n200m s intervals. At a certain point, the extruder is unable to drive filament\nat the operating pressure, and slip occurs. Our filament sensor detects this\nslip, and the experiment is terminated. This figure also includes traces from\nour preliminary fit, which fits the data against \\\\(P = a^{T + b}\\\\) where P\nis normalized pressure and T is the nozzle temperature set point, as discussed\nin section \u201cFitting Individual Flow Rates.\u201d\n\nFull size image\n\n  1. 1.\n\nThe hotend is heated to its maximum temperature, or to the upper bound of the\ndesired dataset. In our case, this was 290\\\\({^\\circ \\hbox {C}}\\\\).\n\n  2. 2.\n\nThe hotend is purged with 10mm of filament.\n\n  3. 3.\n\nThe extruder is set to extrude continuously at the desired flow rate.\n\n  4. 4.\n\nThe hotend is turned off and allowed to cool toward ambient temperature, while\nfilament continues to be pushed into the hotend.\n\n  5. 5.\n\nWhile filament is being extruded, we record a time-series of samples from the\nextruder\u2019s load cell, filament sensor, and thermocouple at 200m s intervals.\n\n  6. 6.\n\nWe continuously use the filament sensor to estimate of the extruder\u2019s real\nfeed rate against the requested rate. This gives us a drive percentage, where\n100% indicates zero slip. We terminate the run when this value drops below\n75%, indicating major failure of the extruder to generate adequate force. We\nthen store the dataset for later analysis.\n\nThis procedure results in a series of pressure vs temperature traces, each at\na different flow rate. Figure 3 shows a series of these traces, each with a\npreliminary exponential fit, whose parameters are rendered in Table 3. Traces\ncan take between 90 s and five minutes to complete, meaning that (depending on\nthe fidelity desired) characterizing a new machine and material configuration\ntakes between 10 and 30 min.\n\nData taken when the extruder is operating at relatively low nozzle pressures\nwere quite noisy, and so we exclude data points whose pressure readings are in\nthe bottom 15% of the maximal (final) pressure. We additionally exclude data\nin the top 10% of the pressure range, since points at or near extruder-gear\nslip are equally noisy.\n\nLoad values are normalized to span a simple \\\\(0 \\rightarrow 1\\\\) range, where\n1 represents the maximum extrusion force obtainable from the system before\ninducing slip, i.e., we use \\\\(P = P_{reading} / P_{max}\\\\) where\n\\\\(P_{reading}\\\\) is the raw load cell reading (which we take to be linear,\nbut do not calibrate) and \\\\(P_{max}\\\\) is the largest reading taken with the\ngiven configuration.\n\nWe chose not to calibrate our load cell values because the additional\noperating complexity could be prohibitive in deployed systems, and because it\nintroduces opportunity for user error. We also presumed that normalizing to\nthe machine\u2019s own maximal extrusion force would provide enough utility\n(allowing us to pick viable parameters); i.e., it is not necessary in this\ncase to know the real pressures generated in the nozzle, only the relative\npressures. We acknowledge that this limits our ability to compare data between\ntwo different machines, or to perform more advanced rheology on the data.\n\n### Function Fitting\n\n#### Fitting Individual Flow Rates\n\nOnce data are collected and cleaned, we do a preliminary function fit for each\nunique flow rate against a generic exponential function 1.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} P = a^{T+b} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P is the expected normalized pressure at temperature \\\\(T (^{\\circ\n}C)\\\\) and a, b are parameters that we fit using the Levenberg-Marquardt\nalgorithm as implemented in the scipy compute package [34]. A sample of these\nfits is rendered in Fig. 3 and Table 3.\n\nThe function fit our data well, and were encouraged to find \\\\(a \\ and \\ b\\\\)\nparameters were somewhat interpretable; the b parameter maps nicely to the\ntemperature where nozzle back pressure exceeds the extruder\u2019s drive gear\ntraction (i.e., where slippage begins to occur) and functions as an effective\nminimum temperature for the given flow rate. The a parameter then maps to the\nrate at which nozzle pressure drops off, at the given flow rate, as\ntemperature is increased. For example with small flow rates a has a stronger\nexponent \\\\((a \\approx 0.95)\\\\), meaning that pressures drop drastically as\ntemperature increases, whereas large flow rates drop off less drastically\n\\\\((a \\approx 0.99)\\\\).\n\nTable 3 Here, we show fit parameters for data traces rendered in Fig. 3 that\nmatch data against \\\\(P = a^{T + b}\\\\) where P is normalized pressure and T is\nthe nozzle temperature set point, as discussed in section \u201cFunction Fitting\u201d\n\nFull size table\n\nWe suspect that these changes in a relate mostly to the thermodynamics of the\nmelting filament. Recalling that our hardware only measures the hotend\ntemperature at some point in the heat block (not the actual melt flow\ntemperature) we can make some sense of this. At lower flow rates, any given\nsection of filament spends more time in the hotend\u2019s melt zone, meaning there\nis more time to complete the heat transfer. This correlates to smaller values\nof a, i.e., more pronounced decrease in pressure with respect to temperature;\nall of the temperature increase is realized in the melt flow. On the other\nhand, larger flow rates correspond to smaller drops in pressure with respect\nto temperature, since the filament does not have enough time in the melt zone\nto completely come up to the nozzle\u2019s set point temperature. In section\n\u201cExtracting Thermodynamic Models from Data Traces,\u201d we discuss the possibility\nof extracting a thermodynamic model more directly, using the same data.\n\n#### Fitting Entire Operating Spaces\n\nWe extended these fits for individual flow rates across the contour \\\\(P =\nf(T, Q)\\\\) to map expected pressure as a function of any chosen operating\ntemperature and flow rate. We observed that best-fit parameters for b were\ntypically quadratic with respect to flow rate, and a parameters tangentially\napproached 1.0 with respect to flow rate, and developed Eq. 2 with parameters\n\\\\(c, d, e \\ and \\ f\\\\) that we fit again using the same nonlinear least\nsquares method. An example of one such fit is rendered in the plot in Fig. 4.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} a&= \\quad -c^{Q + d} + 1 \\\\\\ b&= \\quad eQ^2\n+ f \\\\\\ P&= (-c^{Q + d} + 1)^{T + eQ^2 + f} \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(2)\n\nInterpretation of the c, d, e, and f parameters are better understood with\nrelation to their a and b counterparts: for example, f maps to b at zero flow,\nmeaning a temperature where flow is impossible even at near zero speeds (or\nmore directly, where we would expect that measured pressure would equal 1.0,\nor the maximum pressure observed in the system prior to drive gear slip). The\ne parameter then indicates how quickly minimum temperatures increase with\nrespect to flow rates. Parameters c and d seem less straightforward in their\ninterpretability, given that the a from single fits is anyways fairly\nabstract.\n\nFig. 4\n\nHere, we show a contour describing pressure P as a function of flow rate and\ntemperature, as mapped to data from a 0.8mm nozzle in an E3D V6 Hotend using\nABS filament. This fit matches parameters to Eq. (2): \\\\(c = 0.957, d = 65.2,\ne = -0.116, f = -154\\\\). Here, we also show the temperature of first-flow\n(marked with a circle, around 150\\\\(^\\circ \\hbox {C}\\\\)) and our system\u2019s\nselected maximal flow rate parameter (marked with a diamond, at 250\\\\(^\\circ\n\\hbox {C}\\\\) and 23.5 mm\\\\(^3\\\\)/s) as described in \u201cExtracting Real\nParameters from Function Fits using Input Parameters\u201d\n\nFull size image\n\n### Extracting Real Parameters from Function Fits using Input Parameters\n\nOur function fits are a useful underlying abstraction to describe expected\nnozzle pressures across a range of operating conditions, but they cannot tell\nus exactly what an optimal operating condition might be. For example, were we\nto suppose that print speed alone were optimal, our functions would tell us\nthat printers should be operated near their maximum temperatures at all\ntimes\u2014but existing practice shows this not to be the case. In order to deploy\nour function fits in available slicers and compare their outputs with existing\nheuristics, we deploy a set of input parameters that map between real-world\nand function fit locations.\n\nThe first parameter is \\\\(T_{rel}\\\\), an offset in \\\\(^{\\circ }C\\\\) from the\ntemperature identified in the function fit as the location where flow is first\npossible. For example, the function fit in Fig. 4 reports initial flow at\n154\\\\(^\\circ \\hbox {C}\\\\), meaning a \\\\(T_{rel} = {80}^\\circ \\hbox {C} \\\\)\nwould select \\\\(T = {234}^\\circ \\hbox {C} \\\\); i.e., \\\\(T_{operating} =\nT_{firstFlow} + T_{rel}\\\\). The second parameter is a relative pressure\n\\\\(P_{rel}\\\\). It selects a flow rate at the provided temperature, by\nspecifying desired nozzle pressure from \\\\(0 \\rightarrow 1\\\\), where 1 is the\nmaximum flow possible before exceeding the extruder\u2019s generative force.\n\nWe reasoned that, given our function fits as an underling abstraction, we\ncould find one set of input parameters that would suit all machine\nconfigurations. To do so, we compared our function fits against heuristics for\ntwo common materials (PLA and ABS) with one highly common machine\nconfiguration (an E3D V6 Hotend with a 0.4mm Nozzle) and one rare\nconfiguration (the same hotend with a 0.8mm Nozzle). The results from that\ncomparison are in Tables 4 and 5. The tables also references four varying flow\nrates, each of which is found within state-of-the-art slicers: an explicitly\nset max rate, and then tracks with high, medium, and low relative geometric\nimportance (which are implicitly set). Based on this comparison, and using our\nown heuristic understanding of the process, we reasoned that we would select a\n\\\\(T_{rel} = {80}^\\circ \\hbox {C}\\\\) and \\\\(P_{rel} = 0.75, 0.20, 0.10\\\\) and\n0.05 for maximum rates and low, medium and high track importance,\nrespectively.\n\nTable 4 Here, we tabulate heuristic nozzle set points against temperatures of\nfirst-flow from data gathered using our tool and function fit, to inform our\nchoice of a stable input parameter for \\\\(T_{rel}\\\\)\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 5 Here, we compare heuristic flow rates into pressures as defined by our\ndata gather and fit, in order to inform our choice of stable input parameter\nfor \\\\(P_{rel}\\\\)\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 6 The input parameters that we chose to use in our deployment of our\nsystem in the evaluation/results section of this paper\n\nFull size table\n\n### Deploying Flow-Based Parameters in Conventional Slicers\n\nIn order to complete our experiment, we finally need to convert our chosen\nparameters (which are described in terms of polymer flows) into parameters\nthat can be interpreted by off-the-shelf slicers (where flow rates are\nimplicit). First, our method chooses flow rates for four types of printer\ninstructions: Maximal, and then high, medium, and low rates as shown in Tables\n5 and 6. These categories match to groups of parameters we found in\nPrusaSlicer, for example maximal speeds are typically used during printer\ninfill, high speeds for top and bottom solid infills, medium speeds on\nexternal perimeters and low speeds on small perimeters. In general, most\nheuristically developed parameter sets tend to assign lower speeds to finer\ndetailed geometries, and higher speeds to invisible or bulky parts of a print\n(like infill).\n\nOnce our method calculates flow rates in mm\\\\(^3\\\\)/s for these four speed\ncategories, it outputs equivalent linear feed rates in mm/s for a selected\ntrack width and layer height. We then manually input these selections into the\nslicer in order to generate GCode and print the test artifacts. This obvious\nshortcoming of the method is a primary focus of our future work, as we discuss\nin section \u201cIntegrating with Motion Control and Slicing.\u201d\n\n### System Summary\n\nOur end-to-end method for the automatic selection of print parameters is\ncomplete in five steps, which we diagram in Fig. 5. First, we use our\ninstrumented extruder (outfit with the same hotend hardware as our test\nprinter) to generate a dataset. That dataset is fit against the described\nfunction, and that function fit is used to extract real parameters using our\nchosen input parameters. To show the viability of this method for extending\nheuristics across multiple materials and nozzles, we used the same input\nparameters in each print shown in the evaluations section; those parameters\nare rendered in Table 6. Extracted parameters are then processed using an off-\nthe-shelf slicer (we used PrusaSlicer 2.5.0), as described in section\n\u201cDeploying Flow-Based Parameters in Conventional Slicers\u201d and test\ninstructions are sent to a test printer (a Prusa MK3).\n\nFig. 5\n\nIn our evaluation of this method to automatically select print parameters, we\ndeploy the function fit and test data on test prints, by matching a test\nprinters\u2019 hotend configuration to that of the instrumented extruder and\nrunning extracted parameters through an off-the-shelf slicer\n\nFull size image\n\n## Results\n\nWe printed the 3DBenchy model using parameters generated with our method in\norder to demonstrate its viability. In Fig. 6, we include images of the\nresulting prints, and in Table 7 we include the temperature and flow rate\nparameters that the method produced, including (for reference) the heuristic\ndata that were available to us once we had purchased these filaments.\n\nOur method produced temperature selections that were within the manufacturer\u2019s\nspecification in all but one case, and was able to automatically produce\nviable flow rate parameters where none were otherwise available. None of the\nprints resulted in failures of any kind, although stringing was visible in two\nof the four filaments tested.\n\nFig. 6\n\nWe deployed our process to produce print parameters for six unique machine,\nmaterial configurations. We then used those parameters to print the 3DBenchy\nmodel [35], a common benchmarking artifact among FFF users and researchers. We\ninclude here, one model printed using heuristically available parameters,\nwhich is marked with an asterisk. Our method was able to produce viable print\nparameters for each filament we tested\n\nFull size image\n\nTable 7 Here, we include the parameters generated by our process during our\nevaluation, matching the images of printed artifacts from Fig. 6\n\nFull size table\n\n## Limitations and Future Work\n\nThe basic premise in this work is that FFF print parameters should be based\nmostly on FFF phenomenology; namely nozzle temperatures and flow rates. We\nreasoned that, if we were able to characterize just this process using a\nsimple abstraction, we could make improvements to the way print parameters are\nselected, using data as a basis for parameter selection rather than simply\ntrialing heuristic selections. While our process does work fairly well, it has\nbecome clear to us that nozzle phenomenology alone is not enough to select\nparameters.\n\n### Extracting Thermodynamic Models from Data Traces\n\nIn section \u201cFitting Individual Flow Rates\u201d we noted that the a parameter is\nlikely related to nozzle thermodynamics, observing that lower flow rates\ncorrespond to more pronounced pressure drop off with respect to temperatures\n(more complete heat transfer) and higher flow rates to more \u201cstubborn\u201d\npressure traces. We suspect that, at higher rates, the filament simply does\nnot spend enough time in the melt zone to come up to the nozzle\u2019s set point\ntemperature.\n\nFig. 7\n\nHere, we show the potential of capturing thermodynamic data from the data\ngathering procedure discussed in section \u201cData Gathering and Normalization.\u201d\nThis plot renders hotend temperature over time, and shows that increases in\nflow rate result in faster drops in temperature due to increases in the heat\ntransfer into the melt flow. We hope that, in future work, we can extract\nsimple thermodynamic models of a machine\u2019s hotend using the same type of data\n\nFull size image\n\nThese thermodynamics are a key limit to FFF printing, as studied extensively\nin [27]. Optimal control of an FFF machine should include a thermodynamic\nmodel of the hotend that could explain the phenomenology we observe in our\ndata, and it seems likely to us that extracting such a model from the datasets\ngenerated here, is possible. To illustrate the presence of calorimetric data\nhere, we include Fig. 7 that renders the same data from Fig. 7 but re-\norganized to show how different flow rates correspond to varying rates of\nhotend cooling.\n\n### Integrating with Motion Control and Slicing\n\nA core limit to our method is that the slicing process itself is entirely\ndisconnected from actual real-time control of FFF systems. Because motion\ncontrollers apply trajectory optimizations on top of selected parameters, flow\nrates that we select are sometimes not actually achieved during machine\noperation. This is a broader limit to the advancement of the FFF process that\nis discussed in more detail in [11]. A similar limit is present to researchers\nof five-axis machining toolpaths [36].\n\nThis is clear also when we look at our results for six 3DBenchy prints in\nTable 7; while our method selects flow rates that are roughly twice that of\nthe heuristic selections, the Benchy part is only produced 12% faster overall.\nThis is indicative that the machine\u2019s overall rate was more constrained by\nacceleration limits than by flow rate limits.\n\nCombining motion control optimizations with FFF-specific optimizations on flow\nrates and temperatures is a logical next step, and we are also developing a\nmodular, software-based motion controller code to do so [37].\n\nSlicers also express parameters in a manner that is fundamentally incompatible\nwith this method: most use linear feed rates to describe print settings, even\nthough it has become widely acknowledged that polymer flow rate is the major\nlimiting factor in FFF processing speeds. COTS slicers\u2019 organization around\nlinear feed rates is not without warrant; higher speeds typically correlate\nnegatively with print quality simply due to limits in a machine\u2019s motion\nsystem. We hope that the authors of the next generation FFF slicers will be\nable to strike some compromise in expressing both of these coupled limits to\nprocess tuners, and that this work can contribute to that discussion an idea\nabout dimensionality reduction in parameter selections\u2014that is, reducing\ncomplex and exhaustive parameter sets into more concise and expressive models.\n\n### Comparing Blind vs Model-Informed Search\n\nIn this paper we present a simple function fitting approach to capture machine\nphenomenology. It works well in this small experiment, but more complex\nsystems may warrant other approaches. Future work will involve comparing\nstrategies with few or no priors (blind search) against model-informed search\nto explore the trade-offs between data requirements vs. modeling complexity.\n\n### Evaluation Methods\n\nWe acknowledge that this paper itself carries out a limited evaluation of the\nmethod, using only qualitative analysis of print quality and a simple\nquantitative printing speed metric. An improved study could implement a more\nrigorous geometric analysis of printed parts for accuracy, as well as layer\nadhesion and part strength tests.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile this work does not make a complete reckoning with all of the\nphenomenology and modeling associated with FFF printing that may be required\nin order to select optimal parameters, it does show that even simple methods\nin combination with instrumented hardware and workflows that connect machines\nto slicers can have promising results.\n\nWe showed that a small dataset, generated quickly using online FFF\ninstrumentation, can be enough to automatically select print parameters for\notherwise unknown machine configurations.\n\nThe method holds particular relevance for individuals involved in slicer\nauthorship, machine design, and related domains as it provides an alternative\nto the exhaustive and labor-intensive process of hand-tuning parameter sets.\nWe hope that the work will contribute to the ongoing proliferation of FFF, the\nadoption of more novel machine designs and filament selections, and an\nincreased ubiquity of making in the world.\n\n## Notes\n\n  1.
