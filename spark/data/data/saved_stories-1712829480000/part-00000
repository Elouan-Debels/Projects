The goal of this project was to create a digital\nresource for science research and analysis, future geologic mapping efforts,\nbe it local-, regional-, or global-scale products, and as a resource for the\neducators and the public interested in lunar geology. Here we present the\ncompleted mapping project as unit contacts, geologic unit polygons, linear\nfeatures, and unit and feature nomenclature annotation. The product overlies\nshaded-relief products derived from SELENE Kaguya terrain camera stereo\n(equatorial, ~60 m/pix) and LOLA altimetry (north and south polar, 100 m/pix).\nThese data are not included with this download due to size considerations, but\na readme in the \"Lunar_Raster\" folder provides the download links. This\ndownload page includes a PDF of the geologic map (right-side) with a brief\nDescription of Map Units and Explanation of Map Symbols, as well as a JPG of\nthe map for quick access viewing. This release is subject to update based on\ncommunity feedback and peer-review.\n\nVersion 2 updates: Two errors were addressed in this update: (1) Large area\npolygons were offset from their contacts, likely due to user error. Polygons\nwere rebuilt to fix the issue and post processing (dissolving, reattributing,\netc.) to rectify the aesthetic of the map. (2) Contacts were not visible but\nshould have been due to incorrect labeling as DND (do not draw). Those that\nneeded to be drawn have been reattributed as \"certain\" those that are not\ndrawn are labeled as \"internal\". Additionally, in version 1 of this data,\ncrater polygons with similar attributes had been dissolved and lumped into\ncontiguous units. This has been changed so that all craters are now discrete\nunits. This adds ~1000 units to the GeoUnits featureclass and the related\ncontacts are now visible and labeled as \"certain\".\n\nReferences:\n\nFortezzo, C.M., Spudis, P. D. and Harrel, S. L. (2020).

Like terrestrial synoptic maps it provides a\nstratigraphic framework to be used for developing new theory and for\ndetermining the regional significance of surface exploration results. In\naddition to serving as a framework for interpreting surface exploration\nresults, the effort to classify units into type and age by photogeology\nnarrows the range of possible origins for many features.\n\nGeospatial Data Presentation Form\n\n    Geologic Map\nEdition\n\n    2.0, March 3, 2020\nNative Data Set Environment\n\n    ESRI Arcinfo\nColor\n\n    Color\nSupplemental Information\n\n    https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/2760.pdf\n\n## Keywords\n\nSystem\n\n    Earth\nTarget\n\n    Moon\nMission\n\n    Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Kaguya\nMission Specific\n\nInstrument\n\n    LOLA, TC, SELENE\nSearch Terms\n\n    geology, structure, , basin rings, contacts, units, moon, lunar, selene, 5 Million Scale, global\n\n## Contact and Distribution\n\nAccess Constraints\n\n    none\nAccess Instructions\n\n    GIS software will be required to view the files.\nUse Constraints\n\n    please cite authors\n\n## Data Status and Quality\n\nCurrentness Reference\n\n    Publication date\nProgress\n\n    Complete\nUpdate Frequency\n\n    As needed\nLogical Consistency Report\n\n    These maps are updated and sometimes a reinterpretation of the original geologic units or relationships.\nCompleteness Report\n\n    \n\nThis release is globally produced at a 5M scale.\n\nProcess Description\n\n    \n\nThe current renovation of the digital maps adhered to strict guidelines for\nvector generation and used recent datasets to spatially adjust the location of\nthe geology and linework. The data sets discussed above were used in\ncombination with ESRI\u2019s ArcMap Geographic Information System (GIS) software,\nto draw vectors on the shaded-relief derived from SELENE Kaguya terrain camera\nstereo (equatorial, ~60 m/pix) and LOLA altimetry (north and south polar, 100\nm/pix). The vectors were drawn with a consistent vertex spacing of ~3 km at\n1:1.5M scale, and were smoothed using a maximum allowable offset tolerance of\n~16 km. The adjustments and adherence to these guidelines resulted in a\nproduct that increased the feature location accuracy at the 1:5M scale and\nmakes the product more cartographically appealing.\n\nHorizontal Positional Accuracy Value\n\n    500\nHorizontal Positional Accuracy Report\n\n    Accurate to Control Net\nEntity and Attribute Detailed Description\n\n    Brief units are described in the released PDF map.\n\n## Lineage\n\nSource Originator\n\n    U.
