If you\u2019re unaware, placebo buttons are buttons that don\u2019t actually do\nanything and are instead used to make a person feel in control of the\nsituation. The most commonly referenced buttons are elevator close buttons\n(they just close on their own) and pedestrian press-to-cross buttons at\nintersections. Patrick did a small, informal study that he wrote about at\nEXBERLINER entitled Idiot buttons: The brutal truth about Berlin\u2019s pedestrian\ncrossings. He found this:\n\n> After studying 30 pedestrian crossings, we found that 28 of the buttons had\n> no effect at all on the length of time you might wait for a green\n> Ampelm\u00e4nnchen to finally show up. (The two exceptions were at tram\n> crossings, where it\u2019s likely that the variation in timing could actually be\n> down to the presence or lack of trams, rather than the pressing of a\n> button.)\n\nThis is such an interesting facet of User Experience design because it is an\ninterface that has no action behind it. It\u2019s an empty interaction. Users, in\nthis case pedestrians, feel like they have control because the interface is\nthe same as other interfaces in which they do have control \u2013 elevator floors,\novens, washing machines \u2013 and have developed a mental model around these other\nobjects.\n\nI thought it would be fun to post the whole background interview in case this\nkind of design interests you.\n\nOther than crosswalks, what are some good examples of placebo buttons that\npeople might like to know about?One of the legendary placebo buttons is the\nclose door button in elevators. Some elevators may use it now, but, many just\nhave it hooked up as a dummy.\n\nWhat problem are placebo buttons created to solve? In your opinion, do they\nsolve this problem well?\n\nPlacebo buttons help people feel in control of technology. It gives them a\nsense of agency when in reality, the systems do what they were programmed to\ndo. It also leads to feeling empowered as if we control this technology when,\nin reality, the technology can control us.\n\nI do think buttons like this give us a feeling of control even if we don\u2019t\nactually have it.\n\nYou\u2019ve been teaching classes on user-centered design for quite a while. When\nstudents have found out about placebo buttons for the first time, what kinds\nof reactions have you seen?I learned about cross-walks and elevators when I\nwas learning about interactive technologies in the late 1990\u2019s in my Master\u2019s\nprogram and started teaching about them shortly after. Some students are angry\nand don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true or they think it used to be true but not\nanymore. Some think it makes sense in comparison to their lived experiences.\nSome are happy to realize it wasn\u2019t just them who thought it was a sham.\n\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/the-close-door-buttons-in-elevators-don-t-\nactually-do-anything\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3880250/The-close-door-button-\nelevator-scam-Manufacturers-reveal-buttons-make-no-difference.html\n\nDo you think these types of buttons or inputs are going to become more common\nor less common in coming years? Why?I think technology continues to evolve in\na black box format, meaning, no one really knows how it works and any knob,\ndial, or button that lets them feel like they are in control will be\nimportant. This will be even more true as technology begins to leverage things\nlike Machine Learning to make \u201csmart\u201d decisions. People will want to be able\nto control something that was designed to control itself.\n\nSomething I thought of after the email exchange: I also think that these kinds\nof buttons give developers new items with which to use in diagnostics.\n\nWhat is the earliest use of this type of device that you know of?That\u2019s a\ngreat question that I do not know!\n\nIs there any one designer or author who has popularized the placebo button\nwithin the design community?**Probably Don Norman.\n\nOther readings: https://99percentinvisible.org/article/user-illusion-everyday-\nplacebo-buttons-create-semblance-control/\n\nSubscribe\n\nGreg Walsh has been designing and educating for 20 years.
