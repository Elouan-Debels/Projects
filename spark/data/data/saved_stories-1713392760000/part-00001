In the face of challenges confronting Ukrainian businesses, global\nchanges in the labor market are shaping trends that are worth analyzing.\n\nTop manager CEO Salary review IT Management\n\nAuthor: Kateryna Osadchuk\n\nKateryna Osadchuk, CEO and co-owner of INDIGO\u2013Tech Recruiters and .GIDNI\nExecutive Search, conducted the fourth annual review of C-level salaries in\nIT.\n\nWe share the results and thank the Fint8 financial directors' service for\ntheir help in processing the data.\n\nCEO INDIGO\u2013Tech Recruiters Kateryna Osadchuk\n\nThis year's survey of top management compensation involved 146 respondents,\nincluding 78 men and 68 women. Observing the development dynamics of the\nsector, this salary review helps identify key factors influencing managers'\nincomes and pinpoint the main motivational factors shaping the labor market.\n\nIt is important to note that in Ukraine it is customary to talk about a\nmonthly salary after taxes, so the figures you will see below are monthly\nsalaries. In the Ukrainian IT sector, the tax paid on salaries is usually the\nindividual entrepreneur tax, and it is 5%.\n\n## Analysis of top management compensation based on gender\n\nLet's start our review traditionally with an analysis of the pay difference\nbetween women and men in C-level positions.\n\nFig. 1. Salary range for women and men in C-level positions.\n\nFig 2. The salary difference between women and men in C-level positions.\n\nThe data clearly shows a significant difference in salaries between men and\nwomen among top managers in the IT sector. According to the median, men earn\n50% more than women, which in dollar terms amounts to $7500 versus $5000.\n\nThe salary disparity is substantial at all income levels, with an average\npercentage deviation of 62%. Our previous review from 2022 had very similar\nfigures. This indicates gender inequality in the sector, where women are paid\nless for similar work. Such statistics require further analysis of the reasons\nand possible solutions to eliminate this inequality.\n\nFig. 3. Median salaries of women and men in C-level positions.\n\nAt the same time, it should be noted that the salaries of top managers can\nvary significantly depending on the specific company, its size, and market\nniche, as well as the position - you will be able to see this below and, in\nmore detail, in our upcoming reviews of specific positions. For example, one\nof the highest-paid positions - CTO - is predominantly held by men in Ukraine,\nwhile the least paid, HRD, is held by women.\n\n## Analysis of compensation based on the age of top managers\n\nAnalyzing the salaries of top managers in IT by age groups, it is evident that\nthe highest median income is observed in the age category from 35 to 39 years,\nwhere it amounts to $7250. This could indicate a career growth peak in this\nage range. Also, respondents of this age group were the most numerous,\naccounting for 31.5%. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the median does\nnot always reflect the full picture, as it is known that the highest salaries\nin the 90th percentile are held by individuals in the 30-34 age group\n($15000), which may indicate the presence of highly paid specialists or\nexceptional leaders in this category. Respondents in this age category make up\n24%.\n\nFig. 4. Salary levels depending on age.\n\nIn the group over 45 years old, the median salary is slightly lower, at $6550,\nwhich may be associated with transitioning to less stressful roles or also due\nto age inequality that occurs in our country. Respondents of this age\nconstitute 14%.\n\nIn the age categories from 30 to 34 and from 40 to 44 years old (24% of\nrespondents), the median salary is the same at $6000, but again, the 90th\npercentile shows higher salaries among younger managers.\n\nInterestingly, the lowest median income is observed among the youngest survey\nparticipants, aged 25 to 29 years, at $6250, likely reflecting a lower level\nof experience. And participants of this age are the least numerous - 6.5%.\n\nThe general trend is that income increases with age, reaches a peak at 35-39\nyears old, and then slightly decreases.\n\nSuch data can be important for career planning and understanding salary\ndynamics in the IT sector. They can also be useful for companies forming\ncompensation policies to attract and retain top talent.\n\n## Analysis of compensation depending on the industry\n\nRecent data from a survey of top management salaries in the IT sector indicate\nquite significant disparities depending on the industry specialization.\n\nThe blockchain industry emerges as the leader in income level in the 90th\npercentile, where salaries reach an impressive $18,800. However, you will see\nbelow that the overall median salary in this industry has decreased.\n\nIt's also worth noting the emergence of new market players, such as Defence\nTech, where the median salary is $7,150, which may indicate a growing demand\nand value of specialists in this field.\n\nIn the AR/VR sector, average salaries have remained at a relatively modest\nlevel for several years - this year, the median is $4,500.\n\nFig. 5: Salary Levels by Industry in IT\n\nThe data reveal significant variations in median salaries among top IT\nmanagers across different industries. The industries with the highest median\nsalaries include:\n\n  * Consulting: $8700\n  * MedTech: $8000\n  * Education/E-Learning: $7250\n  * AI/ML: $7000\n  * Game Development: $7000\n  * Digital: $7000\n  * Supply Chain Solutions: $6525\n  * Blockchain: $6500\n\nThese figures provide insights into how technological and industrial trends\ninfluence the compensation of IT leaders. They are also essential for\nforecasting labor market changes and developing talent attraction strategies\nby companies seeking competitive edges in a dynamic environment.\n\n### Yearly Comparison:\n\nSalary Increases:\n\n  * Consulting: Increased from $6000 to $8700\n  * Education and E-Learning: Rose from $6500 to $7250\n  * MedTech: Climbed from $6800 to $8000\n  * AI/ML: Grew from $6300 to $7000\n  * GameDev: Ascended from $6000 to $7000\n\nSalary Decreases:\n\n  * IoT/Hardware Development: Dropped from $9000 to $4750\n  * Blockchain: Fell from $8500 to $6500\n  * E-Commerce: Declined from $8860 to $7152\n  * Digital: Decreased from $8619 to $6995\n\nThe salary trends within the IT industry show considerable variability by\nsector. Some areas exhibit growth, while others face reductions. These\nfluctuations likely reflect shifts in demand for specific skills,\ntechnological advancements, or broader economic conditions.\n\n## Analysis of compensation based on the age of the company\n\nBased on data regarding salaries relative to the duration of companies'\npresence in the market, a clear trend is observed: a company's experience is\nclosely related to the salary opportunities of its employees.\n\nFig. 6. Salary levels depending on the age of the company.\n\nCompanies that have been operational for 1 to 3 years show a median salary of\n$6500 with an average of $7318. This indicates that new companies, possibly\nstartups, are trying to attract talent with competitive salaries.\n\nFor companies with a history of 3 to 5 years, the median salary is also $6500,\nbut with a higher average of $7977, which may reflect growth and stabilization\nof revenues as the business develops.\n\nCompanies that have been in the market for 5 to 10 years pay a median salary\nof $7000, with a lower average of $6887, suggesting a more balanced salary\nrange among employees.\n\nFor long-term market players with 10 to 20 years of history, the median salary\nis $6000 with an average of $7172, demonstrating stability and a solid market\nposition.\n\nHowever, companies that have been operational for over 20 years are\nparticularly interesting. Their median salary is at $7500 with the highest\naverage in the sample - $8204. Especially impressive is the 90th percentile,\nwhich reaches $20000, highlighting the high salaries that industry veterans\nare willing to pay for top-class specialists.\n\nFig. 7. Median Salaries Based on the Age of the Company\n\nThese data underscore that the experience and maturity of a company in the\nmarket can have a positive impact on the level of salaries, with a special\npremium for those working in businesses with a long history. However, it also\nshows that young companies are ready to compete for talent by offering\nattractive compensation conditions.\n\n## Analysis of Compensation Based on the Number of Company Employees\n\nWhen analyzing salaries in the context of the number of company employees, we\nobserve the following pattern:\n\nFig. 8. Salary Levels Depending on the Number of Company Employees\n\nFor companies with fewer than 20 employees, the median salary is $7000, with\nan average of $7539, indicating that small companies strive to attract talent\nwith competitive salaries.\n\nIn firms with 21 to 80 employees, the median salary drops to $6000, with an\naverage of $6806, suggesting slightly less salary attractiveness compared to\nvery small companies.\n\nCompanies with 81 to 200 employees show an even lower median salary at $5250,\nwith an average of $6777, demonstrating a further decrease in salary potential\nin larger organizations.\n\nIn organizations with 201 to 800 employees, the median salary returns to\n$7000, with an average of $7412, indicating increased payouts as the company\ngrows.\n\nLarge companies with over 800 employees stand out, offering the highest median\nsalary at $7750 and an impressive average of $9604. This underscores that\nlarge organizations have the resources to provide higher salaries,\nparticularly at upper levels.\n\nFig. 9. Median Salaries Depending on the Number of Company Employees\n\nThese data indicate that there is a correlation between the size of a company\nand the salaries they offer. Small startups and very large companies seem more\ncapable of paying higher salaries, while mid-sized organizations may offer\nslightly less competitive salaries.\n\n## Analysis of Compensation Based on the Location of Management\n\nSalaries depending on the country where the company's management is located\nshow that in the USA and the category of Other (unspecified countries), the\nmedian salaries are the same \u2014 $8000, but the averages are higher than the\nrest, indicating a greater dispersion of earnings. European companies offer a\nslightly lower median salary of $6025, while in Ukraine this figure is $6000,\nwith the lowest average value. Overall, the region where the management is\nlocated significantly affects salary prospects.\n\nFig. 10. Salary Levels Depending on the Country of Management Location.\n\nFig. 11. Median Salaries Depending on the Country of Management Location.\n\n## Analysis of Compensation Based on the Number of Direct Reports\n\nAnalyzing salaries based on the number of direct reports, the following\nobservations can be made:\n\n  * More than 15 direct reports: Indicate the highest median salary of $10,000 and the largest average of $11,826, reflecting high responsibility and leadership of a large team.\n  * From 11 to 15 direct reports: Here the median salary decreases to $6600 with an average of $6014, which is still relatively high but noticeably lower than managing a larger team.\n  * From 8 to 10 direct reports: The median salary is $6000, with an average value of $7393, which may be associated with a mid-level management role.\n  * From 4 to 7 direct reports: Shows a similar median salary of $6000, but a lower average of $6851, indicating a decrease in potential earnings with fewer subordinates.\n  * From 0 to 3 direct reports: The median salary is $4500 with the lowest average of $5156, reflecting entry-level positions or roles without direct leadership.\n\nFig. 12. Salary Levels Depending on the Number of Direct Reports\n\nThese data confirm that a higher number of direct reports is usually\nassociated with higher salaries, reflecting increased responsibility and\nmanagerial workload.\n\nFig. 13. Median Salaries Depending on the Number of Direct Reports\n\n## Analysis of Compensation Based on Company Revenue\n\nThe data show that salaries correlate with the annual revenue of the company.\n\n  * Companies with revenue less than $1 million: Have a median salary of $6000, which is quite high for such revenue size, with an average of $6022.\n  * For revenues between $1 million and $3 million: The median salary increases to $7000, with an average of $6796, showing an increase in salaries as revenue grows.\n  * In the range of $3 million to $7 million: The median salary decreases back to $5000, with a slight increase in the average to $6874, which may indicate greater competition or other market factors.\n\nFig. 14. Salary Levels Depending on the Annual Revenue of the Company\n\n  * Companies with revenue from $7 million to $10 million: Reach a median salary of $5500, with an average of $6650.\n  * Revenues from $10 million to $20 million: Show a decrease in median salary to $5500 and an even lower average of $5806, which may be associated with certain structural or strategic changes in companies of this size.\n  * Companies with revenue from $20 million to $50 million: Display an increase in median salary to $7000 and an increase in average to $7808.\n  * Finally, companies with revenue over $50 million: Have the highest median salary of $11000 and a significantly higher average of $12905, indicating that large companies with substantial revenue can offer considerably higher salaries.\n\nFig. 15. Median Salaries Depending on the Annual Revenue of the Company\n\nOverall, there is a certain correlation between the size of a company's\nrevenue and the magnitude of salaries, although this relationship is not\nlinear and may vary depending on the specific revenue size.\n\n## Analysis of Compensation Based on Company Type\n\nThe data show that average salaries vary depending on the type of company:\n\nFig. 15. Salary Levels Depending on the Type of Company\n\nProduct companies have the highest median salary at $7000 and the highest\naverage of $8063, possibly reflecting higher profit margins and investments in\ntalent.\n\nOther companies show a median salary of $6000 with an average of $7106, which\nis lower than product companies but still competitive.\n\nOutsourcing companies have the lowest median salary at $5500 and an average of\n$6248, which may indicate a more competitive market or pressure to reduce\ncosts.\n\n## Analysis of Compensation Based on Role within the Company\n\nSalary data by job title reveals the following:\n\n  * CTO (Chief Technology Officer): Has the highest median salary among all listed positions at $10,000, with an average of $11,040, reflecting the importance of technological leadership in the company.\n  * CEO (Chief Executive Officer): Has a median salary of $8400 with an average of $9000, slightly lower than the CTO but still high, as it corresponds to overall company management.\n  * CHRO/HRD (Chief Human Resources Officer/Human Resources Director) and CFO (Chief Financial Officer): Show the lowest median salaries at $4000 and $4875, respectively, with averages of $4961 and $4706, indicating a lesser relative valuation of these roles in the pay hierarchy.\n  * CMO (Chief Marketing Officer): Has a median salary of $7000 and a higher average of $7500, highlighting the importance of marketing and branding.\n  * COO (Chief Operating Officer) and CPO (Chief Product Officer): Have the same median salary of $7000, but the average for a COO is higher ($7334 compared to $7627 for a CPO), reflecting the COO's broad range of responsibilities in operational activities.\n\nFig. 16. Salary Levels Depending on the Position\n\nOverall, among executive positions, technology leaders (CTO) receive the\nhighest compensation, while HR and financial directors have lower salary\nfigures.\n\nFig. 17. Median Salaries Depending on the Position\n\nFig. 18. Median Salary Depending on the Level of Education\n\nFrom the chart, it is evident that salary increases with the level of\neducation:\n\n  * Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn an average of $4000.\n  * Those with a Master\u2019s degree or PhD receive the same, averaging $6000.\n  * Graduates of MBA programs receive the highest average salary at $8000.\n\n## Analysis of Bonuses and Compensation\n\nFrom the chart concerning the type of bonuses, it is noted that:\n\n  * 40% of respondents reported receiving no bonuses at their positions.\n  * 34% have annual bonuses.\n  * 18% have quarterly bonuses.\n  * 16% receive monthly bonuses.\n  * Only 5% indicated that they receive semi-annual bonuses.\n\nFig. 19. Types of Bonuses (Period)\n\nThese results indicate that annual and quarterly bonuses are the most common\namong survey participants, while regular bonuses (monthly or semi-annual) are\nless prevalent. A significant portion of employees do not receive additional\nrewards, which may indicate a fixed salary structure in their companies.\n\nFig. 20. KPIs That Determine Bonuses\n\nThe chart presents the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that influence\nbonuses:\n\n  * 45% of respondents stated that their bonuses depend on the company's profit.\n  * 32% have bonuses linked to the company's total revenue.\n  * 27% are tied to the performance of the departmental plan.\n  * The same number (27%) of respondents do not receive any bonuses.\n  * 15% have bonuses dependent on the fulfillment of an individual plan.\n  * Only 8% indicated that their bonuses depend on the company\u2019s ROI (Return on Investment).\n\nThe chart clearly shows that the most common criteria for bonuses are the\noverall profit and revenue of the company, while ROI is a less significant\nfactor.\n\nFig. 21. Additional Benefits in Compensation Packages\n\nThe chart presents additional perks in compensation packages:\n\n  * Flexible scheduling is the most popular additional bonus, utilized by 66% of respondents.\n  * Medical insurance is received by 46%.\n  * Payment for additional education and compensation for sports activities are approximately equally popular at 41% and 24%, respectively.\n  * Extra paid vacation and stock options are used by 21% and 18% of respondents, respectively.\n  * Other benefits, such as insurance for children and/or spouses, \"Other\" benefits, and stock compensation, constitute 14%, 14%, and 12%, respectively.\n\nLess common perks include discounts on company products and services (8%),\nadditional long-term vacation (sabbatical) (5%), and rental payments (3%).\n\nConclusion: Flexible scheduling and medical insurance are the most common\nadditional benefits, while other benefits, such as stock options and family\ninsurance, are less common. Compensation for rental housing is the least\nfrequent.\n\n## Analysis of Motivation and Demotivation Factors for Top Managers\n\nFig. 24. Motivation Factors for Top Managers\n\nData in the figure shows that the most important motivational factor for top\nmanagers is the level of salary, agreed upon by 64% of respondents. Freedom in\ndecision-making and implementation is significant for 54%, and flexible\nscheduling is important for 47%. Company goals and mission, as well as a\nculture of trust and opportunities for professional growth, have an equal\nimpact\u201445% for each aspect. The opportunity to do meaningful work and the\nvalue of products/services to customers are important for 42% and 40%,\nrespectively.\n\nOn the other hand, less significant motivational factors include options\n(17%), medical insurance, and stock compensation (both 11%). Even less\nsignificant are additional education (8%), extra long-term vacation\n(sabbatical) (5%), housing rental, and compensation for sports activities\n(both 4%).\n\nThis highlights that for top managers, in addition to financial incentives,\nthe internal culture of the company, opportunities to influence decisions, and\nflexibility in the work process are important.\n\nFig. 23. Demotivation Factors for Top Managers\n\nData reveal the significance of demotivation factors among top managers:\n\n  * Insufficient salary is the main cause of demotivation for 37% of respondents, highlighting the importance of financial compensation.\n  * Misalignment of personal goals and the company\u2019s mission demotivates 31% of respondents, emphasizing the value of alignment between personal and corporate values.\n  * Lack of decision-making freedom and insufficient professional growth, as well as a culture of distrust and incompetent leadership, each accounting for 25%, indicate the need for autonomy and effective leadership.\n  * Dissatisfaction with work-life balance was noted by 24% of respondents.\n  * Repeating the same tasks over many years and a desire for change are issues for 22% and 21% respectively.\n  * Lack of schedule flexibility and a non-open, friendly corporate culture are also significant factors of demotivation.\n  * Less impactful on motivation are aspects such as the absence of bonuses, stock options, or additional benefits such as medical insurance or rental payment coverage.\n\nOverall, factors related to the internal culture of the company, personal\ngrowth, and adequate financial compensation are crucial in maintaining the\nmotivation of top managers.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFig. 24. Work Format of Top Managers\n\nWork format:\n\n  1. The majority of respondents (49.3%) work in a hybrid format (both in the office and remotely).\n  2. 47.2% work entirely remotely.\n  3. Only a small portion (3.5%) are engaged in consulting for multiple companies.\n\nFig. 25. Salary Currency of Top Managers\n\nSalary currency:\n\n  1. The vast majority (78.8%) receive their salary in U.S. dollars.\n  2. 14.4% are paid in euros.\n  3. 6.8% receive their salary in Ukrainian hryvnias.\n\nFig. 26. Compensation Structure of Top Managers\n\nCompensation structure:\n\n  1. Nearly half of the respondents (49.3%) receive only a fixed salary component.\n  2. 37.7% receive a fixed salary plus a bonus.\n  3. Smaller percentages indicate the presence of options (6.8%) or shares (6.2%) in the compensation structure.\n\nFrom these data, it can be concluded that a fixed salary remains the basis of\ncompensation for most top managers, but a significant portion also receives\nadditional bonuses. Hybrid and fully remote work modes have become customary,\nand most salaries are paid in U.S. dollars, which may reflect the\ninternational nature of the labor market or a desire to hedge against currency\nrisks.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nSummary of the Analysis of C-level Salaries in Ukraine's IT Industry for\n2023-2024:\n\n  * Gender Inequality: Remains a significant issue, with men continuing to earn 50% more than women\u2014median salaries are $7500 for men versus $5000 for women, though the percentage difference varies by role.\n  * Age Groups: Influence income levels, with the highest median salary of $7250 among the 35-39 age group, likely reflecting a career peak.\n  * Industry Sectors: Have a substantial impact on salaries, with blockchain and defense technology leading in income levels, while AR/VR remains relatively lower.\n  * Company Experience: Correlates with salaries, where newer companies offer competitive conditions, and well-established companies pay significantly higher salaries.\n  * Company Size: Matters, with the largest median salary in companies with over 800 employees ($7750) and a high average salary ($9604), confirming the ability of large companies to offer more attractive rewards.\n  * Management Location: Plays a role, with companies managed from the USA paying a median salary of $8000, higher than in Europe ($6025) and Ukraine ($6000).\n  * Number of Direct Reports: Reflects salary levels, with the highest median salary of $10000 for managers with more than 15 subordinates.\n  * Company Turnover: Also affects compensation levels, with the highest payments in companies with a turnover exceeding $50 million.\n  * Company Type: Determines salary size, with the highest median salaries in product companies ($7000).\n  * Position: This is a significant factor in salary formation, where CTOs receive the highest median salary ($10000), unlike CEOs ($8400) and other key executive roles.\n  * Most Common Benefits: Include flexible scheduling (65%), medical insurance (47%), and payment for further education (46%).\n  * Demotivating Factors: Include insufficient salary (37%), a culture of distrust, and insufficient freedom in decision-making (both 25%), emphasizing the importance of corporate culture and competent management for employee satisfaction.\n  * Work Format and Payment Currency: Nearly equal numbers of managers work in a hybrid format (49.3%), and a significant majority receive their salary in dollars (78.8%), highlighting the globalization of the IT services market.\n  * Payment Structure: Shows a preference for fixed payment (49.3%), indicating more conservative reward models in some sectors.\n\nThe labor market for C-level managers in Ukraine remains competitive, with\nclear factors influencing compensation and distinct expectations of top\nmanagers regarding work conditions. Companies need flexibility and adaptation\nto changing market conditions to attract and retain talented leaders.\n\nFurther detailed articles on compensation for specific positions are planned,\nrevealing interesting facts such as the salary levels of CEOs or CTOs\ndepending on the industry and type of company work, the country of\nestablishment, the number of subordinates, as well as education, work\nexperience, and other factors.\n\nFor Feedback:\n\n  * We hope this information helps you make informed life and management decisions.\n  * Was this study useful to you?
