This research aims to understand the human perception\n> of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination\n> (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its\n> interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent\n> vs. present). Participants (N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived\n> accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A\n> format. Results indicate that humans rank content as truthful in the order\n> genuine > minor hallucination > major hallucination and user engagement\n> behaviors mirror this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning\n> improves hallucination detection without significantly affecting the\n> perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights\n> for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.\n\nSubjects:| Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Artificial Intelligence\n(cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.03745 [cs.HC]  \n(or arXiv:2404.03745v1 [cs.HC] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.03745arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Mahjabin Nahar [view email] [v1] Thu, 4 Apr 2024 18:34:32 UTC (664 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Fakes of Varying Shades: How Warning Affects\nHuman Perception and Engagement Regarding LLM Hallucinations, by Mahjabin\nNahar and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.HC\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
