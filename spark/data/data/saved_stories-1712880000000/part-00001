The article inspired a short lived burst of other\nprogramming falsehoods. This is a very late entry in the genre, covering\nincorrect assumptions about software projects.\n\nAll of these assumptions are wrong. Try to make fewer of these assumptions\nwhen working on projects. Since you are always working on projects at work,\nalways be questioning your assumptions about projects.\n\n  1. Projects have defined beginnings.\n  2. Maybe not formal beginnings, but there is a point when you are supposed to start work.\n  3. Your manager knows when you should start working.\n  4. You can use your priorities to determine when you should start working.\n  5. You should be working on the project because you were asked.\n  6. You should not be working on the project because you weren\u2019t asked.\n  7. Projects have defined endings.\n  8. Successful projects have endings.\n  9. Failed projects have endings.\n  10. The project will solve the problem.\n  11. The project will solve a problem.\n  12. The project won\u2019t make the problem worse.\n  13. Everyone on the project agrees on what problems the project is supposed to solve.\n  14. Everyone agrees about what solving the problems means.\n  15. Solving the problem will make the project a success.\n  16. Not solving the problem will make the project a failure.\n  17. There is a relationship between the project\u2019s success and the status of the problem.\n  18. The software you are asked to write will solve the problem.\n  19. The software you are asked to write will make the project a success.\n  20. Writing the software you are asked to write means you are doing a good job.\n\nAt best, projects are best guesses by well intended people. At their worst,\nprojects can become meaningless busywork that is completely unrelated to any\nproblems or desires at a company. The fewer false assumptions you buy into the\nmore effective you will be.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### jeffpsherman\n\n### Post Navigation\n\nPrevious Post:\n\n#### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Seven, Maintenance Work as a\nFlight to Safety \u2013 A Manager\u2019s Perspective\n\nNext Post:\n\n#### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Eight, Falsehoods Programmers\nBelieve About Projects\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n#### Smile And Dial CRM \u2013 Part 3 \u2013 Invisible Shipping\n\nJuly 25, 2023 jeffpsherman\n\n#### Fight Settings Cruft With A Lightweight Garbage Collector\n\nNovember 29, 2023 jeffpsherman\n\n#### Phase 1 is a Millstone not a Milestone\n\nJanuary 10, 2024 jeffpsherman\n\n### 1 comments On Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Projects\n\n  * Pingback: The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Eight, Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Projects \u2013 Sherman On Software ()\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n### Site Sidebar\n\n#### Categories\n\n  * crm\n  * Cross Post\n  * dev teams\n  * iterative delivery\n  * podcast\n  * software design\n  * Uncategorized\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * ##### Fixing All The Bugs Won\u2019t Solve All The Problems \u2013 Deming\u2019s Path Of Frustration\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Eight, Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Projects\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\n  * ##### Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Projects\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Seven, Maintenance Work as a Flight to Safety \u2013 A Manager\u2019s Perspective\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\n  * ##### Convincing People Not To Touch Hot Stoves Is Easy\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n#### Tags\n\n#batr #best-alternative-to-a-total-rewrite #development #neverrewrite #SaaS\nadvice ai always be releasing automation batr best-alternative-to-a-total-\nrewrite crm iterative delivery never rewrite podcast programming queues SaaS\nsame but better scaling software architecture software development team\ndynamics Tenancy Model testing TheeSeeShip\n\n### Site Footer\n\n## Discover more from Sherman On Software\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\n%d\n\n", "frontpage": false}
