To mitigate this limitation, we present Holodeck, a\nsystem that generates 3D environments to match a user-supplied prompt fully\nautomatedly. Holodeck can generate diverse scenes, e.g., arcades, spas, and\nmuseums, adjust the designs for styles, and can capture the semantics of\ncomplex queries such as \"apartment for a researcher with a cat\" and \"office of\na professor who is a fan of Star Wars\". Holodeck leverages a large language\nmodel (GPT-4) for common sense knowledge about what the scene might look like\nand uses a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse to populate the scene\nwith diverse objects. To address the challenge of positioning objects\ncorrectly, we prompt GPT-4 to generate spatial relational constraints between\nobjects and then optimize the layout to satisfy those constraints. Our large-\nscale human evaluation shows that annotators prefer Holodeck over manually\ndesigned procedural baselines in residential scenes and that Holodeck can\nproduce high-quality outputs for diverse scene types. We also demonstrate an\nexciting application of Holodeck in Embodied AI, training agents to navigate\nin novel scenes like music rooms and daycares without human-constructed data,\nwhich is a significant step forward in developing general-purpose embodied\nagents.\n\n## Method\n\nGiven any text input, Holodeck generates 3D interactive embodied environments\nby utilizing a series of specialized modules through multiple rounds of\nconversation with an LLM (GPT-4).\n\n## Customizability\n\nHolodeck can customize floor plans, materials, objects, etc. to match the\nuser's input.\n\nFloor Plan Customizability\n\nMaterial Customizability\n\nObject Customizability\n\nDoor & Window Customizability\n\n## Human Evaluation\n\nOur large-scale user studies involving 680 participants demonstrates that\nHolodeck significantly surpasses ProcTHOR in generating residential scenes and\nachieves high-quality outputs for various scene types.\n\n## Humans perfer Holodeck over ProcTHOR in generating residential scenes.\n\n## (^*iTHOR is designed by human experts.)\n\n## Holodeck can generate satisfactory (better than hard-coded rules) outputs\nfor diverse scene types in MIT Scenes dataset.\n\n## (The three horizontal lines represent the average score of each system on\nfour types of residential scenes: bedroom, living room, bathroom and kitchen.)\n\n## Object Navigation in Novel Environments\n\nHolodeck can aid embodied agents in adapting to new scene types and objects\nduring object navigation tasks.\n\nWe introduce NoveltyTHOR, an artist-designed benchmark to evaluate embodied\nagents in diverse scenes.\n\nDaycare_01\n\nDaycare_02\n\nOffice_01\n\nOffice_02\n\nArcade_01\n\nArcade_02\n\nGym_01\n\nGym_02\n\nMusic Room_01\n\nMusic Room_02\n\nDaycare_01\n\nDaycare_02\n\nOffice_01\n\nOffice_02\n\nArcade_01\n\nArcade_02\n\nGym_01\n\nGym_02\n\nMusic Room_01\n\nMusic Room_02\n\nDaycare_01\n\nDaycare_02\n\nOffice_01\n\nOffice_02\n\nArcade_01\n\nArcade_02\n\nGym_01\n\nResults.
