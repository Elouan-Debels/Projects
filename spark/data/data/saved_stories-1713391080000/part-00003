For Now.\"\n\nThe Humane AI Pin \u2014 which Brownlee is hardly the first to criticize \u2014 is a\ntiny wearable computer that straps onto your shirt. It's priced at $700 and\nhas a $25 monthly subscription fee.\n\nIt's supposed to complete daily tasks like making calls, taking photos, and\nanswering your questions. It can even project an interactive screen onto\nusers' palms.\n\nIn his review, Brownlee applauded the build and craftsmanship of the device.\nHe said he loved the concept of an AI assistant and respected the Humane team\nfor attempting to create something new.\n\nIn practice, though, he said the device was slow and its battery life\ninconsistent. Brownlee also dinged it for its poor photo and video quality and\nfor sometimes returning incorrect answers to his questions.\n\nThe YouTuber's review garnered strong reactions on X.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSam Sheffer, Humane's head of new media, called Brownlee's review \"honest\" and\n\"solid.\" He added that \"feedback is a gift\" and said the company would\n\"continue building.\"\n\nIn another viral X post, however, Daniel Vassallo, a tech founder, called\nBrownlee's review \"distasteful\" and \"almost unethical\" given his huge\nfollowing. \"With great reach comes great responsibility,\" Vassallo wrote.\n\"Potentially killing someone else's nascent project reeks of carelessness.\"\n\n\"We disagree on what my job is,\" Brownlee responded.\n\nVassallo told Business Insider he wasn't defending Humane and actually thought\nthe substance of Brownlee's review was \"fair and balanced.\" His main issue was\nwith the title of the video.\n\n\"The power to crush a company shouldn't be taken lightly, and that headline is\nwhat most people will see,\" Vassallo told BI.\n\nOthers agreed that the review had the potential to dent Humane's reputation \u2014\nthough they didn't dispute Brownlee's right to post it.\n\n\"MKBHD bankrupted a company in 41 seconds,\" Alex Finn, a tech influencer,\nposted on X. \"This clip will be the gravestone for Humane.\"\n\nAlex Kehr, the CEO of Superlocal, a mapping app, called the review\n\"devastating for the future of Humane,\" adding that \"the most trusted tech\nreviewer saying it's the worst product he's ever reviewed is going to\neviscerate sales.\"\n\nNeither Brownlee nor Humane immediately responded to requests for comment from\nBI.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: How Twitter panic took down Silicon Valley Bank\n\nAI\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
