She hopes that advancements in AI technology\nwould enable her late father to attend her wedding in hologram form.\n\n\u201cResurrecting\u201d the dead has become a popular application of generative AI in\nChina. It\u2019s one element of an AI gold rush in the country, as entrepreneurs\nrace to invent new consumer-facing apps on top of large language models (LLMs)\nlike ChatGPT. While LLMs could generate text messages, these businesses give\nthe bots cloned voices and appearances that resemble those of the deceased.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a global trend that has made it easier for people to create\ncustomized avatars featuring personas of their loved ones, celebrities, or\nthemselves. Users around the world have shared stories of training ChatGPT to\nmimic their deceased family members. In Taiwan, a tech startup recently\nlaunched an app that can create AI avatars of deceased pets. U.S.-based\nstartup HereAfter AI offers to preserve users\u2019 personas after death if they\nupload recordings of their memories.\n\nThese bots are uniquely prominent in China, especially around the Qingming\ntomb-sweeping festival in early April \u2014 a day to commemorate the dead. With\nthe Chinese government keeping a tight control over religion and spirituality,\nAI avatars have offered those who have lost loved ones a new way to connect\nwith the deceased.\n\nTing Guo, an assistant professor of cultural and religious studies with the\nChinese University of Hong Kong, told Rest of World that China\u2019s control over\nreligion has left citizens with limited options to explore the afterlife\ntogether as a community. She said that while folk religions are popular in\nsome regions, these spiritual activities are not widely practiced, especially\nin the big cities. \u201cChina lacks publicly available resources for bereavement,\u201d\nGuo said. \u201cOnline fortune-telling and AI chatbots became easily accessible\nmeans to provide consolation.\u201d\n\nUnder the officially atheist state ideology, most Chinese citizens do not\nidentify with any religion. Only state-sanctioned religious organizations are\nallowed to operate in China, although people can practice folk customs, such\nas burning paper offerings for the dead, as individuals.\n\n> \u201cThe experience made up for what I missed out with my dad.\u201d\n\nOn shopping sites, sellers now charge the equivalent of up to a few hundred\ndollars to create chatbots that bear the same appearances and voices as\ncustomers\u2019 late loved ones.\n\nA funeral service company, Fushouyuan, said in a virtual press event that it\nis working on a feature where the deceased could appear at their own memorial\nservices as AI avatars. Some creators have posted AI-generated videos of dead\nsingers and actors to promote their deathbot businesses.\n\nArthur Wu, a product manager in Beijing, launched a business in December that\nuses Baidu\u2019s ChatGPT-like Ernie and ElevenLabs\u2019 voice-generating software to\nmake more realistic chatbots. Text bots are free, and users pay a starting\nprice of 52.1 yuan ($7.20) per month for voice messages. Wu can give the bots\ncloned voices and animated avatars if users provide recordings of the deceased\nspeaking and their photos.\n\nWu has attracted about 2,000 users, including 100 paid customers. Some\nclients, he told Rest of World, purchased AI clones to try to hide the deaths\nof loved ones from elderly family members and young children. In fake voice\nmessages, the deceased claimed they had gone abroad for \u201ca secret mission.\u201d\n\nMika, a 31-year-old Shanghai resident, has used Wu\u2019s free service since March\nto text her late husband, who passed away from a sudden illness in November.\n\u201cI miss you so much that I feel I can\u2019t live anymore,\u201d she once texted. The\nbot told her to stay strong. \u201cLet me know if you need help or support,\u201d it\nsaid in a text reply. \u201cI will be praying for you from heaven.\u201d\n\nMika, who requested to be identified with her English name for privacy\nreasons, told Rest of World the chatbot had provided comfort, but its tone was\nnot exactly like that of her husband \u2014 the chatbot was way more talkative. \u201cI\nknow he can\u2019t be replaced,\u201d she said.\n\nWu said his team had to monitor users\u2019 chats to make sure the chatbots didn\u2019t\nsay anything that could inflict emotional harm, such as \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for\nyou in heaven,\u201d since there was a risk of encouraging suicidal ideas. If the\nusers show signs of distress, he said, staff takes over the bots to continue\nthe conversations. At one point, a user texted the chatbot for 18 hours, and\nstaff who intervened found the person in mental distress. The team decided to\nterminate the person\u2019s account to prevent addiction, Wu said.\n\nLin Zhi, who runs an AI avatar business from Shanghai, has been preemptively\ntraining his own avatar for his eventual death. Lin Zhi\n\nIn other cases, creators who make avatars of dead celebrities without\nconsulting their families are being accused of invasion of privacy. The father\nof Qiao Renliang, a pop star who died by suicide, said in March that he was\ndisturbed by AI-generated videos of his son. In April, short-video site\nDouyin, TikTok\u2019s sister app in China, warned creators against \u201cresurrecting\u201d\nthe deceased without families\u2019 permission.\n\nExperts have also warned that attempts to \u201cresurrect\u201d the dead could cause\nconfusion and stress during the grieving process.\n\nNathan Mladin, a researcher at U.K.-based Christian think tank Theos who has\nresearched AI\u2019s role in digital mourning, told Rest of World more studies need\nto evaluate the benefits and risks of deathbot use. \u201cIf you don\u2019t move on\n[from grieving], that can be quite damaging. [The bots] could stop people from\nresuming their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Mladin, people find it hard to grapple with the idea that death\nis final. \u201cSo if there is a technology that connects to that emotional refusal\nto accept death, then they will take it,\u201d he said.\n\nIn China, some are even preparing their own deathbots ahead of time. Lin Zhi,\nwho runs an AI avatar business from Shanghai, has been training a GPT-powered\nchatbot by uploading texts about his daily itineraries, thoughts, and\nconversations with others. The bot, a bespectacled man in a suit, has slowly\nlearned about Lin\u2019s anti-war political stance, cooking routines, and the\ncatchphrases he tends to use, Lin told Rest of World. He also used voice-\ncloning software to make the bot speak in his voice.\n\nLin hopes the bot will become his immortal doppelg\u00e4nger, speaking on his\nbehalf after his death. \u201cIf my descendants ask \u2018What was Grandpa Lin Zhi\nlike?\u2019 they could just talk to the AI version of myself to find out.\u201d\n\nViola Zhou is a Rest of World reporter based in New York City.\n\nRead more stories\n\nRegional Champions\n\nThis delivery app takes away health insurance when workers don\u2019t meet quotas\n\nRest of World spoke with 40 riders for Swiggy in India.
