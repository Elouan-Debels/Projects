Our Loud World Is Making Us Sick\n\nExperts describe ways to turn down the volume, from earbuds to smartphone apps\nthat detect harmful noise levels\n\nBy Joanne Silberner\n\nThe Niobrara National Scenic River in Nebraska is a place where people can\nspend a long time hearing only natural sound at low volumes.\n\nmarekuliasz/Getty Images\n\nTen years ago Jamie Banks started working from her home in the town of\nLincoln, Mass. After a couple of months, the continuing racket from\nlandscaping machines began to feel unendurable, even when she was inside her\nhome. \u201cThis horrible noise was going on for hours every day, every week\u2014leaf\nblowers, industrial lawnmowers, hedge trimmers,\u201d she says. The sound of a gas-\npowered leaf blower outside can be as loud as 75 decibels (dB) to someone\nlistening from inside a house\u2014higher than the World Health Organization cutoff\nto protect hearing over a 24-hour period. \u201cI started thinking, this can\u2019t be\ngood,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not good for me. It certainly can\u2019t be good\nfor the workers operating the equipment. And there are lots of kids and lots\nof seniors around. It can\u2019t be good for them either.\u201d\n\nBanks is a health-care specialist and environmental scientist who has worked\nmost of her life as a consultant on health outcomes and behavior change for\ngovernment agencies, law firms and corporations. She decided to do something\nabout her situation and got together with a like-minded neighbor to pester the\ntown government. It took the pair seven years to get their town to do one\nthing\u2014ban gas-powered leaf blowers during the summer. The process was long and\nfrustrating, and it made Banks think about going bigger and helping others.\n\nSo she did. In June 2023 Quiet Communities, a nonprofit group that Banks\nfounded and runs, sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for not\npublishing or enforcing rules and regulations to limit loud sounds: unmuffled\nmotorcycles, cacophonous factories, the thunder of an airplane just overhead,\nthe roar of an elevated train, the scream of a soundtrack in a spin class,\nheadphones set too loud. There is a federal law that calls for the EPA to do\nthis, but it hasn\u2019t been enforced for more than 40 years.\n\nBanks\u2019s idea that loud noise \u201ccan\u2019t be good\u201d is well supported by science.\nNoise can damage more than just your ears. Through daytime stress and\nnighttime sleep disturbances, loud sounds can hurt your heart and blood\nvessels, disrupt your endocrine system, and make it difficult to think and\nlearn. The World Health Organization calculated that in 2018 in the European\nUnion, 1.6 million years of healthy life were lost because of traffic noise.\nThe organization recommended that to avoid these health effects, exposure to\nroad traffic noise should be limited to below a weighted 24-hour average of 53\ndB (the sound of a campfire from about 16 feet away) during the day, evening,\nand night and 45 dB specifically at night (the sound of light traffic about\n100 feet away).\n\nPrecise \u201csafe\u201d levels to avoid specific ailments are hard to come by. But in\ngeneral, research shows, reducing loud noise can reduce the risk of harm.\nThere are several ways to protect yourself. Various organizations have made\nmaps that indicate quiet and noisy places around the U.S. Smartphone apps can\ntell you if you\u2019re in one that\u2019s too loud for safety. And noise experts all\nseem to own earbuds and headphones and use them often to block out the din.\n\nFor most of human history, the issue with noise was simply how annoying it can\nbe. The first noise ordinance on record was drafted by Julius Caesar shortly\nbefore his assassination in 44 B.C.E., limiting the times that noisy carts and\nwagons could be on the street. The modern industrial era brought regulations\nto protect the ears of workers exposed to steam engines, drop forges, and\nother loud machinery but little information or action on everyday noises. A\nbig moment came in 1970, when psychoacoustics expert Karl Kryter, then at the\nStanford Research Institute, published The Effects of Noise on Man. The book\nfocused on what loud sound could do to hearing and touched on work\nperformance, sleep, vision and blood circulation.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Scientists Discover Extensive Brain-Wave Patterns\n\nSimon Makin\n\n  * ### What Is Pollution Doing to Our Brains?

Noise may signal that a herd of elephants is charging your compound or\nthat a pack of wolves is close by\u2014you need to know, and your body needs to get\nready for something unpleasant. As noise and sleep researcher Mathias Basner\nof the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues put it in a 2014 Lancet\nreview, \u201cevolution has programmed human beings to be aware of sounds as\npossible sources of danger.\u201d\n\nMSJONESNYC; Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (reference)\n\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, sleep was \u201ca very dangerous stage,\u201d a time\nwhen you had to maintain attention to your environment, Basner says. But the\npsychiatrist and epidemiologist, who has spent much of his career studying the\neffects of airport noise on people sleeping nearby, notes a \u201cwatchman\nfunction\u201d that leads to night awakenings is for the most part harmful, not\nhelpful, in modern societies.\n\nA lot of people think they sleep soundly despite nearby noise. They should\nthink again. Basner has exposed hundreds of people to noise during sleep\nstudies. He says many would get up in the morning swearing they\u2019d slept\nthrough the night without waking, but the data showed they\u2019d had numerous\nawakenings.\n\nBy the early 1970s a poll showed that the public considered noise pollution a\nserious problem. Formal government recognition came in 1972 with the passage\nof the Noise Control Act and the establishment of the EPA\u2019s Office of Noise\nAbatement and Control. The act promised that the government would \u201cpromote an\nenvironment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health or\nwelfare.\u201d At the time, the EPA estimated that 100 million Americans\nexperienced daily average sound of 55 dB or over. Fifty-five dB is about\nhalfway between the level of a quiet conversation at home and one in a\nrestaurant or office. Any 24-hour exposure average louder than that, according\nto the EPA, was loud enough to interfere with activities and cause annoyance.\n\nBy this time, studies from universities in the U.S. and Europe were beginning\nto identify health effects of noise beyond the ear, starting with behavior and\nlearning. In 1973 three U.S. researchers, with funding from the National\nScience Foundation and two private organizations, studied 73 children in\nprimary school who lived in several 32-story apartment buildings clustered\nover Interstate 95 where it passes through New York City. Children on the\nlower floors, exposed to more highway noise, were less able to distinguish\nsounds and were reading at a lower level than children on the higher floors.\nThere was even a dose-response relation: the longer the child had lived in the\nbuilding, the lower their scores were likely to be.\n\nIn 1975 researchers at the City University of New York looked at school\nrecords for 161 primary school students at a school that was 220 feet from an\nelevated subway, with trains hurtling by every 4.5 minutes. The records showed\na three- to four-month reading lag for kids in classrooms on the noisy side of\nthe building compared with those in classes on the quiet side.\n\nResearchers were able to do a natural experiment when the Munich International\nAirport moved about 25 miles north in 1992. The scientists found that among\nchildren living near the old airport site, long-term memory and reading skills\nimproved after the airport closed. But for kids near the new airport, those\nchanges went in the opposite direction, and their stress hormone levels\nincreased.\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nCheck out our other newsletters\n\nIn the early 2000s Stephen Stansfeld, then a psychiatrist at the University of\nLondon, studied kids aged nine to 11 living and going to school near airports\nin Europe, comparing their blood pressure and learning ability with those of\nsimilar children who did not live under flight paths. Airplane noise reached\n77 dB(A) at several schools; dB(A) is a decibel scale that emphasizes\nfrequencies the human ear hears best. \u201cWe found a straight-line relationship\nbetween increasing levels of aircraft noise and children\u2019s reading\ncomprehension,\u201d Stansfeld says. \u201cNoisy schools were not healthy educational\nenvironments.\u201d A colleague found the harmful effects lasted into secondary\nschool.\n\nAll the while, the U.S. was getting noisier. In 2014 Rick Neitzel, an\nenvironmental and occupational health professor at the University of Michigan\nwho has been researching noise for 25 years, and his colleagues estimated that\nmore than 100 million Americans had a continuous average exposure level in 24\nhours of greater than 70 dB. Imagine standing next to a washing machine all\nday or suffering occasional blasts from the gas-powered lawn equipment Jamie\nBanks could hear inside her house. It was a rise of 15 dB in just a\ngeneration, which is the difference between normal conversation and a vacuum\ncleaner.\n\nBeyond the brain and cognition, the heart and blood vessels also take a hit\nfrom noise\u2014perhaps not surprising given the stressful effects of noise and the\nimpacts of stress on the circulatory system. A slew of epidemiological studies\nover the years have linked environmental noise, especially nighttime noise, to\nhigh blood pressure, heart failure, myocardial infarction (heart attacks) and\nstroke. The association held true even after researchers controlled for\nconfounders such as air pollution and socioeconomic variables.\n\nSome of the strongest human data come from Denmark, which is an\nepidemiologist\u2019s dream country because it collects health data on pretty much\nevery resident. Mette S\u00f8rensen, an epidemiologist at Roskilde University in\nDenmark, Thomas M\u00fcnzel, a professor at Johannes Gutenberg University in\nGermany, and others teased apart the effects of noise on types of heart\ndisease such as myocardial infarction, angina and heart failure. Looking at\n2.5 million people 50 years or older, they found road traffic noise increased\nthe incidence of all three. In a 2021 report on 3.6 million Danes, they showed\nthat an average daily 10-dB increase in sound exposure because of road noise\nincreased the risk of stroke by 3 to 4 percent.\n\nThey\u2019ve also looked at type 2 diabetes, a condition that had already been\nassociated with chronic sleep disturbance. This link makes sense, S\u00f8rensen\nsays: stress such as frequent awakening raises levels of glucocorticoids,\nwhich inhibit insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Reducing these two\nthings leads to diabetes. In 2013 S\u00f8rensen and her colleagues reported an 8\npercent increase in diabetes risk for every 10-dB increase in exposure to road\ntraffic noise. Eight years later, looking at 3.56 million Danes 35 years and\nolder, with 233,912 new cases of diabetes, they calculated that road traffic\nnoise could be blamed for 8.5 percent of the cases of diabetes in Denmark and\nrailway noises for 1.4 percent.\n\nS\u00f8rensen is aware that those percentages don\u2019t sound very high. But they are\nmeaningful, she says. In Denmark, more than one third of the population is\nexposed to average daily sound levels above 58 dB. \u201cYou have such a huge\nproportion exposed to this,\u201d she says, \u201cso even though it\u2019s only a really\nsmall increase in risk, it\u2019s a large number of people who get diabetes due to\nnoise.\u201d\n\nThe physical mechanisms behind these links are still being investigated, but\nanimal studies have highlighted possible culprits. (Researchers cannot\ndeliberately expose people to such potentially harmful noise effects.) M\u00fcnzel\nexplored some of these connections in mice, for example. In one study, he\nexposed the rodents to average sound levels of 72 dB over four days and found\nthat the animals had higher blood pressure and levels of stress hormones and\ninflammation, as well as changes in the activity of genes that regulate\nvascular health and cell death.\n\nJen Christiansen; Source: \u201cEnvironmental Noise and the Cardiovascular System,\u201d\nby Thomas M\u00fcnzel et al., in Journal of the American College of Cardiology,\nVol. 71; February 2018 (reference)\n\nIn the U.S., most research on noise has been done without much help from the\nfederal government, despite the Noise Control Act. In 1981, after Ronald\nReagan was elected president on a promise of cutting back the federal\ngovernment, he appointed Anne Gorsuch as head of the EPA; she eliminated\nfunding for the agency\u2019s noise-control office. \u201cShe wanted to show the White\nHouse that she believed in small government,\u201d says Sidney Shapiro, a Wake\nForest administrative law professor who has studied the rise and fall of\nnoise-abatement laws. He says noise has never had a well-organized\nconstituency to support it. Responsibility for noise-control research, funding\nand regulation was left to individual state and local governments.\n\nToday the EPA\u2019s noise-control office is still there\u2014on paper. \u201cThere is no\nmoney to enforce regulations or for research or education,\u201d Neitzel says.\nThat\u2019s why Quiet Communities is suing. \u201cNot having the EPA doing its job is\nhugely damaging, not only to the public who are being harmed by noise but also\nto the research community. We don\u2019t have access to a stream of funding that\nshould be there.\u201d\n\nWithout that information, noise researchers have long struggled to quantify\nthe overall impact of the American din. In 2014 when Neitzel and his\ncolleagues at the University of Michigan wanted to figure out whether reducing\nnoise would have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease, they had to\nresort to prevalence estimates made in 1981. In 2015 they published their\nfindings. A 5-dB reduction in average noise exposure would cut the prevalence\nof high blood pressure by 1.5 percent and cut heart disease by 1.8 percent.\nAgain, these are low numbers. But because of the high incidence of these\nconditions to begin with, an average 5-dB reduction would have an annual\neconomic benefit of $3.9 billion. \u201cI was shocked that the numbers were as big\nas they were,\u201d Neitzel says.\n\nOverall, as with chemical and air pollution, people with lower incomes are\nbeing hit the hardest. Their communities may have highways running through\nthem or have factories and airports nearby. \u201cFolks who are already in\nmarginalized communities may be bearing way more than their fair share of\nnoise exposure,\u201d Neitzel says.\n\nIn these areas, it\u2019s essential to ground research and solutions in community\npriorities, says Erica Walker, an epidemiologist at Brown University. Walker\nfounded the Community Noise Lab, which works with communities to study and\nmitigate the effects of noise and other pollutants. She believes that it\u2019s\nprobably not just the absolute sound level that determines bodily damage\u2014it\u2019s\nunwanted sound. If the sound is a welcome one, does prolonged exposure to,\nsay, 75 dB (about the volume of street musicians playing trumpets 30 feet away\nfrom you) raise stress levels the way that large studies have shown? \u201cWe need\nto know what the difference is between sound and noise from an individual\npoint of view and from a community perspective,\u201d Walker says.\n\nShe points to the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, D.C., which has been\nundergoing gentrification. \u201cThe cultural practice was to play go-go music. As\nthe neighborhood began to become gentrified, newcomers had their own\nacoustical expectations of what the neighborhood should sound like,\u201d Walker\nsays. \u201cIf I\u2019m going into a community and I\u2019m measuring noise and I\u2019m saying\nit\u2019s really loud (based strictly on decibels) and harmful to health, that\nmight be a misclassification.\u201d People already in the community might perceive\nthat noise as comfortable.\n\nWalker and her colleagues are now trying to tease apart unacceptable noise and\nacceptable sound. In an ongoing study, they\u2019ve been asking volunteers how they\nfeel about different kinds of noise. Then the researchers deconstruct those\nnoises by rearranging them, making them unidentifiable as a specific sound but\nmaintaining the decibel level and frequency spectrum (think high notes and low\nnotes). By the end of this summer, Walker hopes to know whether the\ndeconstructed sound matches up with the recognizable sound. Such information\ncould help distinguish the roles of sound intensity and cultural connotation\nin human harm.\n\nWhatever your community\u2019s sound tolerance, you can protect yourself from noise\nthat\u2019s intolerable. The simplest way, of course, is to avoid it. S\u00f8rensen\u2019s\ndata show that sleeping on the quieter side of a building, away from the\nstreet, makes a difference. Or you can move to a quieter area. That is easier\nsaid than done, and all the experts I spoke with noted that moving to a more\npeaceful place, as many of them have, is possible only for people who can\nafford it. If you plan to move, Basner advises visiting the new area at\ndifferent times of day.\n\nFor noise that can\u2019t be avoided, science may offer some promise, at least for\near effects. Sudden loud noises (think concerts, jet engines, leaf blowers and\nloud machines) stimulate the delicate hair cells and nerve fibers in the inner\near, resulting in the release of damaging free radicals. Animal work has\nidentified some promising chemicals to sop these molecules up, says Colleen Le\nPrell, a psychologist and head of the department of speech, language and\nhearing at the University of Texas at Dallas, who is working on several\ncandidates. There is already a drug for children to prevent chemotherapy-\ninduced hearing loss, but it has significant side effects and isn\u2019t approved\nfor general use.\n\nThe Montello Foundation\u2019s artist retreat in Nevada has been identified by the\nnonprofit Quiet Parks International as a community without irritating noise.\n\nStefan Hagen\n\nIf you want to get a snapshot of the sound around you, the Internet can help.\nThe National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety has a national map,\nbut it works only on Apple mobile devices right now. The U.S. Department of\nTransportation has a map for transportation noise, but it doesn\u2019t include\nworkplace noise or inside noise. You can see noise across the entire country,\nalbeit at pretty low resolution, on a National Park Service sound map.\n\nTo measure sound directly, there are plenty of smartphone apps. Don\u2019t be\nsurprised if the numbers are high. Data from Apple watches suggest that one in\nthree adult Americans is exposed to excessive noise and daily averages of 70\ndB(A) (the sound of an older washing machine or dishwasher) or greater. Those\nlevels are considered by both the World Health Organization and the EPA as\ndangerous to the ear. You can see state-by-state results on Apple Hearing\nStudy U.S. maps. Apple watches and iPhones can be set to alert you when sound\nreaches a particular level.\n\nThe data collected from Apple watches come from the Apple Hearing Study, begun\nin 2019 by Neitzel and his colleagues at the University of Michigan and funded\nby Apple. The study shows that a quieter world is possible. It took the\nlockdowns of COVID to prove it. The researchers got smartphone data from about\n6,000 volunteers, covering a period from just before the pandemic began in\nJanuary 2020 through late April of that year, when many businesses and\nactivities had shut down for safety, and lots of people were staying close to\nhome. The data showed a 3-dB(A) drop in noise exposure. Because decibels are\nmeasured on a logarithmic scale, that\u2019s a halving of sound energy, easily\nnoticeable by the human ear.\n\nS\u00f8rensen moved from a city out into the country and checked a noise map first.\nNeitzel is very intentional about his exposure. \u201cOne thing that I absolutely\ntry to do is make sure I\u2019ve programmed periods into the day that I\u2019m not going\nto have noise exposure,\u201d he says. That means a bike ride through a quiet area\nor turning the TV off. If he\u2019s at a bus stop, he stands back from the street\nas much as he can, and he routinely wears noise-blocking earplugs or\nearmuffs\u2014sometimes both\u2014when he\u2019s checking out industrial sites.\n\nNeitzel protects his ears at concerts as well. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of social stigma\naround wearing ear protection at a concert,\u201d he says, so he wears clear plugs,\nmuch like many musicians use. And he\u2019s got noise-canceling headphones and\nearbuds. They seal the ear to limit outside sound, which permits listening at\na lower volume. He and his family wear noise-canceling earbuds on planes.\n\nYou can ask others to turn sound down. Sharon Kujawa, an audiologist at\nMassachusetts Eye and Ear hospital in Boston, and her colleagues did an\nexperiment to see whether people in spin classes preferred louder or softer\nsound. They liked softer. The facility managers were reluctant to make a\nchange, but eventually customer requests got them to agree to a 3-dB decrease\nin volume. Fellow ear researcher Le Prell had her children use volume-limiting\nheadphones. The kids were in marching bands in high school, in the percussion\nsection, and she donated earplugs to the entire group.\n\nAs for specific levels to aim for, that\u2019s a tough one. There\u2019s no formula that\nsays x hours of exposure to road traffic noise will raise your risk of heart\ndisease y percent. The EPA, which established its noise standards in 1974,\nbefore the full health effects were so clear, indicates that a 24-hour\nexposure level of 70 dB or less will prevent any hearing damage, and 55 dB\noutdoors and 45 dB indoors will prevent activity interference and annoyance.\nFor lack of anything more current, that\u2019s the standard used by many noise\nresearchers today.\n\nIn terms of protective devices, there are only limited federal regulations on\nheadphones, and there\u2019s some concern that the devices go up to volumes that\ncan damage the health (ear and otherwise) of children. Volume limiters on\nheadphones generally have an upper limit of 85 dB, but what the limit should\nreally be, and for how long, is anybody\u2019s guess. There\u2019s also no solid\nresearch on whether devices that produce masking noises help.\n\nClear, consistent standards for how much is too much, and what works, are\nunlikely without a revitalization of the EPA\u2019s noise-control office. An agency\nspokesperson wouldn\u2019t say whether the lawsuit by Quiet Communities will spur\nany change. The two sides in the suit \u201care currently in the midst of filing\nmotions and cross-motions,\u201d says Quiet Communities lawyer Sanne Knudsen of the\nUniversity of Washington. When we spoke, Knudsen expected some kind of\nagreement would be reached by April and hoped it would be one that got the\nOffice of Noise Abatement and Control up and running again.\n\nJamie Banks now spends most of her time in a quiet town in rural Maine, which,\nshe says, is blissfully free of loud lawn equipment and other noise. She is\noptimistic that a newly active federal noise-control office will establish\ndata-based noise limits and regulations and that the EPA will ensure\nregulations are enforced. In 1972, when the noise office was established, the\nLos Angeles Times opined that it wouldn\u2019t mean an instant reduction in harmful\nsound, \u201cbut at least a start has been made.\u201d Fifty-two years later Banks hopes\nfor not just a start but real progress.\n\n### From Our Archives\n\nHidden Hearing Loss.
