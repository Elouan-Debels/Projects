What is to blame?\n\nAnalysis by Chelsea Janes\n\nStaff writer\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 9:47 a.m. EDT\n\nSpencer Strider is out with an elbow injury. (Gerald Herbert/AP)\n\nListen\n\n8 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nThe 2023 American League Cy Young Award winner, Gerrit Cole, is on the injured\nlist with elbow trouble. The 2022 AL Cy Young winner, Justin Verlander, is out\nwith shoulder inflammation. The 2021 AL Cy Young winner, Robbie Ray, will miss\nthe first half of the season as he makes his way back from Tommy John surgery.\nThe 2020 AL Cy Young winner, Shane Bieber, just learned he will miss a year or\nmore because his elbow needs surgery, too.\n\nThat list barely hints at the scale of what has become a full-fledged pitcher\ninjury epidemic, one forcing Major League Baseball to confront the realities\nof a new era in which velocity, spin rate and swing-and-misses are chased with\nunprecedented myopia and rewarded with unprecedented payouts.\n\nThe full list of injured pitchers reads like a Cy Young ballot for an entire\ngeneration, packed with once-promising stars who never fully returned to form\nand established names who will have to bounce back to remain in pitching\u2019s\nupper echelon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn the past week alone, Framber Valdez, Spencer Strider, Jonathan Lo\u00e1isiga,\nNick Pivetta, Eury P\u00e9rez and Bieber joined the club of pitchers who will miss\ntime because of elbow injuries or surgeries. That club already included Cole,\nRay, Shohei Ohtani, Jacob deGrom, Sandy Alcantara, Kyle Bradish, John Means,\nLuis Garcia, Lucas Giolito, F\u00e9lix Bautista, Shane McClanahan, Germ\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez,\nLiam Hendriks, Tyler Mahle, Jeffrey Springs and Shane Baz.\n\nBut expand the parameters to include injuries of any kind, and the true range\nof the epidemic becomes clearer: Verlander, Max Scherzer, Brandon Woodruff,\nClayton Kershaw, Kodai Senga, Eduardo Rodriguez, Josiah Gray and Justin Steele\nare all on the injured list. It is easier to list aces who are healthy than it\nis those who aren\u2019t, but that would risk tempting fate: The reality of elite\npitching in 2024 is that, even for the healthiest of aces, injury seems like\nonly a matter of time.\n\nThough the problem is escalating, it is not new. For the past decade or so,\nMLB has seen the number of Tommy John surgeries required by its pitchers rise\nsteadily. Ten years ago, renowned orthopedic surgeon James Andrews declared\nthe rising prevalence of the procedure, which repairs the ulnar collateral\nligament in the elbow, \u201can epidemic.\u201d It has only grown since. When Andrews\nannounced his retirement earlier this year, he summed up his explanation in an\ninterview with MLB.com: \u201cThese kids are throwing 90 mph their junior year of\nhigh school. The ligament itself can\u2019t withstand that kind of force. We\u2019ve\nlearned in our research lab that baseball is a developmental sport. The Tommy\nJohn ligament matures at about age 26. In high school, the red line where the\nforces go beyond the tensile properties of the ligament is about 80 mph.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMLB is conducting a wide-ranging study of pitchers at all levels to examine\nthe origins of the issue and help develop recommendations to address it,\naccording to a spokesman. That study is not expected to be completed before\nthe end of this year.\n\nThe cause of the problem, most pitchers and baseball insiders agree, is\nmultifaceted \u2014 though one would not know it from the way MLB and the players\nunion have recently engaged on the matter. The union issued a statement last\nweek offering concerns that the pitch clock, implemented before last year and\nshortened ahead of this one, is causing the jump in injuries because pitchers\ndo not have enough time to prepare for each pitch.\n\nMLB fired back in a statement of its own that cited a study conducted by Johns\nHopkins, which has yet to be published, that it says found no evidence of\ncorrelation between pace and injury. MLB also scolded the union, saying its\nstatement \u201cignores the empirical evidence and much more significant long-term\ntrend, over multiple decades, of velocity and spin increases that are highly\ncorrelated with arm injuries.\u201d\n\nBut while the governing bodies point fingers, the players seem more than\ncapable of understanding that the problem is nuanced and difficult to solve.\nWhen he addressed reporters after a rehab outing last week, Verlander said\nthat while it was easy to blame something like the pitch clock, \u201cin reality,\nyou put everything together, and everything has a little bit of influence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing, the style of pitching has changed so much.\nEverybody is throwing the ball as hard as they can and spinning the ball as\nhard as they can. It\u2019s hard to deny those results, obviously,\u201d Verlander said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword. How can you tell somebody to go out there and not\nto do that when they\u2019re capable of throwing 100? A young guy comes up, throws\none 95 and gives up a big homer, everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What the hell, man?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe emphasis on velocity and spin rate at the major league level trickles into\nthe offseason, too. Oakland veteran Alex Wood posted a thread on X in which he\nsaid pitchers throwing at moderate and high intensity through the offseason \u2014\npresumably to maintain or build velocity and spin rate \u2014 is \u201cbeing overlooked\u201d\nin the discussion about injuries.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came into professional baseball in 2012 as soon as the season\nended I usually wouldn\u2019t touch a baseball until at least December and I\ndefinitely wouldn\u2019t be [throwing] off a mound until at least sometime in\nJanuary. I knew a few veteran players (All Star types) that wouldn\u2019t even\nthrow their first bullpen until they got to spring training in February!!\u201d\nWood wrote. \u201cIf you told a young player today that they had to take 8-10 weeks\noff throwing in the offseason and couldn\u2019t touch a mound until at least the\nmiddle of January they would think you were crazy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, MLB has tried to address the changing approach to pitching many times\nover the past few years. It cracked down on sticky substances, used to better\ngrip the baseball, to try to limit skyrocketing spin rates. It implemented a\nthree-batter minimum to prevent relentless matching up late in games. But at\ntimes, the concern has felt more aesthetic than health-related: The starting\npitcher used to define games, to serve as the big draw, eat innings and ensure\nthere weren\u2019t more pitching changes late in games than runs scored.\n\nMLB and its players discussed several solutions to this problem during their\nmost recent collective bargaining negotiations. Scherzer, for one, was a\nproponent of the double hook \u2014 take out the starter, lose the designated\nhitter, a rule he and others believe would force teams to leave starters in\nlonger. That idea, like many others, remains on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nYet the problem is not just that teams are pulling starters earlier in favor\nof high-octane relievers but also that more and more starters are not as\ncapable of pitching late into games when given the chance. The same problem\nexists when it comes to rules limiting the number of pitchers a team can\ncarry: The goal of such a rule is to force teams to leave pitchers in games\nlonger because they have fewer options to replace them. Pitchers knowing they\nneed to pitch longer, the thinking goes, would have to limit the number of\npitches they throw with max effort to throw more pitches total, which could\nreduce strain.\n\nBut many of today\u2019s more elite pitchers became elite largely by building\nthemselves and their repertoires around maximizing spin rates and velocity.\nThose that have had success and earned big checks one way seem unlikely to\ndial things back voluntarily. And if they do, more change could mean more\ninjury risk. Changing how teams can use pitchers does not guarantee those\npitchers will change how they pitch.\n\nWhat, then, could actually solve the problem? Well, one hard-to-fathom option\nwould be to limit how hard pitchers can throw or limit how much spin their\npitches can have. If a pitch is over 100 mph, for example, it\u2019s a ball. If a\nfastball has a spin rate above 2,500 revolutions per minute, it\u2019s a ball. The\nidea is, at the moment, as uncomfortable as it is unrealistic. But drastic\nchange might be needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile no one aches for billionaire owners losing millions in salary to\npitchers who cannot pitch, fan bases do ache for rotations picked apart by\ninjuries year after year. Winning the World Series requires winning the war of\npitching attrition, which often means playing the biggest games of the season\nwithout the very starters paid to pitch them. As data has forced the industry\nto redefine elite pitching ability, it also has diminished the definition of\ndurability. The pitcher injury epidemic has reached crisis proportions, and a\nvaccine is nowhere in sight.\n\n  * Pitchers are buckling and breaking across baseball.
