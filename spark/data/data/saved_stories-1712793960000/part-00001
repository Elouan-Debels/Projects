I don\u2019t ever want to have to return into an office unless\nit\u2019s absolutely necessary.\n\nPart of working like this, though, is maintaining a sense of self-discipline\nfor the backlog of tasks required for work and doing so in such a way that\nmakes it easy for me to focus on what I\u2019m working on, what\u2019s next, and what\u2019s\nin the backlog. (If you\u2019re a developer and you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019re\nprobably thinking kanban and you\u2019re not wrong \u2013 but what I\u2019m getting at is\nslightly different).\n\nBefore getting too much into the rest of the article, I do want to share that\nthe majority of work I do right now is captured in Asana and organized by\nquarter. We have very little email and very little thrashing between emails,\nDMs, and other behavior commonly associated with the hyperactive hive mind.\n\n> [The] hyperactive hive mind as a workflow centered on ongoing conversation\n> fueled by unstructured and unscheduled messages delivered through digital\n> communication tools, like email and instant messenger.\n>\n> Ezra Klein Interviews Cal Newport\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to take a little further to not only help\nmy day-to-day (especially during periods of increased business) but also to\nhelp give visibility to other people with whom I work so they know where a\ngiven task stands in my queue.\n\nAnd don\u2019t think this is me elevating my day-to-day any more important than\nyours. On the contrary. I\u2019m sharing this to help give insight on what I\u2019ve\nfound that works so it may help you, too.\n\n## Don\u2019t Use Elaborate Task Management Systems\n\nI\u2019ve used a variety of productivity apps and tools over the years, like Things\n(it was the first app I ever bought for the very first iPad!) and Trello (long\nbefore Atlassian bought them from Glitch, fka Fog Creek). I\u2019ve also given a\nfair shake at a number of apps with which we\u2019ve been inundated with the last\ndecade and a half. But I\u2019ve found it\u2019s often the simplest approaches that can\nbe just as effective, if not more so.\n\nIn particular, I\u2019ve settled on two lightweight methods that I find most useful\nfor keeping track of my tasks, projects, and various todos \u2013 a simple text\nfile and a Google Doc.\n\n### A Basic Text File\n\nThe first method I use is maintaining a plain text file on my desktop that I\ncan quickly open and jot down notes, thoughts, links, quotes, and anything\nelse related to the work I need to get done.\n\nWhat it\u2019s like to type into a basic text editor.\n\nI usually have it open in an area of the screen or one of my virtual desktops\nso I can quickly capture the idea and the move back into what I was doing. The\ngoal here to is get the information somewhere I can remember it later but to\navoid the expensive cognitive load of context switching.\n\nThis low-friction system allows me to capture ideas the moment they come to\nme, without having to fuss with a complex task management app.\n\nUltimately, think of it like a digital scratch pad \u2013 I\u2019ll dump in links to or\nquotes from Slack messages, email excerpts, random musings, and anything else\nthat I want to reference or follow up on later. Then, during the last block of\ntime in my workday, I can review the file, triage the items, and transform\nthem into actual tasks, projects, more detailed notes, and so on.\n\n### The Kanban Google Doc (For Lack of a Better Term)\n\nThe second approach I rely on is keeping a living Google Doc that serves as a\nkanban board of sorts for my work. I divide the document into three clear\nsections:\n\n  1. \u201cIn Progress,\u201d\n  2. \u201cUp Next,\u201d\n  3. and \u201cBacklog.\u201d\n\nUnder each of these headers, I list out my various tasks, projects, and\nresponsibilities, along with any relevant details, links, or context. This\nsimple, visual layout gives me a birds-eye view of everything I\u2019ve got going\non.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference in a bird\u2019s eye view and eye-view of birds.\n\nIt helps me stay focused on what I\u2019m actively working on while also keeping an\neye on what\u2019s coming up next. And crucially, if I need to share let others see\nwhat I have going on, I can simply send them the link to the Google Doc to\nprovide that transparency.\n\nSometimes, this affords them the opportunity to find someone else to help or\nit helps set reasonable expectations on when the requested work will be\ncompleted.\n\n### When Simplicity Matters\n\nI find these two methods valuable because they are so lightweight and low-\nfriction. I don\u2019t have to wrestle with complex task management software or try\nto shoehorn my workflow into a particular system. There are no software\nupdates, system downtimes, or anything like that.\n\nIn situations like this, I\u2019m convinced simplicity wins almost every time.\n\nInstead, I can quickly jot things down, organize my thoughts, stay focused,\nand keep moving forward on whatever it is on which I\u2019m currently working.\n\nWe have too many notifications, alerts, red circles, and digital distractions\nthat attempt to push themselves on to us. I\u2019d rather silence all of those and\nthen pull the work I need when I\u2019m ready.\n\nSometimes the simplest approaches are the most effective. By sticking to these\ntwo lightweight task tracking techniques, I\u2019m able to maintain focus, reduce\ncognitive overhead, and ensure I\u2019m making steady progress on the things that\nmatter most.\n\nArticles\n\nTDL\n\nKinsta offers premium managed WordPress hosting for everyone, small or large.\nPowered by Google Platform, they take performance to the next level.
