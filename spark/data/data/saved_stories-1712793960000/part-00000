(Courtesy of Pacific Northwest Forest Defense)\n\nA coalition of environmental groups and regional activists are attempting to\nstop the U.S. Bureau of Land Management from allowing old growth trees to be\nlogged in southern Oregon by waging a complaint in court and sitting in trees\nslated to be cut.\n\nOn Monday, activists from the environmental group Pacific Northwest Forest\nDefense climbed high into several Douglas fir trees in a 10,000-acre forested\narea near Grants Pass. The bureau calls it the \u201cPoor Windy\u201d project and has\nsold more than 2,200 acres in it to six companies to log. Activists say some\nof the trees due to be harvested are up to 400 years old.\n\nThe protest comes a week after Oregon Wild in Portland and Eugene, Ashland-\nbased Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Center and Eugene-based Cascadia Wildlands\nfiled a complaint in U.S. District Court in Medford against the federal bureau\nfor allowing \u201cheavy commercial logging\u201d in another southern Oregon area, Rogue\nGold, that has old growth trees and acreage designated as a Late Successional\nReserve. The designation is meant to protect old growth trees from being\nlogged and to allow mature trees to become old growth stands. The area is also\nhome to threatened and endangered species, the complaint said.\n\nSarah Bennett, a spokesperson for the bureau in Oregon and Washington, said it\nis rare for officials to allow the sale of acreage with old growth trees and\nthat environmental assessments have shown both contested harvest areas are\nlow-risk for habitat destruction.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to protecting trees above the age and diameter limits\nestablished,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cGenerally, those that are greater than 36\ninches in diameter and established prior to 1850.\u201d\n\nGeorge Sexton, conservation director of Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Center,\nsaid the bureau is being dishonest.\n\n\u201cBLM is saying we don\u2019t log old growth trees. Well, they (protestors) are\nsitting in old-growth trees that the BLM wants to log,\u201d he said.\n\nSexton said allowing old growth trees to be cut is contrary to the Biden\nadministration\u2019s recent executive order to end old-growth logging on public\nlands by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe BLM should be implementing Biden\u2019s executive order to protect old growth\nforests, and if the BLM wants to log those trees, the very least they should\ndo is stop lying about it.\u201d\n\n#### Most of the land designated as reserves\n\nThe federal land bureau\u2019s forests in southwest Oregon are part of a 2.4\nmillion-acre patchwork of federally owned forests across 18 Oregon counties\nthat are governed by the Oregon and California Railroad Act of 1937. That act\nmandated that the bureau manage the lands for permanent timber production at\nsustainable levels.\n\nBennett said 80% of those acres are considered reserve acres, and 20% are open\nfor logging sales. But Sexton said the \u201creserve\u201d designation doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily prohibit logging.\n\n\u201cIn the Medford district, they log the Late Successional Reserves just as\nheavily as they log in the harvest areas,\u201d he said.\n\nToday annual harvests from the Oregon and California Railroad lands are, on\naverage, about 60% smaller than those in the 1930s, according to bureau data,\nand this year reduced the volume of timber for sale by 25% across its Oregon\nand California Railroad Act lands. Bennett said the agency has begun to\nprioritize protecting more old growth trees following the Biden order.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management oversee about 278,000\nsquare miles of forests across the country \u2013 an area about the size of Texas\nand Vermont combined. A recent inventory from the two agencies found that\nabout 45% of those forests are considered \u201cmature\u201d and about 18% are\nconsidered \u201cold growth.\u201d\n\nMost old growth and mature forests that are left in the U.S. are in Western\nstates such as Idaho, California, Montana and Oregon.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons\nlicense CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
