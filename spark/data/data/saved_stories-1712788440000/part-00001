It is a kind of unsavory relationship that usually\nbenefits the parties involved; such as the advertiser (sometimes the product\nowner too) and a potential customer (user).\n\nBut, occasionally, this relationship goes too much into the gray, when a user\nis targeted because of their online activity to be served with targeted\nadvertisements on the various sites they visit.\n\nDepending on who you ask, the consensus is that too much targeted ads is a\nsign of aggressive tracking practices that don't belong in this age of digital\nprivacy awareness.\n\nThat is partly why Google has been trying so hard to clean up their act, with\nmany major moves recently. One such move related to their Protected Audience\nAPI has got Mozilla at odds with the search engine giant.\n\nSo, let's dive in and see what's happening.\n\n\ud83d\udccb\n\nI am using the term \u201cAdvertisers\u201d to generalize all kinds of online\nadvertisement-related service providers.\n\n## Google's Protected Audience: Why the Fuss?\n\nFormerly known as the FLEDGE API, the Protected Audience API is part of\nGoogle's Privacy Sandbox initiative that is supposed to facilitate a more\nprivacy-friendly way of serving advertisements to users.\n\nIt works by having a separate secure space on the browser (Chrome, for\nexample), where the user's interests are stored, and the advertisers would\nhave to go through an ad auction run by the user's browser to serve relevant\nads.\n\nAs a result of that, the user's interests and browsing activity on different\nsites is kept away from the prying eyes of advertisers, who would typically\ntrack users across multiple sites.\n\nThis came about after Google got started with their Privacy Sandbox\ninitiative, and revealed that they would completely disable third-party\ncookies on Chrome in the second half of 2024. Doing that would lock out all\ncookies except the ones from the site a user was visiting.\n\nAs one might imagine, this became an issue. Many advertisers were concerned\nthat blocking third-party cookies would give Google the upper hand, as their\nservices (including Chrome) are some of the most used ones across the globe.\n\nNonetheless, amid mounting pressures from competition regulatory bodies like\nthe UK's Competition and Markets Authority, Google appears to be fast-tracking\nthe implementation of Protected Audience.\n\nBut, Mozilla is not convinced, saying that this \u201cfails to meet its own privacy\ngoals\u201d. And, they are backing up their claim with some pretty convincing\nreasoning.\n\nThey present an example where they show that Protected Audience creates an\n\u201calternative information dimension\u201d where any site a user visits could send\ninformation related to how they interacted with it.\n\n\ud83d\udccb\n\nThis is not limited to just one, but multiple sites can do the same.\n\nCredit: Mozilla\n\nSubsequently, sites could then process that data to decide on the\nadvertisements that they would serve.\n\nHowever, only the user can see into this dimension, with advertisers/websites\nbeing able to open so-called \u201cwindows\u201d inside this for the users to peek into\n(read as being shown relevant ads).\n\nMozilla agrees that something like this could be a good thing for users. But,\nthey think that Protected Audience fails in two key ways.\n\nThe first is that Protected Audience has too many leaks.\n\nGoogle, in an attempt to please advertising companies, had to loosen many\nimportant protections that resulted in a design that Mozilla claims has \u201cno\nprivacy\u201d.\n\nEven though Google plans to work on many of these leaks, Mozilla thinks that\nthere exist information leaks with no actual fix in sight.\n\nThat leads us to the second issue; Protected Audience might get stronger,\nsure, but targeted advertising is also a key factor.\n\nEven though information collection was made harder, advertisers still have\nenough access to run targeted advertisements to better manipulate a user's\ndecision-making.\n\nMozilla also added that:\n\n> The positive vision of the effect that Protected Audience might have on\n> competition in advertising is one that focuses on market imbalance. However,\n> it takes an advertising-centric view of the system that is narrow.\n\n> In a sense, Protected Audience is the product of the conjunction of\n> competitive pressure on privacy and antitrust fears, so this is a natural\n> conclusion.\n\nAnd I agree.\n\nI feel that this move is targeted towards appeasing the various competition\nregulatory authorities, while also being on the good side of the many\nadvertisers who aim to capitalize on the huge user base of Google services\nsuch as Chrome.\n\nSadly, in all of this, you as the user have to trade in your data for seeing\nsome targeted ad that may or not benefit your daily life, irrespective of\nProtected Audience being implemented.\n\n\ud83d\udcad What are your thoughts on Google's new ad tech?
