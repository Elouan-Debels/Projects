That\nmissile was the Minuteman was an entirely new concept: a small solid fuelled\nrocket able to independently steer itself to the target. The resulting D-17b\ncomputer was so small for the time, I argue it may have been the first desktop\ncomputer. The debt imposed on us all by nuclear weapons will never be paid off\nin full. But Minuteman became Minotaur, Polaris gave us GPS and Titan became\nGemini. The guidance computers for all of these systems went on to evolve into\nthe modern PC. 3D animation by Artem Tatarchenko: / artem.iskustvo Sources:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/axthi6...
