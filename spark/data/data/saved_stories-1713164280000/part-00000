However, they are not as\nwidely prescribed as stimulant ADHD medications.\n\nTo better understand how ADHD medication prescribing has changed over time, we\nanalyzed 3,389,383 patients diagnosed with ADHD from 2010 through 2022. We\nsought to understand whether there was a change in the proportion of patients\nwith ADHD who were prescribed medications to manage their symptoms. Our data\nshow 61\u201364% of patients with ADHD diagnoses were prescribed stimulant ADHD\nmedications, and that percentage has remained fairly consistent since 2013.\nThe percentage of those with ADHD prescribed a stimulant ADHD medication has\ndecreased from 68% in 2011. The percentage of patients with only non-stimulant\nADHD medications prescribed hovered at 5% from 2011 to 2017 but increased\nslightly to 7% in 2021 and 2022.\n\nFigure 1\n\nProportion of Patients with ADHD with Stimulant and Non-Stimulant\nPrescriptions\n\nFigure 1. Proportion of patients with ADHD with prescriptions for stimulant\nand non-stimulant ADHD medications annually from 2010 to 2022.\n\nWhile the proportion of patients prescribed medications for ADHD has remained\nconsistent, the incidence of ADHD in our study population has tripled since\n2010, from 0.19% of patients to 0.57% of patients in 2022. The most marked\nincrease is seen from 2020 to 2022.\n\nFigure 2\n\nADHD Diagnoses Over Time\n\nFigure 2. Incidence of patients with initial ADHD diagnosis by year. The\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5),\nupdated diagnostic guidelines for ADHD.\n\nHowever, this increase in incidence varies when stratified by age, as shown in\nFigure 3, with patients ages 6-11 most likely to be diagnosed. Even though the\noverall incidence of ADHD remains small in the adult population, the incidence\nin the 30\u201349-year-old group nearly doubled from 0.34% in 2020 to 0.64% in\n2022.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAge at Initial ADHD Diagnosis Over Time\n\nFigure 3. Incidence of patients with initial ADHD diagnosis by year stratified\nby age. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth\nEdition (DSM-5), updated diagnostic guidelines for ADHD.\n\nMuch of the increased incidence in the adult age groups can be attributed to\nincreases in new diagnoses for females. The incidence of ADHD diagnosis in the\n23\u201329-year-old and 30\u201349-year-old female populations nearly doubled from 2020\nto 2022. This supports previous findings that females tend to be diagnosed\nwith ADHD later in life than males.^4\n\nWhile males remain more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females, the\ndisparity has decreased over the past 12 years. The ratio of males to females\ndiagnosed with ADHD decreased nearly five-fold during that time, from males\nbeing 133% more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females in 2010 to 28%\nmore likely to be diagnosed with ADHD in 2022.\n\nThese findings suggest that an increase in the number of stimulant medication\nprescriptions is likely driven by the increase in new ADHD diagnoses, rather\nthan new prescriptions for those who have previously been diagnosed with ADHD.\n\nThese data come from Cosmos, a HIPAA-defined Limited Data Set of more than 183\nmillion patients from 193 Epic organizations including 1,119 hospitals and\nmore than 24,700 clinics, serving patients in all 50 states and Lebanon. This\nstudy was completed by two teams that worked independently, each composed of a\nclinician and research scientists. The two teams came to similar conclusions.\n\nView methodology information and additional representations of the data.\n\nDownload PDF\n\n  1. Cohen AMB.
