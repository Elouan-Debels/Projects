In this post, we\u2019ll cover why we built\nExplore Logs and we\u2019ll dive deeper into some of its features, including at-a-\nglance breakdowns by label, detected fields, and our new pattern detection. At\nthe end, we\u2019ll tell you how you can try Explore Logs for yourself today.\n\nBut let\u2019s start from the beginning \u2014 with good old LogQL.\n\n## We love LogQL\n\nGrafana Loki, Grafana Labs\u2019 open source log aggregation project, provides a\npowerful query language called LogQL. Site reliability engineers (SREs) and\nother Loki experts love to use it to filter logs for specific keywords, reduce\nnoise by selecting specific labels, and perform other operations to get\nanswers to understand their systems.\n\nMetrics can be created from logs, which are put into dashboards to visualize\nkey insights. Alerts can be set up and wired into Grafana Incident Response &\nManagement (IRM), which includes Grafana OnCall and Grafana Incident, so you\ncan make sure you get early warnings when things go wrong.\n\nThose same queries can be used to power Grafana dashboard visualizations so\nyou can make sense of your logs. LogQL is really powerful! There\u2019s just one\ncatch ...\n\n## \u2018But I don\u2019t know LogQL!\u2019\n\nIf you aren\u2019t digging into your logs every day, you might not have had a\nreason to learn LogQL. Perhaps you dive in now and again, or maybe only during\nan incident. And even in those moments, having to remember the details of a\nquery language can slow down response times.\n\nThe point is, you come to your logs platform not because you love logs, but\nbecause you need logs to do your job. Whether you need them to see a\ndeployment go smoothly, to investigate a latency issue, or to deal with a 4\na.m. page, the last thing you want to do is wrestle with yet another query\nlanguage.\n\nIf only you could take advantage of all the great benefits Loki + Grafana\nprovides, without needing to learn LogQL. Well, you guessed it: Now you can!\n\n## Introducing Explore Logs, a new OSS application\n\nExplore Logs is our new OSS application that lets you browse your logs as if\nthey were already neatly organized for you in advance. You can find the source\ncode on GitHub, but before you head there to try it, allow us to give you a\nquick tour.\n\nWhen you come into Explore Logs (in the navigation, head over to Explore >\nLogs), you are presented with a list of detected services or apps. Engineers\nno longer have to fight with teams across the organization to standardize on\none convention. Instead, we embrace the chaos.\n\nServices are presented along with their log volumes and a preview of recent\nlog lines, so you can see, at a glance, which services are the most chatty and\nwhat kinds of logs they are emitting.\n\nDon\u2019t see the service you are looking for? Simply search for it with the\nsearch bar (plain text search, not LogQL).\n\nAs if automatic service detection wasn\u2019t enough, things start to get really\ninteresting when you select a service.\n\n## How to breakdown logs in a service\n\nExplore Logs provides tools to further visualize and breakdown a service\u2019s\nlogs by labels, detected fields, and patterns, all while making sure the log\nlines themselves are always just a click away.\n\n  * Labels are key-value pairs that can be attached to log lines, for example: level=error, environment=prod, app=nginx, team=loki\n  * Detected fields contain structured key-value pairs extracted automatically from a log line at query time.\n  * Patterns are templates automatically derived from the log stream, used to match lines of the same type. New innovations here have led to some powerful capabilities described below.\n\nLet\u2019s explore (get it?) each of these in turn, and see how Explore Logs makes\nit easier than ever to make use of these features.\n\n### Labels\n\nIn Loki, labels are key-value pairs that are used to organize and identify log\nstreams. Labels are attached to log streams to help users query, filter, and\naggregate logs efficiently. They are similar to tags or metadata in other\nlogging systems.\n\nExplore Logs creates a log volume chart for each label, allowing you to easily\nsee which are the most active.\n\nSelecting a label shows you a breakdown of the logs per value. For example,\nlog level is broken down into debug, info, warning, error, and critical.\n\nSelecting a value applies the filter (by writing LogQL for you in the\nbackground) and immediately jumps to a curated view showing the relevant log\nlines.\n\n### Detected fields\n\nDetected fields in Loki refer to fields that are automatically extracted from\nlog messages when they\u2019re ingested. Loki doesn\u2019t index the content of log\nlines, but it can parse and extract fields from logs at query time. This\nfeature allows users to query logs more efficiently by using these fields\nwithout the need to label every possible attribute as labels, which could be\ncostly and inefficient.\n\nExplore Logs offers a seamless experience when dealing with detected metadata.\nA selection of the fields is automatically broken out into a grid view, and\nyou can filter the logs down from there.\n\nTo the end user, the mechanics work nearly identically when working with\nlabels and detected fields, reducing the cognitive overhead of having to\nremember which is which (and the query syntax associated with each one).\n\n### Pattern matching\n\nLoki extracts log patterns, which helps you understand the different types of\nlog lines produced by your services. Pattern extraction occurs after\nfiltering. For best results, we recommend that you first filter by known\nvalues (such as labels, detected fields, and time range) to narrow down the\nsearch space and make patterns more useful.\n\nYou can use pattern matching to:\n\n  1. Understand the kinds of log lines produced by your systems\n  2. Hide noisy or irrelevant lines to quickly narrow down on what\u2019s important\n  3. Focus on specific trends or anomalies by filtering for log lines matching one or more of the patterns\n\nExplore Logs lets you easily add multiple patterns to your filters, which will\ninclude log lines matching any of the selected patterns. You can also exclude\na pattern to hide that kind of log line.\n\n#### Example use case for pattern matching\n\nSay you\u2019re looking for errors among a lot of HTTP traffic logs. It can be\ntough to spot the individual lines you\u2019re looking for. With patterns, you can\nsimply mute the offending lines by excluding lines of that type at the click\nof a button.\n\nConsider the example log lines below. You can clearly see two distinct\npatterns:\n\n    \n    \n    code=200 method=get path=/page1 trace_id=123 code=500 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=124 err: code=500 msg=\u201ddb connection error\u201d trace_id=124 code=201 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=125 code=200 method=get path=/page1 trace_id=126 code=500 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=127 err: code=500 msg=\u201ddb connection error\u201d trace_id=127 code=200 method=get path=/page2 trace_id=128 code=200 method=get path=/page2 trace_id=129 code=500 method=post path=/page2 trace_id=130 err: code=500 msg=\u201ddb connection error\u201d trace_id=130\n\nThe first pattern describes the HTTP requests:\n\n    \n    \n    code=<_> method=<_> path=/<_> trace_id=<_>\n\nAnd the second pattern describes the error lines:\n\n    \n    \n    err: code=<_> msg=\u201d<_>\u201d trace_id=<_>\n\nThe values are stripped away, leaving only string constants and LogQL\nplaceholders that make up the template, or pattern.\n\n> Did you know? In Loki 3.0, you can use pattern filters in place of RegExp\n> for a faster query time.\n\n## What else can you do with Explore Logs?\n\nIn addition to everything we\u2019ve already covered, there are a few other notable\nExplore Logs features to call out:\n\n### Search\n\nMaybe LogQL is hard, but text search is not. Plain text, case-sensitive search\nof your rendered log lines can come in handy when you\u2019ve narrowed your search\nfar enough.\n\n### Copy URL\n\nEasily share your current Explore Logs context with a teammate, to help\ntroubleshoot in a team environment.\n\n### Open in Explore\n\nIs there a feature in Explore that you really like that doesn\u2019t exist in\nExplore Logs yet? Would LogQL be really helpful for you at this point? Easily\njump into Explore \u2014 our UI for data exploration of hundreds of data sources,\nincluding Loki \u2014 while preserving your current context.\n\n## How Explore Logs works\n\nWe can probably agree this looks really cool, and it\u2019s a pretty different\nexperience from Explore. But, how can it actually help developers?\n\nWell, how does solving observability problems faster sound? Faster to close\nthat P1, faster to know what hotfix to push to prod, faster back to bed. Let\u2019s\nshow you how.\n\nSuppose you need to identify a misbehaving pod in one of your services. You\ncan certainly get that information using LogQL and Explore \u2014 construct a LogQL\nmetrics query that counts errors by service, and see which one pops up. But is\nit the easiest way?\n\nNot anymore! Now you can:\n\n  * Start by selecting your service\n  * Select the level label selector, then add level=error to your filter criteria\n  * Select the pod label selector, then see all impacted pods and their error rates\n  * With just one more click, see the log lines associated with these pods\n\nJust a handful of clicks, with visual cues at each step of the way and \u2014 once\nmore with feeling \u2014 without writing LogQL.\n\n## Special thanks\n\nExplore Logs was the result of shared empathy, creativity, and hard work.
