Although caused\nby the same phenomenon, they are distinct events during these types of solar\neclipses. As the Moon covers the Sun during a solar eclipse, the rugged\ntopography of the lunar limb allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some\nplaces while not in others. They are named for Francis Baily, who explained\nthe effects in 1836.^[2]^[3] The diamond ring effects are seen when only one\nor two beads are left, appearing as shining \"diamonds\" set in a bright ring\naround the lunar silhouette.^[4]\n\nLunar topography has considerable relief because of the presence of mountains,\ncraters, valleys and other topographical features. The irregularities of the\nlunar limb profile (the \"edge\" of the Moon, as seen from a distance) are known\naccurately from observations of grazing occultations of stars. Astronomers\nthus have a fairly good idea which mountains and valleys will cause the beads\nto appear in advance of the eclipse. While Baily's beads are seen briefly for\na few seconds at the center of the eclipse path, their duration is maximized\nnear the edges of the path of the umbra, lasting around 90 seconds.\n\nIt is not safe to view Baily's beads or the diamond ring effect without proper\neye protection because in both cases the photosphere is still visible.^[5]\n\nObservers in the path of totality of a solar eclipse see first a gradual\ncovering of the Sun by the lunar silhouette for just a small duration of time\nfrom around one minute to four minutes, followed by the diamond ring effect\n(visible without filters) as the last bit of photosphere disappears. As the\nburst of light from the ring fades, Baily's beads appear as the last bits of\nthe bright photosphere shine through valleys aligned at the edge of the\nMoon.^[6] As the Baily's beads disappear behind the advancing lunar edge (the\nbeads also reappear at the end of totality), a thin reddish edge called the\nchromosphere (the Greek chr\u014dma meaning \"color\") appears. Though the reddish\nhydrogen radiation is most visible to the unaided eye, the chromosphere also\nemits thousands of additional spectral lines.^[7]\n\n## Observational history[edit]\n\n\"Double Diamond Ring\" Eclipse (2 July 2019)^[1]\n\nAlthough Baily is often said to have discovered the cause of the feature which\nbears his name, Sir Edmond Halley made the first recorded observations of\nBaily's beads during the solar eclipse of 3 May 1715.^[8]^[Note 1] Halley\ndescribed and correctly ascertained the cause of the effect^[8] in his\n\"Observations of the late Total Eclipse of the Sun [...]\" in the Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society:\n\n> About two Minutes before the Total Immersion, the remaining part of the Sun\n> was reduced to a very fine Horn, whose Extremeties seemed to lose their\n> Acuteness, and to become round like Stars ... which Appearance could proceed\n> from no other Cause but the Inequalities of the Moon's Surface, there being\n> some elevated parts thereof near the Moon's Southern Pole, by whose\n> Interposition part of that exceedingly fine Filament of Light was\n> intercepted.^[8]\n\nThe term \"Baily's beads\" then came into use after Baily described the\nphenomenon to the Royal Astronomical Society in December 1836. Having observed\nthe solar eclipse of 15 May 1836 from Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, he\nreported that:\n\n> ...when the cusps of the sun were about 40 degrees asunder, a row of lucid\n> points, like a string of beads, irregular in size, and distance from each\n> other, suddenly formed around that part of the circumference of the moon\n> that was about to enter on the sun's disc.^[9]\n\n## In media[edit]\n\nIn 1735, painter and architect Cosmas Damian Asam completed a painting that is\nprobably the earliest known work that realistically depicts a total solar\neclipse and diamond ring.^[10]\n\nThe Diamond Ring effect is seen during the credit opening sequence of Star\nTrek: Voyager (1995\u20132001), albeit from a fictitious extrasolar body, as seen\nfrom space.^[citation needed]\n\nThe Baily's beads phenomenon is seen during the credit opening sequence of the\nNBC TV show Heroes (2006\u20132010).^[citation needed]\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n  * Diamond ring effect visible during the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, in Ravenna, Nebraska.
