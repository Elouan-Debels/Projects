Now use it!\n\nJason Feifer April 09, 2024\n\nWelcome to One Thing Better. Each week, the editor in chief of Entrepreneur\nmagazine (that's me) shares one way to be more successful and satisfied \u2014 and\nbuild a career or company you love.\n\nSponsored by LinkedIn Jobs, where you\u2019ll find professionals you can\u2019t find\nanywhere else.\n\nToday\u2019s one thing: Avoiding problems.\n\nThat one thing, better: Pursuing problems.\n\nMade with DALL-E\n\nThere are things you don\u2019t want to do. Things that stress you out. Things that\nare frustrating, annoying, or costly.\n\nDo not dismiss them. Instead, lean into them.\n\nWhy? Because if they\u2019re bothering you, they\u2019re probably bothering other people\ntoo. And if you find a great way to fix them, you become indispensable.\n\nTo show you how this works, let\u2019s start with a guy who followed this strategy\n\u2014 and built a $10 million business. Then I\u2019ll share how I\u2019ve been doing it\nmyself, with pretty incredible results.\n\n# From losses to profits\n\nHave you heard of Sahil Bloom? His newsletter, Curiosity Chronicle, now\nreaches 700,000 people, earns him $70,000 a month, and spawned an even larger\nbusiness.\n\nI had a question for Sahil: Uhhh, HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!?\n\nHe was kind enough to talk with me. And his answer is fascinating.\n\nQuick backstory: Sahil was an investor, but became more passionate about\nwriting. He gained a following on Twitter, started a newsletter, and then had\na revelation: Writing is a terrible way to earn a living! (LOL, I could have\ntold him that.)\n\n\u201cMost creators monetize in a core set of ways,\u201d he told me \u2014 either by selling\nads, courses, or other products. \u201cThe challenge is, you're constantly having\nto create new content and sell to your audience. It's really hard to make a\ntrue, long-term career in that.\u201d\n\nHe wondered: Is there a better way to do what he loves \u2014 and build a great\nbusiness?\n\nThen he had a brilliant idea.\n\n# Follow the (lost) money\n\n\"I looked at what I was spending money on, on a monthly basis, while trying to\ngrow my platform,\" Sahil told me. The answer was clear: He spent heavily on\ndesign services, video-editing services, and back-end newsletter operations.\n\nSo he asked himself: \u201cHow can I flip those cost centers into profit centers?\"\n\nIn other words, instead of spending money on these things, how could he make\nmoney on these things? Then he started launching businesses for creators \u2014\nincluding a design business, a video-editing business, a newsletter growth\nbusiness, and more, each with their own operators.\n\nIt\u2019s turned out well: They drove a collective $10 million last year.\n\nWhen Sahil explained this to me, he described it as a tried-and-true business\nstrategy. Amazon, for example, spent a ton of money on cloud computing\nservices \u2014 then got into the cloud computing game itself. Now Amazon Web\nServices does more than $80 billion in annual revenue.\n\nBut as I thought about it, I realized something else was happening here.\n\n# Finding problems worth solving\n\nSahil wasn\u2019t just executing a business strategy. He was reframing the purpose\nof his work. By being a creator himself, he\u2019d discovered the problems facing\nall creators \u2014 which revealed opportunities he\u2019d never otherwise see.\n\nIn other words, he did the thing that causes the problems \u2014 because the\nproblems were his next set of opportunities.\n\nThis strategy is not just limited to starting businesses.\n\nLet\u2019s say you work at a company. You join a team, do a project, and experience\na raft of problems. You could be frustrated by that... or you could turn to\nyour team and say, \u201cI\u2019ve seen these problems, and I\u2019d like to help solve\nthem.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re a hero.\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to understand your customer better. You can spend time\nwalking in their shoes, doing the work that they do, and experiencing all\ntheir pain points. Then you can turn to them and say, \u201cI understand what you\nneed, because I needed it too.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re a hero.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ve been doing a version of this myself for the past six months.\n\nIf you subscribe to this newsletter, you\u2019ve probably seen me discuss my One\nThing Better community. It\u2019s a group of solopreneurs, small business owners,\nand people looking to advance in their careers. We have regular calls with\nexperts, share insights with each other, and more.\n\nIt\u2019s awesome. You should join. But, want to know know why I\u2019m really doing it?\nIn part, I thought it would be fun...\n\n...but also (breaking news!), I\u2019m in the early stages of cofounding a company\nthat\u2019ll build communities at scale, and I worried that I didn\u2019t understand the\nmechanisms of community enough myself.\n\nI needed to know why communities thrive or fail, and why community organizers\nsucceed or burn out. To do that, I needed to do the thing that causes the\nproblems. So I launched a community myself.\n\nAnd guys, community is hard! Like, HARD. There are so many problems \u2014\norganization, time management, engagement, the list goes on. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nBut now I understand why people join communities, and I\u2019ve developed\nphilosophies about how to make them work. I also understand the needs of\ncommunity organizers. It\u2019s exciting! The greatest learning experience ever!\nAnd I\u2019m funneling all this knowledge into the bigger company, which I can\u2019t\nwait to tell you about when it\u2019s ready.\n\n# The paradox of problems\n\nLet\u2019s step back from all the business talk for a moment.\n\nImagine walking around on a summer day, and it starts to rain.\n\nIf you want to stay dry, every raindrop feels big and gross. Water is your\nenemy, and you become consumed with avoiding it. To be wet is to have lost.\n\nBut if you are not trying to stay dry \u2014 if, instead, you just allow yourself\nto become drenched \u2014 then each individual raindrop is no longer troublesome.\nYou\u2019re not dodging. You\u2019re not worrying. You\u2019re just in it.\n\nMade with DALL-E\n\nProblems are like this. When we try to avoid them, they hurt. But when we seek\nproblems out, or when we recognize the value they provide us, then our path\nbecomes easier and more joyful.\n\nYou cannot avoid problems any more than you can avoid raindrops. Problems\nexist. They always will. And we should be grateful for that \u2014 because without\nproblems to solve, we\u2019d serve no purpose.\n\nAll of which is to say: Do not be afraid of the things you don\u2019t want to do,\nor the things that stress you out, or the things that are frustrating,\nannoying, or costly. These things are your guide. Seek them. Learn from them.\nTreat them as opportunities to pursue, to take notes on. They reveal the way\nforward.\n\nDo the things that cause the problems.\n\nThat\u2019s how to do one thing better.\n\nPresented by LinkedIn Jobs\n\n## DON\u2019T make this hiring mistake!\n\nIn a given month, over 70% of LinkedIn users don\u2019t visit other leading job\nsites \u2014 so if you\u2019re not looking for professionals on LinkedIn, you're looking\nin the wrong place.\n\nLinkedIn helps you hire professionals you can\u2019t find anywhere else, even those\nwho aren't actively searching for a new job but might be open to the perfect\nrole.\n\nBecause there are so many professionals on LinkedIn, 86% of small businesses\nget a qualified candidate within just 24 hours.

I shared a line that my\nfriends often use whenever something bad happens. They say: \u201cWho knows if this\nis good or bad.\u201d\n\nIn response, a reader named Martha emailed me with this incredible story. I\nasked if I could share it with you all, and she said yes:\n\nI was a frantic, newly divorced mom, running late one morning as I drove my\ngirl to kindergarten and myself to class. Halfway to her school, she spoke up\nfrom the backseat: \"Mom, my pants have a hole in them.\"\n\n\"Babe, it's okay! I'll mend them tonight.\" \"Moooooooommmm....\"\n\nStopped at the next light, I turned around and saw that her leggings had a\nhole along the inseam that ran from one thigh all the way to the other. I\nmentally said, \"#$%!!!!,\" gritted my teeth, and wheeled the car around,\nstruggling to contain my frustration. Back home, I opened the door to find the\nhouse filling with smoke. In my rush to make her cinnamon toast, I had left\nthe broiler on. I could have easily come home that evening to a pile of ash.\n\nThat story became our touchstone. When little things go wrong, we smile at\neach other, shrug, and say, \"You never know!\"\n\nTruly, you just never know.\n\nP.S. Did you miss last week\u2019s newsletter?
