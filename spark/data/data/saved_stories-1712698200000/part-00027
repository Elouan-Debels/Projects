It was released on February 1, 1995 in\nEurope and on April 25, 1995 in North America. It is a Western release of the\nJapanese Super Puyo Puyo featuring characters from the Kirby series. There was\nnot a Japanese release, and the game remains the only Kirby title not released\nthere. In Europe and Australia, the game was re-released on the Wii's Virtual\nConsole service on July 27, 2007 and in North America on September 24,\n2007.^[3] The game was re-released for the Nintendo Switch Online service on\nJuly 21, 2022.\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\nSee also: Puyo Puyo \u00a7 Gameplay\n\nKirby's Avalanche pits players against either computer-controlled or player-\ncontrolled opponents.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as in Super Puyo Puyo, with groups of two colored\nblobs fall from the top of the screen. The player must rotate and move the\ngroups before they touch the bottom of the screen or the pile, so that\nmatching-colored blobs touch from above, below, the left or the right. Once\nfour or more same-colored blobs touch, they will disappear, and any blobs\nabove them will fall down to fill in space. If a player manages to set off a\nchain reaction with these blobs, rocks will fall on the other player's screen,\nfilling it up and giving them less room to drop additional blobs. The number\nof rocks that falls depends on both the number of blobs popped and the number\nof consecutive chain reactions. These rocks will only disappear if a player\nmanages to pop a group of blobs that are in direct contact with the rocks. A\nplayer will lose if either of the middle columns in the top row is filled with\na blob or rock.\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\nKing Dedede has challenged Kirby and other members of Dream Land to an\nAvalanche Competition at the Fountain of Dreams. Kirby decides to take on the\nchallenge, battling his way through the forest in Avalanche matches against an\nassortment of his old foes from Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Adventure\n(including recurring bosses such as Whispy Woods, Kracko and Meta Knight), and\nultimately to a final showdown at the Fountain of Dreams with King Dedede to\nwin the Cup.\n\n## Version differences[edit]\n\nWhile the core gameplay remains the same, the Japanese and Western versions\nare drastically different cosmetically. As the story in Super Puyo Puyo is\nmore focused on Arle Nadja and Carbuncle's adventures like the Madou\nMonogatari and Mega Drive Puyo Puyo versions, the Western version replaced\nthem with Kirby characters to appeal to Western audiences.\n\nAs a game released later in the SNES's life cycle, this game has bright colors\nand advanced graphics for its time. The sound consists of remixed tracks from\nKirby's Adventure and Kirby's Dream Course, with only one original track from\nthe Puyo Puyo game itself (the panic music). The game also includes several\nvoice samples.\n\nBoth versions have cinematics between each round, with differences being Kirby\nand his opponents shown having full conversations and trash-talking each other\nin full sentences in the Western version, and that Kirby's personality comes\noff as a lot more sarcastic and confrontational, just as Arle and Carbuncle\nwere in the Japanese version. This differs greatly from other Kirby games,\nwhere Kirby hardly speaks at all and is also friendlier in general.\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nReception\n\nAggregate scoreAggregator| Score  \n---|---  \nGameRankings| 74%^[4]  \nReview scoresPublication| Score  \n---|---  \nAllGame| ^[5]  \nComputer and Video Games| ^[6]  \nGameSpot| 6.5/10^[7]  \nHyper| 80/100^[8]  \nIGN| 7.5/10^[9]  \nMega Fun| 73%^[10]  \nNext Generation| ^[13]  \nNintendo Life| ^[11]  \nNintendo Power| 3.425/5^[12]  \nOfficial Nintendo Magazine| 90/100^[14]  \nTotal!| 91/100^[15]  \nVideo Games (DE)| 75%^[16]  \nVideoGames & Computer Entertainment| 8/10^[17]  \n  \nKirby's Avalanche received generally positive reviews, garnering an aggregate\nscore of 74% on GameRankings based on seven reviews.^[4] IGN awarded the game\n7.5 out of 10, comparing it favorably to Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine,\nanother Puyo Puyo reskin released for the Sega Genesis in North America.^[9]\nGamePro commented that \"Although Kirby's Avalanche is a rehash of an overdone\npuzzler theme, it's so well done that it's worth playing - that is, if you\ndon't already have three puzzle games just like it.\" They particularly praised\nthe graphics and the cuteness of the digitized speech.^[18]\n\nNext Generation stated that \"While we've seen this kind of game before, and\nthis version doesn't offer any improvements it's still excellent fun.\"^[13]\n\nIn 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked Kirby's Avalanche and Mean Bean\nMachine collectively as number 84 on their \"100 Best Games of All Time\",\ncalling it \"one of the simplest, most addicting puzzle games around.\"^[19] IGN\nrated the game 68th on its \"Top 100 SNES of All Time.\"^[20] In 1995, Total!\nlisted the game 9th on their Top 100 SNES Games.^[21]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Kirby's Avalanche - Super NES - GameSpy\".
