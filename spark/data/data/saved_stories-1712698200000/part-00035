I wrote in September of\nlast year about problems with toxicity in the Hyprland community. I initially\nreached out to Vaxry to discuss these problems in private in February of last\nyear. I failed to get through to him, leading to that blog post in September.\nI spent some time in the following weeks talking with Vaxry on his behavior\nand his community\u2019s social norms, again in private, but again, I was unable to\nget through to him. Unfortunately, we find ourselves again leaving the private\nsphere and discussing Vaxry\u2019s behavior and the problem posed by the Hyprland\ncommunity once again.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Hyprland remains a toxic community, enabled and\nencouraged by its toxic leadership, namely Vaxry. FDO\u2019s decision to ban Vaxry\nis ultimately a consequence of Vaxry\u2019s behavior, and because he has elected to\nappeal his case in public, I am compelled to address his behavior in public. I\nhereby rise firmly in defense of FDO\u2019s decision.\n\nI invite you to start by reading the two email threads, one, and two, which\nVaxry has published for your consideration, as well as Vaxry\u2019s follow-ups on\nhis blog, one, and two.\n\nHere\u2019s my read on the situation.\n\nThe FDO officer that reached out to Vaxry did it after Vaxry\u2019s problematic\nbehavior was brought to her attention by members of the FDO community, and was\nacting on her mandate within the FDO conduct enforcement board by\ninvestigating complaints submitted to her by this community. It is not a\nstretch to suggest a close relationship between these communities exists: FDO\nis the steward of both the Wayland protocol and implementation and the wlroots\nlibrary, essential dependencies of Hyprland and sources for collaboration\nbetween Hyprland and FDO. Vaxry and other members of the Hyprland community\nhad already participated extensively in these projects (mainly in discussions\non IRC and GitLab issues) at the time of the email exchange, in spaces where\nthe code of conduct applies.\n\nThe FDO officer duly investigated the complaints she had received and found,\nin collaboration with the other members of the FDO conduct enforcement team,\nthat they were credible, and worrying. There are numerous examples of behavior\nfrom Vaxry that contravenes the FDO code of conduct in several different\nrespects, and any number of them would be grounds for an immediate ban. Since\nthese behaviors are concerning, but did not take place in the FDO community,\nthe conduct board decided to issue a warning in private, stating that if this\nsort of behavior was seen in the FDO community that it would result in\nenforcement action from the conduct team.\n\nAll of the actions from the FDO conduct team are reasonable and show\nconsiderable restraint. Vaxry could have taken it in stride with no\nconsequences to himself. Instead, he immediately escalated the situation. He\nconstrues the FDO officer\u2019s polite and well-reasoned warning as threats and\nintimidation. He minimizes examples of his own hate speech by shrugging them\noff as a joke. He belittles the FDO officer and builds a straw man wherein her\nemail is an official statement on behalf of RedHat, and cites a conspiracy\ntheory about DEI programs at RedHat as justification for calling the FDO\nofficer a hypocrite. He is insulted on my behalf that my name was cited in the\nFDO officer\u2019s email in lowercase, \u201cdrew\u201d, and feels the need to address this.\n\nThe FDO officer responds to Vaxry\u2019s unhinged rant with a sarcastic quip\nclarifying that it was indeed within the FDO conduct team\u2019s remit to ban Vaxry\nfrom their GitLab instance \u2013 I confess that in my view this was somewhat\nunprofessional, though I can easily sympathize with the FDO officer given the\ncontext. Following this, Vaxry states that Hyprland will cease all\ncommunication with FDO\u2019s conduct team and ignore (emphasis his) any future\nemails from them. Finally, he threatens legal action (on what basis is\nunclear) and signs the email.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about the conduct team issuing a private warning to\nVaxry on the basis of activities outside of FDO community spaces, the email\nthread that ensues most certainly is within the scope of the FDO code of\nconduct, and Vaxry\u2019s behavior therein is sufficient justification for a ban\nfrom the FDO community as far as I\u2019m concerned. The conduct team cites Vaxry\u2019s\nstated intention to ignore any future conduct interventions as the ultimate\nreason for the ban, which I find entirely reasonable on FDO\u2019s part. I have\nbanned people for far less than this, and I stand by it.\n\nVaxry\u2019s follow-up blog posts only serve to underscore this point. First of\nall, he immediately opens with a dog-whistle calling for the reader to harass\nthe FDO officer in question: \u201cI don\u2019t condone harassing this person, but here\nis their full name, employer and contact details\u201d:\n\n> I do not condone any hateful messages sent towards any of the parties\n> mentioned.\n>\n> Recently I have received an email filled with threats to my inbox, from a\n> member of the X.org board, Freedesktop.org, and a Red Hat employee. Their\n> name is [redacted].\n\nMoreover, Vaxry claims to have apologised for his past conduct, which is not\ntrue. In lieu of an apology, Vaxry has spent the \u201c1.5 years\u201d since the last\nincident posting angry rants on his blog calling out minority representation\nand \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d in light of his perceived persecution. Meanwhile\nthe Hyprland community remains a toxic place, welcoming hate, bullying, and\nharassment, but now prohibiting all \u201cpolitical\u201d speech, which in practice\nmeans any discussion of LGBTQ topics, though this is largely unenforced. In\nthe end, the Hyprland community\u2019s fundamental problem is that they\u2019re all\n\u201cjust having fun\u201d, and it seems that they can\u2019t have \u201cfun\u201d unless it\u2019s at\nsomeone else\u2019s expense.\n\nThe FDO team is right that Hyprland\u2019s community reflects poorly on the Linux\ndesktop community as a whole. Vaxry has created a foothold for hate,\ntransphobia, homophobia, bullying, and harassment in the Linux desktop\ncommunity. We are right to take action to correct this problem.\n\nEvery option other than banning Vaxry has been exhausted over the past year\nand a half. I personally spent several weeks following my last blog post on\nthe matter discussing Vaxry\u2019s behavior in confidence and helping him\nunderstand how to improve, and at my suggestion he joined a private community\nof positive male role models to discuss these issues in a private and\nempathetic space. After a few weeks of these private discussions, the last\nthing he said to me was \u201cI do believe there could be arguments to sway my\nopinion towards genocide\u201d.^1\n\nThere\u2019s nothing left to do but to build a fence around Hyprland and protect\nthe rest of the community from them. I know that there\u2019s a lot of good people\nwho use and contribute to Hyprland, and I\u2019m sorry for those of you who are\naffected by this problem. But, in the end, actions have consequences. The rest\nof the community has no choice but to sanction Vaxry.\n\nAnd, to Vaxry \u2013 I know you\u2019re reading this \u2013 there are going to continue to be\nconsequences for your actions, but it\u2019s still not too late to change. I know\nit\u2019s humiliating to be called out like this, and I really would rather not\nhave had to do so. FDO is probably not the last time you\u2019re going to be banned\nif you don\u2019t change course, and it would reflect better on you if you took it\non the chin and didn\u2019t post inflammatory rants on your blog \u2013 trust me, you\ndon\u2019t look like the good guy here. You are trapped in an echo chamber of hate,\nanger, and bigotry. I hope that you find a way out, and that someday you can\nbuild a community which is as great as your software is.\n\nAnd, to the FDO officer in question: I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re at the ass end\nof all of this hate and abuse. You don\u2019t deserve any of it. You did a good\njob, and I\u2019m proud of you and the rest of the FDO conduct team. If you need\nany support, someone to talk to, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out and ask, on IRC,\nMatrix, email, whatever. Don\u2019t read the comments.\n\nAnd on that note, I condemn in the harshest terms the response from\ncommunities like /r/linux on the subject. The vile harassment and hate\ndirected at the FDO officer in question is obscene and completely\nunjustifiable. I don\u2019t care what window manager or desktop environment you use\n\u2013 this kind of behavior is completely uncalled for. I expect better.\n\nP.S. The Hyprland community has already descended on me before even publishing\nthis post, after I called Vaxry out on Mastodon a few hours ago. My\nnotifications are not full of reasonable objections to my complaints, but\ninstead the response is slurs and death threats. This only serves to prove my\ncharacterization of the Hyprland community as deeply toxic.\n\n  1. Yes, this is taken out of context. But, if you raise this objection, I struggle to imagine in what context you think this statement can be read sympathetically. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n## Articles from blogs I read Generated by openring\n\n#### I created a monster\n\nI guess it\u2019s not a surprise, but I just don\u2019t enjoy writing very much.
