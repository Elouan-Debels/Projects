It simplifies the management of JetBrains IDEs,\nremote development environments, and JetBrains AI, while enhancing\nproductivity across entire engineering departments.\n\nThe suite caters to a range of users responsible for managing an enterprise\u2019s\ntech stack purchased from JetBrains, including developer experience and\ndeveloper productivity executives, CTOs, IT department leads, IT admins, and\nothers.\n\nGet started\n\n## JetBrains IDE Services: What\u2019s inside?\n\nA sleek control panel simplifies the management of developer tools, providing\ndevelopers with a seamless experience.
