The\nSubAir System was developed in the nineteen-nineties, by the aptly named\ncourse superintendent Marsh Benson, in an effort to mitigate the effects of\nnature on this precious facsimile of it. When the system\u2019s fans blow one way,\nthey provide air to the densely seeded bent grass of the putting surface. This\npromotes growth. When the fans are reversed, they create a suction effect, and\nleach water from the greens. This promotes firmness. The professionals who\narrive at Augusta every April to compete in the Masters Tournament, the event\nfor which the club is known, expect to be tested by greens that are hard and\nfast. Amid all the other immodesties and peculiarities of Augusta, the greens,\nultimately, are the thing. Herbert Warren Wind, who for decades covered the\nsport at this magazine and at Sports Illustrated, once asked a colleague, on\narriving in Augusta, \u201cAre they firm?\u201d The antecedent was understood. In 1994,\nGary McCord, a golf commentator for CBS, the network that has televised the\ntournament for sixty-three years, said on the air, \u201cThey don\u2019t cut the greens\nhere at Augusta, they use bikini wax.\u201d He was banned from the broadcast.\n\nIt is by now hardly scandalous to note that Augusta National\u2014called the\nNational by its members and devotees, and Augusta by everyone else\u2014is an\nenvironment of extreme artifice, an elaborate television soundstage, a\nfantasia of the fifties, a Disneyclub in the Georgia pines. Some of the\ncomponents of the illusion are a matter of speculation, as the club is\nnotoriously stingy with information about itself. It has been accepted as fact\nthat recalcitrant patches of grass are painted green and that the ponds used\nto be dyed blue. Because the azaleas seem always to bloom right on time,\nskeptics have propagated the myth that the club\u2019s horticulturists freeze the\nblossoms, in advance of the tournament, or swap out early bloomers for more\nco\u00f6perative specimens. Pine straw is imported. Pinecones are deported. There\nis a curious absence of fauna. One hardly ever sees a squirrel or a bird. I\u2019d\nbeen told that birdsong\u2014a lot of it, at any rate\u2014is piped in through speakers\nhidden in the greenery. (In 2000, CBS got caught doing some overdubbing of its\nown, after a birder noticed that the trills and chirps on a golf broadcast\nbelonged to non-indigenous species.)\n\nYou hear about this kind of stuff, before your first visit, just as you get\nthe more commonplace spiel that everything is perfect, that the course is even\nmore majestic in real life than it is on TV, and that, in spite of all the\nwalking, you\u2019ll put on five pounds. Pimento-cheese sandwiches, egg-salad\nsandwiches, peach-ice-cream sandwiches, MoonPies, underpriced beer. You are\nurged to adopt the terminology favored by the tournament hosts and embraced by\nCBS. Spectators are \u201cpatrons.\u201d The rough\u2014longer grass that lines the\nfairways\u2014is the \u201csecond cut.\u201d (And it is controversial, because its abundance\ncontravenes the wishes of the patriarchs, who designed the course to have a\ndearth of rough. Gary McCord may have been onto something.) The traps are\nbunkers, and what appears to patrons and television viewers to be the whitest\nsand in golf is technically not sand but waste from feldspar mines in North\nCarolina.\n\nAugusta National is sometimes likened to Oz. For one thing, it\u2019s a Technicolor\nfantasyland embedded in an otherwise ordinary tract of American sprawl.\nWashington Road, the main approach to the club, is a forlorn strip of Waffle\nHouses, pool-supply stores, and cheap-except-during-the-Masters hotels. In the\nHooters parking lot during tournament week, fans line up for selfies with John\nDaly, the dissolute pro and avatar of mid-round cigarettes and booze. But step\nthrough the club\u2019s metal detectors and badge scanners, and you enter a lush,\nhigh-rent realm, where you are not allowed to run, talk loudly, or cheer a\nplayer\u2019s mistakes. Order is maintained by security guards, who for decades\nwere provided by the Pinkerton detective agency. (Though Pinkerton was\nacquired by a Swedish company called Securitas, in 1999, many patrons still\nrefer to the guards as Pinkertons.) In 2012, a fan who stole onto a fairway to\ntake a cup of bunker sand was thrown in jail.\n\nI showed up on a Monday afternoon before the tournament, just as a series of\nstorms swept in, and as the spectators, there to witness the first rounds of\npractice, were being herded off the grounds. Owing to the threat of lightning,\nplay was suspended for the day and the club was closed to visitors. The\nthrongs poured out of the gates into the real world, just as I was leaving it.\nI took refuge in what the club calls the press building, a recently\nconstructed Taj Mahal of media mollycoddling. This columned, ersatz-antebellum\nmegamansion, in operation just ten days a year, has got to be the fanciest\nmedia center in sports. It has state-of-the-art working quarters, radio and\ntelevision studios, locker rooms, a gratis restaurant with made-to-order\nomelettes for breakfast and a bountiful hot lunch, as well as a grab-and-go\ncounter with craft beers, artisanal cheeses and jerkies, and a full array of\nAugusta\u2019s famous sandwiches, each wrapped in green paper.\n\nSuch generosity and care, for the journalists, reflects the role that so many\nof them have played in burnishing the mythology of the Masters; it also\nsuggests an effort to keep them away from the course and the clubhouse. The\npress is provided with every disincentive to venture out. The gang\u2019s all\nthere. Even the bathrooms are capacious, and staffed with attendants. Each\nmember of the media has a work station with a brass nameplate, a leather\nswivel chair, a pair of computer monitors, and a surfeit of real-time\ntournament footage and information\u2014far more data than one would be able to\ngather out on the golf course, especially because, outside the press building,\nreporters are not allowed to carry cell phones. (The phone ban, strictly\nenforced and punishable by immediate removal from the grounds, applies to\npatrons and members, too. One morning during the tournament this year, a story\nwent around that the club had done a spot inspection of staff headquarters and\nfound that an employee had hidden a cell phone between two slices of bread.)\nThe golfers and the tournament officials appear dutifully for press\nconferences; why bother heading out to the clubhouse to hound them for quotes?\nNo phones are allowed at the press conferences, either. The club wants control\nover sounds and pictures\u2014the content. The club can tell who\u2019s who, and who\u2019s\nwhere, by RFID chips affixed to each press badge.\n\nThe working area faced the practice range, which the players had abandoned,\nonce the rain began hammering down. As dusk approached, the rain briefly let\nup, and a battalion of men in baggy white coveralls\u2014the official caddie\ncostume at Augusta\u2014fanned out across the range, to retrieve the hundreds of\nballs that the players had struck there earlier in the day. In the gloaming,\nthese white jumpsuits, moving irregularly amid the deep green of the manicured\ngrounds, brought to mind an avant-garde film about a lunatic asylum: the\ninmates, in their hospital gowns, out for a constitutional.\n\nThe course was still closed the next morning. I caught a ride to the clubhouse\non a golf cart with a member, a so-called green jacket, named John Carr, an\noil magnate from Ireland, who told me that he was on the media committee.\n\nThe members in attendance during the tournament (and at dinner, whenever they\nvisit) are required to wear their green blazers. The club\u2019s founders decreed,\nin the earliest years of the tournament, that any members present had to make\nthemselves available to patrons who might be in need of assistance. The\njackets tell you who the members are. It is an oddity of the place that its\nmembers insist on secrecy\u2014there are some three hundred, but there is no public\nlist, and omert\u00e0 is strictly enforced\u2014and yet here, at the biggest golf\ntournament of the year, they parade about in uniform, wearing name tags: Roger\nGoodell, Sam Nunn, Rex Tillerson.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe jackets themselves never leave the grounds; they hang in the members\u2019\nlockers. Each winner of the Masters gets a green jacket, too, which is\npresented immediately after the victory by the club\u2019s chairman and the\nprevious year\u2019s winner, in an awkward ceremony staged for television in the\nbasement of a house called the Butler Cabin, near the eighteenth hole. The\nsolemnity surrounding this perennial observance suggests the initiation ritual\nof a really square fraternity. Jim Nantz, the longtime host of the CBS\nbroadcast and of the Butler Cabin sacrament, has perfected an air of unctuous\nself-satisfaction that signals even to the casual viewer that there is\nsomething batty about the whole enterprise. The way that Nantz repeats the tag\nline\u2014\u201cA tradition unlike any other\u201d\u2014assumes a sinister, cultish edge. Everyone\nassociated with the club seems to take all this very seriously. On the\nofficial Masters podcast, the host, Marty Smith, said to the celebrity chef\nDavid Chang, as though reciting a prayer, \u201cThe respect for the grounds and the\nreverence for the event permeate us as human beings and we thereby disseminate\nthat same respect to our peers.\u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d Chang replied. \u201cIt almost restores my faith in\nhumanity.\u201d As one long-standing media-badge holder told me, after he\u2019d spent\nten minutes singing the club\u2019s praises on the record, \u201cThese guys are out of\ntheir fucking minds. They think it\u2019s supernatural.\u201d\n\nA friend who used to play at Augusta every year during non-tournament weeks\n(his father was a member) told me that, at dinner in the clubhouse, you could\nsee the power of the green jacket in the body language of the guests, as they\nfawned over their host. Yet there was also a certain gelding effect: \u201cDad was\nnot a humble man, but he was always nervous at Augusta. He didn\u2019t want to\nbreak a rule. The club turned these high-powered men into boys.\u201d\n\nCarr seemed free from such concerns. He led me straight to the clubhouse, into\nthe grill room, where other green jackets were milling about. The clubhouse\ndates back to the eighteen-fifties, though it has been renovated and expanded\nthrough the years; its dimensions are modest, its d\u00e9cor restrained. It sits\natop one of the finest wine cellars in North America. Soon Carr was greeting\nothers, and then he was gone. I did not feel welcome, so I kept going, through\nthe first door I saw, which opened onto a patio that looks out toward the\nfirst tee. The patrons massed and flowed on the other side of a rope line,\nsome thirty yards from the porch; in the space between stood an immense oak,\nits trunk some twenty feet in circumference, its branches cabled up and\nsprawling into a canopy that created a swath of shade. So this was the famous\nTree, the default meeting place and schmoozing ground. The area, though closed\nto the public, bustled with members, managers, agents, journalists, players\npast and present, caddies, and a range of V.I.P.s. \u201cThis is the gathering of\ngolf,\u201d Jerry Tarde, the editor of Golf Digest, here for his fortieth\nconsecutive year, told me. \u201cUnder the Tree, all of golf passes you by.\u201d\n\nBeyond the Tree, out in the sun, the air was thick with moisture baking out of\nthe ground. The course was evidently playable, but the spectators\u2019 paths\nthrough it and along the fairways were slick and shiny with mud. Amid the\nsquelch, you could hear the low roar of the SubAir system. Here and there,\nvents in the ground emitted a rush of warm exhaust. A patron stood astride\none, a little obscenely, drying his pant legs. Where there was pitch, patrons\nin less sensible shoes wiped out in ways that made my ligaments wince.\nDescending the right side of the tenth fairway, while following the practice\nround of a Mexican amateur named \u00c1lvaro Ortiz, a large older man went heels up\nand splashed down in the mud. Nearby, another man\u2014a lawyer, apparently\u2014said to\nhis wife, \u201cI\u2019d file in a heartbeat. Take about twelve minutes to get a\nsettlement.\u201d The mud, or maybe the drying agent, gave off a reek of sewage.\nYears of watching the Masters on television had not prepared me for the smell\nof shit.\n\nBy the following morning, the air had dried out and the grounds sprang into a\nkind of sharp autumnal relief\u2014a pretense of perfection. At the driving range\n(which, like the press center, is new, sprawling, and used pretty much only\nduring the tournament; the members warm up elsewhere), the pros, many with a\ncoach or a manager present, hit balls. Behind them was a wide grandstand, at\nthe rear of which patrons made half-whispered comments, knowing or otherwise,\nabout the array of swings and flight paths. To look from face to face was to\nregard a study in contentment, or even, thanks to the pervasive cigar smoke,\nself-satisfaction. Everyone there, it seemed, knew that this was the place to\nbe; the aura was all the more intense because of the unquenchable desire to\ntake and post look-where-I-am cell-phone photos.\n\nTiger Woods was at the far-right end of the line, in a mint-green shirt and\ngray pants. He had his driver out\u2014the club that hits the ball the farthest,\nthe one you use off the tee. He has had intermittent trouble with it through\nthe years. Errant drives make life difficult. Still, Woods had been playing\nbetter and better since last year\u2019s Masters, after a decade in the weeds with\ninjuries (most notably his back, on which he\u2019d had four surgeries), painkiller\naddiction, the collapse of his marriage, and the subsequent sordid revelations\nof all the philandering that had occasioned it. Some golf writers talked about\nhis career in terms of pre- and post-hydrant, a reference to the night, in\n2009, when his now ex-wife, going through his phone, found out about one of\nhis affairs and chased him out of the house. He fled in his S.U.V. but, zonked\non sleeping pills, immediately crashed into a fire hydrant, whereupon she\nsmashed the back window of the car with a golf club. From there, his life went\noff the rails.\n\nSome commentators thought, or wanted to believe, that Woods could contend at\nthe Masters this year\u2014he\u2019d won four times already\u2014and even a casual know-\nlittle like me couldn\u2019t help noticing that, on the day before the first round,\nhe was roping his drives, one after another, each soaring toward the water\ntower on Washington Road on a clean, almost identical trajectory\u2014a slight\ndraw, right to left, which suits the doglegs of Augusta. Occasionally, after a\ndrive, he wandered ten yards or so out onto the range to fetch his tee. With\nthe others hitting nearby, this looked heedless, like a movie colonel not\nflinching amid a mortar barrage. Utterances of \u201cTiger\u201d popped up out of the\nmurmur of the crowd\u2014hundreds of white people just standing there staring at\nhim.\n\nAfter a while, he went to work on his wedges. The crowd moved with him, while\nsome broke off to line the path he\u2019d be taking from the range to the clubhouse\nand the course. Momentarily averse to such gawkery, I hung back and watched a\ncouple of golfers I\u2019d never heard of; I recognized, not for the first time,\nthat the mechanics and variables of the golf swing are a mystery to me.\n\nStill, it was a soothing place to hang out. I\u2019d been told that the recorded\nbirdsong played on a loop, and so for a few minutes I listened intently, but I\ndidn\u2019t have the ear for it. Earlier, I\u2019d been told by a guard that there was a\nbird speaker in a nearby magnolia tree. Now I followed one chirping sound to a\nholly bush. I eased my head carefully into a gap in the prickly leaves and, to\nmy surprise, scared up an actual bird. Pulling my head out, I saw that I was\nbeing watched closely by a couple of Pinkertons. \u201cA real bird!\u201d I said to\nthem. The Pinkertons remained expressionless.\n\nThe Masters is the only one of the four major tournaments that is staged at\nthe same place every year. The other three\u2014the U.S. Open, the P.G.A.\nChampionship, and the Open Championship (known as the British Open)\u2014are\norganized by various governing bodies and rotate among an evolving roster of\ncourses, some of which are open to the public. The Old Course at St. Andrews,\nin Scotland, the so-called home of golf and an inspiration for the layout at\nAugusta, is a public course. So is Bethpage Black, on Long Island, the site of\ntwo recent U.S. Opens as well as last month\u2019s P.G.A. Championship. The 2019\nU.S. Open, which took place last week, was at Pebble Beach, in California,\nalso a public course.\n\nAugusta is obstinately private. Its leadership, embodied by its chairman, who\nserves for an indefinite term as a kind of sovereign and is the only person\nauthorized to speak about the Masters, invariably deflects questions about\nclub matters by saying that they are club matters. The club operates as a for-\nprofit corporation. No one knows how much money it makes or has\u2014except that\nit\u2019s a lot, judging by the investments the club continually makes in the\ntournament, the course, the physical plant, and the expansion of its real-\nestate holdings. No one, anyway, is pocketing cash. Still, the high profile of\nthe Masters, as an athletic competition and a cultural event, has often made\nAugusta National\u2019s desire to be otherwise left alone seem risible, especially\nin light of the prominence\u2014in business, in politics, in public life\u2014of so many\nof its members. It\u2019s a remarkable, if dodgy, achievement that the club has\nmanaged to maintain the private-public charade for as long as it has.\n\nAugusta National opened in 1932. Its founders were Bobby Jones, the amateur\ngolfing champion, and Clifford Roberts, a Wall Street stockbroker. Jones, an\nAtlantan, and a lawyer, with an English degree from Harvard and an engineering\ndegree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, was, except for Babe Ruth,\nthe era\u2019s most revered sports figure, and is still considered, in the\nprecincts where such mythologies pertain, the quintessence of the humble and\ngraceful gentleman-athlete. As he grew disenchanted by fame and by competitive\ngolf, Jones sought to establish a world-class private club in his home state\u2014a\nwinter course. Roberts, a flinty, fastidious martinet with a hardscrabble\nbackground and a knack for making himself indispensable to powerful men,\nbefriended Jones and took up the cause. In Augusta, they found three hundred\nand sixty-five acres of a defunct commercial nursery called Fruitland, which\nhad been owned and operated by a Belgian family called Berckmans. (The owner\nbefore that was a slaveholder, and some evidence suggests that slaves were\nhoused on the property.) Jones and Roberts hired a British designer named\nAlister MacKenzie to lay out a course, and Roberts set about building a\nmembership. At first, he had a difficult time getting more than a handful of\nmen to join, owing both to the remote location and to the Depression. In the\nfirst decade, the operation was basically broke. The failure to attract\nmembers led Roberts and Jones to abandon grander plans\u2014for squash and tennis\ncourts, a \u201cLadies\u2019 course,\u201d a new clubhouse, and the development of estates\nadjacent to the links.\n\nThe tournament, first held in 1934, was Roberts\u2019s gambit for attracting\nattention, members, and money. He persuaded Jones to come out of retirement to\ncompete in it\u2014an instant lure to fans and players alike\u2014but at first Jones\nwouldn\u2019t agree to calling it the Masters, finding the word too grandiose. A\npivotal development, in the life of both the club and Roberts, was the\nmembership of Dwight Eisenhower, who, at Roberts\u2019s behest, first vacationed\nthere with Mamie in 1948 and was thereafter besotted with the place, despite a\nrickety golf game. Jones\u2019s health was declining, and Roberts adopted\nEisenhower as his (and the club\u2019s) principal means of advancement. Roberts\nserved as Ike\u2019s financial adviser and executor, and, after Roberts helped\narrange his run for President, as his bagman. During his Presidency,\nEisenhower made the club his Mar-a-Lago, visiting twenty-nine times; Roberts\nhad a house built for him on the property. Eisenhower and his son were\nshareholders, along with other members, in a lucrative international Coca-\nCola-bottling venture called Joroberts, run by Roberts and Jones, who were set\nup in the business by the Coca-Cola chairman and early Augusta member Robert\nWinship Woodruff, known as the Boss. Augusta National is still Coke country,\nalthough, in keeping with a Roberts edict of yesteryear, no brand names are\nvisible at the concession stands.\n\nThe golf establishment tends to remember Roberts as a sour figure, a charmless\ntyrant, and a canny sycophant\u2014the bad cop to the faultless Bobby Jones. Given\naccess to the club\u2019s archives, my colleague David Owen, in \u201cThe Making of the\nMasters,\u201d from 1999, painted a more nuanced portrait of Roberts, from his\ndismal, itinerant farm-boy childhood to his death, by self-inflicted gunshot,\non the grounds of Augusta National, in 1977, next to Ike\u2019s Pond, which he\u2019d\nhad built for Eisenhower to fish in. Owen dismisses or, at least, parses some\nof the nastier Roberts legends. But, clearly, the club and the tournament owe\ntheir exacting standards and often peculiar, now widely venerated traditions\nto Roberts\u2019s obsessive attention to detail and stubborn insistence on a\ncertain way of doing things.\n\nBecause of him, the Masters is probably the best-run sporting event in the\nworld. \u201cThey have established the gold standard in terms of the conditioning\nof the golf course,\u201d Brandel Chamblee, the commentator and former pro, told\nme. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to encounter anyone who is curt or rude. I don\u2019t know how you\ncan find fault with this place.\u201d A standard of etiquette, attributed to Jones\nand strictly enforced, is printed on the sheets that patrons carry around,\nwith groupings, tee times, and a course map: \u201c \u2018Most distressing to those who\nlove the game of golf is the applauding or cheering of misplays or misfortunes\nof a player\u2019\u2014Robert Tyre Jones, Jr. (1902-1971), President in Perpetuity.\u201d The\nconcession stands run smoothly, and the prices are famously modest: a buck-\nfifty for a soda or a sandwich, four dollars for a beer. You could say that\nit\u2019s a prelapsarian paradise, a dream of a bygone America of good manners and\naffordable delights. You could also say that this America never really\nexisted, except as a figment of privilege and exclusion, and that the\nconjuring of it, on such a scale, is a kind of provocation.\n\n\u201cI always pick the sweetest ones.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nAs a televised event, the Masters is peerless. You don\u2019t have to be a golf fan\nto enjoy it, or to enjoy napping in front of it. The apparatus for all this\nfootage\u2014the camouflaged camera towers, the buried cables, the hidden\nmicrophones\u2014is hardly noticeable when you\u2019re there. The club maintains tight\ncontrol over the broadcast, and has been awarding one-year contracts to CBS\nsince 1956. The Masters could fetch more on the open market, but Roberts, and\nsubsequent chairmen, have exchanged higher rights fees for control, which, in\nthe end, has enhanced the event\u2019s prestige and ultimately its earning power.\nOriginally, only the final four holes were broadcast. Later, coverage expanded\nto include the \u201csecond nine,\u201d as the back nine is called at Augusta. (Jones\nfelt that \u201cback nine\u201d evoked an image of one\u2019s rear end.) Now the entire\ntournament is televised, and this year an app carried every shot by every\nplayer in the field. Because the players compete on what is more or less the\nsame terrain, year after year, they do so in the context of bygone feats and\nfailures, a folklore of shots made or missed, so that the way each successive\nchampion tackles, say, the par-three twelfth is analogous to the way\ngenerations of folk musicians interpret \u201cLong Black Veil.\u201d\n\nAnd yet they do so in an oligarchs\u2019 playground, rather than in coffee shops.\nAugusta National has more in common with the Bohemian Grove, the exclusive\nmen-only encampment in the California Redwoods, or the World Economic Forum,\nin Davos, than it does with Wimbledon or Fenway Park. From the beginning, even\nthough subscription fees were modest, it was a club for the rich and powerful.\nThe majority of the members, then as now, were from outside the South. In the\nearly days, the Eastern Wasp establishment prevailed. Now it\u2019s the C.E.O.\nclass, which, of course, remains mostly white and male. Many of those C.E.O.s\nare Southerners, and supposedly the Atlanta contingent still holds sway. \u201cThe\nMasters is a Southern institution the way the Vatican is an Italian one,\u201d\nTarde said.\n\nThe chairmanship certainly has some of the pomp of the papacy. The writers\nused to get an audience with the chairman, but now there\u2019s usually just a\npress conference in an auditorium. On Wednesday, the current chairman, Fred\nRidley, a real-estate lawyer from Florida and a former amateur golf champion,\nsubmitted to his, with a few dozen members assembled at the back of the hall,\nlike a convocation of cardinals\u2014all in their green jackets. Ridley was\nonstage, flanked by two committee members. The reporters addressed him as Mr.\nChairman, or Chairman Ridley. He talked for a while\u2014about the recent death of\nthe writer Dan Jenkins, the rainy winter, future construction projects, and\nthe success of the final round of the women\u2019s national amateur championship,\nwhich Augusta had hosted the week before, for the first time\u2014then opened the\nfloor to questions.\n\nThe first came from a reporter right in front of him: \u201cChairman Ridley, when I\nwatch other tournaments on television, I notice lots of cell phones, I notice\nlots of yelling. Will you please talk about the decorum in place at Augusta\nNational that sets the Masters apart?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that does set us apart.\u201d\n\nSo it was that kind of a press conference. Only one question, occasioned by\nthe women\u2019s championship, came in with a little bite: \u201cIn hindsight, was it a\nmistake to be so restrictive for so long?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can always look back and say we could do better,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s particularly\u2014well, it is instructive. It\u2019s always instructive to\nlook at the past.\u201d\n\nThe history of the club, like that of so many institutions in the Deep\nSouth/United States/world, is fraught with backwardness and bigotry. Charles\nSifford, a prominent black golfer in the sixties, once quoted Roberts as\nsaying, \u201cAs long as I live, there will be nothing at the Masters besides black\ncaddies and white players.\u201d No one has been able to corroborate this\nstatement, but it does describe the state of things there for decades. (Owen,\nfor what it\u2019s worth, unearthed examples of Roberts expressing his hope that\nblack golfers would soon qualify for the tournament.) It wasn\u2019t until 1975\nthat a black player, Lee Elder, made the field, and only in 1990 did Augusta\ninvite its first black member, Ron Townsend, an executive at the Gannett\nTelevision Group, to join. (One does not apply for membership; the invitation\njust comes when it comes, though there are back channels for communicating a\ndesire to be considered.) Among its early members were Jock Whitney, who\nfinanced \u201cGone with the Wind,\u201d and Freeman Gosden, best known for performing,\nin black-voice, on the radio program \u201cAmos \u2019n\u2019 Andy.\u201d\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be entirely accurate to chalk this up merely to geography. The\ngame of golf has its own ugly history with regard to African-Americans; the\nProfessional Golf Association, which governs touring golfers in the United\nStates, had a whites-only rule until 1961. There are plenty of private clubs\nin the Northeast, for example, that have fewer black or Jewish members than\nAugusta National does, and there are still a handful of prestigious clubs that\ndo not accept women\u2014but those clubs do not put on the world\u2019s most prestigious\nprofessional tournament.\n\nThis was the core of the argument made by Martha Burk, the head of the\nNational Council of Women\u2019s Organizations, in her campaign, prior to the 2003\nMasters, to pressure the club\u2019s chairman at the time, a South Carolina banker\nnamed Hootie Johnson, to accept women as members. Johnson, insisting on the\nclub\u2019s right to privacy and self-governance, and citing such single-sex\norganizations as the Boy Scouts and the Junior League, dug in, as did the\nmedia, most notably the Times, which made Augusta National an A1 staple. In an\neditorial, \u201cAmerica\u2019s All-Male Golfing Society,\u201d the Times urged Tiger Woods,\nwho had won the previous two Masters, to boycott. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, because\nI\u2019m the only player they\u2019re asking,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThey\u2019re asking me to give up\nan opportunity no one ever has\u2014win the Masters three years in a row.\u201d\n\nOne finds now, in the back and forth of this saga, foreshadowings of the\ncancel-culture wars of today. As Alan Shipnuck recounts, in \u201cThe Battle for\nAugusta National: Hootie, Martha, and the Masters of the Universe,\u201d published\nin 2004, the club hired a Washington consulting company, WomanTrend, run by\nKellyanne Conway, which produced a survey whose finding was that Augusta\nNational\u2019s membership policies were not topmost on the list of women\u2019s\nconcerns. Burk\u2014reasonably, once you see the questions\u2014derided it as a \u201cpush\npoll\u201d and \u201chighly unethical.\u201d Two days later, Jesse Jackson entered the fray:\n\u201cWe strongly support the movement to end gender apartheid at Augusta National\nGolf Club.\u201d In the end, Woods, too, came out in favor of admitting women. In a\npress conference, Johnson replied, \u201cI won\u2019t tell Tiger how to play golf if he\ndoesn\u2019t tell us how to run our private club.\u201d\n\nEventually\u2014and somewhat amazingly, looking back from the reputation-strewn\nbattlefields of 2019\u2014it all just sort of went away. To let its sponsors off\nthe hook, the club announced that it would stage the 2003 Masters by itself,\nwithout them\u2014opting, once again, for control over short-term profit. And then,\nnine years later, the first two women were admitted: Condoleezza Rice, the\nformer Secretary of State, and Darla Moore, a financier from South Carolina.\n\nAround midnight on the eve of the first round, while killing cockroaches in my\nroom at the Rodeway Inn, I got a text message from an acquaintance who works\nin finance. A client of his had cancelled at the last minute, which left him\nwith a spare pass to Berckmans Place. He offered it to me.\n\nBerckmans is the Oz within Oz, a lavish dining-shopping-and-drinking complex\naccessible only to those who have been approved by the club to buy passes, at\na cost of ten thousand dollars for the tournament. The club built Berckmans\nseven years ago, behind a wall of greenery southwest of the fifth fairway, to\ngive favored patrons and corporate friends a sumptuous refuge from the\nelements and the throngs, and presumably to capture some of the revenue it had\nbeen ceding to off-campus entertainments.\n\nThe Masters may be America\u2019s top corporate-hospitality event; because it\u2019s a\ngolf tournament, it attracts a clubbier cohort than the Super Bowl or the\nFinal Four, and because the competition lasts four days rather than two\nminutes, like the Kentucky Derby, it can please more of them. Kenny Dichter, a\nfounder of the jet-lease company Wheels Up, called the tournament \u201cCoachella\nfor C.E.O.s.\u201d \u201cThis is where we entertain our premium-experience guests,\u201d\nAndrew Chason, an executive at Creative Artists Agency, told me. \u201cThe\nprestige, the privacy, the beauty of the grounds, the traditions, the quality\nof the production\u2014it can\u2019t be beat.\u201d\n\nWheels down: out pour the premium-experience guests. A certain kind of\nInstagram feed fills up with photographs of rich people, famous people, lucky\npeople, flashing the Gulfstream grin. The catch is that the hotels,\nrestaurants, and caterers of the city of Augusta (known to many Georgians,\nhowever unfairly, as \u201cDisgusta\u201d and to Roberts as a \u201clittle tank town\u201d) aren\u2019t\nreally up to the task of taking care of all these people, in the manner they\nmay be expecting. And so a luxury pop-up culture has sprung up outside the\ngates. Augusta homeowners cover their annual mortgage payments and landscaping\nbills by renting their houses to the out-of-towners, who, in turn, host\nclients and friends for spectation by day and dinners and other festivities by\nnight. Celebrity chefs are flown in. Even the journalists get in on it. The\npress building\u2019s bigger names often have a full slate of paid appearances,\nentertaining diners with pro-level patter and off-the-record scuttlebutt. This\npractice may explain why journalists are so deferential to the tournament\u2014it\u2019s\ntheir meal ticket, too. C.A.A., which represents a number of top golfers,\nproduces a dinner series; this year\u2019s, managed by Danny Meyer, featured nine\nchefs and a sommelier and staff, for a group of just thirty people. Mercedes\nand the other two domestic tournament sponsors, I.B.M. and A.T. & T., are\nprovided with so-called cabins (which could as easily be called mansions) on\nclub property, down by the tenth fairway. Various fixers and event planners\nput together elaborate itineraries, which sometimes include a round of golf at\na nearby club, such as Sage Valley, across the South Carolina border\u2014a highly\nregarded Augusta National clone, founded in 2001 by a real-estate magnate who\nhad given up on being invited to join the real thing.\n\nLink copied\n\nA Berckmans badge might be part of the program. Just after sunrise, I arrived\nat the acquaintance\u2019s rental house, not far from the club, and boarded a van\nwith some of his clients, the executives of a large entertainment company. Not\nlong afterward, the van pulled up to a pavilion, where a dozen or so\nattendants stood smiling and waving to us. \u201cWelcome to Berckmans!\u201d a security\nguard called out. \u201cBird songs too loud? I can turn them down for you.\u201d Signs\nindicated that phones and photography were prohibited inside.\n\nAt the metal detectors, two men behind me, whose golf shirts identified them\nas employees of a prominent private-equity firm, asked if I\u2019d carry an extra\nfolding chair of theirs through security. Everyone is allowed one chair.\nPresumably, these two were carrying additional ones for their superiors, or\nelse\u2014could it be?\u2014angling for an unfair advantage. As soon as the grounds open\neach morning, chair holders\u2014first members and their guests, then the general\npublic\u2014fan out across the course and secure their viewing spots; you leave a\nchair behind, usually with a name tag or a business card affixed to it, then\nwander around in the expectation that it will be vacant, or immediately\nvacated, when you come to claim it. Sometimes the chairs stay empty, like\nbarely used country houses.\n\nBerckmans operates for just one week of the year. This is astonishing to\ncontemplate: it\u2019s a small indoor village, reportedly ninety thousand square\nfeet. There are shrines to various touchstones of Augusta National lore and a\nvast, immaculate store that sells Masters merchandise, one of several on the\ngrounds. Sweaters, hats, shirts, jewelry, club covers, platters, pens. You can\nbuy official merch only on site; Augusta National sells nothing online or\noutside the gates. You might guess that this restriction would cut into sales,\nbut scarcity fuels desire, or so it appears, judging by the queues at the\nshops and by the patrons lugging around clear-plastic shopping bags stuffed\nwith purchases for the people back home. The club doesn\u2019t share sales\nfigures\u2014it doesn\u2019t even reveal how many tickets are sold\u2014but a popular\nestimate is that it moves fifty million dollars of merchandise in that one\nweek.\n\nIn some ways, Berckmans is just a food court, but exclusivity can be mind-\naltering. A badge holder pays for nothing. People who can afford a meal at any\nrestaurant in the world derive a thrill from dining without being handed a\ncheck. There are five restaurants: Ike\u2019s; Calamity Jane\u2019s, named for Bobby\nJones\u2019s putter; MacKenzie\u2019s Pub, for the course architect; the Pavilion,\noutside; and Augusta\u2019s, a sprawling Art Nouveau palm-frond-and-tin-ceiling\nseafood emporium, where you can get raw oysters, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, and bananas Foster.\nFor breakfast, our host chose Ike\u2019s. There were hooks under the table on which\nto hang our ball caps. \u201cThe little things,\u201d he said. A TV on the wall carried\na live feed of Jim Nantz, off air but on site, having his hair strategically\nrestructured. At the buffet, we heaped our plates with biscuits, grits, eggs,\nFrench toast, and candied peaches. I thought guiltily of my colleagues at the\npress center, having to make do with omelettes and no hooks for their hats. As\nI hid in a john to jot down a few notes, I noticed that the restroom\nattendants cleaned the stalls after each patron\u2019s use. (Later, I overheard a\nman talking to his wife on a courtesy phone: \u201cGuess what: every time you go,\nthere\u2019s a guy who runs in and cleans the toilet.\u201d)\n\nBerckmans guests occasionally find themselves staying all day: oysters, Bloody\nMarys, air-conditioning, golf on TV. Why bother going out to watch the\ndisjointed, partial, live version? The clincher, for many, is the Putting\nExperience, along the northeast side of Berckmans\u2014replicas of the seventh,\nfourteenth, and sixteenth greens, with Augusta National caddies on hand, in\ntheir coveralls, to help the civilians manage what, up close, look like\npreposterously hilly putts. After breakfast, there was a queue of people\nwaiting their turn to test the greens. Condoleezza Rice, in green jacket and\ntan slacks, was there to greet them one by one. (The man on the courtesy\nphone: \u201cA former Secretary of State out there saying hi to everybody? Honey,\nit\u2019s crazy!\u201d)\n\nDepending on your area of interest or expertise, you might recognize prominent\ncitizens in golf-fan disguise. A patron who knew his hockey Hall of Famers,\nfor example, could introduce himself to Chris Chelios and Lanny McDonald. One\nwho knew his media magnates might note that Fred Ridley was having lunch with\nBrian Roberts, the chairman of Comcast and the head of the club\u2019s digital-\ntechnology committee.\n\nOne Berckmans badge holder I didn\u2019t recognize but whom a younger patron\npointed out later, by the sixth green, was a thirty-one-year-old social-media\npersonality named Bob Menery, who has made a name for himself by posting\nprofane mock-narrations of sports highlights, in a dead-on sportscaster\u2019s\nvoice. Towering over him was his girlfriend, Katie Kearney, a swimsuit model\nand former Miss Missouri. Menery and Kearney had been invited to the Masters\nby a Lebanese businessman named Ahmed Tayeb. There were dinners (one hosted by\na Saudi golf magnate, another with Ireland\u2019s fifth-richest man); parties (at\nC.A.A.\u2019s, Menery had a rough go of it after mistakenly eating a housemate\u2019s\npot gummy); a round at Sage Valley (Menery shot his best-ever score, a\nseventy-five); and multiple late-night sessions at Hooters. As I chatted with\nMenery and Kearney, we were joined by their friend Jena Sims, an actress and\nformer Miss Teenage Georgia, and the girlfriend of Brooks Koepka, the No. 1\ngolfer in the world, who had recently lost twenty pounds in advance of an\nappearance with her in the Body Issue of ESPN the Magazine. Menery and Koepka\nliked to kid around with each other about their attractive girlfriends. When\nMenery, outside the ropes, heckled Koepka about this during an early round at\nthe Masters, Koepka laughed, but Menery got the Pinkerton glare. \u201cYou don\u2019t\nfuck around here,\u201d he told me. Last year, Menery posted a video on Instagram\nin which he crank-called the club pretending to be Bill Gates (who is a\nmember), ludicrously demanding a tee time in the midst of the tournament. Now\nhe was hoping that no one remembered this stunt; he was having too good a\ntime, making too many connections, and, like nearly everyone at Augusta,\nsorely hoping to be invited back. On Sunday, he watched the final round on the\nflatscreens at Berckmans, leaving vacant the folding chairs that a runner had\nplaced for him and his housemates by the eighteenth green early that morning.\n\nRight outside Berckmans, you slip into the flow of regular patrons, a river of\nwell-to-do white people in golf clothes. But what had previously appeared to\nbe the most homogeneous crowd I\u2019d ever seen suddenly seemed to contain some\nintriguing variety, relative to the clientele at Berckmans. The frat boys and\nyoung jocks, with stacks of empty beer cups (the cups are collector\u2019s items);\nthe slightly dotty elderly golf fanatics, with their binoculars and old\nMasters badges and long-standing viewing spots at the sixteenth hole; the\nsunburned Brits on boys\u2019 trips, smoking 100s in the shade. Still, you see a\nlot of khaki shorts, ankle socks, and golf shirts. Sometimes you can tell\npeople apart only by the corporate logos on their left breast: Hitachi\nChemical, Mercy Care, Strategic Wealth Specialists, Newton Center\nChiropractic, South Bay Construction, Arborguard, True Temper, Twisted Dune,\nThe Citadel. Everyone had the look of someone who was used to telling other\npeople what to do.\n\nHere and there, I struck up amiable conversations with well-mannered men from\nall over the country. A carnival concessionaire from Austin. An art-frame\nconservator from New Haven. A white-water kayaker from the Smokies. I\neavesdropped on greetings and farewells:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, General?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood to see you, Bud.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys be safe.\u201d\n\nTim Jones, a senior project manager at a steel company in Louisville, told me,\n\u201cNever been anywhere like this, where everything\u2019s A1, from the hand towels in\nthe bathrooms to the grass. I called my son. I told him, \u2018This isn\u2019t a golf\ntournament. It\u2019s a cultural event where the Southern United States has its\nchest stuck out and is saying come down and visit.\u2019 It\u2019s been a hundred and\nfifty-five years since the Civil War, and yet we want to let people know we\u2019re\na strong people, a hardworking people, a proud people.\u201d\n\nA guy named Rick Foor, from Fort Mill, South Carolina, on hearing that I was\nfrom New York, asked, \u201cAre you left of Trump?\u201d He let me know that he was\nbusting my chops. \u201cSo, but seriously, what\u2019s the deal with A.O.C.?\u201d\n\nI had another conversation about Ocasio-Cortez, and the perils of single-payer\nhealth insurance, with a large-bodied fund manager from New York. We met at a\nconcession stand as we were both reaching greedily into a freezer for peach-\nice-cream sandwiches, the last two in stock. (An old Augusta hand had given me\nsome advice: \u201cFollow the fattest fucker you see and he\u2019ll lead you to the\npeach-ice-cream sandwiches.\u201d) After a couple of bites, the trader threw his\nout. \u201cIt\u2019s too mushy,\u201d he said. \u201cYesterday I had one, and it was the best\nthing I ever had.\u201d (Another pro tip: remove the cutlet from a chicken\nsandwich, put it in a pimento-cheese sandwich, then, before eating the new\nsandwich, carry it in your pocket for a few holes.)\n\nAt one point, a young man told me, \u201cMy uncle dropped dead last year on eleven.\nThis is the one-year anniversary of his death.\u201d Then the uncle introduced\nhimself. Johnny Pruitt, age fifty-four, from Bluffton, South Carolina. He\u2019d\ngone into cardiac arrest in the gallery and was out for twenty-five minutes\nbefore paramedics revived him. The family were gathered here to celebrate his\nresurrection. \u201cI bow down at Amen Corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI had goosebumps coming\nthrough the gate this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nAmen Corner, so named by Herbert Warren Wind, is the crux of the course,\ncomprising, strictly speaking, the eleventh green, the twelfth hole, and the\ntee shot at thirteen. A stand of pines juts into the course here and provides\na sociable vantage over hallowed ground and consequential golf. On Friday\nafternoon, fans watched balls arrive suddenly from the left and land on or\nnear the eleventh green. Then came the players. The scoreboard\u2014updated by men\nstanding behind it using placards featuring each competitor\u2019s name\u2014would tell\nyou whom to expect, if you didn\u2019t have the grouping sheet. No matter where you\nwere, Tiger Woods approached as if on a rising tide, behind the leading edge\nof the throng that was following his round. Agents from the Georgia Bureau of\nInvestigation preceded him, and then, as shouts of \u201cTiger!\u201d rippled out ahead,\nthe man himself came striding along, with his familiar air of purpose and\nannoyance. He was in the second-to-last group and near the top of the leader\nboard, and a buzz was starting to build that he might in fact be in the\nrunning.\n\nTo great fanfare, he birdied eleven and walked toward the grandstand, and the\ntwelfth tee. Twelve is a famous, picturesque par three, Augusta\u2019s Matterhorn.\nTo land a ball on the green, you have to hit it over a creek and short of an\nembankment of azaleas. Great players have come to grief here. Woods, though,\nhit his tee shot to within a half-dozen feet of the flag. Pandemonium. And\nthen, from seemingly everywhere, came the sound of a siren. There was\nlightning in the area, and everyone had to evacuate the course. The crowd\ngroaned. Puttus interruptus. Woods rushed across the bridge to the green,\nmarked his ball, and disappeared offstage, behind the azaleas, as the\nmultitudes emptied out of the grandstand and the glades of Amen Corner and\nstreamed back toward the exits\u2014there was no place on the grounds for them to\ntake shelter, in the event of a storm, unless they had passes to Berckmans.\nThe sky darkened.\n\nA few patrons lingered among the pines. \u201cI\u2019m staying here till they make me\nleave,\u201d one man said. He smoked a cigarette and admired the vivid slaty light.\nAfter half an hour, far off, a cheer went up, and suddenly the crowds were\nreturning, some people at a run, to reclaim choice spots in the pines. The\natmosphere had got rowdy, strangers striking up conversations like old\nfriends.\n\nA start horn rang out. Woods was waiting by the twelfth green, where he was\nsoon joined by his partners. But after a long delay he missed his birdie putt.\nSoon a heavy rain arrived, and the SubAir system kicked in.\n\nOn Sunday, a threat of afternoon storms, possibly even of tornadoes, prompted\nthe club to make the unprecedented and therefore surely agonizing decision to\nmove the start times to early morning, and to send the groups out in\nthreesomes, rather than the usual pairs. Woods lucked into the final group, a\ntactical advantage.\n\nThe patrons in the galleries had a range of rooting interests. Some cheered\nfor Rickie Fowler, who is widely acknowledged to be the American contingent\u2019s\nleading young mensch, or for Phil Mickelson, whom many writers privately\ndescribed as its reigning jerk. I stood next to an executive from Adidas and\nhis fianc\u00e9e, whose interests were best represented by the rising star\u2014and\nAdidas athlete\u2014Xander Schauffele. Go, Xander! A South African contingent went\nberserk for Louis Oosthuizen. But the contender who inspired the roars was\nWoods.\n\nEarly that morning, in the press building, I was flipping through a recent\nbiography of Woods, by Armen Keteyian and Jeff Benedict. Skipping, as one\nwill, to the dirty bits, I alighted on a section describing his serial\ninfidelities of a decade ago, and some text messages he\u2019d sent to a porn star\nnamed Joslyn James, the first of which read, \u201cHold you down while i choke you\nand Fuck that ass that i own.\u201d The rest were worse. This was the man whom\neveryone was roaring for. There was something Trumpean about it all\u2014a\nsuggestion not of redemption and forgiveness but of indulgence, or abandon.\n\nIt can seem weird how enthusiastically the golf world roots for Woods, even\nthough so many of its citizens, especially the ones closest to the tour,\naren\u2019t especially fond of him. People like to witness greatness, maybe, or to\npartake of excitement. He\u2019s good for business, people said. One golf executive\ntold me, \u201cIt\u2019s easier for everybody when Tiger is winning.\u201d This, too, seemed\nTrump-y: forbearance, in the name of lucre. It\u2019s perhaps worth noting that\nWoods and Trump, who is closing in on two hundred rounds as President, have\nbeen both playing and business partners; Woods is designing a course for\nTrump\u2019s property in Dubai.\n\nIn 1996, a year before the first of Woods\u2019s Masters triumphs, his father, Earl\nWoods, told Sports Illustrated, \u201cTiger will do more than any other man in\nhistory to change the course of humanity,\u201d including Mandela, Gandhi, and the\nBuddha. He referred to Woods as \u201cthe Chosen One.\u201d It was soon clear that the\nson\u2019s ambitions didn\u2019t align with the father\u2019s. One can argue, and many have,\nthat no man is duty-bound to lead the struggle, or that merely by dominating a\nmostly white field, often in places that have historically been closed to\npeople of color, Woods is doing more than his share to advance the cause. It\u2019s\nalways been hard to parse the extent to which his popularity is a function of\nhis being a pioneer, as a black man in a white world, or of his reticence\nabout this.\n\nNow, two months after the Masters, as Woods and most of the rest of the field\nhave teed it up at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, we know that the people got\nwhat they wanted. We may even remember what happened on Sunday. On the twelfth\nhole, the steady Italian Francesco Molinari, ahead of Woods by two strokes,\nhit his tee shot into the creek. The patrons, now more like a mob, avidly\ncheered his mistake, in violation of Bobby Jones\u2019s rules of comportment. In\nthe CBS control room, a producer exclaimed, \u201cGame on!\u201d And then Woods lofted\nhis tee shot safely onto the fat part of the green, made par, and walked onto\nthe next tee box in a tie for the lead. This time, there was no siren, no\nlightning. Overhead, the private jets were coming in low, presumably to fetch\nthe premium-experience guests. As Woods made his way down the thirteenth\nfairway, Amen Corner emptied out for the last time, the crowds following him,\nshouting his name.\n\nAlmost two hours later, Woods sealed the victory with a bogey on eighteen,\nthen made his way to Butler Cabin, to retrieve his green jacket. In a sitting\nroom inside the clubhouse, his mother, his children, and his girlfriend had\nassembled to watch the ceremony on TV. Pinkertons guarded the door. In the\ngrill room, a semicircle of members, still wearing their own green jackets,\nstood rapt before a flatscreen in the corner. They applauded when Woods\nslipped his arms into the jacket\u2014the same one he\u2019d won in 1997. He\u2019d get to\ntake it off the premises for another year.\n\nIn the parking lot, a group of reporters interviewed Woods\u2019s caddie, Joe\nLaCava, who was leaning against the back of a courtesy Mercedes S.U.V. \u201cI\u2019m\nhappy he won today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might\u2019ve bought me a couple more months.\u201d\nFans and commentators spoke of Tiger\u2019s miraculous comeback. Mostly, in their\ntelling, and certainly in his, what he\u2019d come back from was debilitating back\npain and other injuries, rather than the collapse of his marriage, his public\nimage, or his emotional well-being. But it was all there, as subtext. Knowing\nwhat we do about America\u2019s capacity for forgiveness, or for willful\nforgetting, we can maybe allow, with some ruefulness, that the restoration of\nhis body was more astonishing, after all. A few weeks later, at the White\nHouse, Trump draped the Presidential Medal of Freedom around Woods\u2019s neck. The\nribbon got twisted, and no one thought to straighten it out. \u2666\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described the Professional Golf\nAssociation, which governs only touring golfers in the United States.\n\nPublished in the print edition of the June 24, 2019, issue, with the headline\n\u201cUnlike Any Other.\u201d\n\nNick Paumgarten has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 2005.\n\nMore:Masters Golf TournamentAugusta National Golf ClubTiger WoodsSportsGolf\n\n### Weekly\n\nEnjoy our flagship newsletter as a digest delivered once a week.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nThe Woman Who Invented Augusta National\n\nIn the late nineteen-twenties, Marion Hollins created a golf club in\nCalifornia that would serve as an initial blueprint for the home of the\nMasters.\n\nBy David Owen\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nRip Van Golfer\n\nBy John McPhee\n\nHot Dog Dept.\n\nThe Lou Gehrig of Beer Guys\n\nReggie Duvalsaint, who is seeking to become the first seat vender to work at\nall sixty M.L.B. and N.F.L. stadiums, explains why he quit banking for\nhawking.\n\nBy Adam Elder\n\nLetter from Los Angeles\n\nIt\u2019s Shohei Ohtani Season in L.A.\n\nEven before the startling accusations made against Ohtani\u2019s interpreter, the\nDodgers star was seemingly at the center of civic life.\n\nBy Emily Witt\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
