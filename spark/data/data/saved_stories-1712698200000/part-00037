For other uses, see Back room\n(disambiguation).\n\nA typical depiction of the Backrooms, digitally rendered\n\nThe Backrooms are a fictional location first mentioned on a 2019 4chan thread.\nThey are commonly depicted as an impossibly large extradimensional space, an\nexpanse of empty rooms accessed by \"no-clipping\" (phasing) out of known\nreality in certain areas. Many stories have monsters and supernatural entities\ninhabiting the Backrooms.\n\nAn online community has emerged around Backrooms stories. In early 2022, Kane\nParsons started a series of Backrooms short films on YouTube, which went viral\nand led to him directing an upcoming A24 film based on it. The videos have\nbeen credited with igniting a surge in Backrooms content and lifting it from\nobscurity. The Backrooms have been categorized as an Internet meme,\ncreepypasta, or collaborative fiction, because many unaffiliated internet\nusers have created and shared stories, short films, and video games based on\nthem. There has been both popular and academic analysis of the Backrooms as\nexistential horror and a liminal space, as well as its gamified influences.\n\n## History\n\n### Original creepypasta\n\nOn May 12, 2019, an anonymous user started a thread on /x/, 4chan's\nparanormal-themed board, asking users to \"post disquieting images that just\nfeel 'off'\".^[1]^[2] One of the posts was the original photo of the Backrooms:\na picture of a large carpeted, open room with yellow wallpaper and fluorescent\nlighting on a Dutch angle.^[3] It is not known where the photo was taken,^[4]\nbut it appeared in an earlier thread on April 21, 2018.^[5]\n\nAnother user replied to this post with the first description of the\nBackrooms:^[4]\n\n> If you're not careful and you noclip^[a] out of reality in the wrong areas,\n> you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old\n> moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of\n> fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred\n> million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in God\n> save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as\n> hell has heard you\n>\n> \u2014 Anonymous, 4chan (May 13, 2019)^[1]\n\n### Growth and fandom\n\nSome stories about the Backrooms include malevolent creatures.\n\nDays after the original creepypasta,^[5] users began to share stories about\nthe Backrooms on subreddits such as r/creepypasta and later r/backrooms.^[2] A\nfandom began to develop around the Backrooms and creators expanded upon the\noriginal iteration of the creepypasta by creating additional floors or\n\"levels\" and entities which populate them.^[4]^[6] Happy Mag noted in\nparticular two other levels: Level 1, a level with industrial architecture,\nand Level 2, a darkly lit level with long service tunnels, with the original\nversion named Level 0.^[6]\n\nAs new levels were devised in r/backrooms, a faction of fans who preferred the\noriginal Backrooms split off from the fandom. A Reddit user named Litbeep\ncreated another subreddit called r/TrueBackrooms focusing only on the original\nversion. ABC News said that unlike fandoms surrounding existing properties,\nthe lack of a canonical Backrooms made \"drawing a line between authentic\nstorytelling and jokes\" difficult.^[2]^[4] By March 2022, r/backrooms had over\n157,000 members.^[2]\n\nThe fandom steadily expanded onto other platforms with the upload of videos on\nTwitter and TikTok.^[5] Wikis hosted on Fandom and Wikidot dedicated to the\nBackrooms lore were established.^[7] Dan Erickson, creator of the television\nseries Severance (2022), named the Backrooms as one of his many influences\nwhile working on the series.^[8]\n\n## Reception\n\nThe Backrooms have been associated with an internet aesthetic known as liminal\nspaces, which include \"images of eerie and uninhabited spaces\", such as the\nabove empty hallway.^[9]\n\nSome sources believe the Backrooms to have been the origin of the internet\naesthetic of liminal spaces,^[5] which depict usually busy locations as\nunnaturally empty. The #liminalspaces hashtag has amassed nearly 100 million\nviews on TikTok.^[9]^[10] Paste's Phoenix Simms wrote that the Backrooms and\ngames such as The Stanley Parable, which is claimed to reference it, is \"tied\nto a long tradition of the liminal in horror\" and the color yellow as a symbol\nof caution, deterioration, and existential distress. The Stanley Parable\ndepicts a more absurdist and light-hearted but still subtly disconcerting take\non the latter. The Backrooms' is \"a fungal, sickly yellow\", where both the\nperson and the mind can lose themselves in.^[11]\n\nPC Gamer compared the Backrooms' various levels to H. P. Lovecraft's R'lyeh\nand The City in the manga Blame!, describing it as \"an uncanny valley of\nplace\".^[12] ABC News and Le Monde grouped the Backrooms into an \"emerging\ngenre of collaborative online horror\" which also includes the SCP\nFoundation.^[4]^[7] Kotaku said that this collaborative aspect, as well as the\nlack of overt horror or threat, made the Backrooms stand out from other\ncreepypastas.^[5] Both Kotaku and Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies\nat Curtin University, felt that the Backrooms was scary \"because [it invites]\nyou to interpret what's not shown\". While Leaver believed that the \"eerie\nfeeling of familiarity\" helped draw fans together, Kotaku said that the horror\nwas in part derived from the subtle \"wrongness\" present in liminal\nspaces.^[2]^[5]\n\nA TikTok trend of videos that zoom in on Google Earth to reveal an entrance to\nthe Backrooms have grown popular.^[12]^[13]\n\n## Adaptations\n\n### YouTube\n\nMain article: Backrooms (web series)\n\nIn January 2022, a short horror film titled \"The Backrooms (Found Footage)\"\nwas uploaded to YouTube. Created by then-16-year-old Kane Parsons of Northern\nCalifornia, known online as Kane Pixels, it is presented as a VHS tape\nrecorded by a filmmaker who accidentally enters the Backrooms in the 1990s and\nis pursued by a monster.^[14]^[15] Parsons used the software Blender and Adobe\nAfter Effects to create the environment of the Backrooms, and it took him a\nmonth to complete it. He described the Backrooms as a manifestation of a\npoorly remembered recollection of the late 90s and early 2000s.^[2]^[4] The\nvideo has over 57 million views as of March 2024^[update].^[16]^[17]\n\nThe short was praised by the fandom^[16] and received positive reviews from\ncritics. WPST called it \"the scariest video on the Internet\".^[18] Otaku USA\ncategorized it as analog horror,^[19] while Dread Central and Nerdist compared\nit favorably to the 2019 video game Control.^[20]^[21] Kotaku praised the\nseries for exercising restraint in its horror and mystery.^[5] Boing Boing's\nRob Beschizza predicted that the Backrooms, like the creepypasta Slender Man\nand its panned 2018 film adaptation, would eventually be adapted into a \"slick\nbut dismal 2-hour Hollywood movie.\"^[22]\n\nExpanding his videos into a series of sixteen shorts,^[23] Parsons introduced\nplot aspects such as Async, an organization which opened a portal into the\nBackrooms in the 1980s and conducted research within it.^[4]^[5] The series\nhas collectively garnered over 100 million views.^[24] It is also credited\nwith lifting the Backrooms from obscurity into the mainstream internet and\ncausing a surge in Backrooms content,^[5]^[12] particularly on YouTube.^[25]\nFor his shorts, Parsons received a Creator Honors at the 2022 Streamy Awards\nfrom The Game Theorists.^[26]\n\n### Film adaptation\n\nOn February 6, 2023, A24 announced that they are working on a film adaptation\nof the Backrooms based on Parsons' videos, with Parsons directing. Roberto\nPatino is set to write the screenplay, while James Wan, Michael Clear from\nAtomic Monster, Shawn Levy, Dan Cohen, and Dan Levine of 21 Laps are set to\nproduce.^[14]^[23]\n\n### Video games\n\nThe Backrooms have been adapted into numerous video games, including on the\nplatforms Steam and Roblox.^[12]^[16]^[27] An indie game was released by Pie\non a Plate Productions two months after the original creepypasta,^[28] and was\npositively reviewed for its atmosphere but received criticism for its short\nlength.^[3]^[29]^[30] Many others, such as Enter the Backrooms, Noclipped and\nThe Backrooms Project, were released in the following years.^[27] Co-op\nmultiplayer Escape the Backrooms by Fancy Games was praised by Bloody\nDisgusting for its depiction of the extended lore,^[23]^[31] while The\nBackrooms 1998 (both 2022), a psychological survival horror game independently\nreleased by one-person developer Steelkrill Studio, was noted by reviewers for\nits found footage visuals and limited save system.^[32]^[33]\n\n## See also\n\n  * Labyrinth\n  * List of creepypastas\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. ^ No clipping is a video game term for commands which allow the player to go through solid walls and objects.^[6]\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"unsettling images\". 4chan (4plebs).
