In the best-case scenarios for these unfortunate\nevents, it's a small, benign object that safely sees itself out in a day or\ntwo. But in the worst-case scenarios, it can go down an entirely different\npath.\n\nThat was the case for a poor teen in California, who somehow swallowed a\nquarter. The quarter didn\u2019t head down the esophagus and toward the stomach,\nbut veered into the airway, sliding past the vocal cords like they were a\nvending-machine coin slot.\n\nEnlarge / Radiographs of the chest (Panel A, postero- anterior view) and neck\n(Panel B, lateral view). Removal with optical forceps (Panel C and Video 1),\nand reinspection of ulceration (Panel D, asterisks)\n\nNEJM, Hsue and Patel, 2024\n\nIn a clinical report published recently in the New England Journal of\nMedicine, doctors who treated the 14-year-old boy reported how they found\u2014and\nlater retrieved\u2014the quarter from its unusual and dangerous resting place. Once\nit passed the vocal cords and the glottis, the coin got lodged in the\nsubglottis, a small region between the vocal cords and the trachea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuckily, when the boy arrived at the emergency department, his main symptoms\nwere hoarseness and difficulty swallowing. He was surprisingly breathing\ncomfortably and without drooling, they noted. But imaging quickly revealed the\ndanger his airway was in when the vertical coin lit up his scans.\n\n\"Airway foreign bodies\u2014especially those in the trachea and larynx\u2014necessitate\nimmediate removal to reduce the risk of respiratory compromise,\" they wrote in\nthe NEJM report.\n\nThe teen was given general anesthetic while doctors used long, optical\nforceps, guided by a camera, to pluck the coin from its snug spot. After\ngrabbing the coin, they re-inspected the boy's airway noting ulcerations on\neach side matching the coin's ribbed edge.\n\nAfter the coin's retrieval, the boy's symptoms improved and he was discharged\nhome, the doctors reported.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n84\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
