She will also call on the EU to make full use of the trade tools at its\ndisposal to defend its industrial interests before it is too late.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina overtook the EU in 2020 as the largest maker of wind power\ninstallations, and now accounts for over half of the world\u2019s wind turbines in\noperation. More broadly, Beijing is seeking to establish itself as the global\nleader in the kind of clean tech that the EU will rely on to achieve its\ntransition to green energy.\n\nVestager will say that, with Beijing\u2019s roles as an economic competitor and\nsystemic rival increasingly converging, the EU cannot afford to see China\u2019s\ndominance in solar panels be repeated in other crucial fields, such as wind\nenergy, electric vehicles and semiconductors.\n\nThe EU investigation will be based on a new tool, called the Foreign Subsidies\nRegulation, which has already been deployed against Chinese state-run train\ngiant, CRRC, leading it to withdraw from a Bulgarian tender last month after\nits bid \u2014 which undercut rivals by 50 percent \u2014 was questioned by the\nCommission.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nElectric vehicles EU-China relations Foreign subsidies Regulation Trade Wind\nenergy\n\nRelated Countries\n\nBulgaria China France Greece Romania Spain United States\n\nRelated People\n\nMargrethe Vestager\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nEuropean Commission\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## EU pushes to curb China\u2019s green tech market lead\n\n3 HRS ago 4 mins read\n\nLetter from Tokyo\n\n## Japan hunkers down for Trump 2.0\n\n4 HRS ago 6 mins read\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT FROM MCA\n\n## The value of consulting\n\n11 HRS ago 5 mins read\n\nOpinion\n\n## A fairer future for farmers is a greener future for Europe\n\n12 HRS ago 5 mins read\n\n## More from Stuart Lau\n\n## EU pushes to curb China\u2019s green tech market lead\n\nBrussels\u2019 new probe into Chinese wind turbines comes as Beijing grabs\ndominance over global market for solar panels.\n\n3 HRS ago 4 mins read\n\n## UK\u2019s Cameron tells Europe: Pressure House Speaker Johnson on Ukraine\n\nEuropean foreign ministers have \u2018a real role to play\u2019 in lobbying the senior\nU.S. Republican, Britain\u2019s top diplomat says.\n\nApr 4 2 mins read\n\n## NATO invites Ukraine to its birthday party, with no fresh pledge on\nmembership\n\nUkraine is still looking in from the cold while the alliance\u2019s 32 member\ncountries celebrate 75 years of military security.\n\nApr 4 4 mins read\n\n## NATO ministers\u2019 doubts, fears and eye-rolls over \u20ac100B Ukraine plan\n\nMaking military aid to Kyiv more predictable would send a message to Russia\nthat it won\u2019t win the war, said the alliance chief.\n\nApr 3 6 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": false}
