Whereas\n\u201csuperhuman\u201d is generally defined as being smarter than any individual human\nat any specific task, superintelligent is often defined instead as being\nsmarter than every human\u2019s combined ability at any task.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that we\u2019ll have AI that is smarter than any one human probably\naround the end of next year,\u201d Musk said in a livestreamed interview on his\nsocial network X. That prediction was made with the caveat that increasing\ndemands for power and shortages of the most powerful AI training chips could\nlimit their capability in the near term.\n\n\u201cLast year it was chip-constrained,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could not get enough\nNvidia chips. This year it\u2019s transitioning to a voltage transformer supply. In\na year or two, it\u2019s just electricity supply.\u201d\n\nElon Musk sues OpenAI accusing it of putting profit before humanity\n\nRead more\n\nIn 2023, when he predicted a five- to six-year runway for superintelligence,\nMusk was vocally concerned about the ramifications. Speaking alongside the\nlaunch of his AI startup, xAI, that year, he said: \u201cIf I could press pause on\nAI or really advanced AI digital superintelligence I would. It doesn\u2019t seem\nlike that is realistic so xAI is essentially going to build an AI. In a good\nway, sort of hopefully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually important for us to worry about a Terminator future in order to\navoid a Terminator future,\u201d Musk added, referencing the film where a self-\naware computer system wages war on humanity.\n\nA year on, and xAI is firmly trying to lead the development of\nsuperintelligence. In a recent interview, Musk said the latest version of its\nchatbot Grok AI was on par with GPT-4, the leading model from OpenAI. GPT-4 is\nmore than a year old, and competitors have already met or exceeded its\ncapabilities, with Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus generally seen to be the new\nmarket leader.\n\nThe entrepreneur\u2019s predictions are infamously freely made. In 2016, he wrongly\nforecast that within two years it would be possible for a Tesla to drive\nautonomously from New York to Los Angeles. That same year he said his SpaceX\nrocket company would fly to Mars in 2018 \u2013 it still has not. And in 2017, Musk\nsuggested his Neuralink brain chip startup\u2019s first product would be on the\nmarket \u201cin about four years\u201d. The first human received an implant from the\ncompany seven years later.\n\nMusk has his hands full. Over the weekend, he declared war on a Brazilian\nsupreme court justice, calling for him to resign or be impeached over court\norders levied against X requiring it to take down the accounts of some\nBrazilian users. On Monday, news broke of testimony he had given in court\nabout his posts on the site in which he conceded that he \u201cmay have done more\nto financially impair the company than to help it\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

An earlier version referred to\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude 2 Sonnet, rather than Claude 3 Opus.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * X\n  * Computing\n  * Technology sector\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
