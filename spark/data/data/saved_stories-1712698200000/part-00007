He knows everyone here in town and is super tapped-in (a.k.a hard to surprise)\n  * My entire \u201cgrowth plan\u201d so far has been to focus on making the content so good people like Jason talk about it\n\nThis was a really nice indication that the process is working, so this week, I\nthought I\u2019d write about what that process looks like at a high level each\nweek, and the five tools that are crucial to my work right now.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just for local newsletters...\n\nIt\u2019s more universal, and should be useful no matter what kind of newsletter or\ncommunity you\u2019re building. A lot of it, I learned at The Hustle, then brought\nwith me to Hampton (where our weekly active members stayed between 85-90%).\n\nNow I\u2019m using it in Austin too, because it works.\n\nYou\u2019ll recognize the names of all five tools, but I use them in ways you might\nnot expect (that\u2019s literally the only reason I thought this might be worth\nwriting).\n\nWe\u2019ll get into them in a second, but first...\n\n## Let\u2019s Talk About Mindset\n\nThe tools I use are less important than the mindset. And the mindset is\ncentered about community-building.\n\nI want people to think of the newsletter as something they\u2019re a part of, and\nwant to interact with each week.\n\nWhat are people looking for in a professional community? There are a lot of\nthings, but generally, you can boil them down to these three must-haves:\n\n  * To meet someone interesting\n  * To learn something interesting\n  * To feel like they contribute\n\nWhether you\u2019re building online or in-person, it\u2019s always the same. Miss any\none of these for too long, and people will drop off.\n\nI\u2019ve talked before about how to write stuff no one else can. The main point of\nthat piece was that you can cultivate an information advantage as a writer,\nsimply by talking to people who are often overlooked.\n\nThis piece takes that one step further, with a few tips that\u2019ll help you put\nyourself at the center of an information web that\u2019s hard for anyone else to\nreplicate, and helps deliver on the three must-haves above.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into that...\n\n## 1\\. LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n\nI pay $100 a month for a membership to LinkedIn Sales Navigator just because\nit makes it easy for me to find interesting people to follow online based on\ncriteria that I want.\n\nFor example, here in Austin, I\u2019m building a business newsletter that shares\nevents and insights from fascinating people around town.\n\nThe process is pretty simple \u2013 find fascinating people, and follow them,\ncurating the best insights they share, and adding some personal opinions and\nresearch on top.\n\nNot just the famous people in Austin (remember, one of our goals is to\nintroduce readers to interesting people). We have to get off the beaten path.\n\nSales Nav makes this easy.\n\nNot only can I pull a list of local founders in seconds, but I can also see\nfrom the dashboard who\u2019s actively posting on LinkedIn and might be worth\nfollowing. The list stays updated too, so as people either relocate here, or\nchange their info the match my search, I see \u2018em.\n\nSo what I do is I keep this list, and when I have spare time throughout the\nweek, I peruse it looking for new voices worth following.\n\nI go deeper than you might expect. If someone appears here but doesn\u2019t publish\non LinkedIn, I\u2019ll check for them on Twitter, or look for a personal blog.\n\nI check out their company site too.\n\nI think of this as a process of ongoing discovery \u2013 continually finding new\nthings to be interested in and write about. So don\u2019t rush it. You\u2019re never\nreally done.\n\n## 2\\. Twitter Lists\n\nFor god\u2019s sake, don\u2019t use the native Twitter feed if you\u2019re trying to get any\nwork done. It\u2019s a hellscape of distractions.\n\nInstead, pick the people you want to pay attention to, and put them in a list.\nThen save a link to that list in your bookmarks bar so you can get to it\nwithout ever going to the Twitter homepage.\n\nNot only do you avoid the distractions of trending topics and recommended\nposts. But you\u2019ll get to scroll everyone\u2019s tweets sequentially \u2013 no algorithm\nfiltering. So it\u2019s much better from a content-curation standpoint, because you\ncan be confident you\u2019re actually seeing everything people are saying week to\nweek.\n\nBonus Tip: I also install the Tweet Hunter X plugin, which does two great\nthings:\n\n  * It automatically surfaces the most popular tweets for any profile you land on\n  * It blocks the \u201cTrending Topic\u201d sidebar \u2013 you have no idea how good this is for your brain\n\n## 3\\. My RSS Reader: Feedly\n\nEven if someone publishes on LinkedIn or Twitter, they\u2019ll often share more in-\ndepth ideas on a blog or newsletter, and so I use Feedly to keep up with\nthose.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what RSS readers are, good! The modern media industry would\nbasically wither and die if readers ever caught onto how great RSS is.\n\nOkay, fine... I\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s basically a custom social media feed.\n\nYou can subscribe to newsletters, blogs, social media channels, and more, and\nhave all posts pushed to one central location, organized, even highlighted or\nsummarized with new AI features.\n\nBasically, you get all the info you want without the attention-grabbing\nalgorithms or incentives of big social. It\u2019s also easier to unsubscribe from\nstuff, because you just nuke the individual feed for that source, rather than\nhoping they take you off their list.\n\nSo anyways, RSS is great.\n\nI keep two different lists. One is for official publications here in Austin\n(newspapers, culture magazines, that kind of thing). The other is for personal\nblogs and newsletters of specific people in town.\n\nPro Tip: Often, when someone signs up for the newsletter, I\u2019ll check to see if\nthey publish stuff online. If they do, and it\u2019s a fit for the newsletter, I\u2019ll\nadd them to my RSS feed and keep an eye on their work.\n\nI like to shout readers out as often as I can. It\u2019s fun, and also helps give\nthem the sense of contribution I talked about earlier.\n\nEvery morning, I get up early and my first 1-2 hours looks like this:\n\n  * Go through Feedly skimming new articles\n  * Scroll the last 24 hours on my Twitter list\n  * Scroll my LinkedIn Feed\n\nBecause I continually add to all three of these whenever I find new sources\nworth following, the quality of the stuff I\u2019m able to surface continues to\nimprove over time as the \u201cinformation web\u201d gets more and more unique.\n\n## 4\\. The Drop File\n\nI talked about this in my community newsletter playbook, but one of the most\nimportant tools I have is a simple, ugly, Google Doc that sits in my bookmarks\nbar.\n\nAs I sit down each morning, and throughout the day, if I come across anything\nthat might be an interesting fit for the newsletter, it gets dropped in here.\n\nThen, when it\u2019s time to write, I open this file up, review what I\u2019ve got, and\npick from there.\n\nShout out to Steph Smith who taught me this\n\nThere are a lot of little things that go into writing a business newsletter\nweek after week. You can\u2019t reference the same person too often or the content\nbecomes too obvious and easy. You want to have a good mix of men and women\nhighlighted. A good mix of industries too.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to just sit down and write that off the cuff.\n\nHaving the drop file makes it easier to pick from a buffet of ideas and get\nthe kind of blend that I\u2019m looking for each week. It also lets me develop\nlonger stories over several weeks, collecting material passively until I feel\nI have enough to write something.\n\n## 5\\. Time\n\nThe final tool \u2013 this stuff takes time. I probably spend 10-15 hours each week\njust reviewing these feeds, exploring, and being curious. And I think that\u2019s\nkind of the main advantage I have in finding things that surprise people.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to make something people enjoy reading in less time. But it\u2019s\nhard to build deep knowledge of a topic, and that\u2019s my real goal here.\n\nSo many people are trying to shortcut the writing process these days. They\nlook at an article like this, and their first thought is how to use AI to\nreplicate what I\u2019m doing in a fraction of the time.\n\nI don\u2019t worry about them at all.\n\nTo whatever extent I\u2019m able to set myself apart from competitors, it\u2019s largely\nbecause I\u2019m quite happy to spend the time doing the thing that we\u2019re here to\ndo. The newsletter isn\u2019t a path to something else.\n\nIf you feel the same way about your work, I think you\u2019ll be just fine, as long\nas you know how to monetize well.\n\n## Quick Wrap-Up\n\nOkay, so to review, there are three things that great content and communities\nneed to offer:\n\n  * New people\n  * New ideas\n  * A chance to contribute\n\nI use tools like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Feedly to continually surface new\npeople and ideas to share with readers.\n\nI also use those same tools to follow my readers, so their work sometimes ends\nup in the newsletter, which gives them a sense of contribution.\n\nThe drop file keeps everything trapped in one spot so it\u2019s ready for me when\nit\u2019s time to write.\n\nAnd time is the secret ingredient that allows me to dig deeper than readers or\ncompetitors could on their own. It takes everything above, and dials it up to\n11.\n\nPrevious\n\n#### Read this next time your newsletter feels like a chore...\n\n### Books by Ethan\n\n### Popular Posts\n\n  * How I Find Surprising Content For My Newsletter\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n  * Read this next time your newsletter feels like a chore...\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\n  * Slow to Build, Slow to Kill\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\n  * The Importance of Innovating On Content\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n  * I Learned Something New About Monetizing Newsletters\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nThis site is an Amazon Associate and purchases through Amazon links may earn\nan affiliate commission.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 - 2024 Ethan Brooks\n\nPowered by WordPress & Theme by Anders Nor\u00e9n\n\n", "frontpage": false}
