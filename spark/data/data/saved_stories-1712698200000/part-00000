The large blank region in the\neast is due to the wide distributions of four families (Eskimo-Aleut,\nAthabaskan, Algonquian, Siouan), which are represented elsewhere in the\nsample. Credit: American Journal of Biological Anthropology (2024). DOI:\n10.1002/ajpa.24923\n\nJohanna Nichols, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, has\nused her pioneering work in the field of language history to learn more about\nlanguage development in North America. She has found that it can be traced\nback to two language groups that originated in Siberia. Her paper is published\nin the American Journal of Biological Anthropology.\n\nOver the past several decades, scientists have learned more about the people\nwho originally populated North America, and by extension, Central and South\nAmerica. One characteristic of these people has remained largely a mystery:\nthe evolution of the languages spoken by people living in what is now Canada,\nthe U.S. and Mexico.\n\nFor this new study, Nichols used statistical techniques she developed to trace\nlanguage lineage back to the earliest inhabitants of North America, going back\n24,000 years.\n\nNichols' techniques involve the use of linguistic typology, a field that\ninvolves comparing languages and organizing them based on shared criteria. To\nlearn more about early North American languages, she compiled lists of\nlanguage characteristics and applied them to all known languages. She then\nscored each of the languages based on the revealed qualities. This allowed her\nto compare the languages as a way to find resemblances among them and spot\npatterns.\n\nNichols found that she could trace the languages spoken in early North America\nback to just two lineages, both of which originated in Siberia. They came, she\nnotes, with the people who made their way across land bridges during Ice Age\nglaciation events.\n\nThose two main groups she found evolved into different languages as people\nmoved to different regions\u2014she focused most specifically on 60 of them. She\nfound that many of those languages were also impacted by multiple waves of\nSiberians arriving in North America.\n\nShe concludes that some of the characteristics of the original languages have\nbeen retained through the years and are now in the current linguistic\npopulation.\n\nMore information: Johanna Nichols, Founder effects identify languages of the\nearliest Americans, American Journal of Biological Anthropology (2024).
