It was created by American programmer Terry A. Davis,\nwho developed it alone over the course of a decade after a series of manic\nepisodes that he later described as a revelation from God.\n\nThe system was characterized as a modern x86-64 Commodore 64, using an\ninterface similar to a mixture of DOS and Turbo C. Davis proclaimed that the\nsystem's features, such as its 640x480 resolution, 16-color display, and\nsingle-voice audio, were designed according to explicit instructions from\nGod.^[1] It was programmed with an original variation of C (named HolyC) in\nplace of BASIC, and included an original flight simulator, compiler, and\nkernel.\n\nFirst released in 2005 as J Operating System, TempleOS was renamed in 2013 and\nwas last updated in 2018.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nMain article: Terry A. Davis\n\nTerry A. Davis\n\nTerry A. Davis (1969\u20132018) began experiencing regular manic episodes in 1996,\nleading him to numerous stays at mental hospitals. Initially diagnosed with\nbipolar disorder, he was later declared schizophrenic and remained unemployed\nfor the rest of his life.^[1] He suffered from delusions of space aliens and\ngovernment agents that left him briefly hospitalized for his mental health\nissues.^[1]^[2] After experiencing a self-described \"revelation\", he\nproclaimed that he was in direct communication with God, and that God told him\nthe operating system was for God's third temple.^[1]\n\nDavis began developing TempleOS circa 2003.^[3] One of its early names was the\n\"J Operating System\" before renaming it to \"LoseThos\", a reference to a scene\nfrom the 1986 film Platoon.^[1] In 2008, Davis wrote that LoseThos was\n\"primarily for making video games. It has no networking or Internet support.\nAs far as I'm concerned, that would be reinventing the wheel\".^[4] Another\nname he used was \"SparrowOS\" before settling on \"TempleOS\".^[5] In mid-2013,\nhis website announced: \"God's temple is finished. Now, God kills CIA until it\nspreads [sic].\"^[6] Davis died after being hit by a train on August 11,\n2018.^[7]\n\n## System overview[edit]\n\nTempleOS is a 64-bit, non-preemptive multi-tasking,^[8] multi-cored, public\ndomain, open source, ring-0-only, single address space, non-networked, PC\noperating system for recreational programming.^[9] The OS runs 8-bit ASCII\nwith graphics in source code and has a 2D and 3D graphics library, which run\nat 640x480 VGA with 16 colors.^[5] Like most modern operating systems, it has\nkeyboard and mouse support. It supports ISO 9660, FAT32 and RedSea file\nsystems (the latter created by Davis) with support for file compression.^[10]\nAccording to Davis, many of these specifications\u2014such as the 640x480\nresolution, 16-color display and single audio voice\u2014were instructed to him by\nGod. He explained that the limited resolution was to make it easier for\nchildren to draw illustrations for God.^[1]\n\nThe operating system includes an original flight simulator, compiler, and\nkernel.^[3] One bundled program, \"After Egypt\", is a game in which the player\ntravels to a burning bush to use a \"high-speed stopwatch\". The stopwatch is\nmeant to act as an oracle that generates pseudo-random text, something Davis\nlikened to a Ouija board and glossolalia.^[5] An example of generated text\nfollows:\n\n> among consigned penally result perverseness checked stated held sensation\n> reasonings skies adversity Dakota lip Suffer approached enact displacing\n> feast Canst pearl doing alms comprehendeth nought^[5]\n\nTempleOS was written in a programming language developed by Davis as a middle\nground between C and C++, originally called \"C+\" (C Plus), later renamed to\n\"HolyC\", possibly a reference to the Holy See.^[5] It doubles as the shell\nlanguage, enabling the writing and execution of entire applications from\nwithin the shell. The IDE that comes with TempleOS supports several features,\nsuch as embedding images in code. It uses a non-standard text format (known as\nDolDoc) which has support for hypertext links, images, and 3D meshes to be\nembedded into what are otherwise standard ASCII files; for example, a file can\nhave a spinning 3D model of a tank as a comment in source code. Most code in\nthe OS is JIT-compiled, and it is generally encouraged to use JIT compilation\nas opposed to creating binaries.^[11]^[unreliable source?] Davis ultimately\nwrote over 100,000 lines of code for the OS.^[3]\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\nTempleOS received mostly \"sympathetic\" reviews. Tech journalist David Cassel\nopined that \"programming websites tried to find the necessary patience and\nunderstanding to accommodate Davis\".^[3] TechRepublic and OSNews published\npositive articles on Davis's work, even though Davis was banned from the\nlatter for hostile comments targeting its readers and staff.^[3] In his review\nfor TechRepublic, James Sanders concluded that \"TempleOS is a testament to the\ndedication and passion of one man displaying his technological prowess. It\ndoesn't need to be anything more.\"^[5] OSNews editor Kroc Camen wrote that the\nOS \"shows that computing can still be a hobby; why is everybody so serious\nthese days? If I want to code an OS that uses interpretive dance as the input\nmethod, I should be allowed to do so, companies like Apple be damned.\"^[3] In\n2017, the OS was shown as a part of an outsider art exhibition in Bourgogne,\nFrance.^[12]\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nAfter Davis' death, OSNews editor Thom Holwerda wrote: \"Davis was clearly a\ngifted programmer \u2013 writing an entire operating system is no small feat \u2013 and\nit was sad to see him affected by his mental illness\".^[13] One fan described\nDavis as a \"programming legend\", while another, a computer engineer, compared\nthe development of TempleOS to a one-man-built skyscraper.^[7] He added that\nit \"actually boggles my mind that one man wrote all that\" and that it was\n\"hard for a layperson to understand what a phenomenal achievement\" it is to\nwrite an entire operating system alone.^[7]\n\nTempleOS is in the public domain. Davis's family has wished for fans to donate\nto the National Alliance for Mental Illness and other organizations \"working\nto ease the pain and suffering caused by mental illness\".^[6]\n\n## Forks[edit]\n\n  * ZealOS \u2014 The Zeal Operating System is a modernized fork of the 64-bit Temple Operating System.^[14]\n  * TinkerOS^[15]\n  * Shrine^[16]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Free and open-source software portal\n\n  * Creativity and mental health\n  * Biblical software\n  * Religion and video games\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f Hicks, Jesse (November 25, 2014). \"God's Lonely Programmer\".
