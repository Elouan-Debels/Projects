For PostgreSQL\nusers, the tech preview release availability of the new encryption extension\npg_tde delivers unmatched protection for vital data assets.\n\n## What is pg_tde?\n\npg_tde, developed by Percona, is an open source extension designed to provide\ntransparent data encryption capabilities for PostgreSQL databases. Unlike\ntraditional encryption methods that require significant changes to database\nschemas and applications, pg_tde seamlessly integrates with PostgreSQL,\nencrypting data at the table level without disrupting existing workflows.\n\n## Key features and benefits\n\n  * Encryption of heap tables, including TOAST.\n  * Storage of encryption keys in either a Hashicorp Vault server or a local keyring file (primarily for development purposes).\n  * Configurable key storage through separate JSON configuration files.\n  * Replication support.\n  * Enhanced security through the ability to rotate master keys used for data encryption, reducing the risk of long-term exposure to potential attacks and aiding compliance with security standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.\n\nIn addition, users can now tailor encryption settings differently for each\ndatabase. For instance, selected databases can be encrypted with a distinct\nencryption key, while others remain non-encrypted.\n\nSignificant improvements have been made to keyring configuration, including:\n\n  * The capability to define separate keyring configurations for individual databases.\n  * Dynamic modification of keyring configurations without the need for server restarts.\n  * Storage of keyring configurations in catalogs specific to each database rather than in a singular configuration file.\n  * Enhanced security measures, such as avoiding the storage of secrets in unencrypted catalogs by configuring keyring parameters to be sourced from external locations such as files or HTTP(S) requests.\n\n## Getting started with pg_tde\n\nGetting started with pg_tde is straightforward, thanks to comprehensive\ndocumentation and user-friendly installation procedures. The pg_tde GitHub\nrepository provides detailed instructions for building and installing the\nextension, as well as examples and usage guidelines to help users deploy\npg_tde effectively.\n\nTo install pg_tde, users can clone the repository, build the extension using\nthe provided Makefile, and install it into their PostgreSQL environment or\nsimply download the packages provided in our testing repositories. We do offer\npre-build rpm and deb packages. Once installed, users can begin encrypting\ntheir data using simple SQL commands, with no need to make significant changes\nto their existing applications or queries.\n\n### Looking ahead\n\nThe release of pg_tde represents a significant achievement in PostgreSQL\nsecurity, offering users a robust and transparent encryption solution that is\nefficient and easy to use. As organizations face changing security threats and\nregulatory requirements, tools like pg_tde will play a crucial role in\nsafeguarding sensitive data and maintaining compliance.\n\nIn the coming months, Percona plans to refine and enhance pg_tde based on\nfeedback from the community, including index encryption.\n\n### pg_tde for PostgreSQL database security\n\nWith the release of pg_tde, Percona has reached the first milestone for\nenhanced data security in PostgreSQL environments.\n\nVisit the official GitHub repository to learn more about pg_tde and download\nthe tech preview release.
