These are\nswapped for encrypted bearer tokens in order to access the container via the\ndata gateway.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\nWe only need your email address to sign up. No payment details are required\nuntil you upgrade to one of our paid plans.\n\nAPI security is managed by exchanging SlyceIO API keys for encrypted fixed\nduration access tokens provided by the SlyceIO TOKEN endpoint\n\nYour container data can be accessed using any HTTP client.\n\nYour subscription determines the number of API calls per day \u2013 any call to the\nAPI will count towards this quota.\n\nOnce the threshold has been reached you will receive a HTTP status code of 429\n\u2013 your quota will be renewed the following day.\n\nAzure Cosmos DB container data gateway.\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Policy\n\n\u00a92024 SlyceIO.
