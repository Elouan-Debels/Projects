This includes\nChatGPT-like LLMs and models like YoloV5. This repo is divided in two\nsubmodules:\n\n  * https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-llm\n  * https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-toolkit2\n\nApart from that, you can find converted LLMs (and how to download them) here:\n\n  * https://huggingface.co/Pelochus/ezrkllm-collection\n\nCurrently focusing only on RK3588 and RK3588S.\n\n## Requirements\n\nKeep in mind this repo is focused for:\n\n  * Installing what's needed for Linux and running on the SBC directly.\n  * Rockchip RK3588, but I accept contributions for running on other compatible Rockchip SoCs.\n  * You are running either Debian 11 or Ubuntu 22.04 or later versions. Derivatives should possibly work fine too.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThis will install required dependencies, packages, libraries and install both\nRKNN Toolkit 2 and RKNN LLM.\n\nRun:\n\n    \n    \n    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pelochus/ezrknpu/main/install.sh | sudo bash\n\n## Running\n\nDepending on what you want to run, please refer to these links:\n\n### Test Run\n\nCurrently, the lightest (works on 4GB of RAM) and best working model is Qwen\n1.8B Chat. To run it:\n\n    \n    \n    GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://huggingface.co/Pelochus/qwen-1_8B-rk3588 # Running git lfs pull after is usually better cd qwen-1_8B-rk3588 && git lfs pull # Pull model rkllm qwen-chat-1_8B.rkllm # Run!\n\nWait for about a minute before the model loads. If something fails, perhaps it\nis a good idea keep reading below.\n\n### Downloading and running a LLM on your NPU\n\nFor downloading:\n\n  * https://huggingface.co/Pelochus/ezrkllm-collection\n\nFor running an already downloaded model:\n\n  * https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-llm?tab=readme-ov-file#test\n\nConverting a compatible model to RKLLM format (check previously Rockchip's\ndocs on rknn-llm repo). This needs a x86 PC:\n\n  * https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-llm?tab=readme-ov-file#converting-llms-for-rockchips-npus\n\n### Running and using the RKNN-Toolkit for NN applications\n\nhttps://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-toolkit2/?tab=readme-ov-file#test\n\n## Checking NPU usage\n\nYou have 3 options:\n\n  * rknputop (graphical option, works on OSes without GUI): https://github.com/ramonbroox/rknputop\n  * Running ntop.sh, from this repo which runs the command from next point every 0.5 s\n  * Running sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/rknpu/load\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease open an issue or PR on the corresponding submodule repo. If unsure,\nopen it on this repo:\n\n  * For RKLLM related: https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-llm\n  * For RKNN related: https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-toolkit2\n\nCurrently (and mainly) there are the following contributions to be made:\n\n  * Other Rockchip SoCs support. Check their documentation to see which are capable.\n  * Android support\n  * Conversion of other compatible LLMs (Llama 2 mainly, since I'm low on RAM)\n  * Improve documentation\n  * Other general improvements to installation scripts, Docker containers, support for other Linux distros like Arch, submitting issues, adding more error checking...\n\n## Useful Links\n\n  * Dedicated subreddit. I strongly recommend taking a look at the wiki and various posts there: https://www.reddit.com/r/RockchipNPU/\n  * LLM submodule for this repo: https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-llm\n  * NN submodule for this repo: https://github.com/Pelochus/ezrknn-toolkit2\n\n## About\n\nEasy usage of Rockchip's NPUs found in RK3588 and similar chips\n\n### Topics\n\nneural-networks rockchip npu llm rk3588\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nGPL-3.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n4 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Shell 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
