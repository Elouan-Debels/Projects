In honor of his\nachievements (and those of others around him, most notably Robert Brout and\nFrancois Englert, with special mentions to Phil Anderson and to Gerald\nGuralnik, C. Richard Hagen, and Thomas Kibble), it seems appropriate to update\nthe Higgs FAQ, to bring to it the perspective of the 2020\u2019s.\n\nIf you have no math or physics in your background, you may find it useful,\nbefore or after you read this FAQ, to read my brief literary article on Why\nthe Higgs Particle Matters. You may also find my book Waves in an Impossible\nSea useful; it covers Higgs-et-al.\u2019s ideas in some detail (as well as\nexploring the nature of elementary particles and of empty space, and the role\nthat modern physics plays in our daily experience.)\n\nIf you have a little math in your background (algebra, trig, and calculus\nthrough derivatives) and a little physics (you know what energy is, what a\nball on a spring does, and have thought at least once about what waves are)\nthen, after reading this FAQ, you may want to follow up by reading my\nParticles and Fields articles, followed by my explanation of the Higgs field\nand how it works.\n\nOk \u2014 without further ado, here we go.\n\n## Basics\n\n  * What is the Higgs particle?\n\nWell, we have to start with the Higgs field, which is the key to the story.\n\n  * And what\u2019s a field?\n\nAs I described in detail in a recent post, a field is something that\n\n  1. is present everywhere in space and time,\n  2. can be, on average, zero or not zero,\n  3. can have waves in it,\n  4. and, if it is a quantum field, then its waves are made from \u201cparticles\u201d (which, as I explained in my book, are little ripples, and might better be termed \u201cwavicles\u201d.)\n\nSo for example: the electric field.\n\n  1. It is a part of nature that is found everywhere. At any given point in space, and at any particular time, you can measure it.\n  2. If it\u2019s non-zero on average in some region, it can have physical effects, such as making your hair stand on end, or causing a spark.\n  3. The electric field can also have waves, in which the size of the field repeatedly becomes larger and smaller \u2014 visible light is such a wave, as are X-rays and radio waves, and all the other things we collectively call \u201celectromagnetic waves\u201d.\n  4. Those waves are made from \u201cparticles\u201d, called photons; the opsin molecules in our eyes absorb them one at a time.\n\nThe Higgs field, too, is found everywhere. In fact, it is non-zero everywhere,\nand this effect causes various other elementary particles to have \u201cmass\u201d (see\nbelow.) Its waves are also made from \u201cparticles\u201d, called Higgs bosons\n(absurdly referred to sometimes as God particles, a term that Higgs disliked\nand I do too, since it distracts from the true importance of Higgs-et-al.\u2019s\nkey ideas.) This type of particle was discovered in 2012.\n\n  * Ok, so, what is a particle, and why do you want to call it a wavicle?\n\nA quantum field\u2019s waves cannot be of arbitrary intensity; they can\u2019t be\narbitrarily \u201cdim\u201d, or \u201cquiet\u201d. The least-intense possible wave that a field\ncan have is called a \u201cquantum\u201d, or more often a \u201cparticle\u201d. It often behaves\nin rough accordance with your intuitive notion of \u201cparticle\u201d, moving in a\nstraight line and bouncing indivisibly off of things, etc., which is why we\ngive it that name.\n\nIn the case of the electric field, its particles are called \u201cphotons\u201d; they\nrepresent the dimmest possible flash. Your eye can absorb light one photon at\na time (though it typically waits for several photons to arrive before sending\na signal to your brain.) A laser produces very intense waves, but if you\nshield a laser with a screen so that only a tiny fraction of the light gets\nthrough, you will find, if you shield it enough, that the light passes through\nthe screen in little blips \u2014 single photons \u2014 all of them equally dim. (Click\nhere for a video [BIG! 284 MB and 23 minutes, unfortunately; and you\u2019ll get\nthe point after just 10 seconds] which demonstrates this effect; the screen\nregisters the light one photon at a time. Here\u2019s the webpage it\u2019s from if you\nwant to learn what the whole video is about.) [This video is no longer\navailable, but I\u2019ll find another one shortly.]\n\nEach of these little blips is a little, indivisible wave \u2014 a ripple of very\nsmall height, or \u201camplitude\u201d, and of very low amounts of energy. It is to a\nwave as a grain of sand is to a sand pile, or a sheet of paper to a stack of\npaper \u2014 the smallest amount of wave that you can have. That sounds to me like\na wavicle, a term that goes back to the 1920s but didn\u2019t catch on back then.\nNowadays it is gaining followers.\n\nWith regard to the Higgs FAQ, the key point is this: Higgs particle is to\nHiggs field as photon is to electric field. Waves in the electric (and\nmagnetic) field are made of wavicles of light, called photons; waves in the\nHiggs field are made of Higgs wavicles, i.e. Higgs bosons.\n\n  * So... a Higgs wave is a ripple in the Higgs field, and the Higgs particle is the smallest \u2014 well, `dimmest\u2019 \u2014 such wave.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Of course this is a very short version of the full story. To\ntell the full version of the story without math, in language interpretable by\na general reader, was one of the main goals of my book. A version requiring a\nlittle math and physics background, such as one would get from the first few\nmonths of university-level physics, is available on this website, here.\n\n## Significance\n\n  * Why do particle physicists care so much about the Higgs particle?\n\nWell, actually, they don\u2019t. What they really care about is the Higgs field,\nbecause it is so important.\n\n  * What\u2019s so important about the Higgs field?\n\nThe Higgs field (unlike most of the elementary fields of nature) has a non-\nzero average value throughout the entire universe. And because it does, many\nparticles have mass [specifically \u201crest mass\u201d, which is the amount of mass\nthey have intrinsically], including the electron, the quarks, and the W and Z\nparticles of the weak interactions. If the Higgs field\u2019s average value were\nzero, those particles would have much smaller mass or none at all. That would\nbe a disaster; atoms and atomic nuclei would disintegrate. Nothing like human\nbeings, or the earth we live on, could exist without the Higgs field having a\nnon-zero average value. Our lives truly depend upon it.\n\n  * What do we know about the Higgs field?\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider [LHC] has carried on twelve years of studies of the\nHiggs boson since its discovery, and what we have learned about this type of\nparticles tells us something about the Higgs field. We know for sure now that\nmany types of particles get the vast majority or all of their rest masses from\nthe Higgs field. That said, there is still a lot to learn; more on that below.\n\n  * Then if the Higgs field is so important, why is there so much hype about finding the Higgs particle?\n\nOn the one hand, finding the Higgs particle is the easiest (and perhaps only)\nway for physicists to learn about the Higgs field \u2014 which is what we really\nwant. In that sense, finding and studying the Higgs particle are steps toward\nthe main goal: understanding the properties of the Higgs field and why it has\na non-zero average value.\n\nOn the other hand, our modern media world insists on generating hype. And\nsince explaining the Higgs field and its role and its relation to the Higgs\nparticle takes too long for a typical news report or interview, journalists,\nand people talking to them, typically cut the story short. So the Higgs boson\ngets all the attention, indeed far too much [\u201cgood God, particle\u201d!], while the\nunfortunate Higgs field labors in obscurity, protecting the universe from\ncatastrophe but getting none of its deserved credit...\n\n  * Are physicists sure there\u2019s a Higgs field?\n\nYes. The studies of the last twelve years make this unambiguous.\n\nHowever there are still things we don\u2019t know for certain yet. For instance:\n\n  1. There might be more than one Higgs field, each with its own type of particle (all collectively referred to as \u201cHiggs particles\u201d or \u201cHiggs bosons\u201d.) So far the evidence is that there is only one, but this is still not firmly established.\n  2. It is possible the Higgs field is an agglomeration \u2014 a \u201ccomposite\u201d \u2014 of several other fields. We have examples of such things in nature already \u2014 for example, just as a proton is a composite object made from quarks, antiquarks and gluons, the proton field would be a composite field made from quark, antiquark and gluon fields. So far, all the evidence is that it is an elementary field, like the electric field. But it\u2019s too early, as yet, to close the doors on a more subtle possibility.\n\nThe only way to know how many Higgs fields there are, whether they are\nelementary or not, and how they interact with the particles we know and\nperhaps ones we don\u2019t yet know, is to run an experiment: the Large Hadron\nCollider, or LHC. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, and will continue to do.\n\n  * What does elementary mean?\n\nSorry about this, but the answer is circular \u2014 it means not composite. It\nmeans it can\u2019t be broken into more elementary peices.\n\nEven that\u2019s not quite true. It means that it can\u2019t be broken into parts using\nthe technology we have now. Someday that might change. Indeed people used to\nthink protons were elementary, and before that they thought atoms were\nelementary (hence the Periodic Table of the \u201cElements\u201d).\n\n  * Are particle physicists sure there\u2019s a Higgs particle?\n\nAbsolutely. The evidence for the Higgs boson is overwhelming.\n\nBut again, we\u2019re not sure the type of Higgs boson we\u2019ve found is the only one.\nStudy of its properties, and searches for other particles, may give us clues\nas to the existence of other types of Higgs bosons, or may help confirm it is\nunique.\n\n  * The press \u2014 and even many physicists \u2014 sometimes say explicitly that the LHC was built to find the Higgs particle! Since that\u2019s happened, isn\u2019t the LHC done with its task?\n\nThese statements that you read in the press are not true. The correct\nstatement is that the LHC was built to figure out what the Higgs field is (or\nHiggs fields are), how it works (or they work), and whether it is (or they\nare) elementary or composite. Searching for and studying the Higgs particle(s)\nis the way to do that.\n\nLet\u2019s not confuse the ends for the means! Understanding the field or fields is\nthe end goal, while finding and studying the particle or particles is just the\nmeans. The LHC has done a lot, but there\u2019s still much more for it to do before\nit is shut down. After that, a new \u201cHiggs factory\u201d particle accelerator\n(perhaps the one I discussed in this post) will help us increase our\nunderstanding greatly.\n\n## Terminology\n\n  * Why is the Higgs particle often called the \u201cHiggs boson\u201d? (pronounced \u201cboh-zon\u201d)\n\nAll the particles in nature \u2014 whether elementary or not \u2014 can be divided into\ntwo classes, fermions and bosons. [There are some weird exceptions inside\ncertain solid materials; I tell you this only to avoid having a brick thrown\nat my head by some of my colleagues.] It happens that the Higgs particle, like\nthe photon and a few other elementary particles, is a boson. This is related\nto the fact that the Higgs field can have a large non-zero value across the\nuniverse.\n\n  * Why is the Higgs particle called the \u201cGod particle\u201d?\n\nBecause the media thinks it sounds cool and that it gets readers to read their\nstories. The origin of the nickname is about as non-religious and non-\nscientific as one could imagine: it was invented as advertising. Professor and\nNobel Prize Winner Leon Lederman, a very important experimental physicist who\ndeserves enormous credit for his contributions to the field, deserves some\nserious demerits for having allowed his book on the Higgs particle to be\nassigned this attention-getting title... which is somewhere between\ninappropriate and blasphemous, depending on where you come from. When I first\nheard him use this moniker in a talk that he gave while I was in grad school,\nmy jaw hit the floor. I knew enough physics even then to know how completely\nabsurd it was.\n\nI have never heard or seen a physicist refer to the Higgs particle in this way\nin the context of a scientific paper, a talk at a conference, or even an\ninformal scientific discussion. There\u2019s nothing in the mathematical equations,\nin the interpretation of the physics, in any philosophy of which I am aware,\nor in any religious text or tradition with which I am familiar that connects\nthe Higgs particle or the Higgs field with any notion of religion or divinity.\nThe nickname is pure invention.\n\nMoreover, each Higgs boson \u201cdecays\u201d (i.e. are transformed into other\nparticles) in about a billionth of a trillionth of a second. That means\n\n  1. They are no Higgs bosons anywhere around you, or in your town or city; in fact, at this very moment, there are probably none existing naturally anywhere in our galaxy.\n  2. Higgs bosons haven\u2019t done anything interesting since the very beginning of the universe.\n  3. We have to make our own from scratch, artificially, at the LHC.\n\nThis sounds quite un-God-like to me. The Higgs field, by contrast, is\neverywhere around and within is, and is of enormous importance. You can call\nit the God Field if you want, I suppose.\n\nBut personally I think it is not healthy for either science or religion to be\npushed around by the need of the publishing industry to sell books, or the\nmedia to sell stories. The sooner we drop this notion, the better.\n\n## I\u2019ve heard that...\n\n  * I hear the Higgs particle decays rapidly, so how can it create or support the Higgs field? What I have read seems to imply that there is this sea of Higgs particles and this somehow sets up the Higgs field. That wouldn\u2019t work if the Higgs particle existed for just an instant.\n\nThe Higgs field doesn\u2019t have to be created by a process; it is just there, the\nway the electric field of nature is just there, always and everywhere. It is\nintegrated into the empty space that makes up the fabric of the universe.\n\nThe Higgs field has a non-zero value in nature on average. (The electric field\nis zero on average). This non-zero value also is just there; it doesn\u2019t have\nto be generated by a process. It is simply the preferred state of our universe\nfor the Higgs field to be non-zero. We don\u2019t know why, but nobody has to do\nanything to make it that way.\n\nThe non-zero value of the Higgs field should not be thought of as a sea of\nHiggs particles; that is the wrong intuition. A Higgs particle is a ripple of\nminimal intensity in the Higgs field; a ripple varies over space and time,\njust as any wave does. But the non-zero value of the Higgs field is constant\nover space and time; it does not vary. Here\u2019s a pretty good analogy: the\ndensity of the air is a field; it has a constant average value; waves in the\nair are sound waves; and there is no sense in which the constant average\ndensity of the air should be thought of as built up from a sea of sound waves,\nwhich are evanescent ripples in the air.\n\nHiggs particles are not formed spontaneously. You have to put energy to work\nif you want to make them. You have to use something like an LHC proton-proton\ncollision to whack the Higgs field and make it wiggle, just as you have to\nclap your hands to make sound, hit the surface of a lake to make a ripple, or\npluck a violin string to get it to vibrate. Just as a ripple dies away after a\nwhile, and a violin string eventually stops vibrating, a Higgs particle will\ndecay away too. The air, the lake, the violin string, and the Higgs field\nremain behind after the vibrating dissipates.\n\n  * Then Higgs particles don\u2019t normally exist? I think this is why you also mentioned that there are no Higgs particles in the room I am in, yet my electrons have mass. What role, if any, does the Higgs particle play in the mass mechanism? I was thinking it might be a force carrier particle like the W boson for the weak force, but it doesn\u2019t sound like Higgs particle is supposed to do this. I also heard that Higgs bosons could bubble into existence by \u201cborrowing\u201d energy for a moment and then dissappearing. So there would be Higgs particles in the room. Do you agree with that picture?\n\nThe Higgs particle does not have any role to play in the mechanism by which\nelementary particles get their rest mass. It\u2019s the Higgs field \u2014 in\nparticular, the fact that its average value is non-zero \u2014 which leads the\nvarious particles to have mass. [To explain this carefully and thoroughly was\none of the main goals of my book. You can also look at my video clips on the\nmatter, taken from my old Secret Science Club talk:\nhttp://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/] It\u2019s the field that we really want\nto understand, not the particle... the particle is a means to an end, not an\nend in itself.\n\nThere are indeed virtual Higgs particles in the room, but virtual particles\nare not particles at all, despite the name. Higgs particles are nicely behaved\nwaves in the Higgs field, whereas virtual Higgs \u201cparticles\u201d are more general\ntypes of disturbances in the Higgs field. Higgs particles have a definite\nmass; virtual Higgs \u201cparticles\u201d do not. See\nhttp://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-\nbasics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/ What you\u2019ve heard is the standard\n\u201clittle lie\u201d (or \u201cphib\u201d) that many theoretical physicists usually tell the\npublic. But it is so deeply misleading that it confuses people terribly (as I\nsee regularly, through the questions I am asked). For this reason, I urge you\nto disregard it.\n\n  * If mass is created by a particle interacting (moving through) the Higgs Field then is the field moving or the particle or both? If a particle is static (not moving) relative to the Higgs Field, can it lose its mass?\n\nNo matter how you are moving, you are not moving relative to the Higgs field.\nThat sounds bizarre, but remember something else bizarre: that no matter how\nyou are moving, light is moving about relative to you at the same speed,\nnamely 300,000,000 meters (186,000 miles) per second. Our intuition for space\nand time is not correct \u2014 that\u2019s what Einstein figured out \u2014 and it is\npossible for there to be fields that are at rest with respect to all\nobservers! [In my book, I used the term \u201camotional\u201d to describe the universe\nand its fields.]\n\nAnd so a particle\u2019s mass is the same no matter what it is doing \u2014 stationary\nrelative to you or moving relative to you. And that\u2019s important, because a\nparticle is always stationary relative to itself! so it always, from its own\npoint of view, should have the same mass.\n\nAnalogies which refer to the particle\u2019s mass as having something to do with\nthe field being like molasses, or a room full of people, are deeply\nproblematic, because they make it seem as though a particle must be moving in\norder to feel the effect of Higgs field, whereas in fact that is not the case.\nEven worse, they violate the basic principles of relativity, those of Galileo\nand Einstein. [Again, carefully discussed in the book.]\n\n  * Since gravity pulls on things proportional to their mass, and since the Higgs field is responsible for giving everything its mass, there obviously must be a deep connection between the Higgs and gravity... right?\n\nA very reasonable guess, but \u2014 it turns out to be completely wrong. The\nproblem is that this statement combines a 17th century notion of gravity, long\nago revised, with an overly simplified version of a late-20th century notion\nof where masses of various particles comes from. Let me bring out my\nprofessorial training and correct the statement above with a red pen:\n\n  * Since gravity pulls on things proportional to their mass to a combination of their energy and momentum, and since the Higgs field is responsible of giving everything not everything, just the known elementary particles (excepting the Higgs particle itself) its rest mass its mass, there obviously must be a deep connection between the Higgs and gravity, right? wrong, there is no direct connection between the Higgs and gravity\n\nNow let me explain these corrections. [Yet again, carefully covered in the\nbook.]\n\nWhen you first learn about gravity in school, you learn Newton\u2019s law: that the\nforce of gravity between two objects, one of mass M_1 and one of mass M_2, has\na strength proportional to the product M_1 M_2.\n\nBut that was true before Einstein. It turns out that Newton\u2019s law needs to be\nrevised: the Einsteinian statement of the law is (roughly) that for two\nobjects that are slow-moving (i.e. their speed relative to one another is much\nless than c, the speed of light) and have energy E_1 and E_2, the\ngravitational force between them has a strength proportional to the product\nE_1 E_2.\n\nHow are these two statements, the Newtonian and the Einsteinian, consistent?\nThey are consistent because Einstein and his followers established that for\nany ordinary object, the relation between its energy E, momentum p and rest\nmass M [often just called \u201cmass\u201d by particle physicists] is\n\n  * E^2 = (p c)^2 + (M c^2)^2\n\nFor a slow-moving object, p \u2248 Mv (where v is the object\u2019s velocity) and pc \u2248\nMvc is much smaller than Mc^2. And therefore\n\n  * E^2 \u2248 (M c^2)^2 (i.e., E \u2248 M c^2 for slow objects)\n\nSince planets, moons, and artificial satellites all move with velocities well\nbelow 0.1% of c relative to each other and to the Sun, the gravitational\nforces between them are proportional to\n\n  * E_1 E_2 \u2248 M_1 M_2 c^4\n\nAnd since c is a constant, for such objects Einstein\u2019s law of gravity and\nNewton\u2019s law of gravity are completely consistent; the force law is\nproportional to the product of the energies and to the product of the masses,\nbecause the two are proportional to one another.\n\nBut for objects that have high speeds relative to one another, or for objects\nsubject to extremely strong gravitational pulls (which will quickly develop\nhigh speeds if they don\u2019t have them already), the Einsteinian law of gravity\ninvolves a complicated combination of momentum and energy, in which rest mass\ndoes not explicitly appear. This is why Einstein\u2019s version of gravity even\npulls on things like light, which is made from photons that have no rest mass\nat all. (And it is why gravitational waves \u2014 waves in space and time, massless\njust like light \u2014 can be formed by objects that are orbiting one another.)\nSimply put, the Einsteinian view of gravity, now reasonably well confirmed by\nexperiment, differs significantly from the Newtonian view, and in particular,\nit is not rest mass but energy and momentum which are primary. And all\nobjects, not matter what they are made from or how they are moving from your\npoint of view, have energy \u2014 so everything in the universe exerts a\ngravitational effect on everything else. We say \u201cgravity is a universal force\n\u201d(here the term is not referring not to the universe but to the notion of\nuniversality \u2014 of complete generality.)\n\nBy contrast, the Higgs field gives certain particles their rest mass. It\u2019s not\nuniversal; protons get their rest mass from something else.\n\nWhat about the Higgs field being the source for all mass in the universe? This\nstatement, though you will often find it in the press or in glib articles\nwritten for the public, is false.\n\nWhat is the true statement? Well, here is a list of the elementary particles\nthat we know about so far. The massless ones are\n\n  * photons, gluons, gravitons (the latter presumed to exist)\n\nwhile the ones with mass are\n\n  * W and Z particles\n  * quarks: top, bottom, charm, strange, up, down\n  * charged leptons: electrons, muons, taus\n  * neutrinos: three types (at least two and probably all three with small masses)\n  * the Higgs particle itself\n\nNow it is true that the W and Z particles, the quarks, the charged leptons and\nthe neutrinos must get their mass from a Higgs field. It\u2019s not possible for\nthem to have masses any other way. But this is not true of the Higgs particle\nitself.\n\nThe mass of the Higgs particle does not entirely come from the Higgs field!\n\nWhere does its mass come from? Oh, that\u2019s a long story, one that ends in a\nquestion rather than an answer. [It is discussed in a late chapter of my\nbook.] For now, suffice it to say that the mass of the Higgs particle does not\nhave a single, simple, understood source, and the curious feature is that its\nmass is so small \u2014 this is one aspect of the enormous puzzle called the\nhierarchy problem.\n\nBut in any case, the Higgs field is not the universal giver of mass to\nelementary particles. The Higgs particle itself gets its mass, at least in\npart, from elsewhere. And it probably isn\u2019t alone. It is very possible that\ndark matter is made from particles, and these too probably get at least part\nof their mass from another source. Dark matter is believed by most physicists\nand astronomers to be the majority of the matter in the universe; it is\nbelieved to provide the majority of the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy that we\ninhabit. The Higgs field likely provides little if any of that mass.\n\nOther things get their masses from sources other than the Higgs particle. The\nmajority of the mass of an atom is its nucleus, not its lightweight electrons\non the outside. And nuclei are made from protons and neutrons \u2014 bags of\nimprisoned or \u201cconfined\u201d quarks, antiquarks and gluons. These quarks,\nantiquarks and gluons go roaring around inside their little prison at very\nhigh speeds, and the masses of the proton and neutron are as much due to those\nenergies, and to the energy that is needed to trap the quarks etc. inside the\nbag, as it is due to the rest masses of the quarks and antiquarks contained\nwithin the bag. So the proton\u2019s and neutron\u2019s masses do not come predominantly\nfrom the Higgs field. [Experts: There is a subtlety here, having to do with\nhow the Higgs field affects the confinement scale; but even when it is\naccounted for, the statement remains essentially true.] So the mass of the\nEarth, or the mass of the Sun, would change, but not enormously, if there were\nno Higgs field... assuming they could hold together at all, which would not be\ntrue of the Earth.\n\nMeanwhile, black holes, some of which have the largest rest masses of any\nknown objects in the universe, holding court at the centers of galaxies, could\nin principle be made entirely from massless things. One can make a black hole\nentirely out of photons, in principle. In practice, most black holes are made\nfrom ordinary matter, but ordinary matter\u2019s mass is mostly from atomic nuclei,\nand as we just noted, that doesn\u2019t come entirely from the Higgs field.\n\nNo matter how you view it, the Higgs field is not the universal giver of mass\nto things in the universe: not to ordinary atomic matter, not to dark matter,\nnot to black holes. To most known fundamental particles, yes \u2014 and it is\ncrucial in ensuring that atoms exist at all. But there would be just as much\ninteresting gravitational physics going on in the universe if there were no\nHiggs field. There just wouldn\u2019t be any atoms, or any people to study them.\n\nFinally, you can ask more technically whether, in the equations that\nphysicists study, there is any mathematical connection between gravity and the\nHiggs field. The answer is no. Gravitational fields have spin 2 and are\ndescribed as part of space and time; they interact with all particles and\nfields in nature. The Higgs field, which has spin 0, only interacts directly\nwith elementary particles and fields that also participate in the\nelectromagnetic and weak nuclear forces.\n\nSo \u2014 the natural guess that the Higgs has something to do with gravity turns\nout to be false.\n\n  1. The Higgs field is not universal: it gives masses to most of the known elementary particles but not to the Higgs particle itself, and not to protons and neutrons, dark matter (most likely), or black holes,\n  2. Einstein\u2019s gravity is universal and has to do with energy and momentum but not mass directly, and most certainly does pull on protons and neutrons, dark matter and black holes even though their rest masses don\u2019t come entirely from the Higgs field.\n\nIt\u2019s really true: despite appearances at first glance, the relation between\ngravity and the Higgs isn\u2019t even skin deep.\n\n  * Since it makes sense to seek a fundamental explanation for the values of the *masses* of elementary particles, why do we not also seek explanations for the particular values of the *charge* and *spin* of these particles?\n\nWe do. But in quantum field theory (the type of equations used in particle\nphysics) mass turns out to be very different from charge and spin. The charge\nand spin of a particle are fixed; once specified, they are determined. But\nmass can be changed dynamically from zero to non-zero, and once non-zero the\nprecise value of a particle\u2019s mass is determined, in a very complex quantum\nmechanical way, by the strength and nature of that particle\u2019s interactions\nwith all of the other types of particles. [A similar complexity affects the\nstrengths of forces.] So the question of where the masses (and strengths of\nforces) come from turns out to be of a very different nature from the question\nwhere the charges and spins come from.\n\n## Fundamentals\n\n  * Has the Higgs field always been non-zero?\n\nThis depends on the history of the universe, which we don\u2019t know well enough\nyet. It is quite possible that there was an extremely short time when the\nuniverse was very hot and the Higgs field\u2019s value was close to zero; it is\neven possible there was an extremely short time when all of the fields we know\nabout were rearranged beyond recognition (as might happen in a different\nvacuum of the landscape of fields, sometimes called the \u201cstring theory\nlandscape\u201d but this need have nothing to do with string theory.) Or maybe it\nwas a long time. The history of the universe before the Big Bang became hot\nmay have been very short, or it may have been very long; we really have no\nidea.\n\nHowever, the Higgs field has been non-zero ever since the current universe-as-\nwe-know-it has been cooler than a few million billion degrees... since a tiny\nfraction of a second after the current Big Bang is naively thought to have\nbegun.\n\n  * Why do the equations of the Standard Model of particle physics not predict the Higgs particle\u2019s rest mass?\n\nThere are a number of unknown constants that appear in the Standard Model\u2019s\nequations. These include the strengths of the electromagnetic, weak nuclear\nand strong nuclear forces, and the numbers that (after the Higgs field becomes\nnon-zero) determine the various rest masses of the known particles. There are\na few other numbers that determine how some of those particles decay. And\nfinally, the Higgs particle\u2019s mass is not determined. Although not specified\nby the equations, most of these numbers have been learned though experiment...\nobviously the strengths of the forces and the masses of the various particles\nhave all been measured.\n\nYou might ask whether the Standard Model predicts anything, since so much has\nto be determined by experiment. The answer is: \u201cOh my goodness, yes!!!!\u201d We do\nhave to measure about 20 numbers first, but once that is done, the Standard\nModel makes tens of thousands of successful predictions, for a huge diversity\nof experiments over many decades. For instance: it predicts the W and Z\nparticles masses, and how often they are produced at experimental facilities\nsuch as LEP, Tevatron and the LHC; it predicts how quickly and to what\nparticles they decay; it predicts how all the other particles decay, in great\ndetail; it predicts the magnetic response of the electron to 12 decimal places\nand that of the muon to 8 or so; it predicts how often top quarks are produced\nand how, in detail, they decay ... I think I should stop here.\n\nTo get tens of thousands (perhaps more by now) of successful predictions out\nof 20 measured inputs is a huge success. But of course we do very much want to\nknow where these 20 or so inputs come from, and we hope the LHC and other\nongoing experiments will give us clues. One must also keep in mind that the\nStandard Model contains the simplest possible version of the Higgs field, and\nthat may well not be what nature actually possesses. So we\u2019re not just\ninterested in the Higgs boson\u2019s mass; we need to check how it behaves.\n\nSee http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-\nstandard-model-higgs/ and the various articles to which it links.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n## Recent Posts\n\nUpdate to the Higgs FAQ\n\nPeter Higgs versus the \u201cGod Particle\u201d\n\nStar Power\n\nDESI Shakes Up the Universe\n\nSpeaking at Harvard Tonight at 6pm\n\nTotal Eclipse a Week Away\n\n## Buy The Book\n\nA decay of a Higgs boson, as reconstructed by the CMS experiment at the LHC\n\nSubscribe for updates!\n\nFollow me\n\nX/Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nMatt Strassler\n\n\u00a9 2024 Of Particular Significance\n\n%d\n\n# Search results\n\nSort by:\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n## No results found\n\n## Filter options\n\n", "frontpage": false}
