Prior research has proposed\n> an approach that categorizes embeddings into popular and non-popular classes\n> to reduce the training time for recommendation models. We observe that, even\n> among the popular embeddings, certain embeddings undergo rapid training and\n> exhibit minimal subsequent variation, resulting in saturation. Consequently,\n> updates to these embeddings lack any contribution to model quality. This\n> paper presents Slipstream, a software framework that identifies stale\n> embeddings on the fly and skips their updates to enhance performance. This\n> capability enables Slipstream to achieve substantial speedup, optimize CPU-\n> GPU bandwidth usage, and eliminate unnecessary memory access. SlipStream\n> showcases training time reductions of 2x, 2.4x, 1.2x, and 1.175x across\n> real-world datasets and configurations, compared to Baseline XDL, Intel-\n> optimized DRLM, FAE, and Hotline, respectively.\n\nSubjects:| Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04270 [cs.IR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04270v1 [cs.IR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.04270arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yassaman Ebrahimzadeh Maboud [view email] [v1] Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:29:06\nUTC (2,646 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Accelerating Recommender Model Training by\nDynamically Skipping Stale Embeddings, by Yassaman Ebrahimzadeh Maboud and 3\nother authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.IR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
