Claude) (via) Hrishi Olickel\nis one of my favourite prompt whisperers. In this YouTube video he walks\nthrough his process for building quick interactive applications with the\nassistance of Claude 3, spinning up an app that analyzes his meeting\ntranscripts to extract participants and mentioned organisations, then presents\na UI for exploring the results built with Next.js and shadcn/ui.\n\nAn interesting tip I got from this: use the weakest, not the strongest models\nto iterate on your prompts. If you figure out patterns that work well with\nClaude 3 Haiku they will have a significantly lower error rate with Sonnet or\nOpus. The speed of the weaker models also means you can iterate much faster,\nand worry less about the cost of your experiments.\n\nPosted 9th April 2024 at 6:39 pm\n\n## Recent articles\n\n  * Building files-to-prompt entirely using Claude 3 Opus - 8th April 2024\n  * Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser - 30th March 2024\n  * llm cmd undo last git commit - a new plugin for LLM - 26th March 2024\n  * Building and testing C extensions for SQLite with ChatGPT Code Interpreter - 23rd March 2024\n  * Claude and ChatGPT for ad-hoc sidequests - 22nd March 2024\n  * Weeknotes: the aftermath of NICAR - 16th March 2024\n\nai 501 generativeai 435 llms 411 claude 26\n\n  * Source code\n  * \u00a9\n  * 2002\n  * 2003\n  * 2004\n  * 2005\n  * 2006\n  * 2007\n  * 2008\n  * 2009\n  * 2010\n  * 2011\n  * 2012\n  * 2013\n  * 2014\n  * 2015\n  * 2016\n  * 2017\n  * 2018\n  * 2019\n  * 2020\n  * 2021\n  * 2022\n  * 2023\n  * 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
