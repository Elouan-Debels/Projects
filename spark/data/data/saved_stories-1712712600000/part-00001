So far, the skeptics have been right more often than\nnot, and when they are right, they earn the right to call the alarm ringers\n\u201calarmists\u201d who have fomented a groundless moral panic, usually through\nsensational but rare (or non-existent) horror stories trumpeted by\nirresponsible media.\n\nBut the skeptics are not always right. I think it is a very good thing that\nalarms were rung about teen smoking, teen pregnancy, drunk driving, and the\nexposure of children to sex and violence on TV. The lesson of The Boy Who\nCried Wolf is not that after two false alarms we should disconnect the alarm\nsystem. In that story, the wolf does eventually come.\n\nThe question before us now, on the topic of teens and social media, is this:\nAre the skeptics correct that we are going through just one more groundless\nmoral panic over teens and tech in which adults are freaking out while, in\nfact, the harms are so minimal that they shouldn\u2019t be a cause for worry? Or\ndid the wolf really arrive around 2012, and has been mauling young people ever\nsince via their smartphones and social media accounts? (Of course, there are\nresearchers who reside in the space between these two perspectives.)\n\nPsychologist Candice Odgers has taken the skeptical side for many years now\n(along with researchers including Amy Orben, Andrew Przybylski, Jeff Hancock,\nChris Ferguson, and Aaron Brown), while Jean Twenge and I have been writing as\nalarm ringers. It has been a normal and productive academic debate. Engagement\nwith each other\u2019s arguments is how science makes progress. Even if we never\nconvince each other, the broader scientific and policy communities tune in to\nthe debate, and eventually, they\u2019ll move one way or the other.\n\nOdgers recently stated the skeptics' case in an essay in Nature titled The\nGreat Rewiring: Is Social Media Really Behind an Epidemic of Teenage Mental\nIllness? The essay offered a critique of my recent book, The Anxious\nGeneration. Odgers\u2019 primary criticism is that I have mistaken correlation for\ncausation and that \u201cthere is no evidence that using these platforms is\nrewiring children\u2019s brains or driving an epidemic of mental illness.\u201d She also\nwarns that my ringing of a false alarm \u201cmight distract us from effectively\nresponding to the real causes of the current mental-health crisis in young\npeople,\u201d which, she suggests, are social ills such as racism, economic\nhardship, and the lingering impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and its\ndisparate impact on children in low SES families.\n\nIn this response essay, I\u2019ll present the two main problems I see with the\nskeptics' approach, as exemplified in Odgers\u2019 review:\n\n  1. Odgers is wrong to say that I have no evidence of causation\n\n  2. Odgers\u2019 alternative explanation does not fit the available facts.\n\nShare\n\n##\n\n1) Odgers is wrong to say that I have no evidence of causation\n\nOdgers\u2019 central claim is that I have mistaken correlation for causation and\nthat I have \u201cno evidence\u201d that social media is a cause, rather than a mere\ncorrelate, of the current epidemic of adolescent mental illness. Odgers says\nthat I am just \u201cmaking up stories by simply looking at trend lines.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, when I entered this debate as a co-author of The Coddling of the\nAmerican Mind, it was true that the great majority of published studies on\n\u201cdigital media\u201d and mental health were correlational, and every social\nscientist knows that correlational studies often suggest to our intuitive\nminds a causal pathway that vanishes when experiments using random assignment\nare published. (Think of the changing guidance on the health effects of fat,\ncarbs, and red wine). But even in 2018 there were a few experimental studies\non social media and mental health. For example, college students who were\nasked to reduce their social media use for three weeks generally experienced\nmental health benefits compared to the control group. Zach Rausch, Jean\nTwenge, and I began to collect all the studies we could find in 2019, and we\norganized them by type: correlational, longitudinal, and experimental. We put\nall of our work online in Google Docs that are open to other researchers for\ncomment and critique. You can find all of our \u201ccollaborative review\u201d documents\nat AnxiousGeneration.com/reviews\n\nThe main document that collects studies on social media is here: Social Media\nand Mental Health: A Collaborative Review\n\nIn that document, we list dozens of correlational and longitudinal studies.\nThese large datasets provide us with correlation coefficients that tell us how\nvariables in the dataset are related to each other, and they tell us when and\nfor whom those relationships are stronger. Those studies reveal a fairly\nconsistent relationship in which heavy users of social media are at much\nhigher risk of mental illness or poor mental health than everyone else. A\nwidely cited 2018 study of 14-year-olds found that girls who spend five hours\nor more on social media per day are three times as likely to be depressed as\ngirls who use social media only a little or not at all. For boys, the ratio is\nlower, closer to two-to-one. A meta-analysis of 26 such studies found that the\nrisk of depression increased by 13% for each hour increase on social media for\nadolescents (and that increase was even higher for girls).1\n\nIn that document, we also list 22 experimental studies, 16 of which found\nsignificant evidence of harm (or of benefits from getting off of social media\nfor long enough to get past withdrawal symptoms). To give just a few examples:\n\n  1. Alcott and colleagues (2020) randomly assigned 2743 adults to either deactivate their Facebook accounts for one month or not. This study also found that deactivation significantly improved subjective well-being and that \u201c80% of the treatment group agreed that deactivation was good for them.\u201d The treatment group was also more likely to report using Facebook less and having uninstalled the app from their phones post-experiment.\n\n  2. Brailovskaia and colleagues (2022) have done one of the only studies I have seen that incorporate both social media reduction and physical activity increases. They randomly assigned 642 participants to (1) reduce social media use to 30 minutes a day for two weeks, (2) increase physical activity by 30 minutes a day for two weeks, (3) follow both instructions, or (4) do nothing. The researchers found the strongest effects within the combined condition (#3). This group reported the largest decreases in depressive symptoms and increases in life satisfaction and subjective happiness compared to other groups.\n\n  3. There are also a number of experiments that have looked at Instagram's unique negative impacts on women, including the finding that it is more harmful to women than is Facebook.\n\nIn that document, we also list nine quasi-experiments or natural experiments\n(as when high-speed internet arrives in different parts of a country at\ndifferent times), eight of which found evidence of harm to mental health,\nespecially for girls and women. (Odgers cited only the 9^th one, which relies\non a dataset that is made up of unreliable estimates that do not detect known\nrises in mental illness, as Zach showed here.) To give just one example:\nArenas-Arroyo and colleagues (2022) looked at the links between the staggered\nrollout of broadband internet in Spain between 2007-2019 and hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of behavioral and mental health cases of adolescents. They\nfound a significant effect of the arrival of high-speed internet, but only\namong adolescent girls.\n\nThere are also a number of studies showing mental health improvements,\nincreases in physical activity, and reductions in bullying when schools go\nphone-free\u2014one of the few natural experiments that specifically targets both\nadolescents and group-level effects. (These group-level effects are\nillustrated brilliantly here).\n\nI am not saying that academic debates are settled by counting up the number of\nstudies on each side, but bringing so many studies together in one place gives\nus an overview of the available evidence, and that overview supports three\npoints about problems with the skeptics\u2019 arguments.\n\nFirst, if the skeptics were right and the null hypothesis were true (i.e.,\nsocial media does not cause harm to teen mental health), then the published\nstudies would just reflect random noise2 and Type I errors (believing\nsomething that is false). In that case, we\u2019d see experimental studies\nproducing a wide range of findings, including many that showed benefits to\nmental health from using social media (or that showed harm to those who go off\nof social media for a few weeks). Yet there are hardly any such experimental\nfindings. Most experiments find evidence of negative effects; some find no\nevidence of such effects, and very few show benefits. Also, if the null\nhypothesis were true, then we\u2019d find some studies where the effects were\nlarger for boys and some that found larger effects for girls. Yet that\u2019s not\nwhat we find. When a sex difference is reported, it almost always shows more\nharm to girls and women. There is a clear and consistent signal running\nthrough the experimental studies (as well as the correlational studies), a\nsignal that is not consistent with the null hypothesis.\n\nSecond, and most germane to Odgers\u2019 review: She and the other skeptics are\nfree to critique the hundreds of studies Zach and I cite in our essays at\nAfter Babel and in chapters 1, 5, 6, and 7 of The Anxious Generation. They can\ncertainly say that they are not persuaded and that they will not be persuaded\nuntil the perfect experiment is done. But they cannot say that I am drawing\nonly on correlational studies, or that I have \u201cno evidence\u201d of causation, or\nthat I do not understand the difference between correlation and causation. I\nlaid out the evidence for causality (not just correlation) between social\nmedia use and mental health outcomes for girls and walked the reader through\nthe Google Doc and multiple kinds of evidence in this post in early 2023:\n\nSocial Media is a Major Cause of the Mental Illness Epidemic in Teen Girls.\nHere\u2019s the Evidence.\n\nI presented several conceptual problems with the skeptics\u2019 claims about\ncausality and evidence in this essay: Why Some Researchers Think I\u2019m Wrong\nAbout Social Media and Mental Illness. For example, I noted that the skeptics\nfocus on testing one narrow model of causality that treats social media\nconsumption as if it were an individual act, like consuming sugar, and then\nlooks for the size of the dose-response relationship in individuals. But much\nof my book is about the collective action traps that entire communities of\nadolescents fall into when they move their social lives onto these platforms,\nsuch that it becomes costly to abstain. It is at that point that collective\nmental health declines most sharply, and the individuals who try to quit find\nthat they are socially isolated. The skeptics do not consider the ways that\nthese network or group-level effects may obscure individual-level effects, and\nmay be much larger than the individual-level effects.\n\nThird, even beyond the published experiments, there is ample evidence of\ncausation that should be relevant to parents, lawyers, and legislators:\neyewitness testimony. When you ask members of Gen Z what they think is causing\ntheir high rates of mental illness, they often point to social media and\nparticularly Instagram as a major cause.3 (See section 4 of our main\ncollaborative review doc.) I have been searching for essays by members of Gen\nZ that defend social media and the phone-based childhood as being good for\nmental health. I can\u2019t find them, but I find plenty of members of Gen Z who\nsay that social media damaged them or their generation. Also relevant: many\nmembers of Gen Z are starting organizations to fight back.\n\nMeta collected some eyewitness testimony accidentally. In that famous internal\nstudy brought out by whistleblower Frances Haugen, the researchers found that\nInstagram is particularly bad for girls. They wrote: \u201cTeens blame Instagram\nfor increases in the rate of anxiety and depression. . . . This reaction was\nunprompted and consistent across all groups.\u201d Quantitative researchers such as\nOdgers are free to place less weight on qualitative studies, but they are a\nkind of evidence in social science research. They are relevant when we try to\nsort out multiple theories about causation, especially when the platforms will\nnot share data with scientists so the experts with the deepest insights into\nwhat social media is doing to teens are the teens themselves. They see it\nhappening. Do they count as \u201cno evidence\u201d since their claims are not peer-\nreviewed?\n\n##\n\n2) An Alternative That Does Not Work\n\nThe second major problem with Odgers\u2019 review is that she proposes an\nalternative to my \u201cgreat rewiring\u201d theory that does not fit the known facts.\nOdgers claims that the \u201creal causes\u201d of the crisis, from which my book \u201cmight\ndistract us from effectively responding,\u201d are longstanding social ills such as\n\u201cstructural discrimination and racism, sexism and sexual abuse, the opioid\nepidemic, economic hardship and social isolation.\u201d She proposes that the\nspecific timing of the epidemic, beginning around 2012, might be linked to the\n2008 Global Financial Crisis, which had lasting effects on \u201cfamilies in the\nbottom 20% of the income distribution,\u201d who were \u201calso growing up at the time\nof an opioid crisis, school shootings, and increasing unrest because of racial\nand sexual discrimination and violence.\u201d\n\nI agree that those things are all bad for human development, but Odgers\u2019\ntheory cannot explain why rates of anxiety and depression were generally flat\nin the 2000s and then suddenly shot upward roughly four years after the start\nof the Global Financial Crisis. Did life in America suddenly get that much\nworse during President Obama\u2019s second term, as the economy was steadily\nimproving?\n\nHer theory also cannot explain why adolescent mental health collapsed in\nsimilar ways around the same time in Canada, the UK, Australia, and New\nZealand, as Zach and I showed in this post:\n\nThe Teen Mental Illness Epidemic is International, Part 1: The Anglosphere\n\n###\n\nAdolescent Self-harm Episodes in Five Anglo Nations\n\nFigure 1. Since 2010, rates of self-harm episodes have increased for\nadolescents in the Anglosphere countries, especially for girls. For data on\nall sources and larger versions of the graphs, see Rausch and Haidt (2023).\n(Data for Canada is limited to Ontario province, which contains nearly 40% of\nthe population of Canada.)\n\nNor can she explain why it also happened at roughly the same time in the\nNordic countries, which lack most of the social pathologies on Odgers\u2019 list,\nas Zach and I showed in this post:\n\nThe Teen Mental Illness Epidemic is International, Part 2: The Nordic Nations\n\n###\n\nPercent of Nordic Teens with High Psychological Distress (Ages 11-15)\n\nFigure 2. Percent of Nordic Teens with High Psychological Distress. Data from\nthe Health Behavior in School-Age Children Survey (2002-2018). Graphs and data\nwere organized, analyzed, and created by Thomas Potrebny and Zach Rausch. See\n1.1.1 of Nordic Adolescent Mood Disorders since 2010.\n\nNor can she explain why it also happened in much, though not all, of Western\nEurope:\n\nThe Youth Mental Health Crisis is International Part 4: Europe\n\n###\n\nPercent of European Teens with High Psychological Distress by Country-Level\nIndividualism (Ages 11-15)\n\nFigure 3. Changes in psychological distress by high vs. low individualism of\neach country, split by sex. Source: Health Behavior in School-Age Children\nSurvey, 2002-2018 (See Zach\u2019s spreadsheet for data points) and Hofstede\nInsights.4\n\nNor can she explain why suicide rates for Gen Z girls (but not always boys)\nare at record levels across the Anglosphere, as we showed in this post:\n\nSuicide Rates Are Up for Gen Z Across the Anglosphere, Especially for Girls\n\n###\n\nRises in Suicide Among Adolescent Girls (Ages 10-19)\n\nFigure 4. All datasets and figures can be found in the post.\n\nIf Odgers was correct that the \u201creal causes\u201d of the epidemic are America\u2019s\nsocial ills, then we would not find these patterns in so many countries. I\njust can\u2019t see a causal path by which America\u2019s school shootings, lockdown\ndrills, poverty, or racism caused girls in Australia to suddenly start self-\nharming or dying by suicide at the same time as so many American girls.\n\nAn equally large problem for Odgers\u2019 explanation is that it commits her to the\nprediction that the increases in mental illness were largest for teens in low\nSES families. After all, her explanation for why there was a four-year delay\nbetween the onset of the GFC and the onset of the mental health crisis was\nbecause the effects lasted longer for those \u201cin the bottom 20% of the income\ndistribution,\u201d who \u201ccontinue to experience harm.\u201d\n\nJean Twenge tested Odgers\u2019 explanation by looking to see whether rates of\nmajor depressive episodes increased faster for teens in families below the\npoverty line (shown in red in Figure 5 below) versus those whose families\u2019\nincomes were at least double the poverty line (shown in blue). As you can see,\nthere was no difference between the two groups up through 2012 (which is\ncontrary to Odgers\u2019 thesis about the differential impacts of the GFC on mental\nhealth), and then a difference opened up after 2012, but in the opposite\ndirection of Odgers\u2019 prediction.\n\n###\n\nPercent of American Adolescents with Depression by Family Income Level (Ages\n12-17)\n\nFigure 5. Percent of U.S. 12- to 17-year-olds experiencing major depressive\nepisodes in the last 12 months, by family income level. Source: Data from the\nnationally representative National Survey of Drug Use and Health; analysis by\nJean M. Twenge for the Generation Tech Substack.5\n\nTwenge has also addressed 13 other possible explanations for the mental health\ncrisis and shows why they don\u2019t fit the data.\n\nIn short: Odgers has pointed to an alternative causal explanation that A) does\nnot fit the timing in the U.S., B) does not fit the social class data in the\nU.S., and C) does not fit the international scope of the crisis.\n\nShare\n\n##\n\nWhat Now?\n\nParents, teachers, and legislators cannot wait any longer; they want to do\nsomething about the ever-rising levels of anxiety, distraction, and suffering.\nWhose policy prescriptions should they follow, given the current state of the\nevidence and the relative risks and costs associated with each path?\n\nIf leaders and change-makers were to embrace Odgers\u2019 causal theory about the\n\u201creal causes\u201d rather than being \u201cdistracted\u201d by mine, then the way forward is\nto first solve society\u2019s biggest social problems, most of which we have been\nworking on for decades. Perhaps this time we\u2019ll make more progress, and in ten\nor twenty years, rates of teen mental illness will begin to decline.\n\nAnd if Odger\u2019s causal theory turns out to be wrong? We\u2019ll have spent another\ndecade or two locked in the usual culture war battles over spending on social\nprograms that may or may not be effective, and we will have lost another\ngeneration to mental illness.\n\nIn contrast, if leaders and change makers were to embrace my account of the\n\u201cgreat rewiring of childhood,\u201d in which the phone-based childhood replaced the\nplay-based childhood, what policy implications follow? That we should roll\nback the phone-based childhood, especially in elementary school and middle\nschool because of the vital importance of protecting kids during early\npuberty. More specifically, we\u2019d try to implement these four norms as widely\nas possible:\n\n  1. No smartphones before high school (as a norm, not a law; parents can just give younger kids flip phones, basic phones, or phone watches).\n\n  2. No social media before 16 (as a norm, but one that would be much more effective if supported by laws such as the proposed update to COPPA, the Kids Online Safety Act, state-level age-appropriate design codes, and new social media bills like the bipartisan Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, or like the state level bills passed in Utah last year and in Florida last month).\n\n  3. Phone-free schools (use phone lockers or Yondr pouches for the whole school day, so that students can pay attention to their teachers and to each other)\n\n  4. More independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world.\n\nNote that these four reforms, taken together, cost almost nothing, have strong\nbipartisan support, and can be implemented all right now, this year, if we\nagree to act collectively.\n\nAnd what if it turns out that I am wrong? What if, in reality, the\nmultinational collapse of adolescent mental health in the early 2010s was not\ncaused by the arrival of phone-based childhood; it was just a big coincidence.\nWill kids be damaged by these four norms? I don\u2019t think so. What irreversible\nharm will be done to children who spend more time listening to their teachers\nduring class, more time playing and exploring together outdoors, and less time\nsitting alone hunched over a device?\n\nWe are now 12 years into a public health emergency that began around 2012. In\nThe Anxious Generation, I offer a detailed explanation of what caused it\n(drawing on many academic fields) and a detailed path by which we can reverse\nit. I know of no plausible alternative explanation, nor have I found anyone\noffering a realistic alternative pathway out.\n\nWe certainly need skeptics to challenge alarm-ringers, who sometimes do ring\nfalse alarms. God bless the skeptics. But at a certain point, we need to take\naction based on the most plausible theory, even if we can\u2019t be 100% certain\nthat we have the correct causal theory. I think that point is now.\n\n1\n\nOdgers claims that the correlation is actually reverse correlation: depression\ncauses teens to spend more time on social media. It\u2019s true that some\nlongitudinal studies have found that an increase in depression precedes an\nincrease in time on social media, but other studies have found the reverse,\nand some have found that the relationship is bidirectional.\n\n2\n\nYes, there could be a \u201cfile drawer problem\u201d if researchers on one side are\nsystematically discouraged from publishing, so the missing \u201cpositive\u201d studies\nare all sitting in file drawers in researchers\u2019 offices. But because findings\nof benefits would be unusual and newsworthy, I don\u2019t believe that there is a\nstrong or consistent bias against the skeptics.\n\n3\n\nI focus here on eyewitness testimony from members of Gen Z, but there is ample\neyewitness testimony from teachers, and from parents, who see the effects of\nheavy phone use on classroom behavior, learning, and family life.\n\n4\n\nHigh individualistic countries include United Kingdom, Hungary, Netherlands,\nItaly, Belgium, Denmark, France, Sweden, Ireland, Latvia, and Norway. Low\nindividualistic countries include Austria, Slovakia, Spain, Russia, Greece,\nCroatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Portugal, Ukraine, and North Macedonia.\n\nMeasure for distress: We used a measure of high psychological distress from\nthe HBSC that includes four items that tap different symptoms of psychological\ndistress: feeling low, feeling nervous, feeling irritable, and having sleep\ndifficulties. Respondents rated how often they felt these four symptoms over\nthe last six months (1: Every day, 2: More than once/week; 3, About every\nweek; 4, Every month; 5, Rarely or never). We operationalized high\npsychological distress as having three or more of the four psychological\nailments every day or more than once a week over the last six months.\n\nUsing this measure, we computed the average psychological distress score in\neach country, for girls and for boys separately, in each of the 5 survey\nyears. This gave us two new datasets (one for girls, one for boys), each with\n33 rows (one for each country), which facilitated the various cross-country\ncomparisons that we report.\n\n5\n\nNote: This is a screening study of the population, not a study of diagnoses or\ntreatment. Thus the differences cannot be caused by willingness or ability to\nseek treatment. 2020 data was excluded as sampling times varied from other\nyears.\n\n### Subscribe to After Babel\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\nUsing moral psychology to explain why so much is going wrong\n\n151 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n21 Restacks\n\n151\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Yes, Social Media Really Is a Cause of the Epidemic of Teenage Mental\nIllness\n\nwww.afterbabel.com\n\n37\n\nShare\n\n37 Comments\n\nJim GeschkeQuoth the Maven5 hrs ago\u00b7edited 5 hrs agoLiked by Jon HaidtAs a\nteacher I saw the wolves arrive in my classroom around 2011-12.The wolves came\nin and stole my students' most precious asset -- their attention.
