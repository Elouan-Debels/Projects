It\u2019s Sheril Mathews from Leading Sapiens. Welcome to my newsletter, where\nI share strategies for getting savvier at the game of work.\n\nWant to get better at something? Pay attention to your repertoire of language\nin that domain. I examine this fundamental idea through the lens of\nneuroscience, philosophy, & peak performance.\n\nICYMI:\n\n  * Complex Outcomes, Simple Patterns\n\n  * Good Goals Gone Bad\n\n##\n\nForces & nuances\n\n> As I rode up on the ski lift for my first lesson, feeling somewhat\n> apprehensive, the instructor turned to me and said \u201cMy job is to teach\n> people to love gravity.\u201d It was a startling introduction, but perfectly\n> captured what I was to learn.\n>\n> When you stand at the top of a steep slope, nervously looking down, you are\n> aware that gravity is definitely going to take you to the bottom, and the\n> only question is whether you will do it in fine style or as a tumbling heap\n> risking broken bones. You cannot ski at all on flat ground, and the skill he\n> taught was how you must stand and balance and let gravity do its work,\n> adapting yourself to the forces in play. He was right \u2013 when you get the\n> hang of it you really do love it. And the more you love it, the deeper your\n> skill becomes, and the more freedom you have.\n>\n> All types of skill teach us the same deep truth: that the more we can\n> immerse ourselves into the forces at play the more freedoms we have.\n>\n> We have all seen great players in sport when they are \u2018in the zone\u2019, or\n> musicians giving a memorable performance, and been aware of how much time\n> they seem to have, how they have a freedom of movement and expression that\n> we can only dream of. In fact, studies show that the movements of a skilled\n> performer are much more varied than those of the amateur.\n>\n> \u2014 Bill Sharpe in Three Horizons\n\n  * Problem vs conditions of the game. One of the forces at play at work is often dysfunction and politics. Like gravity, it\u2019s not going anywhere and it just \u201cis\u201d. You can treat it as something that \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d be there and an impediment to your work. OR you can treat it as simply part of playing the game.\n\n  * Immersion vs resistance. The more we can harness the forces instead of fighting them, the better we can play the game.\n\n  * Poor vs rich repertoire. The vocabulary and nuances of the pro are much more varied than the amateur\u2019s. A skilled hand surgeon\u2019s understanding of your hand is very different from the layperson\u2019s at many levels. The same applies to your understanding of organizations and how to operate within them.\n\n##\n\nYour terministic screen\n\nAll of us have peculiar ways of interpreting things that\u2019s largely driven by\nour vocabulary, educational background, and culture. This means the same\nsituation will be experienced very differently based on our unique\ninterpretations.\n\nThe key driver behind that interpretation is language:\n\n> A person\u2019s way of seeing a situation is filtered through what scholar\n> Kenneth Burke calls a \u2018\u2018terministic screen.\u2019\u2019 This screen itself is made up\n> of language\u2014words, terms, phrases, and their relation to each other. This\n> screen directs our attention to aspects of reality. We don\u2019t see the world,\n> we don\u2019t see the terministic screen; instead, we see what the screen allows\n> us to see.\n>\n> \u2014 Steven Zaffron, Dave Logan in Three Laws of Performance\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\n> ...suppose we assemble an economist, a psychologist, and a sociologist in\n> the college cafeteria and ask each to give explanations of food choices made\n> by a customer. Suppose further that the customer we observe happens to\n> select custard rather than either cake or pie.\n>\n> The economist might explain that, because custard is less \u201clabor intensive\u201d\n> and therefore cheaper than the other desserts, it was the only dessert the\n> customer could afford. The psychologist might explain the choice by means of\n> the customer\u2019s history; for instance, he or she might say that the\n> customer\u2019s \u201cpast reinforcement schedule\u201d provides the answer. The\n> sociologist might explain the choice by pointing to the \u201cethno-social\n> background\u201d of the customer and showing how different classes of people\n> favor different desserts. . . . Thus, the terministic screen of vocabulary\n> causes each to focus on elements and interpretations of the situation to the\n> exclusion of others.\n>\n> \u2014 Phillip Tompkins\n\nYour terministic screen about work & organizations will largely determine:\n\n  * how you interpret it\n\n  * what parts you notice\n\n  * whether you see or miss the leverage points\n\n  * if you feel capable or powerless\n\nGiven the way things look to us, our conclusions and actions seem obvious.\nChanging what appears obvious now requires changing the screen that lies\nfurther upstream.\n\nSimilarly, your audience and stakeholders have their own set of terministic\nscreens. If your proposition doesn\u2019t line up with theirs, your ideas will not\nget traction.\n\n##\n\n\u201cGetting it\u201d vs not\n\nWhen we upgrade our vocabulary and mental models and start executing on them,\nwe start getting \u201cdistinctions\u201d:\n\n> Getting a distinction is like what happens as you learn to ski. When you\n> first stand at the top of a slope and look down all you see is a lot of snow\n> and a really steep drop-off. As you practice and become more expert, you\n> begin to be able to see differences between one slope and another. Standing\n> at the top of a slope you see moguls and other subtle variations in the\n> terrain that make for easier or more difficult paths down the mountain. In\n> addition, the mountain no longer seems so steep.\n>\n> These characteristics of the mountain were always there, but before you just\n> didn\u2019t see them. That\u2019s what getting a distinction does.\n>\n> \u2014 Steve Zaffron\n\nThe way you see your organization today is not the only way. There are nuances\nand aspects you\u2019re not noticing, and that includes potential points of\nproactive action.\n\nYour vocabulary and mental models act as frames and maps for viewing your\norganization. This in turn defines the limits of your actions and what you see\nas possible.\n\nWhat we do not have a language for, is simply not accessible to us.\n\n##\n\nGranularity\n\nThe latest in neuroscience shows that our brains are predictive machines\nrather than reactive. And our ability to predict well and thus respond better\nis contingent on our familiarity with concepts and the number of distinctions\nwe carry.\n\nNeuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett explains it this way in the context of\nemotions:\n\n> In many cultures, you will find people who have hundreds, perhaps thousands\n> of emotion concepts, that is, they exhibit high emotional granularity.\n>\n> In English, for example, they might have concepts for anger, sadness, fear,\n> happiness, surprise, guilt, wonder, shame, compassion, disgust, awe,\n> excitement, pride, embarrassment, gratitude, contempt, longing, delight,\n> lust, exuberance, and love, to name a few.\n>\n> They\u2019ll also have distinct concepts for interrelated words like\n> \u201caggravation,\u201d \u201cirritation,\u201d \u201cfrustration,\u201d \u201chostility,\u201d \u201crage,\u201d and\n> \u201cdisgruntlement.\u201d This person is an emotion expert. A sommelier of emotion.\n>\n> Each word corresponds to its own emotion concept, and each concept can be\n> used in the service of at least one goal, but usually many different goals.\n> If an emotion concept is a tool, then this person has a gigantic toolbox fit\n> for a skilled craftsperson.\n\nShe then compares this skilled craftsperson of emotions to folks with medium\nor low emotional granularity, who have the equivalent of a few hundred, or\neven worse, only a few dozen. Their ability to respond is markedly different:\n\n> Words seed your concepts, concepts drive your predictions, predictions\n> regulate your body budget, and your body budget determines how you feel.\n>\n> ...Therefore, the more finely grained your vocabulary, the more precisely\n> your predicting brain can calibrate your budget to your body\u2019s needs.\n>\n> In fact, people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor\n> less frequently, use medication less frequently, and spend fewer days\n> hospitalized for illness. This is not magic; it\u2019s what happens when you\n> leverage the porous boundary between the social and the physical.\n\nThe same is true for work and organizations. The better your \u201corganizational\ngranularity\u201d about how to work inside them, the more effective you are at\nnavigating the inevitable ups and downs.\n\n##\n\nSpeaking differently instead of arguing well\n\n> ... a talent for speaking differently, rather than arguing well, is the\n> chief instrument of cultural change. ...The method is to redescribe lots and\n> lots of things in new ways...\n>\n> \u2014 Richard Rorty\n\nOrganizations are very much cultures onto themselves. The mistake is to argue\nwell from logic alone.\n\nInstead, if you can speak frequently, variedly, and consistently, you will get\nfar more traction. Whether it\u2019s a new initiative you want to champion, or\nbetter positioning your own role in the org, it takes a lot more creativity\nand persistence than we realize.\n\nHow do you learn to speak differently? By upgrading your vocabulary and the\ngranularity of your understanding of organizations.\n\nThat does it for this edition. I\u2019d love for you to join me in my course\nstarting April 2nd.
