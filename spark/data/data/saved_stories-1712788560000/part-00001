This\nincludes the entire spectrum of moral and ethical standards of life for\nChechens.\"\n\n### Main Character of the Day\n\n### There's a 'volume war' happening in music\n\nRussian media report that artists have until June 1 to rewrite any music that\ndoesn't conform to the new rule, though it's not clear how it will be\nenforced.\n\nChechnya is a roughly 6,700-square-mile autonomous republic situated in the\nNorth Caucasus of southern Russia and home to some 1.5 million people, the\nvast majority of whom are Muslim. Its leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has consistently\nquashed dissent in the territory since he came to power in 2007 \u2014 nominated by\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he remains close.\n\nOver the years, dissidents, human rights activists and journalists \u2014 as well\nas their family members \u2014 in Chechnya have faced threats and reported\ninstances of abduction, arbitrary detention and death. Chechen authorities\nalso orchestrated what Human Rights Watch describes as \"lethal purges of men\nperceived to be gay or bisexual\" in 2017 and 2019. (Kadyrov said in 2017, \"We\ndon't have any gays ... If there are any, take them to Canada.\")\n\n### Europe\n\n### Russia's wars in Chechnya offer a grim warning of what could be in Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has said Kadyrov's\nregime \"maintains hegemony through the imposition of a purported 'traditional'\nversion of Islam, which falsely claims to defend local belief and culture, and\ncombat violent extremism.\"\n\n\"In reality, Kadyrov has [co-opted] Chechen religion and culture to support\nhis brutal regime, which violates the secular constitution of the Russian\nFederation and international standards of freedom of religion or belief,\" it\nadded.\n\nWhile Chechnya waged two wars against Russia for its independence in the 1990s\nand early 2000s, it remains part of Russia and is now seen as its close ally\nin the war against Ukraine. Even so, it's held on to its language and culture,\nin which folklore plays a major role. Traditional Chechen music includes\ninstrumental songs and epic ballads, according to the Guardian.\n\nThe government's crackdown on certain musical tempos would silence most modern\nmusic genres. Electronic styles of music like house, techno and dubstep all\ntend to have BPMs of over 116, says the audio tech company Izotope, while the\naverage tempo of 2020's best-selling pop songs was 122 BPM, according to the\nBBC.\n\n### Simon Says\n\n### Opinion: The Taliban is cracking down on music, and joy\n\nThe independent Russian news outlet Meduza said the tempo of the Russian\nnational anthem would be considered too slow under the new limit, reports\nRadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty. But it would seem to permit hip-hop music, which\ngenerally has a BPM of 85 to 95.\n\nSome songs that would fit the bill include Beyonce's \"Texas Hold 'Em\" (110\nBPM), the Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive\" (104 BPM), Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to\nHeaven\" (82 BPM), ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\" (101 BPM) and Taylor Swift's\n10-minute version of \"All Too Well\" (94 BPM), among others.\n\nHere are examples of songs that wouldn't:\n\nToo slow:\n\n  * \"Little Wing\" by Jimi Hendrix (71 BPM)\n  * \"Don't Worry Be Happy\" by Bobby McFerrin (69 BPM)\n  * \"Rehab\" by Amy Winehouse (72 BPM)\n  * \"I Will Always Love You\" by Whitney Houston (68 BPM)\n  * \"Imagine\" by John Lennon (76 BPM)\n  * \"Hello\" by Adele (79 BPM)\n\nToo fast:\n\n  * \"Here Comes the Sun\" by the Beatles (129 BPM)\n  * \"Cruel Summer\" by Taylor Swift (170 BPM)\n  * \"16 Carriages\" by Beyonce (127 BPM)\n  * \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana (117 BPM)\n  * \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears (143 BPM)\n  * \"Hotel California\" by the Eagles (147 BPM)\n\n  * music ban\n  * Chechnya\n  * Music\n  * Russia\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 157 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
