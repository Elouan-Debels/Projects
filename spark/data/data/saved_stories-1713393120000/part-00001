He began as a nomadic busker before becoming a virtuoso\nand then a romanticised Parisian sepia memory, who still calls out in rolling\narpeggios from the grooves of a crackling wax disc. A Romani nomad who would\novercome great adversity in life to astound audiences with his genius and\ntechnique, he would influence all that would come after him with woven\nmelodies that danced and sang from his fingertips. He would travel a murky\nroad through prejudice and fame, and then survive Nazi occupation through\nWorld War II only to succumb to a brain hemorrhage at age 43. He is remembered\nas the embodiment of European jazz and a cultural icon of musical freedom.\nLet\u2019s put the spotlight on Django...\n\n1927 Django Rhinehart Family\n\nBorn Jean Reinhardt on the 23^rd of January 1910 in Belgium, to the Manouche,\npart of the Romani people, he would go by his other name of Django all his\nlife. The Manouche were the nomadic people that had travelled and lived\nthroughout northern France and Belgium since the 18^th century living in\ncaravans and the open air as they moved from place to place in their itinerant\nexistence. Django was born on the road and would stay on the road most of his\nlife as is the existence of the coveted musician, Django and Jean, two names\nfor two lives. He would grow up living a life of impoverished freedom that\nwould give him little formal education but enrich his life with music amongst\nhis family and culture.\n\nDjango Reinhardt & Emile Savitry \u00e0 Toulon 1921\n\nHe would begin with the violin at age 8, switching to the banjo when he was\n12; encamped outside the old walls of Paris, he was playing folk and Bal-\nmusette, an early form of French instrumental music used for dances. Django\nplayed and learned from those around him; countless hours of practice and\nperformance around the campfires and lamp lights in the caravans of his youth.\nHe played with his brothers, his father, and uncle who were all musicians, and\ntoured towns and villages performing for anyone who would part with a few\ncoins for the hat. By 15, he was playing professionally scraping together\nenough money to survive by playing dance halls and caf\u00e9s accompanying\naccordion players and violinists. American swing jazz had started to seep into\nthe musical culture in Europe, threading its tendrils into the folk and\ntraditional gypsy music that Django was already performing. The word was\nspreading from town to town, there was a traveling prodigy a young guitarist\nwho was astounding audiences with his flair and talent.\n\nIn 1928 at the age of 17, three things happened to Django, and one of these\nwould change his life forever. One: He would marry Florine \u201cBella\u201d Mayer, a\ngirl from the site he returned to outside of Paris. Two: He would make his\nfirst musical recording with the accordionist Jean Vaissade. And three: he\nwould almost lose his life in a caravan fire; a candle accidentally into a\npile of handmade celluloid flowers Django\u2019s wife had made for a funeral that\nwould almost become theirs. The caravan they had just begun their married life\nin was engulfed in flames. Florine was pregnant with their first child and\nthey were both lucky to get away with their lives; but Django was badly\nburned. He was taken to hospital where the doctors told him he had received\n2^nd and 3^rd degree burns over the lower half of his body, would have to have\nhis leg amputated and would never play the guitar again.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDistrustful of doctors and perhaps believing more in the traditional medicine\nof his culture, he refused to believe the diagnoses. After his exit from the\nhospital, the smoke had settled and the cost had been counted, but Django\ncouldn\u2019t work. A promising touring opportunity had evaporated in his absence\nand his wife had left and gone back to her family. A dark time of the soul\nensued, that perhaps many would not have found their way through. But what\nhappened next would cast Django Reinhardt into the realms of musical folklore.\n\nDjango Reinhardt \u2013 Hotel Claridge 1934\n\nJoseph, Django\u2019s youngest brother arrived with a new steel strung guitar,\nwhich possessed more natural amplification than the nylon or gut string folk\ninstrument he\u2019d used previously This meant Django could play louder using less\nattack from his hands. Next, Django had to develop a new way of playing using\nonly two fingers; his left hand or his chord hand had lost the use of the\nlittle finger and his third finger. Now he had to reinvent his style as well\nas how the guitar was approached. He went for it, and by doing so, invented\nhis now famous sound and technique.\n\nHe would discover new chord voicings and chordal alternations to suit his\ndisability and with this find, his uniquely personal style and sound. It was a\nlong road to recovery, that would have taken hours upon hours of painful\nrelearning; something that had always felt part of him was now fighting\nagainst his touch.\n\nBy 1931, three years after the accident, he was busking in the streets again\nwhen he was noticed by the artist \u00c9mile Savitry, who would befriend and\nchampion the traveling musician and turn him on to the great American jazz\nmusicians like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Lonnie Johnson. Django\nwould then meet the person, who he would he would go on to make some of the\nmost innovative and celebrated European jazz with, the violinist St\u00e9phane\nGrappelli. Together they formed the Quintette du Hot Club de France, which\nincluded Django\u2019s brother Joseph on guitar, and bassist Louis Vola.\n\nThey had given birth to Manouche or \u2018Gypsy jazz\u2019, a variation of the music\nthat had been born in New Orleans and now was spreading around the world as\nswing. Not wishing to compete with the American use of brass and reed\ninstruments, Django and partners had developed a unique take on the new sound;\ntheir swing was made using string instruments and rhythmic nuances, and they\ninterwove their \u201cla pompe\u201d strumming, decorating the sound with sweeping\narpeggios.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDjango with Louis Armstrong\n\nDjango was free to let loose and solo with his two fingers flying up and down\nthe fretboard of his guitar, mesmerizing all who saw it. He had mixed American\njazz with his love of the music he had grown up on, and made it his own. The\nband would become hugely popular touring throughout Europe. Other musicians\nwould come and go in the quartet, with Django and Grappelli remaining the\ncore. While touring in England, World War II broke out. For centuries, the\nrights of the Romani people had been limited in Europe, systematically eroded;\nbut under encroaching Nazi control, they were identified and branded with a\nBrown triangle, sterilized, and then herded into controlled camps. Eventually,\nthey would be worked to death by forced labor, or sent to concentration camps\nto suffer the same demise as others the Nazis had declared enemies of the\nstate.\n\nAdded to that, jazz itself had labeled as fremdl\u00e4ndisch (alien) music by\nHitler. The f\u00fchrer had a fear of anything that wasn\u2019t German, let alone born\nfrom people deemed as an inferior race. Joseph Goebbels, Hitler\u2019s propaganda\nminister was a little more pragmatic, he knew that jazz was wildly popular\nwith the German people and troops alike, and that in the pressure cooker that\nwas war, it may be better to let the people dance. When Django returned to an\noccupied Paris in 1939, he was at the height of his popularity, but he was\ngoing to have to play to the people who were instrumental in trying to wipe\nout his culture. Paris had become a playground of the Nazis when on R&R during\nthe war and he would now have to walk a tightrope between performance and\nsubservience, knowing that at any point they would have the power to add him\nand his family to a list or to have him shot. So maybe Django did play for his\nlife and in doing so, his popularity hit its zenith. He lived lavishly, earned\na fortune, spent a fortune, and made music like \u2018Nuages\u2019 that would become an\nunofficial French anthem for freedom and liberation. His German officer fan\nbase tried to secure him performance dates in Berlin but Django managed to\navoid ever doing so.\n\nBy 1943, Django was married again and had a son. The tide of war was turning\nfor the Nazis and life in Paris was deteriorating, food was scarce and people\nwere disappearing or fleeing. Django decided to try and get his family out,\nthey fled to the Swiss border only to be caught by a German patrol. Thinking\nthis may be the end for him and his family, he was surprised when the officer\nin charge turned out to be a fan and sent them all back.\n\nA few days later, again they tried to cross the border, only to be turned away\nby the Swiss guards in an apparent anti \u2018gypsy\u2019 policy that saw Django and his\nfamily trapped. Miraculously they would survive the war, Django had played his\nway through adversity with sheer talent and a bit of luck too. Those who would\nhave normally persecuted him, celebrated him instead.\n\nDjango Reinhardt and Duke Ellington 1939\n\nDjango Reinhardt & Edith Piaf 1942\n\nEventually, he would make it to America, tour with the great Duke Ellington\namongst others, but would struggle with a language barrier, not just vocally\nbut musically. Django was largely illiterate and couldn\u2019t read sheet music. He\nhad always made music freely from the heart, but in America, the communication\nbreakdown left Django disappointed.\n\nAl Sears, Shelton Hemphill, Junior Raglin, Django Reinhardt, Lawrence Brown,\nHarry Carney, and Johnny Hodges, Aquarium, New York, 1946\n\nHis reputation as the best jazz guitarist anyone had witnessed was coupled\nwith his growing reputation for being unreliable. In Europe, where he was\nadored, he\u2019d taken to not showing up for gigs, not showing up with his guitar,\nor just disappearing. Django was known to go wandering on the open road, it\nwas something that was part of his DNA; he could not remain tied to one place.\nIn 1953, on his way back from a performance, he suffered a brain haemorrhage\nand collapsed by the front door of a house in Fontainebleau that was his fixed\naddress. He had been suffering from headaches for some time but as was his\ncharacter, refused to go to the doctor. When he was eventually taken to the\nhospital, he was pronounced dead on arrival, he was 43.\n\nIn 1965, a 17-year-old factory worker from Birmingham, England suffered an\nindustrial accident that took off the ends of two fingers. It was the last day\nof his day job before he was to start a professional career as a guitarist on\ntour. He was devastated after the doctors told him he would never play again,\nuntil his boss from the factory turned up with a record and told him a story.\nThe record was Django Reinhardt\u2019s. The injured factory worker was Tony Iommi\nof Black Sabbath. He would be inspired by his story and just like Django,\npersevered and overcame his injury to find stardom.\n\nDjango Reinhardt would fascinate and influence generations after him, from\nJimi Hendrix to Jeff Beck, Willie Nelson to George Harrison. He would make\nover 900 recordings in his career and become a mythical figure who overcame\nall the odds and impairment to dazzle and astound. He lives on in jazz clubs\nand record collections, around campfires, and in the music of his descendants\nwho continue to keep what he created alive today.\n\n## Words by Liam Ward\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSHARE\n\nFacebook\n\nF\n\nTwitter\n\nT\n\nPinterest\n\nP\n\n## FROM THE ARCHIVES\n\n## YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\n13 Things I Found on the Internet Today (Vol. 690)\n\n13 Things I Found on the Internet Today (Vol. 691)\n\nParis Restaurant Guide\n\nUnlock the Vault\n\nWeekend & City Guides\n\nUnlock the Vault\n\nABOUT NESSY\n\nMum & Dad named me Vanessa, but you can call me Nessy.\n\n## INSTAGRAM\n\n### messynessychic\n\nSorry to interrupt the people-watching content but\n\nLoad More...
