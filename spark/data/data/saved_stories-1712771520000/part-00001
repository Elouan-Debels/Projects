I will take you on an adventure with me, but I need your\nimagination, it's a quick experience, so let\u2019s start.\n\nClose your eyes and envision Homo erectus, our ancient ancestor, discovering\nfire, our first true piece of technology. Surely, the exhilaration they felt\nmirrored our own upon witnessing such transformative power. Humankind\nwitnessed such power for the first time, a power to transform, destroy, and\ncreate within them. Our struggle for survival became more interesting.\n\nThe thrill of discovering something new excites you, just like it does for me.\nSo, I'll give you a remote control to explore humanity's greatest discoveries.\nEnjoy the journey! You'll see everything from fire and stone tools to the\nwheel and gunpowder. Then, things got even more interesting in the 19th\ncentury with the steam engine, railways, and the light bulb! In the 20th\ncentury, you'll witness inventions like the automobile, television, nuclear\npower, spacecraft, the Internet, and finally, in the 21st century, the rise of\nartificial intelligence! You'll be amazed at how far we've come. So, when you\nopen your eyes, you'll likely say, \"Humans are gods!\"\n\nI smile in agreement. Now, close your eyes again. Here is another remote\ncontrol that takes you through human conflicts. You see Homo sapiens hunting\neach other out of blind fear, followed by Bronze Age wars and Rome's\nconquests. The Mongol Conquests and the Hundred Years' War captivate you.\nThen, the World Wars era arrived, with its massive conflicts \u2013 World War II\nwhich resulted in millions of deaths, then many conflicts and wars coming\nafter such as the Cold War, Vietnam, Iraq, Ukraine, and Gaza. You grow weary,\nasking, \"But why?\"\n\nYou're disappointed in humanity. How can greed and power-seeking lead to such\nconflicts throughout history? You feel conflicted \u2013 grateful for humanity's\nachievements, yet disappointed in its actions. Knowing geopolitical conflicts\ncould lead to nuclear war worsens your feelings. You ask, \"What now?\"\n\nWell, now it\u2019s time to tell you my personal experience with the hurtful\nadvancing civilization. I was born in a city that turned into an open-air\nprison, where my people were killed and displaced from their homes for years.\nIn fact I just escaped a very brutal war after 145 days of being desperately\nstuck there, where I lost family members, friends, and home. I was so close to\nlosing myself. Fortunately, I survived. Now, I\u2019m living in Europe, where I\nshould thrive in life, but wait. My family and two million innocent people are\nstuck there for more than 6 months, facing constant death from unceasing\nbombing and starvation. But you know what? Death is not the main issue; it's\nthe voices inside their heads. After a couple of months of being stuck in a\nwar, you will start to hear voices inside your head: Why do we have to suffer?\nWhy always us? Where is God in all of this? Why isn't the great West stopping\nthis genocide? Why do kids get killed? Why don't people have the choice to\nlive a normal, peaceful life? And so on.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s so hard to think about it. I grew up dreaming of making the world\na better place. I always looked up to the greatest inventors. I like humanity,\nand I\u2019m aware of its flaws. Yet, this doesn\u2019t justify us continuing this\nuseless fighting. For me, it\u2019s hard to dream of a great world while my mom\ncould be killed at any moment from random bombing, or when more than two\nmillion innocent people have been without enough water, food, electricity, and\nany type of safety for more than six months now!\n\nBut to be honest, sometimes I feel very lucky. I mean, I survived more than\nfive wars and made it out to Europe, so I just witnessed the worst conditions\na human can live in. After many years of gray and misery, here I am on the\nbright side. I should be happy, but I\u2019m not. Experiencing this war changed me\ncompletely. Death was so close many times, which made me question everything\nabout my life and myself. Death is horrifying in the young; for me, I didn\u2019t\nmind dying, but my only concern was that if I died today, my life would have\namounted to nothing. Well, I have had a good career so far, but zero impactful\nachievements can be named after me. The fact that I didn\u2019t impact anyone\u2019s\nlife in a good way hurts me to the bone because I know I have the ideas and\nthe energy to do so.\n\nNow, you might think how naive I am, but honestly, I believe that sometimes\nyou need to be a bit naive to live peacefully. When we try to make the world a\nbetter place while knowing that others make it worse, it's necessary to be\nnaive so you can push through it. I\u2019m aware of the suffering we humans cause\neach other, but we need to try our best to push civilization forward and\nreduce the suffering of others.\n\nSo, what's next? I'm not sure. I'm a 28-year-old uncivilized boy, with a huge\namount of energy, who is willing to commit to making the world a better place\nfor all and making life less suffering for the oppressed ones all around the\nworld. But, the truth is that I need to change myself first; this war showed\nme how weak I am. I wasn\u2019t solid when death was close, and my ego got broken,\nwhich is good. This showed me that I\u2019m full of flaws, and this war pointed me\nto them, so it\u2019s time to fix them while I\u2019m trying to achieve my goals. Big\ngoals require doers, not just talkers. For me, it's time to act\n\nFor you, my friend, I urge you to empathize with those in \"third world\"\ncountries. They face hardships they didn't choose. Please understand their\nstruggles and offer help whenever possible. To conclude, I'll leave you with a\nquote from Robert F. Kennedy's speech:\n\nThere is discrimination in this world and slavery and slaughter and\nstarvation. Governments repress their people; millions are trapped in poverty\nwhile the nation grows rich and wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere.\nThese are differing evils, but they are the common works of man. They reflect\nthe imperfection of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion, our\nlack of sensibility towards the suffering of our fellows. But we can perhaps\nremember -- even if only for a time -- that those who live with us are our\nbrothers; that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they\nseek -- as we do -- nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose\nand happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can.\n\n> Here is another post I wrote while I was stuck in the war: \u201cThis War Cannot\n> Be The End Of My Story\u201d\n\n### Subscribe to Mahmoud\u2019s Substack\n\nBy Mahmoud Alwadia \u00b7 Launched 2 hours ago\n\nMy personal Substack\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Hurtful Advancing Civilization: A Personal Reflection\n\nmahmoudalwadia.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Mahmoud Alwadia\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
