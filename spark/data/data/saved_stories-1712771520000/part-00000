A Canadian regulator\nsaid last year that BF Borgers violated its rules for auditors, while the US\u2019s\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board found multiple deficiencies in every\naudit it reviewed from the firm over the past two annual checks.\n\nClosely held companies often retain audit firms after going public through\nmergers with blank-check companies. But most of BF Borgers\u2019s clients, such as\nLingerie Fighting Championships Inc., a mixed martial arts league, are\nsignificantly smaller than Trump\u2019s media business. Its deficiency rate from\nthe PCAOB was worse than the industry rate of 40% in 2022, and the December\nenforcement action from Canada\u2019s audit regulator prevents it from accepting\nnew clients in that country until it makes certain improvements.\n\nA representative for BF Borgers didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for\ncomment.\n\nTrump Media said in a statement that articles about BF Borgers\u2019s record were\npartisan and \u201cpreemptively attacking our auditors before they\u2019ve even begun\ntheir work for us as a public company.\u201d\n\nTMTG has used the firm since 2022 as it sought to go public by merging with\nDigital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company. PCAOB\ninspections haven\u2019t yet covered BF Borgers\u2019s audits of Trump Media.\n\nRead more: Trump Media Is Now the Most Expensive US Stock to Bet Against\n\nTrump owns most of TMTG\u2019s stock, and its listing on the Nasdaq netted the\nformer president a multibillion-dollar windfall. After a surge in its share\nprice the company is now valued at roughly $5 billion. Shares in the company\nfell 10% to $36.52 at 1:04 p.m. in New York on Monday.\n\n## Audit Report Card\n\nSmall or foreign audit firms often have high deficiency rates, and are\ntypically only examined every three years by PCAOB inspectors. However, BF\nBorgers is a prolific auditor with more frequent examinations. Last year, it\nranked No. 8 on a list of audit firms with the most publicly traded clients,\nwith just nine fewer clients than midtier firm BDO USA, according to research\nfirm Ideagen Audit Analytics. Among the 10 busiest auditing firms, Withum\nSmith+Brown had an 80% deficiency rate and BDO had a 66% rate in 2022,\naccording to the audit regulator.\n\nAbout 84% of BF Borgers\u2019s clients were traded over-the-counter, meaning they\ndon\u2019t meet the listing requirements of large exchanges. Less than 30 traded on\neither the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, according to Ideagen.\n\nThe PCAOB said that BF Borgers more than doubled its clients between 2019 and\n2021. But the company didn\u2019t add more staff to handle the additional workload,\nthe PCAOB said in an expanded inspection report, noting that just one person\nwas responsible for 147 audits.\n\n## Deficiencies Found\n\nCongress created the PCAOB to oversee the work of auditors and restore\ninvestor confidence in corporate accounting, tapping the Securities and\nExchange Commission to appoint its members. The regulator\u2019s inspections look\nat a small sample of client audits. They measure whether auditors had\nsufficient evidence to back up their assessments of companies\u2019 financial\nstatements, providing a performance gauge for corporate directors and\ninvestors.\n\nNegative findings from the regulator indicate flawed processes or technical\nviolations of the board\u2019s rules.\n\nThe Washington-based audit regulator found problems with the firm\u2019s testing\nprocedures for bedrock measures such as revenue and accounts receivable, among\nother issues.\n\nIn 2022, the PCAOB placed a two-year ban on one of BF Borgers\u2019 audit directors\nfor failures on the audits of Chineseinvestors.com Inc., United Cannabis Corp.\nand China Pharma Holdings Inc. China Pharma\u2019s shares are down 99% in the past\nthree years.\n\n(Update with TMTG share price in seventh paragraph.)\n\n\\--With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Beyoud in Washington at\nlbeyoud2@bloomberg.net; Nicola M.
