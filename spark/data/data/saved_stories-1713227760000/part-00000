The industry\u2019s most\nadvanced fleetwide continuous profiling solution empowers users to identify\nperformance bottlenecks, reduce cloud spend, and minimize their carbon\nfootprint. This post explores the history of the agent, its move to open\nsource, and its future integration with OpenTelemetry.\n\nIn keeping with our commitment to drive OpenTelemetry towards becoming a de-\nfacto standard framework for observability, we\u2019re open-sourcing the Elastic\nUniversal Profiling agent and donating it to OpenTelemetry. As profiling\nbecomes a key observability signal, this donation will enable the\nOpenTelemetry project to provide an implementation for collecting profiling\nsignals in a universal way. We're excited to see how this collaboration\nfosters the development of more efficient and sustainable applications for\neveryone.\n\n###### Abhishek Singh, GM Elastic Observability\n\n## Elastic Universal ProfilingTM Agent goes open source under Apache 2\n\nAt Elastic, open source is more than just a philosophy \u2014 it's our DNA. We\nbelieve the benefits of whole-system continuous profiling extend far beyond\nperformance optimization. It's a win for businesses and the planet alike. For\ninstance, since launching Elastic Universal Profiling in general availability\n(GA), we've observed a wide variety of use cases from customers.\n\nThese range from customers relying fully on Universal Profiling's differential\nflame graphs and topN functions for insights during release management to\nutilizing AI assistants for quickly optimizing expensive functions. This\nincludes using profiling data to identify the optimal energy-efficient cloud\nregion to run certain workloads. Additionally, customers are using insights\nthat Universal Profiling provides to build evidence to challenge cloud\nprovider bills. As it turns out, cloud providers' in-VM agents can consume a\nsignificant portion of the CPU time, which customers are billed for.\n\nIn a move that will empower the community to take advantage of continuous\nprofiling's benefits, we're thrilled to announce that the Elastic Universal\nProfiling agent, a pioneering eBPF-based continuous profiling agent, is now\nopen source under the Apache 2 license!\n\nThis move democratizes hyper-scaler efficiency for everyone, opening exciting\nnew possibilities for the future of continuous profiling, as well as its role\nin observability and OpenTelemetry.\n\n## Implementation of the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Profiling protocol\n\nOur commitment to open source goes beyond just the agent itself. We recently\nannounced our intent to donate the agent to OpenTelemetry and have further\nsolidified this goal by implementing the experimental OTel Profiling data\nmodel. This allows the open-sourced eBPF-based continuous profiling agent to\ncommunicate seamlessly with OpenTelemetry backends.\n\nBut that's not all! We've also launched an innovative feature that correlates\nprofiling data with OpenTelemetry distributed traces. This powerful capability\noffers a deeper level of insight into application performance, enabling the\nidentification of bottlenecks with greater precision. Upon donating the\nProfiling agent to OTel, Elastic will also contribute critical components that\nenable distributed trace correlation within the Elastic distribution of the\nOTel Java agent to the upstream OTel Java SDK. This underscores Elastic\nObservability's commitment to both open source and the support of open\nstandards like OpenTelemetry while pushing the boundaries of what is possible\nin observability.\n\n## What does this mean for Elastic Universal Profiling customers?\n\nWe'd like to express our immense gratitude to all our customers who have been\npart of this journey, from the early stages of private beta to GA. Your\nfeedback has been invaluable in shaping Universal Profiling into the powerful\nproduct it is today.\n\nBy open-sourcing the Universal Profiling agent and contributing it to\nOpenTelemetry, we're fostering a win-win situation for both you and the\nbroader community. This move opens doors for innovation and collaboration,\nultimately leading to a more robust and versatile whole-system continuous\nprofiling solution for everyone.\n\nFurthermore, we're actively working on exciting novel ways to integrate\nUniversal Profiling seamlessly within Elastic Observability. Expect further\nannouncements soon, outlining how you can unlock even greater value from your\nprofiling data within a unified observability experience in a way that has\nnever been done before.\n\nThe open-sourced agent is using the recently released (experimental) OTel\nProfiling signal. As a precaution, we recommend not using it in production\nenvironments.\n\nPlease continue using the official Elastic distribution of the Universal\nProfiling agent until the agent is formally accepted by OTel and the protocol\nreaches a stable phase. There's no need to take any action at this time, and\nwe will ensure to have a smooth transition plan in place for you.\n\n## What does this mean for the OpenTelemetry community?\n\nOpenTelemetry is adopting continuous profiling as a key signal. By open-\nsourcing the eBPF-based profiling agent and working towards donating it to\nOTel, Elastic is making it possible to accelerate the standardization of\ncontinuous profiling within OpenTelemetry. This move has a massive impact on\nthe observability community, empowering everyone to continuously profile their\nsystems with a standardized protocol.\n\nThis is particularly timely as Moore's Law slows down and cloud computing\ntakes hold, making computational efficiency critical for businesses.\n\nHere's how whole-system continuous profiling benefits you:\n\n  * Maximize gross margins: By reducing the computational resources needed to run applications, businesses can optimize their cloud spend and improve profitability. Whole-system continuous profiling is one way of identifying the most expensive applications (down to the lines of code) across diverse environments that may span multiple cloud providers. This principle aligns with the familiar adage, \"a penny saved is a penny earned.\" In the cloud context, every CPU cycle saved translates to money saved.\n\n  * Minimize environmental impact: Energy consumption associated with computing is a growing concern (source: MIT Energy Initiative). More efficient code translates to lower energy consumption, contributing to a reduction in carbon footprint.\n\n  * Accelerate engineering workflows: Continuous profiling provides detailed insights to help debug complex issues faster, guide development, and improve overall code quality.\n\nThis is where Elastic Universal Profiling comes in \u2014 designed to help\norganizations run efficient services by minimizing computational wastage. To\nthis end, it measures code efficiency in three dimensions: CPU utilization,\nCO2, and cloud cost.\n\nElastic's journey with continuous profiling began by joining forces with\noptimyze.cloud \u2013\u2013 this became the foundation for Elastic Universal Profiling.\nWe are excited to see this product evolve into its next growth phase in the\nopen-source world.\n\n## Ready to give it a spin?\n\nAs Elastic Universal Profiling transitions into this new open source era, the\npotential for transformative impact on performance optimization, cost\nefficiency, and environmental sustainability is immense. Elastic's approach \u2014\nbalancing innovation with responsibility \u2014 paves the way for a future where\ntechnology not only powers our world but does so in a way that is sustainable\nand accessible to all.\n\nGet started with the open source Elastic Universal Profiling agent today!\nDownload it directly from GitHub and follow the instructions in the\nrepository.\n\nThe release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post\nremain at Elastic's sole discretion.
