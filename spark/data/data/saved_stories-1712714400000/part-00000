And the medical associations\u2019 newspeak twists simple scientific facts\nbeyond recognition.\n\nNearly all animals, as well as many plants, reproduce sexually. In all\nsexually reproducing species this occurs by combining a large gamete, called\nan ovum \u2014 or egg \u2014 with a small gamete, called a sperm. Though some\nhermaphrodite plants and animals produce both ova and sperm, there are no\nmammalian species that do. In mammals, each individual produces only one kind\nof gamete. Those individuals that produce (relatively few) ova are called\nfemale; those that produce (large numbers of) sperm are called male. Whether a\nmammal embryo develops into a male or a female is determined by a pair of sex\nchromosomes: XX for females, XY for males.\n\nThis image, provided by National Institutes of Health, shows the X and Y\nchromosomes.Jonathan Bailey/Associated Press\n\nIn short, sex in all animals is defined by gamete size; sex in all mammals is\ndetermined by sex chromosomes; and there are two and only two sexes: male and\nfemale. All this is, of course, hardly news: It has been known for over a\ncentury, and it is basic stuff from any half-decent high school course in\nbiology. For sure, quirks of mutation or prenatal development may leave some\nindividuals unable to produce viable gametes at all. But an infertile\nindividual with a Y chromosome is still male, just as a one-legged person\nremains a full member of our bipedal species.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch is speciously made of the fact that a very few humans are born with\nchromosomal patterns other than XX and XY. The most common, Klinefelter\nsyndrome with XXY chromosomes, occurs in about 0.1 percent of live births;\nthese individuals are anatomically male, though often infertile. Some\nextremely rare conditions, such as de la Chapelle syndrome (0.003 percent) and\nSwyer syndrome (0.0005 percent), arguably fall outside the standard\nmale/female classification. Even so, the sexual divide is an exceedingly clear\nbinary, as binary as any distinction you can find in biology.\n\nSo where does this leave the medical associations\u2019 claims about \u201csex assigned\nat birth\u201d?\n\nA baby\u2019s name is assigned at birth; no one doubts that. But a baby\u2019s sex is\nnot \u201cassigned\u201d; it is determined at conception and is then observed at birth,\nfirst by examination of the external genital organs and then, in cases of\ndoubt, by chromosomal analysis. Of course, any observation can be erroneous,\nand in rare cases the sex reported on the birth certificate is inaccurate and\nneeds to be subsequently corrected. But the fallibility of observation does\nnot change the fact that what is being observed \u2014 a person\u2019s sex \u2014 is an\nobjective biological reality, just like their blood group or fingerprint\npattern, not something that is \u201cassigned.\u201d The medical associations\u2019\npronouncements are social constructionism gone amok.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSex is a fundamental feature of the human species; it is a key variable in\npsychology, sociology, and public policy. Worldwide, men commit the vast\nmajority of homicides; women are far more likely than men to be single\nparents. While these distinctions are statistical, not absolute, they matter.\nOur public discourse becomes impoverished and distorted if we are unable to\nspeak and write straightforwardly about sex. And nowhere is this loss clearer\nthan in medicine.\n\nFor decades, feminists have protested against the neglect of sex as a variable\nin medical diagnosis and treatment, and the tacit assumption that women\u2019s\nbodies react similarly to men\u2019s bodies. Two years ago, the prestigious medical\njournal The Lancet finally acknowledged this criticism, but the editors\napparently could not bring themselves to use the word \u201cwomen.\u201d Instead the\njournal\u2019s cover proclaimed: \u201cHistorically, the anatomy and physiology of\nbodies with vaginas have been neglected.\u201d But now even this double-edged\nconcession may be lost, as the denial of biological sex threatens to undermine\nthe training of future doctors.\n\nThe medical establishment\u2019s newfound reluctance to speak honestly about\nbiological reality most likely stems from a laudable desire to defend the\nhuman rights of transgender people. But while the goal is praiseworthy, the\nchosen method is misguided. Protecting transgender people from discrimination\nand harassment does not require pretending that sex is merely \u201cassigned.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is never justified to distort the facts in the service of a social or\npolitical cause, no matter how just. If the cause is truly just, then it can\nbe defended in full acceptance of the facts about the real world.\n\nAnd when an organization that proclaims itself scientific distorts the\nscientific facts in the service of a social cause, it undermines not only its\nown credibility but that of science generally. How can the public be expected\nto trust the medical establishment\u2019s declarations on other controversial\nissues, such as vaccines \u2014 issues on which the medical consensus is indeed\ncorrect \u2014 when it has so visibly and blatantly misstated the facts about\nsomething so simple as sex?\n\nAlan Sokal is professor of mathematics at University College London and\nprofessor emeritus of physics at New York University. He is coauthor (with\nJean Bricmont) of \u201cFashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals\u2019 Abuse of\nScience\u201d and author of \u201cBeyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture.\u201d\nRichard Dawkins is professor emeritus for the public understanding of science\nat the University of Oxford. He is the author of 17 books, including \u201cThe\nSelfish Gene\u201d and \u201cThe Ancestor\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\n## Globe Opinion\n\nfollow us\n\n#### most read in Globe Opinion\n\n  1.
