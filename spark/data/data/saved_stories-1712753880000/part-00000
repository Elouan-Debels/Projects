Jonathan shared his last Bits from the DPL post to Debian recently and\nhis hopes for the future of Debian.\n\nRecently, we sat with the two present candidates for the DPL position asking\nquestions to find out who they really are in a series of interviews about\ntheir platforms, visions for Debian, lives, and even their favorite text\neditors. The interviews were conducted by disaster2life (Yashraj Moghe) and\nmade available from video and audio transcriptions:\n\n  * Andreas Tille [Interview]\n  * Sruthi Chandran [this document]\n\nVoting for the position starts on April 6, 2024.\n\nEditors' note: This is our official return to Debian interviews, readers\nshould stay tuned for more upcoming interviews with Developers and other\nimportant figures in Debian as part of our \"Meet your Debian Developer\"\nseries. We used the following tools and services: Turboscribe.ai for the\ntranscription from the audio and video files, IRC: Oftc.net for communication,\nJitsi meet for interviews, and Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) for editing and\nvideo. While we encountered many technical difficulties in the return to this\nprocess, we are still able and proud to present the transcripts of the\ninterviews edited only in a few areas for readability.\n\n2024 Debian Project Leader Candidate: Sruthi Chandran\n\n## Sruthi's interview\n\nHi Sruthi, so for the first question, who are you and could you tell us a\nlittle bit about yourself?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> I usually talk about me whenever I am talking about answering the question\n> who am I, I usually say like I am a librarian turned free software\n> enthusiast and a Debian Developer. So I had no technical background and I\n> learned, I was introduced to free software through my husband and then I\n> learned Debian packaging, and eventually I became a Debian Developer. So I\n> always give my example to people who say I am not technically inclined, I\n> don't have technical background so I can't contribute to free software.\n>\n> So yeah, that's what I refer to myself.\n\nFor the next question, could you tell me what do you do in Debian, and could\nyou mention your story up until here today?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Okay, so let me start from my initial days in Debian. I started contributing\n> to Debian, my first contribution was a Tibetan font. We went to a Tibetan\n> place and they were saying they didn't have a font in Linux.\n>\n> So that's how I started contributing. Then I moved on to Ruby packages, then\n> I have some JavaScript and Go packages, all dependencies of GitLab. So I was\n> involved with maintaining GitLab for some time, now I'm not very active\n> there.\n>\n> But yeah, so GitLab was the main package I was contributing to since I\n> contributed since 2016 to maybe like 2020 or something. Later I have come\n> [over to] packaging. Now I am part of some of the teams, delegated teams,\n> like community team and outreach team, as well as the Debconf committee. And\n> the biggest, I think, my activity in Debian, I would say is organizing\n> Debconf 2023. So it was a great experience and yeah, so that's my story in\n> Debian.\n\nSo what are three key terms about you and your candidacy?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Okay, let me first think about it. For candidacy, I can start with diversity\n> is one point I started expressing from the first time I contested for DPL.\n> But to be honest, that's the main point I want to bring.\n\n[Yashraj]:\n\n> So for diversity, if you could break down your thoughts on diversity and\n> make them, [about] your three points including diversity.\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> So in addition to, eventually when starting it was just diversity. Now I\n> have like a bit more ideas, like community, like I want to be a leader for\n> the Debian community. More than, I don't know, maybe people may not agree,\n> but I would say I want to be a leader of Debian community rather than a\n> Debian operating system.\n>\n> I connect to community more and third point I would say.\n\nThe term of a DPL lasts for an year. So what do you think during, what would\nyou try to do during that, that you can't do from your position now?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Okay. So I, like, I am very happy with the structure of Debian and how\n> things work in Debian. Like you can do almost a lot of things, like almost\n> all things without being a DPL.\n>\n> Whatever change you want to bring about or whatever you want to do, you can\n> do without being a DPL. Anyone, like every DD has the same rights. Only\n> things I feel [the] DPL has hold on are mainly the budget or the funding\n> part, which like, that's where they do the decision making part.\n>\n> And then comes like, and one advantage of DPL driving some idea is that\n> somehow people tend to listen to that with more, like, tend to give more\n> attention to what DPL is saying rather than a normal DD. So I wanted to,\n> like, I have answered some of the questions on how to, how I plan to do the\n> financial budgeting part, how I want to handle, like, and the other thing is\n> using the extra attention that I get as a DPL, I would like to obviously\n> start with the diversity aspect in Debian. And yeah, like, I, what I want to\n> do is not, like, be a leader and say, like, take Debian to one direction\n> where I want to go, but I would rather take suggestions and inputs from the\n> whole community and go about with that.\n>\n> So yes, that's what I would say.\n\nAnd taking a less serious question now, what is your preferred text editor?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Vim.\n\n[Yashraj]:\n\n> Vim, wholeheartedly team Vim?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Yes.\n\n[Yashraj]:\n\n> Great. Well, this was made in Vim, all the text for this.\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> So, like, since you mentioned extra data, I'll give my example, like, it's\n> just a fun note, when I started contributing to Debian, as I mentioned, I\n> didn't have any knowledge about free software, like Debian, and I was not\n> used to even using Linux. So, and I didn't have experience with these text\n> editors. So, when I started contributing, I used to do the editing part\n> using gedit.\n>\n> So, that's how I started. Eventually, I moved to Nano, and once I reached\n> Vim, I didn't move on.\n\nTeam Vim. Next question. What, what do you think is the importance of the\nDebian project in the world today? And where would you like to see it in 10\nyears, like 10 years into the future?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Okay. So, Debian, as we all know, is referred to as the universal operating\n> system without, like, it is said for a reason. We have hundreds and hundreds\n> of operating systems, like Linux, distributions based on Debian.\n>\n> So, I believe Debian, like even now, Debian has good influence on the, at\n> least on the Linux or Linux ecosystem. So, what we implement in Debian has,\n> like, is going to affect quite a lot of, like, a very good percentage of\n> people using Linux. So, yes.\n>\n> So, I think Debian is one of the leading Linux distributions. And I think in\n> 10 years, we should be able to reach a position, like, where we are not,\n> like, even now, like, even these many years after having Linux, we face a\n> lot of problems in newer and newer hardware coming up and installing on them\n> is a big problem. Like, firmwares and all those things are getting more and\n> more complicated.\n>\n> Like, it should be getting simpler, but it's getting more and more\n> complicated. So, I, one thing I would imagine, like, I don't know if we will\n> ever reach there, but I would imagine that eventually with the Debian, we\n> should be able to have some, at least a few of the hardware developers or\n> hardware producers have Debian pre-installed and those kind of things. Like,\n> not, like, become, I'm not saying it's all, it's also available right now.\n>\n> What I'm saying is that it becomes prominent enough to be opted as, like,\n> default distro.\n\nWhat part of Debian has made you And what part of the project has kept you\ngoing all through these years?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Okay. So, I started to contribute in 2016, and I was part of the team doing\n> GitLab packaging, and we did have a lot of training workshops and those kind\n> of things within India. And I was, like, I had interacted with some of the\n> Indian DDs, but I never got, like, even through chat or mail.\n>\n> I didn't have a lot of interaction with the rest of the world, DDs. And the\n> 2019 Debconf changed my whole perspective about Debian. Before that, I\n> wasn't, like, even, I was interested in free software.\n>\n> I was doing the technical stuff and all. But after DebConf, my whole idea\n> has been, like, my focus changed to the community. Debian community is a\n> very welcoming, very interesting community to be with.\n>\n> And so, I believe that, like, 2019 DebConf was a for me. And that kept, from\n> 2019, my focus has been to how to support, like, how, I moved to the\n> community part of Debian from there. Then in 2020 I became part of the\n> community team, and, like, I started being part of other teams.\n>\n> So, these, I would say, the Debian community is the one, like, aspect of\n> Debian that keeps me whole, keeps me held on to the Debian ecosystem as a\n> whole.\n\nContinuing to speak about Debian, what do you think, what is the first thing\nthat comes to your mind when you think of Debian, like, the word, the\ncommunity, what's the first thing?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> I think I may sound like a broken record or something.\n\n[Yashraj]:\n\n> No, no.\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Again, I would say the Debian community, like, it's the people who makes\n> Debian, that makes Debian special.\n>\n> Like, apart from that, if I say, I would say I'm very, like, one part of\n> Debian that makes me very happy is the, how the governing system of Debian\n> works, the Debian constitution and all those things, like, it's a very\n> unique thing for Debian. And, and it's like, when people say you can't work\n> without a proper, like, establishment or even somebody deciding everything\n> for you, it's difficult. When people say, like, we have been, Debian has\n> been proving it for quite a long time now, that it's possible.\n>\n> So, so that's one thing I believe, like, that's one unique point. And I am\n> very proud about that.\n\nWhat areas do you think Debian is failing in, how can it (that standing) be\nimproved?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> So, I think where Debian is failing now is getting new people into Debian.\n> Like, I don't remember, like, exactly the answer. But I remember hearing\n> someone mention, like, the average age of a Debian Developer is, like, above\n> 40 or 45 or something, like, exact age, I don't remember.\n>\n> But it's like, Debian is getting old. Like, the people in Debian are getting\n> old and we are not getting enough of new people into Debian. And that's very\n> important to have people, like, new people coming up.\n>\n> Otherwise, eventually, like, after a few years, nobody, like, we won't have\n> enough people to take the project forward. So, yeah, I believe that is where\n> we need to work on. We are doing some efforts, like, being part of GSOC or\n> outreachy and having maybe other events, like, local events. Like, we used\n> to have a lot of Debian packaging workshops in India. And those kind of, I\n> think, in Brazil and all, they all have, like, local communities are doing.\n> But we are not very successful in retaining the people who maybe come and\n> try out things.\n>\n> But we are not very good at retaining the people, like, retaining people who\n> come. So, we need to work on those things. Right now, I don't have a solid\n> answer for that.\n>\n> But one thing, like, I was thinking about is, like, having a Debian specific\n> outreach project, wherein the focus will be about the Debian, like, starting\n> will be more on, like, usually what happens in GSOC and outreach is that\n> people come, have the, do the contributions, and they go back. Like, they\n> don't have that connection with the Debian, like, Debian community or Debian\n> project. So, what I envision with these, the Debian outreach, the Debian\n> specific outreach is that we have some part of the internship, like, even\n> before starting the internship, we have some sessions and, like, with the\n> people in Debian having, like, getting them introduced to the Debian\n> philosophy and Debian community and Debian, how Debian works.\n>\n> And those things, we focus on that. And then we move on to the technical\n> internship parts. So, I believe this could do some good in having, like,\n> when you have people you can connect to, you tend to stay back in a project\n> mode.\n>\n> When you feel something more than, like, right now, we have so many\n> technical stuff to do, like, the choice for a college student is endless.\n> So, if they want, if they stay back for something, like, maybe for Debian, I\n> would say, we need to have them connected to the Debian project before we go\n> into technical parts. Like, technical parts, like, there are other things as\n> well, where they can go and do the technical part, but, like, they can come\n> here, like, yeah.\n>\n> So, that's what I was saying. Focused outreach projects is one thing. That's\n> just one.\n>\n> That's not enough. We need more of, like, more ideas to have more new people\n> come up. And I'm very happy with, like, the DebConf thing. We tend to get\n> more and more people from the places where we have a DebConf. Brazil is an\n> example. After the Debconf, they have quite a good improvement on Debian\n> contributors.\n>\n> And I think in India also, it did give a good result. Like, we have more\n> people contributing and staying back and those things. So, yeah.\n>\n> So, these were the things I would say, like, we can do to improve.\n\nFor the final question, what field in free software do you, what field in free\nsoftware generally do you think requires the most work to be put into it? What\ndo you think is Debian's part in that field?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Okay. Like, right now, what comes to my mind is the free software licenses\n> parts. Like, we have a lot of free software licenses, and there are non-free\n> software licenses.\n>\n> But currently, I feel free software is having a big problem in enforcing\n> these licenses. Like, there are, there may be big corporations or like some\n> people who take up the whole, the code and may not follow the whole, for\n> example, the GPL licenses. Like, we don't know how much of those, how much\n> of the free softwares are used in the bigger things.\n>\n> Yeah, I agree. There are a lot of corporations who are afraid to touch free\n> software. But there would be good amount of free software, free work that\n> converts into property, things violating the free software licenses and\n> those things.\n>\n> And we do not have the kind of like, we have SFLC, SFC, etc. But still, we\n> do not have the ability to go behind and trace and implement the licenses.\n> So, enforce those licenses and bring people who are violating the licenses\n> forward and those kind of things is challenging because one thing is it\n> takes time, like, and most importantly, money is required for the legal\n> stuff.\n>\n> And not always people who like people who make small software, or maybe big,\n> but they may not have the kind of time and money to have these things\n> enforced. So, that's a big challenge free software is facing, especially in\n> our current scenario. I feel we are having those, like, we need to find ways\n> how we can get it sorted.\n>\n> I don't have an answer right now what to do. But this is a challenge I felt\n> like and Debian's part in that. Yeah, as I said, I don't have a solution for\n> that.\n>\n> But the Debian, so DFSG and Debian sticking on to the free software licenses\n> is a good support, I think.\n\nSo, that was the final question, Do you have anything else you want to mention\nfor anyone watching this?\n\n[Sruthi]:\n\n> Not really, like, I am happy, like, I think I was able to answer the\n> questions. And yeah, I would say who is watching. I won't say like, I'm the\n> best DPL candidate, you can't have a better one or something.\n>\n> I stand for a reason. And if you believe in that, or the Debian community\n> and Debian diversity, and those kinds of things, if you believe it, I hope\n> you would be interested, like, you would want to vote for me. That's it.\n>\n> Like, I'm not, I'll make it very clear. I'm not doing a technical leadership\n> part here. So, those, I can't convince people who want technical leadership\n> to vote for me.\n>\n> But I would say people who connect with me, I hope they vote for me.\n\n  * About Bits from Debian\n  * Archives\n  * Atom feed\n  * RSS feed\n\n# More on Debian\n\n  * Project News\n  * Micronews\n\n# Tags\n\n  * ada lovelace day (1)\n  * android (1)\n  * announce (53)\n  * anonymity (1)\n  * arduino (1)\n  * artwork (8)\n  * award (2)\n  * aws (2)\n  * backports (1)\n  * barcelona (1)\n  * birthday (14)\n  * bookworm (1)\n  * bullseye (3)\n  * busan (1)\n  * buster (5)\n  * cambridge (1)\n  * cfp (7)\n  * cheese (2)\n  * cloud (2)\n  * community (1)\n  * conservancy (1)\n  * contests (1)\n  * contrib (1)\n  * contributing (5)\n  * covid19 (1)\n  * debconf (68)\n  * debconf13 (1)\n  * debconf14 (3)\n  * debconf15 (4)\n  * debconf16 (4)\n  * debconf17 (13)\n  * debconf18 (8)\n  * debconf19 (13)\n  * debconf20 (7)\n  * debconf21 (5)\n  * debconf22 (10)\n  * debconf23 (9)\n  * debconf24 (4)\n  * debian (33)\n  * debian edu (1)\n  * debian-meeting (2)\n  * debian women (4)\n  * debian30 (1)\n  * debianday (2)\n  * debianevents (1)\n  * diversity (2)\n  * donation (6)\n  * dpb (1)\n  * dpl (25)\n  * election (1)\n  * fonts (2)\n  * forums (1)\n  * fosdem (1)\n  * fpga (1)\n  * free software (2)\n  * FSFE (2)\n  * fundraising (4)\n  * gnome (2)\n  * google (5)\n  * gsoc (16)\n  * hh2018 (1)\n  * HP (1)\n  * HPE (3)\n  * hurd (1)\n  * i386 (1)\n  * ian murdock (1)\n  * imagination (1)\n  * in memoriam (1)\n  * infomaniak (5)\n  * infrastructure (1)\n  * installer (1)\n  * interview (8)\n  * irill (1)\n  * itp (1)\n  * jabber (1)\n  * jessie (2)\n  * kernel (1)\n  * lenovo (4)\n  * logos (1)\n  * LTS (1)\n  * meetDDs (2)\n  * minidebconf (5)\n  * mips (1)\n  * mirror (2)\n  * mirrors (1)\n  * mobile (1)\n  * news (1)\n  * onion services (1)\n  * openday (3)\n  * opw (3)\n  * outreachy (13)\n  * papercuts (1)\n  * paris (1)\n  * party (2)\n  * patent trolls (2)\n  * peertube (1)\n  * perl (4)\n  * postmortem (1)\n  * privacy (1)\n  * programming (1)\n  * project (53)\n  * proxmox (2)\n  * publicity (1)\n  * qa (2)\n  * reproducible builds (1)\n  * resolutions (1)\n  * roche (1)\n  * rtc (1)\n  * ruby (1)\n  * salsa (2)\n  * Savoir-faire Linux (1)\n  * security (2)\n  * sfc (1)\n  * siemens (1)\n  * sip (1)\n  * sources (2)\n  * south korea (1)\n  * sponsor (1)\n  * sponsors (30)\n  * sprint (7)\n  * squeeze (2)\n  * statement (1)\n  * stretch (4)\n  * survey (1)\n  * tails (1)\n  * technical (1)\n  * thefuture (1)\n  * tor (1)\n  * tor network (1)\n  * typography (2)\n  * users (1)\n  * usrmerge (1)\n  * vote (15)\n  * web (2)\n  * Wheezy (4)\n  * wine (2)\n  * xmpp (1)\n  * zfs (1)\n\nBits from Debian is the official blog of the Debian Project\n\n", "frontpage": false}
