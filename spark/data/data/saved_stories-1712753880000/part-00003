No tool has piqued the town\u2019s interest more than\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora, which was unveiled in February as capable of creating\nhyperrealistic clips in response to a text prompt of just a couple of\nsentences. In recent days, the Sam Altman-led firm released a series of videos\nfrom beta testers who are providing feedback to improve the tech. The\nHollywood Reporter spoke with some of those Sora testers about what it can,\nand can\u2019t, really do.\n\n### Related Stories\n\nBusiness\n\n### Broadway Openings Crowd Theaters As Hopefuls Aim for Tony Nominations\n\nTV\n\n### Emmys Predictions Via The Feinberg Forecast: Scott's First Read of 26\nCategories\n\nSora was made available to the team at Shy Kids, a Toronto-based production\ncompany composed of Walter Woodman, Sidney Leeder and Patrick Cederberg,\nwho\u2019ve collaborated on projects with HBO, Disney and Netflix in feature films\nsuch as Blackberry, Therapy Dogs and Nerve. With the tool, the trio created\nAir Head, a surrealist short film about a man with a balloon for a head.\n\nWoodman says he considers Sora another tool in his arsenal, similar to Adobe\nAfter Effects or Premiere. \u201cIt\u2019s something where you bring your energy and\nyour talents and you work with it to make something,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\u2019s a\nlot of hot air about just how powerful this is and how this is going to\nreplace everything and how we don\u2019t need to do anything. That\u2019s really\nundervaluing what a story is and what the components of a story are and what\nthe role of storytellers is.\u201d\n\nStill, the potential is undeniable. \u201cFor me, the most exciting thing is the\nidea of being able to bring your vision to life a bit quicker, to better\ndemonstrate it and then hopefully get past some of the hurdles and the\nprohibitive walls of gatekeeping of the film industry,\u201d Cederberg says.\n\nLeeder stresses, \u201cIt has the ability to really democratize the film industry.\u201d\n\nA caveat remains: Widespread adoption of AI tools in the moviemaking process\nwill depend largely on how courts land on novel legal issues raised by the\ntech. Among the few considerations holding back further deployment of AI is\nthe specter of a court ruling that the use of copyrighted materials to train\nAI systems constitutes copyright infringement. Another factor is that AI-\ngenerated works are not eligible for copyright protection.\n\nNotably, OpenAI doesn\u2019t disclose the materials used to train its system. It no\nlonger reveals the source of training data, attributing the decision to\nmaintaining a competitive advantage over other companies. The firm has been\nsued by several authors accusing it of using their copyrighted books, the\nmajority of which were downloaded from shadow library sites, according to\nseveral complaints against the company.\n\nIn an interview, the Shy Kids team elaborate to THR on their experience\ncreating a short video primarily using Sora, potential use of generative AI\ntools in Hollywood and controversy associated with the tech.\n\nLet\u2019s get into some of the technical capabilities of Sora. What can it do?\n\nWoodman: It can generate text to video up to a minute long. Most of the time,\nwe were making things that were closer to 20 seconds long. It can generate\nsome pretty interesting images.\n\nCederberg: It has the same pitfalls as a lot of generative AI in that\nconsistency is difficult. Control is difficult, which as creatives, I mean,\nyou want control. That was our general feedback to the researchers: More\ncontrol would be great, because we want to try to tell a story using a\nconsistent character from shot to shot and from generation to generation. Part\nof that is the reason why we ended up going with the guy with the balloon for\na head, because it\u2019s a little bit easier to tell that that\u2019s the same\ncharacter from shot to shot compared to someone whose face is changing. That\u2019s\nobviously an issue with it, but it\u2019s all early days right now.\n\nTell me about the making of Air Head. What did the workflow look like?\n\nWoodman: We dusted off our old folder of ideas that we have, that I think\nevery filmmaker has, of, \u201cHere\u2019s a character I want to see,\u201d or, \u201cHere\u2019s a\nsituation I want to see.\u201d To be honest, a lot of those didn\u2019t work. They were\npretty weird and crummy and awkward. And then we stumbled upon a guy with a\nballoon for his head, which was just a weird drawing I had in one of my\nmoleskin notebooks. When we started to generate it, it looked really cool and\nreally good. From there we wrote a script, and after that we began generating\nimages together. It was really interesting because Sid or Pat would generate\nsomething that would kind of lead us down a different path and lead us down a\ndifferent avenue. Once we had enough footage, we began to edit it down into a\nmanageable chunk. We began to animate. Pat was saying that I think probably\naround 50 percent of the shots have treatment on them. All of them have a sort\nof look and a color grade applied to them to make it all look consistent. We\nanimated and rotoscoped and made sure that everything was cohesive and sort of\ntogether. And then we added sound design. We recorded the V.O., which is Pat\ndoing the voiceover, and we added music, which was a song that we had made.\n\nWhat did the process look like to get Sora to return your main figure in Air\nHead? And how many times did you have to prompt Sora to get a figure you were\nhappy with?\n\nCederberg: When you put in \u201cMan with a balloon for his head\u201d and the machine\nhas a little dream about what that can look like, a lot of times we\u2019d find\nthat it would give them a face and would draw with a marker, like little\nsmiley face on it. We were like, \u201cNot quite it.\u201d So we\u2019d write in, \u201cMan with a\nballoon with no face on it.\u201d And then of course the machine would see the word\nface and go, \u201cOh, do they want a face again?\u201d So then we would get a balloon\nwith a human inside of the latex, and that was kind of horrifying in its own\nway. Ultimately, it\u2019s like with any prompting in general; it\u2019s about homing in\nthe language of trying to figure out what can get the machine to do what you\nwant it to do.\n\nLeeder: I think it also got used to that. I feel like we put in so many, \u201cGive\nus a man with a balloon for a head\u201d prompts in that it was like, \u201cOK, I get\nit.\u201d\n\nWoodman: I would love to actually know how many, but I would say it would be\nin the hundreds. That\u2019s the funny thing: You read the Twitter comments and\nthey\u2019re like, \u201cOh my God, this was so easy.\u201d If you only knew how many\npsychotic balloon-faced things I\u2019ve seen, you would know that it wasn\u2019t just,\n\u201cHere you go, here\u2019s the movie.\u201d It still requires tons of work and tons of\nmolding.\n\nCederberg: And as Walter was speaking to before about the VFX stuff, a lot of\ntimes we would find a shot that had the perfect composition for us, but the\nballoon was the wrong color. So we\u2019d have to go in and do some rotoscoping and\nrecoloring. Some shots, like the one where he\u2019s running through the park and\nchasing his balloon as a headless body, it wouldn\u2019t generate a headless\nfigure, so we had to go in and roto the head out, do a little VFX work to try\nto make that look the way we need to. There are a lot of human hands touching\nthis thing to try to get it to look semi-consistent to get it to where we\nwanted it to be.\n\nHow do you control the composition of the shots?\n\nWoodman: It\u2019s still going to film school. We would try to say stuff like,\n\u201cDolly in or Boom Up\u201d and A, most people on a film set can\u2019t agree what those\nterms mean. But B, I would say that it definitely was unsure. So in some ways\nyou had to sort of trick it into doing something that you wanted it to do. I\nwould say the other thing, there was some things that we found would work. So\nfor example, we love Darren Aronofsky. We think of The Wrestler and Black\nSwan. He always has those beautiful shots following people from behind. And we\nfound that that was something that was working quite well. And we knew that if\nwe got a couple of those that they would be able to cut together because they\nwould look quite similar if you have this from-behind shot style. But in terms\nof composition, it was quite hard. And I would say that as a filmmaker, that\nwas one of the most challenging things because you really want to go just\nstand over there like you would. But I think over time, that will get better\nand that will get more isolated, and you\u2019ll be able to be more fine-tuned with\nthat. However, that was, again, some of the first things we told the\nresearchers: We need to take this thing to film school. It needs to know the\ndifference between a zoom and a dolly and a wide shot and a close-up and a 35\nand a 70 millimeter lens. So it was difficult. And to get something that kind\nof functioned took a lot of trial and error.\n\nIn the prompt, are you putting it in wide shot or tracking shot? Does it have\nthat capability, or do you just have to toy around a bit?\n\nLeeder: We\u2019ve been testing that ourselves. It does know wide. You can phrase\nthat a few different ways. I feel like at first we were saying, \u201cThe entire\npark is in frame,\u201d or you try to phrase it different ways to see what stuck\nand what got you to resolve. Now I do think a wide shot works. Or even saying\nit was shot on this type of film or shot on a phone or old VHS footage. It\ndoes seem to understand that quite well.\n\nSo one thing you said that kind of struck me is Sora\u2019s ability to make things\nthat are totally surreal. Can you elaborate on that?\n\nWoodman: What\u2019s really interesting to me is making things that don\u2019t look like\nthe world around us that create a sort of new world. And I think that that\u2019s a\nreally exciting place to be: a sort of surreal, new world where balloon people\ncan go to cactus stores. I like that juxtaposition and that imagery. That\u2019s\ncool. I also think that there\u2019s a bunch of stuff that we made that looks\ntotally cursed and weird, and I love that stuff. It\u2019s like when you see weird\nlimbs and cats with eight legs and stuff like that. It\u2019s like Yorgos Lanthimos\ncould only dream of these kooky, weird morphing things. And I think that\nactually those things are going to be kind of a new cool aesthetic to play\nwith ,and how can we make these sort of demonic dream characters or beautiful\ndream characters? I think that\u2019s going to be really interesting.\n\nCederberg: Air Head is surreal, but we wanted to keep it grounded, and we\nwanted to see how far we can push a realistic aesthetic with some surreal\nelements. And I think some of the other artists that were featured on the\nFirst Impressions blog have some examples where it pushes a little bit more\ninto the weird and surreal and abstract. That stuff is very exciting.\n\nI\u2019d love to see the blooper reel for Air Head.\n\nCederberg: We would love to do something with the mountains of horrific\nCronenberg-esque balloon freaks that exist.\n\nWhere do you see the role of AI tools like Sora in the future of the industry?\n\nWoodman: We see it as a tool. I would liken it closer to something like After\nEffects or Premier. It\u2019s something where you bring your energy and your\ntalents and you work with the tool to make something. There\u2019s a lot of hot air\nabout just how powerful this is and how this is going to replace everything\nand we don\u2019t need to do anything. That\u2019s really undervaluing what a story is\nand what the components of a story are and what the role of storytellers is. I\nthink it\u2019s a very great tool, especially in the ideation phase. It\u2019s going to\nallow people to make some really cool sizzles and pitch decks and things like\nthat. And I also think it\u2019s going to be really helpful in the editing stages.\nI think a lot of the times when you get to an edit, it\u2019s kind of like, \u201cWhat\ndo we do? We have this great idea, but how do we explore this idea? We have\nall your footage already, how can we extend this or change this?\u201d And I think\nthat it\u2019s going to really open up possibilities for those parts of the process\nto really expand and be more fluid than I think they\u2019ve been in the past for\nsome people. Others are going to go, \u201cI don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to use it\nat all.\u201d I love Quentin Tarantino. I love Christopher Nolan. I think that\nthey\u2019re not going to change a single day in their life.\n\nCedeberg: For me, the most exciting thing is the idea of being able to bring\nyour vision to life a bit quicker, to better demonstrate it and then hopefully\nget past some of the hurdles and the prohibitive walls of gatekeeping of the\nfilm industry. There\u2019s plenty of great independent film right now, but to say\nthat independent film is in a good place would be, I would say, naive and\nignorant. And I think that the power for this to empower independent creators\nto gain access past these barriers that have been put up, is exciting.\n\nLeeder: In our minds, every project requires a different set of ingredients.\nWe\u2019re still going to shoot things on film. We\u2019re still going to make things in\nthe traditional ways. Not every project will incorporate Sora, but there will\nbe specific projects where Sora is incredibly helpful. It all depends. It\u2019s an\nadditional tool in our toolkit.\n\nIt sounds like you view this much as more as a complementary tool?\n\nCederberg: Yeah, having used it and as powerful as it is, I don\u2019t think any of\nus at any point were like, \u201cOh great, we don\u2019t have to work with people\nanymore.\u201d That\u2019s the heart of making something that is great: It\u2019s working\nwith human beings. It\u2019s just how can this technology allow us and allow humans\nto elevate the humanity and allow us easier access to that humanity. It\u2019s not\nsomething that can replace people. I feel like if more people have their hands\non it, they\u2019d realize that for themselves pretty quickly, too. It\u2019s not a\nmagic box that will suddenly make you Stanley Kubrick.\n\nWoodman: You kind of need a brain and years of experience and taste and\nability. I wish it did, but it doesn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t think it ever will.\n\nGen AI is obviously a hot button issue in Hollywood right now. What do you\nthink about the possibility that Gen AI tools like Sora are going to lead to\nmass displacement in the industry?\n\nWoodman: I would say that we feel for you. I understand feeling fear. Nobody\nwants to feel that they\u2019re going to be replaced and no one wants to feel like\nsomething that they\u2019ve worked so hard for is going to be completely\nundervalued and devalued. And our intention is never to do that. I think that\nthere are moments where Sora is very appropriate and very helpful, and I think\nthat there are moments where it won\u2019t be very appropriate or very helpful.\n\nWhat I am interested in is what happens when you give this technology to\npeople in Bangladesh or Lagos, Nigeria. Let\u2019s see what their stories are. I\nwatch Nollywood films, and I\u2019m extremely inspired by what they\u2019re doing with\nvery meager means. I think that artists always find a way to make things. And\nif they have access to these technologies, I wonder what those movies will be\nlike. We\u2019re underestimating how many more new filmmakers will get to be seen\nbecause their visions can come to life because they have the ability to make\nsomething that looks really interesting and really cool.\n\nLeeder: It has the ability to really democratize the film industry. We\u2019re an\nindie film production company. We\u2019re often working with limited budgets. Like\nI said before, there\u2019ll be some films that we still shoot traditionally and\nthere will be other films where we will use Sora, and using Sora will mean\nthat an idea that we wouldn\u2019t be able to bring to life is able to come to\nlife. It\u2019s changing times.\n\nCederberg: There\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s a paradigm shift coming. All of us\nhaving used it, at no point did any of us say to each other, \u201cOh, thank God we\ndon\u2019t have to work with artists anymore.\u201d We are part of a creative community\nhere. We employ and work with artists all the time. That\u2019s what art is:\nhumanity. This is just another tool. I have more faith in culture and people\nthan to assume that anybody would stand for losing the humanity in art.\n\nWhat about the possibility that Gen AI tools like Sora may be built off the\nbacks of copyrighted works from creators like yourself?\n\nWoodman: This is an issue that it\u2019s very important to us. We should pay people\nfor their creativity and originality. What I would say is that I\u2019m going to be\nvery excited for when I can train Sora solely on the things that I\u2019ve made,\nand then it can be far more tailor-made to what I need it for. You would have\nto talk to OpenAI about exactly where they\u2019re using all of their training\ndata. But the place that we are in right now is the experimentation phase.\nWe\u2019re just trying to see if we can use it to make something that we believe to\nbe original and artistically valid.\n\nCederberg: I think that it\u2019s an important conversation and one that right now,\ngiven that we are in the research phase and we\u2019re just artists who have the\nability to experiment with a new tool and as tech forward artists that excited\nus, we\u2019re just excited to help develop the tech. But obviously as the scope\nopens up and it widens and whatever Sora turns into, that\u2019s a conversation\nwe\u2019re going to be watching with attentive eyes as well, because we do believe\nartists should be protected, supported and compensated.\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up\n\n## More from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n  * Jessica Alba\n\n### Jessica Alba Stepping Down From Leadership Role at the Honest Company\n\n  * box office\n\n### Adam Aron Brushes Off Box Office Woes: \u201cIt\u2019s Inconceivable That AMC Would\nFile for Chapter 11\u201d\n\n  * Sky Studios\n\n### London\u2019s Garden Studios Hires Sky Studios Top Exec Bee Devine as COO\n\n  * Editors Guild\n\n### Editors Guild Reaches Tentative Agreement on Craft-Specific Issues\n\n  * Olympics\n\n### NBCUniversal Expects Advertising Record for 2024 Paris Olympics, Will\nBenefit From Women\u2019s Sports Boom\n\n  * Paramount Global\n\n### Courtney Armstrong Upped to COO of Paramount Pictures\n\n### Shopping With THR\n\n### The 35+ Best Deals to Shop at Sephora\u2019s Spring Savings Event: Rare Beauty,\nCharlotte Tilbury and More\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\n\n### The Best Music Festival Must-Haves for Your Last-Minute Coachella Packing\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\n\n### These Spring Dyson Deals Save You Up to $240 on Vacuums, Hair Tools and\nAir Purifiers\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston, Rudie Obias\n\n### The Best Western-Inspired Fashion Pieces, From Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Hat and\nBoots to Denim Essentials and Buckle Belts\n\nBy Natalie Alcala\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.
