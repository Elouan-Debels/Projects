THIS IS INSANE, I just tried the same thing - turning ON DNS Error\nAssist on my AT&T web profile settings, and immediately now instead of:\n\n> $ ping teledildonix PING teledildonix (143.244.220.150) 56(84) bytes of\n> data. 64 bytes from 143.244.220.150: icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=80.1 ms 64 bytes\n> from 143.244.220.150: icmp_seq=2 ttl=47 time=131 ms 64 bytes from\n> 143.244.220.150: icmp_seq=3 ttl=47 time=88.4 ms ^C --- teledildonix ping\n> statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time\n> 2007ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 80.156/100.183/131.956/22.719 ms\n\n(Note: The above is with error assist OFF, and this result is really bad\nbecause ATT is still hijacking the LAN local hostname DNS resolution and\nreplacing it with some Digital Ocean IP address instead of returning the\nappropriate 192.168.1.x result, basically the same thing poor bshosey and\ncountless others have been running into for years.\n\nAfter turning it ON, I'm getting:\n\n> $ ping teledildonix ping: teledildonix: Name or service not known\n\n> $ ping teledildonix.attlocal.net ping: teledildonix.attlocal.net: Name or\n> service not known\n\nSo, it's still super broken, but as noted by TheBeeZee, the setting behavior\nappears to be the opposite of what the AT&T portal and Internet at large\nclaim.\n\nBtw, this is with a BWG-500 router and AT&T fiber 1000 service. Yesterday the\nlocal DNS resolution was working fine, then there was a long power outage for\nmost of the day. After everything came back online, local hostname DNS queries\nare 100% failing.\n\nThe only reliable solution appears to be running your own router behind AT&T's\nBWG router-modem-all-in-one. What a pain.\n\nA few useful reference links*:\n\n  * https://gist.github.com/CollinChaffin/24f6c9652efb3d6d5ef2f5502720ef00\n  * https://kagi.com/search?q=bwg-500+local+hostname+not+resolving+143.244.220.150\n  * https://kagi.com/search?q=att+fiber+local+hostname+not+resolving+143.244.220.150\n\n*Google is apparently now useless for finding info on the Internet beyond very basic queries for stackoverflow or reddit, I had to use Kagi to discover anything useful on this topic.\n\n## About\n\nA collection of notes about AT&T hijacking DNS and breaking local hostname\nresolution\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n3 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
