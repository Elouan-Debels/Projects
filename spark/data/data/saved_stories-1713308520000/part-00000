Under the legislation, which\nhas not yet been passed, offenders would face prosecution and an unlimited\nfine, even if they do not widely share the images but create them with the\nintent to distress the victim. The government positions the law as part of a\nbroader effort to enhance legal protections for women.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nAI image generation tech can now create life-wrecking deepfakes with ease\n\nOver the past decade, the rise of deep learning image synthesis technology has\nmade it increasingly easy for people with a consumer PC to create misleading\npornography by swapping out the faces of the performers with someone else who\nhas not consented to the act. That practice spawned the term \"deepfake\" around\n2017, named after a Reddit user named \"deepfakes\" that shared AI-faked porn on\nthe service. Since then, the term has grown to encompass completely new images\nand video synthesized entirely from scratch, created from neural networks that\nhave been trained on images of the victim.\n\nThe problem isn't unique to the UK. In March, deepfake nudes of female middle\nschool classmates in Florida led to charges against two boys ages 13 and 14.\nThe rise of open source image synthesis models like Stable Diffusion since\n2022 has increased the urgency among regulators in the US to attempt to\ncontain (or at least punish) the act of creating non-consensual deepfakes. The\nUK government is on a similar mission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Under the new offense, those who create these horrific images without consent\nface a criminal record and an unlimited fine. If the image is then shared more\nwidely, offenders could be sent to jail,\" the UK Ministry of Justice said in a\nstatement. \"The new law will mean that if someone creates a sexually explicit\ndeepfake, even if they have no intent to share it but purely want to cause\nalarm, humiliation, or distress to the victim, they will be committing a\ncriminal offense.\"\n\n### Further Reading\n\nSharing deepfake porn could lead to lengthy prison time under proposed law\n\nLast year, the controversial Online Safety Act criminalized sharing non-\nconsensual deepfake images. The new proposed law, which still needs to go\nthrough parliamentary process to become enacted, would mark the first time\nthat creating sexually explicit deepfakes of non-consenting adults will become\nillegal in the UK (the distinction being sharing versus creating). The\ngovernment says that existing laws already cover the creation of sexual\ndeepfakes of children.\n\nThe government is also seeking to reinforce existing laws, allowing charges\nfor both the creation and distribution of deepfake content, potentially\nleading to harsher penalties from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\nIn a statement, Minister for Safeguarding Laura Farris MP emphasized the\ngovernment's stance, stating, \"The creation of deepfake sexual images is\ndespicable and completely unacceptable irrespective of whether the image is\nshared. This new offense sends a crystal clear message that making this\nmaterial is immoral, often misogynistic, and a crime.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n76\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
