After a disappointing verdict from a\nVirginia jury and an unsatisfactory outcome at the Court of Appeals, the\ninternet provider now intends to escalate the matter to the Supreme Court. If\nthe present verdict stands, innocent people risk losing their Internet access,\nthe ISP notes.\n\nInternet provider Cox Communications has been on the sharp end of several\npiracy lawsuits in recent years.\n\nThe biggest hit came three years ago when the Internet provider lost its legal\nbattle against a group of major record labels.\n\nA Virginia jury held Cox liable for pirating subscribers because it failed to\nterminate accounts after repeated accusations, ordering the company to pay $1\nbillion in damages. This landmark ruling was appealed and while Cox remains\nliable for contributory copyright infringement, the damages award may change.\n\n## New Damages Trial \u2018Delayed\u2019\n\nThe court of appeals recently dismissed the vicarious liability claims and\nvacated the $1 billion damages award. A new trial will determine the scale of\nthe damages given these new circumstances.\n\nWhen the court of appeals issues its mandate, the lower court can start a new\ndamages proceeding. However, Cox believes that it\u2019s best to put the brakes on\nthis process, as there is another appeal pending that could influence the\noutcome. That has to conclude first.\n\nThe record labels don\u2019t object to this reasoning and have informed the court\nthat its mandate could be stayed until the second appeal is finalized. The\ncourt of appeals subsequently granted the request last Friday.\n\n## Cox Works on Supreme Court Petition\n\nThese procedural issues typically aren\u2019t very exciting but, in this case, Cox\nalso revealed that it plans to file a writ of certiorari, asking the Supreme\nCourt to take on the piracy liability battle. That\u2019s notable, as it would be\nthe first time that a \u201crepeat infringer\u201d case ends up at the highest court\nUnited States.\n\nCox asked the court of appeals to also stay its mandate pending its Supreme\nCourt application, as this could steer the legal battle in yet another\ndirection.\n\nAccording to Cox, the Supreme Court has substantial reasons to take on the\ncase. For one, there are currently conflicting court of appeals rulings on the\n\u201cmaterial contribution\u201d aspect of copyright infringement.\n\nThe Supreme Court could give more clarity on when a service, with a myriad of\nlawful uses, can be held liable for infringers.\n\nIn addition, Cox also cites the recent \u2018Twitter vs. Taamneh\u2019 Supreme Court\nruling, which held that social media platforms aren\u2019t liable for terrorists\nwho use their network. While that\u2019s not a copyright case, it\u2019s relevant for\nthe secondary liability question, the ISP argues.\n\n\u201cThough Twitter was not a copyright case, it confronted a directly analogous\ntheory of secondary liability: that social-media platforms, including Twitter\nand YouTube, could be liable for continuing to provide services to those they\nknew were using them for illegal purposes,\u201d Cox writes.\n\n## Termination Risk\n\nFinally, Cox notes that the Supreme Court should hear the case because it\ndeals with an issue that\u2019s \u2018exceptionally important\u2019 to ISPs as well as the\npublic. If the present verdict stands, Internet providers may be much more\nlikely to terminate Internet access, even if the subscriber is innocent.\n\n\u201cThis Court\u2019s material-contribution standard provides powerful incentives for\nISPs of all stripes to swiftly terminate internet services that have been used\nto infringe\u2014 no matter the universe of lawful uses to which those services are\nput, or the consequences to innocent, non-infringing people who also use those\nservices.\n\n\u201cThat is why a chorus of amici urged this Court not to adopt this standard at\nthe panel and en banc stages, and will likely urge the Supreme Court to grant\nreview as well,\u201d Cox adds, referring to the support it received from third-\nparties previously.\n\n## No Supreme Court Stay\n\nCox hasn\u2019t filed a writ of certiorari yet and still has time, as it\u2019s due June\n17, 2024. The intention to go to the Supreme Court would be another reason to\nhalt the new damages trial, according to Cox, but the court of appeals\nrejected the request.\n\nThis means that the new damages trial can start, even if the case is still\npending at the Supreme Court. However, it\u2019s clear that this legal battle is\nfar from over yet.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of Cox\u2019s motion to stay the mandate, with the Supreme Court comments,\nis available here (pdf).
