Still, I like the\ninterface, the archive is truly comprehensive, and most importantly I find the\nbasic premise very attractive. I like movies, I like people\u2019s opinions about\nmovies, and I especially think that a lot of people who would never write\nprofessionally about movies have interesting opinions about movies. So\nLetterboxd should be just my thing, right? Ah, but. Here\u2019s the top-rated\nreviews for some films that I picked completely at random. I stress: I did not\nneed to go looking for these examples. I found all of these films and their\nreviews based solely on what just happened to be on my frontpage, in various\nsections. And I don\u2019t know why Letterboxd, as a company, doesn\u2019t give a shit\nabout this. I find it so depressing.\n\nCommando starring Arnold Scwharzenneger:\n\nGodfather Part II, many people\u2019s pick for the greatest film ever made:\n\nPhonebooth, starring Colin Ferrell:\n\nBradley Cooper\u2019s Maestro, a review by actor Ayo Edebiri, who is far too\ntalented and successful to be looking for cheap validation like this:\n\nLeave Her to Heaven, a 78-year-old movie:\n\nI could go on, and on, and on, and on.... Again, I didn\u2019t search for these, I\njust clicked on the first half-dozen or so movies in my feed, knowing that\nthey would inevitably have a top review that\u2019s an empty, unfunny joke. I was\nright. Go look for yourself if you doubt my process. I knew I could find these\nreviews through a purely random selection because that is the entire site.\nThat is what Letterboxd is. It\u2019s a site whose premise (anyone can post reviews\nof movies, and the interesting and perceptive ones will rise to the top) is\nruined by the social mandates shared by anyone under 55 years old (I need to\ntake every possible opportunity to show the world how clever I am, how good I\nam, that I\u2019m a star!) Yes, there\u2019s some very insightful and perceptive reviews\non Letterboxd. And I am not in fact immune to the appeal of humor. You might,\nI don\u2019t know, embed a joke in a longer, more substantive review, if that\u2019s not\ntoo crazy an idea. Some of the ones that are both insightful and perceptive\nalso manage to be funny! I further recognize that some people go too far in\nthe opposite direction; Letterboxd is not the place for the 10,000 word, Film\nComment-style exegeses some people write. But you cannot click through more\nthan two or three movies without finding one where the top review, and a\nmajority of the first several pages of reviews, are all one-sentence jokes. It\nmakes me very tired.\n\nLike all social networking behavior, this isn\u2019t the product of feckless\nindividual users, but rather a structural outcome of the site\u2019s systems.\nPeople want very badly to have the top review (because they crave attention),\nand the shortest reviews are always going to earn the most likes, network-\nwide, because it takes so little time and effort to read them. And Letterboxd\nlives on the same internet we all live on, where the basic concept of how\nyou\u2019re supposed to comport yourself was dictated by a few thousand annoying\npeople on Twitter in like 2010. (This is Freddie\u2019s Law of Social Media: over a\nlong enough time frame, all social networks become Weird Twitter.) The most\nactive users are, as on any social network, those that play most directly and\nshamelessly into the unhealthy dynamics baked into the system. Consider power\nuser \u201cKarst.\u201d His profile contains 118 pages of reviews. Here\u2019s his most\nrecent and highest-ranked as of the time I looked.\n\nTo me, this is a really good symbol of what makes Letterboxd unusable. The\nlast is at least an earnest reaction to a movie, I think, but of course we are\nnot privy to any explanation whatsoever for why the second Dune film was so\nmoving. None of these contain anything like an actual opinion, in the sense of\nbeing a comment on a movie\u2019s quality, the expression of an aesthetic value\nthat\u2019s explained with evidence. The first, for a delicate and moving Studio\nGhibli film, is just literally nothing, just a guy saying to his many\nfollowers \u201cI would like attention now, please.\u201d That stuff absolutely ruins\nthe user experience at Letterboxd, and seems to afflict more and more of the\ninternet as time goes by. There are thousands of these accounts out there,\ntrying to get noticed by writing \u201cfunny\u201d one-sentence reviews. They choke the\nsite. You often have to go pages into a movie\u2019s reviews to get anything that\nhas any substance at all. But because these reviews suck up so many likes\n(36,684!) everyone who signs up for a Letterboxd account receives an obvious\nmessage: being smart, well-written, observant, probing, insightful, or\nprovocative gets you nowhere. Take your swing and tell a shitty twelve-word\njoke, call it a review, and maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and become a celebrity.\n\nTreating Letterboxd as just another place to tell shitty jokes for a barely-\ninterested audience is the way to become a celebrity around there; it\u2019s a\nrecurring dynamic of internet life that leveraging laziness can be the best\npath to success. I doubt Letterboxd the company would ever do anything about\nall of this, given that they would seem to have no incentive to. It\u2019s also not\nentirely clear what they could do to solve the problem, although a 100-word\nminimum for reviews or similar couldn\u2019t hurt. But ultimately, people have to\nwant to do more with the internet than to tell shitty jokes, and they don\u2019t.\nTelling shitty jokes is what they imagine will make them feel accepted so they\nkeep doing it. Until people learn that telling shitty jokes to make fake\nfriends online is just going to make them sadder and more lonely in the long\nrun, the overarching problem will continue.\n\nI could understand someone saying, hey, Ayo Edibiri is hilarious! Why would\nyou complain about her? The problem is not that Edibiri is not funny. She\u2019s\nclearly funny. Occasionally these one-sentence reviews are funny regardless of\nwho wrote them, I\u2019m not arguing otherwise. The question is, why on Letterboxd?\nWhy can\u2019t Edibiri be funny on one of the myriad other platforms she has to be\nfunny? She\u2019s in every movie and show that gets made right now, she hosted SNL,\nshe can drop into any comedy club in the country and do a set whenever she\nwants. So why use Letterboxd this way? And obviously, the bigger point is to\nask why so many people treat networks and platforms as digital open mic night\nregardless of their features and purposes. In a world where so many spaces are\nalready dominated by people slinging one-liners at each other, why does every\nnew space eventually become like every other space? Why are so many bored\nprofessionals trying to moonlight as unpaid SNL writers on so many networks?\nReddit has a lot of good information on it, but any subreddit that isn\u2019t\nruthlessly dedicated to some very specific subject becomes a comedy club for\npeople who don\u2019t have the talent or guts to perform at an actual comedy club.\nThe podcast, as a medium, is like 70% people trying to be funny when they\nclearly don\u2019t have the talent for it. The average Slack sounds like my own\npersonal hell. Given the overall culture surrounding Discord it\u2019s hard to\nimagine that there are many of them that avoid the same fate. I find it all a\nbig drag!\n\nI\u2019ve probably mentioned this before, but when I lived in Chicago in my\nmid-20s, 2004-2006, my best friend there was involved in the Chicago comedy\nscene. He did improv and sketch comedy and a little standup. Sometimes he\u2019d\nbring me along to parties held by people in that world. I had a good time\npartying, did some good drugs, hooked up a few times. And some of the\nindividual people I met in that context were smart and cool and legitimately\nfunny. But as an experience, in total, those parties were usually unpleasant,\nand I say that as a man who loves and misses parties. I would come home\nafterwards and realize that I was exhausted, not because I had stayed out too\nlate or drank too much but because I had spent the entire evening hearing\npeople\u2019s material. The kind of people who moved to Chicago in an effort to\nmake a name in comedy at places like Second City or Upright Citizens Brigade\nwere the kind of people who were always on. They didn\u2019t know how to be off.\nI\u2019d go in, I\u2019d meet some people, the next thing you know, someone was saying,\n\u201cDidja ever notice....,\u201d and suddenly I was a one-man Tonight Show audience.\nAgain, these weren\u2019t bad people, and sometimes they were funny. But they had\nbeen so marinated in the culture of being \u201cfunny\u201d that I feared they didn\u2019t\nknow what normal, authentic, vulnerable human expression even was.\n\nThe ensuing two decades, and the rise of the social internet, have taken that\ncondition and made it essentially universal. I can never leave the party.\nPeople went from being always on whenever they were around other people to\nbeing always on whenever they were awake. The demand to tell jokes vastly\noutstripped the supply of funny jokes to tell. We live in a hell of other\npeople\u2019s comedy, and over time more and more spaces are colonized. In recent\nyears the need to be on generalist social media like Twitter and Facebook, for\nwriters, has significantly diminished. This is not entirely good news - you\ndon\u2019t need to be on Twitter or Facebook anymore because those networks no\nlonger drive traffic, which is killing media as an industry - but I am hoping\nthat more writers of my generation will jump ship if they haven\u2019t already. I\nhope they realize that spending all day long trivializing everything they do\njust makes their own lives trivial. I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019m sure other\npeople have too, but when you make everything a joke, someday you\u2019ll realize\nthat you\u2019re the joke. No one can take you seriously until you take you\nseriously. Pardon me for sounding a little self help-y.\n\nConsider this piece for Vulture by Hershal Pandya. It\u2019s about a podcast by the\nLonely Island comedy music collective. It\u2019s always a strong possibility that\nI\u2019m just old, or dumb, or both. But I am telling you that I cannot parse what\nPandya\u2019s attitude is towards the Lonely Island podcast, I just cannot, cannot\ndo it. On the surface, the piece suggests that Pandya finds the episode\nsomething of a disaster. But it also suggests that the disaster was planned\nand Lonely Island was doing a bit. And then there\u2019s the layer of Pandya\u2019s\naffected dry tone and performatively-amused detachment. It leaves me\ncompletely unclear as to whether the podcast episode was a success or an\nintentional failure or an unintentional failure and, worse, whether Pandya\nhimself thinks it was a success or not. This happens more and more often now,\nwhere I just genuinely cannot tell what level of irony people are operating at\nand so the basic work of language breaks down completely. Choire Sicha just\nmade the same complaint in his newsletter for New York yesterday, and I trust\nhe means it. (Choire is occasionally ironic, but never when he complains.)\nWhenever I write about this stuff people accuse me of wanting some facile \u201cNew\nSincerity\u201d or whatever, but I would honestly just like to know what the fuck\npeople who communicate for a living are talking about.\n\nDo those freaks who keep ranking Michael Mann\u2019s Heat as one of the best\nAmerican films of all time on IMDB or wherever really mean it? I don\u2019t know.\nDo they even know if they mean it, or of it\u2019s ironic or half-ironic or quasi-\nironic? I don\u2019t know; the implied air quotes are stacked so high I can\u2019t tell.\nDo the YouTubers or whoever that pushed them into overrating that (very good!\nbut c\u2019mon let\u2019s not go crazy here!) movie know if they really think it\u2019s a top\nten, top five, top one all-time movie? Unclear. That whole thing is wrapped in\nso many layers of studied bro frivolity, I can\u2019t tell.\n\nLook, I like to give young writers advice, in part because most professional\nwriters are too consumed with humility (real or faux) to give any. Besides,\nbeing able to claw some mild career success out of this wreck of a human being\nsuggests that I know a thing or two. And I have told people that they need to\nbe individual to have any chance, to be weird, to sell something other people\naren\u2019t selling. Being weird isn\u2019t sufficient to make a living as a writer,\ngood lord, no! I don\u2019t know what\u2019s sufficient. No idea, really. Go back in\ntime and start a blog in 2002 I guess. This industry is cratering and I\u2019m very\ndepressed about it. But it can help, a lot, if no one else writes like you.\nWhen you\u2019re a writer, like it or not, you are selling something in a market.\nAnd to succeed in a very crowded market, you can\u2019t be selling the same thing\nas everybody else. We\u2019ve reached this place with YouTube and podcasts and\nnewsletters and so many other creative endeavors where there are just such a\nvast number of people trying to make it that the odds of being noticed are\nincredibly slim. (Unless your parents are famous, in which case random chance\nhas blessed you for life.) This is all ultimately downstream from the way that\ndigital technologies opened up creative tools and platforms to everyone, and\nthen in a consequence of cruel but beautiful irony so many people crowded\nthose platforms that a different kind of velvet rope went up, womp womp. It\u2019s\nlike all those people from the Chicago parties tried to take the stage at the\nsame open mic night.\n\nWell: the particular kind of rude-character-in-a-Nickelodeon-show perpetual\njokiness that you see on Letterboxd is something that can be found in\nabundance in just about every creative field we have. The genre is saturated.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make a name for yourself, or even worse a career for\nyourself, then you should be selling something else. If you\u2019re still basing\nyour entire online performance on that same copy of a copy of a copy of\nChandler from Friends (RIP), I would invite you to consider what year it is,\nand anyway aren\u2019t you getting too old for that sort of thing? You want to be\nthe only person in the nursing home talking about how you\u2019re going to dunk on\nJon Chait? If you want to treat Letterboxd as your own personal HBO special,\nin perpetuity, I ask that you please consider whether you would be better off\nkeeping that in the group text so that the rest of us can actually talk about\nmovies. Perhaps there can be a time and a place for jokes other than \u201call the\ntime\u201d and \u201ceveryplace.\u201d And maybe someday we can all escape a curse that I\nknow many other people must chafe against as much as I do - that 21st century\naffliction of always living under the suffocating weight of other people\u2019s\ninsecurity.\n\n### Subscribe to Freddie deBoer\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\ncool but rude\n\n118 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n10 Restacks\n\n118\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bring Me Anything But Jokes\n\nfreddiedeboer.substack.com\n\n7\n\nShare\n\n7 Comments\n\nCommenting has been turned off for this post\n\nFionnM6 hrs agoCounterpoint: https://i.kym-\ncdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/037/159/covereric.jpgI will never write or\nsay anything as funny as this.Expand full commentLike (2)Share  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Freddie deBoer\n\nHerb6 hrs ago\"Are you being sarcastic, dude?\"\"I don't even know\nanymore.\"Expand full commentLike (10)Share  \n---  \n  \nPlease Just Fucking Tell Me What Term I Am Allowed to Use for the Sweeping\nSocial and Political Changes You Demand\n\nyou don't get to insist that no one talks about your political project and\nit's weak and pathetic that you think you do\n\nNov 8, 2021 \u2022\n\nFreddie deBoer\n\n888\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Please Just Fucking Tell Me What Term I Am Allowed to Use for the\nSweeping Social and Political Changes You Demand\n\nfreddiedeboer.substack.com\n\n358\n\nIf Michael Jordan Played In Today's NBA, He'd...
