Turing Award, sometimes described as the \u2018Nobel Prize\u2019 of computer science.\n\nAvi Wigderson at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New\nJersey, is known for work straddling several disciplines, and had already won\na share of the Abel Prize, a top mathematics award, three years ago.\n\nHe receives the Turing Award \u201cfor foundational contributions to the theory of\ncomputation, including reshaping our understanding of the role of randomness\nin computation, and for his decades of intellectual leadership in theoretical\ncomputer science\u201d, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in New York\nCity announced on 10 April.\n\n\u201cI was extremely happy, and I didn\u2019t expect this at all,\u201d Wigderson tells\nNature. \u201cI\u2019m getting so much love and appreciation from my community that I\ndon\u2019t need prizes.\u201d\n\n## \u2018A towering intellectual force\u2019\n\nWigderson was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1956. He studied at Technion \u2014 Israel\nInstitute of Technology in Haifa and later at Princeton University; he has\nbeen at the IAS since 1999. He is known for his work on computational\ncomplexity \u2014 which studies how certain problems are inherently slow to solve,\neven in principle \u2014 and on randomness in computation. Many practical\nalgorithms make random choices to achieve their objectives more efficiently;\nin a series of groundbreaking studies in the 1990s, Wigderson and his\ncollaborators showed that conventional, deterministic algorithms can, in\nprinciple, be roughly as efficient as \u2018randomized\u2019 ones^1. The results helped\nto confirm that random algorithms can be as accurate as deterministic ones\nare.\n\n\u201cWigderson is a towering intellectual force in theoretical computer science,\u201d\nsaid ACM president Yannis Ioannidis in a statement. In addition to Wigderson\u2019s\nacademic achievements, the ACS cited his \u201cfriendliness, enthusiasm, and\ngenerosity\u201d, which have led him to be a mentor to or collaborate with hundreds\nof researchers worldwide. Wigderson admits that he is a \u201cbig proselytizer\u201d of\nthe intellectual pleasures of his discipline \u2014 he wrote a popular book about\nit and made it freely available on his website. \u201cI think this field is great,\nand I am happy to explain it to anybody.\u201d\n\nThe Turing Award is named after the celebrated British mathematician and code-\nbreaker Alan Turing (1912\u201354), who in the 1930s laid the conceptual\nfoundations of modern computing. \u201cI feel completely at home with mathematics,\u201d\nsays Wigderson, adding that as an intellectual endeavour, theoretical computer\nscience is indistinguishable from maths. \u201cWe prove theorems, like\nmathematicians.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01055-y\n\n## References\n\n  1.
