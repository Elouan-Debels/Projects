See\nexamples\n\nRegardless of how you use Greptile, the overall flow looks like this:\n\n  1. Obtain API key and GitHub token: one-time, takes 5 minutes. API support for GitLab and Azure Devops is coming soon.\n  2. Submit repository for indexing: one-time, takes 5-50 minutes depending on codebase size, auto-updates index on every push.\n  3. Query in natural language: answers with full-codebase context in <3 seconds, responses can be streamed.\n\n##\n\nMotivation\n\nWe believe that full codebase-context is the core problem in building AI\ndeveloper tools. With reliable, full codebase context, developers can build\nunlimited tooling, from PR review bots, to JIRA ticket annotators, to\nSlackbots to answer questions about the source code, and much, much more.\n\nOur mission at Greptile is to provide developers with that infrastructure as\nan easy-to-use API.\n\n##\n\nWhat will you build?\n\nHere are some examples of internal tools you can build for your team with\nGreptile\u2019s API:\n\n## Codebase Expert Slackbot\n\nBuild an expert on your codebase that answers questions in your Slack!\n\n## PR Review Bot\n\nBuild a bot that writes thoughtful, codebase context-aware comments on your\nteam\u2019s PRs.\n\n## Automatic Docs Updater\n\nBuild a bot that writes a PR to update your docs every time you push new code,\nso your docs are always up-to-date.\n\n## Ticket Enricher\n\nAutomatically add context and instructions to new tickets made in your task\nmanager - Linear, Jira, etc.\n\n...the possibilities are endless!\n\nQuickstart\n\ntwittergithublinkedin\n\nPowered by Mintlify\n\n  * Motivation\n  * What will you build?\n\n", "frontpage": false}
