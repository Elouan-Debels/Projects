In particular, fact-checkers\nregularly come to mind, since having accurate information is a critical part\nof helping to inform others, by co-verifying information, correction, or\nencouraging health inquiry. Some of our team members also knew that fact-\ncheckers can be overwhelmed with the amount of information there is to\npotentially fact-check (consider the more than 13,000 fact-check articles that\nthese four organizations alone published between May 2019 and August 2022).\n\nSo, Amy Zhang and I, along with some others associated with her Social Futures\nLab, decided to learn more about the efforts that fact-checkers take to\nprioritize what claims and issues they focus on. What we tested, and learned\nmore about, was the concept of \u201cmisinformation as a harm.\u201d\n\n### Using the FABLE Framework to triage potential harmfulness\n\nThe question of whether false information is harmful is a very old one \u2013\nconsider the supposedly harmless \u201cwhite lie.\u201d While people have debated this\nquestion for millennia, we do know that what counts as harmful can be very\ncontext dependent. And whether a piece of information has the potential to\nharm someone must, at least in a democratic society, balance with other rights\nsuch as the freedom of speech, conscience, and assembly.\n\nAs it turns out, helping people have access to correct information given the\npotential for harm is an especially strong motivator for fact-checkers. And\nso, to help them develop a way to help sort the kinds of claims to fact-check,\na time-consuming process, we developed a model that might help them triage\naccording to potential harmfulness.\n\nTo get a little into the nitty gritty of this, our framework tries to clarify\ndimensions or categories of when a false rumor or information is increasingly\nharmful, rather than identifying types of harm (like physical versus social\nharms).\n\nThe FABLE framework has five dimensions:\n\n  1. (Social) Fragmentation: The tendency towards social fragmentation within the content\u2019s narrative.\n  2. Actionability: The potential of action resulting from the content.\n  3. Likelihood of Spread: The likelihood of the content\u2019s spread and exposure.\n  4. Exploitativeness: The exploitativeness of the content\u2019s intended audience.\n  5. Believability: The believability of the content\u2019s information to the audience.\n\nDimensions of the FABLE Framework of Misinformation Harms\n\nYou can find more about the work to develop and refine a misinfoharms\nframework in this paper: Misinformation as a harm: structured approaches for\nfact-checking prioritization (arXiv).\n\nWe\u2019re hoping that others can continue to build on this framework and research,\nand hopefully develop better tools, even automated ones, that can assist fact-\ncheckers to help us navigate the tidal waves of information out there.\n\n### Another key takeaway: We are connected, and we all depend on each other.\n\nThere are more general takeaways from this work as well. The first is how much\nwe are connected and depend on one another. We learned a lot about the\nconcerns that fact-checkers have for their readers. We also could see our\nconnections to one another through the implications of a piece of, say, health\nmisinformation around an issue that is difficult to understand; complex rumors\nfall under the Exploitativeness dimension with its potential to harm\nindividuals, communities, societies.\n\nAnd more tools and resources (like ones that help me to reflect on my own\nemotional responses, check out the Believability-related questions) can also\nenable us to make independent and informed choices over our individual lives.\n\nAt the same time, another powerful lesson to take away is how much we are each\nalso capable of. Individually, we can wield considerable power, such as\naffecting others, and just because something has the potential to harm us\ndoesn\u2019t mean that it always or inevitably will.\n\n### Help the ARTT team reach more people!\n\nIf you like this newsletter, help us reach more people by sharing it with a\ncolleague or a friend who might be interested in discussing how to create\nopportunities for trusted conversations online.
