Since it emerged in 1996, there have been over 800 cases globally.\n\n\u201cSo you get a sense that there\u2019s nothing unprecedented about the number of\nhuman cases we\u2019re seeing \u2013 but we have to watch the virus. We have to watch\nthe epidemiology, to see if it\u2019s changing in some way,\u201d said Dr Mott.\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Global Health Security,\n  * Bird Flu,\n  * Pandemics and epidemics,\n  * Cattle,\n  * Agriculture\n\n28\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
