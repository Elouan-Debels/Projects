After initial equipment tests, the plan was to\nuse the aircraft to spray a few kilograms of material about 20 kilometers\n(12.4 miles) above Earth and then fly back through the plume to measure how\nreflective the particles were, how readily they dispersed, and other\nvariables.\n\nBut the initial launch didn\u2019t happen the following year, nor the next, the\nnext, or the next\u2014not in Tucson, nor at a subsequently announced site in\nSweden. Complications with balloon vendors, the onset of the covid pandemic,\nand challenges in finalizing decisions between the team, its advisory\ncommittee, and other parties at Harvard kept delaying the project\u2014and then\nfervent critiques from environmental groups, a Northern European Indigenous\norganization, and other opponents finally scuttled the team\u2019s plans.\n\nCritics, including some climate scientists, have argued that an intervention\nthat could tweak the entire planet\u2019s climate system is too dangerous to study\nin the real world, because it\u2019s too dangerous to ever use. They fear that\ndeploying such a powerful tool would inevitably cause unpredictable and\ndangerous side effects, and that the world\u2019s countries could never work\ntogether to use it in a safe, equitable, and responsible way.\n\nThese opponents believe that even discussing and researching the possibility\nof such climate interventions eases pressures to rapidly cut greenhouse-gas\nemissions and increases the likelihood that a rogue actor or solitary nation\nwill one day begin spraying materials into the stratosphere without any\nbroader consensus. Unilateral use of the tool, with its potentially calamitous\nconsequences for some regions, could set nations on a collision course toward\nviolent conflicts.\n\nHarvard\u2019s single, small balloon experiment, known as the Stratospheric\nControlled Perturbation Experiment, or SCoPEx, came to represent all of these\nfears\u2014and, in the end, it was more than the researchers were prepared to take\non. Last month, a decade after the project was first proposed in a research\npaper, Harvard officially announced the project\u2019s termination, as first\nreported by MIT Technology Review.\n\n\u201cThe experiment became this proxy for a kind of debate about whether solar\ngeoengineering research should move forward,\u201d Keith says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s, I\nthink, the ultimate reason why Frank and I decided to pull the plug. There\u2019s\nno way, given that weight that SCoPEx had come to hold, it made sense to move\nforward.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about solar geoengineering for more than a decade. I\nreported on the conference in 2017, and I continued to cover the team\u2019s\nevolving plans over the following years. So the cancellation of the project\nleft me puzzling over why it failed, and what that failure says about the\nlatitude that researchers have to explore such a controversial subject.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent days, I asked a handful of people who were involved in the project\nor followed it closely for their insights and thoughts on what unfolded, what\nlessons can be drawn from the episode\u2014and what it means for geoengineering\nresearch moving forward.\n\nFew of the people I spoke with believe it spells the end of outdoor\nexperiments in solar geoengineering, but some argue that it should\u2014and others\nbelieve any future proposals should proceed in a very different way if\nresearchers hope to avoid the same fate.\n\n### A short history of SCoPEx\n\nNature offered the inspiration for solar geoengineering: massive volcanic\neruptions in the past have cooled global temperatures by emitting vast amounts\nof sulfur dioxide, which eventually form sulfuric acid aerosols that reflect\naway solar radiation.\n\nThe 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, for instance, blasted\nnearly 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, cooling global\nsurface temperatures by around 0.5 \u00b0C for months.\n\nBut one concern about relying on the gas for geoengineering is that sulfuric\nacid also depletes the ozone layer, which shields life on Earth from harmful\nultraviolet light. So some researchers, including Keith, have used computer\nmodels to explore whether we could reduce or even reverse that side effect by\nreplacing sulfur dioxide with other substances, including diamond dust,\nalumina, or calcium carbonate.\n\nThe SCoPEx researchers discussed the possibility of releasing several\nmaterials over a series of flights, including sulfuric acid, but they mainly\nemphasized calcium carbonate.\n\nThey hoped that the data from the launches could refine the accuracy of\ngeoengineering simulations and improve our understanding of the technology\u2019s\npotential benefits and risks.\n\n\u201cYou have to go measure things in the real world, because nature surprises\nyou,\u201d Keith said at that conference in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has continually stressed that the amount of material involved would\nrepresent a small fraction of the particulate pollution already emitted by\nplanes, and that doing the same experiment for any other scientific purpose\nwouldn\u2019t have raised an eyebrow.\n\nBut theirs became a lightning rod. In their effort to be upfront and\ntransparent about their plans, Keith believes, they set off a self-reinforcing\ncycle of overheated press coverage and fierce attacks from critics, all of\nwhich inflated public concerns about what he contends was an ordinary\nexperiment with negligible environmental impact.\n\nThe team\u2019s initial hopes for launching a balloon in Arizona in 2018 never came\nto fruition because the balloon vendor they were working with, World View,\nstopped launching payloads of the necessary weight, Keith says. (The company\ndidn\u2019t respond to an inquiry before press time.)\n\nBut the researchers continued to develop the equipment and aircraft in the\nlabs at Harvard, and the university set up an oversight panel that began\nreviewing the team\u2019s plans and developing guidelines for engaging with the\npublic.\n\nEventually, the researchers shifted their focus to Sweden, where they began\nplanning a launch to test the aircraft\u2019s equipment, working with the Swedish\nSpace Corporation. The balloon was set to lift off from the Esrange Space\nCenter in Kiruna in the summer of 2021.\n\nThe aircraft would not have released any materials during that launch. But\nanti-geoengineering groups, environmental organizations, Swedish environmental\nactivist Greta Thunberg, the Saami Council (which represents the Indigenous\nSaami peoples of Northern Europe), and the board of the Royal Swedish Academy\nof Sciences all criticized the plan, putting pressure on the aerospace\ncompany, the research team, and the advisors to halt the launch.\n\nSolar geoengineering \"is a technology that entails risks of catastrophic\nconsequences, including the impact of uncontrolled termination, and\nirreversible sociopolitical effects that could compromise the world\u2019s\nnecessary efforts to achieve zero-carbon societies,\u201d the Saami Council wrote\nin a letter to the advisory committee. \u201cThere are therefore no acceptable\nreasons for allowing the SCoPEx project to be conducted either in Sweden or\nelsewhere.\u201d\n\nIn response, the advisory committee recommended that the researchers delay\ntheir plans until they had conducted conversations about the project with the\npublic and concerned parties. In late March of 2021, the team and the company\nagreed to stand down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project never regained traction from there.\n\nLast spring, Keith moved to the University of Chicago, where he now leads the\nClimate Systems Engineering initiative, a multidisciplinary research effort\ndedicated to improving understanding of solar geoengineering, carbon removal,\nand other interventions that could counteract the effects of climate change.\n\nA few months later, the research team informed the advisory committee that it\nhad \u201csuspended work\u201d on the experiment. Then, last month, Keutsch officially\nconfirmed he\u2019s no longer pursuing the project.\n\n\u201cI felt that it was time to focus on other innovative research avenues in the\nincredibly important field of [solar radiation modification] that promise\nimpactful results,\u201d he said in an email.\n\n### Too dangerous to study\n\nPlenty of observers are pleased with the outcome.\n\nHundreds of researchers from a variety of disciplines have signed an open\nletter calling for an \u201cInternational Non-Use Agreement on Solar\nGeoengineering,\u201d stating that governments should commit to \u201cban outdoor\nexperiments of solar geoengineering.\u201d\n\nJennie Stephens, a professor of sustainability science and policy at\nNortheastern University, was one of the letter\u2019s signatories. She argues that\nthe SCoPEx experiment was particularly dangerous, because the funding,\nattention, and prestige of Harvard conferred legitimacy on planet-scale\ninterventions that, to her mind, can never be safely governed or controlled.\n\nShe argues that even if the researchers have the best of intentions, solar\ngeoengineering would ultimately be deployed by people or nations with money\nand power in ways that most benefit their interests, even if it meant\ndisastrous consequences for other areas. Some research, for instance, suggests\nthat solar geoengineering could significantly reduce rainfall in certain areas\nand might reduce the yields of some staple crops. While one block of nations\nmight decide to use geoengineering to ease heat waves, what if that reduced\nthe summer monsoons and the food supplies across parts of India or West\nAfrica?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to even imagine deploying it on a global scale so that\neverybody would benefit,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people would be screwed, and some\npeople may have reduced suffering. So it\u2019s creating one more mechanism by\nwhich to interfere with the Earth systems and then privilege some and\ndisadvantage others.\u201d\n\n### Openness\n\nBut many believe it\u2019s essential to learn more about the role that solar\ngeoengineering could play in easing global warming, and whether the side\neffects could be moderated. There\u2019s a simple reason: if it does work well, it\ncould save many lives and ease suffering as climate change accelerates.\n\nFor these observers, then, the question is: What lessons can be drawn to\nensure that other experiments can go forward? And perhaps of equal importance:\nWhat lessons shouldn\u2019t be drawn from SCoPEx?\n\nSome researchers in the field fear that the broader takeaway from the\ntermination of the project will be that the Harvard team chose to be too open\nabout its intentions.\n\nThe \u201corganized opposition to even the concept of outdoor experiments\u201d makes it\ndifficult for other research groups to pursue similar work and \u201cmay increase\nthe probability of rogue actors,\u201d says Michael Gerrard, faculty director of\nColumbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who served on the\nadvisory committee. He notes that such activities are largely unregulated.\n\nImmediately following the news that Harvard was no longer pursuing the\nproject, several figures in the cleantech industry took to social media to say\nthat people could, or should, release particles into the stratosphere on their\nown.\n\nWhile the Harvard team\u2019s public plans were going nowhere, several other\nindividuals claimed to have simply started launching stratosphere-bound\nballoons without any announcements in advance. They include the CEO of Make\nSunsets, a venture-backed geoengineering startup, as well as Andrew Lockley,\nan independent researcher in the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this week, a University of Washington-led research group\nconducted a small experiment in marine cloud brightening, another form of\nsolar geoengineering, on a decommissioned aircraft carrier anchored off the\ncoast of Alameda, California, according to the New York Times. The team \u201ckept\nthe details tightly held, concerned that critics would try to stop them,\u201d the\nnewspaper reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeith himself is \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d to doing anything \u201crogue,\u201d in the sense of\nillegal, or to conducting any such research in this field outside of the\nnormal scientific process. And he says that \u201cnot being open at all\u201d isn\u2019t the\nright strategy.\n\nBut he is wrestling with how up-front researchers should be. The level of\nearly notice and transparency they strived for \u201cmaybe really doesn\u2019t work in a\nconflictual environment,\u201d he observes. \u201cSo maybe we should have been\nsignificantly less open and had a few limited sets of checks.\u201d\n\nSikina Jinnah, a professor of environmental studies at the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Cruz, who joined the project\u2019s advisory committee after the\nSweden decision, draws the opposite lesson about transparency and engagement.\n\nShe says that the Harvard team never got to the point of engaging with the\npublic about its plans in any formal way in Sweden, and she stresses that such\nconversations should begin much earlier in the process. (This was also one of\nthe main conclusions in the committees\u2019 final report on the experiment, which\nwas released last month.)\n\n\u201cEarly engagement, I think, is one of the big take-home lessons,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAnd not just sort of cursory \u2018giving a public talk\u2019 kind of engagement, but\nreally moving to iterative engagement with communities about their concerns,\nabout questions they may be interested in, and really starting to reframe that\nkind of engagement process as one that\u2019s not detrimental to the research\neffort but can actually enhance research and enrich it in ways that are\nsocially beneficial.\u201d\n\n### Scientific merit\n\nOther observers believe there was a more basic problem with SCoPEx.\n\n\u201cMost of the scientists in the field didn\u2019t feel like it was a particularly\nessential experiment,\u201d said Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at\nCornell University who focuses on solar geoengineering, in an email.\n\nAs a result, there wasn\u2019t a rush to defend it, he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacMartin explained that the project was more focused on studying alternative\naerosols, mainly calcium carbonate, rather than addressing unknowns concerning\nthe substance that most people think would be used: sulfur dioxide.\n\nThat\u2019s because scientists know much more about its overall effects and can\nmodel them more accurately, since volcanoes already add the gas to the\nstratosphere naturally. Climate models also suggest that the impact on ozone\nwould be minimal \u201cand thus not worrisome enough to justify turning to a less-\nwell-understood material,\u201d he said.\n\nAlan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers who has highlighted the potential\nrisks of geoengineering, echoed this concern.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this project ever had a good science question,\u201d he says. \u201cI\nthink it was more driven by wanting to build something, the engineering.\u201d\n\nMacMartin says the crucial starting questions for experiments in this field\nare what gaps in our understanding such research could fill and whether that\ninformation would help to inform decisions about geoengineering. And it\u2019s the\npursuit of those answers that should be communicated as the rationale to the\npublic.\n\nBut, he says, too often the SCoPEx researchers articulated their case for the\nwork along the lines of, \u201cHey, this is small\u2014you should let us do it because\nwe want to.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Keutsch noted that one of the things they hoped to better\nunderstand through the experiment was how plumes of injected particles spread\nout and mix in the stratosphere. In addition, Keith noted that they did\ndiscuss releasing and studying sulfuric acid as well, though they tended to\ntalk more about calcium carbonate.\n\n### Broader scientific program\n\nAnother concern about the project from early on was that it was a one-off,\nprivately funded experiment, moving ahead outside of any broader, government-\nbacked research program. (Funding came from grants that Harvard provided the\nresearchers as new professors and through the university\u2019s Solar\nGeoengineering Research Program, which has raised money from the Alfred P.\nSloan Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the Pritzker Innovation Fund, and\nother groups and individuals.) For less touchy subjects, such an experiment\nmight be funded and overseen through a federal scientific body like the US\nNational Science Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat meant the university had to set up an advisory board if the institution\nwanted standard scientific oversight\u2014and it meant that that committee had to\ncraft its own rules for how such experiments should proceed, even as the\nresearchers were taking steps toward an initial launch to test out their\nhardware.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the topic, some observers believe that outdoor solar\ngeoengineering experiments should only proceed through broader, public\nresearch programs involving scientific bodies with established practices for\nevaluating scientific merit, ethics, and environmental impact. Ideally, such\nprograms would include \u201csociety-wide engagement,\u201d tapping a variety of experts\nto impartially inform significant portions of the public about such\ninterventions, explore their areas of concern, and, crucially, use that input\nto inform the design of the research program, says Holly Buck, an\nenvironmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo and author of\nAfter Geoengineering.\n\n\u201cUnless government is convening a serious engagement process where they are\ngoing to incorporate what they hear into policy in this area, I would expect\nany sort of outdoor experiment to meet a similar kind of resistance,\u201d she said\nin an email.\n\nSeveral nations have set up small-scale research efforts in the field,\nincluding the US and China. But a comprehensive program of this sort would\nrequire far more funding than has been allocated to date. A 2021 National\nAcademies report recommended that the US government establish a cross-agency\nresearch program in solar geoengineering, backed by $100 million to $200\nmillion over a five-year period.\n\n### Future experiments\n\nKeith himself owns up to several mistakes in the research effort, including\nfailing to anticipate that opponents would raise concerns over the basic\nhardware test in Sweden. He also says the team was wrong to move ahead without\nhaving a public engagement plan in place. The public failure of SCoPEx, he\nbelieves, will probably make it more difficult for other experiments in the\nstratosphere to go forward.\n\n\u201cWhich is really sad,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I apologize, and it\u2019s a failure.\u201d\n\nBut he also says there is still room for other groups to pursue outdoor\nexperiments, and he believes the odds are strong that someone will.\n\nIndeed, there are numerous indicators of growing interest in researching this\nfield and providing funding for it. As noted, the US government is developing\na research program. The Environmental Defense Fund is considering supporting\nscientists in the area and recently held a meeting to discuss guardrails that\nshould govern such work. And a number of major philanthropies that haven\u2019t\nsupported the field in the past are in advanced discussions to provide funding\nto research groups, sources tell MIT Technology Review.\n\nMeanwhile, under Keith, the University of Chicago is working to hire 10\nfaculty researchers in this area.\n\nHe says he wouldn\u2019t look to lead an outdoor experiment himself at this point,\nbut he does hope that people working with him at the Climate Systems\nEngineering Initiative would, if it could offer insights into the scientific\nquestions they\u2019re exploring.\n\n\u201cI absolutely want to see experiments happen from the University of Chicago,\u201d\nhe says.\n\n### by James Temple\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
