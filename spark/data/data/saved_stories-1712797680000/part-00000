The problem is the work you've done so far might not be enough to\nget started. At any given moment there are thousands of new developers\nfighting for their first job and employers are demanding more and more for\ntheir junior roles. Just take a look at this job post:\n\nNow if you can confidently say YES to every single one of these requirements\nand prove it in an interview, then congratulations! You really don\u2019t need to\nstay on this page any more. But if you can\u2019t, then you need to face the\ntruth...\n\nYou have no real-world experience\n\nMany Junior developers are shocked to learn that working in a professional\ndevelopment team is completely different from building projects and\napplications on your own. Online courses and tutorials are great for giving\nyou the \u201cknow-how\u201d to code, but they're unlikely to help you get and keep your\nfirst job. So when you do work up the courage to apply, you\u2019re most likely\ngoing to end up with rejections like this:\n\nPolite but soul crushing after all the hard work you\u2019ve put in to getting to\nthis point. Here\u2019s what these recruiters have failed to tell you... You must\nfind a way to stand out to start getting offers:\n\nThe React Job Simulator is a fast track to your first job\n\nThis first-of-its-kind program has been designed by an experienced Senior\nReact Developer to give you the knowledge, skills and experience to help you\nland your first React job.\n\n1\\. Learn a professional git workflow\n\nGit will be the foundation of your work and workflow as a professional\ndeveloper. You\u2019ll discover how to:\n\nConfidently create, merge and review Pull Requests\n\nWork with Continuous Integration Pipelines\n\n\u201cthe Git and GitHub experience has been fantastic... Very much a good idea to\ngive you a better idea of how branches and pull requests actually work.\u201d\n\nDan\n\nVerified member\n\n2\\. Work on an existing codebase\n\nYou\u2019ll almost always work on an existing codebase, but navigating an\nunfamiliar codebase can be overwhelming. You\u2019ll learn how to:\n\nNavigate an unfamiliar codebase with ease\n\nCreate bug fixes and UI changes\n\n\u201cI recently started a frontend apprenticeship working with React and many of\nthe tasks I\u2019m given are similar to this course. It allowed me to jump right in\nand start working on their codebase with more confidence.\u201d\n\nAlison Lee\n\nVerified member\n\n3\\. Build a UI kit based on Figma designs\n\nEvery front-end developer needs to know how to work with professional designs.\nYou\u2019ll learn how to:\n\nImplement pixel-perfect designs with Figma\n\nDocument components with Storybook\n\n\u201cGot the job and they're starting me on Monday! The pixel-perfect design\ntechnique I learned here blew them away!\u201d\n\nMartin\n\nVerified member\n\n4\\. Learn how to write automated tests\n\nTesting is a rare, but critical skill for Junior Developers. You\u2019ll learn how\nto:\n\nWrite test with Cypress\n\nDebug your tests\n\n\u201cI never bothered with testing and fancy app design. Now I am looking for a\nnew job and everyone wants TDD and proper project design.\u201d\n\nDavid\n\nVerified member\n\n5\\. Implement your own features\n\nProfessional projects are often split into features, discussed, planned and\nprioritized. You\u2019ll learn how to:\n\nWork through feature requests from a Kanban board\n\nPractice everything by writing code based on designs and covering your work\nwith automated tests\n\n\u201cDiscovering this program has been a fantastic experience...you learn how to\nstructure a React project for scalability while implementing features based on\nhigh-quality Figma designs.\u201d\n\nAri\n\nVerified member\n\n6\\. Community\n\nYou\u2019ll get access to a private Discord community where you\u2019ll find support,\nhelp and inspiration from a Senior React developer and other members.\n\nAccess to a Senior developer with 10+ years of professional experience\n\nConnect with fellow students\n\n\u201cThe Discord community does a great job helping with any problems I would\nstruggle with.\u201d\n\nNukabunny\n\nVerified member\n\n7\\.

Before you continue, I want to explain who this is NOT for..\n\nBeginners\n\nYou\u2019ll need an understanding of React, JavaScript, HTML & CSS and ideally you\nshould have built a small project on your own as well.\n\nTutorial Junkies\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for your next tutorial or expect a lot of \u201chandholding\u201d with\nstep by step instructions, this program is not for you.\n\nThis program will help you, but not right now.

I've been working with React since January 2016 and throughout my\ncareer, I\u2019ve worked with a variety of teams in both small startups and large\nenterprises. This has given me invaluable insights into different working\nenvironments and development practices.\n\nThe React Job Simulator is the kind of program I wish existed when I was\nstarting my journey. Back then, I had no exposure to professional developers,\nno one to compare myself to, and no idea about best practices or go-to tools.\n\nThis lack of guidance and knowledge became painfully obvious during my first\nfew job interviews. It took me years to get to a point where I could join a\nnew team and immediately adopt their tools, workflows and processes. But with\nthe knowledge I have now I comfortably make six figures a year and take\nseveral months off to spend time with my family.\n\nSo when I say I understand the challenges you face, I mean it. And I\u2019ve\ndesigned this program to help you skip several years of learning and\nconfidently navigate the job market to land your first React job.\n\nSimple pricing\n\nChoose your membership level below and get instant lifetime access to the\nReact Job Simulator.\n\nJob Seeker Expert\n\n$499\n\n$249\n\nOne time Payment\n\nDiscover how professional teams are structured\n\nDiscover real-world team processes\n\nLearn how to work with a professional Git workflow\n\nDiscover professional code/folder structures\n\nLearn how to work through tasks on a Kanban board\n\nLearn how to build features based on Figma designs\n\nLearn how to write automated tests with Cypress\n\nGet access and support in a private Discord\n\nInstant lifetime access including future updates\n\n7 day money back guarantee\n\nUnlimited support by AI mentor\n\nEligible for Job-Connector program\n\nOver-the-shoulder walkthrough videos\n\nGet a job-readiness assessment based on your code *\n\nGet a personalized roadmap based on your assessment *\n\nJoin the waitlist\n\n* To provide a meaningful job-readiness assessment, you have to finish at least 10 of the 21 tasks.\n\nJob Seeker Fast Track\n\n$299\n\n$179\n\nOne time Payment\n\nDiscover how professional teams are structured\n\nDiscover real-world team processes\n\nLearn how to work with a professional Git workflow\n\nDiscover professional code/folder structures\n\nLearn how to work through tasks on a Kanban board\n\nLearn how to build features based on Figma designs\n\nLearn how to write automated tests with Cypress\n\nGet access and support in a private Discord\n\nInstant lifetime access including future updates\n\n7 day money back guarantee\n\nUnlimited support by AI mentor\n\nEligible for Job-Connector program\n\nOver-the-shoulder walkthrough videos\n\nGet a job-readiness assessment based on your code\n\nGet a personalized roadmap based on your assessment\n\nJoin the waitlist\n\n* To provide a meaningful job-readiness assessment, you have to finish at least 10 of the 21 tasks.\n\nJob Seeker Basic\n\n$199\n\n$99\n\nOne time Payment\n\nDiscover how professional teams are structured\n\nDiscover real-world team processes\n\nLearn how to work with a professional Git workflow\n\nDiscover professional code/folder structures\n\nLearn how to work through tasks on a Kanban board\n\nLearn how to build features based on Figma designs\n\nLearn how to write automated tests with Cypress\n\nGet access and support in a private Discord\n\nInstant lifetime access including future updates\n\n7 day money back guarantee\n\nLimited support by AI mentor (5 messages per day)\n\nEligible for Job-Connector program\n\nOver-the-shoulder walkthrough videos\n\nGet a job-readiness assessment based on your code\n\nGet a personalized roadmap based on your assessment\n\nJoin the waitlist\n\n* To provide a meaningful job-readiness assessment, you have to finish at least 10 of the 21 tasks.\n\nThe next cohort starts in April 2024.
