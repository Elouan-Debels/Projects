(Photo\nby Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. - California spent $24 billion to tackle homelessness over\na five-year period but didn\u2019t consistently track the outcomes or effectiveness\nof its programs, according to state audit released Tuesday.\n\nThe report attempts to assess how effective the state and local cities have\nbeen spending billions of dollars to address the ongoing homelessness crisis\nin California.\n\nAn estimated 171,000 people are homeless in California, which amounts to\nroughly 30% of all of the homeless people in the U.S. Despite the roughly $24\nbillion spent on homeless and housing programs during the 2018-2023 fiscal\nyears, the problem didn\u2019t improve in many cities.\n\nAmong other things, the report found that the California Interagency Council\non Homelessness, which is responsible for coordinating agencies and allocating\nresources for homelessness programs, stopped tracking spending on programs and\ntheir outcomes in 2021 despite the continuous funding from the state. It also\nfailed to develop a collect and evaluate outcome data of these programs due to\nthe lack of a consistent method.\n\nWith makeshift tents lining streets and disrupting businesses in communities\nacross the state, homelessness has become one of the most frustrating issues\nin California.\n\nThe report notes that some data regarding the number of program participants\nand bed inventory in the state system might not be accurate or reliable.\n\nThe council, which lawmakers created to help the state deal with its\nhomelessness problem, also has only reported on homelessness spending once\nsince its creation in 2017, according to the report.\n\nWithout reliable and recent data on its spending, \"the state will continue to\nlack complete and timely information about the ongoing costs and associated\noutcomes of its homelessness programs,\" the audit contends.\n\nCalifornia funds more than 30 programs to tackle homelessness. The audit\nassesses five initiatives and finds only two of them \u2014 the efforts to turn\nhotel and motel rooms into housing and housing-related support program \u2014 are\n\"likely cost-effective.\" The remaining programs, which received collectively\n$9.4 billion since 2020, did not have enough data to be fully assessed, the\nreport says.\n\nThe state auditor also reviewed homelessness spending in two major cities, San\nJose and San Diego, and found both failed to effectively track revenues and\nspending due to the lack of spending plans.\n\n## DAILY NEWSLETTER\n\nAll the news you need to know, every day\n\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy\nPolicy and Terms of Service.\n\n## Most Watched\n\nView More\n\nvideo\n\n### Slow recovery for downtown areas across California\n\nvideo\n\n### 2-alarm fire breaks out at Hayward insulation company\n\nvideo\n\n### Nice, warmer\n\n### Trending\n\n#### Baba Vanga's 2024 predictions are apparently coming true\n\n#### Affordable housing applications for San Francisco educators available\n\n#### Santa Clara County spends $20M on contract nurses amid three-day strike\n\n#### Person found on fire in Oakland\n\n#### First responders detail the intense moments during dramatic Marin County\ncliff rescue\n\n  * facebook\n  * twitter\n  * instagram\n  * email\n  * youtube\n\n  * New Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * FCC Public File\n  * EEO Public File\n  * About Us\n  * Jobs and Internships\n  * Contact Us\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.\n\u00a92024 FOX Television Stations\n\n", "frontpage": false}
