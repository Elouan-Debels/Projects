Too many in\nfact, to the point where it hurts my brain. To ease this burden, I choose my\ntools carefully to minimize obstructions as the words pour from my mind,\nspilling through my fingers on their way to the screen.\n\nThat\u2019s a long-winded way of saying I\u2019m pretty persnickety about my keyboard.\nNow, I\u2019ve found out my favorite model has been discontinued, and I\u2019ll never\nagain know the pleasure of typing on its delicate keys. And I\u2019m mad about it.\nReal mad. Because I shouldn\u2019t be in this position to begin with!\n\n## T\u2019is Better To Have Loved And Lost\n\nI liked how the Sculpt design allowed my hands to lay naturally in line with\nmy arms, with no splaying of the wrists.\n\nAfter some research and a little trial and error, I found a keyboard that\nworked for me. I detest rectangular keyboards that forced my wrists into splay\ninwards in an unnatural way. It gave me all kinds of problems approaching the\nrealms of RSI and carpal tunnel and other ugly things.\n\nIn turn, I came to love the delicate curves of the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic\nDesktop. Wireless, sleek, beguiling. With the keys laid out in delicate three-\ndimensional curves, the keyboard met my hands in their natural resting\norientation, so perfectly I felt the keyboard had been made for me.\n\nNo more would my hands cramp and my wrists contort to find the keys. Instead,\nmy fingers would simply dance a few millimeters, deftly finding the keys as I\nneeded them. My typing was fast, clean, and my wrists barely moved an inch.\nThey rested deftly in position ready to deliver. Oh, bliss.\n\nLoving this keyboard as I did, I forgave it when it faltered just 6 months\ninto ownership. Dropped keys and dropped connections I could not withstand,\nbut I had the salve at hand. I\u2019d kept the receipt like some paper-hoarding\ndragon, and returned to darken the door of the office supply once more. I\nsuffered the side-eyes and probing questions and left with a new \u2018board fresh\nin box. Our love affair would continue as I racked up tens, hundreds of\nthousands of words with my new ally. We wrote together, we gamed together, we\nmoved house together. We were building a life together. My plastic friend was\nhelping me pay my bills. Nothing could stop us. The words flowed and the cash\nflowed in turn. Such is the life of a writer.\n\nThen came the break in.\n\nEvery computer I owned was stolen. Most of my guitars, too. Years of data,\nvideos, photos, projects... all gone when they carried my desktop out the\ndoor. They hadn\u2019t taken everything though. They\u2019d left behind my TV, my\nkettle, my toaster. Oh, and my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop. Mouse,\nkeyboard, and even the separate numeric keypad. It was all there, except...\n\nWith the desktop, left the dongle. Sans the dongle, my friend was dead.\n\n## Irreplaceable\n\nTalk to Logitech. They\u2019ll sell you a keyboard, or a mouse, or fifteen of each.\nSwap them in and out as you like, you can pair them all to a single Unifying\nReceiver. Lose the dongle, and fear nothing. Just buy another one and re-pair\nyour devices.\n\nMicrosoft couldn\u2019t find the time to implement this on the Sculpt Ergonomic\nDesktop. Fashionable engineers with houses with light fixtures more expensive\nthan my car were too busy to think of the consequences this would have on me,\nso many years and miles far removed.\n\nI tried a mechanical keyboard, but the rectangular layout just wasn\u2019t for me.\nNeither were the switches, and I didn\u2019t fancy spending months trying to find\nwhat I liked.\n\nIn the wake of the robbery, I didn\u2019t have time to mourn or weep. To a writer,\ntime is words and words are money. I needed money. I threw a cheap machine on\nmy credit card and got back to work. Now lean on funds, I had to economize on\na new keyboard. I couldn\u2019t afford another Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop.\nI had to make do with a $30 keyboard and mouse combo made of cheaper plastic\nthan most Coke bottles. My new instrument was cheap. The same 101 keys, but\nthe music they played wasn\u2019t as sweet.\n\nI rankled at having to buy a replacement. I still had a perfectly good\nkeyboard right here, why did I need to buy a new one when only the dongle was\nmissing? But alas, these are the ways of the Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop\u2014the\nmouse, the keyboard, and the numeric keypad. One dongle to bring them all, and\nin the darkness bind them.\n\nAfter 18 months, I relented. I could go on no more. Words had to flow, faster\nthan before. I couldn\u2019t rely on this cheap plastic from the store. I needed a\nbetter keyboard, my muse. I needed a faster way to pump out the news.\n\nBy now, the world had turned. The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop was done,\ndusted. Discontinued forever. Mine was useless without the original dongle,\nand remaining stock online was retailing for $800. I\u2019d have to move on.\n\n## Better, Somehow\n\nIt\u2019s not as radical looking as the Microsoft design, but the fundamentals are\nthere.\n\nThankfully, a blessed light shined from a local office store. Something akin\nto the glory of the Sculpt, but so slightly different. The Logitech Ergo K860\nwas designed with similar curves such that the keys meet the hand with a\nminimum of twist, with a supportive wrist pad to boot. It similarly had low-\ntravel keys for a light, laptop-like typing experience. I tried it out and\nfound it instantly familiar. My speed was up, mistakes down. My wrists once\nagain enjoying the comfort courtesy of a quality keyboard.\n\nPerhaps the greatest joy of the Logitech design, though, is that it dispenses\nwith the ridiculous notion of a dongle paired for life. Instead, it\u2019s more\nthan capable of being paired with any Logitech Unifying Receiver out there. I\ncan pair a mouse and a keyboard to a single receiver, using a single USB port,\nand if I want to swap either out, I can do so freely. There\u2019s no lock-in, and\nI\u2019m free to set up my desktop as I wish. If someone were to steal my computer\nagain, I could simply buy a new dongle and keep on using my perfectly good\nkeyboard the next day.\n\nThe Logitech has similarly magic curves.\n\nAs an engineer, I can perhaps understand why Microsoft didn\u2019t go this route.\nLogitech had to develop a piece of software for pairing its dongles and\nperipherals, which takes engineering time. That software needs to be written,\ntested, and likely maintained over time to ensure it stays compatible with\ntoday\u2019s ever-changing operating systems. Microsoft perhaps didn\u2019t see the\npoint in doing so.\n\nAt the same time, this is what separates Logitech from Microsoft in this\nregard. One is a dedicated manufacturer of quality peripherals to the\nexclusion of all else. The other does build hardware, but as a secondary\nconsideration, seldom achieving the same focus as its rivals.\n\nI still have my useless Microsoft Sculpt keyboard. DIY wired conversions\nexist. I wanna say that I\u2019ll do that one day, but for a use with a laptop,\nit\u2019s kinda too messy. Plus I always kinda hated how the wrist rest always\nlooked dirty. Nevermind.\n\nUltimately, I\u2019m happy that Logitech came through for me here. I needed a\nquality keyboard that fit me like a glove, and I have one once more. Plus, I\ndon\u2019t have to worry about the loss of a tiny USB dongle making my $200\nkeyboard worthless. That\u2019s a plus. Overall, I\u2019m about hardware that\u2019s robust\nand reusable, not fickle and fragile. That\u2019s what matters to me.\n\nPosted in Featured, Peripherals Hacks, RantsTagged dongle, keyboard,\nkeyboards, logitech, microsoft, Rant, replacable\n\n## 12 thoughts on \u201cMicrosoft Killed My Favorite Keyboard, And I\u2019m Mad About\nIt\u201d\n\n  1. jenningsthecat says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:22 am\n\nNow that you have a suitable replacement, I would suggest starting to set\naside money to buy at least one more \u2013 perhaps two or three \u2013 and find some\nway of storing the spare(s) securely offsite. When both your living and your\ncontinued health require specific items which may be hard to replace in the\nfuture, it\u2019s best to get replacements ASAP to help you recover from the next\ndisaster.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  2. Kleber Oliveira says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:25 am\n\nI share your pain, I was also a victim of Microsoft\u2019s laziness, I had a\nkeyboard and mouse kit that I loved and took very good care of, almost\npaternally. The dongle was gone and all that was left was the frustration of\nhaving to discard 95% of the hardware because of a simple Usb receiver. I\nfound comfort in Dell, they have excellent solutions and they are all\ncompatible with Bluetooth.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  3. Dark_Tracer says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:27 am\n\nI too fell in love with the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard, but never understood\nMicrosoft\u2019s incoherent decision to bind the peripherals to one, and only one,\nreceiver. The day I lost the dongle, was the day that I swore off any future\nkeyboards and mice from Redmond.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  4.

Even less mechanical keyboards.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  5. Jan Praegert says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:31 am\n\nThey killed the simple Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse. I love that mouse. Pure\ngenius. The small vibration motor inside. So nice.\n\nI\u2019m with you with the keyboard, too. I had a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000\nuntil some coffee separated our ways... It was great, and they didn\u2019t sell\nthem at when \u201cthe incident\u201d happened. So sad.\n\nI do not understand why they discontinue their range of popular mice,\nkeyboards, and PC accessories. Why can\u2019t they make it stylish? Add colorful\nkeyboards, not only the dull black stuff. Can I get a rainbow, please?\n\nMake it into collector items!\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  6.

Do that! Hack your Microsoft keyboard to make it live again.\n:-)\n\nHere\u2019s a starting point: https://emmanuelcontreras.com/2017/06/07/how-to-\ndisassemble-microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-and-make-it-wired/\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t want to do that, look at the last pic on that website.\nMicrosoft used a NRF24LE1. This is a NRF24L01+ radio + a 8051 core, easily\nprogrammable and with great C support using the SDCC compiler. A little\nprogramming elbow grease and you could role your own interface with a dongle\neasily made from something like a Teensy (HID USB!) and NRF24L01 clone chip.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. TG says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 11:05 am\n\nAlso I notice from the photos that the original circuit board comes with a\nhandy array of test points for all of the ribbon cable pins, so fabricating\nthat little adapter PCB isn\u2019t totally necessary. It would be very easy to saw\noff that part of the board, solder to the pads, and have an adapter to\nwhatever Teensy or ESP you want. I would want to go that way and use an\nexisting library instead of trying to reprogram the original to talk to\nsomething else, but that\u2019s just personal preference.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1. Dan Julio says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 11:22 am\n\nYup. I thought that too. Could probably even just unsolder the 24LE1 instead\nof cutting the PCB as it looks like all the key array signal go to GPIOs on\nit. Then use some dev board supported by QMK. Which lead me to the following\nlink with a wired controller: https://chadaustin.me/2021/02/wired-sculpt/\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  7. TG says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:41 am\n\nI find plenty of these on ebay. One is around ninety dollars, includes the\ndongle. Just get a used one, maybe two. Then you can begin to add your DNA to\nthe wrist pad all over again.\n\nAlso, if there are wired conversions out there, then bluetooth conversions are\ncertainly possible... Keep the keyboard anyway, you might resurrect it. I\u2019ve\nconverted plenty of ancient keyboards to modern wireless or wired devices\u2014at\nfirst it seems a lot more intimidating than it actually is. All the wiring is\nalready there, you just need to map the rows and columns and cram in a\nmicrocontroller board with HID support and the form of connectivity you\ndesire. The libraries are already written many times over.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  8. Beaker says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 11:24 am\n\nThis is hackaday, isn\u2019t it? Home of keebin with kristina, endless homebrew\nkeyboards, and a community of people with experience that would support you\nresurrecting your fallen board? Stop complaining, get hacking.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  9. Rory says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 11:46 am\n\nWeird how similar this is to my experience with the same keyboard. My dongle\nbroke rather than being stolen, but like the author came to find that they are\npermanently paired and the dongle cannot be replaced. Had to throw the whole\nkeyboard out. Stupid.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  10. Will B. says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 11:48 am\n\nI hate to reinforce your pain, but you\u2019ve GOT to have off-site backups. I\u2019m a\nfull-time RVer, and this place is less secure than an apartment. I\u2019ve got a\nbig ol\u2019 Synology DS1522+ NAS tucked in a cabinet, but I back it up (important\nstuff, not media like Movies and TV, but definitely all documents, articles,\n30 years of PHOTOS from a lifetime) to a Hertzner Storage Box. (It\u2019s about the\ncheapest offline storage there is!) I don\u2019t have Internet every day (imagine\nthat!) or fat bandwidth, unless using my Starlink, but... it runs if it can.\nAnd the laptops (me, wife) backup to the NAS so it gets included. I went FOUR\nyears without this, and EVERY day I was scared as hell. In fact, my original\nNAS was a Drobo 5N, and I was getting very concerned about its remaining\nlifetime. The amount of pressure off my mind now is amazing.\n\nAnyone reading this ... do it now, stop procrastinating. I got lucky.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
