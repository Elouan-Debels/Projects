Until now they have all compromised on sustainability by\nbeing very difficult to repair, in effect making them disposable.\n\nThe Fairbuds cost \u00a3129 (\u20ac149) and are designed from the ground up to be as\nsustainable as possible, combining fair trade and recycled materials with\nreplaceable parts that can be swapped in and out with a standard small\nscrewdriver.\n\nOn the surface they look like any other mid-range earbuds. The case has a\nflip-top lid, a pairing button and magnetic charging slots for the earbuds.\nThe buds have a familiar shape with silicone ear tips and an oval outer that\npoints down towards your mouth.\n\nThe tops of the earbuds are touch-sensitive panels for playback and volume\ncontrols. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nIt is only the outline of a battery and a small screw in the bottom that marks\nthe Fairbuds out as different. Unscrew it to release the innards of the case\nfrom the translucent outer shell and pop out the battery just like the\nFairbuds XL or a Fairphone 5.\n\nThe earbuds have a little door hidden behind a silicone sleeve, which opens to\nreveal a small button battery ready to be replaced once it wears out. The\ndesign seems so simple you wonder why no one has tried it before.\n\nThe oval top of the earbuds has a touch-sensitive surface for a good set of\ncontrols. Tap once, twice or thrice for playback controls, slide your finger\nup and down for volume, or touch and hold on the right to switch noise-\ncancelling modes or the left to trigger your phone\u2019s voice assistant. Take out\nan earbud and the music pauses.\n\nReplacing the battery in the case takes less than a minute with only one small\nPhillips screw to undo. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe earbuds feel light and fit well, remaining secure and comfortable in my\nears for long listening sessions. They are sweat resistant, but do not have\nany wings or hooks to keep them in place, so are less suitable for exercise\nthan general wear.\n\n## Specifications\n\n  * Water resistance: IP54 (splash)\n\n  * Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3 (SBC, AAC)\n\n  * Battery life: Six hours ANC off (up to 26 hours with case)\n\n  * Earbud weight: 5g\n\n  * Earbud dimensions: 28.7 x 24.6 x 21mm\n\n  * Driver size: 11mm\n\n  * Charging case weight: 68g\n\n  * Charging case dimensions: 65 x 65 x 27mm\n\n  * Case charging: USB-C\n\n## Solid battery life for Android or iPhone\n\nThe Fairbuds app for Android or iPhone shows battery life, handles updates,\nhas a full equaliser and guides to the various batteries and modular parts of\nthe earbuds. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nReplaceable batteries do not mean the earbuds are short on battery life. They\nlast between five and six hours with noise cancelling active and can be\nrecharged just over three times by the case, which is competitive with\nmainstream rivals.\n\nThe Fairbuds are standard Bluetooth 5.3 earbuds, supporting the usual SBC and\nAAC audio formats, ready to work with Androids, iPhones, Macs or PCs. They\nalso have multipoint for connecting to two devices simultaneously \u2013 handy for\njuggling calls with watching videos. The Bluetooth connection was strong to\nvarious devices but experienced a small skip here and there in the highest of\ninterference areas, such as a packed St Pancras railway station concourse.\n\nCall quality is pretty good, sounding clear and natural in quiet environments\nand doing a great job of blocking unwanted noise on busy streets while\nremaining clear. You have to talk up a bit for the earbuds to pick up your\nvoice, however.\n\n## Sound and noise cancelling\n\nThe standard silicone tips, of which three sizes are provided, produce a good\nseal for music and noise cancelling. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Fairbuds have decent but not class-leading noise cancelling. It handles\nlow-end rumbles well and dampens the general hubbub of an office \u2013 but\nstruggles with higher pitched noise such as the roar of tyres on the road or\nannouncements on a train. The ambient mode is fairly natural sounding but is\nquite quiet and has a constant hum of white noise in the background.\n\nThe Fairbuds will not win any awards for audio quality but, on the whole, have\nan easy listening sound that is decent on detail with reasonable separation of\ntones. They can be a bit flat in certain parts of tracks, and they do a better\njob with rock or grunge tracks than something grand such as orchestral music.\n\nAs is common for budget earbuds, the noise cancelling also changes the quality\nof the audio, making it a bit more forward and energetic but also sounding\nmore closed. There is an equaliser in the Fairbuds app to alter the balance\nfor personal preference.\n\nA bigger problem was latency causing lip-sync error, where video and audio are\nnot in perfect alignment, across multiple devices and platforms, including\nNetflix and YouTube. Fairphone said it was aware of the problem and was\nworking on a fix, but not imminently.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nReplacing the standard rechargeable button battery in the earbuds is a three-\nminute job. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nFairphone says the batteries will maintain at least 80% of their original\ncapacity for more than 500 full-charge cycles. Replacements cost \u00a39 for a pair\nfor the earbuds and \u00a312 for the case. Fairphone offers a three-year warranty,\nwhile replacement earbuds as well as charging-case inners and outers will be\navailable for at-home repair.\n\nFairphone recycles the equivalent weight of electronics for each set of\nearbuds sold, making it e-waste neutral. It uses fair cobalt, gold and silver\nand recycled plastic, rare earth elements and tin. The firm also tops up the\npay of its contract manufacturing workers to a living wage.\n\n## Price\n\nThe Fairphone Fairbuds cost \u00a3129 and come in a choice of black or white.\n\nFor comparison, the Fairbuds XL cost \u00a3219, the Nothing Ear 2 \u00a3109 and the\nAirPods Pro \u00a3229.\n\n## Verdict\n\nThe Fairbuds prove that modern Bluetooth earbuds do not have to be disposable,\nand that companies such as Apple, Bose, Sennheiser and Sony should be trying\nharder on this front.\n\nThey look good, work and fit well, and have most of the modern conveniences of\nrivals. They have a decent easy listening sound and reasonable noise\ncancelling, which will not trouble the best in the market but get the job\ndone.\n\nAs with other Fairphone products, you are paying a bit over the odds to be\nmore sustainable and ethical. The Fairbuds have the sound and noise cancelling\nof lower mid-range buds costing in the \u00a390 to 100 range, meaning you are\npaying about \u00a330 more for the replaceable batteries and fairer manufacturing.\n\nThere are some niggles that need sorting out for a wholehearted\nrecommendation, the biggest of which is the lip-sync error. But Fairphone\nshould be commended for showing what is possible with smart design.\n\n> Pros: replaceable batteries, recycled and ethical materials, decent sound,\n> noise cancelling, multipoint, comfortable, good controls, sweat resistance,\n> solid battery life, cross-platform app.\n>\n> Cons: lip-sync problems, slightly more expensive than rivals for the design,\n> noise cancelling changes sound quality and struggles with higher tones,\n> audio quality cannot match the best.\n\nThe case is bigger than the best but still pocketable and in line with rivals\nat this price.
