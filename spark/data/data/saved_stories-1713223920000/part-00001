We're going to see\n\n00:59\n\nmore low code and no code tools.\n\n01:00\n\nWe're going to see the ability\n\n01:02\n\nfor people to step in and to build things.\n\n01:04\n\nAnd to your point, I think absolutely,\n\n01:06\n\nif you cause an application to be developed,\n\n01:09\n\nyou developed an application.\n\n01:10\n\nOkay.\n\n01:11\n\nIt's great to use GPT to write code,\n\n01:15\n\nbut if it breaks, can you fix it?\n\n01:18\n\nAnd to fix it, you really need to understand it.\n\n01:20\n\nI think some of the distrust is healthy.\n\n01:23\n\nBecause, I...\n\n01:24\n\nExample, I actually found myself in the last week\n\n01:27\n\ntaking a set of monthly data.\n\n01:30\n\nI asked it for the sum and it gave it to me.\n\n01:31\n\nI asked it for the average and it was...\n\n01:33\n\nIt actually was 11 months instead of 12,\n\n01:35\n\nand it divided by 12 and it made a mistake,\n\n01:37\n\nright? Interesting.\n\n01:38\n\nI think there's a real danger in all of us\n\n01:40\n\nkind of opting into the ease\n\n01:42\n\nand letting all the quality plummet.\n\n01:44\n\nRight? Yeah.\n\n01:45\n\nSo I think it's important for developers\n\n01:46\n\nto really view this properly as a very intelligent assistant\n\n01:50\n\nthat can make them extremely productive\n\n01:53\n\nbut that the distrust, at least now, is quite healthy.\n\n01:55\n\nOne question that I wanna ask before we leave this area,\n\n01:58\n\nand this is probably primarily for you, Victor,\n\n02:00\n\nis does a large language model have the ability\n\n02:03\n\nto perform what we would consider intuitive leaps\n\n02:08\n\nor intuitive reasoning?\n\n02:10\n\nAnd if not, how far off from that are we?\n\n02:12\n\nYeah, everything the model generates\n\n02:14\n\nit's trying to be conditioned\n\n02:16\n\nin everything it's seen so far.\n\n02:17\n\nBut on the other hand, cognitive leaps\n\n02:20\n\nsort of require abandoning everything that...\n\n02:22\n\nAll the evidence you've seen right now\n\n02:24\n\nand exploring a completely new and approach to the problem.\n\n02:27\n\nAnd so my perspective,\n\n02:28\n\nI think we will really need new model architectures\n\n02:32\n\nto sort of replicate the kind of cognitive leaps\n\n02:36\n\nthat humans are really, really good at.\n\n02:38\n\nThe ability to sort of zoom out,\n\n02:40\n\nintegrate additional evidence,\n\n02:41\n\nplan, course correct, take in feedback.\n\n02:44\n\nThink current transformer models are just not great at that\n\n02:48\n\nand so we'll need some sort of\n\n02:49\n\ninnovation in that space to do that.\n\n02:51\n\n[jazz music] [plates sliding]\n\n02:55\n\nWe wanna move on sort of\n\n02:56\n\nto a deeper layer in this conversation\n\n02:57\n\nand that layer is AI is going to affect teams,\n\n03:01\n\nand tools, and businesses.\n\n03:02\n\nWill the idea of having an always-on AI assistant\n\n03:06\n\nas part of your software development team\n\n03:09\n\nkind of be a thing?\n\n03:11\n\nWell, I definitely think, you know, you're right.\n\n03:12\n\nI definitely think the individuals on the team\n\n03:14\n\nwill all have their assistants, right?\n\n03:16\n\nAnd I think we can all agree,\n\n03:18\n\nit'll probably allow us to have smaller teams.\n\n03:21\n\nBut I also think for even large teams\n\n03:22\n\nthat need to remain large\n\n03:24\n\nor even maybe aren't even teams of developers,\n\n03:27\n\nI think there will be actually specialized assistants\n\n03:30\n\nthat are meant to actually assist teams, right?\n\n03:32\n\nAnd help them, you know,\n\n03:34\n\neliminate some of the communication tax.\n\n03:38\n\nSo you see AI actually stepping\n\n03:39\n\nmore into a project manager role?\n\n03:44\n\nYeah, I mean, I would love to be reminded\n\n03:45\n\nof all the things I forget.\n\n03:46\n\n[everyone laughs]\n\n03:47\n\nYou know, but seriously, right?\n\n03:48\n\nI do think that there we will see things like that,\n\n03:52\n\nsupervisory work.\n\n03:53\n\nI mean you even see the...\n\n03:55\n\nYou even seen the beginnings of that\n\n03:56\n\nin some productivity suites, right?\n\n03:57\n\nVery rudimentary versions of that,\n\n03:59\n\nthis is gonna take that, just I think to the next level.\n\n04:01\n\nI think syntax is going to become less and less important,\n\n04:07\n\nbut the thinking, the pseudo code...\n\n04:10\n\n[Will] Yeah.\n\n04:11\n\nUnderstanding how to actually design and architect,\n\n04:13\n\nand what you need to actually happen,\n\n04:15\n\nhow to group logic in our systems.\n\n04:19\n\nCertainly, AI can assist with that\n\n04:21\n\nbut I think that is where we're really gonna thrive,\n\n04:23\n\nwhere that creativity comes in.\n\n04:25\n\nAt the end of the day, you know,\n\n04:26\n\nit's not really the jobs we want\n\n04:27\n\nbut the things the jobs do or produce that we want.\n\n04:30\n\nI'm interested in the idea\n\n04:32\n\nof coding being a language adjacent task,\n\n04:35\n\nsomething that LLMs can be very good at.\n\n04:37\n\nI'm interested also in potentially the idea of,\n\n04:40\n\nlike a team LLM that enforces coding standards\n\n04:43\n\nand makes it so that you never have to refactor your code.\n\n04:45\n\nYour code is live refactored by the AI that, you know,\n\n04:50\n\nmake sure your variables are all named\n\n04:51\n\naccording to the company standard\n\n04:52\n\nand makes sure that your sub routines\n\n04:54\n\nare all named according to the company...\n\n04:55\n\nYou know, like is that a potentially a realistic task?\n\n04:58\n\n[Victor] Yes. For, okay.\n\n05:00\n\nSo you mentioned earlier that maybe\n\n05:03\n\ncode is a language adjacent task.\n\n05:06\n\nI might disagree slightly\n\n05:07\n\nbecause language is text It's smack in the middle.\n\n05:09\n\n[folks laughing] [crosstalk]\n\n05:11\n\nWell it is text, right?\n\n05:12\n\nAnd so the exact same sort of generation mechanisms\n\n05:15\n\nthat let LLMs work well for language,\n\n05:17\n\nwould let LLMs work well-\n\n05:18\n\nThe guessing of what comes next.\n\n05:19\n\nExactly, will make them work just so well for coding.\n\n05:22\n\nAnd so all of this brings up the perspective of data.\n\n05:25\n\nSo where does the LLM learn this coding standards from?\n\n05:28\n\nI think traditionally in tech and in engineering teams,\n\n05:31\n\nwe've built a sort of solar system where code is the sun\n\n05:35\n\nand all the other specialties revolve around code.\n\n05:39\n\nAnd I think AI is flipping that on its head,\n\n05:42\n\nand obviously code will still be a driver,\n\n05:45\n\nbut our work, I think, will spread out\n\n05:47\n\nto these sort of satellites that follow around it.\n\n05:50\n\nAnd I would encourage folks to not only learn about AI\n\n05:53\n\nand learn how to utilize these LLMs and other tools,\n\n05:56\n\nbut focus on security, focus on ops,\n\n06:00\n\nfocus on the different areas that allow AI to excel.\n\n06:04\n\nI really believe that once teams and individuals\n\n06:07\n\nstart using this technology, they're gonna come up\n\n06:09\n\nwith incredibly creative ways to use it\n\n06:12\n\nthat we haven't even considered.\n\n06:14\n\nAnd it's one of those, you know,\n\n06:15\n\nreally exciting times in technology\n\n06:16\n\nwhere we're gonna see a bunch of applications and use cases\n\n06:20\n\nin like two, three, four, five years\n\n06:22\n\nthat just kind of blow our minds.\n\n06:23\n\nWe're gonna start out with tasks\n\n06:25\n\nlike that LLMs can reliably address today,\n\n06:29\n\nwriting small functions.\n\n06:31\n\nTeams are gonna realize this and figure out a good way\n\n06:33\n\nto delegate that really well to LLMs,\n\n06:36\n\nget more efficient that way.\n\n06:38\n\nWe're gonna figure out how to give these LLMs\n\n06:41\n\naccess to tools so that they can act on our behalf.\n\n06:44\n\nAnd of course we need to do that\n\n06:45\n\nin a safe and responsible manner.\n\n06:47\n\nAnd then at the end of this spectrum\n\n06:49\n\nis this really complex task that require multiple entities\n\n06:52\n\nsort of interacting in a dynamic environment.\n\n06:55\n\nAnd I think the future is how we get groups of these agents\n\n06:59\n\nsort of interact with the humans\n\n07:01\n\nin a reliable, safe, and responsible manner\n\n07:03\n\nto sort of start to solve complex problems\n\n07:05\n\nand make everyone more efficient.\n\n07:07\n\nExcellent, excellent.\n\n07:08\n\n[jazz music] [coffee pouring]\n\n07:12\n\nWe've reached kind of\n\n07:13\n\nthe next section of our conversation here.\n\n07:16\n\nAnd in this one we're gonna talk about\n\n07:18\n\nhow AI affects the industry as a whole.\n\n07:20\n\nAnd we're gonna talk a little bit about the past\n\n07:22\n\nand we're gonna talk a little bit about the future.\n\n07:24\n\nAnd it seems like one of the ways\n\n07:25\n\nin which we were able to make this tremendous quantum leap\n\n07:27\n\nwith the introduction of AI,\n\n07:28\n\nwas the breadth of training data.\n\n07:30\n\nAnd from that, the data space was large enough\n\n07:32\n\nthat fascinating behavior emerged.\n\n07:36\n\nFor the next 20 years of AI,\n\n07:39\n\nwe won't have that stepping stone,\n\n07:40\n\nwe won't have that gigantic initial kickstart\n\n07:43\n\nof just this massive trove of data to feed into it.\n\n07:46\n\nSo how might the tools evolve without that?\n\n07:51\n\nI'm less interested in what\n\n07:54\n\nthe next wave of AI companies is going to be\n\n07:57\n\nand more interested in the next, next wave.\n\n07:58\n\nBecause I think right now, we're in a bit of a gold rush\n\n08:02\n\nwhere we've had this massive transformation,\n\n08:05\n\nwe understand the potential and so a lot of the companies\n\n08:09\n\nyou see popping up right now are really wrappers\n\n08:12\n\nover other tools. Right.\n\n08:13\n\nRight, right, right, yes.\n\n08:14\n\nAnd bless 'em, we love it, there's space for everyone.\n\n08:17\n\nBut I'm really interested in the sort of, you know,\n\n08:19\n\nto your point, those real world use cases.\n\n08:21\n\nHow does AI impact...\n\n08:23\n\nAnd not just LLMs or Generative AI,\n\n08:25\n\nhow does supervised learning\n\n08:27\n\nactually impact different industries?\n\n08:29\n\nSo one trend we're seeing right now\n\n08:30\n\nis the desire to integrate, you know,\n\n08:33\n\nproprietary information into the Generative AI experience.\n\n08:38\n\nMore and more we're seeing customers\n\n08:40\n\nwanna build applications but they're built either\n\n08:43\n\non data that's in their database about their customers\n\n08:45\n\nor about their products,\n\n08:46\n\nthings that the LLM wouldn't know ahead of time\n\n08:49\n\nand things they don't even want to give up\n\n08:51\n\nto a third party. Right, right.\n\n08:53\n\n[Will] And that's one thing we're very focused on\n\n08:55\n\nat MongoDB and this is where vector databases-\n\n08:57\n\nRight.\n\n08:58\n\nAnd where those come in and how those can help do that\n\n08:59\n\nin a way that protects your proprietary information\n\n09:02\n\nbut allows the artificial intelligence\n\n09:04\n\nto use that information.\n\n09:05\n\nSo it could be an application experience\n\n09:08\n\nthat is conversing with the user\n\n09:10\n\nbased on that user's own personal private data.\n\n09:14\n\nOr it could be based on the product catalog of the company,\n\n09:17\n\nlet's say, it's an e-commerce company.\n\n09:18\n\n[Lee] Right.\n\n09:19\n\nBut certainly data that's not generally available.\n\n09:21\n\nSo as opposed to looking at the big things,\n\n09:24\n\nwhat about the small things?\n\n09:25\n\nYou know, I feel AI is driving whole new behaviors.\n\n09:30\n\nSo if you think about it, let's say I'm a developer\n\n09:33\n\nand let's say I wanted to build\n\n09:35\n\nan image processing application.\n\n09:37\n\nNow to do this, there are probably\n\n09:39\n\nlike five different libraries I can use.\n\n09:41\n\nBut then I noticed that the LLM\n\n09:42\n\nwas good at just one particular library.\n\n09:45\n\nAnd maybe both of the library I was gonna to use,\n\n09:47\n\nbut then I use it just because the LLM\n\n09:49\n\nhas more capabilities on that library and then it helps me.\n\n09:52\n\nSo here, the tool is driving\n\n09:55\n\nthe choices I make as a developer.\n\n09:57\n\nAnd then I write more code with this library,\n\n10:00\n\nthen this becomes a big part of the training set\n\n10:03\n\nand you can imagine what happens as part of that.\n\n10:04\n\nRight.\n\n10:05\n\nAnd so essentially, AI is changing behaviors\n\n10:09\n\nand the long term is gonna have effects.\n\n10:11\n\nFolks, I think that brings us\n\n10:12\n\nabout to the end of our time.\n\n10:13\n\nI wanna extend a huge thanks to everyone being here.\n\n10:16\n\nEmily, Will, Victor, thank you guys for making the time\n\n10:18\n\nto come and have this wonderful discussion\n\n10:20\n\nabout artificial intelligence.\n\n10:21\n\nI learned a lot and I hope you guys had a great time too.\n\n10:24\n\nSo thank you very, very much.\n\n10:25\n\nThank you.
