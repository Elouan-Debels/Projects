Hint: The Pentagon Is Cashing In.\n\nThe average US taxpayer sent $58 to fund antiwar diplomacy efforts versus\n$5,109 for militarism and its support systems.\n\nBy\n\n    Lindsay Koshgarian ,\n    Truthout\n\nPublished\n\n    April 14, 2024\n\nF35 fighter aircraft is displayed during a visit to the Lockheed Martin\naerospace and defense company in Fort Worth, Texas, on December 10,\n2023.JASPER JACOBS / BELGA MAG / AFP via Getty Images\n\nEvery year at tax time, the National Priorities Project at the Institute for\nPolicy Studies releases a tax receipt to show where your federal income tax\ndollars go.\n\nEvery year, militarism in all its forms is one of the biggest expenses on the\nreceipt. From war and weapons, to deportations and detentions, to prisons and\npolicing, budgeting choices made in Congress mean that every U.S. taxpayer\nwill contribute to these systems of violence and oppression. By comparison,\nalmost every constructive government program \u2014 from public health and\nenvironmental protection to education and disaster management \u2014 is woefully\nunderfunded.\n\nFor 2023, the average taxpayer will have contributed $5,109 to militarism and\nits support systems, including war and the military, homeland security,\nfederal law enforcement and veterans\u2019 programs. The biggest portion of that\ntax bill is for the Pentagon itself at $2,974. More than half of that, $1,748,\ngoes to corporate contractors that benefit from U.S. militarism. That\u2019s more\nthan the average monthly rent in the United States.\n\nThe average taxpayer gives more to the single largest Pentagon contractor,\nLockheed Martin ($249), than to the child tax credit ($110). That\u2019s the\nprogram that was responsible for cutting child poverty nearly in half when it\nwas briefly expanded during the pandemic. Further expansion of the child tax\ncredit would have a far greater impact than throwing more money at Lockheed\nMartin, and yet the weapons maker continues to profit from inflated Pentagon\nspending, with $9 billion in dividends to shareholders and stock buybacks in\n2023.\n\nLikewise, the average taxpayer gives more for Pentagon contracts with Boeing\n($87) than for the Federal Aviation Administration ($23), the agency\nresponsible for commercial airline safety. That\u2019s too bad, since Boeing has\nhad a string of safety failures on its commercial flights in the last few\nyears, from planes crashing to coming apart midair. Aviation experts and\nwhistleblowers have exposed ways that Boeing repeatedly chose profit over\nsafety.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nWar & Peace\n\n## Israel\u2019s Genocide in Gaza Is Provoking Tax Resistance in the US\n\nAs April 15 approaches, antiwar groups are responding to a surge of interest\nin tax resistance as a form of protest.\n\nBy\n\n    Arvind Dilawar ,\n    Truthout\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nThen there\u2019s SpaceX, one of the many vanity projects of Elon Musk. SpaceX is a\nrelatively new and minor player in the Pentagon contract game, so the average\ntaxpayer paid just $12 for SpaceX contracts from NASA and the Pentagon\ncombined. That\u2019s still more than the tax bill for renewable energy and energy\nefficiency. At less than $11, the average tax bill for renewable energy is a\ntestament to the deep failures of public policy to address the root causes of\nclimate change.\n\nThe list goes on. Beyond Pentagon contractors, taxpayers are footing the bill\n(at $110 each) for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and\nBorder Protection (CBP), the agencies responsible for deportations and\ndetentions that criminalize immigration and torment immigrant communities.\nCompare that to just $29 for refugee assistance, and it\u2019s clear that the\npunitive immigration system in the U.S. is a policy choice born directly from\nthe budget.\n\nOther choices that fund militarism and control instead of humane solutions are\njust as striking. The average taxpayer contributed more for federal prisons\n($32.29) than for mental health and substance use programs ($31.69). Given\nthat the vast majority of incarcerated people are not in federal prisons but\nin state and local prisons and jails, the disparity is actually much wider\nthan that. Still, the comparison shows that decision makers see nothing wrong\nwith imprisoning people with mental illness and substance use disorders,\nrather than providing treatment.\n\nAnd of course, there is the cost of war. Since the beginning of the century,\nthe U.S. has almost always either been at war, or has been providing major\nsupport to someone else\u2019s war. The average taxpayer will have contributed $112\nto foreign militaries in 2023. Compare this to the $58 the average taxpayer\nfunds for diplomacy efforts to end and prevent wars.\n\nThe most devastating current example is the U.S. support for Israel\u2019s military\nassault on Gaza, through military aid to Israel that totals $3.8 billion this\nyear and may climb much higher if Congress passes legislation currently under\nnegotiation.\n\nLast year, without any additional military aid to Israel, the average taxpayer\nwill have contributed more than $14 to Israel\u2019s military. That\u2019s not making\nanyone safer. It\u2019s also the same amount that taxpayers contributed to wildfire\nmanagement, despite the fact that wildfires killed 183 Americans in 2023.\n\nThese priorities are all wrong. The consequences are absolute devastation in\nGaza, unnecessary suffering and trauma at the U.S. border and in immigrant\ncommunities, and a quality of life for ordinary U.S. residents that isn\u2019t what\nit should be \u2014 whether that means fewer funds available to cut child poverty,\nless resources for mental health or a federal deprioritization of the climate\ncrisis and its direct impacts.\n\nThe solution is a budget that changes these priorities to divest from\nmilitarism and invest in human needs here and around the world \u2014 something\nthat\u2019s only possible if taxpayers take a more active role. Amid ongoing\nresistance to U.S. support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, some people are\nexploring tax resistance, or withholding taxes that support Israel\u2019s war.\nOthers continue to participate in congressional call-ins and mass protest to\nclearly and consistently tell President Biden and Congress where they want\ntheir tax dollars to go \u2014 and where they don\u2019t.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
