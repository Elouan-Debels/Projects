Its\nleadership has a track record of analyzing a range of possible economic\noutcomes to be prepared for even the most unlikely outcome.\n\nIn his 2023 letter to shareholders, for example, Dimon said this included\nplanning for a \u201cvery broad range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even\nmore, with equally wide-ranging economic outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn all of these cases, courtesy of planning, Dimon said his \u201ccompany would\ncontinue to perform at least okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportantly, being prepared means we can continue to help our clients no\nmatter what the future portends,\u201d he added.\n\n## The \u2018OODA loop\u2019\n\nYet this preparedness isn\u2019t just a habit embedded into the culture at\nJPMorgan, it\u2019s a leadership tactic Dimon picked up from watching people in the\nmilitary.\n\nIn his letter released yesterday, Dimon began the section on management\nlessons by outlining the benefits of the \u201cOODA loop.\u201d\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe military, which often operates in extreme intensity of life\nand death and in the fog and uncertainty of war, uses the term \u2018OODA loop\u2019\n(observe, orient, decide, act\u2014repeat), a strategic process of constant review,\nanalysis, decision making, and action.\n\n\u201cOne cannot overemphasize the importance of observation and a full\nassessment\u2014the failure to do so leads to some of the greatest mistakes, not\nonly in war but also in business and government.\u201d\n\nCompleting a full assessment is \u201ccritical,\u201d Dimon noted, for both businesses\nand governments.\n\nIn business, the Harvard alumnus wrote, \u201cyou have to understand your\ncompetitors, their distribution, their economics, their innovations, and their\nstrengths and weaknesses.\u201d\n\nOn a geopolitical scale, this task is a little more complex.\n\nThe Wall Street titan noted elsewhere in his letter that the West had \u201cslept\u201d\nwhile China quietly established itself as a global superpower, with control\nover certain supplies necessary for America\u2019s economic and national security.\n\nHowever, Dimon said there was no point \u201ccrying over spilt milk\u201d and that\npolicymakers needed to \u201cfix\u201d the issue\u2014and the OODA loop may help.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cFor countries, you need a thorough grasp of their economies,\nstrengths and weaknesses, population and education, access to raw materials,\nlaws and regulations, history and culture.\n\n\u201cResearch, data and analytics should be at a very detailed level and\nconstantly reassessed. Only after you complete this diligent study can you\nstart to make plans with a high degree of success.\u201d\n\n## \u2018BS corporate speak\u2019\n\nThe 68-year-old has always had a reputation for being a no-nonsense leader who\nis frank about his personal beliefs\u2014be it politics, careers, or personal\nfinance.\n\nSo it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that Dimon doesn\u2019t subscribe to corporate jargon,\nexplaining there\u2019s a reason why he rarely rolls out a typical management\ntactic by talking about his vision.\n\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019ve always hesitated to talk about \u2018vision\u2019 is because often it\nis the basic BS of corporate speak\u2014that somehow if you impart your vision to\npeople, they will take the mountain,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat it really is all about is this: After you\u2019ve done your full assessment\nand decision-making, you can then continuously educate, explain, train,\nsimplify, propel and fight.\u201d\n\nInstead, Dimon took it back to military tactics by saying he wanted his team\nto know he was working and strategizing alongside them, saying vision \u201conly\nworks if people know you are in the trenches with them, if they understand the\nmission and if they are there side by side with your effort.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the\nbiggest headlines in business.
