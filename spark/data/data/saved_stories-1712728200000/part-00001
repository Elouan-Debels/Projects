Photo: Getty Images /\nPhil Walter\n\nA media commentator warns Wednesday could be one of the worst days for\njournalism in New Zealand's history.\n\nNewshub staff are due to meet at 11am to hear the outcome of Warner Bros\nDiscovery's proposal to axe the newsroom with the possible loss of up to 300\njobs.\n\nDuncan Greive Photo: supplied\n\nSpinoff founder Duncan Greive said he was struggling to think of another day\nwhere there would have been so many job losses in the country's journalism\nindustry.\n\nThe news will come on top of confirmation from TVNZ on Tuesday that it will go\nahead with axeing its consumer affairs programme Fair Go, along with the\nmidday and late night news bulletins. The fate of staff at the current affairs\nprogramme Sunday will also be announced on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the Newshub closure was likely to be confirmed, Greive said it was\n\"reasonably likely\" that one of its rivals, Stuff, NZME or Sky Television,\nwould make a TV bulletin (using Newshub staff) and then sell it back to Warner\nBros Discovery.\n\n\"You'd expect them all to be looking pretty hard at but it will come down to\nprobably who will give the sharpest price.\"\n\nHe did not expect it to to resemble the current Newshub operation and it would\nbe a vastly scaled back service.\n\n\"The current status is uneconomic for Warner Bros Discovery and for anyone to\ntake it over they're going to have to be delivering for a tiny fragment of the\ncurrent cost.\"\n\nThis meant there would be roles for a few presenters, journalists and\ntechnical staff.\n\nHe said the changes being announced would be irreversible even if the\ngovernment and New Zealand on Air came up with some assistance.\n\n\"Any response will come too late for this current round of cuts which is\nreally tragic for the journalists involved and I think that the way that\njournalism impacts the New Zealand public.\n\n\"You don't even have to necessarily consume news to be positively impacted by\nits presence.\"\n\nThe real impact would probably only become obvious after the jobs disappeared.\n\n\"It really is all eyes on [Broadcasting Minister] Melissa Lee\" Spinoff founder\nDuncan Greive duration 5\u2032 :36\u2032\u2032\n\nfrom Morning Report\n\nAdd to playlistPlaylist\n\nDownload\n\n  * Download as Ogg\n  * Download as MP3\n  * Download as AAC\n  * Play Ogg in browser\n  * Play MP3 in browser\n  * Play AAC in browser\n\n\"It really is all eyes on [Broadcasting Minister] Melissa Lee\" Spinoff founder\nDuncan Greive\n\nRegarding the cuts at TVNZ confirmed on Tuesday, he said it was to\nmanagement's credit that they had listened to feedback with the Fair Go brand\nto be retained (and used for online stories) and some changes for the youth\nnews channel Re:News.\n\nWith the announcement on the possible demise of the Sunday current affairs\nprogramme on Wednesday, he expected only about four jobs out of a total of the\noriginal 68 to be saved.\n\n\"The impacts will largely be the same.\"\n\nGreive said the production sector has been calling for a levy for a long time\nto help them and would supplement NZ on Air income.\n\n\"Without some kind of change there is going to be a continued caving-in of the\nsector I think.\n\n\"It really is all eyes on [Broadcasting Minister] Melissa Lee and that Cabinet\npaper she's been referring to.\"\n\n### Some cheer from Fair Go decision\n\nFormer Fair Go presenter on axing of show duration 4\u2032 :54\u2032\u2032\n\nfrom Morning Report\n\nAdd to playlistPlaylist\n\nDownload\n\n  * Download as Ogg\n  * Download as MP3\n  * Download as AAC\n  * Play Ogg in browser\n  * Play MP3 in browser\n  * Play AAC in browser\n\nFormer Fair Go presenter on axing of show\n\nFormer Fair Go presenter Alison Mau says she's hopeful strong consumer affairs\njournalism will continue under a new proposal.\n\nWhile Fair Go on air will cease next month a new team of four journalist roles\ncould be created to continue consumer affairs journalism under the Fair Go\nBrand, particularly on its digital platform.\n\nMau, who was a presenter on the show between 2009 and 2012, said it was not\nonly her favourite show to work on, but it had held a place in New Zealanders'\nhearts for decades.\n\nThe show had been \"a pioneer\" in making some dry topics such as insurance fun\nand palatable for viewers.\n\nAlison Mau Photo: RNZ / Cole Eastham-Farrelly\n\nWhile it was still unclear what TVNZ was planning, she did not expect it to be\na programme that viewers could stream.\n\nIt was more likely it would be longform journalism which would still be useful\nin helping people with their consumer issues.\n\n\"In the end ... it's about the people who write into the show and the fact\nthey might be able to get some meaningful help with their issues.\"\n\nMau said she had experienced five redundancies herself and sent her aroha to\nall those at TVNZ and Newshub who were losing their jobs.\n\n\"It's a really upsetting time. There are a lot of people who are going to have\ntheir hopes dashed today unfortunately and I would just encourage them to not\nlose hope and perhaps to broaden their thinking on what they might do next.\"\n\nTags:\n\n  * employment\n  * media\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Radio New Zealand\n\nView latest newsletter\n\n### Related Stories\n\n  * ### TVNZ to cut Fair Go, midday and late night news bulletins\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\nThe programmes will end in mid-May, TVNZ has confirmed.\n\nTVNZ to cut Fair Go, midday and late night news bulletins\n\n  * ### Is there a rescue in sight for Newshub?\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\nSpeculation is mounting that another media company may step in to save Newshub\n- or at least part of it.\n\nIs there a rescue in sight for Newshub?\n\n  * ### TVNZ staff rally against proposed cuts: 'Implications are very concerning'\n\n28 Mar 2024\n\nSunday, Fair Go, Midday and Tonight are facing cuts along with up to 68 jobs,\nTVNZ announced earlier this month.\n\nTVNZ staff rally outside Auckland headquarters to protest proposed cuts to\njobs and shows\n\n  * ### Newshub closure plan: What's on the chopping block\n\n28 Feb 2024\n\nNewshub's news operations and output, including its website and key\nprogrammes, have been proposed to stop from 30 June.\n\nNewshub closure proposal: What the changes will mean\n\n### New Zealand\n\n  * Live: All Newshub operations to be shut down, 250 jobs to go\n  * Live weather updates: More warnings issued as front creeps north\n  * Wellington workforce reeling from public service job cuts\n  * Head Hunters member pleads guilty to murdering Mongrel Mob member\n  * Fashion designer Kate Sylvester to close the business after three decades\n  * Weather watches and warnings: What they mean and when they're triggered\n\n## Get the RNZ app\n\nfor ad-free news and current affairs\n\n### Top News stories\n\n  * Live: All Newshub operations to be shut down, 250 jobs to go\n  * Live weather updates: More warnings issued as front creeps north\n  * Ministers announce advisory group for fast-tracking projects\n  * NRL: The stats behind the Warriors' three game win streak\n  * Wellington workforce reeling from public service job cuts\n\n### Subscribe\n\nView latest newsletter\n\nNew Zealand RSS\n\nFollow RNZ News\n\n### Join & Follow RNZ\n\n  * RNZ on Facebook\n  * RNZ on Twitter\n  * RNZ on Youtube\n  * RNZ on Instagram\n  * Sign up to RNZ Newsletters\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Radio New Zealand 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
