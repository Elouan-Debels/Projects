DES (year\n1977) is a much older cipher design than AES (2001), and has rightly fallen\ninto disuse in applications because it\u2019s no longer secure against brute force\nattacks. So my spreadsheet here is more for historical interest than for\npractical purposes. (Heaven forbid that you are debugging a 3DES\nimplementation...)\n\nThe input to the spreadsheet is two 16-digit hexadecimal strings (each\nequivalent to 8 bytes), which are the plaintext block and the cipher key. Note\nthat the key effectively has 56 bits of security, because according to the DES\nspecification the least significant bit of each byte is ignored as padding or\nparity. All other parts of the spreadsheet should not be edited by the user.\n\nCompared to AES, the structure of DES uses fewer types of primitive operations\n\u2013 only bit-by-bit permutations/expansions, XOR, and eight 6bit-to-4bit S-boxes\n\u2013 whereas AES uses byte shifting, XOR, one 8bit-to-8bit S-box, and field\nmultiplication. Because of the heavy use of bit permutations, I chose to\nimplement the DES spreadsheet by giving each bit its own cell, instead of\nconstantly assembling and disassembling multi-bit integers (whereas in AES I\nalways handled whole bytes). DES\u2019s key schedule is less regular than AES\u2019s.\nNote that all of the data cells are formatted as text instead of number or\ngeneral, otherwise the whole calculation falls apart. (The data typing in\nExcel can be confusing, and it behaves like a dynamic, weakly typed\nprogramming language.)\n\n## Download\n\nThe DES cipher internals spreadsheet is available in multiple formats, all\nwith the same content and formatting:\n\nMicrosoft Excel binary file format: des-cipher-internals.xls\n\n    \n\nWorks in basically all versions of Microsoft Excel.\n\nMicrosoft Office Open XML Workbook: des-cipher-internals.xlsx\n\n    \n\nPreferred format for Microsoft Excel 2007 and above.\n\nOpenDocument Spreadsheet: des-cipher-internals.ods\n\n    \n\nPreferred format for the open-source office suites LibreOffice and Apache\nOpenOffice.\n\n## More info\n\n  * Wikipedia: Data Encryption Standard\n  * Computer Security Learning Laboratory: Implementation of DES and AES Algorithms using Spreadsheets\n\nCategories: Programming, Cryptography\n\nLast updated: 2014-01-16\n\n## Related / browse\n\n  * AES cipher internals in Excel\n  * Pervasive Displays e-paper panel hardware driver\n  * JSON library (Java)\n  * RollerCoaster Tycoon saved games\n  * Drinking distilled water\n\nFeedback: Question/comment?
