Its whereabouts were unknown to all but a few\nmathematicians until it was rediscovered by George Andrews in 1976, in a box\nof effects of G. N. Watson stored at the Wren Library at Trinity College,\nCambridge. The \"notebook\" is not a book, but consists of loose and unordered\nsheets of paper described as \"more than one hundred pages written on 138 sides\nin Ramanujan's distinctive handwriting. The sheets contained over six hundred\nmathematical formulas listed consecutively without proofs.\"^[1]\n\nGeorge Andrews and Bruce C. Berndt (2005, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2018) have\npublished several books in which they give proofs for Ramanujan's formulas\nincluded in the notebook. Berndt says of the notebook's discovery: \"The\ndiscovery of this 'Lost Notebook' caused roughly as much stir in the\nmathematical world as the discovery of Beethoven\u2019s tenth symphony would cause\nin the musical world.\"^[2]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nAfter Ramanujan died on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32, his wife gave his\nnotebooks to the University of Madras. On August 30, 1923, the registrar\nFrancis Drewsbury sent much of this material to G. H. Hardy, Ramanujan's\nmentor at Trinity College, where he probably received the manuscripts of the\nlost notebook.\n\n> ... Almost surely, this manuscript, or at least most of it, was written\n> during the last year of Ramanujan's life, after his return to India from\n> England. ... The manuscript contains no introduction or covering letter. In\n> fact, there are hardly any words in the manuscript. There are a few marks\n> evidently made by a cataloguer, and there are a few remarks in the\n> handwriting of G. H. Hardy. Undoubtedly, the most famous objects examined in\n> the lost notebook are the mock theta functions ...^[1]\n\nSome time between 1934 and 1947, Hardy probably passed the notebook on to G.\nN. Watson, who with B. M. Wilson started on the project of editing Ramanujan's\nnotebooks. However, Wilson died in 1935 and Watson seems to have lost interest\nin the project in the late 1930s.^[3] After Watson's death in 1965, J. M.\nWhittaker examined Watson's papers (which were a complete mess, due to be\nincinerated in a few days) and found Ramanujan's notebook, which he and R. A.\nRankin sent to Trinity College Wren library on December 26, 1968. George\nAndrews (1986, section 1.5), following a suggestion by Lucy Slater, found the\nlost notebook in the spring of 1976 while on a visit to Trinity College. It\nwas published on December 22, 1987, by Narosa publishing house.\n\n### Andrews' account of the discovery[edit]\n\nGeorge Andrews, an American mathematician, wrote in 2012 an account of the\ndiscovery for the 125th celebration of Ramanujan's birth.^[4] In his account,\nAndrews states that he was already an advanced researcher in fields, such as\nmock theta functions and hypergeometric series, related closely to works of\nRamanujan. In 1970, anticipating a sabbatical, he wrote to British\nmathematician Lucy Slater. Slater \"intriguingly\" stated in her reply that she\nhad inherited a \"great collection\" of papers from mathematicians such as\nWatson, Bailey, Jackson and Rogers, which were unsorted, including one of the\nlast by Ramanujan. She also mentioned other papers were held by the Trinity\nCollege library.\n\nAlthough unable to travel to Europe in 1970, Andrews became able to do so in\n1976, when he was due to attend a European conference in Strasbourg, near the\nFranco-German border. He obtained permission and support from Slater, from the\nTrinity College library, and from his professor, Ben Noble, to visit Cambridge\nafter the conference, in order to investigate the \"invaluable\" unpublished\nwritings of Watson et al. Noble agreed, adding that if he could attempt to\nfind a lost paper by James Clerk Maxwell at the same time, it would be\nappreciated. The library's documents included a list of matters held from\nWatson's estate. The list included the item: \"A 139 page manuscript by S.\nRamanujan on q-series\", containing the work from Ramanujan's final year.\n\nAlthough not labelled as such, the identity of the papers was settled because\nRamanujan's final letters to Hardy had referred to the discovery of what\nRamanujan called mock theta functions, although without great detail, and the\nmanuscript included what appeared to be his full notes on these.\n\n## Contents[edit]\n\nRankin (1989) described the lost notebook in detail. The majority of the\nformulas are about q-series and mock theta functions, about a third are about\nmodular equations and singular moduli, and the remaining formulas are mainly\nabout integrals, Dirichlet series, congruences, and asymptotics. The mock\ntheta functions in the notebook have been found to be useful for calculating\nthe entropy of black holes.^[5]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n  * Alladi, Krishnaswami (17 February 2005), \"Ramanujan's lost notebook: a lecture series in Florida\", The Hindu, archived from the original on March 3, 2007{{citation}}: CS1 maint: unfit URL (link)\n  * Andrews, George E.
