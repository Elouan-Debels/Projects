From short-form social posts\nto feature length films, video gives creatives, brands, and anyone with a\nphone in their pocket the power to connect and engage. Adobe's suite of video\ntools \u2013 Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition - are the industry-\nstandard for creating professional video, and for over a decade, we\u2019ve\ndelivered AI-powered innovation in editing, sound, color and effects.\n\nWe believe generative AI is the next accelerant to human creativity, and\nAdobe\u2019s strategy is to give creative professionals more power and efficiency\nby integrating generative AI across Creative Cloud. The Premiere Pro team has\nbeen deeply engaged with the professional video community over the past year\nto understand how generative AI can solve real problems in their work. Editors\nwant to use generative AI to reduce workflow tedium, streamline tasks, and\nincrease creative control, with three important requirements:\n\n  * AI must be integrated into their workflows, and the tools they use every day like Premiere Pro.\n  * The real value is in editing existing content faster with Generative AI \u2013 adding objects, removing distractions, or extending clips seamlessly on the timeline. All with your content and with your precise control.\n  * The power of choice \u2013 and to be able to use different AI models that are great at different things.\n\nToday, we\u2019re excited to share our vision for bringing generative AI video\nworkflows inside of Adobe Premiere Pro with brand new tools designed to make\nshots a little longer, add new objects or remove unwanted objects, and\ngenerate missing b-roll. By creating interfaces and workflows that unlock the\npower of generative AI, professional editors will be able to do things they\u2019ve\nnever been able to before, without leaving Premiere Pro.\n\n## Adobe Firefly Video Model and third-party generative AI models\n\nOf course, this vision requires advanced video AI models \u2013 and we believe the\nrapid pace of research and innovation in this space will yield professional\nlevel results over the coming year. At Adobe, we are developing a new Firefly\nVideo Model that will join the already released Firefly Image, Vector, Design,\nand Text Effects Models.\n\nPremiere Pro has long had a rich partner and plugin ecosystem, making it the\nflexible, extensible tool that fits any workflow. To expand this ecosystem, we\nare also sharing our early explorations around incorporating third-party\ngenerative AI tools and models with Premiere Pro such as OpenAI\u2019s Sora,\nRunwayML and Pika.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6de4akFiNYM\n\n### Generative Extend\n\nNeed a few more frames? No problem. The Generative Extend tool can be used to\nmake shots a little bit longer by generating entirely new frames at the\nbeginning or end of a clip. Use the extra media to fine tune edits, hold on a\nshot for an extra beat, or add a few frames to cover a transition. Just click\nand drag for the perfect edit.\n\n### Object Addition and Object Removal\n\nNew AI-based smart masking and tracking tools make it easier and faster than\never to select moving objects over time. Combined with the Object Addition and\nObject Removal tools, editors can now replace moving objects in a shot, remove\nunwanted items like boom mics or stray coffee cups, or quickly add set\ndressings such as a painting or a photorealistic flower vase on a desk.\n\n### Generative B-Roll\n\nSpend less time hunting for b-roll shots in stock footage and use simple text\nprompts to generate video clips that are just right for your story. Now you\ncan create a shot that illustrates a difficult-to-shoot or fantastical\nconcept, generate b-roll that\u2019s hard to source, or craft placeholders to\nassist with planning and pacing.\n\n## An open approach to delivering AI models\n\nAs we continue to innovate in the rapidly developing world of Generative AI,\nwe\u2019re committed to open platforms and partnerships to deliver the capabilities\nour customers want where they want them. Through early explorations with\ncompanies like OpenAI and Pika, customers will be able to choose the right\nmodel for their use cases. And we know all models may be trained be\ndifferently, so we are committed to transparency through Content Credentials,\nwhich are like a nutrition label for content creation, to ensure consumers\nwill always know what models were used in the creation of the media they are\nviewing. Content Credentials will be supported inside Premiere Pro, to help\ncreate a chain of trust from creation to editing to publication.\n\nAI has the power to supercharge productivity and lower the barrier to work in\nnew mediums. We believe creativity is a uniquely human trait, so we\u2019re excited\nto continue the dialog we\u2019ve had with the creative community as we enter the\nera of generative AI in Premiere Pro.\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/promotions/firefly\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/04/15/choice-generative-ai-models-\nadvances-firefly\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/01/16/adobe-introduces-major-new-audio-\nupdates-premiere-pro-ahead-2024-sundance-film-festival\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/10/10/premiere-pro-social-video-\nupdates-fall-2023\n\n", "frontpage": false}
