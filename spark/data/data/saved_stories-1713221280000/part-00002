In addition, optimised Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core\nimages will be available for Qualcomm SoCs, enabling enterprises to meet their\nregulatory, compliance and security demands for AI at the edge and the broader\nIoT market with a secure operating system that is supported for 10 years.\n\n## Security-first and AI ready\n\nThe massive growth in AI and edge computing is exciting for device\nmanufacturers. However, it also brings considerable challenges due to\ncybersecurity regulations which place increased security demands on embedded\ndevices. On top of this, devices have to be easy to adopt and use by\ndevelopers, and need to remain performant.\n\nTo help meet these challenges, Qualcomm Technologies chose to partner with\nCanonical to create an optimised Ubuntu for Qualcomm IoT chipsets, giving\ndevelopers an easy path to create safe, compliant, security-focused, and high-\nperforming applications for multiple industries including industrial, robotics\nand edge automation.\n\n\u201cThe combination of Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 processors with the popularity of\nUbuntu among AI and IoT developers is a game changer for the industry,\u201d\ncommented Dev Singh, Vice President, Business Development and Head of\nBuilding, Enterprise & Industrial Automation, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \u201cThe\ncollaboration was a natural fit, with Qualcomm Technologies\u2019s Product\nLongevity program complementing the 10-year enterprise security and support\ncommitments made by Canonical.\u201d\n\n## Ideal to speed up time to market\n\nCanonical and Ubuntu offer Qualcomm Technologies the tools and peace of mind\nto meet new IoT, AI and edge computing market challenges head on.\n\nBy placing Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core at the centre of its devices and products,\nQualcomm Technologies is creating a generation of devices that will be easy\nfor developers to use and adopt.\n\nThe collaboration between Qualcomm Technologies and Canonical will provide\noptions to the industry to accelerate time to market and reduce development\ncosts. Developers and enterprises can benefit from the Ubuntu Certified\nHardware program, which features a growing list of certified ODM boards and\ndevices based on Qualcomm SoCs. These certified devices deliver an optimised\nUbuntu experience out-of-the-box, enabling developers to focus on developing\napplications and bringing products to market.\n\n\u201cCanonical\u2019s partner programs, in conjunction with Canonical\u2019s expertise in\nguiding customers navigate their AI and IoT journey, help set the industry bar\nfor performance with robustness, security and compliance. The work to\nintegrate and optimise Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 software with Ubuntu will enable\nchannel partners and manufacturers to bring Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core platforms\nto a wide range of devices\u201c, said Olivier Philippe, VP for Devices Engineering\nat Canonical.\n\n## Join Canonical and Qualcomm at Embedded World\n\nThe collaboration between Canonical and Qualcomm Technologies kicks off at the\nEmbedded World conference, held at the exhibition centre in Nuremberg,\nGermany, on 9 to 11 April 2024.\n\n  * Visit Canonical booth at [4-354]\n  * Visit Qualcomm booth at [5-161]\n\nTo find out more about Canonical\u2019s partnership and optimised services for IoT,\nedge and AI products, stop by Canonical\u2019s booth , or visit\nhttps://ubuntu.com/internet-of-things\n\n## About Canonical\n\nCanonical, the publisher of Ubuntu, provides open source security, support and\nservices.
