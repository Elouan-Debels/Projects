From\nhelping marketers workshop ideas and creative campaigns, to recommending\ncoding advice to developers, to assisting analysts with market research, the\ntechnology has captivated users with its ability to synthesize information and\ngenerate answers to questions.\n\nBut the arrival of generative AI hasn\u2019t been without its challenges.\n\nThough foundation models that power generative AI develop a vast \u201cworld\nknowledge\u201d during training, they're only as up-to-date as their training data,\nand they can lack access to all the data sources pertinent to enterprise use\ncases. To adopt generative AI at full speed, businesses need to ground\nfoundation model responses in enterprises systems and fresh data, to ensure\nthe most accurate and complete responses.\n\nFor instance, by grounding foundation model responses in ERP systems,\nbusinesses can create AI agents that provide accurate shipping predictions,\nand by grounding in documentation and manuals, they can deliver more helpful\nanswers to product questions and for troubleshooting.\n\nSimilarly, research can be accelerated by grounding in analyst reports and\nstudies, compliance can be strengthened by connecting foundation models to\ncontracts, and employee training and onboarding can be improved by rooting\nagents in internal documents, knowledge bases, and HR systems.\n\nEssentially, the more easily businesses can ground foundation models in their\ndata, the more powerful their use cases can become.\n\nAt Google Cloud, we call this \u201centerprise truth\u201d \u2014 the approach to grounding a\nfoundation model in web information; enterprise data like databases and data\nwarehouses; enterprise applications like ERP, CRM, and HR systems; and other\nsources of relevant information. Grounding in enterprise truth significantly\nimproves the completeness and accuracy of responses, unlocking unique use\ncases across the business and laying the groundwork for the next generation of\nAI agents.\n\nLet\u2019s explore how we do it!\n\n### Grounding generative AI with Google Search and enterprise data\n\nGenerative AI models know the most probable response, which isn\u2019t the same as\nbeing able to cite facts. This is why we\u2019ve built \u2014 and continue to build \u2014 a\nvariety of ways to help ensure each organization is able to ground its\nfoundation models in the truth relevant to its use case.\n\nGoogle Search is one of the world's most trusted sources of factual and up-to-\ndate information. Ground with Google Search expands and enhances the model\u2019s\naccess to fresh, high-quality information, significantly improving the\ncompleteness and accuracy of responses.\n\nToday, we are announcing the preview of Ground with Google Search in Vertex\nAI. Businesses can now augment Gemini models with Google Search grounding, and\ncan easily integrate the enhanced model into their AI agents.\n\nWhen it comes to enterprise data, we offer multiple ways for businesses to\nground model responses in enterprise data sources by leveraging retrieval\naugmented generation, or RAG. RAG helps improve the accuracy of model outputs\nby using vectors and embeddings to gather facts from relevant data sources.\n\nVertex AI includes not only a Google-quality, out-of-box RAG solution, but\nalso a variety of component APIs for building bespoke retrieval, ranking, and\ndocument processing systems that enable enterprises to easily ground\nfoundation models in their own data.\n\nFor organizations that need embeddings-based information retrieval, Vertex AI\noffers powerful vector search capabilities. Today, to enhance vector search,\nwe are excited to announce the preview of our hybrid search feature, which\nintegrates vector-based and keyword-based search techniques to ensure relevant\nand accurate responses for users.\n\nBesides these, customers can connect models to Google databases like AlloyDB\nand BigQuery for the contextual retrieval of operational data and analytics\nlike purchase preferences, rewards, basket analysis, interaction history, and\nmore. To enable actions and transactions, we provide a host of data connectors\nto help businesses connect their models to enterprise applications like\nWorkday, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Hadoop, Confluence, and JIRA to access the\nlatest data on customer interactions and internal knowledge updates like issue\ntracking, program management, and employee records.\n\nWith a comprehensive approach to grounding that covers web search, enterprise\ndata, and third-party enterprise applications, businesses can ensure that\ntheir models will deliver enterprise truth \u2013 wherever it is hosted.\n\n### How more sources of truth create more value\n\nLet\u2019s walk through an example to show how grounding lets organizations\nintegrate sources of enterprise truth and create more helpful AI agents.\n\nSuppose an athletic brand wants to create an AI agent to help customers find\nand purchase shoes.\n\nIf the company just puts an interface atop a foundation model API, they won\u2019t\naccomplish much. The resulting app would be able to discuss shoes generally,\nbased on its training knowledge, but it wouldn\u2019t have particular expertise in\nthe brand\u2019s shoes or any awareness of new footwear trends that emerged after\nits training cutoff date.\n\nWith grounding in Google Search, the shoe brand\u2019s app can become much more\nfunctional, able to search the web for fresh information. However, it wouldn\u2019t\nhave insight into the brand\u2019s internal data such as product information,\ninventory levels, and manufacturing timelines, nor would it be able to call\nfunctions for transactions \u2014 so the shoe company would still be dealing with a\nbasic and rather limited agent.\n\nTo cross this chasm, the company also needs to connect its gen AI models to\nenterprise data sources via RAG mechanisms, so the agent can ground its advice\nin the specificity and factuality of internal documents and databases.\n\nImagine an advanced, proactive version of the shoe-recommending agent, with\naccess to the full spectrum of aforementioned search, databases, and\nanalytics. It would be able to observe patterns like the customer\u2019s last\nseveral purchases all having green stripes. It would remember the earlier chat\nin which the customer said they dislike shoes that squeak on hardwood floors,\nand then go about reviewing customer reviews to purge squeakiness from its\nrecommendations. It would also generate tables on the fly so the customer can\nmore easily compare options, and it would know up-to-date inventory and\nshipping information to help execute transactions. With the right grounding in\nenterprise truth, the sky's the limit \u2014 and so is the value the agent can\ncreate.\n\n### Enterprise truth: fueling gen AI innovation across businesses\n\nGenerative AI adoption isn\u2019t just about access to capable models. It\u2019s also\nabout grounding foundation models in first-party data and high-quality\nexternal sources \u2014 and using these connections to steer model behavior,\ncreating more accurate, relevant, and factual generative AI experiences for\nbusinesses to offer their customers, partners, and employees.\n\nWith access to high-quality and relevant data, models can power experiences\nthat move beyond traditional passive applications, giving rise to the next\ngeneration of AI agents grounded in enterprise truth. That\u2019s the future we are\nrapidly moving towards. Backed by our commitment to this journey with our\ncustomers, we\u2019re excited to help make the outputs of today\u2019s agents factual,\nrelevant, and actionable.\n\nTo learn more about Google Cloud\u2019s AI news at Next, check out our Vertex AI\nAgent Builder announcement.\n\nPosted in\n\n  * AI & Machine Learning\n  * Databases\n  * Data Analytics\n  * Google Cloud Next\n\n##### Related articles\n\nInfrastructure Modernization\n\n### Run AI anywhere with Google Distributed Cloud innovations\n\nBy Vithal Shirodkar \u2022 7-minute read\n\nCompute\n\n### What\u2019s new with Google Cloud\u2019s AI Hypercomputer architecture\n\nBy Mark Lohmeyer \u2022 12-minute read\n\nCompute\n\n### Introducing Google Axion Processors, our new Arm-based CPUs\n\nBy Amin Vahdat \u2022 7-minute read\n\nAI & Machine Learning\n\n### Powering Google Cloud with Gemini\n\nBy Brad Calder \u2022 10-minute read\n\n### Footer Links\n\n#### Follow us\n\n  * Google Cloud\n  * Google Cloud Products\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n  * Cookies management controls\n\n  * Help\n\n", "frontpage": false}
