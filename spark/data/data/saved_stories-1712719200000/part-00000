Part of his job description\nrequires him to run regular maintenance checks, which brings us to Friday, 29,\n2024.\n\n## How did the engineer identify the issue?\n\n(Image credit: Reuters)\n\nWhile running his routine maintenance checks, Freund stumbled on something\nsomewhat off. The software engineer leverages a specific tool called SSH to\naccess computers remotely on the internet. The process is usually smooth and\nseamless, but it was painfully slow on this particular day.\n\nThis slowdown prompted the engineer to investigate the matter, which was\nhighly alarming. He found malicious code buried in a software package dubbed\nXZ Utils. The tool compresses and decompresses data running on the Linux OS.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM windowscentral\n\nAs you might be aware, most internet servers are powered by the Linux\noperating system, which also heavily relies on the XZ Utils software package\n(including the world's biggest companies like banks, hospitals, etc.).\nFreund's investigation into the issue disclosed that the malicious code made\nits way to his device via two recent updates for the XZ Utils.\n\nWhile most software-based tools are susceptible to bugs (especially when new\nupdates are rolled out), Freund says this wasn't a mistake or bug. Instead,\nthe software engineer believes the backdoor was intentionally placed on the\nprogram to cause havoc. As a result, the attacker could access a user's SSH\nconnection and run their code without the unsuspecting user's knowledge.\n\nFreund admitted that he didn't believe his initial findings, but upon running\nmore tests and analysis, the results ultimately cleared the doubt.\nConsequently, he shared his findings with a group of open-source software\ndevelopers to scrutinize the findings and possibly come up with a plausible\nsolution.\n\n## Get the Windows Central Newsletter\n\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nLuckily, the developers were able to come up with a fix for the issues in a\ncouple of hours. Alex Stamos, the chief trust officer at SentinelOne, praised\nFreund for his discovery and swift action while speaking to The New York\nTimes:\n\n\"This could have been the most widespread and effective backdoor ever planted\nin any software product.\"\n\n## Who was behind the sophisticated attack?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nDetails about the hacker behind this attack remain slim, though researchers\nlooking into the issue have spotted subtle changes to XZ Utils from 2022.\nHowever, it's believed that a hacker group used the pseudonym Jia Tan to\ninfiltrate the system.\n\nThe attackers used a sophisticated ploy to slowly gain the trust of\ndevelopers, ultimately allowing them to rise quickly in the ranks, from\nsuggesting program code to becoming maintainers who review and approve the\nsuggested changes.\n\nToday's Best Office 365 Deals\n\nShelly Cashman...Shelly Cashman Series Microsoft Office 365 Office 2016:\nIntroductory, Loose-leaf Version\n\n$20.49\n\nView\n\nat AbeBooks Affiliate Program\n\nMicrosoft Office...Microsoft Office 365 Bible: 10:1 Mastery | Excel in Your Profession, Enhance Time Management, and Foster Exceptional Collaboration [III EDITION] (Career Office Elevator)\n\n$29.95\n\nView\n\nat Amazon\n\nMicrosoft Office...Microsoft Office 365 Ultimate Bootcamp 2023\n\n$34.99\n\nView\n\nat Udemy\n\nMICROSOFT OFFICE...MICROSOFT OFFICE 365 SKU-QQ2-00673 PERSONAL SUBSCRIPTION\nSOFTWARE\n\n$58.99\n\nView\n\nat Walmart\n\nMicrosoft 365...Microsoft 365 Personal 15 Month Auto-Renewal - For Windows,\nmacOS, iOS, and Android devices - 1TB OneDrive cloud storage - Premium Office\nApps - 15-Mo\n\n$69.99\n\nView\n\nat antonline\n\nKevin Okemwa\n\nContributor\n\nKevin Okemwa is a seasoned tech journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya with lots\nof experience covering the latest trends and developments in the industry.\nWith a passion for innovation and a keen eye for detail, he has written for\nleading publications such as OnMSFT, MakeUseOf, and Windows Report, providing\ninsightful analysis and breaking news on everything revolving around the\nMicrosoft ecosystem.
