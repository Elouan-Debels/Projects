Explore Trollfish docs \u00bb\n\n## Overview\n\nTrollfish is a free, entertaining, and unique UCI chess engine derived from\nStockfish. It's been humorously tweaked to prioritize drawing games over\nwinning. When analyzing chess positions, it computes moves that have the best\nchance of leading to a draw, rather than the optimal winning moves. This makes\nfor a novel and amusing chess experience!\n\nLike its predecessor, Trollfish does not include a graphical user interface\n(GUI) that is needed to display a chessboard and to facilitate move inputs.\nThese GUIs are developed independently from Trollfish and can be found online.\nConsult the documentation for your GUI of choice for instructions on how to\nuse Trollfish with it.\n\nBear in mind that Trollfish is intended as a lighthearted joke and is not\ndesigned for serious competitive play. It's perfect for players looking for a\nfun diversion from traditional chess engines.\n\nCheck out the Trollfish documentation for further usage help and enjoy the\nhilarity of striving for a draw with every move!\n\n## Files\n\nThis distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:\n\n  * README.md, the file you are currently reading.\n\n  * Copying.txt, a text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.\n\n  * AUTHORS, a text file with the list of authors for the project.\n\n  * src, a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.\n\n  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.\n\n## The UCI protocol\n\nThe Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard text-based protocol used to\ncommunicate with a chess engine and is the recommended way to do so for\ntypical graphical user interfaces (GUI) or chess tools. Stockfish implements\nthe majority of its options.\n\nDevelopers can see the default values for the UCI options available in\nStockfish by typing ./stockfish uci in a terminal, but most users should\ntypically use a chess GUI to interact with Stockfish.\n\nFor more information on UCI or debug commands, see our documentation.\n\n## Compiling Stockfish\n\nStockfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware instructions,\nbig-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.\n\nOn Unix-like systems, it should be easy to compile Stockfish directly from the\nsource code with the included Makefile in the folder src. In general, it is\nrecommended to run make help to see a list of make targets with corresponding\ndescriptions.\n\n    \n    \n    cd src make -j build ARCH=x86-64-modern\n\nDetailed compilation instructions for all platforms can be found in our\ndocumentation.\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Donating hardware\n\nImproving Stockfish requires a massive amount of testing. You can donate your\nhardware resources by installing the Fishtest Worker and viewing the current\ntests on Fishtest.\n\n### Improving the code\n\nIn the chessprogramming wiki, many techniques used in Stockfish are explained\nwith a lot of background information. The section on Stockfish describes many\nfeatures and techniques used by Stockfish. However, it is generic rather than\nfocused on Stockfish's precise implementation.\n\nThe engine testing is done on Fishtest. If you want to help improve Stockfish,\nplease read this guideline first, where the basics of Stockfish development\nare explained.\n\nDiscussions about Stockfish take place these days mainly in the Stockfish\nDiscord server. This is also the best place to ask questions about the\ncodebase and how to improve it.\n\n## Terms of use\n\nStockfish is free and distributed under the GNU General Public License version\n3 (GPL v3). Essentially, this means you are free to do almost exactly what you\nwant with the program, including distributing it among your friends, making it\navailable for download from your website, selling it (either by itself or as\npart of some bigger software package), or using it as the starting point for a\nsoftware project of your own.\n\nThe only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in some\nway, you MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a\npointer to where the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary\nyou are distributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these\nchanges must also be made available under GPL v3.\n\n## About\n\nthe most powerful chess engine that wants to draw with you\n\nwww.stockfishchess.com/\n\n### Topics\n\nchess-engine chess stockfish lichess-bot stockfish-engine\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nGPL-3.0 license\n\n### Citation\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n3 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * C++ 92.6%\n  * Makefile 4.6%\n  * C 1.8%\n  * Shell 1.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
