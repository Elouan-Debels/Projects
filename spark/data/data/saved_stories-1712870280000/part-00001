Chinese\nphilosopher Mozi was the first person who wrote the principle of camera\nobscura. It is a natural optical phenomenon, where an image on one side of the\nscreen or wall projects through a hole onto a surface opposite the opening. In\nthe late 17th century, a similar technology called pinhole camera was used to\nproject drawings. The only difference between a camera obscura and a pinhole\ncamera is that a camera obscura uses a lens, while a pinhole camera has an\nopen hole.\n\nGerman author Johann Zahn also wrote about the camera obscura, magic lantern,\nand lenses in 1685. And he proposed the first handheld reflex camera. French\ninventor Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce is now widely accepted as the inventor of\nmodern photography. He produced the first photograph in 1816 on a paper coated\nwith silver chloride. Though this photograph no longer exists, a letter from\nhis sister confirmed this claim. Ni\u00e9pce also captures the first surviving\nphotograph in 1827, which is now in the collection of the University of Texas-\nAustin.\n\nThese days, thanks to smart gadgets, almost everyone has a camera with them at\nany given moment. And there are endless possibilities to capture anything from\nany point. The drone cameras made it possible to capture stunning aerial shots\nin high quality, which was only possible with a helicopter back in the day.\nThe use of cameras has allowed us to captivate the moments of our life.\n\nTo celebrate the astonishing history of this invention, we have compiled the\nearliest first photographs from history.\n\n## #1 The world\u2019s first photograph taken by Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce, 1826\n\nCaptured using a technique known as heliography, the shot was taken from an\nupstairs window at Ni\u00e9pce\u2019s estate in Burgundy. As heliography produces one-\nof-a-kind images, there are no duplicates of the piece.\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n## #2 The first photographic portrait image of a human ever produced, 1839\n\nRobert Cornelius\u2019s 1839 image that lays claim to the first self-portrait.\nTaken in Philadelphia, Cornelius sat for a little over one minute before\ncovering the lens.\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n## #3 The first oldest person ever photographed, 1840\n\nBorn 1746, photo from 1840, Hannah Stilley is probably the earliest born\nperson photographed.\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n## #4 First Photograph of a Woman, 1839\n\nNot long after the invention of the daguerreotype, Dr. John W.

The woman was his sister, Dorothy Catherine Draper, and he took this\nimage in 1839 or 1840 in Draper\u2019s studio at New York University.

The photograph was to be of the\nAlton Limited train, an exclusive service that ran between Chicago and St. The\nAlton Limited was commonly referred to as \u201cthe handsomest train in the world\u201d\n. In order to accommodate this larger than life request a very sizable camera\nwas in order. At the time camera technology meant that a large subject would\nrequire a large plate on which to develop the image or else be pieced\ntogether. Lawrence built a large enough camera for this purpose which weighed\nin at 1,400 pounds (with its plate holder loaded) and could accommodate a 8\u2032 \u00d7\n4.5\u2032 plate, big enough to capture the Alton Limited in all its glory at last.\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n## #25 First photograph of Solar Eclipse, 1851\n\nJohann Julius Friedrich Berkowski made the first solar eclipse photograph on\nJuly 28, 1851, using the daguerreotype process.\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n## #26 The First Fatal Airplane Crash Photograph, 1908\n\nThis photo from 1908 showcases the death of Aviator Thomas Selfridge.
