Credit:\nNanyang Technological University\n\nScientists at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have\nsuccessfully grown 'mini kidneys' in the lab and grafted them into live mice,\nrevealing new insights into the metabolic defects and a potential therapy for\npolycystic kidney disease.\n\n\"Mini kidneys,\" or kidney organoids, are kidney-like structures grown in the\nlab using stem cells. In the study led by NTU's Lee Kong Chian School of\nMedicine (LKCMedicine), researchers grew the organoids using skin cells\nderived from patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a prevalent form\nof genetic condition that affects 1 in 1,000 individuals across all\nethnicities.\n\nPeople with PKD often progress to end-stage kidney disease between their 50s\nand 60s, with the standard treatment options available being dialysis or a\nkidney transplant. However, dialysis significantly compromises a patient's\nquality of life, while a transplanted kidney can be challenging to acquire.\nOne other option is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug\nTolvaptan, which is very costly and has severe side effects on the liver.\n\nTo address the need for more effective treatment for PKD patients, the NTU\nresearch team sought to better understand the disease by engrafting their\nnewly developed mini kidneys into mice.\n\nPrevious studies were conducted on mini kidneys grown in a dish, which could\nonly partly mimic the kidney structure and function. The NTU scientists\nengrafted the mini kidneys into live mice to comprehensively replicate the\npathological features of kidney disease, including blood flow, fluid movement\n(tubular fluid) and cellular communication with other organs.\n\nLead investigator Assistant Professor Xia Yun at LKCMedicine said, \"Engrafting\nthe kidney organoid in mice provided us with a physiologically sophisticated\napproach to studying polycystic kidney disease as we were able to successfully\nemulate critical disease characteristics similar to those observed in human\nkidney patients.\"\n\nCritical disease characteristics included abnormalities like the spontaneous\nformation of cysts in the kidneys and the subsequent damage to its tiny tubes.\n\nGraphical abstract. Credit: Cell Stem Cell (2024). DOI:\n10.1016/j.stem.2023.12.003\n\nIn their study, reported in the journal Cell Stem Cell, the NTU research team\nsaid that they believed their engrafted mini kidneys were high quality because\ncysts sustained without extra stress stimulation or chemicals, even after they\nwere removed from the live mice for further investigations in a dish. In\ncontrast, previous kidney organoids grown in a dish cannot form cysts without\nstress stimulation.\n\nCo-investigator Assistant Professor Foo Jia Nee at LKCMedicine said, \"The\nsimilarity between the disease manifestation observed in our engrafted mini\nkidney model and the real-life experiences of polycystic kidney disease\npatients suggest that growing kidney organoids and engrafting them into live\nmice could be beneficial in studying the disease and a useful tool to test new\ntreatments.\"\n\n## Metabolic defects in polycystic kidney disease\n\nScientists have long known that abnormalities in a structure on kidney cells,\nor the primary cilium, cause cysts to form in kidneys. However, tests to\nunderstand the regulatory mechanism and relationship between the primary\ncilium and cell metabolism (autophagy) in live mice with PKD, have not been\npossible until now.\n\nBy studying the development of PKD in live mice and testing cellular pathways,\nresearchers found evidence that boosting autophagy could reduce the severity\nof cysts in the mini kidney.\n\nAfter establishing that boosting autophagy could reduce cysts, the NTU\nscientists shortlisted 22 drugs known for their effects on cell metabolism and\ntested them in the lab. Results showed that minoxidil, a clinical drug widely\nused to cure hypertension and hair loss, effectively reduced cyst formation in\nthe novel mouse model.\n\nAsst Prof Xia Yun said, \"Our study has demonstrated how cysts in polycystic\ndiseased kidneys can be reduced by boosting autophagy, suggesting that this\ncould be a promising treatment for PKD. Moreover, the proven clinical safety\nof minoxidil may allow it to be quickly re-purposed to treat PKD patients in\nclinic. However, more research will be needed to establish this potential.\"\n\nCommenting as an independent expert, Associate Professor Ng Kar Hui, Senior\nConsultant, Division of Paediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Renal\nTransplantation, Department of Paediatrics, Khoo Teck Puat\u2014National University\nChildren's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, said, \"Polycystic\nkidney disease is one of the biggest causes of chronic kidney diseases among\nadults. An effective treatment may potentially ameliorate the rising numbers\nof people with kidney failure in Singapore. The establishment of such models\nin live organisms brings us one step closer to finding more treatment\noptions.\"\n\nIn future studies, the NTU team will test the efficacy of minoxidil and adapt\nthe mini kidney models to investigate other burgeoning kidney diseases without\na strong genetic underpinning, such as diabetic kidney disease.\n\nMore information: Meng Liu et al, Kidney organoid models reveal cilium-\nautophagy metabolic axis as a therapeutic target for PKD both in vitro and in\nvivo, Cell Stem Cell (2024).
