Users who self-\nhost the open source version of TinyMCE are not subject to Usage-Based Billing\nterms, but are required to comply with the open source license terms.  \n---  \n  \n## Definitions\n\nUnderstanding the following terms related to Usage-Based Billing can assist\nyou in making an informed decision when selecting the appropriate pricing plan\nto best suit your needs:\n\n## Tiny Cloud\n\nTiny Cloud is our user-friendly cloud-based editor service that hosts TinyMCE\nin the cloud. It provides access to the premium features of our rich text\neditor. With Tiny Cloud, you can enjoy the benefits of automatic updates,\nensuring your TinyMCE editor is always equipped with the latest features,\nenhancements, and security patches.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to utilize only the free open-source version of\nTinyMCE and your project aligns with our open-source software license, you can\nself-host TinyMCE in the cloud using any CDN service of your choice, bypassing\nthe need for Tiny Cloud. If you want to self-host TinyMCE and still access our\nPremium features like PowerPaste, Accessibility Checker, Templates, AI\nAssistant, and many more, contact our sales team for a quote.\n\n### Editor Load\n\nAn editor load is the event that occurs each time TinyMCE is initialized in\nyour application. The editor dispatches the 'init' event to indicate a\nsuccessful load. For example, if 100 users load TinyMCE 10 times each, the\nresult would be 1,000 editor loads.\n\nLearn more about how we count editor loads.\n\n### How Usage-Based Billing works\n\nUsage-Based Billing means the cost you incur depends on how much you use the\nTinyMCE editor.\n\nEach of our pricing plans includes a specific number of editor loads. If you\nrequire additional editor loads, you have the option to upgrade to a more\nsuitable plan or pay for every block of 1,000 editor loads over your allocated\nplan limit.\n\n### When does my billing month start?\n\nYour billing month starts the day after your trial ends.\n\nFor example, if the last day of your trial is May 15^th, we start counting\nyour monthly editor loads on May 16^th, and then reset that count to 0 every\n16^th day of each subsequent month.\n\nUnused editor loads do not carry over to the next month.  \n---  \n  \n### What happens if I exceed my monthly limit?\n\nIf you exceed your monthly limit, you will automatically be charged $40 USD\nfor every block of 1,000 editor loads over your allocated plan limit.\n\n### What if I\u2019m using the free TinyMCE Core plan?\n\nIf you use our free TinyMCE Core plan without providing a valid payment method\nand exceed your allocated editor loads, your editor will transition to read-\nonly mode until the next month. If you provide a valid payment method, you\nwill automatically be charged $40 USD for every block of 1,000 editor loads\nover our allocated plan limit.\n\n### How can I ensure I don\u2019t go over my monthly limit?\n\nAll Admin users can check their usage data for the past six months in the\nTinyMCE Usage section of the Customer Portal. Usage data for the current\nbilling cycle can be found in the Customer Portal > Settings > Billing Portal.\nWe recommend monitoring your editor loads and choosing a plan that will both\nmeet your needs and minimize your costs. Additionally, we will send an email\nnotification to the address associated with your plan when you reach 70% of\nyour monthly editor loads.\n\nIf your editor loads are consistently exceeding your plan limit, we suggest\nupgrading your plan to minimize costs. You can review the cost of upgrading to\na higher plan at any time and can upgrade in the Billing Portal to immediately\nreceive a higher editor load limit and new capabilities.\n\nWe recommend that the email address associated with your plan is linked to\neither a group alias, IT, or administrator address that will remain valid over\ntime (e.g. http://example.com/. By doing so, you\u2019ll avoid any disruption of\nTinyMCE in your project or application in the event of organizational or staff\nchanges.  \n---  \n  \n### How are editor loads counted during the free 14-day trial period?\n\nDuring the trial, you can enjoy unlimited editor loads.\n\n### I have an annual plan. Are my editor loads calculated monthly or over the\nentire year?\n\nIf you have an annual plan, your editor loads are calculated on a monthly\nbasis within the structure of your annual plan. Similar to our monthly plans,\nyou have a set monthly editor load limit and are automatically charged $40 USD\nper every block of 1,000 editor loads over your allocated plan limit. Learn\nmore about Tiny Cloud\u2019s Usage-Based Billing model.\n\n### If I\u2019m on the Essential plan and reach 5,000 editor loads, will I\nautomatically be upgraded to the Professional plan?\n\nYou will not automatically be upgraded. You will remain on your current plan\nand will automatically be charged $40 USD for each additional block of 1,000\neditor loads over your plan limit. To avoid these charges, we encourage you to\nperiodically review your editor load count to ensure you\u2019re on the most\nappropriate pricing plan. You can always upgrade your plan in our Customer\nPortal > Settings > Billing Portal > Change Plans.\n\nStay Connected\n\nProducts\n\nTinyMCE Drive MoxieManager\n\nPricing\n\nTinyMCE Drive MoxieManager\n\nDevelopers\n\nDocumentation Get Started Integrations API Reference Roadmap Support Blog\nEditor Comparisons Get TinyMCE Free\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Who is Tiny?
