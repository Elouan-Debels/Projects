Much current research focuses on estimating\n> building age from facade images using deep learning. However, building an\n> accurate deep learning model requires a considerable amount of labelled\n> training data, and the trained models often have geographical constraints.\n> Recently, large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4\n> Vision, which demonstrate significant generalisation capabilities, have\n> emerged as potential training-free tools for dealing with specific vision\n> tasks, but their applicability and reliability for building information\n> remain unexplored. In this study, a zero-shot building age classifier for\n> facade images is developed using prompts that include logical instructions.\n> Taking London as a test case, we introduce a new dataset, FI-London,\n> comprising facade images and building age epochs. Although the training-free\n> classifier achieved a modest accuracy of 39.69%, the mean absolute error of\n> 0.85 decades indicates that the model can predict building age epochs\n> successfully albeit with a small bias. The ensuing discussion reveals that\n> the classifier struggles to predict the age of very old buildings and is\n> challenged by fine-grained predictions within 2 decades. Overall, the\n> classifier utilising GPT-4 Vision is capable of predicting the rough age\n> epoch of a building from a single facade image without any training.\n\nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial\nIntelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.09921 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.09921v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.09921arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zichao Zeng [view email] [v1] Mon, 15 Apr 2024 16:47:22 UTC (6,116 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Zero-shot Building Age Classification from\nFacade Image Using GPT-4, by Zichao Zeng and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
