The woman tending bar that evening seemed to know what would\nhappen next.\n\n\u201cThe bartender goes, \u2018Cody, you better not bring in a fucking lion,\u2019\u201d an\neyewitness recalled. \u201cShe knew he was going to bring something in that was not\na dog.\u201d\n\nRoberts didn\u2019t listen. It wasn\u2019t a dog and it wasn\u2019t a lion, but moments later\nhe reappeared with a muzzled, leashed wolf \u2014 an animal that wanted nothing to\ndo with the Green River Bar.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t want to go,\u201d the bar patron recalled. \u201cLike you know when your dog\ndoesn\u2019t want to go to the vet?\u201d\n\nThe 42-year-old resident of the small western Wyoming town of Daniel muscled\nthe animal inside. The gravely injured wild wolf remained in the rowdy tavern\nfor hours thereafter.\n\nThe Green River Bar in Daniel, Wyoming, pictured in April. (Mike Koshmrl,\nWyoFile)\n\n## Videos show the injured, muzzled animal in a bar\n\nWyoming, and the rest of the world, wouldn\u2019t learn of Roberts and the wolf for\na month. Since then, the allegations against Roberts \u2014 that he ran down the\nwolf on a snowmobile, taped the injured animal\u2019s mouth shut and showed it off\nat the bar before killing it \u2014 have become international news. Authorities\nhave released few details about what happened beyond two short videos and a\ncitation that showed he was fined $250 for possessing a live wolf.\n\nThis account of what happened at the Green River Bar on Feb. 29 comes from an\neyewitness to whom WyoFile has granted anonymity. The person, who was at the\nbar that night and later alerted authorities to what had occurred, is being\nleft nameless at their request for their own safety. The worldwide outrage\nover this incidence of animal abuse has generated rampant death threats \u2014 even\ntoward those who had nothing to do with it.\n\nThe eyewitness provided WyoFile with videos from that night which corroborated\ntheir account.\n\nPatrons of the Green River Bar had a mixed response to a wolf in their midst,\nthe eyewitness recalled. About half of the 30 or so people who came and left\nthe watering hole while the wolf was present that evening appeared to be\nfriends and family of Roberts.\n\n\u201cPeople were petting it, taking photos of it, hugging on it,\u201d the person\nrecollected. \u201cI want to be clear: He wasn\u2019t kicking or beating or torturing\nit. The torture was in not putting it down when he ran it over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a jokester about it,\u201d the eyewitness added, \u201cwhile it was just sitting\nthere bleeding to death.\u201d\n\n## Because wolves are managed as predators, they can be killed in any manner\n\nThe eyewitness who described the events of Feb. 29 to WyoFile also reported\nthe incident to the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. In response to the tip,\nState wildlife managers began investigating Roberts on March 1, the day after\nhe brought the animal to the bar. By March 4, Roberts and his attorney met\nwith wardens Adam Hymas and Bubba Haley, during which time he admitted to\npossessing the live wolf at both his home and a private business, according to\nlegal documents WyoFile acquired through the Wyoming Public Records Act.\n\nDuring the night at the Green River Bar, the eyewitness did not hear Roberts\nbrag about how or when he acquired the wolf.\n\nA screenshot taken from video evidence collected by Wyoming Game and Fish\nduring the investigation into Cody Roberts, a Wyoming man who was fined $250\nfor possessing a live wolf. (Wyoming Game and Fish)\n\nBut through subsequent communication with a Game and Fish staffer after the\ntip, the eyewitness was told that Cody Roberts admitted to running it over\nwith a snowmobile. He \u201cinjured it so bad it could barely stay conscious,\u201d one\nstate employee told the eyewitness.\n\nRoberts ran down the wolf in an area where Wyoming manages wolves as a\n\u201cpredator\u201d \u2014 a zone covering 85% of the state in which there are virtually no\nregulations on how wolves can be killed. Bludgeoning wolves with snowmobiles\nhere is legal.\n\n## \u2600\ufe0f READ MORE\n\n### Wolf kills a calf in Colorado, the first confirmed kill after the\npredator\u2019s reintroduction\n\n7:04 PM MDT on Apr 3, 20247:33 AM MDT on Apr 4, 2024\n\n### Colorado wildlife officials are visiting wolf-impacted communities after\nrocky start to reintroduction\n\n4:10 AM MDT on Mar 15, 20241:29 AM MDT on Mar 15, 2024\n\n### Colorado lawmakers intervene for ranchers losing livestock to wolves,\nsaying \u201cchronic depredation\u201d must be defined\n\n3:55 AM MST on Jan 24, 20241:15 PM MST on Jan 24, 2024\n\nWolf biologist Doug Smith, recently retired from a decades-long tenure at\nYellowstone National Park, has reviewed the footage of the wolf in the Green\nRiver Bar. Smith was confident the wolf was a yearling born in 2023, which\nmeans it would have been about 9 months old by late February. The retired\nbiologist had a read on the animal\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s recovering from severe injury, and it\u2019s probably got internal organ\ndamage,\u201d Smith told WyoFile. \u201cThe fact that this wolf should be freaking out \u2014\nand it\u2019s not \u2014 indicates it\u2019s in pain and badly injured.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not always obvious when a wolf is dying from internal injuries, Smith\nsaid.\n\n\u201cHaving necropsied wolves that have been kicked to death by elk,\u201d he said,\n\u201cit\u2019s hard to tell externally that they suffered any damage and trauma.\u201d\n\nRoberts could not be reached for an interview. He declined to speak with Emily\nCohen, the reporter for community radio station KHOL, who first broke the\nstory, and could not be located when a WyoFile reporter tried to interview him\nat his home.\n\n## Upset patrons said nothing, but left the bar\n\nIn the eyewitness\u2019 opinion, Roberts, who runs a trucking company, thought the\nentire episode was hilarious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s literally low-IQ, and just doesn\u2019t get that this shit\u2019s\nnot OK,\u201d the eyewitness said. \u201cHe was drunk and rambling mostly. A guy who\nthinks highly of himself.\u201d\n\nAfter Roberts initially ignored the bar owner, she \u201cdidn\u2019t waste her breath\u201d\nand did not ask the Daniel man to leave or remove the wolf. The eyewitness\ncould tell that the Green River Bar\u2019s owner, who worked solo that night, \u201cwas\nnot OK with it,\u201d but was in a tough spot.\n\n\u201cHis family were half the patrons at the bar that night,\u201d the eyewitness said.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do, kick the whole bar out and close up for the night?\u201d\n\nWyoFile\u2019s attempts to reach the bar owner for an interview were unsuccessful.\n\nA screenshot taken from video evidence collected by Wyoming Game and Fish\nduring the investigation into Cody Roberts, a Wyoming man who was fined $250\nfor possessing a live wolf. (Wyoming Game and Fish)\n\nNobody forcefully told Roberts that he needed to put the animal out of its\nmisery during the hours the eyewitness was present. Some patrons were clearly\nbothered by what was happening, but those folks just removed themselves from\nthe situation and left, the eyewitness said.\n\nRoberts, meanwhile, kept trying to draw attention to his prize.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the night, he was calling it a wolf,\u201d the eyewitness said. \u201cHe\ndefinitely admitted that he put the collars on it.\u201d\n\nIn two short video clips of the wolf taken in Green River Bar released by Game\nand Fish on Wednesday, the prone gray-coated wolf is wearing what appears to\nbe a commercial tracking and shock collar. The eyewitness never saw Roberts\nshock the dying animal.\n\nThe eyewitness left the Green River Bar not knowing what became of the wolf.\nLater, the witness learned from a Game and Fish staffer that the animal was\nkilled.\n\nA WyoFile reporter heard it was shot behind the Green River Bar when he\nvisited the establishment.\n\nRoberts was fined $250 for illegal possession of warm blooded wildlife, but\nthat was the full extent of the penalty administered by the Wyoming Game and\nFish Department. Subsequently, the Sublette County Sheriff\u2019s Office launched\nits own investigation, probing Roberts\u2019 actions for potential animal cruelty\nviolations.\n\nThe eyewitness, who \u201cloves\u201d Sublette County, regrets how the community\u2019s\nreputation has been tarnished because of one man\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t need to happen,\u201d the person told WyoFile. \u201cIt gives it a bad name.\nIt\u2019s a beautiful place, and there\u2019s great people here. We\u2019re not all Cody\nRoberts.\u201d\n\nThe witness to the tormented, gravely injured wolf also hopes that law\nenforcement punishes Roberts much more severely so that he and others learn a\nlesson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been going around town telling people it was worth it,\u201d the eyewitness\nsaid. \u201c$250? That\u2019s a round for the bar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to see a law that is determined enough to keep people from\nkeeping animals alive when they should not be alive anymore,\u201d the witness\nadded.\n\nAllegations that a Wyoming man captured, tortured and killed a wolf have\nsparked outrage across the world and prompted a wave of social media posts.\nOne image published by Cowboy State Daily purports to show the man, Cody\nRoberts, posing for a photograph next to a wolf with its jaws taped shut.\n(Collage by Tennessee Watson, WyoFile)\n\nWyoFile is an independent nonprofit news organization focused on Wyoming\npeople, places and policy.\n\n#### Type of Story: News Service\n\nProduced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic\nstandards.\n\nTagged: animal cruelty, animals, wildlife, wolf, Wyoming\n\n## Mike Koshmrl, WyoFile\n\nmike@wyofile.com\n\nMike Koshmrl reports on Wyoming's wildlife and natural resources.
