It was originally\ndeveloped during the 1980's by the European Association of Aerospace\nIndustries (AECMA), at the request of the European Airline industry, who\nwanted a standardized form of English for technical documentation that could\nbe easily understood by non-English speakers. It has since been adopted in\nmany other fields outside the aerospace, defense, and maintenance domains for\nits clear, consistent, and comprehensive nature. The current edition of the\nSTE Specification, published in April 2021, consists of 53 writing rules and a\ndictionary of approximately 900 approved words.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe first attempts towards controlled English were made as early as the 1930s\nand 1970s with Basic English^[1] and Caterpillar Fundamental English.^[2]^[3]\nIn 1979, aerospace documentation was written in American English (Boeing,\nDouglas, Lockheed, etc.), in British English (Hawker Siddeley, British\nAircraft Corporation, etc.) and by companies whose native language was not\nEnglish (Fokker, Aeritalia, Aerospatiale, and some of the companies that\nformed Airbus at the time).\n\nBecause European airlines needed to translate parts of their maintenance\ndocumentation into other languages for local mechanics, the European Airline\nindustry approached AECMA (the European Association of Aerospace Industries)\nto investigate the possibility of using a controlled or standardized form of\nEnglish. In 1983, after an investigation into the different types of\ncontrolled languages that existed in other industries, AECMA decided to\nproduce its own controlled English. The AIA (Aerospace Industries Association\nof America) was also invited to participate in this project. The result of\nthis collaborative work was the release of the AECMA Document, PSC-85-16598\n(known as the AECMA Simplified English Guide) in 1986. Subsequently, several\nchanges, issues and revisions were released up to the present issue (the\ncurrent Issue 8 of STE is dated April 2021).\n\nAfter the merger of AECMA with two other associations to form the Aerospace,\nSecurity and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) in 2004, the\nspecification was renamed ASD Simplified Technical English, Specification ASD-\nSTE100. ASD-STE100 is maintained by the Simplified Technical English\nMaintenance Group (STEMG), a working group of ASD, formed in 1983; the\ncopyright of ASD-STE100 is fully owned by ASD.^[4] ^[5]\n\nDue to the ever-evolving nature of technology and technical language, the\nSTEMG also relies on user feedback for suggested changes and updates.^[6]\nStarting from Issue 6 in 2013, the Specification became free of charge. Over\nthe years, more than 11,800 official copies of Issues 6 and 7 were\ndistributed. Since Issue 8 was released in April 2021, over 3,200 official\ncopies have been distributed (distribution log updated August 2022). Usually,\na new issue is released every three years.\n\nA free official copy of the ASD-STE100 Specification can be requested through\nthe ASD-STE100 website and through ASD-STAN.\n\n## Benefits[edit]\n\nSimplified Technical English can:\n\n  * provide a single word to replace English words with multiple meanings (e.g., \"includes\" instead of \"comes with\")\n  * improve the clarity of technical writing, especially procedural writing^[7]\n  * improve comprehension for people whose first language is not English\n  * make human translation easier, faster, and more cost-effective\n  * facilitate computer-assisted translation and machine translation\n  * improve reliability concerns of maintenance and assembly by reducing their probability to introduce defects or human-factor risks.\n\nThese claims come mostly from those who have invested in developing,\nimplementing, or supporting STE. To date, there are no published scientific\nstudies to provide evidence about the benefits of STE, suggesting the need for\nmore research.\n\n## Specification structure[edit]\n\nThe ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English specification consists of two\nparts:\n\n  1. The writing rules\n  2. The dictionary\n\n### Writing rules[edit]\n\nThe writing rules differentiate between two types of topics: procedural and\ndescriptive writing. The rules also cover aspects of grammar and style. A non-\nexhaustive list of the writing rules includes the concepts that follow:\n\n  * Use the approved words and only as the part of speech and meaning given in the dictionary.\n  * Make instructions as clear and specific as possible.\n  * Do not write noun clusters that have more than three words.\n  * Use the approved forms of the verb to make only:\n\n    * The infinitive\n    * The imperative\n    * The simple present tense\n    * The simple past tense\n    * The past participle (only as an adjective)\n    * The future tense\n  * Do not use helping verbs to make complex verb structures.\n  * Use the \"-ing\" form of a verb only as a technical name or as a modifier in a technical name.\n  * Do not use passive voice in procedures.\n  * Use the active voice as much as possible in descriptive texts.\n  * Write short sentences: no more than 20 words in instructions (procedures) and 25 words in descriptive texts.\n  * Do not omit parts of the sentence (e.g. verb, subject, article) to make your text shorter.\n  * Use vertical lists for complex text.\n  * Write one instruction per sentence.\n  * Write only one topic per paragraph.\n  * Do not write more than six sentences in each paragraph.\n  * Start safety instructions with a clear command or condition.\n\n### Dictionary[edit]\n\nThe table that follows is an extract from a page of the ASD-STE100 dictionary:\n\nWord(Part of speech)| Approved meaning/ALTERNATIVES| APPROVED EXAMPLE| Not\napproved example  \n---|---|---|---  \nacceptance (n)| ACCEPT (v)| BEFORE YOU ACCEPT THE UNIT, DO THE SPECIFIED TEST\nPROCEDURE.| Before acceptance of unit, do the specified test procedure.  \nACCESS (n)| The ability to go into or near.| GET ACCESS TO THE ACCUMULATOR FOR\nTHE NO. 1 HYDRAULIC SYSTEM.  \naccessible (adj)| ACCESS (n)| TURN THE COVER UNTIL YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THE\nJACKS THAT HAVE \u201c+\u201d AND \u201c-\u201d MARKS.| Rotate the cover until the jacks marked +\nand - are accessible.  \nACCIDENT (n)| An occurrence that causes injury or damage.| MAKE SURE THAT THE\nPINS ARE INSTALLED TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS.  \n  \nExplanation of the four columns:\n\nWord (part of speech) \u2013 This column has information on the word and its part\nof speech. Every approved word in STE is only permitted as a specific part of\nspeech. For example, the word \"test\" is only approved as a noun (the test) but\nnot as a verb (to test). There are few exceptions to the \"One word, one part\nof speech, one meaning\" principle.\n\nApproved meaning/ALTERNATIVES \u2013 This column gives the approved meaning (or\ndefinition) of an approved word in STE. In the example table, \"ACCESS\" and\n\"ACCIDENT\" are approved (they are written in uppercase). The text in these\ndefinitions is not written in STE. If a meaning is not given in the\ndictionary, you cannot use the word in that meaning. Use an alternative word.\nFor words that are not approved (they are written in lowercase, such as\n\"acceptance\" and \"accessible\" in the example table), this column gives\napproved alternatives that you can use to replace the unapproved words. These\nalternatives are in uppercase, and they are only suggestions. It is possible\nthat the suggested alternative for an unapproved word has a different part of\nspeech. Usually, the first suggested alternative has the same part of speech\nas the unapproved word.\n\nAPPROVED EXAMPLE \u2013 This column shows how to use the approved word or how to\nuse the approved alternative (usually a word-for-word replacement). It also\nshows how to keep the same meaning with a different construction. The wording\ngiven in the approved examples is not mandatory. It shows only one method to\nwrite the same information with approved words. You can frequently use\ndifferent constructions with other approved words to say the same thing.\n\nNot approved example \u2013 This column (text in lowercase) shows examples of how\nthe unapproved word is frequently used in standard technical writing. The\nexamples also help you to understand how you can use the approved alternatives\nand/or different constructions to give the same information. For approved\nwords, this column is empty unless there is a help symbol (lightbulb) related\nto other meanings or restrictions.\n\nThe dictionary includes entries of both approved and unapproved words. The\napproved words can only be used according to their specified meaning. For\nexample, the word \"close\" (v) can only be used in one of two meanings:\n\n  1. To move together, or to move to a position that stops or prevents materials from going in or out\n  2. To operate a circuit breaker to make an electrical circuit\n\nThe verb can express to close a door or to close a circuit, but it cannot be\nused with other connotations (e.g., to close a meeting or to close a\nbusiness). The adjective \"close\" appears in the dictionary as an unapproved\nword with the suggested approved alternative \"NEAR.\" Thus, STE does not allow\ndo not go close to the landing gear, but it does allow do not go near the\nlanding gear. In addition to the general STE vocabulary listed in the\ndictionary, Section 1, Words, gives specific guidelines for using technical\nnames and technical verbs that writers need to describe technical information.\nFor example, words, noun clusters, or verbs such as grease, discoloration,\npropeller, aural warning system, overhead panel, to ream, and to drill are not\nlisted in the dictionary, but they qualify as approved terms according to Part\n1, Section 1 (specifically, writing rules 1.5 and 1.12).\n\n## Aerospace and defense standards[edit]\n\n\"Simplified Technical English\" is sometimes used as a generic term for a\ncontrolled language. The aerospace and defense specification started as an\nindustry-regulated writing standard for aerospace maintenance documentation,\nbut it has become a requirement for an increasing number of military land\nvehicles, seacraft, and weapons programs. Although it was not initially\nintended for use as a general writing standard, it has been successfully\nadopted by other industries and for a wide range of document types. The US\ngovernment's Plain English lacks the strict vocabulary restrictions of the\naerospace standard, but represents an attempt at a more general writing\nstandard.^[8]\n\nSince 1986, STE has been a requirement of the ATA Specification i2200\n(formerly ATA100) and ATA104 (Training). STE is also a requirement of the\nS1000D Specification. The European Defence Standards Reference (EDSTAR)\nrecommends STE as one of the best practice standards for writing technical\ndocumentation to be applied for defense contracting by all EDA (European\nDefence Agency) participating member states.\n\nToday, the success of STE is such that other industries use it beyond its\ninitial purpose for maintenance documentation and outside the aerospace and\ndefense domains; as of August 2022, the STE distribution log shows that 56% of\nusers come from outside these two industries. It is successfully applied in\nthe automotive, renewable energies, and offshore logistics sectors, and is\nfurther expanding within medical devices and the pharmaceutical sector. STE\ninterest is also increasing within the academic world, including the\ndisciplines of information engineering, applied linguistics, and computational\nlinguistics).\n\n## Tools[edit]\n\nSeveral outside software products exist to support the application of STE, but\nthe STEMG does not endorse or certify these products.^[9]\n\nBoeing developed the Boeing Simplified English Checker (BSEC). This\nlinguistic-based checker uses a sophisticated 350-rule English parser, which\nis augmented with special functions that check for violations of the\nSimplified Technical English specification.^[10]\n\nHyperSTE is a plugin tool offered by Etteplan to check content for adherence\nto the rules and grammar of the specification.\n\nCongree offers a Simplified Technical English Checker based on linguistic\nalgorithms. It supports all rules of Simplified Technical English issue 7 that\nare relevant to the text composition and provides an integrated Simplified\nTechnical English dictionary.^[11]\n\nThe TechScribe term checker for ASD-STE100 helps writers to find text that\ndoes not conform to ASD-STE100.^[12]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Language portal\n  * Constructed languages portal\n\n  * Basic English\n  * Constructed language\n  * International English\n  * Special English\n  * Attempto Controlled English\n  * Topic-based authoring\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Ogden, Charles Kay (1932).
