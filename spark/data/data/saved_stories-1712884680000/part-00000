We don't seem to doing much of that\nanymore.\n\nI'm getting older, I'm definitely getting older (everyone is), but I remember\nwhen we made things that users wanted. We don't seem to doing much of that\nanymore.\n\nBuild a product, hope it provides value enough for a user to pay for it, earn\na profit. You'd succeed by providing value. Now, we extract value.\n\nWe enter the market with free, chase unrealistic scale, trap users and, maybe,\nexit. We pull value up the stack and leave just enough at the bottom.\n\nWe co-opt and commercialize social interaction \u2014 who cares if it makes it\nhealthier improves it? Do just enough to stay out of trouble.\n\nWe destroy the institution and practice of journalism, get bored and leave\nwreckage. We disrupt traditional industries, increase the precariousness of\nemployment, strip benefits and then raise prices \u2014 but hey, you've got a new\napp, right?\n\nWe treat attention as though it's an inexhaustible input to be mined through\n(it's not). We do the same thing with everything, written, posted, produced\nand placed on the internet.\n\nWe start out building valuable devices, move into services, capture users and\nstep on developers.\n\nWe spin up streaming media, drop prices, increase availability, wait for\ncollections to whither and then safely hollow out libraries, squeeze creators\nand raise prices.\n\nI wish we were more focused on the ever increasing number of people harmed by\nall of this, the number of people who are checked out, getting squeezed or\nleft behind by vague promises that never materialize and quickly forgotten.\n\nI wish we could get back to providing value to users.
