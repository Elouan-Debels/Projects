This reflects the fact\nthat bringing charges and getting convictions is hard, with complex cases\noften crossing borders.\n\nAre many countries too soft when it comes to sentencing in such cases?\nFascinating new research, drawing on the case of Finland, concludes yes.\n\nThe authors note that culprits of financial crimes are less likely to go to\nprison compared with other non-violent crimes (despite the fact that fraud\ncosts about 1.5% of GDP). Only 11% of defendants are imprisoned, half or a\nthird of the rates for non-violent drug or property crime respectively.\n\nOne reason could be that people committing these crimes tend to be more\nprivileged than your average criminal \u2013 they\u2019re richer, older and better\neducated. We call financial crime white-collar crime for a reason.\n\nThe shows that prison sentences for financial crimes work. They reduce\nreoffending by nearly 50% in the three years after sentencing \u2013 a big deal\ngiven that reoffending rates are high. And they have a wider deterrent effect:\nprison sentences reduce the probability that a fraudster\u2019s colleagues will\ncommit financial crimes. When it comes to tackling tackling fraud, perhaps\ndeterrence is our best form of attack.\n\nTorsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.
