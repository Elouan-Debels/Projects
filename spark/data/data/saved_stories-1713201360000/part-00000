against\n\u201cwokeness\u201d and obsessed with making humanity a multi-planetary species.\n\nThe other is an iconoclastic Latin American leader and self-declared anarcho-\ncapitalist, prone to cloning his dead dogs and obsessed with destroying state\ncontrols.\n\nTech executive Elon Musk and Argentine President Javier Milei finally sealed\ntheir budding bromance Friday at a Tesla electric car factory in Texas \u2014 their\nfirst meeting after months of mutual admiration on social media.\n\nIt was a match made in free-market heaven.\n\nIn social media posts that thrilled their right-wing fans, the pair played up\ntheir real-life friendship.\n\n\u201cTo an exciting & inspiring future!\u201d Musk wrote on X, or Twitter as it was\nknown before he bought it in 2022, along with a photo of him and Milei both\ngrinning widely and giving the camera two thumbs up, the libertarian\npresident\u2019s trademark gesture.\n\n\u201cLong live freedom, dammit!\u201d Milei wrote in his own X post, which included a\nselfie of the pair, with the president sporting his signature leather bomber\nand Musk in his Air Force Academy navy sports jacket.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPope Francis sides

council in Haiti to choose new leaders is formally established\namid gang violence\n\nThe meeting was closed to the press and a statement from Milei\u2019s office\nproduced little news, saying the free-market enthusiasts discussed issues,\nranging from the expected (how to promote entrepreneurship by slashing red-\ntape) to the random (the existential danger posed by declining birth rates).\n\nMilei\u2019s office said that the president offered to help Musk in the clash\nbetween social media company X and Brazilian authorities, which have accused\nMusk of obstruction for defying a judge\u2019s order to block some accounts.\n\nThe two also agreed to host \u201ca big event soon in Argentina to promote the\nideas of freedom,\u201d the Argentine presidency said, but provided no further\ndetails.\n\nBut behind the smiley photo-op \u2014 and video of Milei\u2019s joy ride in a futuristic\nCybertruck pickup \u2014 much was at stake for Argentina.\n\nSupport from the U.S. \u2014 particularly at the International Monetary Fund, to\nwhich Argentina owes over $42 billion \u2014 is critical to boosting investor\nconfidence in the South American country, as Milei seeks to overhaul a broken\neconomy with market-oriented policies.\n\nWith the revival of socialist governments across Latin America, from Chile to\nBrazil, experts say Argentina is now poised to emerge as a key strategic\npartner for Washington.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that Argentina can fill this vacuum and eventually be a\nstrategic partner for the U.S.,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, who runs a political\nconsultancy in Buenos Aires. \u201cMusk can serve to speed this process of\nArgentina becoming part of the (U.S.) new network of friends.\u201d\n\nLast month, Musk\u2019s company delivered Starlink satellite internet service to\nArgentina, a move cheered by farmers struggling to keep up with high-tech\nagriculture in remote parts of the country.\n\nGerardo Werthein, Argentina\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., attended Friday\u2019s\nmeeting and told La Naci\u00f3n newspaper that Milei and Musk discussed Argentina\u2019s\nvast reserves of strategic minerals, including lithium, an indispensable\ningredient in batteries for electric cars.\n\n\u201cHe expressed wanting to help Argentina, and had a very good view of\neverything we have, mainly lithium,\u201d Werthein said of Musk.\n\nMilei\u2019s love for free markets and close alignment with U.S. policy \u2014 a major\nshift after years of left-wing governments that adopted interventionist\npolicies and strained relations with Washington \u2014 has raised hopes in the U.S.\nthat lithium and other badly needed metals can be extracted closer to home,\nbreaking China\u2019s dominance of the battery supply chain.\n\nAnalysts say that a successful energy transition in the U.S. will demand far\nmore lithium and other essential commodities than the country is now on track\nto produce.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to localize our supply chain to the greatest extent so\nyou\u2019re not transporting materials all the way around the world,\u201d said Ben\nSteinberg, a former Department of Energy senior adviser and current executive\nvice president at government affairs firm Venn Strategies. \u201cThe U.S. has a lot\nof interest in working domestically and with South American countries like\nArgentina.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nSearch
