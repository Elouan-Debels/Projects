I really wish they\u2019d read Baldur\u2019s excellent\nexplainer first.\n\nJohn has been doing his predicatable \u201cleave Britney alone!\u201d schtick with\nregards to Apple (and in this case, Google and Facebook too). Ian Betteridge\ndoes an excellent job of setting him straight:\n\n> A lot of commentators seem to have the same issue as John: that it\u2019s weird\n> that a governmental body can or should define how products should be\n> designed.\n>\n> But governments mandate how products are designed all the time, and not just\n> in the EU. Take another market which is pretty big: cars. All cars have to\n> feature safety equipment, which varies from region to region but will\n> broadly include everything from seatbelts to crumple zones. Cars have rules\n> for emissions, for fuel efficiency, all of which are designing how a car\n> should work.\n\nBut there\u2019s one assumption in John\u2019s post that Ian didn\u2019t push back on. John\nsaid:\n\n> It\u2019s certainly possible that Meta can devise ways to serve non-personalized\n> contextual ads that generate sufficient revenue per user.\n\nThat comes with a footnote:\n\n> One obvious solution would be to show more ads \u2014 a lot more ads \u2014 to make up\n> for the difference in revenue. So if contextual ads generate, say, one-tenth\n> the revenue of targeted ads, Meta could show 10 times as many ads to users\n> who opt out of targeting. I don\u2019t think 10\u00d7 is an outlandish multiplier\n> there \u2014 given how remarkably profitable Meta\u2019s advertising business is, it\n> might even need to be higher than that.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like an article of faith that behavioural advertising is more\neffective than contextual advertising. But there\u2019s no data to support this.\nQuite the opposite. I wrote about this four years ago.\n\nOnce again, I urge you to read the excellent analysis by Jesse Frederik and\nMaurits Martijn.\n\nThere\u2019s also Tim Hwang\u2019s book, Subprime Attention Crisis:\n\n> From the unreliability of advertising numbers and the unregulated automation\n> of advertising bidding wars, to the simple fact that online ads mostly fail\n> to work, Hwang demonstrates that while consumers\u2019 attention has never been\n> more prized, the true value of that attention itself\u2014much like subprime\n> mortgages\u2014is wildly misrepresented.\n\nMore recently Dave Karpf said what we\u2019re all thinking:\n\n> The thing I want to stress about microtargeted ads is that the current\n> version is perpetually trash, and we\u2019re always just a few years away from\n> the bugs getting worked out.\n\nThe EFF are calling for a ban. Should that happen, the sky would not fall.\nContrary to what John thinks, revenue would not plummet. Contextual\nadvertising works just fine ...without the need for invasive surveillance and\ntracking.\n\nLike I said:\n\n> Tracker-driven behavioural advertising is bad for users. The advertisements\n> are irrelevant most of the time, and on the few occasions where the\n> advertising hits the mark, it just feels creepy.\n>\n> Tracker-driven behavioural advertising is bad for advertisers. They spend\n> their hard-earned money on invasive ad tech that results in no more sales or\n> brand recognition than if they had relied on good ol\u2019 contextual\n> advertising.\n>\n> Tracker-driven behavioural advertising is very bad for the web. Megabytes of\n> third-party JavaScript are injected at exactly the wrong moment to make for\n> the worst possible performance. And if that doesn\u2019t ruin the user experience\n> enough, there are still invasive overlays and consent forms to click through\n> (which, ironically, gets people mad at the legislation\u2014like GDPR\u2014instead of\n> the underlying reason for these annoying overlays: unnecessary surveillance\n> and tracking by the site you\u2019re visiting).\n\n1:53pm\n\nTagged with advertising behavioral contextual revenue eu europe dma targetting\nsurveillance tracking apple facebook google meta revenue business ads\n\nOlder \u00bb\n\n## Responses\n\n## Related posts\n\n### Get the FLoC out\n\nGoogle Chrome is prioritising third parties over end users.\n\nWednesday, April 21st, 2021 3:26pm\n\nTagged with floc google chrome surveillance tracking browsers advertising\nprivacy users priorities standards fingerprinting\n\n### Heisenberg\n\nJavaScript and the observer effect.\n\nFriday, January 19th, 2018 11:30am\n\nTagged with google analytics javascript performance frontend development\ntracking advertising thirdparty scripts speed surveillance\n\n### On The Verge\n\nVerging on the ridiculous.\n\nMonday, July 27th, 2015 1:08pm\n\nTagged with verge vox performance advertising javascript bloat tracking ads\nbusiness frontend development speed browsers popups trackers\n\n### Rotten Apple\n\nApple are planning to kill mobile web apps.
