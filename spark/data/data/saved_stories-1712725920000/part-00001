This precession damped on a\ntimescale of a few months challenging some models used to explain the origin\nof the mysterious repeating fast radio bursts.\n\nThe results are published in this week\u2019s issue of Nature Astronomy.\n\nFig. 1: Artistic rendering of a precessing magnetar with a twisted magnetic\nfield and its radio beam pointing towards Earth.\n\n\u00a9 Gregory Desvignes / MPIfR\n\nFig. 1: Artistic rendering of a precessing magnetar with a twisted magnetic\nfield and its radio beam pointing towards Earth.\n\n\u00a9 Gregory Desvignes / MPIfR\n\nMagnetars are neutron stars with extreme and twisted magnetic fields, remnants\nafter the collapse of fuel-exhausted massive stars. These objects are so dense\nthat they contain 1 to 2 times the mass of the Sun in a near-perfect sphere of\nabout 12 km in radius. Of the 30 known magnetars, only a handful have\noccasionally emitted radio waves, with their radio beam sweeping the sky like\na lighthouse. Magnetars are widely considered to be the source for the Fast\nRadio Bursts (FRBs) with some models invoking freely precessing magnetars as\nresponsible for the repeating FRBs.\n\nTogether with colleagues from the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics and the\nKavli Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics, researchers from the Max Planck\nInstitute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR) are regularly inspecting some of these\nmagnetars and unexpectedly caught one of them, XTE J1810-197, which started to\nemit radio emission in December 2018, shortly after the start of enhanced\nX-ray emission, and after a period of about ten years during which it was\nradio quiet.\n\nEmbarking on an intense observing campaign following this event, the\nresearchers noticed some very systematic changes in the properties of the\nradio light, namely its polarisation, revealing a shift in the orientation of\nthe magnetar\u2019s radio beam with respect to Earth. The researchers attributed\nthis to free precession, an effect that arises from a slight asymmetry in the\nmagnetar\u2019s structure, causing it to wobble around like a spinning top. To\ntheir surprise, the free precession damped rapidly over the next few months\nand disappeared eventually. The disappearance of the precession with time\ncontradicts that the suggestion by many astronomers who believe that FRBs,\nthat repeat with time, can be explained by precessing magnetars.\n\n\u201cWe expected to see some variations in the polarisation of this magnetar\u2019s\nemission, as we knew this from other magnetars,\u201d remembers Gregory Desvignes\nfrom the MPIfR, leading author of the study. \u201cBut we did not expect that these\nvariations are so systematic, following exactly the behaviour that would be\ncaused by the wobbling of the star.\u201d\n\nPatrick Weltevrede from The University of Manchester adds: \u201cOur findings were\nonly made possible thanks to many years of dedicated monitoring of this\nmagnetar with radio telescopes in Jodrell Bank and Effelsberg. We had to wait\nfor over a decade before it started to produce radio emission, but when it\ndid, it certainly didn't disappoint.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamped precession of magnetars might shed light on the inner structure of\nneutron stars, which is ultimately related to our fundamental understanding of\nmatters,\u201d says Lijing Shao from Peking University.\n\n\u201cRadio astronomy is truly fascinating! The enigma surrounding the origins of\nFRBs still persists. However, catching intriguing objects like magnetars in\nthe act to learn more about FRBs, underscores the capabilities of our\nfacilities,\" concludes Michael Kramer, director at MPIfR and Head of it\u2019s\nFundamental Physics in Radio Astronomy Research Division.\n\nFig. 2: The two radio telescopes used for this study: the Effelsberg 100-m\ntelescope (left) and the Lovell 76-m telescope (right).\n\n\u00a9 Norbert Junkes (Radioteleskop Effelsberg); Mike Peel (Lovell Telescope).\n\nFig. 2: The two radio telescopes used for this study: the Effelsberg 100-m\ntelescope (left) and the Lovell 76-m telescope (right).\n\n\u00a9 Norbert Junkes (Radioteleskop Effelsberg); Mike Peel (Lovell Telescope).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBackground Information:\n\nAuthors of the original paper in Nature Astronomy are Gregory Desvignes,\nPatrick Weltevrede, Yong Gao, Ian Jones, Michael Kramer, Manisha Caleb, Rames\nKaruppusamy, Lina Levin, Kuo Liu, Andrew Lyne, Lijing Shao and Ben Stappers.\nAuthors from MPIfR include Gregory Desvignes, the first author, and also\nMichael Kramer, Ramesh Karuppusamy and Kuo Liu.\n\nContact\n\n#### Dr. Gregory Desvignes\n\n+49 228 525-314 gdesvignes@...\n\nMax-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie, Bonn\n\n#### Prof. Dr. Michael Kramer\n\nDirector and Head of \"Fundamental Physics in Radio Astronomy\" Research\nDepartment +49 228 525-299 mkramer@...\n\nMax Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, Bonn\n\n#### Dr. Norbert Junkes\n\nPress and Public Outreach +49 228 525-399 njunkes@...\n\nMax Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, Bonn\n\nOriginal Paper\n\n#### A freely precessing magnetar following an X-ray outburst\n\nGregory Desvignes et al., in: Nature Astronomy, April 08, 2024\n\nVideo\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:42\n\nLoaded: 0%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:42\n\n1x\n\n  * Chapters\n\n  * descriptions off, selected\n\n  * captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n  * captions off, selected\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.
