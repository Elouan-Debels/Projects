Call it puritanical or\nridiculous, but in breeding, it\u2019s been a long-standing practice\u2014even though\nthere has never been much science to back it up. Now, however, researchers at\nUniversity of New South Wales in Australia believe they may finally have some\nevidence to give that notion some scientific support.\n\nWorking with flies, Angela Crean, a research fellow at the evolution and\necology research center, picked up on her mentor\u2019s work of looking at how male\nfactors can influence offspring outside of the DNA in his semen.\n\n\u201cThe genetic tests showed that even though the second male fertilized the\neggs, the offsprings\u2019 size was determine by the condition of the first male,\u201d\nshe says of her findings, published in the journal Ecology Letters. \u201cThe cool\nthing is that the non-genetic effects we are seeing are not necessarily tied\nto the fertilization itself.\u201d\n\nCool, or really disturbing. The implications of the study are that any mates a\nfemale has had may leave some legacy\u2014in the form of physical or other traits\nthat are carried in the semen (but not the DNA-containing sperm)\u2014that could\nshow up in her future offspring with another mate.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a growing body of work showing that a mother\u2019s diet, her smoking\nstatus, and other lifestyle habits can have an influence on her offspring, the\ndata on similar factors on the father\u2019s side is just emerging. With flies it\u2019s\nknown, for example, that males who eat a maggot-rich diet while they\u2019re mere\nlarvae, develop into larger than average adults, and on top of that, sire\nlarger than average offspring as well. Males fed a meager maggot diet tend to\nbe smaller have have smaller progeny.\n\nEager to learn how this was happening, Crean conducted a series of mating\nexperiments with female flies when their eggs were immature. At that stage,\nthe eggs are more receptive to absorbing factors in semen, but because they\naren\u2019t fully developed, they can\u2019t be fertilized and won\u2019t result in baby\nflies. When she and her colleagues \u201cmated\u201d these females with males who were\nlarger, then allowed the females to actually mate with smaller males once they\nwere mature, the offspring turned out to be large, just like the first males\nthe females had sexual contact with. Genetically, they were the offspring of\nthe second, smaller male, but physically, they resembled the larger males.\n\nThe same was true when they reversed the experiment and first exposed the\nfemales to smaller flies and then mated them with the larger ones.\n\nTo be sure that the was indeed due to something in the semen, Crean repeated\nthe studies with an unfortunate group of male flies who had their genitalia\nglued down so they could not pass on any semen during their encounters. (\u201cIt\u2019s\nhorrifying but seemed nicer than cutting them off,\u201d she says.) When these\nmales, both large and small, were the first \u201cmates\u201d for females, their size\ndid not have an effect on the offspring when the female mated with her second\nmate and had offspring. In other words, those offspring were large if the\nsecond male was large, and small if the second male was small.\n\nCrean says the idea of a female\u2019s previous mates having an effect on their\noffspring isn\u2019t unheard of. In fact, this very idea, called telegony, was\nproposed by ancient scholars such as Aristotle but dismissed with the advent\nof genetics. But new findings about epigenetics \u2014 how our behaviors, such as\ndiet, smoking and drinking \u2014 can affect our genes and how those changes can be\npassed on, make the idea of such non-genetic inheritance possible. \u201cThis could\nbe seen as a maternal effect [such as diet or smoking] where the mother\u2019s\nenvironment are her previous mating partners,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to realize\nthat it\u2019s not just DNA that gets passed on. It opens up the opportunity for\nall these other pathways that we had excluded.\u201d\n\nAnd while flies aren\u2019t people, what are the chances that the same phenomenon\nis occurring in human reproduction? \u201cIt\u2019s something we definitely don\u2019t want\nto speculate about yet with humans,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no direct scientific\nevidence for that at all.\u201d At least, for now.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * Dua Lipa Manifested All of This\n  * Exclusive: Google Workers Revolt Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n  * Stop Looking for Your Forever Home\n  * The Sympathizer Counters 50 Years of Hollywood Vietnam War Narratives\n  * The Bliss of Seeing the Eclipse From Cleveland\n  * Hormonal Birth Control Doesn\u2019t Deserve Its Bad Reputation\n  * The Best TV Shows to Watch on Peacock\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
