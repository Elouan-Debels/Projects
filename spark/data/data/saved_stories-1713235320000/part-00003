(Getty Images photo)\n\n## Rochester researchers harnessed adaptive optics to gain insight into the\ncomplex workings of the retina and its role in processing color.\n\nScientists have long wondered how the eye\u2019s three cone photoreceptor types\nwork together to allow humans to perceive color. In a new study in the Journal\nof Neuroscience, researchers at the University of Rochester used adaptive\noptics to identify rare retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that could help fill in\nthe gaps in existing theories of color perception.\n\nThe retina has three types of cones to detect color that are sensitive to\neither short, medium, or long wavelengths of light. Retinal ganglion cells\ntransmit input from these cones to the central nervous system.\n\nIn the 1980s, David Williams, the William G. Allyn Professor of Medical\nOptics, helped map the \u201ccardinal directions\u201d that explain color detection.\nHowever, there are differences in the way the eye detects color and how color\nappears to humans. Scientists suspected that while most RGCs follow the\ncardinal directions, they may work in tandem with small numbers of non-\ncardinal RGCs to create more complex perceptions.\n\nRecently, a team of researchers from Rochester\u2019s Center for Visual Science,\nthe Institute of Optics, and the Flaum Eye Institute identified some of these\nelusive non-cardinal RGCs in the fovea that could explain how humans see red,\ngreen, blue, and yellow.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know anything for certain yet about these cells other than\nthat they exist,\u201d says Sara Patterson, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center\nfor Visual Science who led the study. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more that we have to\nlearn about how their response properties operate, but they\u2019re a compelling\noption as a missing link in how our retina processes color.\u201d\n\n### Using adaptive optics to overcome light distortion in the eye\n\nThe team leveraged adaptive optics, which uses a deformable mirror to overcome\nlight distortion and was first developed by astronomers to reduce image blur\nin ground-based telescopes. In the 1990s, Williams and his colleagues began\napplying adaptive optics to study the human eye. They created a camera that\ncompensated for distortions caused by the eye\u2019s natural aberrations, producing\na clear image of individual photoreceptor cells.\n\n\u201cThe optics of the eye\u2019s lens are imperfect and really reduce the amount of\nresolution you can get with an ophthalmoscope,\u201d says Patterson. \u201cAdaptive\noptics detects and corrects for these aberrations and gives us a crystal-clear\nlook into the eye. This gives us unprecedented access to the retinal ganglion\ncells, which are the sole source of visual information to the brain.\u201d\n\nPatterson says improving our understanding of the retina\u2019s complex processes\ncould ultimately help lead to better methods for restoring vision for people\nwho have lost it.\n\n\u201cHumans have more than 20 ganglion cells and our models of human vision are\nonly based on three,\u201d says Patterson. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on in the retina\nthat we don\u2019t know about. This is one of the rare areas where engineering has\ntotally outpaced visual basic science. People are out there with retinal\nprosthetics in their eyes right now, but if we knew what all those cells do,\nwe could actually have retinal prosthetics drive ganglion cells in accordance\nwith their actual functional roles.\u201d\n\nThe work was supported through funding by the National Institutes of Health,\nAir Force Office of Scientific Research, and Research to Prevent Blindness.\n\n## More in Science & Technology\n\nBrief period of \u2018blindness\u2019 is essential for vision\n\nAI helps bring clarity to LASIK patients facing cataract surgery\n\nFirst-ever lab model of human eye offers hope for macular degeneration\npatients\n\nView all related items\n\nReturn to the top of the page\n\nBoundless Possibility\n\nExplore our 2030 Strategic Plan\n\nSee maps and directions Rochester, NY 14627\n\n\u00a9 University of Rochester 1996-2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
