But it would be almost 50 years before the particle's existence could\nbe confirmed at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nHiggs' theory related to how subatomic particles that are the building blocks\nof matter get their mass. This theoretical understanding is a central part of\nthe so-called Standard Model, which describes the physics of how the world is\nconstructed.\n\nRelated Story: The Large Hadron Collider will embark on a third run to uncover\nmore cosmic secrets\n\nEdinburgh University said his groundbreaking 1964 paper demonstrated how\n\"elemental particles achieved mass through the existence of a new sub-atomic\nparticle\u2032\u2032 which became known as the Higgs boson.\n\nIn 2012, in one of the biggest breakthroughs in physics in decades, scientists\nat CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, announced that they\nhad finally found a Higgs boson using the $10 billion particle collider built\nin a 17-mile (27-kilometer) tunnel under the Swiss-French border.\n\nHiggs won the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work, alongside Francois\nEnglert of Belgium, who independently came up with the same theory.\n\nEdinburgh University Vice Chancellor Peter Mathieson said Higgs, who was born\nin Newcastle, was \"a remarkable individual \u2013 a truly gifted scientist whose\nvision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds\nus.\"\n\nRelated Story: At CERN, Hunting For Invisible Worlds\n\n\"His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy\nwill continue to inspire many more for generations to come.\"\n\nHiggs' work helps solve one of the most fundamental riddles of the universe:\nhow the Big Bang created something out of nothing 13.7 billion years ago.\n\nFinding corroboration wasn't easy. It took more than two decades, thousands of\nscientists and mountains of data from trillions of colliding protons.\n\nAnd it needed the world's biggest atom smasher CERN's Large Hadron Collider to\nproduce the extreme surge of energies simulating those 1 trillionth to 2\ntrillionths of a second after the Big Bang.\n\nRelated Story: Weasel Apparently Shuts Down World's Most Powerful Particle\nCollider\n\nOne highlight of Higgs' illustrious career came during the 2013 presentation\nat CERN in Geneva where scientists presented in complex terms \u2014 unfathomable\nto most laypeople and based on statistical analysis \u2014 that the boson has been\nconfirmed. He broke into tears, wiping down his glasses in the stands of the\nlecture hall.\n\nBorn in Newcastle, northeast England on May 29, 1929, Higgs studied at King's\nCollege, University of London, and was awarded a PhD in 1954. He spent much of\nhis career at Edinburgh, becoming the Personal Chair of Theoretical Physics at\nthe Scottish university in 1980. He retired in 1996.\n\nHiggs received honorary degrees from more than a dozen universities, including\nEdinburgh (1998), Swansea (2008) Cambridge (2012), St Andrews and Manchester\n(2013).\n\nIn 2013 he was appointed a Companion of Honor by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
