Is this something that can be changed within\nWindows?\n\nI never experienced such issues on old hardware within Windows 7 and I've\nremoted into my old Windows 7 machine without a monitor many times in the\npast. This leads me to believe it's an issue within Windows 10 or modern\nhardware.\n\nI've disable ULPS within the registry and I'm positive I've disabled every\npower saving setting within the BIOS.\n\nI've seen comments on another website that suggest the use of a dummy HDMI\nplug or virtual display drivers, but again I'd rather an actual solution\nrather than an emulation workaround.\n\n  * CPU: Ryzen 5 5600X\n  * GPU: 6900 XT\n\n  * windows-10\n  * remote-desktop\n  * hdmi\n  * displayport\n  * chrome-remote-desktop\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited 5 hours ago\n\nRun5k\n\n16k2424 gold badges5151 silver badges6565 bronze badges\n\nasked 21 hours ago\n\nn_nn_n\n\n15155 bronze badges\n\nNew contributor\n\nn_n is a new contributor to this site.

Thus enabling remote sessions to be sped up\nbecause graphics are now being rendered by the GPU; instead of software\nrendering which is slow.\n\n### Why does this work? Not too sure!\n\nI believe that for many systems the HDMI port needs to be active for the GPU\nto render graphics on an RDP connection. And this device works by tricking\nyour system into believing that an HDMI monitor is connected to the system;\nthus RDP graphics are rendered via the GPU instead of software rendering which\nis CPU intensive and slow.\n\nHere are two examples of this cheap and tiny devices with key descriptive text\ncopied here for clarity:\n\n  * Adafruit\u2019s \u201cHDMI Dummy Plug\u201d (Product ID: 4247): \u201cThis HDMI Dummy Plug is a small device that acts as a display emulator. Once it's plugged into the video output socket on your device or computer, the plug punks the operating system into detecting a connected display, and voil\u00e0! Now you have unimpeded access to your graphics card hardware.\u201d\n  * OWC\u2019s Newer Technology HDMI Headless 4K Display Emulator (SKU: NWTADP4KHEAD): \u201cWith the NewerTech HDMI Headless 4K Display Emulator, you can now break free of limited 1024 x 768 or 1280 x 1024 resolution headaches when accessing macOS, Windows, and Linux machines remotely while viewing the desktop with up to full 4K 4096 x 2160 resolution.\u201d\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited 20 hours ago\n\nanswered 20 hours ago\n\nGiacomo1968Giacomo1968\n\n55.3k2121 gold badges166166 silver badges214214 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * 5\n\nI can confirm that we use this exact type of device for this exact reason in\nthe test farms at work.\n\n\u2013 gilliduck\n\n12 hours ago\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
