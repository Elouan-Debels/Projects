It was the first step in determining whether such\nvehicles should be included in the Safe Connections Act, a law aimed at\ncreating rules to establish secure access to communications systems for abuse\nsurvivors.\n\nNow the agency is moving ahead with the effort to determine what rules are\nneeded to make internet-connected cars come into line with the bipartisan act\npassed in 2022. The FCC this week issued a notice of proposed rulemaking,\nasking vehicle manufacturers and wireless service providers to detail the\nconnected car services they use and support, to collect comments about what\nthese organizations can do to protect users from being stalked by those who\nhave abused them, and to determine whether changes need to be made to the Safe\nConnections Act to address the threat that comes from connected cars.\n\n\u201cNo survivor of domestic violence and abuse should have to choose between\ngiving up their car and allowing themselves to be stalked and harmed by those\nwho can access its connectivity and data,\u201d FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel\nsaid in a statement. \u201cWe can \u2013 and should \u2013 do more to make sure these new\nforms of communications help keep survivors safe.\u201d\n\n### Are Cars MVNOs?\n\nThe agency needs to determine if connected cars fall under the definition of\n\u201cmobile virtual network operators\u201d (MVNOs). In the rulemaking notice, the FCC\nindicates that it\u2019s leaning in that direction, noting that wireless providers\nthrough connected cars offer services to consumers and can enter into\nagreements with subscribers who want to add a line to their mobile service\ncontract for the automobile.\n\nCar manufacturers also enter into agreements with owners to provide them with\nconnected car services, the agency said. If connected cars are considered\nMVNOs, the manufacturers would be more tightly regulated regarding the data\nthey collect and store.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nOne of the FCC\u2019s first actions under the Safe Connections Act was to require\ncommunication providers to allow survivors to separate phone lines linked to\nfamily plans that included their abuser, allowing the victim to remain in\ncontact with family and friends but making it difficult for the abuser to\ntrack them, Rosenworcel said.\n\nCellphones are a \u201clifeline\u201d to help survivors rebuild their lives and noted\nthat cars play a similar role. \u201cIt is a means of escape and independence, and\nit is often essential for those seeking employment and support,\u201d Rosenworcel\nsaid. \u201cThat is why in this rulemaking we propose that survivors should be able\nto separate lines that connect their cars, just like they can separate their\nphone lines from family plans.\u201d\n\n### A Growing Problem\n\nThe FCC\u2019s efforts come after reports from The New York Times, Reuters and\nothers showing how abusers can use data from the connected vehicles to locate\nand track their victims.\n\nThe myriad benefits of the connected services in cars \u201cinclude helping to\nlocate a vehicle in a parking lot and connecting promptly with first\nresponders in an emergency without a phone,\u201d the FCC wrote in its notice.\n\u201cThese features typically require the car to have wireless connectivity and to\ncreate and share location data. However, when these data and connectivity are\nin the wrong hands, they may be used to harm a survivor in [leaving] \u2013 or\nattempting to leave \u2013 an abusive relationship.\u201d\n\n### The Auto Lobby Disagrees\n\nNot everyone is onboard with the idea of connected vehicles falling within the\nSafe Connections Act. An auto manufacturing lobbying group, the Alliance for\nAutomotive Innovation, in January argued that the legislation doesn\u2019t apply to\nautomobiles.\n\n\u201cAutomakers do not have \u2018shared mobile service contracts\u2019 associated with\nseparate lines in a single vehicle,\u201d Hilary Cain, senior vice president of\npolicy for the association, wrote in a letter to Rosenworcel. \u201cEach vehicle is\nassociated with a telematics control unit (TCU) which is not capable of making\nand receiving calls in the same manner as a telephone, but instead functions\nto place one-way calls to call centers operated by or on behalf of the\nautomaker.\u201d\n\nIn addition, carmakers don\u2019t keep call records or provider customer-facing\ncall logs. Because the connectivity is associated with the vehicle rather than\na particular person, it can\u2019t be separated among users of the automobile.\n\u201cStated simply, in-vehicle connectivity offerings fall outside of the purview\nof the SCA and the problems associated with shared mobile service contracts\nthat the SCA seeks to address,\u201d Cain wrote.\n\nRecent Articles By Author\n\n  * HHS: Health Care IT Helpdesks Under Attack in Voice Scams\n  * Ivanti CEO Promises Stronger Security After a Year of Flaws\n  * Google Chrome Enlists Emerging DBSC Standard to Fight Cookie Theft\n\nMore from Jeffrey Burt\n\nApril 9, 2024April 9, 2024 Jeffrey Burt automobile, automobiles, Car,\nconnected car security, domestic abuse, fcc, government, MVNO, telematics\n\n  * \u2190 USENIX Security \u201923 \u2013 Qifan Xiao, Xudong Pan, Yifan Lu, Mi Zhang, Jiarun Dai, Min Yang,- xorcising \u201cWraith\u201d: Protecting LiDAR-based Object Detector In Automated Driving System From Appearing Attacks\n\n#### Jeffrey Burt\n\nJeffrey Burt has been a journalist for more than three decades, writing about\ntechnology since 2000.
