Feels sort of offensive, right?\nAs if I'm claiming that you're complicit in your own suffering. This was my\ninitial reaction to The Option Method.\n\nThe Option Method, created by Bruce Di Marsico in the 1970s, is a powerful yet\nsimple approach to understanding and eliminating unhappiness. The lore that I\nheard was that it was mostly forgotten, and has been resurfaced through work\nby Ari Nielsen with Bruce's widow, Deborah Mendel. Ari and Andrew Blevins\nintroduced me to the approach, and I've found it to be an incredibly valuable\ntool.\n\nThis is my attempt at distilling the core concepts in my own language, both to\nselfishly continue internalizing the attitude and to increase the surface area\navailable to others.\n\nAt its core, the Option Method holds that unhappiness is never necessary \u2014 it\nis always optional. The de facto modern worldview argues that you \"should\" be\nhappy, implying that unhappiness is a moral failing. But the Option Method\ntakes a different tack. It simply demonstrates, through a Socratic process of\nquestioning, how you create your own unhappiness by believing it is necessary\nin certain circumstances. Change the beliefs, and the unhappiness evaporates.\n\nIn short, you are unhappy because you think you should be. Indeed, this feels\nweird.\n\nThe goal is not to judge yourself for being unhappy, but to realize at a deep,\nexperiential level that you are the active creator of your unhappiness\u2014for\ngood reasons!\u2014and therefore have the power to let it go if you desire.\nHappiness is your natural state, always accessible to you if you can just drop\nthe belief that something else needs to happen first.\n\n## Happiness is Not Rooted in Circumstance\n\nThe foundational principle of the Option Method is that your emotional state\nin any given moment is the result of your beliefs and attitudes, not what is\nhappening \"out there.\"\n\nThis is a radical idea. We're deeply conditioned by society, culture, family\nand our own experience to believe that happiness depends on things going a\ncertain way. If I get the promotion, make a certain amount of money, find the\nperfect relationship, then I'll be happy. If I don't get what I want, or if\n\"bad\" things happen to me, then I'll be unhappy.\n\nThe Option Method questions this assumption. It asserts that the real cause of\nunhappiness is never the external event itself, but your belief that the event\nmeans you must be unhappy. Change the belief, and the unhappiness\nevaporates\u2014even if the circumstance remains the same.\n\nConsider some everyday examples:\n\n  * Your friend is 15 minutes late to meet you for coffee. You feel irritated, believing her lateness means she doesn't respect your time. But what if you dropped that belief and simply enjoyed your coffee while waiting?\n  * You feel lonely and dejected after a romantic rejection, believing you need a partner to be happy. But what if you recognized that you are a whole, worthy person on your own, and don't need external validation to be good enough?\n  * Your startup is running out of money, causing you to feel like a failure. But what if your company shutting down says nothing about you as a person?\n\nIn each case, it's not the circumstance itself that's causing distress, but\nyour interpretation of it. Change your mind, and you change your experience -\neven if the situation remains exactly the same.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean you never take action to improve your\ncircumstances. It's great to make more money, find meaningful work, and create\nloving relationships. But you don't need to wait for any of that to give\nyourself permission to be happy.\n\n> ... the stance here is that we are the only ones with the power to make\n> ourselves anxious and unhappy, and that we do it actively and repeatedly not\n> because we like it and not because it works well for us, but because we\n> anticipate and fear that it will happen. We anticipate it because we think\n> it has to happen, because we don\u2019t actually see that it\u2019s us terrorizing\n> ourselves from a few recursive layers out. Because at some point we picked\n> up the mistaken belief that this was the only or best way to get what we\n> wanted; which is also the mistaken and internally incoherent belief that\n> perfect happiness requires delaying perfect happiness, again and again,\n> until some imagined moment which (by design) never actually arrives. \u2014 How\n> to Be Happy\n\n## Beliefs, Emotions and Happiness\n\nTo understand how the Option Method works, we need to unpack the relationship\nbetween beliefs, emotions, and happiness.\n\nThe Option Method draws a distinction between two kinds of beliefs:\n\n  1. Practical, concrete beliefs about how the world works. Example: \"This hammer is a good tool for pounding nails.\" These can be objectively true or false.\n  2. Emotional beliefs about what you need to be happy or unhappy. Example: \"I need my partner to appreciate me more to be happy.\" These are always false, because nothing external can make you happy or unhappy. Only your thinking makes it so.\n\nWhen an upsetting event happens\u2014let's say your partner criticizes you\u2014and you\nfeel unhappy, it's not their words that are directly causing your distress.\nIt's an emotional belief that being criticized means you must feel bad about\nyourself. Said differently, the words themselves only carry weight in so much\nas they are attached to meaning that you give them.\n\nLet's look more closely into how this works. Their criticism triggers a belief\nlike \"If my partner thinks I did something wrong, that means I'm a bad\nperson.\" This belief creates an unpleasant emotional sensation in your body,\nwhich you label \"feeling bad about yourself.\" Then you blame your partner for\ncausing you to feel this way.\n\nThe Option Method gently challenges this chain of assumptions. It asks: is it\nreally true that if your partner criticizes you, you must feel like a bad\nperson? As in, is there some law of the universe that requires you to feel bad\nabout yourself if your partner is displeased with you? Even if the criticism\nis valid, must that immediately carry the weight of what it means?\n\nOr is that just an optional belief you picked up somewhere along the way\u2014from\nyour family, your culture, or your past experiences? If it's optional, what\nwould it be like to drop it?\n\nMaybe you could believe that you're a good person who sometimes makes mistakes\n(like all humans), and that your partner's criticism reflects a way you could\nimprove, or perhaps is just a clumsy attempt to get their needs met\u2014not a\nreflection of your worth. From that perspective, you can hear the criticism\nwith an open heart, apologize if appropriate, and let it go. You can even have\ncompassion for your partner's pain without taking it on as your own.\n\nBy rigorously questioning the beliefs underlying your unhappiness, you can\nliterally change your mind and change your life. You stop being a helpless\nvictim of circumstances, or of other people's opinions and behavior, and start\nbeing the creator of your own emotional reality.\n\nNot convinced yet?\n\n## The Desire Behind the Unhappiness\n\nOne of the key insights of the Option Method is that unhappiness is often a\ndistorted expression of something you deeply value and desire.\n\nIn the example of feeling bad when your partner criticizes you, why would you\nchoose to believe their criticism means something terrible about you? It's not\nbecause you enjoy feeling worthless and miserable, right?\n\nIt's more likely because you care about being a good person, being kind and\nskillful in your relationship, and being appreciated by your partner. Those\nare beautiful desires! But somewhere along the line, you internalized a\nmisguided belief that being a good person means never doing anything \"wrong\"\nin your partner's eyes.\n\nSo, their criticism seems to invalidate your deepest values and longings.\nThat's what makes it so painful: it triggers the belief that you're cut off\nfrom what you want most. But that belief is false. Criticism doesn't negate\nyour good intentions, your efforts to learn and grow, or your inherent worth\nas a person. Those remain intact regardless of what anyone says or does.\n\nThe Option Method invites you to recognize that your unhappiness is often\npointing to something precious and important beneath the surface\u2014a clue to\nyour true desires. This is actually interesting, because unhappiness becomes a\nsignal about flawed beliefs that represent true, deeply held values. The\nproblem is that you've gotten confused and started believing that you need a\nspecific situation to fulfill those desires.\n\nSo, you end up chasing after external conditions like a perfect relationship,\nwhen what you really want is to feel loved, capable and appreciated. But you\ncan find ways to fulfill those desires right now, by loving and appreciating\nyourself and being the partner you want to be, regardless of how your mate\nresponds.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\nIn practice, the Option Method is a technique you can do for yourself. Here's\na simple step-by-step process you can use to apply it to any situation where\nyou feel unhappy or upset:\n\n  1. Identify the specific situation or event that triggered your unhappiness. Example: Your partner snaps at you impatiently when you ask them a question.\n  2. Clarify the specific emotions you're feeling in response. Example: Hurt, angry, anxious, diminished.\n  3. Ask yourself: What are you believing about the situation that's creating those emotions? Example: \"If they're annoyed with me, it means I did something wrong. I'm a bad partner and a burden to them.\"\n  4. Question the belief: Is it absolutely, objectively true that your partner's annoyance means something bad about you? Is there any possible scenario where they could be impatient and you could still be a good, lovable person and partner? Dig deep and be radically honest.\n  5. Identify the desire or value underneath the unhappiness. Example: Wanting to be skillful in relationships, to be appreciated and treated with respect.\n\nInterestingly, this by itself if often enough to cause the mistaken beliefs to\ndiffuse, and the underlying desires to shine. Andrew Blevins calls this the\nvia negativa approach. He told me about his own processing using the method,\nwhere he recognized that he had the belief \"I must be a good person\". Once\nrecognizing that this belief was bringing him unhappiness, he was able to\njoyfully let it go.\n\nIt's also possible to take the technique slightly further, by forming new\nbeliefs\u2014a via positiva approach:\n\n  1. Re-frame the belief in a way that affirms your desire and your inherent \"deep okayness\". Example: \"I want to relate skillfully with my partner and I'm committed to learning how to do that. Their impatience reflects their own struggles and isn't a verdict on my worth. I'm a good person and partner, even when I make mistakes.\"\n  2. Consciously choose to adopt the re-framed belief. Relax your body, breathe into your heart area, and imagine dropping the old belief like a heavy suitcase and walking away. Claim the new perspective as your own. Feel how much lighter and freer you are without the burden of believing you need to be perfect to be happy.\n\nYou may want to experiment how far to take it. There's power in just\nrecognizing the flawed beliefs without replacement, and many people have the\nmost success with that. Others find better outcomes by recognizing what\nbeliefs they'd prefer to have.\n\nIt may take some practice before this process becomes second nature. You're\nunlearning mental habits that have been with you for decades. But eventually,\neven the most painful situations will lose their sting. The gap between\ntrigger and response will widen, and you'll be able to move through upsets\nquickly and gracefully. What's on the other side is default happiness.\n\n## Objections and FAQs\n\nIt's normal for concerns and objections to arise. Your mind has spent your\nwhole life believing that external circumstances control your happiness, so it\nwill naturally resist such a radical reframe. Let's address some questions\nthat I had:\n\nQ: Isn't unhappiness sometimes useful as a motivator? Don't we need fear,\nguilt and shame to keep us in line and make sure we do the right thing?\n\nThis is a very common belief, but it's exactly backwards. Unhappiness is a\nterrible motivator. It saps your energy, distorts your thinking and narrows\nyour possibilities. Happiness energizes you, inspires you and connects you\nwith your innate creativity and drive.\n\nA much more effective motivator is to consciously connect with your authentic\ndesires and values. If you want to make a positive change like being kinder in\nyour relationships or taking better care of your health, anchor that intention\nin your deepest values rather than in fear or self-judgment. Focus on what you\nwant to see more of and how good it will feel to move in that direction,\nrather than on what you want to avoid.\n\nQ: But what about serious situations like abuse, poverty or life-threatening\nillness? Are you saying we should just think positive and be happy about\nthose?\n\nAbsolutely not. This isn't about spiritual bypass or denying real hardship.\nIt's about empowering yourself to make real changes from a centered, grounded\nplace rather than from frantic unhappiness. Think \"empowered\" instead of\n\"powerless\".\n\nIf you're in an abusive relationship, the problem is your relationship. But\nyou'll be far more effective at leaving if you move from a place of clarity\nand self-love rather than from guilt, self-doubt, and despair. Unhappiness\nkeeps you paralyzed and stuck. Challenging the beliefs that create it restores\nyour power and choice.\n\nUnhappiness doesn't make you safer. Finding your equilibrium and affirming\nyour right to protect yourself, on the other hand, could save your life. You\ncan take positive action without making yourself miserable in the process.\n\nQ: I'm on board with the theory, but I'm having a hard time applying it. I've\nbeen unhappy for so long that it feels impossible to change. What should I do?\n\nGo slow and be very gentle with yourself. Remember, you're unlearning thought\npatterns that have been with you since childhood. It's like learning a new\nlanguage or a musical instrument. It takes consistent practice over time.\n\nStart with small, low-stakes upsets and gradually work up to more challenging\nmaterial. If you get stuck and feel like you're going in circles, remember\nthat your worth is never in question, even if you can't find your way to\nhappiness in a particular moment.\n\nRead books on the topic (linked below). This post is just a summary. But most\nof all, keep experimenting. Every time you question an unhappy belief and find\nyour way back to peace and clarity, you're strengthening this new muscle. It\ngets easier.\n\nQ: I'm clinically depressed, and this keeps making me feel like I deserve\nunhappiness if indeed it's my choice. What should I do?\n\nWhile the Option Method suggests that beliefs create unhappiness, this doesn't\nmean you're choosing depression or that it's your fault. Depression tells you\nthat you're broken, defective, unworthy of happiness. But that simply isn't\ntrue. You are not your depression. It's also not as simple as just deciding to\nbe happy. Happiness becomes the default state behind flawed beliefs about\nyourself.\n\nThe Option Method can be a valuable tool, but it's not a substitute for\ncomprehensive professional care if that's what's needed. Use it to cultivate\nself-compassion and gradually loosen the grip of depressive thoughts\u2014not to\nblame yourself. You are worthy of happiness, love and healing. The path out of\ndepression is rarely quick or linear, but it is absolutely possible.\n\n## Liberating unhappiness\n\nAt its heart, the Option Method is a deeply empowering and liberating approach\nto life. It doesn't sugarcoat the human condition or promise a quick fix. It\nrequires sincere self-reflection, courageous honesty and a willingness to take\nfull responsibility for your inner world. Likewise, it doesn't even claim that\nyou should choose happiness.\n\nIf offers a joyous, loving path, reconnecting you with your innate wholeness,\nwisdom and wellbeing. It frees you from the tyranny of external circumstances\nand affirms the primacy of your own heart and mind in creating your reality.\n\nIf these ideas resonate with you, I encourage you to explore them further.\nPractice the steps I've outlined here and track your results. Notice how your\nexperience of life begins to shift and open up.\n\nIf reading this has stirred up both hope and skepticism, congratulations:\nyou're in the perfect position to test drive the Option Method. Andrew Blevins\nhas several additional resources at the bottom of his essay that may be\nhelpful. Approach it as an experiment. Start noticing your moments of\nunhappiness and asking \"What would I have to believe to feel this way? Is that\nbelief really true?\" Be gentle and patient as you unravel old patterns.\n\nYou can unlearn the habit of unhappiness. It may just be the most important\nwork you ever do.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Noah Maier\n\nSpecial thanks to Andrew Blevins and Ari Nielsen for their feedback.\n\n### Thoughts? Feedback?
