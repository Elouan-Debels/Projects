Falling gas prices conceal wider problems\n\nCountries now have abundant gas supplies but years of high costs led to a\npervasive economic slowdown\n\nJillian Ambrose Energy correspondent\n\nThu 4 Apr 2024 06.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nEurope is leaving behind the winter months with gas storage facilities\nbrimming at all-time highs. This abundance of gas has allowed wholesale market\nprices to tumble, and home energy bills to drift down towards levels last seen\nbefore Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSo after years in the grip of crippling costs for home heating and power is\nEurope\u2019s energy crisis over? Experts have cautioned that waning gas and\nelectricity markets and falling bills belie a deeper economic hangover that\ncould extend into the next decade.\n\n\u201cIs the energy crisis over? No,\u201d says Tomas Marzec-Manser, head of gas\nanalytics at the data provider ICIS. \u201cI would say that we\u2019re managing the\ncrisis. But the wider economic picture has become its own beast.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade before the Ukraine invasion of February 2022, Russian\npipelines were Europe\u2019s biggest single source of imported gas. After Moscow\u2019s\nattack these imports plunged by two-thirds from their peak in 2019, causing a\nmarket shock that forced wholesale prices to almost 10 times the pre-crisis\nlevel.\n\nToday there are clear signs that the immediate gas supply crunch that first\nemerged in the after the pandemic \u2013 and escalated after Russia\u2019s war on\nUkraine \u2013 has begun to show signs of easing.\n\nEU agrees plan to enable member states to end all gas imports from Russia\n\nRead more\n\nEurope has emerged from its second winter without access to Russian supplies\nwith gas stores at a record 59% full, according to the industry body Gas\nInfrastructure Europe, thanks to pipeline imports from Norway and seaborne\ncargoes from the US.\n\nGas stores will be 95% full by the start of September this year, according to\nICIS, well above an EU target to fill their facilities to 90% by November.\nThis abundance of gas should mean that market prices will continue to fall.\n\nEarly forecasts suggest that Europe\u2019s benchmark gas price may tumble to an\naverage \u20ac28.32/MWh (\u00a324.28/MWh) through the summer months from April to\nSeptember, down by more than 17% from the average in summer last year, but\nstill more than double the \u20ac11.58/MWh average recorded in the summer of 2019.\n\nFor electricity markets, benchmark prices are forecast to fall by more than a\nthird from last summer to an average of \u20ac63.18/MWh between April and\nSeptember, the lowest summer reading since 2020.\n\nThe slump in Europe\u2019s energy markets has already filtered through to homes. In\nthe UK, the regulator Ofgem\u2019s energy price cap, which sets the maximum price\nthat suppliers can charge per unit of gas or electricity, fell by \u00a3238 to\n\u00a31,690 for the typical annual dual-fuel bill earlier this week \u2013 its lowest\nfor two years.\n\n\u201cBut lower prices alone are not enough to articulate the end of the energy\ncrisis,\u201d according to Marzec-Manser. \u201cThere\u2019s a wider economic picture to\nconsider.\u201d\n\nThe recent fall in market prices is in part due to the economic gloom caused\nby the energy crisis itself, he says. Rising energy bills have triggered\ninflation across major economies, leading to a cost of living crisis that has\nslowed consumer demand for new products.\n\nThis in turn has reduced economic activity across Europe\u2019s industrial\nheartlands, and has kept a lid on gas demand from heavy industry. Marzec-\nManser expects industrial gas demand to remain 20% below pre-pandemic levels\nthis year.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

EU countries have typically replaced Russia gas\nimports with seaborne cargoes of liquified natural gas (LNG), triggering a\nwave of investments in new import terminals to provide the gas to fuel an\neconomic recovery.\n\nClean energy advocates have urged governments to do more to replace Russian\ngas imports with homegrown renewable alternatives. But Europe\u2019s weaker market\nprices may be making it more difficult for clean energy developers to play\ntheir part in weaning economies off fossil fuels.\n\nRobert Jackson-Stroud, an analyst at ICIS, says many energy buyers have seized\nthe opportunity to lock in lower energy costs by striking long-term deals for\nrenewable energy supplies at discount rates based on the forward curve for\nwholesale electricity prices.\n\nFor many developers the cost of building renewable energy projects, including\nwind and solar farms, has surged amid supply chain inflation triggered by the\nenergy crisis. However, they are still being asked to sell the power they\ngenerate based on the weaker energy prices forecast for the years ahead.\n\nThe weaker market prices and higher supply chain costs also mean that\ngovernment schemes to support investment in new power projects will become\nmore expensive for the public purse, Jackson-Stroud added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s created a cycle which will echo through for another decade,\u201d he says.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Gas\n  * Commodities\n  * Russia\n  * Europe\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
