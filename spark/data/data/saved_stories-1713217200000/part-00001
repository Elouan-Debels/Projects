The Dynafin system\npromises up to 85% efficiency, while giving a vessel super-precise maneuvering\ncapabilities.\n\nEarlier this month, we featured a Whale Design propeller that looked to nature\nfor improved efficiency. Switzerland's ABB Marine has also been inspired by\n\"the dynamic motions of a whale's tail\" for its multi-blade Dynafin propulsion\nconcept.\n\nABB Marine says that if the shipping industry was a country, it would be the\nsixth largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. The International Maritime\nOrganization has set a target of 50% reductions of global emissions by 2050,\ncompared to levels in 2008, and now the race is on to find and use cleaner\nfuels and technologies to help meet these goals.\n\nMore Stories\n\nAutomotive\n\n8-seat mini-camper shifts instantly from MPV to RV via stackable pods\n\nAutomotive\n\nHydrogen-burning Alpenglow hypercar is about to go endurance racing\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\n\"These challenges require smarter solutions to keep things moving while still\nconsuming less energy,\" said ABB's Janne Pohjalainen. \"ABB has long been at\nthe forefront of propulsion innovation, having undertaken a major step with\nthe launch of the first generation Azipod system in the 1990s, which changed\nthe way ship operate today... Now it's time to take the next big leap with our\nlatest innovation that is inspired by the movement perfected by evolution.\"\n\nThe Dynafin concept has been more than a decade in research and development,\nand is described as essentially a cycloidal propeller \u2013 where vertical blades\nare mounted to a spinning circular plate to provide thrust. It's not a new\nidea, the Cyclogyro from and few years back took the setup to eVTOLs while\nVoith Schneider props have seen use by the US and French Navies.\n\n\"Each blade is individually controlled by an electric motor, a frequency\nconverter (to control torque and rpm) and control logic\"\n\nABB\n\nFor ABB's take on the design, an electric motor drives a large disc on the\nunderside of a ship or boat, which spins at between 40 and 80 revolutions per\nminute as needed. The concept shows five independently controllable blades\nmounted below the disc, sitting equidistant along the circular edge \u2013 though\nthe setup can run from four to six modules.\n\nThe combined efforts of wheel and blades generate propulsion in a motion\nlikened to that of the tail of dolphin or whale. An onboard control system can\nrotate each blade around its own axis in real-time for simultaneous propulsion\nand steering of the vessel without needing to install a rudder.\n\nABB is promising instant thrust control, precise dynamic positioning\ncapabilities and superior maneuverability, and is aiming for an open-water\nefficiency of up to 85%. The modular concept can also be optimized for\ndifferent operator needs, different ship types and hull types.\n\nAmong the claimed advantages over more conventional propeller designs is a\nnotable improvement in efficiency that could lead to significant savings on\nfuel costs for combustion engine vessels, with fewer emissions as an added\nbonus. The system boasts a relatively low component count too, which should\nmake for reduced maintenance costs.\n\nIndependent testing of a passenger vessel fitted with different propulsion\nsystems found that the ABB Dynafin managed energy savings of up to 22%\ncompared to conventional shaftline configurations\n\nABB\n\nIt should also be possible to run a boat on a more compact power plant, with\nABB noting that this could be of particular significance for vessels running\nelectric, fuel-cell or hybrid systems where large battery banks can take up\nvaluable cargo space.\n\nSuch vessels can operate in \"sensitive marine areas\" too, thanks to the motors\nbeing housed within the host vessel's hull for reduced underwater noise,\ncombined with the relatively \"low-pressure pulses and blade-tip speeds\"\ncreating less turbulence.\n\nIt's not clear at this stage whether such a system could be painlessly\nretrofitted to existing ships and boats, or at what price to owners, though it\ncould open up a world of new possibilities for designers of new builds.\n\nThe project, which was first unveiled mid-2023, is still at the concept stage\nof development at the moment. ABB reports that successful simulations and\nscale-model testing have been undertaken, and contact made with ship designers\n\"to validate the feasibility of the concept.\"\n\nIn fact, independent testing of a passenger vessel fitted with different\npropulsion systems found that the ABB Dynafin solution managed energy savings\nof 22% compared to conventional shaftline configurations. The first full\nprototype is coming next year.\n\n\"The ABB Dynafin generates thrust by means of profiled blades that project\nfrom the bottom of the ship. Each blade can rotate both around the global axis\nof a main wheel and around its own local axis, which acts as a pivot point for\nenforcing a prescribed pitch motion. The thrusting blades\u2019 trajectories\nresemble those of the tails of whales and dolphins.\"\n\nABB\n\n\"ABB Dynafin shows what is possible when marine engineers pursue radical\ninnovation and progress, inspired by the interplay of evolution and\ntechnology,\" said ABB's Juha Koskela at concept launch. \"This solution is all\nabout operational efficiency and emissions avoidance, leveraging innovations\nfrom the brightest minds in marine and propulsion engineering.\"\n\nThe company envisions a 1 to 4 MW per propulsor unit being suitable for small\nand medium-sized passenger or work vessels, though larger vessels such as\ncruise ships could host multiple units \u2013 and plans already call for the\ntechnology to be incorporated in a new 450-ft superyacht called Aeolis from\nOceanco.

That will do wonders for marine life, especially cetaceans that get too\nclose, which already suffer from regular propeller strikes. Someone didn't\nthink this through.\n\nYourAmazonOrder April 12, 2024 04:48 PM\n\nSushi.\n\nwarmer April 12, 2024 08:35 PM\n\nAnd somehow they thought mounting chefs knifes was the safer propeller...\n\nalan c April 13, 2024 06:40 AM\n\nI find it hard to believe the possible energy reduction when a) the blades are\nsymmetrical and can never be as optimised as a conventional prop blade, and b)\nat two points in each rotation they will only be causing drag and no thrust\n(when moving upstream, or downstream faster than stream).\n\nKmbrlb April 13, 2024 08:43 AM\n\nLooks like a marine life ninja blender.

This looks like it would julienne the\nback of a whale. The inventors should delelop some kind of shield against\ncontact with marine mammals.\n\nchristopher April 14, 2024 06:38 PM\n\nBrilliant idea, stupid video: looks like they deliberately obscured everything\nabout how-it-works (probably they not figure out their I.P. protection\nproperly). It's basically an underwater powered VAWT (vertial-axis wind-\nturbine) with movable blades.\n\nFunny how they messed up their math and forgot to put a plate at the bottom of\nall the blades - they'd eradicate all tip vorticies and losses if they'd\nthought it through properly.\n\nLoad More\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
