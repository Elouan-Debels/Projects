We at Mapbox were right there with you,\nand we're excited to share some fascinating insights from our Movement data.\n\nMapbox Movement is a global privacy-forward dataset of mobile device activity,\nbuilt on our first-party telemetry data, and powered by over 700M monthly\nactive users.\n\nWe provided The New York Times with Mapbox Movement data for the week before\nand during the eclipse, focusing on the path of totality. This allowed them to\nanalyze how the eclipse impacted travel patterns. Their fantastic analysis\nrevealed a dramatic increase in activity within the eclipse path.\n\nOur team at Mapbox also looked at the activity data on the day of the eclipse,\nand compared it to the average activity over the previous four Mondays. The\nresulting map shows the regions in the path of the eclipse \"light up\" with\nincreases in activity of 25% and more \u2014 possibly the largest single-day change\nin on-the-ground activity in the U.S. that we have observed in the four years\nthat we have been generating this data.\n\nSome of the locations across the country have experienced enormous spikes in\nactivity, either as people flocked to watch the eclipse, or as they passed\nthrough them on their way to or from their eclipse-watching destinations. For\nexample, parts of Missouri experienced a bump of around 1.5 times the volume\nof the normal Monday activity, while activity in the county of Essex, Vermont\nwas almost four times its normal Monday average.\n\nThe weather seems to have played a role as well. Several days before the\neclipse, the forecasts predicted cloud cover with a chance of rain in Texas\nand southern Kansas, while parts of Missouri, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and New\nEngland were expected to be the best spots for viewing. These align with the\nareas of relatively low and high activity in our maps, respectively.\n\nMap of activity by the hour. Lines of equal levels of obscuration on the map\nare provided by NASA\u2019s Scientific Visualization Studio, at 2023 and 2024 Solar\nEclipses: Map and Data.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of the movement on the ground actually happened\nbefore and after the eclipse. In the path of the eclipse, we see some of the\nlowest activity values in the hour of eclipse peak \u2014 as people across the\ncountry stopped everything they were doing, and stared in awe.\n\nIn the end, the eclipse was probably a net benefit to the local economies,\nboth on the day of the event, and in the surrounding days. In Tuesday's\nactivity map, the eclipse path remains clearly visible, albeit with not nearly\nas much of a bump in movement, suggesting that some of the eclipse-chasers\nhave waited until the following day to travel home.\n\nChange in human activity on the Tuesday after the solar eclipse, relative to\nthe previous four Tuesdays\n\nMapbox continues our innovation on Movement data, and we just released the\nlatest version of our dataset, providing broader coverage, enhanced privacy,\nand higher consistency over time.\n\nIf you're interested in how Mapbox Movement data can help your team, download\nthe free sample or reach out at movement@mapbox.com.\n\n# Heading 1\n\n## Heading 2\n\n### Heading 3\n\n#### Heading 4\n\n##### Heading 5\n\n###### Heading 6\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor\nincididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
