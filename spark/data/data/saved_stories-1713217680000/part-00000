The company\u2019s route to market is to get\nautomakers to integrate its software into their cars, Shotton said.\n\nThe expansion is a vote of confidence for Vancouver, an aspiring tech hub. A\nreasonable drive from Seattle, the Canadian city has major offices for the\nlikes of Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. as well as a healthy startup scene.\n\n\u201cVancouver is obviously a very international hub for North America, and highly\nattractive for businesses through favorable immigration policies,\u201d Shotton\nsaid. It has a \u201cpro-innovation, pro-AI policy environment that gives us the\nconfidence to invest.\u201d\n\nWayve was founded by PhDs from the University of Cambridge in 2017. It\u2019s\nraised more than US$258 million from investors including Microsoft, Eclipse\nVentures LLC, Balderton Capital, Baillie Gifford & Co., D1 Capital Partners,\nMoore Strategic Ventures LLC, Virgin and Ocado Group Plc. The Vancouver office\nwill hire about 10 researchers this year and expand from there, Shotton said,\nadding to Wayve\u2019s about 240 employees.\n\nU.K. filings show individual investors in Wayve include Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s\nchief AI scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya\nSutskever. Last year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates publicly tested the\nWayve system in central London with Wayve co-founder Alex Kendall.\n\nRelated\n\n  * Musk says Tesla will unveil robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares jump\n\n  * Apple cancels work on electric car, shifts team to generative AI\n\n  * Remote software updates transforming auto industry, experts say\n\n### FAANG stocks\n\n  * 2:05\n\n5 things you need to know for the trading day\n\n  * 6:52\n\nMeta has lost consumer trust, favour Alphabet and Amazon for FANG buys right\nnow: Hatem Dhiab\n\n  * 5:10\n\nStay away from the FAANG, but remain invested in tech: Strategist\n\n  * 3:57\n\nDarren Sissons discusses the FAANG stocks and Microsoft\n\n  * 5:40\n\nAmazon breakout would be a 'really big deal': Fairlead Strategies founder\nKatie Stockton\n\n  * 6:33\n\nInvestors to see 'nothing but blowout earnings' for this quarter: Belpointe's\nDavid Nelson\n\n  1.
