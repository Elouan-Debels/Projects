Everyone else is going to tell you\nhow great open source has been. I'm gonna tell you how we failed.\u201d\n\nOpen source had taken over the business software world, he said, at least for\na particular set of applications. But in many areas, and certainly outside of\nthe business world, it is not nearly as successful.\n\nMoreover, he said, \u201cWe have a great corporate welfare programme. Our users are\nthe richest companies in the world. Indeed, we've enabled companies like\nGoogle to be created.\u201d\n\nOpen source developers, on the other hand, were often uncompensated unless\nthey were working for those companies. Other than the likes of Google, the\norganisations making money were those \u2013 like IBM \u2013 who offered support.\n\nThe current open source licensing system isn\u2019t working either, he said, with a\nthird of Linux systems being sold \u201cwith a GPL circumvention prohibiting\nredistribution of source code. That\u2019s billions of dollars in business.\u201d\nMeanwhile, companies that wanted to follow the rules of open source were\nspending millions on compliance.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t we give them something better to do with that money?\u201d he asked.\n\nPerens said it was time for a different paradigm, \u201cThat addresses some of the\nproblems with open source. Open source will continue, must continue. What I'm\nsuggesting was never called open source.\u201d\n\nHe described his proposition as \u201cPost-Open\u201d and said it was a way to\ncompensate individuals and small entities doing open source work.\n\nThe aim is to \u201ccompensate developers fairly for their work [and] motivate\ndevelopers to write for the common person by paying them.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, \u201ccompliance must be a once and done for the year\nprocess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we're doing is developing a Post-Open Source Collection, which would all\nbe under one licence, one payment, you get this the whole thing.\u201d\n\nThis would offer \u201cOne license, one contract for paid users, one operating\nagreement for developers.\u201d Entities over a certain size, Perens suggested $5m,\nor which wanted to keep their modifications private, would pay a fraction of\nend user revenue. They would also have to annually audit what software they\nuse and redistribute.\n\nThere would be a small number of companies that collect money and distribute\nit to developers.\n\nPayments would be decided by instrumenting git depositories to determine the\ncontributions of individual developers. \u201cSome developers, architects, janitors\nwould have to account for hours to be compensated fairly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do this, we can operate support as one entity for all Post-Open\ndevelopers, and provide the user with one throat to choke.\u201d\n\nThe cash lavished on support under the current system, would instead flow to\ndevelopers, with some earmarked for development of user software, enforcement,\nlobbying, education and the like.\u201d\n\nAs well as more stable, better maintained software, user companies would get\neasier compliance, he said. And presumably pay less overall.\n\nPerens said he made grant applications for $100,000 for legal work to support\nthe project, and allowed half for year of his own work to develop polices and\nprocesses. If the grants don\u2019t come through, there were companies willing to\nfund it, he said, though independence is imperative.\n\nPeter Zaitsev, co-founder of Percona and investor in numerous other open\nsource projects, said Perens\u2019 proposal went beyond a slight improvement to\nopen source. \u201cThis is a completely different approach.\u201d\n\nAs an entrepreneur, he said \u201cI love the idea of trying something else then see\nif that works.\u201d\n\nBut, Zaitsev continued, \u201cThe problem with this approach is how it is not very\ncompatible with existing open source as it is.\u201d\n\nHe cited Spotify as an analogy, where song writers get a little bit of money\nevery time a song is played. But with open source \u2013 and even closed source\nwith open source components \u2013 \u201ca single piece of software usually is going to\ninclude so many components.\u201d\n\nPerens admitted his proposal was \u201cA big stretch compared to open source. But\nwhen we started open source, if I had told you about it, I would have thought\nI was just as crazy as you might today.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI'm not building a fiefdom. I'm 66 years old, I've had cancer for\n30 years, I still feel great but I won't be around to run this. And so you\nwill be.\u201d\n\nCould not load content Could not load content\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * RSS\n\n  * Sign up\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Stack \u2013 Published with Ghost & Tripoli\n\n", "frontpage": true}
