What was he looking for?\n\nBy Stephen Metcalf\n\nJames Zucco\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nThe Isle of Jura is a patchwork of bogs and moorland laid across a quartzite\nslab in Scotland\u2019s Inner Hebrides. Nearly 400 miles from London, rain-lashed,\nmore deer than people: All the reasons not to move there were the reasons\nGeorge Orwell moved there. Directions to houseguests ran several paragraphs\nand could include a plane, trains, taxis, a ferry, another ferry, then miles\nand miles on foot down a decrepit, often impassable rural lane. It\u2019s safe to\nsay the man wanted to get away. From what?\n\n## Explore the May 2024 Issue\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nView More\n\nOrwell himself could be sentimental about his longing to escape (\u201cThinking\nalways of my island in the Hebrides,\u201d he\u2019d once written in his wartime diary)\nor wonderfully blunt. In the aftermath of Hiroshima, he wrote to a friend:\n\n> This stupid war is coming off in abt 10\u201320 years, & this country will be\n> blown off the map whatever else happens. The only hope is to have a home\n> with a few animals in some place not worth a bomb.\n\nIt helps also to remember Orwell\u2019s immediate state of mind when he finally\nfully moved to Jura, in May 1946. Four months before Hiroshima, his wife,\nEileen, had died; shortly after the atomic bomb was dropped, Animal Farm was\npublished.\n\nFrom the March 1947 issue: George Orwell\u2019s \u2018The Prevention of Literature\u2019\n\nAlmost at once, in other words, Orwell became a widower, terrified by the\ncoming postwar reality, and famous\u2014the latter a condition he seems to have\nregarded as nothing but a bother. His newfound sense of dread was only adding\nto one he\u2019d felt since 1943, when news of the Tehran Conference broke. The\nmeeting had been ominous to Orwell: It placed in his head the idea of\nRoosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin divvying up the postwar world, leading to a\nglobal triopoly of super-states. The man can be forgiven for pouring every\nounce of his grief, self-pity, paranoia (literary lore had it that he thought\nStalin might have an ice pick with his name on it), and embittered egoism into\nthe predicament of his latest protagonist, Winston Smith.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given that it culminated in both his masterpiece and his\ndeath, Orwell\u2019s time on the island has been picked over by biographers, but\nOrwell\u2019s Island: George, Jura and 1984, by Les Wilson, treats it as a subject\nworthy of stand-alone attention. The book is at odds with our sense of Orwell\nas an intrepid journalist. It is a portrait of a man jealously guarding his\nsense of himself as a creature elementally apart, even as he depicts the\nhorrors of a world in which the human capacity for apartness is being hunted\ndown and destroyed.\n\nWilson is a former political journalist, not a critic, who lives on\nneighboring Islay, famous for its whiskeys. He is at pains to show how Orwell,\non Jura, overcame one of his laziest prejudices: The author went from taking\nevery opportunity to laugh at the Scots for their \u201cburns, braes, kilts,\nsporrans, claymores, bagpipes\u201d (who is better at the derisive list than\nOrwell?) to complaining about the relative lack of Gaelic-language radio\nprogramming.\n\nHe lived without electricity or phone, shot rabbits \u201cfor the pot,\u201d raised\ngeese to be slaughtered and plucked, and fished the surrounding waters in a\ndinghy.\n\nScottish had come to mean something more to him than kailyard kitsch. These\nwere a people holding out against a fully amalgamated identity, beginning with\nthe Kingdom of Great Britain and extending to modernity itself. On Jura at\nleast, crofters and fishermen still lived at a village scale. As to whether\nJura represented, as has been suggested, suicide by other means\u2014Orwell was\nchronically ill, and Barnhill, his cottage, was 25 miles from the island\u2019s one\ndoctor\u2014Wilson brushes this aside. In fact, he argues that Jura was \u201ckinder to\nOrwell\u2019s ravaged lungs than smog-smothered London,\u201d where inhabitants were\nburning scavenged wood to stay warm.\n\nAt Barnhill, Orwell set up almost a society in miniature, devoting his 16-acre\nhomestead to his ideal of self-sufficiency. Soon after moving there, he was\njoined by his sister, his 2-year-old adopted son, and a nanny. Amid the\ngeneral, often biting, austerity of postwar Europe, they enjoyed a private\ncornucopia, subsisting on, as Wilson says, a diet of \u201cfish, lobster, rabbit,\nvenison and fresh milk and eggs,\u201d and were often warmed by peat that Orwell\nhimself had cut. He intended to live there for the rest of his life, raising\nhis son and relishing an existence as a non-cog in a noncapitalist machine.\n\nFrom the July 2019 issue: Doublethink is stronger than Orwell imagined\n\nHe lived without electricity or phone; shot rabbits \u201cfor the pot,\u201d as Wilson\nsays; raised geese to be slaughtered and plucked; and fished the surrounding\nwaters in a dinghy. He fashioned a tobacco pouch from animal skin and a\nmustard spoon out of deer bone, and served his aghast guests a seaweed\nblancmange. Over time, absconding to Jura and writing 1984 became aspects of a\nsingle premonition: a coming world of perpetual engulfment by the forces of\nbigness. As Orwell\u2019s latest biographer, D. J. Taylor, has pointed out in\nOrwell: The New Life, Orwell\u2019s novels before Animal Farm followed a common\ntemplate of a sensitive young person going up against a heartless society,\ndestined to lose. Eileen is the one who helped him\u2014either by suggesting that\nAnimal Farm be told as a fable or by lightening his touch, depending on whom\nyou talk to\u2014find a newly engaging, even playful (in its way), register.\n\nThe loss of Eileen and return of the self-pitying Orwell alter ego are\ncertainly linked. And indeed, in 1984 he produces his most Orwellian novel, in\nboth senses\u2014only now both protagonist and situation are presented in the\nabsolute extreme : The young man is the bearer (if we believe his tormentor,\nO\u2019Brien) of the last shred of human autonomy, in a society both totally\ncorrupt and laying total claim to his being.\n\nWhat this absolutism produced, of course, was not another fusty neo-Edwardian\nnovel \u00e0 la Orwell\u2019s earlier Keep the Aspidistra Flying, but a wild, aggrieved\ntour de force of dystopian erotica. Odd though it may sound, given the novel\u2019s\nunremitting torments, 1984 quickly became a best seller, in no small part\nbecause its first readers, especially in America, found it comforting\u2014a source\nof the release you might feel, in a darkened theater, when you remember that\nyou yourself are not being chased by a man with a chain saw. The reader could\nglance up, notice no limitless police powers or kangaroo inquisitions, and\nsay: We are not them.\n\nSuch complacency is hard to come by in 2024. Thinking of Orwell, famous though\nhe is for his windowpane prose and the prescience of his essays, as the\nultimate sane human being is not so easy either. Rereading 1984 in light of\nthe Jura episode suggests that Orwell was an altogether weirder person, and\nhis last novel an altogether weirder book, than we\u2019ve appreciated.\n\nConventionally speaking, 1984 is not a good novel; it couldn\u2019t be. Novels are\nabout the conflict between an individual\u2019s inner-generated aims and a\nprevailing social reality that denies or thwarts them. 1984 is the depiction\nof the collapse of this paradigm\u2014the collapse of inner and outer in all\npossible iterations. Of course its protagonist is thinly drawn: Winston\u2019s self\nlacks a social landscape to give it dimensionality.\n\nIn place of anything like a novel proper, we get a would-be bildungsroman\nbreaking through to the surface in disparate fragments. These scraps are\nWinston\u2019s yearnings, memories, sensual instincts, which have, as yet, somehow\ngone unmurdered by the regime. The entire state-sponsored enterprise of\nPavlovian sadism in Oceania is devoted to snuffing out this remnant\ninteriority.\n\nThe facsimile of a life that Winston does enact comes courtesy of a series of\nprivate spaces\u2014a derelict church, a clearing in the woods, a room above a junk\nshop\u2014the last of which is revealed to have been a regime-staged contrivance.\nThe inexorable momentum of the novel is toward the final such private space,\nWinston\u2019s last line of defense, and the last line of defense in any\ntotalitarian society: the hidden compartment of his mind.\n\nWhen all else fails, there is the inaccessibility of human mentality to\nothers, a black box in every respect. Uncoincidentally, Winston\u2019s final\ndefense\u2014hiding out in his head\u2014had been Orwell\u2019s first. While he struggled on\nJura to finish 1984, Orwell apparently returned to \u201cSuch, Such Were the Joys,\u201d\nhis long and excoriating essay about his miserable years at St. Cyprian\u2019s\nboarding school. He\u2019d been sent there at the age of 8, one of the shabby-\ngenteel boys with brains in what was otherwise a class snob\u2019s paradise. He was\na bed wetter to boot, for which, Orwell writes, he was brutally punished. No\nwonder he found dignity in apartness. Taylor\u2019s biography is brilliant about\nthe connection between Orwell\u2019s childhood reminiscence and 1984.\n\nIn the essay, Orwell portrays his alma mater as an environment that invaded\nevery cranny of its pupils\u2019 lives. Against this, he formed his sense of\nbearing \u201cat the middle of one\u2019s heart,\u201d as he writes, \u201can incorruptible inner\nself\u201d holding out against an autocratic headmistress. As a cop in Burma, a\nscullion in Paris, an amateur ethnographer in northern England, he was a man\nwho kept his own company, even when in company, and whom others, as a\nconsequence, found by and large inscrutable.\n\nWhat was this man\u2019s genius, if not taking the petty anxieties of Eric Blair,\nhis given name, and converting them into the moral clarity of George Orwell?\nFearful that his own cherished apartness was being co-opted into nonexistence,\nhe projected his fear for himself onto something he called the \u201cautonomous\nindividual,\u201d who, as he said in his 1940 essay \u201cInside the Whale,\u201d \u201cis going\nto be stamped out of existence.\u201d To this he added:\n\n> The literature of liberalism is coming to an end and the literature of\n> totalitarianism has not yet appeared and is barely imaginable. As for the\n> writer, he is sitting on a melting iceberg; he is merely an anachronism, a\n> hangover from the bourgeois age, as surely doomed as the hippopotamus.\n\nThe fate of the autonomous individual, \u201cthe writer,\u201d the literature of\nliberalism\u2014he carried all of it to Jura, where he dumped it onto the head of\npoor Winston Smith.\n\nOrwell typed for hours upstairs, sitting on his iron bedstead in a tatty\ndressing gown, chain-smoking shag tobacco. In May 1947, he felt he had a third\nof a draft, and in November, a completed one. In December, he was in a\nhospital outside Glasgow, diagnosed with \u201cchronic\u201d tuberculosis\u2014not a death\nsentence, maybe, but his landlord on Jura suspected that Orwell now knew he\nwas dying.\n\nThe following July, after grueling treatments and a stint in a sanatorium, he\nreturned to Jura fitter but by no means cured, and under strict orders to take\nit easy. His rough draft, however, was a riot of scrawled-over pages. To\nproduce a clean manuscript for the publisher, he would need to hire and\nclosely supervise a typist, but no candidate was willing to trek to Jura, and\nOrwell was unwilling to leave it. He typed 1984 on his own, having all but\nspent himself writing it.\n\n1984 is Orwell saying goodbye to himself, and an improbably convincing\nportrait of the erasure of the autonomous individual.\n\n\u201cHe should have been in bed,\u201d Wilson says, and instead sat \u201cpropped up on a\nsofa\u201d banging out 5,000 words a day. Among all of its gruesome set pieces,\nculminating in Room 101 in the Ministry of Love, the novel\u2019s most decisive act\nof torment is a simple glance in the mirror. Winston is sure\u2014it is one of his\nlast consolations, before breaking completely\u2014that some inherent principle\nexists in the universe to prevent a system based on nothing but cruelty and\nself-perpetuation from triumphing forever. O\u2019Brien calmly assures Winston that\nhe\u2019s wrong, that he is \u201cthe last man,\u201d and to prove it, and the obvious\nnonexistence of \u201cthe human spirit,\u201d he forces Winston to look at himself:\n\n> A bowed, greycoloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its\n> actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it\n> to be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The creature\u2019s face seemed to\n> be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird\u2019s face with\n> a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and\n> battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.\n> The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his\n> own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed\n> inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt.\n\nThe final membrane between inner and outer is dissolving. 1984 can read like\nOrwell\u2019s reverse autobiography, in which, rather than a life being built up,\nit gets disassembled down to its foundational unit. The body is now wasting;\nthe voice is losing expressive competence. Worse, the face will soon enough\nhave nothing left to express, as the last of his adaptive neurocircuitry\nbecomes property of Oceania.\n\n1984 is Orwell saying goodbye to himself, and an improbably convincing\nportrait of the erasure of the autonomous individual. He finished typing the\nnovel by early December 1948. His final diary entry on Jura\u2014dated that\nChristmas Eve\u2014gave the weight of the Christmas goose \u201cbefore drawing &\nplucking,\u201d then concluded: \u201cSnowdrops up all over the place. A few tulips\nshowing. Some wall-flowers still trying to flower.\u201d The next month, he was\nback in a sanatorium; the next year, he was dead. He was 46 years old.\n\n1984 was published 75 years ago. Surprisingly, it immediately surpassed Animal\nFarm as a critical and commercial success. One by one, Orwell\u2019s\ncontemporaries\u2014V. S. Pritchett, Rebecca West, Bertrand Russell\u2014acknowledged\nits triumph. A rare dissenter was Evelyn Waugh, who wrote to Orwell to say\nthat he\u2019d found the book morally inert. \u201cYou deny the soul\u2019s existence (at\nleast Winston does) and can only contrast matter with reason & will.\u201d The\ntrials of its protagonist consequently failed to make Waugh\u2019s \u201cflesh creep.\u201d\nWhat, he implied, was at stake here?\n\nTalk about missing the point. Nowhere in Orwell\u2019s work can one find evidence\nof anything essential, much less eternal, that makes us human. That\u2019s why\nWinston, our meager proxy, is available for a thoroughgoing reboot. As the\nbook implies, we\u2019re creatures of contingency all the way down. Even a memory\nof a memory of freedom, autonomy, self-making, consciousness, and agency\u2014in a\nword, of ourselves\u2014can disappear, until no loss is felt whatsoever. Hence the\nterror of being \u201cthe last man\u201d: You\u2019re the living terminus, the lone bearer of\nwhat will be, soon enough, a dead language.\n\nA precious language, indicating a way of being in the world worth keeping\u2014if\nyou\u2019re George Orwell. From the evidence of Jura and 1984, persisting as his\nown catawampus self\u2014askew to the world\u2014was a habit he needed to prove he\ncouldn\u2019t possibly kick. He could be the far-off yet rooted man who loved being\na father; performing what he deemed \u201csane\u201d tasks, such as building a henhouse;\nindulging his grim compulsions (smoking tobacco and writing books). The soul,\neternal fabric of God, had no place in that equation.\n\nWaugh wasn\u2019t the only muddled reader of the book. In the aftermath of the\nBerlin blockade and the creation of NATO, followed by the Soviets\u2019 detonation\nof their first atomic weapon, readers\u2014Americans, especially\u2014might have been\neager for an anti-Stalinist bedtime story. But Orwell had already written an\nanti-Stalinist bedtime story. If his time on Jura tells us anything, it\u2019s that\nin 1984, he was exhorting us to beware of concentrated power and pay attention\nto public language, yes, but above all, guard your solitude against\ninterlopers, Stalinist or otherwise.\n\nIn addition to the book\u2019s top-down anxieties about the coming managerial\noverclass, a bottom-up anxiety about how fragile solitude is\u2014irreducible to an\nabstract right or a material good\u2014permeates 1984. Paradoxically, Winston\u2019s\nefforts to hold fast to the bliss of separateness are what give the book its\nunexpected turns of beauty and humanity. (\u201cThe sweet summer air played against\nhis cheek. From somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children:\nin the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock.\u201d)\nFor all of Orwell\u2019s intrepidness, his physical courage, his clarity of\nexpression, his most resolutely anti-fascist instinct lay here: in his terror\nat the thought of never being alone.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2024 print edition with the headline \u201cOrwell\u2019s\nEscape.\u201d\n\nOrwell\u2019s Island: George, Jura and \u20181984\u2019\n\nBy Les Wilson\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
