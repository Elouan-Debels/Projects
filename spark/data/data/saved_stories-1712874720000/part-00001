As Xaver noted in the\nmerge request:\n\n> \"Once the matching Xwayland and NVidia driver updates are out, most problems\n> with NVidia on Wayland will be gone.\"\n\nA few days earlier Xaver went on to note the importance of Wayland explicit\nsync support and especially around the NVIDIA proprietary driver benefits for\nimproving its Wayland support.\n\nAs of this afternoon the KWin explicit sync support in place for Plasma 6.1\ndue out in mid-June.\n\n53 Comments\n\nTweet\n\nRelated News\n\nKDE On The Importance Of Wayland Explicit Sync\n\nKDE Plasma 6 Can Now Sync Your RGB-Backlit Keyboard With Your Desktop's Accent\nColor\n\nKDE Introduces New Marknote App\n\nKDE Plasma 6 Refinements Continue, Fixes 3+ Important Crashes This Week\n\nKDE Sees A Number Of Regression Fixes & Some Crash Fixes This Week\n\nKDE Continuing To Land More Fixes, Eye More Features For Plasma 6.1\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
