As you create projects in Muddy and share apps, it will start using\nthat context as well to help answer questions and retrieve websites.\n\n### Can I use Slack and Muddy?\n\nYes, if you want to. For smaller teams you\u2019ll be much happier just using\nMuddy. If you work at a bigger company or depend on Slack Connect, we have a\nSlack app that automatically brings your stuff over and keeps you connected.\nLike any app, Slack also works inside of Muddy.\n\n### What apps does Muddy support?\n\nAnything that works inside of your browser today, which basically means\neverything. We support every modern browser dependency and API. There is one\nto one feature parity with anything you would expect apps and sites to support\nwith Chrome. Unlike many \u201cbrowsers\u201d there won\u2019t be any change in performance\nor behavior.\n\n### How does Muddy manage my privacy?\n\nAll your cookies and passwords are stored locally. We\u2019ll never your\ninformation because we monetize against selling add on services, not ads. Only\nthe things you explicitly share with others are accessible to them, and only\nthem.\n\n### Does opening all those apps make my computer slow?\n\nMuddy takes care of app and tab management for you! Because we know what\nspaces you\u2019re working in and what your team cares about at any given moment,\nwe\u2019re able to keep the most interesting files hot and turn off the rest when\nyou\u2019re done. When you return, everything loads up just as you left it.\n\n## Rescue your team from work about work\n\n\u00a9 2024 San Francisco Sailing Club\n\nXPrivacyTermsCookies\n\n", "frontpage": false}
