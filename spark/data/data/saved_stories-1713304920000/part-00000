Their remarkable victory matters for all workers.\n\nMolly Kinder\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nTV writer Jackie Penn | Photo credit: Phil Cheung\n\nApril 2024\n\nGrowing up in a working-class immigrant family in Queens, N.Y., Danny Tolli\ndreamed of a career in television. \u201cI was a storyteller straight out of the\nwomb,\u201d Tolli told me in November. After studying film and television at New\nYork University, he worked his way up in Hollywood, starting out as an\nassistant a decade ago and rising to a TV writer and co-executive producer\ntoday.\n\nUntil last year, Tolli\u2014like most of us\u2014never imagined that artificial\nintelligence might threaten his career. For decades, automation has\nconcentrated in the kinds of routine, blue-collar jobs he grew up around.\nHighly creative and cognitive roles\u2014like writing the stories that shape our\nculture\u2014were considered to have a low risk of disruption.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT 3.5 at the end of 2022 turned that paradigm on its\nhead. Seemingly overnight, the generative AI chatbot captured the public\u2019s\nattention by excelling at precisely the kinds of non-routine skills that have\nlong been considered quintessentially \u201chuman.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary...We were watching in real time how it was starting to generate\nideas, storylines, and scenes,\u201d said Tolli. He pointed to one of AI\u2019s defining\nfeatures: its rapid expected increase in capabilities. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing a great\njob [now], but ChatGPT 6 might do an even better job,\u201d he said.\n\n### Workers and AI: Voices from the front lines of disruption\n\nIn this ongoing series, Brookings Metro introduces you to workers in\noccupations that will likely face disruption from generative AI, including\nwriters, legal assistants, illustrators, accountants, and customer service\nrepresentatives.\n\nIn their own words, these workers will share what they feel is at stake as\nwell as the risks and opportunities AI presents. Their stories are accompanied\nby in-depth case studies exploring AI\u2019s effect on these industries and what\npolicymakers, employers, and each of us can do to enable workers to benefit\nfrom AI and avoid potential harm.\n\nHear from five Hollywood writers, in their own words \u00bb\n\nRead about the project \u00bb\n\nMeet the Hollywood writers: Danny Tolli, co-executive producer; Leah Folta, TV story editor; David Goodman, executive producer; Raphael Bob-Waksberg; Showrunner; Jackie Penn, TV writer | Photo credit: Phil Cheung and David Walter Banks\n\nFor the first time, Tolli worried that Hollywood studios would use the new\ntechnology to replace writers and destroy the ladder he had been climbing. A\nlot was suddenly at stake: a career he felt he was born to do, the economic\nsecurity that eluded his parents, and the kind of American Dream that had long\nbeen possible for successful Hollywood writers. Also at stake was the greater\ndiversity and inclusion reflected in the newest generation of Hollywood\nwriters, and the kinds of stories they could tell.\n\nAs Tolli\u2019s fears grew, his union, the Writers Guild of America West, was in\nthe middle of negotiating a three-year contract with the biggest studios in\nHollywood. In just a matter of months, AI\u2019s potential threat shot from\nobscurity to rallying cry for Tolli and thousands of fellow writers who went\non strike in spring 2023. Among their list of demands were protections from\nAI\u2014protections they won after a grueling five-month strike.\n\nThe contract the Guild secured in September set a historic precedent: It is up\nto the writers whether and how they use generative AI as a tool to assist and\ncomplement\u2014not replace\u2014them. Ultimately, if generative AI is used, the\ncontract stipulates that writers get full credit and compensation. The victory\nwas important for Tolli, but its implications reverberate far beyond\nHollywood.\n\nReflecting on the strike, Tolli said:\n\n> With AI a central issue in our contract negotiation, we felt very much like\n> the canary in the coal mine. That we were announcing to all workers and\n> union members across the country that if these studios are going to use\n> automation to replace screenwriters, what\u2019s stopping them from taking your\n> jobs?\n\nOver the past several months, I interviewed Tolli and other Hollywood writers\nto document their fears and aspirations surrounding generative AI\u2019s impact on\ntheir careers, and capture their stories from the front lines of this issue.\n(You can read more of their stories here.)\n\n### Table of contents\n\nHollywood writing: A coveted career under strain from technology-driven shifts\n\u00bb\n\nGenerative AI: What is at stake for Hollywood writers \u00bb\n\nGenerative AI: What is at stake for society \u00bb\n\nThe labor strike and groundbreaking contract: What was achieved\u2014and how \u00bb\n\nLessons for other unions and workers in industries poised for AI disruption \u00bb\n\nThis report explores what is at stake for both writers and our society, what\nthese writers were able to achieve in their contract negotiations, and what we\ncan learn from this experience in terms of shaping the way AI is deployed in\nour economy. That Hollywood writers became the first and most visible face of\nresistance to generative AI speaks volumes about the nature of this new\ntechnology and the kinds of livelihoods that it will impact most. Their\nvictory in securing first-of-their-kind protections offers important lessons\nfor other unions and professional organizations, policymakers, and workers\nacross a range of occupations who may face similar disruptions to their\ncareers.\n\nDanny Tolli, co-executive producer | Photo credit: Philip Cheung\n\n## Hollywood writing: A coveted career under strain from technology-driven\nshifts\n\nA successful career writing in Hollywood has many hallmarks of a \u201cdream\u201d job:\ncoveted, well paid, and exciting. Writing jobs in Hollywood are highly sought\nafter and extremely competitive, if also unpredictable.\n\nLeah Folta, a TV writer and story editor, reflected on the personal\nsignificance of her craft:\n\n> I love writing. I love all of it: the producing, the collaborating in the\n> room, the way you get to exercise the muscles that we have in production and\n> making sure things are executed the way you want. It is such a huge gift and\n> so much fun. I don\u2019t have a backup career, because I never wanted any.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, writers and authors in the motion\npicture and video industry earned an average annual wage of $136,690 in 2022,\ncompared to an average of $61,900 for all job occupations in our economy. But\npay varies widely by seniority and role, and Hollywood writers operate like\nindependent contractors, seeking TV employment seasonally and selling movie\nscripts in a freelance fashion. Writers contend with rejected scripts,\ncanceled shows, and periods of unemployment.\n\nMinimum pay for Hollywood writers is negotiated by the union: the East and\nWest branches of the Writers Guild of America (WGA). The WGA represents\napproximately 11,500 TV and movie writers and bargains on the sector\nlevel\u2014meaning with all the major studios as a group, not company by\ncompany\u2014through the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n(AMPTP). The AMPTP represents more than 350 film and television producers,\nincluding major studios such as Amazon, Apple, Discovery, Disney,\nNBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony, and Warner Bros. Discovery. The WGA\nnegotiates three-year contracts with the AMPTP that stipulate base\ncompensation, staffing, residuals (when a show or film is reused), and other\nterms of employment for their members.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works, starting with feature films as an example. Feature film\nwriters are compensated based on the product, type of writing, and budget of\nthe film. The highest minimum pay of just over $160,000 is for an original\nscreenplay for a high-budget film, and just over half this amount for a low-\nbudget film. The lowest minimum payments are for \u201cpolishes\u201d (which are less\nextensive than a full script rewrite) and for having a story (a summary of a\nfilm idea, but not a full script) included in a screenplay. Established\nscreenwriters can command compensation that substantially exceeds these\nminimums rates.\n\nWriting staff on TV shows are paid a weekly rate, by role, for a set number of\nweeks corresponding to a show\u2019s season. The lowest-paid writer in the\nunion\u2014the staff writer\u2014earns a minimum of $4,362 per week before fees and\ntaxes. A writer-producer could earn about twice as much, and higher-ranked\nroles earn even more.\n\nWhile early-career writers may struggle to make ends meet, traditionally, the\nmost senior writers who have ascended the career ladder in film and television\nhave been well compensated.\n\nDavid A. Goodman, a TV writer with 35 years of experience and credits that\ninclude executive producer of \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d underscored the arc of his good\nfortune when compared to that of the single parent who raised him on a modest\nincome.\n\n> Certainly, when I entered the business [in 1988], if you could establish\n> yourself as a writer in Hollywood, it led to a comfortable lifestyle. The\n> pay was good. If you could continue to get work, you would get promotions\n> and pay increases. It allowed me to have a life that was a much more\n> comfortable one than I had a child. I was raised by a single mom who was a\n> social worker in New York...There was a lot of financial anxiety in my\n> family.\n\nGoodman\u2019s career allowed him to buy a home in Los Angeles, send his children\nto private school, take annual vacations, financially support struggling\nfamily members, and consistently pay his bills. He credited the WGA with\nenabling his longevity in the industry and providing stability during cyclical\nperiods of financial difficulty.\n\nIn addition to union-provided health insurance and retirement benefits,\nGoodman cited the importance of residuals, which the union championed in\nsuccessive contracts. Residuals are financial compensation paid out when a TV\nshow or film is \u201creused,\u201d such as through syndication, cable reruns, or\nlicensing to a streaming platform. Goodman said that during periods of\nunemployment after a canceled shows or between seasons, residual checks would\noccasionally appear in the mail and help him keep his family afloat and\ncontinue to pay his bills until he was able to secure his next writing job.\n\n### Disruptions from the advent of streaming\n\nOver the past two decades, the stability and compensation that have defined\nthe careers of established writers like David A. Goodman have been eroded by\ndisruptions from the advent of streaming, which now accounts for about half of\nTV writing employment.\n\nCompared to traditional network TV, the streaming platforms such as Netflix\nand Amazon Prime Video typically offer writers fewer episodes per season,\nfewer weeks of employment, smaller paychecks, less financial reward through\nresidual payments when shows are successful, and smaller writers\u2019 rooms with\nfewer jobs. Pay has eroded: In recent years, half of TV writers earned the\nminimum compensation as laid out in the union agreement, up from one-third of\nwriters in the 2013-14 season.\n\nDuring the height of network TV, a show like \u201cSeinfeld\u201d would air 22 episodes\nper season and provide upward of 40 weeks of work for writers. In comparison,\na popular streaming show like \u201cBridgerton\u201d airs just eight episodes per season\nand provides fewer weeks of employment for writers.\n\nIn addition to fewer weeks of guaranteed employment, streaming platforms have\nalso shrunk the number of writers hired for many shows. TV writers in\nHollywood typically work collaboratively in a \u201cwriters\u2019 room,\u201d which can vary\nin size from two to 20 writers. While a dozen writers staffing a writing room\nwas common in the era of broadcast television, studios today have downsized,\nand some have introduced \u201cmini-rooms\u201d with just three or four writers.\n\nFinally, the pivot toward streaming has disrupted the model of residual\ncompensation. Popular shows and films that are \u201creused\u201d provide writers a\nsource of sporadic payment through residual checks\u2014an important source of\nfinancial stability for writers between jobs, and representing a share of the\nfinancial success of their shows. The business model of streaming disrupted\nthe residuals model, as streaming platforms can keep a film or show on their\nplatform indefinitely and not license or sell the episodes\u2014undermining a key\nsource of stability and compensation for writers.\n\nThese changes have impacted writers at all levels (especially newer writers),\nand increased barriers to steady employment and a comfortable living. These\ndisruptions have coincided with mounting headwinds facing the industry,\nincluding cost-cutting pressure from investors in streaming platforms who are\npushing a shift from focusing mainly on subscriber growth to achieving\nprofitability, as well as increasing competition for moviegoing audiences from\nat-home entertainment (including streaming) and social media.\n\nLeah Folta, TV story editor | Photo credit: Philip Cheung\n\n## Generative AI: What is at stake for Hollywood writers\n\nAgainst this backdrop of technology-driven shifts from the advent of\nstreaming, the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022 ushered in a substantial\nnew source of technological disruption\u2014and anxiety\u2014for writers in Hollywood.\n\nChatGPT popularized \u201cgenerative artificial intelligence\u201d\u2014a type of machine\nlearning. Generative AI works as an algorithm that can produce a wide range of\nnew content, including creative content such as images, music, text, audio,\nand video. The technology is enabled by large language models (LLMs) that\ntrain on vast data sets, detecting statistical patterns and structures that it\nthen uses to generate new content. For example, generative AI can train on\nthousands of existing TV or movie scripts to produce scripts based on ideas,\ndialogue, types of characters, and even plot developments that appear to work\nwell together. This is the \u201cgenerative\u201d in generative AI: It creates, often\nwith astonishing speed.\n\nZooming out from screenwriting to consider the job economy as a whole,\ngenerative AI\u2019s capabilities represent a sharp departure from previous\ntechnologies. For decades, technology has been \u201cskill-biased\u201d: it has\nsubstituted for routine skills (such as calculating expenses, filing\ndocuments, or connecting parts of a vehicle on the assembly line), and\ncomplemented non-routine skills (such as managerial decisionmaking, complex\nanalysis, and the use of human creativity).\n\nTake law firms, for example. In recent decades, skill-biased digital\ntechnologies have substituted for some of the routine work legal secretaries\nperform, such as typing, filing, and transcribing. On the other hand, the\ntechnologies have complemented the skills of the lawyer through better tools\nfor legal research and communication, leading to a sizable reduction in the\nratio of legal secretaries to lawyers.\n\nPreviously, the legal industry was forecasted to have among the lowest risks\nof automation. In a widely cited 2013 paper, Oxford academics Carl Benedikt\nFrey and Michael Osbourne noted the low projected automation risk for lawyers:\n\n> For example, we find that paralegals and legal assistants\u2014for which\n> computers already substitute\u2014in the high risk category. At the same time,\n> lawyers, which rely on labour input from legal assistants, are in the low\n> risk category. Thus, for the work of lawyers to be fully automated,\n> engineering bottlenecks to creative and social intelligence will need to be\n> overcome, implying that the computerisation of legal research will\n> complement the work of lawyers in the medium term.\n\nChatGPT upends this paradigm. Generative AI has excelled at many of the non-\nroutine skills that just a few years ago experts considered impossible for\ncomputers to perform, including creativity and empathy.\n\nConsider law again. Today, the legal industry is among those with the highest\nexposure to AI. In 2023, ChatGPT 4 made headlines by passing the bar exam with\na score higher than 90% of human test- takers. According to a forthcoming\nBrookings Metro analysis of data from OpenAI, lawyers could harness existing\ngenerative AI technology to save at least half the time on more than 80% of\ntheir core tasks, including conducting legal research, preparing briefs and\nopinions, and reviewing legal documents.\n\nThe emerging capabilities of generative AI will have a similar impact on\ncreative industries. As discussed above, until recently, technology was\nconsidered a complement, not a substitute in creative fields such as writing.\nWhile a writer might have used a computer to format or spellcheck a document,\nthe imagination, creativity, and writing skills underpinning storytelling have\nlong been considered uniquely \u201chuman\u201d and at low risk of automation. But as\ngenerative AI advances, this is no longer true. In a forthcoming Brookings\nanalysis, my colleague Mark Muro uses data from OpenAI to forecast that\nwriters and authors are 100% exposed to generative AI (the highest possible\nexposure score), while poets, lyricists, and creative writers are 88% exposed.\nThose figures mean that using generative AI could save at least half the time\nspent on 100% or 88% of those occupations\u2019 tasks, respectively, as they are\ndefined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for all occupations.\n\nSo, what will this mean for \u201cAI-exposed\u201d workers such as screenwriters and\nlawyers? It\u2019s not yet clear, but we can outline some possibilities. A high AI\nexposure score does not necessarily mean that a job will be automated or\ndisplaced. It could also mean the job might be augmented by making workers in\nthose roles more productive, more capable, more creative, or more efficient as\nthey carry out tasks. For instance, an advertiser using generative AI might be\nable to create highly personalized ads, while an architect could instantly\nbuild a model for a client.\n\nWhether AI will augment or automate\u2014and whether and how much workers benefit\nfrom those gains\u2014is not preordained. It depends on the choices of consumers,\ninvestors, employers, and technologists; the capabilities of the technology;\nthe demand for workers\u2019 skills; and the existence\u2014or lack\u2014of guardrails to\nprotect workers.\n\n### The potential to augment the work of screenwriters\n\nFor some writers, generative AI may present the possibility of assisting them\nin the development of scripts and with the daily activities associated with\nthe job. Generative AI might help writers brainstorm plot ideas, draft\ndialogue, spark new ideas, write outlines, conduct research, create\ncharacters, summarize notes, or think of new plot twists. Generative AI might\nalso expedite tasks that writers consider time-consuming or tedious. For\ninstance, a writer who doesn\u2019t enjoy writing summaries might leverage\ngenerative AI to assist and save time.\n\nFor highly creative and talented Hollywood writers, the emerging scholarly\nevidence suggests limits to these benefits, and even potential threats.\nSeveral recent studies document that generative AI\u2019s biggest gains benefit\nless skilled and creative writers, essentially \u201cleveling the playing field.\u201d\nFor instance, a 2023 paper by Anil R. Doshi and Oliver Hauser found that while\ngenerative AI did not measurably enhance the creativity of already highly\ncreative writers, it did improve the writing of participants who were less\ncreative, leveling out differences between the two tiers. These findings\nsuggest it may not be the most capable and experienced professional writers\nwho benefit most from the technology, but rather less experienced or less\ntalented amateur writers who might harness AI to create scripts that are\ncloser in quality to those written by highly skilled, seasoned professionals.\n\n### The potential to replace writers\n\nConscious of how relentlessly companies can focus on cutting costs, including\nlabor costs, to drive up profits, Hollywood writers have reacted with\nskepticism that studios will use AI as a tool to enhance their creativity and\njob quality. Instead, there is widespread fear that studios will use it mainly\nto replace writers and maximize profits, even at the expense of the quality of\nthe work.\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg, the creator and showrunner for BoJack Horseman,\nexplained this concern::\n\n> If you were to take a technology like this and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to give\n> this to artists and make their lives easier and make their artistic power\n> even greater,\u2019 I would say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s really interesting.\u2019 But I don\u2019t\n> trust the companies to do that...When you look at the larger applications of\n> these technologies, companies and studios never want to use it to empower\n> artists to make cooler stuff for the same amount of money. They want to make\n> things cheaper, cut the artists out, pay people less, and use these\n> technologies in a way that doesn\u2019t make the work better.\n\nWhile current versions of generative AI software can now autonomously generate\nan entire script, the quality is still rudimentary. This has provided little\ncomfort to David A. Goodman, who expressed grave concerns about the potential\nthreats to writers\u2019 livelihoods as the technology improves:\n\n> In the long term, as this technology improves, I don\u2019t think there are any\n> limits to what it might be able to do. My imagination is limited, but I am\n> experienced enough to know that just because I can\u2019t imagine something,\n> doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. I do feel that this technology is impressive.\n> At some point it could literally generate what are seemingly original\n> scripts...It\u2019s very scary. As soon as the companies can get rid of writers,\n> they will.\n\nIn the nearer term, one major concern for Hollywood writers centers on\ntruncating creative human work: Some TV writers fear that studios\u2019 use of\ngenerative AI for drafting scripts could eliminate the writers\u2019 room,\neffectively wiping out most TV writing jobs. Specifically, studios may develop\nthe technical capacity to replace some writing jobs by generating first drafts\nof scripts with AI using their own copyrighted material. For instance, a\nstudio that has a long-running procedural show with established characters and\na formulaic storytelling style\u2014like \u201cLaw and Order\u201d or a vault of princess\nmovies and superhero franchises\u2014could train an AI model on its existing\nscripts and generate a first draft of a new episode or film.\n\n### The potential to degrade jobs and exacerbate financial insecurity\n\nOn top of possible job losses, another concern is that studios\u2019 use of AI\ncould transform and degrade the writing jobs that remain. Many writers fear\nthat as studios use generative AI to create the first draft of TV or movie\nscripts, the few writers they hire will only polish and edit those AI-\ngenerated drafts\u2014with sweeping consequences not only for the number of jobs,\nbut for writers\u2019 compensation and the nature and quality of their work.\nFundamentally, the writing role could shift from writing and creating original\nideas to editing AI-generated scripts, with less creative input and\nsignificantly less pay.\n\nDanny Tolli noted:\n\n> A big concern for me is AI generating ideas and scripts, and writers only\n> being hired for polishing and rewrites. We won\u2019t be writers anymore. It is\n> quite depressing and scary...Basically, we just become gig workers in an\n> industry where we were an instrumental part of creating the product. It\u2019s\n> like the Uber-fication of Hollywood.\n\nWriters have a lot at stake financially from these shifts. In films, a rewrite\nof a screenplay commands just over one-quarter of the minimum payment for\nwriting an original screenplay. In TV, the guaranteed employment of writers\u2019\nrooms could be replaced with just a few days or weeks of work for a writer to\nrewrite a script, at a fraction of the pay.\n\nFewer weeks of employment and smaller paychecks would make it much more\ndifficult for writers to support themselves\u2014upending what is currently a\nfinancially viable career for many people and putting pressure on them to\ncobble together more jobs to make ends meet. Less reliable employment would\nalso make it more difficult for writers to qualify for union-provided health\ninsurance and limit their retirement contributions, further undermining\nfinancial stability. Ultimately, as writers face increased barriers to secure\nemployment and financial stability, fewer writers\u2014especially newer writers\u2014may\nfind they are able to continue in the profession.\n\n### The potential to undermine the career ladder for newer writers\n\nIf the use of generative AI results in smaller writers\u2019 rooms or eliminates\nthem altogether, it would upend the structured career ladder that has defined\nTV writing in Hollywood for decades. Historically, if writers secured roles in\nsuccessive seasons or on new shows, they typically ascended the following\nhierarchy and gained valuable experience, mentorship, credits, and on-the-job\ntraining via each successive role, in one of the most successful\napprenticeship systems in our economy.\n\nTV writing career ladder\n\nSource: WGAW, Medium Filmarket Club, and Screencraft\n\nIn addition to the roles above, which are represented by the WGA, TV writing\nis also supported by entry-level roles such as writers\u2019 assistants and\npersonal assistants, which often provide a springboard to staff writing\npositions with union representation.\n\nAn animating concern for many Hollywood writers is the fear that studios\u2019 use\nof generative AI to draft scripts could wipe out the writers\u2019 room\u2014and with\nit, the career ladder and opportunities for newer writers. Danny Tolli\nexplained this concern:\n\n> AI is going to completely destroy the ladder to get to be a showrunner. You\n> are completely wiping out the career trajectory. You\u2019re essentially saying\n> that showrunners will be the only ones working. We\u2019re not going to be\n> training the future generation. If the younger generation is not getting the\n> necessary experience, there is no way the company is going to give a\n> showrunning opportunity to a writer who has no credits on their resume.\n\nThe use of generative AI to automate administrative tasks could also undermine\ncareer advancement for aspiring writers. Proponents often tout the\nproductivity benefits of generative AI taking over routine tasks and \u201cfreeing\nup\u201d workers to shift to more strategic, analytical, creative, and\ninterpersonal work. In Hollywood, however, entry-level administrative roles\nare valuable starting points that enable aspiring writers to get a foothold in\nthe industry and gain critical experience. Tasks that might seem like\n\u201cdrudgery\u201d and ripe for automation\u2014taking meeting notes, tweaking scripts,\ntranscribing edits\u2014are instrumental to an early-career writer\u2019s ability to\nhone skills, build a network, get mentored, and learn the inner workings of\nthe industry task by task and project by project.\n\nDavid Goodman, executive producer | Photo credit: David Walter Banks\n\n## Generative AI: What is at stake for society\n\nThe use of generative AI in scriptwriting raises many issues for society, from\nethical concerns to questions of who gets to tell the stories that define our\nculture, what kinds of stories are ultimately told or not told, and their\nquality and impact.\n\n### Diversity and the stories that are told\n\nThe use of generative AI in Hollywood scriptwriting could undermine the recent\nprogress made in Hollywood to diversify the ranks of its storytellers. Since\nHollywood started making movies, the writers it has hired to tell stories have\nreflected a narrow demographic, with white men dominating the industry. Even\nas recently as 2022, nearly 60% of all showrunners (the top TV writing\nposition) were white men.\n\nOver the last decade, and particularly after the racial reckoning following\nGeorge Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, the industry made a push for more inclusive\nhiring to strengthen the diversity in its ranks. These shifts reflect a\ngrowing awareness of the impact of diversity on the types of stories that are\ntold, the perspectives and communities that are reflected, and how viewers see\nthemselves and the world around them as a result.\n\nThus far, these efforts are mainly visible in the lower rungs of the writing\nprofession, reflecting the greater diversity of new hires over the past\ndecade. For instance, the percent of new hires that identify as women, BIPOC,\ndisabled, or LGBTQ+ increased substantially in the past five years. The\ncontrast between entry-level roles and the most senior is stark: Over 80% of\nentry-level staff writers were women and people of color in 2020, compared to\nonly about one-third of executive producers.\n\nChange in diversity of TV writers, 2011\u20132020\n\nSource: Writers Guild of America West\n\nTo the extent that studios\u2019 deployment of generative AI reduces the size of\nwriting rooms, many writers fear it will undermine this progress by putting\ndiverse, entry-level writers at greatest risk.\n\nListen to the writer's own words\n\nIf [AI] was used as an excuse to cut down on anybody\u2019s jobs, I know it's the\nlower- and mid-level writers that we\u2019re already seeing cut out of rooms who\nwould be further at risk. If you are losing the people who are newer to the\nindustry, you\u2019re going to disproportionately be harming the diversity of the\nindustry in a situation that is already nowhere near as diverse as the\npopulation of the country.\n\nLeah Folta | TV story editor\n\nGenerative AI-drafted scripts also risk reinforcing existing biases and the\nlack of diversity in Hollywood\u2019s past writing. TV writer Jackie Penn raised\nher concern that training AI models on existing scripts could marginalize the\nvoices of diverse writers and the perspectives of different communities.\n\nListen to the writer's own words\n\nI think it\u2019s very interesting because the things that are being put for the AI\nto use, you have to go from existing material at this point. As a Black woman,\nI'm like, okay, where are we pulling this from? Who is your frame of\nreference? Are you looking at women? Are you looking at Black writers? Are you\nlooking at Latino writers? In my work, I'm really trying to include other, you\nknow, people from different walks of life, different lived experiences. If I'm\nthinking about that as a writer, as a human, like, how are we going to make\nsure that that's what the generative AI is doing?\n\nJackie Penn | TV writer\n\n### Societal concerns about the quality of AI art\n\nThe specter of AI creating movie scripts\u2014along with other forms art and\nculture\u2014raises existential and ethical questions for society. If creativity is\n\u201can expression of our humanity,\u201d what will it mean for society if stories are\ngenerated by a computer? What will it mean for society if AI makes it harder\nfor artists and writers to earn a living, and many stop doing so?\n\nEchoing concerns from prominent authors and creatives, some Hollywood writers\nhave raised ethical concerns over the training of large language models on the\n(often copyrighted) works of artists, without consent or\ncompensation\u2014threatening their livelihoods in the process. Screenwriter Cheryl\nGuerriero told me that it feels like plagiarism to her, and she doesn\u2019t\nunderstand how it can be allowed.\n\nAnother key concern for society is whether AI-generated writing and art will\nbe any good. This is especially pertinent to the use of AI for writing in\nHollywood; the industry\u2019s movies and shows are consumed by billions of people\naround the world and have an outsize cultural influence.\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg raised concerns that AI will lead to what economists\nDaron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo call \u201cso-so technology\u201d\u2014i.e., advances\nthat do not enhance quality or productivity, but negatively impact jobs:\n\n> I love TV, I love movies, I love stories, I love good writing. I want there\n> to be more good stuff and less bad stuff. And when I look at AI-generated\n> art, it isn\u2019t very good. I worry that it could get good enough and close\n> enough that it drowns out the marketplace, and it is cheap enough that the\n> companies rely on it more and more in a way that makes it not feasible for\n> actual writers and artists to be paid to create stuff. I just think we\u2019ll be\n> so much worse off as a culture for that...I think stories are good because\n> people have observations about life that they\u2019re trying to express, not\n> because they\u2019re running through a series of language tricks they know make\n> for digestible sentences.\n\nFor many writers, the inspiration for their characters or stories comes from\npersonal experience: from real people in their lives, from emotions they have\nfelt, from experiences that gave them unique human insights that they can\nconnect to an audience. Some have questioned whether a computer can give a\nstory emotions as effectively as humans can. David A. Goodman reflected on\nthis potential loss of connection when AI writes stories.\n\nListen to the writer's own words\n\nYou lose the perspective of an individual artist who has something to say. If\nit is just a machine churning out the illusion of a story, the illusion of a\npoint, you are losing that connection between an artist and an audience. And\nthen you\u2019re just making the equivalent of cheeseburgers.\n\nDavid Goodman | Executive producer\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg, Showrunner | Photo credit: Philip Cheung\n\n## The labor strike and groundbreaking contract: What was achieved\u2014and how\n\nThe Writers Guild of America\u2019s victory in securing historic protections from\nAI in its 2023 contract was in many ways an unlikely success story.\n\nAt the end of 2022, when the WGA leadership first began setting priorities for\nthe negotiation of the next three-year contract, the issue of generative AI\nwas not even on the list. While a few forward-looking board members were vocal\nabout their AI concerns, early on, the union\u2019s priorities centered on bread-\nand-butter issues such as minimum payments, residuals, and staffing size.\n\nThat changed abruptly by early 2023, as awareness of ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities\nspread following its release. David A. Goodman, who served as a co-chair of\nthe union\u2019s negotiation committee during the 2023 strike and is a past\npresident of the WGA, described how in just a matter of months, AI rose from\nbeing almost completely off their radar to one of the most important issues\nfor their membership:\n\n> It was during that negotiation process in the late winter and early spring\n> [2023] that we really started to realize this was something we were going to\n> have to deal with in this negotiation right away. It all happened very\n> quickly...[ChatGPT] entered the zeitgeist in a way that writers themselves\n> became aware of it. Suddenly it went from nobody talking about it to\n> everyone talking about it. People started using ChatGPT in casual ways and\n> were just so impressed by it. Then people with imagination recognized, \u2018Wait\n> a second, if this gets better, can this actually replace writers? Can the\n> companies use this to generate scripts that are good enough to produce and\n> cut writers out of the process entirely?\u2019 That was the fear. And it\n> snowballed in such a way that whether this was a possibility in the short\n> term or not didn\u2019t matter. People\u2019s imaginations saw this. The people\n> working on ChatGPT were adding to that by touting, \u2018This thing you\u2019re seeing\n> now, it\u2019s not even half as good as the next generation.\u2019 That made things\n> even more dire from a writer\u2019s point of view.\n\nGoodman credited the union\u2019s leadership for their adaptability in quickly\nfiguring out what specific AI-related priorities to include in the\nnegotiations, which were already underway. In May, the WGA proposed several AI\nregulations, including that AI can\u2019t \u201cwrite or rewrite literary material,\ncan\u2019t be used as source material, and MBA [minimum basic agreement] covered\nmaterial can\u2019t be used to train AI.\u201d\n\nInitially, Goodman said the union leadership assumed AI was not yet an\nimmediate risk to their careers, but they needed to build guardrails into the\ncontract for the future. This perception shifted when the alliance of studios\n(the AMPTP) categorically rejected the WGA\u2019s proposed regulations and\ncountered with annual meetings to \u201cdiscuss\u201d advancements in technology.\n\nBy law, the AMPTP had the right to refuse to bargain over the use of a\ntechnology like AI\u2014an authority due to federal labor law\u2019s designation of\ntechnology as an issue of \u201cmanagerial prerogative\u201d outside the required\npurview of collective bargaining. For months, the studios refused to come to\nthe table to discuss AI.\n\nWhile within their legal purview, the studios\u2019 refusal to bargain over AI may\nhave been a strategic misstep, which several studio executives later\nacknowledged. Their resistance sent a worrying signal to the writers about\nstudios\u2019 near-term intentions with AI and created solidarity among the\nwriters\u2014elevating the stakes of the negotiation from immediate concerns about\ncompensation and staffing sizes to a new and existential threat to writers\u2019\nlivelihoods.\n\n### A 148-day strike\n\nIn spring 2023, negotiations between the WGA and the AMPTP broke down. Nearly\nunanimously, guild members voted to authorize a strike, which began on May 2.\n\nDuring the grueling, five-month strike, the existential threats posed by AI\nand streaming were a uniting issue writers rallied around through months of\nfinancial hardship and outdoor picketing during a record heat wave.\n\nLeah Folta described the immense physical and mental toll of the strike:\n\n> I had no idea how hard it was to be on strike. It\u2019s insanely difficult...The\n> first month especially was such an emotional roller coaster. I know that in\n> the version we had, everyone was very united. Everybody in our union and in\n> our industry was united and on our side. The public was on our side. The\n> majority of the press was on our side. And still, it was so hard. It is\n> mentally and physically grueling. I had all of these background worries\u2014I\n> was one of the people whose health insurance was due to run out. June 30 was\n> my deadline to make more money or lose my health insurance, and we started\n> the strike in the beginning of May. I\u2019m running out of money. Everyone\n> around me is running out of money. It was scary and uncomfortable.\n\nDespite the challenges of financial stress, uncertainty about the future, and\npicketing in the extreme heat, Folta said that the writers stayed united\nbecause the stakes were so high: \u201cIt was this existential, and this bad.\u201d\n\nJackie Penn elaborated on the stakes:\n\n> Striking was one of the hardest things I have ever done. We showed up every\n> day to show not only the companies, but the entire country, that we were\n> really serious about these concerns to our livelihood...Being a writer is\n> very hard already when you are trying to get compensated for your work. With\n> AI potentially taking away jobs from writers, I think it was really\n> important we fought to make sure we are in charge of how we use it, or if we\n> use it, and not for it to be imposed on us. Our contract is only up every\n> three years. It was important we held the line because of how things are\n> going to develop with AI. Three years would have been too late.\n\nAs the strike wore on through the hot summer, the writers were buoyed by the\npresence of other workers from the entertainment industry who joined them on\nthe picket line, including behind-the-scenes workers from the Teamsters and\nInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). On July 13, the\nScreen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-\nAFTRA) announced their own strike\u2014the first time that writers and actors had\nsimultaneously gone on strike since 1960.\n\nThe overlapping strikes brought heightened public attention to the plight of\nthe actors and writers, raising the visibility of their shared concerns from\nresiduals and compensation to the existential threats from AI and streaming.\nThe strikes drove extensive media coverage: According to our search of\nMeltwater\u2019s media tracking platform, more than 18,000 media stories were\nwritten about the writers\u2019 strike between May and September. The actors\u2019\nstrike further shut down Hollywood production and ratcheted up financial\npressure on the studios, while drawing public attention as the filming of\npopular shows and movies was halted and highly anticipated film releases were\ndelayed.\n\nAfter months of impasse, momentum finally shifted in mid-September, when\nstudio bosses and labor leadership met in person for the first time. In an\nunusual move, four studio CEOs attended the multi-day meetings at the WGA\nheadquarters beginning on September 20. The presence of executives such as\nDisney CEO Bob Iger and Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav reflected a\nnew urgency to reach a deal and mounting financial pressure on the companies.\nThe intensive negotiations yielded breakthrough progress, and a tentative deal\nwas announced within days.\n\n### A historic contract with new guardrails on AI\n\nAfter 148 days, the second-longest strike in the WGA\u2019s history ended on\nSeptember 26, 2023. The contract was heralded widely as a major victory for\nthe writers. It includes significant concessions along all the key pillars of\nthe negotiation, including residual payments, minimum staffing, compensation,\nand benefits.\n\nBut the contract also includes far-reaching guardrails on generative AI\u2014the\nfirst of their kind for any collective bargaining agreement. The contract does\nnot outright ban the use of generative AI, but rather, regulates its use in\nways that could benefit writers and studios and reduce harms.\n\nThe contract explicitly spells out that AI is not itself a writer competing\nwith humans, but rather a tool for writers\u2019 beneficial use. To the extent that\nAI is used, the regulations specify that AI should complement the work of\nwriters instead of replacing them. The contract permits studios and writers to\nuse generative AI under specific circumstances, but with guardrails that\nprotect writers\u2019 employment, credit, and creative control, while also\nprotecting the studios\u2019 copyright.\n\nMore specifically, the 2023 contract includes the following AI regulations:\n\n  * AI is not a writer. The contract specifies that \u201cneither traditional AI nor GAI [generative AI] is a person, neither is a \u2018writer\u2019 or \u2018professional writer\u2019...and, therefore, written material produced by traditional AI or GAI shall not be considered literary material\u201d\u2014i.e., written products that writers create, including stories, treatments, and screenplays. The implication of this is that only writers will be given credit for writing, even if generative AI is used; generative AI itself cannot be credited with authoring original material. This is an important win for writers, and also helpful to studios to safeguard their copyright.\n\n  * Writers have agency: They can choose to use generative AI in their writing process, but cannot be forced to do so by the studios. The contract specifies that writers can use generative AI with the company\u2019s consent, but \u201ca Company may not require a writer to use ChatGPT to write literary material.\u201d\n  * Under certain terms, studios can provide writers with an AI-generated draft, but it does not count as \u201csource material\u201d\u2014meaning writers get full credit and compensation for originating the idea. This set of guardrails addresses writers\u2019 concern that studios\u2019 use of AI-generated drafts will undercut their compensation and credit. (A rewrite of a draft, for instance, commands just over one-quarter of the minimum compensation for drafting an original screenplay, while a \u201cpolish\u201d is paid even less.) The contract stipulates that writers will get the same credits and compensation for working off an AI-generated draft provided by the studio as they would if they came up with it as an original idea and written it from scratch.\n  * Studios can set AI policies and reject the use of AI when it undermines copyright. This regulation allows companies to determine AI policies and addresses studios\u2019 concerns about the potential for AI to infringe on their copyright or intellectual property, as well as other concerns related to ethics, privacy, and security.\n  * The specific terms of the use of copyrighted material to train AI models remain unresolved. Writers reserve the right to prohibit the training of generative AI with their written work. This clause addresses writers\u2019 concern about studios\u2019 training their AI models on screenplays and scripts that writers have authored, but whose copyright is owned by the studios. The contract does not adjudicate this concern, but preserves the studios\u2019 and union\u2019s right to negotiate over these legal and regulatory issues in the future.\n\nWhile the safeguards and regulations are designed to benefit writers and\nstudios, society and future viewers may also win. The contract creates\nincentives for writers to experiment with generative AI on their own terms,\nfind use cases that are helpful to their writing process, and improve the\nquality of the output, while ensuring that the writers share in the benefits\nof those gains. At the same time, the contract disincentivizes studios from\ncutting costs by turning to AI to generate poor-quality drafts. Because the\ncontract stipulates that studios pay writers the same compensation if they\nwork off an AI draft provided by the studios or if they write the script from\nscratch, studios are incentivized to use generative AI when it might improve\nthe end product, but not simply as a means to cut labor costs at the expense\nof quality.\n\n### Key ingredients for success\n\nThe writers\u2019 success was bolstered by numerous factors:\n\n  1. Solidarity with other unions, and the simultaneous actors\u2019 strike. The striking writers were buoyed by strong support from other unions that spanned markedly different industries. In addition to solidarity with SAG-AFTRA members, the writers benefitted from solidarity and support from other local unions in the entertainment industry, including the crew union IATSE and the Teamsters Local 399, whose members were involved in coordinated actions to shut down Hollywood productions. The writers were also aided by vocal support from the biggest unions in the country, including the AFL-CIO, and by workers representing a diverse cross-section of society: teachers, nurses, hotel workers, Starbucks baristas, and other union members all joined the picket line.\n\nListen to the writer's own words\n\nI think that that was something that came out of the strike and continues to\nlive on post-strike: This immense amount of solidarity, not just with [other]\nwriters, but with actors who are currently still on strike, with other crew\nmembers, with directors, with other union workers. We were still on strike\nwhen the UAW [United Auto Workers] began their strike. People out in Detroit\n[were] saying, \u2018We stand with you, WGA.\u2019 And we were like, \u2018Well, we stand\nwith you, UAW.\u2019\n\nDanny Tolli | Co-executive producer\n\n  2. A post-pandemic reckoning. The writers\u2019 grievances resonated with a broader post-pandemic reckoning around income inequality and how corporations treat workers. These were reflected in a wave of strikes and labor unrest in 2023 spanning numerous industries: autoworkers, Starbucks baristas, Kaiser Permanente health workers, Washington Post journalists, and UPS drivers and package handlers. At another time, the public may have perceived the writers\u2019 grievances as self-interested compensation demands from an elite group. Instead, the writers tapped into the national zeitgeist and connected their plight to broader public concerns about corporations prioritizing profits over workers, AI\u2019s threat to jobs, and the degradation of job quality.\n\nLeah Folta reflected on this national mood:\n\n> Income inequality was already so bad. We\u2019ve seen so much corporate\n> consolidation and so much wealth transferred upward. When the pandemic\n> started, and we had this huge disruptive event, it seemed like a lot was\n> being rethought at the same time that the transfer of wealth from workers to\n> the very few people at the top accelerated. I think the business model of a\n> huge corporation valuing its stock more than doing business well or treating\n> its workers well is in every part of our country right now. We are finally\n> at a point where it is so bad that everyone\u2019s ready to band together and\n> fight it. Nobody wants to spend our time doing this. It\u2019s not fun. It\u2019s\n> because things have gotten so bad.\n\n  3. Shaping public opinion. The writers effectively harnessed their creativity and writing talents to shape the story of the strike and influence public opinion. In particular, they successfully leveraged social media: sharing selfies, videos, messages, and humor to garner publicity and sympathy during the strike. The writers were also effective in framing studio executives\u2019 critical comments about their demands as cruel and out of touch\u2014contrasting these comments unfavorably to the CEOs\u2019 lavish pay packages. As the strike wore on, it was clear that public support skewed strongly in favor of the writers rather than the studios: 72% versus 19%, according to an August 2023 Gallup poll.\n  4. An alignment of interests around copyright. In securing AI protections, the writers benefited from the studios\u2019 shared interest in protecting copyright. The U.S. Copyright Office has determined that only works authored by a human can be copyrighted: \u201cIn the Office\u2019s view, it is well-established that copyright can protect only material that is the product of human creativity. Most fundamentally, the term \u2018author,\u2019 which is used in both the Constitution and the Copyright Act, excludes non-humans.\u201d Under this interpretation, the interests of writers and studios align: A human writer needs to be involved in creating written stories in order for the works to be copyrighted by law, which in turn protects studios\u2019 financial interests. This confluence of interests is somewhat unique to a narrow set of industries in entertainment, creative arts, and writing, where copyright is a salient concern for employers. Workers seeking protections in most other industries that generative AI will disrupt\u2014from customer service to law, finance, computer programming, clerical work, and education\u2014may face a more challenging battle in securing similar protections without this mutual interest between content owner and producer.\n  5. Leverage\u2014workers are indispensable, for now. In negotiating with the studios, writers continued to wield their most basic source of leverage as workers: their creative talents. Even with recent advancements in generative AI, studios cannot succeed today without the talents of the writers.\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg reflected on this leverage and timing:\n\n> Right now, we\u2019re at a place where if we say, \u2018It\u2019s us or the machines,\u2019\n> they\u2019re going to pick us because they know the machines aren\u2019t good enough\n> to completely replace us right now. This is the time when we have the\n> leverage and the power to get some of this into our contract before it\u2019s too\n> late. And not rely on the studios believing in the greater good or believing\n> in our rational arguments that that this would be better, but to actually\n> just exert our power and make them listen. And that\u2019s what we did.\n\n  6. Economic hardship, culpable villains. While studios may have assumed that writers\u2019 strained pocketbooks were a source of leverage, they may have underestimated the extent to which it was also a source of an inspiration and solidarity. In an anonymous comment to the media, one studio executive highlighted the (unsuccessful) strategy of prolonging the strike until writers run out of money as a way to gain leverage: \u201cThe endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses.\u201d But in the end, the increasingly precarious nature of their writing career fueled writers\u2019 motivation to fight for a better contract\u2014and it provided many writers with the training to weather a prolonged strike, including experience finding second jobs and side hustles to make ends meet. As the anonymous executive\u2019s comment underscores, the mere suggestion by a studio executive that the goal was to drive workers into hardship also reinforced the workers\u2019 preferred moral narrative of the strike and garnered more public sympathy for their cause.\n\nJackie Penn, TV writer | Photo credit: Philip Cheung\n\n## Lessons for other unions and workers in industries poised for AI disruption\n\nThe writers\u2019 success in securing historic AI protections dispelled the\nnarrative of inevitability that often frames discussions around AI and work.\nBy exercising their power, the writers pushed back and succeeded in setting\ntheir own terms for the use of AI. Their success has far-reaching implications\nfor workers across many other industries\u2014and not just those in the creative\narts, but also in knowledge work, STEM careers, customer service, clerical\nwork, and sectors such as law, finance, and journalism. That said, the\nimplications are greatly complicated by the fact that these are mostly non-\nunionized occupations.\n\nListen to the writer's own words\n\nI\u2019m really kind of amazed at what we were able to do as a guild. I hope other\nunions were paying attention. And workers are going to demand similar things\nin their industries, because this affects all different kinds of people\u2014it\u2019s\nnot just about TV writing.\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg | Showrunner\n\nThere are several important lessons for other unions, and AI-exposed workers\ngenerally, in the WGA\u2019s approach and ultimate success:\n\n  1. The agreement offers an historic precedent as well as a blueprint. The WGA agreement set an important precedent about the possibility of collective bargaining over the use of AI. The contract proves that it is possible for unions to bring employers to the negotiating table for technology like AI\u2014and the terms of the agreement provide a roadmap for other unions seeking similar protections. Importantly, in future contract negotiations, other unions can cite the writers\u2019 agreement if employers refuse to bargain over AI, and look to the specific protections it provides as a guide.\n  2. The contract reflects workers\u2019 decision to shape\u2014not ban\u2014the use of a powerful new technology. The WGA\u2019s approach of shaping the use of AI and its benefits\u2014and not fighting to ban it\u2014was instrumental to their success and a model for other unions.\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg elaborated on this:\n\n> If we can have some protections where we, the workers, can control the\n> automation, then the automation can be used to help us do our jobs. I don\u2019t\n> think anyone would be against that. We\u2019re not saying we want to go back to\n> the rotary phone. We\u2019re not saying we want innovation to stop in its tracks.\n> We\u2019re saying we need to hold the keys. Because when companies hold the keys,\n> we get cut out. And it\u2019s devastating for communities, it\u2019s devastating for\n> families, it\u2019s devastating for workers.\n\n  3. The contract terms could facilitate bottom-up, worker-led innovations that benefit workers and employers. The guardrails in the contract protecting compensation, credits, and job security create an enabling environment where writers may feel \u201csafe\u201d to experiment with the technology and explore ways to enhance their job. Compared to other big-tech inventions, generative AI is especially amendable to \u201cbottom-up\u201d innovations. Through this experimentation, there are important lessons that can be learned from writers\u2019 uses of AI, which can inform future development of these tools in ways that benefit workers.\n\nUltimately, this worker-driven experimentation is good for workers\u2014and good\nfor employers too. A growing body of research is documenting the benefits of\nincorporating end users (meaning workers in this context) into the design and\nroll out of new technologies, compared to top-down implementation. But most of\nus don\u2019t need formal scholarly research to confirm that: Every white-collar\nworker who has suffered the confusing and frustrating roll out of \u201camazing\u201d\nnew software in their organization can attest.\n\nWith writers in the driver\u2019s seat, generative AI may prove to be a helpful\ntool. This is also the case for workers across many industries\u2014from paralegals\nto auditors, market research analysts, educators, and engineers\u2014who may find\nproductive and job-quality-enhancing uses of the technology if given the right\nopportunity to experiment, shape, and benefit from its use. A lesson from the\nwriters\u2019 contract is that it is possible to open the door to mutually\nbeneficial uses of generative AI.\n\n  4. The workers were proactive, not reactive, to looming technological change\u2014acting before the horse had left the barn. Following ChatGPT\u2019s release, WGA leadership moved with notable speed to formulate regulations and guardrails to protect their members. They did not wait until studios were harnessing the technology to take action. By taking a proactive approach, the union was able to shape the use of this new technology more or less from the beginning, and put in place contract terms for future negotiations. The writers should continue this proactive approach, taking advantage of the scheduled discussions with the studios to engage in a dialogue about AI well ahead of the next contract negotiations.\n\nOther unions can learn from this forward-looking approach. Several have\nalready moved quickly to develop AI positions, mobilize members, and negotiate\nterms of AI use in collective bargaining agreements. For instance, just months\nafter the screenwriters and studios announced their historic agreement, the\nCommunication Workers of America (CWA) published a set of AI principles and\nrecommendations, including a proactive approach to educating their members and\na comprehensive strategy for addressing AI concerns.\n\n  5. Continued dialogue around AI outside of the collective bargaining process. Importantly, the contract specifies that studios and the WGA commit to semi-annual meetings, at the request of the union, to \u201cdiscuss and review\u201d the use and intended use of generative AI. These opportunities for semi-regular dialogue are important opportunities for continued monitoring and learning to ensure that technologies are deployed in ways that augment human creativity and share prosperity.\n\n### The need for policy reforms and new forms of worker voice and governance\n\nIn their pathbreaking approach to shaping the use of a new tool, the\nscreenwriters reminded us of an old one: the power of unions and collective\nbargaining. The writers\u2019 success was a clear vindication of collective action,\nand a reminder to a nation with very low rates of unionization, especially in\nthe private sector, compared to other advanced economies.\n\nDanny Tolli noted that what they accomplished as 11,500 writers standing\ntogether would never have been possible if he acted alone. Similarly, Leah\nFolta reflected:\n\n> I feel that unions are literally the only way for workers to protect\n> themselves or make change in this day and age. There is such an imbalance\n> between the giant companies we all work for and each individual worker. It\u2019s\n> the only protection we have...I feel so lucky to be in a union that is\n> exercising its power and its leverage.\n\nWhile historic, the replicability of the writers\u2019 success in securing worker-\nfriendly AI protections is limited in many of the industries that AI is poised\nto most disrupt. Nationally, 10% of workers and just 6% of private sector\nworkers were represented by a union in 2023. In the top three industries with\nthe highest AI exposure, unions represent an even smaller percentage of\nworkers.\n\nThis low union density means that most workers whose jobs will be disrupted by\ngenerative AI will very likely not have the same ability as the Hollywood\nwriters to bargain collectively or exercise real power in shaping the way AI\nimpacts their livelihood. Even for those who are represented by a union, few\nwill have the ability to bargain at the sector level (as opposed to the\nindividual enterprise or workplace level), as the WGA did.\n\nThis mismatch between union representation and AI exposure underscores the\nimportance of labor law reforms that enhance workers\u2019 ability to exercise\npower and voice in their workplace, and even at the sector level. Today, labor\nunions are enjoying their highest public approval since 1965. Despite this\nsoaring popularity, workers face an uphill battle in efforts to unionize,\nlargely due to fundamental weaknesses in current labor laws.\n\nFederal and state labor law reforms could level the playing field between\nworkers and employers and give workers a stronger voice, including regarding\nAI. While proposed labor reform legislation at the federal level has\nlanguished in the Senate, progress in the near term might be possible at the\nstate level. State governments are the nation\u2019s most frequent and active labor\nregulators, albeit with huge variation between relatively pro-labor versus\nanti-labor states.\n\nLabor law reforms are also needed to replicate some of the best examples of\ninstitutions of worker voice in other advanced economies, including those in\nEurope. Sectoral bargaining, which entails negotiating across an entire sector\nto create industry-wide standards, offers an impactful model of worker voice\nthat can lead to more effective labor-management collaboration around\ntechnology. So does \u201cworker co-determination\u201d of how enterprises will\nproduce\u2014i.e., how work will be done, as distinct from how it will be rewarded.\nWorks councils in Germany and Scandinavian countries give elected worker\nrepresentatives an opportunity to influence the deployment of technology. The\nadoption of works councils and sectoral bargaining face numerous barriers,\nincluding requiring labor law reform, the cooperation of potentially reluctant\nemployers, and overcoming resistance from some unions. The Clean Slate for\nWorker Power project at Harvard Law School has delineated several reforms and\nrecommendations that could pave the way for works councils and sectoral\nbargaining. Absent broader reforms, new ideas should be explored, including\nAI-specific bargaining at the sectoral level.\n\nWith the limited reach of unions and absence of formal institutions such as\nworks councils, workers will also need civil society organizations,\npolicymakers, worker groups, and industry itself to play a role in creating\nnew opportunities for worker voice, collaboration, and guardrails.\n\nStates have moved faster than the federal government in exploring legislation\nto provide AI protections to workers, especially around avoiding harms related\nto surveillance, bias, and data privacy. To date, there are few examples of\nlegislation specifically addressing the harms of automation and its risk to\nlivelihoods.\n\nWorkers in impacted industries can learn from campaigns such as Bargaining for\nthe Common Good and Athena. Workers, policymakers, and concerned citizens can\nalso learn from voluntarily adopted codes of conduct for \u201cgood\u201d employers, and\nthey can influence those with their buying and investing power, as nonprofit\norganizations focused on business reform such as JUST Capital and the Good\nJobs Institute have shown.\n\nHowever we motivate good employer practice\u2014whether by formal rule, new\nindustry norms reinforced by a watchful public and policy environment, or\nboth\u2014we have some emerging indicators beyond the screenwriters\u2019 agreement of\nwhat it can look like. In new research on bringing worker voice into the\ndeployment of generative AI, Tom Kochan and colleagues at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology cited the new tech-labor partnership between Microsoft\nand the AFL-CIO as an example of the new, collaborative forums needed to bring\nindustry and workers together to adopt shared-gain\u2014rather than zero-\nsum\u2014approaches to AI. This includes work further upstream in how the\ntechnology is designed in the first place. For instance, the AFL-CIO\u2019s\nTechnology Institute has partnered with universities including Carnegie Mellon\nto bring workers\u2019 perspectives and voices into the research and design of AI\nand other new technology products.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn some ways, the writers\u2019 success reflects something of a best-case scenario.\nThey were organized in a highly effective union, in a unionized industry, in a\nunion town. They leveraged one of their greatest skills\u2014their imagination\u2014to\nproject into the future and swiftly anticipate threats to their livelihood. As\ncreators of popular shows and movies watched by millions of people, they\nenjoyed a visibility that other workers in similarly AI-exposed\nindustries\u2014such as paralegals, call center workers, bookkeeping assistants,\nengineers, and insurance underwriters\u2014lack.\n\nEven with this groundbreaking success, many writers remain anxious about the\nfuture. While historic, the contract they secured covers only the next three\nyears, rendering the future uncertain as technological capabilities continue\nto advance. Many writers spoke frankly about the tension between corporations\u2019\ninterest in maximizing profits and the security of their jobs. Shaping the\nfuture of their work will require vigilance, organizing, policy change, and\nattention from policymakers.\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg reflected on the challenge ahead:\n\n> I think Washington should take this seriously. This is something that unites\n> workers across all industries: the fear that automation is going to take\n> over our jobs...I think we need to organize. I think it\u2019s going to require\n> unions. I think it\u2019s going to require rallying politicians, and it\u2019s going\n> to require large groups of people working together. Obviously, you\u2019re not\n> going to stop innovation\u2014that\u2019s a foolish thing to hope for, nor would I\n> want to. But I think you can create some guardrails around it and use\n> political power and worker power to protect people.\n\nWhat gives Danny Tolli hope for the future is the broad solidarity he\nwitnessed during the strike, with workers banding together across industries\nas diverse as hospitality, health care, and manufacturing. Their victory was\nbigger than just one industry: It has already inspired worker mobilization and\nadditional safeguards, and provided a blueprint for what is possible.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI am immensely grateful to the writers who generously shared their stories:\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg, Leah Folta, Cheryl Guerriero, David A.
