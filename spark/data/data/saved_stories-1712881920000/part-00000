The designation\nmeans that the extremely infectious measles virus is no longer endemic in the\nUS\u2014defined as continuous transmission in the country over 12 or more months\nwhile in the presence of an effective disease monitoring system. The country\nwent from having 3 to 4 million children fall ill with the severe infection\neach year, to tallying just dozens of mostly travel-linked cases.\n\nBut in an alarming turn, the country's elimination status is now at risk.\nMeasles cases in the first quarter of 2024 have increased more than 17-fold\nover the cases seen in the first quarters of 2000 to 2023. Measles vaccination\nrates among kindergarteners have slipped in that time, too, with vaccination\ncoverage in the last three consecutive years below the 95 percent target that\nis needed to prevent sustained transmission. Outside the US, measles cases are\nexploding in the wake of pandemic-related disruptions to routine childhood\nvaccination programs. Altogether, the conditions are prime for measles to\nregain its foothold in the country\u2014and the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention is clearly anxious.\n\n\"The rapid increase in the number of reported measles cases during the first\nquarter of 2024 represents a renewed threat to elimination,\" CDC researchers\nwrite in a new analysis of the country's measles cases and surveillance\nsystem. The analysis was published Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and\nMortality Weekly Report.\n\nThe analysis takes a deep look at the country's current and recent measles\ncases: how they got here, how and why they spread once here, and how good our\npublic health systems were at tracking them and breaking the chains of\ntransmission. The good news is that our surveillance systems appear to be\nworking well. \"A variety of transmission chain sizes were detected, including\nisolated cases, suggesting that sustained measles transmission would be\nrapidly detected,\" the CDC notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there are many reasons to worry that that is not enough. In 2019, the\ncountry nearly lost its elimination status amid two prolonged outbreaks in New\nYork and New York City. While the COVID-19 crisis kept measles at bay since\nthen, the conditions for a resurgence have only worsened.\n\n## How it could happen\n\nIf the US loses its status, the new analysis paints a clear picture of how\nit's likely to happen: An unvaccinated US resident will pick up an infection\nwhile abroad and bring it home to an under-vaccinated community. Unvaccinated\nbut vaccine-eligible children in that community contract the virus and create\na chain of sustained transmission.\n\nThe CDC noted 338 measles cases between January 1, 2020, and March 28, 2024.\nThe median age of the cases was 3 years old. Of the 338 cases, 97 were in\n2024. (The year's current tally now stands at 113.) Among the 338 cases, 326\n(96 percent) were linked to an importation (12 cases\u20144 percent\u2014had an unknown\nsource). The 326 include 93 cases that were directly imported into the\ncountry, of which 59 (63 percent) were in US residents. Of those 59, 53 (90\npercent) were vaccine-eligible but unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination\nstatus.\n\nOf the 338 total cases, 309 cases (91 percent) were either unvaccinated (68\npercent) or had an unknown vaccination status (23 percent). Of the 309 cases,\n259 (84 percent) were vaccine eligible, with the remainder being in babies 6\nto 11 months who are too young for routine vaccination (13 percent) or babies\nless than 6 months who are too young for vaccination altogether (3 percent).\n\nIn the past years, the most common places from which measles importations\noriginated were in the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions. But, so far\nin 2024, six of 16 importations (37.5 percent) came from Europe (three) and\nEast Asia (three), which represents a 50 percent increase in importations from\nthese areas in the past three years. In other words, measles is increasing\nglobally, increasing the risk of importation to the US.\n\nAnd as such: \"The US measles elimination status will continue to be threatened\nby global increases in measles incidence and decreases in global, national,\nand local measles vaccination coverage,\" the CDC concludes. Overall,\nvaccination is still high enough in the US to prevent large-scale outbreaks.\nBut to keep measles from becoming endemic once more, the US must improve\nmeasles vaccination rates, encourage vaccination before international travel,\nidentify vulnerable communities that are under-vaccinated, and swiftly\ninvestigate suspected measles cases, the CDC researchers advise.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n64\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
