You saw that play out in the LA\nstrikes last year,\u201d says Peters, speaking to The Hollywood Reporter ahead of\nhis MIPTV session. \u201cNot everybody wants to eliminate the societal issues that\ncan come from this technology, there are people who want to exploit this\ntechnology...That\u2019s what keeps me up at night.\u201d\n\n### Related Stories\n\nMovies\n\n### Xixi Pictures Sets Its Sights on Building a Global Brand for Chinese TV\nDrama\n\nMovies\n\n### Bong Joon Ho Unveils Irreverent First Trailer for Robert Pattinson Starrer\n'Mickey 17'\n\nEarlier this year, Getty filed suit in London against Stability AI claiming\nthe open-source generative AI company unlawfully copied and processed millions\nof Getty\u2019s copyright-protected images.\n\nBut the stock images giant is trying to be proactive as well, signing a deal\nwith AI giant Nvidia to create AI text-to-image and text-to-video services\nwith a generative model trained on Getty\u2019s copyright-protected library of\nstock images. Peters argues the deal will both protect creators by ensuring\ncompensation for use of their work, and guard against abuse. \u201cThis model can\u2019t\nproduce deepfakes, because it was trained on only a creative universe. It\ndoesn\u2019t know who Taylor Swift is. It doesn\u2019t know who Joe Biden is,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion, Peters outlined his hopes for the future of AI\nwithin the creative industries while warning about the dangers if legislation\ndoes not keep pace with the speed of technological development. \u201cWe need to\ndevelop some standards [quickly] because there were more images created\nthrough AI last year than there were created through lens-based technologies.\u201d\n\nThis might be an odd place to start, but I\u2019d like to get your take on what\nhappened around the doctored Kate Middleton photo, Getty and other photo\nagencies\u2019 reaction to it in issuing a kill notice for the image and the debate\nit sparked among the general public. What lessons did Getty take from that\nincident?\n\nWell, I won\u2019t comment on the general public. I think that\u2019s well-documented.\nIn terms of us, one thing we learned was our processes work. We did identify\nthe image as being doctored and enacted processes in order to pull that image\nfrom our service as well as to alert customers. That\u2019s the good side. I think\nthe other learning is that these established relationships between the media\nand organizations, in this case, the royal family, the monarchy, will I think\nrequire higher scrutiny going forward. We take handout imagery from the likes\nof the royal family. We take it from NASA, we take it from other\norganizations, we distribute it, and it is clearly labeled as such. But I\nthink there needs to be more scrutiny on that.\n\nIn many cases, we need to slow down the path from them to our website and put\non more scrutiny upfront. I think we got it right, I just think we could have\nprobably got it right earlier. I think we and other outlets are going through\nthat learning process, and I\u2019ve already made adjustments to our processes.\n\nGetty is collaborating with AI company Nvidia. You\u2019ve launched a service to\nprovide AI text-to-image generation of stock photos with an AI engine trained\non the Getty archive. This could seem to be a kind of Faustian bargain. Why\ndid you do it? Aside from initial profits for Getty from the deal, what\nbenefits do you see for the whole ecosystem that will come from this?\n\nThe why is we didn\u2019t view it as a Faustian bargain. We believe AI is something\nthat\u2019s here. It\u2019s real and it\u2019s going to be transformative. It is not a\ntechnology in search of an application, something like Bitcoin. This is real.\nIt\u2019s gonna be transformative along the lines of the PC, you know, or mobile\ndevices, smartphones. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can put in a box. We\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s something that you can ignore. And we think it can be highly\nbeneficial to creators. It can be very negative for creators as well. I think\nwe\u2019ve yet to figure out where this is going to fall.\n\nBut ultimately, we want this technology to be beneficial to creators. And so\nwith Nvidia, we found a partner that was willing to respect the intellectual\nproperty of Getty Images, and our creators to jointly create a service that\nwas trained on licensed data, most notably our content, giving an ongoing\nshare of revenues that are generated by this service back to those creators\nwhose work it was trained on. So ultimately the utilization of AI benefits the\ncreators and their IP that it was trained on. It\u2019s a commercial-first service\nand commercially-safe service. This model can\u2019t produce deepfakes, because it\nwas trained on only a creative universe. It doesn\u2019t know who Taylor Swift is.\nIt doesn\u2019t know who Joe Biden is. It doesn\u2019t know who the Pope is. It can only\nproduce commercial outcomes that can be utilized by businesses in their sales,\nmarketing, etc.\n\nWe thought it was important to demonstrate that these services could be\ndeveloped off of licensed material, that they could be high quality, and that\nthey don\u2019t have to come with all of the social harms, the collateral harms\nthat can come with releasing this technology into the world. We thought it was\ncommercially safe, it was socially responsible. And it was one that helped\ncreators not harmed creators.\n\nThat\u2019s the reason we jumped in with Nvidia on this. So we don\u2019t view it as a\nFaustian bargain at all. We actually think it stands as a pretty unique model\nrelative to the other models that are out in the marketplace that didn\u2019t\nlicense training data. That don\u2019t compensate content creators for the use of\nthat data, and don\u2019t put necessary controls around the use of their tools or\nwhat those tools can do. Those represent breaches of third-party intellectual\nproperty, breaches of privacy rights, breaches, ultimately, of social and\nlegal norms.\n\nCan you take me through how the compensation process will work?\n\nThey\u2019re based on two proxies. It\u2019s there\u2019s not great technology to be able to\nfollow pixel by pixel through at this point. Maybe that is something that will\ndevelop over time. We basically compensate on the quantum that you have within\nthe training set. So if you\u2019re one of a hundred items, you get 1/100th and\nthen there\u2019s also the performance of your imagery generally, which is kind of\na quality proxy for us. So if your imagery is, licensed more off of our\nplatform, that\u2019s a good proxy for quality in our view, and you\u2019ll share more\nin those profits.\n\nAre the images being created through this system, the original AI-generated\nimages, copyright-protected?\n\nThat\u2019s an open question. We don\u2019t circulate these images that were created\nback into our library. If you\u2019re prompting the images, you are actually a\nparticipant in the creation of them and therefore we believe you have some\nlevel of ownership in that content. But we also want our library to be clean.\nBut the question of whether this content can be copyrighted is right now,\nwell, at least in the U.S. and the U.K. and the EU the answer is no. I think\nover time we are going to get to some level where human endeavor involved in\nAI creation will be compensated in some way. Right now copyright can only be\nassigned to a human creation, not an artificial creation. I think there\u2019ll be\nsome blurred line that gets drawn in the future, but right now the line is\npretty hard that you can\u2019t copyright this material.\n\nWill all the material created by this system be labeled as created by AI? How\nwill it be watermarked?\n\nThe watermarking technology is still kind of being developed. It\u2019s one of the\nconcerns we had with technology firms that were just racing out with these\ntechnologies and didn\u2019t think through the requirements of that. We put in the\nmetadata that was used to create it. We\u2019re trying to get standards developed\nto have a better watermark, a kind of immutable, permanent way to identify\nthis content. Right now some are putting on watermarks but most are putting no\nlabeling at all. Some are putting just a visual kind of cue in the lower right\nthat can be easily cropped out. So we need to develop some standards around\nthat. Because there were more images created through AI last year than there\nwere created through lens-based technologies. It\u2019s going to be pretty\nimportant for the public and others to be able to discern true images from AI.\n\nHow confident are you that you\u2019ll win this race? AI is already outpacing you\nin terms of production.\n\nI think there are people that care about this issue, in government and on the\nregulatory side of things. I think there are people in the technology industry\nthat care about this. And I think there are people in the media industry that\ncare about it. I think if we come together with good intent we can solve it.\nIf we can create these technologies to produce this type of content, we can\ncreate technologies that can identify this type of content. I\u2019m pretty sure\nabout it. We just need the rewards and incentives, the structure in place to\ndo so.\n\nBut that\u2019s the rub, isn\u2019t it? It doesn\u2019t seem to be purely a technology\nproblem, but more a political problem.\n\nI think it\u2019s a political/regulatory problem. In the political case, you\u2019ve got\nthe EU\u2019s AI Act that actually puts some requirements in place, though many\nstill need to be defined. There are discussions and other jurisdictions around\nthe globe around this but legislation lags behind the technology. So am I\nconfident? Not 100 percent. But do I have a drive to achieve this? Yes, and\nthat\u2019s where Gettys is trying to lead the way within the creative industry and\nwithin the media industry, trying to lead in terms of setting the parameters\nby which we think this technology can be beneficial to the creative industries\nand also beneficial to society as a whole.\n\nWhere do you see the real benefits in the particular service that you\u2019re\noffering?\n\nWell it fits into our core value proposition, that we\u2019ve always delivered to\nour customers. Our content has been used in in theatrical releases and series\nand it allows creators to create at a high level. In some cases they can rely\non our documentary footage or other things to tell stories in ways that they\ncouldn\u2019t do otherwise. In some cases, it saves them time or it\u2019s a lot cheaper\nand easier and quicker to rely on a preset library than to go off and do\nproduction. So we can be time efficient. We, we can be budget efficient. And\nwe avoid intellectual property risk. Intellectual property rights can vary\naround the world, it can be quite complex, and we can eliminate that risk for\nour customers.\n\nAnd this tool allows people to ideate and create in new ways. Not everything\nyou can imagine can be shot through a camera. In some cases, these tools can\nallow you to imagine new images. In other cases, they allow you to do things\nmore quickly or easily than existing tools. A lot of this can be done in\nsoftware like Photoshop or other editing platforms. But it can take time\nworking pixel by pixel. You can automate that and save time. And because we\nfree you from intellectual property risk, you don\u2019t have to worry about what\nthis system was trained on, who it was trained on, about the names and\nlikenesses of the people and their private data. It allows you to create more\nfreely. It\u2019s a tool.\n\nYou know, originally there was a big tool named Avid, where you\u2019d spend\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to edit video on. That moved into Final Cut\nPro which allowed you to do the same thing on a richer basis at a much lower\ncost. This is a similar kind of democratization of things that enables people\nto create. Ultimately that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for by putting this service\ninto the world, that will enable more creativity and allow people to do their\nwork more efficiently.\n\nWhat about your original creators, your photographers and videographers, the\ncreators that are the basis of Getty\u2019s entire business? Doesn\u2019t this tool risk\nundermining their whole profession?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think our creators have a tremendous amount of creativity.\nI think they have a tremendous amount of experience and understanding of how\nto create content that really resonates with an audience. There\u2019s a lot of\nexpertise that goes into that. It\u2019s not easy to do. 15-16 years ago, when the\nsmartphone came out. everyone could take a picture but not everyone can take a\nmeaningful picture, not just a high-quality picture, but a meaningful one, one\nthat you\u2019d want to use with your brand or on your website to promote your\nproducts and services. That\u2019s the scarcity that still continues to exist. If\nanything, I think AI makes the creators more important, because when everybody\ncan create as much imagery as they want, it becomes harder and harder to stand\nout.\n\nHow concerned are you that at the moment we don\u2019t have regulations or\nagreements around the big platforms which are the ones that are actually\ndisseminating this material, and in many cases are funding AI programs that\nare producing it en masse?\n\nI think clearly they are going to be regulated by the EU Act, and in the\nUnited States, they\u2019ve made commitments to the White House that they will\nimplement some of those technologies and standards. The specifics still need\nto be worked out. But Meta started adjusting some of their editorial policies\nand takedown policies with respect to generative imagery and modified imagery.\nI think those are steps in the right direction. But there are other companies\nthat have done nothing and haven\u2019t made any changes. It will take regulators\nto step in and be detrimental to their bank accounts and their ability to do\nbusiness in certain territories. This is not something that is going to go\naway. Where it gets more dangerous is in some of the open source models, and\nsome of the smaller companies like Stability AI, that\u2019s put this technology\nout there with no controls around it and no commitments to respect copyright.\nWe still need more regulatory and legislative action. But I think the large\ntech platforms understand this and are moving in that direction. We probably\njust need a firmer push, with more specifics.\n\nWhat personally scares you about this technology and its potential for harm?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say scares, but what concerns me is that not everyone wants there\nto be more creators, some want the creators to be automated away. You saw that\nplay out in the LA strikes last year and in the negotiations. Not everybody\nwants to eliminate the societal issues that can come from this technology.\nThere are people who want to exploit this technology. Those are my concerns. I\nthink this technology can be incredibly beneficial to society, but if it\u2019s not\nharnessed correctly, if it\u2019s not managed correctly, it could be quite\ndetrimental. Those are the things that keep me up at night. The unknown, the\nuncertainty, and the broader social issues that come from this technology.\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up\n\n## More from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n  * Jessica Alba\n\n### Jessica Alba Stepping Down From Leadership Role at the Honest Company\n\n  * box office\n\n### Adam Aron Brushes Off Box Office Woes: \u201cIt\u2019s Inconceivable That AMC Would\nFile for Chapter 11\u201d\n\n  * Sky Studios\n\n### London\u2019s Garden Studios Hires Sky Studios Top Exec Bee Devine as COO\n\n  * Editors Guild\n\n### Editors Guild Reaches Tentative Agreement on Craft-Specific Issues\n\n  * Olympics\n\n### NBCUniversal Expects Advertising Record for 2024 Paris Olympics, Will\nBenefit From Women\u2019s Sports Boom\n\n  * Paramount Global\n\n### Courtney Armstrong Upped to COO of Paramount Pictures\n\n### Shopping With THR\n\n### The 35+ Best Deals to Shop at Sephora\u2019s Spring Savings Event: Rare Beauty,\nCharlotte Tilbury and More\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\n\n### The Best Music Festival Must-Haves for Your Last-Minute Coachella Packing\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\n\n### These Spring Dyson Deals Save You Up to $240 on Vacuums, Hair Tools and\nAir Purifiers\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston, Rudie Obias\n\n### The Best Western-Inspired Fashion Pieces, From Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Hat and\nBoots to Denim Essentials and Buckle Belts\n\nBy Natalie Alcala\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.
