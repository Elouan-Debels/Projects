Also available from Amazon: Turning and Mechanical\nManipulation.\n\n# Maudslay's Methods Of Originating Screws\n\nIn a subsequent and stronger machine, the bar carrying the mandrel stood lower\nthan the other, to admit of larger change wheels upon it, and the same driving\ngear was retained. And in another structure of the screw-cutting lathe, Mr.\nMaudslay placed the triangular bar for the lathe heads in the center, whilst a\nlarge and wide slide-plate, moving between chamfer bars attached to the\nframing, carried the sliding rest for the tool: in this last machine, the\nmandrel was driven by steam power, and the retrograde motion had about double\nthe velocity of that used in cutting the screw. Indeed these machines may be\nfairly considered to be the precursors of the present screwing lathes, in\nwhich the detached triangular bars or slides have been exchanged for one\nstrong bearer with two ridges or fillets, upon which the slide plate moves for\nguiding the traverse of the tool.\n\nThe relations between the guide-screw and the copy were varied in all possible\nways: the guide was changed end for end, or different parts of it were\nsuccessively used; sometimes also two guide-screws were yoked together with\nthree equal wheels, their nuts being connected by a bar jointed to each, and\nthe center of this link, (whose motion thus became the mean of that of the\nguides,) was made to traverse the tool. Steel screws were also cut and\nconverted into original taps, from which dies were made, to be themselves used\nin correcting the minor errors, and render the screws in all respects as\nequable as possible. In fact every scheme that he could devise, which appeared\nlikely to benefit the result, was carefully tried, in order to perfect to the\nutmost, the helical character and equality of subdivision of the screw. Mr.\nMaudslay succeeded by these means, after great perse-verance, in making a very\nexcellent brass screw about seven feet long, and which, compared with standard\nmeasure, was less than one sixteenth of an inch false of its nominal length.\nTaking the error as the one-thousandth part of the total length of the screw,\nwhich was beyond its real quantity, to make from it a corrected screw by the\nsystem of change wheels, would have required one wheel of 1000 teeth, and\nanother of one tooth less, or 999; but in reality the error was much less, and\nperhaps nearer the two-thousandth of an inch; then the wheels of 2000 and 1999\nteeth would have been required; consequently the system of change wheels is\nscarcely applicable to the correction of very minute errors of length.\n\nThe change of the thousandth part of the total length, was therefore given to\nthe tool as a supplementary motion, which might be added to, or subtracted\nfrom the total traverse of the tool, in the mode explained by the diagram,\nfig. 612, in which all details of construction are purposely omitted. The copy\nC, and the guide-screw G, are supposed to be connected by equal wheels in the\nusual manner; the guide-screw carries the axis of the bent lever, whose arms\nare as 10 to 1, and which moves in a horizontal plane; the short arm carries\nthe tool, the long arm is jointed to a saddle which slides upon a triangular\nbar i i.\n\nFig. 612.\n\nIn point of fact, the tool was mounted upon the upper of two longitudinal and\nparallel slides, which were collectively traversed by the guide-screw G. In\nthe lower slide was fixed the axis or fulcrum of the bent lever, the short arm\nof which was connected by a link with the upper slide, so that the\ncompensating motion was given to the upper slide relatively to the lower.\n\nThe triangular bar i i, when placed exactly parallel with the path of the tool\nwould produce no movement on the same, and C, and G, would be exactly alike;\nbut if i i, were placed out of parallelism one inch in the whole length, the\ntool, during its traverse to the left by the guide-screw G, would be moved to\nthe right by the shifting of the bent lever one-tenth of the displacement of\nthe bar, or one-tenth of an inch.\n\nTherefore whilst the guide-screw G, from being coarser than required, moved\nthe principal slide the one-thousandth part of the total length in excess; the\nbent lever and inclined straight bar i i, polled back the upper or\ncompensating slide, the one-thousandth part, or the quantity in excess; making\nthe absolute traverse of the tool exactly seven feet, or the length required\nfor the new screw C, instead of seven feet and one-sixteenth of an inch the\nlength of G. To have lengthened the traverse of the tool, the bar i i, must\nhave been inclined the reverse way; in other words, the path of the tool is in\nthe diagram the difference of the two motions; in the reverse inclination, its\npath would be the sum of the two motions, and i i being a straight line, the\ncorrection would be evenly distributed at every part of the length.*\n\nWhilst Mr. Maudslay s experiments in perfecting the screw were being carried\non, his friend Mr. Barton,\u2020 paid frequent visits to his manufactory, and also\npursued a similar course. Mr. Barton preferred, however, the method of the\nchain or flexible band, for traversing the tool the exact quantity; because\nthe reduction of the diameter of the pulley or drum, afforded a very ready\nmeans of adjustment for total length; and all the wheels of the mechanism\nbeing individually as perfect as they could be made, a near approach to\ngeneral perfection was naturally anticipated on the first trial. This mode,\nhowever, is subject to the error introduced by the elasticity or elongation of\nthe chain or band, and which is at the maximum when the greatest length of\nchain is uncoiled from the barrel.\n\nThese two individuals having therefore arrived, by different methods, as near\nto perfection as they were then respectively capable of; each made a screw of\nthe same pitch, and 15 inches long, and the two when placed side by side were\nfound exactly to agree throughout their length, and were considered perfect.\nThe two screws were submitted in 1810 to the scrutiny of that celebrated\nmathematical instrument maker, the late Mr. Edw. Troughton, F.R.S., etc, who\nexamined them by means of two powerful microscopes with cross wires, such as\nare used for reading off the graduations of astronomical instruments; applied\nlike a pair of the most refined compasses, to measure the equality of some 20,\n50, or 100 threads, taken indiscriminately at different parts of the length of\nthe screws.* From this severe trial it resulted, that these screws, which to\nthe unassisted sight, and for almost every purpose of mechanism, were\nunexceptionable, were found to be full of all kinds of errors, being unequally\ncoarse at different parts, and even irregular in their angles, or \"drunk.\"\nThis rigid scrutiny led both parties to fresh and ultimately successful\nefforts, but of these our limits will only allow us to notice one, apparently\nderived from the use of the two microscopes.\n\nContinue to:\n\n  * prev: Various Modes Of Originating And Improving Screws.
