Make sure you have read the Intro from Praat\u2019s\nHelp menu. 3. If that does not help, use the Search button in Praat\u2019s manual\nwindow. 4. Or consult the Frequently Asked Questions directly. 5. There is a\nuser group on the Internet: the Praat User List. 6. If none of the above\nhelps, you can send email to paul.boersma@uva.nl.  \n  \n## Functionality\n\nThe following gives you an idea of the features of the Praat program.
