In recent months, TikTok ran promos and pop-ups around its\nCarousel function, which allows users to publish individual posts that contain\ntwo to 35 images in a scroll format. The feature is similar to, but more\nexpansive than, Instagram\u2019s Carousel feature, which debuted in 2017 and allows\nusers to post two to 10 photos.\n\nThis is happening while TikTok, which is facing a possible ban in the United\nStates, is reportedly rolling out a new photo app called TikTok Notes, per\nmedia reports over the weekend. The news comes a year and a half after TikTok\nlaunched a slideshow format called Photo Mode that paired photos with text and\naudio.\n\nIn a message sent to creators, TikTok promises that Carousel posts get \u201c2.9x\nmore comments,\u201d \u201c1.9x more likes\u201d and \u201c2.6x more shares on average\u201d than video\nposts.\n\nIndeed, TikTok-heavy brands that spoke with Modern Retail said they\u2019ve found\nthe Carousel function useful for building brand awareness. Although one brand\nsaid Carousel performance has \u201cfallen off a little bit\u201d in the last month, all\nplan to continue using the function, depending on what type of story they are\ntrying to tell or what trends are rising in popularity.\n\nSkin care brand Youthforia started using Carousel in January. It\u2019s found that\nCarousel posts see 11% higher reach and higher average views than video posts,\nTina Shim, the company\u2019s vp of marketing, told Modern Retail.\n\nIn fact, the company\u2019s most popular TikTok post is in the Carousel format and\nhas 6.6 million views. It follows founder Fiona Co Chan\u2019s experience pitching\nto investors on \u201cShark Tank\u201d and making a deal with Mark Cuban. That\nparticular post, Shim told Modern Retail, resonated more internationally than\nsome video TikToks. \u201cIt found its way into all sorts of different spaces that\nwe hadn\u2019t been in before,\u201d Shim said.\n\nBlume, which makes coffee alternatives and superfood lattes, has also begun\nusing Carousel for global reach. The brand is based in Canada but is testing\nout Carousel to appeal to a U.S. audience, co-founder Karen Danudjaja told\nModern Retail. \u201cWith Carousels, we\u2019re able to really pump them out at a higher\nrate... so there\u2019s a real scalability to them,\u201d she said. \u201cCarousels are one\nof the things that have been most consistently generating results.\u201d\n\nSome of Blume\u2019s most popular Carousel posts relate to its recent launch in\nTarget in the U.S. Danudjaja didn\u2019t consider this to be a coincidence. \u201cWe\u2019ll\nexperiment with hooks, we\u2019ll experiment with captions, but the overall layout\nof using Carousels, we\u2019ll repeat over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been\nthe advice given to us on TikTok: Find out what works and then really lean\ninto it.\u201d\n\nAugust, a period care brand, started posting photo slideshows on TikTok soon\nafter the function became available in 2022. It also posts videos and sees\nboth formats perform well. \u201cIt\u2019s really about hitting that sweet spot,\u201d Ruby\nMoon, content manager at August, told Modern Retail. \u201cIf we\u2019re using a\nCarousel post because there\u2019s a trend going on that includes that feature,\nsure, it\u2019ll do a little bit better. But I think that we\u2019ve also had videos go\nviral at the same time.\u201d\n\nIn general, August finds that Carousel posts work well for trending prompts\nthat require some sort of \u201creveal\u201d in a later slide. (Slide one typically\nincludes the set-up for a joke, with slide two as the punchline.) August also\nuses the Carousel format to push out pictures of products or images from photo\nshoots, or to communicate information via infographics. One of August\u2019s most\npopular posts on TikTok, for instance, is a Carousel post about the sales tax\nthat customers in many U.S. states pay on menstrual products.\n\nSkin care brand Bubble, meanwhile, opts for Carousel posts to make memes,\neducate viewers about a product or routine or publish \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d\ncontent, Marianne Robinson, Bubble\u2019s community director and acting social\nmedia director, told Modern Retail via email. Bubble published its first\nCarousel post in March 2023. \u201cIt allows users to digest and cycle through\ncontent at their own pace, which I believe users like and even prefer,\u201d\nRobinson said.\n\nLia Haberman, a digital media marketing expert, strategist and speaker, told\nModern Retail that she sees TikTok\u2019s photo push as the platform \u201ctrying to be\nall things to all people.\u201d Not everyone wants to post videos, she said, and\nthere\u2019s a lower barrier to entry to Carousel, as many of today\u2019s social media\nusers are used to uploading photos.\n\nHaberman finds TikTok Carousel clunkier than Instagram Carousel but considers\nTikTok\u2019s feature better for storytelling. \u201cA couple of years ago, [the\nculture] was very much around the \u2018photo dump\u2019 and people just putting a bunch\nof photos together with very little curation involved,\u201d she said. \u201cI think on\nTikTok, there seems to be more intention and purpose in why and how you\u2019re\ncurating these photos.\u201d\n\nTikTok has updated its content parameters more and more over the last couple\nyears. In 2022, it expanded the maximum length of videos to 10 minutes long.\nThere have been rumors of a TikTok photo app since March, when bloggers\ntracked down references in TikTok\u2019s code. Now, per reports, TikTok is telling\nsome users that that day is near.\n\n\u201cTikTok Notes, a new app for photo posts, is coming soon. Your existing and\nfuture public TikTok photo posts will be shown on TikTok Notes,\u201d an in-app\npop-up says, according to SocialMediaToday. TikTok did not immediately respond\nto a request for comment.\n\nAlready, brands are preparing for this yet-to-be-launched app. Youthforia, for\nexample, is open to using that service. \u201cAt minimum, we\u2019ll definitely try it,\u201d\nShim said. \u201cI think some of it will depend on the audience. It\u2019ll be\ninteresting to see if they add one more app to their rotation.\u201d\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\n## More in Technology\n\nDigital Marketing Redux\n\n#### TikTok is pushing brands to post photos instead of videos\n\nApril 09, 2024 \u25a0 5 min read\n\nTikTok is forging ahead on becoming a full-fledged photo platform -- and\nbrands are coming along for the ride.
