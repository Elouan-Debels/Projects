The last Parkfield mainshock occurred on 28\nSeptember 2004, 38 years after the 1966 earthquake, and after the segment\nshowed a \u223c22 years average recurrence time. The main reason for the much\nlonger interevent period between the last two earthquakes is thought to be the\nreduction of the Coulomb stress from the M6.5 Coalinga earthquake of 2 May\n1983, and the M6 Nu\u00f1ez events of June 11th and 22 July 1983. Plausibly, the\ntransitional segment of the SAF at Parkfield is now in the late part of its\nseismic cycle and current observations may all be relative to a state of\nstress close to criticality. However, the behavior of the attenuation\nparameter in the last few years seems substantially different from the one\nthat characterized the years prior to the 2004 mainshock. A few questions\narise: (i) Does a detectable preparation phase for the Parkfield mainshocks\nexist, and is it the same for all events? (ii) How dynamically/kinematically\nsimilar are the quasi-periodic occurrences of the Parkfield mainshocks? (iii)\nAre some dynamic/kinematic characteristics of the next mainshock predictable\nfrom the analysis of current data? (e.g., do we expect the epicenter of the\nnext failure to be co-located to that of 2004?) (iv) Should we expect the\nduration of the current interseismic period to be close to the 22-year\n\u201cundisturbed\u201d average value? We respond to the questions listed above by\nanalyzing the non-geometric attenuation of direct S-waves along the\ntransitional segment of the SAF at Parkfield, in the close vicinity of the\nfault plane, between January 2001 and November 2023. Of particular interest is\nthe preparatory behavior of the attenuation parameter as the 2004 mainshock\napproached, on both sides of the SAF. We also show that the non-volcanic\ntremor activity modulates the seismic attenuation in the area, and possibly\nthe seismicity along the Parkfield fault segment, including the occurrence of\nthe mainshocks.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAn important seismological question is whether detectable preparatory phases\nexist and can be observed before major earthquakes. In case of a positive\nresponse, the next question would be whether the same preparatory phase is\ncommon to all mainshocks, and many recent studies went deep into these issues.\nFor example, Bletery and Nocquet (2023) analyzed the very final moments of the\nseismic cycle on a set of 90 earthquakes (M7); they found that a \u223c2-hour-long\nexponential acceleration characterizes the slip before the ruptures,\nsuggesting that large earthquakes start with a precursory phase of slip. Other\nrecent laboratory observations focused on the nucleation process: for example,\nBolton et al. (2023) pointed to key differences in the nucleation process of\nslow and fast labquakes, showing that the evolution in space and time of the\nforeshock activity is linked to fault slip velocity, similar to the increase\nand coalescence of foreshocks/seismic activity that occur prior to large\ncrustal earthquakes (Dodge et al., 1996; Bouchon et al., 2011; Kato et al.,\n2016; 2012; Chen and Shearer, 2013; Brodsky and Lay, 2014; Sugan et al., 2014;\nEllsworth and Bulut, 2018; Yoon et al., 2019; Ben-Zion and Zaliapin, 2020;\nCattania and Segall, 2021).\n\nAnother important study on laboratory earthquakes is the one by Vasseur et al.\n(2017), who documented systematic evidence for a detectable preparatory phase\nto failure in rock samples during laboratory experiments, showing that an\naccurate prediction of the time of occurrence of the catastrophic failure of\nthe sample was possible in most cases, and that its accuracy depended on the\ntypical inter-flaw distance of the material that was being probed. They showed\nthat there are materials with few defects (e.g., glass) for which the time of\noccurrence of the catastrophic failure is inherently unpredictable. This is\nbecause in a sample with a dense distribution of defects, cracks can connect\nadjacent defects when the material is under stress, and the process of\ncatastrophic failure is at the end of a somewhat smooth coalescence of a\nmyriad of individual cracks. A very homogeneous material, on the contrary, is\ncharacterized by a small number of defects, and for a crack to connect two\ndistant flaws the sample needs to undergo a large stress that may easily\nsurpass its very strength.\n\nBut how can we go from the centimetric laboratory scale to the tens or the\nhundreds of kilometers of a large crustal mainshock? Assuming that such a\nscaling operation is feasible, during the latter portion of the seismic cycle\nwe expect that crustal rocks are subjected to a dramatic process of\ncoalescence of suitably oriented cracks within the volume that immediately\nsurrounds the fault plane. As a consequence, we expect substantial changes in\ncrack density, with spatial and temporal fluctuations of the population of\ncracks of different dimensions, which would significantly impact the\npermeability of rocks, the anelastic attenuation of seismic waves, and\npossibly any deep non-volcanic tremors in an area (NVT), when they exist\n(Nadeau and Dolenc, 2005; Nadeau and Guilhem, 2009).\n\nAlthough we think that detecting the exponential slip acceleration observed by\nBletery and Nocquet (2023) would be very useful in practice, monitoring the\nevolution of other physical parameters during the entire earthquake cycle, in\nabsence of slip, could provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of the\nstress on the fault, and, more generally, on the physics of earthquakes and\nfaulting. One of such parameters of interest is the non-geometric attenuation:\nQ\u22121S(t,f).\n\nIf we want to use anelastic attenuation to monitor stress changes and crack\ncoalescence within crustal rocks, we need to understand the role of crustal\nfluids in seismic attenuation. In fact, pore fluids in crustal rocks define\nthe anelastic attenuation of seismic waves (O\u2019Connell and Budiansky, 1977),\nand more importantly they may dominate the evolution of the strength of a\nfault during the latest portion of its seismic cycle through diffusion\n(Sibson, 2009; Lucente et al., 2010; Scholtz, 2019; Malagnini et al., 2022).\nThe variability of anelastic attenuation over time is dominated by the\nfluctuations of rock\u2019s bulk permeability (Malagnini and Parsons, 2020), and\ncan be used to study interesting aspects of single- and multi-mainshock\nseismic sequences (Malagnini et al., 2022; Lucente et al., 2010; D\u2019Amico et\nal., 2010).\n\nPrevious work by Malagnini et al. (2019) and Malagnini and Parsons (2020)\ndemonstrated that fluctuations of non-geometric crustal attenuation (not\nincluding site-related effects) are intimately related to crustal rocks\u2019 bulk\npermeability, and thus to the state of stress they undergo. The cited authors\nexplored the following causal relationships: (i) between perturbations of\nstress (tectonic, seasonal, tidal) and perturbations of Q\u22121S, that is:\n\u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)), and (ii) between shaking-induced changes in rock bulk\npermeability and perturbations \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)). Such damage and healing processe\nwere noted by Kelly et al. (2013), and processes of removal/redeposition of\ncolloidal deposits in rock pores and cracks may also be influential (Roeloffs,\n1998; Liu and Manga, 2009).\n\nAbout relationships of the kind (i) listed above, the modeling effort\nundertaken by Johnson et al. (2017) about hydrospheric, thermal, and tidal\nloading cycles on the faults of California allowed Malagnini and co-workers to\ninterpret the specific spectral peaks of the attenuation time histories, and,\nmore importantly, to indirectly estimate the extreme sensitivity of seismic\nattenuation to stress changes. About relationships of the second kind (ii),\ntheir interpretation was based on the studies by Brodsky, Manga, and co-\nworkers (e.g., Brodsky et al., 2003; Manga and Brodsky, 2006; Liu and Manga,\n2009; Manga et al., 2012), and were also backed by results of numerical\nexperiments (Barbosa et al., 2019).\n\nOur hypothesis is that the changes in rock bulk permeability that take place\nduring the pre-critical stage of the seismic cycle (dilatancy) must have\ndetectable signatures on the anelastic contribution to the total seismic\nattenuation. It is conceivable that the increased permeability along the very\nfault plane under subcritical conditions (Townend and Zoback, 2000) allows\npore pressure to diminish immediately below the fault, at the upper limit of\nNVT depths (in Central California, tremor activity characterizes a planar\npatch at depths between 10 and 40 km, see Guilhem and Nadeau, 2012). Pore\npressure diminution at NVT depths would correspond to a decrease in NVT, and\nto an upward pore fluid migration that would take place along the fault plane.\nIn turn, the latter could weaken the fault segment studied here, and\nfacilitate the occurrence of a mainshock. In what follows we will try to\nsubstantiate this hypothesis by looking for correlations between Q\u22121S and NVT\nactivity.\n\nWhen the fault belongs to a system like the one responsible for the 2016\nsequence of Amatrice-Visso-Norcia (Central Italy), a major issue about\nrecognizing the signature of criticality on seismic attenuation is represented\nby its geometric complexity. In fact, multiple individual structures of such a\nsystem could go critical one after the other, and fail in a cascade of\nmultiple mainshocks, each one with its own preparatory phase, shaking-induced\ndamage, and healing phase, with all these phenomena partially overlapping in\ntime.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n### 2.1 Technique\n\nThe technique used in this study is made of two distinct parts. First, there\nis the calculation of the average attenuation parameter as a function of\nfrequency (<Q\u22121S(f)>) and the maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio by\nusing the peak values of narrowband-filtered time histories instead of the\ncorresponding Fourier amplitudes. Both parts are described in detail in\nSupplementary Appendix SA, as well as the computation of the variability of\nthe attenuation parameter as a function of time (\u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f))).\n\n### 2.2 The Parkfield transitional segment of the San Andreas Fault:\ncharacteristics and data set\n\nTo avoid the complications of a fault system like that of the Central\nApennines, we chose the transitional segment of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) at\nParkfield because of its very simple geometry and behavior. In facts, the\nParkfield fault segment is a vertical, relatively isolated stretch of a\nstrike-slip fault that produces frequent quasi-periodical M6 events that break\nthe very same asperity and contains deeper NVT just beneath the seismogenic\nzone.\n\nThe Parkfield transitional segment of the SAF connects the creeping section of\nthe SAF, to the NW, to its locked section to the SE (see map in Figure 1A).\nThe latter was responsible for the 7.9 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake (Sieh,\n1978a; b; Agnew and Sieh, 1978). Due to a pseudo-regularity of its seismic\ncycle, the transitional segment of the SAF underwent several mainshocks with\nan average recurrence time of \u223c22 years, including the 1966 earthquake. This\nstretch of the SAF has been thoroughly studied and instrumented, starting in\nthe mid 1980s, with the goal of gathering data from short distances from the\nnucleation region of the next M6 earthquake. Bakun and McEvilly (1984)\nproposed that such M6 characteristic earthquakes would repeat every 22 years,\nnucleate at a common hypocenter, and always rupture the same fault area,\nreleasing the same amount of energy. Map in Figure 1A shows the 2004\nearthquake.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. (A) map of the region, showing the background seismicity and four\nmainshocks of specific interest in this study (white stars), whose focal\nmechanisms are indicated in (B). The four mainshocks are the following: i) the\n2003 M6.5 San Simeon earthquake, ii) the 1966 M6 Parkfield mainshock, iii) the\n2004 M6 Parkfield mainshock, and iv) the 1983 M6.8 Coalinga event. Focal\nmechanisms in B are provided by the United State Geological Survey (USGS). (C)\ni) black dots: epicentral locations of the SAF earthquakes used in this study;\nii) white triangles: seismic stations of the HRSN. The frame of C is outlined\nin white in the regional map (A), and the white stars of the 1966 (upper) and\n2004 (lower) mainshocks.\n\nThe importance of the quasi-periodical Parkfield earthquakes was widely\nacknowledged, and the area was heavily instrumented with a state-of-the-art\nseismic network. The High-Resolution Seismic Network (HRSN, see\nhttps://ncedc.org/hrsn/, and map in Figure 1C) was installed to closely\nmonitor the Parkfield asperity, Spudich and Oppenheimer (1986) recognized its\ncapability of electively distinguish and reject energy coming from unwanted\nazimuths, eliminating the complications due to scattered energy, and making it\npossible to analyze high-frequency ground motions (1\u2013100 Hz) in terms of\nrupture behavior. Because of their signal-to-noise ratios, only waveforms from\nthe borehole stations of the HRSN are used in this paper.\n\n#### 2.2.1 Seismic data from earthquakes of the transitional segment\n\nThe interest in the Parkfield transitional segment of the SAF was also driven\nby the idea that seismologists would have collected signals from the final\nstage of its seismic cycle (Bakun et al., 2005; Kagan, 1997; Mileti and\nFitzpatrick, 1992; Roeloffs, E., & Langbein, 1994; Bakun and Lindh, 1985).\nAlthough the HRSN was shut down between June 1998 and early 2001, due to lack\nof funding, it luckily recorded seismic data during the occurrence of the 28\nSeptember 2004 M6 mainshock and kept working in continuous mode up to present\ndays.\n\nData from the HRSN allowed researchers to see the occurrence of entire\nfamilies of repeating earthquakes (Nadeau et al., 1995; Nadeau and Johnson,\n1998; Beeler et al., 2001), which were used as a network of creep meters at\ndepth to estimate deep fault slip rates (Nadeau and McEvilly, 1999) and the\nscaling of earthquake stress drop, in the hypothesis that the entire\nearthquake slip of each repeater was released seismically (Nadeau and Johnson,\n1998). The predictability of individual repeating earthquakes was studied by\nZechar and Nadeau (2012), the triggering and interaction processes involving\nfamilies of repeating sequences at Parkfield were studied by Nadeau et al.\n(1995) and Chen et al. (2013), and the triggering and interaction processes\ninvolving families of repeating sequences at Parkfield were studied by Chen et\nal. (2013). Finally, the scaling of geodetically based estimates of seismic\nstress drop has been reevaluated by Malagnini et al. (2007) and used to infer\nthe scaling of peak and average seismic stress drops on extended fault\nsurfaces.\n\nBecause of its scientific interest (from the quasi-periodical nature of its\nmainshocks, to the presence of repeating earthquakes, the existence of deep\nnon-volcanic tremor (NVT), etc.), and because it was so heavily instrumented,\nthe Parkfield transitional segment of the SAF was investigated thoroughly, and\nmany issues were discussed: from the possibility of remotely-triggered changes\nin the fault properties due to a distant earthquake (Taira et al., 2009), to\nthe indirect evaluation of the strength of the asperity that is responsible\nfor the M6 mainshocks from a statistical analysis of the seismic catalog\n(Sebastiani and Malagnini, 2020).\n\nThe study by Sebastiani and Malagnini is of particular interest for our\ndiscussion. The authors considered the variance of the spatial center of the\ndaily seismic activity along the transitional segment of the SAF at Parkfield,\ncalculated on a moving time window. They observed an initial linear growth of\nthe variance and interpreted it as due to an increasing frictional engagement\nof the two sides of the SAF. During the first part of the seismic cycle, the\nfrictional engagement outside the asperity goes up to a maximum value, then an\nerosional process of the coupled area of the fault takes over (like what was\ndocumented by Mavrommatis et al., 2017 about the case of the Tohoku-Oki giant\nearthquake of 2011), and linearly reduced the amount of coupled fault surface.\nAs the coupled area reduces in size, the stress is transferred onto the\nadjacent asperity, leading to failure. Growth and decay of the variance are\npseudo-periodically modulated between a common low value and the increasing\n(growing phase) or decreasing (decreasing phase) peak values.\n\nAfter being halted due to a stress perturbation from the 1983 Coalinga\nearthquake (e.g., see Figure 5 of Toda and Stein, 2002), the process promptly\nresumed a virtually unchanged increasing trend. The stable and regular\ndecrease of the variance started in early 1988 allowed a very accurate\nretrospective prediction of the time of occurrence of the 2004 main shock.\nBased on the analysis of the variance of daily seismic activity along the SAF\ncalculated on a moving time window, Sebastiani and Malagnini (2020) forecasted\nthe occurrence of the next mainshock in mid-2024. Updates of their forecast\nare issued every two-three month; because the accuracy of the forecast\nlinearly increases with time as the next earthquake approaches (their Figure\n2), they expect that their most recent time window (7-day width in early 2024)\nto represent a final estimate.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2. (A) In red, the long term rate of non-volcanic tremor NVT (\u223c8,500\ndays) smoothed using a 10-day window (min/day); in black, the cumulative\ntremor activity (min). (B) The detrended cumulative tremor activity. Indicated\nin (A, B) (black dashed lines) are the times of occurrence of the following\nevents: the M6.5 San Simeon, the M6 Parkfield, and the M6 Napa. All these\nearthquakes perturbed the tremor activity at Parkfield. The fourth vertical\nblack dashed line marks the position of a significant drop in the NVT\nactivity, which seems to correspond to a drop in the variance of the\nattenuation parameter on the Pacific side of the SAF (see Supplementary Figure\n6S2). (C) Rate of tremor 10-day smoothed (minutes/day) in the 293-day\n(9.7-month) 7-month time windows: 7 May 2004 - 24 February 2005. (D) Rate of\ntremor 10-day smoothed (minutes/day) in the time window 13 Jun 2023 - 1 April\n2024. Bracketing dates of the two time windows of (C, D) are indicated in (A,\nB) by vertical dashed red lines.\n\nRight before the 2004 mainshock, the attenuation parameter calculated by\nMalagnini et al. (2019) in the immediate vicinity to the transitional segment\nof the SAF at Parkfield showed some monotonic variations at high frequency,\nwhich they interpreted to be stress-induced, and which it occurred during the\nvery last portion of the seismic cycle (the pre-critical state). Their\ninterpretation of the relationship between stress and attenuation was\nstrengthened by the signature left on seismic attenuation by the tensile\nnormal stress change (unclamping, see Johanson and Burgmann, 2010) that was\nsuddenly induced by the M6.5 San Simeon earthquake on the transitional segment\nof the SAF at Parkfield.\n\nThis study repeats the time-domain attenuation analysis performed by Malagnini\net al. (2019) on a much larger data set that spans the time window 2001\u20132023.\nFor the time window 2001\u20132020 we exclusively use waveforms from repeating\nearthquakes from a catalog provided by Li et al. (2023), while for the time\nwindow 2020\u20132023 we analyze seismic waveforms from regular earthquakes (no\nrepeaters) from the NCSS catalog (https://ncedc.org/ncedc/catalog-\nsearch.html). The map in Figure 1C shows the spatial distribution of the\nmicroearthquakes and of the seismic stations used in this study. The total\nnumber of earthquakes used here is N_evt=6,851, for a total number of\nwaveforms N_wave=225,557. The subset of non-repeaters is made of N_nr=727\nearthquakes, and the subset of waveforms from the time window 2020\u20132023 is\nN_wave_nr=21,237.\n\nDue to the effective co-location of repeating earthquakes belonging to the\nsame cluster, and to their minimal location errors (at least relative to one\nanother), the use of repeaters contributes to the increase of the signal-to-\nnoise (S/N) ratio of spectral amplitudes. The catalog of all the earthquakes\nused in this study is provided in the Supplementary Material.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Non-volcanic tremors\n\nAn interesting additional observation is the 10-day smoothed rate of non-\nvolcanic tremor (NVT) collected along the transitional segment of the SAF\n(Guilhem and Nadeau, 2012). The long-term NVT rate (\u223c8,500 days, updated\nthrough 15 November 2023) is plotted in red in Figure 2A, the cumulative NVT\nis plotted in black, and its detrended version is shown in Figure 2B. About\n30-day prior to the 2004 Parkfield event a significant NVT foretremor was\nobserved (Nadeau and Guilhem, 2009; Guilhem and Nadeau, 2012). Prior to this\nforetremor, a relatively quiescent period of \u223c120-day of NVT activity was also\nobserved (Figure 2C).\n\nA similar quiescent period also precedes the proposed foretremor of the next\npossible Parkfield M6 (Figure 2D). This 120-day quiescence is unusual for the\nmajority of NVT episodes throughout the long-term NVT catalog (Figure 2A). The\ntwo pairs of dashed red vertical lines in Figures 2A, B correspond to the time\nwindows of Figures 2C, D.\n\nOther studies have shown marked relationships of NVT to the seismic cycle. For\nexample, Brenguier et al. (2008) found that NVT activity in the Parkfield area\nin California reveals that large earthquakes induce long-term perturbations in\nthe San Andreas fault zone including NVT activity. The 2003 San Simeon and\n2004 Parkfield earthquakes induced an increased NVT activity along the San\nAndreas fault. After the Parkfield earthquake, NVT activity remained elevated\nfor more than 3 years and decayed over time, similarly to afterslip derived\nfrom GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements (Brenguier et al., 2008;\nFigure 3). These observations indicate that NVT activity is related to co-\nseismic damage in the shallow layers and to deep co-seismic stress change and\npostseismic stress relaxation within the San Andreas fault zone.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3. (Results from Malagnini et al., 2019). Logarithms of total\nattenuation experienced by direct S waves along the transitional segment of\nthe SAF at Parkfield, between 4 and 12 km of hypocentral distance. Data points\nshown here are assimilable to the log10 of spectral amplitude ratios at the\nindicated central frequencies of 42.2 and 50.0 Hz. Total attenuation increases\ntowards increasingly negative numbers. Attenuation is calculated on the two\nopposite sides of the SAF: Pacific side at the top, North American side at the\nbottom. Indicated by SS and PA are the times of occurrence of the 22 December\n2003 M6.5 San Simeon earthquake, and the 28 September 2004 M6.0 Parkfield\nmainshock.\n\nAnother example of NVT behavior relative to the seismic cycle of smaller\nquakes is also evident. Guilhem and Nadeau (2012) showed in their Figure 5\nthat earthquakes above M2.6 are essentially absent during NVT episodes but\nthat just after the episodes, the frequency of quakes above M2.6 are\nsignificantly accelerated.\n\n### 2.3 Are we critical yet? some questions\n\nThe abstract states four intriguing questions about the earthquake cycles that\nwere observed at Parkfield, with a special interest in the current one, and\nabout the dynamic and kinematic characteristics of the next mainshock. In what\nfollows we will try to give an answer to each one of them.\n\n#### 2.3.1 Question (i): does a detectable preparation phase for the Parkfield\nmainshocks exist?\n\nFigure 2A suggests the presence of an anomaly in the tremor rate at Parkfield,\nwhich we call foretremor, between 15 and 30 days before the 2004 mainshock. A\nsimilar anomaly (another foretremor?) seems to characterize the tremor rate in\nrecent weeks (Figure 2B). Observations shown in Figure 2 are intriguing,\nalthough we cannot produce solid proof of the recent anomaly being a\nforetremor.\n\nFigure 3 (modified from Malagnini et al., 2019) shows the behavior of total\nattenuation between the hypocentral distances of 12 and 4 km. Plots are\nrelative to the latest portion of the earthquake cycle that ended with the\n2004 mainshock of 28 September 2004: they show the logarithms of the ratios\nbetween spectral amplitudes taken at the two specific hypocentral distances of\n12 and 4 km (the more such logarithms are negative, the stronger the\nattenuation).\n\nWhereas the total attenuation increases on the Pacific side of the SAF, with\nan instantaneous increase at the occurrence of the San Simeon earthquake, an\nopposite trend characterizes the North American side of the fault. Malagnini\net al. (2019) explained this behavior with a cartoon (their Figure 5), in\nwhich it is evident that, at least in terms of seismic attenuation, the\ninterseismic period on the two sides of the SAF are somehow opposite, with the\nPacific side of the SAF characterized by an increasing extensional stress with\nrespect to its North American counterpart. The latter shows only a step-like\ndecrease in correspondence to the San Simeon event, because its attenuation\ntime history must be thought of in terms of the coupling existing with the\nopposite (Pacific) side of the SAF.\n\nA complete graphic description of the seismic attenuation in the entire\nfrequency band investigated here (2\u201350 Hz), in the time window between\n01/01/2001 and 01/01/2005, is given in Figure 4 (Pacific side of the SAF on\nthe left, North American side of the SAF on the right). The Figure provides\n3-D plots of the anomalies of the attenuation parameter \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f )) as a\nfunction of time and frequency), with respect to the time-averaged attenuation\nparameter calculated in the time window between 01/01/2001 and 09/28/2004 (the\nday of the occurrence of the Parkfield mainshock).\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 4. Variations of the attenuation parameter as a function of time,\n(\u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f))), in the time window 01/01/2001\u201301/01/2005. Anomalies are\ncomputed with respect to the average attenuation parameter \u3008\u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f))\u3009t\ncalculated between 01/01/2004 and 28/09/2004 (the occurrence of the Parkfield\nmainshock). (A) Pacific side; (B) North American side. The North America side\nof the fault is characterized by a low-frequency (2\u20135 Hz) deep negative\nanomaly that starts around the spring of 2003, gradually reaches a zero value\naround the beginning of June 2004, and has a sharp acceleration that\nculminates right before the mainshock. We note that a very similar pattern\ncharacterizes the anomalies of the opposite, Pacific side of the fault. The\npost-mainshock time history is characterized by relatively large, positive and\nnegative swings of the attenuation parameter around the pre-mainshock time-\naveraged value.\n\nWith Figure 5 we try to extract more specific information on two frequency\nbands at the two ends of the investigated spectrum: 2\u20135 and 30\u201350 Hz. The\nquantities shown in Figure 5 are the stacked attenuation values that were\ncalculated in the central frequencies contained in the mentioned bands (in\nTable 1, the investigated central frequencies grouped in the band named \u201cLow\u201d\nare the ones that were used to obtain the 2\u20135 Hz stacked and across-frequency\naveraged time history, and those in the band named \u201cHigh\u201d are the ones used to\nobtain the 30\u201350 Hz stacked and across-frequency averaged time history). Of\ngreat interest is the bifurcation of the stacked attenuation time histories\n(Low and High frequency bands) that can be observed starting a couple of\nmonths before the 28 September 2004, Parkfield mainshock.\n\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 5. Stacked-averaged estimates of time histories of the variation of the\nattenuation parameter (\u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f))) in two frequency bands: 2.0\u20135.0 Hz\n(black, left scale) and 30\u201350 Hz (red, right scale). In (A, B), the stacked-\naveraged values of the attenuation parameter are plotted in a 3-year time\nwindow (01/01/2002 through 01/01/2005), whereas (C, D) show the stacked-\naveraged attenuation time histories between 01/01/2005 and the fall of 2023.\nIn each pair of panels, (A\u2013D), the upper plot is relative to the attenuation\nparameter on the Pacific side of the SAF, the lower plot to the North American\nside of the SAF. It is clear the effect of the 2003 San Simeon earthquake,\nwhich was described in detail by Malagnini et al. (2019). SS, PA and NA\nindicate, respectively, the occurrences of the San Simeon, Parkfield, and Napa\nearthquakes. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the same information for two\nintermediate frequency ranges: 5\u201310 and 12\u201326 Hz, where no splitting is\nobserved before the 2004 earthquake.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Left column: \u201cname\u201d of the specific central frequency, as it enters\nthe regression code. Central column: central frequency in Hz. Right column:\npartition of the available spectrum. Low- and High-frequencies are\ninvestigated in the main text. Results from the \u201cIntermediate\u201d bands are shown\nin the Supplementary Material.\n\nAt the time of the mainshock, the bifurcations of Figure 5 show a rebound\neffect on both frequency bands, on both sides of the SAF. Such a phenomenon,\nif we do not consider the effects of damage, which is especially effective at\nlow frequencies, indicates a tendency for the crack density distribution at\nlow frequencies (2\u20135 Hz) to move towards a crack density more suitable to an\nearly stage of the seismic cycle.\n\nFollowing Sebastiani and Malagnini (2020), who provided a forecast for the\nnext Parkfield mainshock via the analysis of the variability of the variance\nof the daily center of the seismic activity along the transitional segment of\nthe SAF in the time window between 1973 and late 2019, we look at the\nvariability of the variance of the attenuation anomalies as a function of\ntime.\n\nVariances are computed over subsequent subsets of attenuation anomalies.\nSubsets are obtained as follows: after a number of samples is chosen (e.g.,\n40), we look at the longest time window needed to gather 40 subsequent data\npoints, then we apply that length to all the time windows that we analyze.\n\nIn each time window we randomly choose a subset of 40 data points to be used\nto compute the variance. We randomly choose 10% of data points to be\neliminated from each subset and do multiple estimates of variance by looping\nthrough this bootstrap step of the analysis several times (10). We finally\naverage all variance determinations. Time windows are moved, one data point at\na time, toward more recent times. The analysis done without applying the\nbootstrapping/averaging technique yields very similar results. In Figure 6\nplot the average variances, normalized by the length of the time window. We\npoint out that a single estimate of variance does not differ much from what we\npresent here.\n\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 6. Variance of the stacked attenuation time histories of Figure 5\ncalculated on adjacent subsets of 40 data points. Note that (A, B), at the end\nof the previous seismic cycle, the San Simeon earthquake completely shuts off\nthe variance of the attenuation time histories on both sides of the fault.\nBefore being shut-off, variance is characterized by an increasing trend on the\nPacific side of the fault (the entire year 2003). During the current cycle (C,\nD), in the decade 2010\u20132020, an increasing trend is observed on the variance\non the Pacific side of the SAF. The different time scales available before and\nafter the main earthquake of 2004 do not allow a fair comparison, although the\npeak amplitudes of the variance time histories in the two periods are quite\nsimilar, as well as the amplitudes of the variance past San-Simeon earthquake,\nand of that past the year 2021. SS, PA and NA indicate, respectively, the\noccurrences of the San Simeon, Parkfield, and Napa earthquakes. Supplementary\nFigure S2 shows a plot of the variance in two intermediate frequency ranges:\n5\u201310 and 12\u201326 Hz. Comparing this Figure with Figure 2 we see a correspondence\nbetween the variance drop and a significant reduction of tremor activity in\n2020, suggesting that the seismic attenuation (and possibly the main seismic\nactivity) is modulated by the NVT rate.\n\nIt is crucial to state that the attenuation time histories showed here in\nFigures 4\u20136, are causal with respect to the three earthquakes indicated\ntherein: San Simeon, Parkfield, and Napa (all these events induced changes of\nvarious kinds along the transitional segment of the SAF (Nadeau and McEvilly,\n2004; Malagnini et al., 2019). The time histories of the attenuation parameter\nwere separated in different segments divided by the three major events, in\nsuch a way no acausal effects, with respect to the three earthquakes, are\nallowed in our results.\n\nWhat emerges from the visual inspection of Figures 5, 6 is the following:\n\n1\\. In the pre-mainshock time window (Figure 5), a splitting is observed on\nboth sides of the SAF: the stacked attenuation parameter at low-frequency (2\u20135\nHz) increases starting about 6 weeks before the 2004 mainshock, whereas the\nstacked attenuation parameter at high frequency (30\u201350 Hz) diminishes. This\nbehavior is particularly interesting since it documents the signature of the\nvery final stage of the seismic cycle. To our knowledge, no other cases of a\nsimilar phenomenon are documented in the scientific literature.\n\n2\\. Another interesting feature of the stacked time histories on both sides of\nthe SAF, and in both frequency bands, is the reduction of the amplitudes of\nthe fluctuation that can be observed during the previous time history, which\ncould also be the signature of a longer portion of the preparation phase of\nthe 2004 mainshock. The same feature is described in Figures 6A, B, where we\nshow the variance of the stacked attenuation time histories as a function of\ntime. The dramatic drop of variance observed after the San Simeon earthquake\nclearly documents the reduction of the fluctuations experienced by the\nattenuation anomalies right after the San Simeon earthquake.\n\n#### 2.3.2 Question (ii): how dynamically/kinematically similar are the quasi-\nperiodic occurrences of the Parkfield mainshocks?\n\nThe question is: when compared to the final stage of the previous seismic\ncycle of this segment of the SAF, do we see a similar attenuation time\nhistory, or attenuation variance, during the current final stage of the\nseismic cycle? Having defined the signature of the final stage of the seismic\ncycle of the Parkfield transitional segment of the SAF at points n. One and\ntwo in the previous paragraph, we can try to compare the \u201cpreparation phase\u201d\nto the 2004 mainshock to the observations of seismic attenuation done in the\ntime window between 01/01/2005 and present.\n\nThe stacked and averaged attenuation time histories of Figures 5C, D show\nthat, differently from what happened in the pre-2004 mainshock time window\n(between the time of occurrence of the San Simeon earthquake and that of the\n2004 Parkfield mainshock), a reduction of the amplitudes of the anomalies of\nthe attenuation parameter \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f )) as a function of time is observed only\non the Pacific side of the SAF at Parkfield. The current reduction of the\nfluctuation amplitudes (which is confirmed by the analysis of the variance\ngiven in Figures 6C, D) is thus different from the one that ended the previous\nseismic cycle. Two alternative interpretations: (i) we are not yet in the\nfinal stage of the seismic cycle; (ii) if the next mainshock will not share\nthe same nucleation zone of the 2004 mainshock (for example, it will nucleate\nin the same area of the 1966 event, See Figure 1), the differences between\nFigures 5A\u2013D, 6A\u2013D are related to the different nucleation zone.\n\nWe conclude that trying to answer Question (ii) is impossible. However, given\nalso the results by Sebastiani and Malagnini (2020), our preferred hypothesis\nis that the next mainshock will not have the same hypocentral location of the\n2004 one: for example, it could be close to that of 1966.\n\n#### 2.3.3 Question (iii): are some dynamic/kinematic characteristics of the\nnext mainshocks predictable?\n\nAn important dynamic/kinematic characteristic of all Parkfield mainshocks is\nthe location of their nucleation. Given the fact that the two epicenters of\nthe 1966 and 2004 mainshocks were on the opposite ends of the Parkfield\nasperity, where do we expect the epicenter of the next failure to be located?\nWhereas it is possible that the hypocenters of the Parkfield main shocks have\nthe tendency to randomly alternate between the two ends of the transitional\nsegment of the SAF, our answer to Question (iii) is negative.\n\n#### 2.3.4 Question (iv): should we expect the duration of the current\ninterseismic period to be close to the 22-year \u201cundisturbed\u201d average value?\n\nThe past seismic cycle was substantially perturbed in two different instances:\n(i) the occurrence of the M6.5 Coalinga earthquake of 2 May1983 and of the M6\nNu\u00f1ez events of June 11th and 22 July 1983 reduced the Coulomb stress on the\ntransitional segment of the SAF (Toda and Stein, 2002; Sebastiani and\nMalagnini, 2020), and (ii) the occurrence of the M6.5 22 December 2003 San\nSimeon earthquake increased the Coulomb stress on the same fault segment.\nWhereas the Coalinga-Nu\u00f1ez effect is thought to be responsible for the\nanomalous duration of the previous seismic cycle (38 years), the San Simeon\nearthquake accelerated the transitional segment of the SAF toward criticality.\nDuring the current seismic cycle, no static/dynamic stress has been applied to\nthe transitional segment by earthquakes in its proximity.\n\nRecently, Sebastiani & Malagnini (2020) analyzed the variability of the\nvariance of the daily position of the center of the seismicity that occurs\nalong the transitional segment of the SAF and produced a forecast for the\noccurrence of the next Parkfield mainshock. Their \u201cprediction\u201d, based on the\nobservation of the cyclic behavior of the variance variability along the fault\nsegment, was for mid-2004. In their paper, Sebastiani and Malagnini produced a\nretrospective forecast of the 2004 Parkfield mainshock and showed that the\naccuracy of their forecast linearly improved as the time of the mainshock\napproached. Because of the evolution of the accuracy of their results, after\nthe publication of their paper Sebastiani and Malagnini started providing a\ngroup of colleagues with somewhat regular updates of their forecast, and their\nresults have been relatively consistent with their original forecast.\n\nAlthough the Napa earthquake (Figure 5) influenced the nucleation of repeating\nearthquakes, and nonvolcanic tremor (NVT) (Nadeau, 2015; Peng et al., 2015:\nsee cumulative curve of tremor activity below in Figure 2) along the\ntransitional segment of the SAF, it did not appreciably perturb the seismic\nattenuation in the area. Interestingly, the Napa earthquake was about 300 km\naway from Parkfield.\n\nIn summary, we do not expect the current seismic cycle to be substantially\ndifferent from its \u201cundisturbed\u201d time duration of 22 years. Our interpretation\nof the current situation is corroborated by a hint given by the \u201cflattening\u201d\nof the time histories of the attenuation parameter in both frequency bands\n(2\u20135 and 30\u201350 Hz) that is observed since 2020 along the Pacific side of the\nSAF (Figures 5C, 6C). Based on the information provided above, our answer to\nquestion (iv) is positive: we expect the duration of the current seismic cycle\nto be \u201cregular\u201d (i.e., close to the 22-year average value).\n\n#### 2.3.5 Why does the bifurcation appear just once?\n\nAn important question, at least partially unrelated with the set of four\nquestions listed above, is the following: In the hypothesis that we are at the\nend of the current seismic cycle, why the bifurcation observed right before\nthe 2004 mainshock (Figures 5A, B) is still missing at the end of 2023\n(Figures 5C, D)?. One possible explanation is that the mainshock is more than\n6\u20138 weeks away. Another possible explanation is that the next mainshock will\nhave a different hypocentral location, and the splitting seen in Figures 5A,B\nis related to the volume surrounding the nucleation of the 2004 earthquake.\n\n## 3 Discussion\n\nOur understanding of the phenomena described in this study is based on the\nhypothesis that the fluctuations \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)), and those of deep NVT activity,\nprovide information about the state of stress of the crustal rocks that are in\nthe immediate vicinity of the fault surface and for the NVT deep below the\nseismogenic zone, especially about how they evolve over time. The correlation\nbetween 1/Q and the stress acting on the fault was investigated in detail by\nMalagnini and Parsons (2020), and by Malagnini et al. (2022), who related the\nvariability of Q\u22121S to that of the bulk permeability of crustal rocks.\n\nWithin the limits of our hypothesis, a preparatory phase for the Parkfield\nmainshocks could be detected based on the observation of changing NVT activity\nand of some monotonic variations of the attenuation parameter. The idea is\nthat the crack population within crustal rocks has a specific (yet unknown)\nstatistical distribution of dimensions, and that its characteristics vary as a\nfunction of time following the fluctuations of the stress acting upon the\ninvestigated volume.\n\nIn an initial stage in which the crustal rocks gradually undergo an increasing\ndeviatoric stress from an unstressed initial state, the crack density is\nexpected to grow (e.g., Scholz, 2019), the rock bulk permeability is expected\nto increase, and the same is true for the attenuation parameter. In a later\nstage of the seismic cycle, when the fault reaches a subcritical stress level,\ncrack coalescence becomes the dominant phenomenon: some cracks would grow and\ncoalesce, forming the structure where the catastrophic fracture will\neventually take place. The phenomenon of fracture coalescence was studied by\nBolton et al. (2023), who recorded acoustic emissions (AE) in lab samples\nunder stress and concluded that a transition from pervasive to localized\ndeformation must occur within the sample in the lead-up to failure.\n\nIn general, the strain localization produced by crack coalescence would relax\nthe deviatoric stress away from the volume in which coalescence takes place,\nso that the volume surrounding the growing fracture would go into compaction,\nwith a substantial reduction of crack density (Scholz, 2019). It is\nconceivable that the unknown crack distribution would change dramatically\nduring the whole process of crack coalescence and growth of the macroscopic\nfracture, and such changes would be drastic for the portion of the crack\npopulation characterized by some preferred lengths and orientations, with the\nlonger cracks contributing the most to the process. It is conceivable that\nthese processes are linked to the activity rate changes observed by the NVT,\nat least partially.\n\nThe clear bifurcations shown by \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)) in two frequency bands in Figures\n5A, B right before the Parkfield manshock tell us that the crack population\nwithin different frequency bands reacts in two opposite ways to the stress\nreaching a subcritical level. In fact, after a 7 months-long time window,\nstarted on 22 December 2003, of smooth monotonic increase of \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)), the\n30\u201350 Hz stack shows a decreasing attenuation (starting in the month of July\n2004), whereas the 2\u20135 Hz stack shows an opposite trend of increasing\nattenuation. In both cases, the July-September 2004 fluctuations that lead to\nthe bifurcations of Figures 5A, B are much larger than the standard errors of\nthe individual data points of \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)). We point out that since our\ndataset can only yield information about the crustal volume in the immediate\nvicinity to the fault plane, our estimates of \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)) may primarily be\nused as a proxy to fault strength.\n\nBelow 5 Hz the wavefield sampled in this study is dominated by surface waves\n(see Supplementary Figure S3). This makes the bifurcation even more\ninteresting, because long wavelengths from surface waves (0.2\u20131.5 km) do not\nsample a deeper portion of the crust than the 30\u201350 Hz short wavelengths\n(20\u201360 m) from direct S-waves. In fact, it is just the opposite, and the\nincreased attenuation in the 30\u201350 Hz band is partially influenced by the\ndeeper portion of the SAF, where the nucleation of the 2004 earthquake took\nplace, and just above the wide area where the NVT activity takes place. In\nfact, the total attenuation is the integral of the local attenuation\nexperienced along the entire travel path. If the increased attenuation for\nlow-frequency seismic waves is the result of crack opening and interconnection\nrelated to strain localization through the crack coalescence phenomenon, the\ndecreasing attenuation in the high-frequency band is likely the result of the\nclosing cracks in the 20\u201360 m length range, as the stress localizes on the\ngrowing (will-be) catastrophic fracture and relaxes elsewhere.\n\nLikely, the bifurcations seen in Figures 5A, B between the low- and the high-\nfrequency estimates of the stacked attenuation on both sides of the SAF mark\nthe transition of the Parkfield\u2019s asperity to criticality, when the\ncoalescence of cracks gradually evolves into a catastrophic fracture (Scholz,\n2019). The 2\u20135 Hz band describes the attenuation at wavelengths between 0.2\nand 1.5 km, which likely represent the minimum crack lengths participating in\nthe coalescence that takes place along the SAF.\n\nFrom Figures 5A, B we see that the splitting between the low- and the high-\nfrequencies is common to both sides of the SAF in the 6\u20138 weeks before the\nParkfield mainshock. Moreover, the estimates of the attenuation parameter on\nthe Pacific side of the SAF in the two frequency bands (2\u20135 and 30\u201350 Hz)\nfluctuate synchronously, whereas on the North American side of the SAF the two\nfrequency bands show a more irregular behavior, with asynchronous\nfluctuations. These differences are the results of the different fluctuations\nof two subsets of cracks with specific average lengths in the general crack\npopulation and are likely due to the structural differences existing between\nthe crust on the two sides of the SAF. Finally, a synchronous behavior\ncharacterizes both sides of the SAF in the two intermediate frequency bands of\n5\u201310 and 12\u201326 Hz, where the bifurcations are not observed (Supplementary\nFigure S1), indicating that all the action (coalescence/compaction due to\nstress localization/relaxation) is confined within the two extreme bands of\nthe available spectrum.\n\nAnother interesting feature is that the San Simeon earthquake produces a\nchange in all the time histories of the stacked \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)), regardless of\nthe presence of bifurcations: they all suddenly become smooth, with a tendency\nfor a monotonic trend of increasing attenuation parameter. Our hypothesis is\nthat the time window that starts with the occurrence of the San Simeon\nearthquake and ends at the onset of bifurcation (July 2004) contains the first\npart of the crack coalescence process, where the drastic reduction of\n\u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)) observed on both sides of the SAF is the signature of stress\nlocalization in a very narrow volume along the fault surface. We argue that\nthe pre-critical state is marked by the onset of the bifurcation: it starts\nwhen the crack coalescence (stress localization) is strong enough to allow\ncompaction away from the growing fracture, where the stress that acts within\nthe narrow volume surrounding the macroscopic fracture can relax.\n\nAbout the differences between the time histories \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)) on the two sides\nof the SAF, we point out that the SAF at Parkfield puts in contact two very\ndifferent geological structures, with granite on the west and the\nmetamorphosed Franciscan formation on the east. However, at the end of a\nperiod of smoother variability of the attenuation parameters, the same\nbifurcation appears on both sides of the SAF, reinforcing our hypothesis of\nstress localization and volume compaction.\n\n### 3.1 The current situation\n\nFrom the visual inspection of Figures 6C, D, we cannot find signs about the\nParkfield asperity having reached its critical state yet, even though a phase\nsimilar to the one started by the San Simeon earthquake seems to emerge in\nFebruary-April 2021 only on the Pacific side of the fault, with smoother time\nhistories of the stacked \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)). A plausible explanation of the fact\nthat no clear signs of criticality can currently be pointed out, unlike during\nthe last 9 months of the previous seismic cycle, is that in December 2003 the\nSan Simeon earthquake gave a dramatic step-like push to the Parkfield segment\nof the SAF (Johanson and Burgmann, 2010) that forced the system to suddenly\ntransition to its pre-critical state. At the end of the current seismic cycle,\non the contrary, the path toward criticality is still driven by smooth\ntectonic loading.\n\nA significant drop in the variance of the attenuation parameter is observed in\nFigure 6C, starting in mid-2021, like the drop shown by Figures 6A, B after\nthe San Simeon earthquake. The difference with the current situation may be\ndue to the absence of a step-like external push toward failure, and the next\nParkfield mainshock may still be imminent. Finally, we note that between 2001\nand the end of 2003 the variance of the attenuation parameter went up\nsignificantly, before dropping at the end of 2003, in coincidence with the\noccurrence of the San Simeon earthquake. A somehow similar increase in\nvariance started in 2011 and lasted roughly until the beginning of 2020.\nFinally, in mid-2021 the variance of the attenuation parameter on the Pacific\nside of the SAF went down to very small values and never recovered its level\never since.\n\n## 4 Conclusive remarks\n\nThis study aims at the recognition of the pre-critical state of the\ntransitional segment of the SAF at Parkfield, in the hypothesis that the\nfluctuations of the attenuation parameter represent a proxy for the stress\nconditions in the crustal volume crossed by an active fault. We argue that,\nalong the fault segment under scrutiny, the signature of the pre-critical\nstate of the 2004 mainshock is represented by the variations in opposite\ndirections of the low- and the high-frequency attenuation parameters as a\nfunction of time (low-frequency attenuation increases sharply, high-frequency\nattenuation decreases). The bifurcations are observed on both sides of the\nfault, and last 6\u20138 weeks. The pre-critical state of the Parkfield asperity\nemerges after a period of smooth variability of the attenuation parameter that\nlasts for about 1 year.\n\nThe bifurcation of the stacked seismic attenuation is the result of the\ndifferent trends followed by the populations of cracks in the two ranges of\nfrequency at both ends of the available spectrum: 2\u20135 and 30\u201350 Hz. To\ninteract with the seismic energy, cracks\u2019 lengths must form permeability\nstructures with dimensions comparable to the wavelengths carried by the\nseismic radiation: 400\u20131,500 m for the 2\u20135 Hz band, and 60\u2013100 m for the 30\u201350\nHz band. Cracks in the permeability structures whose dimensions are comparable\nto the short-wavelength radiation tend to close because crack coalescence\ncauses strain localization into the macroscopic fracture, and compaction and\nstress relaxation in the surrounding volume. The long-wavelength radiation, on\nthe contrary, gets more attenuated because the longer cracks that dominate the\ncoalescence process increase the bulk permeability in the volume immediately\naround the fault plane by enhancing their aperture and interconnection.\nFinally, the 2\u20135 Hz band is dominated by surface waves that sample a shallower\ncrustal structure than the direct S-waves of the 30\u201350 Hz band.\n\nAnother important property of the attenuation parameter in 2004 is the sudden\nreduction of its variance \u03c32[\u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f))] on both sides of the SAF, starting\nright after the occurrence of the San Simeon earthquake. A similar reduction\nof 2 [(1/Q)] can be observed starting at the beginning of 2021 on the sole\nPacific side of the fault. If we currently are at the end of the seismic\ncycle, the fact that the attenuation signature is different from what observed\nin 2004 may be due to one, two, or all the three following reasons:\n\n1\\. The sudden drop in variance in 2004, which occurred on both sides of the\nSAF, was due to a dramatic acceleration in the process of crack coalescence\nfrom the stress push from the San Simeon earthquake. Once the coalescence is\nmature, further changes in stress would not change the permeability structure,\nresulting in smoother time histories. Nothing like that occurred recently, and\nit is possible that the variance will go down gradually on both sides of the\nSAF in the next few months, following a gradual increase in the tectonic load.\n\n2\\. The preparation phase of the next earthquake is going to result in a\nnucleation like the one of the 1966 earthquake. If this is the case, the\nattenuation signature may be different from what we observed in 2004,\ndepending on the hypocentral location of the next earthquake.\n\n3\\. The drop in variance observed in 2020\u20132021 on the Pacific side of the SAF\nseems to correspond to a substantial drop in the NVT activity (Figure 2),\nsuggesting that NVT plays an important role in modulating seismic attenuation.\nIf the latter shows a precursory behavior, then it is likely that the NVT\nactivity modulates the main seismic activity of the transitional segment of\nthe SAF, and an important property of the NVT activity during the 2004\nsequence is the precursory quiescence of about 120-day, and the subsequent\nforetremor leading up to a Parkfield mainshock. If we currently are at the end\nof the seismic cycle, a quiescence followed by a possible foretremor episode,\nlike that of the 2004 Parkfield mainshock, may result from the changing\nconditions of crack growth and its attenuation properties.\n\nAbout the intertwined behavior of \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)) and the NVT activity, it is\npossible that the increased permeability along the very fault plane under\nsubcritical conditions allows pore pressure to diminish at NVT depth (in our\ncase, this would correspond to the observed decrease in NVT activity that\nstarts in 2020), and to an upward pore fluid migration along the fault plane.\nIn turn, the latter may weaken the fault and facilitate the occurrence of the\nmainshock. Within the limits of this hypothesis, monitoring the fluctuations\nof NVT activity along the SAF would be useful in recognizing the pre-critical\nstate of the fault.\n\nThe quiet period preceding the 2004 mainshock is consistent with our idea of\nupward fluid migration, and with the twofold role of the latter: (i) a lower\npore pressure at NVT depth that inhibits the tremor activity; (ii) the\nincreased pore-fluid pressure upward that lowers the fault strength and\nfacilitates the nucleation of the mainshock. Likely, the pre-mainshock\nvariability of the attenuation parameter is small due to the stabilizing\naction of strain localization upon \u03b4(Q\u22121S(t,f)). What causes a foretremor\n(i.e., a sharp increase in NVT with limited duration, occurring after a quiet\nperiod) is not clear, and the time lag between a foretremor and the mainshock\nmay correspond to the diffusion time needed to reach a sufficient pore-fluid\npressure along the fault. Consistently with our hypothesis, larger events\n(that primarily occur above the tremor zone) do not occur during the actual\ntimes of most tremor episodes. Rather, there is a definite tendency for the\nlarger events to occur after the tremor episodes by a few days throughout the\nlonger-term period (Figure 5 of Guilhem and Nadeau, 2012; Supplementary Figure\nS4 of the Supplementary Material of the same paper).\n\nIn the next few months (or years) the Parkfield segment of the SAF will\nprovide most of the answers to our questions. In the meantime, it may be\nworthwhile applying our technique on different tectonic settings characterized\nby more complex fault geometries and ongoing NVT activity. Aside from more\nadvanced theoretical developments and laboratory experiments on seismic\nattenuation at increasing differential stresses, the most important ingredient\nfor a successful use of attenuation and NVT information would be the use of\ndata from dense seismic networks equipped with borehole sensors, recording at\nhigh sampling rate (250\u2013500 sps for borehole stations; max 200 sps for surface\ninstruments, see Malagnini et al., 2021).\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
