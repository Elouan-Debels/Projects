We know the countries, the\noceans.\n\nBut beneath those oceans is something rarely seen. A technological marvel.\n\nAn underwater information superhighway, a global web of nearly 500 cables that\nlace the contours of the ocean floor.\n\nGlobe with cables\n\nEvery viral meme, every email, every Facebook post, every chart-topping hit,\nevery internet site, every online banking transaction ... they all rely on\nthis network.\n\nThey don\u2019t come through the air. Satellites only provide a fraction of the\ndata you use. Most of it comes through this underwater cable network, the\nplumbing of the internet itself.\n\nCommunications company TeleGeography has mapped these cables, showing how they\ncrisscross the globe, tying countries together.\n\nThose ties begin on a beach, the starting point for everything anyone around\nthe world does, says, or sees online.\n\nThis particular one is Narrabeen Beach in Sydney. It\u2019s a beautiful stretch of\ncoastline just over 3 kilometres long, renowned for iconic surf breaks which\nhave been the breeding ground for some of the world\u2019s best surfers.\n\nBut it\u2019s also far more than that. It\u2019s a gateway. A number of cables reach out\ninto the ocean from the beach, buried under sand closer to shore to keep them\nsafe.\n\nGlobe with cables in the Pacific\n\nIt\u2019s just one point on Australia\u2019s east and west coasts that are landing\npoints for these cables, which connect to the world via the Pacific.\n\nThe Gondwana Cable extends to New Caledonia; the Southern Cross Cable to the\nUS via Fiji and Hawaii; the APNA Cable to Japan, the PPC-1 Cable to Guam and\nthe APNG Cable to Papua New Guinea.\n\nOnly a little further south, in Brookvale, is the cable landing station for\nthe JGA South cable, a network that takes us far from the east coast of\nAustralia, up to Guam, where it connects to the JGA North cable and branches\nto Hong Kong, Japan, and Los Angeles via Hawaii.\n\nThese cables aren\u2019t thick. They\u2019re only about the width of a garden hose, and\na case of plastic and steel protects glass fibres as thin as a strand of hair\nthat carry the world\u2019s information as tiny pulses of light.\n\nA diagram showing the make-up of an undersea cable. ABC News\n\n\u201cMost people think they use their phones and things go through the air\nmagically around the world across the continents,\u201d said Alan Mauldin, research\ndirector at TeleGeography.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t. They go under the bottom of the ocean floor.\n\n> \u201cSo, whenever you use your phone, it\u2019s going from your phone to a cell tower\n> or a Wi-Fi router to a terrestrial cable into a cable under the ocean\n> between Australia and Asia, Asia to Europe to the Americas.\u201d\n\nThe network \u2013 and the data it contains \u2013 is incredibly valuable. It powers\nalmost every aspect of our modern life. But it\u2019s also key for governments,\nintelligence agencies, and technology giants.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a worldwide struggle for control, happening under the radar \u2013 and\nunder the ocean.\n\nTo the east of Australia, mother nature gave Tonga a terrifying experience of\nlife completely cut off from the internet. In December 2021, around 65km north\nof Tonga\u2019s main island Tongatapu, an underwater volcano began to erupt.\n\nHunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u02bbapai sent plumes of ash into the air, and nearly four\nweeks later, reached an explosive conclusion.\n\nOn January 15, it erupted with a force \u201chundreds of times more powerful\u201d than\nthat of Hiroshima\u2019s atomic bomb, sparking tsunamis that swept across the\nPacific.\n\nLittle information about the extent of the damage was known initially because\ncrucially, an undersea cable that connected Tonga to the rest of the world was\ndamaged in the eruption.\n\nAsh in the atmosphere also prevented satellite communication.\n\nFamilies overseas were unable to communicate and see if their loved ones were\nsafe, businesses were paralysed, and no-one was able to send any financial\nassistance back.\n\n\u201cWe were totally black. Totally dark from the internet world for about at\nleast three days,\u201d said Tonga Cable\u2019s Semisi Panuve.\n\nIt took five weeks for the international cable to be fully repaired. In the\nmeantime, Tongans were forced to rely on makeshift satellite connections as\nthe ash slowly cleared.\n\nIt was an example of the vulnerability of this network that is so crucial for\neveryday life.\n\nBut dangers don\u2019t just come from natural disasters.\n\nLike Tongans, the Taiwanese have experience in what it is like to have their\nconnection to the outside world severed.\n\nMyriad cables run through and around Taiwan, a country that nearby China\nconsiders a breakaway province that will eventually come under Beijing\u2019s\ncontrol.\n\nGlobe with China and Taiwan\n\nIt has seen 27 cable breaks in the past five years, which is considered a lot\nby global standards.\n\nOfficially, that\u2019s blamed on Chinese fishing vessels accidentally dragging\ntheir anchors on the sea floor and snapping the cables, which take months to\nrepair.\n\nBut it has been happening so frequently that authorities in Taiwan have\nstarted war-gaming what it would look like to lose their communications with\nthe outside world altogether and what it would mean for domestic security and\nnational defence systems.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer the only country that feels Chinese interference in our\nlocal politics and democracy,\u201d said Taiwanese policy adviser Enoch Wu.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer the country that is subjected to the intellectual property\ntheft that is waged by Chinese actors. We are no longer the only country that\nfaces diplomatic pressure on the world stage ... I think all of us are taking\nthis threat a lot more seriously than we used to.\u201d\n\n## A new \u2018Cold War\u2019\n\nOne country, in particular, is taking China very seriously.\n\nThis is a new cable that is currently being built by US-owned cable laying\ncompany SubCom.\n\nThe South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 6 \u2014 or SE-ME-WE 6 \u2014 will run\nfrom Singapore to France, with almost 20,000 kilometres of fibre running along\nthe ocean floor connecting dozens of countries along the way.\n\nGlobe with SE-ME-WE 6\n\nSubCom is a massive provider \u2014 to illustrate this, we\u2019ve highlighted all their\ncables in blue.\n\nGlobe with SUBCOM cables\n\nThey stretch all over the globe and offer the US massive control over the flow\nof information between countries.\n\nChina\u2019s efforts to replicate this are not yet at the same scale.\n\nBut Chinese Company HMN Tech is the fastest growing company in the space. You\ncan use your finger or your mouse to navigate and explore these competing\nnetworks.\n\nGlobe with HMN Tech cables\n\nThis map could have looked very different. A Chinese consortium was set to\nsnag the multi-million-dollar SE-ME-WE 6 contract three years ago \u2013 a move\nthat would have cemented China\u2019s reputation as the world\u2019s fastest-rising\nsubsea cable builder.\n\nBut the US government blocked it, putting pressure on consortium members and\nsnaring the contract through incentives.\n\nIt\u2019s just one example of at least six private undersea cable deals in the Asia\nPacific region over the last four years where the US has stepped in to keep\nChinese companies from winning the contract or forcing a re-routing of cables\nthat would have directly linked China to the US.\n\nThere's a clear rivalry between the US and China, says journalist Joe Brock.\nABC News\n\nReuters journalist Joe Brock has written several articles on the cable war\nbeing waged between the US and China beneath the waves and described it as \u201ca\nbattle over the plumbing of the global economy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happening now is that the geopolitical rivalry between the US\nand China is so open now. They\u2019re swinging at each other in public, that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s brought these tensions bubbling to the surface,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe South China Sea has been essentially blocked off from US companies so\nthey can no longer run cables through there, so they\u2019re running cables around.\nChinese companies can\u2019t run cables to the US, which is the biggest internet\nmarket in the world.\u201d\n\nChina reportedly plans to build its own cable linking Hong Kong to China\u2019s\nHainan province, before continuing to Singapore, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt\nand France, a $US500 million project that would give China greater reach and\nconnection in the event they\u2019re blocked again in the future.\n\nBut the US is also playing its own game.\n\nAustralia is already well served by connections to the Middle East, so the\nOman Australia Cable, built in 2021 by SubCom and stretching out from the west\ncoast, was something of a curiosity.\n\nBut it\u2019s this detour that\u2019s of interest. It leads to a tiny atoll in the\nmiddle of the Indian Ocean.\n\nGlobe with Diego Garcia labelled\n\nThere\u2019s not much on this lush, tropical island. But there is a US Navy\nlistening station, Diego Garcia \u2013 which explains why the US government\nbankrolled a third of the project.\n\nThese cables are an information gold mine, and both the US and China have\naccused each other of spying on the enormous amounts of data that travel\nthrough every minute.\n\nNot only that but both Washington and Beijing are now working on the\nuncomfortable assumption that cables are susceptible to espionage.\n\nCaught in this struggle between superpowers \u2013 described as \u201cthe new Cold War\nbetween the US and China\u201d \u2013 are the smaller countries between.\n\nIn May 2023, the Chinese government started talks with 10 nations in the South\nPacific, offering loans to help build and expand their communications\nnetworks. The provider would be the Chinese technology giant, Huawei.\n\nHuawei has been banned from building communications infrastructure in most\nWestern countries, because of national security concerns that it would be a\nback door for top secret information to be siphoned off to Beijing \u2013 a claim\nboth the company and the Chinese government have denied.\n\nBut for many developing countries, the Chinese tech titan is an attractive\noption, simply because it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s charm offensive in the South Pacific has prompted\nWashington to take action.\n\nThe United States is backing a new cable connecting several Pacific Islands,\nboosting Washington\u2019s influence in the region.\n\nThe Central Pacific cable would connect American Samoa with Guam and extend up\nto 12 Pacific islands, including Samoa and Fiji...\n\nAnd Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nGlobe with some Pacific Islands labelled\n\nIt\u2019s a tangible sign of the strengthening ties between the US and Pacific\nIsland countries caught in the geostrategic tug-of-war between Washington and\nBeijing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in an incredibly uncomfortable position,\u201d Brock said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re caught between a rock and a hard place. You look at somewhere like\nthe Pacific islands ... where you\u2019ve got countries which are doing deals with\nChina, some countries which are doing deals with the US ... all they want is\nto have the investment in infrastructure like undersea cables.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, they are caught between the US and China, and they then often\nhave to make a choice.\u201d\n\nTech giants like Facebook are also playing a key role in building cables, like\nthe 2Africa connection. Reuters: Rogan Ward\n\nThe choice isn\u2019t necessarily an easy one.\n\nFBI director Christopher Wray described the Chinese counterintelligence threat\nas \u201cmore deep, more diverse, more vexing, more challenging, more comprehensive\nand more concerning than any counterintelligence threat than I can think of\u201d.\n\nBut former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden exposed the US using mass\nmetadata surveillance systems for covert access for its intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough evidence for us to know, 10 years ago, Edward Snowden exposed\nhow easy it was for British and American intelligence agencies to hoover up\ndata,\u201d Brock said.\n\n\u201cWe know that the US and China have accused each other of extracting data.\nThey haven\u2019t denied that they have those capabilities themselves.\u201d\n\nIt may seem like we\u2019re a long way from the tensions between superpowers. Most\nof us just want to be able to watch videos online or read emails without\nhaving to wait too long.\n\nBut in an increasingly connected world, the smallest cable connection \u2013 or the\nlack thereof \u2013 can have a dramatic effect on the lives of millions.\n\nWatch The Cloud under the Sea on ABC iview.\n\nSubmarine cable information supplied by TeleGeography \u2013 see a detailed\ninteractive version of the map.\n\n## Credits\n\n  * Producer: Dan Smith\n  * Developer: Ashley Kyd\n  * Reporter: Michael Reid\n  * Editors: Tim Leslie and Matt Liddy\n\nOdyssey format by ABC News Story Lab\n\n1 / 19\n\nEmpty globe\n\nGlobe with cables\n\nGlobe with cables in the Pacific\n\nA diagram showing the make-up of an undersea cable.
