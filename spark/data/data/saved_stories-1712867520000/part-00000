We\nhave proactively communicated to customers via Fortinet's PSIRT Advisory\nprocess, advising them to follow the guidance provided,\" Fortinet told SC\nMedia in a statement.\n\nFortinet credited security researcher CataLpa of Dbappsecurity Co. Ltd. with\ndiscovering the critical vulnerability.\n\n## Fortinet patches high-severity vulnerabilities in FortiOS, FortiProxy and\nFortiClientMac\n\nFortinet published two additional advisories Tuesday addressing high-severity\nvulnerabilities in three of its other products: FortiOS, FortiProxy and\nFortiClientMac.\n\nOne, tracked as CVE-2023-41677, has a CVSS score of 7.5 and is due to\ninsufficient protection of credentials in FortiOS and FortiProxy.\n\nThis bug could enable an attacker to obtain an administrator cookie \u201cin rare\nand specific conditions,\u201d Fortinet stated, and requires the administrator to\nbe social engineered into visiting a malicious website through the SSL-VPN. A\nfull list of product versions affected by CVE-2023-41677 can be found in\nFortinet\u2019s PSIRT advisory.\n\nThe other flaws, tracked as CVE-2023-45588 and CVE-2024-31492, have a CVSS\nscore of 7.8 and impact FortiClientMac versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.3 and 7.0.6\nthrough 7.0.10. These vulnerabilities exist in the FortiClientMac installer\nand could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code by writing a\nmalicious configuration file in the temporary directory prior to installation.\n\n\u201cA cyber threat actor could exploit some of these vulnerabilities to take\ncontrol of an affected system,\u201d the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) said in an alert about the Fortinet vulnerabilities\npatched Tuesday.\n\nFortinet vulnerabilities are a common target for cyberattackers; 13\nvulnerabilities in Fortinet products are currently included in CISA\u2019s Known\nExploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, including two added in 2024.\n\nMost recently, an SQL injection flaw in Fortinet FortiClient EMS, which is\ntracked as CVE-2023-48788 and has a CVSS score of 9.8, came under active\nexploitation in the wild. eSentire researchers noted an increase in\nexploitation beginning on March 24, in campaigns that included deployment of\nreverse webshells, the ScreenConnect Remote Monitoring and management tool,\nand other persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe eSentire Threat Intelligence team added that there was a high probability\nthat ransomware could be deployed in attacks exploiting CVE-2023-48788. A\npatch for the flaw has been available since March 12.\n\nLaura French\n\n### Related\n\nNetwork Security\n\n##### GitHub search exploited for malware distribution\n\nSC StaffApril 11, 2024\n\nMalware-laced GitHub repositories using popular names and topics are being\nadvanced by threat actors through automated updates and fraudulent stars meant\nto manipulate the leading software developer platform's search rankings as\npart of a new open-source supply chain attack, The Hacker News reports.\n\nNetwork Security\n\n##### Raspberry Robin observed spreading via Windows Script Files\n\nSteve ZurierApril 10, 2024\n\nThe HP Threat Research team says security pros should take note because\nRaspberry Robin has been used to deliver multiple families of malware \u2013 and as\na precursor to ransomware.\n\nNetwork Security\n\n##### Software supply chain risk mitigation sought by new Synopsys solution\n\nSC StaffApril 10, 2024\n\nMounting software supply chain attacks have prompted Synopsys to introduce the\nnew Black Duck Supply Chain Edition software composition analysis solution,\nreports SiliconAngle.\n\n### Related Events\n\n  * Cybercast\n\n##### The Security Experts Next Door: Enterprise Defense on a Lean Budget\n\nOn-Demand Event\n\n  * Virtual Conference\n\n##### Network security: New tools for an aging art\n\nTue Dec 17\n\n### Get daily email updates\n\nSC Media's daily must-read of the most current and pressing daily news\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.
