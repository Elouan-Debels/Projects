Credit: Ben Fractenberg/THE CITY\n\nNew York City\u2019s office market is stalled with the vacancy rate stuck at a\nrecord high, and the best hope for improvement in the near future depends on\nwhether the governor and the legislature can agree on legislation to speed the\nconversion of office space into housing.\n\nReports issued in the past week by the city\u2019s large real estate firms show 20%\nof the 463 million square feet of office space in Manhattan is empty. Another\n5% is so-called sublease space, which means either it is occupied but\navailable for anyone who wants to take it off the tenant\u2019s hands or vacant but\nthe rent is being paid by the tenant until the lease runs out.\n\nThere are some signs of improvement in Midtown, but the vacancy rate remains\nhigh and rents depressed, and the situation is far worse elsewhere in the\nborough.\n\n\u201cThere is Midtown and then there is everything else,\u201d said Michael Slattery,\nresearch manager with the real estate firm CBRE. \u201cThere are pockets that have\nstarted to recover. Park Avenue has a single digit availability rate.\u201d\n\nThe weak office market continues to hamper the city\u2019s economy, even though\ntotal jobs are back to their pre-pandemic level. Long-term, the city is\nexpected to slash the value of many office buildings, which could cost the\ncity $1 billion in tax revenue, according to city Comptroller Brad Lander.\nWhile significant, the $1 billion is only about 1% of the entire budget.\n\nWhile the overall vacancy rate of 20.1% at the end of the first quarter\nremained at a record level, according to CBRE, the numbers for Downtown and\nMidtown South were far worse.\n\nDowntown\u2019s vacancy rate is nearing 23%. New leases totalled only about 600,000\nsquare feet in the first three months of the year, one-third of the long term\naverage, and most of those were for small offices. One-third of all the office\nspace is available for sublease.\n\nThe vacancy rate in Midtown South surged to a record high of more than 24% as\nleasing declined. While New York has seen only modest layoffs from big tech\nfirms compared with what has happened on the West Coast, the tech companies\nthat remain heavily concentrated in the area appear to have become cautious.\n\nMidtown fared the best as financial service firms continued to be willing to\ncommit to office space, especially in new or recently renovated buildings near\ntransit hubs, Slattery notes. Still, the vacancy rate exceeds 18%.\n\nHe adds that \u201ccommodity space\u201d in the city\u2019s older and much less desirable\nbuildings is going begging and that those are the buildings most likely to be\ncandidates for conversion to housing if legislation can clear a series of\nobstacles.\n\nIn January, Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed legislation that would provide a\nproperty tax break for New York City conversions when the owners agree to\ninclude a percentage of affordable apartments, although her proposal did not\ninclude specifics. Increasing the allowed density for residential buildings\nand relaxing some existing requirements for windows and other open space would\nbe crucial as well.\n\nSources with knowledge of the talks in Albany say that the issue remains under\nnegotiation as a deal nears on other major issues in the pending and now\noverdue state budget. Democrats in the legislature have previously been\ninsisting conversions include affordable apartments without a tax break.\n\nWhile not a magic bullet, conversions would help by removing obsolete office\nbuildings from the market. While Downtown continues to have its problems, the\nsituation would be much worse without the many conversions that have happened\nin recent decades.\n\nIn the last several decades, 272 office buildings have been converted to\nhousing, adding 18,000 apartments to the area, according to the Downtown\nAlliance. Lower Manhattan is where most reuse has occurred because many of its\nbuildings were built decades ago with smaller, easier to convert floor plates\nand because existing rules allow them to be renovated.\n\nIn recent months, the owners of 111 Wall Street and 222 Broadway have\nannounced they are converting, reducing supply by 1.5 million square feet.\nThose two buildings alone would have added 2 percentage points to the vacancy\nrate, had they remained office buildings.\n\n\u201cConversions have been part of the story downtown for 30 years and have been\nbeneficial in creating housing and building a 24-hour community,\u201d said Jessica\nLappin, the former City Council person who is now president of the Alliance.\n\u201cWe saw the benefit of that in COVID and we are seeing it now.\u201d\n\n## Sign up for THE SCOOP!\n\nGet the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to your inbox each morning.\nCancel anytime.\n\nShe notes, however, that 70% of those conversions occurred when the city\noffered a major tax break, called 421-G, that provided an exemption from\nproperty taxes during one year of construction and an 80% cut in real estate\ntaxes for 14 years. It expired in 2006.\n\n\u201cWho knows what the future will bring for office leasing,\u201d she said, \u201cso why\nwouldn\u2019t we want more flexibility for office buildings?\u201d\n\nThe administration of Mayor Eric Adams has taken some modest steps on its own\nto help owners including establishing a one-stop office for property owners\nseeking to convert, and zoning changes that would allow residential use in the\nGarment District and seek to expand flexible zoning rules to other parts of\nthe city allowing buildings built before 1990 to be converted.\n\nBut the key remains in Albany. A tax break and the zoning changes could result\nin 20,000 additional apartments over the next decade, according to the\nDepartment of City Planning.\n\n\u201cEmpty and underused office space isn\u2019t good for anybody,\u201d said Dan Garodnick,\nhead of City Planning, in a statement to THE CITY. \u201cOffice conversions offer a\nwin-win for our city: putting space to better use, helping to create more\nvibrant neighborhoods, and of course, creating much-needed housing.\u201d\n\n### Related Headlines\n\nTHE CITY is an independent nonprofit newsroom dedicated to serving the people\nof New York.\n\nQuestions? info@thecity.nyc\n\n## Follow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * RSS Feed\n\n### ABOUT\n\n### TEAM\n\n### FUNDERS\n\n### ETHICS\n\n### DIVERSITY\n\n### DONATE\n\n### CONTACT\n\n### REPUBLISH\n\n### CAREERS\n\n## Subscribe to THE SCOOP\n\nSign up and get everything you need to know to be an active New Yorker\ndelivered to your inbox each morning.
