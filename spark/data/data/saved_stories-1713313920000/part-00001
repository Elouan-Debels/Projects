But full support by Labour's front bench\nensured the measures passed.\n\nThere are still several more steps needed before it becomes law, such as votes\nin the House of Lords, but it is possible that the bill could now become law\nbefore the general election, expected in the second half of 2024.\n\nLabour's shadow health and social secretary Wes Streeting accused Mr Sunak of\n\"putting the bill at risk\" by granting a free vote \"because he is too weak to\nstand up to the Liz Truss-wing of his party\".\n\n\"If we are privileged enough to form the next government, Labour will\nimplement this ban, so young people today are even less likely to smoke than\nthey are to vote Conservative,\" he added.\n\nIn total 57 Tory MPs voted against the bill, including Business Secretary Kemi\nBadenoch and Conservative Party Deputy Chair Jonathan Gullis.\n\nForeign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan also signalled her opposition but\nultimately abstained on the vote.\n\nLee Anderson, an ex-deputy chair of the Conservative Party who defected to\nReform UK last month, also voted against the bill.\n\nMr Sunak used his conference speech in October of last year to unveil his\nplans to ban people born after 1 January 2009 from buying tobacco products.\n\n## 'Free society'\n\nThe debate on Tuesday was MPs first chance to debate the legislation\nimplementing the ban.\n\nMs Truss was one of the first to speak against the bill, telling the House of\nCommons it risked infantilising people.\n\n\"It is very important that until people have decision-making capability while\nthey are growing up that we protect them but I think the whole idea that we\ncan protect adults from themselves is hugely problematic.\"\n\nHer concern was echoed by some of her fellow Conservative MPs.\n\nFormer minister Sir Jake Berry said he was more concerned about \"the addiction\nof the government to telling people what to do\" than he was about people\naddicted to nicotine.\n\n\"I want to live in a free society where I am free to make both good and bad\ndecisions.\"\n\nMs Atkins said she understood their concerns about \"banning things\" but\ndefended the bill arguing: \"Nicotine robs people of their freedom to choose.\"\n\n\"The vast majority of smokers start when they are young, and three quarters\nsay that if they could turn back the clock they would not have started.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, England's chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty said once\npeople become addicted to smoking \"their choice is taken away\".\n\n\"When I was a junior doctor doing surgery I remember the tragedy of seeing\npeople, whose legs had had to be cut off because of the smoking that had\ndamaged their arteries, outside the hospital weeping as they lit up because\nthey were trapped by addiction - that is not choice.\"\n\nThe bill also aims to make vapes less appealing to children, with new\nrestrictions on flavours and packaging.\n\nTrading standards officers would also get new powers to issue on-the-spot \u00a3100\nfines to shops selling tobacco or vapes to children, with all the money raised\ngoing towards further enforcement.\n\nFigures show that one in five children has tried vaping despite it being\nillegal for under-18s, while the number of children using vapes has tripled in\nthe past three years.\n\n## What is the smoking ban and how will it work?\n\n## Disposable bans will not work, says vape boss\n\n## Sunak's smoking ban is nuts, says Boris Johnson\n\nConservative Party\n\nSmoking\n\nVaping\n\nLiz Truss\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nRelated\n\n## Labour reports Tory election leaflet to prosecutors\n\n59 mins ago\n\nLondon\n\n## Susan Hall pledges to expand Night Tube service\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nLondon\n\n## Truss backs Trump to win US presidential race\n\n22 hrs ago\n\nUK Politics\n\nMore\n\n55 mins ago\n\n## What is the smoking ban and how will it work?\n\nThe government wants to stop people smoking by raising the legal age limit for\nbuying cigarettes.\n\n55 mins ago\n\nHealth\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## Government suffers fresh Rwanda Bill defeat in Lords\n\nPeers maintain stand-off with government over flagship controversial Rwanda\ndeportation plan.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nUK Politics\n\n5 hrs ago\n\n## MPs to vote on smoking ban for those born after 2009\n\nRishi Sunak's bill aims to create the UK's first smoke-free generation in a\nmajor public health intervention.\n\n5 hrs ago\n\nUK Politics\n\n6 hrs ago\n\n## MP says she is 'ashamed' she began smoking aged 12\n\nNewbury MP Laura Farris says she will vote in favour of smoking ban for those\nborn after 2009.\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nBerkshire\n\n14 hrs ago\n\n## Six things that stand out for me in Liz Truss book\n\nThe BBC's political editor Chris Mason on what the former prime minister has\nto say about the state of conservatism.\n\n14 hrs ago\n\nUK Politics\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
