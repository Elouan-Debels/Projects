I have no clue\nwhy it's taken me so long to make a Cutting Edge post for it. The build\nprocess (trimming, CAD work, assembly) is documented in my worklog.\n\nThis is an old-school portable with lots of hot glue. I wanted crispy video\nquality, so it uses a Shinobi Scaler to linedouble the PS1's RGB to VGA. But\nother than that, it has no custom PCBs!\n\nFeatures:\n\n  * 181 x 91.5 x 30.25 mm, case printed in white PLA\n  * Original PU-18 PS1 motherboard, cut in half, folded and rewired\n  * 2S1P 3500mAh 18650s with \"red board\"\u2014 ~2.5hrs of battery life\n  * Trimmed Xstation ODE by Robert Neumann (ramapcsx2) with push-push SD card slot and disc tray button\n  * Shinobi Scaler running GBS-Control by ramapcsx2 for impeccably crisp integer scaled 480p VGA (scanlines in 240p mode!)\n  * Dualshock controller with rumble, but no analog sticks. All buttons/triggers use orange squishy tacts\n  * PicoMemcard+ with 16GB microSD for unlimited game saves\n  * Beefy enclosed stereo speakers and PAM8803 amp\n  * Wriststrap loop with official Sony Pocketstation strap!\n\nI wasn't kidding when I said this portable was old-school. It has some major\nproblems!\n\nIssues:\n\n  * No volume controls\n  * Power LED and reset button are not wired up\n  * Latching power button is finicky and accidentally brushing it can turn the unit off\n  * No heatsinks, so it gets nice and toasty after a while\n  * The Shinobi Scaler uses luma as sync and sometimes latches onto composite video noise which makes the picture all noisy. A reboot usually fixes it\n  * No graceful shutdown or smart BMS\u2014 the screen just stops working when the batteries get too low\n\nClose-up pics:\n\nSize comparison with PS Vita 2000\n\nInternals:\n\nAs mentioned above, in order to fit the PU-18 motherboard into this small of a\ncase I had to cut it in half and fold it. Lots and lots of magnet wire!\n\nHere are some photos to demonstrate the amazing video quality Shinobi Scaler\nprovides with both 480i and 240p input.\n\nHere's a video showing the PicoMemcard+ functioning:\n\nThe green LED that shines through the shell is from the PicoMemcard+. It\nflashes red when saves are being written to the SD card. I think it looks\npretty cool in low light, along with the LCD backlight bleed! Also, you can\nmanage the memory cards via Xstation which is cool.\n\nFinally, here's a video showing the process of loading an audio CD after a\ngame ISO, so I can play Vib-Ribbon with a custom song! This was the whole\npoint of using an exotically-trimmed PU-18 since later, smaller motherboard\nrevisions aren't compatible with Xstation or Vib-Ribbon!\n\nMission accomplished!\n\nLast edited: Yesterday at 4:15 PM\n\nUltraWii Sakura \u00b7 Aqua Retro Lite CM4 \u00b7 PS Hanami MaplePad \u00b7 Shinobi Scaler \u00b7\n\u03b1SNES \u00b7 Vegas The Definitive Wii U Trimming Guide\n\nReactions: Skibub28, JMCD, WolfSquatch and 7 others\n\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\n\n  * Home\n\n  * Forums\n\n  * The Lounge\n\n  * The Cutting Edge\n\nMenu\n\nLog in\n\nRegister\n\n\u00a92024 BitBuilt\n\n#### Social Links\n\nBe sure to follow our social media accounts to stay up to date on new videos,\nupdates and more.\n\n  * Discord\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n\n  * BitBuilt Green\n\n  * Help\n  * RSS\n\nForum software by XenForo^\u00ae \u00a9 2010-2020 XenForo Ltd. | Media embeds via s9e/MediaSites\n\nXenPorta 2 PRO \u00a9 Jason Axelrod of 8WAYRUN\n\nDiscord Integration \u00a9 Jason Axelrod of 8WAYRUN\n\nXenForo theme by xenfocus\n\n  * Forums\n  * What's new\n  * Log in\n  * Register\n  * Search\n\nTop\n\n", "frontpage": false}
