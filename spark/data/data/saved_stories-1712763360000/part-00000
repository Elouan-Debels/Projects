Software\nthat can think and learn will do more and more of the work that people now do.\nEven more power will shift from labor to capital. If public policy doesn\u2019t\nadapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today.\n\nWe need to design a system that embraces this technological future and taxes\nthe assets that will make up most of the value in that world\u2013companies and\nland\u2013in order to fairly distribute some of the coming wealth. Doing so can\nmake the society of the future much less divisive and enable everyone to\nparticipate in its gains.\n\nIn the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal\ndocuments and give medical advice. In the next decade, they will do assembly-\nline work and maybe even become companions. And in the decades after that,\nthey will do almost everything, including making new scientific discoveries\nthat will expand our concept of \u201ceverything.\u201d\n\nThis technological revolution is unstoppable. And a recursive loop of\ninnovation, as these smart machines themselves help us make smarter machines,\nwill accelerate the revolution\u2019s pace. Three crucial consequences follow:\n\n  1. This revolution will create phenomenal wealth. The price of many kinds of labor (which drives the costs of goods and services) will fall toward zero once sufficiently powerful AI \u201cjoins the workforce.\u201d\n\n  2. The world will change so rapidly and drastically that an equally drastic change in policy will be needed to distribute this wealth and enable more people to pursue the life they want.\n\n  3. If we get both of these right, we can improve the standard of living for people more than we ever have before.\n\nBecause we are at the beginning of this tectonic shift, we have a rare\nopportunity to pivot toward the future. That pivot can\u2019t simply address\ncurrent social and political problems; it must be designed for the radically\ndifferent society of the near future. Policy plans that don\u2019t account for this\nimminent transformation will fail for the same reason that the organizing\nprinciples of pre-agrarian or feudal societies would fail today.\n\nWhat follows is a description of what\u2019s coming and a plan for how to navigate\nthis new landscape.\n\nPart 1\n\n## The AI Revolution\n\nOn a zoomed-out time scale, technological progress follows an exponential\ncurve. Compare how the world looked 15 years ago (no smartphones, really), 150\nyears ago (no combustion engine, no home electricity), 1,500 years ago (no\nindustrial machines), and 15,000 years ago (no agriculture).\n\nThe coming change will center around the most impressive of our capabilities:\nthe phenomenal ability to think, create, understand, and reason. To the three\ngreat technological revolutions\u2013the agricultural, the industrial, and the\ncomputational\u2013we will add a fourth: the AI revolution. This revolution will\ngenerate enough wealth for everyone to have what they need, if we as a society\nmanage it responsibly.\n\nThe technological progress we make in the next 100 years will be far larger\nthan all we\u2019ve made since we first controlled fire and invented the wheel. We\nhave already built AI systems that can learn and do useful things. They are\nstill primitive, but the trendlines are clear.\n\nPart 2\n\n## Moore's Law for Everything\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two paths to affording a good life: an individual\nacquires more money (which makes that person wealthier), or prices fall (which\nmakes everyone wealthier). Wealth is buying power: how much we can get with\nthe resources we have.\n\nThe best way to increase societal wealth is to decrease the cost of goods,\nfrom food to video games. Technology will rapidly drive that decline in many\ncategories. Consider the example of semiconductors and Moore\u2019s Law: for\ndecades, chips became twice as powerful for the same price about every two\nyears.\n\nIn the last couple of decades, costs in the US for TVs, computers, and\nentertainment have dropped. But other costs have risen significantly, most\nnotably those for housing, healthcare, and higher education. Redistribution of\nwealth alone won\u2019t work if these costs continue to soar.\n\nAI will lower the cost of goods and services, because labor is the driving\ncost at many levels of the supply chain. If robots can build a house on land\nyou already own from natural resources mined and refined onsite, using solar\npower, the cost of building that house is close to the cost to rent the\nrobots. And if those robots are made by other robots, the cost to rent them\nwill be much less than it was when humans made them.\n\nSimilarly, we can imagine AI doctors that can diagnose health problems better\nthan any human, and AI teachers that can diagnose and explain exactly what a\nstudent doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cMoore\u2019s Law for everything\u201d should be the rallying cry of a generation whose\nmembers can\u2019t afford what they want. It sounds utopian, but it\u2019s something\ntechnology can deliver (and in some cases already has). Imagine a world where,\nfor decades, everything\u2013housing, education, food, clothing, etc.\u2013became half\nas expensive every two years.\n\nWe will discover new jobs\u2013we always do after a technological revolution\u2013and\nbecause of the abundance on the other side, we will have incredible freedom to\nbe creative about what they are.\n\nPart 3\n\n## Capitalism for Everyone\n\nA stable economic system requires two components: growth and inclusivity.\nEconomic growth matters because most people want their lives to improve every\nyear. In a zero-sum world, one with no or very little growth, democracy can\nbecome antagonistic as people seek to vote money away from each other. What\nfollows from that antagonism is distrust and polarization. In a high-growth\nworld the dogfights can be far fewer, because it\u2019s much easier for everyone to\nwin.\n\nEconomic inclusivity means everyone having a reasonable opportunity to get the\nresources they need to live the life they want. Economic inclusivity matters\nbecause it\u2019s fair, produces a stable society, and can create the largest\nslices of pie for the most people. As a side benefit, it produces more growth.\n\nCapitalism is a powerful engine of economic growth because it rewards people\nfor investing in assets that generate value over time, which is an effective\nincentive system for creating and distributing technological gains. But the\nprice of progress in capitalism is inequality.\n\nSome inequality is ok\u2013in fact, it\u2019s critical, as shown by all systems that\nhave tried to be perfectly equal\u2013but a society that does not offer sufficient\nequality of opportunity for everyone to advance is not a society that will\nlast.\n\nThe traditional way to address inequality has been by progressively taxing\nincome. For a variety of reasons, that hasn\u2019t worked very well. It will work\nmuch, much worse in the future. While people will still have jobs, many of\nthose jobs won\u2019t be ones that create a lot of economic value in the way we\nthink of value today. As AI produces most of the world\u2019s basic goods and\nservices, people will be freed up to spend more time with people they care\nabout, care for people, appreciate art and nature, or work toward social good.\n\nWe should therefore focus on taxing capital rather than labor, and we should\nuse these taxes as an opportunity to directly distribute ownership and wealth\nto citizens. In other words, the best way to improve capitalism is to enable\neveryone to benefit from it directly as an equity owner. This is not a new\nidea, but it will be newly feasible as AI grows more powerful, because there\nwill be dramatically more wealth to go around. The two dominant sources of\nwealth will be 1) companies, particularly ones that make use of AI, and 2)\nland, which has a fixed supply.\n\nThere are many ways to implement these two taxes, and many thoughts about what\nto do with them. Over a long period of time, perhaps most other taxes could be\neliminated. What follows is an idea in the spirit of a conversation starter.\n\nWe could do something called the American Equity Fund. The American Equity\nFund would be capitalized by taxing companies above a certain valuation 2.5%\nof their market value each year, payable in shares transferred to the fund,\nand by taxing 2.5% of the value of all privately-held land, payable in\ndollars.\n\nAll citizens over 18 would get an annual distribution, in dollars and company\nshares, into their accounts. People would be entrusted to use the money\nhowever they needed or wanted\u2014for better education, healthcare, housing,\nstarting a company, whatever. Rising costs in government-funded industries\nwould face real pressure as more people chose their own services in a\ncompetitive marketplace.\n\nAs long as the country keeps doing better, every citizen would get more money\nfrom the Fund every year (on average; there will still be economic cycles).\nEvery citizen would therefore increasingly partake of the freedoms, powers,\nautonomies, and opportunities that come with economic self-determination.\nPoverty would be greatly reduced and many more people would have a shot at the\nlife they want.\n\nA tax payable in company shares will align incentives between companies,\ninvestors, and citizens, whereas a tax on profits does not\u2013incentives are\nsuperpowers, and this is a critical difference. Corporate profits can be\ndisguised or deferred or offshored, and are often disconnected from share\nprice. But everyone who owns a share in Amazon wants the share price to rise.\nAs people\u2019s individual assets rise in tandem with the country\u2019s, they have a\nliteral stake in seeing their country do well.\n\nHenry George, an American political economist, proposed the idea of a land-\nvalue tax in the late 1800s. The concept is widely supported by economists.\nThe value of land appreciates because of the work society does around it: the\nnetwork effects of the companies operating around a piece of land, the public\ntransportation that makes it accessible, and the nearby restaurants,\ncoffeeshops, and access to nature that makes it desirable. Because the\nlandowner didn\u2019t do all that work, it\u2019s fair for that value to be shared with\nthe larger society that did.\n\nIf everyone owns a slice of American value creation, everyone will want\nAmerica to do better: collective equity in innovation and in the success of\nthe country will align our incentives. The new social contract will be a floor\nfor everyone in exchange for a ceiling for no one, and a shared belief that\ntechnology can and must deliver a virtuous circle of societal wealth. (We will\ncontinue to need strong leadership from our government to make sure that the\ndesire for stock prices to go up remains balanced with protecting the\nenvironment, human rights, etc.)\n\nIn a world where everyone benefits from capitalism as an owner, the collective\nfocus will be on making the world \u201cmore good\u201d instead of \u201cless bad.\u201d These\napproaches are more different than they seem, and society does much better\nwhen it focuses on the former. Simply put, more good means optimizing for\nmaking the pie as large as possible, and less bad means dividing the pie up as\nfairly as possible. Both can increase people\u2019s standard of living once, but\ncontinuous growth only happens when the pie grows.\n\nPart 4\n\n## Implementation and Troubleshooting\n\nThe amount of wealth available to capitalize the American Equity Fund would be\nsignificant. There is about $50 trillion worth of value, as measured by market\ncapitalization, in US companies alone. Assume that, as it has on average over\nthe past century, this will at least double over the next decade.\n\nThere is also about $30 trillion worth of privately-held land in the US (not\ncounting improvements on top of the land). Assume that this value will roughly\ndouble, too, over the next decade\u2013this is somewhat faster than the historical\nrate, but as the world really starts to understand the shifts AI will cause,\nthe value of land, as one of the few truly finite assets, should increase at a\nfaster rate.\n\nOf course, if we increase the tax burden on holding land, its value will\ndiminish relative to other investment assets, which is a good thing for\nsociety because it makes a fundamental resource more accessible and encourages\ninvestment instead of speculation. The value of companies will diminish in the\nshort-term, too, though they will continue to perform quite well over time.\n\nIt\u2019s a reasonable assumption that such a tax causes a drop in value of land\nand corporate assets of 15% (which only will take a few years to recover!).\n\nUnder the above set of assumptions (current values, future growth, and the\nreduction in value from the new tax), a decade from now each of the 250\nmillion adults in America would get about $13,500 every year. That dividend\ncould be much higher if AI accelerates growth, but even if it\u2019s not, $13,500\nwill have much greater purchasing power than it does now because technology\nwill have greatly reduced the cost of goods and services. And that effective\npurchasing power will go up dramatically every year.\n\nIt would be easiest for companies to pay the tax each year by issuing new\nshares representing 2.5% of their value. There would obviously be an incentive\nfor companies to escape the American Equity Fund tax by off-shoring\nthemselves, but a simple test involving a percentage of revenue derived from\nAmerica could address this concern. A larger problem with this idea is the\nincentive for companies to return value to shareholders instead of reinvesting\nit in growth.\n\nIf we tax only public companies, there would also be an incentive for\ncompanies to stay private. For private companies that have annual revenue in\nexcess of $1 billion, we could let their tax in equity accrue for a certain\n(limited) number of years until they go public. If they remain private for a\nlong time, we could let them settle the tax in cash.\n\nWe\u2019d need to design the system to prevent people from consistently voting\nthemselves more money. A constitutional amendment delineating the allowable\nranges of the tax would be a strong safeguard. It is important that the tax\nnot be so large that it stifles growth\u2013for example, the tax on companies must\nbe much smaller than their average growth rate.\n\nWe\u2019d also need a robust system for quantifying the actual value of land. One\nway would be with a corps of powerful federal assessors. Another would be to\nlet local governments do the assessing, as they now do to determine property\ntaxes. They would continue to receive local taxes using the same assessed\nvalue. However, if a certain percentage of sales in a jurisdiction in any\ngiven year falls too far above or below the local government\u2019s estimate of the\nproperty\u2019s values, then all the other properties in their jurisdiction would\nbe reassessed up or down.\n\nThe theoretically optimal system would be to tax the value of the land only,\nand not the improvements built on top of it. In practice, this value may turn\nout to be too difficult to assess, so we may need to tax the value of the land\nand the improvements on it (at a lower rate, as the combined value would be\nhigher).\n\nFinally, we couldn\u2019t let people borrow against, sell, or otherwise pledge\ntheir future Fund distributions, or we won\u2019t really solve the problem of\nfairly distributing wealth over time. The government can simply make such\ntransactions unenforceable.\n\nPart 5\n\n## Shifting to the New System\n\nA great future isn\u2019t complicated: we need technology to create more wealth,\nand policy to fairly distribute it. Everything necessary will be cheap, and\neveryone will have enough money to be able to afford it. As this system will\nbe enormously popular, policymakers who embrace it early will be rewarded:\nthey will themselves become enormously popular.\n\nIn the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was able to enact a huge social\nsafety net that no one would have thought possible five years earlier. We are\nin a similar moment now. So a movement that is both pro-business and pro-\npeople will unite a remarkably broad constituency.\n\nA politically feasible way to launch the American Equity Fund, and one that\nwould reduce the transitional shock, would be with legislation that\ntransitions us gradually to the 2.5% rates. The full 2.5% rate would only take\nhold once GDP increases by 50% from the time the law is passed. Starting with\nsmall distributions soon will be both motivating and helpful in getting people\ncomfortable with a new future. Achieving 50% GDP growth sounds like it would\ntake a long time (it took 13 years for the economy to grow 50% to its 2019\nlevel). But once AI starts to arrive, growth will be extremely rapid. Down the\nline, we will probably be able to reduce a lot of other taxes as we tax these\ntwo fundamental asset classes.\n\nThe changes coming are unstoppable. If we embrace them and plan for them, we\ncan use them to create a much fairer, happier, and more prosperous society.\nThe future can be almost unimaginably great.\n\nThanks to Steven Adler, Daniela Amodei, Adam Baybutt, Chris Beiser, Jack\nClark, Ryan Cohen, Tyler Cowen, Matt Danzeisen, Steve Dowling, Tad Friend,\nLachy Groom, Chris Hallacy, Reid Hoffman, Ingmar Kanitscheider, Oleg Klimov,\nMatt Knight, Aris Konstantinidis, Andrew Kortina, Matt Krisiloff, Scott\nKrisiloff, John Luttig, Erik Madsen, Preston McAfee, Luke Miles, Arvind\nNeelakantan, David Oates, Cullen O\u2019Keefe, Alethea Power, Raul Puri, Ilya\nSutskever, Luke Walsh, Caleb Watney, and Wojchiech Zaremba for reviewing\ndrafts of this, and to Gregory Koberger for designing it.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
