In\nearly works, he shares Van Eyck's sharp photographic realism that conceals the\npainter's brushwork. Later in his career, Vel\u00e1zquez employs strokes and daubs\nthat the eye can easily discern, and which make for images of extraordinary\nvitality. In these works, he might be called the first great Impressionist.\n\nImage credit: Museo Nacional del Prado, public domain (source: Wikimedia\nCommons)\n\nThe Spinners, or the Fable of Arachne\n\n(detail), 1655\u20131660, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nKenneth Clark, urbane former director of The National Gallery, described\nmoving backwards and forwards in front of Vel\u00e1zquez's late masterpiece Las\nMeninas, expecting to find a smooth transition from seemingly incomprehensible\nbrushstrokes to recognisable reality.\n\nImage credit: Museo del Prado, public domain (source: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nLas Meninas\n\n1656\u20131657, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131600)\n\nInstead, the change was sudden and beyond his control. It was as if two\ndifferent pictures existed. Clark hailed the truthfulness of Vel\u00e1zquez's art,\nand during the Second World War, Clark's idea to showcase one masterpiece from\nThe National Gallery's collection drew crowds in their thousands to view\nVel\u00e1zquez's The Toilet of Venus (popularly known as 'The Rokeby Venus').\n\nImage credit: The National Gallery, London\n\nThe Toilet of Venus ('The Rokeby Venus') 1647-51\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nThe National Gallery, London\n\nAlong with The Rokeby Venus, The National Gallery houses several paintings by\nVel\u00e1zquez. Elsewhere in the UK, there are works in a number of locations, such\nas the Wellington Collection in Apsley House, and the National Galleries of\nScotland. The largest and finest single collection is in the Prado, Madrid.\n\nImage credit: Historic England Archive\n\nTwo Young Men Eating at a Humble Table c.1618\u20131620\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nEnglish Heritage, The Wellington Collection, Apsley House\n\nVel\u00e1zquez's mastery allowed him to capture, with unparalleled veracity, the\ntransitory moment: the droplets that drip down a fat jug, the blurring motion\nof a spinning wheel and a spinner's flickering fingers, or the hardening of\nfrying eggs in a pot of hot oil.\n\nImage credit: National Galleries of Scotland\n\nAn Old Woman Cooking Eggs\n\n(detail), 1618, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nWe see these astonishing effects in three of Vel\u00e1zquez's most celebrated\npaintings \u2013 An Old Woman Cooking Eggs (1618), The Waterseller of Seville\n(c.1620) and The Fable of Arachne (1655\u20131660). These paintings cover almost\nthe whole span of his working life, and trace a development towards ever\ngreater freedom in the handling of paint \u2013 a trend seen in the careers of many\nother artists, notably Titian, an artist Vel\u00e1zquez particularly admired.\n\nFrom Van Eyck's exact art to Titian's sketchy exuberance, Vel\u00e1zquez had a\nchance to view these two artists' works in Madrid, where Van Eyck's Arnolfini\nPortrait was in the royal collection, along with Titian's Rape of Europa and\nDiana and Actaeon.\n\nImage credit: National Galleries of Scotland\n\nDiana and Actaeon 1556\u20131559\n\nTitian (c.1488\u20131576)\n\nNational Galleries of Scotland\n\nImage credit: The National Gallery, London\n\nPortrait of Giovanni(?) Arnolfini and his Wife 1434\n\nJan van Eyck (c.1380/1390\u20131441)\n\nThe National Gallery, London\n\nIn the twentieth century, Francis Bacon's 'obsession' \u2013 as he put it \u2013 with\nVel\u00e1zquez's expressive effects and use of colour, led to a series of so-called\n'screaming Popes' based on Vel\u00e1zquez's Innocent X.\n\n\u00a9 The Estate of Francis Bacon.

Image credit:\nArts Council Collection, Southbank Centre, London\n\nHead VI 1949\n\nFrancis Bacon (1909\u20131992)\n\nArts Council Collection, Southbank Centre\n\nIn an interview with David Sylvester Bacon would later express his\ndisappointment with these works, judging them unsuccessful and as 'stupid\nthings [he] had done' with the venerated Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nImage credit: Historic England Archive\n\nPope Innocent X, 1650 c.1651\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nEnglish Heritage, The Wellington Collection, Apsley House\n\nWhat Vel\u00e1zquez and Bacon have in common, however, is sheer passion in using\npaint and the effects it can create. In Vel\u00e1zquez we see many examples of what\nJonathan Brown calls in his 1986 book his 'ostentatious demonstrations of\npainterly skill'. And it must seem, for the possessor of such skill,\njustification enough to wield the brush in making ever more challenging\nillusions come to life.\n\nTo paint a convincing image of fried eggs is one thing: getting the white\nright, the suitably golden yet natural-looking yolk, the glistening surface,\nthe ragged irregular edge. But to choose to show the egg in the process of\ncooking, before it assumes its cooked state \u2013 captured in its moments of\ntransformation \u2013 that is something special. To think this worth doing is to\ntrust in a rare and bold technique. But how does this work in the painting?\n\nImage credit: National Galleries of Scotland\n\nAn Old Woman Cooking Eggs 1618\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nNational Galleries of Scotland\n\nIt is a strange image: the two figures, young and old, do not connect. Their\neyes look anywhere but at each other. The alchemy in the pot between them goes\nunseen. And there is an unseeing air to the old woman's gaze, a rheumy quality\nthat the sliding eggs somehow relate to: and the eggs themselves are a pair of\neyes staring anywhere but at the protagonists.\n\nThe objects in this painting have been deliberately chosen, it is suggested,\nto allow the artist to show off his skill in depicting a variety of forms and\nsurfaces: reflective metal alongside dull pottery, the hairy bulb of garlic\nand the jelly-like albumen of the eggs.\n\nIn this respect, Vel\u00e1zquez shares a proud awareness of his gift with Van Eyck,\nwhose works are replete with challenges \u2013 brilliantly met \u2013 to his painterly\nskill. Indeed, Van Eyck is so keen for us to recognise his authorship that he\nsigned his probable self portrait (known as Portrait of a Man) 'Als Ich Can' \u2013\nAs I can \u2013 which can be read as either a hint of false modesty or a\ndeclaration that he alone was able to create such a lifelike image.\n\nImage credit: The National Gallery, London\n\nPortrait of a Man (Self Portrait?) 1433\n\nJan van Eyck (c.1380/1390\u20131441)\n\nThe National Gallery, London\n\nVel\u00e1zquez's realism is combined with the artist's willingness to bend the\nrules: as Brown points out, the assembly of kitchenware is tilted unnaturally\ntowards us so that we can see inside. How else would Vel\u00e1zquez show off the\nuncanny shadow of the knife, the knife that has just stopped rocking?\n\nVel\u00e1zquez does not hesitate to distort angles. Famously The Rokeby Venus\ndefies physics \u2013 it is her waist and hip we should see in the mirror, not her\nhazy face.\n\nImage credit: The National Gallery, London\n\nThe Toilet of Venus ('The Rokeby Venus') 1647-51\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nThe National Gallery, London\n\nIn The Waterseller, we find more gazes that do not meet. And the boy appears\nagain, the same boy, just as sullen, and a little older.\n\nImage credit: Historic England Archive\n\nThe Waterseller of Seville c.1620\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nEnglish Heritage, The Wellington Collection, Apsley House\n\nThis is an image full of stillness: the impeccable glass of water is full to\nthe brim, and both the boy's and the seller's fingers are upon it, as if to\nstabilise it, to keep it level. Stillness keeps it from spilling.\n\nImage credit: Historic England Archive\n\nThe Waterseller of Seville\n\n(detail), c.1620, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nA subtle echoing of the lines on the water jug in the wrinkles of the seller's\nbrow gives the seller the solidity of stone. His arm and hand resting on the\njug handle form a heavy, anchored pyramid, and a suggested arc from forehead\nto pot makes the assemblage cohere. Indeed the seller's body seems as one with\nthe stout jug, as if his body emerges from it.\n\nIn minute contrast to these still, stable elements are the exquisitely painted\nwater droplets on the side of the jug. Some still adhere to the pot, about to\nweep down its sides; others have made their journey, leaving a trail that\ndarkens: thus their movement is portrayed in its two phases.\n\nA work from the end of Vel\u00e1zquez's career, The Fable of Arachne, has passages\nof sketchy impressionism that remind us of the late works of the much revered\nTitian.\n\nImage credit: Museo Nacional del Prado, public domain (source: Wikimedia\nCommons)\n\nThe Spinners, or The Fable of Arachne\n\n1655\u20131660, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nIndeed homage is paid to the great Venetian in the background of this picture,\nwhere a tapestry of his Rape of Europa (1560\u20131562) hangs, half hidden by five\nfigures. Titian's painting was in Madrid in Vel\u00e1zquez's lifetime, where he\ndoubtless admired it.\n\nThe story of Arachne tells of a spinning contest between the very human and\nultimately boastful Arachne and Pallas Athena, goddess of arts and crafts.\nPallas wins and turns Arachne into a spider. Scholars disagree on the identity\nof the foreground figures, who are either seen as anonymous weavers or as the\nfabled protagonists at work: Pallas disguised as an old woman in the left\nforeground and Arachne to the right. It is this woman's left hand that we\nfocus on.\n\nImage credit: Museo Nacional del Prado, public domain (source: Wikimedia\nCommons)\n\nThe Spinners, or the Fable of Arachne\n\n(detail), 1655\u20131660, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nSuch is the speed of Arachne's work that her fingers blur and appear to split\nand even multiply. It reminds us of another hand by Vel\u00e1zquez: that of the\nInfanta in Las Meninas (1656), which is also impressionistically rendered,\nsuggestive \u2013 despite her serene disposition \u2013 of restlessness and nervous\nenergy.\n\nImage credit: Museo Nacional del Prado, public domain (source: Wikimedia\nCommons)\n\nThe Spinners, or the Fable of Arachne\n\n(detail), 1655\u20131660, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nThe tour de force of the Fable, however, is the spinning wheel.\n\nA belief expressed by art historians, for example, Jan Baptist Bedaux, is that\ndepicting motion in art is a sign of the highest accomplishment \u2013 the apogee\nof realism. Artists since classical times have attempted this difficult\nillusion.\n\nImage credit: Tate\n\nBursting Shell 1915\n\nChristopher Richard Wynne Nevinson (1889\u20131946)\n\nTate\n\nTwentieth-century artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Kazimir Malevich, Natalia\nGoncharova and the Futurists suggest it through stop motion-type staging of\naction or radiating lines. While on a cruder level, cartoonists use motion\nlines, a technique aped by Roy Lichtenstein in his Pop Art creations based on\ncomic strips.\n\n\u00a9 the estate of Roy Lichtenstein/DACS 2024. Image credit: Tate\n\nWhaam! 1963\n\nRoy Lichtenstein (1923\u20131997)\n\nTate\n\nVel\u00e1zquez, 300 years earlier, achieved a persuasive picture of a high-speed\nwheel by direct imitation, which surpasses all these experiments in its\nrealism. Jonathan Brown's 1986 description is as good as any:\n\n'...a whirring wheel, the spokes of which fuse into a blur of motion.\nVel\u00e1zquez nurtures this sublime effect by placing soft, vaporous highlights\nwithin the circumference to suggest the play of fugitive reflections on the\nnearly transparent surface'.\n\nThe Fable of Arachne is about transformation and transience \u2013 in the work the\nwomen do, turning fleece to yarn to woven tapestry, and in the way the\npainting slides from passages of relative solidity to areas of indistinct,\nalmost gaseous haze. Contrast the indistinct head and face of the woman in the\ncentre with the relatively sharply drawn sections of the framework. Even the\nfigures standing in the background seem to merge with the tapestry hanging\nthere, so that we may see the figure in armour and the woman facing him as\nwoven into it. Likewise, the cherubs might actually be flying over their\nheads.\n\nImage credit: Museo Nacional del Prado, public domain (source: Wikimedia\nCommons)\n\nThe Spinners, or the Fable of Arachne\n\n(detail), 1655\u20131660, oil on canvas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599\u20131660)\n\nThese examples of Vel\u00e1zquez's virtuosity, among the countless others in his\nworks, are the artist's alchemy. The waterseller's gold is water, the\nexemplary liquid. Yet that glass of water has become a hard crystal, as hard\nas a jewel. We are reminded of its liquidity in those migrant droplets. The\ntool of the spinner, the wheel, an object of wood, has melted into the air,\nand is now a ghost. And what better food to choose than cooking eggs to\ndemonstrate your magical power to capture brilliantly that everyday\ntransformation?\n\nVel\u00e1zquez is showing off \u2013 showing us what he can do. There need not be any\nother urge to paint.\n\nAdam Wattam, writer\n\nFurther reading\n\nJonathan Brown, Vel\u00e1zquez: Painter and Courtier, Yale University Press, 1986\n\nJonathan Brown, Collected Writings on Vel\u00e1zquez, Yale University Press, 2008\n\nGiles Knox, The Late Paintings of Vel\u00e1zquez, Ashgate, 2009\n\nDavid Sylvester, Interviews with Francis Bacon, Thames & Hudson, 1980\n\nEnjoyed this story?
