My only motive was the\nwish to see what so great an elevation had to offer. I have had the expedition\nin mind for many years; for, as you know, I have lived in this region from\ninfancy, having been cast here by that fate which determines the affairs of\nmen. Consequently the mountain, which is visible from a great distance, was\never before my eyes, and I conceived the plan of some time doing what I have\nat last accomplished to-day. The idea took hold upon me with especial force\nwhen, in re-reading Livy's History of Rome, yesterday, I happened upon the\nplace where Philip of Macedon, the same who waged war against the Romans,\nascended Mount Haemus in Thessaly, from whose summit he was able, it is said,\nto see two seas, the Adriatic and the Euxine. Whether this be true or false I\nhave not been able to determine, for the mountain is too far away, and writers\ndisagree. Pomponius Mela, the cosmographer - not to mention others who have\nspoken of this occurrence - admits its truth without hesitation; Titus Livius,\non the other hand, considers it false. [Page 309] I, assuredly, should not\nhave left the question long in doubt, had that mountain been as easy to\nexplore as this one. Let us leave this matter one side, however, and return to\nmy mountain here, - it seems to me that a young man in private life may well\nbe excused for attempting what an aged king could undertake without arousing\ncriticism.\n\nWhen I came to look about for a companion I found, strangely enough, that\nhardly one among my friends seemed suitable, so rarely do we meet with just\nthe right combination of personal tastes and characteristics, even among those\nwho are dearest to us. This one was too apathetic, that one over-anxious; this\none too slow, that one too hasty; one was too sad, another over-cheerful; one\nmore simple, another more sagacious, than I desired. I feared this one's\ntaciturnity and that one's loquacity. The heavy deliberation of some repelled\nme as much as the lean incapacity of others. I rejected those who were likely\nto irritate me by a cold want of interest, as well as those who might weary me\nby their excessive enthusiasm. Such defects, however grave, could be borne\nwith at home, for charity suffereth all things, and friendship accepts any\nburden; but it is quite otherwise on a journey, where every weakness becomes\nmuch more serious. So, as I was bent upon pleasure and anxious that my\nenjoyment should be unalloyed, I looked about me with unusual care, balanced\nagainst one another the various characteristics of my friends, and without\ncommitting any breach of friendship I silently condemned every trait which\nmight prove disagreeable [Page 310] on the way. And - would you believe it? -\nI finally turned homeward for aid, and proposed the ascent to my only brother,\nwho is younger than I, and with whom you are well acquainted. He was delighted\nand gratified beyond measure by the thought of holding the place of a friend\nas well as of a brother.\n\nAt the time fixed we left the house, and by evening reached Malaucene, which\nlies at the foot of the mountain, to the north. Having rested there a day, we\nfinally made the ascent this morning, with no companions except two servants;\nand a most difficult task it was. The mountain is a very steep and almost\ninaccessible mass of stony soil. But, as the poet has well said, \"Remorseless\ntoil conquers all.\" It was a long day, the air fine. We enjoyed the advantages\nof vigour of mind and strength and agility of body, and everything else\nessential to those engaged in such an undertaking and so had no other\ndifficulties to face than those of the region itself. We found an old shepherd\nin one of the mountain dales, who tried, at great length, to dissuade us from\nthe ascent, saying that some fifty years before he had, in the same ardour of\nyouth, reached the summit, but had gotten for his pains nothing except fatigue\nand regret, and clothes and body torn by the rocks and briars. No one, so far\nas he or his companions knew, had ever tried the ascent before or after him.\nBut his counsels increased rather than diminished our desire to proceed, since\nyouth is suspicious of warnings. So the old man, finding that his efforts were\nin vain, went a [Page 311] little way with us, and pointed out a rough path\namong the rocks, uttering many admonitions, which he continued to send after\nus even after we had left him behind. Surrendering to him all such garments or\nother possessions as might prove burdensome to us, we made ready for the\nascent, and started off at a good pace. But, as usually happens, fatigue\nquickly followed upon our excessive exertion, and we soon came to a halt at\nthe top of a certain cliff. Upon starting on again we went more slowly, and I\nespecially advanced along the rocky way with a more deliberate step. While my\nbrother chose a direct path straight up the ridge, I weakly took an easier one\nwhich really descended. When I was called back, and the right road was shown\nme, I replied that I hoped to find a better way round on the other side, and\nthat I did not mind going farther if the path were only less steep. This was\njust an excuse for my laziness; and when the others had already reached a\nconsiderable height I was still wandering in the valleys. I had failed to find\nan easier path, and had only increased the distance and difficulty of the\nascent. At last I became disgusted with the intricate way I had chosen, and\nresolved to ascend without more ado. When I reached my brother, who, while\nwaiting for me, had had ample opportunity for rest, I was tired and irritated.\nWe walked along together for a time, but hardly had we passed the first spur\nwhen I forgot about the circuitous route which I had just tried, and took a\nlower one again. Once more I followed an easy, roundabout path through winding\nvalleys, only to [Page 312] find myself soon in my old difficulty. I was\nsimply trying to avoid the exertion of the ascent; but no human ingenuity can\nalter the nature of things, or cause anything to reach a height by going down.\nSuffice it to say that, much to my vexation and my brother's amusement, I made\nthis same mistake three times or more during a few hours.\n\nAfter being frequently misled in this way, I finally sat down in a valley and\ntransferred my winged thoughts from things corporeal to the immaterial,\naddressing myself as follows: - \"What thou hast repeatedly experienced to-day\nin the ascent of this mountain, happens to thee, as to many, in the journey\ntoward the blessed life. But this is not so readily perceived by men, since\nthe motions of the body are obvious and external while those of the soul are\ninvisible and hidden. Yes, the life which we call blessed is to be sought for\non a high eminence, and strait is the way that leads to it. Many, also, are\nthe hills that lie between, and we must ascend, by a glorious stairway, from\nstrength to strength. At the top is at once the end of our struggles and the\ngoal for which we are bound. All wish to reach this goal, but, as Ovid says,\n'To wish is little; we must long with the utmost eagerness to gain our end.'\nThou certainly dost ardently desire, as well as simply wish, unless thou\ndeceivest thyself in this matter, as in so many others. What, then, doth hold\nthee back? Nothing, assuredly, except that thou wouldst take a path which\nseems, at first thought, more easy, leading through low and worldly pleasures.\nBut nevertheless in the end, after long [Page 313] wanderings, thou must\nperforce either climb the steeper path, under the burden of tasks foolishly\ndeferred, to its blessed culmination, or lie down in the valley of thy sins,\nand (I shudder to think of it!), if the shadow of death overtake thee, spend\nan eternal night amid constant torments.\" These thoughts stimulated both body\nand mind in a wonderful degree for facing the difficulties which yet remained.\nOh, that I might traverse in spirit that other road for which I long day and\nnight, even as to-day I overcame material obstacles by my bodily exertions!\nAnd I know not why it should not be far easier, since the swift immortal soul\ncan reach its goal in the twinkling of an eye, without passing through space,\nwhile my progress to-day was necessarily show, dependent as I was upon a\nfailing body weighed down by heavy members.\n\nOne peak of the mountain, the highest of all, the country people call \"Sonny,\"\nwhy, I do not know, unless by antiphrasis, as I have sometimes suspected in\nother instances; for the peak in question would seem to be the father of all\nthe surrounding ones. On its top is a little level place, and here we could at\nlast rest our tired bodies.\n\nNow, my father, since you have followed the thoughts that spurred me on in my\nascent, listen to the rest of the story, and devote one hour, I pray you, to\nreviewing the experiences of my entire day. At first, owing to the\nunaccustomed quality of the air and the effect of the great sweep of view\nspread out before me, I stood like one dazed. I beheld the clouds under our\nfeet, and what I had read [Page 314] of Athos and Olympus seemed less\nincredible as I myself witnessed the same things from a mountain of less fame.\nI turned my eyes toward Italy, whither my heart most inclined. The Alps,\nrugged and snow-capped, seemed to rise close by, although they were really at\na great distance; the very same Alps through which that fierce enemy of the\nRoman name once made his way, bursting the rocks, if we may believe the\nreport, by the application of vinegar. I sighed, I must confess, for the skies\nof Italy, which I beheld rather with my mind than with my eyes. An\ninexpressible longing came over rne to see once more my friend and my country.\nAt the same time I reproached myself for this double weakness, springing, as\nit did, from a soul not yet steeled to manly resistance. And yet there were\nexcuses for both of these cravings, and a number of distinguished writers\nmight be summoned to support me.\n\nThen a new idea took possession of me, and I shifted my thoughts to a\nconsideration of time rather than place. \"To-day it is ten years since, having\ncompleted thy youthful studies, thou didst leave Bologna. Eternal God! In the\nname of immutable wisdom, think what alterations in thy character this\nintervening period has beheld! I pass over a thousand instances. I am not yet\nin a safe harbour where I can calmly recall past storms. The time may come\nwhen I can review in due order all the experiences of the past, saying with\nSt. Augustine, 'I desire to recall my foul actions and the carnal corruption\nof [Page 315] my soul, not because I love them, but that I may the more love\nthee, 0 my God.' Much that is doubtful and evil still clings to me, but what I\nonce loved, that I hove no longer. And yet what am I saying? I still love it,\nbut with shame, but with heaviness of heart. Now, at last, I have confessed\nthe truth. So it is. I love, but love what I would not love, what I would that\nI might hate. Though loath to do so, though constrained, though sad and\nsorrowing, still I do love, and I feel in my miserable self the truth of the\nwell known words, 'I will hate if I can; if not, I will love against my will.'\nThree years have not yet passed since that perverse and wicked passion which\nhad a firm grasp upon me and held undisputed sway in my heart began to\ndiscover a rebellious opponent, who was unwilling longer to yield obedience.\nThese two adversaries have joined in close combat for the supremacy, and for a\nlong time now a harassing and doubtful war has been waged in the field of my\nthoughts.\"\n\nThus I turned over the last ten years in my mind, and then, fixing my anxious\ngaze on the future, I asked myself, \"If, perchance, thou shouldst prolong this\nuncertain life of thine for yet two lustres, and shouldst make an advance\ntoward virtue proportionate to the distance to which thou hast departed from\nthine original infatuation during the past two years, since the new longing\nfirst encountered the old, couldst thou, on reaching thy fortieth year, face\ndeath, if not with complete assurance, at least with [Page 316] hopefulness,\ncalmly dismissing from thy thoughts the residuum of life as it faded into old\nage?\"\n\nThese and similar reflections occurred to me, my father. I rejoiced in my\nprogress, mourned my weaknesses, and commiserated the universal instability of\nhuman conduct. I had well-nigh forgotten where I was and our object in coming;\nbut at last I dismissed my anxieties, which were better suited to other\nsurroundings, and resolved to look about me and see what we had come to see.\nThe sinking sun and the lengthening shadows of the mountain were already\nwarning us that the time was near at hand when we must go. As if suddenly\nwakened from sleep, I turned about and gazed toward the west. I was unable to\ndiscern the summits of the Pyrenees, which form the barrier between France and\nSpain; not because of any intervening obstacle that I know of but owing simply\nto the insufficiency of our mortal vision. But I could see with the utmost\nclearness, off to the right, the mountains of the region about Lyons, and to\nthe left the bay of Marseilles and the waters that lash the shores of Aigues\nMortes, altho' all these places were so distant that it would require a\njourney of several days to reach them. Under our very eyes flowed the Rhone.\n\nWhile I was thus dividing my thoughts, now turning my attention to some\nterrestrial object that lay before me, now raising my soul, as I had done my\nbody, to higher planes, it occurred to me to look into my copy of St.\nAugustine's Confessions, a gift that I owe to your love, and that I always\nhave about me, in memory of both the author and the giver. I [Page 317] opened\nthe compact little volume, small indeed in size, but of infinite charm, with\nthe intenition of reading whatever came to hand, for I could happen upon\nnothing that would be otherwise than edifying and devout. Now it chanced that\nthe tenth book presented itself. My brother, waiting to hear something of St.\nAugustine's from my lips, stood attentively by. I call him, and God too, to\nwitness that where I first fixed my eyes it was written: \"And men go about to\nwonder at the heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves of the sea, and\nthe wide sweep of rivers, and the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of\nthe stars, but themselves they consider not.\" I was abashed, and, asking my\nbrother (who was anxious to hear more), not to annoy me, I closed the book,\nangry with myself that I should still be admiring earthly things who might\nlong ago have learned from even the pagan philosophers that nothing is\nwonderful but the soul, which, when great itself, finds nothing great outside\nitself. Then, in truth, I was satisfied that I had seen enough of the\nmountain; I turned my inward eye upon myself, and from that time not a\nsyllable fell from my lips until we reached the bottom again. Those words had\ngiven me occupation enough, for I could not believe that it was by a mere\naccident that I happened upon them. What I had there read I believed to be\naddressed to me and to no other, remembering that St. Augustine had once\nsuspected the same thing in his own case, when, on opening the book of the\nApostle, as he himself tells us, the first words that he saw there were, \"Not\nin rioting [Page 318] and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not\nin strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not\nprovision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.\"\n\nThe same thing happened earlier to St. Anthony, when he was listening to the\nGospel where it is written, \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou\nhast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come\nand follow me.\" Believing this scripture to have been read for his especial\nbenefit, as his biographer Athanasius says, he guided himself by its aid to\nthe Kingdom of Heaven. And as Anthony on hearing these words waited for\nnothing more, and as Augustine upon reading the Apostle's admonition sought no\nfarther, so I concluded my reading in the few words which I have given. I\nthought in silence of the lack of good cousel in us mortals, who neglect what\nis noblest in ourselves, scatter our energies in all directions, and waste\nourselves in a vain show, because we look about us for what is to be found\nonly within. I wondered at the natural nobility of our soul, save when it\ndebases itself of its own free will, and deserts its original estate, turning\nwhat God has given it for its honour into dishonour. How many times, think\nyou, did I turn back that day, to glance at the summit of the mountain which\nseemed scarcely a cubit high compared with the range of human contemplation, -\nwhen it is not immersed in the foul mire of earth? With every downward step I\nasked myself this: If we are ready to endure so much sweat and labour in order\nthat we [Page 319] may bring our bodies a little nearer heaven, how can a soul\nstruggling toward God, up the steeps of human pride and human destiny, fear\nany cross or prison or sting of fortune? How few, I thought, but are diverted\nfrom their path by the fear of difficulties or the love of ease! How happy the\nlot of those few, if any such there be! It is of them, assuredly, that the\npoet was thinking, when he wrote:\n\nHappy the man who is skilled to understand Nature's hid causes; who beneath\nhis feet All terrors casts, and death's relentless doom, And the loud roar of\ngreedy Acheron.\n\nHow earnestly should we strive, not to stand on mountain-tops, but to trample\nbeneath us those appetites which spring from earthhly impulses.\n\nWith no consciousness of the difficulties of the way, amidst these\npreoccupations which I have so frankly revealed, we came, long after dark, but\nwith the full moon lending us its friendly light, to the little inn which we\nhad left that morning before dawn. The time during which the servants have\nbeen occupied in preparing our supper, I have spent in a secluded part of the\nhouse, hurriedly jotting down these experiences on the spur of the moment,\nlest, in case my task were postponed, my mood should change on leaving the\nplace, and so my interest in writing flag.\n\n[Page 320] You will see, my dearest father, that I wish nothing to be\nconcealed from you, for I am careful to describe to you not only my life in\ngeneral but even my individual reflections. And I beseech you, in turn, to\npray that these vague and wandering thoughts of mine may some time become\nfirmly fixed, and, after having been vainly tossed about from one interest to\nanother, may direct themselves at last toward the single, true, certain, and\neverlasting good.\n\nMalaucene, April 26.\n\nReturn to the Table of Contents Return to Hanover Historical Texts Project\nReturn to Hanover College Department of History Please send comments\nto:historians@hanover.edu\n\n", "frontpage": false}
