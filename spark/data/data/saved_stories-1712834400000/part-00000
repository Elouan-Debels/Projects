Or, absent God, a fertility startup called Orchid. It\noffers prospective parents a fantastical choice: Have a regular baby or have\nan Orchid baby. A regular baby might grow up and get cancer. Or be born with a\nsevere intellectual disability. Or go blind. Or become obese. A regular baby\nmight not even make it to childbirth. Any of those things could still happen\nto an Orchid baby, yes, but the risk, says 29-year-old Noor Siddiqui, plummets\nif you choose her method. It\u2019s often called \u201cgenetic enhancement.\u201d\n\nWhenever I bring up Orchid in polite company, people squirm. \u201cI\u2019m\nuncomfortable,\u201d they say. \u201cNot for me.\u201d \u201cSo unnatural.\u201d Inevitably, Nazis get\nmentioned, as does a related word that starts with \u201ceu\u201d and ends in \u201cgenics.\u201d\n(Orchid prefers I not utter it.) One new mom I was talking to was\nparticularly, headshakingly disturbed. Then, a few minutes later, in an\nattempt to change the subject, she announced to the room that she\u2019d just fed\nher 6-month-old his first peanut, and that in three months\u2019 time she\u2019d be\nfeeding him his first shrimp, because that\u2019s what the science says she must do\nto protect him from developing allergies.\n\nWhich is, of course, the entirety of Siddiqui\u2019s pitch: to\u2014based on what the\nscience says\u2014protect future people from future suffering. It\u2019s why, as a\nteenage Thiel Fellow, Siddiqui launched a medical startup; and why, at 25, she\nstarted Orchid. It\u2019s also why, now that the company\u2019s gene-enhancing product\nis available, she wanted to be one of its first customers.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSiddiqui and her husband are perfectly fertile, but for this kind of\nintervention to work, you need embryos. So in 2022, Siddiqui underwent IVF at\nStanford, wound up with 16 contenders, and sent off representative slivers to\nOrchid\u2019s lab in North Carolina. Typically, preimplantation testing scans only\nfor alarming abnormalities, and then a doctor selects the nicest looker. This\nis not that. This is something that, as Siddiqui tells me, \u201chas been on\nsociety\u2019s mind\u2014sci-fi\u2019s mind\u2014for a generation\u201d: a first-of-its-kind picture of\nevery baby-to-be\u2019s genetic destiny. Right now, Orchid calculates each embryo\u2019s\nlikelihood of one day suffering from any number of the more than 1,200\ndiseases and conditions about which we currently have (anywhere from rock-\nsolid to, ya know, vague and extrapolative) genetic information. Who knows\nwhat it will calculate in the future.\n\nOrchid is still in its early days\u201416 employees, $12 million in funding. But\nalready they\u2019re in 40 IVF clinics across the country and have thousands of\ncustomers. This includes, I\u2019m told, several big-name figures in tech. Asked to\nbetray their identities, Siddiqui scoffs, but she\u2019s more than happy to show me\nthe data on her own embryos. This she does on a picture-perfect day outside a\ncoffee shop near her home in the Mission district of San Francisco. The\nreport, which she pulls up on her laptop, is sleekly designed, with all sorts\nof charts and numbers, some in black (solid odds against schizophrenia),\nothers in red (not so good for breast cancer). If it were up to Siddiqui, a\nStanford-trained computer scientist, that\u2019s all we\u2019d talk about\u2014the\npercentages, the percentiles, the \u201cpenetrances.\u201d But I keep trying to pull her\naway from the numbers, from what the science (she claims) says. Because that\u2019s\nnot the whole story. Because, as she said herself, this is a science fiction\nstory too ...\n\nJason Kehe: Before we get to your embryos, I just learned that you have a new\npodcast\u2014not just about Orchid but about all kinds of crazy science and\nfuture-y stuff. Should I be listening to it?\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nFallout Nails Video Game Adaptations by Making the Apocalypse Fun\n\nMarah Eakin\n\n  * Security\n\nTrump Loyalists Kill Vote on US Wiretap Program\n\nDell Cameron\n\n  * Gear\n\nTarget Is Having a Big Sale on iPads, Headphones, and Even a KitchenAid Stand\nMixer\n\nMedea Giordano\n\n  * Culture\n\nInfluencers Are Trying to Go Viral by Playing a Game About Going Viral\n\nMegan Farokhmanesh\n\nNoor Siddiqui: Oh, definitely. The guests on it have been amazing. Do you know\nthe writer Tim Urban? I love that guy. He\u2019s totally changed my conception of\ntime. You\u2019ve seen his Life Calendar stuff, right?\n\nHave I?\n\nBasically he just shows you how you\u2019ve spent 90 percent of the hours you\u2019re\never going to spend with your parents by the time you\u2019re 18\u2014and how, yeah, the\nmoments that we have with each other are actually way more scarce and\nnonrenewable. It's made me savor and appreciate a lot of those moments more,\nand be a little bit more present.\n\nThis reminds me of Orchid\u2019s origin story, which involves your mom. Because of\na genetic reason\u2014\n\nA condition called retinitis pigmentosa, uh huh.\n\nYes, she went blind.\n\nShe\u2019s not fully blind, but she\u2019s been legally blind for a while.\n\nWhich is one of the reasons you started Orchid, yes. But whenever I think\nabout this story, I think\u2014if Orchid technology had existed back then, and if\nthe batch of embryos that contained your future mom had been screened, and if\nher parents\u2014your grandparents\u2014had not wanted their child to grow up with\nretinitis pigmentosa, and if they had therefore picked a different embryo and\nhad a different child, then you\u2014the discarded embryo\u2019s future daughter\u2014would\nnot exist. Right? Do you think about that? Is that a fair line of thinking?\n\nI sort of understand it, but I sort of don\u2019t.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m sure other people have pointed this out.\n\nThey have. It\u2019s just that, I mean, I\u2019m not deleting my mom.\n\nBut, sort of retroactively, there is a world where you would, kind of, have\ndeleted her.\n\nI guess, but\u2014the way I would think about it is, like, I would have a mom, but\nmy mom wouldn\u2019t have suffered in the way that she did. My mom wouldn\u2019t have\nhad to go blind. I wouldn\u2019t have had to see her suffer from that.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have had to see her suffer because\u2014not to be a broken record\nhere\u2014you wouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt would be a different version of me.\n\nYour mom\u2019s probably a wonderful\u2014well, I don\u2019t know anything about your mom.\n\nNo, she is. She\u2019s amazing. Yes. And she would rather have vision.\n\nAnd maybe the world would be better off without adult-onset blindness. Or\nwithout babies with birth defects or pediatric cancers. Yes. But oftentimes,\nthese people go on living\u2014and live not only meaningful lives, but world-\nchanging lives.\n\nYeah. Of course.\n\nSo who\u2019s to say that, by eliminating these conditions, we\u2019re not eliminating\nthe kind of person who would then go on to, for instance, want to make the\nworld better?\n\nThe entire history of human existence is reducing suffering and making it so\nthat more people get to participate more fully in society. Right? And\nsecondly, we have this population of very vulnerable people who have diseases\nthat run in their family. They\u2019re just told, well, roll the dice and hope for\nthe best. South Asians, for instance, have really high rates of heart attacks\nand diabetes. Like, that sucks. I think that\u2019s really unfair.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nFallout Nails Video Game Adaptations by Making the Apocalypse Fun\n\nMarah Eakin\n\n  * Security\n\nTrump Loyalists Kill Vote on US Wiretap Program\n\nDell Cameron\n\n  * Gear\n\nTarget Is Having a Big Sale on iPads, Headphones, and Even a KitchenAid Stand\nMixer\n\nMedea Giordano\n\n  * Culture\n\nInfluencers Are Trying to Go Viral by Playing a Game About Going Viral\n\nMegan Farokhmanesh\n\nBut again, you think that\u2019s unfair because of who your mom is. Because she\nsuffers. Something about her suffering catalyzed in you the desire to end\nsuffering in other people. Does that make sense?\n\nNo, that doesn\u2019t make sense. Unfortunately, not all disease is genetic. There\nwill still be disease and suffering. We are not that much of an optimistic\nfantasy. We are taking risk off of the table. For the whole category of\ncancer, for example, about 10 percent to 15 percent has a genetic component.\nSo 90 percent of people will still get cancer. And the same with\nneurodevelopmental disorders and birth defects. It\u2019s just going to make it so\nthat more parents can feel more confident and have more information going into\nthe most important decision of their life, which is to have a child.\n\nWhat are the diseases prospective parents seem to be most concerned about?\n\nPediatric and adult-onset cancers, birth defects, and neurodevelopmental\ndisorders.\n\nDo these tend to be controlled by the interaction of multiple genes\u2014be\n\u201cpolygenic,\u201d as you\u2019d say?\n\nThese are all monogenic.\n\nCancer is only tied to a single gene?\n\nYeah, well, OK, that\u2019s actually a great point. Because cancer is both\nmonogenic and polygenic. There are monogenic causes of cancer. They\u2019re\nactually predispositions, not causes. Because if you have BRCA, for example,\nthat\u2019s not a guarantee that you have breast cancer, but it makes you, I think,\nfour or five times more likely.\n\nPlenty of existing companies, like 23andMe, already screen for BRCA variants.\n\n23andMe does an array. They only look at, I think, 44 BRCA variants of the\n70,000. If you only look at a few, then you can give people false certainty.\n\nAnd they\u2019re obviously not testing embryos.\n\nYeah, they just do people.\n\nWhereas you sequence the entire genome of embryos\u2014orders of magnitude more\ninformation, on both monogenic and polygenic conditions, than anything that\u2019s\never been done before. Even your main competitor, Genomic Prediction, only\ndoes arrays of embryos, looking for specific things.\n\nYeah. Whole genome is a big deal and a massive upgrade. You can mitigate risks\nfor thousands of diseases that previously you weren\u2019t able to detect. It\u2019s\nkind of like a vaccine for everything that we know, genetic-wise, at once.\n\nAnd all off a very small amount of DNA.\n\nAbout 5 picograms per cell in an embryo sample. That\u2019s a really, really tiny\namount. From both a chemistry perspective and a computational perspective, we\nhad to invent new things to make it so that you can recover whole-genome data.\n\nThe absolute whole thing, all 3 billion bases or whatever?\n\n99.6 percent coverage, on average.\n\nPhotograph: Helynn Ospina\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nFallout Nails Video Game Adaptations by Making the Apocalypse Fun\n\nMarah Eakin\n\n  * Security\n\nTrump Loyalists Kill Vote on US Wiretap Program\n\nDell Cameron\n\n  * Gear\n\nTarget Is Having a Big Sale on iPads, Headphones, and Even a KitchenAid Stand\nMixer\n\nMedea Giordano\n\n  * Culture\n\nInfluencers Are Trying to Go Viral by Playing a Game About Going Viral\n\nMegan Farokhmanesh\n\nWalk me through your own decision to do this\u2014to use Orchid\u2019s technology on\nyourself.\n\nI mean, I started the company because I wanted to test my own embryos.\n\nBecause of your mom, or because of who you are as a person?\n\nBoth. Reproduction is one of the most fundamental things in life. It\u2019s like\nyou die, taxes, and, you know, people have kids.\n\nYou always knew you wanted to have kids.\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nHow old were you when you were like, \u201cI should be able to sequence my\nembryos\u201d?\n\nI don\u2019t think it was sequence my embryos specifically. I\u2019ve always had an\ninterest in genetics. I\u2019ve always had an interest in fertility and\nreproductive tech.\n\nEven as, like, a teenager?\n\nI remember one of my applications for the Thiel Fellowship definitely had a\nversion of Orchid on there.\n\nThat was, what, over a decade ago, and a lot of prospective parents still rely\non the same genetic testing we used back then.\n\nI would consider it negligent to use the old technology. Because you\u2019re by\ndefinition missing hundreds of things that could have been detected. Parents\nwho are not told that this new technology exists are being done a huge\ndisservice and will probably be suing if their child ends up with a condition.\n\nYou think that\u2019s a legitimate lawsuit?\n\nOf course. If your doctor doesn\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s a way for you to\nscreen for your child to not have a condition that would be either life-\nthreatening or life-altering for them\u2014I mean, it's already happened. [Parents\nhave been suing physicians for failing to perform genetic tests since the late\n1980s.]\n\nHow much does an Orchid screening cost?\n\nIt\u2019s $2,500 per embryo.\n\nAnd presumably you\u2019d be screening several embryos. What about for families\nthat can\u2019t afford that?\n\nWe have a philanthropic program, so people can apply to that, and we\u2019re\nexcited to accept as many cases as we can.\n\nYour clientele, at the moment, must tend toward well-off optimizers\u2014people who\nreally fuss about numbers.\n\nI guess you\u2019re right. I mean, I don\u2019t know.\n\nDo you ever worry about that? Giving people, like, more things to worry about?\n\nNo, no, no. I think it\u2019s the opposite. For the vast majority of our patients,\nit reduces worry.\n\nThere must be exceptions.\n\nThere are some people who, I agree, are kind of anxious. And I just don\u2019t\nthink they should do any genetic testing.\n\nOh yeah?\n\nI mean, everyone\u2019s different. It\u2019s just that I want to expand the menu of\nchoice. You get to choose your partner. You get to choose when and if you have\nkids. This is, like, this is your kid. Why would you censor information about\nthat?\n\nBut this still makes a lot of people extremely uncomfortable. There\u2019s a fear,\nso often, around anything that touches reproduction. Are we, I don\u2019t know,\nafraid of playing God or something?\n\nEvery other time we examine something, we develop\u2014we develop insulin, right?\nWe\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d It\u2019s not like you\u2019re playing God there. But you\nactually are, right? You\u2019re creating something that didn\u2019t exist before.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nFallout Nails Video Game Adaptations by Making the Apocalypse Fun\n\nMarah Eakin\n\n  * Security\n\nTrump Loyalists Kill Vote on US Wiretap Program\n\nDell Cameron\n\n  * Gear\n\nTarget Is Having a Big Sale on iPads, Headphones, and Even a KitchenAid Stand\nMixer\n\nMedea Giordano\n\n  * Culture\n\nInfluencers Are Trying to Go Viral by Playing a Game About Going Viral\n\nMegan Farokhmanesh\n\nBut I have to believe there\u2019s a difference between something like insulin and\nsomething like reproduction. I\u2019m not terribly religious, but one just seems\nmore\u2014forgive the religious word\u2014sacred than the other. Do you not see it that\nway?\n\nNo, I definitely see it as something sacred and beautiful and special and,\nlike, magnificent. But that\u2019s actually why I want to give more care to it.\n\nAnd you\u2019re saying the care that exists today isn\u2019t sufficient.\n\nWhy is it that 90 percent of women, when they give birth, have vaginal\ntearing? Your genitals rip. Like, what the fuck? That\u2019s not cool. That\u2019s\nhorrific. Some women still die. This process of giving birth is something\nthat\u2019s very critical for the human species, yet there isn\u2019t the amount of\nenergy and engineering effort put into it that I think it deserves and merits.\nAnd I think we\u2019re starting to see that, right? With population decline?\n\nSee what? Women choosing not to have kids?\n\nWomen are like, well, no. We don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\n\nDoes population decline worry you?\n\nI mean, it\u2019s super important. The population of all of the places we love is\nshrinking. In 50 years, 30 years, you\u2019ll have half as many people in places\nthat you love. Society will collapse. We have to solve it. It\u2019s very critical.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe need humans! Humans are the ones who are innovating, making new things,\nmaking things better.\n\nAnd you blame declining birth rates on the lack of attention to reproduction?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of different reasons why women are choosing to have fewer kids.\nBut I think one piece of it is definitely the technology portion of, well, why\ndon\u2019t we make it way safer and way better and more confident for people going\nthrough pregnancy?\n\nWhy did you name your company Orchid?\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like what you were saying\u2014people are naturally afraid of any\nreproductive technology. So I was like, \u201cWell, what\u2019s something that I really\nlike that I think represents this whole thing?\u201d Flowers.\n\nYou were trying to make it sound less scary.\n\nThere was a spreadsheet. There were actually a lot of different other flowers.\n\nLike what? Rose? Tulip?\n\nI think we considered almost all the flower names. I don\u2019t remember what the\nreasons for disqualification were. Maybe they were too hard to say, or\u2014\n\nChrysanthemum!\n\nOh yeah, or too long. I do love orchids. I think they\u2019re beautiful flowers.\n\nI must now ask a question I\u2019ve been dreading. I\u2019m sorry in advance. Here goes.\nIt\u2019s the inevitable question about Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes.\n\nNo, this is the worst question. This is so mean.\n\nTell me why it\u2019s so mean.\n\nI find it sad. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs where\u2014my friends who aren\u2019t even in\nhealth, they say they get it too. It\u2019s like, any female CEO with any tech-\nadjacent thing is constantly being questioned\u2014by the way, are you like this\nother fraud? Do you want to comment on this other random fraud that occurred\nthat has absolutely nothing to do with you besides the person being the same\ngender as you?\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to charitably understand where this question is coming from,\nhow do you do that?\n\nWhat would be the charitable interpretation\u2014besides that our society is\nincredibly misogynistic and men\u2019s frauds and failings are passed aside and\nwhen one female does it she stands for every other female CEO ever?\n\nSo there\u2019s no charitable interpretation.\n\nI don\u2019t think there is. Society treats men as, like, default credible. For a\nwoman, the default is skeptical.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * Hackers found a way to open 3 million hotel keycard locks\n\n  * A couple decided to decarbonize their home.
