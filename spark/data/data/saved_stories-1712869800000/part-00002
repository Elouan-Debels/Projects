I bought a condo\nbecause I couldn\u2019t pass up the deal, and during the process of renovating it I\nfell in love with the city and eventually came to the point where I couldn\u2019t\nimagine living anywhere else. I shared my enthusiasm with friends and within a\nfew years we had bought 11 of the condos in our 50 condo complex.\n\nMost people traveled for most of the time, but often at least one or two other\npeople were there, and occasionally a large group of us would all be there at\nonce. In many ways it felt like the best of all worlds, with the convenience\nand social aspect of a college dorm, but with the independence of having your\nown space that you could customize to your needs.\n\nAt the time, I thought the biggest selling point of the condos was their\nprice. Many of us bought them for $50-60k, which is basically nothing for a\ncomfortable two bedroom apartment in a convenient (though not particularly\nluxurious) location.\n\nMy wife bought the apartment next to mine, so we had two units that we used as\none bigger apartment. We knew it wouldn\u2019t be forever, though, as having two\nkitchens and paying two HOA fees didn\u2019t make much sense. During the pandemic\nwe felt a bit confined without access to any outdoor space (and the city\nastoundingly shut down the parks), we decided to move.\n\nWe moved to a new neighborhood with much nicer houses. We had twice as much\nspace as our combined condos, a pool, and a big backyard. I felt a little bit\nbad abandoning the neighborhood to which I spend so much work convincing\npeople to move, but we were happy to have a nicer house with some outdoor\nspace.\n\nI didn\u2019t bother trying to convince anyone else to move, because in my mind\neveryone else had bought a condo mostly because it was so cheap. But then, one\nby one, people started asking about the new neighborhood. And new people who\nwere never interested in the old neighborhood were interested in the new one.\n\nNow five of us have bought houses in the new neighborhood (though one is\ncurrently renting his house out). It turns out that \u201cbuy an amazing house for\ncheaper than you can in any other good city\u201d is a lot more compelling than\n\u201cbuy the cheapest condo in any good city\u201d. Besides the five houses (9 people\ntotal), I also have another couple that I believe will move eventually as well\nas a couple potential future move-ins.\n\nThis past month was a perfect storm where everyone was in the neighborhood\nalong with a few guests coming in over the course of the month, and it was\nmagical enough that I felt compelled to write about it.\n\nThe closer you live to your friends, the less planning is necessary to spend\ntime together. We know that this is true on the scale of large distances (it\u2019s\neasier to see someone in your same city than it is in another state), but it\u2019s\namazing how that ease continues to scale as the distances become shorter. When\neveryone can walk or ride a scooter to one person\u2019s house in a matter of\nminutes, spontaneous meetups to swim, play pinball, watch the hockey game, or\ngo out to dinner happen much more frequently.\n\nIt\u2019s also easier to help each other. I borrowed my friend\u2019s Tesla for a road\ntrip to Utah and it was easy to drive one minute to pick up the keys and drop\nmy car off for him. A friend wanted me to watch her plants so she carried them\nover. Another friend was renovating her place so she stayed at our house and\nbrought my tools back and forth. When one of us is out of town, the others are\navailable to stop by and pick up packages or make sure the door is locked.\nIt\u2019s not a big ask.\n\nI write so much about friction and how I try to eliminate mandatory friction\nin my life, and only now am I realizing how much friction is eliminated by\nliving in the same neighborhood with my friends. Spending quality time with my\nfriends is one of my top priorities in life, and it\u2019s great to also make that\none of the easiest things in my life.\n\nSharing a neighborhood also deepens friendships more than I expected. One\nperson who I\u2019ve been friends with for years became a much better friend when\nshe moved down the street, and I\u2019m now good friends with her fiance\u00e9, who I\ndidn\u2019t really know very well before they moved.\n\nRight now we don\u2019t quite have critical mass, but I also have some ideas for\nthe future involving hiring people to provide \u201cneighborhood services\u201d. We\ncould buy 1-2 days per week of a cleaner\u2019s time, for example, and they could\ndo all of the houses at once. If we got enough people we could probably hire\nsomeone to work a couple hours a day and do errands for everyone.\n\nOf course, all of this is to say that I think that you should consider moving\ninto a neighborhood with your friends. I\u2019m not sure if anyone else will really\ndo it (since no one has bought properties with their friends and told me about\nit), but it\u2019s worth thinking about.\n\nI think the key points are to move into a neighborhood that is nice enough\nthat everyone would love living there, but inexpensive enough that everyone\ncan afford it. That\u2019s obviously tough to manage in some cities, but in cities\nlike Vegas it is very easy. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of cities around the\nUS that would have doable neighborhoods. It\u2019s a tough pill to swallow to move\nto a city that isn\u2019t your first choice, but I think it would be well worth it\nto live with your friends. As much as I love Vegas I would consider living\njust about anywhere if enough of my friends moved into the neighborhood with\nme.\n\nIt would be best to have a couple friends committed to the idea with you so\nthat you don\u2019t have to first move alone like I did, but you may need to be a\npioneer so that you can sell the city. I wouldn\u2019t have discovered how amazing\nVegas is if I didn\u2019t move here accidentally, and I don\u2019t think any of my\nfriends would know if I hadn\u2019t pushed them to spend more time here and move\n(though honestly I don\u2019t think most of them really loved Vegas until they\nactually moved).\n\nBecause I convinced everyone to move here, I feel a (welcome) burden to make\nit as good of an experience as possible. I help everyone find houses and meet\nthe realtors for them when they\u2019re not in town. I lend my van when they move\nin, my car if theirs isn\u2019t here yet, and I help them fix things in their\nhouses. As our community has gotten bigger, others have also helped pitch in\nwith this sort of stuff, which gives a real sense of community. If you try to\nget your friends to move nearby, do everything you can to make it easy.\n\nThe fun part is that as the community grows, everyone ends up helping each\nother and it becomes bigger than the sum of its parts. My friends have found\nall sorts of cool things in Vegas that I wouldn\u2019t have found and have\norganized trips to go do them.\n\nYou can\u2019t control who moves into your neighborhood and who doesn\u2019t, but I\nwouldn\u2019t try to convince anyone to move in who I wouldn\u2019t randomly invite to\nhave tea with me on any given morning. That\u2019s my bar. In our previous\nneighborhood we had friends-of-friends move in, some of whom were great, and\nothers I found myself bumping into more than I\u2019d want to. As with any\ncommunity you\u2019re trying to build, quality over quantity.\n\nI have a lot of friends and family in Austin, and it could be argued that by\nmy own standards I should have moved there. But what I find interesting is\nthat many of the people who are closest there don\u2019t see each other that often,\nbecause they live in different parts of the city. I think if they lived in the\nsame neighborhood they\u2019d see each other all the time. My point is that you\nshould think of living in the same neighborhood totally different than you\nthink of living in the same city. The benefits are multiplied.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a big step and a lot of work to convince people, but it\u2019s hard to\nunderstate how much it pays off. For me at least, it\u2019s been worth the effort,\nand it\u2019s fun to see how our neighborhood community grows and evolves.\n\n###\n\nPhoto is my neighborhood.... zoomed way out.\n\nMy good friends in Kazakhstan are now running tours that are basically more\ndeluxe versions of the second one they took me on (which I thought I wrote\nabout, but I guess not. It was even more fun than the first). Anyway... you\nshould seriously go on a tour with them. They\u2019re amazing people and the two\ntrips they organized for me and my friends stand out more than any others I\u2019ve\nbeen on in the past 5 years or so. Check out their site at JVExperiences.com\n\nBTW, I looked back at my first post about Vegas in the first paragraph...\npretty wild how even 9 years ago I thought we\u2019d take over a neighborhood and\nthat I thought the values would go way up (sold my first condo for ~3x what I\npaid for it).\n\nPosted\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\nin\n\nby\n\nTynan\n\nTags:\n\n## Comments\n\n### 11 responses to \u201cA Neighborhood With Friends\u201d\n\n  1. Jacob\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\nYea when I lived a few houses down the street from some close friends of mine\nin middle and high school it was pretty awesome. After I finish my degree I\nwould like to do something like that. Probably wont be Vegas since it\u2019s going\nto be way too hot and dry in a few decades and probably not suburbs since I\ndon\u2019t trust suburbs to last until I\u2019m an old man. Unless something in my life\nradically changes it will be pacific northwest or where I currently am in the\nBay Area.\n\nReply\n\n  2. Reader\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\nWhere you at then? Summerlin? I found many neighborhoods in Vegas to be quite\ntrashy. And the nice ones weren\u2019t actually that affordable, though it\u2019s\ncertainly not the Bay Area.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Tynan\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\nThere are good and bad neighborhoods all over Vegas. I\u2019m on the east side but\nthere are also a lot of good areas near downtown. I\u2019m also not sure what\nyou\u2019re saying is trashy (and I\u2019d agree some are), but IMO the best houses and\nopportunities are in areas others overlook because they don\u2019t fit a cookie\ncutter mold of what a \u201cgood\u201d neighborhood or house is.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Justin\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n20 years ago, my friend and I would talk about how it makes sense for friends\nto live in the same neighborhood. It felt like a pipe dream. Nice to see\nsomeone making it a reality.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Rye\n\nMay 6, 2023\n\nThanks for all the vegas info and recommendations. I recently went and had one\nof the best breakfasts at Publicus I have ever had in my life, amazing ! Can\u2019t\nwait to go back again !\n\nReply\n\n    1. Tynan\n\nMay 6, 2023\n\nAwesome that you got off the strip. Publicus is amazing. I love their steak +\neggs, and their tea is from Song Tea, which is like the Ferrari of tea\ncompanies. I\u2019ve only ever seen one other cafe that serves Song.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Dana\n\nMay 6, 2023\n\nThis is literally my biggest goal / dream. I would move anywhere to live near\nthe right people. I\u2019m just trying to meet the highest quality friends\nfirst...the place I currently live is not for me. Looking to move to a new\nplace that would allow me to make friends\n\nReply\n\n  6. 205guy\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nI like that you\u2019re adapting the ideas of an intentional community to the\nexisting landscape (condos and suburbia). Some other bloggers that have\nsimilar ideas: granolashotgun.com (less explicitly) and mrmoneymustache.com\n(more explicitly, he also started a co-working space for his tribe).\n\nReply\n\n  7. Priya\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\nI did something similar with friends but via renting:\nhttps://prigoose.substack.com/p/how-to-live-near-your-friends\n\nLots of similarities: \u2013 We have a shared cleaner \u2013 We take care of each\nother\u2019s plants and pets \u2013 We spontaneously hang out often (in our case for\nfood, skating, co-working, music-making etc.) \u2013 We effortlessly learn new\nskills from each other. E.g. when one apartment refurbished their unit, many\nppl in the community got to learn construction and use power tools for the\nfirst time. This spurred other friends to do construction too \u2014 they built\nlofted beds. \u2013 Many of us do daily standup together, where we meet in the\nmornings at 9:30, journal for 2 minutes, then share for 1 minute. We often end\nup unblocking each other.\n\nRe: \u201cThat\u2019s my bar. In our previous neighborhood we had friends-of-friends\nmove in, some of whom were great, and others I found myself bumping into more\nthan I\u2019d want to.\u201d One thing I like about starting this experiment via renting\nis that it\u2019s inherently impermanent. I intend to co-buy at some point, and by\nthen we\u2019ll have learned exactly where the bar is.\n\nReply\n\n  8.
