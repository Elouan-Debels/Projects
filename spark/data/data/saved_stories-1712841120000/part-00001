Blankenhorn\n\nApr 09, 2024\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Open Source Can\u2019t Innovate\n\ndanafblankenhorn.substack.com\n\n1\n\nShare\n\nWhen the Web was young, open source helped lead innovation.\n\nIndividual programmers and small companies joined together, under a shared\ncontract, to build things no one of them was able (or willing) to build alone.\nThe Cloud owes its existence to projects like Hadoop, to companies like Red\nHat, and to programs like mySQL.\n\nOpen source can\u2019t do that anymore.\n\nThe turning point was Oracle\u2019s purchase of Sun, which led to its closing the\nsource on mySQL, as well as Solaris and Java. Projects could be forked, but\nOracle\u2019s lawyers stood by to stamp out innovation. The final decision in\nGoogle vs. Oracle didn\u2019t touch directly on this. But the result was to approve\nof it.\n\nYou can still start an open source project. But any corporate sponsor now has\nthe power to close that source code, in whole or in part, at its whim.\nFoundations only take on existing projects. They don\u2019t start them. They take\nthe work of others and build on it. You can compete with another project, you\ncan fork the code, but you\u2019re starting all over again, now with a scaled\ncompetitor.\n\n##\n\nGreed\n\nThere\u2019s a second reason why open source has floundered in the AI era.\n\nThat\u2019s the sheer value to be gained from innovation.\n\nOpenAI began as an open source project. They closed it, not just when they saw\nhow much had to be invested, but when they saw how much money and power there\nwas to be gained from it.\n\nThe greed of men like Sam Altman and Larry Ellison has wrecked the open source\nethos. But it has also done more. It has destroyed the \u201chalo effect\u201d\ntechnology innovation once enjoyed among ordinary people. Now that programmers\nsee open source as a grift (rather than a gift) and consumers see it as a\npower grab, entrepreneurs are on the defensive.\n\nThey deserve to be. They\u2019ve been warned.\n\nWhat has changed about technology in the last generation is that the \u201cwe\u201d of\nshared innovation became the \u201cme\u201d of money and power. The fall of open source\nis a prime example, and those who reaped this whirlwind will inherit the wind.\n\nTechnology can\u2019t advance rapidly without the active support of those who use\nit.\n\n### Subscribe to Dana Blankenhorn: Facing the Future\n\nBy Dana F.

Schwartz7 hrs agoI have faith in open source. As the show runner and\nhost of FLOSS Weekly for 13 years, I've seen many successful business models.\nI'm also happy with how Google is sheparding Flutter and Dart, even though a\nlarge portion of the commits for any given release are in fact coming from the\ncommunity. Open source still has its place.Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMuskSlide\n\nElon Musk Heads Toward Irrelevancy\n\nMar 1 \u2022\n\nDana F.
