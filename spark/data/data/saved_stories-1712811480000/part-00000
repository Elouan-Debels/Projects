The stationary CR-V\nreportedly had no lights on, which may have resulted in the Mach-E's cameras\nbeing unable to pick up the object and engage Automatic Emergency Braking.\n\n### Get Fully Charged\n\nNTSB's Requires Certain Driver-Assistance-Related Crashes to be Reported\n\nThe NTSB is no stranger to probing crashes involving Level 2 driver assistance\nfeatures. In fact, the agency requires that any crashes be reported if they\ninvolve a Level 2 driver-assistance feature if the accident resulted in a\nfatality, a vehicle tow-away, an airbag deployment, or if any individual is\ntransported to a hospital for medical treatment.\n\nAt the center of the investigation is Ford's Level 2 driver assistance system:\nBlueCruise. Ford markets the $75-per-month tech as a \"hands-free highway\ndriving feature\" when driving on prequalified sections of divided highways.\nFord says it has mapped out more than 130,000 miles of roads in North America\nto be compatible with its hands-free feature, which includes a large section\nof highway I-10 outside of San Antonio.\n\nHowever, given that the system is defined as a Level 2 driver-assistance\nfeature, the person behind the steering wheel is considered to be responsible\nfor the car's operation at all times.\n\n### Cookie Settings\n\nThis content is blocked by security settings.\n\nPlease click on button for showing it.\n\nOpen settings\n\nAccording to an accident report obtained by InsideEVs, the Mach-E had \"partial\nautonomy\" active at the time of the crash. It's not clear whether the hands-\noff feature itself was engaged at the time of the crash, however, the NTSB\nmandates that fatal accidents involving Level 2 driver-assistance systems\nengaged 30 seconds prior to a collision are reported to the agency.\n\nGet the InsideEvs Newsletter\n\nSign Up Today\n\nFord has BlueCruise hardware standard on most compatible Ford vehicles\nstarting late last year. Reports indicate that the Mach-E involved in the\ncrash was equipped with BlueCruise, likely prompting the investigation to\ndetermine if the feature was engaged and what exactly may have happened in the\nmoments leading up to the crash.\n\nAt this point, the probe is preliminary and meant to gather more information\nabout the crash. NTSB issued the following statement on the purpose of its\ninvestigation:\n\n> NTSB is investigating this fatal crash due to its continued interest in\n> advanced driver assistance systems and how vehicle operators interact with\n> these technologies. A team of investigators from the NTSB\u2019s Special\n> Investigations Branch of the Office of Highway Safety will travel to San\n> Antonio to examine the wreckage and collect information about the accident\n> site and sequence of events leading to the collision.\n\nIf BlueCruise was enabled, the inability to detect the stationary vehicle late\nat night isn't exactly surprising. Most driver assistance systems, including\nadaptive cruise control systems with AEB, ignore stationary objects. This is\nbecause most systems are tuned to utilize long-range radar to gauge the\ndistance of moving objects, not stationary ones.\n\nIf the car's vision-based camera system is unable to detect the vehicle and\nits radar system is tuned to ignore stationary objects, a non-moving vehicle\nparked late at night without lights on may have been undetectable until the\ncollision.\n\nA preliminary report outlining the NTSB's findings is expected to be issued in\nabout a month.\n\nMore News\n\nFisker Ocean Braking Issue That Prompted NHTSA Probe Was Fixed With An OTA\nUpdate\n\nMore Headaches For GM's Cruise As NHTSA Probes Pedestrian Risks\n\n++\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on Flipboard\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Send to email\n\nComment!\n\nGot a tip for us?
