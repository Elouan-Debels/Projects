If you had a Proton Account\nbefore April 9, 2024, you will receive an additional one-year grace period,\nmeaning you have until April 9, 2026 to log in to your account.\n\n## How to stay active on these products\n\nYou are considered active if you log in and use our services once a year.\nSimply logging in to any Proton service on our web, desktop, or mobile apps at\nleast once a year is enough.\n\nIf you are already logged in, you should use one of our products at least once\na year (for example, access your inbox, read an email, connect to a VPN\nserver, etc.).\n\nActivity is considered by account, not by email address. Keeping an active\naccount ensures that any email addresses you created for that account\n(@proton.me, @pm.me, etc.) also remain active.\n\n## When does this inactive account policy go into effect?\n\nIn our terms and conditions, we have always reserved the right to deactivate\ninactive free accounts after one year, but we never enforced this policy.\n\nAs of April 9, 2024, we will begin enforcing the inactive account policy\noutlined here. If you had a Proton Account before April 9, 2024, you will\nreceive an additional one-year grace period, meaning you have until April 9,\n2026 to log in to your account.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### Can someone else take over my email address after it was deactivated?\n\nNo. For example: You\u2019re on a Proton Free plan and your email address is\nalice@proton.me. If your Proton Mail account is inactive for 12 months or\nlonger, we may deactivate it. This means you will no longer be able to access\nyour account. No one will be able to use alice@proton.me either.\n\n### I don\u2019t know if I can stay active once every year. What should I do?\n\nWe understand that sometimes events can keep you away from your devices for an\nextended time. That\u2019s why we set a one-year period before your account is\nconsidered inactive instead of the original three-month period we had in\nProton\u2019s terms and conditions.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to log in to your account at least once a\nyear, please contact our Support team and we\u2019d be happy to assist you.\n\n### Why can\u2019t I reclaim my email after it was deactivated?\n\nWhen offering new email domains such as @proton.me, in the interest of our\nusers, we want to:\n\n  * Ensure that a diverse choice of email addresses is available.\n  * Protect our users by preventing different people from sharing the same username on different domains. For example, there should never be 2 different users owning john.smith@proton.me and john.smith@protonmail.com. This helps prevent impersonation attempts.\n  * Manage our resources, as offering free email addresses that are never used is unsustainable.\n\nTo guarantee the above, we now enforce this inactive accounts policy and\nprevent the reactivation of existing addresses.\n\nOn this page\n\n  * What happens when you\u2019re inactive\n  * How to stay active on these products\n  * When does this inactive account policy go into effect?\n  * Frequently asked questions\n\nCombine or delete account\n\n  * How to connect an existing SimpleLogin account to a Proton Account\n  * How to delete your Proton Account\n  * How to combine multiple Proton Accounts\n\n##\n\nDidn\u2019t find what you were looking for?\n\nGet help\n\nGeneral contactcontact@proton.me\n\nMedia contactmedia@proton.me\n\nLegal contactlegal@proton.me\n\nPartnerships contactpartners@proton.me\n\nProton - Privacy by default\n\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n\nProton AG\n\nRoute de la Galaise 32 1228 Plan-les-Ouates Geneva, Switzerland\n\nBuilt with support from\n\nSchweizerische Eidgenossenschaft\n\nConf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Suisse\n\nConfederazione Svizzera\n\nConfederaziun Svizra\n\nSwiss Confederation\n\nInnosuisse - Swiss Innovation Agency\n\nThis project is supported by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 program (Grant\nNo 848554)\n\n  * System status(new window)\n  * Report abuse\n  * Report a problem\n  * Report a security issue\n  * Request a feature(new window)\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Transparency report\n  * \u00a9 2024 Proton AG.
