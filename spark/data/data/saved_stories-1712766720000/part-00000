Philip\nWong.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is always going to want to cram more transistors\ninto processors, but as Liu and Wong outline in a IEEE Spectrum report, AI has\nmade this demand even more insatiable. Established companies and startups are\nsnapping up as many GPUs as they can for the use of running AI workloads, and\nnaturally chips with higher performance density are in high demand.\n\nLiu and Wong argue that today's 100-billion transistor GPUs just won't cut it:\none trillion transistors in a single GPU will be needed. The two argue that\nthis trillion-transistor chip can come about as early as 2034, a decade from\ntoday.\n\nWhile newer nodes with increased transistor density will be an important part\nin getting to one trillion transistors, it's not enough on its own. Instead,\nLiu and Wong say 3D chiplets, the cutting-edge technology of connecting\nseveral chips together beside and on top of each other, are going to be\ncrucial for achieving one trillion transistors.\n\n\"The continuation of the trend of increasing transistor count will require\nmultiple chips, interconnected with 2.5D or 3D integration, to perform the\ncomputation,\" the article says. \"We are now putting together many chips into a\ntightly integrated, massively interconnected system.\"\n\nThe argument for requiring both chiplets and 3D chip stacking for the world's\nfirst one-trillion transistor GPU is pretty simple. The largest size for a\nsingle chip depends on the reticule limit of the node used for manufacturing,\nand today the largest reticule limits cap out at around 800mm^2. Not only is\nproducing such a processor expensive, it's not even big enough to hit a\ntrillion transistors any time soon.\n\nNot only can chiplets break beyond the reticule limit (and they already have\non many cutting-edge processors), but the approach can also reduce\nmanufacturing costs, especially if individual chiplets are on the smaller\nside.\n\n  * Standardization could open door to third-party chiplets in AMD designs\n  * Gelsinger splits Intel in two to advance foundry vision\n  * Things are going to get weird as the nanometer era draws to a close\n  * 2024 sure looks like an exciting year for datacenter silicon\n\nStacking chips on top of each other, 3D stacking, is another necessary\ncomponent according to Liu and Wong; there's only so much room on a substrate,\nand when that room runs out horizontally, going up is the only option left.\nTheir discussion of 3D stacking largely focuses on high bandwidth memory (HBM)\nchips, which are the memory of choice for the latest datacenter GPUs.\n\nHowever, 3D chip stacking isn't just for increasing memory density. For\ninstance, AMD's 3D V-Cache technology can place a 64MB slice of L3 cache on\ntop of its chiplet-based CPUs in the Ryzen and Epyc lineups. There's also no\nreason why a company couldn't stack a processing chip on top of another\nprocessing chip if it was necessary, though it might prove problematic in\nrespect to power and heat.\n\nThe idea of hitting one trillion transistors on a single GPU in a decade isn't\nout of the range of possibility. Following the historical trend of transistor\ncount increases since 2008 per a graph TSMC made, it takes around eight to 10\nyears for transistor count to increase tenfold. In 2008, the limit was one\nbillion, and in 2016 the 10-billion transistor barrier was broken. Then the\n100-billion transistor barrier was passed a few days ago with Nvidia's\nBlackwell GPUs.\n\nBy the way, if you're at all familiar with Nvidia's datacenter products, you\nmight be confused that TSMC says the limit is at 100 billion transistors, as\nNvidia's Grace-Hopper GH200 is said to have over 200 billion transistors. TSMC\nseems to not count Nvidia's CPU-GPU combo devices, probably because they're\nnot on the same package.\n\nWhile TSMC is talking up a trillion transistors by 2034, Intel CEO Pat\nGelsinger says he can do it by 2030, just six years from now. Like TSMC,\nGelsinger says the key is in 3D stacking, but he clearly thinks Intel can do\nit better and faster than TSMC can. The Intel CEO also discusses transistor-\nlevel improvements like Ribbon FETs and backside power delivery, something\nthat's conspicuously absent from Liu and Wong's essay.\n\nWhether the first trillion-transistor GPU (or CPU) comes in 2030 or 2034, it's\nclear that multi-chip designs with 3D stacking will be the path forward. The\nlatest nodes just aren't boosting density like they used to, to the point\nwhere 3D stacking seems to be merely offsetting this decline rather than\nincreasing the pace of innovation. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AMD\n  * Intel\n  * Nvidia\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AMD\n  * Intel\n  * Nvidia\n  * TSMC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * Epyc\n  * GTC\n  * Mobileye\n  * Omniverse\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * vPro\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n  * Xilinx\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FPGA\n\n#### More about\n\n15 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AMD\n  * Intel\n  * Nvidia\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AMD\n  * Intel\n  * Nvidia\n  * TSMC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * Epyc\n  * GTC\n  * Mobileye\n  * Omniverse\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * vPro\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n  * Xilinx\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FPGA\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Intel Gaudi's third and final hurrah is an AI accelerator built to best\nNvidia's H100\n\nIntel Vision Goodbye dedicated AI hardware and hello to a GPU that fuses Xe\ngraphics DNA with Habana chemistry\n\nSystems20 hrs | 1\n\n#### TSMC's 3nm node powers up, setting stage for tech giants' next-gen chips\n\nAMD, Apple, Intel throw weight \u2013 and cash \u2013 behind process technology\n\nSystems14 days | 3\n\n#### Kaby Lake-G chip back from the grave, now on modest firewall-router-NAS\nmobo\n\nIntel CPU that incorporated an AMD GPU into the processor package resurrected\nby Topton\n\nSystems14 days | 7\n\n#### Developing AI workloads is complex.
