More specifically, it\nraises potential concerns under data protection, consumer law, competition law\nand the Digital Markets Act. This paper analyses what issues this conduct\ncreates under these areas of EU law and assesses the overall legality of the\npay-or-okay model.\n\nKeywords: Pay-or-okay, GDPR, Digital Competition Law, DMA, UCPD, Meta, Consent\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nD'Amico, Alessia Sophia and Pelekis, Dionysios and Santos, Cristiana and\nDuivenvoorde, Bram, Meta's Pay-or-Okay Model: An Analysis Under EU Data\nProtection, Consumer, and Competition Law (March 28, 2024).
