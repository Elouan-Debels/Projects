During these times,\nusers looking to find a ride on the app will see the option of hailing a\nprivate driver, with the price being the same as that of a taxi.\n\nTransport minister Tetsuo Saito (center) and Kono hail a ride using a ride-hailing app during an event in Tokyo's Edogawa Ward on Monday. | JIJI\n\nAs for drivers, although anyone with a Japanese driver's license \u2014 including\nforeign nationals \u2014 can apply to become one, not just anyone can hit the road.\n\nCandidates are required to apply to a taxi company and go through several\nrounds of interviews.\n\nThose who pass the interview stage are required to participate in 10 hours of\ntraining, and only then can the drivers sign up for shifts on the apps.\nDrivers are then paid an hourly wage, which varies from company to company.\n\nTo ensure safety, drivers are required to conduct a self-check of their car,\nhealth and alcohol level before each shift and report it on the app.\n\nInterest in becoming a private driver has been higher than expected, Kawanabe\nsaid, with at least 10,000 people having applied in Tokyo in the first month\nsince applications opened. As taxi companies have been scrambling to prepare\nfor the system launch over the past few weeks, many have a backlog of\napplicants but hope to get through them as swiftly as possible.\n\nAs of Monday, Nihon Kotsu, one of the largest taxi companies in Japan, had\naround 60 private drivers who have gone through the entire process and are\nready to provide rides in Tokyo. Several hundred more people are at the\ninterview and training stages.\n\nWithin the first 90 minutes of the launch on Monday morning, private drivers\nprovided over 50 rides.\n\nTokyo is among the four areas \u2014 which also include places in Kanagawa\nPrefecture, the city of Kyoto and Nagoya \u2014 that have been approved by the\ntransport ministry to begin ride-hailing services this month. Eight other\nareas, including Osaka, Fukuoka and Hiroshima, are set to be included in the\nnext phase of the rollout, planned for May.\n\n\u201cI hear that there is a lot of interest from both taxi companies as well as\nprivate drivers (in participating in the ride-hailing service),\u201d Saito said\nduring the ceremony. \u201cThe transport ministry is currently working to collect\ndata on the times and areas of taxi shortages and we hope to start the service\nas quickly as possible all across the country.\u201d\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nRIDE-HAILING(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/ride-hailing),\nUBER(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/uber),\nDIDI(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/didi),\nGO(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/go),\nS.RIDE(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/sride),\nAPPS(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/apps), SHARING\nECONOMY(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/sharing-economy),\nDRIVING(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/driving),\nJOBS(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/jobs),\ntaxis(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/taxis)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
