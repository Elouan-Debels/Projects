Tablets weren\u2019t around yet\n(since it was an Apple fanatic I\u2019m sure he figured out a way to be a fan of\ntablets somehow, once Apple made one) and I never used netbooks so I can\u2019t\nspeak to how bad or good they were.\n\nI didn\u2019t save the post but I think he also had an analogy about apple pie.\nThose gross fast-food apple pie wrappers dunked in the French fries machine,\nhe thought those were an OK thing for on the go, and nothing beats a real\nhomebaked apple pie, and he was slagging a burger chain that tried some sorta\ncompromise between them. I can\u2019t speak for that example either since the first\nkind is not particularly good and I never tried that \u201ccompromise version\u201d\nmyself.\n\nBut the general principle I find applies to many cases where I do agree.\n\nOften times when other people see a lagom Goldilocks sweetspot, I see a\nwatered-down, unergonomic compromise.\n\nThis shines through in a lot of my tooling and libraries; I want tools that\nare comfy and dwimmy and magicky for the common things but that let you access\nthe more robust and verbose and boring and complete solutions when you do need\nthem. I\u2019m OK with it being incredibly hacky and flaky because I know that the\nreal thing is just around the corner waiting for me as soon as the chintzy\nstuff doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nA lot of the bad syntax decisions we see in supposedly lightweight markup\nlanguages come from starting out with a low-feature, coarse-grained writing\nexperience where you pretty much only needed to support paragraphs and\nemphasis and if you wanted more, you knew where to find it, but then those\nlanguages were extended in ways that really crammed things in where they\ndidn\u2019t really fit.\n\nMy friend Halo once said \u201cSandra, you always go for the overwrought super\ndeluxe versions on Kickstarters\u201d but it\u2019s more like I\u2019ve got an excluded-\nmiddle mentality. I\u2019ll go for the super cheap black-and-white laser printed on\nscrap paper DIY proxy version with bottle caps and playing cards. Cheap, easy,\nlow environmental impact. Or the deluxe version. For the ages.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
