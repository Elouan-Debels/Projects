This degradation is caused by\nthe electrodes themselves degrading, including the graphite anode in certain\nbattery configurations fracturing. For a few years it\u2019s been known that pulsed\ncurrent (PC) charging can prevent much of this damage compared to constant\ncurrent (CC) charging. The mechanism behind this was the subject of a recent\nresearch article by [Jia Guo] and colleagues as published in Advanced Energy\nMaterials.\n\nRaman spectra of a) as-cycled and b) surface-removed graphite anodes aged\nunder CC and Pulse-2000 charging. FE-SEM images of the cross-sections of\ngraphite electrodes aged with CC (c,d) and Pulse-2000 (e,f) charging. d,f) are\nedge-magnified images of (c,e). g) shows the micrograph and O and C element\nmapping of the surface of CC-aged graphite electrode. TEM images of h) fresh,\ni) CC, and j) Pulse-2000 aged graphite anodes. (Credit: Jia Guo et al., 2024)\n\nThe authors examined the damage to the electrodes after multiple CC and PC\ncycles using Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy along with lifecycle\nmeasurements for CC and PC charging at 100 Hz (Pulse-100) and 2 kHz\n(Pulse-2000). Matching the results from the lifecycle measurements, the\nelectrodes in the Pulse-2000 sample were in a much better state, indicating\nthat the mechanical stress from pulse current charging is far less than that\nfrom constant current charging. A higher frequency with the PC shows increased\nimprovements, though as noted by the authors, it\u2019s not known yet at which\nfrequencies diminishing returns will be observed.\n\nThe use of PC vs CC is not a new thing, with the state-of-the-art in electric\nvehicle battery charging technology being covered in a 2020 review article by\n[Xinrong Huang] and colleagues as published in Energies. A big question with\nthe many different EV PC charging modes is what the optimum charging method is\nto maximize the useful lifespan of the battery pack. This also applies to\nlithium-metal batteries, with a 2017 research article by [Zi Li] and\ncolleagues in Science Advances providing a molecular basis for how PC charging\nsuppresses the formation of dendrites .\n\nWhat this demonstrates quite well is that the battery chemistry itself is an\nimportant part, but the way that the cells are charged and discharged can be\njust as influential, with the 2 kHz PC charging in the research by [Jia Guo]\nand colleagues demonstrating a doubling of its cycle life over CC charging.\nConsidering the amount of Li-ion batteries being installed in everything from\nsmartphones and toys to cars, having these last double as long would be very\nbeneficial.\n\nThanks to [Thomas Yoon] for the tip.\n\nPosted in ScienceTagged lithium ion, Lithium-ion battery\n\n## 31 thoughts on \u201cWhy Pulse Current Charging Lithium-Ion Batteries Extends\nTheir Useful Lifespan\u201d\n\n  1. cyclops says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 5:20 am\n\nThis reminds me a little bit of https://www.rctalk.com/dyna-pro-digital-\ndischarger/\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  2. thom says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 5:22 am\n\nPC also works on lead acid.

They don\u2019t even care about the environmental costs\nof those practices, never mind caring about your convenience or your bank\naccount.\n\nThey want the lifespan of your batteries to be shorter, not longer, so it\nseems likely that pulsed charging will have to be legislated if it\u2019s ever to\nbe the norm in consumer devices.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1. ian 42 says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 6:18 am\n\n+1 \u2013 yep, planned obsolescence.

They have a choice of doubling the\ncharge time or doubling the instantaneous current; I think the first citation\ndoubled the charge time. Both methods should be tested in the same experiment\nto compare the effects that may come from temperature and other factors.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1.

C says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 7:29 am\n\nYou should have read the paper. Or at least skimmed through it and looked at\nthe graphs like I did. It shows that it pulses a current of 2C at 50% duty\ncycle. Charging time remains the same. We already know a lower charging\ncurrent (or lowering it once the battery warms up) increases lifespan of the\nbattery. But this technique has the same effective charging current.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1. pelrun says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 7:55 am\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of the main reasons we have to limit CC\ncharging to 1C is due to the depletion effects described in the paper, and so\npeak current can go higher as long as the relaxation periods are present to\nkeep the cells healthy.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  7. DOugl says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 6:43 am\n\nWhy aren\u2019t all charging systems using it is a good question but the obvious\nquestion in that regard is the duty cycle of Pulse-2000? If it\u2019s 50% like\nshown in the above first image then it\u2019ll mean at least 2x the charge time.\nOthers have shown that slower charging than max 1C charging is better for the\nbattery life and others have shown it\u2019s better to charge more regularly but a\nsmaller percent(30-40%) SoC instead of fewer but deeper discharge/charge\ncycles. Heating and the expansion that brings seems to be a contributing\nfactor and Pulse-2000 is going to reduce that heating unless the duty cycle is\nquite high compared to what\u2019s shown(50/50).\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Thoms Yoon says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 6:55 am\n\nThey double the peak charge current to get the same charge time. This\nunfortunately doubles the average I squared R conduction loss heating, so it\nwould be disadvantageous in hotter environments or insufficiently cooled\nbattery packs.

I like to\nthink that if they come up with a better way to charge batteries so they last\nlonger, it will be sold as a feature, at lest until the tech is put on a chip\nand everybody has it, and I do not think it will be long before it is a common\nfeature in charging/management chips.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2. sweethack says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 8:17 am\n\nAnd to the planet too.

First because to get the same charging speed, you need to\ncrank up the current to 2C instead of 1C. And since default charging algorithm\nis CV then CC, it means there\u2019s a feedback circuit that\u2019s measuring the\nbattery voltage and current input. If you chop the output, that circuit will\nonly see half the value on average which might be catastrophic for the\nfeedback loop.\n\nInstead, I think a programmable charger can be tweaked to only measure current\n& voltage during the on state of the PWM (ideally, at the end of the pulse so\nthe transient is done)\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  10. rasz_pl says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 9:40 am\n\nWasnt pulse charging also popular for NiCd?
