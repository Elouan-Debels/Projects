Protestors have locked arms\nthrough a combination of pipes and barrels.\n\nA sleeping dragon is a maneuver used by protesters to hinder their removal\nfrom a protest site. A series of protesters are handcuffed together through\nPVC pipe, which prevents police from simply using bolt cutters to break the\nhandcuffs. Advanced variations include covering the PVC pipe with elements\nwhich might make it more difficult to break. Examples include chicken wire,\ntar, and duct tape. Another variation is filling a barrel with concrete and\nputting the PVC pipe through the barrel such that it cannot be accessed\nwithout first destroying all of the concrete.\n\nOften the protesters will chain, lock, or otherwise secure themselves to\nimmovable objects, resulting in a difficult-to-remove human obstacle. This is\ntypically accomplished best with carabiners tied to their wrists so that the\nprotestors can easily unlock themselves, though they cannot be unlocked by\noutsiders.\n\n## Removal methods[edit]\n\nArkansas State Police officers being trained in the removal of a sleeping\ndragon, using mannequins.\n\nIt is sometimes impossible for officers to know what is inside the sleeping\ndragon without cutting into it.^[1] Officers may cut into the pipe with such\ntools as an angle grinder, rotary saw, or whizzer saw, followed by a pry bar\nand pliers; or in the case of concrete, chipping hammers, hammer drills, and\nbreakers. Abrasive saws, a band saw, and an angle grinder may be used on steel\npipes.^[2] Officers may put fire retardant hoods and earmuffs on the\nprotesters to protect them from sparks and noise as tools are used to cut\nthrough the sleeping dragon.^[3]\n\nOnce an inspection hole has been made, it may be possible to reach in with\nbolt cutters and cut the handcuff chain.^[2]\n\nIn 2018, Seattle police established an Apparatus Removal Team (ART) in\nresponse to sleeping dragon protests, its officers being trained and equipped\nto cut through plastic and metal without injuring protesters. Their approach\ninvolves cutting into tubing and placing a brightly colored piece of plastic\nagainst the protester's skin, so that the blade will produce visible plastic\nshavings before it can cause any injury.^[4]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Lock-on (protest tactic)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Moshtaghian, Artemis (12 October 2017). \"There are two sides to the story behind a strange protest photo\".
