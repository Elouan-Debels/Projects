The Sensible Centrists like to\nimagine that this is a careful, deliberative process. Ideas are debated, among\npeople of good faith, and assessed dispassionately, on their merits, in an\nongoing collective striving for truth.\n\nBut this is nonsense. As we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the Cass Report, what\nactually happens is a mixture of magical thinking, conformism and moral\ngrandstanding coalesces under a thin veneer of rational objectivity \u2014 and\neveryone except the most stubbornly reality-oriented falls obediently into\nline. And amid the chaos of frantic back-pedalling and rewriting of history,\nthis consensus can form and re-form in real time without its basic structure\never changing, or lessons ever being learned.\n\nMost egregiously of all, Ruth Hunt, former CEO of Stonewall, denied to the\nTimes that on her watch Stonewall fostered a stifling climate of \u201cno debate\u201d\non gender ideology. On the contrary, she said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely someone who has\nalways been working in the middle ground, trying to build consensus.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s leave aside the fact that, as the Times points out, under Hunt\u2019s\nleadership Stonewall called for schools to \u201cshred\u201d the only schools guidance\non gender even remotely in line with Cass recommendations. Let\u2019s ignore the\ntestimony of veteran gay rights activist and one-time Stonewall spokeswoman\nAnya Palmer, who reports that Hunt promised her Stonewall would never embrace\ntrans activism, before pivoting to focus on almost nothing else. Let\u2019s instead\nconsider, for a moment, what it actually means to \u201cbuild consensus\u201d, in the\nHunt sense.\n\nPerhaps the most succinct literary anatomy of Huntish \u201cconsensus\u201d was written\nmore than two centuries before Hunt assumed leadership of Stonewall. In the\nfirst sentence of Pride and Prejudice (1813), Jane Austen informs us that \u201cIt\nis a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good\nfortune, must be in want of a wife.\u201d\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### How a cult captured the NHS\n\nBy Kathleen Stock\n\nIt\u2019s a one-line joke, that juxtaposes two distinct, and very differently coded\n\u201cways of knowing\u201d. In the process, too, it reveals that far from being\ndistinct, these two ways of thinking actually operate in lockstep.\n\n\u201cIt is a truth universally acknowledged\u201d stakes a claim to objectivity: the\nkind of fact that, as \u201cclassical liberals\u201d such as Ben Shapiro like to put it,\ndoesn\u2019t care about your feelings. This mode of knowing, central to the\nEnlightenment privileging of reason and objectivity, was (and still is)\nmasculine-coded. It gains its power from asserting that its truths will remain\ntrue whether or not you acknowledge them as such.\n\nAusten ironises this, by exposing the process of consensus-formation that lies\nbeneath many such claims: a dynamic less concerned with facts than social,\ncontextual meaning and desirable behaviour, captured in \u201ca good fortune\u201d and\n\u201cmust be in want of a wife\u201d. These phrases are loaded not with objectivity but\ncontext: an intricate and intimately feminine world of 18th-century social\nhierarchies and sex roles, afforded narrative urgency by the real privations\nthat faced unmarried \u201cgentlewomen\u201d excluded by social custom from paid\nemployment.\n\nThe punchline lies in the implication that what lurks under the bonnet of\n\u201ctruth universally acknowledged\u201d is often not truth but this feminine-coded\nmatrix of embedded meanings. Any effort at detached objectivity will be\nleavened by status-signalling and aspirational manoeuvring.\n\nMeanwhile, what holds this together is less the fact of its \u201ctruth\u201d but that\nit\u2019s \u201cuniversally acknowledged\u201d. That is, we\u2019re reading a normative statement\ndisguised as an objective one. And not just normative but prescriptive:\n\u201cuniversal\u201d has a faintly threatening undertone, suggesting that anyone who\nmatters acknowledges this truth, and by extension you probably should if you\ndon\u2019t want to be shunned.\n\nAusten\u2019s one-liner is the gently ironic opener to one of the greatest modern\nlove stories. But it points to a truth that today seems more pertinent than\never: that many modern truth-claims follow this structure, and are enforced\nthrough very similar social mechanisms.\n\nPerhaps the most totalising recent instance of this was Covid consensus-\nformation. It\u2019s dizzying now to read press reports from just before the Great\nCovid Panic took hold. Before this happened, Ian Bremmer approvingly describes\nexperts doing \u201can impressive job of calmly and professionally setting out the\nfactual framework behind the government\u2019s coronavirus strategy\u201d, while Boris\nJohnson accepts the moderate expert advice provided by Chris Witty to wash\nhands, protect the elderly but otherwise carry on with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### The Cass Report's cowardly converts\n\nBy Julie Bindel\n\nIt\u2019s yet more extraordinary to remember that in the 20 days after this article\nwas published on March 3, we witnessed a screeching media 180 from encouraging\n\u201cbusiness as usual\u201d to near-universal calls for lockdown.\n\nOver the period that followed, competing Covid claims and counter-claims were\nall larded with \u201cexperts\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d. Reviewing these now makes one thing\nclear: Austen\u2019s assessment of TUA remains true. Moral consensus precedes\nrationalisation. The Covid vibe shift may have been presented as scientific\nand factual; but what powered it was a chaotic tangle of magical thinking,\nfear, and the threat of social ostracism. The statement made by epidemiologist\nSir Mark Woolhouse to the Covid enquiry captures the social pressures boiling\nbeneath the claimed objectivity: \u201cThe emphasis on consensus and clear\nmessaging,\u201d he said, \u201cplus a sense of not wanting to \u2018rock the boat\u2019, made it\ndifficult to discuss these issues openly at the time.\u201d\n\nNo one likes being ignored, scorned, or shunned. No wonder so many Sensibles\nfall obediently into line on every TUA. Take TV presenter and quintessential\nSensible Kirstie Allsopp, who last year waded vigorously into the what she\ncalled \u201cthe trans moral panic\u201d on the Stonewall side. Her reward was a pat on\nthe back from the Daily Stormer of gender woo, Pink News, for opinions \u201cbacked\nup by science and facts\u201d. It\u2019s more accurate, though, to describe her opinions\nas (at the time) robustly supported by the moral hive-mind that determines and\nthen enforces the Truth Universally Acknowledged.\n\nHere, again, the comparison with Austen is instructive. In Austen\u2019s day,\ngenteel moral consensus-formation happened within a social world of dinners,\nballs, picnics and other social events. Today, though, it\u2019s been\nprofessionalised, via what author Matt Goodwin calls a \u201cNew Elite\u201d comprising\nan \u201cepistemic class\u201d which dominates institutions such as TV, journalism,\nmuseums, charities and academia, and uses their influence to shape the public\nconversation in line with approved opinions.\n\nAnd yet, in some respects, nothing has changed. For many of these elite women\nwho, in Austen\u2019s time, would be eyeing one another over their fans at Lady So\nand So\u2019s, now work in New Elite industries, many of which are markedly female-\ndominated. Allsopp is a case in point: her parents are Lady and Baron Hindlip,\nand she is a Hon., though doesn\u2019t usually use the title. She has parlayed old-\nelite status into National Telly Treasure status, whence she holds forth on\nmoral issues with an unwavering moral certainty Austen would have recognised,\nand probably lampooned.\n\n\u201cNow the winds have changed, we find Kirstie Allsopp back-pedalling.\u201d\n\nSo, now the winds have changed, we find Allsopp also back-pedalling. It was\nnever true, she asserts, that there was \u201cno debate\u201d on the issue of medical\nexperiments on gender-confused children. Puberty blockers, Kirstie informs us,\nwere bad all along. But we could always talk about it: \u201cit is, and always has\nbeen possible to debate these things and those saying there was no debate are\nwrong\u201d. All the people (mostly women) unfairly fired or bullied out of jobs,\nall the grannies punched in Hyde Park by men with special identities, the no-\nplatforming, the intimidation, the threats, and the censorship \u2014 that wasn\u2019t\nactually a thing.\n\nAllsopp is the clearest indicator yet that at least where child gender\nvivisection is concerned, at least some of the grandes dames of Truth\nUniversally Acknowledged may have paused broadcasting a TUA in order to\nconvince themselves, in the light of a new emerging groupthink, that the new\nconsensus is what they believed all along. And because moral consensus\nprecedes its \u201cexpert\u201d rationalisation, so we also find that those who purport\nto stand for science and reason are also curiously quiet.\n\nOn Sunday, for example, Sex Matters founder Maya Forstater (herself\nnotoriously a victim of the \u201cNo Debate\u201d consensus Kirstie Allsopp says never\nexisted) called on science communicator and Humanists UK president Adam\nRutherford to defend systematic scientific reviews, against the trans\nactivists spreading misinformation about the Cass Review. Did he come out\nswinging for science and reason over gender ideology? Reader, he flunked it:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I know much about.\u201d\n\nLast November, Humanists UK welcomed a Private Members\u2019 Bill banning\n\u201cconversion therapy\u201d \u2014 in a formulation that would, in effect, ban anything\nbut the \u201caffirmation\u201d approach to gender identity, recently decried by the\nCass Review as unsupported by evidence and potentially harmful to children\nwhose sense of self is still developing. Perhaps Rutherford is waiting, as\nmany commentators did during Covid, until it becomes obvious which Truth\nUniversally Acknowledged was always obviously supported by the evidence.\n\nWe can hardly blame him. I don\u2019t doubt his vaunted commitment to even\nuncomfortable scientific truth. But if Covid taught us anything, it\u2019s that\nscientific truth can be \u2014 with the best of intentions \u2014 somewhat ductile,\nespecially weighed against the risk of ostracism by every desirable dinner-\nparty hostess in medialand. But should those hostesses resume broadcasting\ntheir TUA, having agreed that they always believed puberty blockers were bad,\nperhaps the Rutherfords of our public discourse will feel able to hop back in\nthe trenches on behalf of science, objectivity, and Dr Hilary Cass.\n\nOverall, though, no lessons will be learned. None was learned from Covid, for\nall that Woolhouse described the lockdown policy bluntly as a \u201cfailure\u201d. Not\neven a recent report showing the appalling and preventable harm lockdowns did\nto a generation of children seems to have prompted much soul-searching among\nthose who advocated loudest for such measures.\n\nAnd this is because the unhappy inference is that we\u2019re still stuck in the\nsame paradigm: the chattering-class two-step of moral groupthink masquerading\nas science. Just like Johnson in 2020, we\u2019re still looking to \u201cexperts\u201d as a\nmeans of outsourcing moral judgement \u2014 and as someone to blame when things go\nwrong. Even Hunt, on whose watch Stonewall helped entrench gender ideology in\npublic health, is now busy describing her \u201cregret\u201d at having naively \u201ctrusted\nthe experts\u201d.\n\nIn truth, though, \u201cexperts\u201d are a front for the TUA: the chattering-class\nmoral consensus. And this is manufactured by people who care less about being\nright than looking virtuous. Career moral entrepreneurs such as Hunt; vacuous\ngrandes dames such as Allsopp; \u201ccommunicators\u201d such as Rutherford whose job is\nto make consensus look sciency. Downstream of their posturing, children were\nirreversibly harmed. They didn\u2019t care; they wanted to look kinder than you.\nThey should not be allowed to forget how wrong they got it.\n\nMary Harrington is a contributing editor at UnHerd.\n\nmoveincircles\n\n## Join the discussion\n\n### Join like minded readers that support our journalism by becoming a paid\nsubscriber\n\n### To join the discussion in the comments, become a paid subscriber.\n\n#### Join like minded readers that support our journalism, read unlimited\narticles and enjoy other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n195 Comments\n\nMost Voted\n\nNewest Oldest\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nJ Bryant\n\n13 hours ago\n\nOutstanding essay.

The problem is as much about those who\nfollow blindly or acquiesce indifferently to the nonsense presented as the\nthose who first pronounce the nonsense.\n\nI spent most of the 2003-15 period away from British society and was startled\nby the change. Instead of a delight in argument my old friends seemed to have\nbecome conformists desperate not to say anything controversial.

The middle class, if in\nemployment, appears to be a largely debate free zone. This may be in part the\nnatural consequence of increasing job insecurity which encourages the extreme\ncaution which can be exploited by entrepreneurial ideologues such as the\nStonewall leadership and their American backers. It is noticeable that the BBC\nbecame monolithically progressive only after its employees were put on short\nterm contracts.\n\nAnother factor is that schools increasingly teach rote conformity to safe\nanswers to exam questions rather than how to think effectively. Universities\ncannot be surprised if their new students persist in seeking new orthodoxies\nthat they can safely embrace.\n\nNo doubt there are also other factors explaining the craven conformity of so\nmany.\n\nIf our system breeds slaves then it is inevitable that nonsense will be left\nunchallenged.\n\nFortunately, I see signs of a reaction. I think many want to see a revival in\ndebate and in the critical examination of ideas and policies. Twitter is being\nreplaced by Podcasts, polling suggests that teenagers \u2013 especially boys \u2013 are\nrebelling and even journalists are relearning the lesson that they can build\ncareers by attacking instead of supporting the excesses of the consensus.

I can easily imagine a counterfactual\nwhere Cass gets rubbished, but some other event further into the future then\ntriggers the sentiment flip. This all is literally about herd behaviour and\nmass sentiment, with a few holdouts (who, to be clear, can be equally deluded,\nlike the Japanese soilder in the jungle). I am interested in what causes the\n\u2018wave collapse\u2019 that marks the making or breaking of mass consensus. Anyone\nwho has observed the markets for any length of time will know that group\nsentiment can drive the \u2018valuation\u2019 of an asset to reality-bending levels\n(e.g. Tulips) and then the consensus breaks, sometimes all of a sudden and all\nhell breaks loose and people get hurt, or sometimes more of a wimper over a\nperiod of time, e.g. the dotnet bubble didn\u2019t go pop with a big bang, but\ninstead deflated like a puncture over a couple of years or so, but the net\neffect is the same and people get hurt, e.g. Nasdaq went down nearly 80%\nbetween March 2000 and October 2002.

On the face of\nit, political pragmatists who ignore principles and simply do deals between\nopposing sides in any argument because that\u2019s the best way forward, look like\nrational actors whose lack of interest in ideology seems to emphasise their\nimpartiality, and consequently the degree of trust we might possess in their\ncompetence.\n\nIn actuality what really happens is that systematically operating on these\nprinciples has the perverse consequence that more extreme policies become\npossible, not less so \u2013 the exact opposite of what is apparently intended by\nconsensus politics. The reason it happens is that activists find that because\nthere is never any need to defend their ideas, all that matters is the amount\nof trouble they can cause because that\u2019s what actually forms the basis of\ntheir power. So if you\u2019re an activist, there\u2019s no need to compromise or deal\nwith sceptical analysis of your demands: the government will do that, all you\nhave to do is screech and scream until you get what you say you want, and the\nmore extreme your demands, the more you drag government policy to where you\nwant it.\n\nIn other words, the Overton Window ends up positioned exclusively by warring\nextremists, with moderate voices becoming irrelevant to policymakers.

It has an answer that is simple, universal and correct:\n\u201cyou\u201d (the government) should do nothing. If there\u2019s no evidence on which to\nbase a decision, then doing things anyway is the politicians fallacy:\nsomething must be done, this is something, therefore it must be done. The\nproblem is that literally any imaginable action can be justified this way.\nEven if one of them turns out later on to have been a good choice, if you\u2019re\nmaking a decision based on nothing then the outcome is going to be nearly\nrandom (or more likely, biased towards things that reinforce social status),\nand thus nearly always going to be incorrect. It leads to Lisa\u2019s tiger-\nrepelling rock. When we\u2019re talking about the government (vs individuals) this\nis compounded by two more problems: governments tend to force people to do\ntheir random thing, and also ban any alternatives, so exploration of the\ndecision space stops. This is a great way to ensure that no real science gets\ndone (as it requires the ability to do experiments and compare outcomes). This\nis all independent of COVID. It\u2019s true of many other situations. In the\nabsence of extremely strong and widely accepted evidence, the correct thing\nfor governments to do is always nothing.\n\n4\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nRasmus Fogh\n\n4 hours ago\n\nReply to Norman Powers\n\nI strongly disagree with that. Decision making under uncertainty is a standard\nproblem. Military officers do it, businessmen do it, politicians do it,\nindividuals do it. Because they *have* to. There is always risk. If you wait\ntill you know for certain, others with higher risk tolerance will have got the\nbusiness, or conquered the city, or the chance of solving the problem will\nhave evaporated.\n\nThe point is that it is not a question of knowing either nothing or\neverything. Even in science you get your answers as probability values. For\nthe most reliable science the probabilities can get quite extreme, but often\nyou are less well off. And in real life things can get quite uncertain. That\nis when you need to be able to decide what to do about a modest chance of a\nvery bad outcome. And most people do do something about it \u2013 they buy\ninsurance. They do not wait to see whether their house is really going to\nburn.\n\nAs it happens, my take from the COVID debate is that scientists are not that\ngood at taking important decisions under high uncertainty. Scientists are\ntrained to like certainty, to seek certainty, and to trust their models until\nthey are proved wrong. Tegnell and some of of his colleagues IMHO showed an\ninappropriate faith in their (flu-based) prior plans, and never really\nconsidered the \u2018what if this is worse?\u2019. Certainly the Danish Tegnells who\ntold when the virus hit the headlines that \u2018It will never be a big problem,\nand even if it is it will never make it to Europe, and even if it does it will\nnot kill many\u2019 did not impress by their foresight. With all the problems they\nhave, there is a case for leaving this kind of decision to politicians. Their\nmotives may be suspect, but at they are used to working under uncertainty.\n\n1\n\n-2\n\nReply\n\nAndrew R\n\n6 hours ago\n\nI find it rather amusing when it comes to the Covid debate, that the TUA crowd\nwere breaking the very rules they had put in place.

As a member of the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington\nstate, USA, we became a poster child for how to handle a massive Covid\noutbreak in our midst. Within a week of March 10, 2020, 53 of 64 chorale\nmembers at a rehearsal came down with Covid, proving without a doubt in our\nminds and the researchers who later studied our experience, that Covid was\ntransmitted by aerosols, not so much \u201ctouch surfaces\u201d. Within 2 weeks, 2 of\nour group had died, and many of us had our family lives and career paths\nabruptly redirected. We then walked a path, starting with shutdown and\nisolation, guided mostly by our own instincts and reinfection rates within our\nmembership, then onto rehearsals via Zoom, then to rehearsals in person but\nwith masks, social distancing, and in chilly, open air facilities. We Covid\ntested ourselves frequently, isolated when indicated, used carbon dioxide\nmonitors during rehearsals as a proxy for air contamination, and required\nvaccination in all members. We have since gradually \u201csoftened\u201d our\nrestrictions, and this summer break will again, 4 years later, consider what\nfurther of these safety measures we can modify, keep, or dispense with. I\nwon\u2019t try to directly compare Covid management with transgender \u201caffirmation\u201d\nvs \u201cgender straight\u201d dogma, but simply to note that, with Covid in a closed\ngroup setting, as is our chorale, our closely watched personal experience\ncertainly informs our approach to Covid along with considerable study of any\nscientific literature we can find. I will say that highly respected\ntransgender persons I know certainly have a wealth of personal data which\nstarted quite early in their lives and which should be given fair space in\nhelping them, individually, make important personal, medical, and familial\ndecisions. The age of self determination, however, certainly should be\ndetermined. The devil is in the details. That is what makes these sweeping\ngeneralizations so difficult to make and then implement. A little humility\nnever hurts, either.\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nReply\n\nEamonn Toland\n\n2 hours ago\n\nI\u2019m not sure that staking a claim to objectivity is universally acknowledged\nas masculine-coded.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAndrew Boughton\n\n35 minutes ago\n\nThe brilliant truth.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nSteve Jolly\n\n15 minutes ago\n\nGreat article from Mary as usual, but none of this is remotely surprising to\nme, because to me this is as obvious as the sun rising in the morning. It\u2019s\nrare that anyone not similarly socially disabled as myself actually begins to\nsee the extent to which human beings are guided not by reason, logic, and\nscience, but rather by each other, through the mechanism of establishing\nsocial norms and subtly coerced conformity. Most of this happens beneath the\nthreshold of conscious awareness in normal people. In me, it doesn\u2019t happen at\nall, which is why none of what Mary has written here with her usual skill\ncomes as any particular surprise. It\u2019s people being people as I\u2019ve come to\nunderstand them. People influence each other\u2019s perceptions, behaviors, and\nthinking in ways almost nobody realizes. I credit Mary for her observational\nskills in picking out a couple of issues like COVID and trans-activism as\nbeing nonsense and identifying human social behavior as the reason such\nnonsense can be sustained for any period of time. Unfortunately, this is only\nthe tip of the proverbial iceberg. Basically all human collective knowledge,\ncustoms, culture, and worldview was established not through reason and logic\nor even government propaganda, but through the organic social processes that\nMary has examined here. The establishing and enforcement of Truths Universally\nAcknowledged is in fact the normal way humans tease out what is true and\nfalse, normal and abnormal, and accepted or not accepted by society at\nwhatever time. It\u2019s a social process that has more to do with who is\nassociating with whom in what social circles and what is being discussed over\nthe water cooler in places of high influence and culture, such as corporate\nboardrooms, university lecture halls, and high levels of government. With her\nexample from Pride and Prejudice, a tale of the social intricacies of upper\nclass society, she hits quite near the mark. These are the places where common\nknowledge, common culture, and social norms are established. The process of\ndesiring acceptance into a group and subtly altering one\u2019s own perceptions and\nbeliefs to conform to the group is always operating. I don\u2019t believe normal\npeople are capable of turning it off, even for scientists, philosophers, and\nintellectuals. Few are even aware it exists and many are wholly driven by it\nwithout acknowledging or even realizing it (Mary names a few of these). The\nthemes and excuses change, but most of what humans regard as being true,\naccepted, and acceptable at any one point in time is equally subjective and\narbitrary. I can understand Mary\u2019s frustration. I was frustrated too when I\nwas first figuring all this out decades ago. Most people don\u2019t react well to\nlearning how little reason and logic there actually is in the formation of\nhuman knowledge, or to being told their cultural beliefs and values are just\nas temporal and arbitrary as those beliefs from all those civilizations that\nare now regarded as barbaric to the point of being detestable. This is what I\ncall the conceit of the Enlightenment. Modern man, particularly modern western\nEuropean man, likes to think this has changed, that now we have logic and\nreason to guide us, that now we\u2019re better than those benighted savages who\nworshiped the sun. We want to believe that because we have science, reason,\nand objectivity, we\u2019re better than that. In fact, the causality is reversed.\nThe logic and reason and science are simply the justification for believing\nmodern man is better. People are really good at creating reasons why their\ngroup is superior and better than other groups or those that came before. It\u2019s\none of the few constants one can trace throughout history. The reasons vary,\nand we can certainly debate the merits of one view or another, but we\u2019re\nlikely to favor what\u2019s familiar, even myself. I may be mostly immune to social\nforces but I am limited by my environment and experiences, which are\ninfluenced by society, which is driven by social forces. It\u2019s not all bad\nthough. The organic process of humans establishing collective ideas tends to\nreject nonsense eventually, but not immediately. Information can spread much\nquicker than it gets sorted as nonsense these days, and governments are almost\ninevitably composed of the most socially inclined people most devoted to their\ncollective culture, thus more susceptible to flying immediately off the handle\nover some great new cultural or intellectual fad. It\u2019s an unavoidable\nconsequence of technology advancing faster than people\u2019s ability to adapt to\nits effects, but people will adapt. They\u2019ll learn to be skeptical and reserve\njudgement, because things like the COVID \u2018consensus\u2019 and trans-activism show\nus how quickly the nonsense can take hold. We\u2019ll have to learn to exercise\ngreater skepticism, even skepticism of the science and reason that are held\nsacred by modern man. I expect the list of notable foul-ups where \u2018science\u2019,\n\u2018truth\u2019, and \u2018reason\u2019 were obviously guided by social nonsense to grow until\nthe lesson is learned, however temporarily until the wheel of society turns\nagain. If there is such a thing as truth, it must be that which endures the\nlong march of history. If there is such a thing as progress, it must occur\nthrough continuous, repeated failures and corrections.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nSophy T\n\n4 hours ago\n\nFor many of these elite women who, in Austen\u2019s time, would be eyeing one\nanother over their fans at Lady So and So\u2019s, now work in New Elite industries,\nmany of which are markedly female-dominated.
