It has privacy policies like App Tracking Transparency that\ncan limit the amount of data collected by third-party apps installed by users.\n\nHowever, a study by Aalto University that examined default apps and services\nincluded as part of a new iPhone found Apple's own apps can feed back a lot of\ndata to Apple. Also, that data was hard to prevent from being collected in the\nfirst place.\n\nThe researchers analyzed eight \"apps,\" specifically Safari, Siri, iMessage,\nFaceTime, and Find My, as well as settings for Family Sharing, Location\nServices, and Touch ID. Publicly-available privacy-related information was\ncollected from technical documentation and privacy policies for analysis.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nApple Adds MAJOR Feature to Vision Pro!

But the option\nonly enables whether Siri's voice control is used, and that Siri still\ncollects data in the background regardless of the user's choice.\n\nUsers have to go into the settings and make changes there to stop the\nbehavior, which the prompt seemingly offers without actually performing.\n\n## A confusing affair\n\nThe instructions to restrict data access were deemed \"very complex and\nconfusing\" by the report, with steps scattered in various online documents\nwithout any clear direction provided. The instructions also didn't provide all\nthe required steps, and declined to explain how any collected data was\nprocessed by Apple.\n\nTo try and prove that it was difficult for users, volunteers were interviewed\nand asked to change the settings. None of the participants managed to follow\nall of the instructions to prevent the data collection, but they were able to\ntake steps in the right direction.\n\nThere were also complaints that users weren't given feedback on whether they\nsucceed to disable data collection while dealing with privacy settings. Study\nparticipants allegedly went backwards in the process on occasion, and\nsometimes resorted to scrolling randomly for inspiration.\n\n## A collection mystery\n\nWhile stopping Apple's own data collection is difficult, researchers were also\nunable to find out exactly what Apple did with collected data in many cases.\n\nAfter failing to find definitive answers from public documents, Lindqvist\nproposed that it was likely the data would be used to train machine-learning\nsystems for services like Siri, or to provide more personalized user\nexperiences.\n\nThe professor offered that the seamless multi-device interactions users are\naccustomed to makes it hard to revert to a time of more limited data sharing\nwith companies. Even so, Lindqvist believes Apple could do better in being\nclearer with customers about what data is collected and what it is used for.\n\nTo avoid data collection from some apps, the report offers that users could\nuse third-party apps, which face tougher rules for data collection on iOS than\nwhat Apple itself abides by. This is something that critics of Apple have\npicked up on in the past, and has resulted in multiple lawsuits over the\ndisparity.\n\nApple has previously been open in acknowledging that it collects data on its\nusers to benefit its own services, and has done so for years. However, it\noften does so while minimizing the amount of data collected, and anonymizing\nthe data where possible.\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\nMalcolm Owen\n\nProduct Comparison Expert\n\nBased in South Wales, Malcolm Owen has written about tech since 2012, and\npreviously wrote for Electronista and MacNN.

When is the last time that you felt that something you did on an Apple\napp led to targeted ads? Now compare that to doing a Google search on ANY\ndevice or posting something on Instagram or Facebook... it is uncanny that all\nof a sudden you start seeing personalized ads. I may be naive on this I will\nadmit. Apple should outline what they are tracking and for what, but I doubt\nit will be nefarious or to target you as a customer.\n\nRead More on our Forums\n\n## Top Stories\n\n## Today only: Apple's 1TB MacBook Pro 14-inch with 19-core GPU drops to\n$1,949\n\n## Rumor: M4 MacBook Pro with AI enhancements expected at the end of 2024\n\n## Apple warning users about a mercenary spyware attack on iPhones\n\n## iPhone 16 Plus may expand to seven colors including white and purple\n\n## Apple wants to hire a PR heavyweight to battle the EU on its own soil\n\n## What to expect from Apple's Q2 2024 earnings on May 2\n\n## Apple's M2 MacBook Air drops to all-time low of $849 in latest price war\n\n## Latest comparisons\n\n## M3 15-inch MacBook Air vs M3 14-inch MacBook Pro \u2014 Ultimate buyer's guide\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M1 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M2 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## Latest News\n\n## Apple hardware chief John Ternus insists parts pairing is not evil\n\nApple SVP of Hardware Engineering John Ternus has defended Apple's use of\nparts pairing, while also insisting the company still supports the use of\nthird-party parts in repairs.\n\nMalcolm Owen | 59 minutes ago\n\n1\n\n## Espresso 17 Pro review: Magnetic & modular portable Mac monitor\n\nThe Espresso 17 Pro avoids the usual compromises in portable monitors by\noffering a large multi-touch glossy 4K retina-grade display with magnetic\nmodularity inspired by Apple's iPad.\n\nWesley Hilliard | 2 hours ago\n\n3\n\n## Rumor: M4 MacBook Pro with AI enhancements expected at the end of 2024\n\nApple's next generation M4 Apple Silicon, is expected to arrive before the end\nof 2024, and is rumored to have a greater focus on AI than ever before.\n\nRumor Score\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Possible\n\nMalcolm Owen | 3 hours ago\n\n4\n\n## Unfortunately, a surprise million-dollar App Store windfall for some\ndevelopers is a bug\n\nSome developers had an exciting morning, as a bug in App Store Connect\nmisreported millions in earnings from apps in the App Store for a while.\n\nMalcolm Owen | 5 hours ago\n\n2\n\n## Apple will allow activation of used parts in repairs by users & service\nshops\n\nApple is expanding its self-repair program procedures, and is adding the\nability for consumers to use parts pairing to fully activate used parts in\nrepairs \u2014 assuming they haven't been harvested from stolen devices.\n\nMike Wuerthele | 8 hours ago\n\n2\n\n## JP Morgan drops Apple target price over questions on when AI iPhone will\nlaunch\n\nInvestment firm JP Morgan predicts that Apple will introduce AI with the 2025\niPhone 17 Pro, and has dropped its current price target to $210 partly as a\nresult.\n\nWilliam Gallagher | 8 hours ago\n\n18\n\n## Future Apple Pencil may work on iPhone and never need charging\n\nApple is looking at technology to entirely remove the need to charge a future\nApple Pencil without removing features, and whether that will help it be used\non an iPhone.\n\nWilliam Gallagher | 9 hours ago\n\n0\n\n## Google Photos AI image-editing tools expands to iPhone on May 15\n\nGoogle is going to provide all users of Google Photos access to its AI-powered\nediting tools on the iPhone, and without requiring a subscription for most\nusers.\n\nMalcolm Owen | 9 hours ago\n\n1\n\n## Google Photos AI image-editing tools expands to iPhone on May 15\n\nGoogle is going to provide all users of Google Photos access to its AI-powered\nediting tools on the iPhone, and without requiring a subscription for most\nusers.\n\n## Apple wants to hire a PR heavyweight to battle the EU on its own soil\n\nApple has been having no luck arguing against the EU's Digital Markets Act,\nand it's paid the price in fines and forced changes to its App Store \u2014 so now\nit's looking for a European head of PR.\n\n## False Flag: Social media erupts over Apple's predictive text Palestine\nblunder\n\nApple's predictive text system has prompted claims of antisemitism against the\niPhone maker, by serving the Palestinian flag after users type in Jerusalem.\n\n## Latest Videos\n\n## How to get the best video capture possible on iPhone 15 Pro with ProRes\n\n## How to turn off Apple's Journal 'Discoverable by Others' setting that's\nenabled by default\n\n## The best Thunderbolt 4 docks and hubs you can buy for your Mac\n\n## Latest Reviews\n\n## Espresso 17 Pro review: Magnetic & modular portable Mac monitor\n\n## Journey Loc8 MagSafe Finder Wallet review: an all-in-one Find My wallet\n\n## TP-Link Tapo Indoor cameras review: affordable HomeKit options with in-app\nAI tools\n\nLoad More\n\n### Follow us on Social Media:\n\nGet our Mobile App\n\n### More AppleInsider\n\n  * Product Comparisons\n  * Advertise on AppleInsider\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ethics Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Push Notifications\n\n### Support Our Work\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\n\n### Designed by Crafted\n\n", "frontpage": true}
