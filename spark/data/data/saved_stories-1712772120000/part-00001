You are getting ready for an important\npresentation with important prospects in an hour. You feel ready, you have\nprepared for this, you decide to go through your slides one last time to make\nsure everything is smooth.\n\nYour computer decides to crash an hour before your meeting, and takes with it\nyour notes and presentation.\n\nAfter the immediate panick, you try to turn it back on, but you realize that\nyou won\u2019t be able to make it work before your presentation in 60 minutes.\n\nSo your brain starts scanning for solutions you encountered before. It\nimmediately flips through old files for something similar:\n\n  * You once had your phone die, and you were on a vacation. It was inconvienent, but you did'n\u2019t have a presentation in two hours.\n\n  * You remember once having deleted a folder from the cloud storage before. You ended up discovering that the cloud service had a \u201cdeleted items\u201d feature.\n\nYou wait for that \"aha\" moment, but end up stalling. These past scenarios are\nsimilar, but they don\u2019t apply here.\n\nYou don\u2019t have time to go to a store and back, you can\u2019t call IT to recover\nthe data.\n\nYou start to panick. You feel trapped. Stress levels are shooting up,\nbreathing shallows.\n\nIt's becoming so overwhelming that your brain starts to freeze.\n\nThis impacts your ability to think clearly, and feeds into the loop that you\ncreated for yourself.\n\nYou are making it harder and harder to find a solution. Like I have, 100\u2019s of\ntimes in my life.\n\nThings don\u2019t have to be that way.\n\nAu contraire my friend..\n\nNow, when I am faced with a new problem, I get excited.\n\nI have a process that I go through every time, it\u2019s clear and predictible.\nThis is what I want to share with you today.\n\nBy the end of this letter, you\u2019ll have a clear roadmap on how to get handle\nproblems, how to carry a systematic and unbeatable approach to tackling them\nwith excitement, and even how to turn them into lucrative opportunities.\n\nThis will first sound counter-intuitive, but To Solve a Problem, You Must\nFirst Forget.\n\nProblems are fun, they are like a maze.\n\nIt\u2019s not about working harder within the maze; it's about stepping above it to\nsee the layout.\n\nBut to unlock your potential to solve problems, you must first throw away the\nkeys of assumptions.\n\nThe key is to break down the problem into it\u2019s most basic form of\nunderstanding.\n\nYou must deconstruct it to it\u2019s most basic elements, challenge the assumptions\nand peel the onion. You must get down to the truth.\n\nThat\u2019s really the hardest part. Because once that\u2019s done, you can\n\n  * reconstruct it.\n\n  * Forget it.\n\n\\- And the answer will appear on it\u2019s own.\n\nIt\u2019s feels like magic, and that\u2019s the magic trick I\u2019d like to teach you today:\nWe\u2019ll use what\u2019s known as First principle thinking.\n\n\u201cIf first principle thinking is so effective, why isn't everyone using it? It\nsounds like just another buzzword that Elon Musk throws around?\u201d\n\nWhy is it that most of the people are not fit when they know that working out\nconsistently, eating healthy and under your daily caloric needs will\nautomatically result in them being in great shape?\n\nIt\u2019s not about the knowledge. It\u2019s about applying the knowledge - repeating it\nuntil it becomes second nature.\n\nThis is where knowledge differs from widsom.\n\nThis works with simple problems. This also works with much bigger, complex\nproblems. This works in every area of life.\n\nOnce you learn the framework, practice it on the simple things. Challenge\nyourself to breakdown everything, forgetting assumptions.\n\nQuestion everything. Not for the sake of rebellion, but for the sake of a\nbetter understanding.\n\nTreat is as a game, because:\n\n  * It\u2019s more fun this way.\n\n  * Everything is in fact a game that can be beat once you learn and apply the rules.\n\nIt does\u2019nt matter what problem you are trying to solve. This works on every\nkind of problem.\n\nIt can be digging out of debt, rebounding from a job loss, or recovering from\na personal betrayal. It can be discovering that your computer died less than\nan hour before a critical presentation with no way of retrieving your slides.\n\nOnce you get enough practice, you will become the person that can solve\nproblems.\n\nOnce you solve enough problems, people will notice and start seeing you as the\nproblem solver.\n\nOnce you get noticed by enough people, some will start paying you to solve\ntheir problems.\n\nAnd this, my friend, is the very nature of business itself: Solving problems,\nand getting paid for it.\n\nThe bigger the problems you can solve, the more you\u2019ll get paid.\n\nSo trust me when I say that I\u2019ve learned to love problems. The bigger the\nproblem, the more I get excited.\n\n## 1\\. Thinking Simple, Solving Big.\n\nThe good thing about being a human being is that billions of human beings came\nbefore us, and billions of them asked the same questions you and I have today.\n\nThere is no question that has never been asked, no thought that has never been\nthought.\n\nOver two thousand years ago, Aristotle defined a first principle as \u201cthe first\nbasis from which a thing is known.\u201d\n\nA first principle is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further.\n\nFirst principles thinking is a fancy way of saying \u201cthink like a scientist.\u201d\n\nScientists don't assume anything..\n\n..Especially not common knowledge, which comes in two forms.\n\n  * Common knowledge you get from asking others or finding information. Like stuff you read in books or hear from friends.\n\n  * Common knowledge your brain just uses on its own because it's the shortcut it takes to conserve energy \u2014 as we discussed this in the previous letter.\n\nThrough his study of Epistemology, Aristotle makes the point of warning\nproblem-solvers never to accept common knowledge unquestioningly.\n\nEpistemology is the theory of knowledge. It\u2019s the investigation of what\ndistinguishes justified belief from opinion. It helps you understand the\nnature of knowledge itself.\n\nWhen we apply this to problem solving, we end up with First Principle Problem\nSolving.\n\nThis is your key to problem solving.\n\n## 2\\. The Problem Solver\u2019s Guide.\n\nHere is the framework to follow:\n\nFirst, you need to be able to mentally visualize the problem in it\u2019s entirety.\nIf you can\u2019t do it in your head, take a peice of paper and pen.\n\nDraw circles, boxes, and words. It doesn\u2019t matter how it looks.\n\nThis key is to get it out of your head, and make you realize how this \u201cbig\u201d\nproblem fits on a piece of paper.\n\nNow, when you have it in front of you, you see the entirety of it.\n\nOk, now it\u2019s yours. You own it. Time to disect it.\n\nIn our instance, the problem is that you have less than 60 minutes to craft a\nnew presentation, and feel ready to present. You have no computer, you don\u2019t\nhave your notes. You have nothing but the knowledge acquired when preparing\nit.\n\nNow let\u2019s disect what the presentation is for.\n\nYou are presenting today because the clients are interested in purchasing\nconsulting services from you.\n\nWhat is a consultant and why do people want to hire a consultant?: Someone\nwith a new perspective, critical thinking, able to help see the path and get\nto places faster.\n\nLet\u2019s recap.\n\nYou have 60 minutes to come up with something that needs to impress your\nprospects. You need to make them feel confident to hire you. You want to show\nexpertise. You don\u2019t have a computer, or slides to work with.\n\nLet\u2019s continue breaking this down.\n\nWhat makes a presentation succesful? It\u2019s memorable.\n\nHow do you make it memorable? People remember how you made them feel, not the\nwords you used.\n\nLet\u2019s recap again. Here are the simple objectives of your mission. You need\nto:\n\n  * Have them trust you.\n\n  * Appear knowledgeable.\n\n  * Establish a connection and have them feel comfortable enough to do business with you.\n\n  * Have them vizualise the results they would get by working with you.\n\nLet\u2019s take these concepts to their most basic form, breaking them down to one\nword.\n\n  * Trust\n\n  * Knowledge\n\n  * Connection\n\n  * Results\n\nNow that you have the most basic assumptions, and the expected result you\nwant. It\u2019s time to.. take a break.\n\nYes, you heard me correctly. Don\u2019t dwell on the problem, don\u2019t start working\non the solution. You already did the work to lay out everything on a piece of\npaper.\n\nYou have layed out the most basic principles of what needs to be accomplished.\n\nYou know what you need to do. Figuring out how to do it will come to to you\nnaturally.\n\nSo, go do something else. Go on a quick walk, go grab a coffee, play a game on\nyour phone. Watch a 10 minute video. Anything that is not related to what you\nare trying to accomplish.\n\nYou have to let your brain take this new information, create new nerological\npaths on it\u2019s own.\n\n## 3\\. Say hi to the Default Mode Network Activation.\n\nTaking a break is an essential part of the process. Not letting this happen\nwill never unveal the magic, such as:\n\n  1. Shifting Focus: When you decide to take a break and do something unrelated, you shift your focus away from the problem. This allows the prefrontal cortex to relax.\n\n  2. Default Mode Network (DMN) Activation: With the DMN active, your brain continues to work on the problem in the background, without your conscious effort. This subconscious processing will lead to the formation of new neural connections. It will integratte of pieces of information that you provided it with.\n\n  3. Eureka Moment: The anterior cingulate cortex and the right hemisphere of the brain, will suddenly piece together a solution that wasn't apparent during the focused problem-solving phase.\n\n  4. Formation of New Neurological Pathways: This is when new synaptic connections are formed. These connections represent the \"new neurological pathways\" that embody the solution or creative ideas that come to you during or after the break.\n\nSo let your brain do it\u2019s job. Come back to it 10-30 minutes later.\n\nThe aswer will appear. It\u2019s like magic, but it\u2019s not.\n\nYou realize that the best way to impress them and inspire confidence, but also\nstand out, is by not having the same, boring presentation that they have seen\nfrom the other prospects.\n\nWithout a screen, you will be able to have a \u201cconversation\u201d. You will\nestablish a real human connection.\n\nYou already know your talking points. You have studied them countless times.\n\nAnother idea pops in your head. You remember to treat everything like a game.\n\nSo you have the brilliant idea to turn this presentation into a game.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a lot of time, so you write these words on a piece of paper for\neach talking point. Each inidividual word is a strong message you want to\nconvey and build rapport on.\n\n  * Trust\n\n  * Knowledge\n\n  * Connection\n\n  * Results\n\nOne piece of paper for each word.\n\nYou will go to the meeting, and place these in a bowl. When entering the room,\nyou will place the bowl in the center of the table. You then will introduce\nyourself, and ask them to pull out a piece of paper, read it outloud, and have\nthem tell you what this means to them.\n\nAfter their initial shock, they will start talking. Once they do, you will now\nhave a basis of their values, which you will agree with (hopefully), and tell\nyour story and why it\u2019s also important to you.\n\nIf it\u2019s Trust, give a powerful and true story of why it\u2019s important for you to\nhave trust with your clients, how you establish trust, what trust means for\nyou. Explain that trust is a non-necogiable for you to work with someone.\n\nGo through the remaining the pieces of paper, and you will end up with a\nunique, deep and informative conversation. The prospects will feel understood,\nheard, and comfortable. You will establish a genuine connection.\n\nYou now have an extra 30 minutes or so to relax. Use it to get into your flow\nstate. Prepare yourself mentally how ever you like to do it, or just relax\nsome more.\n\n## 4\\. When Problems Turn Into Wins.\n\nYou see, by doing this, we don\u2019t just fix the problem. We also seize the\nhidden opportunity that the problem is presenting us with.\n\nEvery problem you encounter, big or small, always has a gift associate with\nit.\n\nThis is giving you the chance to look at things differently. This is giving\nyou an opportunity to improve, find a better way, change the way you do\nthings.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t lose your slides, you would have probably gone through your\nusual pitch, likely repeating what your competitors say \u2014 a story your\nprospects have already heard three or four times.\n\nYou already worked on the presentation, so there should be no problem\nremembering the big lines, and selling points. The technical details will not\ndiffer from your competitors, everybody has the same information.\n\nBut while the information is the same, your delivery will be novel and\nmemorable\n\nWith this new approach, you will be able to talk about it without sticking to\nyour original notes.\n\nYou will be more present.\n\nYou will not have a screen for people to look at, directing their attention\nsolely to you talking.\n\nThey will be more engaged, and your words will be more impactful.\n\nYou will be able to establish a true connection.\n\nSure, your prospects might initially be confused by the absence of slides, and\nthey may find it odd to pull out a crumpled piece of paper from a bowl at the\nstart of the meeting.\n\nWhat I can assure you is that they will most certainly be impressed by how\nthis presentation stands out from 100% of the presentations that preceded it.\nIt will be unique and effective.\n\nThere's a good chance you'll make that sale. And if you don't, it's likely\nbecause your values didn't align. This is better to know before starting a\nbusiness relationship.\n\nEmbracing problems is opening the door to hidden opportunities.\n\nUsing the first principle thinking framework will remove all assumptions,\nguiding you to the core principles required to see the bigger picture and come\nup with a new, innovative, unseen before solution.\n\nEvery problem presents an opportunity. Embrace them. Welcome them. Seek them.\n\n## 5\\. Thinking Ahead: Your Next Steps.\n\nStart applying first principle thinking to your daily challenges. Look at each\nproblem not as a blockage but as a puzzle. A question waiting for a deeper\nanswer.\n\nBreak down the complex into the simple. Question the obvious. Rebuild with\nclarity.\n\nLet this be your practice, your new habit. Because habits shape who we are and\nwho we become.\n\nEffective problem-solving is not about individual instances of insight, but\nabout cultivating a consistent approach and methodology toward tackling\nchallenges.\n\nSo, challenge yourself. Today, tomorrow, every day. Embrace the problems you\nencounter as opportunities in disguise.\n\nYou must do this on an ongoing basis.\n\nPractice until it excites you. Seek out problems. Enjoy the challenge.\n\nYou'll become the go-to problem solver. Recognized. Respected.\n\nPeople will start to notice. They'll call you. They\u2019ll pay you for your skill\nin solving complex problems.\n\nRemember. This is business at its core: Solve problems - Get paid.\n\nThe bigger the problem, the bigger the paycheck. Embrace this. Excel at it.\nAnd watch as your value skyrockets\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nBen.\n\n## Footer\n\n#### The Simulation Strategists\n\nEngineer Your Existence.
