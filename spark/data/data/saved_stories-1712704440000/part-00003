The\ncompany currently developing it is Expressive. But previously it was\nmaintained by Zindex Software. The Apache 2 licensed web app had transitioned\nto closed source after raising 300K in pre-seed funding round to follow a\n\u201cmore sustainable business model\u201d they say. Their tech stack is Svelte for the\nUI, and a custom made canvas-engine by Zindex Software for the rendering and\nanimations of the motion graphics part. This engine was open source too,\nlicensed under Apache 2, but was close sourced later. Leaving only a shadowy\nnpm.io page when searching about it. Expressive Animator has no trace left\nexcept on a fork that was made before the close source move. This is the start\nmark that flamed this journey.\n\n## #Chapter 1: The discovery\n\nIn the middle of a day in Ramadan, hungry and thirsty because of fasting. I\ndon\u2019t know how I got this idea. I wondered if a vector editing software built\nwith web tech was made, typical ideas of a front-dev. I opened my sourceror\ncookbook, GitHub, and started searching. I found this repository under this\naccount with the username gqshell. The description of the repo has a link,\nthat I clicked it. It opened and it redirected me to the current product page\nof Expressive Animator here. Examining the features section and the absolutely\namazing UI screenshots I was stunned. Wanting to know more about the product I\njumped to their blog, which is mainly a release changelog of their 2 products.\nIn the middle of these posts was one post talking about the 300K pre-seed\nfunding round. In the middle of reading it I got shocked. \u201cThis can\u2019t be,\nclose sourced, HOW?\u201d I said. I just was looking at the source code. Later I\ndiscovered that repo is just a fork of the original one. What was left from it\nonly a capture by archive.org in here.\n\n## #Chapter 2: The Challenge\n\nI was angry, fuelled, and felt cheated, this is not fair. I said I have to do\nsomething about this. I started skimming through the gqshell repo\u2019s commits\nand code. The most up to date code in this fork is v0.1.0 while the current\nversion of Expressive Animator is 3 releases after v0.3.0 they say on their\nblog. I assume they\u2019re at v0.6.0 now (As of April 2024), given the pattern\nshown between each release. So this was nothing, I can\u2019t do anything with\nthis. Luckily this fork has 10 other forks, I examined them. They all were\nexactly the same, except this one. Initially it seemed like the others, but it\nhad one additional branch the other 9 forks hadn\u2019t. The v0.5.0 branch. I don\u2019t\nknow how it got their, but this means we made a substantial progress in our\nlittle quest. Given my assumption about the v0.6.0 current Expressive Animator\nwe are only one release behind the closed source version. All great, but\nunfortunately the joy didn\u2019t last long.\n\n## #Chapter 3: The Engineless Machine\n\nThe code we have now is only the UI part. All the internal important parts\nrelated to vector graphics, editing, and animation is developed separately in\nthe package@zindex/canvas-engine. It was open source under an Apache 2 license\ntoo, but got closed source later. There was no forks or archived copies this\ntime. I got in touch with one of the core developers asking for the version of\nthe package before it got close sourced. He responded negatively and how the\npackage now is the intellectual property of the company. This was the end. I\ngave up.\n\n2 days later I started looking at gqshell\u2019s repo again. I noticed at the root\nthere was a ./dist folder. I saw hope, I knew it, you know it where this thing\nis going. Projects as far as I know add their build folders to .gitignore to\nnot be tracked with Git. But luckily this project didn\u2019t. The folder contained\nas I assume the CSS and JavaScript bundles, minified and the sourcemap.\nNothing interesting this was. But the gold mine and hope of this challenge was\nin previous commits. Following the commit history of this folder and its\ncontents. At one time 2 files named canvas-engine.js and canvas-engine.min.js\nappeared. Thanks to the copy-engine command from package.json. This was the\nbundle of the package we were looking for. And here dears is the actual end of\nthis challenge. The only thing that was left is link this script with the\nindex.html at the root. I run it and fixed any errors and incompatibilities\nbetween the ahead of time UI and the outdated canvas-engine.js bundle.\n\n## #Closure\n\nI clicked refresh and the app was running, finally.\n\nIf you finished reading this, please drop us a comment if you have anything to\nsay about the topic.\n\n### #Disclaimer\n\nThis blog post mentions \u201cExpressive Animator,\u201d owned by Expressive, formerly\ndeveloped by Zindex Software.
