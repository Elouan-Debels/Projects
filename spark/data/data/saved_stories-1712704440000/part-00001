However, hurdles such\nas depositing the perovskite solutions on continuously sliding substrates, as\nwell as time and temperature constraints, limited the industrial\nimplementations. \u2018Our team demonstrated the roll-to-roll production of series-\nconnected [solar] modules for the first time and achieved a significant\nincrease in the record efficiency of solution-processed solar cells,\u2019 he adds.\nProducing a roll-to-roll perovskite solar module using this technology took\ntwo researchers two days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe roll-to-roll systems are widespread in manufacturing and printing, and Vak\nsays that it\u2019s a \u2018proven method for mass-producing low-cost [printed]\nproducts\u2019. It works like \u2018a larger version of a cassette tape with multiple\nprinting heads in the middle\u2019.\n\nSource: \u00a9 Hasitha C Weerasinghe et al\n\nIllustration of roll-to-roll production of modules featuring coating, reverse\ngravure coating and screen printing\n\n\u2018Roll-to-roll printing involves the continuous deposition of materials on a\nflexible substrate as it moves through a series of rollers,\u2019 explains Annalisa\nBruno, an expert in perovskite solar cells at the Energy Research Institute at\nNanyang Technological University, Singapore. \u2018In this case, the perovskite\nlayers and other components are printed onto the substrate sequentially,\u2019 she\nexplains. At this stage, the main challenge is to ensure that each layer dries\nand settles completely before the next layer is deposited. The development of\ndifferent inks facilitated the process, according to Bruno. Researchers\ndeveloped \u2018appropriate ink compositions [to] optimise the morphology [and]\nimprove the drying process of each layer\u2019. They printed all the interlayers,\nincluding the components for electron and hole transport and both the carbon\nand silver electrodes, she explains. Overall, this \u2018streamlined scalability,\nto [reach] low costs and high throughput production\u2019.\n\nSource: \u00a9 Hasitha C Weerasinghe et al\n\nStructure of the printed perovskite cell\n\nJovana Mili\u0107, a perovskite expert at the Adolphe Merkle Institute in Fribourg,\nSwitzerland, agrees: \u2018The success of this approach could be attributed to the\nperovskite-friendly carbon inks and an automated roll-to-roll tester.\u2019\nCommonly, the production of perovskite solar cells involved solution\nprocessing at laboratory scale, \u2018with techniques such as spin-coating ...\nfundamentally incompatible with large-scale device fabrication\u2019, explains\nMili\u0107. Although \u2018it\u2019s a misconception that ... perovskites require inert\nconditions for their preparation\u2019, it\u2019s a \u2018breakthrough to demonstrate the\nfull roll-to-roll fabrication of solar cell modules with superior performances\nunder ambient conditions\u2019, she adds.\n\n\u2018The roll-to-roll printed perovskite cells exhibit efficiencies of up to 15.5%\nfor small-area [devices] and 11% for large-area modules,\u2019 says Bruno. Both\nfigures improve the previous efficiency record for roll-to-roll perovskites of\n10.8%. With these parameters, the predicted cost could come in at 70 cents\n(55p) per watt. \u2018While [still] more expensive than silicon, the roll-to-roll\nbreakthrough signifies a significant step toward cost reduction,\u2019 she adds.\nMoreover, easier production processes could cut carbon dioxide emissions,\nespecially as the roll-to-roll printing works at room temperature.\n\nAnother drawback of perovskite solar cells is the potential leakage of toxic\nlead salts into the environment. Vak argues that when they seal the structure\nto protect the perovskite from moisture and oxygen this would also \u2018prevent\nlead leakage\u2019. \u2018If oxygen cannot come in, lead cannot escape,\u2019 he says.\nNevertheless, the team is aware of current concern around the deployment of\nperovskite cells, especially in cases of complications with the devices and\ndisposal of degraded panels. \u2018Our commitment is to find effective ways to\nensure the safe use of this technology and we are focused on implementing\nrobust sealing mechanisms and comprehensive [sustainability] assessments to\nmitigate any potential risks,\u2019 concludes Vak.\n\n### References\n\nHC Weerasinghe et al, Nat.
