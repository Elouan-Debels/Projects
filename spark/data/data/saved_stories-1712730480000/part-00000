It was\nswitching apps, trying to enter passcode, and then finally, after two minutes\nof trying to stop it, sounded the siren and called 911. I had to explain to\nthe operator that my watch was going crazy and had called spontaneously. She\nseemed unfazed by this, so i'm assuming this is a common occurrence (also\njudging by other comments and questions in the forum). I was able to hard\nreboot my watch, which seems to have fixed the issue (but we'll see). My\nquestion is, does anyone know why this is happening? This has to be an issue\nknown to Apple (as it's been reported on other models as well and for several\nyears (oldest commentary I see is from 2020). Is this a bug? A virus? (If so,\nis there a way to remove it?) If anyone has any information it would be\nhelpful. This happened to me in the midst of a meeting with many people\naround. Is it just a function of having to restart/reboot the watch\nperiodically?\n\n[Re-Titled by Moderator]\n\nApple Watch Series 9\n\nPosted on Jan 31, 2024 4:57 AM\n\nUpvote if this is a clear question\n\nDownvote if this question isn\u2019t clear\n\nReply\n\nQuestion marked as Best reply\n\nUser profile for user: catherinefromcornwall bridge\n\ncatherinefromcornwall bridge\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n9 points\n\nPosted on Feb 3, 2024 6:20 PM\n\nMine just started doing this!

Press the crown and side button (below the crown) at the\nsame time and hold for at least 10 seconds. When you release, you should see\nthe apple symbol and the watch will restart. It will not erase or reset\nanything, It will just perform a hard reboot.\n\nUpvote if this is a helpful reply\n\nDownvote if this reply isn\u2019t helpful\n\nReply\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: jillkolpin\n\njillkolpin\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n11 points\n\nFeb 2, 2024 7:27 AM in response to rest-easy\n\nThis happened to me also last night \u2014 Feb 1.

My Apple Watch Ultra II suddenly went nuts. It\nstarted with many message on my iPhone for keyboard input, like when you type\nyour password on Apple TV. Then it was like somebody took over my Watch\nscreen. I saw constant random input of text. After a while the watch got time\nlocked, because of the wrong unlock code. Now I have to wait for 3 hours!\nbefore next attempt to unlock. I put the Watch on the charger for now and hope\nthe error is over by next morning.\n\nUpvote if this is a helpful reply\n\nDownvote if this reply isn\u2019t helpful\n\nReply\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Willybo\n\nWillybo\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n11 points\n\nJan 31, 2024 9:56 AM in response to mjanelle4\n\nMY Apple watch 9 same problem early this morning, the calling 911 alarm (SOS\nalarm?) woke me up, fortunately pressing crown enough times stopped it. Then\nthere was a flash of apps popping up it seemed to stick on the music app\napparently playing Kinks songs from the iPhone. Trying to stop that it called\n911 again, which I was able to stop. I took the watch off and that seemed to\nstop the apps from popping up. Did the reset, put the watch back on, and half\nway down the hallway the 911 alarm started again. Took off the watch and went\nto apple support chat. My firmware was 10.2 with 10.3 waiting in the wings.\nUpdated the firmware and the problem seems to have stopped. So watch seems to\nworking now.\n\nBottom line, yes this is a problem.\n\nUpvote if this is a helpful reply\n\nDownvote if this reply isn\u2019t helpful\n\nReply\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: rest-easy\n\nrest-easy\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n10 points\n\nFeb 1, 2024 9:48 AM in response to Carol B.\n\nThe exact same thing happen to my series 9.

Like stated above\nyou wound see it go to enter your password and the screen with emergency\ncontact and shut down. It would also zoom in then back out.

The really crazy thing, same\nexact thing started happening to my iPhone 13 Pro! Phone much easier to reboot\nthan the watch. I really hope Apple gets this fixed!

I put the watch on the\ncharger and while it was there I checked and my phone had an update available\nso I did that one. Watch charged up and acted normally. I checked for watch\nupdate and watchOS 10.1.1 said preparing. It has now been at least 12 hours\nand the update still says preparing. Just to double check I verified charge\ngreater than 50% and put watch back on charger to see if the update would\nproceed. It did not.\n\nUpvote if this is a helpful reply\n\nDownvote if this reply isn\u2019t helpful\n\nReply\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: LMR05\n\nLMR05\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n12 points\n\nFeb 5, 2024 4:27 PM in response to HereAgain91\n\nI strongly recommend contacting Apple, I did a chat today to let them know,\nsame exact experience.

First it triggered \u2018find my\u2019 on my\nphone, and it gave the alert sound. That\u2019s what when I noticed the screen on\nmy watch was going crazy, almost like someone had control over apps. It was\nopening and closing random apps. It ended up calling 911, the siren sound went\noff I\u2019m guessing for fall detection. Unfortunately couldn\u2019t stop the call, but\nluckily 911 operators were nice about it.\n\nPut the watch on the charger as it wouldn\u2019t allow a restart. Eventually after\nit sat I was able to restart it and get the new update. I\u2019m hoping that works\nbecause I\u2019m terrified to wear this watch now. This is obviously an issue since\nit\u2019s not just me it\u2019s happened to, hoping Apple addresses it.\n\nUpvote if this is a helpful reply\n\nDownvote if this reply isn\u2019t helpful\n\nReply\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: EvansDS3\n\nEvansDS3\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n9 points\n\nFeb 7, 2024 5:57 AM in response to mjanelle4\n\nThis happened to my S9 (ios 10.2) watch yesterday (2/6/2024). It was as if\nsomeone was physically pressing the buttons as well as the touch screen. It\nturned on airplane mode, set timers, opened menus, and even changed settings.\nWhen I tried to power it off, it tried to call 911. I finally took it off my\nwrist which caused it to enter an incorrect passcode enough to lock itself for\na min. While on the \"locked for 1 minute\" screen I was able to force a hard\nrestart on it. Upon turning it back on, I had to wait the 1 minute to enter my\npasscode - but then everything was fine. I had to change back everything that\nwas changed before (turn off water lock, turn off airplane mode, etc). But\njust now, it opened up a menu that I did not press a button for... but stopped\nafter that. I know I have an update waiting (ios 10.3), but sounds like folks\non 10.3 are having this issue too....\n\nUpvote if this is a helpful reply\n\nDownvote if this reply isn\u2019t helpful\n\nReply\n\nLink\n\nMy Apple Watch 9 is acting weird - Is this a bug?\n\nWelcome to Apple Support Community\n\nA forum where Apple customers help each other with their products.
