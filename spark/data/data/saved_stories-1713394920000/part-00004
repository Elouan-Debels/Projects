Trees that capture thousands of tons\nof CO_2 every day, saving endangered animals, restoring ecosystems, and\nuplifting communities around the world.\n\nThe formative years of Ecosia saw us becoming Germany\u2019s first certified B Corp\nin 2014, visiting our first tree planting project in Burkina Faso in 2016 and\ncelebrating the first 10 million trees being planted in April of 2017.\n\nThe big turning point came in 2018 when I signed a legally binding commitment\nto ensure that Ecosia could never be sold and that 100% of our profits would\nalways go to the planet. Today, your searches enable us to work with partners\nto plant and protect 1,250 species of trees across 95,000 locations globally.\n\nWe\u2019re also doing work beyond planting trees. Since 2020, our solar plants\nproduce enough renewable energy to power all Ecosia searches twice over. We\u2019ve\nalso set up an incubator for regenerative agriculture, invested into climate\ntech solutions, and recognizing the need for holistic change, diversified our\nsearch providers last year to provide you with an improved search experience.\n\nWith every search and every share, you have allowed us to do so much good for\nthe planet, and we have no plans to stop here. If everyone reading this shared\nEcosia with a friend, we could reach 300 million in no time.\n\nSo thank you, Ecosia community.
