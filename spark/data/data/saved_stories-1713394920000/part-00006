We\nexist to help SaaS executives level up.Make sure to register for the upcoming\n(free) webinar on Financial Literacy for SaaS leaders, hosted by Jeff and me\non April 11 at 11:00 am EDT.Let's dig in...\n\n## \u2193  \n  \n---  \n  \nWe tend to use the word \"value\" liberally in SaaS sales and customer\nsuccess.But what does it actually mean when we say it?More importantly, what\ndoes it mean to our prospects and customers?The consequences of a poor value\nproposition are low growth, low renewal rates, and low expansion.Given the\nimpact of growth and net retention on the market value of SaaS companies, it's\nclear that we need a scientific understanding of how to drive and deliver\nvalue to customers.I wanted to learn more about the psychology of value. So I\nset out to find academic research on the topic.A brief Google search led me to\nthe work of Valarie Zeithaml, a professor at the University of North\nCarolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School.In 1988, Zeithaml published a paper\ncalled Consumer Perceptions of Price, Quality, and Value: A Means-End Model\nand Synthesis of Evidence.Zeithaml's research centers around a model that\nbrings together several concepts. Product features (or \"attributes\"), quality,\nprice, and of course, value.There\u2019s a lot going on in the model below, but I\nwant to draw your attention to three core elements of the study:\n\n  1. Perceived Quality\n  2. Perceived Sacrifice\n  3. Perceived Value\n\n| Zeithaml's model identifies the relationships between product features,\nprice, quality and value.  \n---  \n  \nThe research reveals a complex relationship between a product's features,\ncosts, value proposition, and the consumer's decision to purchase it.\n\nThe perceived value of the product is, as one would expect, a major variable\nin the decision. But it turns out that value is highly subjective. Furthermore\nit's based on consumers' perceptions of both the quality (benefits) and costs\nwhich are also subjective in nature.\n\nIn a scenario as simple as deciding between available fruit juice options, the\nproduct category at the center of Zeithaml's research, it's clear that people\ndon't buy products for their features but for the abstract benefits they\nprovide.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * You buy fruit juice for nourishment and refreshment\n  * You buy clothing for protection from the elements and the way it makes you feel to dress up\n  * You buy accounting software to help you close the books faster each month and to make your staff more productive.\n\nThis is neither new nor surprising.\n\nBut no matter what type of product you sell, it's critical to understand how\nbuyers form their perceptions of quality, price, and value.\n\n### Perceived Quality: What you get\n\nZeithaml's definition of quality goes well beyond our typical definition of\nsoftware quality, e.g., low defect rates, speed, reliability, and usability.\n\nIn the context of the 1988 study,\n\nQuality can be defined as superiority or excellence. By extension, perceived\nquality can be defined as the consumer's judgement about a product's overall\nexcellence or superiority.\n\nThis definition is loosely based on a study conducted 50 years prior which\ndefined the quality of a product as its \"instrumentality.\" The extent to which\nit achieves an outcome.\n\n(That guy must've been the world's first customer success executive \ud83d\ude00).\n\nIn addition to taste, consistency, thickness, and purity - \"intrinsic\nattributes\" of fruit juices - the product packaging also influenced consumers'\nperception of its quality and benefits.\n\nConcentrated, frozen juice offers a radically different experience than a\njuice box when it comes to convenience. Juice boxes are easy to grab on the go\nand even young children can self-serve.\n\nOn the other hand, juice from frozen concentrate must be prepared, and little\nJohnny is likely to make a massive mess pouring himself a glass from the\npitcher.\n\nFor consumers on a tight budget, frozen juice may be of higher perceived\nquality despite the preparation and serving headaches. Meanwhile, a working\nmother of three values the convenience of juice boxes.\n\nThe way the product is packaged - an extrinsic attribute - becomes a part of\nits utility to the consumer.\n\nConsider Ted Levitt's research on the concept of the \"whole product:\"\n\n...consumers purchase more than the core product itself. Rather, they purchase\nthe core product combined with complimentary attributes, the majority of which\nare intangible.\n\nB2B software buyers also evaluate the \u201cwhole product.\u201d SaaS customers don't\njudge product utility based on features and functions alone. The external\nattributes must also meet their needs:\n\n  * is there an ecosystem of resources and expertise to tap into?\n  * are there people at the company to help with issues?\n  * how well the product fits the use case and need?\n  * was it purpose built for my industry?\n  * does it eliminate pain points?\n\nOver the years I've pushed my sales and customer success teams to think more\nbroadly about the positioning of our offerings than features alone.\n\nTurns out that pushback was well-advised.\n\nCustomers weigh the nonfunctional (extrinsic) attributes of your product just\nas much the intrinsic features. In essence they are evaluating how well your\ncompany delivers against their needs.\n\n### Perceived Price: What you give up\n\nThe selling price - or objective price - of a product is only part of the\ntotal cost equation for consumers.\n\nZeithaml describes \"perceived sacrifice\" as the aggregate of monetary and non-\nmonetary price.\n\nPerceived Monetary Price + Perceived Nonmonetary Price = Perceived Sacrifice  \n---  \n  \nAs consumers form perceptions of price, they combine objective, monetary cost\nwith the non-monetary investments of time, effort, energy, and focus to form a\ntotal \"perceived sacrifice.\"\n\nLike we saw above, juice consumers' non-monetary costs include preparation\ntime, storage, and inability for toddlers to self-serve.\n\nIn the software world, we refer to this combination of costs as total cost of\nownership (TCO).\n\nTCO is the sum of monetary and non-monetary costs. It includes staffing,\nongoing administration, integration, optimization, user training, and\nopportunity costs of other projects the customer must forego [2].\n\nIn B2B customers perceive total sacrifice relative to the industry, size,\nstage, and maturity of their companies.\n\n### Perceived Value: Is it worth it?\n\nFrom 2013-2017 I worked for an HR talent management software company. Payroll\nand HRIS integrations were mandatory for nearly all of our customers.\n\nOur platform was modern and API-driven, but most of these 3rd party targets\nwere old and required bespoke integrations which were prone to breakage.\n\nOver time we noticed that customers were leaving for less sophisticated \"all-\nin-one\" offerings from the same clunky payroll providers.\n\nWe were appalled!\n\nZeithaml's work illuminates what was happening.\n\nThe perceived sacrifice of integration support headaches and risk of employee\npayroll inaccuracies outweighed the perceived benefits of our modern platform.\n\nThe perceived sacrifice was too high.\n\nThe most frustrating part of the whole value equation is that it's so damned\nsubjective.\n\nZeithaml acknowledges this more tactfully:\n\nWhat constitutes value - even in a single product category - appears to be\nhighly personal and idiosyncratic.\n\nEvery customer makes a judgement call on whether a product, with it's benefits\nand costs, is worth implementing or renewing.\n\nWhile we can't control prospect and customer value perceptions we can\ncertainly influence them.\n\nWe can do this by ensuring product development, marketing, sales, customer\nsuccess, services, and support teams work together to define a set of\nofferings that minimize customer perceived non-monetary costs, maximize direct\nbenefits, and keep delivery costs (Cost of Goods Sold) low enough to make the\nproduct's sticker price as low as possible while maintaining industry-standard\nGross Margins.\n\n(If that financial jargon sounded like Greek to you, grab a copy of our\nFinancial Literacy Course here).\n\nA general rule of thumb is to aim for a 10x perceived value-to-perceived\nsacrifice ratio. [3]\n\n### So what, now what?\n\nWhat do we do with all of this?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s a call to action. To double down on company-wide customer\ncentricity in a few different ways:\n\n1) Know your customer more intimately than your competitors.\n\nUnderstand your customers deeply. Both their stated and unstated needs as well\nas those that exist around your product.\n\nIncorporate customer and market feedback into your product roadmap planning\nprocess, AND into how you deliver education, services, and support. Treat all\ncustomer touch points as if they are part of your whole product (because they\nare).\n\n2) Build post-sale commercial acumen in customer success and account\nmanagement.\n\nIf you buy into Zeithaml's research, it makes absolutely zero sense to have\nany team focusing on customer value without familiarity of commercial terms of\nthe relationship.\n\nIt's impossible to truly understand value without understanding all of the\nassociated costs and their implications (such as commercial terms like fees,\nentitlements, payment terms, contract length, and even core legal terms that\napply to customer contracts).\n\nEnsure these teams communicate and convey value at every turn. Every message\nand touchpoint should reinforce why your service is worth it.\n\n3) Empower internal champions\n\nIn B2B, everything I just discussed is happening simultaneously across a\nnumber of economic, technical, and user stakeholders.\n\nHopefully, at least one of those stakeholders is your internal champion. Gird\nthem for battle. Treat them like an extension of your team. If their perceived\nsacrifice, including risk to their own career, is higher than the perceived\nbenefits of your solution, you're dead in the water for that sale or renewal.\n\n4) Sell value not features.\n\nTrain and enable sales and customer success to drive and communicate value\nversus features. Provide great support and service options so that commercial\nteams can be hyper-focused on value.\n\n***\n\nQuality, price, and value are the pillars upon which successful SaaS\nbusinesses are built.\n\nAs leaders, our job is to create a clear vision and build offerings that not\nonly meet the needs of the market, but move it forward.\n\nIn the end, this is what SaaS leadership is all about.\n\n\ud83e\udd18\n\n[1] I love reading academic research papers and patent filings. You can learn\nso much from these documents, but because they are written by researchers for\nresearchers, most are good bedtime reading for insomniacs. But I love that\nthey put models and words around concepts I've experienced in my work over the\nyears. I read this paper so you don't have to.\n\n[2] Post-ZIRP (zero interest rate period), companies no longer have extra\nbandwidth to take on an unlimited number of projects. They must be deliberate\nand thoughtful about choosing the initiatives that will drive the most\nprofitable, efficient growth.\n\n[3] Not backed by any research that I know of, but something I\u2019ve always held\nin my mind.\n\n| | \n\n### Whenever you're ready, there are 3 ways we can help you:\n\n  1.
