This system tracks the location\nof workers in real time using ultra-wideband (UWB) technology and indicates if\nthey are in a predefined danger zone or not, where the predefined safe zone is\ndelimited by safety cones. Unlike previous works that focus on road-worker\nsafety by detecting vehicles that enter into the working zone, our proposal\nsolves the problem of distracted workers leaving the safe zone. This paper\npresents a simple-to-deploy safety system. Our UWB anchors do not need any\ncables for powering, synchronisation, or data transfer. The anchors are placed\ninside safety cones, which are already available in construction sites.\nFinally, there is no need to manually measure the positions of anchors and\nintroduce them to the system thanks to a novel self-positioning approach. Our\nproposal, apart from automatically estimating the anchors\u2019 positions, also\ndefines the limits of safe and danger zones. These features notably reduce the\ndeployment time of the proposed safety system. Moreover, measurements show\nthat all the proposed simplifications are obtained with an accuracy of 97%.\n\nKeywords:\n\naccident prevention; construction sites; real-time tracking; RTLS; safety; UWB\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nOccupational accidents are of major concern for workers, their families, and\ncompanies. However, according to Eurostat, over 2.8 million non-fatal\naccidents and 3347 fatal accidents were reported in 2021 in the European Union\nof 27 states (EU-27) [1]. Among all activities, the construction sector had\nthe highest incidence rate of non-fatal accidents: 3151.9 accidents per\n100,000 persons employed [2]. Thus, the construction sector has an urgent need\nto improve its safety proceedings.\n\nAmong all types of construction sites that exist, road construction is a\nparticular case in which workers are exposed to serious risk of death due to\nheavy vehicles driving fast nearby. In order to guarantee a safe working\nenvironment, so far, the safety awareness of workers and drivers has been\nincreased by means of personal protective equipment (PPE), informative\nsessions, training, and traffic control devices [3]. However, human behaviour\nis difficult to control [4] and the safety procedures are not always correctly\nfollowed. This risk can be avoided with the help of behaviour-based safety\n(BBS), which is designed to intervene and modify unsafe human behaviour. BBS\nis an approach of systematic application of psychological research into human\nbehaviour. The works of [5,6] showed that, for the successful application of\nBBS in construction sites, constant surveillance of workers is needed.\nNormally, this surveillance is performed by other humans, so the collection of\ndata is highly inefficient and can also be inaccurate due to the subjective\njudgments needed [7]. Thus, BBS cannot be the only approach in construction\nsites to improve the safety of workers.\n\nAs an alternative, the application of newly emerging technologies in\npersonalised safety monitoring could be used, a solution that has not been\ncompletely explored [8]. There are some works that have studied the\nfeasibility of warning workers if a distracted driver enters the working zone\n[9,10]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no previous work has proposed any\nsolution for distracted workers leaving a safe zone in a road construction\nenvironment. A good example in the case of road and railway maintenance could\nbe the use of a real-time locating system (RTLS) that detects if workers\nremain in the safe working environment. However, these types of solutions may\nhave some drawbacks because of the difficulty of deploying an RTLS [11] and\nthe dynamic nature of construction environments [12]. Most safety systems\nbased on RTLS [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29] need to\ndeploy some fixed sensors with known positions around the working environment\nand define safe and dangerous zones. Some time has to be spent fixing sensors\nwhere needed, measuring their positions and introducing the limits of the safe\nand danger zones to the system. All these tasks add preparation time to the\nworking project. Moreover, as construction environments are highly dynamic,\nadjustments must be made during the lifetime of projects and the time spent\npreparing an RTLS is multiplied by the number of changes made. Another\ndrawback of adding an RTLS to construction sites is that they suppose extra\nelements that can add difficulty to the tasks to be performed. If, for\nexample, cables are added to power sensors, workers may trip and fall. Any\nsafety system for construction sites should be fast and simple to use and\ninterfere as little as possible with the work.\n\nApart from the general requirements of construction environments, the use case\nof an RTLS in road and railway maintenance also demands high accuracy. If a\nworker unintentionally leaves the delimited safe zone but the RTLS considers\nthem to be in the safe zone, the worker will not receive any alarm. Thus, the\nworker will be at serious risk of suffering an accident. The other way around\ncan also have negative consequences, since a worker receiving unnecessary\nalarms will consider the safety system unreliable and will stop paying\nattention to it.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel safety system for construction sites especially\nuseful in road and railway maintenance. Our safety system is an RTLS that uses\nultra-wideband (UWB) technology for the safety assessment of workers. Unlike\nprevious works [9,10], our proposal solves the problem of accidents caused by\ndistracted workers that leave the safe zone instead of focusing on distracted\ndrivers that enter this safe zone. Thanks to the high accuracy of UWB\ntechnology, it can reliably tell if a worker is inside or outside a predefined\nsafe zone. If the worker is not in the safe zone, a warning or an alarm is\ngiven, depending on the seriousness of the situation. Because of the special\ncharacteristics of construction environments, the fixed UWB sensors are placed\ninside safety cones and the moving sensors in the workers\u2019 hard hats. As a\nresult, safety cones act as fixed sensors of the RTLS and safety limits at the\nsame time, which simplifies the deployment of the system. Our proposed safety\nsystem also avoids adding congestion to construction sites, as safety cones\nare common in them. Moreover, because of the low power demand of UWB sensors\nin safety cones, they can be powered by photovoltaic cells, avoiding extra\ncongestion by cables. Additionally, for further simplification of the\ndeployment of the safety system, a self-positioning approach of UWB fixed\nsensors is proposed. This self-positioning approach, apart from estimating the\npositions of the anchors\u2019 coordinates, also automatically sets the limits of\nthe safe, warning, and danger zones without needing an extra communication\nlink among anchors.\n\nThe sections of the article are organised as follows. Section 2 reviews all\nthe work involving RTLS for safety applications in construction environments.\nSection 3 describes the proposed system in depth. Section 4 describes the\nperformed experiments for the evaluation of the safety system. Finally,\nSection 5 discusses the obtained results and Section 6 gives the final\nconclusions of the work.\n\n## 2\\. State of the Art\n\nGlobal navigation satellite system (GNSS) is one of the most well-known\npositioning systems. Nevertheless, this technology has significant limitations\nin indoor and urban environments [30], where many construction sites are\nlocated. Thus, since 2012, research on RTLS technologies has gained relevance\nfor safety management in construction environments [31]. The most common\ntechnologies for this purpose are computer vision, radio frequency\nidentification (RFID), bluetooth low energy (BLE), and UWB.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in research works using computer\nvision in construction environments due to their abundance of visual data and\nthe recent advancements in this area [32]. In the works of [33,34,35],\nequipment and workers were successfully tracked using computer vision.\nHowever, all these works had a common problem to deal with: occlusions. When\nan entity is tracked with cameras, it may temporarily hide behind an object\nand be lost, which leads to failure. In order to mitigate this drawback, the\nresearch works of [33,34,35] suggest carefully choosing the positions of\ncameras, so that their field of view covers as much as possible of the working\nplace. Nevertheless, selecting adequate positions for the cameras demands some\nplanning time and extra infrastructure to place them where desired. Moreover,\nthe construction environment is highly dynamic, so the chosen camera positions\nmight not be adequate during all the phases of the project.\n\nRefs. [36,37] proposed using a combination of tracking and detection\nalgorithms to deal with occlusions. When the track of a worker is lost, it can\nbe detected again. However, there is still high uncertainty during the time of\nan occlusion in systems based on computer vision, as the position of the\ntracked object is completely unknown.\n\nRadio frequency-based RTLSs are less affected by occlusions and the\nidentification of each sensor is an easy task [16]. The latter feature is\ncrucial if an individual alarm must be sent to the person who is detected to\nbe in danger.\n\nAn example of radio frequency-based technologies is RFID. This technology has\nbeen intensively researched for construction environments in the last decade\ndue to its cheap and flexible approach to identify individual people and\ndevices [38]. RFID consists of tags and readers. Tags emit a signal which is\nlater read by the readers to calculate the distances between sensors [39]. The\nmain setback of RFID technology is its accuracy. The works of [40,41] proposed\nusing RFID in construction environments, but only to send proximity alerts\nbetween workers and equipment [40] or to calculate the rough position of\nworkers [41]. However, if the actual positions of workers need to be\ndetermined with centimetre-level accuracy, RFID is not the most suitable\ntechnology [13,42]. In the case of [42], some danger zones were defined in a\nconstruction environment with a false alarm rate of 87% if a worker stood 1 m\naway from one of these zones. With such a high probability of receiving false\nalarms, workers might end up not paying attention to the safety system and\nignoring alarms.\n\nBLE is another radio frequency-based technology that has recently gained\nrelevance as a safety system [14,15,16,18,43,44]. BLE shows advantages such as\nits low cost and power consumption. It also has a high availability, as most\nsmartphones use this technology. Examples of BLE in construction sites can be\nfound in [14,15], where several sensors were placed in the construction sites\nof a building and a petrochemical plant, respectively. Both construction sites\nwere full of BLE sensors; in the case of [14] 39 sensors were placed in a 39 \u00d7\n27.5 m construction site, and in the case of [15], 34 sensors in a 2736 site.\nThe positions of all these sensors must be measured and introduced to a\nsoftware manually. Such complex systems could add significant preparation time\nto the construction project. Moreover, the most important drawback of BLE-\nbased systems is their poor accuracy. Generally, BLE can have positioning\nerrors between 1 m and 10 m [15].\n\nThe newest version of BLE, version 5.1 and 5.2, called BLE-AoA, offers\nenhanced accuracy. The ability to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) improves\nthe accuracy of these systems. In fact, the work of [16] proposed an approach\nwhere BLE-AoA is used. However, only 60% of measured estimates had submetre\naccuracy.\n\nAnother radio frequency-based technology for RTLSs is chirp spread spectrum\n(CSS). The authors of [17] proposed an RTLS for safety purposes in a\nconstruction site using CSS. The obtained positioning accuracy was 0.868 m,\nwhich is quite poor if the RTLS must determine if a worker is in a safe or\ndanger zone.\n\nAs explained before, most systems using RFID, BLE, or CSS technologies do not\nalways offer the necessary positioning accuracy for safety applications. As an\nalternative, these technologies can be combined with other sensors for\nenhanced accuracy. For example, the authors of [18] proposed a fusion between\ninertial sensors and BLE. Their system consisted of four fixed BLE sensors on\ntripods and tags with inertial sensors on the hard hats of workers, obtaining\na mean positioning error of 0.32 m in a bridge construction site. In spite of\nthe acceptable positioning performance, their proposal still requires a\ncomplex deployment process.\n\nFor applications of high accuracy, UWB technology is the best radio frequency-\nbased alternative in construction environments [45]. Compared to other radio\nfrequency-based technologies, UWB presents higher immunity to multipath\neffects [46], which is advantageous in environments of high congestion such as\nconstruction sites. Thanks to the high accuracy of UWB, the deployment of an\nRTLS can be simplified.\n\nIn the works of [19,20,21], different methods for the evaluation of UWB\nsystems were defined for construction environments. The most typical\nunfavourable conditions of construction environments were simulated, such as\nthe presence of construction equipment (metallic objects) in the proximity of\nsensors. The authors of [22] ran numerical simulations to test the\napplicability of UWB technology for safety systems. Some other research papers\nwent a step further with the implementation of UWB-based RTLSs in real\nconstruction environments [23,24,25,26]. The accuracies of the RTLSs were\nsuitable for the proposed applications, but the tested systems presented some\ndownsides that need to be corrected. A typical UWB system, such as those of\n[19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26], consists of a set of UWB anchors and tags. The\nanchors are fixed sensors at known locations that perform time difference of\narrival (TDoA) measurements with the tag. For these measurements, the anchors\nneed an accurate clock synchronisation obtained with a wired communication.\nThe TDoA information is then sent to a processing hub via ethernet cables to\ncalculate the position of the tags. The first disadvantage of these systems is\nthe use of cables, since if cables are placed incorrectly, a worker may trip\nand fall. There is also the possibility of accidentally damaging the cable,\nwith the consequence of a poorer performance due to the lack of a sensor.\nThus, some time has to be spent to decide the correct placement of cables. In\naddition to that, as the construction environments are highly dynamic, the\nneed to change the initial placement of anchors can be very common. A tethered\nconfiguration slows these adjustments.\n\nAs a solution, different works present untethered UWB systems for their use in\nconstruction sites [27,28] or as a safety system with a geofencing strategy\n[29]. However, the removal of synchronisation cables can come at the expense\nof poorer accuracy [28].\n\nIf good accuracy is needed without the use of a wired communication, there are\nother UWB-based RTLSs that use time of arrival (ToA) measurements without the\nneed for a time synchronisation [47,48,49]. Nevertheless, RTLSs using ToA\nstill present some deployment complexities that have to be overcome. The\nsuitable positions for anchors must be selected and their positions must be\nmeasured. Moreover, if used as a safety system, the coordinates of danger\nzones must also be measured and introduced to the system [49].\n\nFor faster deployment, there are several works that have proposed the\nautomatic calculation of the positions of anchors [50,51,52,53]. These works\nneed the anchors to communicate with each other, which increases their power\nconsumption. This increase in power demand can be acceptable if anchors are\nplugged in to the electrical network. In construction sites, however, it is\nimportant to avoid wired connections, so anchors should be battery-powered.\nThus, reduced power consumption becomes crucial. Another setback of\n[50,51,52,53] is that a communication link must be added to a central computer\nto decide when the moment of calibration is, and when the moment of normal\noperation begins. The need for a central computer can be burdensome,\nespecially in a large road construction site of hundreds of metres.\n\nA more flexible self-positioning approach is that proposed by [54], which uses\na simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm by fusing data of a\nUWB tag with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Nevertheless, this algorithm\nadds computational complexity and increases the power consumption because of\nthe IMU measurements. Moreover, if a self-positioning approach is to be used\nwith anchors that delimit a safe zone, a polygon must be created with the\npositions of anchors. In this case, the order in which these positions are\njoined is crucial to generate the polygon. The automation of this process\nstill remains a research gap with UWB technology.\n\n## 3\\. Description of the Proposed Safety System\n\nIn this work, the proposed UWB-based safety system is intended to be used in\ndangerous construction environments where a safe zone must be defined for\nwork. This is a typical case in the maintenance of roads and railways, where\nvehicles can be driving at high speeds close to the working place. The\ndeveloped safety system can locate the workers of those environments and give\nthem an alarm if necessary.\n\nThe architecture of the described safety system is presented in Figure 1. Let\nus consider a use case where maintenance work is performed on a road. In this\ncase, workers occupy one of the lanes of the road and it becomes unavailable\nfor normal traffic. However, vehicles are still allowed to use the other lane,\nso a safe working environment must be defined for workers. Usually, the safe\nworking environment is delimited with safety cones. In this work, a safety\nsystem is proposed that adds a UWB-based RTLS to improve the safety awareness\nof workers. The traditional safety cones are replaced by intelligent cones,\nwhich contain UWB anchors. These anchors do not need any cables for powering\nthem, as their low power demand allows them to be powered by photovoltaic\npanels. The workers wear a hard hat containing a UWB tag, as shown in Figure\n2a.\n\nFigure 1. Architecture of the proposed safety system. (a) Distance calculation\nbetween cones and tags, (b) operation under unsafe conditions.\n\nFigure 2. (a) Tag on hard hat of worker and (b) deployment of safety system\nwith marked zones.\n\nDuring the operation, each pair of UWB anchor and tag communicate with each\nother so that the distance between them is estimated, as depicted in blue in\nFigure 1a. The tags collect all these data to calculate the positions of\nworkers in real time. This information is then used to estimate if workers are\nin danger or not. If a worker wearing a tag is detected to be unsafe, their\ntag orders the closest cone to send a warning signal or an alarm, as depicted\nin red in Figure 1b. The type of signal depends on the severity of the\nsituation. In the case of a warning, the closest cone to the unsafe worker\nturns on a light. A visual stimulus is easy to detect and non-intrusive at the\nsame time. Thus, if a warning is given, the worker knows that they may be in\ndanger, and at the same time, they can decide to remain where they are if they\nconsider themselves to be safe. In the case of an alarm, the closest cone to\nthe unsafe worker sends an acoustic signal. Depending on the situation, these\nsignals could be difficult to see or hear. That is why the proposed system has\nbeen designed in such a way that the light is bright enough to be used on\nsunny days. If, in a certain situation, this is not enough, a blinking light\ncan be used, as signals in motion are easier to detect [55]. If the work area\nwere too noisy, a wristband could be added to the workers that sends a vibro-\ntactile alarm instead of an acoustic signal, as by [16,56].\n\nThe safety conditions of workers are determined by defining three different\nzones on the plane: the safe zone, warning zone, and danger zone. Those zones\nhave been drawn on the photograph of Figure 2b. The area inside the polygon of\ncones drawn in green is the safe zone. The outer part of the polygon of cones,\nor the danger zone, is drawn in red. There is also a warning zone drawn in\norange as wide as the base of a cone, which is close to the average shoulder\nwidth of an adult human. For the correct definition of all zones, first the\npositions of cones must be known by the safety system and an identifier number\nmust be given to each cone. As illustrated in Figure 3, the positions of cones\ndefine the polygons that represent all zones. Given a cone width of , two\npolygons are defined: polygon A and polygon B. Polygon A is the result of\nreducing the limits of the cones\u2019 polygon by , while polygon B is obtained by\nincreasing the limits of the cones\u2019 polygon by . The area contained by polygon\nA is called the safe zone and the area outside polygon B is the danger zone.\nThe area of polygon B not contained by A is the warning zone. With the\ndefinition of the warning zone, workers can be warned when they are at risk of\nleaving the safe zone without the necessity of giving an alarm.\n\nFigure 3. Definition of safe, warning, and danger zones with the cones\u2019\npolygon.\n\nEven though only four cones are shown in Figure 3, the safety system supports\na larger number of cones. Moreover, not all cones need to be within\ncommunication range of each other. It is only necessary that a tag be in\ncommunication range of at least four cones. It is important to note that in a\nroad construction site, cones should be separated by about 6 m [57], a\ndistance that is well below the communication range of a UWB system. In fact,\nit is even possible to combine the safety cones of our system with regular\nsafety cones to obtain a more cost-efficient deployment.\n\nAfter the deployment of the proposed safety system, it is ready to be used.\nThe characteristics of the UWB sensors used by our safety system are shown in\nTable 1.\n\nTable 1. Configuration parameters of the ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors.\n\nThe UWB anchors and tags are from SafeLoc Systems S.L. [58] and follow the\nIEEE 802.15.4a standard [59]. These devices are calibrated during production\nby the manufacturer, so there is no need for calibration during the deployment\nof the safety system. The tags on the hard hats of workers communicate\nperiodically with the anchors in the safety cones. This communication allows\nthe estimation of the positions of workers and informs them in real time if\nthey are working in a safe working environment or not. Depending on the\nsituation, a warning or an alarm can be given. If a tag is in the safe zone,\nnothing is done, since the worker wearing that tag is working safely. If the\ntag is detected to be in the warning zone, a warning is given. If the tag is\ndetected to be in the danger zone, an alarm is triggered. In the proposed\nsystem, the tag is responsible for indicating to the closest cone that a\nwarning or danger signal should be sent. Thus, the proposed safety system does\nnot implement multi-hop communication. However, this feature could be added if\nalarms or warnings are to be sent to a potential central server.\n\nIn Figure 4, a flow chart of the operation of our safety system is shown.\n\nFigure 4. Flow chart of the operation of the safety system.\n\nThis flow chart considers the process for tag j at time step i and the\nsubscript n is used to refer to any cone ranging from 0 to . First, the\nranging estimates between each cone and tag are measured by means of the two-\nway ranging (TWR) algorithm [59]. A time-division multiple access (TDMA)\nscheme is used to avoid collisions. However, ranging estimates may contain\nerrors that have to be corrected. Thus, the same method as by [60] is used to\ncorrect the ranging estimates. In the flow chart, the corrected ranging\nestimates are represented as . The corrected ranging estimates are then used\nin an extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm as in [60] to calculate the\npositions of the tags . In order to decide whether or not to warn a worker, it\nhas to be determined in which zone they are. Previously, in the deployment of\nthe safety system, two polygons have been defined based on the cones\u2019 polygon.\nTo determine if a tag\u2019s position is inside a polygon or not, a similar\nalgorithm to that proposed by [61] is used. If the position is detected to be\nin the danger zone, an alarm is sent, if is in the warning zone, a warning is\nsent, and if is in the safe zone, nothing is done.\n\nWith such a configuration as in Table 1, a position estimate can have a\nmaximum delay of 200 ms. This means that if a worker walks straight out of the\nsafe zone, the safety system will detect that worker to be out of the safe\nzone 200 ms after crossing the limit. If we assume that the worker walks at 5\nkm/h, they will be detected 27.8 cm after leaving the safe zone. Thus, if a\nwarning zone of about the average shoulder width of adult humans is used, the\nselected ranging rate of 5 Hz guarantees that the worker will receive a\nwarning before reaching the danger zone. With the selected update rate, up to\nten tags can be monitored, which is more than enough for the number of workers\nusually found on many construction sites.\n\nThe resulting safety system of this work presents several advantages compared\nto other traditional systems. Compared to a typical safety system, where only\nsome safety cones are deployed around the working environment, the addition of\nUWB sensors improves the safety awareness of workers since they are warned if\nthey leave the safe zone. Moreover, compared to other RTLS-based safety\nsystems, our safety system is easy to deploy, more flexible, and less\nintrusive. First, the use of the TWR algorithm avoids the need for any clock\nsynchronisation among UWB anchors inside safety cones. Thus, our proposed\nsafety system does not need any cables among cones that could interfere with\nthe path of a worker or a piece of equipment. Second, the used UWB anchors\nconsume around 200 mA, so photovoltaic cells can be used to power them instead\nof adding cables. Moreover, selecting appropriately the batteries of anchors,\nthe system can also work during the night. The added cost of using the\nproposed safety system with photovoltaic cells and batteries is really\naffordable, especially if we compare it with the more than EUR 1 million that\nan accident can cost an employer [62]. Third, having the anchors of the safety\nsystem in safety cones reduces the time of deployment, since only those cones\nmust be placed where desired, without thinking where to put the UWB anchors.\nThe reduction in time of deployment is also crucial because of the dynamic\nnature of construction sites. During the lifetime of a construction project,\nmany changes must be made, so the deployment of the safety system will be\ncarried out several times. Thus, any reduction in preparation time is\nmultiplied by the changes made during the project. Finally, the highly\ncongested nature of construction environments makes it difficult to add extra\nmaterial for an RTLS. However, safety cones are usually an available element\non construction sites, so our proposed safety system does not occupy extra\nspace.\n\n#### Deployment of Safety System\n\nThe proposed safety system has an easy and simple deployment, as only safety\ncones must be placed where necessary and then their positions must be\nmeasured. The simplest way of measuring their positions is with a robotic\ntotal station. However, when there is a lack of such equipment, our proposed\nsafety system adds the possibility of self-positioning cones. Thus, the\ndeployment of the safety system remains simple even if no accurate equipment\nis available to measure the positions of cones.\n\nA flow chart of the self-positioning process is shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5. Flow chart of self-positioning method.\n\nIn this process, a special tag called the calibration tag is used calculate\nthe distances between each pair of cones. The calibration tag is represented\nwith the subscript . First, the calibration tag is placed for a period of time\nT on each cone. The period of time T allows the system to obtain M ranging\nestimates between the calibration tag on the position of a cone and the rest\nof cones. The flow chart of Figure 5 considers N cones going from 0 to . The\nmth ranging estimate between cone n and the calibration tag placed on the\nposition of cone l is represented as . The variable m takes any value between\n0 and and the variables n and l take any value between 0 and , given that .\n\nOnce the calibration tag has been placed on each cone, the mth distance\nestimate between cones n and l, , is calculated as a mean of the ranging\nestimates from cone n to the calibration tag on cone l and from cone l to the\ncalibration tag on cone n:\n\nWith this process, there are M distance estimates between each couple of\ncones, which are necessary to calculate their positions. The distance\nestimates are saved in M different dissimilarity matrices:\n\nEach dissimilarity matrix is used to calculate the positions of all cones by\nmeans of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm [63].\n\nFinally, the positions of the cones are estimated as the mean of all results\nobtained with those M different dissimilarity matrices. However, as the MDS\nalgorithm only determines the relative positions of the cones, the obtained\nresults have six degrees of freedom (DoF) in space, so the different groups of\ncone position estimates may have different origins of coordinates. Taking into\naccount that our proposed safety system, unlike traditional positioning\nsystems, favours a linear growth of the infrastructure, three geometric\nconstraints are applied:\n\n  * Constraint 1: The first cone where the calibration tag has been placed is assumed to be the origin of coordinates. Figure 6a illustrates this constraint, where cone A0 corresponds to the first cone.\n\n  * Constraint 2: The second cone where the calibration tag has been placed is assumed to only be displaced in the positive direction of the horizontal axis, i.e., , , and . Figure 6b illustrates this constraint, where cone A1 corresponds to the second cone.\n\n  * Constraint 3: The last cone where the calibration tag has been placed is assumed to have a positive y coordinate and . Figure 6c illustrates this constraint. As the example considers four cones, cone A7 corresponds to the last cone.\n\nFigure 6. Application of constraints to cone positions with an example of\neight cones. (a) Constraint 1. (b) Constraint 2. (c) Constraint 3.\n\nNote that as shown in Figure 6, there is no need for the safety cones to form\na rectangle. The proposed self-positioning method can handle any kind of\npolygon shape with any number of cones.\n\nThe calculated cones\u2019 positions and identifiers are stored in the calibration\ntag. This tag is also responsible for sending the cones\u2019 position data and\nidentifiers to the tags on the hard hats of workers so that the operation can\nbegin. The cones\u2019 positions and identifiers are the only information needed by\nthe system to start working.\n\nThis proposed self-positioning process presents many advantages, especially\ninteresting for a safety system on road construction sites. First, there is no\nneed for communication among anchors, which reduces the power consumption.\nThus, the safety system can operate with photovoltaic cells or batteries\ninstead of plugging anchors in to a central power supply. Second, anchors do\nnot need to be connected to a central computer that orders the start of the\ncalibration process or the normal operation. In our case, anchors simply\ncommunicate with tags even in the calibration phase. Finally, by placing the\ncalibration tag on each anchor, the worker easily decides in which order the\npositions of anchors shall be joined to generate the cones\u2019 polygon. This\napproach is less error-prone, as the worker does not have to manually\nintroduce the identification number of each anchor in a central software.\n\n## 4\\. Experiments\n\nThe performance of the proposed safety system was assessed with several\nexperiments. In this section, the performed experiments as well as the used\nevaluation methods are described.\n\n#### 4.1. Indoor Experimental Set-Up\n\nThe proposed safety system was tested in a laboratory at the authors\u2019\ninstitution, trying to emulate the typical case of a maintenance operation on\na straight road or railway. These construction environments have a similar\nshape. They cover a small width of about 4 m per lane [64] or track [65] and\nexpand along the road or railway, forming a rectangle. As shown in Figure 7a,\nsix cones were placed, defining a rectangle of 7 \u00d7 4 m.\n\nFigure 7. (a) Drawing of the deployed set-up. (b) Photograph of the\nexperimental environment.\n\nAround the limits of that rectangle, a warning zone of 0.36 m was defined,\nwhich coincides with the width of the base of the used cones. The origin of\ncoordinates was set on the cone In-A0 and Table 2 shows the real horizontal\ncoordinates of all the cones.\n\nTable 2. Real positions of cones in the indoor environment.\n\nPart of this zone was covered by an Optitrack motion capture system, which is\nable to track the movements of the person with millimetre-level accuracy.\nBecause of the high accuracy of the motion capture system, it was used as\nground truth to evaluate the performance of our proposed safety system.\n\nIn Figure 7b, a photograph of the experimental area is shown. The used cones\nwith the UWB anchors inside can be seen in the photograph. There were some\nobstacles, such as columns or tripods to hold the Optitrack cameras, which\ncould affect the measurements of UWB sensors. However, on a construction site,\nit is not expected to have a clear line of sight between sensors, so this area\ncan give us an idea of how our proposed system could work in a real\nenvironment.\n\nAlthough the real positions of the cones were measured before testing the\nproposed safety system, the self-positioning mode of the proposal was also\nused to compare how well it performs with real or estimated cone positions.\nThe self-positioning of the safety system is performed by placing a tag on\neach safety cone, as explained in Section 3.\n\nIn order to test the proposed safety system, several measurements were taken.\nFirst, as shown in Figure 2a, a 1.78 m tall person wearing a hard hat with the\ntag walked different paths in the zones defined by the safety system. Note\nthat informed consent was obtained from the participant for the publication of\ntheir images and the results of the experiments. The objective of these\nmeasurements was to test the positioning accuracy performance of the safety\nsystem with a moving tag. The tag on the hard hat was always oriented in the\nforward walking direction, while all anchors in the cones were oriented\ntowards the inside of the polygon delimited by the anchors (cones). Thus, the\nrelative anchor\u2013tag angles were different during the experiments, and line-of-\nsight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions occurred. The second type\nof measurements consisted of a person wearing a hard hat and standing at three\ndifferent points close to the limits of the cones\u2019 rectangle. This was carried\nout to evaluate the classification performance of the safety system while\nguaranteeing a similar number of samples in the safe, warning, and danger\nzones. In Table 3, the chosen points are described. In these static\nexperiments, the tag always faced the negative direction of the y-axis drawn\nin Figure 7a. Similarly to the dynamic experiments, the relative anchor\u2013tag\nangles were different in each measured point. Thus, the experiment considered\nvariability in the anchor\u2013tag orientation.\n\nTable 3. Positions of tested points in the indoor environment for\nclassification performance evaluation.\n\nIn the experiments, the tracking of the tag was performed with the real cone\npositions and all the ranging and positioning estimates were saved for further\nanalysis. The saved ranging estimates were then used in simulations along with\nthe calculated cones\u2019 positions by the self-positioning approach. The\nsimulations gave, as a result, the performance of the proposed safety system\nwith the self-positioning approach. This way, the same data were used to\ncompare the performance of the safety system with real and estimated cone\npositions.\n\n#### 4.2. Outdoor Experimental Set-Up\n\nThe proposed safety system was also tested in another environment to test the\nrepeatability of the results with a different deployment. The chosen place was\noutside the building of the authors\u2019 institution, where a road has been\nadapted for pedestrian use. This way, the tests were performed on a road while\nguaranteeing the safety of the people taking the measurements. A picture of\nthe set-up can be seen in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8. Set-up in the outdoor environment.\n\nSimilar to the indoor scenario, the real positions of cones were measured but\nthe self-positioning approach was also used for a comparison between the\nproposed system with self-positioned cones and manually measured cones. The\nreal positions of cones are shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4. Real positions of cones in the outdoor environment.\n\nAs it can be observed, the width of the rectangle was 8 m, which could be the\ncase in maintenance of a two-lane road. There is also a distance of 10 m\nbetween two consecutive cones in the x direction. In a real application, more\nregular cones could be placed in between to add a visual reference of the\nsafety limits.\n\nThe positioning accuracy of the safety system was evaluated by placing the tag\non a tripod with a height of 1.45 m at 12 different points inside and outside\nthe zone delimited by the cones. The chosen points are presented in Table 5.\n\nTable 5. Positions of tested points in the outdoor environment.\n\nThe last three points, Out-P10, Out-P11, and Out-P12, were also used to test\nthe classification performance, since these are the three closest points to\nthe limits between zones. The tag always faced the positive y direction of the\nlocal coordinate system during the measurement.\n\n#### 4.3. Evaluation Methods\n\nThe positioning accuracy of the proposed safety system was measured by\ncomparing the estimated positions with the real ones. In the indoor\nenvironment, the Optitrack motion capture system gave the true path, and in\nthe outdoor environment, the predefined known points where the tag j was\nplaced. For each estimated position , its error was calculated as\n\nwith being the positioning error at time step i, and the two-dimensional (2D)\ncoordinates of the estimated position, and and the 2D coordinates of the real\nposition. Once all the positioning errors were calculated, the system was\nevaluated with the mean positioning error , standard deviation of the\npositioning error , positioning root mean square error (RMSE) [66], and the\nmaximum positioning error .\n\nThe classification performance was evaluated by means of a confusion matrix\n[67], which is a useful tool to analyse the performance of a classifier. In\nthe case of our proposed safety system, we evaluated how well a worker was\ndetected to be in the safe, warning, or danger zone. As our proposed safety\nsystem considers these three different cases, a 3 \u00d7 3 confusion matrix was\nused for its evaluation. Thus, the evaluation of the classifier was performed\nin three steps, considering, in each case, a positive in every step. For\nexample, in the first step, the samples in the danger zone were considered\npositives, while the samples in the warning and safe zones were negatives. In\nthe second step, the samples in the warning zone were considered positives and\nthe samples in the danger and safe zones negatives. In the third and last\nstep, the samples in the safe zone were considered positives and the samples\nin the danger and warning zones negatives. After these three steps, the total\nnumber of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives\nwere summed up to evaluate the overall performance. The accuracy and score\n[67] were used to evaluate the performance of the classifier.\n\n## 5\\. Results\n\n#### 5.1. Positioning Accuracy in Indoor Environment Using Real Cone Positions\n\nThe positioning accuracy of the proposed safety system was first assessed in\nan indoor environment. In this environment, an Optitrack system was available\nand was used to obtain the true path in the dynamic experiments.\n\nIn Figure 9, the walked trajectory of the indoor environment can be seen.\n\nFigure 9. Real vs. estimated trajectory in indoor environment with real cone\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe walked path was a rectangle around the cone In-A0 placed on the origin of\ncoordinates. This path was walked six times, three times clockwise and three\ntimes counter-clockwise. The blue points represent the measured positions by\nthe ground truth and the red circles the estimated positions by the proposed\nsafety system. In the same picture, the cones\u2019 positions are represented with\norange squares. The corresponding metrics of the positioning error are\npresented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6. Positioning accuracy of the safety system indoors with real cone\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe columns of the table, from left to right, represent the mean positioning\nerror , the standard deviation of the positioning error , the positioning\nRMSE, and the maximum positioning error . The units of all statistics are\nmetres.\n\nResults in Table 6 show that the position estimates are similar to those of\nthe ground truth. The measured mean positioning error was 0.172 m with a\nstandard deviation of 0.128 m and an RMSE of 0.214 m. The obtained maximum\npositioning error was 0.983 m, which happened around the bottom-left corner of\nthe walked rectangle. At this place, the estimated position was further away\nfrom the anchors\u2019 rectangle than the real position, so an alarm was given\nanyway.\n\nThe positioning accuracy results suggest that the proposed safety system can\naccurately classify the position of a worker in the previously defined zones.\nThe obtained RMSE was 0.214 m, notably below the average shoulder width of an\nadult human or the width of the base of a safety cone. Moreover, these results\nwere obtained in spite of the obstacles in the tracking area, such as the\ntripods and the column, shown in Figure 7b, as well as the NLOS conditions\nbetween the tag and anchors in the cones. Note that in these measurements,\nthere was no direct line of sight between anchor In-A4 and the tag because of\nthe column shown in Figure 7b. Due to the realism of the tested environment,\nthe proposed safety system is expected to classify correctly if a worker is in\nthe danger, warning, or safe zone in a real construction environment.\n\n#### 5.2. Classification Performance in Indoor Environment Using Real Cone\nPositions\n\nIn order to test the classification performance of our proposed safety system,\na person wearing a tag stood at three different points close to one of the\nlimits of the cones\u2019 rectangle, as shown in Table 3. There were 537 measured\nsamples in the danger zone, 544 samples in the warning zone, and 504 samples\nin the safe zone. The resulting confusion matrix is shown in Table 7.\n\nTable 7. Confusion matrix of the safety system indoors.\n\nThe safety system classified the tag to be in the correct zone with an\naccuracy of 96.6% and an score of 94.9%. The only misclassified samples were\n81 samples in the warning zone detected as in danger. We consider this case\nsafer than misclassifying the tag in the warning zone as safe, since the user\nof the safety system should not spend too much time in the warning zone. If a\nworker receives an alarm in the warning zone, they will be aware of the risk\nof this zone. Moreover, the warning zone had no false positives.\n\nNote that all samples in the safe zone were classified as safe. The absence of\nfalse alarms in the safe zone is important not to annoy the worker wearing the\ntag and maintain their safety commitment. The other way around was also true,\nas all samples in the danger zone were classified as in danger. This means\nthat an alarm was always given while the person wearing the tag remained in\nthe danger zone, improving their safety awareness.\n\nAs a conclusion of the first two experiments in the indoor environment, the\nproposed safety system proved to be useful to tell with high reliability if a\nworker is in a safe working zone or not.\n\n#### 5.3. Indoor Performance Using Self-Positioned Cones\n\nThe proposed safety system has a simple deployment thanks to the self-\npositioning feature. To evaluate this feature, the calibration tag was placed\non each safety cone and the distances to other cones were measured, as\ndescribed in the procedure of Section 3. At the position of each cone, 20\nestimates of the distance to the other cones were calculated. With a ranging\nrate of 5 Hz, the self-positioning demanded only 4 s per cone. The resulting\ncone position estimates are shown in Table 8 for the indoor environment.\n\nTable 8. Real vs. estimated cone positions in indoor environment.\n\nAs can be observed in the table, the cones were self-positioned with two\ndifferent configurations. The first configuration, In-conf1, fixed the cone\nIn-A0 as the origin of coordinates. The second configuration, In-conf2, fixed\nthe cone In-A3 as the origin of coordinates. Two configurations are presented\nin this work to show the influence of the chosen origin of coordinates on the\nperformance of the safety system. In the indoor environment, positions were\nalways recorded close to the cone In-A0. If we fix this cone as the origin of\ncoordinates, the positioning accuracy will not be highly influenced by the\nerrors of the estimated cone infrastructure. However, if we fix the cone\nIn-A3, which is the opposite of In-A0, the errors of the estimated cone\ninfrastructure could have a higher influence.\n\nWith the estimated cone positions, a new analysis as in the previous two\nsubsections was made to test the performance of the proposed safety system in\nthe indoor environment. In Figure 10a, the walked real and estimated\ntrajectories can be seen with the cone infrastructure resulting from the\nconfiguration In-conf1.\n\nFigure 10. Real vs. estimated trajectory in indoor environment with estimated\ncone infrastructure.\n\nFigure 10b shows the real and estimated trajectories with the cone\ninfrastructure resulting from the configuration In-conf2. The blue points\nrepresent the measured positions by the ground truth and the red circles the\nestimated positions by the proposed safety system. The real cone positions are\nrepresented with orange squares and the estimated cone positions with black\nsquares. The corresponding statistics of the positioning error are presented\nin Table 9.\n\nTable 9. Positioning accuracy of the safety system indoors with self-\npositioned cones.\n\nThe obtained positioning accuracy results did not highly differ from the\noriginal measurements with the real cone infrastructure. The configuration In-\nconf1 obtained a mean error of 0.212 m and In-conf2 obtained a mean error of\n0.157 m, while the original measurement obtained a mean error of 0.172 m. The\nreason for these small differences between In-conf1 and In-conf2 lies in the\nerrors that the estimated positions of cones had with different self-\npositioning configurations, which can be observed in the last column of Table\n8. These errors influenced the estimated positions of the tag. In spite of\nthese small differences, we can conclude that the positioning accuracy with\nthe self-positioned cones was still good enough for the proposed application.\nMoreover, the RMSE value remained, in both configurations, notably below the\naverage shoulder width of an adult human.\n\nIn order to confirm the adequacy of the proposed safety system with self-\npositioned cones, the classification performance was also evaluated with the\nsame tests as in Section 5.2. Table 10 shows the obtained confusion matrices\nwith both configurations of the self-positioning approach of cones.\n\nTable 10. Confusion matrix of the safety system indoors with self-positioned\ncones.\n\nBoth approaches obtained a good classification performance and were almost\nidentical, with an accuracy of 97.0% and an score of 95.5%. The few\nmisclassified samples consisted of 72 samples in the warning zone\nmisclassified as in danger in the case of In-conf1, and 71 samples in the\nwarning zone misclassified as in danger in the case of In-conf2.\n\nAs discussed in Section 5.2, it is safer to misclassify a worker in the\nwarning zone as in the danger zone than in the safe zone. Moreover, it is\nimportant to remark that no samples in the safe zone were misclassified as in\ndanger and no samples in the danger zone were misclassified as safe. Moreover,\nboth self-positioning approaches obtained a slightly better classification\nperformance than the results with the real cone infrastructure. As a\nconsequence, it can be concluded that using the self-positioning approach of\ncones at least maintains the reliability of the safety system. Not having an\naccurate piece of equipment to measure the cones\u2019 positions should not be a\nproblem.\n\n#### 5.4. Classification Performance in Movement\n\nA key performance indicator of our proposed safety system is the number of\nsamples in the danger zone misclassified as safe and samples in the safe zone\nmisclassified as in danger. These misclassified samples were zero in the\nprevious experiments, but only static measurements were taken. Taking\nadvantage of the availability of the Optitrack system in the indoor\nenvironment, a 1.78 m tall person wearing a hard hat with a tag walked two\ndifferent paths, one remaining in the safe zone and the other remaining in the\ndanger zone. In both cases, the tag remained approximately 0.5 m away from the\nlimits of the cones\u2019 rectangle and faced the forward walking direction. With\nthe same two experiments, positions with the real cone infrastructure and the\ntwo configurations of the self-positioned cones were obtained. The results are\nshown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Trajectories walking 0.5 m away from the cones\u2019 limits.\n\nThe blue points represent the measured positions by the ground truth and the\nred circles the estimated positions by the proposed safety system. The real\ncone positions are represented with orange squares and the estimated cone\npositions with black squares. In Table 11, the number of correctly estimated\nsamples is shown for each case of Figure 11.\n\nTable 11. Classification performance in movement.\n\nThe majority of samples were estimated to be in their correct zones. With the\nreal cone infrastructure, shown in Figure 11a,b, only a single sample out of\n246 taken in the danger zone was misclassified as in the warning zone. All 159\nsamples of the safe zone were classified as safe. With the estimated cone\ninfrastructure with the configuration In-conf1, shown in Figure 11c,d, all 246\nsamples in the danger zone were classified as in danger. Only a single sample\nout of the 159 samples in the safe zone was misclassified as in the warning\nzone. The classification performance obtained with the estimated cone\ninfrastructure with configuration In-conf2, shown in Figure 11e,f, was\nidentical to that obtained with In-conf1.\n\nAs with the previous results in classification performance, no false alarms\nwere given while the tag was in the safe zone and at least one warning was\ngiven while the tag was in the danger zone. Having a moving tag did not affect\nthe classification performance. The classification performance was also\nunchanged with the real and estimated cone infrastructures.\n\n#### 5.5. Outdoor Performance\n\nAs the proposed safety system had a good performance in the indoor\nenvironment, its repeatability was tested by taking some more tests in an\noutdoor environment. As in the indoor environment, all tests were performed\nwith the real cone infrastructure and two configurations of the self-\npositioning approach: Out-conf1 and Out-conf2. The estimated cone positions in\nthe outdoor environment can be seen in Table 12.\n\nTable 12. Real vs. estimated cone positions in outdoor environment.\n\nThe configuration Out-conf1 fixed the cone Out-A0 to the origin of\ncoordinates, and the configuration Out-conf2 fixed the cone Out-A2 to its real\nposition, as it was the furthest cone from the measurement zone.\n\nAs in the indoor environment, first the positioning accuracy was tested. A tag\non a tripod was placed on 12 different points inside and outside the cones\u2019\nrectangle. Figure 12a,c,e show the area covered by the cones in this\nmeasurement campaign and the real and estimated positions of these cones.\nFigure 12b,d,f present the real and estimated positions of the tag.\n\nFigure 12. Real vs. estimated measured positions of the proposed safety system\noutdoors.\n\nThe blue squares represent the real positions of the tag and the dots the\nestimated positions. A different colour is used for the estimated positions at\neach point. The orange squares represent the positions of the cones. In the\ncases of estimated cone infrastructure, black squares are added to indicate\nthe estimated cone positions. The corresponding statistics of the measured\npositioning errors are shown in Table 13, Table 14 and Table 15.\n\nTable 13. Positioning accuracy of the safety system outdoors with real cone\npositions.\n\nTable 14. Positioning accuracy of the safety system outdoors with\nconfiguration Out-conf1.\n\nTable 15. Positioning accuracy of the safety system outdoors with\nconfiguration Out-conf2.\n\nFrom left to right, the columns of the table contain the following\ninformation: name of the measured point, mean positioning error , standard\ndeviation of the positioning error , positioning RMSE, and maximum positioning\nerror . The units of all statistics are metres.\n\nWith the ideal case of real cone infrastructure, the positioning accuracy was\ngood enough for the application of the safety system. The mean positioning\nerror was 0.134 m, the standard deviation was 0.069 m, the RMSE was 0.151 m,\nand the maximum error was 0.466 m. Moreover, all points presented an RMSE\nnotably below the average shoulder width of an adult human.\n\nComparing the results in Table 13, Table 14 and Table 15, we can observe that\nthe positioning accuracy was not significantly influenced by using the\nestimated cone positions instead of the real ones. As in the indoor\nexperiments, a satisfactory positioning accuracy was obtained both measuring\nthe real positions of cones or using the self-positioning approach.\n\nIn order to evaluate the classification performance, the points Out-P10,\nOut-P11, and Out-P12 were chosen, as they were the closest ones to a limit.\nThe resulting confusion matrix is shown in Table 16.\n\nTable 16. Confusion matrix of the safety system outdoors.\n\nOverall, there were 913 measured samples in the danger zone, 845 samples in\nthe warning zone, and 943 samples in the safe zone.\n\nUsing the real cone positions, the classification accuracy was 97.5% with an\nscore of 96.3%. No samples in the danger zone were misclassified as safe or\nthe other way around. Using the estimated cone positions, both approaches\nobtained identical results. The classification accuracy was 98.9% with an\nscore of 98.3%. Thus, we can conclude that the classification performance of\nour proposed safety system is similar in both outdoor and indoor environments.\nMoreover, our proposed safety system proved to have high reliability without\nthe need to measure the positions of cones with extra equipment.\n\n#### 5.6. Summary of Results\n\nIn Table 17, a summary of the obtained results is shown.\n\nTable 17. Summary of obtained results.\n\nThe proposed safety system has shown to have good accuracy with both static\nand dynamic measurements, so the EKF algorithm works similarly in both types\nof measurements. The mean positioning error and the RMSE values have always\nbeen far below the average shoulder width of an adult human. This positioning\naccuracy was translated to a highly reliable classification performance, which\nshowed accuracies of at least 96.6%. If the tag was placed in the safe zone,\nfalse alarms were never registered. If the tag was in the danger zone, it was\nnever considered to be safe. These results were obtained in two different\nenvironments with different deployments, so the results are repeatable. The\nself-positioning approach was also tested with the safety system, which\nresulted in a small impact on the classification performance. The proposed\nsafety system using the self-positioning of cones can be as reliable as with\nknown cone positions.\n\n#### 5.7. Comparison with State of the Art\n\nOur proposed safety system is compared with the state of art in Table 18.\n\nTable 18. Comparison with state-of-the-art safety systems.\n\nThe reported data in [14,16,17,18,19,20,21,23,24,25,28] have been used in the\ncomparison table, as we have not been able to make this comparison by\nsimulation or real testing. The first two columns of Table 18 contain the used\ntechnology in each work and the testing condition (static or dynamic). From\nthe third to the sixth columns, some performance metrics are shown: the\npresented mean positioning error, the presented positioning RMSE, the\npresented classification accuracy, and the presented score. Finally, the last\nfour columns describe the simplicity of the deployment of the proposed\nsystems. Column 7 indicates whether or not anchors are connected by cables,\nColumn 8 indicates whether or not extra infrastructure is needed, Column 9\nindicates whether or not an auto-positioning solution of fixed sensors is\nproposed, and Column 10 indicates the time to deploy the safety system. Note\nthat not all these data are available in all the works. If a piece of\ninformation is not available, this is indicated with N.A. in the corresponding\ncell.\n\nCompared to the works using BLE and BLE 5.1 [14,16], our proposed safety\nsystem obtained better accuracy and score. Moreover, our system is simpler to\ndeploy. The solution of [14] needs to put the BLE fixed sensors on the ceiling\nof a building under construction, while [16] needs to use poles with a height\nof 10 m. Apart from that, after the deployment of the safety systems, the\nsolutions of [14,16] do not mention any method to simplify the position\nmeasurement of fixed sensors.\n\nAlthough the accuracy of BLE can be improved with the help of inertial sensors\n[18], our proposed safety system obtained better positioning accuracy.\nMoreover, the work of [18] is more complex to deploy than our proposal and\nadds extra elements to the construction site.\n\nCompared to [17], where CSS was used, our proposed safety system obtains lower\npositioning mean errors thanks to UWB technology. The authors of [17] gave\nimportance to the simplification of the deployment of their system. That is\nthe reason why they avoided using any cabling system among fixed sensors. They\nalso indicate that in the run experiment, two people needed about 13 min to\nset up the whole system on a construction site. Due to the differences between\nour tested site and theirs, it is difficult to compare the deployment time of\nour safety system to theirs. However, an important part of the deployment of\n[17] consists of moving from one point to the other of the construction site\nand installing the necessary fixed sensors. In the experiments presented in\nthis work, one minute was needed to perform the deployment of the system. It\nshould be noted that in our case, the time spent placing cones on their\npositions should not be counted, as safety cones would have been placed\nanyway. We only need to place the calibration tag, taking 4 s, on each cone to\nestimate the cones\u2019 positions, which considerably simplifies the deployment.\n\nCompared to most of the works using UWB [19,20,21,23,24,25], our proposed\nsafety system does not need any cabling system among anchors. These cabling\nsystems suppose extra deployment time and increased hazard because of the risk\nfor a worker to trip and fall with one of the cables. The work of [28]\nsuccessfully removed the cabling system at the expense of reduced accuracy.\nCompared to [19,20,21,23,24,25], however, our proposed safety system achieves\nsimilar accuracy and does not need any cables among anchors.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nIn this work, a safety system based on UWB RTLS has been proposed. Our\nproposal is especially interesting for maintenance works of roads and\nrailways, but it could also be used for any construction site where a safe\nworking environment has to be delimited with cones.\n\nUnlike other proposals, our safety system is deployed easily and adapts\nquickly to any change in the construction project. Moreover, our hardware is\nplaced inside safety cones, a piece of equipment which is already common on\nconstruction sites. Thus, our proposal adds no extra congestion to\nconstruction sites and it is unobtrusive. Moreover, the high accuracy of UWB\ntechnology makes the system capable of accurately detecting if a worker is in\na predetermined safe zone or not.\n\nA typical bottleneck of systems similar to ours is measuring the positions of\ncones that contain UWB anchors. If the needed equipment is not available to\nmeasure the positions of cones, the deployment can be burdensome and error-\nprone. As a solution, an approach to quickly calculate the positions of cones\nhas been proposed using UWB measurements of available sensors. The proposed\nself-positioning approach does not require that anchors communicate with each\nother or that they be connected to a central computer. In this way, the power\nconsumption is reduced and there is no need to add a communication link, which\nadds preparation time. Moreover, this novel self-positioning approach also\ncalculates automatically the coordinates of the limits of the safe, warning,\nand danger zones.\n\nThe obtained results show that our proposed safety system does not have\nsignificant differences in its performance if real or estimated cone positions\nare used. In any case, the RMSE was always considerably below the average\nshoulder width of an adult human. Moreover, no false alarms were registered\nwhen the tag was in the safe zone, and in the danger zone, a warning or an\nalarm was always given.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, L.Z.-C. and I.V.; methodology, A.O.-d.-E.-L., L.Z.-C. and\nI.V.; software, A.O.-d.-E.-L., L.Z.-C. and I.V.; validation, A.O.-d.-E.-L.,\nL.Z.-C. and I.V.; formal analysis, A.O.-d.-E.-L., L.Z.-C. and I.V.;\ninvestigation, A.O.-d.-E.-L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation,\nA.O.-d.-E.-L.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.Z.-C. and I.V.; visualization,\nA.O.-d.-E.-L., L.Z.-C. and I.V.; supervision, L.Z.-C. and I.V.; project\nadministration, L.Z.-C. and I.V.; funding acquisition, L.Z.-C. and I.V.
