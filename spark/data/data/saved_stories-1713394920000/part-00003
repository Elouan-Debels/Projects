Lingjun apologised for the negative impact in a statement on its\nwebsite in February. The firm said it \"holds long-term bullish views on\nChinese stocks and will stick to long positions,\" adding it will review the\nproblems existing in transactions.\n\n## What is ailing China's stock market?\n\n### Zero-COVID\n\nChina\u2019s tough three-year zero-COVID policies hurt business confidence, and\nhindered domestic demand, production and investment. Despite an initial bounce\nin activities after Beijing lifted lockdowns in early 2023, the economic\nrecovery remains bumpy and uneven. Consumers are not spending, prices are\nfalling and the deflation risk is affecting company earnings. More and more\ncompanies are turning to overseas markets for growth.\n\n### Real estate\n\nChina's real estate sector, which contributes about a quarter of GDP, has been\nin a prolonged downturn. New home prices saw their worst declines in nine\nyears in 2023. A number of top property developers have defaulted on their\ndebts in the past few years and have been struggling to deliver unfinished\nprojects. Property giant China Evergrande Group\u2019s liquidation in January this\nyear dealt a fresh blow to market confidence.\n\n### Sino-U.S. tensions\n\nCompetition between the U.S. and China has spread from technology to trade and\nfinance. The Biden administration has restricted certain U.S. investments in\nChina. Large pension and endowment funds in the U.S. and its allies have also\ncut China\u2019s exposure to avoid political risks.\n\n### Regulatory crackdown\n\nChina\u2019s crackdown on the tech sector has wiped out over $1 trillion of value\nfrom its big tech companies since November 2020. Foreign direct investment\nfell to a 30-year low in 2023 as companies moved manufacturing to countries\nsuch as India, Mexico and Vietnam in the wake of mounting geopolitical\npressures, data privacy rules and regulatory crackdowns.\n\nInvestor fund flows into Chinese equities\n\nNet flows into China-focused offshore funds\n\nForeign flows through Hong Kong Connect\n\n0.3\n\nOutflow streak in Chinese equities halted in February and March after a slew\nof government measures were introduced to prop up the crashing stocks.\n\n$20 bln\n\n$4 bln\n\n15\n\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22122\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22123\n\n\u221215\n\nJan.\n\n2023\n\nApril\n\nJuly\n\nOct.\n\nJan.\n\n2024\n\nJan.\n\n2023\n\nApril\n\nJuly\n\nOct.\n\nJan.\n\n2024\n\nThe graphic has two bar charts, one showing monthly flows into China-focused\noffshore funds from January 2023 to Feb. 21, 2024 and another showing foreign\nflows through Hong Kong Connect from January 2023 to January 2024.\n\n## What is wrong with the economy?\n\nSince 2022, when President Xi Jinping consolidated his power, Beijing has\noften stated its objectives are to achieve high-quality development, and to\nbalance that with security.\n\nKey among those priorities are reforms of the indebted state sector and local\ngovernments, channelling of resources towards technological self-sufficiency,\nmeasures to boost domestic investment and consumption in electric vehicles,\nartificial intelligence, green energy projects, and fighting monopolies and\ncorruption.\n\nChina\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP)\n\nAnnual GDP growth target vs. actual GDP growth\n\n10%\n\nTarget set as\n\nabove this figure\n\nExact figure is the target\n\n8\n\nNo target set\n\ndue to COVID-19\n\nTarget set as\n\naround this figure\n\n6\n\nTarget set as range (+0.5)\n\n4\n\n2024\n\naround\n\n5%\n\n2\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\nThe graphic shows China\u2019s annual GDP growth target with actual GDP growth from\n2008 to 2023 and the target for 2024 which hasn\u2019t been officially announced.\n\nPolicy and loan prime rates\n\n5%\n\nFeb. 20, 2024\n\nCut by 25 bps\n\n5-year\n\nloan prime rate\n\n4\n\n3.95%\n\n1-year\n\nloan prime rate\n\n3.45%\n\n3\n\nMedium-term\n\npolicy loan rate\n\n2.50%\n\n2\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nThe graphic is a line chart on China\u2019s policy rates showing three indicators \u2014\n5-year loan prime rate, 1-year loan prime rate and medium-term policy loan\nrate \u2014 from ....\n\nPrivate firms, which account for 60% of gross domestic product and 80% of\nurban jobs in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, are suffering not just from\nthree years of COVID curbs but also regulatory crackdowns that have targeted\nsectors from technology to finance and private tutoring.\n\nMany provinces are drowning in debt, as a key source of income \u2013 land sales \u2013\nhave collapsed. The total debt of China's local government financial vehicles,\nor LGFVs, was estimated to be above $9 trillion in 2023, equivalent to half of\nthe country's economy. The sustained downturn in the property sector has been\na key drag on the country's broader recovery. With wages and home prices\ndropping, consumer confidence is struggling.

Beijing has\nalso delivered deep cuts to bank reserves and benchmark mortgage rates to get\nbanks to lend more and to revive home buying.\n\nChina\u2019s economic forecasts\n\nAnnual real GDP (Y/Y)\n\nAnnual average inflation\n\n3%\n\n8%\n\n6\n\nActual\n\nvalues\n\nForecast\n\n2\n\nForecast\n\n4\n\n1\n\nActual values\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\n2026\n\n2028\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\n2026\n\n2028\n\nThe graphic is line charts on China\u2019s quarterly GDP (actual values in\n2022-2023, forecasts from 2024-2025) and inflation rate (monthly actual values\nfrom January 2022 to January 2024, and quarterly forecasts from Q1 2024 to Q4\n2025)\n\nBeijing has outlined plans for more affordable housing and urban village\nrenovation and infrastructure.
