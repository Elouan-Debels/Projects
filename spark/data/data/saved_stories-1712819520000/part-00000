First, there are the round, non-rechargeable button cells for your\nwatches and small items. There\u2019s also the popular AA and AAA cylindrical\nbatteries for calculators, clocks and remotes. Then you have the rechargeable\nlithium-ion batteries in your laptops and phones. And don\u2019t forget about the\nlead-acid battery in your car.\n\nI\u2019m a professor who studies batteries and electrochemistry. To understand why\nbatteries come in many different sizes and shapes \u2013 and serve many purposes \u2013\nlook to the past, at how batteries originated and how they have developed over\nthe years.\n\nThe first batteries were made in the 1800s, and they were quite simple. One of\nthe first demonstrations was a series of metal discs soaked in brine, which\nItalian scientist Alessandro Volta found created an electric current. The\nfirst lead-acid battery was made of a few pieces of lead in a jar of sulfuric\nacid. The modern versions are not that different. They\u2019re just easier to\nmanufacture and contain various additives to improve performance.\n\nIn all cases, batteries perform in the same manner: a voltage difference\nbetween two dissimilar electrodes produces an electric current, which can be\ndischarged to power a device. Rechargeable batteries can then reverse this\ncurrent to charge back up. Inside the battery, the electric current is\naccompanied by the flow of ions through a liquid, the electrolyte.\n\nThe passage of each electron in the current is accompanied by the transport of\none ion through the electrolyte. Electrodes that can store more ions lead to\nbatteries that can hold more charge and therefore last longer on a single\ncharge. Electrodes that are engineered for faster ion storage lead to\nbatteries that can discharge faster, for high-power applications. Lastly,\nbeing able to charge and discharge many times without degrading leads to\nbatteries with long lifetimes.\n\n## Lead-acid batteries\n\nThe lead-acid battery was the first rechargeable battery invented back in 1859\nby Gaston Plante, who experimented with lead plates in an acidic solution and\nfound that the flow and storage of electric current could be reversed.\n\nA lead-acid battery has to be big enough to provide enough charge to start a\ncar. It also has to be usable in cold climates and last many years. Since the\nelectrolyte is a corrosive acid, the external casing has to be tough to\nprotect people and car parts from any possible harm. Knowing all this, it\nmakes sense that modern lead-acid batteries are blocky and heavy.\n\n## Alkaline batteries\n\nOn the other hand, household devices like calculators and digital scales can\nafford to use smaller batteries because they don\u2019t require a lot of charge.\nThese are primarily non-rechargeable alkaline batteries that have been used\nfor decades. The standardized cell sizes are AAAA, AAA, AA, C and D, as well\nas button and coin cells and many others. The sizes are related to how much\ncharge they store \u2013 the bigger the battery, the more it holds \u2013 and the sizes\nof the devices they power.\n\nSometimes, you may find alkaline batteries sold in rectangular shapes, like\ncommon 9-volt batteries, but open the outer casing and you\u2019ll find that they\nare simply a few cylindrical cells connected together inside. Cylindrical\nbatteries have been around so long and used so widely that it just doesn\u2019t\nmake sense for the companies to manufacture anything different \u2013 it would\nrequire an investment to change their manufacturing facilities, something\nthey\u2019d rather not do.\n\nAre 9-volt batteries as different from AAA batteries as you think? Take a look\ninside.\n\n## Lithium ion batteries\n\nNickel-cadmium batteries were the first widely used rechargeable batteries for\nhousehold electronics and were popular through the end of the 20th century.\nBut they had their pitfalls. Cadmium is very toxic, and the batteries suffered\nfrom a \u201cmemory effect,\u201d which decreased their lifetime.\n\nFor many decades, lithium was studied for potential use in rechargeable\nbatteries because of its unique properties as a lightweight metal that stores\na lot of energy. Sony first commercialized the lithium-ion battery in 1991.\n\nThe company made cylindrical cells because these were the easiest to\nmanufacture. In the 1990s, Sony was making lots of camcorders and tapes, and\nthus had lots of equipment for roll-to-roll manufacturing. It was natural to\nrepurpose this equipment to produce rolls of battery electrodes, which are\nmade by casting films on sheets of copper or aluminum and then rolling them up\ninto a \u201cjelly roll\u201d cylinder.\n\nCylindrical batteries are made of many thin layers rolled up like a jelly\nroll. OpenStax/Wikimedia, CC BY\n\nThe thick casing of these cylindrical cells is mechanically strong, and to add\nanother layer of safety they have a pressure relief valve. Very quickly, these\nearly lithium-ion cells took over the portable electronics market, especially\nfor laptops and cellphones, because they stored more energy and lasted longer\nthan the nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries.\n\n## Factors that shape batteries\n\nBatteries are made in certain sizes and shapes for reasons of cost and\nmanufacturability, but in other cases because of legacy manufacturing\nprocesses. Market demand also plays a role.\n\nFor example, electric vehicles didn\u2019t take off until Tesla started making cars\nusing cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells rather than the rectangular pouch\nor prismatic cells other EV makers have used. Pouch and prismatic cells can be\npacked closely together, but because cylindrical cells were already being\nmass-produced for portable electronics, Tesla was able to make lower-cost EVs\nin the 2010s.\n\nWhat shapes and sizes batteries will take in the future depends not only on\nhow much energy they store, but also on market economics \u2013 how easy it is to\nmake each type of cell, how much it costs to make them and what they\u2019re used\nfor. And those factors are a mix of innovation and history.\n\n  * Energy\n  * Batteries\n  * Technology\n  * Lithium-ion batteries\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Senior Research Development Coordinator\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\n  * ##### Director, Defence and Security\n\n  * ##### Opportunities with the new CIEHF\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
