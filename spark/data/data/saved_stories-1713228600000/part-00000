The Borrower has the\nability to issue additional Secured Convertible Notes, provided the aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding does not exceed $50 million.\n\n> \u201cThe proceeds from Tether\u2019s investment in Satellogic will help advance our\n> mission as we continue to focus on our U.S. strategy, the National Security\n> market, and our global Space Systems opportunities\u201d\n>\n> Post this\n\n\u201cThe proceeds from Tether\u2019s investment in Satellogic will help advance our\nmission as we continue to focus on our U.S. strategy, the National Security\nmarket, and our global Space Systems opportunities,\u201d said Emiliano Kargieman,\nCEO & Founder of Satellogic.\n\n\u201cThis new facility will provide necessary funding as we look to continue\nexpanding in 2024,\u201d added Rick Dunn, CFO of Satellogic.\n\nThe Secured Convertible Notes initially bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus\n6.50% per annum, subject to an additional 4.0% per annum if certain events of\ndefault occur and are continuing. The Secured Convertible Notes are guaranteed\nby the Company and each of the Company\u2019s material subsidiaries (other than the\nBorrower), and are secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s and its\nsubsidiaries\u2019 assets (including all of its and their intellectual property).\nAs noted above, the Borrower may issue additional Secured Convertible Notes\nunder the terms thereof to other third parties, provided the aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding does not exceed $50 million. The Secured\nConvertible Notes mature on April 12, 2028.\n\nThe Secured Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s\nClass A ordinary share (the \u201cClass A Ordinary Shares\u201d) at an initial\nconversion price of $1.20 (or 833 Class A Ordinary Shares per $1,000 principal\namount of Secured Convertible Notes), subject to customary anti-dilution\nadjustments. Conversion of the Secured Convertible Notes held by the Purchaser\ninto Class A Ordinary Shares is subject to CFIUS Approval (as defined in the\nSecured Convertible Notes).\n\nIn the event of an asset sale by the Company (outside the ordinary course of\nbusiness) or an insurance or condemnation event that results in net proceeds\nto the Company in excess of $2 million, the Borrower will be required to offer\nto prepay the Secured Convertible Notes up to the amount of the relevant\nproceeds at par (unless such proceeds are used to purchase comparable assets\nwithin six months). In the event the Secured Convertible Notes are accelerated\nas a result of an event of default, the Borrower must pay a prepayment penalty\nequal to 5% of the greater of (i) the outstanding principal amount of Secured\nConvertible Notes and (ii) the then-prevailing conversion value. In connection\nwith a change of control of the Company (including delisting of the Company\u2019s\nClass A Ordinary Shares), the holder has the right to require the Borrower to\nrepurchase the Secured Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to the\ngreater of (a) 105% of the redemption value of the Secured Convertible Notes\nand (b) 105% of the then-prevailing conversion value, plus accrued but unpaid\ninterest thereon, as well as any other amounts owed (the \u201cPut Price\u201d). The\nBorrower also has the right to repurchase or force-convert the Secured\nConvertible Notes in connection with a full acquisition of the Company at the\nPut Price.\n\nThe Secured Convertible Notes contain certain restrictive covenants, including\nrestrictions on (i) incurring indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions\n(including the ability to issue additional Secured Convertible Notes; provided\nthe aggregate principal outstanding amount does not exceed $50 million), (ii)\ncreating certain liens, subject to certain exceptions, (iii) the payment of\ndividends or other restricted payments, (iv) the sale, transfer or otherwise\nconveyance of certain assets, subject to the asset sale prepayment described\nabove, and (v) certain affiliate transactions.\n\nIn connection with the Offering, the Company also entered into with the\nPurchaser (i) a side letter, pursuant to which the Purchaser will be entitled\nto pre-emptive rights in order to maintain its as-converted ownership\npercentage on the same basis as new capital raised and (ii) a registration\nrights agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to register for resale\nthe Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion of the Secured\nConvertible Notes.\n\nThe offer and sale of the Secured Convertible Notes are not being registered\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or the\nsecurities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Secured Convertible Notes may\nnot be offered or sold in the United States except in transactions exempt\nfrom, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act\nand any applicable state securities laws.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation\nof an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of securities of the Borrower\nor the Company in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer,\nsolicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or\nqualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\n\nAbout Tether\n\nTether is a pioneer in the field of stablecoin technology, driven by an aim to\nrevolutionize the global financial landscape.
