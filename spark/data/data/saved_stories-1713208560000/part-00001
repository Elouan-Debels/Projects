However, it never saw widespread use\nand remained an obscure piece of history.\n\nThe Lucky Strike Spy camera was developed in the late 1940s by the US\nMilitary.\n\nIn the 1950s, two cameras were created for police use in Japan, both based on\npistols.\n\nThe original Doryu gun camera failed to gain traction due to its use of 9.5mm\nfilm instead of the more common 16mm format.\n\nBy the time it was updated, officers had already switched to the rival Mamiya\npistol camera, which was eventually discontinued as well.\n\nAmong the collection is the oldest and most valuable camera, an 1886 Ladies-\nPattern Patent Watch Camera made by J. Lancaster and Son from Birmingham.\n\nThis camera was a true masterpiece, cleverly disguised as a pocket watch but\nopening up to reveal a hidden camera inside.\n\nThe 1904 Ticka Watch allowed the user to take surreptitious photographs.\n\nThe camera collection was auctioned a few years ago at Bonhams, where Jon\nBaddeley, the expert, commented:\n\n\u201cThe origins of these secret cameras goes back to the 19th century when 99.9\npercent of photographs taken were stuffy portraits.\n\nThere was very little in the way of reportage photographs, and if you wanted\nto capture photos of people acting naturally you had to be discreet about it.\n\nIt was thought very offensive to just take out a camera and start taking\nphotographs of people. Inventors starting coming up with numerous ways of\nconcealing cameras in day-to-day objects like books, wrist watches and even\nrings.\n\nWhile a lot of them were mere novelties some were developed for James Bond-\nesque espionage.\n\nThe US Signal Corps came up with a camera just after WWII that was hidden in a\npacket of Lucky Strike cigarettes, while the police in Japan had several made\nwhich looked like a pistol.\n\nUnsurprisingly many of these cameras were commercial failures and so very few\nwere made, but that is precisely what gives them their value now.\n\nThe irony is that now we conceal cameras in our telephones and photography has\nnever been more popular.\n\nThe majority of these cameras have come from a single collector who has pieced\ntogether an incredible archive over the years which really sheds light on an\naspect of photography that many won\u2019t be aware of.\u201d\n\nThis ABC watch camera, made in 1948, features a lens in the back of the\nwatch\u2019s body.\n\nThis ladies\u2019 pattern patent watch camera would be used by a female agent in\n1886.\n\nThis gun camera was developed in 1954 and shot on a 16mm film and is one of\ntwo gun cameras that were used by Japanese police.\n\nThis 1952 Mamiya pistol camera was also made in Japan.\n\nThis book camera was made in 1888 in Germany.\n\n\u2018Mast Concealable camera\u2019 from 1950.\n\nThis 1886 concealed vest camera was designed to be worn inside clothing with\nthe lens pointing out of a buttonhole.\n\nA 1981 ring camera from Italy.\n\nThe Russian Minox camera is disguised as a radio.\n\nThe bizarre French-made Le Photo Revolver.\n\nThis Expo Police camera from New York went on sale between 1911 and 1924.\n\nThis 1886 device was described as the Improved pattern patent watch camera and\nis one of the few surviving examples which uses photographic plates, pictured\nin the foreground, instead of film.\n\nThe Watch Camera from 1894 allowed the user to quickly pull out the device,\ntake a secret photograph, and return it to their pocket unseen.\n\nThis Le Physiographe camera from 1896 was patented in both Britain and France\nand was disguised as a pair of binoculars.\n\n(Photo credit: Bonhams / Daily Mail UK / Wikimedia Commons).\n\nUpdated on: April 14, 2024\n\nAny factual error or typo?
