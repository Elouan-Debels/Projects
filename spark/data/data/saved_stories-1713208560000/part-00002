But when will they return to Earth?\n\nImage credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/Jason Major via Flickr (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\n\nNASA is set to make an announcement today on the future of the Mars Sample\nReturn (MSR) project, which aims, as the name very much suggests, to return\nsamples of rocks and soil to Earth.\n\nPLAYTop Stories 01:12 Video Settings Full Screen About ConnatixV467626 Is\nThere A Limit ToHuman Life?\n\nRovers placed on the Red Planet have been tasked with collecting samples of\nit. During their time on an alien world, they have found plenty of interesting\nrocks and soil worthy of further human attention. Earlier this year, for\nexample, Perseverance collected samples of a rock which may be ideal for\nfinding signs of ancient microbial life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"To put it simply, this is the kind of rock we had hoped to find when we\ndecided to investigate Jezero Crater,\" Ken Farley, project scientist for\nPerseverance at Caltech, explained in a statement. \"Nearly all the minerals in\nthe rock we just sampled were made in water; on Earth, water-deposited\nminerals are often good at trapping and preserving ancient organic material\nand biosignatures. The rock can even tell us about Mars's climate conditions\nthat were present when it was formed.\"\n\nEarly analysis points to the rock being part of an ancient lake.\n\n### SPONSORED CONTENT\n\n  1.

Learn more\n\nBut as much as we can learn from Perseverance's onboard instruments, sample 24\nand others like it need to be returned to Earth to learn more about Mars's\nancient climate and geology and to search for signs of ancient life.\n\nReturning these samples is no simple task. Though humans have successfully\nlanded robots and probes on Mars (and even the occasional helicopter), we have\nnever lifted off from the surface of another planet before. As well as\nperforming this feat for the first time, the Mars Sample Return mission would\nthen see the sample rendezvous with a spacecraft that will bring the samples\nto Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you're thinking \"This sounds expensive\" you'd be in line with the views of\nthe Independent Review Board (IRB) report presented to NASA in September 2023.\nAccording to the report, the project was \"established with unrealistic budget\nand schedule expectations from the beginning\". While noting the scientific\nimportance of the mission, the review board said \"technical issues, risks, and\nperformance-to-date indicate a near zero probability\" of various aspects of\nthe mission being ready for launch by the current 2028 timeline.\n\n\u201cIndependent review boards like the one we commissioned for Mars Sample Return\nhelp review whether we\u2019re on the right track to meet our mission goals within\nthe appropriate budget,\u201d Sandra Connelly, NASA\u2019s deputy associate\nadministrator for science, said in a statement following the report's release.\n\u201cWe thank the board for its work, and now our job is to assess the report and\naddress if there are elements of the program that need to change.\u201d\n\nNASA has been working on an official response to the report, to be revealed\ntoday at 1 pm EDT, with NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Nicky Fox,\nassociate administrator, Science Mission Directorate set to speak at the\nupdate. NASA has not issued much more information on what that response will\nbe, but, as is the way of big space projects, brace yourself for possible\ndelays to the project, or changes in timelines to take place.\n\n### ARTICLE POSTED IN\n\nSpace and Physics\n\n  * nasa,\n\n  * Mars,\n\n  * Mars sample return\n\nFOLLOW ONNEWS\n\n## More Space and Physics Stories\n\nIf Life Exists On Jupiter\u2019s Moon Europa, Scientists Might Soon Be Able To\nDetect It\n\nAstronomy\n\n### If Life Exists On Jupiter\u2019s Moon Europa, Scientists Might Soon Be Able To\nDetect It\n\n2 days ago\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFirst Visualization Of A Quantum Electron Crystal Finally Proves They Exist\n\nphysics\n\n### First Visualization Of A Quantum Electron Crystal Finally Proves They\nExist\n\n2 days ago\n\n2\n\n190\n\nWhite Holes: Are They Black Holes' Destiny?\n\nphysics\n\n### White Holes: Are They Black Holes' Destiny?\n\n2 days ago\n\n17\n\n73\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### SPONSORED CONTENT\n\n  1.
