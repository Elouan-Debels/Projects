However,\nmany home workshops and office spaces have coils of hastily hidden extension\ncords and power strips that make for prime trip hazards, in addition to posing\nother safety concerns and just looking unsightly.\n\nWhen it comes to extension cord safety, wrapping your cables and putting them\nin the proper indoor storage spaces is a must. Not only does it remove\npotential trip hazards, it also forces you to check whether or not an\nextension cord is unplugged and whether it has nicks, frays, or other damage.\nUsing a damaged extension cord dramatically increases the risk of starting a\nfire, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nBeyond safety, the aesthetic impacts of property organized cords is like the\ncherry on-top. At the end of the day, learning how to roll up an extension\ncord by using one of the four methods outlined below is an easy way to make\nyour space cleaner, safer, and more enjoyable.\n\nRELATED: 11 Ways to Keep Your Electronics From Taking Over the Living Room\n\n## Braid Wrap\n\nPhoto: istockphoto.com\n\nAlso known as the contractor wrap or the chain-link wrap, the braid wrap is\noften the preferred method of construction and craft professionals because it\ndoesn\u2019t require any extra tools and it leaves the cord ready for use. You can\nunwrap it in sections, which means you don\u2019t have to go through the hassle of\nrolling the whole thing back up if you have an extra-long extension cord.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s a slight learning curve when it comes to the braid wrap, it\nis frequently the best way to roll up extension cords because it increases the\nlifespan of your cord and leaves the cord in an ideal position for storage,\nwhether that be sitting in a drawer, hanging on the wall, or tucked inside a\ncabinet. In short, the braid wrap is functional and versatile and makes it\nsafer to store, all while looking pretty fancy.\n\n### STEP 1: Plug the male end of the cord into the female end.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve removed any tangles and knots in the cord, one way to get the\nprocess started is by plugging the extension cord into itself. Doing this\nkeeps the prongs protected from any unwanted contact during the wrapping\nprocess or while in storage, which is especially important if you work in a\nshop with flammable materials. Plugging the pronged male end into the female\nend of the cord cuts the length in half, which is crucial for the next step in\nthe process.\n\n### STEP 2: Make a loose loop at the opposite end with an overhand knot.\n\nAfter you connect the two ends of the extension cord together, work your way\ntowards the end opposite the plugs, straightening the cord as you move along.\nOnce you get within 6 to 8 inches of the opposite end, grasp the cords\ntogether to create a small closed loop. Using your other hand, simply reach\nthrough the loop you just created, and pull both cords back through the loop\nat the same time.\n\n### STEP 3: Continually repeat the loop-and-grasp process.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve made your first loop, continue doing so back towards the end\nof the extension cord with the plugs. Each loop involves repeating the process\nfrom Step 2. Once you\u2019ve made the first loop-and-grasp movement, you should\nhave a second loop through which you can reach and pull the cords.\n\nMake sure that you keep your grasp at the base of the loop for each\nrepetition. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up with a loose braid that won\u2019t hold its\nintegrity. Once you\u2019ve looped your way back to within 1 foot of the male and\nfemale plugs, stop making new braids.\n\n### STEP 4: Slip the joined male and female plugs back through the last braid.\n\nThis is the last step before you get a fully braided extension cord. Simply\ntake both plugs in one hand and the base of the final braid in the other, and\npull the plugs backwards, through the loop of the final braid. Finally, pull\nthe plugs in the reverse direction to tighten the entire braid. Make sure that\nyou don\u2019t accidently pull them back through the braid you just pushed them\nthrough during the tightening process.\n\n## Elbow Wrap\n\nPhoto: istockphoto.com\n\nThe elbow wrap is the quick-and-dirty method of keeping your extension cords\nand cables organized. However, that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad way to manage\ncords. While the elbow wrap method doesn\u2019t have the structural durability of\nthe braid or over-under loops, it\u2019s the fastest method of the three manual\noptions. It\u2019s also the easiest to learn. Make sure you don\u2019t tighten it too\nmuch when you use the elbow wrap method to avoid forcing new defects into the\ncord by accident.\n\n### STEP 1: Hold one end of the cord in the crook between your thumb and\nforefinger.\n\nFirst, you need to get a good grip on one end of the extension cord. Pinch the\ncord in the crook of your thumb and forefinger and pull it back until the plug\nis lightly pushing against your fingers, which will act as a \u201cwall\u201d for the\nplug to rest against. This will keep the plug from slipping in the process,\nwhich also lets you roll up the cord faster.\n\n### STEP 2: Begin wrapping the cord around your elbow and back between your\nfingers.\n\nAfter having a firm hand on the cord, it\u2019s time to wrap the cord. Following\nthe path between thumb and forefinger, continue to loosely wrap the extension\ncord between your thumb and forefinger until you reach the end of the cord.\n\n### STEP 3: Connect the male and female ends.\n\nThe final step of the elbow wrap is to wrap the remaining foot or so of both\nplug ends around the middle of the wrap, perpendicular to the direction of the\nwrap. Then, pull them away from each other so the middle of the wrap becomes\ntight. Finally, connect the male and female ends together before storing.\n\nRELATED: 11 Cable Types Every Homeowner Should Know\n\n## Over-Under Wrap\n\nPhoto: istockphoto.com\n\nThe over-under method is an intuitive and popular way to coil extension cord\nthat strikes a good balance between the convenience of a simple elbow wrap and\nthe longevity and durability of the braid wrap. For many, this is the best way\nto wrap extension cords because it doesn\u2019t have a steep learning curve, and\ncan easily be enhanced by simply adding inexpensive velcro cable ties like\nthis highly rated option available at Amazon or a variety of other affordable\ncable management accessories.\n\n### STEP 1: Make a single overhand loop at either end of the cable.\n\nIf this is your first foray into the over-under wrap, you might want to lay\nyour extension cord out on a flat surface to make the process a bit easier.\nWithin a few practice rounds you\u2019ll be able to do it freehand without a\nproblem. Another tip you want to consider if your extension cord is new and\nrelatively stiff is to try laying your cord in the sun or a warm space to get\nit to relax a bit.\n\nRegardless of whether you take it in your hand or do it on a table, the first\nstep involves making a circle by curving the end of the cable back onto itself\nand then holding the overlap. Either clockwise or counterclockwise is fine.\n\n### STEP 2: Flip the cable\u2019s orientation to create a second underhand loop.\n\nRepeat the same process as the first, but make an underhand loop this time.\nThis pattern of repetition is the origin of the name \u201cover-under wrap.\u201d To\nmake the underhand loop, grasp the cable at the end of the first overhand loop\nin one hand, and use the other hand to grasp the cord behind the first hand\nand then gently roll it forward under the first hand to create the loop.\n\n### STEP 3: Continue alternating between overhand and underhand loops until\nyou reach the end of the cord.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve created the first set of over- and under-hand loops, you\u2019ll\nprobably notice that it doesn\u2019t take too long to get used to the twisting\nmotion used in the underhand loop. Thankfully, extension cords are designed in\na way that naturally accepts this method of wrapping, which makes it fairly\neasy to tell if you\u2019re making the under-handed loops properly. By the time you\nreach the end of the cord, you can finish it off by plugging the male and\nfemale ends into each other or by securing them with a tie.\n\n## Extension Cord Reel\n\nPhoto: istockphoto.com\n\nAlthough reels can be costly, and they can cause more hassles than solutions\nif poorly made, there are some that standout from the crowd in terms of\ndurability and functionality. When done right, using an extension cord reel\ncan save even more time than standard manual coiling methods.\n\nReels are best suited for heavy-duty extension cords that are longer than 50\nfeet, because these are a pain to manage and they become increasingly\ndifficult to control as you become naturally fatigued when trying to wrap\nthem. Furthermore, if you regularly use and transport extension cords, you may\nwant to consider a reel with high-tech features such as auto-retraction or\nbuilt-in USB ports for jobsite charging. Keep in mind that these features may\ncompromise the reel\u2019s outdoor versatility, however.\n\nOur Recommendation: Masterplug Power At Work on Amazon for $133.49 This\nMasterplug extension cord reel comes with a 100-foot-long cord and four\noutlets that are grounded to the reel for powering tools on the jobsite.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nOnce you know how to wrap extension cords, you\u2019ll be able to keep them in\nworking condition for longer as well as keep your workspace safer and less\ncluttered. The benefits are abundant and the drawback is that it takes just a\nlittle bit of time.\n\nIf you\u2019re an infrequent DIYer who rarely uses an extension cord or cable, it\u2019s\nlikely not worth the time to learn how to do the braid wrap, nor is it worth\nyour money for a reel. The over-under and elbow wrap methods are often the\neasiest, and are suitable for most users. If you regularly transport your\nextension cords, we recommend using the braid wrap because it\u2019s the most\nstable. Lastly, if your cords are longer than 50 feet or heavy duty, consider\ngetting a reel that minimizes the effort needed to keep those cords coiled.\n\nRELATED: 8 Genius Ways to Hide Every Wire in Your Home\n\nThe prices listed here are accurate as of publication on October 20, 2022.\n\n##### Share\n\n  * Interior\n\n## Will Briskin\n\nWill Briskin devotes his writing work to all things related to woodworking,\ndesign, and furniture.
