Every chat message you send in a\npublic channel can be accessed by anyone, regardless of the timeline. As a\nDiscord user, I tend to forget that this option exists, especially when it\ncomes to searching for individual users\u2019 chat histories.\n\nA new service called Spy.pet is taking full advantage of it without allowing\nusers to opt out. Officially launched in October 2023, the platform offers\nusers to \u201cExplore Discord\u2019s data with over 300 million users and still\ngrowing.\u201d.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the homepage of Spy.pet says that it\ntracks over 14,000 servers, has a history of more than 627 million users, and\nhas nearly 4 billion logged messages in its archive. When trying to visit the\nwebsite\u2019s Request Removal page, it redirects to a video of the infamous Jonah\nJameson\u2019s \u201cAre you serious?\u201d scene from Spider-Man. It\u2019s a well-known meme.\n\nThe website\u2019s pricing page offers only cryptocurrencies as a credit purchase\noption. Furthermore, the page provides an \u201cEnterprise\u201d package, described as,\n\u201cInterested in training an AI model with Discord messages? Are you a group of\nfederal agents looking for a new source of intel? Or maybe something else?\u201c.\n\nAll of this points to a simple conclusion: the platform\u2019s owner doesn\u2019t care\nwhat Discord or anyone else has to say. They\u2019re out to make money, and having\nyour Discord chat history removed from the platform isn\u2019t an option.\n\n## An example of the data Spy.pet provides\n\nI do not own cryptocurrencies, so signing up for credits isn\u2019t something I am\nlooking to pursue. If you are reading this and you want to dig deeper into\nyour Discord history using this platform, consider emailing me with your\nresults, and I will add them to this article.\n\nThe only example I could find personally was through this LowEndTalk forum\npost, which discusses a security breach on a hosting website. The discussion\neventually led to someone needing to use Spy.pet to find a specific user\u2019s\nhistory, and they also shared the public URL!\n\n    \n    \n    https://ws.spy.pet/exports/0e5815afb68386a9978a7f7956c9e38b.csv\n\nThe URL is archived in the Wayback Machine also.\n\nThe data inside the CSV file (which is hosted on Spy.pet\u2019s servers) looks like\nthis:\n\nOn its homepage, the owner of Spy.pet has provided a screenshot of the user\ninterface for the platform\u2019s dashboard. It tells us a little more,\n\nThe platform\u2019s users can see Connected Accounts for any given Discord user,\nand that same screenshot also includes a preview of individual chat history,\nmessages, and the channels in which those messages were posted.\n\nThe site has a blog that can be found on the Telegram channel. The blog only\nhas one post (the owner is slacking, he said he\u2019d do a monthly update!), but\nit reveals a few details, namely:\n\n  * The site has already been DDoS\u2019d by someone, \u201cThe main change this month is Spy.pet getting attacked by certain individuals who really don\u2019t want their messages archived. The first DDoS attack was on the 2nd of February, and it SUCKED.\u201d\n  * The site was banned by Coinbase Commerce, \u201cOn a date unknown to me, my account at Coinbase Commerce was locked. I\u2019m assuming this had either something to do with the same certain individuals complaining to Coinbase, or Coinbase somehow getting mad about the funds customers send.\u201d\n\nThe situation with the platform raises numerous ethical and legal concerns,\nechoing issues we\u2019ve seen with similar platforms in the past like dis.cool.\nThe core of the problem revolves around privacy invasion and data misuse.\n\n## Legal and ethical concerns\n\nSpy.pet\u2019s method of operation involves using bots to infiltrate Discord\nservers and scrape information without the consent of the server owners or its\nmembers. This includes collecting messages and lists of server members.\n\nUnder the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to all\nentities handling the data of EU residents, there are strict guidelines about\ndata collection, consent, and the right to erasure (\u201cthe right to be\nforgotten\u201d).\n\nHere are the relevant violations:\n\n  * Article 6 of GDPR: Legitimacy of processing personal data hinges on consent or necessity. Spy.pet\u2019s data scraping without user consent directly contravenes this requirement.\n  * Article 17 of GDPR: This article provides the right for individuals to have their personal data erased on request. The website\u2019s flippant handling of removal requests with a redirect to a meme shows not only a disregard for this law but also a disrespect for individual\u2019s privacy concerns.\n  * Article 8 of GDPR: Concerns the conditions for the consent of children regarding information society services. Discord users can be as young as 13, and storing data of minors without parental consent further complicates the legal standing of spy.pet.\n\nBeyond legality, there\u2019s an ethical dimension to consider. The indiscriminate\ncollection and monetization of personal data can lead to real harm, affecting\npeople\u2019s social lives, personal relationships, and even their mental health.\nThe ethical principle of respect for persons\u2014which includes respecting their\nautonomy and privacy\u2014is clearly being violated here.\n\nThe information collected and sold can be used for purposes ranging from\nharmless to deeply malicious, including harassment, stalking, or commercial\nexploitation without the consent or knowledge of the individuals involved.\n\nThe response to such violations is to report the activity to the relevant data\nprotection authorities, in this case, the GDPR enforcement bodies. Another\noption is to contact the website\u2019s host provider to report abuse.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to Discord to ask what they think about this and whether they\nhave a way of shutting this website down. Once I have an answer, I will add it\nbelow.\n\nbyAlex Ivanovs\n\nUpdated April 16, 2024\n\n## Read more\n\n### The Best Web Browsers for Privacy and Security\n\n### Top 5 Tools to Scan for Open Ports and Secure Your Network\n\n### 8 Best Software for Password Cracking\n\n### 8 Best Tools for Cryptography and Encryption\n\n### The data of 760,000 Discord.io users was put up for sale on the darknet\n\n### The 10 Best Password Managers for Businesses\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise\n  * Disclosure\n  * Write for Us\n  * Contact\n\n\u00a9 2024 Stack Diary.
