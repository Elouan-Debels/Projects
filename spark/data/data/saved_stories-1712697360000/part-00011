Planning for JWST began over 25 years ago, and\nconstruction efforts spanned over a decade. It was launched into space on Dec.\n25, 2021, and within a month arrived at its final destination: 930,000 miles\naway from Earth. Its location in space allows it a relatively unobstructed\nview of the universe.\n\nThe telescope design was a global effort, led by NASA and intended to push the\nboundaries of astronomical observation with revolutionary engineering. Its\nmirror is massive \u2013 about 21 feet (6.5 meters) in diameter. That\u2019s nearly\nthree times the size of the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched in 1990 and\nis still working today.\n\nIt\u2019s a telescope\u2019s mirror that allows it to collect light. JWST\u2019s is so big\nthat it can \u201csee\u201d the faintest and farthest galaxies and stars in the\nuniverse. Its state-of-the-art instruments can reveal information about the\ncomposition, temperature and motion of these distant cosmic objects.\n\nAs an astrophysicist, I\u2019m continually looking back in time to see what stars,\ngalaxies and supermassive black holes looked like when their light began its\njourney toward Earth, and I\u2019m using that information to better understand\ntheir growth and evolution. For me, and for thousands of space scientists, the\nJames Webb Space Telescope is a window to that unknown universe.\n\nJust how far back can JWST peer into the cosmos and into the past? About 13.5\nbillion years.\n\nThis illustration of the front view of the James Webb Space Telescope shows\nits sun shield and golden mirrors. NASA/ESA/CSA/Northrop Grumman\n\n## Time travel\n\nA telescope does not show stars, galaxies and exoplanets as they are right\nnow. Instead, astronomers are catching a glimpse of how they were in the past.\nIt takes time for light to travel across space and reach our telescopes. In\nessence, that means a look into space is also a trip back in time.\n\nThis is even true for objects that are quite close to us. The light you see\nfrom the Sun left it about 8 minutes, 20 seconds earlier. That\u2019s how long it\ntakes for the Sun\u2019s light to travel to Earth.\n\nYou can easily do the math on this. All light \u2013 whether sunlight, a flashlight\nor a light bulb in your house \u2013 travels at 186,000 miles (almost 300,000\nkilometers) per second. That\u2019s just over 11 million miles (about 18 million\nkilometers) per minute. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million\nkilometers) from Earth. That comes out to about 8 minutes, 20 seconds.\n\nBut the farther away something is, the longer its light takes to reach us.\nThat\u2019s why the light we see from Proxima Centauri, the closest star to us\naside from our Sun, is 4 years old; that is, it\u2019s about 25 trillion miles\n(approximately 40 trillion kilometers) away from Earth, so that light takes\njust over four years to reach us. Or, as scientists like to say, four light\nyears.\n\nMost recently, JWST observed Earendel, one of the farthest stars ever\ndetected. The light that JWST sees from Earendel is about 12.9 billion years\nold.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is looking much farther back in time than\npreviously possible with other telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.\nFor example, although Hubble can see objects 60,000 times fainter than the\nhuman eye is able, the JWST can see objects almost nine times fainter than\neven Hubble can.\n\n## The Big Bang\n\nBut is it possible to see back to the beginning of time?\n\nThe Big Bang is a term used to define the beginning of our universe as we know\nit. Scientists believe it occurred about 13.8 billion years ago. It is the\nmost widely accepted theory among physicists to explain the history of our\nuniverse.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope can see back 13.5 billion years \u2013 back to when\nthe first stars and galaxies began to form. STScI\n\nThe name is a bit misleading, however, because it suggests that some sort of\nexplosion, like fireworks, created the universe. The Big Bang more closely\nrepresents the appearance of rapidly expanding space everywhere in the\nuniverse. The environment immediately after the Big Bang was similar to a\ncosmic fog that covered the universe, making it hard for light to travel\nbeyond it. Eventually, galaxies, stars and planets started to grow.\n\nThat\u2019s why this era in the universe is called the \u201ccosmic dark ages.\u201d As the\nuniverse continued to expand, the cosmic fog began to rise, and light was\neventually able to travel freely through space. In fact, a few satellites have\nobserved the light left by the Big Bang, about 380,000 years after it\noccurred. These telescopes were built to detect the splotchy leftover glow\nfrom the Big Bang, whose light can be tracked in the microwave band.\n\nHowever, even 380,000 years after the Big Bang, there were no stars and\ngalaxies. The universe was still a very dark place. The cosmic dark ages\nwouldn\u2019t end until a few hundred million years later, when the first stars and\ngalaxies began to form.\n\nThis is a JWST image of NGC 604, a star-forming region about 2.7 million light\nyears from Earth. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was not designed to observe as far back as the\nBig Bang, but instead to see the period when the first objects in the universe\nbegan to form and emit light. Before this time period, there is little light\nfor the James Webb Space Telescope to observe, given the conditions of the\nearly universe and the lack of galaxies and stars.\n\nPeering back to the time period close to the Big Bang is not simply a matter\nof having a larger mirror \u2013 astronomers have already done it using other\nsatellites that observe microwave emission from very soon after the Big Bang.\nSo, the James Webb Space Telescope observing the universe a few hundred\nmillion years after the Big Bang isn\u2019t a limitation of the telescope. Rather,\nthat\u2019s actually the telescope\u2019s mission. It\u2019s a reflection of where in the\nuniverse we expect the first light from stars and galaxies to emerge.\n\nBy studying ancient galaxies, scientists hope to understand the unique\nconditions of the early universe and gain insight into the processes that\nhelped them flourish. That includes the evolution of supermassive black holes,\nthe life cycle of stars, and what exoplanets \u2013 worlds beyond our solar system\n\u2013 are made of.\n\n### Article written by Adi Foord, Assistant Professor of Astronomy and\nAstrophysics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.

He would take a large magnifying glass, fly out at\nsuperspeed, to the edge of the universe, and catch the light rays as they were\ncoming at him....thus be able to see history. I\u2019m not sure how he managed to\ncatalog what light rays show what from what century but he did. Quite an\namazing guy. He could also reverse the earths rotation and alter time.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n1 Comment\n\n## Latest News\n\n## Non-Medical Cannabis Use Linked To Dramatically Lower Cognitive Decline\nRisk In Adults Over 45\n\nAdd a comment\n\n## Brazilian Frogs Unleash Ear-Piercing Ultrasonic Screams To Deter Predators,\nStudy Finds\n\nAdd a comment\n\n## The Shocking Amount Of Plastic Waste On Ocean Floor Revealed\n\nAdd a comment\n\n## Alarming Study Offers Warning For iPhone, Mac Users: Hidden Privacy Dangers\nFound Lurking In Apple\u2019s Default Apps\n\nAdd a comment\n\nStudy Finds\n\n  * Our Story\n  * Mission & Standards\n  * Editorial Team & Contributors\n  * Who\u2019s Mentioned Us\n  * Best Of The Best\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact\n\n\u00a9 2024 41 Pushups, LLC\n\n", "frontpage": false}
