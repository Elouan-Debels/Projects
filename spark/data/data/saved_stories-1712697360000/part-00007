From this perspective, we develop a formal machine model for\n> consciousness. The model is inspired by Alan Turing's simple yet powerful\n> model of computation and Bernard Baars' theater model of consciousness.\n> Though extremely simple, the model aligns at a high level with many of the\n> major scientific theories of human and animal consciousness, supporting our\n> claim that machine consciousness is inevitable.\n\nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nMSC classes:| 68T01  \nACM classes:| F.1; I.2  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.17101 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2403.17101v1 [cs.AI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.17101arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Lenore Blum [view email] [v1] Mon, 25 Mar 2024 18:38:54 UTC (1,010 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled AI Consciousness is Inevitable: A Theoretical\nComputer Science Perspective, by Lenore Blum and Manuel Blum\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2403\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
