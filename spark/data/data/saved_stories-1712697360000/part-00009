The vulnerability came to light two weeks ago. The researcher said\nthey were making the threat public because D-Link said it had no plans to\npatch the vulnerabilities, which are present only in end-of-life devices,\nmeaning they are no longer supported by the manufacturer.\n\n## An ideal recipe\n\nOn Monday, researchers said their sensors began detecting active attempts to\nexploit the vulnerabilities starting over the weekend. Greynoise, one of the\norganizations reporting the in-the-wild exploitation, said in an email that\nthe activity began around 02:17 UTC on Sunday. The attacks attempted to\ndownload and install one of several pieces of malware on vulnerable devices\ndepending on their specific hardware profile. One such piece of malware is\nflagged under various names by 40 endpoint protection services.\n\nSecurity organization Shadowserver has also reported seeing scanning or\nexploits from multiple IP addresses but didn\u2019t provide additional details.\n\nThe vulnerability pair, found in the nas_sharing.cgi programming interface of\nthe vulnerable devices, provide an ideal recipe for remote takeover. The\nfirst, tracked as CVE-2024-3272 and carrying a severity rating of 9.8 out of\n10, is a backdoor account enabled by credentials hardcoded into the firmware.\nThe second is a command-injection flaw tracked as CVE-2024-3273 and has a\nseverity rating of 7.3. It can be remotely activated with a simple HTTP GET\nrequest.\n\nNetsecfish, the researcher who disclosed the vulnerabilities, demonstrated how\na hacker could remotely commandeer vulnerable devices by sending a simple set\nof HTTP requests to them. The code looks like this:\n\n    \n    \n    GET /cgi-bin/nas_sharing.cgiuser=messagebus&passwd=&cmd=15&system=<BASE64_ENCODED_COMMAND_TO_BE_EXECUTED>\n\nIn the exploit example below, the text inside the first red rectangle contains\nthe hardcoded credentials\u2014username messagebus and an empty password\nfield\u2014while the next rectangle contains a malicious command string that has\nbeen base64 encoded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge\n\nnetsecfish\n\n\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to\nexecute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to unauthorized\naccess to sensitive information, modification of system configurations, or\ndenial of service conditions,\u201d netsecfish wrote.\n\nLast week, D-Link published an advisory. D-Link confirmed the list of affected\ndevices:\n\nModel| Region| Hardware Revision| End of Service Life| Fixed Firmware|\nConclusion| Last Updated  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nDNS-320L| All Regions| All H/W Revisions| 05/31/2020 : Link| Not Available|\nRetire & Replace Device| 04/01/2024  \nDNS-325| All Regions| All H/W Revisions| 09/01/2017 : Link| Not Available|\nRetire & Replace Device| 04/01/2024  \nDNS-327L| All Regions| All H/W Revisions| 05/31/2020 : Link| Not Available|\nRetire & Replace Device| 04/01/2024  \nDNS-340L| All Regions| All H/W Revisions| 07/31/2019 : Link| Not Available|\nRetire & Replace Device| 04/01/2024  \n  \nAccording to netsecfish, Internet scans found roughly 92,000 devices that were\nvulnerable.\n\nEnlarge\n\nnetsecfish\n\nAccording to the Greynoise email, exploits company researchers are seeing look\nlike this:\n\n    \n    \n    GET /cgi-bin/nas_sharing.cgi?dbg=1&cmd=15&user=messagebus&passwd=&cmd=Y2QgL3RtcDsgcLnNo HTTP/1.1\n\nOther malware invoked in the exploit attempts include:\n\n  * skid.arm - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/44df31da4ce8f4e5a3f9141773d5491f3250de66aa528b6fc2d74ac6adeb2d13\n  * skid.arm5 - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ab8f295ab1c8c3ce66f8fbda39df4aa8bcbca27d3ddb51b4b18b076c7186a933\n  * skid.arm6 - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2b1d187f3b6c93569f62b48fc10b627feeffc2f497e1f14965d15b755a2073ae\n  * skid.arm7 - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/15f772d4c6ce512d7442760ae82f2d438bc8496680c950ecef8f56202441912d\n  * skid.mips - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1b1f226a2de6581606a6aa9249c9d89b9c771a14e02022371405396c278da62d\n  * skid.mpsl - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4ff0c418b636125fa295ea4467507db85e2ee19c38b1bf921e75fb3f217fae68\n  * skid.x86 - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/859e679f8e8be4a4c895139fb7fb1b177627bbe712e1ed4c316ec85008426db8\n\nThe best defense against these attacks and others like them is to replace\nhardware once it reaches end of life. Barring that, users of EoL devices\nshould at least ensure they\u2019re running the most recent firmware. D-Link\nprovides this dedicated support page for legacy devices for owners to locate\nthe latest available firmware. Another effective protection is to disable UPnP\nand connections from remote Internet addresses unless they\u2019re absolutely\nnecessary and configured correctly.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n53\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
