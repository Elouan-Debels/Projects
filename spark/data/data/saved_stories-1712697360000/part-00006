The underlying theory is straightforward. Children who are unwanted\nat birth are at risk of a range of adverse life outcomes and commit much more\ncrime later in life. Legalised abortion greatly reduced the number of unwanted\nbirths. Consequently, legalised abortion will reduce crime, albeit with\nsubstantial lags.\n\nOur paper created much controversy, which was further stoked by a chapter on\nthe topic in the best-selling book \u201cFreakonomics\u201d, written by one of us with\nStephen Dubner, published in 2005. For many, it was more important to spin a\npolitical response to our hypothesis than to evaluate whether it was correct.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
