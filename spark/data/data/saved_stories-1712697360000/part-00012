For example, only 22 percent of 2,000\nbusinesses have a formal incident response plan in place, which has\n\"astounded\" experts.\n\n\"Only a fraction of UK businesses have any kind of formalized incident\nresponse plan, which I find astounding,\" said Andy Kays, CEO at Socura.\n\"Businesses will always have a plan in case of a fire, but will not apply the\nsame due care for a data breach \u2013 which is statistically much more likely. It\nflies in the face of common sense.\"\n\nThe reporting of breaches to external authorities and organizations is also\nlow. Only 10 percent of businesses ring the police when they detect the most\ndisruptive breach in the previous 12 months \u2013 a stat that's halved when\nlooking at who reports incidents to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).\n\nReporting rates to arguably the most important entity, the Information\nCommissioner's Office (ICO), weren't even included in the report since the\nwatchdog didn't make the top ten organizations that receive reports of\nbreaches. Banks, building societies, and credit card issuers, on the other\nhand, placed first \u2013 32 percent of businesses reported incidents to them.\n\nClients and customers were only alerted 5 percent of the time.\n\nIn most cases (68 percent), organizations don't deem the incidents significant\nenough to report to anyone. Other excuses included not knowing where to report\nincidents (13 percent of businesses), thinking a report would make no\ndifference (9 percent), and incidents being too recent to allow time to report\n(4 percent).\n\nAs for the action taken, as many as 39 percent of businesses took no action\nfollowing their most disruptive breach in the previous 12 months. Most\ndefaulted to delivering more training to staff (23 percent), with a much\nsmaller proportion making any changes to firewalls (9 percent) or anti-malware\nsolutions (8 percent).\n\nSmall and micro businesses appear to be pulling the figures down considerably.\nOverall, 59 percent of businesses enacted some sort of organizational change\nfollowing a breach, but medium and large businesses were much more likely to\ntake action, with 74 and 86 percent of each respectively doing something to\nprevent further intrusions.\n\nBreaches that resulted in material outcomes for victims, such as the theft of\ndata, led to slightly different results. A greater diversity of measures were\nenacted by businesses and charities in this case, such as introducing new\nsecurity tools, but still, 18 percent of businesses did absolutely nothing in\nresponse, even after a material breach.\n\n\"In the event of a breach, businesses are not keeping records, not informing\nthe police or regulators, not assessing the scale and impact of the incident,\"\nsaid Kays.\n\n\"They are failing to do the bare minimum. It's also important to note that\nbusinesses are doing very little to prevent or detect breaches in the first\nplace.\"\n\nFigures from DSIT's survey also showed a general decrease in awareness of\nsecurity initiatives and willingness to seek support.\n\nJust 41 percent of businesses sought cybersecurity information from outside\ntheir organization over the previous 12 months \u2013 a decline from 49 percent the\nprevious year. It represents a steady, continued downward trend since the\nearly GDPR days when, naturally, the proportion of businesses seeking outside\nhelp was high at 59 percent.\n\nThe overall figures were largely driven by micro businesses, since only 39\npercent sought outside expertise compared to 70 percent of medium companies.\nThe figures for charities also stand at 39 percent but have remained largely\nunchanged since 2018, give or take a few percentage points each year.\n\nIT consultants appear to be favored heavily compared to the services provided\nby \"official sources\" such as the UK's NCSC, especially by medium businesses\nthat may not be able to hire their own internal talent.\n\n  * Puppies, kittens, data at risk after 'cyber incident' at veterinary giant\n  * Change Healthcare faces second ransomware dilemma weeks after ALPHV attack\n  * Google sues app devs, claims they're Play Store crypto scammers with 100k+ victims\n  * Ransomware gang did steal residents' confidential data, UK city council admits\n\nOnly 1 percent of businesses and 2 percent of charities mentioned the NCSC by\nname when searching for security guidance, down from 2 percent each last year,\nsuggesting the costly alternatives make a more convincing business case.\n\nAwareness of the information campaigns run by the NCSC has also been in\ncontinued decline for the past two to three years, according to today's\nsurvey.\n\nCyber Aware, the general online safety advice book from the NCSC, plus the 10\nSteps to Cyber Security guide and its Cyber Essentials assessment are all\ngradually falling off businesses' radars, although the drop is only slight\nfrom last year. The multi-year downward trend may give cause for concern,\nhowever.\n\n\"The decline in awareness for Cyber Aware since 2022 is driven by a decline\namong micro and small business,\" the survey reads. \"There was a significant\ndecline in awareness for Cyber Aware among micro businesses since 2021 from 34\npercent to 24 percent in 2024 and a similar, and significant, decline among\nsmall business since 2021 from 38 percent to 28 percent in 2024.\n\n\"Similarly, the decline in awareness seen for 10 Steps to Cyber Security is\ndriven by a decline in micro and small business, but to a lesser extent.\"\n\n### Cost of a UK breach\n\nAccording to DSIT's data, the average business that suffered any kind of\nsecurity breach took a financial hit of \u00a31,206 ($1,529). For medium and large\nbusinesses, this was predictably much higher than any micro and small\norganizations at \u00a310,830 ($13,731).\n\nThe median cost of these breaches, both in the short and long term, stands at\n\u00a30, though, which indicates that in the vast majority of cases, no material\noutcome is identified and no action needs to be taken.\n\nBut with incidents that do lead to material outcomes such as data theft, it\nbecomes much costlier \u2013 the average cost soared to \u00a36,940 ($8,799) with an\naverage high of \u00a340,400 ($51,221) for medium and large businesses. The costs\nwere fairly evenly split between short-term and long-term outlays for the\nlarger organizations, but those on the smaller side typically reported larger\nshort-term costs, such as those related to the engagement of outside experts\nor paying sums to attackers.\n\nLong-term costs refer more to things like replacing hardware or software,\nlegal fees, and hiring new talent.\n\n### Attacks targeting the UK\n\nIt's estimated that around 312,000 registered business in the UK were targeted\nby some flavor of cybercrime in the past year, and 27,000 registered charities\n\u2013 22 percent and 14 percent of the total respectively.\n\nIt may come as little surprise that phishing leads the way as the most common\ntype of cybercrime affecting UK businesses, with 90 percent of respondents\nsaying they had identified attempts in the past 12 months.\n\nLarge businesses were the biggest reporters of cybercrime attempts against\nthem at 58 percent, and they were also the primary targets of non-phishing\ncrimes such as unauthorized access attempts, malware, and ransomware.\n\nThey were \"significantly\" more likely to be targeted by cybercrime than\nsmaller businesses \u2013 a trend that's also true for charities. Those with an\nincome of more than \u00a3500,000 ($633,935) (37 percent) were more than twice as\nlikely to be targeted compared to the average (14 percent). \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * United Kingdom\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * Cabinet Office\n  * Competition and Markets Authority\n  * Computer Misuse Act\n  * DCMS\n  * ESA\n  * Five Eyes\n  * GCHQ\n  * HMRC\n  * Home Office\n  * ICO\n  * London\n  * NCSC\n  * NHS\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * RPA\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Scotland\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * Government\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * United Kingdom\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * Cabinet Office\n  * Competition and Markets Authority\n  * Computer Misuse Act\n  * DCMS\n  * ESA\n  * Five Eyes\n  * GCHQ\n  * HMRC\n  * Home Office\n  * ICO\n  * London\n  * NCSC\n  * NHS\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * RPA\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Scotland\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * Government\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### INC Ransom claims to be behind 'cyber incident' at UK city council\n\nThis follows attack on NHS services in Scotland last week\n\nCyber-crime7 days | 10\n\n#### Ransomware gang did steal residents' confidential data, UK city council\nadmits\n\nINC Ransom emerges as a growing threat as some ex-LockBit/ALPHV affiliates get\nnew gigs\n\nCyber-crime5 days | 17\n\n#### Security pioneer Ross Anderson dies at 67\n\nObituary A man with a list of accolades long enough for several lifetimes,\nfriends remember his brilliance\n\nResearch6 days | 33\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### AT&T admits massive 70M+ mid-March customer data dump is real though old\n\nStill claims the personal info wasn't stolen from its systems\n\nSecurity8 days | 11\n\n#### Change Healthcare faces second ransomware dilemma weeks after ALPHV\nattack\n\nTheories abound over who's truly responsible\n\nSecurity1 day | 14\n\n#### Puppies, kittens, data at risk after 'cyber incident' at veterinary giant\n\nIT systems pulled offline for chance to paws and reflect\n\nSecurity23 hrs | 8\n\n#### Ivanti commits to secure-by-design overhaul after vulnerability nightmare\n\nCEO addresses whirlwind start to 2024 and how it plans to prevent a repeat\n\nSecurity5 days | 19\n\n#### UK government sets sights on \u00a38B tech procurement overhaul\n\nMega framework set to replace earlier deals coming to an end next year\n\nPublic Sector6 days | 16\n\n#### Pandabuy confirms crooks nabbed data on 1.3M punters\n\nNothing says 'sorry' like 10 percent off shipping for a month\n\nCyber-crime7 days |\n\n#### INC Ransom claims responsibility for attack on NHS Scotland\n\nSensitive documents dumped on leak site amid claims of 3 TB of data stolen in\ntotal\n\nCyber-crime12 days | 14\n\n#### Street newspaper appears to have Big Issue with Qilin ransomware gang\n\nThe days of cybercriminals having something of a moral compass are over\n\nCyber-crime13 days | 12\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
