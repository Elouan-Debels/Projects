The materials, which are typically made of conducting carbon-\nbased polymers, can bend and fold, but they tend to degrade quickly compared\nto traditional electronics. These organic semiconductors are useful in bendy\nbiosensors and other consumer devices, including wearables, smart tags,\nelectronic textiles; however, they\u2019re expensive and difficult to manufacture,\nand they have significant environmental costs.\n\nResearchers at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University,\nboth in Stockholm, have found that mixing an organic semiconductor with a\npolystyrene\u2014the common, inexpensive plastic used for consumer products like\npacking peanuts, foam food packaging, and DVD cases\u2014improved the electrical\nperformance of the semiconductor while requiring only one sixth the amount of\norganic material.\n\nOrganic bioelectronics \u201coffer new possibilities, but today they\u2019re not so easy\nto make,\u201d says Anna Herland, associate professor at KTH Royal Institute of\nTechnology. \u201cRemarkably enough, when we put in that insulating material, we\ncreated a blend that performs better.\u201d Reducing the amount of semiconductor\nmaterial also makes the resulting electronic devices more sustainable. The\nresearchers published the findings on 3 March in Advanced Materials.\n\n## Replacing Semiconductor Material\n\nHigh quality organic materials used in bioelectronic devices, which are\ndesigned to conduct both ions and electrons, are currently synthesized in\ncomplex processes that involve several purification steps and toxic\nsubstances, says Erica Zeglio, assistant professor at Stockholm University.\n\nMeanwhile, polystyrene\u2014the plastic Zeglio and Herland added to the\nsemiconductors\u2014is commercially produced at large scales and a fraction of the\ncost. \u201cWe are moving toward new technology that can replace standard\nsemiconductors like silicon,\u201d says Zeglio.\n\nOrganic semiconductors also tend to have limited durability compared to\ntraditional electronics; over time, the devices degrade and the drain current\ndrops. The researchers decided to add an insulating material in an attempt to\naddress this issue, inspired by other researchers who had done so in a\ndifferent type of electronic device. They were initially skeptical it would\nwork, but found the blend of materials did improve stability. After 60 minutes\nof operation, the blended material retained 77 percent of the initial drain\ncurrent, compared to 12 percent for the pure semiconductor.\n\nBy mixing the semiconductor material\u2014labeled \u201cp(n-T)\u201d\u2014with an inexpensive\npolymer\u2014labeled \u201cPS\u201d\u2014the researchers avoid swelling that degrades the device\u2019s\nperformance.Benselfelt SciArt\n\nHerland hopes this finding may inspire other researchers to consider working\nwith new materials. \u201cThis method can allow them to try materials that they had\ndiscarded because they weren\u2019t stable enough,\u201d she says.\n\n## Improved Performance\n\nSurprisingly, diluting the semiconducting material with an insulator also\nresulted in electrical performance three times as good as that from an\nundiluted semiconductor. That performance is measured by a metric that takes\ninto account two factors: How fast electrons are conducted, and how many ions\ncan be stored in a given volume.\n\nUnlike many other transistors, which depend on the accumulation of charges on\nan interface, \u201cthis material has electronic and ionic transport properties\nthrough the bulk of the material,\u201d Herland says. \u201cHere, you play with the\nwhole volume.\u201d\n\nThe mechanism for the improvement is still unclear, though Herland says\nseveral factors could be at play. For instance, the blend of material could\nhelp avoid damaging changes in that material, or organize it in a way that\npromotes ion and electron movement. She hopes to gain a better understanding\nthrough future research.\n\nAdditionally, because organic materials are typically only available in small\nvolumes, the testing occurred on a small scale\u2014a common limitation in this\nfield of research, Herland says.\n\nThe research is a major advance for organic electrochemical transistors,\naccording to Antonio Facchetti, a professor at Georgia Institute of\nTechnology. Because these devices typically operate by moving ions through a\nhydrated medium, Facchetti would have suspected a hydrophilic material would\nbe a better choice. However, the researchers found that a hydrophobic polymer\nworked best. \u201cIt is very surprising these devices work at all,\u201d Facchetti\nsays. He also noted that the long-term durability of the material remains\nlimited.\n\nIn the future, the team hopes to find other routes to reduce the environmental\nimpact of the devices, such as in the synthesis process. \u201cWe are trying to\nmove toward sustainability from different directions,\u201d says Zeglio. That also\nincludes the application; the team is currently working to develop the\ntechnology for use in food waste sensors.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * The Plastic Processor \u203a\n  * Stacking Turns Organic Transistors Up \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Organic Semiconductor - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics \u203a\n  * Organic semiconductor - Wikipedia \u203a\n\nbiosensorssemiconductorsplasticorganic semiconductor\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nGwendolyn Rak\n\nis a contributor to IEEE Spectrum.
