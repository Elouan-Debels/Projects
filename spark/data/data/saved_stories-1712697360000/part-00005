Today, AI\ntools like Suno.ai allow any series of words to become song lyrics, including\ninside jokes (as you'll see below). On Wednesday, prompt engineer Riley\nGoodside tweeted an AI-generated song created with the prompt \"sad girl with\npiano performs the text of the MIT License,\" and it began to circulate widely\nin the AI community online.\n\nThe MIT License is a famous permissive software license created in the late\n1980s, frequently used in open source projects. \"My favorite part of this is\n~1:25 it nails 'WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY' with a beautiful Imogen Heap-\nstyle glissando then immediately pronounces 'FITNESS' as 'fistiff,'\" Goodside\nwrote on X.\n\nSuno (which means \"listen\" in Hindi) was formed in 2023 in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts. It's the brainchild of Michael Shulman, Georg Kucsko, Martin\nCamacho, and Keenan Freyberg, who formerly worked at companies like Meta and\nTikTok. Suno has already attracted big-name partners, such as Microsoft, which\nannounced the integration of an earlier version of the Suno engine into Bing\nChat last December. Today, Suno is on v3 of its model, which can create\ntemporally coherent two-minute songs in many different genres.\n\nThe company did not reply to our request for an interview by press time. In\nMarch, Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone wrote a profile about Suno that describes\nthe service as a collaboration between OpenAI's ChatGPT (for lyric writing)\nand Suno's music generation model, which some experts think has likely been\ntrained on recordings of copyrighted music without license or artist\npermission.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nBillie Eilish, Pearl Jam, 200 artists say AI poses existential threat to their\nlivelihoods\n\nIt's exactly this kind of service that upset over 200 musical artists enough\nlast week that they signed an Artist Rights Alliance open letter asking tech\ncompanies to stop using AI tools to generate music that could replace human\nartists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering the unknown provenance of the training data, ownership of the\ngenerated songs seems like a complicated question. Suno's FAQ says that music\ngenerated using its free tier remains owned by Suno and can only be used for\nnon-commercial purposes. Paying subscribers reportedly own generated songs\n\"while subscribed to Pro or Premier,\" subject to Suno\u2019s terms of service.\nHowever, the US Copyright Office took a stance last year that purely AI-\ngenerated visual art cannot be copyrighted, and while that standard has not\nyet been resolved for AI-generated music, it might eventually become official\nlegal policy as well.\n\n## The Moonshark song\n\nEnlarge / A screenshot of the Suno.ai website showing lyrics of an AI-\ngenerated \"Moonshark\" song.\n\nBenj Edwards\n\nWhile using the service, Suno appears to have no trouble creating unique\nlyrics based on your prompt (unless you supply your own) and sets those words\nto stylized genres of music it generates based on its training dataset. It\ndynamically generates vocals as well, although they include audible\naberrations. Suno's output is not indistinguishable from high-fidelity human-\ncreated music yet, but given the pace of progress we've seen, that bridge\ncould be crossed within the next year.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nUS judge: Art created solely by artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted\n\nTo get a sense of what Suno can do, we created an account on the site and\nprompted the AI engine to create songs about our mascot, Moonshark, and about\nbarbarians with CRTs, two inside jokes at Ars. What's interesting is that\nalthough the AI model aced the task of creating an original song for each\ntopic, both songs start with the same line, \"In the depths of the digital\ndomain.\" That's possibly an artifact of whatever hidden prompt Suno is using\nto instruct ChatGPT when writing the lyrics.\n\nSuno is arguably a fun toy to experiment with and doubtless a milestone in\ngenerative AI music tools. But it's also an achievement tainted by the\nunresolved ethical issues related to scraping musical work without the\nartist's permission. Then there's the issue of potentially replacing human\nmusicians, which has not been far from the minds of people sharing their own\nSuno results online. On Monday, AI influencer Ethan Mollick wrote, \"I\u2019ve had a\nsong from Suno AI stuck in my head all day. Grim milestone or good one?\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n98\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
