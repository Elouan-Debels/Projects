Dolan\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nin Cannabis\n\n(Photo credit: OpenAI's DALL\u00b7E)\n\nShare on TwitterShare on Facebook\n\nIn a new study published in Current Alzheimer Research, scientists have found\nthat non-medical cannabis use is linked to a lower likelihood of experiencing\nsubjective cognitive decline, a condition characterized by self-reported\nmemory loss or confusion. This intriguing discovery sheds light on the complex\nrelationship between cannabis use and cognitive health, particularly among\nmiddle-aged and older adults in the United States.\n\nWith the aging population and the rising prevalence of cognitive impairments,\nunderstanding the factors that can influence cognitive health is more crucial\nthan ever. Subjective cognitive decline has been recognized as a potential\nearly warning sign for more severe cognitive disorders, including dementia. At\nthe same time, cannabis use is becoming more common, especially among older\nadults, prompting scientists to explore its potential impacts on cognitive\nfunction.\n\n\u201cThere has been increasing attention about cannabis because more states\ncontinue to expand legalization, and subsequently more adults also have begun\nexperimenting with the substance,\u201d said study author Roger Wong, an assistant\nprofessor in the Norton College of Medicine at SUNY Upstate Medical\nUniversity.\n\n\u201cI had noticed that most research on cannabis was only focusing on how\nfrequency of cannabis use is associated with cognition. Thus, I expanded on\nprior research by examining how cognitive decline may result from different\nfacets of cannabis use, such as reason (medical or non-medical), frequency\n(0-30 days/month), and method (smoke, vape, eat, etc.).\u201d\n\nFor their study, the researchers analyzed data from the 2021 Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System (BRFSS), focusing on U.S. adults aged 45 and older.\nThe BRFSS is a cross-sectional survey designed to collect information on\nhealth-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of\npreventive services among American adults.\n\nSpecifically, this study zeroed in on respondents from Washington D.C. and 14\nstates that included the BRFSS cognitive decline module in their survey,\nresulting in an unweighted sample of 4,744 participants with valid responses\non subjective cognitive decline.\n\nSubjective cognitive decline, the study\u2019s dependent variable, was assessed\nusing a specific question from the BRFSS cognitive decline module: \u201cDuring the\npast 12 months, have you experienced confusion or memory loss that is\nhappening more often or is getting worse?\u201d\n\nIndividuals who used cannabis for non-medical reasons reported significantly\nreduced odds of experiencing subjective cognitive decline compared to those\nwho did not use cannabis. This suggests that non-medical cannabis use, as\nopposed to medical or mixed-use, might have a protective association against\nthe self-perception of cognitive decline.\n\nInterestingly, when examining the frequency of cannabis use and the methods of\nconsumption (smoking, eating, drinking, vaporizing, or dabbing), the study\nfound no significant association with subjective cognitive decline after\nadjusting for a comprehensive set of covariates. This finding indicates that\nthe reason behind cannabis use (medical vs. non-medical) may be more pivotal\nin its relationship with subjective cognitive health than the quantity of use\nor the specific method of consumption.\n\nFurther analysis through multiple logistic regression models highlighted that,\nafter controlling for various demographic, health, and substance use factors,\nnon-medical cannabis use was associated with a 96% decrease in the odds of\nreporting subjective cognitive decline. This relationship remained consistent\nacross different models, even after adjusting for a wide range of potential\nconfounders.\n\n\u201cNon-medical cannabis use, such as for recreational purposes, may decrease\ncognitive decline, which is often a precursor to future diagnosis of dementia,\nwhich currently has no definitive prevention approach, no cure, and very\nlimited treatment options,\u201d Wong told PsyPost.\n\nBut the study has some limitations to consider. It didn\u2019t account for\npotential geographical variations in cannabis legislation and use within the\nUnited States. The reliance on self-reported data, especially concerning\ncannabis use and cognitive decline, may introduce bias. Furthermore, the\nstudy\u2019s focus on adults 45 years and older leaves unanswered questions\nregarding the impact of cannabis on younger populations.\n\nLooking ahead, the researchers emphasize the need for further studies to\nexplore the mechanisms underlying the observed association between non-medical\ncannabis use and reduced odds of subjective cognitive decline.\n\n\u201cWe analyzed the U.S. CDC BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)\ndata, which has been collected annually since 1984,\u201d Wong explained. \u201cWe\nspecifically only analyzed the 2021 data since it contained the three cannabis\nmeasures. Thus, although our findings may suggest cannabis may be beneficial\nfor cognition, it is imperative for future research to examine the\nrelationship between long-term cannabis use and cognition. This is not\nfeasible right now because cannabis remains illegal federally.\n\n\u201cNon-medical cannabis typically contains higher concentrations of a compound\ncalled THC, whereas medical cannabis typically contains higher concentrations\nof a compound called CBD,\u201d the researcher added. \u201cIt is theorized that non-\nmedical cannabis is being used for stress relief and improve sleep, which my\nprior research has found sleep disturbances to be a major risk factor for\ndementia.\u201d\n\nThe study, \u201cAssociation Between Cannabis Use and Subjective Cognitive Decline:\nFindings from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS),\u201d was\nauthored by Zhi Chen and Roger Wong.\n\nTweetSendScanShareSendPin15ShareShareShare\n\n### RELATED\n\nCannabis\n\n### A psychedelic cannabinoid?
