Our bold movement to build CSS Grid Layout and enable\ndesigners to create responsive interfaces matching coding constructs was\nunexpected. The design tool space has changed forever.\n\nComponent Libraries have been revamped with a new data structure to help\ndesigners and large teams build extensive design systems more modularly. The\naddition of component swapping as well as more flexible categorisation options\nprovide a significant boost in productivity.\n\nWe rebuilt the entire Penpot\u2019s UI to be sleeker, faster and more beautiful.\nThis will be obvious to everyone that used Penpot in the past but equally\nmesmerising to newcomers. Streamlining user experience means allowing for more\ntime spent creating and collaborating at scale, which sits at the core of\nPenpot\u2019s mission.\n\nscreenshot-interaction1361\u00d7763 67.2 KB\n\nPenpot 2.0 showing an interactive prototype\n\nEach of these features, on its own, would have deserved a major release and\nyet we have another three major updates.\n\n  * You can now use images as a fill property.\n  * We added HTML generation on top of CSS and SVG.\n  * UI theming is now a reality, starting with Light & Dark.\n\nworkspace-light-dark1604\u00d71061 92.1 KB\n\nDark or Light themes, we love both!\n\nIf you want to know all the details of what comes packed with 2.0, including\nperformance improvements and 40+ changes not covered here, head to our Dev\nDiaries 1 page.\n\nIt took the team 9 months to build and ship this amazing release. We didn\u2019t\nwant to cut corners, we wanted to be proud of our work so you could team up\nand collaborate around design and code projects with no limitations or\ncompromises.\n\nWe are building our own path where concepts such as declarative design 3,\nfuture-proof ownership of your work and a no-handoff mindset meet long-\nstanding pragmatic design and coding practices.\n\nOur SaaS service at design.penpot.app 8 was the first to roll-out 2.0 a couple\nof days ago and self-host images 1 will follow very soon. We will always make\nsure that, no matter your choice, Penpot delivers the same experience.\n\nscreenshot-code1361\u00d7763 81.1 KB\n\nDesign-as-code is a reality with Penpot\n\n# What\u2019s next?\n\nDelivering Penpot 2.0 required the product team to act almost as a sole entity\nso interdependencies between new features would not create bottlenecks.\n\nPost 2.0 we are shifting to an \u201cinitiatives\u201d approach where smaller autonomous\nteams can ship upgrades independently. \u201cDesign tokens\u201d, \u201cPlugin architecture\u201d,\n\u201cAI\u201d or \u201cE2E testing framework\u201d are some of them.\n\nDo you want to know everything about Penpot 2.0 and what we\u2019re cooking up\nnext?

Penpot has surely come a long way. The team has done\namazing work! I\u2019m eager to really start using it, but I still feel like\nthere\u2019s one feature that\u2019s preventing me from doing so. Components really need\nstates/variants. I know that you have a story for that in the Components 2.0\nepic (Taiga 2), I just hope that it\u2019s prioritized for implementation sooner\nthan later.\n\nThank you all for all your hard work.\n\nmgregoire\n\n1h\n\nWell, I take back what I said about component states/variants. It looks like\nyour component system is quite unique in how it deals with variants. After\nwatching this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOGu1ke9fM4), I was\ncurious to see if what I was seeing in that tutorial, was really the case so I\ndecided to test something.\n\nAfter taking a deeper dive into the component system, it seems that variants\nare possible. It\u2019s a new way of thinking about components states/variants.\nMain components can be created from instances and then those new main\ncomponents can actually inherit from the instance\u2019s parent main component. So\ncomponent inheritance can be multi-tiered, which is pretty interesting and\nuseful as a solution for component variants. Now, in light of this, the only\nthing that is still needed is a some kind of hover solution for prototyping\n(unless it\u2019s there and I\u2019m missing it?).\n\n### Related Topics\n\nTopic| Replies| Views| Activity  \n---|---|---|---  \nPenpot\u2019s official launch brings developers and designers closer than\never!Events and Announcementsdesignreleaseaccesibilityceolive-streamsMay I say\nHappy Birthday! to everyone that was born on the 31st of January!
