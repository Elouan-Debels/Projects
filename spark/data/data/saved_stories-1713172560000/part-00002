It integrates file viewers for most of\nthe common file types, as well as an audio/video player. Furthermore, the\nvirtual cosmos contains a chess game, a netwalk game, a 3D mines game, a\nmulti-function clock, a stock watchlist, some fractals, and a Linux kernel\nconfigurator in form of a kernel patch.An autoplay function allows to show or\nplay things one ofter the other (e.g. slideshow of picture files or document\npages, playing of multiple audio or video files).The core of Eagle Mode\nsupports fast anti-aliased graphics, virtually unlimited depth of zooming,\nextensive mouse and keyboard control, animated navigation with kinetic effects\n(inertia, friction, and magnetism), popup-zoomed control views, editable\nbookmarks, in-place help texts, and working with multiple windows.Eagle Mode\nis distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3.Latest version\nis 0.96.1Videos Screenshots Download\n\n## How useful is it?\n\nEagle Mode is surely at least a nice ZUI demo and fun application. But it can\nbe more. For me, the developer, it is naturally the most efficient file\nmanager in the world. Some users also reported great satisfaction. If you want\nto find out whether Eagle Mode could improve your life too, then be aware that\nthe user interface is quite different and may be hard to learn by try and\nerror. Better read the user documentation and the in-button help texts. Also,\nyou may have to practice all the mouse functions for some time, before getting\nfast.\n\n## How stable and safe is it?\n\nEach new release is well tested, and it is verified by a careful review of\nevery new source code line. Some certain external libraries are only accessed\nthrough multiprocessing in a way that the stability of Eagle Mode as a whole\ndoes not depend on the stability of those libraries. None of the file manager\ncommand buttons changes the file system without popping up a window that asks\nsomething, but there is no undo function and no trash can. Archive files are\nnot unpacked if they seem to contain absolute or up-going paths.\n\n## Why does it still have a 0.x version number?\n\nI think, the plugin applications largely have 1.x state. It is the application\nprogramming interface (C++ API), which still requires some final work before\nEagle Mode may be versioned 1.0. This should not keep anyone from already\nusing the API, because serious source incompatibilities are really not to be\nexpected.\n\n## You want an industrial innovation?\n\nThe Eagle Mode C++ API could be used to develop human machine interfaces\n(HMIs), or control stations, or similar industrial applications, as zoomable\nuser interfaces (ZUIs). If it is well done, a ZUI in that area could be very\nintuitive and logical to use, and it could surely improve and accelerate the\nwork significantly (read here why). Besides, the API would allow to make the\nproduct pretty well-structured, efficient and portable. If any company likes\nto take that chance, I may be able to help - contact me.\n\n## Some positive feedback from users\n\n\"Great project. Rather useful and cute.\"\"Man, after only five seconds of use,\nEagle Mode has grown on me. Really. It's brilliant, works extremely well, and\nlooks nicer than I expected too.\"\"Wow, this is really awesome man. It's a\nbrilliant idea. In fact this is probably the coolest program I've ever\nused.\"\"It's a really nice project! Congratulation for the idea and the\nimplementation, it's very well done.\"\"I was expecting an eye-candy dominated\nresource hog, so the sleek design and efficient implementation were a pleasant\nsurprise. Good work!\"\"Only say that is a great thing this ZUI.. I need to\nfamiliarize a little with it but I've found a very very exciting and creative\nway to work with files.\"\"I'm using eaglemode to re-organise a large archive of\nfiles. It's awesome being able to fly over a directory of files and see at a\nglance if there's anything there worth keeping, instead of the bazillions of\nmouse-clicks I'd have to do in nautilus or konqueror to achieve the same\nthing.\"\"You know what? I quit Eagle Mode and went to navigate to the build dir\nusing Finder and the shortcuts in my dock, as I'm used to doing. I gave up and\nstarted Eagle Mode to do it instead, because it's just so much quicker and\neasier. I've been thinking Finder was a leap ahead of the command line I used\nfor 13 years, especially so because Finder lets you drag and drop files &\nfolders to file selectors or even to the terminal (it pastes the full file\npath), but Eagle Mode is another leap ahead again.\" (Finder is the file\nmanager of Apple Mac OS-X)Most of these statements are from the forums, where\nyou could add your own feedback too.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
