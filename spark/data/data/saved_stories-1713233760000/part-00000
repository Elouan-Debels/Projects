The big email services,\ngmail, yahoo, outlook and apple, are going to start tightening the thumbscrews\n(strict SPF, DMARK and DKIM, but also other stuff) on April 1 (bad timing,\nthat).\n\nI\u2019d vaguely seen that gmail was planning to block much more bulk mail to\nindividuals, but hadn\u2019t really thought about the consequences to normal email\nforwarding. (I blissfully no longer run a mail server and mailing lists.)\n\nSample notice:\n\n\"Can I continue to forward my email to my university address [which then\nforwards to my personal address]?\n\n\u201cThe short answer is no. The new security measures will block non-university\nemail forwarding from your university addresses, including emails from banks,\ndoctors, and other third parties. To continue receiving email from non-\nuniversity organizations, you must provide them with a personal email address\ninstead of forwarding to your @university.edu account. However, you will still\nbe able to receive emails from the university.\u201d\n\nThis is a common set up, so alumni and retirees can keep receiving mail to\ntheir university address, even though they no longer have accounts and can\u2019t\nsend from that address.\n\nIt\u2019s a good time to audit your email situation, especially if you currently\nforward mail to large provider controlled domains, or if you have any chains\nof forwards set up that you\u2019ve forgotten about.\n\nThe worst part is that it isn\u2019t going to help. Spammers have already started\nusing subdomain hijacking to get around most of the security restrictions:\n\nBleepingComputer\n\n### Hijacked subdomains of major brands used in massive spam campaign 9\n\nA massive ad fraud campaign named \"SubdoMailing\" is using over 8,000\nlegitimate internet domains and 13,000 subdomains to send up to five million\nemails per day to generate revenue through scams and malvertising.\n\n  * #### created\n\n18d\n\n  * #### last reply\n\n11d\n\n  * 12\n\n#### replies\n\n  * 1.0k\n\n#### views\n\n  * 8\n\n#### users\n\n  * 10\n\n#### likes\n\n  * 4\n\n2\n\n2\n\nDave Kdave1\n\n18d\n\ngastropod:\n\n> Spammers have already started using subdomain hijacking\n\nInteresting. But this doesn\u2019t sound like a real problem. It\u2019s like saying\nthieves are breaking into cars that are left unlocked. Lock the damn cars. DNS\nzone files are under the control of their holders, which controls the defined\nsubdomains and all MX records and DKIM and SPF keys. If people break into your\naccount and we find out you had no password, it\u2019s not newsworthy.\n\nDave Kdave1\n\n18d\n\ngastropod:\n\n> email forwarding is going to increasingly break\n\nAs for email server forwarding, I don\u2019t really like it. If X has a server\nforward to Y and you reply, they\u2019re typically going to get a reply from Y,\nwhich is not whom they emailed. Besides confusing the sender and wasting\ninternet bandwidth, I think it also confuses junk mail handlers that can no\nlonger tell if the sender is a trusted party.\n\nEmail aliasing is better, but only works for domains under the same control.\nAs an alternative, every mail client supports multiple accounts. Fetch them\nseparately. And then enjoy these clients like Apple Mail with a smart virtual\nunified inbox model that offers the simplicity of one stop shop but preserves\nthe value of discrete identities.\n\nIs there still a good use case for server forwarding? We do find it handy at\nwork for supporting legacy mailboxes. But in most cases it just enables our\nlaziness and we should be shutting them down. Like the olden days when you\nmoved to a new home and couldn\u2019t bring your phone number, you can apply a\nbounce message on the old account to get people to transition to a new one.\n\nTommy Weirtommy\n\n18d\n\nWe\u2019ve not been able to set forwarding addresses in our College email for the\npast while. We can on an individual email loaded into outlook but that\u2019s it.\n\nWe can\u2019t use anything other than outlook or Edge to access email and that\u2019s on\na college supplied laptop. You can interestingly use it on iOS after signing\naway some rights.\n\nQuite a few staff refuse to do that. Another number just treat the supplied\nlaptop as a desktop and leave it on their desk. Doesn\u2019t work for everyone\nthough, especially adjuncts.\n\nCan\u2019t copy and paste outside the College set of apps either.\n\nI miss forwarding, my email is now split across machines and applications.\nAntiproductive.\n\nDave Kdave1\n\n14d\n\nTommy Weir:\n\n> We can on an individual email loaded into outlook but that\u2019s it....\n>\n> We can\u2019t use anything other than outlook or Edge to access email and that\u2019s\n> on a college supplied laptop. You can interestingly use it on iOS after\n> signing away some rights\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to tell what technology is at play here. So let me focus:\n\n  1. Does the mailbox support IMAP access? Or POP3?\n\n  2. Are there IP restrictions blocking access from all but certain devices?\n\nTommy Weirtommy\n\n14d\n\nYou\u2019re thinking like an individual in control of this laptop.\n\nNothing to fix or sort, a managed device with services limited centrally.\n\nDavid LynchDavid_L\n\n13d\n\nFWIW I just sent myself something at my verizon.net address. It came through\nas usual, even though Verizon stopped providing email service years ago and\nstarted sending (forwarding?) everything sent to it to (in my case)\nicloud.com. Somehow (and I\u2019ve never been clear on how) it\u2019s worked reliably in\nboth directions so far; if it\u2019s now in peril I\u2019m going to have a lot of work\nto do correcting over a decade\u2019s worth of personal, commercial, and government\ncontact information.\n\nI have a hazy idea that aol.com did something similar a while back. Is it the\nsort of thing we\u2019re talking about?\n\nLarry RosenblumLarryR\n\n13d\n\nDave K:\n\n> And then enjoy these clients like Apple Mail with a smart virtual unified\n> inbox model that offers the simplicity of one stop shop but preserves the\n> value of discrete identities.\n\nThat\u2019s where Apple Mail, at least on iOS, fails miserably. If I\u2019m reading mail\nin my unified inbox, I sometimes want to know which of my email addresses it\nwas sent to. I tap my name in the To: field, get a link, and tap the link. It\nshows my contact card. Duh! I know who I am. Then I have to scroll down and\nlook for the tiny gray \u201cRecent\u201d next to the appropriate email address. I\nwouldn\u2019t even know what that \u201cRecent\u201d label meant except that I did some tests\nto find out. Worthless.\n\nDave Kdave1\n\n12d\n\nLarry Rosenblum:\n\n> If I\u2019m reading mail in my unified inbox, I sometimes want to know which of\n> my email addresses it was sent to.\n\nI don\u2019t use the unified inbox, because my workflow for how I handle emails is\nhighly dependent on which box I\u2019m reading. So it\u2019s a lot more streamlined for\nme to work through one box at a time, and I think that\u2019s a common use case.\n\nBut when I do look at the unified Inbox, the display I currently have shows\nthe nickname of the mailbox in gray in the preview area.\n\nimage946\u00d7272 24.6 KB\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t have that enabled?\n\nDoug Millerddmiller\n\n12d\n\nI have which account it was sent to on Mac mail, but would love to know how to\nenable that on iOS and iPadOS.\n\nTom Collinstomlogic\n\n11d\n\nLarry Rosenblum:\n\n> That\u2019s where Apple Mail, at least on iOS, fails miserably.

Worthless.\n\nOn my Mac, I\u2019ve added \u201cEnvelope-To\u201d and \u201cDelivered-To\u201d to the list of\ndisplayed headers for a message (Mail/Settings.../Viewing/Show Message\nHeaders). I have some aliases set up for my domain, so it\u2019s sometimes helpful\nto know how a message ended up in my inbox or direct delivery to a folder.\n\nCheck full headers on your email, since your server might use different\nfields.\n\nimage1056\u00d7316 48.7 KB\n\ngastropod\n\nDavid Lynch\n\n11d\n\n> \u201cFWIW I just sent myself something at my verizon.net address, It came\n> through as usual, even though Verizon stopped providing email service years\n> ago and started sending (forwarding?) everything sent to it to (in my case)\n> icloud.com\u201d\n\nPersonal mail should (probably, at least for now) still get forwarded\nnormally, unless you have corespondents that send out ~5000+ messages per day\nto a given service\u2013not to the same recipient, just the same service. But\ncommercial/organizational mail easily exceeds that limit and and now has to\nfollow much stricter rules. The two standard protocols that break forwarding\nare SPF and DMARK. Many sending and receiving servers have so far avoided\nbeing strict because forwarding is important.\n\nWhen forwarding, the original sender sends to ServiceOne. In processing the\nmessage, ServiceOne repackages the email to forward it to ServiceTwo. But the\nrepackaging breaks the SPF and DMARK information because the \u2018sender\u2019 is now\nServiceOne, not your bank, but the spf/dmark says that\u2019s a lie. ServiceTwo may\ndecide to bounce or drop the message due to that. Until now, even the big mail\nservices mostly delivered forwarded mail unless there were other suspicious\nindications. What\u2019s new is that the biggies are ramping up to require the\nstrictest possible SPF and DMARK.\n\nAnyone forwarding mail between servers, especially if some of that is from\ndefunct services that you can\u2019t log into anymore, really should do an audit to\nfigure out who\u2019s still sending mail to that account, and start changing those\naddresses beginning with important commercial mail, to a non-forwarded\naccount. Things may not break immediately, but the plan is to ramp thing up\nquickly (a couple of months, not a year), so procrastination is not a good\nidea.\n\nUniversities and some other organizations apparently got all of five days\nnotice of a stricter than originally advertised rule change. It\u2019s a problem,\nbecause at most universities, alumni and employees get to keep their email\naddress (but not a full account) when leaving, and a fairly high percentage\ntake advantage of it. Fortunately for me, I\u2019ve always preferred to keep things\nseparate. But I mostly couldn\u2019t convince users that they should too.\n\nMarquelle D. McKeanQuantumpanda\n\n11d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t assume that personal mail is going to be given a pass by everyone.\nLast year, Gmail started refusing messages sent from my personal domain to\nGmail addresses because I hadn\u2019t implemented SPF and DMARK yet (because I\ndidn\u2019t know I needed to). Fortunately, a quick help request to easyDNS sorted\nit out and got me set up, but it\u2019s clear that Google, at least, isn\u2019t\nintending to give anyone any leeway once this is all fully implemented.\n\nGmail has more personal email accounts than probably anybody else, and if not,\nthey\u2019re close to the top. And any domain that doesn\u2019t have SPF and DMARK set\nup correctly is going to get blocked from sending to any Gmail account. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter whether any other providers follow Google\u2019s lead here. This\nwill break legacy forwarding, simply because of Google\u2019s dominance in personal\nemail.\n\n(Side note: I can\u2019t thank Adam enough for first recommending easyDNS to\nTidBITS readers, way back when. Yes, they cost more than the basic domain\nregistrars/hosts, but their customer support is absolutely 200% worth every\npenny. I\u2019ve got three domains there right now, and will be adding more soon if\na venture I\u2019m developing right now goes anywhere.)\n\n### New & Unread Topics\n\nTopic| Replies| Views| Activity  \n---|---|---|---  \nKeeping two Macs in sync?TidBITS Talk| 1.0k| Jun 2023  \nMystery \u201cApple Inc\u201d extension wants approvalTidBITS Talk| 770| Jul 2023  \nLooking for a simple HTML editor with WYSIWYGTidBITS Talk| 504| Oct 2023  \nUSB-C extension cord suggestions?TidBITS Talk| 423| Oct 2023  \nOneMesh WiFi ExtenderTidBITS Talk| 615| Jun 2023  \n  \n### Want to read more?
