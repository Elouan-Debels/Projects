The\nresearchers from University of Copenhagen and Lund University suspect that\nthese marine worms may have a secretive language, which uses UV light only\nseen by their own species. The advanced vision of such a primitive creature\nhelps to finally settle an epic debate about the evolution of eyes.\n\nMarvelous eyes, but you be the judge of this sea critter\u2019s beauty. Vanadis is\na byname of the Norse goddess of love, Freya. Photo: Michael Bok\n\nThe Vanadis bristle worm has eyes as big as millstones \u2013 relatively speaking.\nIndeed, if our eyes were proportionally as big as the ones of this\nMediterranean marine worm, we would need a big sturdy wheelbarrow and brawny\narms to lug around the extra 100kg.\n\nAs a set, the worm's eyes weigh about twenty times as much as the rest of the\nanimal\u2019s head and seem grotesquely out of place on this tiny and transparent\nmarine critter. As if two giant, shiny red balloons have been strapped to its\nbody.\n\nFacts: The Worm\n\nThe Vanadis worm belongs to a family of large-eyed bristle worms, or\npolychaeta, found in many parts of the world.\n\nIts eyesight rivals that of rodents such as mice and rats. Vanadis' eyes weigh\nabout 20 times more than the rest of its head\n\nThe worms can see UV light and focus on relatively small objects, tracking\nthem as they move.\n\nIt is nocturnal. The researchers believe that these bristle worms use their\neyes to communicate for mating and hunting prey.\n\nVanadis bristle worms, also known as polychaetes, can be found around the\nItalian island of Ponza, just west of Naples. Like some of the island's\nsummertime partiers, the worms are nocturnal and out of sight when the sun is\nhigh in the sky. So what does this polychaete do with its walloping peepers\nafter dark? And what are they good for?\n\nNeuro- and marine biologist Anders Garm from the University of Copenhagen\u2019s\nDepartment of Biology couldn\u2019t ignore the question. Setting other plans aside,\nthe researcher felt compelled to dive in and try to find out. He was hooked as\nsoon as his colleague Michael Bok at Lund University showed him a recording of\nthe bristle worm.\n\n\"Together, we set out to unravel the mystery of why a nearly invisible,\ntransparent worm that feeds in the dead of night has evolved to acquire\nenormous eyes. As such, the first aim was to answer whether large eyes endow\nthe worm with good vision,\" says Michael Bok who together with Anders Garm,\nauthors a new research article that does just that.[LINK]\n\nIt turns out that the Vanadis\u2019 eyesight is excellent and advanced. Research\nhas demonstrated that this worm can use its eyes to see small objects and\ntrack their movements.\n\n\"It's really interesting because an ability like this is typically reserved\nfor us vertebrates, along with arthropods (insects, spiders, etc.) and\ncephalopods (octopus, squid). This is the first time that such an advanced and\ndetailed view has been demonstrated beyond these groups. In fact, our research\nhas shown that the worm has outstanding vision. Its eyesight is on a par with\nthat of mice or rats, despite being a relatively simple organism with a\nminiscule brain,\" says Garm.\n\nThis is what makes the worm's eyes and extraordinary vision unique in the\nanimal kingdom. And it was this combination of factors about the Vanadis\nbristle worm that really caught Anders Garm's attention. The researcher\u2019s work\nfocuses on understanding how otherwise simple nervous systems can have very\ncomplex functions \u2013 which was definitely the case here.\n\n## UV light and a secret language\n\nFor now, the researchers are trying to find out what caused the worm to\ndevelop such good eyesight. The worms are transparent, except for their eyes,\nwhich need to register light to function. So they can't be inherently\ntransparent. That means that they come with evolutionary trade-offs. As\nbecoming visible must have come at a cost to the Vanadis, something about the\nevolutionarily benefits of its eyes must outweigh the consequences.\n\nPhoto: Michael Bok\n\nPrecisely what the worms gain remains unclear, particularly because they are\nnocturnal animals that tuck away during the day, when eyes usually work best.\n\nFacts: Bioluminescence\n\nBioluminescence is when organisms are luminescent, i.e., capable of producing\nlight using their own power. This can be done chemically within the body, as\nwith glow-worms.\n\nShould the researchers succeed in documenting it, the Vanadis worm could\nbecome the first animal proven to use UV bioluminescence, meaning that they\ncreate ultraviolet light naturally, for communication, among other things.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever seen the worm during the day, so we don't know where it\nhides. So, we cannot rule out that its eyes are used during the day as well.\nWhat we do know is that its most important activities, like finding food and\nmating, occur at night. So, it is likely that this is when its eyes are\nimportant,\" says Anders Garm.\n\nPart of the explanation may be due to the fact that these worms see different\nwavelengths of light than we humans do. Their vision is geared to ultraviolet\nlight, invisible to the human eye. And according to Garm, this may indicate\nthat the purpose of its eyes is to see bioluminescent signals in the otherwise\npitch-black nighttime sea.\n\n\"We have a theory that the worms themselves are bioluminescent and communicate\nwith each other via light. If you use normal blue or green light as\nbioluminescence, you also risk attracting predators. But if instead, the worm\nuses UV light, it will remain invisible to animals other than those of its own\nspecies. Therefore, our hypothesis is that they\u2019ve developed sharp UV vision\nso as to have a secret language related to mating,\" says Garm, who continues:\n\n\"It may also be that they are on the lookout look for UV bioluminescent prey.\nBut regardless, it makes things truly exciting as UV bioluminescence has yet\nto be witnessed in any other animal. So, we hope to be able to present this as\nthe first example,\" says the researcher.\n\n## Exciting for robotics research and evolutionary history\n\nAs a result of the discovery, Anders Garm and his research colleagues have\nalso started working with robotics researchers from the Maersk Mc-Kinney\nM\u00f8ller Institute at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) who find\ntechnological inspiration in biology. Together, they share a common goal of\ninvestigating whether it is possible to understand the mechanism behind these\neyes well enough so as to translate it into technology.\n\n\"Together with the robotics researchers, we are working to understand how\nanimals with brains as simple as these can process all of the information that\nsuch large eyes are likely able to collect. This suggests that there are super\nsmart ways to process information in their nervous system. And if we can\ndetect these mechanisms mathematically, they could be integrated into computer\nchips and used to control robots,\" explains Ander Garm.\n\nAccording to Garm, Vanadis' eyes are also interesting with regards to\nevolutionary theory because they could help settle one of the heaviest\nacademic debates surrounding the theory: Whether eyes have only evolved once \u2013\nand evolved into every form that we know of today, or whether they have arisen\nseveral times, independently of one another, in evolutionary history.\n\nVanadis' eyes are built simply, but equipped with advanced functionality. At\nthe same time, they have evolved in a relatively short evolutionarily time\nspan of just a few million years. This means that they must have developed\nindependently of, for example, human eyes, and that the development of vision,\neven with a high level of function, is possible in a relatively short time.\n\n### Extra Info: The eye and evolution\n\nIn general, eyes come in complex sizes, which is the case with the human eye,\nfor example. Evolutionary skeptics have often pointed to the eye and said 'see\nfor yourself, this must have been created by God'.\n\nThe eyes of the Vanadis worm have a surprisingly simple natural \"design\" that\nhas evolved in a relatively short time span compared to typical evolutionary\ntimelines \u2013 i.e., a few million years. Despite their simplicity, they are\nadvanced.\n\nThe emergence of eyes has been the subject of many debates since Darwin\npresented his theory of evolution in Origin of Species, both among those who\nare religious and skeptics outside science, as well as among eye biology and\nvision researchers.\n\nOne of these debates has been about whether eyes have only evolved once \u2013 and\ninto every form that we know today, or whether they have arisen several times,\nindependently of one another, in evolutionary history. Research in recent\nyears has provided a number of pieces of evidence to support the latter, and\nthe eyes of the Vanadis worm are another powerful piece of evidence in that\ndirection.\n\n\u201cThis means that they must have developed independently of, for example, human\neyes and that the development of vision, even with a high level of function,\nis possible in a relatively short time. Because, this worm is so young on an\nevolutionary scale,\" says Michael Bok.\n\n### Darwin and the eye\n\nIn Charles Darwin\u2019s major work, On the Origin of Species, he wrote about the\nincredible nature of the eye in relation to his theory of evolution by natural\nselection. He is often quoted by evolutionary skeptics as saying:\n\n\u201cTo suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting\nthe focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light,\nand for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been\nformed by natural selection, seems, I confess, absurd in the highest\ndegree...\u201d\n\nBut this quote forgets to add the end of the passage:\n\n\u201cYet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex\neye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its\npossessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so\nslightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if\nany variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under\nchanging conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect\nand complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by\nour imagination, can hardly be considered real.\u201d (Origin of Species, chap. 6)\n\n## Contact\n\nAnders Garm Associate professor\n\nDepartment of Biology University of Copenhagen\n\nalgarm@bio.ku.dk +45 35 33 15 24\n\nMichael Bok Researcher\n\nDepartment of Biology Lund University\n\nmichael.bok@biol.lu.se +46 (0)70 255 88 91\n\nKristian Bj\u00f8rn-Hansen Journalist and Press Contact\n\nFaculty of Science University of Copenhagen\n\nkbh@science.ku.dk +45 93 51 60 02\n\n## Topics\n\n  * Animals\n  * Wild animals\n\n## More stories\n\nTHE BRAIN\n\n### Jellyfish are smarter than you think\n\nMicrobiology\n\n### RNA trickery disarms the antiviral CRISPR defenses of bacteria\n\nFoods of the future\n\n### Scientists use blue-green algae as a surrogate mother for \"meat-like\"\nproteins\n\nFaculty of Science University of Copenhagen B\u00fclowsvej 17 1870 Frederiksberg C\n\nContact: SCIENCE Communication nyhedsteam@science.ku.dk Tel: +45 Tel. +45 35\n33 28 28\n\n## University of Copenhagen\n\n  * Management\n  * Administration\n  * Faculties\n  * Departments\n  * Research centres\n  * Animal hospitals\n  * School of Dentistry\n  * Libraries\n  * Museums and attractions\n\n## Contact\n\n  * Map\n  * Find an employee\n  * Contact UCPH\n\n## Services\n\n  * Press and media service\n  * Merchandise\n  * UCPH apps\n  * IT-support\n  * For suppliers\n\n## For students and employees\n\n  * KUnet\n\n## Job and career\n\n  * Job portal\n  * Alumni\n\n## Emergencies\n\n  * Emergency response\n\n## Web\n\n  * Cookies and privacy policy\n  * Accessibility statement\n  * Information security\n\n## Connect with UCPH\n\nClose menu\n\n", "frontpage": false}
