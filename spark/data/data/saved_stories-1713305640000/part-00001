According to Kepler, there's very little difference between modern\nCPUs from Intel and AMD and GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD, and any optimization\ndone for one vendor essentially applies to all. At the same time, tools used\nby developers have improved massively over the years and can extract most\npotential performance with ease. The days of \"to the metal\" optimization are\nlong gone because it's largely unnecessary nowadays, so there's really no\nuntapped potential for the current generation consoles, making the PlayStation\n5 Pro somewhat of a necessity to bring visuals and performance forward in the\nconsole space.\n\n> Over the last few decades all hardware vendors have converged to very\n> similar designs.\n>\n> There is barely any difference in a CPU from Intel vs AMD vs Apple or a GPU\n> from NVIDIA vs AMD vs Intel these days.\n>\n> Any optimization for one vendor applies to all others.\n>\n> \u2014 Kepler (@Kepler_L2) April 15, 2024\n\n> Not to mention that all the tools used by devs (e.g compilers) have improved\n> massively over the years and can extract most of potential performance with\n> ease.\n>\n> Nobody does \"to the metal\" optimization these days because it's a) too hard\n> b) largely unnecessary.\n>\n> \u2014 Kepler (@Kepler_L2) April 15, 2024\n\nTo see a real jump in visual fidelity, however, the next generation of\nconsoles will be needed, as the PlayStation 5 Pro will not be a massive leap\nover the base model. Still, the improved GPU, better ray tracing, and the\nPlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler should provide a nice boost\nthat will tide over console players until the release of the PlayStation 6.\nWhile we still don't know when the console will be released, it shouldn't be\ntoo far off in the future, as all PlayStation 5 games going into certification\nfrom August 2024 are expected to feature PlayStation 5 Pro compatibility.\n\nShare this story\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\n### Deal of the Day\n\n### Further Reading\n\n  * #### Sony Takes Down PS5 Pro Video From Known Tech YouTuber Moore\u2019s Law is Dead\n\n  * #### PlayStation 5 Pro Compatibility Will Be Expected for Certification Starting This August\n\n  * #### PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced Label Requirements Revealed; 28% Faster RAM, 45% Faster GPU Confirmed\n\n  * #### PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution\u2019s Goal Is to Deliver 4K/120 FPS, 8K/60 FPS Gameplay, but Not on PS5 Pro\n\n### Comments\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  * #### Sony Takes Down PS5 Pro Video From Known Tech YouTuber Moore\u2019s Law is Dead\n\n121 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 Flagships Could Feature High-Capacity 5,500mAh Batteries To Compensate For The Chipset\u2019s Increased Power Consumption\n\n97 Active Readers\n\n  * #### PlayStation 5 Pro Is Needed for Advancing Visuals, Performance, as There\u2019s No Untapped PS5 Potential Due to Homogenized CPU, GPU Design\n\n64 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Microcenter Offering Just $700 US \u201cTrade-In\u201d Value For $2000 US GeForce RTX 4090 GPU\n\n25 Active Readers\n\n  * #### iPhone 17 To Reportedly Miss Out On TSMC\u2019s Cutting-Edge 2nm Process, A19 Pro To Likely Use More Advanced 3nm Node\n\n23 Active Readers\n\n### Popular Discussions\n\n  * #### AMD RDNA 4 & RDNA 3+ GPUs Receive Updated Support In Linux Graphics Drivers\n\n1286 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Arrow Lake-S 24 & 20 Core Desktop CPUs Spotted: Core Ultra 200 ES Chips Without SMT, Up To 3 GHz\n\n1130 Comments\n\n  * #### NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 RMA in China Becomes a Huge Issue, Full Refunds Offered To Affectees\n\n1043 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Lunar Lake \u201cCore Ultra 200\u201d CPUs To Offer Over 100 AI TOPs & 3x NPU Performance, 40 Million AI CPUs Shipped By 2024 End\n\n1008 Comments\n\n  * #### Jim Keller Criticizes NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell\u2019s $10 Billion R&D Cost, Says It Could\u2019ve Been Achievable In $1 Billion\n\n922 Comments\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your\ninbox\n\n###### Follow us on\n\nFacebook Youtube Twitter\n\n###### Topics\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Gaming\n  * Mobile\n  * Finance\n  * Software\n  * Security\n  * Web\n\n###### Sections\n\n  * Deals\n  * Reviews\n  * Videos\n  * How To's\n  * Analysis\n  * Exclusives\n  * Interviews\n\n###### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise with Us\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Careers\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy & Cookie Policy\n  * Ethics Statement\n  * Appeal Moderation\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
