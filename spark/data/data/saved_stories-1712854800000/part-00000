After two years of\nwriting and two years of editing, the book is now complete! Thanks to all the\nfeedback from readers and the amazing attention to detail of my editor Sandy\nGordon, the first print release is very polished.\n\n### Can I see a preview?\n\nI\u2019ve posted an extended preview of the book here (160 pages, PDF) so you can\nget a feel of what\u2019s included. I tried to make the preview useful on its own:\nrather than showing only a few pages from the introduction, I\u2019ve included the\ndefinitions from all the sections, which are the most important part of the\nbook.\n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in reading a whole book, but just want to see the\ngraphical representation of all the linear algebra topics, I encourage you to\ncheck the concept maps here. If you\u2019re looking for a quick refresher on linear\nalgebra concepts, you can check the four-page linear algebra summary here.\n\n### Why should I learn linear algebra?\n\nLinear algebra is the foundation of science and engineering. Knowledge of\nlinear algebra is a prerequisite for studying statistics, machine learning,\ncomputer graphics, signal processing, chemistry, economics, and quantum\nmechanics. Indeed, linear algebra offers a powerful toolbox for modelling the\nreal world. All areas of advanced science and engineering make use of linear\nalgebra models in one way or another. So essentially, you need to learn linear\nalgebra if you want to do science.\n\n### Why do I need this book?\n\nThere are many great books about linear algebra that exist out there[1,2,3].\nThe NO BULLSHIT guide to LINEAR ALGEBRA is special because of the concise,\nconversational tone it is written in, the prerequisites material it includes,\nand the numerous exciting applications of linear algebra it discusses. This\nbook is the result of years of private tutoring, which makes the narrative\nfeel much more like a conversation with a friend rather than a stuffy lecture.\nI know from experience that many adults don\u2019t remember basic math topics like\nalgebra, functions, and equations, so the book includes a comprehensive review\nchapter (Chapter 1) to make sure everyone is on board with the fundamentals.\n\nThe \u201cmain course\u201d of the book (Chapters 2 through 6) consists of all the\nstandard material covered in linear algebra courses with lots of examples,\nexercises, and practice problems with solutions.\n\nThe book concludes with three \u201cdessert\u201d chapters that discuss applications of\nlinear algebra. We start with applications to chemistry, economics, electrical\nengineering, graph theory, numerical optimization, cryptography, and signal\nprocessing (Chapter 7). Next we followup with a chapter on probability theory,\nMarkov chains, and an exploration of Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm (Chapter 8).\nThe book concludes with a chapter that introduces the fundamental ideas of\nquantum mechanics and quantum computing (Chapter 9). Many of the topics\ncovered in chapters 7, 8, and 9 are considered \u201cadvanced\u201d or \u201cgraduate level,\u201d\nbut readers of the book who\u2019ve gained a solid grasp of linear algebra concepts\nwill be able to learn about these exciting applications with no problem at\nall.\n\n### Where can I buy this book?\n\nIt depends on what you want. The eBook version costs $29 and is a pretty sweet\ndeal since it comes with all future updates. But if you really want to learn\nthe material, you should get the softcover print version, which is much better\nfor focused learning, and costs about the same: $39 \u2013 20% off = $31. If money\nisn\u2019t a constraint for you right now, you should get the hardcover, which is\nprinted on larger paper and has a construction that will last for decades.\n\nRegardless of your choice of medium, you\u2019ll be getting the same high quality\nbook that will introduce you to the wonderful subject of linear algebra in the\nleast intimidating way possible.\n\ncontent, product, releases\n\n### 20 thoughts on \u201cNo bullshit linear algebra v2 release\u201d\n\n  1. #### Gregory Magarshak\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 2:36 pm\n\nI looked at the beginning ... from my experience I would start off with a\ndiscussion of lines and their equations, Nd this WHY it is called linear\nalgebra. And maybe talk about f(cx) = cf(x) and g(x+y) = g(x) + g(y) as two\nseparate properties. It\u2019s a bit jarring for people to encouter linear\ncombinations straight away with no intuition about them.\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 3:31 pm\n\nThe thing is that the general equation of a line, f(x) = mx+b, is actually not\na linear function. We have to single out \u201clines through the origin,\u201d which\ngets complicated quickly. You\u2019re right that it might help to discuss scaling\nand sum property separately... it\u2019s a bit of a jump to ax_1+bx_2 but it skips\nto the essence.\n\nReply\n\n  2. #### L\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 3:10 pm\n\nCan you bundle in the ebook with the softcover?\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 3:28 pm\n\nHi, If you get the softcover and email me some sort of proof-of-purchase (e.g.\nthe receipt from lulu or amazon), I\u2019ll send you the PDF for free.\n\nEDIT: for those who asked, my email is first dot last at the gmails, or first\nat this domain\n\nReply\n\n  3. #### Stephen Thomas\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 5:34 pm\n\nHow would you compare this to Strang\u2019s book?\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 9:07 pm\n\nHi Stephen. I\u2019d say it covers mostly the same core topics, but in a different\norder. I don\u2019t put too much emphasis on proofs and theorems, but rather try to\ncover the material as part of a conversational flow. This seems to make for\neasier reading for non-mathematicians, but might not be \u201crigourous enough\u201d for\nserious mathematicians.\n\nSome topics I don\u2019t cover, but which are in Strang: Jordan form, game theory,\nand several applications like considerations for numerical methods (e.g. the\ncondition number for a matrix).\n\nSome topics I cover that are not in Strang: intro to probability theory,\ncrypto, error correcting codes, and the intro to quantum mechanics.\n\nReply\n\n  4. #### Ernesto\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 9:54 pm\n\nIs this 2nd edition available on Amazon?\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nApril 14, 2017 \u2014 9:59 pm\n\nYes. LULU and amazon currently have exactly the same version.\n\nReply\n\n  5. #### Fred\n\nApril 17, 2017 \u2014 12:52 pm\n\nI bought the earlier ebook version. Love it. How can I update?\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nApril 19, 2017 \u2014 3:26 pm\n\nHi Fred. Search for an email form gumroad from last week (Friday, Apr 14th)\nand the bottom of that email you should find the link to the latest version.\nNote I\u2019ll keep updating the gumroad shopping cart over time so you\u2019ll have all\nfuture version too.\n\nReply\n\n  6. #### Iu\n\nApril 19, 2017 \u2014 4:44 pm\n\nHi, is it possible to get it as an epub? or do you have any plans to sell it\nin that format?\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nApril 20, 2017 \u2014 10:48 am\n\nEpub and mobi are in the works. Estimated time of release is June. I have\nthem, but I need to fix some edge cases with figures and problem solutions.\n\nReply\n\n      1. #### Iu\n\nApril 20, 2017 \u2014 11:16 am\n\ngreat thanks I\u2019ll wait then\n\nReply\n\n  7. #### AL leong\n\nApril 28, 2017 \u2014 11:16 am\n\nHi Ivan, Would you be covering the whole undergrad course in physics and maths\nin the near future? The textbooks out there are expensive even for working\nadults returning to college.\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nApril 29, 2017 \u2014 12:34 pm\n\nI have been working on TOME II of the MATH & PHYSICS book, which will cover\nE&M and vector calculus. This kind of material is probably less useful for the\ngeneral audience, but I think it\u2019s worth finishing what I started. I also plan\nto write a book on differential equations, with a lot of practical examples\n(otherwise it\u2019s a pretty boring subject).\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I can go any further than that and talk about advanced math\nand physics. For one, I\u2019m not that expert. Also, once you get past the first\nyear, mainstream textbooks for more advanced topics are not that bad. I see\nthe main problem and value I can contribute to help students and adult\nlearners get through the first year material and teach them the skills to fend\nfor themselves and pursue the more advanced books.\n\nAre there any other topics you would like to see?\n\nReply\n\n  8. #### AL leong\n\nApril 29, 2017 \u2014 7:06 pm\n\nWould there be complex analysis and real analysis? Also what important\nsubjects need to be done in the last 2 years of a physics degree?\n\nReply\n\n  9. #### Yassine\n\nMay 7, 2017 \u2014 2:44 pm\n\nAny plan for ebook release through kindle?\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nMay 8, 2017 \u2014 11:00 pm\n\nThe Kindle and ePub versions are in the works. I\u2019ll be using\nsoftcover/polyTeXnic for the conversion, which is an awesome library that\nmakes math look beautiful. I just need to write some glue code to handle the\nexercises and some extra scripts to deal with the tikz figures. The ETA is\nperhaps end-of-May, or early-June.\n\nReply\n\n  10. #### Keith\n\nJune 5, 2017 \u2014 9:05 pm\n\nA No Bullshit Guide to Quantum Mechanics would be awesome.\n\nReply\n\n    1. #### ivan\n\nJune 5, 2017 \u2014 9:26 pm\n\nHi Keith. Did you take a look at Chapter 9 in the book:\nhttps://minireference.com/static/excerpts/noBSguide2LA_preview.pdf#page=125 ?\nIt\u2019s not a full course on QM, but it covers most of the essentials of matrix\nquantum mechanics.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nMinireference Co.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
