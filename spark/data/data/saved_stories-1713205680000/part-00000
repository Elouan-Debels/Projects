We exclusively reported yesterday that Tesla was\nprepping a massive layoff.\n\nFor the last few months, it has looked like Tesla might be preparing for a\nround of layoffs. Tesla told managers to identify critical team members, and\npaused some stock rewards while canceling some employees\u2019 annual reviews. It\nalso reduced production at Gigafactory Shanghai.\n\nThen, over the weekend, we heard rumors that these layoffs were about to\nhappen, which came to us from multiple independent sources, as we reported on\nyesterday. The rumors indicated that layoffs could be as high as 20%, and in\naddition we heard that Tesla would shorten Cybertruck production shifts at\nGigafactory Texas (despite CEO Elon Musk\u2019s recent insistence that Cybertruck\nis currently production constrained).\n\nNow those rumors have been confirmed \u2013 though with a lower number \u2013 in a\ncompany-wide email sent by Musk, which leaked soon after it was sent. The full\ntext of the email is below:\n\n> Over the years, we have grown rapidly with multiple factories scaling around\n> the globe. With this rapid growth there has been duplication of roles and\n> job functions in certain areas. As we prepare the company for our next phase\n> of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company\n> for cost reductions and increasing productivity.\n>\n> As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization\n> and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10%\n> globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will\n> enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.\n>\n> I would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work\n> over the years. I\u2019m deeply grateful for your many contributions to our\n> mission and we wish you well in your future opportunities. It is very\n> difficult to say goodbye.\n>\n> For those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult\n> job that remains ahead. We are developing some of the most revolutionary\n> technologies in auto, energy and artificial intelligence. As we prepare the\n> company for the next phase of growth, your resolve will make a huge\n> difference in getting us there.\n>\n> Thanks, Elon\n\nAdditionally there are reports that some employees have already been locked\nout of system access.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have an exact percentage, \u201cmore than 10%\u201d means at least 14,000\nemployees will be laid off, as Tesla\u2019s employee headcount is somewhere on the\norder of 140,000 total employees (Notably, Tesla\u2019s headcount has not\nexperienced as much \u201crapid growth\u201d in recent years as it has in the past,\nmaking that line of the email ring somewhat hollow).\n\nAnd we don\u2019t know which specific teams will be most or least affected by\nTesla\u2019s layoffs, but two well-known Tesla executives are now missing the\n\u201cTesla-affiliated\u201d badge on twitter \u2013 Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel.\n\nBaglino is still listed as Senior VP of Powertrain and Energy on Tesla\u2019s\nwebsite, and Patel is Tesla\u2019s Policy chair who has also served as an impromptu\nTesla PR arm on twitter, commenting on news in the place of Tesla\u2019s still\nincomprehensibly-nonexistent PR department.\n\nWhile this may not mean anything, the badge does still exist and is shown on\nFranz von Holzhausen and Martin Viecha\u2018s profiles, so it is conspicuous that\nit is missing from the aforementioned executives.\n\nThe news follows a bad quarterly delivery report in which Tesla significantly\nmissed delivery estimates, and had a rare year-over-year reduction in sales.\nWhile Tesla does not break out sales by geographical region, the main dip\nseems to have come from China, where Chinese EV makers are ramping quickly\nboth in the domestic and export market.\n\nTesla will deliver its quarterly profits report next Tuesday, April 23.\nAnalysts estimate that Tesla will still turn a profit of around 50 cents a\nshare, down from 85 cents a share in Q1 2023.\n\nIn previous quarters, Tesla has guided for a \u201cpause\u201d inbetween growth phases,\nexpecting that sales growth would be more modest until the release of next-gen\nvehicles like the ~$25,000 Model 2 (though Reuters recently reported that Musk\nwants to shift Tesla\u2019s focus to a robotaxi model, which Musk denied just hours\nbefore announcing the robotaxi unveiling event).\n\nTesla\u2019s layoffs come at a time when many other companies in the tech industry\nare laying off staff, in an apparent game of follow-the-leader while industry\nprofits are still high.\n\n## Electrek\u2019s Take\n\nOne issue I\u2019ve always had with Tesla is that, if anything, it feels like\nheadcount in the company is too low, not too high. There are so many issues\nthat seem to fall through the cracks (both on a high and low level \u2013 Tesla\nowners, have you ever had trouble getting in touch with someone in service?),\nand I think the reason for this is because Tesla employees are often\noverworked. This leads to burnout and turnover, a lack of institutional\nmemory, and a lack of ownership for certain problems that don\u2019t get solved.\n\nTesla owes a lot of its success to its \u201cstartup mentality,\u201d where it\u2019s all\nhands on deck to grow the company that is shaking up a couple of the largest\nentire sectors on earth \u2013 automotive and energy. The fact that it has shaken\nup these sectors so successfully is proof that this approach has been\neffective.\n\nAnd that helps in recruiting as well \u2013 there are a lot of jobs that claim they\nare changing the world, but Tesla can really claim that it legitimately is on\nthe vanguard of the changing transportation industry. That\u2019s a great way to\nrecruit the best and brightest, and as a result, the company hasn\u2019t had to\nworry much about losing talent since it has such a recruitment advantage and\ncan take its pick of the brightest minds out there (though that recruitment\nadvantage could be changing, given Musk\u2019s increasingly distasteful behavior).\n\nHowever, Tesla is 20 years old now. It\u2019s an enormous and established company.\nIt needs to mature and have more established processes, less turnover, and\nmore security for its employees. These sorts of things help reduce errors and\nincrease morale.\n\n## Top comment by Aigars Mahinovs\n\nLiked by 18 people\n\nEvery time you see a company declaring that they are laying off X% of their\nworkforce, you know that the management of the company has failed to ...\nmanage the company and instead of taking responsibility and finding solutions\nthey have chosen to shift the blame and the pain down the ranks to the line\nworkers. Destroying trust in the company and good will, broadly advertising\nthe company as a bad place to work for, flagging up that you as a worker for\nthis company is nothing more than a (temporary) expense category that it would\nget rid off as soon as possible. And the worst part - it is a short-term fix.\nThe gains will be only really seen in the short term as in middle term the\nproductivity will go down, best people will leave to other companies, new\npeople will need to be trained up again, institutional knowledge will get\nlost, .. Car manufacturing is not a throwaway electronics manufacturing job -\ntotal lifecycle of a single car model can be as long as 25 years. Keeping\npeople around from very start of the design process until the end of\nproduction and then up until end of support is very important to maintaining\ngood long term customer satisfaction.\n\nThere is a reason why serious experienced car manufacturers very rarely lay\npeople off. You can actually find car makers that have not really done any\nsignificant layoffs since the middle of last century. Individual people that\nperform badly or create significant problems can be laid off at all times, no\nneed for top-down wave.\n\nView all comments\n\nWhile these layoffs are a reaction to a reduction in sales (but not a loss of\nmoney if analysts are to be believed \u2013 Tesla is likely still profitable,\nthough we\u2019ll hear more next Tuesday), they can\u2019t be helping with morale.\n\nRemaining employees will wake up to an email from a CEO who is increasingly\nabsent as he spends all of his time addicted to an app he wasted $44 billion\non (yet demands more stock while firing 10% of the company), see their\nalready-large workloads get larger, and wonder if the feeling of changing the\nworld is really worth all these newly-apparent downsides. Maybe they\u2019ll wonder\nif getting poached by the new tech buzzword wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\n\nWhich is a shame, because we do need Tesla to keep pushing things forward, and\nto keep attracting the best and brightest. While Pandora\u2019s box is open and EVs\nare here to stay at this point, regardless Tesla\u2019s ups and comparatively-rare\ndowns, the rest of the industry is still trying hard to pump the brakes on the\ntransition, even if it means America will be less competitive if they get\ntheir way.\n\nTesla is one of the few entities that is large enough and committed enough to\ndragging those timelines forward, whether the rest of the industry likes it or\nnot. We need a healthy Tesla, and for that, we need good employee morale.\n\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
