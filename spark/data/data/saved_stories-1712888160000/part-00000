In the U.S.,\ndata centers in northern Virginia achieved similar results. The company said\nits goal is \u201cto transform geographically distributed IT infrastructure into\nthe functional equivalent of a single data center.\u201d\n\nIn separate demonstrations, NTT and NTT DATA connected data centers in the\nU.K. (HH2 in Hemel Hempstead and LON1 in Dagenham) and in the U.S. (VA1 and\nVA3 in Ashburn) using APN equipment from NEC. These U.K. and U.S. data centers\nare 89km and 4km apart, respectively. (See Figure 1.) Measurements in tests\nconducted over 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps links showed the two APN-connected data\ncenters in the U.K. operated with less than 1 millisecond (approximately 0.9\nmilliseconds) of latency, and with a delay variation (sometimes called jitter)\nof less than 0.1 microseconds. (See Figure 2 and Table 1.) (A microsecond is\none millionth of a second. A millisecond is one thousandth of a second.)\n\nAccording to cloud connectivity provider Megaport, typical delay between data\ncenters at an equivalent distance exceeds 2,000 microseconds (2 milliseconds).\nIn the U.S. case, delay over the much shorter span was approximately 0.06\nmilliseconds; and delay variation was less than 0.05 microseconds. By\ncontrast, conventional networks with general Layer 2 switches experience delay\nvariation of several microseconds to tens of microseconds. In other words, the\nAPN cuts latency in half, and jitter by orders of magnitude.\n\n\u201cThe data center market is under severe local constraints,\u201d NTT said in its\nannouncement. \u201cCarbon dioxide emission restrictions and land shortages have\nmade it difficult to build data centers in urban areas, forcing operators to\nturn to the suburbs. Yet with geographically distant data centers, delay of\ncommunication, or latency, can be very high, making it difficult to meet\ncustomers\u2019 needs for low latency.\u201d\n\nThe APN delivered very low latency required by current and emerging use cases.\nThese include distributed, real-time AI analysis, such as industrial IoT and\npredictive maintenance, smart surveillance systems, smart grid and energy\nmanagement, natural disaster detection and response and more. NTT DATA is also\nconducting demonstrations in the financial sector, where low latency is\nrequired for remittances, settlements and transactions. Another advantage of\nthe IOWN APN is that it enables line activation simply by adding wavelengths,\nwithout needing to install new dark fiber. As a result, data center operators\ncan respond very quickly to customer demand.\n\n  * tweet\n  * share\n  * share\n  * share\n  * email\n\nFiled Under: Featured, HPC Hardware, Network, News Tagged With: HPC', NTT, NTT\nDATA, photonics, photonics network, silicon photonics\n\n#### Sponsored Guest Articles\n\n### Dell: Omnia Copes with Configuring HPC-AI Environments\n\n[SPONSORED GUEST ARTICLE] Computer scientist Alan Perlis once said that fools\nignore complexity while pragmatists suffer it.
