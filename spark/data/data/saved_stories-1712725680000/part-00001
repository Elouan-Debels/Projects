It\nappears in ancient woodlands and along woodland edges in April and May.\nMillions of bulbs can exist in just one wood, giving rise to the violet-blue\n\u2018carpets' that are such a springtime joy to walk through. This early flowering\nallows them to make the most of the sunlight that is still able to make it to\nthe forest floor habitat, before the canopy becomes too thick. Native\nbluebells are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act,\n1981.\n\n#### Native bluebells have:\n\n  * narrow leaves, about 1-1.5cm wide\n  * deep violet-blue (sometimes white), narrow, tubular-bell flowers, with tips that curl back\n  * flowers on one side of the stem\n  * distinctly drooping stems\n  * a sweet scent\n  * cream-coloured pollen inside\n\n\u00a9Philip Precey\n\nBluebells \u00a9Katrina Martin / 2020VISION\n\nBluebells by Tom Marshall\n\n\u00a9Philip Precey\n\nBluebells \u00a9Katrina Martin / 2020VISION\n\nBluebells by Tom Marshall\n\n\u00a9Philip Precey\n\n### The Spanish bluebell\n\nThe Spanish bluebell, Hyacinthoides hispanica, was introduced into the UK by\nthe Victorians as a garden plant, but escaped into the wild \u2013 it was first\nnoted as growing \u2018over the garden wall\u2019 in 1909. It is likely that this escape\noccurred from both the carefree disposal of bulbs and pollination. Today, the\nSpanish bluebell can be found alongside our native bluebell in woodlands and\nalong woodland edges, as well as on roadsides and in gardens.\n\n#### Spanish bluebells have:\n\n  * broad leaves, about 3cm wide\n  * pale blue (often white or pink), conical-bell flowers, with spreading and open tips\n  * flowers all around the stem\n  * upright stems\n  * no scent\n  * blue- or pale green-coloured pollen inside\n\n\u00a9Richard Burkmar\n\nSpanish bluebell by Richard Burkmar\n\n### Does it matter that we have both in the wild?\n\nThe UK's woodlands are home to almost 50% of the world's population of the\nbluebell. But this much-loved plant is under threat. The Spanish bluebell is\nmore vigorous than our native bluebell, so can outcompete it for resources\nlike light and space. It can hybridise with our native, too, producing fertile\nplants that show a whole range of mixed features from both species. Over time,\nthis hybridisation changes the genetic makeup of our native species, diluting\nits characteristics, weakening it and potentially evolving it into something\nelse.\n\nIt is now thought that most bluebells in urban areas are actually hybrids. A\nstudy by Plantlife has also found that one in six broadleaved woodlands\ncontained hybrids or the Spanish bluebell.\n\n### Does it make a difference what I plant in my garden?\n\nIntroduced species can become naturalised in the UK without much cause for\nconcern. However, as with the Spanish bluebell, their effects are not always\nso benign, so be careful if you prefer non-native varieties in your planting\nas species can easily escape \u2013 it\u2019s best to dispose of cuttings or bulbs\ncarefully and never plant anything in the wild.\n\nIf you fancy planting bluebells in a shady part of your garden, try to pick\nthe native variety. Not only will you help to prevent the spread of invasive,\nnon-native species into the wider countryside, but you will also provide food\nand shelter for a range of our native insects, from bees to butterflies.\n\n\u00a9 Tom Chalmers\n\n## Become a member\n\nJoin your Wildlife Trust\n\n\u00a9Luke Massey/2020VISION\n\n## Learn more about wildflowers\n\nExplore\n\n## What we do\n\n  * Save wildlife and wild places\n  * Bring people closer to nature\n\n## The Wildlife Trusts\n\n  * About us\n  * Contact us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Accessibility statement\n  * Safeguarding Commitment Statement\n\n## Get involved\n\n  * Become a member\n  * Take action for wildlife\n  * Visit\n  * Volunteer\n\nThe Wildlife Trusts: Bringing Back Wildlife.
