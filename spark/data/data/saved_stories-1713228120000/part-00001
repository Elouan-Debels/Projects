The reason: mental health has declined precipitously among\nadolescents and young adults in recent years.\n\nIn a new working paper, economists David Blanchflower, Alex Bryson and Xiaowei\nXu document the disappearance of the \"midlife crisis\" using data from the\nU.S., U.K. and over 30 other countries. They find that around 2011, the age\nprofile of unhappiness fundamentally changed.\n\nWhile unhappiness used to follow an inverted U-shape, peaking in one's 40s and\n50s before improving later in life, it now monotonically declines with age.\nThe change is driven by skyrocketing rates of anxiety, depression and suicidal\nthoughts among teens and young adults, particularly young women.\n\n##\n\nThe Data\n\nData from government health surveys in the U.S. and U.K. show the proportion\nof young women who experienced serious psychological distress in the past\nmonth more than doubled between 2009 and 2022. For young men, it also rose\nsubstantially, though not quite as dramatically.\n\nThe researchers replicated this finding across 34 countries using five\ndifferent measures of mental distress from 2020-2024. In every country,\nunhappiness was highest among 18-24-year-olds and declined with each\nsuccessive age group. Young women fared the worst.\n\nThe causes are still being investigated, but the authors point to the 2008\nrecession, the COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020, and the meteoric rise of\nsmartphones and social media as potential culprits. Excessive screen time has\nbeen linked to poor mental health outcomes in teens.\n\nWhatever the reasons, the consequences are alarming: more young people are\nstruggling in school, dropping out of the workforce, and in the worst cases,\ntaking their own lives. Suicide rates among U.S. teens and young adults are up\nmore than 50% since 2010.\n\nThanks for reading population.news!
