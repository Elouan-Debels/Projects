In 2023, people\nwatched over 30 billion hours of shopping related videos on YouTube, and there\nwas a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop on YouTube!\n\nWith spring\u2019s fresh energy comes a wave of new must-have product drops from\nbrands and creators, so as we step into spring shopping season, we\u2019re excited\nto announce even more updates so viewers can shop for new favorites from the\nmost loved creators. The future of Shopping on YouTube has never been\nbrighter.\n\n## Introducing Shopping Collections\n\nShopping Collections is a new way for creators to curate products from their\nfavorite brands - or even their own line! Pick a selection of products for any\ntheme from your current everyday makeup look to the ultimate capsule wardrobe.\n\nFor some inspiration, check out LongHairPrettyNails collection, \u201cSpring Nail\nMust Haves,\u201d Sydney Morgan\u2019s \u201cPreppy Essentials\u201d that includes some of her\nfavorite skincare and makeup, or can\u2019t miss recommendations for the Sephora\nSavings Event from Johnny Ross.\n\nCollections will appear in a creator\u2019s product list, Store tab, and video\ndescription. At launch, creators can make Collections on the Studio app on\ntheir phone, with the feature coming soon to desktop.\n\nWe hope Collections helps creators curate their own virtual store on YouTube\nso people can shop their favorite products and increase earnings!\n\n## Find exclusive promos and offers in the Affiliate Hub\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good deal? We\u2019re launching a new Affiliate Hub directly in\nthe YouTube app so creators can find the latest list of Shopping partners,\ncompetitive commission rates, promo codes, and even request samples from top\nbrands.\n\nThe Affiliate Hub is making it easier for Shopping creators to find the\ninformation to start planning their next shoppable video.\n\n## More like this\n\nNews and Events\n\n### More ways for creators to earn on YouTube\n\n## Tag products across multiple videos at once\n\nLast year, we launched the ability for affiliate shopping creators to tag\nproducts across their videos in bulk based on products creators have added to\nthe description. We\u2019re now expanding this feature to all Shopping creators, so\nthey can tag their own products and merch across their video library!\n\nThis can help creators earn more revenue from older content that still gets\nhigh traffic.\n\n## Connect your Fourthwall shop\n\nFinally, we\u2019re adding Fourthwall to our growing list of integrated platforms\nto make it easier for creators to create and manage their stories directly in\nYouTube Studio.\n\nWe know that people come to YouTube every day to connect with the things and\ncreators they love, so we hope these new YouTube Shopping features make that\njourney even easier for creators and viewers.\n\n## More like this\n\nNews and Events\n\n### More ways for creators to earn on YouTube\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Products and Features\n  * Experience YouTube\n\nWant more from The YouTube Blog?
