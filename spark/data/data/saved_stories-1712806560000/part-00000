Credit: Graham Clark/Alamy\n\nFew scientists have enjoyed as much fame in recent years as British\ntheoretical physicist Peter Higgs, the namesake of the boson that was\ndiscovered in 2012, who died on 8 April, aged 94.\n\nPeter Higgs: the man behind the God particle\n\nIt was 60 years ago when Higgs first suggested how an elementary particle of\nunusual properties could pervade the universe in the form of an invisible\nfield, giving other elementary particles their masses. Several other\nphysicists independently thought of this mechanism around the same time,\nincluding Fran\u00e7ois Englert, now at the Free University of Brussels. The\nparticle was a crucial element of the theoretical edifice that physicists were\nbuilding in those years,which later became known as the standard model of\nparticles and fields.\n\nTwo separate experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva,\nSwitzerland \u2014 ATLAS and the CMS \u2014 confirmed Higgs\u2019 predictions when they\nannounced the discovery of the Higgs boson half a century later. It was the\nlast missing component of the standard model, and Higgs and Englert shared a\nNobel Prize in 2013 for predicting its existence. Physicists at the LHC\ncontinue to learn about the properties of the Higgs boson, but some\nresearchers say that only a dedicated collider that can produce the particle\nin copious amounts \u2014 dubbed a \u2018Higgs factory\u2019 \u2014 will enable them to gain a\nprofound understanding of its role.\n\n## Inspiring figure\n\n\u201cBesides his outstanding contributions to particle physics, Peter was a very\nspecial person, an immensely inspiring figure for physicists around the world,\na man of rare modesty, a great teacher and someone who explained physics in a\nvery simple yet profound way,\u201d said Fabiola Gianotti, director-general of CERN\nin an obituary posted on the organization\u2019s website; Gianotti who announced\nthe Higgs boson\u2019s discovery to the world at CERN. \u201cI am very saddened, and I\nwill miss him sorely.\u201d\n\nMany physicists took to X, formerly Twitter, to pay tribute to Higgs and share\ntheir favourite memories of him. \u201cRIP to Peter Higgs. The search for the Higgs\nboson was my primary focus for the first part of my career. He was a very\nhumble man that contributed something immensely deep to our understanding of\nthe universe,\u201d posted Kyle Cranmer, physicist at the University of Wisconsin\nMadison and previously a senior member of the Higgs search team at the CMS.\n\nHappy birthday, Higgs boson! What we do and don\u2019t know about the particle\n\n\u201cI was fortunate to meet Peter Higgs in 2013 (days after the Nobel prize\nannouncement). He was modest as he told a group of PhD students the history of\nthe boson theory. Afterwards, I was very lucky to get my copy of the New York\nTimes with the discovery signed by him,\u201d said Clara Nellist, a physicist at\nthe University of Amsterdam and a member of the ATLAS particle-discovery\ncollaboration.\n\n\u201cA career highlight was helping Peter into a cab after the Collider exhibition\nlaunch @sciencemuseum in 2013 with a carrier bag of special-edition beer\nmarking his recent Nobel,\u201d posted Harry Cliff, a physicist at the University\nof Cambridge, UK.\n\n\u201cHe disliked the limelight but was comfortable with friends and colleagues,\u201d\nFrank Close, a physicist at the University of Oxford, UK, and author of the\nbook Elusive: How Peter Higgs Solved the Mystery of Mass (2022), said in a\nstatement to the UK Science Media Centre. \u201cHis boson took 48 years to appear,\nand when the Nobel was announced, he had disappeared to his favourite sea food\nbar in Leith.\u201d\n\n## An exciting journey\n\nHiggs\u2019 work continues to be of fundamental importance, said physicist Sinead\nFarrington at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cWe\u2019re still on an exciting journey\nto figure out whether some further predictions are true, namely whether the\nHiggs boson interacts with itself in the predicted way, and whether it might\ndecay to other beyond the Standard Model particles,\u201d she told the Science\nMedia Centre.\n\nFor physicist and science writer Matt Strassler, Higgs\u2019 death represents \u2018the\nend of an era\u2019. \u201cHiggs was a fortunate scientist: he lived to see his insight\nat age 30 turn up in experiments 50 years later,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cHis role\nand influence in our understanding of the #universe will be remembered for\nmillennia.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01069-6\n\n## References\n\n  1.
