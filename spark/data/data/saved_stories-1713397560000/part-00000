Her past work has focused on immigration\npolitics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right.\n\nApr 4, 2024, 7:38 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photo from Getty Images\n\nIsrael\u2019s military has been using artificial intelligence to help choose its\nbombing targets in Gaza, sacrificing accuracy in favor of speed and killing\nthousands of civilians in the process, according to an investigation by\nIsrael-based publications +972 Magazine and Local Call.\n\nThe system, called Lavender, was developed in the aftermath of Hamas\u2019 October\n7th attacks, the report claims. At its peak, Lavender marked 37,000\nPalestinians in Gaza as suspected \u201cHamas militants\u201d and authorized their\nassassinations.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military denied the existence of such a kill list in a statement to\n+972 and Local Call. A spokesperson told CNN that AI was not being used to\nidentify suspected terrorists but did not dispute the existence of the\nLavender system, which the spokesperson described as \u201cmerely tools for\nanalysts in the target identification process.\u201d Analysts \u201cmust conduct\nindependent examinations, in which they verify that the identified targets\nmeet the relevant definitions in accordance with international law and\nadditional restrictions stipulated in IDF directives,\u201d the spokesperson told\nCNN. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to The Verge\u2019s\nrequest for comment.\n\nIn interviews with +972 and Local Call, however, Israeli intelligence officers\nsaid they weren\u2019t required to conduct independent examinations of the Lavender\ntargets before bombing them but instead effectively served as \u201ca \u2018rubber\nstamp\u2019 for the machine\u2019s decisions.\u201d In some instances, officers\u2019 only role in\nthe process was determining whether a target was male.\n\n#### Choosing targets\n\nTo build the Lavender system, information on known Hamas and Palestinian\nIslamic Jihad operatives was fed into a dataset \u2014 but, according to one source\nwho worked with the data science team that trained Lavender, so was data on\npeople loosely affiliated with Hamas, such as employees of Gaza\u2019s Internal\nSecurity Ministry. \u201cI was bothered by the fact that when Lavender was trained,\nthey used the term \u2018Hamas operative\u2019 loosely, and included people who were\ncivil defense workers in the training dataset,\u201d the source told +972.\n\nLavender was trained to identify \u201cfeatures\u201d associated with Hamas operatives,\nincluding being in a WhatsApp group with a known militant, changing cellphones\nevery few months, or changing addresses frequently. That data was then used to\nrank other Palestinians in Gaza on a 1\u2013100 scale based on how similar they\nwere to the known Hamas operatives in the initial dataset. People who reached\na certain threshold were then marked as targets for strikes. That threshold\nwas always changing \u201cbecause it depends on where you set the bar of what a\nHamas operative is,\u201d one military source told +972.\n\nThe system had a 90 percent accuracy rate, sources said, meaning that about 10\npercent of the people identified as Hamas operatives weren\u2019t members of Hamas\u2019\nmilitary wing at all. Some of the people Lavender flagged as targets just\nhappened to have names or nicknames identical to those of known Hamas\noperatives; others were Hamas operatives\u2019 relatives or people who used phones\nthat had once belonged to a Hamas militant. \u201cMistakes were treated\nstatistically,\u201d a source who used Lavender told +972. \u201cBecause of the scope\nand magnitude, the protocol was that even if you don\u2019t know for sure that the\nmachine is right, you know statistically that it\u2019s fine. So you go for it.\u201d\n\n#### Collateral damage\n\nIntelligence officers were given wide latitude when it came to civilian\ncasualties, sources told +972. During the first few weeks of the war, officers\nwere allowed to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians for every lower-level Hamas\noperative targeted by Lavender; for senior Hamas officials, the military\nauthorized \u201chundreds\u201d of collateral civilian casualties, the report claims.\n\nSuspected Hamas operatives were also targeted in their homes using a system\ncalled \u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d officers told +972. That system put targets generated\nby Lavender under ongoing surveillance, tracking them until they reached their\nhomes \u2014 at which point, they\u2019d be bombed, often alongside their entire\nfamilies, officers said. At times, however, officers would bomb homes without\nverifying that the targets were inside, wiping out scores of civilians in the\nprocess. \u201cIt happened to me many times that we attacked a house, but the\nperson wasn\u2019t even home,\u201d one source told +972. \u201cThe result is that you killed\na family for no reason.\u201d\n\n#### AI-driven warfare\n\nMona Shtaya, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East\nPolicy, told The Verge that the Lavender system is an extension of Israel\u2019s\nuse of surveillance technologies on Palestinians in both the Gaza Strip and\nthe West Bank.\n\nShtaya, who is based in the West Bank, told The Verge that these tools are\nparticularly troubling in light of reports that Israeli defense startups are\nhoping to export their battle-tested technology abroad.\n\nSince Israel\u2019s ground offensive in Gaza began, the Israeli military has relied\non and developed a host of technologies to identify and target suspected Hamas\noperatives. In March, The New York Times reported that Israel deployed a mass\nfacial recognition program in the Gaza Strip \u2014 creating a database of\nPalestinians without their knowledge or consent \u2014 which the military then used\nto identify suspected Hamas operatives. In one instance, the facial\nrecognition tool identified Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha as a suspected\nHamas operative. Abu Toha was detained for two days in an Israeli prison,\nwhere he was beaten and interrogated before being returned to Gaza.\n\nAnother AI system, called \u201cThe Gospel,\u201d was used to mark buildings or\nstructures that Hamas is believed to operate from. According to a +972 and\nLocal Call report from November, The Gospel also contributed to vast numbers\nof civilian casualties. \u201cWhen a 3-year-old girl is killed in a home in Gaza,\nit\u2019s because someone in the army decided it wasn\u2019t a big deal for her to be\nkilled \u2014 that it was a price worth paying in order to hit [another] target,\u201d a\nmilitary source told the publications at the time.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at this as a continuation of the collective punishment\npolicies that have been weaponized against Palestinians for decades now,\u201d\nShtaya said. \u201cWe need to make sure that war times are not used to justify the\nmass surveillance and mass killing of people, especially civilians, in places\nlike Gaza.\u201d\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## TikTok Hearing\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nTikTok Hearing\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## NASA confirms origin of space junk that crashed through Florida home\n\n  2. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\n  3. ## Ikea\u2019s new gaming furniture looks like furniture, not an energy drink\n\n  4. ## Broadcast TV still exists, and now it\u2019s sort of getting a built-in DVR\n\n  5. ## Motorola is bringing the wooden phone back with its new Edge series\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Tech\n\n  * ### The OnePlus Nord N30 5G, one of our favorite budget phones, is $50 off\n\n  * ### Roblox heads to Washington\n\n  * ### The best robot vacuums\n\n  * ### Star Wars\u2019 next animated anthology explores the dark side\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
