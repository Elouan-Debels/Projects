We \u2014 I \u2014 do it all the time.\n\nSometimes it's because tech doesn't work the way I want it to. Sometimes it's\nschadenfreude about a big hyped thing that falls flat. Sometimes it's just a\nsense that the tech we all depend on may be harming us in ways we don't\nunderstand and can't control.\n\nBut also: Sometimes tech reminds you that tech can be awesome, in the golly-\ngee-can-you-believe-it sense some of us used to have about this stuff.\n\nWhich is exactly how I felt after my last trip to San Francisco, when I took\nseveral rides in Waymo's robotaxis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's partly because the tech is ... amazing. You really are in a car,\ndriving around the city, with no one in the driver's seat. Software and\nsensors take care of everything.\n\nAnd partly because the tech already seems so ... normal. You order a Waymo via\nan app, just like an Uber or Lyft. It shows up, you get in, it takes you where\nyou want to go, and you get out.\n\nYes, my 13-year-old son and I spent the first few minutes in our first Waymo\ntexting our friends and family: OMG IM IN A SELF DRIVING TAXI. We also\ndocumented it on social, of course.\n\nWe also felt a bit of the trepidatious rush you get when you sit down in a\nroller coaster and have that internal debate: Is this safe? It must be safe,\nbecause otherwise they wouldn't let you do it, right? But seriously, is this\nsafe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut after those first few minutes of novelty, we went back to doing what we\nalways do in an Uber or a Lyft: zoning out on our phones, staring out the\nwindow, and spending next to no time thinking about who, or what, was driving\nus.\n\nWhich, to me, is really the most amazing part: This stuff is here, now, and\nyou can ... just use it.\n\nAt least some people can. Waymo, which is owned by Google's parent company,\nAlphabet, has a couple hundred self-driving cars roaming around San Francisco,\nand access is still limited there via a waiting list, as well as by geography.\nYou can't get a Waymo to pick you up at San Francisco International Airport,\nfor instance, or take you across the Bay Bridge to Oakland.\n\nIn Phoenix, where Waymo first launched consumer access, it has about the same\nnumber of cars but no waiting list. And now it's starting to roll out in Los\nAngeles and Austin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## We've heard about self-driving taxis forever, but they're just starting to\nbecome a reality\n\nWhile Waymo says it drives tens of thousands of trips a week, even the most\ntech-savvy people I talk to have yet to ride in one.\n\nAnd it's reasonable to have concerns about this tech as it rolls out. Waymo's\nrival Cruise halted its service last fall after a slew of incidents, including\na grisly one where a self-driving Cruise dragged a pedestrian who had been hit\nby a human-driven car.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSelf-driving tech is also an obvious problem for humans who depend on ride-\nhailing services to make a living. (On my previous trip to San Francisco, one\nof my Uber drivers told me he had previously been a recruiter at Amazon who\nlost his job during one of Amazon's recent layoff rounds.)\n\nAnd to be honest, I'm not even sure I would always order a Waymo if I had a\nchance. Right now, beyond the novelty, the big upside for me is that the\nfleet's cars \u2014 electric Jaguars \u2014 are comfortable and clean. And that the per-\ntrip cost is about the same as an Uber Comfort (one level up from the base\nUber X fare) \u2014 but really a bit cheaper, since you're not tipping your robot\ndriver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaymo's self-driving taxis, like this Jaguar model crossing an intersection in\nSan Francisco, are kitted out with cameras and other sensors. JASON\nHENRY/Getty Images\n\nBut there's no reason to believe that the cars will remain pristine, and that\npricing will stay low, as this stuff rolls out more broadly. (Waymo doesn't\ndisclose financials, and the company wouldn't tell me if it's making money on\neach trip. I assume it does not, for now; we do know Waymo has invested\nbillions in this since it started out as a Google project in 2009.)\n\nStill, I can think of all kinds of uses for Waymo \u2014 right now. Like using it\nfor food delivery \u2014 which is happening in Phoenix, via Uber Eats. Maybe it's\nfor people who believe a robot is more reliable than a human driver \u2014 at least\nwe know a Waymo won't watch TikTok while driving on the highway like a Lyft\ndriver did when I was in their back seat a couple of years ago.\n\nOr maybe it's simply for people who would rather not interact with another\nhuman when they're in a taxi. Which is what David Margines, Waymo's director\nof product management, says is the service's chief appeal for customers right\nnow. \"It's their own space,\" he says.\n\n## Waymo's self-driving cars aren't perfect\n\nYes, there are still some issues with Waymo, at least in the rides I took\nrecently. One is simply figuring out how to get in the thing: When your Waymo\narrives, you unlock its doors with your phone \u2014 but only once it has driven to\na very precise location that Waymo knows and you don't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich led, a couple times, to some awkward slow dancing between myself and the\nrobot car. It would stop when I got near but wouldn't let me in because it\nwasn't exactly where it was supposed to be. Then I'd step away, and then it\nwould lurch forward toward its still-unknown-to-me target spot. Then I'd step\nforward and it would stop \u2014 but it still wouldn't let me in.\n\nOn one of my trips, this happened on a particularly tight, winding San\nFrancisco street. As my Waymo and I negotiated with each other, we ended up\nblocking multiple cars, including a minivan whose driver started honking at us\nin frustration.\n\n\"You can't honk at a robot,\" I told her, not very helpfully. \"It doesn't\ncare.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a guy walking by stopped and took out his phone to record the\nscene. \"You can put a cone on it to disable it,\" he told me, unprompted.\nApparently he's right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA self-driving Waymo taxi makes its way through Los Angeles. Mario Tama/Getty\nImages\n\nMore worrisome to me was that on one of my trips \u2014 to a Warriors game at the\nChase Center arena \u2014 at a busy intersection, a Waymo in front of us wouldn't\nrespond to a traffic cop trying to wave it through a red light. Then another\nWaymo pulled up beside it and also didn't respond to the cop. So now three\nWaymos were sitting there, blocking traffic and waiting for the light. The\ntraffic cop stopped trying to move us and just held his hands over his head in\ndisgust.\n\nI figured this was a well-known and understandable problem for Waymos \u2014 of\ncourse their software and sensors wouldn't respond to humans telling them to\noverride traffic signals! Think of the problems that could cause!\n\nBut Margines told me that Waymos are, in fact, supposed to understand human\nsignals like a traffic cop. A Waymo PR person sent me this clip from Waymo CEO\nDmitri Dolgov showing a Waymo doing just that:\n\n> Leveraging AI for semantic understanding of complex driving scenes is a key\n> capability of the #WaymoDriver. Check out this example of it autonomously\n> interpreting and adhering to a police officer directing traffic in Los\n> Angeles. pic.twitter.com/PyPqVaOc6B\n>\n> \u2014 Dmitri Dolgov (@dmitri_dolgov) January 19, 2024\n\nBut unlike with other Big New Tech innovations I've seen in the past \u2014 anyone\nstill have a 3D TV in their living room? \u2014 I don't think self-driving tech is\ngoing away. I think the people behind the tech will figure out its\npossibilities, its limitations, and the places it does and doesn't make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Cruise is starting up again, but this time with humans in the\ndriver's seat. Elon Musk has promised to unveil his robotaxi this summer, and\nwhile your doubt about anything Musk says is well warranted, you never know.\nSo I think that one way or another, we are going to make some version of this\nstandard for many of us in the not-far-off future.\n\nIs that great? I don't know. But it really is amazing.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Driverless taxi torched by mob in San Francisco\n\nTech Transportation Waymo\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
