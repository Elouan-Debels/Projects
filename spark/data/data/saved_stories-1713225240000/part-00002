Only the male has a blue head \u2013 signalling his social\ndominance over a harem of yellow-striped females.\n\nIf this male is removed from the group, something extraordinary happens: the\nlargest female in the group changes sex to become male. Her behaviour changes\nwithin minutes. Within ten days, her ovaries transform into sperm-producing\ntestes. Within 21 days she appears completely male.\n\nBut how does the wrasse change sex, and why did evolution select this system?\n\nAlso, given that fish share sex-determining genes with mammals, would an\nunderstanding of this provide new insight into how sex works in humans and\nother animals?\n\n## How does the transformation happen?\n\nThe trigger for sex change in the bluehead wrasse and some other species is\nsocial. When the male fish is removed, the largest female immediately senses\nhis absence and adopts full male breeding behaviours the same day.\n\nHow this social cue translates into molecular action remains a bit of a\nmystery, but it probably involves stress. High levels of the stress hormone\ncortisol are associated with temperature-based sex determination in other fish\nand reptiles. Cortisol probably alters reproductive function by impacting sex\nhormone levels.\n\nStress could be the unifying mechanism that channels environmental information\ninto a change in sex.\n\nOur research traced changes in the activity of all 20,000-odd bluehead wrasse\ngenes during the female to male transformation.\n\nRead more: Sex lives of reptiles could leave them vulnerable to climate change\n\nUnsurprisingly, we found the gene that produces the female hormone (estrogen)\nrapidly shuts off, and genes responsible for making male hormones (androgens)\nare turned on.\n\nHundreds of other genes required for being female (including genes that make\negg components) also progressively shut down, while genes required for\nmaleness (including genes that make sperm components) turn on.\n\n## Epigenetics\n\nWe also noticed changes in the activity of developmentally important genes\nwhose roles in sex determination remain unknown. This included genes known to\n\u201cepigenetically\u201d regulate the activity of other genes.\n\nEpigenetics refers to regulation \u201cabove the gene\u201d. For example, there are many\nfish and reptile species in which the sex of developing embryos is determined\nby environmental cues, such as the temperature at which eggs are incubated.\nThe sex is not determined by different genes, but by the environment impacting\nthe activity of these genes.\n\nSimilar mechanisms regulate adult sex change in fish, so this may be important\nin translating the social cue into molecular action.\n\nSurprisingly, we saw the turn-on of some powerful genes that are active in\nembryos and stem cells. These genes keep cells in a neutral embryo-like state,\nfrom which they can mature (differentiate) into any tissue type. They can also\nrevert differentiated cells to an embryo-like state.\n\nThis suggests that transitioning from ovaries to testes in wrasse involves\nreversing the cell differentiation process \u2013 something scientists have argued\nabout for decades.\n\n## What are the advantages?\n\nResearchers have identified more than 500 fish species that regularly change\nsex as adults.\n\nClown fish begin life as males, then change into females, and kobudai do the\nopposite. Some species, including gobies, can change sex back and forth. The\ntransformation may be triggered by age, size, or social status.\n\nRead more: Climate change can tip the gender balance, but fish can tip it back\n\nSex change is an advantage when an individual\u2019s reproductive value is greater\nas one sex when it is small, and greater as the other sex when it grows\nbigger.\n\nIf females benefit more than males from being larger (because they can lay\nmore eggs), male-to-female sex change is most advantageous. But if (as for\nwrasse) males gain more from being large, because they can better defend their\nbreeding territories and mate with many females, female-to-male sex change is\noptimal.\n\nSex change might also advantage a population recovering from overfishing,\nwhich often targets larger fish and leaves the population deficient in one\nsex. Thus, a mechanism for replacing the missing sex would be an advantage.\n\n## Why can\u2019t humans change sex naturally?\n\nMale and female wrasse differ in size, colour, behaviour, but especially in\ntheir reproductive organs \u2013 the ovary and testes.\n\nSex change in the wrasse involves complete remodelling of the gonad from an\novary producing eggs to a testis producing sperm.\n\nThis differs from other fish that routinely change sex when they get big\nenough. Their gonads contain both male and female tissues, and sex change\noccurs when one outgrows the other. So, fish employ all sorts of strategies to\nget the most out of sex.\n\nIn contrast, humans and other mammals determine sex via a gene on the male-\nonly Y chromosome. This gene triggers the formation of testes in the embryo,\nwhich unleash male hormones and direct male development of the baby.\n\nRead more: What makes you a man or a woman? Geneticist Jenny Graves explains\n\nThe human sex system is nowhere near as flexible as that of fish or reptiles.\nThere is no evidence any environmental factors influence the sex determination\nof mammalian embryos, let alone cause sex change in adults.\n\nThat said, humans share with all vertebrates (including fish) about 30 genes\nthat control ovary or testis differentiation. Mutation in any of these genes\ncan tilt development toward male or female, resulting in atypical sexual\ndevelopment, but never sex change.\n\nPerhaps an understanding of epigenetic changes in fish sex can offer us\nvaluable insight, as we wrestle with new ideas about human sex and gender.\n\n  * Epigenetics\n  * Species\n  * Animal behaviour\n  * Gender dysphoria\n  * Epigenome\n  * sex change\n  * Sex chromosomes\n  * New Zealand stories\n  * Fish evolution\n  * fish habitat\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\n  * ##### Project Officer, Student Program Development\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\n  * ##### Operations Manager\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
