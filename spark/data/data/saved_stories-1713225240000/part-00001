His response amounted to saying that\nwe\u2019re doing OK but not great, which is correct. One of the bigger sins of the\neducation reform movement is that, in their zeal to prompt change at all\ncosts, they\u2019ve dramatically overinflated the problems with American schools in\ntheir rhetoric. Specifically, they tend to suggest a breadth of problems that\nwe simply have never had; our struggles are with depth, deep academic problems\nrestricted to a small portion of the overall system, found in particular\ngeographic and socioeconomic enclaves. Saying \u201cAmerican education is failing\u201d\nwas always hyperbolic and inaccurate.\n\nThe problem with American students is not a problem with the median student,\nwho could certainly do better but does pretty good. (They do very badly\nrelative to the amount that we pay, but since past a certain point there is no\nrelationship between school expenditures and student performance, it\u2019s not\nlike we should expect more for our money.) Nor would it be remotely true to\nsuggest that students in the top percentiles in our system struggle relative\nto the world at large. Our top 1% or 3% or 5% are competitive with any country\nyou\u2019d care to name; our graduates crowd the greatest universities in the\nworld, we produce a highly disproportionate number of the world\u2019s knowledge\nworkers, and American teams routinely win international academic competitions,\ndespite what Reddit seems to believe. No, our education problems are where\neverybody knows they are: in a relatively small number of places that also\nstruggle with poverty and crime, predominately in inner cities but also in\ndecaying former industrial communities and in deep rural spaces such as in\nWest Virginia and the Ozarks. I know this sounds simplistic or tautological -\nstudents who do great do great and who do badly do badly - but the point is\nthat relative to peers, there\u2019s no American education crisis until you get to\nthe bottom half of the distribution.\n\nnow\u2019s a great time to subscribe!\n\nOf course, this gloss on relative strength and weakness (good at the top,\nmiddling at the middle, bad at the bottom, relative to students at the same\nstrata from other countries) assumes that good test scores = success. I think\nthat\u2019s not a very comprehensive or coherent way to think about education, and\nI say that as someone who understands that modern educational testing is\nremarkably effective. Testing gives us information about how students perform\nrelative to some benchmark and to each other, but can\u2019t in and of itself\ndefine how well our education system functions in broader, societal terms.\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t determine success or failure until you define what\nexactly success would look like, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done that as a\nsociety. At all, really. What I constantly want to get people to do, in this\nconversation, is to think really, really specifically about what it is they\u2019re\ntrying to accomplish. When you say you want American education to get better,\nwhat does that mean? Everybody acts like the answer is obvious. I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s obvious at all.\n\nThe simplest response to that question is to say that, of course, students\nshould get smarter, and what that means materially is that quantitative\nindicators of academic performance should go up. Grades should go up. Test\nscores should go up. Graduation rates should go up. We want our kids to be\ndoing better in school! Simple! Well, OK - whose numbers should go up? Which\nkids? And they say, all the kids! Which again seems simple enough and probably\nrepresents the most intuitive definition of progress in education. But in\nfact, we\u2019re already in a big conceptual pickle here. You see, if every student\nimproves, there will be no relative (and thus social/economic) improvement for\nthose on the bottom. There\u2019s all sort of benefits that we can identify that\nmight come from everyone getting more educated. I tend to think that the\ncountry-wide economic benefits of more education are overwhelmingly\nconcentrated in the performance of the top quartile of performers, but\ncertainly there would be some positive effect on the economy and society if\neveryone did better in school. But if improvements for students at the bottom\nare matched by improvements for students at the top, the relative benefit for\nthe individual improving student will be minimal. This is not particularly\ncomplicated, but people seem to struggle to understand it.\n\nIf you ask why education is important, the average person will certainly talk\nabout personal enrichment and education as its own reward, and I will gladly\ntalk about those values too. But most of the rhetoric about our supposedly\nfailing schools is rightly concerned with the material, economic consequences\nof education - those who do well in K-12 go on to enviable colleges and from\nthere to steady and well-paying jobs, which provide the basis for a safe and\nhappy capitalist existence. School matters because kids who do well in school\ndo well in life. We have so much angst about education because there\u2019s so much\nriding on who does well in school, and a lot of kids don\u2019t do well, with clear\nand disturbing racial dynamics at play. So we want to make everyone smarter\nand thus more likely to live a good life with material security and comfort.\nAgain, OK.\n\nBut let\u2019s take a moment here. As I will go to my grave saying, what\u2019s rewarded\nin our society is not so much the absolute learning of new skills, knowledge,\nand competencies, but your relative ability in those domains. People think the\nworld works like this: you go and get trained as an electrical engineer,\nsomeone needs electrical engineer skills, they offer you a job. But how it\nactually works is that people want to hire electrical engineers of a certain\nlevel of competency relative to other electrical engineers by choosing between\nthem in a competitive process, and then pay them as little as they can while\nstill enjoying the required skills and abilities. If you aren\u2019t good enough\nrelative to peers, based on the criteria of the company that\u2019s hiring, they\nwon\u2019t hire you; if they aren\u2019t offering enough money to fit your level of\nskill, you\u2019ll let them hire someone less qualified than you. Your bargaining\nposition is based on your relative attractiveness as a candidate compared to\npeers. The top 10% of the world\u2019s electrical engineers are compensated\nextremely well. If that top 10% were taken by the Rapture tomorrow, the next\n10% would get the compensation that went to the now-disappeared 10%. Because\nwe\u2019re rewarded for our relative ability. And if all American K-12 students got\nequally better, the students at the bottom would stay at the bottom in the\nlabor market. Every student getting better leaves the distribution of\nperformance entirely unchanged.\n\nPeople act like the dynamic I\u2019m describing is some irrelevant thought\nexperiment, but that\u2019s what\u2019s actually happening, all the time! Consider the\nBlack-white educational achievement gap that\u2019s been the great education policy\nobsession for more than 40 years. On consistent metrics, Black students of\ntoday handily outperform Black students of the same age from 20 or 30 years\nago. Black students of successive generations have improved relative to those\nof the past. The trouble is that students of other races have been improving\ntoo, and so absolute improvements among Black students over time have not\nresulted in the kind of relative gains that would close the racial achievement\ngap.\n\nI\u2019ve shared this image a half-dozen times before, not because the actual data\nis important but because it\u2019s such an elegant visualization of this immensely-\nconsequential dynamic. The blue scatterplot represents mean institutional SAT\nscores correlated with mean freshman performance on a test of college\nlearning, the red line the same but with senior performance. As you can see,\nthere\u2019s robust growth from freshman to senior year in this dataset. But the\nproblem is also plain to see: even after performance gains at those colleges\nwhose students entered with low SAT scores, their students are still\nunderperforming where high-SAT students started college, and since the high-\nachieving students made gains too, there is no system-wide gap closing between\nthe schools with the lowest and highest pre-entry ability. This Zeno\u2019s\ndichotomy paradox of education is a generalizable condition throughout our\nsystem, it has massive consequences, and I find that it\u2019s barely discussed.\n\nThere\u2019s also the preliminary question of whether we actually can get everybody\nto improve in the way I\u2019m discussing. I\u2019m guessing people would assume that I\nwould be fatalistic about that question, but that\u2019s not the case. Indeed,\nthat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for ~150 years, seeing people get smarter all the\ntime. It just doesn\u2019t happen particularly quickly, and (to repeat myself) we\nhave no reason to believe that this kind of slow improvement in educational\noutcomes over time could reduce the relative gaps that produce bad social\noutcomes. Since everybody\u2019s getting better, relative gaps don\u2019t close. We\nwould want that, though, right? To close relative gaps? In many instances,\nyes. In the broadest terms, no, which leads to the next point.\n\nSome people say what we want is educational equality. Equality, that\u2019s the\nticket, that\u2019s what we want. (This is genuinely something people tell me, that\nthe goal is some such state called educational equality.) I don\u2019t think it\nshould be hard to poke holes in this. Among other things, actual educational\nequality, where every student performs exactly the same, ensures that there is\nno excellence. Again, this is not a meaningless thought exercise. You can see\nthis exact tension at play in recent (deeply misguided) efforts to prevent\nstudents from taking algebra in middle school, based on the reasoning that\nsome students taking algebra while others don\u2019t increases racial inequality.\nThat kind of heavy-handed effort can\u2019t actually create equality, in the real\nworld, and if it could it would be an equality achieved entirely by\nrestricting the flourishing of students at the top. This is the easiest way to\nclose the racial achievement gap, criminalizing sending white and Asian kids\nto school, but it\u2019s all pulling down, no pulling up. All else aside, the\nachievement of educational equality would always result in erosion of\nexcellence in one way or another. Perhaps if everyone was equal at the highest\nrung of achievement - whatever that could mean absent relative benchmarks - we\ncould call that excellence. But, of course, we can\u2019t achieve that kind of\nequality, at the top level of performance or any other. Because not all\nstudents are created equal.\n\nAha! They say. Not all individual students created equal, but all\nraces/genders/ethnicities/socioeconomic classes/etc. created equal in the\nclassroom! This is the perspective that says that the goal is to ensure\nproportional representation across different demographic groups, so that both\nmale and female students make up half of the top 10 in a given high school\nclass, so that the 13ish% of K-12 students who are Black end up being 13ish%\nof college graduates, so that poor kids are found in elite academic spaces in\nproportion with their overall numbers. And of course I would like to be able\nto snap my fingers and bring such a world into existence by magic. But\nproportional representation leads to the dilemma that (you knew this was\ncoming) inspired my first book. The trouble with proportional representation\nis that, while it helps ameliorate certain obvious social injustices, it still\nleaves 20% of the population in the bottom quintile of every performance\ndistribution. That bottom 20% may now represent a perfectly diverse rainbow,\nbut the people stuck in it are still fucked. One of the early title ideas I\nthought of for the book was After the Achievement Gap, which honestly maybe I\nshould have gone with. The point is simple: closing the racial achievement gap\nhas been such an all-consuming policy fixation for so long that the basic\nquestion \u201cWhat can and should we do for the students who are simply\nuntalented?\u201d has gone ignored. You could tell a student who finds themselves\nin the bottom decile, \u201cGood news, the system is proportional now!\u201d But they\u2019re\nstill going to struggle for the rest of their lives.\n\n(The critics who complained that the book must have endorsed pseudoscientific\nracism when it didn\u2019t, and the \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d people who made fun of me\nfor not endorsing pseudoscientific racism, both tried to force me into exactly\nthe straightjacket I was refusing to wear: considering education only in terms\nof group inequalities rather than in differences between individuals, the\nconsequences of those differences, and what we as a society owe to those on\nthe bottom of the performance spectrum who suffer because of it.)\n\nFinally, you have what may be the most superficially attractive goal of all,\nequality of educational opportunity. In this formulation, we don\u2019t concern\nourselves with who succeeds or fails, only with whether everyone has an equal\nshot at success in the classroom. Well, I\u2019ve been documenting problems with\nthe concept of equality of opportunity in society writ large my whole career,\nand if anything those problems are even more acute when we look at education\nspecifically.\n\n  * Equality of opportunity is often suggested as a more achievable, realistic alternative to equality of outcome, but in fact since any difference at all can be represented as an inequality, and because there is no limit to the number of influences and factors which could prevent true equality of educational opportunity, the demand is revealed to be quite extravagant.\n\n  * Knowing when we\u2019ve achieved equality of opportunity is close to impossible. I can tell you if everybody falls within X income range, has Y wealth, enjoys Z material condition. I have no idea how to tell if equality of opportunity has been achieved, because (again) the number of influences that contribute to equality of opportunity are endless. And to the people who struggle, minor influences are going to frequently appear very consequential indeed.\n\n  * Once we acknowledge that literally any difference in condition amounts to an inequality in opportunity, we must recognize that equality of opportunity and equality of outcome are one and the same - the only way you\u2019d ever achieve equality of opportunity is if you had created identical lived circumstances, which is another way to say... equality of outcome.\n\n  * If we acknowledge that there is any inherent element to academic talent at all, whether from genetic influence of any other, we are confronted with the question of including that inherent influence within the definition of equality of outcome (in which case we can\u2019t achieve it) or excluding it (in which case we\u2019re blaming individual people for their lack of inherent talent, which they can\u2019t control, which doesn\u2019t seem very equal at all.)\n\nI could go on. In general the concept of equality of opportunity either\nrequires a belief that human beings have no inherent strengths and weaknesses,\nwhich no one believes, or it requires comfort with people suffering because of\nthose strengths and weaknesses when they can\u2019t control them, which seems to\nundermine the very purpose of equal opportunity and which most people in\ncontemporary times won\u2019t get on board with. It\u2019s not an easy nut to crack.\n\nOf course, there are practical syntheses of these possibilities, and I suspect\nthat most people are comfortable muddling along in that way. Certainly you can\nsay that you want the bottom to get closer to the median (accepting that this\nwill move the median...) while hoping that racial inequalities are eased as\nracial averages grow closer, all against a backdrop of system-wide\nimprovements relative to criterion references and benchmarks. To which we\nwould have to say \u201cand a pony!,\u201d but it\u2019s not an unattractive kludge. People\nwill go to considerable lengths to try and reconcile various tensions in their\neducation thinking, on the fly. I get a lot of this; when I point out that\nimproving things for students at the bottom requires that they perform better\nrelative to peers above them, and also that smart kids keep learning which\nmakes that harder, I get notions like \u201cwell, if the curve just had a heavy\nleft skews....\u201d I think that you can get into philosophical questions about\nwhat it means for the median to move in that way, but let\u2019s not. Muddling\nthrough with a general goal of improving outcomes for everyone while\nmaintaining a special focus on shrinking racial gaps is pragmatically\nsufficient; you could do worse. But since the education reform crowd has\nembraced absurdly outsized goals and soaring rhetoric for decades, they\u2019ve\nbitten off more than they can chew conceptually, and they haven\u2019t really\ngrappled with the consequences.\n\nI think it\u2019s very valuable to press people for what they think represents\nsuccess in education, in mundane terms. Because it\u2019s not as intuitive as they\nthink.\n\n### Subscribe to Freddie deBoer\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\ncool but rude\n\n97 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n8 Restacks\n\n97\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What Would Success Look Like in American Education?\n\nfreddiedeboer.substack.com\n\n109\n\nShare\n\n109 Comments\n\nAJKamper7 hrs agoWe just moved into a lovely little mini-neighborhood just a\nfew blocks south of downtown Saint Paul.

If you handed every student in America a PhD in a STEM field, there'd be\nnowhere for most of them to go. There are only so many of those positions to\ngo around, and no amount of schooling will change that. It's all pure\nneoliberal ideology, maybe with a human face, but neoliberal ideology just the\nsame.The better solution would be to change society so you could live a\nperfectly comfortable life just doing lower level jobs. I got a literature\ndegree the first time around in college, and I never tire of pointing out that\nif college was less expensive and wages were higher it would be totally fine\nto just learn about things you liked and enjoyed. What a wonderful world that\nwould be. Instead, with tuition and employment prospects being what they are,\nevery single aspect of the education system is tailored towards making sure\nyou have the best chances to get one of the dwindling number of high income\npositions available. Everyone loves talking about education reform, but you\ncan't consider education on its own. It is absolutely a product of society on\nthe whole and has all the same problems. Gyorgy Luckas had that whole thing\nabout how the most defining aspect of the Marxist perspective was looking at\nsociety as a totality, on the whole. How all the different parts functioned as\npart of a larger system, and that's applicable here.Expand full commentLike\n(19)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\n107 more comments...\n\nPlease Just Fucking Tell Me What Term I Am Allowed to Use for the Sweeping\nSocial and Political Changes You Demand\n\nyou don't get to insist that no one talks about your political project and\nit's weak and pathetic that you think you do\n\nNov 8, 2021 \u2022\n\nFreddie deBoer\n\n890\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Please Just Fucking Tell Me What Term I Am Allowed to Use for the\nSweeping Social and Political Changes You Demand\n\nfreddiedeboer.substack.com\n\n358\n\nIf Michael Jordan Played In Today's NBA, He'd...
