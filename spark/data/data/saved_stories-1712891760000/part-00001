Her book\u2019s first main\nlesson is that family resemblance, defined in the broadest possible way to\ninclude physical, psychological, and social outcomes, is mostly driven by\ngenetics rather than upbringing. Her book\u2019s second main lesson, though, is\nthat children\u2019s peers explain a large share of remaining variation \u2014 defined,\nagain, in the broadest possible way to include physical, psychological, and\nsocial outcomes.\n\nAlmost everyone takes Harris\u2019 two lessons as a package deal. Her fans\ntypically believe that genetics and peers matter a lot, while critics stick\nwith the conventional view that parenting is what really counts. My view, in\ncontrast, is that the very evidence that Harris uses to establish her first\nlesson undermines her second lesson.\n\nWhy? Let\u2019s back up. Behavioral geneticists partition human variation into\nthree categories. The first is heredity. The second is family environment. The\nthird is a pure residual, usually just called \u201cnon-shared environment\u201d or\n\u201cnon-family environment.\u201d Mathematically, these shares must sum to 1. If\nheredity\u2019s share of the variance is .7 and family environment\u2019s share is .1,\nthen non-shared environment has to equal .2.\n\nIf you\u2019re trained in philosophy, you may be tempted to pose counter-examples.\nSuppose that (a) beauty is 100% hereditary, and (b) the sole cause of human\nhappiness is being perceived by the people in your environment as beautiful.\nSo is variation in happiness 100% hereditary, 100% environmental, or what?\nBehavioral geneticists answer in this scenario, by construction, is: 100%\nhereditary. Why? Because they\u2019re analyzing observed variation, not variation\nin all conceivable worlds. If heredity fully explains trait A, which interacts\nwith a complex environment to produce trait B, the math says that heredity\nfully explains trait B as well. Harris is fully aware of this point:\n\n> Direct genetic effects have consequences of their own, which I call indirect\n> genetic effects \u2014 the effects of the effects of the genes. A child's\n> timidity causes his mother to reassure him, his sister to make fun of him,\n> and his peers to pick on him. A child's beauty causes her parents to dote on\n> her and wins her a wide circle of admiring friends. These are indirect\n> genetic effects. Identical twins lead similar lives because of indirect\n> genetic effects. (The Nurture Assumption)\n\nBy construction, behavioral geneticists\u2019 categories partition logical space.\nVariation explained by hereditary is \u201cEverything caused either directly or\nindirectly by genes.\u201d There are multiple ways to calculate this statistic for\na trait, but the simplest is just the phenotypic correlation between identical\ntwins raised apart. When researchers do these calculations, they usually come\nup with numbers between .4 and .8, depending on the trait.\n\nVariation explained by shared environment, similarly, is \u201cEverything caused\neither directly or indirectly by family environment.\u201d There are multiple ways\nto calculate this statistic for a trait, but the simplest is just the\nphenotypic correlation between biologically unrelated adoptees raised\ntogether. When researchers do these calculations, they usually come up with\nnumbers between 0 and .2, depending, again, on the trait.*\n\nTaken together, these estimates are the foundation for Harris\u2019 first main\nlesson. Nature crushes nurture, at least in the First World in the long-run.\n\nHer evidence for her second main lesson, however, is much more diffuse.\nBehavioral geneticists show that non-shared environment usually ranges from .2\nto .4, so we know there is much more to observed variation than either nature\nor nurture. If nurture is environment inside the home, non-shared environment\nwould be stuff outside the home. Common sense suggests that children\u2019s peer\ngroup is an important chunk of this extra-familial environment, and Harris\nfinds a lot of supportive interdisciplinary research.\n\nWhile this sounds ever-so-plausible, there\u2019s one dire problem: \u201cThe effects of\nthe effects of family environment\u201d count as family environment \u2014 and family\nenvironment plainly has a massive effect on your peer group.\n\nTake Sacerdote\u2019s famous Korean adoption study. Some orphans got randomly\nassigned to rich families, while others were randomly assigned to families\nonly modestly above the poverty line. The first group mostly grew up in rich\nneighborhoods with good schools, low crime, and rich peers. The latter group\nmostly grew up in much poorer neighborhoods with worse schools, higher crime,\nand poorer peers.\n\nIf peers had a large effect, the measured effect of shared family environment\nwould be large. Even if the direct effect of a rich family were zero. Since\nestimates for shared family environment are in fact low, we must conclude that\npeers don\u2019t have a large effect. QED.**\n\nAs usual, to repeat, we must remember that if we drastically broadened the\nsample, this result could change. Within the observed range, adoptive American\nfamilies\u2019 incomes had little effect on Korean orphans\u2019 adult outcomes. But\ngrowing up in America rather than Korea obviously had a massive effect on the\nadoptees\u2019 fluency in English versus Korean.\n\nHarris\u2019 most compelling examples of powerful peer effects fit the same mold.\nThey\u2019re not wrong, just outside the observed range she trying to explain.\n\n> I know a Jewish woman whose Orthodox grandparents immigrated to the United\n> States from Poland and then took their children back to Poland when they saw\n> them turning into godless Americans. The grandparents and all but one of\n> their children perished in the Holocaust.\n>\n> It is possible for Orthodox parents to rear children in the United States\n> without having them turn into godless Americans. In Brooklyn, New York,\n> there are Hasidic Jews who have preserved the religion, customs, and even\n> styles of dress and adornment that came from Eastern Europe several\n> generations ago. The way they do it is to educate the children themselves.\n> The children go to religious schools called yeshivas; they do not mingle\n> with children from other cultures either in school (where all the children\n> are offspring of Hasidic Jews) or in the neighborhood (most of their\n> neighbors are also Hasidic Jews). (The Nurture Assumption)\n\nIf Harris is wrong to think that peers have large effects, what does explain\nthe big residual of behavioral genetics? Why are identical twins raised\ntogether still so different in so many ways? Harris\u2019 follow-up book, No Two\nAlike, tried and failed to resolve this puzzle. The real story, I suspect, is\nthat many small factors add up \u2014 and we should never discount the awesome\nmetaphysical power of free will.\n\nWhatever the answer may be, though, Harris didn\u2019t just fail to show that peers\nare the crucial factor. Indeed, the very evidence she used to show that\nnurture is weak shows that peer effects are weaker still.\n\n* Crucial caveat: All of this research uses First World data. Using global data, heredity would almost certainly matter much less because global environments vary so much more.\n\n** As Harris knew, genes can also easily affect peers. A math genius is likely\nto make friends with fellow math geniuses. My point is not that all peer\neffects count as family environment, but that family environment definitely\nhas a large effect on peer effects.\n\n### Subscribe to Bet On It\n\nBy Bryan Caplan \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nCaplan and Candor\n\n42 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n5 Restacks\n\n42\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Harris\u2019 Major Malfunction\n\nwww.betonit.ai\n\n21\n\nShare\n\n21 Comments\n\nRichard Y ChappellGood ThoughtsApr 8\u00b7edited Apr 8So perhaps a clearer three-\nway partition (assuming that basically all significant environmental\ninfluences are themselves influenced by family environment) would be:1\\.\nHeredity2\\.

A >> B.Even your contention that family environment determines\npeer group (again, it\u2019s a purely semantic criticism. When people are talking\nabout family environment, choosing where or in what subculture to raise their\nkids isn\u2019t what they have in mind) can be flipped: your decision to raise your\nkids in an orthodox Jewish community is determined more by the fact that you\ngrew up around orthodox Jewish peers. Peer effects therefore determine family\nenvironment. Thinking about it intergenerationally, it\u2019s arbitrary of course\nwhich one is said to cause the other, basically a chicken or egg question.\nWhich is why it\u2019s only meaningful to compare the two in the sense of comparing\nwhich has a higher coefficient on outcome controlling for the other one.Expand\nfull commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n19 more comments...\n\nExplaining the LGBT Explosion\n\nWikipedia's article on \"Acquired Homosexuality\" begins: Acquired homosexuality\nis the discredited idea that homosexuality can be spread, either through...\n\nApr 7, 2022 \u2022\n\nBryan Caplan\n\n134\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Explaining the LGBT Explosion\n\nwww.betonit.ai\n\n164\n\nShe's the One\n\nMeasuring female marriageability\n\nJul 31, 2023 \u2022\n\nBryan Caplan\n\n218\n\nShare this post\n\n#### She's the One\n\nwww.betonit.ai\n\n58\n\nDo Ten Times as Much\n\nUnpleasant advice that works\n\nJun 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nBryan Caplan\n\n234\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Do Ten Times as Much\n\nwww.betonit.ai\n\n48\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bryan Caplan\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
