The analysis unveiled that 908\nprojects failed to meet one or more fundamental security measures. These\ninclude locked liquidity, verified contracts, and the absence of honeypots.\n\nThis lack of security could stem from creators\u2019 ignorance of proper procedures\nor an attempt to troll the sector.\n\nDavid Schwed, Halborn\u2019s Director of Operations, highlighted the challenge\nposed by projects lacking resources to hire security experts or undergo\nindependent assessments. Many projects exacerbate the situation further by\ncopying existing tokens, thus perpetuating risks.\n\n\u201cThe trend of these projects being forks of existing projects or generated\nthrough AI means they often inherit vulnerabilities or introduce new ones,\u201d\nSchwed affirmed.\n\nMoreover, conditions such as exaggerated \u201ctaxes\u201d on sales have raised\nsuspicions that 17% of memecoins on Base are genuine scams. While not all\nprojects with extreme marketing campaigns are scams, they cast doubts on their\nlegitimacy.\n\n### The Divisive Trend of Meme Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe meme cryptocurrency craze continues to divide the industry. Some have\ncriticized the lack of utility and high scam rates. In contrast, others view\nmemecoins as a means to onboard new investors into the space.\n\nFor instance, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, sees the playful nature\nof memecoins as a potential avenue for beneficial outcomes.\n\nHe highlighted cases where benevolent coins have supported anti-aging research\nand cultural efforts, showcasing how memecoins can contribute to meaningful\ncauses.\n\n\u201cI value people\u2019s desire to have fun, and I would prefer to see the\ncryptocurrency space somehow swim with this current rather than against it.\nAnd that\u2019s why I want to see higher-quality fun projects that positively\ncontribute to the ecosystem and the world around them (and not just\n\u2018attracting users\u2019) get more attention,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\n### The Growing Importance of Real Value\n\nAs the meme phenomenon grows, the significance of real value, security\nmeasures, and investor vigilance becomes increasingly evident.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe prevalence of security vulnerabilities among memecoins on the Coinbase\nBase platform underscores the importance of due diligence and caution in the\ncryptocurrency space. While the allure of meme cryptocurrencies may be\nenticing, investors must remain vigilant and prioritize projects with real\nvalue and robust security measures. As the industry evolves, it is crucial for\ncreators and investors alike to prioritize transparency, legitimacy, and\nresponsible innovation to ensure the long-term viability and integrity of the\ncryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n#### FAQs\n\n1\\.
