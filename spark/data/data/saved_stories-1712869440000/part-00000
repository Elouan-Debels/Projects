Simpson\nhimself posted a video on X that day, denying rumors that he was in hospice\ncare, though he did not otherwise confirm or deny reports that he was ill. Two\ndays later in another video update on X, Simpson thanked those people he said\nhad reached out to him, adding \"My health is good. I mean, obviously I'm\ndealing with some issues but I think I'm just about over it.\"\n\nSimpson, nicknamed \"The Juice,\" broke records as a college and professional\nfootball player, and extended his celebrity and fortune as a sportscaster, a\nmovie and television actor, and as a corporate spokesman, most notably for\nHertz rental cars.\n\nO.

Within\ndays, police announced their intention to arrest the former football star for\nthe murders.\n\nFive days after the killings, 95 million Americans watched as Simpson's white\nFord Bronco \u2013 with longtime friend Al Cowlings at the wheel and Simpson in the\nback seat with a handgun, threatening to kill himself \u2013 led police on a\n60-mile, low-speed televised chase through Los Angeles that lasted some two\nhours.\n\n### MORE: 26 years ago, OJ Simpson was acquitted: Timeline of his life and the\nsensational trial\n\nSimpson ultimately surrendered to police and stood trial for the murders. In\nOctober 1995, after 11 months from jury selection to verdict, Simpson was\nacquitted in a trial that was televised daily and became an international\nsensation.\n\nTwelve years later, Simpson was arrested in September 2007 after he led a\ngroup of men into a Las Vegas hotel and casino to steal, at gunpoint, what he\nclaims was his own sports memorabilia. Simpson was charged with a number of\nfelony counts, including kidnapping and armed robbery. The following year, he\nwas found guilty and sentenced to up to 33 years in prison. Simpson was\nreleased on parole on Oct. 1, 2017.\n\nO.J. Simpson is survived by four children: Arnelle and Jason, from his first\nmarriage, and Sydney and Justin, from his marriage to Nicole Brown Simpson.\n\n### A football hero\n\nSimpson was born on July 9, 1947, and raised in Potrero Hill, a low-income\nneighborhood near San Francisco. His mother, Eunice, worked as an orderly at a\npsychiatric ward, and his father, Jimmy Lee, worked as a cook and custodian in\na private club. When Simpson was just a toddler, his father left the family,\nleaving Simpson's mother to raise and support their four children on her own.\n\nDespite being bow-legged and pigeon-toed from a bout with rickets in infancy,\naccording to ESPN, Simpson developed a strong interest in sports as a child.\nIn the spring of 1967, he enrolled at the University of Southern California in\nLos Angeles, and that same year he married his high school sweetheart,\nMarguerite Whitley, with whom he eventually had three children.\n\nO.J.

By the time he left the school, he had set 13 college football\nrecords and had won the 1968 Heisman Trophy.\n\nThe charismatic young star athlete's television career took off like a rocket.\nOn the night he won the Heisman, Simpson signed a television contract with ABC\nSports. The following year, Simpson was the first pick in the 1969 draft,\nsigning with the Buffalo Bills for a then-record $650,000, five-year contract.\nBy 1973, Simpson had scored an NFL-record 23 touchdowns in a season.

In 1975,\nHertz signed Simpson as the first Black man hired for a major national\ncorporate advertising campaign, with soon-familiar commercials of him, smiling\nand clad in business suit, running through airports and leaping over obstacles\nto get to his rental car. The success of the ad campaign led other\ncorporations to sign endorsement contracts with Simpson, increasing both his\nwealth and name recognition.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills traded Simpson to the San Francisco 49ers prior to the 1978\nseason, prompting him to move with his family to the West Coast, though after\ntwo seasons with the team, physical problems prompted Simpson to retire from\npro football as the highest-paid player in the NFL.\n\nSimpson had acted during his pro football years, notably appearing in the TV\nminiseries \"Roots,\" as well as the films \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"Capricorn\nOne\" and others. Around the same time he retired from the NFL, he created his\nown production company and dove into the entertainment business full time. He\ncontinued acting, including as a regular in the \"Naked Gun\" film comedy\nseries, and also served as a TV football commentator.\n\n### Meeting Nicole Brown\n\nWhile still married to Marguerite, Simpson met Nicole Brown, then 18, while\nshe worked as a nightclub waitress in Beverly Hills in 1977. It was the same\nyear Simpson and Marguerite celebrated the arrival of their daughter, Aaren,\nand moved into a Tudor-style mansion in the Brentwood neighborhood of LA.

Prosecutors also presented blood from the crime scene found in\nSimpson's car and home, and the fact that he went unaccounted for more than an\nhour on the night of the murders.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of the trial came when prosecutors asked\nSimpson to try on a pair of black leather gloves in front of the jury and an\ninternational television audience. One glove had been discovered at the crime\nscene and the second had been found at Simpson's home. The gloves didn't\nappear to fit properly, which the prosecution later attributed to shrinkage\nfrom their original size caused by their having been soaked in blood.\nRegardless, when Simpson struggled to don the gloves, defense attorney Johnnie\nCochran issued the trial's most memorable declaration during his closing\nargument: \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.\"\n\nO.J.

Following his acquittal,\nSimpson publicly vowed to spend the rest of his life searching for what he\ncalled the \"real\" killer or killers.\n\nDespite the acquittal, Simpson soon found himself shunned in many of his\nprevious social circles. His longtime agents dropped him and many corporations\nno longer wanted his endorsement. Simpson's credibility and earning power\ndisintegrated virtually overnight. By 2000, Simpson had moved from Los Angeles\nto Miami, Florida.\n\nThough he was acquitted of criminal charges, the families of Nicole Brown\nSimpson and Ron Goldman filed a civil suit against Simpson \u2013 the former for\nbattery, and the latter for battery and wrongful death. Unlike the criminal\ntrial, no cameras were allowed in court during the civil trial, which lasted\njust over three months and ended in February 1997 with the jury unanimously\nfinding Simpson liable as alleged.\n\nFred and Kim Goldman, father and sister of Ronald Goldman, appear in\nfro...Show more ---\n\nLee Celano/WireImage\n\nSimpson was ordered to pay a total of $21 million to the Goldman family and\n$12.5 million to the Brown family, for a total of $33.5 million in\ncompensatory and punitive damages. Despite years of efforts, the families were\nonly able to collect from Simpson a fraction of the damages the jury awarded.\n\nIn 2006, a ghostwritten book titled \"If I Did It,\" described by the publisher\nas a \"hypothetical\" confession and said to be based on interviews with\nSimpson, was scheduled to be published in conjunction with a TV special that\nwould also feature Simpson. The special was cancelled following widespread\ncriticism, and the family of Ron Goldman \u2013 still pursuing the unpaid monetary\ndamages awarded them in Simpson's civil trial \u2013 was awarded the rights to the\nbook, which they retitled and published as \"If I Did It: Confessions of the\nKiller.\"\n\n### Conviction for robbery and kidnapping\n\nThe night of Sept. 13, 2007, Simpson led a group of men \u2013 one of whom was\narmed with a handgun \u2013 into a Las Vegas hotel room to recover what Simpson\nclaimed was sports memorabilia that had been stolen from him. He was arrested\nthree days later and charged with 12 felony counts, including kidnapping and\narmed robbery.

He moved from Miami to Las Vegas and\ncommenced a lifestyle focused on golf, friends and regular posts to social\nmedia.\n\nIn the 1994 letter Simpson's lawyers read to the nation while the former\nfootball star fled police during the Bronco chase, Simpson expressed\nsatisfaction with the life he'd lived until that point.\n\n\"I've had a good life. I'm proud of how I lived. My mama taught me to do unto\nothers. I treated people the way I wanted to be treated,\" Simpson wrote,\naccording to his attorneys.\n\n\"Don't feel sorry for me,\" the letter went on. \"I've had a great life, great\nfriends.
