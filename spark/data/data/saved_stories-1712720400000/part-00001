It was not good or bad\nto be an elitist hardo or a humble normie: any personal reaction we had to a\ngiven quadrant was simply a reflection of our own egos.\n\nMany of my friends could be described as \u201cextreme\u201d relative to what might be\nconsidered normal (whatever that is), and so we as a group agreed that \u201chumble\nhardo\u201d was the aspirational quadrant, even if we didn\u2019t always manage to\nachieve our place in it.\n\nRead full story\n\nAfter more reflection, I\u2019ve decided I was too forgiving with my relativism.\nI\u2019d like to make a value judgement: I believe that being a hardo, or a try-\nhard, or a sweat, is good, actually.\n\nAs I continue my journey in life, the differentiating factor in people\u2019s\nsuccess that I see most is, increasingly, the amount of effort that an\nindividual is willing to put into whatever endeavor they are pursuing.\n\nNatural talent matters a lot, yes. I\u2019m pretty sharp, but I\u2019m confident I\u2019m\nnever going to make any novel contributions to the field of physics. Likewise,\nI\u2019m in decent shape but I\u2019m not going to win any marathons. Those upper\nechelons of achievement do require a degree of innate ability. But whether\nyou\u2019re looking at professional accolades, athletic achievements, creative\noutput, interpersonal relationships\u2014really, in anything that matters at\nall\u2014effort dominates the outcomes of those around me. Determination and grit\nare two of the most powerful virtues you can develop because they\u2019re purely a\nfunction of how much you\u2019re willing to keep trying hard.\n\nThe ubiquity of the disparagement of effort across all of these domains points\nto effort\u2019s efficacy. Trying hard works. It isn\u2019t easy to try hard, but anyone\ncan do it. That\u2019s why people demean it: they\u2019re trying to handle the\ndissonance of why they aren\u2019t putting in the effort they could be.\n\nNow, of course, I will hedge a bit. People have different priorities and are\ndoing activities for different reasons. You can, and should, do things\ncasually. The effort dial doesn\u2019t need to to be turned to 11 all of the time.\nBut just as that\u2019s true, it\u2019s not right to demean people for caring about\nthings and investing commensurate effort into the things they care about.\n\nFor that reason, the next time I walk into the office on a Monday and my\ncoworkers call me a hardo after seeing my weekend\u2014or morning, for that\nmatter\u2014Strava posts, I will wear that label like a badge of honor. And for my\npart, I will do my best to stop calling skimo racers hardos (like the slur).\n\n### Subscribe to Passing Time\n\nBy Michael Bateman \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\nTime is your most valuable asset.

When you\nare competing internally rather than globally, within a small environment such\nthat your attitudes can affect the entire group, conspicuous non-effort is\nboth an attempt to form a collective agreement to reduce the level of\ncompetition, and a type of stotting if you can perform well despite \u201cnot\ntrying\u201d. Another way that the formal education system maladapts you for real\nlife.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Michael Bateman\n\nDavid SasakiThe Time Capsule23 hrs agoLiked by Michael BatemanKnowing what I\nknow now, if I were given the choice at birth between getting talent or\ndetermination, I\u2019d choose determination every time.I am such a try-hard.
