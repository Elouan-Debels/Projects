In the post, I don\u2019t claim to\npredict the future, but I do say that \u201c... there\u2019s an argument to be made for\nthis being a good forecast of the future conditional on the U.S. actually\ngrowing.\u201d\n\nI think this claim stands. Assuming that the process that produced the\ncorrelation continues to operate in the future, the trend will hold at higher\npopulations. It doesn\u2019t matter what the causal relationship is for the\nforecast to work. Cumulative U.S. Nobel laureates and cumulative U.S. gold\nmedalists are probably pretty correlated, because both series grow linearly\nwith time. It\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s a direct causal effect, but we can still\nforecast things into the future just fine.\n\n##\n\nResearch on the relationship between population and wealth\n\nThe correlation alone isn\u2019t enough, we want to know something about the causal\nrelationship between wealth and population in order to inform policy.\n\nAfter looking at the literature more, there\u2019s a clear bifurcation between\ntheory and experiment. In growth theory, it\u2019s pretty common to assert that\npopulation plays at least some role in driving innovation. But empirically,\nthe situation is messier. From this review:\n\n> Regarding causality (Granger causality), a diverse range of outcomes is\n> observed.\n>\n> (1) p \u2192 y, unidirectional causality, population growth stimulates economic\n> growth: Darrat et al. (1999), Yao et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2013), Ali et\n> al. (2013), Furuoka (2013), Musa (2015) and Sebikabu et al. (2020).\n>\n> (2) y \u2192 p, unidirectional causality, economic growth stimulates population\n> to grow: Nakibulla (1998).\n>\n> (3) p <=> y, bidirectional causality, population growth stimulates and is\n> stimulated by economic growth: Garza-Rodriguez et al.

(2018) and Furuoka (2018).\n>\n> (4) Noncausality, population growth neither stimulates nor is stimulated by\n> economic growth: Dawson and Tiffin (1998), Thornton (2001) and Mulok et al.\n> (2011).\n>\n> (5) Mixed results: Jung and Quddus (1986), Kapuria-Foreman (1995), Tsen and\n> Furuoka (2005) and Chang et al. (2017)\n\nIt\u2019s also informative to break down population growth down into growth from\nimmigration and growth from fertility.\n\nFor immigration, there\u2019s a consensus among economists that both high-skilled\nand low-skilled immigration is good for U.S. citizens. The literature finds\ngenerally positive impacts of immigration on local economies in the U.S.\n\nFor fertility, I haven\u2019t been able to find research that looks at how\nfertility causally effects long term growth34. I\u2019m tempted to say that babies\ntoday are just immigrants from the future, meaning that their impacts on the\nlocal economy should be similar to that of immigrants, just displaced in time\nby 20 years. But things get more complicated when you consider the time\nparents spend raising their children, which temporarily reduces their\nproductivity. For now, I\u2019m going to assume that native fertility also boosts\nlocal economies in developed countries until I see evidence to the contrary.\n\n##\n\nCausality and policy\n\nSo the empirical data is messy, let\u2019s list the possible causal relationships\nbetween population and wealth:\n\n  1. Population causes wealth.\n\n  2. Wealth causes population\n\n  3. Population and wealth cause each other\n\n  4. Some other variable causes both\n\n  5. There\u2019s no relationship whatsoever between the two\n\nThat being said, its hard to make the case that 4 and 5 are true and that\npopulation has no effect on wealth at all. To steelman the argument, I can\nthink of two theories where this might be the case:\n\nThe Hephaestus model where only a fixed number of researchers contribute to\ninnovation at a given time. Perhaps only the 100 most talented researchers\ndrive virtually all of the innovation, regardless of the size of the\npopulation. Norman Borlaug could be one example.\n\nI'm pretty skeptical of this story, for one, the number of researchers has\nbeen increasing for a long time, how could they have no impact? For another,\nour fixed set of innovators would have to increase in productivity over time\nto keep raising per capita GDP for a larger and larger population. This isn\u2019t\nconsistent with data showing that research productivity has declined5.\n\nTechnological determinism is another possibility. Perhaps technology marches\nto the beat of its own drum: one innovation follows another in a natural\nprogression. When the time is right, someone discovers electricity, a\npredetermined time later someone invents the lightbulb, and after that someone\nfigures out how to manufacture lightbulbs at scale. It doesn\u2019t matter who does\nwhat, discoveries will occur when the time is right. The steady pace of\nprogress would cause both population and wealth to rise in lockstep without\nany causal relationship between them.\n\nI think this is more plausible and one argument in its favor is multiple\ndiscovery, evidence that some ideas are simply \u201cin the water supply\u201d and arise\nnaturally within a particular context. You can also see a steady progression\nwithin an established field like semiconductor manufacturing, where low-\nhanging fruit gets picked and the industry collectively moves on to other\nideas in a relatively predictable fashion.\n\nBut this can\u2019t be the whole story, since many of our most important inventions\ncame from intentionally investing a lot of effort, such as Haber-Bosch, high-\nyield wheat, nuclear weapons, and Moore\u2019s law. Perhaps the timing of these\nefforts was predestined, but we had to actually throw more people and money at\nthe problem to get a result.\n\nRegardless, the technological determinism story can\u2019t be used to argue against\npopulation growth policy. Even if we granted that innovation happens\nindependent of population, we might as well let the population grow; it won\u2019t\nharm wealth.\n\nIn fact, notice that all the options except 2 recommend population growth\npolicy. If 1 or 3 are true, then we can get both by boosting the population.\nIf 4 or 5 are true, then we can boost population without effecting wealth,\nwhich is still a good thing (see footnote 1).\n\nSo let\u2019s focus on option 2. If wealth drives growth, external increases in\npopulation could potentially reverse the correlation between the two and make\neveryone poorer. Something like this was true in Malthusian eras of the past;\ntemporary increases in crop yields led to more children being born which lead\nto deaths of starvation when yields regressed to the mean6.\n\nWhat about today? Let\u2019s once again break population growth down into growth\nfrom immigration and growth from fertility.\n\nSetting aside the previous discussion of the benefits of immigration, can\nwealth also cause immigration? Some papers do find that rising wealth also\ncauses more immigration to a country. But while rising wealth causes more\npeople to want to immigrate to a country, policy determines how many actually\ndo. In recent decades, immigration rate to the U.S. has been falling even as\nRGDP per capita increases. It\u2019s hard to make the case that wealth causes more\nimmigration if this trend continues.\n\nWhat about fertility? Does wealth cause more births? In practice, richer\ncountries tend to have lower fertility and fertility falls as countries grow\nricher over time. At the micro level it seems intuitive that wealthier parents\nwould have more children, but instead we see lower fertility at higher income\nlevels. Like with immigration, it\u2019s hard to argue that wealth causes higher\nfertility when the two are inversely correlated.\n\nTaken together, these facts make it unlikely that option 2 is the dominant\ncontributor to the correlation between population and wealth. This leaves us\nwith options 1, 3, and 4, which suggests that population causes wealth to some\ndegree.\n\n##\n\nConclusion\n\nThe correlation between population and wealth remains a mystery. Will the\nforecast hold? What is the causal relationship between wealth and population?\nWe could devote an entire book to these topics, but we already have enough\ninformation to take a stance on policy.\n\nWith falling fertility, we have two choices: intervene to try to return to\npopulation growth or allow the population to stagnate. Pro-growth policies\nprobably won\u2019t cause per capita GDP to fall, which means that sustainable\nincreases in fertility and immigration in the U.S. are a good idea long\nterm78. Better yet, pursuing population growth and economic growth\nsimultaneously would address concerns that we have the arrow of causation\nbackwards.\n\nWill policy intervention destroy the fortuitous correlation between population\nand wealth? Perhaps. But historically, the relationship between the two has\nbeen robust to shocks such as legislation, generational shifts, war, and mass\nmigration. It\u2019s unlikely that small policy changes will have an impact9.\n\nEven accepting the value of population growth, some argue that there\u2019s no need\nto grow the U.S. population since it\u2019s really world population that drives\ninnovation, not the population of a particular country. This is less true than\nwe might hope. The U.S. produces a disproportionate amount of global\ninnovation and moving to the U.S. directly causes people to be more\nproductive. Technology has to be passed down through training for it to be\neffective and without a way to pass down tacit knowledge, technology can get\nlost. Just look at how hard it is for countries to establish semiconductor\nfabs or import fracking technology. For these reasons, it\u2019s also important\nthat innovative countries continue to grow.\n\nOthers argue that we should instead boost innovation with interventions like\nbetter education or scientific funding reform. I support these initiatives,\nbut they\u2019re not an argument against simultaneously pursuing population growth.\nDevoting attention to one thing doesn\u2019t take resources away from another\nthing; this model of scarce attention is usually a bad framing.\n\nTurning to the emotional part of this debate, people react to the prospect of\npopulation growth like people react to cilantro. Most are fine with it, but\nsome people find it disgusting. I think if we can set aside our emotional\nreactions to these ideas, the pro-growth and anti-growth factions can find a\nway to build a better world. The wealth created by steady population growth\ncan help us birth the first sustainable generation, heal nature, and ensure\nthat this prosperity is shared with everyone.\n\n##\n\nFurther Reading\n\nOur World in Data: What is economic growth?

Unintended Consequences of a Declining Population\n\nA recent paper is able to explain many between-country differences in growth\nrates using the number of working age adults rather than raw population: The\nWealth of Working Nations.\n\nThis post by Alex Tabarrok on the paper \u201cFrom Population Growth to Firm\nDemographics: Implications for Concentration, Entrepreneurship and the Labor\nShare\u201d\n\nThe Effect of Population Aging on Economic Growth, the Labor Force and\nProductivity\n\nPopulation Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990\n\nThe Economics of Fertility: A New Era\n\nI discuss the costs of fertility policies in the U.S. more here.\n\nBryan Caplan\u2019s book Open Borders offers a good review of the economics of\nimmigration. He also has some lecture notes on the topic.\n\nThe empirical relationship between wealth and population growth and is messy,\nhere are some reviews:\n\nThe Role of Population in Economic Growth\n\nHow does population growth affect economic growth and vice versa? An empirical\nanalysis\n\nR&D, human capital, fertility, and growth\n\nThe long-run relationship between per capita incomes and population size\n\nOther pieces making similar points about population and progress:\n\nWhy you, personally, should want a larger human population\n\n1960: The Year The Singularity Was Cancelled\n\nNatalism for progressives\n\nThe Ultimate Resource\n\nFertility as Metascience\n\n1\n\nA particular thank you to GrandBurdensomeCount for offering a better way to do\nthe statistics. My initial attempts to redo the analysis based on their\nsuggestion gave me conflicting results. I realize that I should really use\ndata that disaggregates fertility and immigration and applies different lags\nto each. For now, I\u2019m going to lean on the published research instead of my\nown analysis.\n\n2\n\nFor the purposes of the discussion, I\u2019m going to assume that having more\npeople with higher consumption is a good thing and that it\u2019s feasible to have\n1 billion people living in the United States (see here for more discussion of\nthe latter point).\n\nIn lieu of a full argument for more people and more consumption, I\u2019ll note\nthat:\n\n3\n\nIf you know of research like this, send it my way!\n\n4\n\nThere has been some interesting work on whether the correlation between a\ncountry\u2019s fertility and wealth reverses at high enough incomes. Though see the\ndebate here.\n\n  * Does Economic Advancement \u2018Cause\u2019 a Re-increase in Fertility?

Human Development and Fertility in the United States\n\n5\n\nEven if we had strong evidence that world growth is propped up by an\nunchanging number of highly productive researchers, I would still be trying to\ntrain more of them evidence be damned.\n\n6\n\n\u201cCapital dilution\u201d is another theory of how higher population could reduce per\ncapita wealth.\n\n7\n\nI want to emphasize that I\u2019m not advocating for drastic measures, returning to\nreplacement fertility for example is achievable with relatively small policy\nchanges.\n\n8\n\nEven if I\u2019m wrong, we benefit from learning as we go. If RGDP stagnates you\ncan simply stop doing population growth policy, having learned how to boost\ngrowth and knowing more about the causal relationship between wealth and\npopulation. Doing nothing leaves us in the dark.\n\n9\n\nEven if it did, it\u2019s not clear that that would be a bad thing. If policy\nsuccessfully raises population and wealth at the cost of eliminating the\ncorrelation between the two, has anything really been lost? Choosing\nsubsequent policies is harder once the correlation is gone, but a win is a\nwin.\n\n### Subscribe to Splitting Infinity\n\nBy Sam Harsimony \u00b7 Launched 9 months ago\n\nRoadmapping a better future for everything\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Follow-up on \"How rich would 1 billion Americans be?\"\n\nsplittinginfinity.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nHow Rich Would 1 Billion Americans Be?\n\nAn answer to a question nobody thought to ask\n\nFeb 21 \u2022\n\nSam Harsimony\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How Rich Would 1 Billion Americans Be?\n\nsplittinginfinity.substack.com\n\n9\n\nThere's room for more people\n\nPopulation weighted density and inflated cities\n\nMar 20 \u2022\n\nSam Harsimony\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### There's room for more people\n\nsplittinginfinity.substack.com\n\n3\n\nNotes on Writing\n\nYou should write more Before we get into it, why is this piece valuable to\nyou?
