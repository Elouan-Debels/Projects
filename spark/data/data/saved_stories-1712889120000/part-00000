Your Todo Task Manager\n\nvoDO! is a command-line utility for managing and tracking tasks using a simple\nTODO file format. It allows you to create, update, and mark tasks as\ncompleted, making it easy to stay organized and keep track of your pending\ntasks. It's not magic, it's voDO!\n\n## Inspiration\n\nAs a developer working on my personal projects, I find it often difficult to\nremember tasks that need to be done after a long day of coding. This led me\ndown the path of creating voDO, which I use for task tracking on my projects\nwhich has helped a lot in terms of centralizing my thoughts.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Add new tasks with a title, status, and notes\n  * Update task status and notes interactively\n  * Mark tasks as completed\n  * Automatically generate and update a formatted TODO file\n  * Easy installation via a one-liner curl command\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install voDO, simply run the following command in your terminal:\n\n    \n    \n    sh -c \"$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h8ngryDev4Hire/vodo/main/install.sh)\"\n\nThis command will download and execute the install.sh script, which will clone\nthe voDO repository, install the necessary files, and make the vodo command\navailable in your system.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use voDO, open your terminal and run the vodo command followed by the task\ntitle and any additional options:\n\n    \n    \n    vodo \"review new NotificationManager class and apply error handling to notate.js using said class\" -s 2\n\n### Options\n\n  * -s, --status: Specify the status of the task. Available options are:\n  * 1: To be determined\n  * 2: In progress\n  * 3: Blocked\n  * -n, --notes: Add additional notes to the task for better context.\n  * -d, --delete-preexisting: Delete the existing TODO file in the current working directory.\n  * -i, --interactive: Spawn an interactive session to update task status and notes.\n\n## TODO File Format\n\nvoDO creates and updates a TODO file named TODO in the current working\ndirectory. The file follows a simple tab-separated format with the following\ncolumns:\n\n  * ID: The unique identifier of the task.\n  * TASK: The title of the task.\n  * TIME: The timestamp of when the task was created or last updated.\n  * STATUS: The current status of the task.\n  * NOTES: Additional notes associated with the task.\n\nExample:\n\n    \n    \n    ID TASK TIME STATUS NOTES 1 fix search bar tags not displaying correctly 2024-03-23 23:21:24 COMPLETED N/A 2 review new NotificationManager class and apply error handling to notate.js using class 2024-03-25 12:49:03 in-progress N/A\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
