In a time when official sources all seem part of a predictable\nDisney-fied monoculture, just reading this list of names and mini-bios can be\na revelation.\n\nMany of these individuals are now revered as historic figures who changed\nsociety. They had power and prestige. It\u2019s easy to forget that most of them\noperated as outsiders.\n\nThat\u2019s how they wanted it.\n\n####\n\nIf you want to support my work, click here to upgrade to a premium\nsubscription (for $6 per month).\n\nThese renegades at The Village Voice knew that working outside the system\u2014and\ntypically against the system\u2014was their superpower. They could criticize ruling\ninstitutions. They could speak harsh truths. They could go against the grain.\n\nOne thing\u2019s is certain: They didn\u2019t align their interests with globalist\ncorporate CEOs, billionaire technocrats, the surveillance state, and\nestablishment bureaucracies. They would have laughed at journalists who did\nthat\u2014believing, rightly, that honest media requires distance, or even an\nadversarial stance, vis-\u00e0-vis entrenched powers.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what a counterculture does. That\u2019s what it\u2019s expected to do.\n\n> ## \u201cI\u2019m sure that every major person at the Voice had an FBI file.\u201d\n\nRomano captures the peculiar vibe in the title of her book The Freaks Came Out\nto Write. She makes clear that The Village Voice wasn\u2019t The New York Times and\nit definitely wasn\u2019t The New Yorker.\n\nNobody ever stepped into its madcap offices and said \u201cAh, the Gray Lady.\u201d No\nreader ever picked up a copy and expected to see Eustace Tilley on the cover.\n\nCan you tell the difference between culture and counterculture?\n\nAnd The Voice was heard. Even establishment insiders knew they needed to\nlisten to these \u2018Freaks\u2019. Sometimes they feared The Voice, sometimes they\nsecretly agreed with it, but they always treated it as a force deserving\nrespect.\n\nUntil recently that\u2019s how it worked. The tension between insiders and\noutsiders was a source of creative energy in society. The upstarts provided\nalternative views and new ideas. They kept everybody accountable.\n\nI\u2019m pointing this out because this no longer happens. This is the world we\u2019ve\nlost.\n\nWe didn\u2019t always live in a monoculture\n\nToday we still have alternative views and alternative platforms. Substack\u2014the\nplatform where I publish The Honest Broker\u2014is one of them. And there are many\nof others. But the mainstream typically views these alternative voices with\nindifference, neglect, or outright hostility\u2014often working to delegitimize\nthem.\n\nEvery article I\u2019ve read about Substack in the mainstream press has been a hit\npiece. And other outsider platforms don\u2019t even get attacked\u2014some alt media\nstars have an audience in the millions (or tens of millions), but their names\nare never mentioned by the monoculture. They\u2019re not even outsiders, more like\nexiles.\n\nI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say there\u2019s a war going on between the\nmacroculture and these alternative platforms.\n\nSo I read Romano\u2019s history of The Village Voice with a little nostalgia and a\nlot of envy. We need something like The Voice today. The system ought to\nsupport critics of the system\u2014if only to ensure its own heath and survival.\n\nThese oral histories show how things once worked. Here\u2019s a little taste:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m sure that every major person at the Voice had an FBI file.\u201d Nick\n> Hentoff\n\n> \u201cThe person who covered hippies was Don McNeill. He was a homeless guy. He\n> had a bed on the top floor of the office. He knew the scene; he lived what\n> he wrote about.\u201d Richard Goldstein.\n\n> \u201cThe whole idea of countercultural journalism was invented by The Voice,\n> really....It was the investigation of everything you wouldn\u2019t find on the\n> regular grid, and it would clue you in to where culture was going if it were\n> not corporately produced and directed.\u201d Laurie Stone\n\n> \u201cWe got a lot writers just walking in the door....They simply walked in, sat\n> down, and started talking....[Future Pulitzer winner] Jules Feiffer walked\n> in one day with a pile of cartoons under his arm, and he said, \u2018I\u2019ve been to\n> every publisher in New York, and nobody wants what I have. If you want them\n> you can have them for nothing.\u2019\u201d Ed Fancher\n\n> \u201c[Robert] Christgau was hated by bands because he was so honest, and he was\n> so brutal. There\u2019s a single out there, I forgot who did it, called \u2018I Killed\n> Christgau.\u2019\u201d Frank Ruscitti\n\n> \u2018The first person to ever write about Spike Lee in the paper was me. Spike\n> cold-called me at The Voice one day....It was his school project. It was\n> genius. I loved it....Chris Blackwell read what I wrote and got in touch\n> with him and ended up funding She\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d Carol Cooper\n\n> \u201cI got a call from Robert Morgenthau....And he said, \u2018I\u2019ve been reading\n> these articles about [prosecuted and censored comedian] Lenny Bruce....I\n> never thought about running for district attorney but now I\u2019m\n> interested\u2019....That\u2019s why Robert Morgenthau became the longest-serving\n> district attorney in New York.\u201d Nat Hentoff\n\nWhen did The Voice lose its way? As a music fan, I might point to 2006 when\nRobert Christgau and eight other members of the arts staff got fired. Or maybe\nthe forced departure of Nat Hentoff in 2008 was the final straw. (Full\ndisclosure: I hired Hentoff to write for me at Jazz.com a few days later.)\n\nThe Village Voice office, circa 1975. (Photo by Edmund Vincent Gillon/Museum\nof the City of New York/Getty Images)\n\nBut, in all fairness, The Village Voice could have survived these changes,\njust as it had survived the death of Lester Bangs or Stanley Crouch\u2019s exit\n(after a violent altercation on the premises). They just needed to find the\nnext great writer to fill the empty big shoes.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t do it. The world had changed. Borrowing the melody of a Brazos\nRiver cane-cutting song, I\u2019m forced to sing.\n\nTaint no more print readers in the Village demographic. The Internet came and\npillaged all the traffic.\n\nThe Village Voice lasted a few years longer as a print newspaper, but that\nstopped in 2017. Today the periodical exists online, and occasionally in\nprint, but don\u2019t be fooled. The name may be the same but the magic is long\ngone.\n\nBut, Lordy, those outsiders are everywhere now. They are submerged in alt\nplatforms\u2014and will never win Pulitzer Prizes, MacArthur Fellowships, or other\nperks of insiderdom.\n\nBut the audience is paying attention. They don\u2019t need to see validation from\nelites\u2014that would actually make them suspicious. Much like readers of The\nVillage Voice in the 1960s, they trust the outsider more than the insider.\n\nThe only people who haven\u2019t figured this out yet are the entrenched insiders.\nThey think these pesky rivals working out of their apartments will just go\naway.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to happen. The opposite is taking place.\n\nSure, the quality is mixed in the alt media. But if you pick wisely, you reap\nthe benefits\u2014that\u2019s the single best way of replicating The Village Voice in a\nworld where alt newspapers have disappeared. In fact, there\u2019s a whole\nflourishing media ecosystem out there on podcasts and video channels and\nSubstacks, etc.\n\nThe only difference is that the monoculture doesn\u2019t want you to know that\nthese alternatives even exist. Maybe they can\u2019t hide them\u2014that\u2019s impossible\nbecause some individual alt media stars now have more subscribers than the\nGray Lady and Eustace Tilley combined\u2014but institutional insiders can, perhaps,\nslow these upstarts down with hit pieces and smug dismissals.\n\nThat\u2019s why the alt voices aren\u2019t even called a counter-culture. Just\nwhispering the word would give them too much legitimacy.\n\nBut in a media ecosystem where entrenched interests do the legitimizing, it\nmight just be wiser to operate without it.\n\n### Subscribe to The Honest Broker\n\nBy Ted Gioia \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nA trustworthy guide to music, books, arts, media & culture by Ted Gioia\n\n184 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n14 Restacks\n\n184\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Rise and Fall of The Village Voice\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n42\n\nShare\n\n42 Comments\n\nYuri BezmenovHow To Subvert Subversion with ...5 hrs ago\u00b7edited 5 hrs\nagoInsightful as always, Ted.
