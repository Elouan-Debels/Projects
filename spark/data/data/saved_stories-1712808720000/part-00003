Yes, the report was a\ndisappointment\u2014inflation has remained stubbornly higher than is desirable, and\nyes, that makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in the\nshort term. But rates are not extraordinarily high now, and the reality is\nthat rates at this level are entirely consistent with a healthy economy.\nIndeed, we shouldn\u2019t want rates to get down to where they were in the wake of\nthe financial crisis or during the worst of COVID\u2014because they\u2019ll only do that\nin the context of some new and similarly extreme crisis.\n\nGideon's Substack is a reader-supported publication.

The current market yield of 4.36% is roughly in line with where the\n10-year rate was in the mid-2000s. It\u2019s below where the 10-year rate was\nthroughout the boom years of the 1990s. Could it come down from here in the\nabsence of a recession? Sure\u2014but it could also easily stabilize in this area,\neven if inflation settles down to more like 2%, so long as economic growth\nremains strong and there isn\u2019t some exogenous factor (like massive and\nsustained buying by a rising foreign power) driving rates down.\n\nThe comparison isn\u2019t that different for 30-year mortgage rates:\n\nThe current rate of 6.82% is higher than the prevailing rates during the pre-\ncrisis 2000s, but it\u2019s below the prevailing rates of the late 1990s. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s unreasonable to hope that mortgage rates could come down a bit from\nhere\u2014to somewhere just below 6%, say. But the rates that prevailed in the\n2010s were abnormally low, and we shouldn\u2019t want them to return. The fact that\nthey\u2019d crept up to nearly 5% by late 2018 was a reflection of the strength of\nthe economy, not something to lament.\n\nPrevailing interest rate conditions, in other words, are normal. We\u2019ve\nsuffered a shock because rates backed up so quickly from incredibly low\nlevels, but that\u2019s also a reflection of how quickly the economy recovered from\nthe exogenous shock of COVID. When you drive fast, you have to corner hard.\nAnd if we want a full-employment economy generally, we\u2019re going to have to\nlearn to live with significantly positive interest rates.\n\nThat means, among other things, that we\u2019re going to have to learn to live with\nbudgetary constraints again, something we haven\u2019t had to think about since the\n1990s. We\u2019re currently running deficits of more than $1.5 trillion per year,\neven though we\u2019re in an economic boom and defense spending is dropping toward\na post-Cold War low as a percentage of GDP. The cost of interest on the\nfederal debt has skyrocketed back to 1990s levels as well:\n\nAnd yet, the deficit politics of the 1990s shows no sign of returning, at\nleast not yet. The GOP remains focused on cutting taxes and the Democrats\nremain focused on boosting domestic spending. Josh Barro is probably right\nthat it will take sustained pain from high interest rates to change voters\u2019\nperception of the importance of the deficit, and that it will take a change in\nvoter perception to make politicians respond, because the politics of deficit\nreduction isn\u2019t nearly as much fun as the politics of a free lunch. But that,\nin turn, means that we not only should expect interest rates to remain high,\nbut that we should expect them to remain higher than they need to be given\nprevailing macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThat\u2019s my big take-home from not only from today but from the last year.\n\nIf we imagined that our political system got interested in bringing the budget\ninto some semblance of balance again, then we could get deeper into the weeds.\nHere\u2019s a weed I\u2019m particularly interested in: since the COVID-related supply-\nchain problems resolved, services inflation has stubbornly outpaced inflation\nin goods (which has been flat to negative lately). Wages are a bigger\ncomponent of the cost of services than for goods (in general), and\nproductivity growth has been tougher to achieve in the services sector than in\nmanufacturing. All of that suggests to me that what the Fed is really waiting\nfor is evidence of significant moderation in wage growth. As a political\nmatter, that goal is surely a problem for the incumbent president\u2014but it\u2019s\npotentially an economic problem as well if we\u2019re actually trying to run a\nfull-employment economy. Can you do that for any length of time without wage\ngrowth starting to feed into services inflation in a significant way? I\nwonder.\n\nThen again, once ChatGPT starts taking service workers\u2019 jobs in a serious way,\nI suppose we can stop worrying about that problem.\n\nGideon's Substack is a reader-supported publication.
