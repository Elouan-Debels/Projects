Around him, 20 wireless transceivers stood sentry. As Patwari\u2019s\nchest rose and fell, their electromagnetic waves rippled around him. Patwari,\nnow a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, had just demonstrated\nthat those ripples could reveal his breathing patterns.\n\nA few years later, researchers from MIT were building a startup around the\nidea of using Wi-Fi signals to detect falls. They hoped to help seniors live\nmore independently in their homes. In 2015, their prototype made it to the\nOval Office: by way of demonstration, one of the researchers tripped and fell\nin front of President Obama. (Obama deemed the invention \u201cpretty cool.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a tantalizing idea: that the same routers bringing you the internet could\nalso detect your movements. \u201cIt\u2019s like this North Star for everything ambient\nsensing,\u201d says Sam Yang, who runs the health-sensor startup Xandar Kardian.\nFor a while, he says, \u201cinvestors just flocked in.\u201d\n\nFast-forward nearly a decade: we have yet to see a commercially viable Wi-Fi\ndevice for tracking breathing or detecting falls. In 2022, the lighting\ncompany Sengled demonstrated a Wi-Fi lightbulb that could supposedly do\nboth\u2014but it still hasn\u2019t been released. The startup that made its case to\nObama now uses other radio waves. One breathing-monitor startup, called\nAsleep, set out to use Wi-Fi sensing technology but has pivoted to using\nmicrophones instead. Patwari also started his own company to make Wi-Fi\nbreathing monitors. But, he says, \u201cwe got beaten out by Google.\u201d\n\n## Related Story\n\nThe beautiful complexity of the US radio spectrum\n\nThe United States Frequency Allocation Chart shows how the nation\u2019s precious\nradio frequencies are carefully shared.\n\nWi-Fi sensing as a way to monitor individual health metrics has, for the most\npart, been eclipsed by other technologies, like ultra-wideband radar. But Wi-\nFi sensing hasn\u2019t gone away. Instead, it has quietly become available in\nmillions of homes, supported by leading internet service providers, smart-home\ncompanies, and chip manufacturers. Wi-Fi\u2019s ubiquity continues to make it an\nattractive platform to build upon, especially as networks continually become\nmore robust. Soon, thanks to better algorithms and more standardized chip\ndesigns, it could be invisibly monitoring our day-to-day movements for all\nsorts of surprising\u2014and sometimes alarming\u2014purposes.\n\nYes, it could track your breathing. It could monitor for falls. It may make\nbuildings smarter, and increase energy efficiency by tracking where people\nare. The flip side of this, however, is that it could also be used for any\nnumber of more nefarious purposes. Someone outside your home could potentially\ntell when it\u2019s vacant, or see what you are doing inside. Consider all the\nreasons someone might want to secretly track someone else\u2019s movements. Wi-Fi\nsensing has the potential to make many of those uses possible. What\u2019s more,\nthis technology interprets the physical properties of electromagnetic waves,\nnot the encrypted data they carry. It represents a new kind of privacy risk,\nand one for which safeguards are still being developed.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Sleep Sensing feature is built into its Nest Hub; it tracks\nbreathing, snoring, and coughing for whoever is sleeping closest to the\ndevice, using not Wi-Fi sensing but a radar chip. Otherwise, Google\u2019s approach\nis basically the same as Patwari\u2019s: first use electromagnetic waves to sense\ntiny movements, and then use AI to make those movements make sense. The main\ndifference is the length of the waves. Shorter wavelengths offer more\nbandwidth and thus more accuracy; longer wavelengths allow sensing over\ngreater distances. The waves that ripple out from most Wi-Fi-enabled devices\nare two or five inches long: they can cover a lot of ground. The waves from\nGoogle\u2019s radar chip, in contrast, are just five millimeters long and can\nprovide much more detail. To come even close, Wi-Fi sensing needs to look at\nhow waves from multiple devices interact. But if it can do that, it will\ncombine detail with range\u2014without the need for special radar chips or\ndedicated devices like wearables. If Wi-Fi sensing becomes a default option in\nsmart devices like lightbulbs\u2014a push that is already beginning to take\nplace\u2014then those devices can start monitoring you. And as Wi-Fi sensing\ntechnology improves, these devices can start watching in more detail.\n\nInitially, says Patwari, \u201c[Wi-Fi] resolution was pretty poor.\u201d Locations were\naccurate to only two meters, and two people chatting next to each other could\nlook like one person. Over the past decade, researchers have been working to\nsqueeze more information from the longer wavelengths used by commercial\nrouters. More important, they are using AI to make sense of metadata that\ndescribes how waves scatter or fade, known as \u201cchannel state information.\u201d\nThat gives them much more information to work with. Sixteen years ago, \u201cwe\nwould be able to know pretty reliably that a person had walked by,\u201d Patwari\nsays. \u201cBut now, people are getting gait information\u2014what somebody\u2019s walking\npattern is like.\u201d Still, while Wi-Fi sensing is getting more detailed, the\nreliability of those details remains iffy. \u201cThe signal is just not clean\nenough,\u201d says Yang.\n\n> If Wi-Fi sensing becomes a default option in smart devices\u2014a push already\n> taking place\u2014those devices can start monitoring you.\n\nMeanwhile, AI advances that are helping Wi-Fi sensing improve are also helping\nradar. Some of the uses that made Wi-Fi sensing exciting a decade ago are now\ncommercially available with dedicated radar devices that use shorter\nwavelengths.\n\nInspiren, a radar company working in hospitals and long-term-care facilities,\ncombines data from radars and cameras mounted above beds for fall detection.\nIt both alerts staff to falls and flags the moments when frail patients are\nmost at risk of falling, like when they get out of bed. Yang\u2019s sensor company\nsells an FDA-cleared medical device that can monitor heart rates from above\nhospital beds or jail cells\u2014no wearables required. Some of these devices are\nalready in use in Kentucky jails, where the goal is to help prevent overdoses\nand other medical emergencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s a much creepier use case: spying through walls. Patwari earned a\n\u201cWi-Fi Signals Can See Through Walls\u201d headline back in 2009 when the\ntechnology detected motion in another room. In January 2023 new versions of\nthat headline reappeared, this time for a story about Carnegie Mellon\nresearchers who used an AI engine called DensePose to generate body shapes\nfrom Wi-Fi signals. (The accuracy was far from perfect.) Radar that senses\npeople through walls has existed for years; it is used by SWAT teams, border\npatrol, search-and-rescue teams, and the military.\n\nYet Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a staff technologist at the ACLU, has flagged Wi-Fi\nsensing by state actors as a potential privacy concern, particularly for\nactivists. \u201cWe have lots of examples of law enforcement overreach,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIf law enforcement gains access to this data and uses it to harass people,\nit\u2019s another chunk of metadata that can be abused.\u201d\n\nWi-Fi sensing is already replacing other motion detection tools. It may also\nhelp make some current radar applications widely available\u2014albeit with less\nreliability in many cases. In both contexts, Gillmor says, it could be used by\ncorporations to monitor consumers, workers, and union organizers; by stalkers\nor domestic abusers to harass their victims; and by other nefarious actors to\ncommit a variety of crimes. The fact that people cannot currently tell they\nare being monitored adds to the risk. \u201cWe need both legal and technical\nguardrails,\u201d Gillmor says.\n\nWi-Fi sensing may also usher in new forms of monitoring. With its longer\nwavelengths, Wi-Fi could cover more ground than millimeter-wave radar. As the\nMIT team demonstrated back in 2015, it might eventually detect falls in\nprivate homes instead of hospitals. But there is a reason Google\u2019s Nest tracks\nbreathing from one nightstand instead of from every lightbulb in the house: in\nthe real world, context is hard for algorithms to parse. In a hospital room, a\nfall is probably a fall. In a home, Grandma falling looks a lot like a child\njumping off the couch. So researchers are working on ways to reidentify known\nusers. In addition to flagging falls, a tool like that could spot a burglar\nwhile a family is on vacation; depending on the settings and the context, it\ncould also spot a teenager coming home after curfew, activists holding a\nmeeting, or\u2014in countries that enforce sodomy laws\u2014two people of the same sex\nsleeping in the same bed.\n\nOf course, further along the electromagnetic spectrum, security cameras and\nnanny cams can already track individuals with ease. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember:\nthe context you get out of the camera is just crazy,\u201d says Taj Manku, CEO of\nthe Wi-Fi sensing company Cognitive Systems. \u201cYou see the person\u2019s face. You\nsee whether they\u2019re doing jumping jacks or they\u2019re doing exercise or they\u2019re\ndoing something bad.\u201d\n\nBut the mere fact that existing tools may achieve overlapping results, Gillmor\nsays, does not lower the risk: \u201cThat way lies privacy nihilism.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Wi-Fi can beat other sensors at their own games, integrating\nWi-Fi sensing with those tools could eventually enhance the strengths of each.\nFor now, commercial providers are taking advantage of Wi-Fi\u2019s range to focus\non home security, along with one other area where they believe that Wi-Fi\nsensing is already the best solution. Spence Maid, CEO of the Wi-Fi sensing\ncompany Origin Wireless, puts it this way: \u201cI hate to even say it, but\u2014\u2018Is Mom\nalive?\u2019\u201d\n\nUntil a year and a half ago, Emily Nikolich, 96, lived on her own in a condo\nin New Jersey. Each day, her grandchildren sent her new photos in an app on\nher tablet. Each day, Emily could spy on her five great-grandchildren, ages\nnewborn to four. Meanwhile, her son Paul Nikolich, 68, was spying on her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2021, Paul installed a Wi-Fi sensing tool from Origin Wireless called Hex\nHome. Five small, glowing disks plugged in around Emily\u2019s home\u2014with her\npermission\u2014helped Paul to triangulate her position. He showed me the app. It\ndidn\u2019t track Emily per se; instead, it tracked movement near each disk. But\nsince Emily lived alone, the effect was the same: Paul could easily watch her\ndaily journeys from bed to brunch to bathroom and back.\n\nIt was \u201ca relief,\u201d says Paul, to know that his mom was okay, even when he was\ntraveling and couldn\u2019t call. So when Emily moved into an assisted living home\nlast year, the monitors came with her. Hex has learned Emily\u2019s routine; if\nsomething out of the ordinary happens\u2014if, for example, she stays in bed all\nday\u2014it can send Paul an alert. So far, he hasn\u2019t had any. \u201cFortunately, she\u2019s\nbeen doing really well,\u201d he says.\n\nIn practice, Wi-Fi sensing still has a hard time with details. But it is very\ngood at noticing human presence, regardless of walls or furniture. That\naccuracy, according to Manku? \u201cIt\u2019s 100%.\u201d That makes Wi-Fi sensing great for\nenergy management (lightbulb maker WiZ uses it to turn the lights off in empty\nrooms) and for cutting back on false alarms from home security systems. It can\nalso be helpful in places with aging populations. In Japan, Maid says,\n\u201cthey\u2019re having the mail delivery people knock on doors and make sure people\nare still alive.\u201d An Okinawa-based company is developing a proof-of-life\nservice using Origin\u2019s technology.\n\nManku estimates that at least 30 million homes already have some kind of Wi-Fi\nsensing available. One of Verizon\u2019s new Fios routers now ships with Origin\nWireless\u2019s \u201chuman presence detection\u201d built in. Stationary smart things\nalready on the network\u2014like lightbulbs, smart plugs, speakers, or Google\nNests\u2014can instantly become sensors. Other internet service providers are\ncreating similar offerings; Cognitive Systems partners with more than 160\nISPs. This January, Cognitive Systems announced that its technology will soon\nbe available in many of the cheap smart plugs for sale on Amazon, allowing\npeople to use Wi-Fi sensing through their existing Google, Apple, and Amazon\nAlexa smart-home apps.\n\nEventually, the Wi-Fi sensing companies I spoke with would like to go even\nbigger: serving not just homes and small businesses, but also larger office\nbuildings or stores. Wi-Fi sensing, Manku says, could help firefighters locate\npeople behind smoke too dense to see through; smart HVAC could leave the AC on\nfor people working late. Occupancy data could help companies make post-\npandemic downsizing decisions; foot-traffic data could inform in-store product\nplacement. But to be useful in those complex scenarios, Wi-Fi would need to\naccurately count and locate lots of people.\n\nJie Yang, a researcher at Florida State University, is thinking bigger and in\na slightly different direction: he is counting and locating people\u2014and then\ntracking them individually. \u201cFive years ago, most of the work focused on a\nsingle person,\u201d Yang says. \u201cRight now, we are trying to target multiple\npersons, like a family.\u201d Recent research has focused on reidentifying target\nindividuals when multiple people are present, using walking patterns or\nbreathing rate. In a 2023 paper, Yang showed that it was possible to\nreidentify people in new environments. But for that research to work in the\nreal world, even for just a handful of family members or employees,\nresearchers won\u2019t just need better AI; they will also need better hardware.\n\nThat\u2019s where Emily\u2019s son Paul comes in.\n\nFor the past 22 years, the younger Nikolich has chaired an obscure but\ninfluential group within the Institute of Electrical and Electronics\nEngineers: the 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee, which sets the technical\nstandards for Wi-Fi and Ethernet compatibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2019, Nikolich attended an IEEE dinner in Washington, DC. Ray Liu, Origin\nWireless\u2019s founder and a recent IEEE president, was sitting across the table\nfrom him, discussing Wi-Fi sensing with another attendee. Nikolich started\nlistening in. He had been thinking about how to wire\u2014and unwire\u2014the internet\nsince around the time URLs were invented. But here, suddenly, was something\ndifferent. \u201cI was very excited about it,\u201d Nikolich says.\n\n## Related Story\n\nHow climate vulnerability and the digital divide are linked\n\nMonica Sanders\u2019s Undivide Project is documenting overlapping issues in\nunderserved communities in the US.\n\nNikolich and Liu started talking, and Nikolich expressed his support for a\nsubcommittee devoted to Wi-Fi sensing. Since 2020, the 802.11bf Task Group for\nWLAN Sensing, led by experts from companies like Huawei and Qualcomm, has been\nworking on standards for chipmakers designed to make Wi-Fi sensing easier.\nCrucially, when the new standards go into effect, the channel state\ninformation that Wi-Fi sensing algorithms use will become more consistent.\nRight now, that information requires lots of qualifying and debugging. When\nthe new standard comes out in 2025, it will allow \u201cevery Wi-Fi device to\neasily and reliably extract the signal measurements,\u201d Yang says. That alone\nshould help get more Wi-Fi sensing products on the market. \u201cIt will be\nexplosive,\u201d Liu believes.\n\nThe longer-term use cases imagined by the committee include counting and\nfinding people in homes or in stores, detecting children left in the back\nseats of cars, and identifying gestures, along with long-standing goals like\ndetecting falls, heart rates, and respiration.\n\nWhere such goals are concerned, three other IEEE subcommittees may also make a\ndifference. The first is 802.11be, better known as Wi-Fi 7. Wi-Fi 7, which\nrolls out this year, will open up an extra band of radio frequencies for new\nWi-Fi devices to use, which means more channel state information for\nalgorithms to play with. It also adds support for more tiny antennas on each\nWi-Fi device, which should help algorithms triangulate positions more\naccurately. With Wi-Fi 7, Yang says, \u201cthe sensing capability can improve by\none order of magnitude.\u201d\n\nThe Wi-Fi 8 standard, expected in a few years, could lead to another leap in\ndetail and accuracy. Combined with more advanced algorithms, Yang says, Wi-Fi\n8 could allow sensors to track not just a few people per router, but 10 to 20.\nThen, sharing information between routers could make it possible to count and\ntrack individuals moving through crowded indoor spaces like airports.\n\nFinally, a less widely used standard known as WiGig already allows Wi-Fi\ndevices to operate in the millimeter-wave space used by radar chips like the\none in the Google Nest. If that standard ever takes off, it could allow other\napplications identified by the Wi-Fi sensing task group to become commercially\nviable. These include reidentifying known faces or bodies, identifying drowsy\ndrivers, building 3D maps of objects in rooms, or sensing sneeze intensity\n(the task group, after all, convened in 2020).\n\nThere is one area that the IEEE is not working on, at least not directly:\nprivacy and security. For now, says Oscar Au, an IEEE fellow and member of the\nWi-Fi sensing task group who is a vice president at Origin Wireless, the goal\nis to focus on \u201cat least get the sensing measurements done.\u201d He says that the\ncommittee did discuss privacy and security: \u201cSome individuals have raised\nconcerns, including myself.\u201d But they decided that while those concerns do\nneed to be addressed, they are not within the committee\u2019s mandate.\n\nWhen Wi-Fi signals are used to send data, the information being sent back and\nforth over the electromagnetic waves can be encrypted so that it can\u2019t be\nintercepted by hackers. But the waves themselves just exist; they can\u2019t be\nencrypted in quite the same way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven if your data is encrypted,\u201d says Patwari, \u201csomebody sitting outside of\nyour house could get information about where people are walking inside of the\nhouse\u2014maybe even who is doing the walking.\u201d With time, skill, and the right\nequipment, they could potentially watch your keystrokes, read your lips, or\nlisten to sound waves; with good enough AI, they might be able to interpret\nthem. \u201cI mean,\u201d Patwari clarifies, \u201cthe current technology I think would work\nbest is looking inside the window, right?\u201d\n\nWherever there is Wi-Fi, walls are now more porous. But right now, the only\npeople who can do this kind of spying are researchers\u2014and people who can\nreplicate their results. That latter group includes state governments, Jie\nYang confirms. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that this is already happening,\u201d Yang says. \u201cThat\nis: I don\u2019t know that people are actually doing that. But I\u2019m sure that we are\ncapable of doing that.\u201d\n\nSo more than a decade after he first started trying to use Wi-Fi signals to\nreveal location information, Patwari is now trying to do the opposite.\nRecently, he completed a project sponsored by the US Army Research Office,\ndesigning strategies to introduce noise and false positives into channel state\ninformation to make it harder for unauthorized devices to spy. The EU recently\nsponsored a project called CSI-MURDER (so called because it obfuscates, or\nkills, the channel state information). There are plenty of reasons to prevent\neavesdropping; for one, Patwari says, the US Army might want \u201cto make sure\nthat they can provide Wi-Fi on a base or whatever and not have audio of what\u2019s\ngoing on inside the base eavesdropped outside.\u201d\n\nPlenty of governments already spy on their own citizens, including the US and\nChina\u2014both hubs of Wi-Fi sensing research. That is a risk here too. Even\nthough the most sensitive Wi-Fi sensing data is often stored locally,\nintelligence agencies could easily monitor that data in person\u2014with or without\na warrant or subpoena, depending on the circumstances. They could also access\nany reports sent to the cloud. For many Americans, though, the bigger privacy\nrisk may come from ordinary users, not from government eavesdroppers. Gillmor\nnotes that the tools already on the market for detecting human presence could\ncreate an extra hurdle for people experiencing domestic abuse. \u201cI\u2019m really\nglad to hear that a stalker would follow the Verizon terms of service, but\ncolor me a little bit skeptical,\u201d he adds.\n\nPalak Shah, who leads the social innovation lab at the National Domestic\nWorkers Alliance, says she could imagine upsides for Wi-Fi sensing. \u201cWage\ntheft is a very common problem in our industry,\u201d she says. A tool that helps\nnannies, housekeepers, or care workers prove they were in the home could help\nensure proper payment. But, she says, \u201cit\u2019s usually the case that things end\nup being used against the worker even if there\u2019s a potential for it to be used\nfor them,\u201d and \u201cthat inherent power dynamic is really hard to disrupt.\u201d\n\nThe National Domestic Workers Alliance has helped pass bills in several states\nto make it illegal to \u201cmonitor or record\u201d in bathrooms. In comparison, Wi-Fi\nsensing is often touted as \u201cprivacy protecting\u201d because it does not show naked\nbodies. But, Gillmor says, \u201cjust because it is a sensing mode that humans do\nnot natively have does not mean that it can\u2019t be invasive.\u201d\n\nIn another sense, Wi-Fi sensing is more concerning than cameras, because it\ncan be completely invisible. You can spot a nanny cam if you know what to look\nfor. But if you are not the person in charge of the router, there is no way to\nknow if someone\u2019s smart lightbulbs are monitoring you\u2014unless the owner chooses\nto tell you. This is a problem that could be addressed to some extent with\nlabeling and disclosure requirements, or with more technical solutions, but\nnone currently exist.\n\nI asked Liu what advice he would give to lawmakers wrestling with these new\nconcerns. He told me one senator has already asked. \u201cThis is a technology that\ncan help change the world and make lives better. Elder care, security, energy\nmanagement\u2014everything,\u201d he says. \u201cNevertheless, we as a society need to draw a\nred line. Whatever the red line is\u2014it\u2019s not my job to decide\u2014here is the red\nline we do not cross.\u201d\n\nMeg Duff is a reporter and audio producer based in Brooklyn.
