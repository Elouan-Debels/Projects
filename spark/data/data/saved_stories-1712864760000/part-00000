Bytesize Architecture Sessions created by Andrea Magnorsky\n\nBytesize Architecture Sessions\n\nBytesize Architecture Sessions are a workshop format that help teams\nunderstand the systems they work on. Each session focuses on a small slice of\na system. After some sessions your team will become more homogeneous in the\nunderstanding of their systems, grow a consistent vocabulary and ultimately\nbuild tools to design the future together.\n\nA session lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, and has four well defined parts:\nSession Goal, Alone Together, Consensus and Summary. You can model your\nsystems using different tools. I suggest starting with C4 Diagrams.\n\n## Would you rather watch something?\n\nA great intro talk with some context about why and how Bytesize Architecture\nSessions were created.\n\nA more in-depth talk with great questions and answers after the inital\npresentation.\n\n# And now read these\n\n### Why should you use Bytesize Architecture Sessions?\n\n### Running your first few sessions\n\n### Who organises Bytesize Architecture Sessions?\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Posts\n\n  * Jan 3, 2024\n\n### Talk about SpiderMonkey and how they use Bytesize Sessions by Daniel Minor\n\nSpiderMonkey Byte-Sized Architectures [by Daniel Minor] Daniel gave a talk in\nTokyo as part of JSConf/TC39 where he described how the team he is part of\nuses Bytesize Architecture Sessions.\n\n  * Sep 28, 2023\n\n### Experience report of Using Bytesize Architecture Sessions by Jean de\nBarochez at Payfit\n\nThis is an article by Jean de Barochez, where he describes how his team uses\nBytesize Architecture Sessions at PayFit.\n\n  * Sep 19, 2023\n\n### Using Bytesize Sessions to improve documentation practices by Jean de\nBarochez at Payfit\n\nThis is an article by Jean de Barochez, where he describes his thoughts and\npractices when it comes to documentation and how he uses Bytesize Architecture\nSesssions in the context of documentation.\n\nsubscribe via RSS\n\nSubscribe\n\nA site about Bytesize Architecture Sessions.
