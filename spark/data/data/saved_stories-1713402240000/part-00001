Intentionally or not, Google\nin its role as a gatekeeper is impacting the profits and marketability of our\nprivate email service Tuta Mail - a direct competitor to Google's Gmail, which\ngoes against the Digital Markets Act. Now we call on Google to stop this\nillegit de-ranking of our website in search results, and we call on the EU to\nlook at this unfair practice in the course of its investigation into the DMA-\ncompliance of Google.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nTuta Mail (formerly Tutanota) is the second largest encrypted email provider\nin the world - yet a few weeks ago Google stopped showing the Tuta website for\nsearch terms like \"encrypted email\" or \"secure email\".\n\nEven when people search for \"Tutanota login\" on Google in Germany, they do not\nsee our website as a first result - but our Android app on Google Play. On\nother search engines - like DuckDuckGo, Yahoo or Bing - there is no issue, the\nTuta website comes up as the first search result. So while this is clearly an\nissue with Google only, it has severe implications for our business.\n\nGoogle is the dominant search engine in Europe, North America, and beyond. If\n- when - people are not able to find our website on Google, it means we lose\nbusiness.\n\nSo let's take a look at how the Tuta website is presented at Google,\nDuckDuckGo, and Bing:\n\nGoogle results when searching for \"Tutanota login\" in Germany.\n\nDuckDuckGo results when searching for \"Tutanota login\" in Germany.\n\nBing results when searching for \"Tutanota login\" in Germany.\n\nThe issue is only there when searching on Google. If people use other services\nfor searching for \"Tutanota Login\" like DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo!, or even on\nthe Russian search platform Yandex (even though Tuta Mail is blocked in\nRussia), there is no issue at all. Except for Google, our website is always at\nnumber one when people search for \"Tutanota login\".\n\nList showing the position of a tuta.com website when searching for \"Tutanota\nlogin\" on DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo!, Yandex, and Google.\n\nThe same pattern becomes visible when looking at search terms obviously\nrelated to our business like \"secure email\" and \"encrypted email\" that Tuta\n(and formerly Tutanota) has always ranked for in the past. Tuta Mail is the\nsecond largest encrypted email provider in the world, our mail client is often\nrecommended on blogs and forums as the go-to alternative when looking for\nsecure and private email, and it makes sense that Tuta is ranked for these\nsearch terms - just like our competitors are ranking for these terms and just\nlike how it used to be for us in the past. This is not the case anymore.\n\nIn the following graphs we compare the ranking of \"secure email\" and\n\"encrypted email\" from March 2024 and August 2023. We pick these months\nbecause in September 2023 we rebranded from Tutanota to Tuta, which included\nchanging websites from tutanota.com to tuta.com. Yet, since all site redirects\nhave been configured correctly and we redirected the pages one-on-one, the\nrelaunch went fine and there were no major changes in Google's rankings -\nuntil beginning of March 2024 when rankings suddenly dropped.\n\nPosition of the Tuta website on Google when searing for \"secure email\".\n\nPosition of the Tuta website on Google when searing for \"encrypted email\".\n\n### Contacting Google...\n\nFor the last few weeks, we have tried to get in touch with Google. We have\nopened multiple support tickets on their official platforms, gotten in touch\nwith personal contacts who work at Google, and even tried to contact their\npress offices via email and Twitter.\n\nAll in vain. It is impossible to get in touch with anyone at Google who is\nwilling to look into this issue. We understand that this is a delicate issue\nfor Google, particularly given that the Digital Markets Act (DMA) came into\npower beginning of March 2024 - which is exactly when the issues with Tuta's\nrankings started to appear.\n\n### Digital Markets Act & Google's search results\n\nThe DMA is a rather new EU law that requires gatekeepers such as Google to\ntake action to enable a fair playing field across all their platforms to other\ncompanies, including competitors. Tuta Mail is a direct competitor to Google\nas we offer a private alternative to Gmail.\n\nThis makes the de-ranking of our page particularly delicate for Google -\nwhether it happened intentionally or not. The EU has recently launched an\ninvestigation to check \"whether Google preferences the firm's own goods and\nservices in search results\".\n\nWhen looking at this screenshot again, the conclusion is obvious:\n\nGoogle shows our app on Google Play as the first result when searching for\n\"Tutanota login\" - not our website. If that is not self-preferencing, then\nwhat is?\n\n### Gatekeeping power\n\nThis issue shows clearly how Google can use its gatekeeping power to hurt\ncompetitors. It's a good thing that we now have the DMA legislation to help\ncompanies fight for a fair playing field and to help consumers find\nalternatives to the big tech gatekeepers.\n\nOur founder Matthias Pfau has also commented on Apple's attempt to get away\nwith its malicious measures to comply with the DMA:\n\n> \"It is difficult to compete with such large tech companies like Google or\n> Apple that have never-ending funds for feature development and marketing in\n> the first place. Yet, if they were able to make it even harder for small\n> competitors on their own platforms like the Apple app store or on Google\n> Search, any new competitor would never be able to leave its niche and become\n> a mainstream provider.\"\n\nFortunately, we at Tuta Mail rely on a strong open source community who have\nsupported us for more than ten years already and who have paved our road to\nsuccess - despite repeating issues that we are facing from big tech\ngatekeepers.\n\nIn 2023, Outlook was falsely marking emails from tutanota.com email addresses\nas spam, blocking them from Outlook mailboxes completely. We tried to resolve\nthe issue with Microsoft support for weeks. The issue was only resolved when a\njournalist - who was affected himself because he was using Tuta Mail - started\nasking questions about it.\n\nWithin one day of the journalist's inquiry, the issue was suddenly fixed by\nMicrosoft and emails from tutanota.com landed in Outlook mailboxes just fine\nagain. Only slightly later a similar issue affected Outlook customers\nthemselves when sending emails to Gmail.\n\nWhile we are not able to know what's going on at Outlook or Gmail technically,\nit's obvious that these bugs are affecting many email providers, possibly even\ncompanies using their own mail server.\n\nSuch issues need to be addressed as soon as the email provider or company\naffected complains about them, not only when a journalist starts asking\nquestions.\n\nThese issues with big tech demonstrate the necessity of the EU\u2019s Digital\nMarkets Act:\n\n  1. Big tech services have the power to crush smaller providers.\n\n  2. Complaints from small services are ignored (possibly there are too many such complaints?).\n\n  3. Issues are only resolved when the big tech feels external pressure to do so.\n\nConsequently, it is a good thing that in Europe we have the DMA. This piece of\nlegislation comes to the rescue not just for digital services like ours, but\nalso for much smaller services or independent developers that do not have the\ncapacity to draw public attention to actions of a gatekeeper and its abuse of\npower.\n\n### Google, please fix the search issue!\n\nToday, we are calling on Google to fix the search issue that we are\nexperiencing with tuta.com. It is not acceptable that our site has disappeared\nfrom Google Search, particularly for terms that are obviously so closely\nrelated to our product like \"Tutanota login\", \"encrypted email\", and \"secure\nemail\".\n\n### What you can do to help\n\nBe loud! Big tech services have a lot of power, but so do we. With millions of\nusers worldwide, we have the power to make noise about this issue. Here is how\nyou can help us get the issue fixed:\n\n  * If you have a personal contact working at Google Search, please get in touch with us so we can reach out to them.\n\n  * Share this blog post on Twitter, Mastodon, or your favorite social media platform to make noise about it.\n\n  * Tell your friends about privacy-first alternatives like Tuta Mail so that more and more people stop using big tech services and help break the power of gatekeepers.\n\n  * If in the EU, contact your EU representative and show your support for the DMA and the need to further limit the gatekeeping power of Big Tech. We at Tuta are criticizing politicians a lot, for instance because of chat control; we must also let them know when they do good, for instance when passing laws like the Digital Markets Act.\n\nThank you very much!\n\n### Final thoughts\n\nWe hope that by going public with this issue, we are finally able to reach the\nright people at Google so that they can fix the issue. If this is not the\ncase, our last option will be to sue Google based on the DMA. This would be an\nexpensive endeavour, and we hope that it will not be necessary as we prefer to\ninvest our income into improving your secure email and calendar service than\nto spend it on legal fees.\n\nYou can support us and our fight against big tech dominance, by signing up for\na paid Tuta account.\n\nThank you for joining the privacy revolution!\n\nSIGN UP\n\nAuthor\n\nHanna is part of the Tuta team since the launch of the secure email client\nTutanota in 2014.
