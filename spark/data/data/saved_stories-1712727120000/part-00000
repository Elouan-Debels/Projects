Yes, the main\ndomain name for Musk's X is still Twitter.com. Yes, there are multiple\nofficial pages on the platform where the company still refers to it as\n\"Twitter.\" Yes, most people still call it \"Twitter.\" But, Musk's social media\nplatform is officially called X.\n\nOn Monday, it appears X attempted to encourage users to cease referring to it\nas Twitter and instead adopt the name X. Some users began noticing that posts\nviewed via X for iOS were changing any references of \"Twitter.com\" to \"X.com\"\nautomatically.\n\nX user @___frye posted \"Twitter .com\" but on X's app for iOS it shows as \"X\n.com\" Credit: Mashable Screenshot\n\n## X's Twitter dot com problem\n\nYes, you read that correctly. If a user typed in \"Twitter.com,\" they would see\n\"Twitter.com\" as they typed it before hitting \"Post.\" But, after submitting,\nthe platform would show \"X.com\" in its place on the X for iOS app, without the\nuser's permission, for everyone viewing the post.\n\nAnd shortly after this revelation, it became clear that there was another big\nissue: X was changing anything ending in \"Twitter.com\" to \"X.com.\"\n\nAs of publication of this piece, here's how one post currently shows up on X's\nwebsite:\n\nHere's how @Arcticstar0's post looks like X's website.

Credit:\nMashable Screenshot\n\n## Why this is a big deal\n\nLet's say someone owns the domain name \"NetfliTwitter.com.\" Why would they own\nthat domain name? Because if X is automatically changing anything that\nincludes \"Twitter.com\" to \"X.com,\" then that means posting \"NetfliTwitter.com\"\non X would make it appear in posts as \"Netflix.com,\" the popular movie\nstreaming service. And if a user clicked the linked \"Netflix.com\" text that\nappears in that post, it would really take them to \"NetfliTwitter.com.\"\nBecause while X is changing the text that the user wrote, the URL it links and\ndirects to remains the same as the user posted.\n\nThis is a dream scenario for someone looking to steal passwords through\nphishing campaigns.\n\nAn example of X changing \"NetfliTwitter .com\" to \"Netflix .com\" Credit:\nMashable screenshot\n\nThe example I just provided isn't a hypothetical either. Some users on X\nnoticed this very problem and found that it could quickly be utilized by\nscammers, hackers, and other bad actors. X user @yuyu0127_ quickly registered\nthe domain name \"NetfliTwitter.com\" in order to prevent it from being\nweaponized and put up a warning page on the URL about the potential issues in\nX's changes.\n\n\"This domain has been acquired to prevent its use for malicious purposes,\"\nreads the headline text on \"NetfliTwitter.com.\"\n\nOne user tried to post \"setwitter .com\" and Twitter changed the text to \"sex\n.com.\" Credit: @___frye\n\nAnother domain name \"seTwitter.com\" was also registered due to its potential\nto be exploited as X would then change how the URL is viewed on the platform\nto \"sex.com.\" The X user, @amasato_mochi, who registered that domain name,\nalso put up a warning page in order to put a spotlight on the issue.\n\n\"Please be very careful not to access suspicious URLs,\" reads seTwitter.com.\n\"I will hold onto this domain for a year to prevent any harm.\"\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\nAccording to some users, the change implemented by X also affected older\nposts. Meaning any instance where someone previously tweeted \"Twitter.com\" was\nbeing changed retroactively to \"X.com.\"\n\nX eventually realized the issue and rolled out a patch later that same day for\nsome of the domains affected by this change. \"Netflitwitter.com\" no longer\nshows up as \"Netflix.com\" for example.\n\nHowever, Mashable can confirm that the X for iOS app is currently still\nchanging many other references of \"Twitter.com\" to \"X.com.\" We noticed that in\none instance we found, the change was happening when \"Twitter.com\" was being\nused in a subdomain for another URL.\n\nIt's unclear if this version of the issue will eventually be patched too. It\ncertainly seems like a bad idea to change the text in a user's post without\ntheir permission. Regardless, the whole ordeal is certainly a remarkable\nstumble for X, especially when Elon Musk's social media platform itself still\nforwards \"X.com\" to \"Twitter.com.\"\n\nTopics Social Media Twitter Elon Musk\n\nRecommended For You\n\nGet ready: SpaceX Starship will try to fly again soon\n\nThe next launch will attempt the first step toward refueling in space.\n\n03/09/2024\n\nBy Elisha Sauers\n\nU.S. spacecraft on the moon finally sends home the money shot\n\nThe final confirmation has arrived.\n\n02/29/2024\n\nBy Elisha Sauers\n\nWatch Jon Stewart moving out from his home beneath Stephen Colbert's desk\n\nThis one gets surreal.\n\n02/12/2024\n\nBy Sam Haysom\n\n'IF' Super Bowl trailer promises Ryan Reynolds, John Krasinski, and tons of\nimaginary friends\n\nSteve Carell also stars, making this an \"Office\" reunion for him and\nKrasinski.\n\n02/12/2024\n\nBy Belen Edwards\n\nThe best VPN for torrenting\n\nFor all your downloading needs.\n\n03/26/2024\n\nBy Joseph Green\n\nTrending on Mashable\n\nNYT Connections today: See hints and answers for April 9\n\nEverything you need to solve 'Connections' #303.\n\n23 hours ago\n\nBy Mashable Team\n\nWordle today: Here's the answer and hints for April 9\n\nHere are some tips and tricks to help you find the answer to \"Wordle\" #1025.\n\n22 hours ago\n\nBy Mashable Team\n\nNYT's The Mini crossword answers for April 9\n\nStuck on any of the clues?
