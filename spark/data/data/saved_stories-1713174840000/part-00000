Those I share the\nproject with ask me why I bothered. Either that or they nervously smile and\nchange the topic. As to the question of why, I understand the impulse to ask\nit. I too have heard about projects that lead me to ask the same question. In\nthe past, I\u2019ve struggled to answer this question in a way that wasn\u2019t an\nattempt to exaggerate the utility of the thing I was working on, or to promise\nsome future utility \u201cbecause it\u2019s cool! This will one day open up the\npossibility of X for me, and it solves problem Y...\u201d. I have been thinking\nabout this a lot recently, and think I can finally answer the question in a\ncoherent manner.\n\nI\u2019ve been working on a hardware project that involved connecting my standing\ndesk to the internet. If I describe that project in pure utilitarian terms,\nits utility can be boiled down to \u201cI want my desk to go up when I make a HTTP\nrequest to a specific endpoint\u201d. How useful is this, really? Isn\u2019t the\nprevious solution of just leaning over to the right around 6 inches and\npressing the button for a few seconds convenient enough for me? This is a\nperfectly reasonable question - if you assume my goal was to solve a real\nproblem that mattered.\n\nIn the last few years, I\u2019ve found that my love of tech has been dying a bit.\nEarlier in my life, I\u2019d constantly experiment with Linux distributions, window\nmanagers, programming languages, text editors, hardware - really whatever was\ninteresting that day. Spending the day compiling my kernel to test some silly\ntweak was never an issue. In the last couple years however I\u2019d noticed that\nthis experimentalist nature in me had died. I used a completely conventional\nLinux distro. I didn\u2019t even bother to change the wallpaper. I had a bone stock\nphone. Electronics experimentalism was limited to projects that I could\njustify as having some real utility. If they weren\u2019t useful, why would I waste\nmy time on them? I learned Golang - and fell in love with its very utilitarian\n\u201cget shit done\u201d nature. No tabs versus spaces wars, no nine ways of doing the\nsame thing, all of which are somehow not best practice according to somebody\nsomewhere. I grew to dislike working in almost any other language.\n\nMore recently, that experimentalism seems to have bloomed in me again. I think\nthat what originally killed it was a marriage to utility - the idea that\neverything I build should have some inherent useful output. Maybe I envision\nturning it into a startup one day. Maybe it solves a problem that others care\nabout? Why experiment with a different Linux distribution when I can get by\njust fine with the one I have? Isn\u2019t that just a total waste of time? Why\nbother solving some tiny niggle with a standing desk through weeks of research\nand learning - when the time could be better spent watching Star Trek? Maybe I\ncould have just bought a different standing desk.\n\nIn addition, my love of tech is back in full force again. I\u2019m now trying\nNixOS, a Linux distribution that bills itself a reproducible, declarative and\nreliable operating system. Some expressed ridicule when I mentioned this to\nthem. Isn\u2019t that just a waste of time? To some degree, they\u2019re right.\nEverything I do on my new shiny NixOS install is possible on any other distro,\nand is almost certainly possible on a Mac. What they probably didn\u2019t\nunderstand though is that this wasn\u2019t a utilitarian decision. I didn\u2019t switch\nto NixOS with any hope of improved productivity. I switched because I wanted\nto see what it was all about. I wanted to struggle to figure it out. I wanted\nto see what the benefits are. In that process, I have learned far more about\nhow Linux works at a low level than I have in my years just sticking with the\nknown working thing. The skills I acquired along the way will be helpful even\nif I decide to abandon NixOS one day. I didn\u2019t switch because it was the\nprudent thing to do - I switched for switchings sake.\n\nI recently acquired a 3D Printer. Many people buy a 3D printer with the goal\nof eventually turning it into a side gig - producing parts or whatever. I\ndidn\u2019t. I bought a 3D printer because I wanted to learn to model in 3D. I\ndidn\u2019t have a specific utilitarian goal in mind, but I felt that owning a 3D\nprinter would push me to learn to design things in CAD in a way that doing it\nwithout having a way to make it physical would not. It did not improve my\nproductivity in any way. My day job in DevOps is about as far from CAD as one\ncan get - and I\u2019m not considering any sort of career change. I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ll ever design something that I intend to sell. I wanted to learn CAD\nbecause I thought it\u2019d be fun, so I am, and I was right. It is fun, and it\nturns out 3D printers are hilariously useful machines to have around if you\nare willing to spend the time to use them properly. I didn\u2019t buy a 3D printer\nbecause it solved a particular problem, or because I intend to become a\nproduct designer or artist. I bought it because I wondered how it worked.\n\nSo, revisiting the standing desk project one more time. Why did I do it? One\nskill I\u2019ve always wished I had was knowing how to \u201csniff\u201d data from consumer\ngrade hardware so I could ship it off somewhere more useful. I\u2019ve always\nwanted to develop some competency in C++ too - given it\u2019s a language I\u2019ve\nnever had the opportunity to really write any significant amount of it. I\nlooked around my desk, and decided that the nearest thing to me to had some\ndata I could sniff was actually my desk. What if I could make it go up and\ndown from HTTP requests? What if I could query its height from the internet?\nThus, a project with very little apparent utility turns into an amazing\npuzzle, with endless learning opportunities. It involved learning some C++,\nhow to operate a Logic Analyzer, how to decode i2c, some basic electronics,\nthere was even a fairly hilarious reminder about hysteresis I\u2019ll cover in a\nfuture post.\n\nThis might be obvious to some. I believe the reason why experimentalism like\nthis captures my soul so completely when it does is because the goal is rarely\nthe point. It\u2019s the exploration. The learning. The sheer joy at making\nsomething work. The surprise when some previously insurmountable obstacle is\nsurmounted. The dopamine rush as a whole new world of possibilities opens up\nto you. The new skills acquired along the way. The friends made when seeking\nhelp in random internet forums. It turns out that sometimes, the journey taken\nis far more important than the end goal.\n\nI really hope I can keep feeling okay to taking my time working on things that\nhave no obvious point, because the real answer to the question of why, is why\nnot?\n\n## Other writing\n\n  * https://sigbovik.org/ the home of the Association for Computational Heresy - I specifically recommend YT: Harder drives as a good starting point.
