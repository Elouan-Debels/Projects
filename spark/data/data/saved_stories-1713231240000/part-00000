Together we slip inside. She speaks to her husband. \u201cPapa\n... Papa,\u201d she whispers. \u201cWe have a guest from far away.\u201d Behind us, second\neldest son Jamie enters the room with a tray and walks up quietly. \u201cHere is\nyour rice, Papa. Here is your fish. Here are the chilies,\u201d he says.\n\nAs we back silently out of the room, Elisabeth says softly, \u201cWake up, Papa.\nIt\u2019s time for your dinner.\u201d I turn back for a moment as eldest son Yokke\nexplains: \u201cShe\u2019s taking your picture, Papa.\u201d\n\nFriends and family inspect the body of Debora Maupa\u2019, who died in 2009 at age\n73. A well-preserved body, mummified with a solution of formaldehyde and\nwater, is thought to bring good fortune.\n\nA touching family scene. Nothing that couldn\u2019t happen anywhere on Earth.\nExcept for one thing. Elisabeth\u2019s husband, a former clerk in the city marriage\nbureau, has been dead for nearly two weeks. Here, in the handsome, melon-\ncolored concrete house of a respected and prosperous family, Petrus Sampe lies\nmotionless on a wooden twin bed, a red patterned blanket tucked under his\nchin.\n\nFor several more days in this house on the fringe of the town of Rantepao, in\nthe remote highlands of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, Petrus will lie in\nthis bed. His wife and children will speak to him as they bring him food four\ntimes a day\u2014breakfast, lunch, dinner, and mid-afternoon tea. \u201cWe do this\nbecause we love him and respect him so much,\u201d Yokke says. Elisabeth adds,\n\u201cBefore, we used to eat together. He\u2019s still at home\u2014we should feed him.\u201d\nFormalin (formaldehyde plus water) treatments shortly after death mean the\nbody will not putrefy, but in time it will mummify. The room\u2019s scent is\nnothing more than the usual hint of sandalwood in a Torajan house. On the wall\na picture of Jesus Christ leading a lamb looks down.\n\nNear Rantepao, Sulawesi, cousins and sisters surround three-year-old Syahrini\nTania Tiranda, who died the day before. They touch her and talk to her. To\nthem she is to makula\u2019\u2014a sick person.\n\nPhotograph by Brian Lehmann, National Geographic\n\nFour days later, after musical tributes, a Christian religious service, and a\npork, vegetable, and rice dinner for more than a hundred, family members lift\nPetrus from the bed into a coffin. Videographers record the event. Eight or\nmore children\u2014relatives and friends from the neighborhood\u2014push each other out\nof the way to get a better view. Afterward Petrus will remain at home, in his\ncoffin, until his funeral in December, four months from now. His wife will\nlive in the house with him until then; some families follow the old custom of\nnever leaving a dead person alone. Until the funeral, Elisabeth and her\nchildren will call him to makula\u2019\u2014a sick person. \u201cWe believe that even though\nthe father is to makula\u2019, his soul is still in the house,\u201d Yokke says.\n\nFor Torajans, the death of the body isn\u2019t the abrupt, final, severing event of\nthe West. Instead, death is just one step in a long, gradually unfolding\nprocess. Late loved ones are tended at home for weeks, months, or even years\nafter death. Funerals are often delayed as long as necessary to gather far-\nflung relatives. The grandest funeral ceremonies are week-long events drawing\nTorajans home in a vast reverse diaspora from wherever in the world they may\nbe. When a brigade of a hundred or more motorcycles and cars rips through town\naccompanying a corpse home from far away, traffic stops in a manner that not\neven an ambulance or a police officer can command. Here, death trumps life.\n\nTorajans do not reject medical treatments for life-threatening conditions. Nor\ndo they escape grief when loved ones die. But far from pushing death away,\nalmost everyone here holds death at the center of life. Torajans believe that\npeople aren\u2019t really dead when they die and that a profound human connection\nlasts well past death. Death for many Torajans is not a brick wall but a gauze\nveil. It is not a severing but just another kind of connection. Often in\nToraja the deep link with a loved one doesn\u2019t end at the grave. Periodically\nsome northern Torajans bring their relatives out of their tombs to give them\nfresh clothing and burial shrouds.\n\nNo one knows exactly when Torajan death practices began. The Torajan language\nwas written down only in the early 20th century, so most of the old traditions\nare still oral. Only recently, through carbon dating of wooden coffin\nfragments, have archaeologists concluded that there are Torajan death\npractices that date back at least as far as the ninth century A.D. The first\nDutch ships arrived in what is now Indonesia in the late 16th century,\nsearching for nutmeg and cloves. Just over 300 years later they reached\nToraja, a cultural region that today encompasses the districts of Toraja Utara\nand Tana Toraja. Thanks to Dutch missionaries, it\u2019s a Christian enclave, made\nup mostly of Protestants but also Roman Catholics, in a majority-Muslim\ncountry. Christianity has tried more or less successfully to partner with\ntraditional practices: Nearly every step of a Torajan death is greeted with\nprayers, readings from Matthew or John, and a recitation of the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\n\n3:53\n\nToraja is dotted with villages perched high on the side of cliffs or nestled\ndeep in the valleys below. Rantepao, a dusty town of 26,000, is reached mainly\nvia an eight-hour trip from Sulawesi\u2019s largest city, Makassar, on 200 miles of\ncorkscrewing, cliff-hugging road. The villages in turn are connected only by\nwinding, one-lane dirt paths carrying two-lane traffic that dodges dogs and\ntoddlers along routes pocked with head-banging, watermelon-size ruts.\n\nI made the rough trek here after years spent writing and speaking about an\nAmerican way of death that glorifies medicine and drugs but fears death, which\nit considers a failure of technology or will. That leaves most Americans dying\nin institutions, when the majority say they would prefer to die in peace at\nhome. After my husband, Terence, died, I began seeking alternatives. I have\ncome here to explore a culture that is even more extreme, but in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nToraja Heartland\n\nNearly half a million Torajans live in the highlands of the Indonesian island\nof Sulawesi. The vast majority, at least 90 percent, are Christians, but they\nremain influenced by their traditional religion, Aluk To Dolo, or Way of the\nAncestors.\n\nAsia\n\nSulawesi\n\n(Celebes)\n\nEQUATOR\n\nPapua\n\nGulf of\n\nTomini\n\nIndonesia\n\nIndian\n\nocean\n\naustralia\n\nsulawesi\n\n(celebes)\n\nGulf of\n\nTolo\n\ntoraja\n\nUtara\n\nPangala\n\nRantepao\n\nTana toraja\n\nBanda Sea\n\nGulf of\n\nBone\n\n100 mi\n\nMakassar\n\n(Ujungpandang)\n\n100 km\n\nNGM MAPS\n\nToraja Heartland\n\nNearly half a million Torajans live in the highlands of the Indonesian island\nof Sulawesi.

Feeding the dead, letting bodies hang\naround, and opening coffins aren\u2019t practices the rest of us will likely adopt\nanytime soon. Even so, I can\u2019t help wondering if the more gradual rhythm and\npacing of Torajan death practices don\u2019t hew more closely to the actual racking\nand shuddering experience of human grief than do our own more buttoned-up\nrituals.\n\nRisma Paembonan takes dinner to her mother-in-law, Maria Salempang, who died\ntwo weeks earlier, at 84. Time at home with parents can be highly prized. \u201cI\u2019m\nnot sad, because she\u2019s still with us,\u201d says another Torajan woman of her 7...\n\nRead More ---\n\nSeeing, talking to, and feeling the presence of a dead loved one are\ncommonplace in the West, write Colin Murray Parkes and Holly G. Prigerson in\nBereavement: Studies of Grief in Adult Life. \u201cI talk to him and quite expect\nhim to answer me,\u201d they quote one widow as saying. Grief itself, they say,\ndoesn\u2019t follow a clean trajectory but rather erupts and calms in cycles over\nmany years\u2014just as Torajan death practices do. But the Western habit of\nsweeping the dead out of sight within days or even hours of death would seem\nfar too abrupt to a Torajan. \u201cMy mother died suddenly, so we aren\u2019t ready yet\nto let her go,\u201d says Yohana Palangda, as she begins to weep. \u201cI can\u2019t accept\nburying her too quickly.\u201d Her mother has continued to receive guests in an\nupstairs room for more than a year. Because Yohana\u2019s mother was the village\nchief\u2014a position Yohana now has\u2014villagers continue to come to seek blessings\nfor important events, or even permission to marry.\n\nMichaela Budiman, an anthropologist at Charles University, in Prague, Czech\nRepublic, writes that if the deceased in Toraja were buried immediately, it\nwould be \u201cas if a hawk careened suddenly upon its prey, snatching it in its\ntalons and vanishing forever in the split of a second.\u201d\n\nMen hang a photograph of Sampe Rara\u2019 Tambing, who died at the age of 79, above\na wooden effigy, or tau tau, of her. It cost about $1,500 to have it carved.\nTau tau are often placed on balconies outside cave burial sites.\n\nSo what is the difference between Yohana\u2019s reluctance to let her mother go and\nour own? Or between Elisabeth\u2019s conversation with her dead husband and the\nones Western widows secretly hold with theirs? Or Elisabeth\u2019s family\u2019s feeding\nritual compared with novelist Joan Didion\u2019s reluctance to part with her dead\nhusband\u2019s shoes, lest he need them when he returns? The best thing to resolve\ngrief is time. What if we, like the Torajans, gave ourselves more time to\nunspool it at its own rate?\n\nA few days after my visit to the deceased Petrus Sampe and his wife, another\nman\u2019s funeral is in full swing at the other end of town. I climb a shaded\nbamboo structure the family has built for out-of-town guests. I curl up on a\nrug next to a young teen, the granddaughter of the deceased. Dinda applies\neyeliner. She fiddles with her smartphone. Everyone likes funerals, especially\nfor the chance to meet faraway relatives, she says, as three younger cousins\nromp nearby, including around their grandfather\u2019s coffin.\n\nHundreds of men, women, and children wander below or sit chatting in the shade\nof ancestral homes\u2014called tongkonan\u2014distinctive stilted structures that carpet\nthe region, their giant curved roofs seeming to float like huge red boats on\nseas of palm, coffee trees, and bougainvillea.\n\nThe spaces between the tongkonan are cluttered with squealing pigs bound to\nbamboo poles, soon to become lunch. Women in slim black-and-white sheath\ndresses sell cigarettes. A motorcycle vendor hawks Mylar balloons. Sleek, fat\nwater buffalo are everywhere, lounging under trees, standing alongside the\nroad, or being walked in circles by young men who tend them as affectionately\nas they would pets. A master of ceremonies high in a tower above the crowd\naddresses a magnificent animal, its huge, gracefully curved horns as wide as a\nman is tall.\n\nTourists\u2014mainly Europeans and Australians\u2014who go to Torajan funerals are often\nwelcomed as evidence of the family\u2019s importance. Larger funerals feature\nviewing pavilions where the guests are served tea, coffee, and snacks.\n\n\u201cYou are the most important buffalo here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou will go with this man\nto the next world and make him rich.\u201d\n\nA grand Torajan funeral is measured in the number and quality of buffalo,\nwhich serve as a form of currency. Everything about the funeral is\nhierarchical, cementing the status of the dead person\u2019s family, the people who\nattend, and many who don\u2019t. Today is near the end of more than a week of\nmeals, receptions, meetings, prayers, entertainment, and carefully\nchoreographed rituals separating the dead gradually from life. The body moves\nfrom the home into the family\u2019s ancestral building, then into a nearby rice\nbarn, then to the funeral tower overlooking the ceremonial plain.\n\n## The 'Second Funeral'\n\nCristina Banne, who died in 2011, is held up by her son Bartolomeus Bunga\u2019 as\ngrandson Jerry Putra Bunga\u2019 gives a thumbs-up. With more than half of Torajans\nliving elsewhere, funerary rituals bring families back together.\n\nFunerals glue Torajans tightly, one family to the next, one village to the\nnext. Funerals consume savings as people outdo each other in gifts of animals,\ncreating multigenerational obligations and conspicuous consumption. Your\ncousin donates a buffalo? You must give a bigger one. You can\u2019t repay a past\ngift? Then your son or daughter must. If they can\u2019t, the burden will fall to\nyour grandchildren. This dark side of funeral obligations can be clearly heard\nin the cries of the emcee announcing the gifts. \u201cWhose pig is this?\u201d he\nintones over a loudspeaker. \u201cWhose buffalo is this?\u201d In a metal-roofed shelter\nbelow, government officials tally the quality and size of each gift for tax\npurposes. At the ceremony\u2019s end the neat ledger will be presented to the\nfamily, which will be expected to reciprocate when some member of a giver\u2019s\nfamily dies.\n\nTorajan funerals are also great fun. A funeral is a wedding, a bar mitzvah,\nand a family reunion all in one, easily outstripping the conviviality of Irish\nwakes. Lavish funerals are a chance to meet and mingle, to eat and drink well,\nto enjoy games and entertainment\u2014even to network for jobs or eye prospective\nmates. There are water buffalo fights. (\u201cNo gambling,\u201d the emcee announces.\n\u201cThe family is Christian, and the police are here. The family does not support\ngambling.\u201d) As a cry goes up summoning the strongest to move the coffin to the\ntower, at least 50 young men seize the bamboo poles. They chant their way\naround the field, pumping the coffin up and down as the lyrics grow bawdy:\nsomething about body parts, and size, and sexual prowess. A water fight breaks\nout, with the bearers drenching each other, and the guests, with water from\nplastic cups.\n\n\u201cYou can make an excuse for a wedding, but you have to come to a funeral,\u201d\nsays Daniel Rantetasak, 52, who sits one bright afternoon in the VIP section\nat the funeral of Lassi Allo To\u2019dang, Dinda\u2019s grandfather. Daniel figures he\nhas attended more than 300 funerals in his lifetime. He says that at a funeral\nlike this a minimum of 24 buffalo should be sacrificed. Sometimes the number\nmay exceed a hundred. At an average of 20 million rupiah per buffalo\n($1,425)\u2014prices can go much higher for the most prized, mottled ones\u2014an elite\nfuneral can top $400,000 in buffalo costs alone, paid for by socially\ncompulsory donations and by the many family members who send money home from\nabroad. Food and drink for hundreds of guests and temporary bamboo housing for\nvisitors add to the costs. People devote resources to funerals even while\nstruggling to pay $10,000 for university expenses. One woman remembers her\ngrandmother saying funds were too scarce to pay for college. A few weeks later\nher grandmother spent thousands on pigs for a relative\u2019s ceremony. \u201cI was a\nvictim of tradition,\u201d the woman says. It is commonly said that in Toraja, one\nlives to die.\n\nFriends and family carry the body of Abraham Papa to his grave in a wooden\nduba duba, a funeral bier made to resemble the ancestral family homes, called\ntongkonan, that dot Toraja. By tradition, bystanders may kick or thr...\n\nRead More ---\n\nYet some Western tourists who come to Toraja seeking the exotic pageantry of\nfunerals find that the human connections, unflinching contact with death, and\nsheer fun help shift their thinking about their own culture\u2019s habits. \u201cWhen\nsomeone dies in Spain, it\u2019s the worst thing that can happen in a family,\u201d says\nAntonio Mouchet, an IT consultant touring from Madrid. \u201cWe Western people ...\ndon\u2019t think of the end.

Torajans look on unfazed; their concern is\nmore for the group than the individual, says Stanislaus Sandarupa, a Torajan\nand a linguistic anthropologist at Hasanuddin University, in Makassar. The\nbuffalo\u2019s obligation, he says, is to provide meat to ensure human existence.\nPeople, in turn, must care for the species and make sure it endures.\n\nWhile the funeral is unfolding in town, another set of ceremonies is taking\nplace in the countryside. August is a month not only for funerals but also for\nma\u2019nene\u2019\u2014the \u201csecond funerals\u201d held by families every few years when they\nreturn to ancestral tombs to tidy up, bring the dead snacks and cigarettes,\nand take long-buried bodies out for a turn in the sun and put fresh clothing\non them. Daniel Seba Sambara presides over a gathering that includes his wife,\na daughter and granddaughter, son, son-in-law, and many others congregated\naround a grand family crypt on a breezy spot overlooking a valley. Daniel\nwears new trousers and looks slightly surprised, as if peering out from behind\nnew wire-rimmed glasses. He died in 2012 after 20 years with diabetes. This is\nthe first time his family has seen him since he was interred. This week, for\nthe ceremony of ma\u2019nene\u2019, he was hauled out along with a dozen or so much\nlonger dead relatives, his companions in the crypt.\n\nFamily members prop up the body of Pangkung Rante Rante, thought to have died\nat the age of 115, to honor him. This rare practice, called dipatadongkon, is\nperformed only by upper-class families.\n\nRelaxed and fit, Pieter, Daniel\u2019s son, followed his father in the construction\nbusiness in Papua Province, more than a thousand miles away. Pieter\u2019s orange\npolo shirt is fashionable. His English is excellent. His daughter, Monna, a\ncivil engineer, passes around cell phone pictures of her choir camp in\nCincinnati. Pieter and his family are thoroughly modern Torajans.\n\nSo how does he feel seeing his three-years-dead father lashed to a stucco\npillar, with relatives posed at his side? Proud. And excited. His father\u2019s\nbody is relatively intact and recognizable, unlike those of other relatives\nlying nearby, which look more like Halloween skeletons. His skin is smooth.\nHis fingernails and beard have grown since they saw him last, relatives\nexclaim. Daniel was nicknamed Ne\u2019 Boss\u2014Grandpa Boss\u2014years ago, a commentary on\nhis rags-to-riches success. The body\u2019s state is a sign to Pieter that he too\nwill prosper. \u201cNot everybody is like this. It will bring his children and\ngrandchildren success,\u201d he says, gleefully.\n\nWater buffalo in Toraja are raised to be sacrificed. At the funeral the\nanimals are killed by a machete chop to the jugular, and their meat is then\ndistributed to guests in order of social importance. Until then, boys (and\nsometim...\n\nRead More ---\n\nThe more buffalo sacrificed, the greater the prestige.\n\nI approached this moment with trepidation. After all, we Westerners cringe at\nthe sight of a corpse. Confronted with several, I find myself curiously calm\nand interested. Everyone is festive, wearing bright colors and appearing\ndecidedly happy. The smell is musty, like a bunch of blankets put away wet and\nstored for several years. The sight is definitely odd but surprisingly not\nunpleasant or gruesome. \u201cThe way they handle the bodies, it\u2019s not scary at\nall,\u201d says Ki Tan, an Indonesian who grew up in the Netherlands, as he watches\na family interact with a group of long-dead loved ones, including a year-old\nchild, dead for 38 years. Nearby, a 21-year-old backpacker from Berlin grows\nreflective. \u201cI feel very lucky to have seen this,\u201d says Maria Hart, recalling\nsadly that she was so upset by her own grandfather\u2019s death that she refused to\nattend his funeral. \u201cOn a personal level, I take some comfort in the\ntradition,\u201d says Kathleen Adams, an anthropologist at Loyola University\nChicago who has lived among Torajans and their dead.\n\nThe important thing, Torajans say, is that they are not just individuals. The\ndeath of one person is only the dropping of a single stitch in an intricate\nfinancial, social, and emotional canvas winding backward through ancestors and\nforward through children. How did Torajans come to believe this? I wonder. Go\nask Kambuno, the people say. He\u2019s the man who knows the answers.\n\nIn search of Kambuno, we wind northward from the small town of Pangala,\nskirting rice fields and passing through village after village. Shopkeepers,\nmotorbike riders, and passersby direct us. Everyone knows where Kambuno lives.\nTwo schoolgirls in white shirts, navy skirts, and black ties hop in the car to\npoint the way. When the road peters out, we continue on foot up a steep, rocky\ncourse.\n\nWe find Petrus Kambuno, wiry, goateed, almost toothless, cutting grass by the\nside of the road. \u201cYou are lucky you found me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no one left\nbut me who knows these stories.\u201d He claims to be 90 years old. He spins a\nGenesis-like creation tale, with Toraja at its center. \u201cHere God created man\nin heaven, and woman from the Earth,\u201d he says. Looking out over lime green\nterraced rice fields framed against an aquamarine sky, it\u2019s easy to believe\nthat God chose this to be his Eden.\n\nTini Patiung breaks down moments before a group of men carry her mother to her\ngrave. Ester Patiung died ten months earlier, at age 62; her body was kept in\nthe family home as decisions were made about her funeral ceremony.\n\nKambuno continues: God gave the gifts of bamboo and bananas from the Earth and\nbetel and lime from the heavens. \u201cHe commanded us to use these things that\ngive people pleasure to ease our grief, to make ourselves feel happy if we are\nsad when someone dies.\u201d\n\nI realize I\u2019m asking the wrong question. Torajans, it appears, are probably\nmore deeply connected than we are to the way people everywhere feel death: the\ndesire to stay connected to loved ones in both body and spirit; to believe\nthat people don\u2019t ever really die permanently; and to have, and to become, an\nancestor. So the question isn\u2019t why do Torajans do what they do, but why do we\ndo what we do? How did we distance ourselves so much from death, which is,\nafter all, just a part of life? How did we lose the sense of being connected\nto each other, to our place in society, in the universe?\n\nKambuno gestures at his family crypt, which he says holds more than ten\nrelatives. \u201cMy father is in here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I am here, so he is not\nreally dead. My mother is in here, but I have daughters, so she is not really\ndead. My daughters have been exchanged for my mother. I have been exchanged\nfor my father.\u201d\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * DEATH\n  * RITUALS\n  * FAMILY LIFE\n  * PEOPLE AND CULTURE\n  * CEREMONIES\n  * MUMMIES\n\n## You May Also Like\n\nHISTORY & CULTURE\n\n### Who were the Tarim Basin mummies?
