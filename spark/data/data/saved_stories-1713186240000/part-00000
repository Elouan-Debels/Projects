(May 2021)  \n---  \nMechanism of Earthquake Early WarningExternal audio  \n---  \nEarthquake Early Warning alarm from NHK^[1] by ja:\u4f0a\u798f\u90e8\u9054^[2]  \nEarthquake Early Warning from the Real-time Earthquake Information\nCenter^[3]Notice:The audio for the Real-time Earthquake Information Center can\nno longer be used, due to the discontinuation of Adobe Flash Player.  \n  \nIn Japan, the Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) (\u7dca\u6025\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5831, Kinky\u016b Jishin Sokuh\u014d) is\na warning issued when an earthquake is detected by multiple seismometers.^[4]\nThese warnings are primarily issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA),\nwith guidance on how to react to them.^[5]^[6]\n\n## Introduction[edit]\n\nThe JMA has two EEW systems: one for the general public and another for the\nNational Meteorological and Hydrological Services.^[7]^[8] When a P-wave is\ndetected from two (or more) of the 4,235 seismometers installed throughout\nJapan, the JMA analyzes and predicts the approximate location of the\nearthquake's epicenter. This allows the JMA to notify people in affected\nprefectures by TV and radio if a strong earthquake is expected.^[8]\n\nAn Earthquake Early Warning is issued to warn the general public when an\nearthquake of 5 or higher on the Japan seismic scale is expected.^[9] An EEW\nforecast (\u7dca\u6025\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5831(\u4e88\u5831)) is issued to the National Meteorological and\nHydrological Services when an earthquake of 3 or higher on the Japan seismic\nscale (or 3.5 or higher on the Richter magnitude scale) is expected, or when\nthe amplitude of P- or S-waves measures more than 100 gals.^[9]\n\nThe system was developed to minimize earthquake damage and enable people to\ntake shelter or evacuate dangerous areas before the arrival of its strong\nsurface waves. It is used by railways to slow trains and by factories to halt\nassembly lines before the earthquake hits.^[4]\n\nThe effectiveness of the warning depends on the position of the receiver.\nAfter receiving a warning, a person has from a few seconds to a minute or more\nto take action. Areas near an epicenter may experience strong tremors before a\nwarning is issued.^[10]\n\nAfter the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, the EEW system and Japan's\ntsunami warning system were considered effective. Although the tsunami killed\nover 10,000 people, it is believed that the casualties would have been much\nhigher without the EEW system.^[11] In April 2011, the Chilean Subsecretary of\nTelecommunications said that their country hoped to establish a similar early-\nwarning system.^[12]\n\n## Hit rate[edit]\n\nThe JMA announced the Earthquake Early Warning hit (accuracy) rate for the\n2011 fiscal year on 31 May 2012. The hit rate is the percentage of warnings\nissued immediately on the detection of P-waves with a Japan Meteorological\nAgency seismic intensity scale (\u9707\u5ea6, shindo) number (0 to 7) within one shindo\nnumber of the measured earthquake.^[13]^[clarification needed]\n\nFor the fiscal years 2007\u20132009, the hit rate was 75 percent or higher (75\npercent in 2007, 82 percent in 2008 and 76 percent in 2009). The 2010 hit rate\nfell to 28 percent, due to the number of aftershocks following the 2011 T\u014dhoku\nearthquake (which occurred near the end of the 2010 fiscal year); before the\nearthquake, the hit rate was 72 percent. Measurement techniques have since\nbeen refined to ignore minor earthquakes, and the hit rate for FY2011\nincreased to 56 percent. The JMA intended to increase the hit rate to over 85\npercent by FY2015.\n\n### Inaccuracies[edit]\n\nAlthough EEW (Earthquake Early Warning) accuracy has been increasing, the\nfollowing erroneous alarms have been issued:\n\n  * March 11, 2011 \u2013 The earthquake warning for the Tohoku region underestimated the quake's intensity. (Thought to be max Shindo 6 Lower but it was seven. Also when announced it was expected Shindo 5 Lower.)^[14]^[clarification needed]\n  * August 8, 2013 \u2013 Although an emergency earthquake bulletin was announced at 16:56 JST from Kanto to Kyushu, no shaking was observed. Noise from the ocean-floor seismograph off southeastern Mie Prefecture was recorded at the same time as shaking from a magnitude 2.3 earthquake in northern Wakayama Prefecture.^[15]\n  * January 5, 2018 \u2013 An 11:02 JST earthquake warning for the Kant\u014d region and Fukushima Prefecture was an overestimation, caused by assessing concurrent earthquakes in Toyama Prefecture (magnitude 3.9) and Ibaraki Prefecture (magnitude 4.4) as a single quake.^[16]\n  * July 30, 2020 \u2013 The epicenter of a 5.8 magnitude earthquake south of Japan was miscalculated, causing the EEW to overestimate the size of the earthquake to be at a magnitude of 7.3, as well as erroneously placing the epicenter to much closer to Japan's main island, Honsh\u016b, than it actually was. There were no reports of any significant tremors.^[17]\n  * July 28, 2022 \u2013 At 16:05 JST an earthquake warning was issued for the area between the Kanto and Kyushu regions (with magnitude 5-), but no shaking was observed. The warning was quickly cancelled afterwards. It might have been caused by the noise of lightning strikes.^[18]\n\n### Improvements[edit]\n\nTechnical improvements are being made to increase the hit rate, including the\nIntegrated Particle Filter (IPF) and Propagation of Local Undamped Motion\n(PLUM) methods. The IPF method, introduced on 14 December 2016, obtains\nseismic source elements with a particle filter.^[19]^[20] The PLUM method,\nintroduced on 22 March 2018, predicts the seismic intensity directly from\nobserved intensity without estimating the hypocenter and scale. Accurate\nseismic-intensity forecasts can be made for large earthquakes or those whose\nhypocenter is unknown.^[21]^[22]\n\n## Broadcast format[edit]\n\n### Television[edit]\n\nOn NHK television channels and other Japanese TV broadcasters (ISDB, including\n1seg),^[23] an alert is a message window on the screen with the earthquake\nepicenter (shown as a red X with a white outline) and areas affected by strong\ntremors. Two sets of chimes sound, followed by a voice announcement in\nJapanese: \"This is an Earthquake Early Warning. Please prepare for powerful\ntremors.\" (\u300c\u7dca\u6025\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5831\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5f37\u3044\u63fa\u308c\u306b\u8b66\u6212\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u300d, \"Kinky\u016b Jishin Sokuh\u014d desu. Tsuyoi yure\nni keikai shite kudasai.\") In addition to NHK, the announcement is used by\nFuji TV, TV Asahi and Tokyo MX. Nippon TV and TBS shorten it to \"Kinky\u016b Jishin\nSokuh\u014d desu\" (\"This is an Earthquake Early Warning\"). TV Tokyo sounds a set of\nchimes, without a voice announcement.\n\nThe alerts also inform viewers of possible landslides or a tsunami caused by\nthe quake in the affected area. If tsunami warnings are issued, the system\nutilizes 1seg to automatically turn on (and tune to NHK) all radios and\ntelevisions with 1seg technology in at-risk areas. In addition to Japanese,\nthe warnings are broadcast in English, Mandarin, Korean and Portuguese.^[24]\n\n### Mobile-phone networks[edit]\n\nJapan's three major mobile phone carriers\u2014NTT docomo, au (KDDI and Okinawa\nCellular) and SoftBank Mobile\u2014have developed Cell Broadcast systems to send\nmultiple users an SMS of the EEW.^[25]^[26]^[27]\n\nIt is mandatory for 3G cell phones sold after 2007 to receive this service,\nalthough foreign manufacturers such as Nokia, Apple, HTC, LG and Samsung are\nexempt. In August 2011, Apple announced that its iOS 5 iPhone platform would\nsupport EEW notification.^[28]\n\n## Other[edit]\n\n### NTT Docomo Inc.[edit]\n\nEEW is enabled by default on all models of the FOMA 905i series (FOMA\n905i\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba) released after 26 November 2007, and on some FOMA high-speed models\nin the FOMA 705i series (FOMA 705i\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba) released after February\n2008.^[29]^[30]\n\n### au[edit]\n\nThe system was enabled on all models in early 2008, including W61CA, W61H,\nW61K, W61SA, W61SH, W62SA and a few smartphone models, such as IS02 (TSI01).\nKDDI and Okinawa Cellular began free EEW broadcasts via au's SMS, C-mail\n(ja:C\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb), on 25 March 2008.^[31]\n\n### SoftBank Mobile[edit]\n\nOn 30 May 2007, SoftBank announced development of an EEW broadcast system\nsimilar to NTT docomo's and au's.^[32] Deployment of the system was originally\nplanned for FY2008, but was postponed for two years. On 25 August 2010, EEW\nservice began on Shikoku, in the Kansai, T\u014dkai, T\u014dhoku (seven prefectures) and\nCh\u016bgoku regions, and portions of the Kant\u014d region. The EEW broadcast network\nhas covered the whole country since 7 December 2010. The SoftBank 831N was the\nonly model supporting EEW in March 2011, although more models had been\nexpected to support the system after summer 2010.\n\n### Other[edit]\n\nRC Solution Company developed Yurekuru Call for iPhone, a free iPhone\napplication to receive EEW which is distributed on the Apple App Store; the\napplication is also available for Android. Notification of an EEW might be\ndelayed or blocked if communication lines are congested.^[33]^[34] The\nJapanese version of iOS 5 for iPhone has built-in EEW functionality.\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\nIris Ohyama EQA-001 FM EEW radio, front (upper) and rear views (lower) Power\nsupply with AC all the time, not battery, and quiet. When earthquake is\ndetected by Japan Meteorological Agency, this radio sounds alarm and message\nloudly.\n\nA specific, common chime tone from FM stations is automatically detected and\nturns on the radio (if in sleep mode), sounding a loud chime and broadcasting\nan EEW message before the quake begins by detecting S-waves. When the S-wave\nhas been analyzed, detailed information on the earthquake (such as seismic\nscale and areas under threat) is announced.\n\nThe following radios receive EEWs from radio stations and are free of\ninformation or connection fees:\n\n  * Iris Ohyama EQA-001^[35]supports this subject the Earthquake Early Warning (Japan) (EEW) (ja:\u7dca\u6025\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5831, Kinky\u016b Jishin Sokuh\u014d)\n  * Iris Ohyama EQA-101^[36]supports this subject the Earthquake Early Warning (Japan) (EEW) (ja:\u7dca\u6025\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5831, Kinky\u016b Jishin Sokuh\u014d)\n  * Uniden EWR200^[37] supports EEW and the Emergency Warning Broadcast system (ja:\u7dca\u6025\u8b66\u5831\u653e\u9001, Kinky\u016b Keih\u014d H\u014ds\u014d)\n  * P2PQuake (P2P\u5730\u9707\u60c5\u5831, P2P Jishin J\u014dh\u014d) recognizes NHK Radio 1 announcers.\n\nEEW broadcasts can be received in areas without broadband Internet access.\nSignal quality, speed and service area may vary from station to station.\n\n#### Stations[edit]\n\n  * NHK Radio 1 and Radio 2, nationwide\n  * JOGV-FM (bayfm78), Chiba^[38]\n  * JOAU-FM (Tokyo FM), Tokyo^[39]\n  * JOAV-FM (J-Wave), Tokyo^[40]\n\n### Cable television[edit]\n\nRental JCN EEW receiver for Funabashi-Narashino\n\nJapanese cable TV stations offer EEWs. Japan Cablenet (\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8) (JCN)\nrents a receiver which notifies the user of the estimated Shindo scale and the\ntime remaining (0 to 5 seconds).^[41]^[42] Some cable-TV stations also\nbroadcast EEWs on FM community radio stations and provide free equipment to\nprefecture and municipal facilities.\n\n### Internet[edit]\n\nWeathernews (\u30a6\u30a7\u30b6\u30fc\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba), a weather-information company, began a paid EEW\nservice (The Last 10 Seconds) on October 15, 2007.^[43]^[44]^[45] The service\nrequires a computer running Windows 2000 or later with an always-on connection\nto the Internet. The EEW application can be configured to receive information\non earthquakes with a JMA magnitude of 3.5 or higher or with a seismic\nintensity of 3 or higher. Newer versions of the program allow for the\nannouncement of lower-intensity earthquakes. The program announces the\napproximate location of the epicenter, the expected JMA seismic intensity and\ndisplays a countdown to expected major shaking.\n\nANET (ANET, \u30a2\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8), a disaster-prevention technology company which is part of\nthe Railway Technical Research Institute Group, released an application\n(EQMessenger) to receive ANET Alert on 7 July 2008. This deciphers and\nbroadcasts EEW information on the epicenter, the estimated seismic intensity\nat the user's location, and the time remaining before the arrival of the\nS-wave.^[46] When the estimated seismic intensity exceeds the preset level,\nEQMessenger can sound a warning and display the epicenter, intensity\nestimation and the arrival of the tremor on a pop-up map. A similar, free\nWindows program, SignalNow Express, was made available by the Strategy\nCorporation (\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c6\u30b8\u30fc\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e) after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake.^[47] A free multi-\nplatform program, that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, JQuake, was released\non February 14, 2020 as an inspiration to another program called Kiwi Monitor.\nJQuake tracks information in real-time, and reports any tsunami events that\noccur.^[48]\n\n### EEW-capable devices[edit]\n\nThe Earthquake Early Warning logo used by the Japan Meteorological Agency is a\nNamazu (\u9bf0). Many earthquake-preparedness activities in Japan use the catfish\nas a mascot; in Japanese mythology earthquakes were caused by a giant catfish,\nor seeing catfish foretold an earthquake.^[49]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Earthquake warning system\n  * Earthquake prediction\n  * Emergency Warning Broadcast system\n  * J-Alert\n  * Cell Broadcast\n  * Specific Area Message Encoding\n  * Weather radio\n  * ShakeAlert\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ giving guidelines\n  2. ^ Sankei-MSN News (2011-05-01 21:55) \"The Earthquake Early Warning \u2013 the chime contained the tone of pains, even examined the 'Godzilla'\" \u7dca\u6025\u5730\u9707\u901f\u5831...\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30e0\u306b\u82e6\u5fc3\u306e\u97f3\u8272 \u300c\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9\u300d\u306e\u691c\u8a0e\u3082 (in Japanese).
