Don't count on it\n\nWith homebuying becoming increasingly unaffordable for most prospective\nhomeowners across the country, an average of just 20% of Gen Z adults and\nmillennials own a home, the survey found. That compares to 21% of respondents\nfrom those same age groups, on average, who said that they own crypto.\n\nSplit up even further, just 13% of Gen Z (defined as aged 18 to 26 at this\npresent time) own real estate, while 20% own cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, 24% of\nmillennials (aged 27 to 42) say they own real estate, while 22% own crypto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Millennial and Gen Z \u2018nepo-homebuyers\u2019 are about to flood the\nhousing market\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Policygenius commissioned YouGov to poll 4,063 Americans age 18 or older,\nfrom Oct. 16-19, 2023.)\n\nThis is not surprising given the strained U.S. housing market. Whereas for\nolder generations, homeownership was a key milestone and one of their earliest\n(and largest) investments, that dream is out of reach for many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHome prices climbed 6.4% in February compared with a year earlier, selling for\na median price of $412,227, according to Redfin. Mortgage rates, too, have\nstayed elevated well above pre-pandemic levels as a result of the Federal\nReserve bank\u2019s inflation-fighting campaign, which has left interest rates at a\n23-year-high of between 5.25% and 5.5%.\n\nThe average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is hovering around 7%, stuck at\nalmost double what it was just five years ago, according to Bankrate\u2019s weekly\nnational survey of large lenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in another major generational divide between Gen Z and Baby Boomers, more\nGen Zers said they own cryptocurrency rather than stocks. Meanwhile, just 10%\nof Boomers (aged 59 to 77) reported owning cryptocurrency and 27% own stock.\n\nBut it\u2019s not for lack of wanting. Nearly two-thirds of Gen Z and millennials\nbelieve the stock market is a great place to build wealth and invest,\naccording to the Youth & Money in the USA poll carried out by CNBC and\nGeneration Lab in late January. But many simply don\u2019t have enough savings or\nleftover cash to invest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond found that as people get\nolder, they tend to invest more and more of their money in the stock market.\nBut with alternatives like crypto and non-fungible tokens, it\u2019s also possible\nthat younger generations will turn to other investment methods even as they\nage.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
