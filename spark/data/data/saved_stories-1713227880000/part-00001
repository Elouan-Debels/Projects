Balbir Bakhshi, Chief Risk Officer, London Stock\nExchange Group Ian Hogarth, Chair, Phasecraft, AI Safety Institute; Partner,\nPlural Connor Leahy, Founder and CEO, Conjecture; Co-founder, EleutherAI\n\nJoe Maher/Fortune Brainstorm AI\n\nManaging artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on society isn\u2019t the responsibility\nof private companies, the founder of a non-profit AI research lab has said.\nInstead, it\u2019s elected governments that should regulate the sector adequately\nto keep people safe.\n\nSpeaking at Fortune\u2019s BrainstormAI conference in London on Monday, Connor\nLeahy, co-founder of EleutherAI, said the onus of how transformational\ntechnologies will impact the public shouldn\u2019t be placed on the tech industry.\n\n\u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t even have to answer\u201d society-wide questions about AI,\nLeahy told Fortune\u2019s Ellie Austin.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThis might be controversial ... but it\u2019s not the responsibility\nof oil companies to solve climate change.\u201d Instead, he said it is the role of\ngovernments to stop oil companies from causing climate change \u201cor at least\nmake them pay to clean it up after they\u2019ve caused the mess.\u201d\n\nRather than guardrails coming from within the industry, they should cascade\ndown from the government level\u2014at least when it comes to society-wide issues,\nhe added.\n\nThe boss of EleutherAI\u2014which launched in 2020 and operates primarily through\nan open Discord server\u2014said responsibility does lie with businesses, however,\nwhen it comes to expectations of how much AI can do.\n\nAt present the tech is \u201csuper unreliable\u201d he continued, adding it does not\nhave \u201ca human level [of] reliability.\u201d\n\n## AI leaders want to be regulated\n\nSome of the most prominent voices in the tech industry agree with Leahy, with\neven disruptors in the sector imploring the government for some safety nets.\n\nSam Altman the boss of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, told a Senate Judiciary\nsubcommittee in May of last year that \u201cthe regulation of AI is essential.\u201d\n\nHe came out in favor of \u201cappropriate safety requirements, including internal\nand external testing prior to release\u201d for AI software and also urged some\nkind of licensing and registration regime for AI systems beyond a certain\ncapability.\n\nHowever, the fired-and-rehired billionaire CEO also called for a governance\nframework that is \u201cflexible enough to adapt to new technological developments\u201d\nand said that regulation should balance \u201cincentivizing safety while ensuring\nthat people are able to access the technology\u2019s benefits.\u201d\n\nLikewise Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2014who is utilizing AI for everything from large\nlanguage model Grok to humanoid robot Optimus and autonomous driving\u2014said that\nregulation will be \u201cannoying\u201d but necessary.\n\nDuring a conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during the UK AI\nSafety Summit, Musk said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve learned over the years that having a\nreferee is a good thing.\u201d\n\n## In the works\n\nCEOs pining after some regulation that will be suitable for multiple markets\nmay have had their wishes granted in recent weeks.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. and U.K. governments signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding pledging to a shared approach of AI safety testing and guidance.\n\nThe governments will work closely with each other and seek other nations to\njoin their approach.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at the time: \u201cOur partnership makes\nclear that we aren\u2019t running away from these concerns\u2014we\u2019re running at them.\n\n\u201cBy working together, we are furthering the long-lasting special relationship\nbetween the U.S. and UK and laying the groundwork to ensure that we\u2019re keeping\nAI safe both now and in the future.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
