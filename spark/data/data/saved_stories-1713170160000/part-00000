There are two ___.\n\nYou\u2019ve just participated in one of the most famous linguistic experiments of\nall time, called the Wug Test.\n\nWhen this study was conducted in 1958, linguists didn\u2019t yet know whether\nchildren memorized plural forms of nouns on a case-by-case basis, or were\nlearning a more general rule of adding \u201c-s\u201d.\n\nRegular nouns like \u201ccat\u201d / \u201ccats\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d / \u201cdogs\u201d made it seem like they\nlearn the general rule, but irregular nouns like \u201cmouse\u201d / \u201cmice\u201d and \u201cman\u201d /\n\u201cmen\u201d made it seem like they memorize individual words.\n\nBut English plurals are more complicated than just adding an \u201c-s\u201d. That \u201c-s\u201d\nhas three different pronunciations depending on the sound that comes before\nit:\n\nafter voiceless consonants \u2192 /s/\n\ncat /k\u00e6t/ \u2192 cats /k\u00e6ts/\n\ncup /k\u028cp/ \u2192 cups /k\u028cps/\n\nafter voiced consonants \u2192 /z/\n\ndog /d\u0251g/ \u2192 dogs /d\u0251gz/\n\nbed /b\u025bd/ \u2192 beds /b\u025bdz/\n\nafter sibilants \u2192 /\u026az/ (with an extra vowel)\n\nhouse /ha\u028as/ \u2192 houses /ha\u028as\u026az/\n\n\u201cmaze\u201d /ma\u026az/ \u2192 \u201cmazes\u201d \u2192 /ma\u026az\u026az/\n\nThis is a complex rule! Do children learn this rule, or do they just memorize\nindividual plurals?\n\nTo test this, linguist Jean Berko Gleason created new words for toys (like the\nwug) and prompted children to give the plural form. This would check whether\nchildren could apply these rules to totally new words they had never heard\nbefore. If they did, that would demonstrate that children were in fact\nlearning the rule rather then memorizing the plural for individual words.\n\nGleason found that children learned the above rules gradually, in the order\n/s/ > /z/ > /\u026az/. Young children couldn\u2019t answer correctly, but by age 6 they\ncould apply all the rules to words they had never encountered.\n\nThe coolest part? The order in which children acquire those different plural\nforms matches universal tendencies about language itself. Voiceless consonants\nlike /s/ are much more common in the world\u2019s languages than voiced consonants\nlike /z/. Some languages don\u2019t even have voiced consonants.\n\nFurther Reading: \"The infinite gift: How children learn and unlearn the\nlanguages of the world\"\n\nhttps://amzn.to/3xsTuv5\n\nOriginal Research Study:\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/.../00437956.1958.11659661\n\n#linguistics #language #acquisition #grammar #pronunciation #child #children\n#wug #wugs #words #science\n\nAll reactions:\n\n1.7K\n\n373\n\n444\n\nLike\n\nComment\n\nMost relevant\n\nValerie Kinghorn\n\nI automatically went with wugs.\n\nBugs, rugs, tugs, plugs...this seemed aligned and while I\u2019m sure there are\nexceptions, none came to mind.\n\n109\n\n  * 12h\n\nView all 5 replies\n\nAshish Dha\n\nAwesome thanks for sharing this, TIL...\n\n  * 7h\n\nJeanne Denski Norskov\n\nWhen my daughter was 2, she wanted to go out and play in the snow.
