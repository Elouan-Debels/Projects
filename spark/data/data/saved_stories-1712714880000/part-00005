I have a maxima package in incoming. Maxima is released under\n> the GPL by its author. The U.S. Department of Energy, however, placed a\n> condition on its public release, namely that the following file accompany\n> the source distribution:\n> =============================================================================\n> DOE requires the following paragraph to accompany the distribution. It\n> allows unrestricted export to most countries of the world, but does prohibit\n> exports from the US to certain countries such as Cuba or Iraq. \"Distribution\n> of this derivative work is subject to the US Export Administration\n> Regulations (Title 15 CFR 768-799), which implements the Export\n> Administration Act of 1979, as amendeded, and/or the International Traffic\n> in Arms Regulations, of 12-6-84, (Title 22 CFR 121-130), which implements\n> the Arms Export Control Act (22 USC 2728) and may require license for\n> export.\"\n> =============================================================================\n> Here is what the author had to say about this requirement:\n> =============================================================================\n> I was unable to get DOE to release it under any other condition. Actually\n> sending most things to those countries is illegal anyway. They did agree at\n> least that the site did not have to 'check' or implement ways to limit\n> access. Merely state that distributing there was not legal. william\n> =============================================================================\n> And here is what helpful Debian developer James van Zandt noticed:\n> =============================================================================\n> I note that section 8 of the GPL expressly allows geographic limitations on\n> distribution in case of copyright or patent issues, but does not mention\n> other reasons. - Jim Van Zandt\n> =============================================================================\n> So is this DFSG free? Please respond to me directly, as I haven't the time\n> to peruse this list. Thanks!
