If\nyou just want to get to the stupid trick part, you can skip ahead. If you want\nto feel a little of my pain, then read on.\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow me on twitter, you probably didn\u2019t see that last fall we\nwere fortunate enough to move into a newly built home. And it\u2019s just lovely,\nreally it is.\n\nAnd like anything worth doing well, it took time.\n\nWhen we started well over a year ago in our goal of finding/making our new\nhome, I had three basic needs:\n\n  * The mortgage needs to be reasonable\n  * I need a dedicated office in the house\n  * The house needs to support high speed internet (by which I mean cable or fiber, not DSL)\n\nThat last bulletpoint was actually critical in passing on a few locations we\nwere looking at. Just about every single address will always pass for DSL (as\nlong as you\u2019re not out in the total middle of nowhere), but having worked for\na DSL reseller in the past I was all too familiar with the wide variations in\nspeed and how absolutely crucial it was to be very close to the nearest\ncentral office for anything remotely speedy (Dearest reader: We were not\nplanning to live close to any CO).\n\nAs it turns out, checking for high speed internet service where a house\ndoesn\u2019t actually exist yet is somewhat non-trivial. I thought it was good\nenough to check whether service was available at every other address on the\nstreet.\n\n... This was, in fact, not enough.\n\nWe had already almost completed build, were waiting on some last few things,\nand were rapidly approaching obtaining the last inspections for occupancy when\nI decided \u201cLooks like the perfect time to start getting that cable internet\nconnected!\u201d\n\nI knew immediately I was headed for problems when my freshly minted (~ 1-2\nmonths) address didn\u2019t register as an address for even a basic service check.\n\nSo I called them up.\n\nThem: \u201cOh! It looks like your address isn\u2019t in the system yet. We\u2019ll need to\nget you scheduled for a service availability check for your site location.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSounds great, let\u2019s do that!\u201d So I provide all my contact information -\nsurely I will learn that this was just a blip on my journey to the information\nsuper highway.\n\nTime passes. 1 week. 2 weeks. Nothing.\n\nSo I call back to check on how that\u2019s going.\n\nThem: \u201cOh! It looks like the check was done. You should have been told that\nservice might be available at your location, but they\u2019d have to do an\nassessment to see what work would be required.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cOh. Ok. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d I am informed this may take several more weeks. I\nexpress my concern that I didn\u2019t hear anything back last time and I\u2019m doubly\nassured that this time I will surely get a call back.\n\n... History repeats itself. I call back, again irritated at having heard\nnothing.\n\nThem: \u201cOh! Hmm. It looks like this was done. You didn\u2019t hear anything? Let me\nsee if I can get the results.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cAh. It says here that they will have to run a new buried service line\nto your address.\u201d\n\nYou see, as it turns out, even though the entire neighborhood had service,\nthis cable company had decided that it was a brilliant idea to not actually\nprovide cabling to all lots in the area when service was initially introduced\nbut to instead only do it for locations which at the time had existing houses.\n\nMe: \u201cOh, that should be fine. We had conduit put in to the house from the\npropery edge, so just run it through that.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cWell, it looks like the place where service is located at is actually\nhalf way down the street from you. They would need to run a cable from that\nlocation to your conduit. It looks like they estimate it could cost as much as\n$14,000.\u201d\n\nI now understood why they hadn\u2019t called me back.\n\nThey had a shut-the-fuck-up-and-go-away back of the napkin estimate and they\nexpected I\u2019d balk when hearing it. Either that or they were still just very\nbad at customer service and had once again failed to get back to me.\n\nBut what the cable company didn\u2019t know was that the house construction was\nunder budget.\n\nWe had the money to do this.\n\nMe: \u201cOk! Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\n\n... There was momentary silence on their end. I don\u2019t think they get this\nresponse very often. I think they were a bit lost on what happens next.\n\nThem: \u201cOhhh. Uh. Ok. We\u2019ll need your contact information to get an initial\nsurvey scheduled with actual pricing for the estimated work involved.\u201d\n\nSo I gave them my contact information. For the third time. I expected to never\nhear from them again. I was mostly right.\n\nI heard from someone, but it wasn\u2019t the cable company. It was a third-party\nescrow company who was contracted to hold onto the funds on my behalf for the\ninitial survey and the actual work to be done.\n\nThis person reached out to me themselves. They were informative. They were\neasy to get in contact with. They were responsive! All of the things the cable\ncompany had not been so far. It was a pleasure talking to them.\n\nWorking with them, an initial assessment was done by someone who showed up and\ntook photos of the street and portions of my property. After they drew up the\nplans of what would need to be done and those were sent back, a grand total\ncloser to about $11,000 was finally settled on. I went through a series of\nelectronic documents, paid the money to escrow, and then got the saddest news.\n\nNice person: \u201cI just want to let you know, this could take up to 6 months.\u201d\n\n6 months ?!?!!? To go like 200 feet to my conduit !?!?\n\nMeanwhile, we were already in the process of selling the old house as we\u2019d\njust passed final occupancy inspection for the new one.\n\nSo I'm in a bind. I need internet - for work, for the kids, for family\nharmony.\n\nBut it could be 6 months before it gets here? What do I do??\n\nStarlink was out. I live in a forest, no good view on the sky.\n\nCellular? I get 1 bar of LTE on a good day.\n\nIdea: Maybe if I covered a neighbor\u2019s bill, I could use theirs? Turns out -\nyes! One of them was willing!\n\nNow - we wanted to live where we weren\u2019t directly in our neighbor\u2019s business.\nWe have a couple acres. We\u2019ve got several hundred feet between ourselves and\nthe remote beginnings of anyone next door.\n\n... so maybe run a cable?\n\nProblem: The ethernet standard, if you\u2019re not familiar with it, promises you\n100 meters before you\u2019ll need a repeater. In feet, that\u2019s just shy of 330\nfeet. And my neighbor was easily 2x that. A repeater isn\u2019t going to cut it.\nI\u2019d need power half way down the line - maybe twice. And outdoor rated\nrepeaters. More connections, more problems - sounds like a recipe for\ndisaster.\n\nHow about coaxial? Have you heard of MoCA? It sounds like it would be perfect.\nBut no, it generally has the same distance limitations of ethernet (at least\nfor the consumer gear you\u2019re likely to get your hands on).\n\nAnd fiber wasn\u2019t the best of ideas either. Besides being expensive and hard to\nwork with, I had concerns about it surviving outdoors for months on end above\nground in a forest (I sure as heck wasn\u2019t going to bury it the whole way).\n\n... so what about wireless point to point?\n\nNew problem: Like I said, I live in a forest:\n\nLine of sight wasn\u2019t really doable.\n\nSo what to do?\n\n.. as it turns out, DSL was actually the solution here. But not in the way\nyou\u2019d expect.\n\nYou can, in fact, become your own DSL provider(ish) with a pair of DSL\ntransceivers like these!\n\nThey effectively act like a patch cable, passing traffic from one end to the\nother at up to 100 Mbps and up to 7000 feet (though not at that speed at full\nlength). All you need is Cat5 or better inbetween and power at both ends.\nOrdered a 1000 ft spool of it and we\u2019re good to go. Perfect!\n\nSo I can wire up one end of this in my house, connected to my home router and\nAPs - but what about the other end?\n\n... How do I get something easily connected to a neighbor\u2019s internet but\nwithout inconveniencing them when they\u2019ve already been so generous?\n\nThe answer was in using a piece of equipment that I\u2019d long been a fan of, pre-\npandemic, when traveling - a GL.iNet travel router:\n\nThese things are my swiss army knife when it comes to solving networking\nchallenges. One of the modes you can put it into is as an ethernet extender\nfor an existing SSID. When power cycled, it\u2019ll come back up and try to re-\nassociate.\n\nSo all I needed was to connect one of these, configured to join my neighbor\u2019s\nguest wifi network (to keep his household traffic separate from mine) to one\nof the transceivers with a little power - and all I\u2019ll need to do is get it\nclose enough to his house for a strong enough signal. No wiring required on\nhis end aside from the power connection.\n\nSo I grabbed a fantastic waterproof outdoor box (seriously, I need to buy a\nfew more of these), combined it all together - and this wonderful little thing\nis what provided my household internet connectivity from October until\nFebruary - 5 months! - with only a single maintenance instance required the\nentire time (had to power cycle it after a neighborhood power outage brought\nup the network in the wrong order):\n\n(The white cable is power running into the box, the black cable is my outdoor\nrated Cat5 - those are the only connections made!)\n\nThe connection wasn\u2019t amazing - but it wasn\u2019t bad either! (60Mbit down, 12 up)\n\nThe story does have a happy ending.\n\nI now have a very happy internet connection:\n\nI hope this gives someone out there some new mental tools and ideas to try\nagainst this unforgiving world - The Packets Must Flow!\n\n\\- mike\n\nMichael Lynn hangs out at @mikeymikey All content copyrighted where possible.\nAll rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
