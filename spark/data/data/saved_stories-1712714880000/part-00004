Whichever path they choose, the last thing\non their mind is cancer. But cancer is occurring in more adults at younger\nages\u2014before they turn 40 or 50 and sometimes even earlier.\n\nThese are called \u201cearly-onset\u201d cancers, which are diagnosed in adults between\nthe ages of 18 and 49. Because advancing age is the top risk factor for cancer\nin general, the recent rise in early-onset cancers is worrisome.\n\nMany individuals in this age group are too young for recommended routine\ncancer screenings\u2014for example, mammography screening typically starts at age\n40 and colonoscopies at age 45. And busy lives make it difficult to keep up\nwith routine primary care visits, where family history might prompt a doctor\nto suggest an earlier screening. Others may not go to the doctor because they\nhave limited or no health insurance\u2014or they believe their health problems are\nnot serious enough to warrant a visit. This can result in diagnosis delays,\nwhich raise the risk of cancer potentially being diagnosed at a more advanced\nstage, which may be harder to treat.\n\nWhy are younger people getting cancer? \u201cIt's such an important question, and\nit points to the need for more research in all kinds of domains\u2014in population\nscience, behavioral health, public health, and basic science as well,\u201d says\nVeda Giri, MD, a Yale Medicine medical oncologist and director of Yale Cancer\nCenter\u2019s Early-Onset Cancer Program at Smilow Cancer Hospital, which brings\ntogether such components as research, clinical services, and care from psycho-\noncologic specialists, including psychiatrists and social workers.\n\n\u201cSo, right now, we are focusing on recognizing that early-onset cancer is a\ndifferent type of cancer and providing more support for these younger\npatients,\u201d Dr. Giri says.\n\nBelow, Yale Medicine specialists who care for patients with early-onset cancer\nanswer questions about the uptick in diagnoses and the importance of family\nhistory.\n\n## How are early-onset cancers different from other types of cancer?\n\nAge itself is the first and obvious difference. \u201cEarly-onset\u201d can be defined\nin various ways based on the cancer type. \u201cFor example, early-onset breast\ncancer refers to a diagnosis in someone younger than age 45, while early-onset\ncolorectal cancer is a diagnosis that occurs in someone younger than 50,\u201d says\nDr. Giri. \u201cTo be as inclusive as possible, the Early-Onset Cancer Program at\nYale is addressing the needs of patients diagnosed with cancer between the\nages of 18 and 49.\u201d\n\nAt age 50, cell damage begins to build up in the body, and the rate of cancer\nincidence climbs steeply through the following decades. A cancer diagnosis\nbefore age 50 is not uncommon, but it\u2019s also not the trajectory most people\nexpect, considering the median age for a cancer diagnosis is 66 years old.\n\nAnother difference is that certain cancers, such as breast cancer, tend to be\nmore aggressive in younger adults, says Yale Medicine\u2019s Mariya Rozenblit, MD,\na medical oncologist.\n\n\u201cWhile older women are more likely to be diagnosed with slow-growing,\nestrogen-positive tumors, younger women have more triple-negative and human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] breast cancers, which are more\naggressive types,\u201d Dr. Rozenblit says. The latter cancers often require more\naggressive treatments, especially if the cancer is already spreading in the\nbody, and those treatments can have significant side effects, she adds.\n\n\u201cYounger women diagnosed with breast cancer are also more likely to have a\ngenetic mutation than older women,\u201d says Dr. Rozenblit. But she cautions that\nwhile genetics are getting more attention, mutations like BRCA only account\nfor about 20% of early-onset breast cancers. \u201cSo, there are clearly other\ncontributing factors that we don\u2019t yet know,\u201d she says. \u201cThe good news is that\nonce breast cancer is diagnosed, the prognosis is usually very good. The\ntreatments can be long, but we still have very high cure rates, and these\nyounger women often end up doing extremely well.\u201d\n\nJeremy Kortmansky, MD, a Yale Medicine medical oncologist specializing in\ngastrointestinal cancers, also sees differences when younger adults are\ndiagnosed with colorectal cancer. \u201cSome of the molecular characteristics and\npathways of how something becomes cancerous are different between the older\nand younger groups,\u201d he says. \u201cYounger adults tend to have a more aggressive-\nappearing cancer. They also tend to present at a more advanced stage that is\nnot solely explained by a delay in diagnosis.\u201d\n\nSome of this may be explained by the fact that they are too young for routine\nscreening, but there's probably more to the story. We just don\u2019t have answers\nyet, he adds.\n\n## What types of cancers are on the rise in younger adults?\n\nWhile some cancers have been declining in older people, various reports and\nstudies have shown that cancer is on the rise in younger adults. One of the\nmost recent is Cancer Statistics, 2024, an American Cancer Society (ACS)\nannual report on cancer facts and trends. Published in January, the report\nrevealed that while cancer deaths are falling, new cases are ticking\nupwards\u2014from 1.9 million in 2022 to over 2 million in 2023.\n\nMore of those new cases involve younger people. The ACS report showed younger\nadults to be the only age group with an increase in overall cancer incidence\nbetween 1995 and 2020\u2014the rate has risen by 1% to 2% each year during that\ntime period.\n\nThe ACS report also showed continued increases in such common cancers as\nbreast, prostate, and endometrial in young adults, as well as colorectal and\ncervical cancers. Colorectal cancer, while still overwhelmingly a disease that\naffects older people, is now the leading cause of cancer death in men younger\nthan 50 and second in women in that age group. The numbers have been rising\nsteadily in people 55 and younger since the mid-1990s, according to the ACS.\n\nAs for cervical cancer, the ACS report had both good and bad news. Rates of\ncervical cancer dropped significantly in women in their 20s, who were among\nthe first to get the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which can prevent\nmore than 90% of HPV-attributable cancers. But for women ages 30 to 44, rates\nrose 1.7% each year from 2012 through 2019. The increase highlights the need\nfor more screening in younger women and a broader uptake for the vaccine,\naccording to the ACS report.\n\n## How can family history help adults who are too young for routine\nscreenings?\n\nBecause doctors and researchers don\u2019t yet know why early-onset cancers are\nincreasing, they are focusing on efforts to diagnose these cancers early, when\nthey are typically more treatable. And family history has emerged as a key\nfactor in early diagnosis.\n\nThis is partly because young adults don\u2019t always meet the recommended age for\nroutine screenings that are available for some of these cancers. For instance,\nbecause colonoscopy screening typically starts at age 45, most cases in adults\nyounger than 45 are not identified until they start noticing signs and\nsymptoms.\n\nBut talking to a doctor about a family history of colorectal cancer could\nprompt a screening referral at a younger age. \u201cIf there is a family history of\neither cancer or polyps, we usually start colonoscopy screening 10 to 15 years\nbefore the family member who had it was diagnosed,\u201d says Dr. Kortmansky. \u201cSo,\nif a first-degree relative was diagnosed with cancer at 45, you would start\nscreening at 30.\u201d\n\nLikewise, women who are at average risk for breast cancer may start\nmammography screening at age 40, according to U.S. Preventive Services Task\nForce (USPTF) recommendations updated in 2023. But women with a family history\nof breast cancer are generally advised to start when they are 10 years younger\nthan the first-degree relative (a mother and/or sister) was at their time of\ndiagnosis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to recognize that family history is very important,\u201d says Dr.\nRozenblit. \u201cFor young women who have a significant family history of cancer in\nthe family, we are starting to refer them to a high-risk clinic\u2014even if the\ncancer in their family is not breast cancer.\u201d\n\nDepending on family history, calculators can be used to further estimate a\npatient's cancer risk, and advanced screening like MRIs or other diagnostic\nprocedures may be offered, adds Dr. Giri.\n\n\u201cFamily history can inform genetic testing to find out whether a person has a\nmutation that makes them predisposed to developing a certain type of cancer,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cBut even if patients test negative for genetic mutations, family\nhistory may be a reason to follow them more closely.\u201d\n\n## How can early-onset cancer affect a younger adult\u2019s life?\n\nNancy Borstelmann, PhD, MPH, LCSW, co-director of Yale\u2019s Early-Onset Cancer\nProgram, says that while a cancer diagnosis and treatment are challenging for\nmost people, there are some heightened and unique concerns for someone in\ntheir 20s, 30s, or 40s.\n\nOne key example is family planning, since some cancers and treatments can\ncreate challenges with being able to become pregnant or produce sperm. \u201cIt\ndepends on each person\u2019s situation\u2014for example, their age, type of cancer, and\ntreatment plan. But patients may face a decision about freezing eggs or\nembryos, or whether to consider sperm banking,\u201d Borstelmann says.\n\u201cReproductive concerns can add to the distress that cancer patients are\nalready experiencing, and they are important issues for patients and their\ndoctors to discuss. Additional challenges include worries about insurance\ncoverage and the financial impact of taking steps related to family planning.\u201d\n\nYounger women may also be concerned that cancer treatment could pose a risk of\nearly menopause. Chemotherapy may induce menopause, or, in some cases,\nhormonal treatments are part of a treatment plan specifically designed to\nproduce an early menopause. Whatever the cause, Borstelmann notes, early\nmenopause shortens a person\u2019s fertility window and can have other effects on\ntheir overall physical and emotional well-being.\n\nBody image is yet another concern. There are many aspects to body image, but,\nfor some, a clearly visible issue to manage is hair loss, which can be a side\neffect of chemotherapy, Borstelmann says. \u201cFor some, it's very distressing.\u201d\n\nSexual function and sexual health issues are also common and can range from\nchanges in bodily sensation (for example, for a woman who has had a\nmastectomy) to erectile dysfunction (for example, after prostate cancer\ntreatment). Younger individuals diagnosed with any type of cancer, however,\nmay struggle with the direct or indirect impact of cancer on their sexual\nhealth and how they feel about their bodies. Some describe a sense of loss and\nfear related to developing or sustaining intimate relationships.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, because cancer is happening at such young ages, even after\ntreatment, there is the possibility that the cancer could come back, which is\nespecially difficult for survivors who still have decades of life ahead of\nthem. This is a particular concern for those with thyroid cancer, who face a\nrisk of recurrence that is highest in the first five years after diagnosis and\ntreatment, but persists throughout their lifetime, says Yale Medicine\nendocrine surgeon Courtney Gibson, MD, MS. \u201cSince the life expectancy of young\nadults remains largely unchanged after a thyroid cancer diagnosis, the fact\nthat recurrence can happen at any time is very unsettling,\u201d she says.\n\u201cHowever, we can provide reassurance that if it returns, we still have\neffective ways to treat it.\u201d\n\n## Is there any way to avoid early-onset cancer?\n\nThe advice on the topic\u2014for everyone\u2014remains the same: Pay attention to\nexercise and nutrition, don\u2019t smoke or drink too much alcohol, and be aware of\nfamily history and share it with a primary care physician, the doctors say.\n\nFollowing up with a doctor and fully checking out any unusual symptoms can be\ncritical, Dr. Kortmansky adds. \u201cThere is often a delay between the onset of\nsymptoms and the actual diagnostic procedure to find the cancer,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSome of that may be driven by patients who think, \u2018I'm only 40\u2014it's probably\nnot cancer, right?\u2019 Other times, a physician may think rectal bleeding in a\nyoung patient is just a sign of hemorrhoids, so it\u2019s important to advocate for\nyourself.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, no patient should feel guilty or ashamed if they are\ndiagnosed with cancer, Dr. Giri and Borstelmann say, describing two common\nreactions they say some of their young patients have. \u201cIt can be a human\nresponse to ask, \u2018Did I do something wrong?\u2019\u201d Dr. Giri says. \u201cI've seen this\nin some incredibly health-conscious patients who ate well and exercised. They\nfeel completely thrown by this and need to know it\u2019s not their fault.\u201d\n\nEach patient is different, and a key component of the Early-Onset Cancer\nProgram at Yale is to ensure that patients have a place where they can talk\nabout their feelings and experiences, Dr. Giri says. \u201cYoung people need to\nfeel supported and holistically cared for through the course of their cancer\nand beyond,\u201d she says.\n\nRead more Yale Medicine news\n\n### Related Specialists\n\nShowing 2 of 24\n\n  * ##### Veda Giri\n\nMD\n\nGenetics\n\n  * ##### Mariya Rozenblit\n\nMD\n\nMedical Oncology\n\nMore Related Specialists\n\n### Related Fact Sheets\n\nShowing 3 of 14\n\n  * #### Cancer Screening\n\nCancer screening is any method of looking for cancer before it causes symptoms\nand may be easier to treat.\n\n  * #### Diagnosing Cancer\n\nDoctors only diagnose cancer after ruling out other possible causes for\nsymptoms and performing tests to check and double-check the diagnosis.
