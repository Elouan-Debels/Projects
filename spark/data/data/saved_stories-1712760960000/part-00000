One way we achieve this is by determining the root cause\nof security vulnerabilities in Microsoft products and services. We use this\ninformation to identify vulnerability trends and provide this data to our\nProduct Engineering teams to enable them to systematically understand and\neradicate security risks. We also publish these trends publicly to share our\nlearnings and best practices, for example in Pursuing Durably Safe Systems\nSoftware.\n\nFor decades, we have used our own proprietary taxonomy to describe\nvulnerability root cause. Today, we are pleased to announce a significant\nshift: we will now publish root cause data for Microsoft CVEs using the Common\nWeakness Enumeration (CWETM) industry standard. We believe adopting CWE will\nbetter serve our customers, developers, and security practitioners across the\nindustry. This standard will facilitate more effective community discussions\nabout finding and mitigating these weaknesses in existing software and\nhardware, while also minimizing them in future updates and releases.\nUltimately, our commitment to CWE represents a meaningful step toward a more\ncyber-secure world. This work is core to the goals of Microsoft\u2019s Secure\nFuture Initiative (SFI), outlining our engineering priorities to transforming\nsoftware development, implementing new identity protections, and improving\ntransparency and faster vulnerability response, as articulated by Charlie\nBell, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Security. The CWE is a community-\ndeveloped list of common software and hardware weaknesses. A \u201cweakness\u201d refers\nto a condition in a software, firmware, hardware, or service component that,\nunder certain circumstances, could contribute to the introduction of\nvulnerabilities. Below is an example of Microsoft Windows CVE, including\ninformation related to CWE.\n\nAs an industry, we cannot manage what we cannot measure. Providing accurate\nCWEs for our own vulnerabilities, as well as encouraging our industry peers to\ndo the same, is key to systematically understanding, mitigating, and\neliminating whole classes of vulnerabilities. Other industries, such as the\nmedical and transportation sectors, are adept at categorizing and reporting\nfacts, both positive and negative. Our industry and customers will benefit\nfrom greater transparency and interoperability through CWE adoption.\n\nAdditionally, the CWE information provided will not only be displayed in the\nMicrosoft Security Update Guide but will also be available in the SUG CVRF API\nand instantiated on CVE.org and NVD.nist.gov.\n\nAs always, we look forward to your feedback which you can provide by clicking\non the rating banner at the bottom of every CVE page in the Security Update\nGuide.\n\nLisa Olson, Senior Program Manager, Security Release\n\n  * Security Update Guide\n\nPrevious Post\n\nNext Post\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * New Security Advisory Tab Added to the Microsoft Security Update Guide\n  * Reflecting on 20 years of Patch Tuesday\n  * Coming Soon: New Security Update Guide Notification System\n\n### How satisfied are you with the MSRC Blog?\n\n#### Rating\n\n#### Thank you for your feedback!\n\nWe'll review your input and work on improving the site.\n\nSubscribe\n\n### Categories\n\n  * MSRC (1066)\n  * Japan Security Team (1029)\n  * Security Research & Defense (380)\n  * BlueHat (190)\n  * Bug Bounty Programs (6)\n  * Microsoft Threat Hunting (5)\n\n### Tags\n\n  * \u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u60c5\u5831 (465)\n  * \u8106\u5f31\u6027 (248)\n  * \u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b6\u30ea (177)\n  * Internet Explorer (IE) (156)\n  * Security Update (140)\n  * Security Advisory (135)\n  * Security Bulletin (133)\n  * Mitigations (128)\n  * Community-based Defense (109)\n  * \u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u66f4\u65b0 (107)\n  * View all Tags\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Toward greater transparency: Adopting the CWE standard for Microsoft CVEs\n  * Embracing innovation: Derrick\u2019s transition from banking to Microsoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence team\n  * Update on Microsoft Actions Following Attack by Nation State Actor Midnight Blizzard\n  * Faye\u2019s Journey: From Security PM to Diversity Advocate at Microsoft\n  * Microsoft boosts its Microsoft 365 Insider Builds on Windows Bounty Program with higher awards and an expanded scope\n\n### Archives\n\n  * April 2024 (4)\n  * March 2024 (3)\n  * February 2024 (8)\n  * January 2024 (6)\n  * December 2023 (3)\n  * View full Archive\n\nEnglish (United States) Your Privacy Choices\n\n", "frontpage": false}
