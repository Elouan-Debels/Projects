How high will you ascend... and what\ntruths lie at the top?\n\n## Deckbuilding Galore\n\nNew slayers join the fray with their own sets of cards, mechanics, and\npersonalities. Try out more archetypes and master them at your own pace. The\nSpire forever awaits those who dare challenge it...\n\n## An Ever-Changing Spire\n\nThe Spire isn't what it used to be. Encounter all new enemies, events, and\ntreasures await as the rooms and items you discover change each time you\nplay... Try risky builds or play it safe as you explore countless different\nstrategies, find yourself in peculiar scenarios, and confront the Bosses of\neach Act.\n\n## New Ways to Play!\n\nThat aren't yet announced...\n\n## Rebuilt from the Ground Up\n\nSlay the Spire 2 was completely rewritten from the ground up in a new game\nengine! We're bringing in modern features, incorporating all-new visuals, and\nexpanding moddability.\n\n## Coming to Early Access. Again!\n\nSlay the Spire's success comes from our community! It sounds corny, but the\nextra mile many of you went to report issues, translate content/announcements,\ncreate long video essays, make excellent (lol) tier lists, and draw goofy or\ngorgeous fan art is the reason we're doing it all again. We love our job!\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## System Requirements\n\nWindows\n\nmacOS\n\nSteamOS + Linux\n\nMinimum:\n\n    * OS: TBD\n    * Processor: TBD\n    * Memory: TBD MB RAM\n    * Graphics: TBD\n    * Storage: TBD MB available space\n\nMinimum:\n\n    * OS: TBD\n    * Processor: TBD\n    * Memory: TBD MB RAM\n    * Graphics: TBD\n    * Storage: TBD MB available space\n\n* Starting February 15, 2024, the Steam Client will no longer support 32-bit games or macOS 10.14 or lower.\n\nMinimum:\n\n    * OS: TBD\n    * Processor: TBD\n    * Memory: TBD MB RAM\n    * Graphics: TBD\n    * Storage: TBD MB available space\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSee all\n\n## More like this\n\n#### Balatro\n\n13,99\u20ac\n\n#### Slay the Spire\n\n-75%\n\n22,99\u20ac\n\n5,74\u20ac\n\n#### SpellRogue\n\n15,99\u20ac\n\n#### HELLCARD\n\n16,79\u20ac\n\n#### The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth\n\n14,99\u20ac\n\n#### Inscryption\n\n19,99\u20ac\n\n#### Crypt of the NecroDancer\n\n-80%\n\n14,79\u20ac\n\n2,95\u20ac\n\n#### Monster Train\n\n24,50\u20ac\n\n#### Gloomhaven\n\n34,99\u20ac\n\n#### Goblin Stone\n\n24,50\u20ac\n\n#### LONESTAR\n\n9,75\u20ac\n\n#### Backpack Hero\n\n18,99\u20ac\n\nView all\n\n## What Curators Say\n\n3 Curators have reviewed this product.
