In this work, we explore this\n> concept within the context of language models. Specifically, we explore the\n> potential of self-training models on their own outputs, akin to how humans\n> learn and build on their previous thoughts and actions. While this approach\n> is intuitively appealing, our research reveals its practical limitations. We\n> find that extended self-training of the GPT-2 model leads to a significant\n> degradation in performance, resulting in repetitive and collapsed token\n> output.\n\nComments:| ICLR 2024  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.02305 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.02305v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.02305arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: David Herel [view email] [v1] Tue, 2 Apr 2024 21:03:37 UTC (6,066 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Collapse of Self-trained Language Models, by\nDavid Herel and Tomas Mikolov\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
