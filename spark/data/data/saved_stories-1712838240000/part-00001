Some sceptics claim that such\n\u2018psi phenomena\u2019 cannot possibly exist because they contravene the laws of\nscience. Any apparent evidence for them must be the result of factors such as\nfraud, coincidence, poor experimental design or questionable research\npractices. However, psi researchers continue to perform rigorous experiments\n(although perhaps not as often as they might like, due to a lack of funding)\nand often report significant positive results. And so the scientific debate\ncontinues, as it has for decades.\n\nAt the same time, significant numbers of the general population believe that\npsi exists. For example, a survey of 1200 Americans in 2003 found that over 60\nper cent believed in extrasensory perception (Rice, 2003). Not only that,\nsignificant numbers of people report experiences: in a 2018 survey, half of a\nsample of Americans reported they had had an experience of feeling \u2018as though\nyou were in touch with someone when they were far away\u2019 (in other words,\ntelepathy), and slightly less than half reported an experience of knowing\n\u2018something about the future that you had no normal way to know\u2019 (in other\nwords, precognition). Just over 40 per cent reported that they had received\nimportant information through their dreams (Wahbeh et al., 2018).\n\nIn 2018, American Psychologist published an article by Professor Etzel Carde\u00f1a\nwhich systemically reviewed the evidence for psi phenomena, examining over 750\ndiscrete studies. Carde\u00f1a concluded that there was a very strong case for the\nexistence of psi, writing that the evidence was \u2018comparable to that for\nestablished phenomena in psychology and other disciplines\u2019 (2018, p.663). A\ncommentary on the article from the British Psychological Society\u2019s Research\nDigest reported, \u2018on this basis, it is arguable that, as much as any other\nfield of psychology, there is at least something meriting investigation.\u2019\n\nIn a response to Carde\u00f1a, the sceptics Arthur Reber and James Alcock (2020)\nsimply argued that his conclusions couldn\u2019t be valid because psi was\ntheoretically impossible. \u2018Claims made by parapsychologists cannot be true ...\nHence, data that suggest that they can are necessarily flawed and result from\nweak methodology or improper data analyses\u2019 (2020, p.391). Like other\nsceptics, they simply argued that if psi were true, we would have to rewrite\nthe laws of science.\n\nOne argument in response from psi researchers is that there are many theories\nand concepts in quantum physics that allow for the possibility of psi, such as\nentanglement and non-locality (although this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that psi\ncan be explained in these terms). In these terms, psi is not against the laws\nof science at all.\n\nIn this debate, we turn to two of the UK\u2019s leading commentators and\nresearchers in the field of psi, Professor Chris French and Professor Chris\nRoe. The specific question we asked them to debate is: Will the debate about\nthe existence of psi ever be settled?\n\nChris French (Emeritus Professor and Head of the Anomalistic Psychology\nResearch Unit, Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London;\nauthor of The Science of Weird Shit: Why Our Brains Conjure the Paranormal)\n\nThe short answer to this question is as follows: if psi really does exist,\nthen potentially the debate about its existence may one day be settled; if\nnot, then the debate will probably rumble on forever without ever being\nresolved.\n\nLet me unpack that a little. To date, parapsychologists have failed to produce\nevidence for paranormal phenomena that is robust and replicable enough to\nsatisfy the wider scientific community that psi does indeed exist. Although\nsome critics of parapsychology argue that psi is theoretically impossible\nbecause its existence would violate fundamental laws of nature, this is not a\nposition held by all critics. In my personal opinion, the strongest evidence\navailable in support of psi, as summarised by Carde\u00f1a (2018), is certainly\nstrong enough to justify further research even if the effect sizes reported in\nvarious meta-analyses are typically very small. If parapsychologists could\nrefine their protocols in such a way that the effect sizes could be reliably\nincreased, the debate would be settled.\n\nAnother way in which the debate could be settled is by the discovery of just\none gifted psychic, capable of demonstrating their ability under properly\ncontrolled conditions. As William James famously pointed out, \u2018If you wish to\nupset the law that all crows are black, you mustn't seek to show that no crows\nare; it is enough if you prove one single crow to be white.\u2019 For example, some\nindividuals claim to be able to induce out-of-body experiences more or less at\nwill. If just one such individual could demonstrate an ability to reliably\nperceive targets in remote locations, that one \u2018white crow\u2019 would be\nsufficient to silence sceptics who argue that the out-of-body experience is\nhallucinatory.\n\nWhereas proponents of psi could, in principle, prove that psi exists, sceptics\ncould never prove that it does not. For well over a century, proponents have\nargued that the final definitive proof of the existence of psi is almost\nwithin reach, just around the next corner. For a variety of reasons, that\nmoment never seems to arrive \u2013 but one could never actually prove that it will\nnever arrive.\n\nHowever, we know enough about the shortcomings of human cognition to know that\neven if psi does not exist, many people will continue to believe that it does.\nAnomalistic psychologists focus their efforts on producing non-paranormal\nexplanations for reports of ostensibly paranormal experiences, often invoking\nsuch well-documented phenomena as hallucinations, false memories, the\nunreliability of eyewitness testimony, and a range of other cognitive biases.\nAlthough anomalistic psychologists could in principle never prove that psi\ndoes not exist, providing plausible non-paranormal explanations supported by\nstrong evidence tilts the balance of probability in the direction of\nscepticism.\n\nChris Roe (Professor of Psychology at the University of Northampton):\n\nBefore I respond to Chris\u2019s opening comments I want to echo Steve\u2019s point that\nbeliefs in a variety of psi phenomena are common across all cultures and can\nbe profoundly important to the people who hold them. The primary driver of\nbelief is direct, personal experience, but the experiencer often recognises\nthese phenomena to be problematic in seeming to contradict our everyday\nunderstanding of how the world works, and of our capacities as human beings.\nThey typically fear that they will be labelled as credulous, psychologically\nweak, or of suffering from some pathology, so tend to disclose details only to\nclose family and trusted friends. This creates a kind of taboo that can be a\nsignificant source of distress as they struggle alone to make sense of their\nexperiences. Parapsychology is concerned with providing a transparent\nevidence-based understanding of paranormal phenomena based on adherence to the\nscientific method and grounded in theoretical orthodoxy, but where these\nestablished principles are deemed inadequate, is committed to developing new\nexplanatory models.\n\nWithin parapsychology there is a long history of empirical research under\ncontrolled conditions, and this has generated a very substantial body of\nempirical work, some of which has been summarised by Etzel Carde\u00f1a (2018), as\nSteve has outlined. It would be untrue, then, to claim (as some commentators\ndo) that no evidence for parapsychological effects has been accrued under\ncontrolled conditions. Of course, it is another matter entirely for that\nevidence to be regarded as substantial enough to persuade the neutral observer\nthat we are dealing with real effects. Chris gives a summary of some of the\nmain objections that have been raised, which might reasonably cause such a\nperson to remain doubtful, and I\u2019ll respond to those briefly.\n\nHe focuses on the claim that parapsychological effects are not substantial\nenough to suggest we are dealing with anything more than a trivial anomaly. In\nhis review, Carde\u00f1a (2018) describes eleven different experimental methods and\nlists associated mean weighted effect sizes. These are mostly in the range of\nabout .1 to .2, so would be classed as small or very small following Cohen\u2019s\nscheme. But are they substantially different from other areas of psychology?\nThe Open Science Collaboration (2015), a coalition of 270 research\npsychologists that attempted to replicate findings from 100 psychology papers,\ngave a mean effect size of .20. Similarly, Sch\u00e4fer and Schwarz (2019) analysed\na random selection of 100 published empirical studies from each of 9 domains\nof psychology, and found that the median effect size, r, for pre-registered\nstudies was only 0.16. Claims that parapsychological effects are substantial\nenough to have real-world relevance seem reasonable, then, insofar as these\nother areas also lay claim to it.\n\nChris\u2019s second objection is that parapsychological effects are difficult to\nreplicate, and there seems to be a general expectation that \u2018real\u2019 effects\nshould be more or less replicable on demand (his \u2018white crow\u2019 example could be\ninterpreted in this way). But is this realistic when investigating human\nperformance? Where effects are relatively small they can be very sensitive to\nlow study power and sampling error, as well as to interaction effects of\nsecondary variables. This could produce a noisy picture in which even a real\neffect would still lead to some nonsignificant studies and even some that seem\nto show a reversed effect, but for which the overall pattern would still show\na mean shift in the predicted direction, as outcomes cluster around the actual\neffect size. Baptista and Derakhshani (2014) applied this logic to one\nparadigm in parapsychology that tested for extrasensory perception using\nganzfeld stimulation, and found that while there were a number of apparent\nfailures to replicate, the distribution of outcomes was actually very close to\nwhat one should expect given the overall effect size and the statistical power\nof the experiments. When effects are understood in statistical terms, then\nparapsychological effects seem to replicate lawfully.\n\nFinally, I agree with Chris that sceptics face an impossible challenge if they\nare expected to prove a negative. However, a constructive starting point would\nbe for them to offer explicit counter-explanations for the reported\nlaboratory-based effects, culminating in hypotheses that could be tested\nexperimentally. Currently, sceptics\u2019 objections are often so unspecified that\nthey, too, are immune from testing and possible refutation.\n\nChris French:\n\nI agree that both paranormal beliefs and, to a somewhat lesser extent, reports\nof ostensibly paranormal experiences are common in all cultures and can have\nprofound implications. Like Chris, I also strongly oppose assertions from\nuninformed sceptics that all such beliefs and experiences can be explained\naway in glib terms such as, \u2018All believers/experiencers are mad/stupid/liars\u2019\n(delete as appropriate). These beliefs and experiences are an important part\nof what it means to be human and we, as psychologists, need to do our best to\nexplain them.\n\nI also agree with Chris that it is simply wrong to assert that there is no\nevidence for parapsychological effects. As he goes on to note, the question is\nwhether that evidence is \u2018substantial enough to persuade the neutral observer\nthat we are dealing with real effects\u2019. That is where, I suspect, Chris and I\nwould disagree (although I think we would both acknowledge that we may be\nwrong).\n\nWith respect to the Open Science Collaboration report, it is clear that the\nauthors of that report are far from arguing that their analysis suggests that\nthe psychological effects concerned are \u2018substantial enough to have real-world\nrelevance\u2019. Quite the opposite. To quote the final sentence of the report,\n\u2018This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in\npsychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to\nverify whether we know what we think we know.\u2019 I think the same cautious\nattitude should be applied, arguably even more strongly, to parapsychology.\n\nChris appears to have misunderstood my \u2018white crow\u2019 argument. I was putting\nthat forward as an alternative means by which the psi debate could potentially\nbe settled (in favour of psi proponents) but it is quite separate from the\nfirst alternative, i.e., a single paranormal effect that is robust and\nreplicable enough to convince the wider scientific community that it is real.\nI am certainly not demanding 100 per cent replicability in either case. The\nproblem for parapsychology is that not one single paranormal effect exists\nthat is robust enough to form the basis of a psychology lab class with any\nreal hope that it would be demonstrated. In contrast, while not denying that\npsychology has its own problems with replicability, there are literally\nhundreds of psychological effects that are indeed almost 100 per cent\nreplicable.\n\nUnlike most sceptics, I have long argued that parapsychology is not a\npseudoscience (French & Stone, 2014). At its best, it is just as scientific\n(and sometimes even more scientific) than psychology. All sciences attempt to\nseparate true signals from the noisy data in their areas of interest. As Chris\nnotes, data in parapsychology are typically very noisy for a variety of\nreasons. The same is true of other social sciences, including psychology. What\nwould a science look like if, in fact, no true signals existed at all within\nthe noisy data? Would it perhaps look like parapsychology? Even if this is\ntrue, psychology can learn a lot about the limitations of the scientific\nmethod by studying parapsychology, especially with respect to its own\nreplicability crisis.\n\nTo return to the original question that we were asked to address, a\nsufficiently replicable paranormal effect would go a very long way towards\nsettling the psi debate in favour of the psi hypothesis. Carde\u00f1a\u2019s review of\nthe currently available evidence cites with approval the meta-analysis by Bem\nand colleagues (2015) of 90 experiments aimed at replicating the effects\nreported in Bem\u2019s original series of nine experiments. The largest effect size\nin that original series came from Experiment 9 which Bem claimed demonstrated\nretroactive facilitation of recall, i.e. that memory for words is better for\nwords that are rehearsed even if one does not rehearse the words until after\none\u2019s memory has been tested. We carried out three independent replication\nattempts and failed to find this effect (Ritchie et al., 2012). The 2015 meta-\nanalysis appears to confirm that the combined data from 27 experiments (total\nN = 4,601) aimed at demonstrating this effect failed to reach statistical\nsignificance.\n\nIn contrast, the combined results from 14 experiments aimed at demonstrating\nthe precognitive detection of rewarding stimuli (total N = 863), based on\nBem\u2019s Experiment 1, appeared to demonstrate a highly significant effect\n(effect size = 0.14, p = 1.2 x 10^-5). Had parapsychologists finally found the\nholy grail \u2013 a replicable paranormal effect? Or was this yet another false\ndawn for parapsychology? It appears that it was the latter, according to the\nresults of a recent large, multi-lab replication attempt which employed the\nmost rigorous methodology of any parapsychological investigation ever (Kekecs\net al., 2023). Bem himself approved the design of this study.\n\nAs I have written elsewhere (French, 2023), this replication attempt involved\nten laboratories from nine different countries. A total of 2,115 participants\ncontributed valid data to the study resulting in a total of 37,836 trials.\nThis sample is more than 20 times larger than Bem\u2019s original study and more\nthan twice as large as all 14 studies combined using this methodology included\nin the subsequent meta-analysis. Kekecs and his many colleagues reported a\nsuccess rate of 49.89 per cent \u2013 very close to what would be expected by\nchance.\n\nAs the authors concluded, \u2018the results tell us that (1) the original\nexperiment was likely affected by methodological flaws or it was a chance\nfinding, and (2) the paradigm used in the original study is probably not\nuseful for detecting ESP effects if they exist\u2019 (Kekecs et al., 2023).\n\nA cautious attitude towards the existence of psi appears to be justified for\nthe time being.\n\nChris Roe:\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring that Chris and I agree on many points, but it makes sense in\nmy closing comments to focus on areas where we disagree. Firstly, he\ninterprets the Open Science Collaboration authors as concluding that the work\nthey report has no real-world relevance, but surely the researchers who\ndevoted time and energy to these studies didn\u2019t set out with the expectation\nthat the effects they were interested in would be too small to have tangible\nconsequences? If our findings are only of \u2018academic\u2019 interest, then it seems\nto me we would be mostly wasting our time.\n\nChris is still confident that psychology is replete with effects that have the\nkind of reliability needed for them to provide the basis of a psychology lab\nclass. I must confess that despite having been involved in psychology research\nmethods workshops since 1990, I can\u2019t think of any psychological effect that\nwould meet this standard of robustness. Pretty much every class has had at\nleast one group whose data produced head scratching results that didn\u2019t accord\nat all with expectation. That\u2019s simply a function of the rich and complex\nsocial dynamic that is research with human participants.\n\nAs a result, though, actual data can look messy, and could lead one to\nspeculate that the findings from a disputed area such as parapsychology show\nus what science would look like if there were, in fact, no true signals in\nnoisy data. The tendency to see pattern in random data, termed apophenia, is\nwell-known, but it is also true that people can fail to see actual patterns\nembedded in noisy data. The controls afforded by the scientific method and the\njudicious use of statistical analysis help us to avoid both of these errors.\nCarde\u00f1a\u2019s paper is a good account of what the data suggest when this is\napplied to parapsychological claims.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that Chris picks up on Daryl Bem\u2019s research, which caused\nsuch controversy when it was first published. Indeed, commentators such as\nChris Chambers have seen its publication as a wake-up call for psychology to\ndeal with a range of questionable research practices (QRPs) that may have\ndistorted the published record. These lessons could perhaps have been learnt\nsooner if researchers had paid more attention to parapsychology. In the 1970s,\nparapsychology journals were already calling for pre-registration, encouraged\nsubmission of manuscripts based on reviews of the study design before the\noutcomes were known, and published null results to address file-drawer\nproblems. Parapsychology was one of the first disciplines to adopt statistical\nanalysis, randomisation, placebo control conditions, and meta-analysis.\nDouble-blind designs are still much more common here than in other areas of\nthe social sciences. Of course, there is still much room for improvement, but\nsweeping insinuations of \u2018poor methodology\u2019, which are sometimes made, seem\nmisplaced.\n\nThe initiative by Kekecs and colleagues (2023) is indeed an important\ndevelopment and is worthy of close attention. It certainly offers a gold\nstandard design with respect to precautions against QRPs \u2013 what we might call\nthe meta-experiment. However, I think this has been at the expense of paying\ndue attention to the experiment itself. We are told virtually nothing about\nhow participants were recruited, what instructions they were given about the\nexperiment, or under what conditions they were tested, as if these elements\nare unproblematic (I was surprised to learn from the lead author, for example,\nthat 60 per cent of the trials involved group testing). The project\ncollaborators were strikingly antipathetic to the notion of psi (they gave a\nmedian score of 1.5 on a 0-23 \u2018belief\u2019 scale). Despite the project managers\u2019\nbest efforts, I don\u2019t have confidence that the study is protected from\npsychosocial experimenter effects of the sort that have been well documented\nby Bob Rosenthal. I don\u2019t mention these things as a rhetorical way to set\naside this experiment, but it does draw attention to the impossibility of\ncreating a \u2018crucial experiment\u2019 in the social sciences, no matter how high\npowered.\n\nTo return to the opening question of whether the debate about the existence of\npsi can ever be settled: I sincerely hope so! The worst-case scenario is to\nmaintain beliefs that are untrue, no matter how comforting those beliefs might\nbe. To avoid this, we must be willing to adopt a truly sceptical position, in\nwhich we set aside our prior beliefs and prejudices and consider claims solely\non their empirical and methodological merits.\n\nReferences\n\nBaptista, J. & Derakhshani, M.
