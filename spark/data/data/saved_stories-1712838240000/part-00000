Multi-chip processing solutions come with\nsignificant power, area, and complexity overhead; instead, designers need\nsupport for flexible, real-time preprocessing, efficient AI inference, and\nhigh-performance postprocessing on a single device.\n\nToday, I\u2019m excited to announce that AMD is expanding its VersalTM portfolio to\nmeet this evolving need. AMD Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and AMD Versal Prime\nSeries Gen 2 adaptive SoCs deliver single-chip intelligence for AI-driven and\nclassic embedded systems\u2014balancing performance, power, area, functional\nsafety, and security capabilities.\n\nAchieve End-to-End Acceleration for AI-Driven Embedded Systems\n\nVersal AI Edge Series Gen 2 devices enable end-to-end acceleration with a\nunique integration of heterogeneous processors, supporting all three phases of\nembedded compute:\n\n  1. Preprocessing: Sensor processing, fusion, and data conditioning\n  2. AI Inference: Execution of deep-learning algorithms\n  3. Postprocessing: Decision-making and the resulting actions\n\nDuring preprocessing, programmable logic offers outstanding performance and\nflexibility, supporting custom sensor combinations and low-latency processing\npipelines that help improve system response time. In the next phase, AI\nEngines enable efficient AI inference with the AIE-ML v2 compute tile\narchitecture featured in the Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2. The MX6 data type in\nAIE-ML v2 offers up to 3X higher TOPS (trillions of operations per\nsecond)-per-watt than the AIE-ML compute tile architecture in first-generation\nVersal AI Edge devices.[1] During the postprocessing phase, AI Edge Series Gen\n2 devices easily handle complex decision-making and control algorithms with an\nenhanced system of integrated CPUs. The Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal\nPrime Series Gen 2 offer up to 10X more scalar compute vs. their first-\ngeneration counterparts.[2]\n\nThe second generation of the AI Edge Series includes a range of devices that\nallow engineers to readily achieve performance and safety targets for\napplications such as autonomous driving, smart cameras with sensor fusion, and\nmedical imaging.\n\nUnleash Next-Level Performance for Classic Embedded Systems\n\nVersal Prime Series Gen 2 devices offer extreme performance in a minimal\nfootprint, with flexible, real-time sensor processing\u2014easily handling complex\nembedded computing workloads. Combining world-class programmable logic with up\nto 10X the scalar compute of first-generation Versal Prime devices[2], these\nadaptive SoCs raise the bar for classic embedded systems (i.e., systems not\nrequiring AI).\n\nWith new hard IP for high-throughput video processing, including 8K multi-\nchannel workflows, Versal Prime Series Gen 2 devices are ideal for\napplications such as UHD streaming and recording, robotics, and flight\ncomputers.\n\nBringing Standout Adaptive Solutions and Tools to Market for 40 Years\n\nWhen you choose AMD Versal adaptive SoCs, you get access to a broad portfolio\nof devices and the confidence of working with a proven partner with 40 years\nof experience in embedded systems, including those serving high-security,\nhigh-reliability, long-lifecycle, and safety-critical applications.\n\nProductivity is key when designing these embedded systems, and our adaptive\nSoC design tools, libraries, and embedded software ecosystem boost\nproductivity and streamline design cycles. Combined with the latest Versal\ndevices, these resources give designers and system architects everything they\nneed to confidently design, develop, and scale embedded systems equipped for\ntoday and tomorrow.\n\nEnable Advanced AI, Control, and Video Applications with Second-Generation AMD\nVersal Adaptive SoCs\n\nAs compute requirements for both AI-driven and classic embedded systems grow,\ndelivering end-to-end acceleration in a single device is imperative. Adaptive\nsolutions that balance performance, power, area, functional safety, and\nsecurity are essential to meet and exceed evolving needs. At AMD, we\u2019re proud\nto deliver next-generation solutions for the automotive, industrial, vision,\nhealthcare, aerospace and defense, broadcast, and pro AV markets\u2014and beyond.\n\nLearn more about Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2\ndevices.\n\n1\\.
