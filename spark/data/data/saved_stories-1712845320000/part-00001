This is the stand I\u2019m using.\n\nVision Pro Chronicles is a MacStories series about our journeys with the\nVision Pro. In this series, we\u2019ll explore the potential of visionOS as a brand\nnew platform in our workflows and personal lives, share how we\u2019re using the\nVision Pro on a daily basis, and cover interesting apps and accessories for\nthe device.\n\nYou\u2019ll be shocked to learn that I\u2019m not using the Vision Pro in any of the\ndefault Apple configurations.\n\nAfter two months spent testing a variety of different options for bands,\nstraps, and other \u201cmounting\u201d solutions, I\u2019ve found my ideal setup. It looks\nsomewhat ridiculous at a glance, and it\u2019s not for everyone, but it allows me\nto use the Vision Pro for longer sessions.\n\nMost importantly, it helps me enjoy the Vision Pro more.\n\nLet\u2019s back up a little. What you\u2019re reading is the first installment of a\nbrand new series for MacStories and Club MacStories called Vision Pro\nChronicles. As the name suggests, we\u2019ll use this column to document our\njourneys with the Vision Pro. We realized a few weeks ago that it\u2019s impossible\nfor us right now to share a definitive opinion about the Vision Pro in a\nsingle, all-encompassing story that would also be enjoyable to read. Part of\nthe problem is that it\u2019s hard to condense into one article all our thoughts\nabout a brand new Apple computer and operating system. But there\u2019s also the\nfact that the visionOS software and landscape of Vision Pro accessories is\nrapidly changing before our eyes on a weekly basis.\n\nEvery day, John and I are coming across an interesting new app we want to\nstart using, or perhaps yet another accessory on Etsy that we want to try out.\nThe early days of a new Apple product are always an exciting opportunity for\nus; we want to make the most of it by frequently sharing what we\u2019re up to and\nhow the Vision Pro is changing how we work, consume media, and more.\n\nFor all these reasons, just like we kickstarted the Vision Pro App Spotlight\nseries after the Vision Pro\u2019s launch to cover the initial wave of visionOS\napps, the Vision Pro Chronicles series will give us a way to share, well,\neverything else we\u2019re doing with the Vision Pro.\n\nThat\u2019s the first half of the context necessary to understand this inaugural\nVision Pro Chronicles story. The other context you should know is that, soon\nafter receiving my Vision Pro in February, I quickly found myself largely\ndissatisfied with the default options for wearing it.\n\nLike others, I instantly fell in love with the feel and dial-based mechanism\nof the Solo Knit Band, but using it for sessions longer than 30 minutes was\nconsistently giving me headaches since my forehead was bearing all the\ndevice\u2019s weight and pressure. I then switched to the Dual Loop Band, which\nalleviated all of my comfort issues, and I kept using it for about a month. By\nholding the headset in place with a loop system in the back and at the top of\nmy head, the Dual Loop Band allowed me to use the Vision Pro for hours at a\ntime without feeling any pressure on my forehead or cheekbones. However, I\nfundamentally dislike how you\u2019re supposed to adjust the Dual Loop Band with\nvelcro. The Fit Dial in the Solo Knit Band is infinitely more elegant than the\nDual Loop\u2019s mechanism; even without seeing it, you can easily find the dial,\nturn it, and immediately feel what it\u2019s doing on your head.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I started accepting a simple fact: just\nlike I\u2019ve done with other Apple computers in my life, I\u2019d have to consider\nmodding the Vision Pro too. What I wanted didn\u2019t exist: a way to use the\nVision Pro with a \u201cdual knit band\u201d setup \u2013 one in the back, one at the top.^1\nAnd I had to figure out how to make that happen.\n\nEnter the beautiful world of the Vision Pro subreddit and Etsy. As I\ndiscovered, I wasn\u2019t the only person who\u2019d been looking for ways to use the\nVision Pro beyond Apple\u2019s default options. Over the past two months, a whole\ncommunity of modders and folks with 3D printers have come together to offer a\nselection of Vision Pro accessories that extend the device\u2019s compatibility\nwith either existing VR accessories or Apple\u2019s own Vision Pro bands. To see\nwhat I mean, just go to Etsy, search for \u201cVision Pro\u201d, and you\u2019ll get the\nidea. As you can see, there\u2019s a very common category of accessories: third-\nparty clips and mounting systems to use two Solo Knit Bands at the same time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m going to say next is not an exaggeration: I\u2019ve spent the past month\nbuying literally every single one of these adapters I could find. If you\u2019ve\nmade one of these and released it on Etsy, chances are you\u2019ll find a \u2018John\nVoorhees\u2019 in your purchase history^2. At this point in late March 2024, I have\ntested nearly all the options from Etsy; the two that are missing from my list\nare currently on their way from the United States to Italy.\n\nIn the process of testing these accessories, I\u2019ve also settled on something\nelse: whenever possible, I love using my Vision Pro without a light seal in an\n\u201copen\u201d configuration that, yes, lets more light in but also makes me more\naware of my surroundings with a larger field of view.\n\nSo, for this first installment of the Vision Pro Chronicles, let me go over\nhow I like to use the Vision Pro on a daily basis and how you can replicate\nthis setup yourself.\n\n## Dual Knit Bands\n\nI\u2019ll cut to the chase and tell you immediately what is, in my opinion, the\nbest Vision Pro accessory to use two Solo Knit Bands at the same time: it\u2019s\nthe SoloTop.\n\nOf all the adapters I\u2019ve tried, the SoloTop was the one with both the best\nbuild quality and the best angle for the Solo Knit Band you\u2019re going to place\non the top of your head to hold the Vision Pro. You don\u2019t need to try all the\nother adapters like I did; if you\u2019re looking for this type of product, just\nget the SoloTop.\n\nAllow me to explain how this works. The idea is that you want to add a second\nSolo Knit Band to the Vision Pro to relieve pressure from your nose and\ncheekbones, which is where you\u2019d usually feel the device\u2019s weight when using\nthe standard Solo Knit Band setup. To do this, the Vision Pro needs an extra\npair of connectors to attach a second Solo Knit Band, which is what the\nSoloTop provides.\n\nThe SoloTop adapter lets you use two Solo Knit Bands at the same time.\n\nThe SoloTop is comprised of two 3D-printed clips that you need to slide onto\neach Vision Pro Audio Strap. Once they\u2019re on, the Vision Pro\u2019s built-in strap\nconnectors will remain exposed, and that\u2019s where you can attach the Solo Knit\nBand that will rest on the back of your head as always. What the SoloTop adds\nis an additional pair of connectors for the band that goes above your head.\n\nThe additional mounting clip provided by the SoloTop is angled toward the\nback.\n\nNow, you may be wondering: what makes the SoloTop special compared to other\nadapters that roughly offer the same functionality? Besides the quality of the\nprinted material (it\u2019s smooth and precisely cut \u2013 a major difference from\nother sloppy clips I got on Etsy), it\u2019s the angle that makes the SoloTop a\nwinner in my book. You see, most adapters for two Solo Knit Bands have\nconnectors for the top one that make it sit perfectly horizontal on top of\nyour head, thus creating a 90-degree angle with the one in the back, like\nthis:\n\nThe 90-degree layout looks great in pictures, but it\u2019s not for me. (Source)\n\nThis looks good in photos, but, in practice, it\u2019s been horrible to use. With\nthe perpendicular layout, the top band ends up covering the part of your head\njust above the forehead, which, at least for me, was both uncomfortable and\nsilly-looking.\n\nThe SoloTop\u2019s creator, on the other hand, rightfully added some inclination to\nthe top connector so that the band is pushed diagonally toward the back of\nyour head, at least a little. This is what you want; with this configuration,\nthere\u2019s enough room between the Vision Pro\u2019s light seal resting on your\nforehead and the Solo Knit Band at the top, which you can adjust depending on\nhow far you want to lift the headset off your nose and cheekbones.\n\nThis is what I look like wearing my Vision Pro with the basic \u2018Dual Knit\nClosed\u2019 setup featuring the SoloTop, two Solo Knit Bands, and the light seal:\n\nMy \u2018Dual Knit Closed\u2019 setup.\n\nI\u2019ve been running this setup for nearly a month now, and I can\u2019t even begin to\nexpress a) how comfortable it is and b) how much I prefer adjusting the Solo\nKnit Bands to the Dual Loop Band. There are some real accessibility benefits\nto the simplicity of the Solo Knit Band\u2019s Fit Dial that I haven\u2019t found in any\nother Vision Pro band or strap, from Apple or otherwise.\n\n> There are some real accessibility benefits to the simplicity of the Solo\n> Knit Band\u2019s Fit Dial.\n\nThanks to two Solo Knit Bands, I can use the Vision Pro for hours without\ninterruptions or feeling any neck or head strain. The band\u2019s soft material and\nits large surface area make for a fantastic combo when it comes to balancing\nweight and removing pressure from my nose. If you can get past the potentially\nodd look caused by wearing two large bands at the same time, I can\u2019t recommend\ndoing this enough. And, of course, I hope Apple will consider bulkier, but\nmore comfortable, band configurations in the future.\n\nGet a smaller band for the top of your head.\n\nThat being said, I have some additional tips and notes to share if you want to\nreplicate this setup.\n\nFirst, I was asked by a few Club Discord members if using the SoloTop\nnegatively impacted sound quality of the Vision Pro\u2019s Audio Straps in any way,\nand I\u2019m pleased to report that it doesn\u2019t. The SoloTop doesn\u2019t directly touch\nthe speaker in the Vision Pro\u2019s side straps, so there\u2019s no issue on that\nfront. Also, since I started using the SoloTop, its creator released a \u2018Dev\u2019\nedition that is compatible with the Developer Strap. I have a Developer Strap,\nbut I don\u2019t use it since its functionality is so limited right now. If you\nkeep your Developer Strap always attached to the Vision Pro, however, you\u2019ll\nprobably want to get this version of the SoloTop instead.\n\nAdditionally, I have some recommendations on the Solo Knit Band sizes. Based\non my own experience and from what I\u2019ve read in different threads on Reddit,\nyou\u2019ll likely want to get a second Solo Knit Band for the top of your head\nthat is one size smaller than the primary one in the back. I, for instance,\nwear an M-size Solo Knit Band in the back of my head, but I had to get an\nS-size one for the top because the larger size was too loose. There\u2019s really\nno good way to test this in Apple\u2019s retail stores, so perhaps you could get\ntwo different sizes and return the one you don\u2019t need.\n\nThe \u2018Dual Knit\u2019 setup has been a game-changer for my usage of the Vision Pro\nso far, but it\u2019s only one part of the story.\n\n## Air Cover and My \u2018Dual Knit Open\u2019 Vision Pro Setup\n\nWhen I first read that some people were using the Vision Pro without a light\nseal between the headset\u2019s lenses and their eyes, I thought it sounded too\nridiculous to be true. Then I tried it myself, and I became a believer. I\u2019ve\nbeen using my Vision Pro without a light seal for the past three weeks, and,\nfor most scenarios in my daily life, I can\u2019t imagine going back to wearing the\nlight seal at all.\n\nBefore I get into the details of what I\u2019ve done here, it is necessary to\ncontextualize how I use the Vision Pro and why eschewing the light seal is\nokay for me.\n\nIn the almost two months I\u2019ve had the Vision Pro, I\u2019ve realized that I tend to\nuse it more as an AR/MR device than a VR one, which means that I prefer to be\nin passthrough mode the majority of the time and very, very rarely immerse\nmyself in VR environments that occlude my surroundings.\n\nThere are a few reasons behind this preference. The first one is that I find\nVR isolating. It\u2019s hard enough to be \u201caccepted\u201d by other people in my house\nwhen I\u2019m wearing the Vision Pro (even if they know I can see them); blocking\nout real life to be immersed in an environment feels like a step too far,\nsocially speaking, when I\u2019m not home alone. However, even when I am by myself,\nI still have two dogs I want to keep an eye on and, you know, simply see to\nenjoy their company when I\u2019m working. I\u2019m sorry, Apple, but Zelda and Ginger\nresting next to me or wanting head scratches will always be superior to\nHaleakal\u0101 and Yosemite.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else, too. I like the feeling of turning my house into a\nfuturistic workspace with windows floating all over the place. It looks cool\n(which makes me feel good about using the Vision Pro), keeps me more aware of\nmy surroundings, and allows me to move around the house while wearing the\nVision Pro and looking at apps. For instance, I\u2019ve cooked dinner a bunch of\ntimes while wearing the Vision Pro and setting up floating timers on my\nkitchen stove, and it\u2019s been a transformative experience in its \u201csimplicity\u201d.\nI love the feeling of turning my physical space into a computer monitor\nwrapped around me.\n\nI just love working like this so much.\n\nOnce I realized that, on a daily basis, I like to be in passthrough mode and\nseldom take advantage of complete immersion, an idea clicked in my brain: if I\ndon\u2019t want to be immersed, do I even need to block out external light? And\nthat\u2019s when I understood that the folks on Reddit I once ridiculed were right\nall along.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was able to order the Air Cover, a 3D-printed accessory by\nInfinity One that lets you use the Vision Pro without a light seal. Pardon the\npun, but thanks to the Air Cover I\u2019ve seen the light \u2013 literally.\n\nThe Air Cover.\n\nI wish it came in a different color.\n\nThe idea is pretty simple: if you remove the light seal from a Vision Pro,\nyour eyes are going to get closer to the lenses, which may generate a larger\nfield of view; you also get better air flow while wearing the headset (there\u2019s\nno seal blocking out air anymore) as well as real peripheral vision. Now, we\nall have different physiognomies, and therefore, your mileage may vary. But in\nmy experience, all these promises have turned out to be true thanks to the Air\nCover, which is also incredibly comfortable to wear since it transfers weight\nfrom my face to the upper part of my forehead. When combined with my Dual Knit\nsetup, I don\u2019t feel the weight of the Vision Pro on my face anymore.\n\nThe folks at Infinity One have accounted for potential issues with using a\nVision Pro without a light seal and made a series of smart design decisions.\nThe main one: I can use the Air Cover with my ZEISS prescription lenses just\nfine since there is a cushion (made of foam and faux leather; it\u2019s smooth and\ncomfortable) that sits on my forehead and creates a minimal distance between\nmy eyes and the lenses. In simple terms, when I bat my eyelashes, they don\u2019t\nbrush against the ZEISS lenses. I still occasionally get the \u201ctoo close to\ndisplay\u201d alert in visionOS, but I can either ignore it and nothing happens^3,\nor I can turn the dial for the Solo Knit Band in the back to make it a bit\nlooser, and the alert will go away on its own.\n\nAs you can see from the photos below, the Air Cover was designed to attach to\nboth the Audio Straps and the headset itself, with the cushion protruding with\na curved design that ensures it can rest on your forehead. My only criticism\n(besides the fact that Infinity One is often out of stock of Air Cover units)\nis that I wish the accessory came in more colors and a nicer material than the\n3D-printed resin it\u2019s currently made of.\n\nMy \u2018Dual Knit Open\u2019 setup. The field of view is larger, and I get real\nperipheral vision.\n\nIt\u2019s very, very comfortable.\n\nComfort aside, it\u2019s the experience of using visionOS without a light seal that\nhas deeply changed my relationship with the Vision Pro.\n\nThe best way I can describe it is that it feels like going from wearing a\nheadset to wearing heavy glasses with very thick frames (and I say this as\nsomeone who wears eyeglasses every day). I still get the \u201ctunnel vision\u201d\neffect that\u2019s typical of the Vision Pro, but it\u2019s less pronounced compared to\nwhen I\u2019m using the light seal, and as a result, my field of view is also\nlarger since my eyes are closer to the displays. This is something I\u2019ve\nespecially noticed on the horizontal axis, which is also backed by\nmeasurements taken by Infinity One using the ALVR app for visionOS. According\nto their study, the Air Cover netted a 13% improvement in horizontal FOV and\n7% in vertical FOV, which lines up with my experience. It\u2019s not dramatically\nlarger, but it is something I notice.\n\n> Using visionOS without a light seal has deeply changed my relationship with\n> the Vision Pro.\n\nEven if we disregard the FOV argument, the increased air flow and natural\nperipheral vision have been fantastic improvements over the vanilla Vision Pro\nexperience.\n\nWithout a light seal, there\u2019s more air flowing between my face and the\nheadset, and that feels great. I can wear the Vision Pro for hours without\nsweating in it, and everything feels cooler. I also don\u2019t get the skin marks\nfrom the light seal that made me look like a raccoon before, so that\u2019s also\nnice. But most importantly, my eyes can see more on the periphery on all\nsides, which is great for staying more aware of my surroundings, checking my\nwatch or phone, and generally using my hands in the real world despite the\nheadset on my face.\n\nWithout a light seal, at least people can see my eyes instead of EyeSight\u2019s\ncreepy rendition.\n\nThe combination of all these factors has resulted in me using the Vision Pro\nmore because it fits better into my everyday life. Since I tend to favor\naugmented and mixed reality over virtual reality, and given how I want to turn\nthe Vision Pro into my main computer (effectively replacing the iPad in my\nlife), being able to work in it for prolonged sessions with maximum comfort\nand increased awareness of my surroundings has been, quite frankly,\nastounding.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine going back to the light seal for general computing tasks on\nthe Vision Pro.\n\nWith a few accessories, I feel like I\u2019ve been able to turn the Vision Pro into\nsomething that it couldn\u2019t be when I first got it. It hasn\u2019t even been two\nmonths since the device launched, and I\u2019ve already seen some wild ideas from\nthe modding community and accessory makers. Being along for this ride,\nespecially once the Vision Pro launches in more countries, is going to be fun.\n\n  1. In their original marketing video, Apple showed a still-unreleased Solo Knit Band with an additional strap at the top to relieve pressure from your face. Not exactly what I wanted, but close enough. \u21a9\ufe0e\n  2. I need to acknowledge and thank John for putting up with me and shipping all this stuff from the United States. \u21a9\ufe0e\n  3.
