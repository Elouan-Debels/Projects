Our open source project is already at 12,181 stars on GitHub and\n209,339 weekly downloads on npm.\n\nResend is powering millions of emails sent every month with a small team of\nsix people, and this is only the beginning.\n\nHere's a quick recap of our journey so far and what's next.\n\n## How we got here\n\nEvery idea has a story, and ours started in August 2022.\n\n### Aug 2022: Reimagining email\n\nBu and I were using multiple tools for email at both our full-time jobs and\nside projects, but they all felt outdated, slow, and built for marketers, not\ndevelopers.\n\nWe also had to deal with emails landing in the spam folder and felt the pain\nof building a beautiful email template that would work the same in every email\nclient.\n\nSo, we started playing with the idea of building the \u201cStripe of Email\u201d.\n\n### Sep 2022: First customer\n\nOnce we had a working MVP, we shared it with a friend who was working at\nanother startup. He liked it and started using it in production. We sent him a\n$10 payment link as a way to validate if the product was really good or not.\n\nTo our surprise, he paid (!), which gave us the confidence to apply to Y\nCombinator.\n\n### Dec 2022: Open source launch\n\nWe launched react.email because we were frustrated by how difficult it was to\nbuild modern email templates that worked well across all email clients.\n\nThis project caught the attention of a lot of people, and it became clear that\nthis was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n### Jan 2023: Hello world\n\nResend was incorporated in January 2023, and we shared the news online.\n\nThe response was overwhelmingly positive, and the announcement tweet alone had\nmore than 1M views.\n\nThis was also the month Jonni joined our founding team as Operations Manager.\n\n### Apr 2023: $3m seed round\n\nOnce we finished Y Combinator, we raised a $3m seed round (see full list of\ninvestors).\n\nWe also had our first team gathering in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\n### Jun 2023: Public launch\n\nAfter operating behind a waitlist, we finally opened the product to everyone.\n\n### Dec 2023: 1,000 paying customers\n\nWe celebrated 1,000 paying customers as we closed the first year of Resend as\na company.\n\n### Jan 2024: Looking \u201cForward\u201d\n\nWe organized our second launch week, and this time, we called it Resend\nForward.\n\nThis marked the launch of marketing emails and turned Resend into a multi-\nproduct company.\n\n### Apr 2024: First 100,000 users\n\nAfter ten months since launching Resend publicly, we reached 100,000 users.\n\n## Where are we going\n\nIf we do our job correctly, Resend will become one of the best ways for humans\nto communicate.\n\n### Deeper into the tech stack.\n\nWhen looking at the feature requests that our users bring up, there are still\na lot of gaps that our product doesn't fill.\n\nWe want Resend to be the de facto email solution for developers, and that\nmeans we need to keep improving our API, libraries, and components.\n\nUsers should be able not only to send emails but also to receive them, and\nwe're working on a feature that will allow them to do just that.\n\n### Stellar deliverability.\n\nDeliverability is a team sport. There's only so much you can do as an email\nprovider and services like Resend are only as good as their senders.\n\nOur plan is to embed some of the lessons learned about deliverability into the\nproduct and create a series of educational content that will help users\nimprove the quality of their email lists and the content they send.\n\n### Support as a feature.\n\nMany companies see their support team as a cost center. For them it's just a\ngroup of people that handles issues and complaints, or as an expensive add-on\nto drive revenue.\n\nWe feel the opposite. We know that great support is a core part of what makes\nResend valuable. We know that phenomenal support not only helps us retain\ncustomers, but also helps us grow with word of mouth.\n\nThat's why we will continue to push the limits by decreasing tickets with\nstellar docs and AI chat trained with our data, as well as improve\nresponse/resolutions times with internal tooling and automations.\n\n### It's not just about email.\n\nResend is not an email company, it's a communications company.\n\nWhen we were brainstorming the name of the company, we wanted to make sure\nthat it was broad enough to encompass more than just email.\n\nWe're starting with email as a niche to focus on, but the ultimate goal is to\nexpand into other communication channels, such as SMS, Whatsapp, push\nnotification, and more.\n\nThis is a multi-year journey, but we're excited about the possibilities.\n\nI'm looking forward to sharing every step of the way with you all.\n\nP.S: We\u2019re hiring.\n\n2261 Market Street #5039 San Francisco, CA 94114\n\nDocumentation\n\n  * Getting Started\n\n  * API Reference\n\n  * Integrations\n\n  * Examples\n\n  * SDKs\n\nResources\n\n  * Changelog\n\n  * Pricing\n\n  * Security\n\n  * SOC 2\n\n  * Status\n\n  * Brand\n\nCompany\n\n  * About\n\n  * Blog\n\n  * Careers\n\n  * Contact\n\n  * Customers\n\n  * Philosophy\n\nLegal\n\n  * Acceptable Use\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n  * Terms of Service\n\n", "frontpage": false}
