Solstock\n\nEmail\n\nX (Twitter)\n\nFacebook19\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMessenger\n\nPrint\n\nOur world is awash with data. A 2019 article published by the World Economic\nForum estimated that, by 2025, about\n\n> 463 exabytes of data will be created each day globally \u2013 that\u2019s the\n> equivalent of 212,765,957 DVDs per day.\n\nBut data is only useful if it can be collected, analysed and explained by\nexperts. That\u2019s where statisticians come in. People like us are trained to\nmake sense of data. Our analyses can then guide organisations and governments\nin making sensible policy decisions.\n\nBoth \u201cdata scientist\u201d and \u201cstatistics lecturer\u201d feature on the South African\ngovernment\u2019s critical skills list. Due to the large increase in data\navailable, skilled analysts are needed more than ever before. And so are the\nacademic statisticians needed to train those analysts. Industry\u2019s huge need\ndraws graduates, but this limits academia\u2019s capacity.\n\nWe are a group of academic statisticians from South African universities who\nhave compiled a discussion paper to address these issues. We have identified\nthe factors contributing to the capacity crisis in academic statistics,\nincluding a lack of collaboration between academics in different academic\nstatistical fields. We\u2019ve also proposed a way to improve both the quality and\nquantity of, primarily, doctoral candidates in the various statistical fields.\n\n## What\u2019s in a name?\n\nThere are many \u201cstatistical\u201d fields in academia. These include operations\nresearch, data science, business mathematics, econometrics and biostatistics.\nOver the years, a divide has emerged between those who research and lecture in\napplied statistics and their counterparts in mathematical or theoretical\nstatistics.\n\nStatistics departments are positioned within different faculties across\nvarious South African universities, for example within commerce, natural\nscience, or engineering. Sometimes they are stand-alone entities outside these\nfaculties, such as in biostatistics within health sciences or psychometrics\nwithin social sciences. Other institutions merge statistics departments with\nothers like operations research, data science, mathematics or acturial\nscience.\n\nNow, as one discussant in our paper pointed out, it is time for statisticians\nto put aside their disciplinary differences. Instead they must identify\ncommonalities in their fields. In this way academic statisticians can come\ntogether to build a network of expertise that can support the development of\nyoung academics across these imagined divisions.\n\nThis view was echoed by the wide range of statisticians we consulted who work\noutside academia in various industries. One said that naming conventions of\ndegrees might narrow the pool of those in industry who could provide purpose,\nguidance and mentoring for PhD candidates in statistics. A doctoral candidate\nfocused on econometrics may not realise that a biostatistician is well\nequipped to support and mentor them.\n\n## Assessment\n\nWe also identified the need to standardise assessment across statistics PhDs\nin South Africa. Currently every university sets its own criteria. There may\nbe concerns that standardising assessment for what is essentially creative\noutput (novel, innovative ideas) may be too prescriptive. However, we believe\nthat a semi-flexible assessment rubric is vital. This will help to develop\nhigh-quality doctoral graduates. It will also guide early-career supervisors\nto develop the correct goals for their students.\n\nAn assessment rubric is an important tool for formative assessment. It allows\nstudents to monitor what will be expected of them. It also ensures consistency\nand fairness in how statistics research is assessed.\n\nA standardised, transparent rubric will also allow institutions across South\nAfrica to maintain similar standards for their statistics PhD candidates.\nThose graduates can then move easily across institutions and industries across\nthe country.\n\n## Supervisor-student relationship\n\nAnother gap exists in how both PhD candidates and their supervisors are\nsupported and mentored.\n\nThe relationship a PhD candidate has with their supervisor is enormously\nimportant, as research from across disciplines has shown. Without sufficient\nmentoring, early-career supervisors may not know how to nurture a healthy\nsupervisor-student relationship. They may not be aware of all of the\nintricacies inherent in this relationship, let alone the skills that they\nshould be imparting to their students.\n\nCollaboration is extremely important to help early-career academics \u2013 and\nparticularly those supervising postgraduates. Many experienced supervisors in\nSouth Africa are retired or nearing retirement. Networks must be created so\nthat newer supervisors can support each other and learn from more experienced\nsupervisors while they are still willing and able to assist. This is also an\nexcellent way for supervisors to identify external examiners for their own\nstudents\u2019 work and for developing research networks in their fields of\nspeciality.\n\nAnother issue that we identified is that, while there are funding\nopportunities available, doctoral candidates and their early-career\nsupervisors may not have the expertise to tap into the available resources.\nThis again underscores the value of networking and collaboration.\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that we have identified critical topics, we have set up a guiding rubric\nfor early-career supervisors in statistics, in consultation with senior\nsupervisors, young academics and industry statisticians. To our knowledge, it\nis the first of its kind in the field of academic statistics.\n\nThe rubric is not designed to be prescriptive. Instead it will be a guide that\nincludes criteria for every area identified as being important to the\ndevelopment of a new researcher. Some new supervisors may use the entire\nguiding rubric to assist in each important area. Other, more experienced\nsupervisors might choose to use only the assessment section.\n\n  * Mathematics\n  * Academics\n  * Statistics\n  * Econometrics\n  * University assessment\n  * South African universities\n  * Biostatistics\n  * Data science\n  * Data analysis\n  * Postgraduate supervision\n  * PhD candidates\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Research Fellow \u2013 Beyond The Resource Curse\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\n  * ##### Director, Defence and Security\n\n  * ##### Opportunities with the new CIEHF\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
