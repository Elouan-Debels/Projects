Wilbert D. Pearson Jr. took off on a flight that\nrequired him to follow an extraordinarily exacting mission profile.\n\nPearson, an Air Force test pilot, flew his F-15A from Edwards AFB, Calif., to\na point some 200 miles west of Vandenberg AFB, Calif. Then, while traveling at\nMach 1.2, he pitched the fighter upward into a precise 65-degree climb, in the\nprocess pulling 3.8Gs. Pearson\u2019s fighter rose rapidly.\n\nThen, at an altitude of exactly 38,100 feet, the F-15 automatically launched\nan experimental two-stage missile called the ASM-135. The missile streaked\nupward, rocketing through the troposphere and stratosphere. It reached space\nat some 335,000 feet\u2014more than 62 miles above Earth\u2019s surface\u2014and kept going.\n\nAn F-15A launches an ASM-135 ASAT missile on Sept. 13, 1985.

Rather, this mission called for it to destroy a satellite by means\nof violent collision.\n\nThe ASM-135 did just that, slamming into an obsolete military observation\nsatellite some 345 miles (1.8 million feet) above the Pacific Ocean, turning\nit into a cloud of metal shards and dust.\n\nPearson, in that moment, became the first pilot ever to shoot down a space\ntarget. Never again has the Air Force fired a missile at a satellite.\n\nYears earlier, the Washington Post\u2019s defense correspondent had helped put the\nASM-135 into the public consciousness. George C. Wilson, in several 1977\narticles, offered the first descriptions of the system and gave it a\ndistinctive moniker\u2014the flying tomato can.\n\nThe homing vehicle was a short cylinder that bore more than a faint\nresemblance to, yes, a tomato can. Fifty-six full-charge and eight half-charge\nsolid rocket motors were arranged around its circumference, for steering.\nTarget acquisition was the job of an infrared seeker in the center.\n\nTo work properly, the infrared seeker had to be cooled considerably before\ndeployment. For this, it sat in liquid helium chilled to about -450 degrees\nFahrenheit, or near absolute zero.\n\nThe ASAT test program required a large helium dewar, or flask, that was \u201cabout\nthe size of the robot on the old \u2018Lost in Space\u2019 TV show,\u201d according to\nGregory Karambelas, who as a young Air Force officer worked on the ASAT\nprogram for four years. Test program F-15s were originally two-seat Eagles\nwith their backseats replaced with helium dewars, Karambelas wrote.\n\nThe homing vehicle could only point itself in the direction of a target. It\nhad no real forward thrust capability of its own. Thus the release point of\nthe F-15 pilot and the performance of the booster stages were crucial to\nsuccess.\n\nThe delivery aircraft had to fly to an area below the path of an oncoming\ntarget satellite. Then, after having pulled itself into a steep climb, the\nfighter had to release its weapon inside a very small launch window.\n\n\u201cIf all went well, the homing vehicle would vector itself directly into the\ntarget\u2019s path and destroy it by smashing directly into it,\u201d said Air Force\nFlight Test Center historian Raymond L. Puffer. \u201cAt the extremely high closing\nspeeds of the two objects, no explosives would be necessary.\u201d\n\nThe first captive-carry flight of the new ASAT weapon occurred on Dec. 21,\n1982. Two free-flight tests took place in 1984. The first of these was on Jan.\n21 and was a success, though it did not include a miniature homing vehicle.\nThe second test, on Nov. 2, used a star as a target for the homing vehicle\u2019s\nsensor, and was judged by the Air Force to be only a partial success.\n\nSome months later, officials concluded that they were ready to carry out a\ntest against a real target in space. President Reagan gave his approval on\nAug. 20, 1985. Originally, the shot was scheduled for Sept. 4, but\nCongressional restrictions at the time required that lawmakers be notified 15\ndays in advance. The flight was delayed nine days.\n\nThe \u201cflying tomato can\u201d on display at the National Air and Space Museum Steven\nF. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. (Staff photo by Adam J. Hebert)  \n---  \n  \nThe target was a spacecraft known as Solwind P78-1, a gamma ray spectroscopy\nsatellite launched in 1979. Its purpose had been study of the solar wind,\namong other things.\n\nAt 1:42 p.m. local Pacific time, on Sept. 13, 1985, the ASM-135 fired by\nPearson hit P78-1 dead on. Pentagon officials were jubilant. Secretary of\nDefense Caspar W. Weinberger called the test \u201ca great step forward.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, P78-1 was not an entirely burnt-out case. Naval Research\nLaboratory physicists were still using its data at the time. In fact, the NRL\nphysicists who showed up at work on Sept. 14 were surprised to learn that they\nwould no longer receive data from P78-1, according to a Los Angeles Times\narticle at the time. The spacecraft\u2019s major work had been completed, but \u201cthe\nsatellite was doing several experiments,\u201d observed a Navy spokesman, Capt.\nBrent Baker.\n\nFollowing Pearson\u2019s flight, Congress banned further anti-satellite shots\nagainst orbiting targets. Lawmakers disagreed with the Reagan Administration\nover the need for an ASAT weapon and worried it might stimulate a Soviet\nprogram or throw up additional roadblocks to strategic arms control.\n\nThe politics of arms control, plus cost overruns and technical glitches,\neventually killed the program. The Pentagon canceled the ASM-135 in 1988. Yet\nthe ASAT missile was \u201ca major technical achievement,\u201d according to AFFTC\nhistorian James O. Young.\n\nYoung, in a history of the center published in 2007, wrote that Pearson\u2019s\ndirect hit on the satellite was \u201ca stunning event,\u201d one that \u201creportedly\nreverberated through the halls of the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nThe issue of space security is now receiving renewed attention, due in part to\nChina\u2019s test of an ASAT system in January 2007 and the US Navy\u2019s February 2008\ndestruction of an ailing US spy satellite with a ship-fired missile.\n\nVulnerability in Space\n\nFrom the dawn of the space age, both the Soviet Union and the United States\nworked diligently to develop capabilities to attack their adversary\u2019s orbiting\nassets.\n\nFor their part, the Soviets were driven by what they perceived as the threat\nof US reconnaissance satellites. The Americans started emphasizing these spies\nin the sky in the early 1960s, after it became clear that the USSR would be\nable to shoot down overflying U-2s.\n\nSoviet officials were so irritated by the recon satellites that they attempted\nto get the UN to condemn them as incompatible with mankind\u2019s peaceful\nobjectives for outer space. Soviet scientists then also set to work on methods\nof satellite destruction.\n\nThe USSR\u2019s main system was the Co-Orbital ASAT, a sort of giant hand grenade\nfor space.\n\nLaunched via conventional missile, the 1.5-ton Co-Orbital interceptor lurked\nin orbit close to its target. Guided by onboard radar, this killer satellite\nwould edge closer and closer to its intended target and then detonate when the\ntarget was within about half a mile.\n\nIn its initial test phase, which ran from 1963 to 1972, this system\nintercepted seven targets during 20 attempts, and detonated five times.\n\nThe US had come to rely on spy satellite intelligence and thus was alarmed by\nthe Co-Orbital ASAT. Officials also worried the Soviets would launch orbiting\nnuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cThis created a sense of paranoia about our vulnerability in space,\u201d said\nretired USAF Gen. Thomas S. Moorman Jr., former vice chief of staff and\ncommander of Air Force Space Command, at a 1995 symposium on the development\nof space systems and their military applications.\n\nThe US had begun working on its own ASAT designs in the late 1950s. The first\nwas Bold Orion, a two-stage rocket fired from a B-47 bomber. This came within\nfour miles of its intended target, which was within expectations, but\neventually the Air Force lost interest in the program.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the US fielded two ground-based ASAT systems.\n\nThe Army\u2019s Program 505 used Nike Zeus missiles originally developed as anti-\nballistic missile weapons.\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s Program 437 used Thor missiles as its base.\n\nNeither system depended on pinpoint accuracy\u2014they employed the destructive\npower of nuclear warheads.\n\nProgram 505, based on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific, went operational on Aug.\n1, 1963. It stood on alert for a year\u2014then was abandoned by Defense Secretary\nRobert S. McNamara in favor of the Air Force\u2019s effort.\n\nProgram 437 was based on Johnston Island in the Pacific. Three of four test\nflights (without live warheads) were successful, and the system was declared\nfully operational on June 1, 1964.\n\nBut after the system was up and running, US scientists began to learn more\nabout the possible deleterious effects of nuclear explosions in space. Tests\ndemonstrated that the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear explosion traveled\na considerable distance. Any attempt to destroy an orbiting Soviet target thus\nrisked unintended destruction of US satellites as well.\n\nIn addition, the threat of USSR nuclear weapons in orbit had not materialized.\nIn late 1970, Project 437 was downgraded from alert status to 30-day notice.\nIn April 1975, the launch facilities on Johnston Island were deactivated.\nProject 437 was abandoned.\n\n\u201cI terminated that project during my tenure as Secretary of the Air Force\nbecause I did not see a good match between the likelihood of its eventual use\nand the cost of maintaining it,\u201d said John L. McLucas, who led the service\nfrom May 1973 to November 1975, at the 1995 Air Force Historical Foundation\nsymposium.\n\nThe next move was by President Ford. Concerned about the increasing US\nreliance on space systems for national security, Ford in 1976 issued National\nSecurity Decision Memorandum 333, which called for development of ASATs\n\u201ccommensurate with planned use in crisis and conflict.\u201d\n\nThe era of US kinetic-kill anti-satellite systems was born.\n\nProject Spike was the first effort. It involved a two-stage missile launched\nfrom an F-106. In space, the missile would release a terminal homing vehicle,\nwhich would be guided by solid rocket motors to smash a target.\n\nProject Spike did not progress to development. But in 1978, its concept, and\nsome of its technology, was adopted by a new program initially designated the\nPrototype Miniature Air-Launched System (PMALS).\n\nPMALS was run out of the Air Force Systems Command\u2019s Space Division. Its\nmission was to build a weapon able to destroy satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\nIn 1979, work began on a new Air-Launched Miniature Vehicle ASAT. It also used\na two-stage, high-speed missile, launched from a fighter. However, the chosen\nairframe was the then-new F-15 instead of the aging F-106.\n\nThe ASAT\u2019s first stage was a modified Boeing anti-radiation missile. Its\nsecond stage was an LTV Aerospace Altair 3. The third stage, the miniature\nhoming vehicle itself, was also an LTV product, derived from an older effort\nfunded by the US Army and tested against tanks.\n\nFrom the inception of the program, the ASM-135 ASAT had been enmeshed in a\nWashington policy debate over whether the US needed such a system\u2014and whether\nan arms deal with the Soviets that would limit ASAT weaponry was in the\nnational interest.\n\nSome critics felt that a US ASAT could destabilize the delicate balance of\nsuperpower nuclear deterrence. A Soviet leadership blinded by loss of its\nintelligence satellites might fear the worst and lash out with a nuclear\nstrike, went this theory.\n\nOthers felt that the US, with its more sophisticated satellite systems, could\npotentially reap a disproportionate gain from an ASAT arms control pact.\n\nRetired Maj.

In December 1985, shortly after the system\u2019s\nsuccessful test and destruction of the satellite, lawmakers banned further\ntests on targets in space.\n\nContinued ASAT experiments could only lead to a superpower arms race in yet\nanother category of strategic weaponry, supporters of the ban said at the\ntime.\n\nHowever, the ASM-135 was not exactly a silver tomato can. Its flight ceiling\nwas about 350 miles, meaning it could attack only satellites in low Earth\norbit. Plus, the Soviets would be able to institute countermeasures against\nthe weapon, though such defensive moves would be of only \u201climited\u201d utility,\naccording to a declassified CIA report on the subject.\n\nManeuvering would be the only Soviet method of direct defense against the Air-\nLaunched Miniature Vehicle, according to the 1983 CIA report. An air strike\nagainst F-15 launch aircraft, or their base, was also a \u201ctheoretical option.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe the Soviets know enough about the ASAT system to develop\ncountermeasures designed to increase the survivability of their satellites,\u201d\nconcluded the CIA report.\n\nInitially, the Air Force had planned a force of 100 Air-Launched Miniature\nVehicle interceptors. They would be available to two squadrons of specially\nmodified F-15s, split between the East and West Coast. But by 1986, the\nprogram was far over budget. Estimated completion costs had risen from $500\nmillion to more than $5 billion.\n\nThe Air Force conducted two more live-fire tests of the ASAT, but, in\ndeference to the limits imposed by Congress, both were aimed at stars, rather\nthan satellites.\n\nIn 1987, the program was scaled back. The next year, it was canceled \u201cdue to\ntechnical problems with the homing guidance system and testing delays, both of\nwhich had added to the significant cost growth,\u201d stated an Air Force-sponsored\nassessment.\n\nPearson, the Air Force\u2019s only pilot with a space \u201ckill\u201d rose to the rank of\nmajor general before retiring as commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center\nin 2005.\n\nIn September 2007, some airmen put together a tribute to Pearson\u2019s historic\nflight. SSgt. Aaron Hartley, a crew chief at Homestead ARB, Fla., observed\nthat an F-15 then assigned to the 125th Fighter Wing at Homestead was in fact\nthe aircraft used in the satellite shootdown. Hartley helped arrange a flight\nto honor the achievement.\n\nThe pilot of the remembrance flight was Pearson\u2019s son, Capt. Todd Pearson, an\nactive duty F-15 pilot based at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember today, but for years in the mid-\u201980s, the flying tomato\ncan\u2019s fate was a matter of great controversy in Washington. In the end, the\nprogram simply faded away, leaving as its legacy one successful shot and a\ngreat nickname.\n\nPeter Grier, a Washington editor for the Christian Science Monitor, is a\nlongtime defense correspondent and a contributing editor to Air Force\nMagazine.
