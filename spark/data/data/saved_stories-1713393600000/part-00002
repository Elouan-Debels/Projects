Below is the complete email we got from Apple\nregarding this ban. We got that mail twice, once on Wed, 27 Mar 2024 15:46:18\n+0100 and a second time on Thu, 28 Mar 2024 17:01:19 +0100. The macOS version\nof Monal is still available in the appstore and with homebrew, though.\n\nHere is the full mail, a translation of the CAC articles can be found over\nhere for reference.\n\nHello,\n\nWe are writing to notify you that your application, per demand from the CAC\n(Cyberspace Administration of China), will be removed from the China App Store\nbecause it includes content that is illegal in China, which is not in\ncompliance with the App Review Guidelines:\n\n  5. Legal Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you\u2019re not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws, not just the guidelines below. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected.\n\nAccording to the CAC, your app violates Articles 3 of the Provisions on the\nSecurity Assessment of Internet-based Information Services with Attribute of\nPublic Opinions or Capable of Social Mobilization\n(\u5177\u6709\u8206\u8bba\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u793e\u4f1a\u52a8\u5458\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4fe1\u606f\u670d\u52a1\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5b9a).\n\nIf you need additional information regarding this removal or the laws and\nrequirements in China, we encourage you to reach out directly to the CAC\n(Cyberspace Administration of China).\n\nWhile your app has been removed from the China App Store, it is still\navailable in the App Stores for the other territories you selected in App\nStore Connect. The TestFlight version of this app will also be unavailable for\nexternal and internal testing in China and all public TestFlight links will no\nlonger be functional.\n\nBest regards,\n\nApp Review\n\n\u00a9 2024 Monal Powered by Hugo & PaperMod\n\n", "frontpage": false}
