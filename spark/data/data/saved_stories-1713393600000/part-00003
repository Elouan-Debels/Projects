With autocomplete and native-feeling keyboard navigation,\nit's useful for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and so on. Tom\nSelect was forked from selectize.js with four main objectives: modernizing the\ncode base, decoupling from jQuery, expanding functionality, and addressing\nissue backlogs.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Smart Option Searching / Ranking Options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly (using sifter). Want to search an item's title and description? No problem.\n  * Caret between items Order matters sometimes. With the Caret Position Plugin, you can use the \u2190 and \u2192 arrow keys to move between selected items\n  * Select & delete multiple items at once Hold down command on Mac or ctrl on Windows to select more than one item to delete.\n  * D\u00ed\u00e5crit\u00ee\u00e7s supported Great for international environments.\n  * Item creation Allow users to create items on the fly (async saving is supported; the control locks until the callback is fired).\n  * Remote data loading For when you have thousands of options and want them provided by the server as the user types.\n  * Extensible Plugin API for developing custom features (uses microplugin).\n  * Accessible, Touch Support, Clean API ...\n\n## Usage\n\n    \n    \n    <input id=\"tom-select-it\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/tom-select.default.css\"> <script src=\"/js/tom-select.complete.js\"></script> <script> var settings = {}; new TomSelect('#tom-select-it',settings); </script>\n\nAvailable configuration settings are documented here\n\n## Installation\n\nAll pre-built files needed to use Tom Select can be found in the \"dist\" folder\nfrom each of these sources:\n\nnpm\n\n    \n    \n    npm i tom-select\n\nAdditional CLI usage\n\njsDelivr\n\nThe fastest way to add Tom Select into your project is to just include the js\nand css from jsDelivr.\n\n    \n    \n    <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tom-select@2.3.1/dist/css/tom-select.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tom-select@2.3.1/dist/js/tom-select.complete.min.js\"></script>\n\nGitHub\n\nClone the full repo from GitHub to create custom builds.
