It talks about the effectiveness of K-12 schooling and education from\naround the world. From Europe, to Asia, to America.\n\nIt talks about how these schooling systems differ in various countries. For\ninstance, in South Korea, the culture tends to be very strict. There is a high\nrate of stress and pressure on the kids to do well. In many of the standarized\ntests, the students perform well, but they also work gruelingly long hours\nincluding parental mandated afterschool studies. Students can often times\nsuffer from lots of health problems\n\nIn another culture such as America, the K-12 education system widely varies\ndepending on the rating of the school (rated from F to A+). It closely has\nsome parallels to the socioeconomic status of the area, better schools tend to\nbe in more affluent areas as there is more money and more funding. Private\nschools are the exception here, whether this is a religious school, charter\nschool, STEM school, etc\n\nGermanic schooling tends to fair very well here too, as there is a sense of\nperfection and rules in it's culture. The government provides a lot of\nresources for those pursuing higher education\n\nHowever, there is though one culture that is heavily highlighted in the book\nthough as one of the \"best\" K-12 educational systems in the world, and that is\nof Finland.\n\nFinland, Encyclopedia Brittanica\n\nWhen we look at the K-12 educational system there, it's first and foremost\nimportant to understand the culture. The culture is a very peaceful, neutral\ncountry surrounded by mountains. People there tend to their own business,\nthere is not much small talk. There is also next to no socialeconomic conflict\nor issues either\n\nBecause of a lack of notable issues, a bigger emphasis can be made elsewhere,\nsuch as in the education system. Being a teacher is a desired profession in\nFinland. The pay is considerably higher than those in the states, and teachers\nare treated well\n\nTeachers in Finland do things a bit differently. They are given a large amount\nof freedom to educate as they see fit, to the individual needs of a student.\nRegulations are lead by educators, and not bureacrats\n\nThere is also less pressure on the teacher, less standarized testing, and\nthings are a more relaxed atmosphere overall.\n\nA student is given the oppurtunity to explore their own individuality. And the\nteacher fine tunes their curriculum to the student's interest\n\nIn many ways, the student develops a sense of the world on their own. They\nlearn without boundaries\n\nWhereas in other schools such as those in Asian culture, military like\ndiscipline tends to be the norm. Math must be perfected, a student must take\non many hobbies like playing the Piano, etc. Education is very much forced,\nwith boundaries and stipulations of becoming a doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc\n\nDALLE - a kid buried in schoolbooks to study, digital art\n\nWhen someone is given the oppurtunity to safely learn on their own, and the\noppurtunity to fail where failure comes at almost no time or monetary cost,\nthey are learning without boundaries.\n\nNo boundaries in the sense where the sky is the limit. You can learn anything\nyou want. Anything you find interesting. The reward feedback loop, is your own\nlearning. You develop a deep sense of trust of yourself, your own knowledge,\nbecause well you chose to learn it yourself. The teacher simply provided a\nsense of guidance, an evolving framework, to your designated path of your\nchoosing.\n\nThis evolves to some level of creative original thinking. There is not a\nconformist level buy in to mainstream culture necessarily.\n\nDigressing away from the book - the teacher doesn't necessarily have to be a\nperson either. It could simply just be a book you picked up at the local\nlibrary. It could be a youtuber who you aspired to and learned from. It could\nbe an MMO video game like runescape where you experimented and ran your own\nvirtual business online. It could be a number of different things\n\nThose that don't learn without boundaries, they usually develop a completely\nskillset. For someone that did not grow up with money, working ends meet -\nthis means putting food on the table. Survival by money. Have the burden of\nalways thinking short term puts a stoppage on the luxury of learning. Dealing\nwith foodstamps, paycheck to paycheck, etc.\n\nDALLE: a kid selling lemonade on the streets, digital art\n\nIf you didn't learn without boundaries, what usually happens is you resort to\ncopying others who did. But you will lack the original foundation that they\nhave built, and what seems to work for them may not work for you\n\nIt's always important to focus on the principle first. First, deal with your\nboundaries. Then find a way to have the luxury of time without pressure, to\nlearn without boundaries. It's easier said then done. This usually means\nmaking more money, getting your foot in the door to a higher paying job as\nsoon as possible\n\nThese boundaries may not always be necessitated by time or money, but also by\nsocial conditioning. You may have grown up being told certain ways of thinking\nare wrong, or rather encouraged to think a different way (such as with\nreligion). Or being told things are not possible, or having an agenda forced\ndown on you all the time. These take much longer to heal, to grow out of as\nthings need to be unlearnt - if you choose to go down the path of learning\nwithout boundaries\n\nWhen you do learn without boundaries, you can be a creative original thinker -\nand break out of molds you don't want to be in, and embrace new ventures you\ndidn't know existed\n\n# Hi \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm Vincent Tang, a software engineer specialized in product design and\nmanufacturing.
