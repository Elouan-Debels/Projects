With the upgrade, these smart bombs will reportedly become smarter.\n\nCombining a UMPC bomb and the Su-34 is a force to reckon with. Conceptually,\nUMPC is comparable to the US Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), which\ntransforms \u201cdumb bombs\u201d or unguided bombs into precision-guided, all-weather\nmunitions. For instance, the UMPC kits are mounted on FAB-250 and FAB-500\nbombs, among others.\n\nA UMPC kit is attached to a free-falling bomb to transform it into a guided\nbomb. The module has a control system that fires ammunition automatically at\nthe target, folding wings and rudders. The kit essentially makes any bomb into\na high-precision one and thus could be used to attack high-value targets.\n\nTherefore, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) has decided to launch a mass\ntraining program to teach fighter pilots how to use aerial bombs with UMPC\n(Universal Module for Planning & Correction), Russian language agency RIA\nNovosti reported.\n\nThe report also noted that the Su-34 bomber frequently drops bombs with 250,\n500, and 1500 kilograms of UMPC caliber on Ukraine. In addition to destroying\nenemy air targets, the Su-34 is built to perform accurate missile and bomb\nstrikes against ground targets in tactical and operational depth.\n\nRussia\u2019s Su-34 tactical bomber, which Russian aviators affectionately call the\nDuckling due to its flattened nose cone, has proven to be a potent armament\nsystem throughout the conflict.\n\nVKS Su-34 strike fighter taking off with a pair of UMPK-equipped FAB -500 M-62\n500kg-class HE bombs (via Platform X)\n\n\u201cA batch of Su-34 frontline bombers was recently transferred to one of the\ntraining centers of the Russian Aerospace Forces, which will be used for mass\ntraining of pilots in the use of air bombs with UMPC that have already proven\nthemselves in the area of the special operation in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis will increase the number of pilots who can use this ammunition and\nincrease strikes with smart air bombs in the SVO zone on Ukrainian military\nfacilities,\u201d an informed unnamed insider was quoted as saying by the RIA\nreport.\n\nAs per the source, the combat efficacy of the UMPC has been established in the\nso-called \u2018Special Military Operation Zone\u2019 by the Russian forces. It is\ninexpensive and guarantees the precise attack on Ukrainian troops on the line\nof contact. UMPC strikes often target enemy personnel concentrations,\ndeployment sites, fortifications, and command centers.\n\nThe UMPC made it possible for a Su-34 to conduct high-altitude patrols,\nmaximize endurance and minimize fuel consumption, and deliver precise assaults\non targets in Ukraine from a distance of up to 70 km, far beyond the reach of\nUkrainian air defenses.\n\nThe short flight duration of UMPC-equipped bombs makes engaging with air\ndefense systems very tough, making them invincible. Smart bombs enable\naircraft to avoid the enemy\u2019s air defense zone. This is dependent on the\naircraft\u2019s height and speed. To destroy the target, the plane does not have to\nfly very close to it and drop the required amount of bombs over it.\n\nIt required several months for the UMPC kits\u2019 performance to stabilize so mass\nproduction could begin. However, they make the Su-34 a very potent system by\nallowing it to carry a heavy payload.\n\nSu-34 aircraft armed with FAB-500M62 UMPC were seen inflicting heavy damage on\nUkrainian troops soon after the Ukrainian counteroffensive was launched in\nJune this year. Currently, Su-34s also use massive FAB-1500M54 UMPC bombs,\nwhose first successful combat use was recorded in early September.\n\n> !!\ufe0f\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83d\udca5 Russian Army Deploys FAB-1500 with UPMK for the First Time, Reports\n> Fighterbomber\n>\n> \u25aa\ufe0f The range of bomb delivery has been significantly increased (compared to\n> similar, lower-yield munitions) thanks to the new glider design.\n>\n> \u25aa\ufe0f With an advertised accuracy of 5 meters, the...\n> pic.twitter.com/lRTr0qHr4P\n>\n> \u2014 Zlatti71 (@djuric_zlatko) September 5, 2023\n\nSince the UMPC bombs were first introduced into the battlefield, Russian\nforces have increased the accuracy of the UMPC kits and added other\nimprovements, like the capability to set target coordinates from the cockpit\nbefore releasing the bomb, which increases the explosives\u2019 adaptability. The\nnew set of software upgrades, as reported by FighterBomber, is anticipated to\nbolster its accuracy and efficacy further.\n\nWhile Russia is working on making its firepower more lethal, Ukraine has once\nagain been left wanting in the delivery of long-range Ground Launched Small\nDiameter Bomb (GLSDB).\n\n## GLSDB Not Coming To Ukraine This Year!\n\nAs per the Pentagon and individuals acquainted with the schedule, Ukraine will\nhave to bide its time until next year to receive the first significant\nconsignment of rocket-propelled bombs that the United States has modified to\nlaunch at a range of around 100 miles (160 kilometers).\n\nCiting a document accessed by it last October, Reuters reported when Boeing\nfirst asked the US to purchase and sell the Ground Launched Small Diameter\nBomb (GLSDB) to Ukraine, the most optimistic shipping schedule was somewhere\nin the spring of this year. Politico revealed in February that delivery might\noccur later in 2023.\n\nUkraine requires GLSDB to supplement the few ATACMS rockets with a 100-mile\nrange that the US has delivered. The Ukrainian military will be able to attack\ntargets twice as far as they can currently with missiles fired by the High\nMobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) provided by the United States.\n\nFile Image: Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB)\n\nIt can be fired from HIMARS and was anticipated to put all of Russia\u2019s supply\ncorridors in the east of the country and parts of Crimea within reach. Experts\npredicted that Russian forces would be exposed, forcing Moscow to transfer its\nsupplies from the front lines.\n\nAccording to people who know the present schedule, Boeing, the GLSDB\u2019s prime\ncontractor, will send the munitions to the United States in late December. It\nwill then undergo several months of testing before being shipped to Ukraine.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said, \u201cWe anticipate providing this key capability in the\nearly 2024 timeframe after successful verification,\u201d another term for testing.\nThe GLSDB bombs are a relatively recent modification of the GBU-39/B Small\nDiameter Bombs (SDBs), first promised to Ukraine in February.\n\nRussia claimed to have intercepted and shot down the Ground-Launched Small\nDiameter Bomb (GLSDB) in March this year, just over a month after the US\npromised the weapon in its military aid to Ukraine. However, these claims have\nsince been refuted by relevant authorities in the US and Ukraine.\n\n  * Contact the author at sakshi.tiwari9555 (at) gmail.com\n  * Follow EurAsian Times on Google News\n\nShare\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddIt\n\nPrevious articleUS Military\u2019s \u2018Most Secretive\u2019 Spacecraft, X-37B, Launched On\nA Falcon Heavy Rocket, Delayed By A Few Days\n\nNext articleRussia Eliminates \u2018Tech Gap\u2019 With Ukraine; Aggressively Works To\nDevelop One-Way Attack USVs\n\nSakshi Tiwari\n\nSakshi Tiwari has studied journalism from the prestigious Indian Institute of\nMass Communication and holds a masters\u2019 degree in Defense and National\nSecurity.
