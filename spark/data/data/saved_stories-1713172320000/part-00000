As technology improves, this process will\naccelerate.\n\nHere are two quotes from his post: \u201cNo one doubts this process is\naccelerating\u201d and \u201cthe world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than\nit did in the last 40\u201d. I want to push back on this.\n\nThis only looks at one force: the technological force. And that\u2019s clearly\nincreasing. But it ignores the opposing force: that making something addictive\nis (probably) getting harder. The stuff that was easy to make addictive, like\nopium into heroin, people figured out long ago. We\u2019ve done the low-hanging\nfruits and now we need higher ladders.\n\nMore generally, exponential growth (or a positive feedback loop) on one side\nof an arms race doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that side will win. You have to\nconsider the other side too.\n\nA few more examples:\n\n  * All tools can help you make better tools. If that were the only force, tool quality and capability would have improved exponentially, but this ignores the other force: that making better tools gets harder once you\u2019ve made the obvious initial improvements.\n\n  * It\u2019s said that technology will replace jobs exponentially faster. Technology is one force, but there\u2019s another: replacing jobs is getting harder. We\u2019ve replaced the easy ones. These forces balance out so that job replacement has been roughly linear for the last 20 years. (Source)\n\n  * One fear about AGI is that once an AI can improve itself, that will start an exponential explosion of improvements and the AI will be unimaginably smarter very quickly. But this ignores the other force: that making AI improvements will probably become exponentially more difficult.\n\n  * Our ability to do science hasn\u2019t significantly improved, but it\u2019s getting harder to discover new things. The predictable outcome is that it takes many more scientists to make the same number of discoveries than it used to. (Source)\n\nExponential technology doesn\u2019t imply that we\u2019ll pick exponentially more\napples, if those apples are harder to get.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
