Maybe Google would have had a different name, or\nperhaps it would have been sold in 2000. One thing we do know is that there\nwas a potential third founder. But before we delve into this, let's take a\nmoment to consider what that founder missed out on.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin are the only two who own the majority of the\ncompany. As of today, their stock alone is worth 100's of billions of dollars\ncombined. But actually, there was to be a potential third founder, and his\nname was Scott Hassan.In 1996, Sergey and Larry worked at Stanford on a\nproject called BackRub. There was initially an unofficial founder called Scott\nHassan.\n\nHe was the lead programmer and wrote most of the original code for the Google\nsearch engine. He left before Google could be founded as a company. Larry\ninitially considered a dissertation topic exploring the connection between\nmathematics and the World Wide Web. He envisioned it as a vast graph. After\ndiscussing the idea with his advisor, Terry Winograd, who was enthusiastic\nabout it, Terry encouraged him to pursue the topic further. Page later\nreflected on this advice as \"The best advice I ever got.\"\n\nLarry's thesis needs to be completed, focusing on two dynamics: the World Wide\nWeb and understanding its link structure as a huge graph. The challenge is to\nlink a page to other online web pages and determine why it is an excellent\npage to bring up for a search query. While academic papers use citations to\nlink to written works, the online world lacks this measure. Larry discussed\nhis dilemma with Hassan, who helped him create the code gradually.\n\nSergey, who was working on his Ph.D. degree, joined the team. This project\nbecame known as \"BackRub,\" a name that will be discussed later in this\nchapter.\n\nBy March 1996, Page had a web crawler, which was the starting point for him to\nconvert backlink data and use it later down the line. Then to make sense of\nthe results, the PageRank algorithm was created. Larry Page would say that\nScott Hassan and Alan Steremberg, also a computer engineer from Stanford, were\npivotal to the creation of BackRub and Google's success. That's always\ninteresting to see how founders honor the work of previous individuals who\nhelped build Google. Usually, those in the early stages know the struggles\nthat occurred along the way.\n\nScott Hassan programmed the original Google search engine, then known as\nBackRub. At the time, he was a research assistant at Stanford University. But\nhe left Google before it was founded as a company. In 1998 Scott bought\n160,000 Google shares for $800, worth $13 billion today. Even though he did\nnot continue with Google, he developed more projects. One included FindMail,\nlater named eGroups.com, which was an email management site. Yahoo eventually\npurchased that for $432 million and renamed it Yahoo Groups. His last noted\nbusiness venture was with a robotics research lab called Willow Garage for\nrobotics software, which closed in early 2014.\n\nGoing from BackRub and coding the first iteration of the Google search engine\nis not easy. It is impressive that he helped build a search engine that is\nstill the most popular today. Although he is not the third member of the\nfounder group of Google, He performed well with his Google shares and the\nYahoo acquisition of his company. While Google did not have a third founder,\nit was interesting to see how BackRub did play a role in the company.
