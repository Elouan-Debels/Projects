So he engineers himself to have new passions.\nOne moment he is pushing the boundaries of higher mathematics; the next he is\nwriting operas. \u201cHe\u2019d even been interested in the Elysians [the afterlife],\nonce. No longer. He preferred to think about table legs.\u201d Peer\u2019s fickleness\nrelates to a deeper point. When technology has solved humanity\u2019s deepest\nproblems, what is left to do?\n\nThat is one question considered in a new book by Nick Bostrom, a philosopher\nat the University of Oxford, whose last book argued that humanity faced a one-\nin-six chance of being wiped out in the next 100 years, perhaps owing to the\ndevelopment of dangerous forms of artificial intelligence (AI). In Mr\nBostrom\u2019s latest publication, \u201cDeep Utopia\u201d, he considers a rather different\noutcome. What happens if AI goes extraordinarily well? Under one scenario\npresented in the book, the technology progresses to the point at which it can\ndo all economically valuable work at near-zero cost. Under a yet more radical\nscenario, even tasks that you might think would be reserved for humans, such\nas parenting, can be done better by AI. This may sound more dystopian than\nutopian, but Mr Bostrom argues otherwise.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
