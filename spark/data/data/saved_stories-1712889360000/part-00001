My teenage daughter, Zoe, playing the Axis powers, made quick\nwork of France. England was standing alone as the German navy massed in the\nchannel. But, even as all seemed lost, and Operation Sealion was underway, the\nRoyal Airforce swung into action. In a single turn the German battleship and\ncruisers were sunk. And a valuable life lesson on the importance of\nmaintaining air superiority was instilled in my teenager\u2019s mind. (As valuable\na life lesson as never get involved in a land war in Asia in my humble\nopinion).\n\nThe current state of the battle \u2013 England stands alone \u2013 the Soviet Union and\nthe US are still neutral.\n\nWhen you think of airpower in the Second World War there\u2019s at least one name\nworth remembering. Not a pilot or commander, but a statistician, Abraham Wald.\nIn a series of eight memoranda, while working at the Statistical Research\nGroup within the US military (yes they had an applied mathematics department),\nWald worked out the secret to placing armour on aircraft bombers in a way that\nsaved countless lives.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem Wald was confronted with. The commanders wanted to place\narmour on their bombers, but clearly couldn\u2019t put it everywhere because it was\ntoo heavy. So where is it best to armour a plane to maximise its chance of\nsurvival? Wald looked at all the planes that returned from missions and saw a\npattern of bullet holes like this:\n\nDistribution of bullet holes in aircraft that returned to base after missions.\nSketch by Wald. In \u201cVisual Revelations\u201d by Howard Wainer. Lawrence Erlbaum and\nAssociates, 1997.\n\nSo, where should you put the armour? Have a think before reading on.\n\nThe commanders saw it clearly. Put the armour where the most bullet holes are.\nThat\u2019s where the planes are getting shot the most.\n\nAnd, of course, that would have been a complete disaster. Wald showed that\nactually, you should put the armour where the bullet holes aren\u2019t.\n\nWhy? Well the commanders had fallen for the classic fallacy of survivorship\nbias. They were only examining the aircraft that made it back to base. The\nsurvivors. The missing aircraft, with their locations of bullet holes, were\nnever seen by the commanders. And therefore not taken into account. Wald\nshowed that it was odds-on that those missing aircraft had holes in very\ndifferent places, on average, than the surviving aircraft.\n\nIn short, what Wald\u2019s diagram showed was the places an aircraft could take\nhits and still get home. These were the places you didn\u2019t have to put armour\non. The exact opposite to what the top brass wanted to do.\n\nThe essence of survivorship bias is that you often don\u2019t see the failures. In\nbusiness, in life, and in war. And sometimes it\u2019s the failures that have the\nmost important lessons. Like the planes that didn\u2019t make it back. Wald\u2019s\nreasoning went on to save lives not only in World War Two, but also in Korea\nand Vietnam.\n\nYou can read a technical account of Wald\u2019s statistical reasoning here. And a\ngreat account of this story in David McRaney\u2019s fantastic \u201cYou are not so\nsmart\u201d podcast here.\n\nAs always, if you want to receive these weekly posts as an email, drop me a\nline at nick@clearthinking.co. Also, I\u2019d love you to say where you\u2019ve seen\nexamples of survivorship bias in action in life or business. When you start\nlooking for it, it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nTags: cognitive biassurvivorship bias\n\nShare:\n\nPrev Next\n\n## Related Posts\n\nMarch 20, 2016\n\nMarch 20, 2016\n\n##### Is Donald Trump a living example of the Dunning Kruger effect?\n\nDid you see the David Brooks\u2019 op-ed piece in the New York Times over the\nweekend?
