They only\nhave so much context they can attend to. If you\u2019re out of this context, they\nforget everything you spoke about with them.\u201d\n\nEven the most advanced chatbots can only process about 16,000 words of text\nwithin a prompt when in conversation with a human user. This is called a\n\u201ccontext window.\u201d And they can\u2019t connect the information they receive during\ndifferent \u201cconversations\u201d with a human, or build a storyline.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

We use memory and complex, layered comprehension to\nfollow multiple characters through twisting plots, scene changes, and\nnarrative. And while we might not think about it, the average novel averages\naround 80,000 words. The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde, for instance,\nruns at 82,000 words, while The Souls of Black Folk, by W.E. DuBois, totals\naround 72,000. The Little Prince, a children\u2019s book, by Antoine de Saint-\nExup\u00e9ry, has around 17,000 words. All those words gradually build a story we\nhold and examine in our minds. But such skills are currently out of reach to\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT, which can process text\nbut cannot be said to read the way we do.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> The problem is that LLMs are complete amnesiacs.\n\nTogether with Ky-Vinh Mai, who studies complexity at the University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, Moskvichev built a new database that trains LLMs to read\nand analyze long stretches of text as part of a postdoc at the Santa Fe\nInstitute, an independent non-profit theoretical research institute. The pair\nunveiled their new tool, Narrative XL, at the Empirical Methods in Natural\nLanguage Processing conference in Singapore late last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a dataset\nwith very long contexts,\u201d Moskvichev says. As a training tool it offers more\nthan a million questions for LLMs to practice on\u2014\u201cway above everything that\nwas there before.\u201d It is a \u201csupervised\u201d dataset, he says, which means there\nare gold standard answers the AI is expected to score correctly on, making\nassessment possible.\n\nMoskvichev and Mai built Narrative XL from 1,500 books publicly available\nthrough Project Gutenberg. They train LLMs in reading comprehension by having\nthe AI read a book in the database, then asking it to find a correct scene\nsummary from a pool of options. Some summaries are accurate, while others\ninclude decoy scenes or are \u201ccorrupted\u201d with characters from other books\u2014say,\nDracula moonlighting as a protagonist in Pride and Prejudice.\n\nTo train memory, Moskvichev and Mai compiled read-along questions, where the\nAI is expected to know more of the plot if it has read further into the\nbook\u2014but nothing beyond that point. For example, if the AI has only read half-\nway through Pride and Prejudice, it should still \u201cworry\u201d over whether Miss\nBennett marries Mr. Darcy. (Spoiler alert\u2014she does, but Austin saves the\nnuptials for a grand finale!) Because memory is a function of time, where the\nsequence of events matters, accidental knowledge of future events, even when\nfactually correct, counts as a false memory. Any reference to the pair as\nmarried in a summary of the book, should be identified by the AI as false,\nunless it has been shown the entire text in its context window.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

So not only would Dracula\nhave to be removed from Pride and Prejudice, an LLM in training would need to\nreplace him with the correct character. This requires nuanced comprehension,\nan understanding of how the characters function in relation to one another.\n\nThe 1,500 books and nearly 1 million questions in Narrative XL surpass\nexisting book training databases in size by at least twofold. BookSum is a\ntraining database released in 2021 that compiles 405 books for training AIs.\nThe average context window for all available training databases remains under\n15,000 words. One of the roadblocks for developing such training tools for AI\nis human resources: To accurately summarize a book requires for someone to\nread it, and design the training questions. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive to collect a\nsupervised data set of this type,\u201d Moskvichev says. It is here that the pair\nused a stroke of ingenuity\u2014they built Narrative XL by getting ChatGPT3.5 to\nsummarize short book sections, a task at which LLMs excel. It is an example of\na machine being used to train a more powerful machine.\n\nWhile Moskvichev and Mai validated the use of NarrativeXL as a training tool\nand observed significant improvement in trained LLM performance versus\nuntrained, the LLMs still make mistakes approximately half of the time. \u201cAI\nmodels are very tricky. They\u2019re sneaky, and they cheat when they can,\u201d\nMoskvichev says.\n\nThe heart of the problem is that chatbots are designed to identify the\nquickest path to an answer, which rarely involves reading everything. It is\nsimply never a wild guess to predict that the heroine of a 19th-century\nromance will get the guy, a shortcut that can land the AI in trouble. \u201cThere\u2019s\nstill room for improvement,\u201d Moskvichev says.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
