But this year, even before the first\nrays of the vernal dawn had struck the famous standing stones, a shadow was\nhanging over proceedings.\n\nA month earlier, in February 2024, a High Court judge had rejected a legal\nchallenge against plans to build a road tunnel under the World Heritage site\nin Wiltshire, south-west England, paving the way for one of the UK's most\ncontroversial construction projects in living memory.\n\n\"It was a dark day for the UK,\" said John Adams, chairman of the Stonehenge\nAlliance, a group that campaigns against the tunnel project. \"Imagine if we\nheard they were going to build a bypass over the Egyptian pyramids or a\nflyover across one corner of the Gardens of Versailles? We'd think it was\nextraordinary.\"\n\nThis is a long-running saga, the tunnel first having been proposed in the\nmid-1990s. Since then, estimated costs have surged as high as \u00a32.5bn. The UK's\nNational Highways agency say the tunnel will ease congestion on the traffic-\nchoked A303 road, which passes by Stonehenge and currently offers drivers a\nfamous view of the stones. The main highway will be moved underground and\nslightly further away from the stones than the current road, which will be\nreplaced by a public right of way open to walkers, cyclists and horse-riders.\nNational Highways say this will improve the visitor experience, by returning\n\"the Stonehenge landscape to something like its original setting\".\n\nHowever, Unesco have condemned the plan on the basis that the proposed tunnel\nencroaches significantly on the World Heritage Site area that surrounds\nStonehenge and is a significant and largely unexcavated archaeological\nlandscape. They have threatened to place Stonehenge on the World Heritage in\nDanger list, which is the first step towards being delisted as a World\nHeritage site altogether. \"There have only ever been three World Heritage\nsites delisted,\" Adams said, \"and the UK's got one already \u2013 the Liverpool\nMaritime Mercantile City, which lost its status in 2021. If Stonehenge were to\nbe delisted as well, it would be an international embarrassment.\"\n\nAdrian Dennis/Getty Images\n\nProtestors fear that the proposed tunnel will impact the largely unexcavated\narchaeological landscape (Credit: Adrian Dennis/Getty Images)\n\nPrestige aside, there are grave concerns about the more tangible consequences\nof ploughing a tunnel through a World Heritage site. \"From an archaeological\npoint of view, there are serious issues,\" said Professor Mike Parker Pearson,\nan archaeologist at University College London and a leading authority on\nStonehenge. \"The area which the tunnel will go through was part of a very\ndense and large settlement dating from the later period in which Stonehenge\nwas built; quite possibly where the builders themselves would have actually\nlived,\" he said. \"An estimated half a million artefacts will be removed\nwithout record and dumped somewhere else within the rebuilt highway. It's not\nonly a great loss for us in the present, but it's misleading for any\narchaeologists who might dig this stuff up in the future.\"\n\nIt's not only a great loss for us in the present, but it's misleading for any\narchaeologists who might dig this stuff up in the future\n\nEnvironmentalist groups like Friends of the Earth are concerned about the\nsignificant damage that the building project will cause to wildlife and their\nhabitats. There are also people, particularly members of the Pagan community,\nfor whom Stonehenge is a sacred site, and who fear that the tunnel project\ncould desecrate the landscape. \"[The] loss of harmony, energy connections and\ntranquillity will affect and inhibit peaceful enjoyment of communing in a\nsacred manner and expressing reverence, respect and honouring of Higher\nSpirits and ancestors,\" wrote Archdruid Lois Lloyd in a 2019 letter to the\nBritish government.\n\nHonouring the ancestors is one thing, but there's a large community of people\nin the vicinity of Stonehenge whose quality of life is being severely\ndiminished by the traffic congestion on the current road. I grew up in\nWiltshire, a half-hour drive from Stonehenge, and have experienced the\ninterminable traffic jams on the A303. This road is one of the main arteries\nbetween London, Devon and Cornwall, so the traffic has a significant impact on\ntourism and trade for the West Country as a whole.\n\nAs a youth, I believed a local piece of received wisdom: that a large part of\nthe reason for the traffic on the road was because people were slowing down to\nlook at the stones. But this is wrong, according to Janice Hassett, founder of\nthe Stonehenge Traffic Action Group.\n\nMatt Cardy/Getty Images\n\nThe controversial project aims to ease congestion on the traffic-choked A303,\nwhich passes by Stonehenge (Credit: Matt Cardy/Getty Images)\n\n\"The road's too narrow \u2013 it's not a question of people slowing down to look at\nthe stones,\" she said. \"The road finds its way into Shrewton [the nearest\nvillage], where it was measured that in a single month, 169,000 vehicles used\nan entrance 8m wide. Pedestrians are having to control traffic themselves,\nputting their hands up to cross the road.\n\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022 An immense mystery older than Stonehenge\n\n\u2022 A mysterious cult that predates Stonehenge\n\n\u2022 What did Stonehenge sound like?\n\n\"You have to plan your whole life around the road \u2013 when I lived in Shrewton I\ncould only go to the supermarket on Tuesdays, because that was the quietest\nday for traffic.\"\n\nStonehenge is just one part of an extraordinarily rich prehistoric landscape\nthat once would have included structures in both stone and wood. Among Parker\nPearson's celebrated body of work about the area is the theory that the\nephemeral wooden structures, which have long since decomposed, had some ritual\nuse associated with the living, while those destined to survive the millennia\n\u2013 those built in stone \u2013 were connected with the dead.\n\nNow, 4,500 years later, that same duality continues to dominate the\nconversation around Stonehenge \u2013 how to honour heritage while also making\nallowances for the living present.\n\n\"There needs to be a balance,\" Hassett said, \"between the living and the\ndead.\"\n\n\\--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your\ninbox every Friday.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or\nfollow us on X and Instagram.\n\nHeritage\n\nNews Features\n\nRelated\n\n## How Berlin's techno scene transformed the city\n\n22 Mar 2024\n\nTravel\n\n## How the Arctic Games can survive without snow\n\n11 Mar 2024\n\nTravel\n\n## The world's most unique 'Book Village'\n\n27 Feb 2024\n\nTravel\n\nMore\n\n12 hrs ago\n\n## How 'forever chemicals' get into tap water\n\nThe US is introducing new environmental protections aimed at limiting long-\nlived PFAS chemicals in tap water, but these are only the tip of a very\npersistent iceberg.\n\n12 hrs ago\n\nFuture\n\n17 hrs ago\n\n## J Cole and Kendrick Lamar: Is the diss track over?\n\nAs the feud between Kendrick Lamar and J Cole took a swift U-turn this week,\nmusic's long history of beefs, battles and diss tracks could finally be dying\nout\n\n17 hrs ago\n\nCulture\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Global retirement: '75 is the new 65'\n\nPeople are living longer, and daily life is getting more expensive.
