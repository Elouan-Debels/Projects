In her house, you\u2019ll find not one but two\nPeloton machines. There\u2019s the bike that the company is known for, and in her\ngarage, there\u2019s the company\u2019s smaller treadmill. A rack of running medals\nhangs on the wall right near it. On our video call, she shows up in a Peloton\nshirt, a little shy, but her enthusiasm practically buzzes through the screen.\n\nMany owners of Peloton bikes wind up using them as very expensive drying\nracks; Fernandez is not one of those people. Her love for the beleaguered\nfitness company stretches back to 2018. On a day-to-day basis, she has her\nregular workout. That includes runs, bike, strength, or bootcamp classes,\nwhich combine cardio on the Bike or Tread with strength training. Then, she\nlistens to Peloton\u2019s outdoor classes while walking the dog. Before bed, she\nfires up the app to listen to a guided meditation. When she went to a friend\u2019s\nwedding, she was at her hotel gym taking Peloton classes.\n\nDuring a recent marathon race, Fernandez put an outdoor audio class on her\nheadphones when she felt like she needed an emotional boost. \u201cIt was my\ncomfort zone and what I was familiar with. I could hear my favorite\ninstructors in my head, and it got me through my race.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people love Peloton as much as Fernandez does. Even so, Peloton\nplummeted from a pandemic-high valuation of $50 billion to $2.1 billion as of\nDecember 2023. The company sank about a billion dollars into meeting a\nquarantine-driven demand and was seemingly taken by surprise when lockdowns\nended. Between 2020 and now, it laid off thousands of employees, recalled two\ntreadmills, and saw the ouster of a CEO.\n\nBut people like Jessika Fernandez are why Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy insists\nthat Peloton is more than \u201cthat bike company.\u201d To hear him tell it, Peloton\u2019s\npath to redemption is paved with content because that\u2019s the real beating heart\nof Peloton.\n\nStill, it\u2019s one thing to fix a struggling hardware company. It\u2019s another to\nalso be a successful media empire.\n\nLoading ...\n\nIt\u2019sIt\u2019s not a mystery why Peloton\u2019s valuation has fallen so precipitously\nsince the covid-19 pandemic. Everyone flocked to the company during\nquarantine, when home fitness thrived as gyms closed their doors. Peloton\nramped up production to meet that demand and then floundered when vaccines\nhelped reopen the world. But within that obvious narrative, Peloton itself\nseemed to invite drama \u2014 not avoid it.\n\nBefore the pandemic, then-CEO John Foley funneled fistfuls of cash at petty\npatent disputes with its rivals. (RIP, Flywheel.) There was the infamous\nChristmas commercial, conceptually meant to be the video diary of a woman\ngifted with a Peloton, but so flawed in execution that The Washington Post\ncalled it \u201ca dystopian fitness inspo hellscape.\u201d In 2020, the company \u2014 like\nmany others \u2014 was hit by supply chain disruptions that led to angry customers\nand monthslong delivery delays. To fix that, Peloton spent $100 million in\nexpress shipping, dedicated another $400 million to a factory in Ohio, and\nbought commercial fitness equipment maker Precor for $420 million. It was the\nclassic gamble of spending big to win big. Connected fitness was all the rage;\nthe future of the gym would be streamed into your living room. (Peloton was\nasked for comment over the course of several weeks of reporting, but\nultimately declined to speak on the record.)\n\nConnected fitness was all the rage; the future of the gym would be streamed\ninto your living room.\n\nThen, in 2021, Peloton had to recall both of its treadmills. The cheaper Tread\nwas recalled before it even launched due to a wobbly screen. The more premium\nTread Plus had injured dozens of people, including several children and pets.\nIt killed a small child. Peloton did itself no favors in how it initially\nhandled the recall. Foley blamed the injuries on negligent parenting before\nfuriously backpedaling when that backfired. By the end of 2021, there were\nnonstop rumors of a sale and murmurs that the company planned to halt all\nproduction. And the cherry on top? Mr. Big died while on a Peloton Bike in the\nfirst episode of And Just Like That...\n\nA testy activist investor first wrote a letter demanding that Foley step down\nand then followed it up with a scathing 65-slide presentation detailing the\nCEO\u2019s failings. Shortly after, Foley resigned, current CEO Barry McCarthy came\non, and Peloton\u2019s dismal 2022 was marked by four rounds of layoffs in which\nover 5,000 employees lost their jobs. With this kind of volatile business soap\nopera, how has Peloton managed to make it this far?\n\nThat\u2019s easy: the fans.\n\nAroundAround the time Peloton was fumbling its treadmill recalls, Dancing With\nthe Stars fans were pissed. Some dude named Cody Rigsby had made it to the\nfinale, and frankly, who the frickin\u2019 hell was Cody Rigsby?\n\nThere\u2019s no reason the average person should know who Rigsby is. I polled\nroughly 30 friends, family, and coworkers. Only two had heard of him. Which\nmakes sense because Rigsby is a Peloton instructor. Arguably the most popular\nPeloton instructor with an army of fans who dub themselves the Boo Crew. On\nDWTS, a competition show where viewers vote for who gets to the next round, it\npays to have a Boo Crew.\n\nFandom always looks odd from the outside, but Rigsby\u2019s tenure on DWTS is\nexactly why Peloton has been able to outlast its imitators. What other\nconnected fitness brand has an instructor who is a household name? For many\nhouseholds, this recognition might be begrudging, but the point still stands:\nthe Boo Crew loves Rigsby so much, they\u2019re willing to go support him outside\nthe Peloton ecosystem. It\u2019s not unlike how people often follow the side\nprojects of their favorite TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube creators.\n\nAmanda Hasaka\u2019s Peloton journey started with just the app. Six months in, she\ngot the Bike and is now debating upgrading to the Bike Plus.\n\nThat fervent love seeps into every corner of Peloton\u2019s brand. Logically, if\nyou heard that your exorbitantly expensive treadmill had killed a child and\ninjured several others, you\u2019d probably return it when it\u2019s recalled. That\u2019s\nnot the case with Peloton. Several loyal Tread Plus users refused to return\ntheir treadmills. That loyalty is likely why Peloton was able to bring back\nthe Tread Plus for a whopping $6,000 late last year.\n\n\u201cOf all the products that I\u2019ve ever been exposed to with Peloton, the single\nproduct that you couldn\u2019t pry out of the dead hands of members is the Tread\nPlus,\u201d McCarthy said during Peloton\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings call. \u201cI mean they are\nabsolutely over the top, fanatically obsessed about the user experience on the\nTread Plus.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. Orders for the $6,000 Tread Plus opened in December, and as\nof right now, there\u2019s a backlog in demand.\n\nLoading ...\n\nWhatWhat does an \u201cover the top, fanatically obsessed\u201d Peloton user look like?\nTo find out, I spoke to several longtime Peloton users. There\u2019s Jessika\nFernandez, who I\u2019ve already mentioned, who\u2019s read the biographies of several\nPeloton instructors. There\u2019s Oz, who\u2019s getting his 13-year-old daughter into\nPeloton. And there\u2019s also Albert G., who raided TJ Maxx to get a set of\nPeloton dumbbells, yoga blocks, a water bottle, and apparel to go along with\nhis bike.\n\nThe Peloton diehards I spoke to don\u2019t necessarily build their lives around\nPeloton, but the company does become part of their lifestyle. The bikes sit in\nliving rooms, offices, and garages \u2014 sometimes accompanied by the treadmill or\nPeloton-branded weights. Most said they fit in at least a 30-minute workout\nabout five to seven times per week. Many had streaks lasting hundreds of\nweeks. A few have started getting their kids into Peloton. Multiple fans said\nthey buy Peloton apparel, follow the instructors on Instagram, and even read\nsaid instructors\u2019 books. When I asked who their favorite instructor was, many\nhad a hard time naming just one. Ben Alldis, in particular, was a popular pick\nfor his music choices and chill demeanor. Adrian Williams, Jess King, and Ally\nLove were also frequently mentioned. (Oddly enough, only two mentioned\nRigsby.)\n\nIn other words, the people I spoke to were pretty ordinary \u2014 and the main\nthing they had in common was that Peloton\u2019s platform just works for them. But\nwhich parts made the platform sticky was a bit harder to pin down.\n\n\u201cThe sweet spot is really the instructors. They\u2019re like gold. And the fact\nthat they\u2019re able to create so much original content,\u201d says Fernandez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had bikes and treadmills before where when you get tired or bored, you\njust get off and do something else. [But] when you take a class, even if it\u2019s\njust pre-recorded, you feel this accountability to the instructor if nobody\nelse,\u201d adds Drew McManus, who started using Peloton in 2019 and has since\ntaken about 4,000 classes. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. You wake up one day and you realize\nyou\u2019re following all of them on social media.\u201d\n\nJessika Fernandez\u2019s favorite Peloton instructor is Adrian Williams. She takes\nall of his Bootcamp classes because \u201che just tries to murder you.\u201d\n\nChris Messina says his partner takes Peloton yoga classes on the TV behind\ntheir bike. He tried Apple Fitness Plus, but it just wasn\u2019t the same.\n\nAside from the instructors, the sense of community with Peloton users is very\nreal. You see it the second you start pedaling via the Leaderboard, where you\ncan see in real time all the other folks taking the same class. You can also\n\u201chigh-five\u201d people in the same class. During classes, you\u2019ll also see some\nhashtags \u2014 some based on user identity, geography, and interests (e.g.,\n#PeloDoctors, #PelotonMoms, etc.) and others based on instructors (e.g.,\n#JessKingCollective, #BooCrew). Those are meant to help you find other fans or\nfriends to go do live rides with. The hashtags spill over to other social\nmedia platforms. There are several hundreds of Facebook groups, too. (My\nfavorite name is the #435amTribe \u2014 the Mothercluckers.)\n\n\u201cThe number of people I see pedaling for Jesus or, you know, #Pelo4Wine \u2014\nthere\u2019s just this wide gamut of people who would otherwise probably want to\nkill each other if they met in a random bar. But here, you\u2019re getting high\nfives from them,\u201d says Chris Messina, an investor and avid Peloton user.\n\nNot everyone I spoke to made heavy use of these features. Some, like\nFernandez, instead found more community through comments on blogs like Pelo\nBuddy, an enthusiast site that offers news, tips, and tricks. Some joined\nsubgroups within other fan communities. Many had checked out the Peloton\nsubreddit at one point or another. Amanda Hasaka, who started using Peloton\nduring the pandemic, has kept a yearslong thread going in a private podcast\ngroup collecting all the strength classes that don\u2019t go heavy on burpees or\nother high-impact moves. McManus found himself interacting with other Peloton\nusers in a small Slack group and on Mastodon. Others yet roped their real-life\nfriends, family, and colleagues into the community by being \u201cthe Peloton\nperson.\u201d\n\nLive classes are another draw, especially holiday-themed rides. Instead of an\nannual Turkey Trot, where you run a 5K on Thanksgiving in person, Peloton does\nthe Turkey Burn, an annual live ride. For the 2023 Turkey Burn, Peloton\u2019s\nservers crashed under the deluge of users trying to join in, prompting an\napology from McCarthy. Over 37,000 people were willing \u2014 nay, eager \u2014 to\nsubject themselves to a workout on a holiday famed for gluttony. That\u2019s\nsomething.\n\nThen there\u2019s Homecoming, a yearly event that Peloton puts on to thank its\nmembers. It\u2019s more like a convention, filled with special classes, product\nannouncements, and panels with instructors. In that vein, Peloton also\nrecently reopened its studios in New York and London so members could visit\nand be a part of its classes. As of this writing, every single class at\nPeloton Studios New York is fully booked for the next month.\n\nLoading ...\n\nLoyalLoyal fans and a sticky product should equal piles and piles of money.\nInstead, Peloton\u2019s valuation has dropped about 97 percent since its pandemic\nhigh. It\u2019s managed to turn it around a bit \u2014 Peloton\u2019s revenue has been\nsteadily clawing its way back for the past year, even if it\u2019s falling short of\ninvestor targets.\n\nBut it\u2019s not rolling in cash. Some of that might be because it\u2019s not always\nclear what Peloton views its product to be.\n\nThe company\u2019s leadership maintains that hardware will always be a key part of\nits strategy, and to be fair, there\u2019s a common through line when you speak to\nthe Peloton diehards.\n\n\u201cIt reduces friction working out and when I remember working out with Apple\nFitness Plus, like, I didn\u2019t even have a place to put my iPhone,\u201d says Oz, a\nlongtime Peloton user who switched from Apple\u2019s exercise service once he moved\nto the suburbs. \u201cI think when it comes to fitness, you just want the least\namount of friction because you\u2019re already kind of having a hard time wanting\nto do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could do a whole setup if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d says Hasaka, referring\nto how many people buy a cheaper machine with a tablet holder and pay for app\nsubscriptions only. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s a nice screen, the sound quality is\nreally good so I think it just made sense. I\u2019d rather do the proper bike\nsetup.\u201d\n\nHasaka says she started her Peloton journey using the free three-month trial\nthe company offered at the start of the pandemic. It wasn\u2019t until six months\nin that she bought the bike, and three-and-a-half years in, Hasaka says she\u2019s\ntempted to upgrade to the $2,495 Bike Plus.\n\nAlbert G not only has the Bike but also Peloton\u2019s weights, yoga strap,\ndumbbells, shirt, and water bottle. His hot tip is TJ Maxx has all of it for a\nfraction of the price.\n\nEven so, there\u2019s also been a clear shift away from the bikes, treadmills, and\nrowers that made the company famous. Because, while the Peloton faithful are\nsold on luxury equipment, fitness is highly personal. Even the slickest\nhardware experience won\u2019t resonate with everyone.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of friends who were very into Peloton during the pandemic, and\nthen now they\u2019re back in a gym or in-person class,\u201d says Fernandez, who says\nshe\u2019s seen firsthand how the hardware doesn\u2019t click with everyone. \u201cThey\u2019ve\nsold off their bike and it just served a purpose for them at the time.\u201d\n\nHence why McCarthy has spent two years removing proprietary hardware as a\nbarrier to access. That includes everything from a leasing program to opening\nup sales to third-party retailers. Last year, Peloton also rebranded its app,\nlaunching three app-only subscription tiers to lure people into its ecosystem.\nWhen Lululemon decided to call it quits with the Mirror, another rival for\nstrength, pilates, and yoga, Peloton swooped in with a five-year deal to share\ncontent between the two brands. As Lululemon parachutes out of the connected\nfitness business, its users will get access to Peloton classes. Along that\nvein, Peloton closed out 2023 by allowing some subscribers to pair the app\nwith third-party treadmills. It kicked off 2024 by announcing it\u2019s bringing\nshortform content to TikTok, with the hope of boosting the profiles of its\nlesser-known instructors.\n\nFor better or worse, Peloton is increasingly morphing into a streaming\nservice. A hardware company has to figure out supply chain logistics, but\nshipping a workable product is 90 percent of the challenge. A media company\nhas to do that and churn out high-quality content consistently. And that\u2019s not\nexactly an easy thing to pull off. Keeping your audience engaged is the stuff\nexecutives lose sleep over. Peloton doesn\u2019t want to be a media company \u2014 I\nmean, who can afford that in this economy? \u2014 but a lot of its problems sure\nlook like media company problems.\n\nMusic is an integral part of the connected fitness experience, yet licensing\nis an expensive endeavor. Peloton had licensing issues with the National Music\nPublishers\u2019 Association (NMPA) a few years back, replacing songs it no longer\nhad rights to with remixes. The move angered fans who\u2019d grown accustomed to\ncurated playlists. When TikTok pulled music from Universal Music Group artists\nafter negotiations to extend its license failed, McCarthy had to address it in\na recent earnings call, reassuring shareholders that the failed TikTok-UMG\ndeal won\u2019t affect Peloton content, since it has a separate agreement.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the sheer cost of keeping its instructors happy. The instructors\nare a big reason so many people pick Peloton over other connected fitness\nplatforms. But what happens if Cody Rigsby decides to pack it up one day and\ntake his 100,000-plus BooCrew and 1.3 million Instagram followers with him?\nHow much does it cost to keep Rigsby and the bullpen of Peloton instructors?\nPeloton hasn\u2019t disclosed how much its instructors make, but Rigsby\u2019s salary is\nestimated at over $500,000 annually. Rigsby\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t the only\nleverage he has over the company, either. Peloton\u2019s made him director of\ncycling, meaning he plays a role in talent recruitment and acts as a liaison\nbetween instructors and producers. That\u2019s a lot of power.\n\nLosing one or two instructors? That\u2019s something Peloton can and already has\nmoved past. Every single Peloton fan I spoke with also said that if their\nabsolute favorite instructor left, they\u2019d probably still stick with the\nplatform because there\u2019s a whole library of on-demand classes that they could\nretake. But what if Peloton instructors decided to unionize or a group of them\ndecided to break off and do their own thing? That would be a lot trickier.\nSome, like McManus, say that\u2019s exactly why they go out of their way to\ndiversify the instructors they take in the first place.\n\nLoading ...\n\nConnectedConnected fitness is in flux. Right now, McCarthy is throwing a bunch\nof things at the wall to see whether they\u2019ll stick \u2014 and so far, it\u2019s been a\nmixed bag. At its Q2 2024 earnings, McCarthy noted that while initiatives like\nbike rentals were showing promise, the company has yet to see its app-only\nsubscription strategy pay off. And Peloton\u2019s devoted fan base is aware of the\nheadlines.\n\n\u201cI have wondered what I\u2019d do if Peloton went out of business, because for a\nwhile it\u2019s felt like the future is not totally clear,\u201d says Alex Rainert,\nwho\u2019s been using Peloton since 2019. Rainert says, during the pandemic, his\nwife and kids each bought a single share of a stock to teach the children\nabout the stock market. Rainert chose Peloton. \u201cThat was the one where we got\nto go on the whole journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re gonna be around for the long term at this point as cooler\nheads have prevailed, but yeah, I worry about it. Like if they went out of\nbusiness or if they got acquired by somebody I wasn\u2019t thrilled about, I would\nbe bugged and looking for something else that I\u2019m not sure is out there,\u201d adds\nMcManus.\n\nDid investors really think the pandemic highs would last forever?\n\n\u201cI guess I just have faith that it will get figured out,\u201d says Fernandez. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t see it going away completely. And I think that would be such a shame if\nit did since there are so many loyal fans and users.\u201d\n\nDespite some uneasiness, the fans I spoke with pretty much echoed Fernandez\u2019s\nfeelings. What they weren\u2019t sure about was why Peloton and its investors\n\u201cneed\u201d to chase growth. Or at least the kind of growth it saw early on in the\npandemic. Did investors really think the pandemic highs would last forever?\nWhy can\u2019t the company and its investors be satisfied with a smaller but highly\nengaged audience?\n\nThey have a point. Peloton may be a life-changing service for the folks I\ntalked to, but creating a fitness habit is notoriously hard. It doesn\u2019t matter\nhow good Peloton\u2019s product is or how accessible it becomes. There\u2019ll always be\na ceiling, because fitness \u2014 let alone connected fitness \u2014 simply isn\u2019t\neveryone\u2019s thing.\n\nSo perhaps it\u2019s never been a question of whether Peloton can survive. Just\nwhether the adults in the room are okay with simply letting Peloton be.\n\nVerge Homepage\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a Vox Media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a92024 Vox Media, LLC.
