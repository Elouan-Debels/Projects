This add-on is yet another example\nillustrating how SimCity 4 continues to attract both player and modder\ninterest more than 21 years following its launch.\n\nOriginally released in January 2003, the fourth mainline entry in the SimCity\nfranchise is still touted as one of the best city-builder games ever made.\nPublic data available via the Steam API reveals that hundreds of players\ncontinue to enjoy it on a daily basis as of early April 2024. SimCity 4 has\nalso long boasted a healthy modding community, which keeps churning out all\nkinds of add-ons quite regularly.\n\nRelated\n\n##### 25 Best Games To Play If You Liked Cities: Skylines\n\nFans of Cities: Skylines don't lack options when it comes to simulation games.\nThese excellent alternatives should keep fans invested for a while.\n\nThe latest example of its efforts arrives in the form of the 3D Camera DLL mod\nby Simtropolis user Memo. Much like its name suggests, this modification\nallows players to make much more granular changes to the game's camera angles.\nBack in the early 2000s, Maxis opted against using a free-moving three-\ndimensional camera in favor of fixed trimetric orthographic projection\nallowing only a few angles for performance reasons. But with modern PCs being\nfully capable of handling more flexible solutions, Memo put together a DLL\nplugin that helps unlock the full potential of the SimCity 4 3D engine.\n\n## SimCity 4 Fans Thought 3D Camera Mod Was An April Fools' Joke\n\nThe add-on has been making the rounds on social media since early April,\ngarnering quite a bit of praise from the fandom. And while hundreds of players\nhave already downloaded it over the past week, this custom-made 3D camera\nplugin still had to overcome some initial skepticism. Specifically, Memo\ndropped the mod on April 1, which immediately led some SimCity 4 fans to\nwonder if the add-on wasn't an April Fools' joke, judging from the early\nreactions to this release posted on Reddit and Simtropolis.\n\n## How To Install and Use Memo's SimCity 4 3D Camera Mod\n\nInstalling the mod itself is as simple as downloading its 46kB DLL file and\nmoving it to the game's mod folder, which defaults to\nC:\\Users\\\\[$USERNAME]\\Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins on Windows. With that out of\nthe way, players can tweak the game's camera angle using either CameraPitch or\nCameraYaw commands in the cheat console. Both of those are meant to be\nfollowed by space-separated numbers representing exact angle values:\n\"CameraPitch 85,\" \"CameraYaw 45,\" etc. The add-on has been developed as an\nopen-source project, allowing tech-savvy users to even compile their own DLL\nfrom its source code, which is hosted in the memo33/sc4-3d-camera-dll GitHub\nrepository.\n\nMany players have already taken to social media to praise the 3D camera mod\nfor breathing new life into the 21-year-old game. Its release has also\ninspired some new discussion among the fandom about what a shame it is that\nthe SimCity franchise is effectively dead nowadays.\n\n##### SimCity 4\n\nPlatform(s)\n\n    PC , Microsoft Windows , iOS , macOS\n\nReleased\n\n    January 14, 2003\n\nDeveloper\n\n    Maxis, Aspyr, i5works\n\nPublisher\n\n    Maxis, Aspyr, i5works\n\nGenre(s)\n\n    City Builder , Strategy , Simulation\n\nEngine\n\n    GlassBox\n\nESRB\n\n    e\n\nHow Long To Beat\n\n    10 hours\n\nSee at Steam See at Apple App Store See at Amazon\n\nWe hope you like the items we recommend and discuss!
