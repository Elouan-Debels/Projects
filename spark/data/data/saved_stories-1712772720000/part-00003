Nathan Matias, Edward L Platt and Sarah Gilbert\n\nHow can democratic societies host hard conversations about our conflicts in\nways that keep important conversations going rather than shut them down? If\nyou\u2019ve been online at all this year, you\u2019ve probably witnessed a heated\nconversation with deep disagreement, whether it\u2019s about wars, injustice, or\neven just the question of who gets to speak.\n\nWhile some disagreement may be productive, it\u2019s not uncommon to see\nconversations slip into rule-violating behavior, such as flaming or personal\nattacks. On Reddit, volunteer moderators are tasked with reducing this kind of\nbehavior. However, they have limited tools at their disposal, relying mostly\non punitive measures, such as removing content and banning users. While these\ntools can help stop violations in their tracks, they may not help users learn\nhow to participate productively in a community in the future.\n\n  * How can we improve users\u2019 experience of bans and suspensions?\n  * What can online communities do to improve diverse dialog on contentious topics?\n\nFew communities know this challenge better than r/politics, one of the world\u2019s\nlargest conversation spaces about American politics. With nearly 8.5 million\nsubscribers, the subreddit is one of the most active and popular communities\nfor political discussions. It has hosted conversation threads for major US\nevents, such as Supreme Court decisions, crisis events, and political deaths,\nas well as AMAs (Ask Me Anything) with presidential candidates, senators, and\nentertainers with a variety of political views.\n\nr/politics wants to be a place where political discourse happens; however,\nbecause it\u2019s one of the largest spaces to discuss politics in America, it sees\na lot of egregious behavior and bad faith contribution. But because the issues\nat hand are often contentious, the community also gets out-of-bounds\ncontributions from people who were caught up in the moment or didn\u2019t\nunderstand the norms. Mods deal with bad faith contributions by issuing bans\nthat permanently prevent people from participating in the future. But to deal\nwith lesser violations, the community uses temporary suspensions to inform\npeople about how serious their non-normative behavior has been, and give them\ntime to cool off.\n\nHowever, open questions remain about how effective temporary suspensions are\nin mitigating future violations and helping people come back to be meaningful\ncontributors to the community. We want to help them with this through field\nexperiments.\n\n> r/politics, with 39 moderators and millions of comments per month, is one of\n> the largest spaces anywhere for people to discuss US political news\n\nSince 2022, we\u2019ve been working with r/politics mods to better understand how\nto effectively leverage the tools at their disposal to help rule-violating\ncommunity members participate successfully in their community in the future.\nAs the first step toward designing new research together, the moderators\nsecurely shared their mod log which we have analyzed alongside public records\nfrom the subreddit between Jan 2020 and the end of December 2021. To protect\npeople\u2019s information, we analyzed the data on secure, access-controlled\nservers with encrypted data stores, as part of a study that received ethics\nreview from Cornell\u2019s review board.\n\n## Why r/politics is so important and conversations can be so fraught\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the scale of r/politics, which is one of the\nlargest single spaces for conversations about US politics in the world\u2014 a\ncommunity with 8.5 million subscribers \u2014 more than MSNBC, USA Today have on\nYouTube. In the U.S., 8% of Americans regularly get news from Reddit.\n\nr/politics, with 39 moderators and millions of comments per month, is one of\nthe largest spaces anywhere for people to discuss US political news,\nespecially as news publishers continue to disable comments sections. In 2021,\na non-election year in the US, over 200 thousand reddit users posted nearly\n1.5 million comments per month on 20 thousand posts. Election years see even\nhigher activity. In the 30 days prior to the 2020 election, r/politics\nreceived 3.6 million comments on 49 thousand posts by 374 thousand unique user\naccounts.\n\nBecause r/politics is one of the only places where the average person\u2019s\nobservations about politics could be seen by millions of people, it attracts a\nfierce competition over opinions and agendas. Consequently, many comments in\nr/politics get removed for violating community norms \u2014 for example rules\nencouraging civility, discouraging doxxing, and encouraging recent news only.\n\nDuring non-election months, the community removed roughly 124 thousand\ncomments per month (8.5%). In the lead-up to an election, that increased to\n274 thousand comments (7.6%). It\u2019s possible that the true content removal\nrates might be even higher, since Reddit\u2019s own systems sometimes remove\nespecially-awful comments before community moderators and community bots\nnotice them.\n\nPosts| Comments| Comment Removals| Unique Active Accounts  \n---|---|---|---  \nNon-Election Year 30-Day Average| 20,000| 1,450,000| 124,000| 208,000  \n30 Days Before 2020 Election| 49,000| 3,595,000| 274,000| 374,000  \nTable 1: r/politics is one of the largest online spaces anywhere for\ndiscussing American politics, with hundreds of thousands of people joining\nshared conversations in the lead-up to important elections. Counts are rounded\nto the nearest thousand. (Date range: Jan 1 2021- Dec 31 for non-election\nyear, and Oct 4 2020 to Nov 3 2020 for election year)\n\nHow does that translate to the experience of commenters? Out of the 51\nthousand people who participated in an average month roughly 24% experienced\nat least one kind of post or comment removal \u2014 even if just for submitting a\nduplicate link. Nearly 4 thousand accounts received a temporary or permanent\nban on average, 1.9% of all posters and commenters per month. In the 30 days\nbefore an election, twice as many accounts receive a removal, but that\u2019s\nlargely because the community has 80% more commenters, a portion of which\nwould be bots and spammers; according to moderators, removed content from\nhuman accounts experience is typically due to civility violations. Since these\nrates depend on moderator capacity, it\u2019s possible that moderators might not\nnotice all norm violations in these high volume periods.\n\n# Experienced a Comment Removal| % Experienced a Comment Removal| #\nExperienced a Post Removal| % Experienced a Post Removal| Experienced\nSuspension or Ban| % Experienced Suspensionor Ban  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNon-Election Year 30-Day Avg| 50,900| 24%| 4,800| 2.3%| 3,900| 1.9%  \n30 Days Before 2020 Election| 103,000| 27%| 11,500| 3.1%| 5,700| 1.5%  \nTable 2: During a non-election month, over fifty thousand accounts in\nr/politics experience at least one comment or post removed by moderators.\nDuring the lead-up to a US presidential election, this number doubled, largely\nbecause the number of active accounts nearly doubled in this period. The\npercentage of accounts that received bans was also fairly stable between\nelection and non-election periods. Counts are rounded to the nearest\nhundredtsc. (Date range: Jan 1 2021- Dec 31 for non-election year, and Oct 4\n2020 to Nov 3 2020 for election year)\n\n## Who Gets Temporary and Permanent Bans in r/politics and What Happens Next?\n\nIn an ideal world, people who do get suspended or banned are able return and\nparticipate substantively in a respectful and productive way. To inform future\nresearch that tests interventions to support this kind of successful community\nparticipation, we decided to analyze differences in behavior for accounts that\ntemporary or permanent bans\u2014 and what happens after their accounts are\nrestored.\n\nTo study this, we created a dataset that analyzed participation in the six\nmonths before and after an account received their first temporary suspension.\nWe also created two other comparison groups: (a) accounts whose first ban was\npermanent and (b) accounts that were active on the same days as those that\nreceived temporary suspensions (Table 3).\n\n> what happens after a suspended account is restored? We found that 81% of\n> people in r/politics do come back and participate.\n\nAccounts that receive their first temporary suspension do have key differences\nfrom accounts that never received bans in our dataset. Temporarily suspended\naccounts comment much more and the median % of comments removed is 13\npercentage points higher than non-banned accounts\u2014a rate of removed comments\nthat is over 5 times higher. Accounts that receive permanent bans behave in\nways that moderators approve even less often, with a median of 40% of their\ncomments being removed.\n\nWhat happens after a temporarily suspended account is restored? We found that\n81% of people do come back and participate after temporary suspensions. Those\nthat return tend to follow the rules at higher rates than all suspended\naccounts in the period before suspension \u2014 though their median rate of comment\nremoval is still 4 times higher than accounts with no bans (Table 3).\nFurthermore, a quarter of accounts that return do get another ban of some kind\n(20% of accounts with temporary suspensions), so there\u2019s still huge room for\nimprovement in how the community supports the experience of temporary\nsuspensions.\n\nTotal| 6 months before ban/suspension, if any| 6 months after unban/suspension  \n---|---|---  \nMedian comments| Median % comments removed| Median posts| Median % posts\nremoved| Median days banned| % active| Median Comments| Median % comments\nremoved| Median posts| Median % posts removed| % Suspended again  \nAccounts with temporary suspensions| 26,613| 25| 17%| 0| 100%| 12.6| 81%| 13|\n8%| 0| 77%| 20%  \nAccounts with no bans| 1,970,351| 9| 3%| 0| 86%| 58%| 2| 2%| 0| 67%  \nAccounts with permanent bans| 26,062| 8| 40%| 0| 100%  \n  \nTable 3: The vast majority of r/politics commenters do not receive bans. Among\nthose with temporary suspensions, 81% participate in some way after their\naccount is restored, and the median % of comments removed is 9 percentage\npoints lower for restore accounts. Nevertheless, roughly a quarter of all\naccounts that receive a temporary suspension (20% / 81%) receive a second ban\nwithin six months after their account is restored.\n\n## Directions for Future Research with r/politics\n\nBased on this research, we\u2019re excited about the potential to develop research\nwith r/politics on ways to improve people\u2019s experience and re-integration to\nthe community after experiencing a ban. We think there is potential for\nseveral kinds of studies and experiments, if the community and moderators\nconsent:\n\n  * Surveys and interviews:\n\n    * Asking people who have experienced suspensions to tell us more about their experience and how to improve it, building on prior research about the topic\n  * Norms interventions:\n\n    * Messages that explain what a temporary suspension means\n    * Messages with guides on how to contribute productively to the community\n    * Messages from different political standpoints that describe the value of a functional shared conversation\n    * Messages that help people productively manage their moral outrage, which is one possible driving force behind heated conversations that get out of hand\n  * (Your ideas here)\n\n## Supporting Other Subreddits to Study Temporary Suspensions with CAT Lab\n\nIf you are a moderator of a community that is interested in fielding\nexperiments to test ideas to help people learn to contribute meaningfully to a\ncommunity after a temporary suspension, please reach out to Sarah Gilbert\neither through Reddit (/u/SarahAGilbert) or email (sarah.gilbert@cornell.edu).\nWe have rough draft software that could help generate a similar report for\nyour community, as well as support future experimentation this year.\n\nWhen you write to us, please check the following details. If you\u2019re unsure, we\ncan talk through it with you:\n\n  * Are you making at least dozens of temporary suspensions a month?\n  * Do you have at least a year of archived mod logs, for any period covered by the Pushshift dataset? (Reddit\u2019s founding up to April 2023)\n  * If your mod log data is more recent, do you have an alternative source of log data that we could work with?\n\nPosted in Blog, Reddit Studies\n\n  * CAT Lab\n\n  * Latest News & Posts\n  * Sign Up For Updates\n\n  * Our Funders\n  * CAT Lab in the Media\n  * Media Inquiries\n\n  * Cornell University Department of Communication\n\n", "frontpage": false}
