The\nreport also notes that the growth disparity between non-resource-abundant and\nresource-abundant countries will continue to widen. This juxtaposes the\nforecast that Sub-Saharan African nations will see faster development in 2024.\n\nResource-poor African countries set to outperform resource-rich nations\n\n  * Non-resource-abundant African nations are forecasted to outperform their resource-rich counterparts.\n  * The growth gap between resource-scarce and resource-rich countries is set to widen.\n  * The report underscores the importance of diversification, governance, and human capital for sustainable growth in Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#### Recommended articles\n\n  * markets 10 African countries with the highest inflation rate in 2024\n\n  * markets US urged to strengthen African ties for access to key minerals\n\n  * markets Kenya at risk of losing billions to its financial management tool - US warns\n\nThe perception that resource riches are a necessary condition for economic\nprosperity in Africa is being called into question by the rise of non-\nresource-rich nations as catalysts for economic growth and development. The\nprosperity of nations lacking substantial resources is mostly driven by\nvariables such as diversification, human capital investment, effective\ngovernance, and regional integration.\n\nThese nations are positioned to set the standard for sustainable and equitable\ngrowth in Africa as the continent continues its economic transformation path,\nproving that one need not rely entirely on natural resource endowments to\nachieve prosperity.\n\nA report by the World Bank titled \u201cAddressing Inequality to Revitalize Growth\nand Alleviate Poverty in Africa,\" highlights this fact as it forecasts that\nAfrican countries with fewer to no resources are set to outperform countries\non the continent with vast resources.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the report, not only are non-resource-rich African countries set\nto experience more growth, but the disparity between them and the resource-\nrich countries is set to widen.\n\n\u201cDeclining international commodity prices from their 2022 peaks are expected\nto weigh on exports for resource-abundant countries. Still, this group of\ncountries will grow from 2.2 percent in 2023 to 2.8 percent in 2024 as\nhydrocarbon projects resume or come online in Niger and Senegal and mining\nproduction kicks off in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, and Sierra\nLeone,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe report shows that compared to the growth of resource-abundant countries\nwhich is set to go from 2.2% to 2.8%, a 0,6% growth, the growth of non-\nresource-abundant countries in the same period is set to leap by 1%, going\nfrom 2.4% to 3.4%.\n\nDON'T MISS THIS: US urged to strengthen African ties for access to key\nminerals\n\nThis growth would be backed by both private consumption and gross fixed\ninvestment. \u201cGrowth in non-resource abundant countries is supported by gross\nfixed investment and private consumption, and these countries are expected to\ngrow from 2.4 percent in 2023 to 3.4 percent in 2024, and further increase to\n4 percent in 2025\u201326,\u201d the report adds.\n\nChinedu Okafor Chinedu is a Senior Reporter at Business Insider Africa with 5\nyears experience creating profoundly engaging and insightful content.\n\n### FOLLOW BUSINESS INSIDER AFRICA\n\nOur newsletter gives you access to a curated selection of the most important\nstories daily.\n\nThanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.
