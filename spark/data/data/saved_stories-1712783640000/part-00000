There's a lot of noise, and it's hard\nto know what exactly we, as web developers, need to know. The web is so much\nbigger than our team, so we wanted to gain some clarity around how you're\nthinking about AI, what you hope to learn, and what you want to do with these\nemerging technologies. That way, we can best provide you with content to break\nthrough that noise.\n\nNote: When we say artificial intelligence or AI, we're speaking generally\nabout the field and implementation of AI technology. We left the specifics of\nwhat the acronym AI could represent open to interpretation, so we could best\nhear what was on your minds.\n\nOver the last few months, we've spoken with web practitioners to understand\nthe landscape and how you think about AI. Of course, we can't talk to everyone\nabout everything. We had just a small set of conversations with web\ndevelopers, including web Google Developer Experts, focused on how developers\nare using AI to deliver user-facing features and to increase productivity in\ntheir daily workflow.\n\nWe believe that what we learned may be broadly applicable to other folks on\nthe web. And, we thought the community may be interested in hearing what we've\nlearned.\n\nWe took this feedback, along with other research of the web developer\nlandscape, to create our new AI collection. In this collection, you'll find\noverviews geared towards web developers, codelabs and demos, and other\nresources for thinking about AI tools and models on the web.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. You'll see much more from us in the coming\nmonths.\n\n## Improved productivity with generative AI\n\nWe noticed that web developers want to take advantage of generative AI to\nincrease their productivity and interact with chat bots to learn new\ntechnologies or seek answers to their web development questions.\n\nThe developers we talked to are either already using AI in their daily\nworkflow, for business or personal projects, or know someone who is.\n\n### Code generation\n\nWe learned from you that code generation tools, such as Gemini and Copilot,\nare great for standard unit tests, basic autocomplete (where you know what to\nwrite, but just need to write it), and simpler functions that don't require\nexpansive knowledge of the codebase. These tools tend to be less useful when\nit comes to writing more complex, algorithmic code and functions that require\nbroad context of a specific project.\n\nMore senior developers mentioned a concern around the long-term quality of\ntheir codebases, including issues around code duplication and long-term\nmaintainability. Some were concerned that less experienced team members may\nnot detect errors or know how to accurately validate the code produced by\ngenerative AI tools.\n\nDevelopers have also shared that use cases which require specific domain\nknowledge, such as writing accessible components, aren't yet accommodated\ncorrectly by code generation tools they've tried.\n\n### Learning with LLMs\n\nWe've seen many developers using ChatGPT and Gemini to learn software\ndevelopment concepts, like asking a large language model (LLM) to explain how\na sorting algorithm works, ramping up on different programming languages, or\nclosing knowledge gaps.\n\nYou think LLMs provide a great experience due to the quick interactivity of\nquestions and responses, and because AI won't criticize the questions being\nasked, and just provide the answer they need.\n\nOnce again, there is a concern related to more junior developers, where a\nminimal level of knowledge is necessary to catch the instances where the model\nis hallucinating and generating incorrect responses.\n\n### IP protection as a business concern\n\nMany of the developers we spoke with said their companies don't yet have\npolicies around developers using generative AI to increase their productivity.\nUsage of generative AI tools is often driven by the developers experimenting\nwith it.\n\n> \"My company generally misunderstands what AI means, so they're not creating\n> the right policies.\"\n\nHowever, businesses that do have a policy tend to discourage usage, due to\nconcerns around leaking the company's intellectual properties (IP) to third\nparties. There are cases where such policies have been changed, after engaging\ndirectly with the companies behind these tools to understand how the data is\nused and potential risks.\n\nWith enterprise accounts and partnerships which are dedicated to ensure data\nprotection, businesses are more likely to encourage developer usage.\n\n## Generative AI for user facing product features\n\nOn the product side, it wasn't a surprise to us that, when we prompted our\nconversation with the term \"AI / ML,\" the response was often focused on\ngenerative AI. Developers are curious on how generative AI can be used to\nimprove the experience for their users, but are unsure about what those\nexperiences look like and what are the tools available to deliver them in\nproduction.\n\nFor those developers that have built or are building generative AI features\ninto their products, using generative AI to answer user questions, with\nchatbots or one-off interfaces, is the most common use-case.\n\nOutput quality is the top concern we heard from you. In particular, developers\nhope to ensure the responses are accurate and aim to prevent the LLM from\ngenerating content unrelated to the intended goal. This is particularly true\nwhen the LLM's output is directly user-facing, such as a chatbot.\n\n> \"Demos with AI are wild. Everytime I demo my project, the output is\n> completely different.\"\n\nYou're putting a lot of effort into creating test suites to validate\ngenerative AI outputs for a wide variety of prompts, but there's no clear and\nestablished way to test or monitor the responses. Most of the evaluation work\nis manual. Many developers are new to handling non-deterministic outputs. As a\ncommunity, we haven't yet built systems which work well with them.\n\nThe cost of running a generative AI model is also an important concern, and\ndevelopers are carefully evaluating the cost against the benefits for their\nusers.\n\n### Standard versus customized models\n\nMost commonly, the developers we spoke to tended to rely on ready-made models\nand APIs. This optimizes the time-to-market and the use of engineering time\nand knowledge, which were limited.\n\n> \"I want to stay in the web development space. I don't want to become an ML\n> engineer.\"\n\nWhile developers are aware of and see potential value in advanced techniques,\nsuch as Retrieve Augment-Generate (RAG) and fine-tuning, you'd rather focus on\nthe web development aspect of their work. Ultimately, you prefer to use the\ndefault tools or rely on other teams to produce optimized models for their use\ncases.\n\nKey Term: Fine-tuning is the process of taking a model, which has already been\ntrained on a large dataset, and further modifying it for a specific purpose or\ndomain.\n\n### Privacy and security concerns\n\nPrivacy and security were the top concerns, especially for verticals with\nstrict data requirements, such as the medical industry. On-device AI may be\nkey to address those use cases, but this area remains largely unexplored.\n\nExposing user data to more third-parties with cloud APIs is a concern, and a\nnumber of developers see the value of on-device machine learning or generative\nAI to mitigate potential privacy and security pitfalls.\n\n## AI for web developers\n\nAI is everywhere and evolving at an incredible pace. How can we stay up to\ndate, incorporate existing tools and models, or work with ML engineers to\nproduce new models that best suit our needs?\n\nBased on what we learned from you, we're working on guidance on AI for web\ndevelopers. We aim to help you understand AI concepts on a high level,\ndiscover opportunities to use generative AI for productivity gains, and use AI\nto build delightful user experiences, using existing tools, models, and APIs.\nContinue to check back in as we publish more content in our AI collection.\n\nWhile most web developers prefer to keep their focus on doing what they do\nbest (that's web development!), we encourage those of you who want to dive\ndeeper to build the tools, models, and APIs web developers need. We want to\nhear from you and learn how we can help you be successful.\n\nAI is a fast-moving area. So, we'll continue engaging with the community as\nthings change, running more conversations and surveys. If you'd like to\ndiscuss with us, schedule office hours with our team.\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under\nthe Apache 2.0 License.
