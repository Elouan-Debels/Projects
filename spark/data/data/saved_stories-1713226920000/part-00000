Author Yang Jisheng is determined to change that with his\nbook, Tombstone\n\nTania Branigan\n\nTue 1 Jan 2013 21.30 CET\n\nShare\n\nSmall and stocky, neat in dress and mild of feature, Yang Jisheng is an\nunassuming figure as he bustles through the pleasantly shabby offices, an old-\nfashioned satchel thrown over one shoulder. Since his retirement from China's\nstate news agency he has worked at the innocuously titled Annals of the Yellow\nEmperor journal, where stacks of documents cover chipped desks and a cockroach\ncircles our paper cups of green tea.\n\nYet the horror stories penned by the 72-year-old from this comforting,\nprofessorial warren in Beijing are so savage and excessive they could almost\nbe taken as the blackest of comedies; the bleakest of farces; the most extreme\nof satires on fanaticism and tyranny.\n\nA decade after the Communist party took power in 1949, promising to serve the\npeople, the greatest manmade disaster in history stalks an already\nimpoverished land. In an unremarkable city in central Henan province, more\nthan a million people \u2013 one in eight \u2013 are wiped out by starvation and\nbrutality over three short years. In one area, officials commandeer more grain\nthan the farmers have actually grown. In barely nine months, more than 12,000\npeople \u2013 a third of the inhabitants \u2013 die in a single commune; a tenth of its\nhouseholds are wiped out. Thirteen children beg officials for food and are\ndragged deep into the mountains, where they die from exposure and starvation.\nA teenage orphan kills and eats her four-year-old brother. Forty-four of a\nvillage's 45 inhabitants die; the last remaining resident, a woman in her 60s,\ngoes insane. Others are tortured, beaten or buried alive for declaring\nrealistic harvests, refusing to hand over what little food they have, stealing\nscraps or simply angering officials.\n\nWhen the head of a production brigade dares to state the obvious \u2013 that there\nis no food \u2013 a leader warns him: \"That's right-deviationist thinking. You're\nviewing the problem in an overly simplistic matter.\"\n\nPage after page \u2013 even in the drastically edited English translation, there\nare 500 of them \u2013 his book, Tombstone, piles improbability upon terrible\nimprobability. But Yang did not imagine these scenes. Perhaps no one could.\nInstead, he devoted 15 years to painstakingly documenting the catastrophe that\nclaimed at least 36 million lives across the country, including that of his\nfather.\n\nThe Great Famine remains a taboo in China, where it is referred to\neuphemistically as the Three Years of Natural Disasters or the Three Years of\nDifficulties. Yang's monumental account, first published in Hong Kong, is\nbanned in his homeland.\n\nHe had little idea of what he would find when he started work: \"I didn't think\nit would be so serious and so brutal and so bloody. I didn't know that there\nwere thousands of cases of cannibalism. I didn't know about farmers who were\nbeaten to death.\n\n\"People died in the family and they didn't bury the person because they could\nstill collect their food rations; they kept the bodies in bed and covered them\nup and the corpses were eaten by mice. People ate corpses and fought for the\nbodies. In Gansu they killed outsiders; people told me strangers passed\nthrough and they killed and ate them. And they ate their own children.\nTerrible. Too terrible.\"\n\nFor a moment he stops speaking.\n\n\"To start with, I felt terribly depressed when I was reading these documents,\"\nhe adds. \"But after a while I became numbed \u2013 because otherwise I couldn't\ncarry on.\"\n\nWhether it is due to this process, or more likely his years working within the\nsystem, Yang is absolutely self-possessed. His grandfatherly smile is\nintermittently clipped by caution as he answers a question. Though a sense of\ndeep anger imbues his book, it is all the more powerful for its restraint.\n\n\"There's something about China that seems to require sharp-elbowed\nintellectuals,\" says Jo Lusby, head of China operations for Penguin, the\npublishers of Tombstone. \"But the people with the loudest voices aren't\nnecessarily the ones with the most interesting things to say. Yang Jisheng\ncomes across as a sweet old man, but he has a core of steel. He has complete\nintegrity.\"\n\nHe is, she points out, part of a generation of quietly committed scholars.\nDespite its apparently quaint title, Annals of the Yellow Emperor is a bold\nliberal journal that has repeatedly tackled sensitive issues. But writing\nTombstone was also a personal mission. Yang was determined to \"erect a\ntombstone for my father\", the other victims and the system that killed them.\n\nThe book opens with Yang's return from school to find his father dying: \"He\ntried to extend his hand to greet me but couldn't lift it ... I was shocked\nwith the realisation that 'skin and bones' referred to something so horrible\nand cruel,\" he writes.\n\nHis village had become a ghost town, with fields dug bare of shoots and trees\nstripped of bark. For all his remorse and grief, he regarded the death as an\nindividual family's tragedy: \"I was 18 at the time and I only knew what the\nCommunist party told me. Everyone was fooled,\" he says. \"I was very red. I was\non a propaganda team and I believed my father's death was a personal\nmisfortune. I never thought it was the government's problem.\"\n\nA manmade disaster ... starving children in Shanghai.

Even as he wrote his paeans to the party, his job began\nto offer glimpses of the truth behind the facade. One day, he was shocked to\noverhear a senior leader in Hubei province say that 300,000 people had died\nthere \u2013 the first hint that his father's death was not an isolated incident.\nIt was, he says, a gradual awakening. He continued to work for Xinhua, a task\nmade easier by the country's reform and opening process and his own evolution;\nby the third decade of his career, he says, \"I had my independent thinking and\nwas telling the truth.\" That was when his work on Tombstone began: \"I just had\na very strong desire to find out the facts. I was cheated and I don't want to\nbe cheated again.\"\n\nParadoxically, it was his work for Xinhua that enabled him to unearth the\ntruth about the famine, as he toured archives on the pretext of a dull project\non state agricultural policies, armed with official letters of introduction.\n\nNumerous people helped him along the way; local officials and other Xinhua\nstaff. Did they realise what he was working on? \"Yes, they knew,\" he says.\n\nOnly once, at the archives of south-western Guizhou, was he almost rumbled.\n\"The people who worked there said: 'We can't just let you in; you need\npermission from the director,'\" Yang recalls. \"The director said: 'I have to\nget permission from the provincial party vice\u2013secretary.' So we drove to see\nthe provincial party vice\u2013secretary. He said: 'I have to ask the party\nsecretary.' The party secretary said: 'I have to ask the central government.'\"\n\nHe pauses. \"If the central government had known, I would have been in a lot of\ntrouble.\" Yang made his excuses and left.\n\nHalf a century on, the government still treats the famine as a natural\ndisaster and denies the true death toll. \"The root problem is the problem of\nthe system. They don't dare to admit the system's problems ... It might\ninfluence the legitimacy of the Communist party,\" Yang says.\n\nThe death toll is staggering. \"The most officials have admitted is 20\nmillion,\" he says, but he puts the total at 36 million. It is \"equivalent to\n450 times the number of people killed by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki\n... and greater than the number of people killed in the first world war,\" he\nwrites. Many think even this is a conservative figure: in his acclaimed book\nMao's Great Famine, Frank Dikotter estimates that the toll reached at least 45\nmillion.\n\nTombstone meticulously demonstrates that the famine was not only vast, but\nmanmade; and not only manmade but political, born of totalitarianism. Mao\nZedong had vowed to build a communist paradise in China through sheer\nrevolutionary zeal, collectivising farmland and creating massive communes at\nastonishing speed. In 1958 he sought to go further, launching the Great Leap\nForward: a plan to modernise the entire Chinese economy so ambitious that it\ntipped over into insanity.\n\nMany believe personal ambition played a crucial role. Not satisfied with being\n\"the most powerful emperor who had ever ruled China\", Mao strove to snatch\nleadership of the international communist movement. If the Soviet Union\nbelieved it could catch up with the US in 15 years, he vowed, China could\novertake Britain in production. His vicious attacks on other leaders who dared\nto voice concern cowed opposition. But, as Yang notes: \"It's a very\ncomplicated historical process, why China believed in Maoism and took this\npath. It wasn't one person's mistake but many people's. It was a process.\"\n\nThe plan proved a disaster from the first. Local officials, either from\nfanaticism or fear, sent grossly exaggerated reports of their success to the\ncentre, proclaiming harvests three or four times their true size. Higher\nauthorities claimed huge amounts of grain for the cities and even dispatched\nit overseas. Cadres harassed or killed those who sought to tell the truth and\ncovered up deaths when reports of problems trickled to the centre.\n\nEven so, work by Yang and others has proved that senior leaders in Beijing\nknew of the famine as early as 1958. \"To distribute resources evenly will only\nruin the Great Leap Forward,\" Mao warned colleagues a year later. \"When there\nis not enough to eat, people starve to death. It is better to let half the\npeople die so that others can eat their fill.\"\n\nRuthlessness ran through the system. In Xinyang, the Henan city at the centre\nof the disaster, those who tried to escape the famine were rounded up; many\ndied of starvation or from brutality in detention centres. Police hunted down\nthose who wrote anonymous letters raising the alarm. Attempts to control the\npopulation tipped over into outright sadism, with cadres torturing victims in\nincreasingly elaborate, ritualistic ways: \"The textbooks don't mention this\npart of history at all,\" says Yang. \"At every festival they have propaganda\nabout the party's achievements and glory and greatness and correctness.\nPeople's ideology has been formed over many years. So right now it's very\nnecessary to write this book; otherwise nobody has this history.\"\n\nThere are signs that at least some in China want to address it. Last year, the\nSouthern People's Weekly dared to publish an issue with the words \"Great\nFamine\" emblazoned starkly across the cover. Inside, an article referred to\nthe calamity as a manmade problem.\n\nYang is convinced that Tombstone will be published on the mainland, maybe\nwithin the decade. He adds with a smile that there are probably 100,000 copies\nalready in circulation, including pirated versions and those smuggled from\nHong Kong: \"There are a lot of things people overseas know first and Chinese\npeople learn from overseas,\" he points out.\n\nBut in other ways the shutters are coming down. Zhou Xun, whose new book, The\nGreat Famine in China, collects original documents on the disaster for the\nfirst time, writes that much of that material has already been made\ninaccessible by archives.\n\n\"Researching it is going to become harder. They are not going to let people\nlook at this stuff any more,\" warns Beijing author and photographer Du Bin,\nwhose forthcoming book, No One In The World Can Defeat Me, juxtaposes accounts\nand images of the horror with the cheery propaganda of the time.\n\nIn China, history cannot be safely contained within a book; it always\nthreatens to spill over: \"Although many years have passed, the Communist party\nis still in charge of the country,\" says Yang. \"They admit it, but they don't\nwant to talk about it; it's still a tragedy under the Communist party's\ngovernance.\"\n\nSome hope that the new generation of leaders taking power may be willing to\nrevisit the country's history and acknowledge the mistakes that have been\nmade. Others think it will be easy for them to continue smoothing over the\npast. \"Because the party has been improving and society has improved and\neverything is better, it's hard for people to believe the brutality of that\ntime,\" Yang notes.\n\nHe recalls meeting a worker from Xinyang who lost two family members to the\nfamine. The man's teenage grandson simply could not believe his recollections,\nand the pair ended up rowing. Yet the power of the truth to reshape China is\nmanifest in its effect on Yang himself: \"I was a very conservative person\ngrowing up with a Communist education. My mind was very simple. Now, my mind\nis liberated. I believe China should move forward to democracy and market\neconomy,\" he says.\n\nHe is, says Lusby, a true patriot; his diligent and risky work is not just for\nhis father and himself, but for his country: \"The Chinese people were cheated.\nThey need real history.\"\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * China\n  * Famine\n  * Communism\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
