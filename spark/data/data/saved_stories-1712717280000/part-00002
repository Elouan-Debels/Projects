One. Whenever Shadowheart\u2019s not in the game, all the other characters\nshould be asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Shadowheart?\u201d\n\nIt's always a huge holiday for me when a turn-based, story-heavy RPG manages\nto break through and be popular with the Normals. This makes lots of new RPG\nfans. Then I can sell my games to them eventually, much as a catfish eats the\nscum at the bottom of a lake.\n\nIt's also a great opportunity to pick apart a good game's design. Find out\nwhat works and what doesn't work and what the state of the art is for RPGs\nright now. If a game sells well, that means every choice it made was correct,\nand you should pick over the carcass for ideas to steal with all speed.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3, by Larian Studios, is a huge, sprawling game. It has a real\n\"No wrong answers\" feel, where just about every idea made it in somewhere. I\nwant to spend a post or three picking apart the game system, pulling out\nspecific structures and ideas, and looking at them in the light.\n\nThis will all be a bit disjointed with lots of small individual topics. But\nit's worth it, because this is a very interesting game.\n\nShadowheart should be louder, angrier, and have access to a time machine.\n\nTaking A Wrench To Dungeons & Dragons\n\nOf course, you can't talk about the gameplay without noticing it's an\nadaptation of Fifth Edition Dungeons & Dragons. (5E for short.)\n\nI've played a ton of 5E over the last few years and find it to be basically\nwell put-together and a lot of fun. I think adapting it to this game was a\nreally smart idea. It teaches people to play D&D, lets experienced D&D players\npretend they're in a campaign, and it gave Larian a game design to work with\nthat is already polished, functional, and pretty fun.\n\nSome people are going to yell at me for saying that. Certain people get really\nsnooty and picky, and religious about tabletop role-playing game systems. And\nhating on D&D is very much the fashion of late.\n\nHowever, like it or not, D&D is still the dominant role-playing game brand.\nIt\u2019s perfectly adequate. Aggressively perfectly adequate. Most people who play\nit would be surprised to find that anyone hates it (or that other RPGs exist\nat all).\n\nAnother game decided to use an existing game is Solasta: Crown of the\nMagister. It is basically 5E D&D, but an indie game, and it's a lot of fun and\na big success. And, of course, there are the Pathfinder games.\n\nConsider the possibility that making your own RPG system from scratch is a\nroute for suckers. I mean, I'm going to keep doing it because it's fun and\nlets me shape the system to work better with the plot. But I still might be a\nsucker.\n\nPotential results of drawing from the Deck of Many Things, the unquestionable\nbest design in Dungeons & Dragons. Modern designers are biologically incapable\nof putting something this awesome in a game.\n\nGetting To Rewrite D&D\n\nThe designers of Baldur's Gate 3 got a rare and precious opportunity, one to\nbe much envied by generations of gaming nerds. They got to rewrite Dungeons &\nDragons. (A full list of changes is here.)\n\nImagine that. Getting to take a wrench to any rules that are fiddly and\nannoying, and, if anyone complains, say, \"Well, we had to do it to make a\nvideo game. LOL. Shrug emoji.\" It enabled them to slash a lot of stuff that\nwas fine to lose but the tabletop designers would never give up willingly.\n\n(Of course, I' don\u2019t know anyone personally who works on BG3 or D&D. I\u2019m just\nimagining the scenario that amuses me the most.)\n\nAs much as I enjoy it, 5E has a serious case of Modern Tightass Designer\nSyndrome. MTDS is when the designers are paralyzed with fear of their players\nhaving too much freedom. Or fun.\n\nMTDS is when you balance and rebalance and add rule after rule to prevent\nunpredictability or eccentricity. The terminal case of this is World of\nWarcraft, where the power of all the artifacts you are questing for has\nbasically been reduced to a single number.\n\nThe only thing that gives 5E any wild, anarchic energy is the need to keep\ndesign elements from ancient Dungeons & Dragons, 1980s energy, back when\neverything was overpowered and weird and we liked it that way.\n\nOne of the things I love about Larian is that their games never have MTDS. The\nspells you got in the Divinity: Original Sin games got stupidly overpowered\nand broken, which made them awesome.\n\nfrodo is OP nerf plz\n\nA Good Example of MTDS\n\nThe main goal of D&D, of course, is to get lots of powerful magical artifacts\nso that your character is a badass and can trash bozos.\n\nBut too many magic items leads to power and unpredictability, and we can not\nhave that. Because MTDS.\n\nSo current Dungeons & Dragons has something called \"Attunement.\" Long story\nshort, your character can only ever own three good magic items.\n\nI linked to the attunement rules. They are delightfully overlong,\noverdetailed, and deranged, and I suggest you savor them.\n\nTo attune a magic item so that you can use it, you have to rest with it for\nhours. You have to sleep with your Helm of Radiance. Cuddle with it. Smooch\nit. Whisper sweet nothings to where its ear would be. Give it little tickles.\nI admit it is hilarious.\n\nHow To Romance Your Magic Item\n\nI have sat at a table and tried to explain to people, actual friends and human\nbeings, the attunement rule. \"I just got an awesome item!\" \"You can't use it.\"\n\"What!?\" \"Well, you can but you have to get rid of another awesome item.\" \"But\nI LIKE my other awesome item.\" \"That is how D&D works.\" \"That is stupid!\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\n(\u201cBUt You CAN MAkE Up yOur OWn hoUsE ruleS!\u201d Dude, these books aren\u2019t cheap.\nDon\u2019t make me design your stupid game for you.)\n\nOf course, D&D is based in part on Lord of the Rings, so there is a precedent\nin place. Remember when Galadrial gave Frodo the Phial of Light but he had to\nget rid of it because he had a magic sword AND magic armor AND a magic ring?\nYeah, me neither.\n\nBut implementing attunement in a computer game would be a confusing pain in\nthe butt. So BG3 got rid of it. And guess what? THIS DOES NO HARM TO THE GAME\nWHATSOEVER.\n\nSpeaking of rules simplification, there\u2019s no need for all those wizard spells.\nWizards only need one spell.\n\nA Lot Of Rules Constipation Was Cleared Away\n\nBG3 trims away so much rules junk. They completely rewrote how short rests\nwork, making them far simpler. They got rid of grappling, because grappling\nhas always been stupid. Readying actions? GONE! Strength requirements for\narmor? GONE! The bizarre inability to cast multiple spells when hasted? GONE!\nExhaustion. GONE. The cover system? GONE! (OK, as a lifelong wargamer, that\nlast one hurts.)\n\nAgain ... Confusing, time-wasting grappling rules are gone. Ahhhh. When you\nsay it enough times, it sounds like singing.\n\nI didn't miss ANY of it. Except maybe... I really think there should be a\ncover system, but I played a whole 80 hour game without noticing they'd taken\nit out, so [shrug emoji].\n\nI'm sure everyone at Wizards of the Coast who works on Actual D&D has played\nBG3 two times, which is good. I hope they take any rule change as a potential\nsuggestion. There are a lot of changes that simplify things without costing\nfun or add interesting choices without overly increasing complexity. The only\nrisk is that the players of your fantasy stabby game might actually feel\npowerful for a while.\n\nShould all of the changes be kept? No, of course not. But it might be good to\nsacrifice a few sacred cows if I never have to explain to confused newbies any\nof the nonsense they chopped out again.\n\nMy first D&D rulebook had 48 pages for the WHOLE GAME. If you cut 3 or 4 pages\nout, you\u2019d have the perfect length for the rules to D&D.\n\nBut It Won't Happen\n\nIt's very easy for a designer to get into a mindset where you don't want to\nlet your players have too easy a time. Sometimes, when I'm writing a game, I\nstart acting like a hardass and tacking on difficulty. But I've learned to,\njust before release, take a quick pass through all the bosses and make each\none a little easier. A little sacrifice to the small gods of power fantasy.\n\nThe hardass mindset leads to too many rules. Just as writing is almost always\nimproved by editing it down, just about any game system can be improved by\nchopping out a few rules. As the old writer's advice goes, \"Kill your\ndarlings.\"\n\nSo there. A bunch of rambling about D&D, adaptations, rules, and complexity. A\nlot more about Baldur's Gate 3 will come over the next few weeks.\n\nOur newest indie role-playing epic, Geneforge 2 - Infestation, is now out!\nIt\u2019s cheap and fun.\n\nSpiderweb Software makes fun role-playing games and also has a mailing list\nand a Twitter and a Facebook if you want to learn when we do something big.\nExtra thanks to people who actually pay for this Substack. It gets me off my\nfigurative butt and keeps me writing.\n\n3 Likes\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Picking Apart Baldur's Gate 3, Part 2 (Talkin' 'Bout D&D)\n\nbottomfeeder.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThere Are Too Many Video Games\n\nLet's marinate in some hard truths.
