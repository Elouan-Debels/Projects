Although this particular stretch of beach was\nconsidered a likely target for enemy landing parties, the young Seaman was the\nsole line of defense on that foggy night; and his only weapon, a trusty\nflashlight, was proving ineffective against the smothering haze. As Cullen\napproached a dune on the beach, the shape of a man suddenly appeared before\nhim. Momentarily startled, he called out for the shape to identify itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fishermen from Southampton,\u201d a voice responded. A middle-aged man\nemerged from the soupy fog, and continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve run ashore.\u201d This sounded\nplausible to Cullen, so he invited the fisherman and his crew to stay the\nnight at the nearby Coast Guard station. The offer appeared to agitate the\nman, and he refused. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a fishing license,\u201d he explained.\n\nJust as Cullen\u2019s suspicions began to grow, a second figure appeared over the\ndune and shouted something in German. The man in front of Cullen spun around,\nyelling, \u201cYou damn fool! Go back to the others!\u201d Then he turned back to Cullen\nwith an intensity in his expression that left the Seaman paralyzed\u2014for he was\nnow almost certain that he was alone on the beach with a party of Nazi spies.\n\nThe German agent stood close, and hissed, \u201cDo you have a mother? A father?\u201d As\nCullen nodded, he continued, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want to have to kill you.\u201d He\nheld out a wad of cash. \u201cForget about this, take this money, and go have a\ngood time.\u201d Cullen, realizing this might be his only chance to walk away\nalive, decided to accept. As he reached for the roll of bills, the man\nsuddenly lunged forward and seized Cullen\u2019s flashlight. He then pointed the\nlight toward his own face. \u201cDo you know me?\u201d he asked.\n\nSeaman second class John C. Cullen\n\n\u201cNo sir, I never saw you before in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is George John Davis. Take a good look at me. You\u2019ll be meeting me in\nEast Hampton sometime.\u201d With that, he released his grip on the flashlight and\nthe money, and disappeared back into the fog. The shocked coastguardsman took\na few hesitant paces backward, then whirled around and set off at a run for\nthe Coast Guard station to inform his superiors that their fears had been\nrealized.\n\nCullen\u2019s suspicion was correct, but the man he\u2019d confronted was no hardened\nmilitary commander. His real name was George John Dasch, a waiter and\ndishwasher who\u2019d come to the attention of the German High Command for the time\nhe\u2019d spent living in America before the war. He and a team of three similarly\ninexperienced agents had been given several weeks of intense training at a\nsecret farm near Berlin before being ushered onto a U-boat bound for the US\ncoast. Their mission, led by Dasch, was to sabotage America\u2019s manufacturing\nand transport sector, and to terrorize the country\u2019s civilian population. It\nwould be known as Operation Pastorius.\n\nThe evening\u2019s events had already damaged Dasch\u2019s tenuous hold on the group.\nUnbeknownst to Seaman John Cullen, two armed sailors had been crouched in the\ndarkness during the conversation on the beach, awaiting the signal to attack.\nThe landing party had been left with standing orders to kill anyone who\nconfronted them during the landing. But Dasch had chosen to let the man go,\nand his assurances that he had \u201cbuffaloed\u201d the coastguardsman did not convince\nhis men. After some nervous arguing back and forth, the saboteurs finished\nburying their supplies in the sand, and set out for the nearby Long Island\nRailroad Station.\n\nIn the meantime, John Cullen reached the Coast Guard post and breathlessly\nrecited what he\u2019d seen, handing over the bribe money as evidence. Though\nskeptical, and concerned about raising a false alarm, his superiors agreed to\nsend out an armed patrol to investigate. They were led back to the site by\nCullen, where any doubts were quickly dispelled; in the pre-dawn light, the\nmen could see the outline of a German submarine dislodging itself from a\nsandbar just offshore. Once it had gone, a quick search of the area revealed a\nseries of small crates buried under a shallow layer of sand. Inside were large\nquantities of explosives, detonation equipment, Nazi uniforms, and quality\nGerman liquor.\n\nOnce the news reached FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover around noon, his excitement\ncould hardly be contained. As Attorney General Francis Biddle later recalled,\n\u201cAll of Edgar Hoover\u2019s imaginative and restless energy was stirred into prompt\nand effective action. He was determined to catch them all before any sabotage\ntook place.\u201d\n\nCoast Guard Station at Amagansett, New York\n\nHere at last was a chance for Hoover to prove his organization\u2019s value to the\nwar effort. But the situation was delicate; making the story public would put\nevery American citizen on the lookout for the Germans, but it would also alert\nthe suspects to the hunt and might cause public hysteria\u2014not to mention\nconsiderable embarrassment for Hoover and his Bureau if the search should\nfail. It was therefore decided that a media blackout be imposed. Quietly, with\nonly the most professional degree of panic, the FBI began the largest manhunt\nin its history.\n\nBy this time, the four would-be terrorists were settled in New York City,\npreparing for their task from the comfort of fancy hotels and fine\nrestaurants. They had $84,000 in mission funds to enjoy\u2014equivalent to over $1\nmillion today\u2014and in the great melting pot of New York City their German\naccents raised nary an eyebrow. They remained completely unaware that their\nessential supplies had already been confiscated and that the entire might of\nthe FBI was secretly on the lookout for them.\n\nBut George John Dasch, the group\u2019s daring leader, had a secret of his own. The\nday after the landing he called Ernst Peter Burger, the most guarded and\ndisciplined member of the team, into the upper-storey hotel room the two men\nshared. He walked over to the window and opened it wide.\n\n\u201cYou and I are going to have a talk,\u201d Dasch said, \u201cAnd if we disagree, only\none of us will walk out that door\u2014the other will fly out this window.\u201d\n\nHe then revealed the truth to Burger: he had no intention of going through\nwith the mission. He hated the Nazis, and he wanted Burger on his side when he\nturned the entire plot over to the FBI. Burger smiled. Having spent seventeen\nmonths in a Nazi concentration camp, his own feelings for the party were less\nthan warm. He, too had been planning to betray the mission. They were agreed.\n\nThe two men were uncertain how best to proceed with their plan. They were\nreluctant to contact the authorities, having been told by their handlers that\nthe Nazis had infiltrated the FBI. Eventually, Dasch concluded that their best\noption was an anonymous phone call to test the waters and arrange for further\ncontact. He called the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office, and after several\ntransfers was put in touch with a special agent. Identifying himself as\n\u201cPastorius,\u201d the name of the mission, Dasch carefully recited his story. Then,\nominously, the man on the other end of the line hung up. Dasch was stricken\nwith panic. Had he just exposed himself to a Nazi spy? Had the call been\ntraced?\n\nGeorge John Dasch (left) and Ernst Peter Burger (right)\n\nIn fact, he had been speaking to the office\u2019s \u201cnut desk,\u201d the post responsible\nfor fielding calls from Cleopatra and the wolf-man. In the midst of the most\nimportant case in the Bureau\u2019s history, the agent on duty had dismissed their\nonly lead as a prank.\n\nShaken but not discouraged, Dasch ordered Burger to stay put and keep an eye\non the other men while he headed for Washington D.C. to set things straight.\nThe morning of June 19, a week after his landing at Long Island, Dasch stepped\ninto the FBI\u2019s headquarters carrying a briefcase. He explained who he was and\nasked to speak with Director Hoover.\n\nThe agents in the building, however, were too busy catching spies to be\nbothered with every crackpot off the street who happened to know classified\ndetails about secret Nazi landings. Dasch was bounced from office to office\nuntil finally Assistant Director D.M. Ladd, the agent in charge of the\nmanhunt, agreed to humor him with five minutes of his time. Dasch angrily\nrepeated his story, only to find himself greeted once again with patronizing\nnods and glances toward the door. Fed up at last, he lifted the briefcase he\nhad been carrying, tore open its straps, and dumped the entire $84,000 of\nmission funds onto the Assistant Director\u2019s desk. Ladd blinked with\nastonishment and began to reconsider Dasch\u2019s claims.\n\nFor the next week, Dasch was the subject of an intense interrogation, and he\nhappily revealed all he knew. His operation, he explained, was just the first\nof a long series of sabotage missions planned by the Germans to cripple the\nAmerican war effort. They were scheduled to land every six weeks, with the\nsecond team expected imminently. Dasch exposed the targets he had been\ninstructed to hit as well as the methods he had been trained to use. He\nrevealed key information about German war production, plans, and equipment. He\nturned over a handkerchief upon which the names of local contacts had been\nwritten in invisible ink\u2014although Dasch, who had snoozed his way through spy\nschool, couldn\u2019t remember how to reveal it. Most important of all, Dasch\ndisclosed the locations of his three accomplices and their aliases, taking\ncare to note Burger\u2019s role in the defection.\n\nThe three men who had landed with Dasch were quickly located using the\ninformation he\u2019d supplied. Dasch knew little about the second four-man team,\nbut with the help of his handkerchief contacts\u2014which the FBI\u2019s lab quickly\ndiscovered could be revealed by ammonia fumes\u2014they were soon tracked down and\narrested. Just two weeks after the first landing, and without a single attempt\nat sabotage, all eight men were in custody.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover\n\nHoover broke the media blackout on the evening of June 27. Across the nation,\nAmerican citizens were astonished to wake up to front-page headlines declaring\n\u201cU-BOATS LAND SPIES; EIGHT SIEZED BY FBI.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t the story known to\nthose on the inside. Hoover reasoned that letting the truth be known now would\ndo nothing to discourage the Germans from making further sabotage attempts. It\nwas better to perpetuate the myth of an invincible FBI that had halted the\nplot through its own ingenuity and all-seeing eye\u2014a story that also happened\nto fit nicely into Hoover\u2019s personal agenda.\n\nAt his press conference, Hoover therefore made no mention of the defection of\nDasch, or indeed of any details on how the case was broken. He opted instead\nto praise the brilliance and efficiency of his FBI. \u201cThe detective work of the\ncentury,\u201d Hoover called it, referring perhaps to agent Ladd\u2019s astute\nobservation of $84,000 cash bouncing off of his forehead. Further details, he\nexplained, would have to wait until after the war. The unsatisfied press room\nerupted with speculations about elite FBI agents infiltrating the Gestapo and\nthe High Command. Hoover refused to confirm any such wild theories, but his\ntriple-eyebrow raises, exaggerated winks, and menacing cackles encouraged the\nreporters to adopt their own conclusions.\n\nWith the last of his accomplices rounded up, it was time at last for Dasch to\nget his due. On July 3, his contacts at the FBI greeted him with smiles and\nhandcuffs, and tossed him into a cell alongside his men. It was not the\nresponse Dasch had been expecting, but the arresting agents assured him it was\nlittle more than a formality. If he just went along with it, he was told, J.\nEdgar Hoover would ensure that he received a presidential pardon within 6\nmonths.\n\nHoover had indeed already spoken to President Roosevelt about the arrest, but\nhis conversation had nothing to do with advocating Dasch\u2019s release. The\npresident was given an account similar to the one furnished to the press, with\nno mention of Dasch or Burger\u2019s role in the investigation. According to\nHoover, Dasch had been \u201capprehended\u201d two days after his accomplices; and the\narrest had been made in New York, not Washington, implying that the arrest of\nthe subordinates had led to the capture of their leader rather than the other\nway around. Hoover\u2019s revisions to the story may have had something to do with\nthe river of letters and telegrams later received by the president urging him\nto award the FBI Director with the Congressional Medal of Honor. As it turned\nout, the majority of these messages came from the FBI\u2019s own Crime Records\nDivision, the office just a few doors down from Hoover\u2019s. The campaign,\nhowever, was unsuccessful.\n\nExplosive supplies recovered from the landing beach\n\nWhether Operation Pastorius\u2019s slapdash team of blue-collar workers and\ngovernment pencil-pushers ever posed much of a threat is somewhat debatable.\nAt the time of their capture, most of the saboteurs were too busy visiting\ngambling establishments and prostitutes to be planning any major acts of\nsabotage. Several were reuniting with family they\u2019d left behind in America,\nwhile another had met up with an old girlfriend and was in the process of\nplanning his wedding. The German High Command had perhaps misjudged the wisdom\nof sending naturalized citizens to attack their own adopted country.\nNevertheless, the only concern of the US government was in reassuring its\ncitizens and sending a powerful message to the Nazis. Since the men hadn\u2019t\nactually committed any crime, a normal court could sentence them to at most a\nfew years in prison\u2014or even acquit them entirely. To President Roosevelt, this\nwas unacceptable. In a memorandum sent to Attorney General Biddle, he wrote:\n\u201cSurely they are as guilty as it is possible to be and it seems to me that the\ndeath penalty is almost obligatory.\u201d A military tribunal, he felt, was the\nonly way to ensure this outcome. \u201cI won\u2019t give them up,\u201d he told Biddle, \u201cI\nwon\u2019t hand them over to any United States marshal armed with a writ of habeas\ncorpus.\u201d\n\nHe would find no objections among the American populace. As shown in polls and\neditorials across the country, the general public was overwhelmingly in favor\nof execution for all eight terrorists. A letter printed in one newspaper\ncalled for the men to be fed to Gargantua, the Ringling Brothers\u2019 famous giant\ncircus gorilla.\n\nWithin a month of the initial landing at Long Island, the eight saboteurs were\nput before a closed-door US military tribunal\u2014the first to be assembled since\nthe days of the Civil War. It was presided over by a panel of seven generals;\nthere would be no jury, no press, and no appeal. During the trial, none of the\ndefendants denied their involvement with the plot, instead claiming that they\nwere forced into the mission by the Nazis, or that they had joined as a means\nto escape from Germany. Due to his unique circumstances, Dasch was defended\nseparately. His counsel argued competently in his favor, noting that the case\nwould never have been broken without him, that the FBI had promised him his\nfreedom, and that he clearly had been planning to betray the mission from the\nstart. Not only had he disobeyed orders by sparing coastguardsman Cullen, he\nhad also deliberately revealed his face and assigned name\u2014George John Davis\u2014to\nthe man.\n\nExplosive delay devices disguised as pens, submitted as evidence\n\nAfter 16 days in session and two rejected constitutional appeals from the\ndefense, both sides had said their piece. A verdict was signed and sent\ndirectly to the president, who was to be the final arbiter of the sentencing.\nIt was unanimous: the Germans, all eight of them, were guilty. The recommended\nsentence was death.\n\nIt was only upon reading the transcript of the trial that Roosevelt learned\nhow Hoover had misled him. Regardless, it apparently didn\u2019t shake the\nfoundation of his opinion on the case. At the urging of defense counsel, FDR\ngave only enough ground to commute Dasch\u2019s sentence to 30 years of hard labor,\nand Burger\u2019s to life. George John Dasch, a man who had envisioned himself\nbeing welcomed as a hero by the American people and perhaps earning his own\nMedal of Honor, would instead spend what was likely to be the rest of his life\nin prison. His six accomplices were not so fortunate. Five days after the\ntrial\u2019s end, they were marched to the electric chair in alphabetical order.\nWithin two months of landing in America, the men had been captured, charged,\ntried, and executed. The official verdict of the tribunal wouldn\u2019t be released\nfor another three months.\n\nDasch and Burger were locked away in a federal penitentiary, their true story\nonly known to a handful of military and government officials. But as ethically\nsuspect as J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s deception may have been, his cover-up worked.\nHitler was infuriated at the news of his men\u2019s capture, and he refused to risk\nanother submarine for further missions. Just as he had intended, Hoover\neffectively stopped any attempts at German sabotage for the remainder of the\nwar.\n\nBurger and Dasch\u2019s stories didn\u2019t end in prison. After the Allied victory in\nEurope, the documents pertaining to their case were released to the public\ndespite the strenuous objections of J. Edgar Hoover. With the truth out in the\nopen, and after a further three years of squirming, President Harry S. Truman\nfinally agreed to commute the two men\u2019s sentences. Having spent six years in\nfederal prison, they were released and deported to Germany.\n\nThe Nazi saboteurs in court\n\nThe consequences of the 1942 Nazi sabotage plot remain very much present\ntoday. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the\nUnited States government approved the use of military tribunals to try\ncaptured terrorist suspects. The major precedent for these tribunals is the\ncase of Ex parte Quirin\u2014the trial of George John Dasch and his seven Nazi\nagents. Their hastily assembled tribunal will also be looked to as the model\nfor any future prosecution of \u201cunlawful combatants.\u201d\n\nStepping off the plane onto German soil, Dasch and Burger found themselves two\nmen without a home: criminals in America and traitors in Germany. Burger\nturned against his former commander, publicly blaming him for the entire\ndebacle before disappearing several years later. For his part, Dasch refused\nto run; he spent the rest of his life campaigning for acceptance in Germany\nand for a chance to return to America. He never received either. Dasch died in\nGermany in 1992, still awaiting the pardon promised him by J. Edgar Hoover\nhalf a century earlier.\n\n\u00a9 2008 All Rights Reserved.

To think they got that kind of treatment for their\nselfless sacrifice. Hardly for America, but defiitly not for Heir Hitler,\nwhich was important, and we treated them like dogs. Ouch.\n\ntreflar\n\nPosted 20 April 2008 at 10:45 pm\n\nThere\u2019s an old spy novel called the \u201cninth man\u201d it built on this, but added an\nuber commando with his own secret mission. I would recommend it.\n\nsupercalafragalistic\n\nPosted 20 April 2008 at 11:35 pm\n\nThat Hoover character sure had his priorities set on himself. However, he did\nget the results that were important. What if the Germans bombed us? That could\nhave changed the course of history. I don\u2019t know, maybe today\u2019s Americans are\ntoo uptight about the right and wrong of situations?? Perhaps it\u2019s the\nchanging views of subsequent generations as we put our own spin on what\nhappened back then, and also as we get more distance from the time period-\nviews change about the historical events. With all the killing going on in\nGermany and both World Wars, my guess is that during those times, two people\nneedlessly getting sent to an electric chair was a small price to pay to keep\nthe Germans out of the US. And, even if now we look back and say how barbaric\nand horrible is America, our country was by far better than the Germans we\nwere fighting at the time.\n\nThese days there are different things going on. These days we have different\nlenses with which to look through and interpret this story. We have the lens\nof the death penalty and the arguments over that in contemporary society where\npeople on death row were proven innocent with DNA evidence. Things like that\ncan color how we view this story. We\u2019ve also been pretty darned unhappy with\nthe current administration as a whole and that can really color how we view\nthis story also.\n\nHowever, my thought is that during the timeframe of the arrest of these\npeople, America was young, great, and nothing had beaten us down or\ndisappointed us. Given the circumstances and the thinking of the times, I get\nwhy things unfolded as they did.\n\nToday\u2019s tabloidization of the media is horrible. If something like this were\nto happen today the media would descend all over this and could theaten\nnational security in the process.\n\ncinndave\n\nPosted 21 April 2008 at 12:42 am\n\nHot Damn! This article turned out to be a lot more interesting than I\nexpected. I thought it was going to be another spy thriller like that\nConfederate story earlier. Lot to it.\n\nI never knew anything or any one had landed on the east shore. I would have\nexpected them to keep it a complete secret to keep the public from becoming\nafraid of more infiltrators. I know that they aggressively covered up the\nJapanese balloon bombings in Oregon because they didn\u2019t want the public to be\nscared about the Japs successfully attacking the homeland.\n\nWhat an infuriating ending. This story ruined my mood. What a horrible\ninjustice. We really need to abolish the death penalty.\n\nFixitDave\n\nPosted 21 April 2008 at 02:33 am\n\nGreat story, well written and typical government...it aint just America that\ndoes this, sadly they all do it.\n\nSoxSweepAgain\n\nPosted 21 April 2008 at 02:39 am\n\nThat just sucks. There\u2019s no better word to convey connotation.\n\n\u201cSucks\u201d.\n\nMirage_GSM\n\nPosted 21 April 2008 at 04:10 am\n\n> cinndave said: \u201cWhat an infuriating ending. This story ruined my mood. What\n> a horrible injustice. We really need to abolish the death penalty.\u201d\n\nWell, the time was war, and the death penalty was what awaited about anyone\nwho was caught spying in any country. Thus it is not so much the fate of those\nsix other saboteurs that is surprising, though it is certainly excessive by\ntoday\u2019s standards. However that they locked up the other two \u2013 even after the\nwar \u2013 was not a matter of national security but of personal pride! Germany\nstopped being a serious threat to mainland america less than two years after\nthe sentence. Putting those two under house arrest until then would have\nsufficed even the most paranoid scenario.\n\nmustamike\n\nPosted 21 April 2008 at 04:13 am\n\nDamn sad and interesting.\n\nmonkforhire\n\nPosted 21 April 2008 at 04:27 am\n\nIt seems things never change, really. And I\u2019m amazed at supercalafragalistic\ndefending it.

It was basically a primitive e-mail\nand FTP network.\n\nLeonard Kleinrock of MIT (USA) created the core of networking when he\npublished a paper in 1961 detailing packet switching theory. Packets are the\ninformation that is sent between computers allowing information exchange.\n\nWhen TCP/IP was developed, the term \u201cInternet\u201d was used to detail a worldwide\nnetwork with the publication of RFC 674 in 1974 written by three Standord\nUniversity students. Based on this paper, protocols were developed to allow\nintegration of TCP/IP so that it was system friendly no matter what type of\noperating system or hardware configuration.\n\nThis early network developed and when it proved its worth, the British Post\nOffice, Telenet, Datapac, and Transpac joined forces to create IPSS in 1978.\nAt this time the US Defense department was using a worldwide network\ncommunicating between its various bases located around the globe.\n\nBy now various user groups, corporations, and commercial groups were wired in\nusing this global network. It was in 1989 when Tim Berners Lee and Robert\nCailliau (England) thought about using the existing Internet as an\ninformational gateway that could be more dynamic and easily available to the\ncommon man. They created the first web browser and coined the phrase\nWorldwideweb (original syntax). Tim Berners Lee also invented both the HTML\nmarkup language and the HTTP protocol used to request and transmit web pages.\nSo the Internet was invented in the USA while the World Wide Web (which helped\ntame and organize the mass of information available on the Internet) was\ninvented in England.\n\nThe Don\n\n1c3d0g\n\nPosted 21 April 2008 at 03:52 pm\n\nWow...that is such a sad story.

Six and a half years on, the\nrest of the world is still expected to stare agog at what happened in New York\nthat day. We all live in countries where terrorist attacks and mass human\ncasualties are woven into the fabric of our history. If you were then to\nequate the loss of life that has occurred as a direct result of those events\nand the impact it has had on world politics, do you think the reaction from\nthe US Government is justified?

The Founders\nknew that you can have maximum Liberty or maximum Security and that the two,\nat their extremes, are mutually exclusive, and at best are difficult to\nreconcile and balance. I do not hate this country.

The\nprice of Freedom is, indeed, blood, sweat and tears. We have not always lived\nup to the ideals embodied in the Constitution, but we can and must continue to\nstrive for them.

One can never fully be sure unless you research both sides of an issue\nthen make a judgment. Basing your opinion on 1\u20442 the story... well, its just\nasinine. You have to realize that Hawaii was infiltrated by Japanese spies,\nsome that had lived there for years before being approached and ask to spy.\nWar operates under its own rules. Can you really trust that these people were\nbeing fully truthful? How about that US couple that were spying for the USSR?\nTheir neighbors, even friends were totally shocked. They didn\u2019t know.\n\nI must point out that many German prisoners that were interred in the USA\nduring the war actually faired better than those in other countries. I\u2019m not\npositive on this one, but I think those kept in England were also treated\nbetter than other countries.\n\nMany of the German POW camps were located in the West, away from major\nindustries. I know of several located in the state I live in now. Some of the\nPOWs retuned after going home to live here. I personally know of one Austrian\ncouple where the husband was captured in Africa and sent here. He spent almost\nthree years as a POW in America. After the war, he returned to Austria, found\nhis wife, then returned here and started a business.\n\nWhenever he talks about the Nazis he becomes angry. He talks about the anti-\nAmerican propaganda he was fed. How much hatred he felt about the half-breeds\nliving in poverty in America waiting to spill out into other countries\npolluting them with their ill-conceived ways and inferior children.\n\nHe started to doubt what he was taught when he saw not ill-formed half-breeds\nin New York, but people like himself, smartly dressed and polite. As the train\ntook him and other POWs across US soil, he was amazed at the wealth this\ncountry actually had, not to mention the size. Amazed at how many Americans\nowned and drove personal vehicles. America was huge, were he and his\ncountrymen crazy enough to believe that they could really concur America. In\ncase you did not know, Hitler had plans to invade before the USA even\nconsidered entering the war. Europe was not his only goal.\n\nOnce in camp, he learned not to fear the US guards but the Nazi interred\nthere. Of the Germans and Austrians it was the Nazis that were the most\ndangerous. The American guards were very friendly and would share a smoke,\neven chocolate if asked. But one had to be careful least the Nazis considered\nyou an enemy collaborator (more than one supposed POW turncoat had committed\nsuicide with convenient, well written notes left behind before the die-hard\nnazis were finally rounded up and shipped elsewhere). The camp guards rarely\nasked what the POWs knew about Germany and the Nazi\u2019s plans. That had been\ndone back in Africa, then New York.\n\nThe best part of the interment was when they asked if any of the prisoners\nwanted work duty. This meant leaving the prison and working at local farms or\ndoing roadwork. Planting, harvesting, repairing roofs, painting... this gave\nthe men something to do. At first many considered trying to run, but before\nlong they were convinced that this was not that bad, especially since they\nwere also being paid for their labors. Though they did not receive cash\noutright, they had a form of banking account that they could draw on to\npurchase things. The money was also given to them with interest after the war.\nOne enterprising German purchased a crud printing press and published a small\npaper. The camp supplied the paper for free and he made his ink from charcoal\nand local clay. One of the guards, a Native American, taught him how to create\nink this way. He even supplied different color clays so that the paper could\nhave colored sections. It contained camp news, New York Stock information,\nAmerican comics, and general news about the war effort in Africa and Europe.\nHe sold it for five cents a copy. Even the American guards purchased his\n\u201cEnglish\u201d version of the paper.\n\nThe food they received was good and plentiful. Many had never eaten as good\nsince the war began back in Europe. Some of the men gained so much weight that\nthey burst the back of their trousers. They repaired their clothes using old\nUS soldiers uniforms or by purchasing marked clothing from the prison store.\nMany received Medical and Dental of which they could only dream of back in\nEurope. They also had cinema Friday and Saturday nights. This usually was a\nnewsreel, then a cartoon, finally the main feature. He said the best ones were\nwhen the cartoon was replaced by a comedy; Abbot and Costello were a favorite.\n\nThe news about Germany was always welcomed, but many became discouraged when\nthey realized she was losing the war. Once a prisoner was interred from the\nWestern Front, his stories of the horror of the Cossack changed many of the\ndie-hards about the Americans. More and more of the prisoners thanked God in\ntheir prayers that they had been captured by American Soldiers and sent here.\n\nHe also told me that when he returned to Austria, other POWs that had been\nkept in Europe shared their stories. Of the hardships and torture many German\nPOWs had witnessed in Poland, France, Brussels, Italy... The inhumane\nconditions and high mortality rate whispered about USSR camps, though no one\nknew of anyone who had either escaped or been released from one. Tails of POW\ncamps with no shelter and simple slit trenches with logs for toilets.\nBeatings, torture, no medical, rotten or no food at all. It was these things\nthat changed his mind about America. It was these things that caused him to\nleave his beloved Austria and seek citizenship in America.\n\nSo if America was so hard on POWs, why did some return with their families and\nbecome American citizens? Many of the old German soldiers who moved here after\nthe war have died so I cannot ask their reasons. But the ones I have inquired\ntold me it was because how there were treated by the American soldiers and\ncitizens. Guess that not all of America is bad, as many believe, unless you\nenjoy the verbal crap of anti-American vocalizations. Best to base one\u2019s\nopinion on actually visiting America for a month or so, and not just one area.\n\nBut then again that\u2019s my opinion, and I have traveled to other countries.\nWhich is why I think people are good in general, it is really too bad that the\nhigh profile ones, or evil ones that the media loves to focus on, gives people\nand their country such a bad reputation.\n\nSorry for the long post \u2013 The Don wheezes \u2013 well my lung hurts so need to quit\nfor now.\n\nThe Don\n\nJack Olson\n\nPosted 22 April 2008 at 12:10 pm\n\n> Would you be proud to live in a country where your government has the\n> \u201clegal\u201d right to indefinitely detain citizens without charge, or bring those\n> citizens before a tribunal for a \u201ctrial\u201d where they are not allowed to even\n> see, let alone refute, the evidence against them, or where all your\n> communications are subject to surveillance, all in the name of national\n> security?\n\nIf you did live in such a country, you would be living in the United States\nunder Abraham Lincoln, and yes, I would be proud to do so.

For that matter, I\u2019m not too keen on people who murder strangers with\nsuicide belts and car bombs. If anything, I want to know how government can\nstop such heinous conduct. But, what if their way of stopping it involves\narresting people and holding them without trial, or tapping their phone\nwithout warrants?

First post for me on this site, so I guess I\u2019ll go ahead and\nsay \u2018First!\u2019. Boy that was fulfilling! We are all responsible for war; as a\nhuman race we haven\u2019t been able to look past culture, race and religion.\nSurvival of the fittest is the law of nature, and I guess we should all be\nthankful to have made it this far. While most of us want peace and better\nunderstanding now, world politics are still governed by ignorami who are\nsteeped in religious and/or racial prejudice. Sorry to say this, but hating\nanother nation or it\u2019s people will not solve the problem. Hate is the reason\nfor all this in the first place, so I suppose you\u2019re attitude is just as much\nto blame. Americans, in general, are quite wonderful people, and they will\nsupport any effort that they believe protects their nation and their people.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Blame the propagandist government and the\nidiot that\u2019s currently running it. At least they weren\u2019t able to plant WMDs in\nIraq, and then claim to find it. Maybe not all hope is lost. I am also fairly\nconvinced that Radiatidon cannot be one person. That much knowledge in one\nbrain would cause it to swell and collapse into a black hole under it\u2019s own\nweight.

Even our own senses and memory\ncan be misleading. There is a constant battle fought in our minds between\nlogic and emotion, between memories and desires, between the egoistic and the\naltruistic and between what we see and what we want to see. This limbo of\nuncertainty can lead to non-action, which some view as a bad thing, but\ncertain eastern philosophies view as a good thing. Everything we do or say is\nbased on incomplete evidence. Therefore, we must be as sure as we can be,\nbefore we take any action. We must also be willing to take responsibility for\nour actions, whatever they might lead to. This is my rational anarchist point\nof view.\n\n\u201cNothing is true. Everything is permissable.\u201d\n\nAlso, Radiatidon might just be a person with significant amount of life\nexperience, who prefers reading and research over American Idol, or he might\nbe a group of people, like The Bard and Sun Tzu are sometimes thougth to have\nbeen.\n\nRockadilly\n\nPosted 22 April 2008 at 03:06 pm\n\n> stholas said: \u201cI am also fairly convinced that Radiatidon cannot be one\n> person.

I personally wouldn\u2019t know. But I\nsuppose I couldn\u2019t judge Mr. Hoover too harshly, he did what he thought he had\nto in order to keep his country safe. If that was his driving motive. However,\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that I have to like it. Certainly, times are hard, and it\nwould be difficult to walk out of your homes wondering, as some Americans\nclearly do, whether they are about to be attacked again. But does that make it\nokay for the government to suspend some pretty basic rights? Just because the\naccused isn\u2019t American? Practical solutions are needed, but I personally don\u2019t\nthink that they should be implemented at the cost of one\u2019s human rights. But\nthen again, I\u2019m young and naive. I still think that governments -for all their\npower and prestige \u2013 are still just public servants. Really high ranking ones,\nof course. But they\u2019re here to keep my rights safe, not take them away.\n\noneeyechuck\n\nPosted 22 April 2008 at 07:57 pm\n\nJack, I don\u2019t have the complete, practical answer on how to stop terrorists\nwho don\u2019t care whether or not they die. Maybe the only solution is to trample\non the Bill of Rights. (Even armed with such power, the government hasn\u2019t been\nable to put much of a dent in the drug trade.) Maybe the libertarians are\nright and we need need to arm everyone but the legally insane. Either method\nis unlikely to stop truly determined and resourceful people who are hell bent\nto make martyrs of themselves.\n\nIn a (totally hypothetical) perfect world, people would be taught that human\nlife is worthy of respect, in and of itself, and while we\u2019re at it, why not\nincorporate the ideal of infinite diversity in infinite combination (with\napologies to Gene Roddenberry). Until that day comes, I will stand by my\nearlier statement, and I really do mean that I would rather die under a\nterrorist\u2019s knife, than to live under tyranny. (I can only hope I wouldn\u2019t pee\non myself, if it came to that.) The Founders risked a noose or death on a\nbattlefield for the chance to start a great experiment in Liberty and\nDemocracy, if your\u2019s is the prevailing attitude, they took those risks in\nvain.

Setting the seeds for a garden of non-answers to take root.\nAlthough they may have stated their opinions/intentions about those topics\nalready that I haven\u2019t heard. Wordy rant over.\n\nTwo Cents from Girth\n\nPosted 23 April 2008 at 06:36 am\n\nWell Falco, Those are all good tools to the party in power... If Democrats had\nthose powers in the White House, the Republicans would be fuming, that is why\nyou hear the whining from faceless groups complaining of civil rights\ninfringements. Given that there is a chance that there is a chance for a\nDemocrat to sit in the White House, it is best if they dont demonize those\npowers before they get a chance to use them. Once their use is at an end, they\ncan say how bad they were and assign regulators to watch the regulators, all\nvery efficient government protocal... Much like big business. If you are doing\nthe right thing, why you you mind Big Brother??? Iam one of the people who\nbelieve I\u2019d rather be watched than blown up. I\u2019d say another issue that is\nbeing glossed over is lets say the rest of the important isssues!!!! Ohh like\nimmigration, social security, the war, our debt as a nation, how to curb this\ndefeatists ideal some of us have adopted and how to withdraw a bit from world\naffairs. As usual, this is an election and what you dont want to do as a\ncandidate is be nailed down to actually discussing topics that you dont have a\nsolution to; it is best just to preach about change in general because change\nnaturally comes...and of course keep your face on the TV so people can see\nyou, not nessecarily hear anyof the junk your spilling, just see you. One of\nthese days we will have a candidate just go up there and stand and not say a\nword; I may very well think that person would be making alot of sense :) As to\nthe article, yeah I am sure that sort of thing happened/happens, humans are\nhumans flawed with stupidity and adgendas. What is also important to remember\nis when we get it right, like when we cracked a code of Imperial Japan and\nsent 4 carriers to the bottom based on intelligence getting it right. Minus\nfour carries, the Imp. Navy was no longer able to lord over the seas and\nproduction could not easily replace those. How about how we were able to\nsmuggle out tens of thousands of Jews, Dutch, Slavs out of Europe before we\nacknowledged the \u201cwork camps\u201d, again intel played a key part. Cracking enigma,\nshooting down Yamamoto, the phantom army of Patton, folks, we have many great\nsucesses that turned tides of battles, wars and events. Yes, we fall on our\nface at times and when we fall, people get hurt, even killed. I believe the\nthoughts and actions of those eight, at times were to betray and do harm to\nour nation, for that, they are traitors and deserve punishment. As for a\ntraitor or spy gone bad, those are the first that should be shot. Do you\nreally believe he had a profound change of heart or did he simply have the\nheart of a traitor?? A dishwasher...a amn goes all his working life and he is\na dishwasher, of course he is going to sell out for $80,000 1940\u2019s dollars and\nbetray America. He was approached, he accepted, he was trained, paid, he was\ngiven a team, he was transported, he landed, his traitors heart betrayed him\nagain, got scared and ran again... The minute he took the money his fate was\nsealed, this is no intrigue, this is a double cross. Double adgents are\nhistorically a risky business and I\u2019d sentence all I come across if I was on a\ntribunal. As far as the FBI is concerned, yes, they did not get it right and\nHoover had his own slant on things and his adgenda including protecting the\nname of the FBI and his own ego, no question. How many calls, walk ins and\nother far fetched claims do you think come across the desk of the FBI??? I\u2019d\nsay quite a few a day. How many threats, scares, conspiracies?? I think in\nsome cases we are slowed by honesty and miss the obvious big picture. Pearl\nHarbor, \u201cwork camps\u201d, Wake not getting reinforced, P.I. getting isolated, lack\nof involvement in China for them WWII started in the early 30\u2019s and millions\nwere lost, we sat and watched..., the war raged in Europe for two plus years,\nwe watched and sold weapons. So no, we have not always been a clear thinking\npeople when it comes to the caring of other people. We do it all the time, we\nare doing it now. In the Sudan, thousands are being killed, we do nothing;\nhere is where I leave the bleeding heart boat, I nothing is what we should\ndo... We have no real interest in the area ands have scant ties to the region,\nwhy should this be our mess, isnt this one of the countires of France or\nEngland, arent other countries with militaries capable of quelling the\ndisagreement closer to the conflict, cant they do what is right. Here is the\nthing with the media, it takes away our surprise and deniablity. There will be\nsome people that will still act surprised and ask \u201cWhy didnt we do anything\u201d\nafter the tradegdy is over and in the books. We have a long list of those kind\nof chapters and after the tenth or so drama, the same story of compassion\nafter the fact gets old. You know as well as I do in ten years, we will but\nthe Bosnia and Sudanese incidents in a history book and a teacher will stand\nat the front of the class and pine over the dead and say, \u201csee now, we are a\nbetter people and would never let that happen again\u201d. Just like our economists\nsay \u201cOur economy will never suffer from the problems we had in the past\u201d, they\nmay be right, but there will be new problems.

I don\u2019t think I would be considered French or Italian just\nbecause I was living and working or going to school in those countries. The\nsad fact is that a good number of immigrants \u201cjump ahead\u201d of the legal\nprocesses to get into this country and ruin it for everyone else. The general\npublic, especially in immigrant infested areas of the country are tired of the\ncosts associated with illegal immigration, both in public dollars spent, lower\nquality of life and in lives lost. Stholas said he or she had a degree and a\nvisa, good for him or her. The gracious United States has given you permission\nto study at one of our fine universities, or needs your intellect in some\naspect of our economy.

In no way was I suggesting that we lock down the borders. All of\nthe issues raised in these comments (immigration, trade, \u201cforeign\nentanglements\u201d, terrorism, liberty vs. security, etc.) have no easy solutions.\nI believe in absolutes as ideals to strive for, especially if we wish to\nregain our standing a a world leader in human rights. I don\u2019t recall any\npassage in any founding documents that said that these rights were granted by\nthe government to the people. It\u2019s the other way around, We the People grant\nthese powers to the government! (Nor do I recall that such rights are denied\nto non-citizens.) At the same time, I also know that almost no political issue\ncan be treated as if it were a simple yes/no problem, or as if it were in a\nvacuum. All actions (or non-actions) have consequences, and in most cases, a\nlot of them are unforeseen (or willfully not seen). If we were to close the\nborders and throw out those who are here illegally, a lot of industries would\nsuffer. I am the kind of person who would (and at one point did) scrub toilets\nif that\u2019s what I had to do to put food on the table. I have seen too many\n(mostly young) people refuse to take such menial jobs to think that \u201cillegals\u201d\nare taking only \u201cgood \u2018Merican\u2019s\u201d jobs and I have seen an influx of workers\nwilling to take jobs for lower pay drive wages down (primarily in\nconstruction). I also wonder how many Einsteins or Tesla s (I could go on a\nside rant about the injustices done to the \u201cfather\u201d of modern AC current, but\nI won\u2019t) we would deny the opportunities available in this country. There are\nno easy solutions, but suggesting simplistic fixes to complicated problems is,\nimho, worse than not having any ideas at all because such ideas only reinforce\nthe \u201call-problems-can-be-fixed-by-the-end-of-a-thirty-minute-TV-episode\u201d\nthinking that there is too much of already. Killing people, except in\nimmediate defense of oneself or others, is wrong. Torturing people is wrong\n(not to mention that it garners more bad intelligence than good) no matter\nwhat the motive. Listening to my phone calls, reading my e-mails, or searching\nmy home without a warrant, properly based on probable cause is wrong! How long\nuntil one of our current or future \u201cLeaders\u201d uses the powers of the unitary\nexecutive to start throwing political rivals or their supporters in jail for\ndissent? There\u2019s a reason that Orwell wrote \u201cPower is not a means, it is an\nend. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution;\none makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of\npersecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of\npower is power.\u201d That reason is that statement is true! Fascists always have\nan enemy to point to, to scare the population. \u201cWe are doing this for your\nprotection.\u201d Forgive me if I\u2019m not filled with gratitude as a boot grinds into\nthe face of a peaceful protester, or the SWAT team breaks down the wrong door\non a no-knock warrant. I\u2019ll end this rant with a quote from one of my favorite\nFounders. \u201cThose who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little\ntemporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\u201d \u2013 Benjamin Franklin (oh,\nand thanks to Silverhill for the coding advice.

The ridiculous discussion in comments is\nendemic of its sloppiness. Eight men, out of uniform, in possession of\nexplosives and arms, infiltrated our defense grid, came upon our shores, and\nwere, gosh darn it, just misunderstood. Is that your point? What a joke.\n\nYou invoke perspective and emotionality on the micro level while failing to\nput it in the context of the macro. Millions were dying around the globe at\nthe hands of a planetary conflict. And in the middle of this greatest period\nof violence ever known, these eight men (two really) thought they could\npretend to be spies to get back to their loved ones? Sorry, but your attempt\nat to create pity for them is trite. Those men were engaged in one of the\ndeadliest games and they lost. Hoover, who was an odd bird, at least had the\nforesight to pursue a major psychological victory against Nazi Germany. It\npaid off. The cost? Six spies/saboteurs went to their deaths and two fools\nwent to prison. In context to the massive death toll that WWII wrought, that\nis a small price to pay. I do not say this lightly.\n\nThe FBI made and will continue to make blunders, but they also do and have\ndone a lot of good work. They are not all powerful, but the perception that\nthey hold such power, when applied correctly and with extreme prejudice, is a\nvery useful tool at keeping our enemies at bay. Events such as Pastorius,\nalthough an ugly business, helped give us that tool.\n\n> Their hastily assembled tribunal will also be looked to as the model for any\n> future prosecution of \u201cunlawful combatants.\u201d\n\nIf you want to drag current events into your DI articles, I\u2019m all for it, but\navoid loaded and overly simplified sentences like the above. The bias of the\ncontemporary is an easy pit to fall into and I think this article has taken\nthe plunge. I\u2019ve come to expect better writing from DI.

Are our cell phone calls and emails really \u201cessential\nrights\u201d??? As opposed to our right to defended borders from enemies both\nforiegn and domestic... Listen to my phone calls and keep illegals out!! They\nendanger my right to the pursuit of happiness because they make me pay more\ntaxes to support them and their childerens education. Would our educational\nsystem be better if we could teach in one language and use all the funds for\none unified purpose, a little e plurabis unum in the hall of academia or does\nthat violate someones rights??? How about my right not to have illegal\nforeigners walking on our land? This is not Zenophobic, it is America... the\nlaws of the land, this land, say that is my right to expect that! On a side\nnote, I am kind of pissed, I had a small book going and my trusty laptop\nerased it... so this is the pissed off condensed version. :) People are\nrunning around saying rights for this and rights for that. How many rights\ndoes a criminal have? NONE!!!! They forfieted those when they turned their\nback on our laws!!! Lets build the wall! Take our prison guards,Nat. Guard,\nreserves and border patrol to our borders, sound creul? They are our military\nand peace keepers... where else are they going to defend our borders???\nduhhhh... as an all volunteer force if the border is not your kind of place,\ndont enlist, one of your many rights!! See, your rights are not being\ncurtailed here. Now that we have our forces disributed like they should be,\nbring in the prisoners and illegals to build the wall. Closer to a fact than a\nsterotype, how many Hispanics have you met that can not learn to work\nconcrete? No seriously... Our prisoners need to be taught that crime is not\nthe answer, working on the wall would reduce our 1% of our total population in\nincarceration. It would let them earnestly pay their debt to us with not only\ntheir time but sweat and possibly blood. Is that cruel to make a man labor\nunder the sun? No, cruel is, I pay the taxes so they can get three squares,\nwatch tv and tell each other how bad ass they are. I wake up and go to work, I\nabide the law and I am free. I expect a prisoner to have it rougher than me,\nso labor in the sun like I do... learn that crime is not the way. Deter future\ncriminals with the sweat of their labor, show that criminal getting worked\nlike he is rented on the Hollywood screen. Let the media show the tired, dirty\nline of criminals coming back from a hard, hot days work and see how many new\ncriminals enter our prisons... Our illegals can serve a manditory sentence\nwith or with out the support of their native government, if they dont like it\nlet them stop their people at the borders and stop printing books to encourage\nborder crossings. How much money has my plan spent so far??? Have resources\nbeen missused??? Guards guard. Prisoners work, if they work well they may be\nset free... how many rights have been truely violated. Being a criminal and\nnot wanting to something and being required to do something anyway is not a\nrights violation folks, it is a sentence. Pay the price for ones actions.\nResponsibility... when the wall is built, release the illegals and explain to\nthem the only thing waiting for you on this side are spotlights, guard dogs\nand bullets. Sound tough? good, keep your body in your own country unless we\ngive our permission. The free ride has to end!!!! Can we simply find enough\nconcrete and wire to build a wall?? Heck we could even volunteer? Lose 20\nmillion who dont pay taxes and I guarentee we will be better off. We can find\npeople to work, we have millions of able bodied but troubled because they\nmade/make poor choices that would gladly work instead of starve... Get a\nwelfare check? How much work is required? Get food stamps? After how many\nhours of work? This will open the door to policies of who I really am about.\nEnter the \u201cNew Style\u201d: Now, when someone is truly incapacitated, too old,\nreally handicapped or injured, plenty of money will be at our disposal. A\nveteran goes to war for me and you, comes back without a leg, that soldier\nrolls in cash for the rest of that soldiers days. A teacher teachs for thirty\nyears and is ravaged by time, money is there to provide. A daddy is killed\nfighting a fire, college funds are waiting, a home is paid for, good food is\non the table. A bullet finds the cop on a cold winter night, the heat and\nlights stay on at his house forever... You see the ones in true need and that\nhave sacrificed will be cared for and greatly rewarded. That is how America\nshould be. A able bodied bum on welfare needs a good woopin, reminder and an\neducation. My bar for America is high, I dont plan to lower my expectations\nanytime soon, so some of the people around me just need to pull their heads\nout. Go look in the mirror, We the People are great and can be greater yet...\nstrong, determined and free! We have lost sight of some of these things with\nall the far fetched openness of our great experiement, we can only stretch\nself evident truths so far before they rend and responsibilty is handed to\nsomeone else. I want my responsibility and accountablity because that helps\ninsure my rights and freedoms, in turn it binds others to those same\nstandards, a pillar of the community that has been lost to us. Is any of this\nsinking in?? We are a great nation of all sorts of people and others would do\nwell not to look down our throats for teeth.\n\nmarkda1\n\nPosted 23 April 2008 at 07:16 pm\n\n> yojimbo30 said: \u201cThe ridiculous discussion in comments is endemic of its\n> sloppiness.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think that the discussion that ensued was ridiculous at all.

Confession to you crimes is not an automatic get out of\njail free card, on cannot kill a man and then simply turns ones self in, as if\nthe secrecy of the act was the only crime. The second they landed on American\nsoil with explosives and a mission of destruction they had already commited a\nhanus crime, sabotage, that is illegal even under the rules of war. It is\nclear from the atttacks on the 11th of Septemeber how much carnage can be\nwrecked by a few determined men. The six who were executed where caught red\nhanded and the fact that Dasch didn\u2019t try to get them to surrended did kind of\nindicated that they would have stayed true to the mission. These were not\n\u201cspies\u201d, they were what would have been called saboteurs and would now be\ncalled terrorists. If just one member of terrorist cell defects, How does that\nexcuse his confederates who seem completely oblivious to going turncoat.\nBurger and Dasch got a long time in prison but only because did they turn\nthemselves in and betray their confederates were they spared, the other six\nshowed no intention of turning themselves in and would simply continue with\ntheir deadly mission.\n\nSome of these comments about America (and in other places, Israel as well)\nbeing a brutal oppressor reminds me of when i was a boy in school. I was\noverweight and bullied a lot, my plumby english acceent stood out a lot in a\nScottish state school and i was teased mercilesly to the point where no one\nwould want to have anything to do with me and though i hated the people who\nabused me i kept trying to convince myself that they were \u201conly words\u201d and i\nshould just ignore them. Till one day this kid went too far and was making\nsexual comments and trying to impress his lackeys, he was browbeating me to\nthe point where i would break down and cry. This was a bully\u2019s favorite\ntactic. He never hit me, but he constantly threatened to and wouldn\u2019t let me\nleave. i couldnt take it any more and swung out at him, hitting him square in\nthe arm, i couldn\u2019t believe it when he went crashing down screaming and then i\nsaw the teacher. The bully milked his \u201cwound\u201d for all its worth and i got a\nweeks detention for bullying while i got a brow beating from my teacher for\nbeing a sociopath for daring to strike another student.\n\nHe and others hated me because he thought i was a rich, posh git and whipped\nup the hatred in others to make my childhood hell and i was punished\nmercilessly for daring to stand up to them. I can relate to America and Israel\nwho are surrounded by enemies who taunt and attack them constantly, twisting\nand distorting their every action into pure evil, to the point that they just\nwant to shut themselves away so that they can live in peace. Yet finally when\nthey do stand up they are painted as the bully and are cowled into submission.\n\nBleupea\n\nPosted 24 April 2008 at 05:51 am\n\n> JJ10 said: \u201cYour just SCARED!

Treblain, I am\nsorry for your past experiences, but they provide an excellent metaphor to\nseveral issues I see as problems we face all the time. Frankly, I think we\n(America) are judged way too quickly and harshly by the outside world.\nRadiatidon, man I love reading your posts. Finally, someone points out the\nfact that everyone loves to bitch about how bad America is, and when it comes\ndown to it, people are here visiting, (or even in prison) they find out we are\nnot terrible people. And yes I realize the gov. has made mistakes and we try\nto persuade other countries to our point of view but everyone does make\nmistakes and tries to convince others to their side. What if America quit\ngiving the billions, I said BILLIONS of dollars worth of aid and cancellation\nof debt to other countries! We are hated now, but boy, we would really suck\nthen.\n\nAnd as far as illegal immigration goes, something has to be done. People who\nare not citizens can go into hospitals without insurance and receive care for\nonly 50$. While the other folks who are working will get the full medical bill\nand if it is not paid, they will lose their house and retirement plans. Or the\nillegal immigrant that doesn\u2019t have car insurance and causes an accident. He\ngets deported while the family is stuck with medical bills on costs that are\nrising due to illegal immigrants not responsible for the bill.\n\nI know we are not perfect, but everyone else needs to get off their damn high\nhorse and realize we are trying to do the right thing.\n\nBleupea\n\nPosted 24 April 2008 at 06:27 am\n\nSorry, re-reading my comment, I meant \u201crooted\u201d not \u201crouted\u201d Too early in the\nmorning for this one, I suppose.\n\nTwo Cents from Girth\n\nPosted 24 April 2008 at 06:29 am\n\nOk JJ10: Here is the spot light and the question, (drum roll, please) so how\nwould you have it? Plans, solutions, addressing concerns and fears are on the\ntable to obvious and real problems. Most of my fears are already realized and\nI am not cowering; actually, I am ready to fight for what I believe, like\nmost, I have had about enough nonsense and psycobabble that goes nowhere, in\nyour opinion what does that make me? Now, I dont want berate you, but most of\nwhat I read was that is wrong, your scared, distortion of this etc etc. Maybe\nyou need a release valve, fine. I\u2019ll still be standing when your done. What I\nam really writing to you about is to see if you may have some insights and\nplausible solutions instead of critiques and critisms. You obviously have\nbrains and opinions, how about sharing your solutions, appart from Bush is\nbad, we are scared blah blah blah. I may find myself on the right and am\npersonally very old fashioned and consevative to the core but I still\nthink...yes, some of the right wing extra baggage is far fetched and incorrect\nto my way of thinking. I dont believe we need to be the medias constrained\nrobots on our political views, I think if we gravitate toward an ideology\nfine, but stay rooted in center of common sense, that is what the media\nattacks constantly. There is where the media drives its wedge, into the firm\ncenter of America, where we are looking for truth, not party line jargon,\ndouble talk and indoctrination. I believe most of us who speak out believe\nthey have something to contribute and would not mind being proven wrong if\nthey could be shown the where\u2019s and why\u2019s before hand instead of after the\nfact, that is called forsight and it is VERY valueable, hind sight is\npractically usless(may serve as a reminder not to make the same mistakes\nthough). So standing up is great! Shouting hey you stupid bastards your wrong,\nagain great! Now explain the why\u2019s, where\u2019s, the how\u2019s and ways to make it\nbetter. It is called forming a firm base, being decided about your beliefs,\ngoing on record and giving a solution. This where most just walk away or\ndecide to keep their teeth together, I dont see how that approach really\nbenifts America. I dont play guessing games, when I form a solution and\nsomeone stands back and says ohh that is crap and it is wrong, yeah it gets my\nattention; but I dont go into a defensive tizzy, I simply ask so how is it\nwrong and what can be done to correct the problem. Hey! If we use the most far\nleft, liberal plan and it works, GREAT! I am concerned about the plausible\nsolution, not who thinks of it and gets the political straw. Do you know the\nroad to confrontational politics is actually a long road to nowhere taking\nforever to get there??? Dont buy into the media hype of what their version of\npolitics is, please... So I\u2019d like to hear solutions from the Democrats,\nliberals or whatever banner you\u2019ve ascribed to, I am not trying to place\npeople into groups of labels, I want people to choose their our words to\ndescribe themselves and their solutions...\n\nReaper\n\nPosted 24 April 2008 at 10:28 am\n\nSorry I\u2019m not exactly going with the flow of commentary, but my head exploded\nabout 5 posts before the finish so I\u2019m just going to say my peace here and see\nif I can play catch up a little later.\n\nEvery nation in the history of existence has done this and worse, and is\ncontinuing to do so to this day. The difference is that the documentation of\nour crimes survives to see the light of day \u2014 most of it, anyways. Many\nnations cannot say this, and the fact that America seems to be singularly\nlambasted for her crimes against humanity is evidence of this. We\u2019re the only\nones owning up to any of our crimes.\n\nAs for the ongoing discussions of an overpowered government, I can\u2019t help but\ndisagree despite the fact that the idea does have merit. First, let me say\nthat anybody who says \u201cthis administration\u201d is a fool. Bush can suggest\nthings, goad them into being, but it requires the collective agreement of the\nmajority of Congress to enact these laws \u2014 and every single one of them has\nbeen reelected every 2 to 6 years by you (assuming you\u2019re American, that is).\n\nBut I digress. If you feel that your freedoms have been abridged, then I urge\nyou to POLITELY pursue their reinstatement. I, for one, don\u2019t feel like my\nfreedoms have been curtailed, though. I\u2019ve never seen anybody jailed for\nspeaking out against the government \u2014 God knows there aren\u2019t enough jails for\nthat. My ability to exercise free speech has never been limited by the\ngovernment\u2019s desire to monitor what I say. To be short, I cannot think of one\nthing I\u2019m not allowed to do that I SHOULD be allowed to do.\n\nFor the life of me I can\u2019t remember what else I wanted to say. Perchance it\u2019ll\ncome back later.\n\nyakoos\n\nPosted 24 April 2008 at 12:57 pm\n\nso i started this, i havent followed it on its way, but the original point of\nwhat I was making was simply that both left wing and right wing people make\nwild generalizations. Catkiller7\u2019s comment that this makes him mad at\nAmericans was one of these.\n\nI\u2019m a liberal, but i hate the way liberals think they are immune to\noversimplistic generalizations and bigotted statements. Foreigners commenting\non the United States government or the American people tend to feel similarly\nentitled.\n\nI just want to conclude by saying discussion and/or argument is good, but the\ndiscussion in these posts lack compelling arguments for the most part and just\nblow eachother off.\n\ndoubletrinity\n\nPosted 24 April 2008 at 08:42 pm\n\n> yakoos said:\u201dI\u2019m a liberal, but i hate the way liberals think they are\n> immune to oversimplistic generalizations and bigotted statements.

I don\u2019t think anyone would even try. I would have to agree\nthat America is judged quickly and harshly, but one should understand that\nAmerica, through its own Foreign Policy throughout history, and even\nstretching into now, has appointed itself the guardian and protector of\nfreedom and democracy. I\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s anything wrong with that;\nI\u2019m all for helping lift the oppressed and destitute. But when one is in such\na position of importance and responsibility, one is held to a \u2018higher\nstandard\u2019. Fair or no, that\u2019s pretty much the way it is. But in spite of\ngrumblings or international criticisms, well, aside from the odd\nfundamentalist or ten, I seriously, seriously doubt that the world at large is\nharbouring some concrete notion that America is actively trying to be bad, or\nthat Americans themselves are terrible people.\n\nJoe Buck\n\nPosted 24 April 2008 at 09:09 pm\n\n#62:\n\nNo, while Tim Berners-Lee is British, he invented the technologies that make\nup the World Wide Web while at CERN, in Switzerland.\n\nDesScorp\n\nPosted 25 April 2008 at 09:06 am\n\nPutnam\u2019s account here paints Dasch in far too heroic a light. By every other\naccount that I\u2019ve read, Dasch was no hero, and didn\u2019t turn his team in for any\nheroic reasons. He had delusions of grandeur, and was an active (and\nvoluntary) lifetime member of the Nazi party. Dasch turned them in not because\nof any sympathy for America, but in a temper tantrum as he percieved that the\nNazi\u2019s weren\u2019t properly recognizing his genius. Dasch had no great love for\nAmerica, and in several documented accounts, displayed contempt for America\nbecause as an immigrant, he could find only menial jobs. Again, his resentment\nwas keyed on his new country not fully appreciating his \u201cgenius\u201d:\n\n\u201cEugene Rachlis\u2019s in-depth account of Operation Pastorius \u201cThey Came to Kill\u201d,\ngives a number of reasons for Dasch\u2019s betrayal. An arrogant, self-absorbed,\nambitious man, Dasch was a perennial under achiever who harbored dreams of\nglory. At nearly every turn his grasp exceeded his reach. As a Nazi he felt\ndenied his proper role in the party. As an immigrant he resented the menial\njobs he found in America. Even as a saboteur he found his fellow spies\ninferior. At every turn he finds his talents under appreciated, his abilities\nbelittled. Now, in his moment of command, he seizes the opportunity to take\ncenter stage. As he mysteriously tells an old friend in New York \u2013 \u201c\u201dYou\u2019ll be\nreading about me all in the papers pretty soon!\u201d.\u201d\n\nDasch got what he deserved. He deserved neither reward nor pardon. I\u2019ve no\ndoubt that Hoover used the situation to the FBI\u2019s advantage, but Putnam paints\ntoo harsh an account of the agency in this issue.\n\nAs for the tribunal, Dasch and the others received the best possible\nrepresentation:\n\n\u201cIn true American fashion, the men would be represented by council. It was not\na volunteer job. Col. Cassius M. Dowell and Col. Kenneth C. Royall were\nappointed to the defense. Royall was a top notch defense attorney \u2013 Harvard\nLaw School grad, editor of the Law review. Dowell was a 40 year Army man,\nwounded in World War I, had taught law between the Wars. The Germans had as\ngood a legal team as they could ever have expected.\u201d\n\nSource of the quotes:\nhttp://www.montauklife.com/history/history_night_of_the_nazis.html\n\nsupercalafragalistic\n\nPosted 25 April 2008 at 12:19 pm\n\nI like the Don\u2019s comments. :)\n\nRepomancer\n\nPosted 25 April 2008 at 09:51 pm\n\n> JJ10 said: \u201cThe internet is a GLOBAL tool isn\u2019t it or does the USA own it\n> now ?

They converted all German agents to\ndouble agents, and were thus able to feed the Germans a vast amount of\nmisinformation. This included key elements of the D-Day deception, and later\non misleading data about V-weapon impacts.\n\nHoover was utterly incapable of seeing the use of double agents in strategic\ndeception. All he wanted was to make arrests and get headlines.\n\nLater in 1941, the Germans sent one of their top agents to the U.S. to set up\na new spy ring. He was actually a British-controlled double, and the British\nthought this was a great opportunity to extend the deception operation. Hoover\nflatly refused to let the deception go forward. FBI meddling nearly blew the\nman\u2019s cover with the Germans. Hoover also got all sniffy at the agent\u2019s\nplayboy lifestyle.\n\nNo one can say what might have been accomplished if the U.S. had run a\n\u201cdouble-cross\u201d system like Britain\u2019s, but Hoover made sure that it could never\neven be tried.\n\nmarkda1\n\nPosted 26 April 2008 at 09:12 am\n\n> Repomancer said: \u201cYou\u2019re confusing the Internet with the World Wide Web.\n> They are not the same thing.

While\neveryone within the jurisdiction of a particular state (American or not) is\nentitled to the protection of their life, liberty, and property and to the\nequal protection of the law, it is specifically citizens of the U.S. (meaning\nthose born or naturalized in the U.S.) that are protected from state laws that\nabridge the \u201cprivileges or immunites of citizens of the United States.\u201d It\u2019s\nnot an obvious difference, but those small gradations of Constitutional\nprotections can mean a lot. I think you would be hard pressed to find a nation\nthat didn\u2019t afford its citizens a greater scope of rights than non-citizens.\n\nI think more important than the question of individual rights in circumstances\nlike these (mostly because I think it is the basis from which those rights are\nprotected and given meaning in a practical sense) is the question of\nseparation of powers and checks and balances. The military tribunal process as\napplied in ex parte Quirin and now (see Hamdan v. Rumsfeld) is Consitutionally\nquestionable at best. Untrammeled executive authority is a scary prospect, and\nallowing a President to ride roughshod over Constitutional limits on power in\nthe name of patriotism in a time of \u201cwar\u201d is only the first step toward\nvoluntarily surrendering the personal liberties we profess to hold so dear. I\nam not contending that there is never a circumstance where certain personal\nliberties must be hemmed in temporarily (for example, the Constitution states\nthat habeus corpus can only be suspended during rebellion or invasion, neither\nof which are events that carry on for an indeterminate time). Rather, I think\nthat whenever such a curtailment of liberties occurs it should be closely\nexamined and that it is the duty of an American citizen to be aware and not\nmerely dismiss such concerns because someone tells them it is \u201cfor the greater\ngood\u201d without explanation.\n\nTwo Cents from Girth\n\nPosted 29 April 2008 at 10:10 pm\n\nNice arguement, a very eloquent, indirect \u201cI hate Bush commentary\u201d.\nInteresting, not a word of speculation on if any of these means have made the\nU.S. in anyway safer in the last six years or have stopped just one attack???\nNor a word on if they were deemed necessary by people with more info at\nhand???

This story is also incredibly fascinating, and damn\nwell written. The concerns that are risen in me occurs when I know people will\nread this and think it represents America as a whole, instead of putting it in\nperspective. Yeah, America (or rather, a few select individuals who happened\nto be working in its government at the time (i.e. over 50 years ago)) screwed\na bunch of people over to cover their own ass. It was wrong, and nobody\u2019s\ndenying that. There\u2019s a sadness that comes over me when I read this and think\nof how lonely Dasch must have been without a country to call home. Another\nsadness comes over me when I think of all the people who read this and think\nto themselves that this serves as a prime parallel representative of our\nentire government today. Yeah, again, a few select people who are up there now\n(I\u2019m NOT talking about who I know people think I\u2019m talking about) have gone\ntheir own way with screwing people over to cover their ass. Basically, all I\u2019m\nsaying is it\u2019s unfortunate how some will look at things guilty people have\ndone and think it\u2019s okay to extend that guilt to those people\u2019s coworkers, the\nrest of the country they live in, and then even to that same country half a\ncentury later. To make a long statement short, please, please don\u2019t look at\nthis and say something like: \u201cwow, America makes me sick.\u201d This story happened\na long time ago, and it hurts our feelings (mine at least) when people lump\nthe rest of us into the same category as (again) those few individuals who did\nand indeed still today make plenty of bad choices all by themselves.\n\nReading this over, I\u2019m actually a little surprised at how often that sad\nfeeling is reported in this particular comment. It\u2019s surprising because I\nusually have at least a tiny bit more of that super-stereotyped republican\nvigor when it comes to defending our government (or at least the rest of the\npeople who just live here), and I\u2019m usually at least a little more worked up\nover being on the opposite side of the fence from the people who just keep\nhating us... it\u2019s almost every day now that I read people calling America a\nvile place.

Simply put, illegal\nimmigrants need to be deported and held accountable for their actions.\n\nHamster_Herder\n\nPosted 19 May 2008 at 06:22 am\n\ni think illegal immagrants have to learn english and pay to become a citizen\nlike everyone else.\n\nMarshyMarsh\n\nPosted 04 June 2008 at 11:51 am\n\nI am disgusted, not at the American government, but at the individuals who\ncowardice cost the lives of (so far as I see) 6 innocent men, and ruined the\nlives of two brave people who tried to aid the supposedly \u2018good\u2019 side in the\nsecond world war. This article is damn interesting but also damn disgusting,\nit is only decent for the American Government to issue a formal apology to\nthese deceased men. I also agree that this would make a brilliant movie.\n\nNickDB\n\nPosted 18 June 2008 at 02:44 am\n\nmarkda1\n\n\u201cI wonder if anyone thinks that if an American committed crimes in another\ncountry they would be treated the same as we treat foreigners in ours?\u201d\n\nYes they are, in most countries that have modern constitutions, the right to a\nfree and fair trial are offered to everyone, along with same treatment in\nprison etc (IT might not be the same as offered in the states, but it will be\nthe same treatment that people of that country recieve) Illegal immigrant or\nnot.\n\nmarkda1 I\u2019m curious, have you ever traveled?\n\nMarkda1 \u201cAgain, the US has given, and continues to give the world a priceless\nasset that would set most of the world back 50 years if taken away. You\u2019re\nwelcome.\u201d\n\nThanks for the Internet, can we have our wheel back since it existed before\nyou yanks did?\n\nLinda Martin\n\nPosted 14 July 2008 at 07:08 am\n\nThe death penalty is a tricky one for me. Since DNA has found that so many\nthat were put to death were actually innocent, I\u2019m not as in favor as I once\nwas. However, if there is NO DOUBT that an individual took the life of another\nhuman being, it\u2019s only fair that they lose theirs. And, if I were to lose a\nmember of my family to someone who tortured them and caused them pain, a\nlethal injection just wouldn\u2019t be satisfactory to me. For something like\nspying.......I think the death penalty is a little severe.\n\nAs for the abortion thing.......it has nothing to do with the death penalty,\nbut........I just don\u2019t understand anyone who can say that a fetus is not a\nbaby. It most certainly is a baby. A fetus is not a baby, only in the same way\na 5 year old is not a 12 year old. That\u2019s just stupid and\n........naive.....ridiculous. I can\u2019t even express how frustrated I get with\npeople who insist a fetus is not a baby. That\u2019s just a cowards way of making\noneself feel better about thinking that it\u2019s ok to kill a baby.\n\nKJK::Hyperion\n\nPosted 03 October 2008 at 03:01 am\n\nBrombachian: yeah, a real dilemma. If only FBI had the authority and the\nresources to hide the identity and whereabouts of the two defectors until the\nwar was over... oh, wait\n\nalex212\n\nPosted 27 March 2009 at 01:26 am\n\nCan someone tell me if traces of a certain acid had really been found in the\nbasement sectors of the World Trade Center. I heard rumours that some experts\nsurmise it was somehow connected with CIA.... This might be rumours, but when\nI heard it, it gave me the creeps...\n\nMirage_GSM\n\nPosted 13 May 2009 at 08:59 am\n\n> DesScorp (#131) said: \u201cPutnam\u2019s account here paints Dasch in far too heroic\n> a light.

Dasch may or mayn\u2019t have had ulterior motives for defecting (That\nsource is just one of many, and without knowing the guy it would be hard to be\nsure), but it is a fact that he a) didn\u2019t commit any crimes (If you don\u2019t\ncount illegal immigration via a submarine, but for that the punishment would\nbe a bit excessive even in wartimes...) and b) helped to prevent others from\ncomitting a crime. So what if he was a boisterous git personally? That\u2019s no\nreason to be put into jail.\n\nischwarz\n\nPosted 02 August 2009 at 07:51 pm\n\nCurious about where the executions of the 6 took place..some accounts say DC\njail...other sing sing prison in NY....\n\nslyda\n\nPosted 26 February 2010 at 01:14 am\n\nIts Dasch and Burger who should have been executed \u2013 buy their own men.....if\nthere\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t stand its traitors and snitches. And here you all\nare sticking up for these worms who got their own men killed. The Germans\nshould have picked their men better!\n\nFrank G\n\nPosted 26 February 2010 at 07:11 am\n\nTaking in consideration how the FBI was operating in those days, it doesn\u2019t\nsurprise me that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was more thinking about his own\ngain. Here you have a guy who gives up his future (Dasch) and trying to do the\nright thing,but instead he get\u2019s slashed down because of some guys with big\nego\u2019s. I see this as a black period in civil warfare, and i can\u2019t imagine that\nthis is just a one time thing. There are probably way more cases that we are\nnot aware about. But still I love this country and understand also that in\nthat time period lots of people were all stressed about the war, and not\nthinking rational at some times. I only hope they learn from the past, great\nstory Christopher .

Wow.\n\nVestal\n\nPosted 07 May 2014 at 06:12 am\n\nI wish that I had known about this site a few years ago and to have taken part\nin the above discourse while it was still alive.\n\nRelating to the various statements for and against America \u2013\n\nIn my opinion (as an American) the main problem other peoples have with\nAmerica is that America as a whole does their absolute best to never\nakknowledge the atrocities that have been commited by its citizens (public and\nprivate) while at the same time standing on a pedestal and proclaiming to be\nthe beacon for the world to come to.\n\nLynne Smith Thor\n\nPosted 05 October 2015 at 11:45 am\n\nTy for your entire article, DI. I shall continue to read ALL the comments\nafter my nap. I was 5 yrs old in June 1942. I wish to share some slight\nadditional info with you. Have tried to contact you on webmaster by e\nmail.Sorry I am so late arriving on this scene. Still going to try to publish\nmy little story which may ( or not) strengthen the view that there was a more\n\u201cQuixotic,\u201d less Self serving, element in George\u2019s actions. The Gavel descends\nmore gently, generally, as life progresses, and we humans own up that none of\nus are ever TRUE HEROES, just tarnished contenders sometimes lucky enough to\nbe in the right place, doing just the right thing at the crucial time. If we\ndo not have the \u201cright\u201d people backing us, we are called \u201cTraitors\u201d at worst,\n\u201d Bunglers\u201d at best and never given the benefit of the doubt. I thank you for\nyour straightforward article. Can I get in touch with yow? How? grammalyn\n\nAnonymousx2\n\nPosted 14 June 2018 at 02:35 am\n\nLast.\n\n\u2022 END OF COMMENTS \u2022\n\n#### Share This Page\n\n\u00d7\n\nCan you spare a buck a month?
