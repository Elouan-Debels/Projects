The production timeline for\nthe truck experienced multiple delays. Initially slated for a 2022 release, it\nwas then pushed to 2023, and now, it's finally set for distribution. Given the\nstaggering reports of over 2 million preorders, it won't be long before the\nCybertruck becomes a common sight on our roads.\n\nIs that a good thing?\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for the Cybertruck. It aligns with\ncurrent automotive trends; in 2022, a whopping 72.9% of total passenger car\nsales were attributed to SUVs and pickup trucks. The growing preference for\ntrucks and SUVs among Americans can be attributed to safetyism. Drivers\nappreciate the elevated driving position offered by these vehicles, providing\nbetter visibility on the road.\n\nIn this piece I argue that Elon Musk\u2019s new Cybertruck is not just safetyism\nbut goes further into survivalism. At its core, safetyism prioritizes the\nminimization of harm and danger, aiming to create vehicles that protect their\noccupants from the everyday risks of driving. Think of car accidents or\nhandling in the rain. But the world itself is normal. The Cybertruck certainly\nchecks these boxes. But its characteristics extend beyond just safety. It is a\ncar built for a collapsed world. Survival. Not safety.\n\nThe Cybertruck resembles a vehicle built to withstand more than just traffic\naccidents; the design of the car suggests resilience against extreme post-\napocalyptic scenarios. This durability mirrors the survivalist's emphasis on\npreparation for unforeseen calamities, whether they be natural disasters,\nsocietal collapses, or other large-scale disruptions.\n\nA completely different vibe\n\n### I Predict It Will Be Very Popular\n\nThe Cybertruck is poised to make a significant impact in the automotive\nmarket, and it's highly probable that it will become a popular choice for many\ndrivers. Reflecting on the automotive landscape just a decade ago, Teslas were\na rare sight on the roads. Their presence was akin to spotting an exotic bird\n\u2013 unusual and attention-grabbing. But the times have changed dramatically.\n\nToday, Teslas have seamlessly integrated into the vehicular tapestry of our\nstreets, standing shoulder to shoulder with other established car brands.\nTheir transition from an exclusive rarity to a ubiquitous presence underscores\nthe brand's growth and the public's increasing acceptance of electric\nvehicles. Given this trajectory, it wouldn't be surprising if the Cybertruck\nfollows a similar path, moving from a novel concept to a common sight on\nhighways and city streets alike.\n\nThe proliferation of Teslas on our roads is undeniable, but the influence of\nTesla extends beyond just its own vehicles. Many competing car manufacturers\nhave taken cues from Tesla's innovative approaches, integrating elements of\nits design and technology into their own electric car models.\n\nOne of Tesla's most distinct design choices was its minimalist interior,\ncharacterized by a large central touchscreen \u2014 reminiscent of an iPad \u2014 that\nreplaced the myriad of traditional buttons and controls. This streamlined\ndesign was a departure from the norm and set a new standard for modern car\ninteriors. Other car brands have adopted this design philosophy, showcasing\nsimplified interiors dominated by touchscreens. Tesla shaped the trajectory of\nthe electric car industry and set design benchmarks that others now strive to\nemulate.\n\nAnother compelling reason for the anticipated popularity of the Cybertruck is\nthe allure of its uniqueness. In today's automotive landscape, there's a\nstriking homogeneity in vehicle design. Most cars, regardless of brand, seem\nto converge towards similar shapes, curves, and even color palettes. This\nuniformity often leaves consumers yearning for something distinct and\nrefreshing.\n\nEnter the Cybertruck. Its design is a radical departure from the conventional.\nWith its sharp angles, stainless steel finish, and futuristic aesthetics, it\nchallenges the status quo of automotive design. For drivers, this offers an\nopportunity not just to drive, but to make a statement. In a sea of vehicles\nthat often blur into one another, the Cybertruck promises to stand out,\noffering its owners a unique blend of novelty and individuality. In essence,\nwhile many cars today bear a familial resemblance to each other, the\nCybertruck boldly ventures into uncharted design territory, appealing to those\nwho crave distinction on the road.\n\nI wholeheartedly advocate for greater diversity, especially in design. In\nrecent times, there's been an overwhelming uniformity in the way things look,\nfrom products to architecture. This homogeneity can be stifling, and a dash of\nvariety is sorely needed to invigorate our surroundings. I even wrote about\nthis trend and call it the Refinement Culture.\n\nHowever, for me, the Cybertruck doesn't offer the kind of diversity I had\nhoped for. While it undeniably breaks the mold, its design direction feels\ntroubling. Rather than moving away from the current trend of sterile\nsimplicity, the Cybertruck seems to introduce an even more jarring aesthetic \u2014\none that evokes feelings of negativity, dystopia, and even aggression. Instead\nof presenting a vision of a brighter, hopeful future, its design suggests a\nharsher, more foreboding world ahead. In my view, while diversity in design is\nessential, it's equally important to ensure that it fosters positivity and\noptimism, rather than bleakness and hostility.\n\n### In This Newsletter\n\n1) Why Do I Hate the Cyber Truck\n\n2) Cybertruck Specs: I\u2019ll explain how the cyber truck will be able to handle\n\n3) Elon Musk\u2019s Obsession with Collapse: Elon is a smart guy but he\u2019s obsessed\nwith collapse. Should we take him seriously?\n\n### Why I Hate The Cyber Truck\n\nLook at this thing. Just take a look at it.\n\nWhen you look at the Cybertruck, what strikes you immediately? Design\ninterpretations are subjective, but it's hard to ignore the Cybertruck's\ndistinct, aggressive angularity. Its sharp edges and flat surfaces don't just\nremind one of brutalist architecture; they scream it. Brutalist designs, known\nfor their raw and unembellished nature, can come off as cold and even\noppressive. Here is a good write up on the specific design choices they made.\n\nThere's a clear militaristic undertone to the Cybertruck. Its armor-like build\nand metallic sheen suggest a vehicle built more for defense than leisure. And\nthe use of matte stainless steel, without any paint or fancy trim, only\namplifies its industrial, no-nonsense vibe. It doesn\u2019t hint at a bright, shiny\nfuture. Instead, it feels like a vehicle ready for a world where the primary\ngoal is survival.\n\nThis isn't a car conceived with a rosy vision of the future. This screams\ndystopian drive, made for a world perpetually under grey skies, a result of\nglobal attempts gone awry trying to combat climate change with hasty\ngeoengineering.\n\n> First production Cybertruck exiting Giga Texas into the wild.\n>\n> Go forth and do greatness \ud83d\udc4a twitter.com/i/web/status/1...\n>\n> \u2014 Greggertruck (@greggertruck) Jul 17, 2023\n\nImagine driving over sprawling homeless encampments on the way to work in\ncrime-ridden and riot prone downtowns of American cities.\n\nThe contemporary pickup isn't exactly a paragon of beauty. Yet its design\nleans away from a militant stance and avoids conjuring images of a post-\napocalyptic world.\n\nClassic models often radiate a jovial and upbeat aura, painting the world in a\nmore favorable light.\n\n> Bully truck\n>\n> This 1957 Volkswagen Type 2 is a single-cab pickup that is finished in red\n> over black vinyl upholstery.

The consumer seems to be interested in safety.\n\n### The Cybertruck and The Fallen World\n\nIt\u2019s not just the exterior design. The Cybertruck really does have features\nfor a collapsed world.\n\nThe Cybertruck may be the only truck that actually comes bulletproof. Tesla\nrecently shot a tommy gun at the Cybertruck to test how bulletproof it was.\nAnd it worked. None of the bullets went through.\n\nCrafted from ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel, the vehicle's shell\ncan withstand 9mm caliber bullets. This ensures that its metallic frame acts\nas a barrier against such small arms fire, solidifying its \"bulletproof\"\nstatus against this caliber.\n\n> Tesla Cybertruck with the bullet dents should be an option on purchase.\n>\n> That looks awesome. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n>\n> \u2014 Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) Oct 23, 2023\n\nWhat kind of scenario are we even thinking about where people will be shooting\nat your expensive car?\n\n^In the gray haze of 2052, cities had morphed into vast urban wastelands, and\nthe once-clear skies were now perpetually overcast. Society, fragmented by\ndecades of resource wars and political upheaval, had birthed dangerous\nfactions, with each staking claim to different territories. In this\ntreacherous landscape, I navigated the ruined streets in my Cybertruck, its\ncold stainless steel exoskeleton gleaming faintly in the dim light, a relic\nfrom a more hopeful time. The vehicle's electric hum was a stark contrast to\nthe usual cacophony of old combustion engines, making it an oddity in this\nera.\n\n^As I passed through an old commercial district, the unmistakable sound of\ngunshots rang out, echoing through the abandoned skyscrapers. Bullets pelted\nthe side of the Cybertruck, creating sharp, metallic pings but failing to\npenetrate the vehicle's armored exterior. A group of faction rebels, notorious\nfor their hatred of anything from the old world, emerged from the shadows,\ntheir intent clear. The Cybertruck's advanced acceleration surged as I pressed\ndown on the accelerator, leaving the rebels in a cloud of dust. Inside the\nsafety of its walls, the world outside seemed even more distant, a grim\nreminder of a past that had once promised a bright, interconnected future.\n\nThe boasts several features that seem tailored for a world riddled with\nunchecked crime and strife.\n\nSentry Mode:\n\n> SENTRY MODE OWL CONFIRMED on Cybertruck!\n>\n> \u2014 Nic Cruz Patane (@niccruzpatane) Oct 15, 2023\n\n  1. Sentry Mode: uses the vehicle\u2019s cameras to keep a watchful eye on its surroundings and notify owners if any suspicious activity is detected. It also records footage in case of a break-in.\n\n  2. High Ground Clearance: With its adaptive air suspension, the Cybertruck can achieve a ground clearance of up to 16 inches, suggesting the need to navigate rough, ruined terrains or obstacles commonly found in dystopian settings.\n\n  3. Off-Road Capabilities: The significant approach and departure angles, combined with its off-road mode, make the Cybertruck appear fit for a world where traditional roads might be less maintained or nonexistent.\n\n  4. Vault-Like Storage: The truck's bed, referred to as \"the vault,\" has a sturdy, retractable cover, giving it a secure, impenetrable feel, perfect for protecting precious cargo in a world of scarcity.\n\n  5. Massive Towing Capacity: The ability to tow large weights hints at a need to haul significant supplies, perhaps because of migration or fleeing from danger.\n\n  6. Integrated Light Bars: Instead of traditional headlights, the Cybertruck sports a unibrow-like light bar at the front and a similar strip at the rear. This minimalist, unified lighting is different from contemporary vehicles and adds to its futuristic appearance.\n\n### Is Elon Musk Right About Collapse?\n\n## Subscribe to Premium Membership to read the rest.\n\nBecome a paying subscriber of Premium Membership to get access to this post\nand other subscriber-only content.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready a paying subscriber?
