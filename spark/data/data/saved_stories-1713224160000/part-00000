Consumers, students, even math teachers get confused. In new\nresearch, Marketing Professors Matthew Fisher and Milica Mormann of SMU Cox\nshed light on a surprising persistent mistake consumers make that can have\nimportant consequences. The \u201coff-by-100%\u201d bias the authors observe impacts\npurchase decisions, with implications for every-day shopping decisions and\neven on trading on platforms like Robinhood and E-Trade.\n\nSpecifically, communication about percentage changes greater than 100% are\npervasive in the marketplace. They are prolifically used in consumer goods,\nreal estate, and personal finance, as well as in market trends analysis in\nenergy data and expressions of customer growth. \u201cYou give people these numbers\nlike 110% increase and they immediately, intuitively think it\u2019s a 10%\nincrease,\u201d Fisher says, \u201cthey are off by an entire 100%.\u201d This finding is rare\nin that many studies will show these effects on the margin, he adds. \u201cHere\u2019s a\nlittle shift in how people will invest, based on, some minor feature. It\u2019s not\nlike they\u2019re off by 1%; it\u2019s this whopping 100%.\u201d This is striking.\n\nAccording to Mormann, this effect is especially interesting in the context of\ntoday\u2019s \u201cattention economy\u201d \u2013 a world in which we have very limited amounts of\nattention to allocate across tons of information. \u201cWhen a consumer sees \u201c130%\nmore\u201d, they likely do not put much thought or effort into actually computing\nwhat it means,\u201d she adds. Instead, the consumer\u2019s mind \u201cjumps\u201d to the first\nthing that makes sense, the straight \u201c30% more\u201d calculation.\n\nThough percentages are commonly used in marketing communications, little is\nknown about how consumers process percentage changes greater than 100%. Given\nthat this information influences consumer judgments and choice, how managers\neffectively communicate about these magnitudes is important. \u201cEven numerate\npeople get sidetracked by this phenomenon,\u201d notes Fisher. \u201cWe find that\nroughly 50% of consumers, according to our studies, flat out get it wrong.\nThat\u2019s a large proportion of consumers missing by a lot.\u201d\n\nPrevious research has shown that consumers sometimes employ low-effort\nheuristics, or rules-of-thumb, when offers include percentages instead of\ndollar amounts. Originally developed in ancient commercial contexts, then used\nto represent parts of a whole, an absolute plethora of percentage uses now\ndescribe many forms of relationships in our stats-laden world.\n\n## Doing the math\n\nIn the research, Fisher and Mormann tied the percent challenge to financial\nincentives to see if that focused people\u2019s attention with skin in the game.\nEven then, it\u2019s not just laziness as to why people get it wrong, says Fisher.\nAs a default, we think of percent information like slices of a pie, using the\n\u201cof\u201d mentality. How much of the pie is that? My investment portfolio is worth\n$100,000. If you say it\u2019s grown 90%, people can do that math. $100,000 X .9 =\n$90,000. We use relative size, the pie concept, versus relative change. But if\nyou say the portfolio has grown 110%, they are going to think it\u2019s just 10%\nmore, or $10,000. However, 110% is $100,000 X 100% = $100,000 plus the $10,000\nadded to the principal of $100,000 (100+100+10=210). That is 2.1 times the\noriginal $100,000, or $210,000.\n\nFisher caught himself making this very mistake. He thought: Is 100% more than\n10% more? Was it 1.10 X 100 or 2.1 times more? \u201cAs a trained researcher, if\nI\u2019m having to pause to work through such a basic question, I was wondering if\nit tripped people up,\u201d Fisher recalls. The authors observed from their bottom-\nup process, and six studies later, that this was trickier than it should be.\nIt happens persistently.\n\n\u201cRelative change is where people have problems, defaulting to basic thinking,\u201d\nhe explains. Part of the problem is that there are numerous usages of\npercentages. The relative change usage represents one of the most complex\nusages of percentages and, even after being taught how to compute it, people\nstruggle with providing accurate estimates. While these two usages may appear\nsimilar (e.g., \u201c125% more\u201d vs. \u201c125% of\u201d), they lead to vastly different\nmagnitudes.\n\nRelative change, such as 125% more, leads to magnitudes 100% larger than those\nof relative size (ie., 25% more). Thus, the authors show in their research,\nwhen consumers encounter percentage changes greater than 100%, they tend to\nincorrectly apply the relative size usage, which utilizes part-whole logic,\ninstead of the appropriate relative change usage. This leads many consumers to\nsystematically underestimate percentage changes greater than 100% by exactly\n100% (e.g., computing \u201c25% more\u201d runtime instead of \u201c125% more\u201d runtime) \u2014 the\nphenomenon they call the \u201cOff by 100%\u201d bias.\n\nConsumers face difficulties processing percentages because they describe many\nforms of proportional relationships, each reflecting a different mathematical\nreality, the authors write. The authors focus on two distinct usages of\npercentages. Consider a consumer shopping for a pair of new headlight bulbs\nfor her car. She examines a product on Amazon that claims a particular bulb\ngives \u201c130% more light on the road\u201d compared to a standard bulb. In this case,\na product attribute (the length of the light beam cast on the road in front of\na car, in feet) is communicated in the form of relative change. That is the\nmagnitude of change relative to an initial quantity. Here, the amount of\nchange, i.e., \u201c130% more\u201d, needs to be added to the initial 100%, or 60 feet\nof light cast by standard bulbs. So, the bulb gives 230% of the initial amount\n(100% + 100% + 30%) or 2.3 times as much light, which is 138 feet of light on\nthe road.\n\nAlternatively, percentages can also communicate relative size, that is, a size\nrelative to an initial quantity. For example, a headlight bulb may offer \u201c130%\nof the light\u201d on the road compared to a standard bulb that projects 60 feet of\nlight. This statement tells consumers that the first quantity is 30% larger\nthan the second. For example, the bulb gives \u201c30% more\u201d or \u201c1.3x\u201d as much\nlight, which equals 78 feet of light on the road. Consumers simply apply the\nrelative size usage instead of the appropriate relative change usage, being\n\u201coff by 100%\u201d in their magnitude judgments.\n\nSo an understanding of percentages, while a show of numeracy, the off-by-100%\nbiasexists, whether one is numerate or not, conclude the authors. Marketers\nand policymakers communicating numerical information should be aware in\npresenting information or statistics. People tend to overestimate or\nunderestimate percent-related numbers. Bottomline: The off-by-100% phenomenon\nis tricky and persistent.\n\nThe paper, \u201cThe Off by 100% Bias: The Effects of Percentage Changes Greater\nThan 100% on Magnitude Judgments and Consumer Choice\u201d by Marketing Professors\nMatthew Fisher and Milica Mormann of Cox School of Business, Southern\nMethodist University, is forthcoming in Journal of Consumer Research.\n\nSummary by Jennifer Warren.\n\nShare this\n\nShare on facebook Share on twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nMatthew Fisher\n\nAssistant Professor of Marketing\n\nMore by Matthew\n\nShare this\n\nShare on facebook Share on twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nMagazine\n\nBulletinConnectionsCorner SuiteCox 100DevelopmentFeatureNewsOffice HoursOnline\nFeaturePerson of InterestQuotablesResearchVoicesYearbook\n\nRecommended\n\n#### Coin Offerings: The Economics of Blockchain-Based Platforms and Their\nTokens\n\nBy Rowena Gan\n\n#### Bond Markets in the Time of COVID\n\nBy Alex Zhou\n\n#### New Frontiers in Competition and the World\u2019s Most Valuable Brands\n\nBy Wendy Bradley\n\n#### Proving Gender Bias is Hard: Cox Professors Did, With the Help of a Nobel\nPrize-Winner\n\nBy Darius Miller\n\nSubscribe for updates\n\nThis form needs Javascript to display, which your browser doesn't support.\nSign up here instead\n\nTo sign up to receive our emails, fill in the following fields and hit submit.\nThanks, and welcome!\n\nRelated topics @ smu.edu/cox\n\nDegrees and Programs\n\n### Master Real-World Problem-Solving with an MBA from SMU Cox\n\nLearn More About Online Programs at Cox\n\nCenters and Institutes\n\n### The Edwin L.
