CORE is based on BSD Unix and is characterized as a\nscale-up product whereas the newer SCALE is based on Debian Linux, termed a\nscale-out product, and supports Docker Containers, Kubernetes, KVM, Gluster,\nand a wider range of hardware than CORE. It\u2019s reckoned that the more mature\nCORE has better performance than SCALE and needs less CPU power and memory.\n\nFrom now on iXsystems will develop SCALE faster than CORE, with CORE becoming\nmore of a maintenance product. Why shift the development center of gravity\nfrom BSD to Linux? It\u2019s to do with software developments upstream of the base\noperating system.\n\nKris Moore\n\nKris Moore, SVP for engineering, told us: \u201cUpstream has shifted. So first of\nall, ZFS, that\u2019s kind of the heart and soul of TrueNAS and was for FreeNAS as\nwell. Most of that [development] work takes place on Linux these days;\nfeatures testing, all that happens on Linux. FreeBSD is the thing you port to\nand you\u2019re done. So that momentum has moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, drivers, features, all these things are natively developed on Linux\nfirst. These are day one, and then FreeBSD is if we feel like it or a\ncommunity person ports something over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a huge chunk of our engineering staff spending time improving FreeBSD\nas opposed to working on features and functionalities. What\u2019s happened now\nwith the transition to having a Debian basis, the people I used to have 90\npercent of their time working on FreeBSD, they\u2019re working on ZFS features now\n... That\u2019s what I want to see; value add for everybody versus sitting around,\nimplementing something Linux had a years ago. And trying to maintain or\nbackport, or just deal with something that you just didn\u2019t get out of box on\nFreeBSD.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not knocking against FreeBSD. We love it. That\u2019s our heritage. That\u2019s\nour roots, I was on the CORE team elected twice. So believe me, if I felt like\nI could have stayed on FreeBSD for the next 20 years, I would have absolutely\npreferred to do that ... But at some point, you gotta read the writing on the\nwall and say, well, all the the vendor supported-innovations are happening on\nthe Linux side these days.\u201d\n\nBrett Davis\n\nBrett Davis, iXsystem EVP, added: \u201dOur heritage as a company is we actually\nspawned from BSD. It\u2019s near and dear to our hearts, and has been for a long\ntime. And we probably stuck to it longer than we should. We probably should\nhave made the decision earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had our druthers we probably would have stuck with with FreeBSD. But\nthe reality of our focus is making a great product that people love, and not\nmaintaining an operating system. That\u2019s just the reality.\u201d\n\nBSD aficionados don\u2019t like this change. Moore said: \u201cTalk is cheap and\ncomplaints are free. You know, everyone loves to complain about it. But ... if\npeople wanted to push FreeBSD forward for the last 15 years, they would have.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s not like iX has gone to the dark side. We\u2019re an open source company\nstill. Guess what, Linux is open source. This is something I\u2019ve had to argue\nwith the BSD guys, like you\u2019ve betrayed us. And I was, like, the source code\nis all still there. It\u2019s all free. It\u2019s all still available.\u201d\n\nDavis suggested: \u201cThere\u2019s actually three camps of users. There\u2019s the FreeBSD\nuser. There\u2019s a Linux user, and actually, there\u2019s a larger group of users that\ndon\u2019t care. They just want a product that works. They want a NAS product. They\ndon\u2019t care what operating system is underneath it. I mean, do you care what\noperating system runs your microwave?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just want to be able to install something. They want to make sure that\nthey\u2019re not frustrated by incompatibilities when drivers aren\u2019t there for the\nhardware they\u2019re trying to build. And most of these users aren\u2019t giving us any\nmoney.\u201d\n\nIt seems to us here at B&F that two parallel rivers of open source Unix\ndevelopment. BSD and Linux are changing in relative importance, with Linux\ntaking priority in many developers\u2019 minds over BSD. It\u2019s not iXsystem\u2019s\nresponsibility to tell these Linux supporters that they are wrong. FreeBSD is\nunfortunately not so important anymore.\n\nTrueNAS CORE releases are tied to BSD releases, and Davis admitted: \u201cTo be\ntotally fair, we kind of scored an own goal by making a decision to change the\nname of the [next CORE] release from 13.1 to 13.3 ... so that it could align\nwith that version of FreeBSD.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been said that TrueNAS CORE VMs won\u2019t migrate to SCALE. Moore said this\n\u201cis just patently false, they migrate clean one to one.\u201d It\u2019s also been\nsuggested that CORE is dead and has no future. Moore said: \u201cWe\u2019re getting\nready to release 13.3. The next update is coming out in the next few months,\nand we have to support it for years, no matter what.\u201d\n\nDavis added: \u201cWe have enterprise customers with entitlements dating out seven\nyears. So we\u2019ve got a lot of engineering ahead of us.\u201d\n\nSumming up, Davis said: \u201cWe want to make sure that the users are are taken\ncare of, and whether or not they pay us, even though we are a business, making\nsure that we have a product that\u2019s freely available in open source is\nimportant to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other thing I think that\u2019s sort of missed here is that no one\u2019s marooned.\nYou have the ability to migrate from CORE to SCALE at any point. No one\u2019s\nforcing that at any point. If we\u2019re going to maintain it for years, and you\nhave a system that\u2019s running fine, [then] just leave it, no problem.\u201d\n\n  * TAGS\n  * iXsystems\n  * TrueNAS\n  * ZFS\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedin\n\nReddIt\n\nEmail\n\nPrevious articleZluri gets ahead of SaaS privacy demands with data vault\n\nNext articleDatacenter storage system market declines 7%, says analyst\n\nChris Mellor\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### Dell amplifies AI workload support with Intel Gaudi3\n\n### Panzura goes on the attack against ransomware\n\n### Storage news ticker \u2013 April 9\n\n### Deep-seated issues delay Cirata growth\n\n### IBM revamps storage product brand names for clarity\n\n### Business continuity in war time: Is it even possible?\n\nBlocks and FilesStorages and File System News\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nBlocks & Files is a storage news, information and analysis site covering\nstorage media, devices from drives through arrays to server-based storage,\ncloud storage, networking and protocols, data management, suppliers and\nstandards.
