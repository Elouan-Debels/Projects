For instance, those wanting revenge on an ex-partner may burn letters or\ndestroy gifts.\n\nResearchers believe the shredder results may be related to the phenomenon of\n\u201cbackward magical contagion\u201d, which is the belief that actions taken on an\nobject associated with a person can affect the individuals themselves. In this\ncase, getting rid of the negative physical entity, the piece of paper, causes\nthe original emotion to also disappear.\n\nThis is a reversal of \u201cmagical contagion\u201d or \u201ccelebrity contagion\u201d \u2013 the\nbelief that the \u201cessence\u201d of an individual can be transferred through their\nphysical possessions.\n\nFifty student participants were asked to write brief opinions about an\nimportant social problem, such as whether smoking in public should be\noutlawed. Evaluators then deliberately scored the papers low on intelligence,\ninterest, friendliness, logic, and rationality. For good measure, evaluators\nadded insulting comments such as: \u201cI cannot believe an educated person would\nthink like this. I hope this person learns something while at the university.\u201d\n\nThe wound-up participants then wrote down their angry thoughts on the negative\nfeedback on a piece of paper. One group was told to either roll up the paper\nand throw it in a bin or keep it in a file on their desk. A second group was\ntold to shred the paper, or put it in a plastic box.\n\nAnger levels of the individuals who discarded their paper in the bin or\nshredded it returned to their initial state, while those who retained a hard\ncopy of the paper experienced only a small decrease in their overall anger.\n\nResearchers concluded that \u201cthe meaning (interpretation) of disposal plays a\ncritical role\u201d in reducing anger.\n\n\u201cThis technique could be applied in the moment by writing down the source of\nanger as if taking a memo and then throwing it away,\u201d said Kawai.\n\nAlong with its practical benefits, this discovery may shed light on the\norigins of the Japanese cultural tradition known as hakidashisara (hakidashi\nsara refers to a dish or plate) at the Hiyoshi shrine in Kiyosu, just outside\nNagoya. Hakidashisara is an annual festival where people smash small discs\nrepresenting things that make them angry. The study\u2019s findings may explain the\nfeeling of relief that participants report after leaving the festival, the\npaper concluded.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Psychology\n  * Japan\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Fridge magnets can be cool aid to holiday memory recall, study finds\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Want to skip that Christmas party?
