This extension, known as #ChatControl 1.0 or\ninterim ePrivacy derogation regulation, was now carelessly adopted in a fast-\ntrack procedure before the European elections. Initially, the European\nParliament majority aimed to extend the regulation by only 9 months to swiftly\ntransition to targeted surveillance of suspects and a more effective approach\nto protecting children. However, today\u2019s deal extends the status quo by more\nthan twice the period originally envisioned, prompting criticism from Pirate\nParty MEPs, who have long advocated against this unprecedented mass\nsurveillance tool.\n\nPatrick Breyer, Member of the European Parliament for the German Pirate Party,\ncomments:\n\n\u201cThe EU Parliament\u2019s decision to extend blanket chat control contradicts its\nstated goal of protecting fundamental rights. Moreover, this deal fails to\nprovide a stronger and court-proof protection against child sexual abuse.\nVictims deserve better. Bulk scanning makes no significant contribution to\nsaving abused children or convicting perpetrators of abuse. Instead, it\nexposes thousands of minors to potential criminalization, overburdens law\nenforcement, and facilitates arbitrary private justice by internet companies.\nAs a Pirate, I am working to stop the illegal bulk chat control scanning in\ncourt. We will be watching every move of the EU Council which aims at adopting\nthe extreme dystopia of mandatory chat control 2.0 to destroy digital privacy\nof correspondence and secure encryption.\u201d\n\nMarcel Kolaja, Member and Quaestor of the European Parliament for the Czech\nPirate Party, comments:\n\n\u201cChild sexual abuse on the Internet is a severe problem that we should be\naddressing with all urgency. Unfortunately, the debate on this important issue\nhas become an endless battle for our privacy. As a result, we still do not\nhave an effective framework for the protection of children. Something that we\nshould have put in place years ago. Instead, the Commission is doing\nunsystematic steps by giving the companies that have historically treated our\nprivate data the worst the power to invade our privacy and read all our online\nmessages however they please. They say it\u2019s with children\u2019s safety in mind.\nHowever, those internet services have been snooping into people\u2019s private\ncommunications for years now and we have seen no convincing evidence that this\nhas actually helped to anything. To think that extending this exemption, the\nlegality of which I strongly doubt, will do more good than it will do harm is\nna\u00efve to say the least.\u201d\n\nFind more information on www.ChatControl.eu\n\nTagsChatcontrol \u2022 CSAM \u2022 Marcel Kolaja \u2022 Patrick Breyer\n\n### 0 comments on \u201c#ChatControl 1.0: Pirates condemn extension by Parliament\u201d\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n## Topics\n\nAI Act Anja Hirschel Anti-corruption Artificial Intelligence Artificial\nIntelligence Act Belarus Biometric Mass Surveillance Cannabis Chatcontrol\nContent Moderation Covid-19 Crypto Dalai Lama Digital Covid Certificate\nDigital Markets Act Digital Services Act DMA DSA e-ID ECJ eID EIDAS European\nCommission European Health Data Space European Parliament European Pirates\nDelegation European politics Fit for 55 Internet freedom Interoperability\nJulian Assange Marcel Kolaja Mark\u00e9ta Gregorov\u00e1 Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Peksa Open Letter\nPandora Papers Patrick Breyer Political Ads PPEU Qatar Right to repair Russia\nTaiwan Transparency Ukraine\n\n# More Informations\n\n## Navigation\n\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2024 European Pirate Party\n  * Powered by WordPress\n  * Theme: Pirate Rogue by xwolf\n\n## Follow us:\n\n  * Facebook page\n  * Twitter page\n  * YouTube\n\nTo change your privacy setting, e.g. granting or withdrawing consent, click\nhere: Settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
