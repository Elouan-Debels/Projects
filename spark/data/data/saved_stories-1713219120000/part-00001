FEX has\nbeen one of the leading avenues for opening up gaming on AArch64 Linux\nhardware, even making use of Wine / Proton (Steam Play) for enjoying Windows\nx86 games within AArch64 Linux confines.\n\nWith FEX 2404 there are new options available for better catering the\nemulation of the x86 memory model that can help with better performance. FEX\n2404 also brings just-in-time (JIT) optimizations that can deliver a roughly\n3% performance improvement.\n\nOne of the huge optimizations in FEX 2404 is optimizing memcpy and memset IR\noperations when TSO emulation is disabled. In this case the optimization can\ntake these memory operations from around 2~3GB/s throughput all the way up to\n88GB/s!\n\nFEX 2404 also has a number of other smaller fixes and improvements. As part of\ntoday's FEX 2404 release they are also showcasing the 2018 game God of War\nrunning on AArch64 Linux thanks to FEX-Emu:\n\nDownloads and more details on FEX 2404 via FEX-Emu.com or GitHub.\n\n5 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nLinux 6.10 To Merge NTSYNC Driver For Emulating Windows NT Synchronization\nPrimitives\n\nProposed \"LibGodot\" Lets You Embed Godot Game Engine Into Other Apps\n\nOpenRazer 3.8 Brings Support For Newer Razer Devices On Linux\n\nSDL 3.0 Will Now Prefer PipeWire Over PulseAudio\n\nLutris 0.5.17 Game Manager Brings Bug Fixes, Library Syncing & New Runners\n\nSDL 2.30.2 Released Along WIth New SDL3 Preview\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
