It has now affected more than\nhalf the world's coral including in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, and in\ncoastlines in Tanzania, Mauritius, Brazil, Pacific islands, as well as in the\nRed Sea and Persian Gulf.\n\nLast August the global average ocean temperature broke its all-time record,\nand has been above average almost every day since.\n\nClimate change is driving up sea surface temperatures as the warming gases\nemitted when we burn oil, coal and gas are absorbed by the oceans.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o - a natural climate event - has also contributed to warmer\ntemperatures since last June, though there are signs it is now weakening.\n\nFor 10 days in February scientist Neal Cantin flew a plane over the Great\nBarrier Reef for Australia's Institute of Marine Science. The UN heritage site\nstretches 2,000km, or roughly the length of the US east coast.\n\n\"For the first time ever we've documented very high levels of bleaching in all\nthree areas of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,\" Dr Cantin says. The levels\nare likely to kill lots of coral, he adds.\n\nCoral is vital to the planet. Nicknamed the sea's architect, it builds vast\nstructures that house 25% of all marine species.\n\nStressed coral will probably die if it experiences temperatures 1C above its\nthermal limit for two months. If waters are 2C higher, it can survive around\none month.\n\nOnce it has died, creatures like fish that navigate using coral noise can\nstruggle to find their way home.\n\nFor three decades scientist Anne Hoggett has dived at Australia's Lizard\nIsland - a beautiful reef that featured in the Netflix film Chasing Coral.\nShe's seen widespread bleaching again since February.\n\nLike many researchers, she was shocked when she saw coral turning white in the\nfirst mass bleaching in 1998. \"Now I'm just angry that this is being allowed\nto happen again,\" she says from Australian Museum's Lizard Island Research\nStation.\n\nInes Lange\n\nScientists including Jennifer McWhorter monitor coral reefs globally for\nchange\n\nCoral can recover from heat stress but it needs time - ideally several years.\nWhen weakened, it is susceptible to disease and can easily die.\n\n\"If given a chance, coral are actually resilient and can recover. But as\nbleaching becomes more frequent and stronger in intensity, we're really\nnarrowing that window,\" says Dr Emma Camp at the University of Technology\nSydney, Australia.\n\nThe last mass global bleaching was in 2014-2016. Since then, ocean\ntemperatures have become so much warmer that NOAA had to introduce three new\nheat alert levels.\n\nFrom Kenya, ecologist David Obura gets messages from hundreds of rangers,\nscientists and fishing communities in the Indian Ocean when they see\nbleaching. In February it started in Madagascar, then spread to Tanzania and\nComoros.\n\nFishermen know the corals intimately, he says, and immediately know when\nsomething is wrong. They are worried about the future of fishing, he says\nbecause if coral dies, it affects the feeding patterns of fish and in turn\ntheir livelihoods.\n\nAustralian Institute of Marine Science\n\nIf coral dies, it affects fish\n\nResearch published last week gave some hope that coral that living in cooler,\ndeeper water - at between 30-50m depth - in the Great Barrier Reef can survive\nfor longer than shallow corals as the planet warms.\n\nThe research shows that deeper water coral could survive global warming of up\nto 3C compared to pre-industrial times, says Jennifer McWhorter at NOAA who\nauthored the research with the university of Exeter\n\nBut all the coral scientists BBC News spoke to said that we must accept that\nreefs as we know them will permanently change and small-scale restoration work\ncannot save coral globally.\n\nOnly a rapid and global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that limits\nocean warming will guarantee we have at least some coral left, they say.\n\n\"It's like going from corals providing houses and buildings for marine life to\njust being scaffolding. What really wants to live in scaffolding?\" Dr\nMcWhorter says.Coral reefs are an early warning system for the impacts of a\nwarming planet on nature. \"We need to learn from this to not do this to other\necosystems,\" says Dr Obura.\n\nGraphics by visual journalist Erwan Rivault\n\nGreat Barrier Reef\n\nCoral reefs\n\nClimate\n\nEnvironment\n\nAustralia\n\nRelated\n\n## Australia accused of 'cooking the Reef' after new bleaching\n\n8 Mar 2024\n\nAustralia\n\n## Warning follows record Great Barrier Reef coral cover\n\n4 Aug 2022\n\nAustralia\n\n## Mass bleaching event hits Great Barrier Reef\n\n25 Mar 2022\n\nAustralia\n\nMore\n\n43 mins ago\n\n## Boy, 15, arrested after bishop stabbed in Sydney\n\nThe suspect is taken to an undisclosed location by police after a bishop was\nattacked during a sermon.\n\n43 mins ago\n\nAustralia\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## Police disperse crowds after Sydney church stabbing\n\nA bishop and several other people have been stabbed during a sermon in the\nsuburb of Wakeley in Sydney.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\n7 hrs ago\n\n## Molly the magpie returned home after public outcry\n\nA Queensland couple have been granted a licence to care for the bird, which\nthey illegally took in.\n\n7 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\n8 hrs ago\n\n## How will Ulez sway voters in the mayoral election?\n\nCandidates are clear on what they want to do with Ulez so will it also\ninfluence voters?\n\n8 hrs ago\n\nLondon\n\n8 hrs ago\n\n## Sydney stabbings: Who were the victims?\n\nTributes are flowing for the six people who died in a stabbing rampage inside\na popular mall.\n\n8 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
