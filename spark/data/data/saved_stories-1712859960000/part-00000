I kept saying there was\nmore to come (and I didn't just mean Circle of Protection: Black and Volcanic\nIsland ), and today I get to give you a taste of Magic's first ever expansion.\nI even have a preview card that I'll get to before I'm done. I want to set it\nup first, so you'll have to wait a little before you see it. If you can't wait\njust scroll down and meet me in the next paragraph. Now that they're gone, I\njust wanted to say to all the readers that stuck around - I like you better.\nReally. Just don't tell them that.\n\nBefore we dive into all the goodies that Arabian Nights has to offer, I'd like\nto begin something that I plan to make a staple in \"Making Magic\" previews:\nI'm going to introduce you to the design team. Without further ado, here you\ngo:\n\nRichard Garfield - Richard is probably best known for, well, DESIGNING MAGIC!\nIn his spare time, he's a math professor. Actually, I think in his spare time\nhe designs games, but hopefully if Magic keeps doing well, he'll be able to\ndedicate himself full-time to game design. (Word on the street is he's\ncurrently designing another trading card game built around a certain popular\nroleplaying game - hint: think fangs.) I've never met a bigger fan of games\nthan Richard. Every time I run into him at a con, he's always pulling out some\nnew game I've never heard of (it turns out Germans really like board games)\nwhich is always quite fun to play. It seems only appropriate that Magic's\ncreator take the first stab at an expansion. (By the way, there are numerous\nother expansions already in design - three that I know of and a few more that\nI've heard rumblings about.) As you will see, Richard never ceases to amaze.\nArabian Nights definitely takes the game in some new, and exciting,\ndirections.\n\n### Is Less More?\n\nBefore I jump into Arabian Nights, I'd like to discuss an issue that's been\nrampant in the threads and my email. The topic: Does Magic need expansions?\nThe sentiment was best summed up in a post in the thread to my column \"Getting\nAhead\" (where I talked about where Magic design is headed over the next year)\nby a poster named taintedlace:\n\n> Obviously it's in Wizards of the Coast's best interest to sell expansions.\n> That's where the money is. I don't even take offense at that. They've made a\n> great game, they have every right to milk it. In fact, name any successful\n> game and I can point to numerous expansions.\n>\n> My issue is do we, the players, need the expansions? I love Cosmic\n> Encounter, but I don't feel a need to buy any of the numerous add-on sets.\n> You know how many AD&D books I own? Three. I've only bought one Trivial\n> Pursuit game other than the Genus Edition and I regret buying it.\n>\n> Yes, Magic will make expansions. It's a hot game. The real question is do we\n> need them?\n\nLet me begin by stressing that I do not work for Wizards of the Coast. I am a\nfreelancer who writes for them. (Check out my Magic puzzles elsewhere on this\nvery site.) Fact is, Richard would be writing \"Making Magic\" if he had the\ntime to write a weekly column. But as someone who has designed a lot of games\nin his spare time I definitely understand where Richard is coming from.\n\nLet me explain. The idea behind Magic in Richard's own words is that \"Magic is\na game bigger than the box.\" The point of the trading card genre is to make\ngames where the responsibility of fine-tuning the details is left to the\nplayers. To do that, it's important that the players have a lot of choices.\nThe more cards that exist, the more choices are available. For example, let's\nsay I build a burn deck (a red-blue deck with a lot of spells and creatures\nthat do damage directly to the opponent). In a forty-card deck with one-third\nland and artifact mana, that leaves about twenty-six slots for creatures and\nspells.\n\nAs I explained last month in my column on tournament play (\"Tournament For\nEach Other\"), there is a growing trend to limit each card to four copies per\ndeck, which I am wholeheartedly supporting. Assuming we follow this guideline,\nwhat options does our deck have available? Here are the cards that deal damage\nthat are available to us.\n\nBlue Creature Bond Feedback Pirate Ship Power Leak Prodigal Sorcerer Psionic\nBlast Psychic Venom Volcanic Eruption\n\nRed Disintegrate Earthbind Earthquake Fireball Lightning Bolt Manabarbs Orcish\nArtillery Power Surge\n\nArtifacts Ankh of Mishra Black Vise Copper Tablet Dingus Egg Rod of Ruin\n\nI know at first blush this seems like a lot of choices. But as someone who has\nbuilt this deck, I can tell you it isn't. Many of the cards above are\nsituational at best. Volcanic Eruption requires your opponent to have\nmountains, while Earthbind requires them to have a flying creature. Others\nlike Creature Bond just aren't all that powerful. Very quickly, your options\nbecome limited. If no new cards ever entered the system, there would come a\npoint where I basically figured out how to maximize the deck. It would take a\nwhile, sure, but I would eventually get there. Then what?\n\nBuild a new deck is the answer I would expect to get. Sure, I could do that.\nBut eventually, I'd figure that out too. Meanwhile there are thousands of\nothers doing the same thing. And some of these people are going to start\nsharing information. What this means is that eventually, the players will\ncrack the game. They'll figure out what deck beats the other decks. At best,\nwe'll end up with a rock-paper-scissors environment where players get to guess\nwhich of the good decks will show up at any particular tournament.\n\nMagic is a game about discovery. If new things don't enter the system that\ndiscovery will be short-lived. With an ever-changing new influx of cards it\ncan last a long time, maybe even longer than us. For most games, expansions\nare for flavoring. They allow players to tweak their experience. For Magic,\nexpansions are its lifeblood. To reuse my shark metaphor from my column on the\ntrading card game genre (\"Booster Shots\"), Magic can only live if it keeps\nmoving. Its ever-changing nature is what defines it.\n\nI know this is hard to see now as Magic hasn't even had an expansion yet, but\nit's something that was built into the very premise of the trading card game.\nAs someone who has seen Arabian Nights, let me stress that it will definitely\nshake things up.\n\n### A Tale as Old as Time\n\nOkay fine, Magic needs expansions. What does Arabian Nights have to offer us?\nMany things, some of which I can talk about today and some of which you're\ngoing to have to wait and see (either in the other previews on the site or\nwhen the set finally releases later this month).\n\nFirst and foremost, let's talk about the theme. This one shouldn't be too much\nof a secret, but Arabian Nights borrows its flavor from a real world source.\nUnlike Limited Edition, which mostly ventures into new areas (yeah, yeah, with\na few influences from some famous fantasy sources), Arabian Nights takes its\ninspiration directly from the tales and legends of Persia (a.k.a. 1001 Arabian\nNights).\n\nRichard chose the Persian mythos because it is one that has always fascinated\nhim. When Peter (Adkison, Wizards' janitor/president) asked Richard to design\nMagic's first expansion, Richard liked the idea of going to an existing world.\nHe had just read a comic (Sandman #50 - the story was called \"Ramadan\" for\nthose that like these minute details) that focused on the Arabian tales, and\nhe felt it was a source material that hadn't been used too much in gaming.\n\nWhat does this mean? Aladdin, Ali Baba, Sinbad - they're all there. (Check out\nthe feature article to see what exactly Aladdin does.) In 78 cards, Richard\nexplores many facets of 1001 Arabian Nights. From places to people to things,\nthe set captures the heart and soul of what drew Richard to the mythos in the\nfirst place.\n\n### And Now for Something Completely Different\n\nThe set's dripping with flavor, but what does Arabian Nights have to offer in\nterms of game play? How is it going to shake up the status quo like I promised\nabove? I'm glad you asked.\n\nI think the number one defining quality of this set from a mechanical\nstandpoint is that Richard didn't limit himself to what had been done before.\nFor example, Arabian Nights has nine new lands. Want to know how many tap for\nmana? Four. What do the other ones do? Other things. Or how about this? Some\ncards don't always work when you use them. What do I mean? I mean, sometimes\nyou use them and they do their thing and sometimes you use them and they\ndon't. Why is this a good thing? You pay less. Get lucky and you'll get quite\na bit more for less. (And don't worry, they all give you other chances if your\nluck is bad.)\n\nThere's a card that can leave play and come back. There's a card that you want\nyour opponent to destroy. There's a card that changes control all by itself.\nThere's even a card that makes you stop the game and do something else. If you\nhave the slightest bit of curiosity of where else the game has to go, you have\nto check out Arabian Nights.\n\n### Preview to a Kill\n\nWait, wasn't I supposed to show you a preview card? I was, so let's get to it.\nI chose this card because it does something that no card in Magic has ever\ndone before (okay there is one card, but it's hard to use). Cards have danced\naround what this card does, but no card has ever done it with the simplicity\nof this card. Oh and by the way, it only has five words of text. Yes, this\npreview card is going to make your mouth drop open, and it's 20% the length of\nthis sentence!\n\nThe funny thing about this card is that it started as a way to demonstrate an\naspect of Persian life. Most of the cards from the set were inspired by\nfinding ways to mechanically represent things found in the world of 1001\nArabian Nights. In trying to find how to do it Richard stumbled upon a very\nelegant and exciting idea. But enough of my teasing, let's get to it. When you\nopen up Arabian Nights, you very well might be greeted by this card.\n\nYes, it's a Chaos Orb you don't have to throw. (Fine, fine, it can never\ndestroy more than one thing, but it never misses either.) And it can destroy\nanything. Anything! Well, except for 1/1 Wasp tokens created by The Hive (plus\ntwo new tokens made by cards in Arabian Nights), because tokens aren't cards.\nAnd you thought The Hive couldn't get any better? (By the way, I finally\nopened one - man that took a long time to get.)\n\nBefore I let you go for today, I have a few more little teasers about Arabian\nNights. Here are some cards you will see:\n\n* An artifact capable of killing artifacts, creatures, lands and enchantments and stopping the playing of instants, interrupts and sorceries\n* A land that can kill creatures\n* A 0/1 creature with a casting cost of that will be played\n* A card for your elephant deck\n* An artifact with a mana cost so high that the number cannot fit in one mana circle\n* A land that can produce any color of mana\n* A card that you can activate even if it's your opponent's card\n\nIn addition, here's a few names you'll see:\n\nEye for an Eye (and it's a white card!) Flying Carpet Library of Alexandria\nMetamorphosis Pyramids Singing Tree Unstable Mutation\n\nAnd finally a few new summon types:\n\nCamel Djinn Leper Marid Witches\n\nHave I piqued your interest yet? If not, what are you made of? Stone?\n\nThat's all I got for today.\n\nJoin me next week when I let you take a peek at another Arabian Nights goodie.\n\nUntil then, may you learn to admire the shark.\n\nMark Rosewater\n\nWhat is 'What If?' Week?\n\nIt's \"What If?\" Week here on magicthegathering.com, and in the spirit of\nPlanar Chaos, we're presenting you with a variety of \"What If?\" alternate\nreality scenarios. Some of them, like this one, explain the premise up-front;\nothers, Kelly Digges\u2019s feature article, encourage you to figure out the \"What\nIf?\" on your own. Ask Wizards and Card of the Day are in on the fun as well,\ncontaining implied \"What If?\" questions, but Arcana is \"normal\" \u2013 we didn't\nfeel alternate reality scenarios would play well in that format. Thanks for\nreading, and enjoy \"What If?\" Week!\n\nMaking Magic\n\n### Outlaws of Thunder Junction Vision Design Handoff Document, Part 1\n\nMark Rosewater\n\nOutlaws of Thunder Junction Vision Design Handoff Document, Part 1\n\nMaking Magic\n\n### Outlaws of the Land, Part 2\n\nMark Rosewater\n\nOutlaws of the Land, Part 2\n\nMaking Magic\n\n### Outlaws of the Land, Part 1\n\nMark Rosewater\n\nOutlaws of the Land, Part 1\n\n## Magic: The Gathering Footer\n\n### Find a store\n\n### Social\n\n  * Terms\n  * Code of Conduct\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Customer Support\n  * Cookies\n  * Fan Content Policy\n  * DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\n\u00a9 1993-2024 Wizards of the Coast LLC, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.
