However, recently\ndemonstrated dual-layer HDD media, which records data bits stacked atop each\nother in layers, coupled with multi-level heat-assisted recording, promises to\nat least double what current-generation HAMR technology is capable of. How\nabout a 60 TB HDD now and well over 120 TB in 10 to 15 years?\n\nResearch teams from NIMS, Seagate Technology, and Tohoku University have\ndemonstrated the feasibility of multi-level heat-assisted magnetic recording\n(HAMR) on dual-layer granular media, reports Acta Materialia.\n\n(Image credit: Acta Materialia/ScienceDirect)\n\nThe concept of multi-level magnetic recording for hard drives has been around\nfor some time, but its practical application has been hindered by the absence\nof suitable media that can store data at various levels. Researchers have\ntackled this challenge by creating a new type of granular media composed of\ntwo FePt-C nanogranular films separated by a Ru-C spacer layer with a cubic\ncrystal structure. This enables separate magnetic recording on each layer\nunder different magnetic fields and temperatures.\n\nBy adjusting the laser power and magnetic fields during the writing process,\nthe two FePT layers can be recorded independently, potentially doubling the\nareal density and HDD capacity without making significant changes in magnetic\nlayer materials.\n\nRegular HAMR-based HDDs use glass platters covered with a magnetic film, such\nas iron platinum alloy (FePt), that can be recorded when the film is heated\nwith a laser to its Curie temperature (the temperature at which the film\nalters its magnetic properties) and its magnetic coercivity is lowered.\n\nAs the name suggests, dual-layer granular media has two film layers, each with\ndifferent Curie temperatures and magnetocrystalline anisotropies. The\nresearchers say that such media can enable recording densities of well over 10\nTbit/in^2, meaning 10-platter hard drives with well over 120 TB capacities.\n\nThe researchers claim that magnetic measurements and simulations of heat-\nassisted magnetic recording have indicated that HAMR media can support three-\nlevel recording and might even be capable of four-level recording.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Yet, once the industry gets to bit patterned media, it might look\nback and reconsider multi-layer media as a means to increase recording density\nand HDD capacity.\n\nAnton Shilov\n\nFreelance News Writer\n\nAnton Shilov is a Freelance News Writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware US.

There are a number of applications where rust drives\nstill have significant advantages. Flash doesn't have great write tolerance.\nIts cost per terabyte is also more than spin drives. So for applications like\nvideo recording systems that have constant overwrite cycles and mid-low tier\narchival storage setups spin drives will remain viable for the foreseeable\nfuture. Those use cases have a huge need for capacity and that is why you are\nseeing a race in the spin drive market for bigger and bigger drives. The\nobvious latency and bandwidth differences between spin drives and SSD has all\nbut removed them from the main tier storage market in PCs but they are still\nalive and kicking in the NAS, Server and Security markets.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nIntel unveils new Xeon 6 branding for Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest\nprocessors \u2014 efficiency core models launch this quarter; performance-core\nmodels come soon after\n\nBy Paul AlcornApril 09, 2024\n\nIntel details Gaudi 3 at Vision 2024 \u2014 new AI accelerator sampling to partners\nnow, volume production in Q3\n\nBy Paul AlcornApril 09, 2024\n\nMicrosoft confident Snapdragon X Elite will defeat M3 MacBook Air laptops \u2014\nprepares demos to showcase this and will put the chip into Surface laptops\n\nBy Aaron KlotzApril 09, 2024\n\nGlobal PC Shipments recover to pre-pandemic levels \u2014 Q1 2024 sales show 8%\ngrowth over last year\n\nBy Roshan Ashraf ShaikhApril 09, 2024\n\nWindows 11's 24H2 block list contains more than just customization apps \u2014\nhardware ID, software, and driver blocks could keep you from getting the\nMicrosoft's AI-focused OS update\n\nBy Aaron KlotzApril 09, 2024\n\nCreality Launches a Color 3D Printer for its 10th Birthday Party\n\nBy Denise BertacchiApril 09, 2024\n\nMemory makers reportedly stop publishing contract DRAM prices following Taiwan\nearthquake \u2014 further price hikes are expected\n\nBy Anton ShilovApril 08, 2024\n\nGamerTech's Magma Glove is a heated compression glove targeted at competitive\ngamers\n\nBy Christopher HarperApril 08, 2024\n\nUS CHIPS and Science program puts R&D funding on hold \u2014 highlighting intense\ndemand that far exceeded initial expectations\n\nBy Anton ShilovApril 08, 2024\n\nRaspberry Pi RP2040 keeps track of who's winning and losing with this wireless\nLED scoreboard\n\nBy Ash HillApril 08, 2024\n\nSeagate BarraCuda 530 SSD breaks cover with 7,400 MB/s speeds \u2014 Still PCIe\n4.0, but looks like a significant upgrade over the previous 520\n\nBy Zhiye LiuApril 08, 2024\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
