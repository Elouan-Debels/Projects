They are typically made of cast iron or\naluminum.\n\nBut during an x-ray of the air compressors, officials discovered that gold had\nbeen carefully molded and \"concealed in the integral parts\" of the machinery.\n\nThe gold parts had been painted silver to match the machine parts, officials\ntold local news outlet, the South China Morning Post (SCMP).\n\nTwo air compressors were used to conceal the batch of suspected smuggled gold.\nCustoms and Excise Department Hong Kong\n\nActing Senior Superintendent Jason Lau Yuk-lung said it was the first time the\ndepartment had discovered smugglers using this method of hiding gold,\naccording to SCMP.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe gold was likely hidden to avoid Japan's import tariffs of around 10%, he\nsaid.\n\n\"Smugglers could have evaded about HK$8.4 million ($1 million) in taxes if the\nprecious metal was successfully smuggled into the country,\" Lau told the\noutlet.\n\nA 31-year-old man was arrested on April 3 in Hong Kong in connection with the\ncase, officials said in a statement. He has been released on bail pending\nfurther investigation.\n\nThe man was the director of a local company, but Lau said there was a\npossibility it was a shell company.\n\nAnyone found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo could be\nfined up to $2 million and imprisoned for up to seven years under Hong Kong\nlaws.\n\nGold is seen as a valuable commodity by investors, with many turning to the\nprecious metal as a more reliable alternative to stocks during economic\ndownturns.\n\nThe metal has been on a record-setting surge since February, with prices up by\nmore than 13% in 2024.\n\nIts stable value also makes it attractive to criminal networks, and gold is\none of the most commonly laundered assets.\n\nIts transformable nature makes it easy to break down into different forms,\ndisrupting trails and enabling criminal groups to trade anonymously \u2014 unless\ncaught by the Hong Kong Police.\n\nGet the latest Gold price here.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: How scrappers cash in on gold from your old computer\n\nGold Planes Hong Kong\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
