Credit: Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology\n\nWhile 3D printing has exploded in popularity, many of the plastic materials\nthese printers use to create objects cannot be easily recycled. While new\nsustainable materials are emerging for use in 3D printing, they remain\ndifficult to adopt because 3D printer settings need to be adjusted for each\nmaterial, a process generally done by hand.\n\nTo print a new material from scratch, one must typically set up to 100\nparameters in software that controls how the printer will extrude the material\nas it fabricates an object. Commonly used materials, like mass-manufactured\npolymers, have established sets of parameters that were perfected through\ntedious, trial-and-error processes.\n\nBut the properties of renewable and recyclable materials can fluctuate widely\nbased on their composition, so fixed parameter sets are nearly impossible to\ncreate. In this case, users must come up with all these parameters by hand.\n\nResearchers tackled this problem by developing a 3D printer that can\nautomatically identify the parameters of an unknown material on its own. Their\npaper is published in the journal Integrating Materials and Manufacturing\nInnovation.\n\nA collaborative team from MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), the U.S.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Center\nfor Scientific Research in Greece (Demokritos) modified the extruder, the\n\"heart\" of a 3D printer, so it can measure the forces and flow of a material.\n\nThese data, gathered through a 20-minute test, are fed into a mathematical\nfunction that is used to automatically generate printing parameters. These\nparameters can be entered into off-the-shelf 3D printing software and used to\nprint with a never-before-seen material.\n\nThe automatically generated parameters can replace about half of the\nparameters that typically must be tuned by hand. In a series of test prints\nwith unique materials, including several renewable materials, the researchers\nshowed that their method can consistently produce viable parameters.\n\nThis research could help to reduce the environmental impact of additive\nmanufacturing, which typically relies on nonrecyclable polymers and resins\nderived from fossil fuels.\n\n\"In this paper, we demonstrate a method that can take all these interesting\nmaterials that are bio-based and made from various sustainable sources and\nshow that the printer can figure out by itself how to print those materials.\nThe goal is to make 3D printing more sustainable,\" says senior author Neil\nGershenfeld, who leads CBA.\n\nHis co-authors include first author Jake Read a graduate student in the CBA\nwho led the printer development; Jonathan Seppala, a chemical engineer in the\nMaterials Science and Engineering Division of NIST; Filippos Tourlomousis, a\nformer CBA postdoc who now heads the Autonomous Science Lab at Demokritos;\nJames Warren, who leads the Materials Genome Program at NIST; and Nicole\nBakker, a research assistant at CBA.\n\n## Shifting material properties\n\nIn fused filament fabrication (FFF), which is often used in rapid prototyping,\nmolten polymers are extruded through a heated nozzle layer-by-layer to build a\npart. Software, called a slicer, provides instructions to the machine, but the\nslicer must be configured to work with a particular material.\n\nUsing renewable or recycled materials in an FFF 3D printer is especially\nchallenging because there are so many variables that affect the material\nproperties.\n\nFor instance, a bio-based polymer or resin might be composed of different\nmixes of plants based on the season. The properties of recycled materials also\nvary widely based on what is available to recycle.\n\n\"In 'Back to the Future,' there is a 'Mr. Fusion' blender where Doc just\nthrows whatever he has into the blender and it works [as a power source for\nthe DeLorean time machine]. That is the same idea here. Ideally, with plastics\nrecycling, you could just shred what you have and print with it. But, with\ncurrent feed-forward systems, that won't work because if your filament changes\nsignificantly during the print, everything would break,\" Read says.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the researchers developed a 3D printer and\nworkflow to automatically identify viable process parameters for any unknown\nmaterial.\n\nThey started with a 3D printer their lab had previously developed that can\ncapture data and provide feedback as it operates. The researchers added three\ninstruments to the machine's extruder that take measurements which are used to\ncalculate parameters.\n\nA load cell measures the pressure being exerted on the printing filament,\nwhile a feed rate sensor measures the thickness of the filament and the actual\nrate at which it is being fed through the printer.\n\n\"This fusion of measurement, modeling, and manufacturing is at the heart of\nthe collaboration between NIST and CBA, as we work to develop what we've\ntermed 'computational metrology,'\" says Warren.\n\nThese measurements can be used to calculate the two most important, yet\ndifficult to determine, printing parameters: flow rate and temperature. Nearly\nhalf of all print settings in standard software are related to these two\nparameters.\n\n## Deriving a dataset\n\nOnce they had the new instruments in place, the researchers developed a\n20-minute test that generates a series of temperature and pressure readings at\ndifferent flow rates. Essentially, the test involves setting the print nozzle\nat its hottest temperature, flowing the material through at a fixed rate, and\nthen turning the heater off.\n\n\"It was really difficult to figure out how to make that test work. Trying to\nfind the limits of the extruder means that you are going to break the extruder\npretty often while you are testing it. The notion of turning the heater off\nand just passively taking measurements was the 'aha' moment,\" says Read.\n\nThese data are entered into a function that automatically generates real\nparameters for the material and machine configuration, based on relative\ntemperature and pressure inputs. The user can then enter those parameters into\n3D printing software and generate instructions for the printer.\n\nIn experiments with six different materials, several of which were bio-based,\nthe method automatically generated viable parameters that consistently led to\nsuccessful prints of a complex object.\n\nMoving forward, the researchers plan to integrate this process with 3D\nprinting software so parameters don't need to be entered manually. In\naddition, they want to enhance their workflow by incorporating a thermodynamic\nmodel of the hot end, which is the part of the printer that melts the\nfilament.\n\nThis collaboration is now more broadly developing computational metrology, in\nwhich the output of a measurement is a predictive model rather than just a\nparameter. The researchers will be applying this in other areas of advanced\nmanufacturing, as well as in expanding access to metrology.\n\n\"By developing a new method for the automatic generation of process parameters\nfor fused filament fabrication, this study opens the door to the use of\nrecycled and bio-based filaments that have variable and unknown behaviors.\nImportantly, this enhances the potential for digital manufacturing technology\nto utilize locally sourced sustainable materials,\" says Alysia Garmulewicz, an\nassociate professor in the Faculty of Administration and Economics at the\nUniversity of Santiago in Chile who was not involved with this work.\n\nMore information: Jake Robert Read et al, Online Measurement for Parameter\nDiscovery in Fused Filament Fabrication, Integrating Materials and\nManufacturing Innovation (2024).
