Is Tesla planning to\ndouble the size of the battery pack at some point, as many fans have since\ngleefully speculated on Elon Musk's social media platform? Was the EV maker\nconcerned about the weight of the already hefty, 6,600-pound truck? Or was it\nstruggling to keep the battery pack cool? Is the cavernous space designed to\nbe pressurized, potentially enabling the truck to \"wade\" through water?\n\n## Blank Space\n\nIt's an especially strange decision considering that Tesla has already\nannounced an extremely bulky expansion battery pack that eats up a large\nportion of the truck's bed to push the truck's range to a more respectable 440\nmiles. It's unclear, however, if or when the extender will actually hit the\nmarket.\n\nThe existence of the range extender, though, does undermine the theory that\nTesla is looking to somehow double the range of future Cybertrucks by filling\nin the empty space.\n\nThe truck has already disappointed with its less-than-stellar claimed range of\nsignificantly less than 300 miles on a single charge. As Electrek points out,\nits 123 kWh makes it the smallest battery pack of any electric pickup on the\nmarket. Was Tesla trying to save money on an already extremely expensive-to-\nbuild vehicle?\n\nAnd in the real world, customers have found that after just 10,000 miles, the\nvehicle gets just over 200 miles on a single charge. In January, YouTube\naccount Out of Specs Cybertruck was only able to cover 254 miles on the\nhighway, well short of the truck's EPA-rated range of 320 miles.\n\nIn short, we still don't know why Tesla engineers opted to keep half of the\nbattery pack of the Cybertruck empty, and all we can do at this point is make\neducated guesses. Was it an engineering compromise, a long-term design\ndecision \u2014 or simply a matter of cutting costs?\n\nTesla isn't in the business of talking to the media, so we may never get a\ndefinite answer.\n\nMore on the Cybertruck: The Cybertruck Seems to Be Breaking Down at an\nIncredible Rate\n\nShare This Article\n\nUnsettled\n\nTesla Settles Suit Accusing Autopilot of Killing Driver Instead of Going to\nCourt\n\nApr 9, 5:00 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nSo Which Is It?\n\nExplosive Report Claims Tesla Is Giving Up on Cheaper Electric Car\n\nApr 5, 2:00 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nAny Takers?\n\nElon Musk Is Still Trying to Get Other Carmakers to License \"Full Self-\nDriving,\" But Not a Single One Has Taken Him Up On It\n\nApr 5, 12:35 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nTubes and Windmills\n\nNetherlands Builds Quarter-Mile Hyperloop Tube for Testing\n\nMar 27, 10:19 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
