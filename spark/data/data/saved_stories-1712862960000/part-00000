Until recently, the most carefully designed type\non computer screens was simply a placeholder for the final printed version.\nThe promise of \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d was really based on a little\nwhite lie. The type on the screen would of course be coarser, and there was no\nhope whatsoever of faithfully reproducing the subtleties of spacing. The\nscreens and rendering technology just couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nNow we are at a crossover point. A lot of people spend a lot of time reading\nfrom computer screens. Fortunately, the screens are a lot better (and still\nimproving), and innovations such as Microsoft\u2019s ClearType are pushing the\nenvelope of rendering technology. Even so, most of the fonts people read on-\nscreen are either holdovers from pre-digital print, or screen fonts\nexcellently tuned for last year\u2019s displays. The time is right for new fonts\ncarefully crafted for reading on today\u2019s screens, and those of the next few\nyears.\n\nMicrosoft has sensed this need and has responded by commissioning a suite of\nsix fonts optimized for ClearType. These fonts will be bundled with the\nupcoming Longhorn operating system, scheduled to ship in late 2006.\nMicrosoft\u2019s dominant market position ensures that a huge fraction of the\nletters projected onto eyeballs in the next decade will be renderings of these\nfonts.\n\nStephen Coles asked me to review these fonts for Typographica. Since I also\nwork on font rendering technology, having recently developed FontFocus, I have\npassionate opinions about the way fonts rendered into pixels should look. The\nfact that my technology competes with Microsoft\u2019s would of course disqualify\nme from writing as an objective journalism, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019ll get\nhere.\n\n### The Technology\n\nClearType first shipped in January 2000 with Microsoft Reader for Pocket PC\u2019s,\nto generally good reviews, and is now integrated with Windows XP. At its core\nis RGB sub-pixel rendering, which takes advantage of the fact that a 100 dpi\ncolor LCD panel is at heart a 300\u00d7100 dpi monochrome display with a color\nstripe filter. If you could get rid of the stripe filter, you\u2019d immediately\nhave much better resolution in the horizontal direction, which would be most\nuseful for near-vertical stems. Another possibility would be to leave the\nstripe filter on and send the same image you\u2019d send to a 300\u00d7100 dpi\nmonochrome display, but that would result in serious color fringing. The\nessence of ClearType is a clever filtering technique to get rid of most of the\ncolor fringing, while retaining at least some of the resolution enhancement.\n\nThe version Microsoft will ship with Longhorn has two major refinements.\nFirst, while the old ClearType demonstrated noticeable stairstepping on near-\nhorizontal features, now y-direction antialiasing smooths these out\nconsiderably. Ian Griffiths demonstrates this clearly.\n\nSecond, the old version of ClearType forced all positioning calculations to be\ndone in increments of one pixel, the same as TrueType, leading to somewhat\ncoarse spacing. The new version appears to have 1/6 pixel spacing accuracy,\nwhich looks quite a bit smoother. Further, designers don\u2019t have to carefully\nhint the metrics to get good spacing.\n\nBoth refinements are welcome improvements, but at heart the technology is\nstill much the same as shipped with XP.\n\nThe new fonts also make strong use of OpenType features such as contextual\nligatures, a freedom which has until recently not been available to designers\nof screen fonts.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting what technologies are missing, notably multiple masters\n(although Luc(as) de Groot designed Calibri as two weights of a Multiple\nMaster, the interpolations aren\u2019t shipped), and any kind of optical scaling\ntechnology. In fairness, I should point out that the nonlinear nature of\nClearType filtering does improve the robustness of very thin strokes, one of\nthe benefits of optical scaling.\n\n### Designing for Contrast\n\nOne of the most important design goals for antialiased screen fonts is\nachieving contrast. In the old days of monochrome rendering, contrast was\nexcellent, but diagonals were jaggy and curves were quite distorted.\nAntialiasing fixes these problems but makes the letters appear soft and\nblurry. ClearType improves matters somewhat, but certainly doesn\u2019t make the\ndifficult tradeoff simply vanish.\n\nContrast depends on many factors, among them specifics of the typeface design.\nIn particular, the exact orientation of a stroke matters a lot. Exact\nhorizontal strokes render very well (assuming the font is properly hinted),\nbut nearly-horizontal strokes don\u2019t. You often see a near-horizontal stroke as\nthe top of the lower bowl of the \u2018g\u2019, one of the glyphs most likely to be\nrendered feebly.\n\nIn addition to avoiding near-horizontals, several other principles apply to\ndesigning for ClearType:\n\n  * A slightly squarish \u2018o\u2019 renders with better contrast than a perfect oval.\n  * Serifs need to be robust, but a triangular or wedge shape renders just as well as a slab.\n  * Old-style serifs are much worse than modern or transitional (in the latter case, hints need to effectively convert them into modern).\n\nAt the same time, ClearType does a fantastic job rendering near-vertical\nstems, including vertical stems with subtle (Optima-like) modulations of\nweight, so these features are an excellent way to make designs more fluid and\nless constrained by the oppressive pixel grid of the pre-ClearType world.\n\n### The New Fonts\n\nMicrosoft commissioned six new fonts from designers working in close\ncollaboration with engineers in their Advanced Reading Technologies group.\nOverall, these are good, solid font designs with an emphasis on what works\nwell in ClearType. They share many characteristics: humanistic italics (as\nopposed to simply obliqued), a fairly high x-height (with the exception of\nConstantia), a large character set including both Greek and Cyrillic, and a\nuniform lack of near-horizontal strokes. All are slightly condensed in width.\n\nThese fonts are optimized for the screen, not for print. Aside from Constantia\nand Consolas, in general I would choose other fonts over the ones in the\nClearType suite. Of course, these fonts will see an awful lot of use in print,\nand they\u2019re not bad (vastly better than Arial, for sure). And for some\napplications, including mixing of Greek and Cyrillic, they may well be the\nbest fonts available.\n\n### Constantia\n\n#### John Hudson\n\nEverybody\u2019s favorite face will be Constantia by John Hudson. This one was\ndesigned to work well both in print and on the screen, for large bodies of\ntext such as journals. Even though it\u2019s a highly readable Roman font departing\nonly slightly from the classical model, it still manages to be fresh and new.\nIt takes some inspiration from Perpetua and Felicity (in fact, these are the\nonly two non-MS fonts mentioned in Now Read This, a booklet published by MS to\nintroduce the new ClearType fonts), but the triangular serifs bring to mind a\nchisel, and the font has enough calligraphic flavor to recall Palatino. The\nGreek and Russian also appear exceptionally strong to my eyes (but keep in\nmind I don\u2019t speak either).\n\n### Cambria\n\n#### Jelle Bosma\n\nLargely following in the footsteps of Georgia, Cambria will be the default\nfont in the next Microsoft Word, taking over the spot long owned by Times. It\nworks well as a screen font, but in print I don\u2019t find it very appealing.\nStroke contrast is low, and the vertical serifs (terminals of \u2018acfrsyz\u2019 and\n\u2018CEFGLSTZ\u2019) have a distractingly heavy wedge shape, reminiscent of a display\nfaces Renault and Dominante. Georgia, I think, did a better job of making the\nrobust features work within the classical letterform architecture.\n\nCambria\u2019s \u2018f\u2019 has a fairly narrow top, which means that traditional \u2018fi\u2019 and\n\u2018fl\u2019 ligatures would be stylistically inconsistent (especially given the\nrelatively loose spacing). Instead, designer Jelle Bosma used the contextual\nsubstitution features of OpenType to further narrow and lighten the top when\nset next to an ascender letter, or for that matter any glyph which sticks out\nabove the x-height line, such as a letter with a wide accent. This is a great\nsolution to a tricky problem.\n\n### Corbel\n\n#### Jeremy Tankard\n\nTo review Corbel, you want to ask, \u201chow does this font differ from Frutiger?\u201d,\nand \u201care those differences improvements or not?\u201d The answer to the first\nquestion is \u201cnot very much,\u201d which is a good thing because Frutiger is already\nnearly perfect for a sans of its class. In my experience, it\u2019s one of the\nabsolute best fonts for pure antialiased screen rendering.\n\nAs for the differences, thankfully they\u2019ve kept the ij dots square (unlike\nAdobe\u2019s Myriad), but the top of the bowl of the \u2018a\u2019 bends down rather than\nmeeting the vertical squarely (I guess that would have been seen as too much\nof an Adrian Frutiger trademark), the tail of the \u2018e\u2019 sticks out a bit far,\nand the \u2018u\u2019 has no tail, apparently in homage to Futura. These changes may\nmake the font a bit more distinctive, but certainly don\u2019t excite me. If you\u2019re\ndesigning for print, stick with the real thing.\n\n### Candara\n\n#### Gary Munch\n\nApparently one motivation for Candara was to show off ClearType\u2019s ability to\nrender subtle weight and slope variations in vertical stems. The result is a\nbit more like a toned-down Albertus than, say, Optima. Certain features, such\nas the top-heavy \u2018a\u2019 and the huge lower bowl on the \u2018g\u2019 turn me off.\n\n### Calibri\n\n#### Luc(as) de Groot\n\nOne of the fonts in this collection was strikingly familiar. In shooting for a\nsubtly rounded sans, designer Luc(as) de Groot somehow ended up with a font\nalmost identical to Computer Modern Sans (the cmssbx10 weight in particular).\nFortunately, he was able to improve the font in almost every respect: more\neven color, more refined features such as the tail of the R, and, in the one\ncase where the letter architectures significantly differ, a much better tail\nof the Q. I\u2019m not sure how much need there is for a rounded sans, but it warms\nmy heart to see an old friend updated so skillfully.\n\n### Consolas\n\n#### Luc(as) de Groot\n\nThe hidden gem in this collection is Consolas, the monospaced font also\ndesigned by Luc(as) de Groot. This font (hinted at in the Fonts for\nProgrammers discussion) is primarily intended for editing code and other\ncomputer-y applications, rather than traditional text uses, and as a\nmonospaced font faced many difficult restrictions. Overall, the design\nsucceeds brilliantly, and if I were publishing a computer book with monospaced\ncode listings, I\u2019d plead and beg to get this font in print.\n\nThe letter shapes and design are closely based on Lucida Console, but with\nsome of the quirky shapes (\u2018i\u2019 and \u2018l\u2019 in particular) replaced by the time-\ntested Courier versions (Microsoft\u2019s booklet, to its credit, does mention\nCourier by name). In overall color, Consolas feels more like a sans serif than\nLucida Console, with specific refinements such as a Frutiger-like \u2018a\u2019 (getting\nrid of Lucida Console\u2019s somewhat unfortunate tail) and a two-storey \u2018g\u2019. For\ncode, the all-important parentheses and braces have exactly the right shape\n(in Lucida Console, the parens look too much like half-circles, and Consolas\nalso makes the stems of the curly braces exactly vertical, which might not be\nas aesthetically pleasing, but does help differentiate them visually in code\nsettings).\n\nEach of these changes is fairly minor, but add up to a truly great monospaced\nfont.\n\nIn addition to the C initial-named typefaces, Microsoft\u2019s suite also includes\nthe new Japanese font Meiryo, the romaji of which is based on Verdana. It\nlooks like it\u2019s exceptionally well hinted and tuned for ClearType rendering,\nbut a full review really needs the eyes of someone fluent in Japanese to do it\njustice.\n\n\u00a9 Raph Levien\n\nSee also: Lucas de Groot talks about ClearType on Typeradio : The ClearType\nTeam (really bad video)\n\n\u2190 Prev Next \u2192\n\n#### Colophon\n\nFounded in 2002, Typographica is a review of typefaces and type books, with\noccasional commentary on fonts and typographic design.
