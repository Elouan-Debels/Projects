Experience the Pinnacle of Conformal Prediction\nExpertise: A Resource Crafted by a Pro.\n\nThis exceptional resource is the culmination of my PhD journey in Machine\nLearning, specializing in Conformal Prediction under the supervision of its\ncreator, Prof. Vladimir Vovk. Since 2015, I have painstakingly gathered these\ninvaluable resources, and upon completing my PhD (my thesis, \"Machine Learning\nfor Probabilistic Prediction,\" can be found in the \"Theses\" section), I am\nthrilled to share my expertise with the global machine learning community.\nImmerse yourself in a professionally curated collection that has been honed\nthrough years of dedication and experience.\n\nConformal Prediction goes back to Kolmogorov's notion of randomness described\nin two papers : 1) Andrei Kolmogorov (1968). \"Logical basis for information\ntheory and probability theory.\" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory\nIT-14:662-664 and 2) Andrei Kolmogorov (1983). \"Combinatorial foundations of\ninformation theory and the calculus of probabilities.\" Russian Mathematical\nSurveys 38(4):29-4.\n\nConformal Prediction has transcended its niche status in just a few years,\nexperiencing exponential growth thanks to the tireless efforts of renowned\nambassadors like Prof. Larry Wasserman in academia. It has taken center stage\nwith dedicated tracks at ICML2021 and ICML2022, as well as a captivating\nkeynote address 'Conformal Prediction in 2022' at NeurIPS2022 by Professor\nEmmanuel Candes. Furthermore, the main conference on Conformal Prediction\n(COPA) has enjoyed a successful run for over 11 years. Join the vibrant\ncommunity at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.\n\nAwesome Conformal Prediction takes pride in being cited within the highly\nacclaimed book on Machine Learning, \"Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced\nTopics\" by leading Google research scientist and best-selling Machine Learning\nauthor Kevin Murphy (boasting over 80K Google Scholar citations). Discover the\nexceptional quality of our resources, as acknowledged within the pages of the\nmachine learning 'bible'.\n\nConnect and Share the Excitement of Conformal Prediction\n\nI'm enthusiastically promoting the wonderful world of Conformal Prediction\n(because it truly is awesome) across various social media platforms, including\nLinkedIn and Twitter. You can find all my research on ResearchGate, and I\noccasionally share insights from the data science trenches in the industry on\nMedium.

Jordan:\n\n'Conformal Prediction ideas are THE answer to UQ (uncertainty quantification),\nI think it's the best I have seen - its simple, generalisable etc.' (ICML 2021\nUQ workshop). \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nOne the most influential statistics Professors - Larry Wasserman (Carnegie\nMellon):\n\n'So the beauty of the conformal thing is how simple it is to do it and how\ngeneral it is. So I think you know ideas that catch on, general ideas that are\npretty general and easy to implement that you can picture yourself using in\nreal applications are the reason that people using conformal prediction.'\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nProf. Emmanual Candes (Stanford) - Neurips 2022 key talk.\n\n'Conformal inference methods are becoming all the rage in academia and\nindustry alike. In a nutshell, these methods deliver exact prediction\nintervals for future observations without making any distributional assumption\nwhatsoever other than having iid, and more generally, exchangeable data.'\n\nhttps://slideslive.com/icml-2021/workshop-on-distributionfree-uncertainty-\nquantification\n\nKonrad Banachewicz, Principal Data Scientist | Kaggle Grandmaster | Author of the \"Kaggle book\" and \"Machine Learning using Tensorflow Cookbook\"\n\n'This repo is quite, quite spectacular indeed.'\n\nAn Impressive Endorsement: Conformal Prediction's Growing Appeal in Academia\nand Industry\n\nWhen highly respected professors from top research labs worldwide express\ntheir support for conformal prediction, it speaks volumes about its\ncredibility and potential.\n\nAs for its industry applications, Conformal Prediction has already been\npowering Microsoft Azure's primary anomaly detection offering for several\nyears. With exponential growth in academia during 2021-2022 and the increasing\navailability of open-source libraries, it's clear that the industry is poised\nfor a similar surge in adoption.\n\n\ud83d\udce2\ud83d\udce2 Attention, industry professionals: The revolution in Uncertainty\nQuantification, Probabilistic Prediction, and Forecasting is here, and it's\nmaking waves! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Embrace the future of machine learning with Conformal\nPrediction.
