(Nhat V.\nMeyer/Bay Area News Group)\n\nBy Kate Talerico | ktalerico@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nPUBLISHED: April 14, 2024 at 6:15 a.m. | UPDATED: April 15, 2024 at 1:17 a.m.\n\nFor over a decade, developer Forrest Linebarger has tried to build new\nmultifamily housing on two half-acre parcels in Los Altos Hills. The city has\ndone all it can to stop him.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Housing |\n\nThis map reveals where supersized \u2018builder\u2019s remedy\u2019 projects could be coming\n\n  * Housing |\n\nState green lights Cupertino\u2019s housing plan for more than 4,500 new homes\n\n  * Housing |\n\nDevelopers of two new East Bay housing developments hear that affordability is\nkey\n\n  * Housing |\n\nAffordable San Jose homes may rise at Willow Glen restaurant site\n\n  * Housing |\n\nLetters: A bad start | Developers\u2019 benefit | Support disabled | Cleanup detail | Travesty of justice | Not self-defense\n\nThen early last year, he employed a largely untested tool \u2014 the builder\u2019s\nremedy. The provision penalizes cities that have failed to get state approval\nfor their plans to accommodate new residential growth. Without the state\u2019s\nsign-off on that plan, known as the housing element, developers can skirt\nlocal zoning codes and propose projects far taller and denser than might\ntypically be allowed \u2014 so long as 20% of the units are rented at affordable\nrates to qualifying tenants.\n\nLinebarger was among the first Bay Area developers to use the provision. His\nproposal: two 44-unit senior housing projects that would be a stark contrast\nto the multimillion-dollar homes on leafy Mora Drive.\n\nAnd yet, over a year later, Linebarger\u2019s project is still far from breaking\nground. He\u2019s not alone.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, at least 98 builder\u2019s remedy projects totaling\nmore than 13,000 units have been proposed across 18 Bay Area cities and\ncounties that lacked state-certified housing elements, according to a Bay Area\nNews Group survey of local officials and planning documents throughout the\nregion. The exact number of builder\u2019s remedy projects is unclear: The state\ndoesn\u2019t keep a tally, and it\u2019s likely developers are using the rule in other\ncities as well.\n\nThe projects range from three towers that would loom 421 feet over a quiet\nMenlo Park neighborhood to 255 new apartments and homes, and a hotel, at the\nMountain Winery in the hills west of Saratoga. If built, the projects would\ntransform their communities, bringing much-needed housing to affluent cities\nthat have most resisted new housing \u2014 and yet, none of them have gone forward.\n\nDespite the flurry of headline-grabbing applications and the subsequent uproar\nfrom suburbanites that the builder\u2019s remedy would \u201cManhattan-ize\u201d their towns,\nthe provision has proven to be far from a silver bullet for developers.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, the builder\u2019s remedy has been a godsend,\u201d Linebarger said. \u201cBut\nthe city is going to try to make this as expensive and long and difficult as\npossible.\u201d\n\nState officials say the Bay Area needs to add 441,000 homes by 2031 to solve a\ndecades-long housing shortage.\n\nAsk any housing advocate, developer or land use planner as to why no builder\u2019s\nremedy projects have been yet approved, and they\u2019ll tell you the answer is the\nsame as why California hasn\u2019t produced enough housing: cities aren\u2019t giving up\nlocal control without a fight. At stake, they say, is the character of their\ncommunities. Some of the strongest opposition has come from the region\u2019s\nwealthiest and Whitest enclaves.\n\n\u201cIf an agency wants to drag its feet, there are ways to do that \u2014 and they\nare,\u201d said Bryan Wenter, a land use attorney with Miller Starr Regalia, a\nWalnut Creek law firm working on 25 builder\u2019s remedy projects around the\nstate.\n\nCities are exploiting several legal gray areas in the law, he said, resulting\nin lengthy project processing and in some cases litigation slowing\nimplementation of the builder\u2019s remedy. In the end, though, these battles \u2014\nand some of the legislation they have inspired \u2014 could end up serving to\nfurther strengthen the builder\u2019s remedy.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately a lot of these projects are going to end up in lawsuits and\ntake more time,\u201d said Orville Power, managing partner of Mana Investments,\nwhich has builder\u2019s remedy projects in San Jose and Gilroy. \u201cUltimately it\nshould help build more housing \u2014 but it\u2019s not going to be quick.\u201d\n\nAn experiment in state housing law\n\nThough the builder\u2019s remedy has been on the books since the 1990s, the\nprovision went untested until last year. As cities\u2019 eight-year housing plans\ncame due, talk of using the obscure provision began swirling on social media\namong academics and housing advocates. Eventually, developers caught on.\n\nOne of the first to try out the builder\u2019s remedy was Cedar Street Partners,\nwhich applied to build affordable housing in the affluent Southern California\ncity of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. The city rejected the application, asserting\nthat the builder\u2019s remedy didn\u2019t apply there because it had \u201cself-certified\u201d\nits housing element.\n\nThat argument has been used by a number of cities, including Los Altos Hills,\nwhich passed resolutions declaring their housing elements in compliance with\nstate law, even though they hadn\u2019t yet received the official sign-off from\nstate housing regulators.\n\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge ended up in court against the nonprofit California\nHousing Defense Fund, and in March, a Los Angeles court ruled the city had to\naccept Cedar Street Partners\u2019 80-home project. Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose\nadministration has been cracking down on cities trying to evade housing law,\ndescribed the ruling as a \u201cwarning to other NIMBY jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nBut while that loophole may be closed for now, others remain open.\n\nIn Los Altos Hills, the city may not have any say over whether Linebarger\u2019s\nsenior housing project is compatible with the existing zoning \u2014 but officials\nare trying to kill it by citing concerns that it could overwhelm the fire\ndepartment, he claims. Los Altos Hills City Manager Peter Pirnejad said the\ncity is \u201cactively processing all received applications in a timely manner\u201d and\nthat builder\u2019s remedy projects must still \u201cadhere to applicable standards,\nincluding stringent adherence to building code requirements.\u201d\n\nOther applicants say they\u2019ve had builder\u2019s remedy applications deemed\n\u201cincomplete\u201d by a city for things as small as typos, or been required to file\nexcessive environmental studies.\n\nChris Elmendorf, a UC Davis professor and expert on the law, has described the\nLa Ca\u00f1ada decision as a turning point between two eras of the builder\u2019s\nremedy.\n\nIn the first era, aggressive cities refused to process builder\u2019s remedy\nprojects arguing they had compliant housing elements, even if state regulators\nhadn\u2019t greenlit them yet, and said they were thus not subject to the remedy.\nIn the next, cities may concede they\u2019re subject to the builder\u2019s remedy, but\nwill drag out such projects for years with studies and conditions of approval.\n\nA group of California lawmakers wants to make sure that second era is short-\nlived. Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, this year proposed\nlegislation to clear up some of the gray areas in the builder\u2019s remedy and\ngive the provision some guardrails.\n\nAs a perk to developers, the bill would reduce the number of affordable units\nthat builder\u2019s remedy projects must set aside, to 10% from 20%, making it\neasier for a project to pencil out financially. As a nod to housing-hesitant\ncities, it would also limit projects to two or three times the current zoned\ndensities to prevent developers from proposing the mega-projects that generate\nthe most controversy.\n\nBut some housing advocates say the builder\u2019s remedy in its current form is\nalready a success, even if it hasn\u2019t generated new units yet, and that such\namendments could water down the provision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to measure the success of the builder\u2019s remedy only by\nconstruction,\u201d said Louis Mirante, vice president of housing policy for Bay\nArea Council. For one thing, no legislative fix is going to solve rising labor\nand construction costs and high borrowing rates, which are holding up some of\nthe projects, he said.\n\nBeyond the economic headwinds they face, housing developers say that behind\nthe scenes they are using the builder\u2019s remedy to gain leverage over cities,\nthreatening mega-projects to broker deals for scaled-down projects. By taking\naway developers\u2019 ability to propose large projects, the state could take away\na powerful bargaining chip, some developers say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had cities say, \u2018We can work hard to provide you an alternative path\n(to approval.)\u2019 Those discussions are a result of the new leverage that state\nlaws have provided to housing developers,\u201d said Gary Johnson, a partner with\nAcclaim Companies in Menlo Park, which has proposed two builder\u2019s remedy\nprojects in Palo Alto totaling 578 units.\n\nIn the upscale Marin County community of Belvedere, developer Thompson Dorfman\nhad for years been seeking to build 40 units near the waterfront. In January,\nthe company submitted a builder\u2019s remedy project with 70 units, telling the\ncity that if it didn\u2019t proceed with the original application, it would have\n\u201cno choice but to pursue the builder\u2019s remedy project.\u201d The city acquiesced \u2014\nin January, it cleared the path for the smaller project to move forward.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who want to see builder\u2019s remedy projects go through,\nand some who believe it\u2019s a tool to get cities to adopt compliant housing\nelements,\u201d Mirante said. \u201cFor me, the most important part of the builder\u2019s\nremedy is: Does it build more homes?\u201d\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share a free article with a friend\n\n###### GIFT THIS ARTICLE\n\n###### What is article sharing?\n\nSubscribers are entitled to 10 gift sharing articles each month.
