The Musk-owned\nautomotive company faces declining demand for electric vehicles and\nintensifying challenges in the Chinese market. Even typically optimistic\nanalysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives were harsh, calling Tesla's most recent\nquarter a \"trainwreck.\"\n\nMirroring Tesla's stock decline, Musk's net worth has plummeted over 10\npercent in the past year. This drop has dethroned him from the top spot on the\nworld's richest list, pushing him down to fourth place. Moreover, several\nCybertruck owners have reported issues with their recently purchased trucks on\nthe Tesla Owners' Club forum.\n\n## X prioritizes stability after user exodus and revenue drop\n\nIn the wake of these setbacks, the once-unassailable tech wunderkind seems to\nbe focusing on shoring up his other ventures to mitigate further financial\nlosses. On the social media front, Musk's vision for X appears to be a return\nto Twitter's pre-acquisition identity, a simpler platform reminiscent of the\n\"plain old Twitter\" days.\n\n> X is turning back to Twitter... pic.twitter.com/IaIfqKyQU2\n>\n> \u2014 mouad (@Antidote42) December 25, 2023\n\n\"I think the strategy, as it's unfolding right now, is going back to the\nbasics,\" Gabor Cselle, a former project manager on Twitter's trends team, told\nBusiness Insider. \"I think the whole thing about making X something\ndramatically different and reinventing the wheel hasn't really happened, so\nwe're seeing a return to the basics.\"\n\nMusk's social media platform has seen the return of a status-based system for\nawarding blue checkmarks to accounts with many verified followers. According\nto CNN's Oliver Darcy, the move reflects the X owner's desperation to lure\nhigh-profile users back to the platform.\n\nFollowing significant staff reductions, including deep cuts to the team\nresponsible for user safety, since Musk acquired the company in 2022, there\nare signs of a renewed commitment to platform safety. As part of these\nefforts, the company is establishing a new content moderation centre in Texas\nand appointing two new senior executives to lead moderation initiatives.\n\n## Can X lure advertisers back after hate speech surge?\n\nDavid Camp, co-founder of the brand consultancy Metaforce, suggested to\nBusiness Insider that these actions are strategies to regain advertisers'\ninterest in the platform. This comes after a concerning decrease in\nadvertisers due to a surge in hateful content on the site.\n\nAccording to Camp, Musk disregarded conventional business practices when he\nacquired the formerly prominent social media platform. Camp suggests Musk\nwasn't interested in the limitations imposed by an advertising-based model,\nwhich typically requires companies to prioritise stability and predictability\nto attract advertisers.\n\nWith declining revenue and user engagement, Camp believes it's understandable\nthat the platform is attempting to reverse course. However, it is still being\ndetermined whether these efforts will prove effective. While core users appear\nto be sticking with the platform, Variety reported last fall that X's global\nuser base has shrunk by 15% since the acquisition by Musk.\n\nEven the 52-year-old tech mogul has admitted to a significant decline in\nadvertising revenue, with a drop of roughly 50 percent since he took control\nof the platform. \"Regardless of little tactical changes they make to the\nplatform, with the blue checks or claims of more moderation, from a marketer's\nperspective and a brand-building perspective, it's just lip service,\" Camp\nsaid.\n\n\"Every time he opens his mouth and says something controversial \u2014 which he\nrelishes \u2014 it further reinforces the perception of Twitter as an unreliable ad\npartner, which is why they continue to lose revenue and will continue to have\na hard time attracting advertisers.\"\n\nRead more\n\nTesla Cybertruck 'Crash' Debut: Did Elon Musk Rush Its Release?\n\nApple iCar Release No Longer Happening?
