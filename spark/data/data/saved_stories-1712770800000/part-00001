According to a statement from the University\nof Edinburgh, the physicist passed \"peacefully at home on Monday 8 April\nfollowing a short illness.\"\n\n\u201cBesides his outstanding contributions to particle physics, Peter was a very\nspecial person, a man of rare modesty, a great teacher and someone who\nexplained physics in a very simple and profound way,\" Fabiola Gianotti,\ndirector general at CERN and former leader of one of the experiments that\nhelped discover the Higgs particle in 2012, told The Guardian. \"An important\npiece of CERN\u2019s history and accomplishments is linked to him. I am very\nsaddened, and I will miss him sorely.\u201d\n\nThe Higgs boson is a manifestation of the Higgs field, an invisible entity\nthat pervades the Universe. Interactions between the Higgs field and particles\nhelp provide particles with mass, with particles that interact more strongly\nhaving larger masses. The Standard Model of Particle Physics describes the\nfundamental particles that make up all matter, like quarks and electrons, as\nwell as the particles that mediate their interactions through forces like\nelectromagnetism and the weak force. Back in the 1960s, theorists extended the\nmodel to incorporate what has become known as the Higgs mechanism, which\nprovides many of the particles with mass. One consequence of the Standard\nModel's version of the Higgs boson is that there should be a force-carrying\nparticle, called a boson, associated with the Higgs field.\n\nDespite its central role in the function of the Universe, the road to\npredicting the existence of the Higgs boson was bumpy, as was the process of\ndiscovering it. As previously reported, the idea of the Higgs boson was a\nconsequence of studies on the weak force, which controls the decay of\nradioactive elements. The weak force only operates at very short distances,\nwhich suggests that the particles that mediate it (the W and Z bosons) are\nlikely to be massive. While it was possible to use existing models of physics\nto explain some of their properties, these predictions had an awkward feature:\njust like another force-carrying particle, the photon, the resulting W and Z\nbosons were massless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / Schematic of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nDaniel Dominguez/CERN\n\nOver time, theoreticians managed to craft models that included massive W and Z\nbosons, but they invariably came with a hitch: a massless partner, which would\nimply a longer-range force. In 1964, however, a series of papers was published\nin rapid succession that described a way to get rid of this problematic\nparticle. If a certain symmetry in the models was broken, the massless partner\nwould go away, leaving only a massive one.\n\nThe first of these papers, by Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Robert Brout, proposed the\nnew model in terms of quantum field theory; the second, by Higgs (then 35),\nnoted that a single quantum of the field would be detectable as a particle. A\nthird paper, by Gerald Guralnik, Carl Richard Hagen, and Tom Kibble, provided\nan independent validation of the general approach, as did a completely\nindependent derivation by students in the Soviet Union.\n\nAt that time, \"There seemed to be excitement and concern about quantum field\ntheory (the underlying structure of particle physics) back then, with some\npeople beginning to abandon it,\" David Kaplan, a physicist at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, told Ars. \"There were new particles being regularly produced at\naccelerator experiments without any real theoretical structure to explain\nthem. Spin-1 particles could be written down comfortably (the photon is\nspin-1) as long as they didn\u2019t have a mass, but the massive versions were\nconfusing to people at the time. A bunch of people, including Higgs, found\nthis quantum field theory trick to give spin-1 particles a mass in a\nconsistent way. These little tricks can turn out to be very useful, but also\ngive the landscape of what is possible.\"\n\n> \"It wasn't clear at the time how it would be applied in particle physics.\"\n\nIronically, Higgs' seminal paper was rejected by the European journal Physics\nLetters. He then added a crucial couple of paragraphs noting that his model\nalso predicted the existence of what we now know as the Higgs boson. He\nsubmitted the revised paper to Physical Review Letters in the US, where it was\naccepted. He examined the properties of the boson in more detail in a 1966\nfollow-up paper.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n16\n\nJennifer Ouellette Jennifer is a senior reporter at Ars Technica with a\nparticular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from\nphysics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV\nseries.
