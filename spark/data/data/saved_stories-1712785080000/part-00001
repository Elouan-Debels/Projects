For more details on what io_uring brings to\nthe table, please see the chapter What is io_uring?.\n\n## About\u00b6\n\nThis io_uring guide was created by Shuveb Hussain, who is also the author of\nthe Linux-focused blog, unixism.net. You can follow me on Twitter where my\nposts are mainly tech-related with a focus on Linux, performance, scalability\nand cloud.\n\n## Contributing\u00b6\n\nThe source code repository for this guide is here on Github. Please send me\npull requests should you want to contribute. If you find any bugs in either\nthe documentation or the included source code examples, please raise an issue\non GitHub. The repository for the example programs is maintained separately.\nPlease see details below.\n\n## Source code for examples\u00b6\n\nSource code for all example programs in this guide are available on Github. If\nyou find bugs in the examples, please raise issues on Github. I want to keep\nthese examples simple and to the point. I many not merge pull requests that\nadd features for that reason. Pull requests that fix bugs are welcome.\n\n## Documentation\u00b6\n\nIntroduction\n\n  * Asynchronous Programming Under Linux\n  * What is io_uring?\n  * The Low-level io_uring Interface\n\nTutorial\u00b6\n\n  * liburing Examples\n  * cat with liburing\n  * cp with liburing\n  * A web server with liburing\n  * Probing supported capabilities\n  * Linking requests\n  * Fixed buffers\n  * Submission Queue Polling\n  * Register an eventfd\n\nliburing Reference\u00b6\n\n  * liburing Reference\n  * SQE: Submission Queue Entry\n  * CQE: Completion Queue Event\n  * Supported capabilities\n  * Setup and tear down\n  * Submission\n  * Completion\n  * Advanced usage\n\nio_uring Reference\u00b6\n\n  * io_uring Reference\n  * io_uring_setup\n  * io_uring_enter\n  * io_uring_register\n\nChangelog\n\n  * Changelog\n\n# Indices and tables\u00b6\n\n  * Index\n\n  * Module Index\n\n  * Search Page\n\n# Lord of the io_uring\n\n### Navigation\n\nIntroduction\n\n  * Asynchronous Programming Under Linux\n  * What is io_uring?\n  * The Low-level io_uring Interface\n\nTutorial\n\n  * liburing Examples\n  * cat with liburing\n  * cp with liburing\n  * A web server with liburing\n  * Probing supported capabilities\n  * Linking requests\n  * Fixed buffers\n  * Submission Queue Polling\n  * Register an eventfd\n\nliburing Reference\n\n  * liburing Reference\n  * SQE: Submission Queue Entry\n  * CQE: Completion Queue Event\n  * Supported capabilities\n  * Setup and tear down\n  * Submission\n  * Completion\n  * Advanced usage\n\nio_uring Reference\n\n  * io_uring Reference\n  * io_uring_setup\n  * io_uring_enter\n  * io_uring_register\n\nChangelog\n\n  * Changelog\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * Documentation overview\n\n    * Next: Asynchronous Programming Under Linux\n\n### Quick search\n\n\u00a92020, Shuveb Hussain. | Powered by Sphinx 3.0.3 & Alabaster 0.7.12 | Page source\n\n", "frontpage": false}
