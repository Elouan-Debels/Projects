But is this true at every level of IQ?\n\nAccording to a widespread view, the answer is no. Beyond a certain point -\nmost often, an IQ of 120 - the benefits of IQ supposedly plateau, and having a\nhigher IQ is no longer associated with any greater achievement. This idea is\nknown as the threshold hypothesis.\n\nThe threshold hypothesis is well known and well loved - but it also appears to\nbe false. The graph below comes from one of the largest studies to address\nthis issue. It shows the accomplishments of people identified at age 13 as\namong the top 1% in mathematical ability. (Mathematical ability is tightly\ncorrelated with IQ.) As you can see, greater ability predicts higher\nachievement, even at these lofty heights.\n\nShare\n\nThe graph comes from a review paper by Kimberley Robertson, Stijn Smeets,\nDavid Lubinski, and Camilla Benbow. I\u2019ve posted the abstract below. Note that\nthe paper also looked at whether interests and lifestyle preferences predict\noccupational choices - and sex differences in occupational choices - among the\ntop 1%. (They do.)\n\n> The assertion that ability differences no longer matter beyond a certain\n> threshold is inaccurate. Among young adolescents in the top 1% of\n> quantitative reasoning ability, individual differences in general cognitive\n> ability level and in specific cognitive ability pattern (that is, the\n> relationships among an individual\u2019s math, verbal, and spatial abilities)\n> lead to differences in educational, occupational, and creative outcomes\n> decades later. Whereas ability level predicts the level of achievement,\n> ability pattern predicts the realm of achievement. Adding information on\n> vocational interests refines prediction of educational and career choices.\n> Finally, lifestyle preferences relevant to career choice, performance, and\n> persistence often change between ages 25 and 35. This change results in sex\n> differences in preferences, which likely have relevance for understanding\n> the underrepresentation of women in careers that demand more than full-time\n> (40 hours per week) commitment.\n\n  * You can request a free copy of the Robertson paper here.\n\n  * For more evidence against the threshold hypothesis, see this paper (request a free copy here).\n\n  * And for a counterpoint, see this paper (free copy here).\n\nI love writing the Nature-Nurture-Nietzsche Newsletter - but it\u2019s a lot of\nwork!

Everyone is\nfamiliar with the term, and everyone seems to have an opinion on the topic.\nBut like many ideas in psychology, IQ is the subject of a lot of\nmisunderstandings and misinformation. Some believe that IQ tests are basically\nmeaningless - that they don\u2019t measure intelligence in any real sense or tell\nus anything about IQ-test takers except how good they are at taking IQ tests.\nOthers go further, arguing that IQ research is malign pseudoscience aimed only\nat justifying discrimination.\n\nRead full story\n\n## Sex Differences in Work Preferences, Life Values, and Personal Views\n\nSteve Stewart-Williams\n\n\u00b7\n\nJan 10\n\nWhat determines men and women\u2019s life outcomes - the professions they go into,\nthe goals they set themselves, the time they devote to career versus family?\nThe short answer, of course, is \u201cLots of things.\u201d But according to a recent\npaper by David Lubinski and colleagues, among the most important contributors\nare people\u2019s work preferences, life values, and personal views. And because\nthese things aren\u2019t evenly distributed across the sexes, they may help to\nexplain certain sex differences in people\u2019s life outcomes.\n\nRead full story\n\n5 Likes\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Testing the IQ Threshold Hypothesis\n\nwww.stevestewartwilliams.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\n12 Things Everyone Should Know About IQ\n\nThere's a lot of IQ misinformation out there\n\nJan 27 \u2022\n\nSteve Stewart-Williams\n\n51\n\nShare this post\n\n#### 12 Things Everyone Should Know About IQ\n\nwww.stevestewartwilliams.com\n\nSex Differences in Work Preferences, Life Values, and Personal Views\n\n...and how they shape men and women's lives\n\nJan 10 \u2022\n\nSteve Stewart-Williams\n\n34\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Sex Differences in Work Preferences, Life Values, and Personal Views\n\nwww.stevestewartwilliams.com\n\n5\n\n12 Things Everyone Should Know About Personality\n\nDispatches from one of the most successful branches of psychology\n\nFeb 24 \u2022\n\nSteve Stewart-Williams\n\n29\n\nShare this post\n\n#### 12 Things Everyone Should Know About Personality\n\nwww.stevestewartwilliams.com\n\n13\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Steve Stewart-Williams\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
