By using a flag for a language, you may confuse or even\noffend users.\n\nConsider these examples:\n\n### English\n\nArguably, the flag of England is the most appropriate flag to represent the\nEnglish language. But how recognizable is the English flag?\n\nHowever, often the British flag is used to represent English. Within Britain,\nother languages other than English are spoken \u2014 including Welsh and Scottish\nGaelic.\n\nOften the United States flag is used to represent English \u2014 and while the USA\nhas far more English speakers than Britain, English does not originate from\nthe United States.\n\nFurthermore, English is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world:\nit is spoken in countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand,\nSingapore and South Africa to name just a few. How will users from these\ncountries react to an English, British or American flag?\n\n### Spanish\n\nThe Spanish flag is often used to represent the Spanish language.\n\nHowever, in Mexico alone there are more Spanish speakers than Spain.\n\nSpanish is also spoken in numerous other countries including Argentina,\nColombia, Peru and Venezuela. There are also a large number of Spanish\nspeakers in the United States \u2014 including Puerto Rico. Is a Spanish flag the\nbest choice for users outside of Spain?\n\n### French\n\nThe French flag is an obvious choice to represent the French language. While\nmost French speakers live in France, French is spoken in many other countries\n\u2014 including Belgium, Ivory Coast and Switzerland.\n\nFrench is spoken in Switzerland along with other languages \u2014 Italian, German\nand Romansh.\n\nSimilarly, in Belgium French is also spoken with other languages \u2014 mostly\nFlemish/Dutch and German in a small minority.\n\nHow will users from other French-speaking countries \u2014 Belgium or Switzerland\nespecially \u2014 feel about the use of the French flag?\n\n### Hindi\n\nHindi is the most popular language in India with over 400 million speakers,\nbut it is only one of 22 official languages of India. There also are over 80\nmillion speakers of Bengali in India and over 70 million speakers of both\nTelugu and Marathi.\n\nMany other languages share similar issues when combined into a single flag \u2014\nincluding Arabic, German and Portuguese. Flags are specific to countries:\nlanguages often cross borders.\n\nIf you are targeting users from a specific country, then flags are highly\nappropriate. However, if you\u2019re targeting users of a specific languages, think\nagain before using flags.\n\n### Further reading (external sites)\n\n  * Flag as a symbol of language \u2013 stupidity or insult?\n  * You should never use flags for language choice\n  * Of Flags and Languages: A Live 8 Case Study\n  * Indicating language choice: flags, text, both, neither?\n\n## 35 thoughts on \u201cWhy flags do not represent languages\u201d\n\n  1. Jm says:\n\nAugust 26, 2012 at 4:46 pm\n\nThe flag of a language should be of the language\u2019s founding country, or\ncontinent. Not of the country with the the most speakers.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Andrew says:\n\nJuly 20, 2013 at 5:46 am\n\nWhen is a language considered to be founded? What about languages that\ndeveloped across borders, or evolved among a diaspora, or whose known founding\ncountry has ceased to exist? What is the flag of the European continent?\n(Hint: It isn\u2019t the flag of the EU.) The African continent? (Not the African\nUnion either.) The Asian, North American,and South American continents? I\u2019m\nsure you could answer these questions, but I doubt in a way that\u2019s unambiguous\nand apolitical.\n\nReply\n\n    2. Elijah says:\n\nDecember 10, 2015 at 4:02 am\n\nI agree 100%!! The flag of England should be used to represent the English\nLanguage!\n\nReply\n\n    3. RM says:\n\nJune 2, 2022 at 1:59 am\n\nI\u2019m guessing you are from England?\n\nReply\n\n    4. RM says:\n\nJune 2, 2022 at 2:00 am\n\nI\u2019m guessing you are from England? BTW Languages don\u2019t originate from places,\nthey originate from the mouths of our parents.\n\nReply\n\n  2. Luke says:\n\nNovember 27, 2012 at 12:11 pm\n\nThanx for this interesting article\n\nReply\n\n  3. Craig says:\n\nJune 8, 2013 at 12:48 pm\n\nSome interesting points but ultimately I disagree. I find that spotting the\nlanguage change options is often a tricky task if it is just text based, a\nnice colourful flag however draws my attention. True, as a Brit it can make my\nblood get slightly warm to see the American flag used for such a purpose but\nthink of it in terms of the English being American English, you can expect a\nfew minor words being differently spelled and that is why it is American, and\nits no problem. The British and US flags are instantly recognisable symbols of\nEnglish.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Olivier says:\n\nOctober 27, 2014 at 7:16 pm\n\nThere are 6909 living languages in the world and only 195 countries.\n\nUsing flags, how would you deal with Democratic Republic of the Congo or China\nwhere several living languages originated ?\n\nOf course flags might do the trick for your projects but the general\nrecommendation not to use flags to designate languages is founded.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Rob says:\n\nJuly 24, 2013 at 2:28 pm\n\nCompletely agree with Craig. Who cares if Mexico has more Spanish speakers or\nthat English did not originate with my friends on the other side of the\nAtlantic? Everyone knows what it means and that\u2019s all that matters. I note you\ndon\u2019t suggest a better system.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Rob says:\n\nJuly 24, 2013 at 2:30 pm\n\nAh apologies, I see you did here; http://flagsarenotlanguages.com/blog/best-\npractice-for-presenting-languages/\n\nbut in terms of design, that looks much worse. Do you have numbers to back up\nwhether it works better?\n\nReply\n\n  6. Leonardo P. says:\n\nFebruary 21, 2014 at 4:06 am\n\nI am Brazilian, and when I see the Portugal flag representing the Portuguese\nlanguage, I have to say that I... see no problem! And when I see Brazilian\nflag... I don\u2019t see problem either!\n\nThe use of flags is so common, even out of internet (user\u2019s guide, touristic\nguides, language dictionaries, etc.), that nobody would take more than half\nsecond to find it.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Thomas says:\n\nMay 16, 2017 at 2:05 pm\n\nYeah, I completly agree. My job as designer is to make the website the easiest\nto use, and if to do so I need to put flag I will. Now I believe most people\nthink like Leonardo, but the one that feel insulted should probably just relax\na bit.\n\nReply\n\n      1.

I can see how that wouldn\u2019t work in a context without the\nWikimedia Foundation\u2019s fame for neutrality.\n\nReply\n\n  7. J. Robinson says:\n\nApril 17, 2014 at 1:25 am\n\nInteresting analysis and conclusion. Perhaps the worst offence of all, is\nusing both written and iconic versions side-by side; an American flag on it\u2019s\nown could be interpreted to mean \u201cAmerican English\u201d, but by placing the\nAmerican flag next to a label that says \u201cEnglish\u201d it removes all doubt and\nonly stands to irritate an Englishman. (As would labeling the Mexican flag\n\u201cSpanish\u201d)\n\nReply\n\n  8. oriste says:\n\nMay 23, 2014 at 3:03 pm\n\nJust one small comment, in Belgium we don\u2019t speak Flemish, much as we don\u2019t\nspeak Walloon either. We do speak Dutch (60%) though, and French (40%) and\nGerman (0.7%). Thought you might be interested in that little known fact.\n\nReply\n\n  9. Juan says:\n\nJuly 20, 2014 at 12:25 pm\n\nI definitely think that some flags could be used for languages, (but these\nshould be flags of the regions where the language originated) for example as\nnoted in other comments, the flag of England for the English language. BUT for\nthe Spanish language the flag of Castile, the historic region of Spain where\nthe Castilian language (Spanish) originated Or better yet, flags should be\ncreated *specifically* to represent languages\n\nReply\n\n  10. Zeus Cho says:\n\nJanuary 5, 2016 at 2:51 pm\n\nFor Chinese, using the flag of China is WRONG.

Zucre says:\n\nSeptember 11, 2017 at 10:50 pm\n\nFor Aragonese language, the spanish nationalist towns avoid using the\naragonese flag to refer its translation or instruction. Panticosa town is a\ngood example. Another towns such as Echo or regions like Ribagorza avoid\nsaying aragonese language and call it as their variety.\n\nReply\n\n  12. Casper Labuschagne says:\n\nSeptember 16, 2017 at 10:39 am\n\nSouth Africa has 11 languages and exactly one flag.\n\nThis issue of \u201cflags as languages\u201d requires far more attention in web UI\n\nReply\n\n  13.

David says:\n\nJanuary 11, 2020 at 9:45 am\n\nGreat Britain is an Island, divided between three non-sovereign countries:\nEngland, Wales and Scotland.\n\nUK stands for United Kingdom, and is the sovereign country that is made up of\nfour other non-sovereign countries: Northern Ireland, England, Wales and\nScotland.\n\nTherefore: 1) England is part of both Great Britain and the UK, 2) Great\nBritain is UK territory, 3) Northern Ireland is part of the UK, but not part\nof Great Britain.\n\nReply\n\n    3. Ian says:\n\nApril 18, 2020 at 12:19 pm\n\nEngland = England Great Britain = England, Wales & Scotland United Kingdom =\nEngland, Wales, Scotland & Northern Ireland\n\nEngland is the country that English originated in. England is on the Island of\nGreat Britain (which it shares with wales and Scotland). England is joined\nwith its neighbouring countries to form the United Kingdom (which includes the\n3 countries in Great Britain and also the norther part of the Island or\nIreland).\n\nIn the UN the UK has a seat but England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\ndo not. However, for many sports (eg football), England, wales, Scotland and\nNorthern Ireland have their own teams and the UK does not have a team.\n\nReply\n\n    4. Jon Chapple says:\n\nAugust 4, 2020 at 4:43 pm\n\nEngland is one of the four countries of the UK (along with Wales, Scotland and\nNorthern Ireland).\n\nGreat Britain is the island which contains England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe UK is England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (which is not on the\nisland of Great Britain, but the island of Ireland) together. The full name of\nthe UK is the \u201cUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\u201d.\n\nReply\n\n  14. James says:\n\nDecember 6, 2018 at 4:38 pm\n\nI\u2019ve never been offended to choose different country\u2019s flag, but this post\nsurely offended me.\n\nReply\n\n  15. Maarten says:\n\nNovember 16, 2019 at 8:44 am\n\nThe arguments for NOT using flags for languages are very valid and sound. This\nwebsite provides some very valuable background and research. Thanks for that.\n\nI feel I must add some arguments in FAVOR of doing so here too:\n\n1) Using flags makes it easier and faster for a user to find her own language\nwithin a list. Especially in a long list, with a lot of names in weird\ncharacters sorted in no particular order. (Because, how-to sort languages when\nevery language is spelled in a different language?)\n\n2) Countries like Spain, Portugal and China have lend their name to their\nlanguage, even though it\u2019s spoken elsewhere. There\u2019s a \u2018verbal-mental link\u2019\nbetween the nation symbolized and the language spoken. I see the Spanish flag\nand in my head I \u2018hear\u2019 the word \u00abSpain\u00bb. Then, I hear Spain-ish. People in\nBrazil speak Portugal-ish, people in Chili speak Spain-ish. And people in\nIreland can hangle England-ish very well.\n\n4) Many smaller countries (without a colonial/imperial past) represent\npractically the only geographical region where that particular language is\nspoken: think of Finland, Latvia, Poland, Sweden, Bulgaria, Vietnam. Here, the\nlink is very valid. And hey, we don\u2019t all live in America, do we?\n\n5) Flags are eye candy (as stated before)\n\n6) Rather then a \u2019translation\u2019 or globe icon, a flag on the top of a website\ntells me: \u201cClick here to change language\u201d. If I, as a Dutchmen, would end up\nin (say) Korea on a Korean computer and browse the internet, I would have no\nclue that \u201c\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\u201d would mean \u201cKorean\u201d and that I should click it so change the\nlanguage. However, if there\u2019s a flag in front of it, that would give a strong\nclue that I should look there to change the language.\n\nI strongly feel that user friendliness outweighs political correctness. But in\nsome cases, this might not be true. It should be evaluated for every use case\nagain. This website will help in doing so. Although I stick to flags for my\npersonal website. I chose to stay naive.\n\nReply\n\n  16. Zoom says:\n\nMay 18, 2020 at 2:07 pm\n\nGuys, Zoom has decided to abandon language acronyms and use flags instead.\nStrange and Idiotic!\n\nReply\n\n  17.

Some guy says:\n\nDecember 4, 2023 at 1:11 pm\n\nI think it\u2019s also important to note Spanish (which is actually called\n\u201cCastilian\u201d in Spain) is not the only language spoken in Spain. Castilian is\njust the traditional language of the former region of Castile, later adopted\nas the national language due to political reasons. Using the flag of the\nKingdom of Castile could also come accross as confusing. French is also not\nthe only language of France, although they were more aggresive about it.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nProudly powered by WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
