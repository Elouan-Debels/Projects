Recent\n> efforts have aimed to enhance the high-resolution understanding capabilities\n> of LVLMs, yet they remain capped at approximately 1500 x 1500 pixels and\n> constrained to a relatively narrow resolution range. This paper represents\n> InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD, a groundbreaking exploration into elevating LVLM\n> resolution capabilities up to 4K HD (3840 x 1600) and beyond. Concurrently,\n> considering the ultra-high resolution may not be necessary in all scenarios,\n> it supports a wide range of diverse resolutions from 336 pixels to 4K\n> standard, significantly broadening its scope of applicability. Specifically,\n> this research advances the patch division paradigm by introducing a novel\n> extension: dynamic resolution with automatic patch configuration. It\n> maintains the training image aspect ratios while automatically varying patch\n> counts and configuring layouts based on a pre-trained Vision Transformer\n> (ViT) (336 x 336), leading to dynamic training resolution from 336 pixels to\n> 4K standard. Our research demonstrates that scaling training resolution up\n> to 4K HD leads to consistent performance enhancements without hitting the\n> ceiling of potential improvements. InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD shows superb\n> capability that matches or even surpasses GPT-4V and Gemini Pro in 10 of the\n> 16 benchmarks.
