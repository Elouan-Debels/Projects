That is precisely the point behind\nthe Solidigm D5-P5336. Coming in at a whopping 61.44TB of space in a 2.5\u2032\u2032\nNVMe form factor, it is higher density, lighter weight, and more reliable than\ntraditional hard drives. What it is not, is spectacularly fast compared to\ntoday\u2019s fastest SSDs, but that is somewhat the point. We have usually thought\nof SSDs as having a smaller capacity but faster storage than hard drives. Now,\nSSDs are the larger capacity and speedier storage option, albeit more costly.\nThat sets the stage for our review.\n\nThis is one where we also did a video of the SSD for our YouTube audience that\nyou can find here.\n\nAs always, we suggest opening it in its own tab, window, or app for the best\nviewing experience. We are also going to say Solidigm is sponsoring this\nbecause they provided us with the SSD, and we did not have to purchase it.\nThat is also why the label may look a bit different.\n\n## Solidigm D5-P5336 61.44TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD Overview\n\nThe Solidigm D5-P5336 is the company\u2019s capacity SSD line. It is still a PCIe\nGen4 drive as it is fairly common these days for data center storage to trail\nthe fastest PCIe spec. A big part of that is also that server volume is slower\nto shift than consumer volume.\n\nSolidigm D5 P5336 61.44TB NVMe SSD Label\n\nWe previously went over the specs for the Solidigm D5-P5336 and have a full\nset of specs there. Still, Solidigm is making this drive using QLC NAND. QLC\nNAND, just like the TLC and MLC NAND transitions before, has higher density\nbut lower performance and P/E cycle ratings than lower-density units. At the\nsame time, Solidigm is doing something different, it is going large.\n\nSolidigm D5 P5336 Overview\n\nSince this drive is 61.44TB the 0.58 DWPD rating may not seem huge. On the\nother hand, given the capacity over five years it means 65.2PB can be written\nto the SSD. That is important since this is aimed at a new segment. Instead of\nthis being aimed at a performance segment, it is really aimed to transition\nhigh-capacity workloads to SSDs instead of HDDs. Instead of thinking about\nthis as a write log device, a high-performance database SSD, or other\napplication thirsty for absolute speed, consider video and image storage. This\nis denser than hard drives. There are no moving parts, so it can be more\nreliable. For sequential reads, it is still fairly fast. On the random write\nside, QLC makes the drive comparatively slower than many other SSDs we see.\nThat is really the point.\n\nSolidigm D5 P5336 61.44TB NVMe SSD Data And Power\n\nThe 2.5\u2032\u2032 drive we are looking at today (there are also EDSFF E3.S and E1.L\nversions) is the top-end 61.44TB SSD. This is the largest we have looked at so\nfar.\n\nSolidigm D5 P5336 61.44TB NVMe SSD Angle\n\nEven though the capacity is massive, it is still just a normal 2.5\u2032\u2032 SSD. Here\nis the other side of the drive.\n\nSolidigm D5 P5336 61.44TB NVMe SSD Front Side\n\nIf the label looks a bit off, we re-labeled this drive ourselves while testing\nthe drive.\n\nNext, let us take a look at performance.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n  * TAGS\n  * Cybertruck\n  * NVMe\n  * Solidigm\n  * SSD\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedin\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nCopy URL\n\nPrevious articleASUS NVIDIA Servers at GTC 2024\n\nNext articleIntel Vision 2024 Keynote Live Coverage\n\nEric Smith\n\nhttps://www.servethehome.com\n\nEric has been in the IT industry for over 15 years and specializes in\ninfrastructure projects.\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### SK hynix Platinum P51 PCIe Gen5 M.2 NVMe SSD Shown\n\n### QNAP TBS-h574TX Review E1.S and M.2 Thunderbolt 10GbE NAS\n\n### Crucial T705 2TB PCIe NVM Gen5 SSD Review\n\n#### 18 COMMENTS\n\n  1. michaelp April 8, 2024 At 1:35 pm\n\n\u201cStill, driving around with the setup we saw the first 10TB drive on the way\nup to Sedona, AZ in well under 500 miles of travel.\u201d\n\nYou saw the first 10TB drive on the way? I would have thought you would see it\nwhen you installed it in the qnap before you left. Perhaps you mean you\n\u201c...saw the first 10TB drive **fail** on the way...\u201d\n\n  2. No April 8, 2024 At 2:40 pm\n\nHow can you review something across three pages without even mentioning even a\nballpark figure for the price!?\n\n  3. Rezer April 8, 2024 At 2:54 pm\n\nBecause it\u2019s nearly $8000 and the terms of the review agreement probably\nstipulate they\u2019re not allowed to share that.\n\n  4. CW April 8, 2024 At 3:11 pm\n\nI picked up one of these in December 2023 for $3700. Now that the cost of NAND\nhas spiked they seem to be around $6400.\n\n  5. Dave April 8, 2024 At 4:28 pm\n\nAh, these are actually running PLC in pQLC mode. Yikes.\n\n  6. Eric Olson April 8, 2024 At 4:42 pm\n\nI\u2019m addition to price information for the SSD discussed here, I\u2019d like to see\nsome discussion of prices for the ASRock Rack 2U1G-B650 review last week. Why\ndoes a website devoted to server hardware have a dozen reviews of near\nidentical 2.5 Gbit switches with prices and buy now links but no price-\nperformance information for any of the server hardware?\n\n  7. Olimjon April 8, 2024 At 4:59 pm\n\nAny reason for SOLIDIGM for not moving to U.3? I suppose this SSD is still\nU.2, which means it\u2019s not supported by hardware RAID. Whereas U.3 is supported\nby many new trimode hardware raid cards\n\n  8. Iggy April 8, 2024 At 5:36 pm\n\nThese drives are meant for use cases where data availability/redundancy are\nhandled somewhere else (CDNs, object storage, etc).\n\n  9. Dave April 8, 2024 At 6:12 pm\n\n@Olimjon U.2 is supported by hardware RAID. Its still PCIe. 9560-8i is\nspecifically U.3 but supports U.2... why? Because U.2 PCIe backplane is still\nPCIe.\n\n  10. Malvineous April 8, 2024 At 6:52 pm\n\nI spotted one of Patrick\u2019s Easter Eggs: \u201coutlets that can stay powered on\nwhile driving, so we though it might be interesting\u201d \u2013 though instead of\nthought. (I never used to comment on these as I thought they were just typos,\nbut once Patrick inserted some typos intentionally and then was surprised that\nhardly anyone noticed \u2013 so now I figure we are supposed to point them out just\nin case.)\n\nLike @michaelp I was also wondering about why you would see the 10TB drive\nhalf way into the trip, wasn\u2019t it there from the beginning?\n\n  11. hoohoo April 8, 2024 At 10:33 pm\n\n\u201cLost\u201d?\n\n  12.

Terry Wallace April 9, 2024 At 10:01 am\n\nThat spec sheet \u2013 Power Off Data retention.. 90 days at 104f(40c). So one hot\nsummer on a shelf in texas/arizona and your data is gone ?\n\n  15. John S April 9, 2024 At 10:25 am\n\nFirst, how do you review high capacity drives without discussing the\nIU/TU/whatever. Is this drive using 4k, 16k, or 64k as the smallest transfer\nunit? The IOPS numbers are somewhat misleading if you\u2019re not showing off the\ndrive\u2019s strengths.\n\nSecondly, when are you going to use enterprise benchmarking practices instead\nof consumer ones? There\u2019s no way I\u2019d go to you for industry analysis if you\ncan\u2019t even properly test a basic enterprise storage device. Seriously,\nCrystalDiskMark has no place in a review for enterprise storage.\n\nFinally, how much Tesla stock do you own and are the Cyber Truck mentions paid\nfor?\n\n  16. Eric Olson April 9, 2024 At 10:45 am\n\nTerry Wallace wrote \u201cThat spec sheet \u2013 Power Off Data retention.. 90 days at\n104f(40c).\u201d\n\nThanks for posting. I was wondering what the power off data retention times\nwere like. Given how malware and human errors affect online backups, it seems\nthe world needs a modern media that can be shipped around in trucks and stored\noff-site.\n\nAfter all the 2.5 Gbit switches have been rounded up, I\u2019d vote for a focus on\noffline backup media.\n\n  17. Jay April 9, 2024 At 1:07 pm\n\n@John S\n\nWhat tools are you using to benchmark business SSDs?\n\nActually curious.\n\n  18. John S April 9, 2024 At 2:15 pm\n\nFIO on Linux. Windows can use vdbench or iometer, but enterprise storage is\nmostly Linux.\n\nFor synthetic tests you want to test the standard 4 corners. Also look at\nlarge block writes concurrent with small block reads and focus on the QoS\nnumbers (eg: 99.999% latency on reads). With the new very high-capacity drives\nI would test IOPS at increasing sizes of IOs to see how it scales as most\napplications that will use these will already be tuned to do larger IOs since\nthey\u2019re applications migrating from HDD.\n\nFYI, the driver and block level differences between windows and Linux are\npretty big. Only testing on Windows also prevents you from collecting\nenterprise-worthy data.\n\nI would recommend testing applications too. RocksDB (YCSB) / Postgres or MS\nSQL (TPC-C & TPC-H via hammerDB) / Cassandra (YDSB) / MySQL (sysbench) /\nvarious Spec workloads.\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
