But these convictions are not\nabout poor parenting. They concern acts that could have halted a runaway\ntrain,\" she told the court.\n\n\"Opportunity knocked over and over again, louder and louder, and it was\nignored.\"\n\nThe Crumbleys are eligible for parole after they serve 10 years in prison, but\nthey cannot be held for more than 15 years if parole is denied.\n\nProsecutors had alleged that the pair had dismissed clear signs that their\nson's mental health had deteriorated, and noted that the parents had bought\nEthan Crumbley the gun he used in the 2021 attack.\n\nTheir son was 15 when he killed four students with a semi-automatic handgun at\nOxford High School. Seven others were wounded in the shooting.\n\nHe is now serving life in prison without parole.\n\nOn Tuesday, parents of the dead students, who were all under the age of 17,\ndelivered emotionally charged victim impact statements in court.\n\nNicole Beausoleil, mother of 17-year-old victim Madisyn Baldwin, addressed\nEthan Crumbley's parents directly.\n\n\"When you were purchasing a gun for your son and leaving it unlocked, I was\nhelping her finish her college essay,\" a teary-eyed Ms Beausoleil said.\n\n\"You decided parenting wasn't a priority,\" she added. \"And because of that\nI've lost my daughter.\"\n\nJill Soave - the mother of another 17-year-old victim, Justin Shilling - was\nthe second parent to speak. She noted that her \"horror and trauma is hard to\nput into words\".\n\nBut she looked directly at James and Jennifer Crumbley as she slammed the\nparents for their \"failure to act\" and stop a \"completely preventable\"\ntragedy.\n\n\"If only they had done something, anything, to shift the course of events,\"\nshe said.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn a separate trial for each parent, prosecutors accused the Crumbleys of\nignoring warning signs about their son's growing mental health crisis. They\naccused them of being negligent by buying him a gun and not storing it\nproperly.\n\nProsecutor's sentencing recommendations were based on four separate counts of\ninvoluntary manslaughter, one for each of the four students that were killed.\n\nDuring Tuesday's sentencing, the prosecution said James Crumbley showed a\n\"total lack of remorse\" after they read from a profanity-laden transcript of a\ncall he made from jail. They alleged that James Crumbley had made death\nthreats against the lead prosecutor in the case during the call.\n\nJames Crumbley's lawyers disagreed, and said that their client only \"vented\"\nand used language that was \"angry\" and \"not respectful\".\n\nThe shooter's father emphasised his regret in a statement before the hearing\nand told the court later that he wished he had acted differently.\n\n\"I cannot express how much I wish that I had known what was going on with him\nor what was going to happen, because I absolutely would have done a lot of\nthings differently.\"\n\nJennifer Crumbley also shared her own regret to the families affected.\n\n\"I stand today not to ask for your forgiveness, as I know it may be beyond\nreach, but to express my sincerest apologies for the pain that has been\ncaused,\" she said in court\n\nJames Crumbley's lawyer, Mariell Lehman, said that there was no evidence that\nEthan Crumbley's father was aware of his son's plans.\n\nDefence attorneys also argued that there was no legal precedent for this case,\nand it was inappropriate to hold the parents responsible for each person that\ntheir son killed.\n\nProsecutors disagreed, as did the judge.\n\nOn the day of the shooting at Oxford High School in Oxford, Michigan, the\nCrumbleys cut short a school meeting about a disturbing drawing their son had\nmade, instead opting to go to work and not take him home.\n\nSchool staff later sent him back to class without checking his backpack, which\ncontained the gun his parents had purchased.\n\nAn independent investigation published last year alleged multiple failures\nfrom the school system, including the decision to allow Ethan to return to\nclass.\n\nIn response, the school district has pledged to review and improve its\npractices and policies.\n\n## Jury deliberations begin for Michigan gunman's father\n\n## Mother convicted for failing to stop school shooting\n\n## When parents get the blame for a child's mass shooting\n\nUS gun violence\n\nMichigan\n\nUnited States\n\nMass shootings\n\nRelated\n\n## Parents of Michigan school gunman to be sentenced\n\n11 hrs ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n## Man convicted of ambush shooting in New Mexico\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\nUS & Canada\n\n## When parents get the blame for a child's mass shooting\n\n15 Mar 2024\n\nUS & Canada\n\nMore\n\n14 mins ago\n\n## Arizona court reinstates abortion ban law from 1864\n\nArizona's top court ruled that a strict 160-year-old ban on abortion may be\nenforced.\n\n14 mins ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n1 hr ago\n\n## Time-lapses show eclipse sweeping over North America\n\nDarkness descended on Monday as a total solar eclipse moved across cities and\ntowns, turning day into night.\n\n1 hr ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## US teen allegedly planned killing spree at churches\n\nThe 18-year-old is accused of supporting Islamic State and of intending to\nattack religious services.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## Cameron meets Blinken after 'private' Trump talks\n\nThe foreign secretary urged the US to approve a $60bn aid package to Ukraine.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nUK\n\n9 hrs ago\n\n## Total eclipse prompts revival of Bonnie Tyler hit\n\nTotal Eclipse of the Heart provided the soundtrack as millions watched the\neclipse.\n\n9 hrs ago\n\nWales\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
