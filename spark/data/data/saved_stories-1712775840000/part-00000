Current empirical evidence supporting this idea is largely based on\nsecondary analyses of large-scale social datasets. Though these datasets\nprovide a valuable resource for highly powered investigations, their many\nvariables and observations are often explored with an analytical flexibility\nthat marks small effects as statistically significant, thereby leading to\npotential false positives and conflicting results. Here we address these\nmethodological challenges by applying specification curve analysis (SCA)\nacross three large-scale social datasets (total n = 355,358) to rigorously\nexamine correlational evidence for the effects of digital technology on\nadolescents. The association we find between digital technology use and\nadolescent well-being is negative but small, explaining at most 0.4% of the\nvariation in well-being. Taking the broader context of the data into account\nsuggests that these effects are too small to warrant policy change.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\n\n## Access options\n\nAccess through your institution\n\nChange institution\n\nBuy or subscribe\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n24,99 \u20ac / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\nLearn more\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 12 digital issues and online access to articles\n\n118,99 \u20ac per year\n\nonly 9,92 \u20ac per issue\n\nLearn more\n\nRent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\nLearn more\n\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\nFig. 1: Results of SCA of the YBRS.\n\nFig. 2: Results of SCA for MTF.\n\nFig. 3: Results of SCA for MCS.\n\nFig. 4: Results of SCA for MCS, split by whether controls are included in the\nanalysis.\n\nFig. 5: Comparison specifications for MCS.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### The effect of social media on well-being differs from adolescent to\nadolescent\n\nArticle Open access 01 July 2020\n\nIne Beyens, J.
