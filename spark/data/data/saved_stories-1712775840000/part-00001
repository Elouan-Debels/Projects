The reporter was holding a 3.5-inch disk in the broadcast, so may have\njust skipped the word \"point\".\n\n> The system is working just fine, but we know that with each year the risk of\n> data degradation increases\n\n\"It's a question of risk,\" Tumlin explained in a three-minute segment about\nthe floppy replacement project. \"The system is currently working just fine,\nbut we know that with each increasing year the risk of data degradation on the\nfloppy disks increases and that at some point there will be a catastrophic\nfailure.\"\n\nThe agency noted that its system was installed in 1998, when floppies were\nstill in common use and, er, \"computers didn't have hard drives.\" That doesn't\nexactly match reality, since hard drives were already very common at the time\n\u2013 here's a tale from 1998 about drives sold at the time, in sizes ranging from\n5GB to 16.8GB. That's right: gigabytes! How would anyone ever fill one of\nthose up?\n\nFor the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) to adopt\nfloppies in that year would not be the first time organizations have acquired\noutdated tech and just kept using it rather than enduring the expense of an\nupgrade.\n\n\"We were the first agency in the US to adopt this particular technology, but\nit was from an era that computers didn't have a hard drive, so you have to\nload the software from floppy disks onto the computer,\" SFMTA's PR Mariana\nMaguire argued.\n\nAnd before folks start panicking, it's worth remembering that use of floppy\ndisks is not uncommon in embedded systems. Bear in mind that the US nuclear\narsenal ran off eight-inch floppies until 2019. It's the way stuff was done\nwhen these systems were built last century.\n\n  * Good news \u2013 America's nuke arsenal to swap eight-inch floppy disks for solid-state drives\n  * Japanese government finally bids sayonara to the 3.5\" floppy disk\n  * 'Last man standing in the floppy disk business' reckons his company has 4 years left\n  * What are our top picks from the vast world of retro tech? Let's find out\n\nUpgrading San Francisco's public transit IT will be a lengthy and costly\neffort.\n\n\"This is effectively a multi-phase decade-long project that starts with pieces\nof Market Street subway and pieces on the surface,\" explained Tumlin.\n\"Ultimately our goal is to have a single train control system for the entire\nrail system.\"\n\nWhile Fog City's quaint cable car system (also run by the SFMTA) brings in the\ntourists, its light railway is among the best in the US \u2013 a nation that hasn't\ngenerally built extensive public rail networks, thanks to geography and lack\nof political will.\n\n\"We are hoping that a large component of this will come from state and federal\ngrants. The rest of it will come from Muni's rapidly declining internal\ncapital resources,\" warned Tumlin. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Silicon Valley\n  * Storage\n  * Systems Engineering\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Silicon Valley\n  * Storage\n  * Systems Engineering\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Backup\n  * Blu-Ray\n  * DRAM\n  * HDD\n  * In-Memory\n  * Network Attached Storage\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Snowflake Inc.\n\n#### More about\n\n102 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Silicon Valley\n  * Storage\n  * Systems Engineering\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Silicon Valley\n  * Storage\n  * Systems Engineering\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Backup\n  * Blu-Ray\n  * DRAM\n  * HDD\n  * In-Memory\n  * Network Attached Storage\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Snowflake Inc.\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### AI boom is boosting demand even for HDDs, raising prices by up to 20%\nsince Q3\n\nNo computer part, even spinning rust, is safe from the hype cycle\n\nStorage3 hrs |\n\n#### Samsung enterprise SSD prices skyrocket thanks to AI's appetite for\nstorage\n\nConsumer-grade devices won't be hit as hard\n\nStorage8 days | 7\n\n#### RISC-V PCIe 5 SSD controller for the rest of us hits 14GB/s\n\nSpeed-reading flash drives no longer just an Arm wrestle\n\nOn-Prem15 days | 6\n\n#### Developing AI workloads is complex.
