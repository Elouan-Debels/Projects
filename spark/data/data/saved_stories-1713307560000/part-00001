Instead the agency will seek\nproposals for quicker and cheaper ways to deliver the samples to Earth.\n\nAn independent review board concluded last year that NASA\u2019s Mars sample return\nmission could cost as much as US$11 billion, more than what it cost to launch\nthe James Webb Space Telescope. In a report released today, a separate NASA\nreview team concluded that even if the agency spent that much money, the\ndropoff of the samples on Earth would be delayed until 2040. The agency had\noriginally sought to land the samples on Earth in the early 2030s.\n\nThe $11 billion price tag is \u201ctoo expensive,\u201d said NASA administrator Bill\nNelson at a press briefing, and \u201cnot returning the samples until 2040 is\nunacceptable.\u201d Nelson said the agency \u201cis committed to bringing at least some\nof the samples back\u201d and later said NASA would return \u201cmore than 30\u201d of the 43\nplanned samples.\n\n## Scaling back\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover has already collected more than 20 rock samples from\nJezero Crater, where the rover landed in 2020. Scientists think that the\ncrater was once filled with a lake of water, and samples from the crater and\nits surroundings could provide a window into the planet\u2019s history and,\nperhaps, evidence of past life on the red planet.\n\nIn the agency\u2019s original vision, a NASA spacecraft would have flown to Mars\ncarrying a two-part retrieval system: a half-ton lander \u2014 which would have\nbeen the most massive vehicle to ever land on Mars \u2014 and a rocket to fly the\nlander and samples into Martian orbit. There they were to meet a spacecraft\nlaunched by the European Space Agency that would fly the samples to Earth.\n\nNow NASA plans to solicit proposals \u2014 from companies as well as NASA centres \u2014\nfor a streamlined system, perhaps one that uses a lighter lander, Nicky Fox,\nthe associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, said at\nthe briefing. The deadline for proposals is 17 May, and the revised mission\nwill be chosen later this year. Fox did not respond directly to reporters\u2019\nquestions about when the samples will reach Earth under the new scheme.\n\nNASA recommends spending $200 million of its planetary-science budget in 2025\non assessing alternative architectures for Mars sample return, Fox said.\nDedicating any more money to the mission threatened to \u201ccannibalize\u201d other\nplanetary science missions, Nelson said.\n\n## Back to the drawing board\n\nVicky Hamilton, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in\nBoulder, Colorado, expressed disappointment that eight months after the\nindependent review board released its report, the agency still lacks a solid\nplan for \u201ca very valuable science goal.\u201d\n\nReturning these samples would also demonstrate capability for two-way trip to\nMars before we can send astronauts, says Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary\nscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.\n\u201cThe sample return technology is here, it exists,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of\nputting the pieces together.\u201d\n\nBut scientists were relieved by one announcement: Fox said the revised\ntimeline for sample return will not affect the science goals for Perseverance,\nincluding plans for it to explore terrain beyond Jezero Crater.\n\nNASA\u2019s Mars rover makes \u2018fantastic\u2019 find in search for past life\n\nAmong samples collected outside the crater will be \u201csome of the ancient crust\nof Mars, representing rocks older than we have seen yet in Jezero Crater, some\nof which may have been altered by near-surface water,\u201d says Meenakshi Wadhwa,\na planetary scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe and principal\nscientist for the Mars Sample Return program.\n\nSo far, the only Mars samples that scientists have been able to study on Earth\nare bits and pieces ejected from the red planet that made it to Earth as\nmeteorites. All known Martian meteorites are \u201cigneous\u201d rocks, meaning that\nthey solidified from lava, and all are very old. As a result, they provide\nvaluable timestamps for Mars\u2019 geological evolution, but carry little\ninformation about how the planet\u2019s surface was shaped by the water that once\nflowed across it.\n\nTo achieve the mission\u2019s main goal of searching for signs of past life, the\nreal treasures are layered sedimentary rocks formed by minerals and organic\nmatter deposited over the aeons by water. Perseverance\u2019s instruments have\nalready detected organic molecules in Martian samples, but whether those\nmolecules are a marker of past life can only be determined by closer scrutiny\nin laboratories on Earth.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01109-1\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Flying Mars rocks to Earth could cost an astronomical $11 billion\n\n  * A year on Mars: How NASA\u2019s Perseverance hit a geological jackpot\n\n  * What\u2019s happened to China\u2019s first Mars rover?\n\n  * Is the Mars rover\u2019s rock collection worth $11 billion?\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Planetary science\n  * Engineering\n  * Funding\n\n## Latest on:\n\nThe world needs a COP for water like the one for climate change\n\nCorrespondence 16 APR 24\n\nTaiwan hit by biggest earthquake in 25 years: why scientists weren\u2019t surprised\n\nNews 03 APR 24\n\nThis super-Earth is the first planet confirmed to have a permanent dark side\n\nNews 28 MAR 24\n\nSelenium alloyed tellurium oxide for amorphous p-channel transistors\n\nArticle 10 APR 24\n\nThe biologist who built a Faraday cage for a crab\n\nNews & Views 09 APR 24\n\nGiant energy storage and power density negative capacitance superlattices\n\nArticle 09 APR 24\n\nHow India can become a science powerhouse\n\nEditorial 16 APR 24\n\nWhat the India election means for science\n\nNews 10 APR 24\n\nBrazil budget cuts could leave science labs without power and water\n\nNews 08 APR 24\n\nThe world needs a COP for water like the one for climate change\n\nCorrespondence 16 APR 24\n\nTaiwan hit by biggest earthquake in 25 years: why scientists weren\u2019t surprised\n\nNews 03 APR 24\n\nThis super-Earth is the first planet confirmed to have a permanent dark side\n\nNews 28 MAR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Computational Postdoctoral Fellow with a Strong Background in Bioinformatics\n\nHouston, Texas (US)\n\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\n\n  * #### Locum Associate or Senior Editor (Immunology), Nature Communications\n\nThe Editor in Immunology at Nature Communications will handle original\nresearch papers and work on all aspects of the editorial process.\n\nLondon, Beijing or Shanghai - Hybrid working model\n\nSpringer Nature Ltd\n\n  * #### Assistant Professor - Cell Physiology & Molecular Biophysics\n\nOpportunity in the Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics\n(CPMB) at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC)\n\nLubbock, Texas\n\nTexas Tech University Health Sciences Center, School of Medicine\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Associate- Curing Brain Tumors\n\nHouston, Texas (US)\n\nBaylor College of Medicine (BCM)\n\n  * #### Professor\n\nEnergy AI / Grid Modernization / Hydrogen Energy / Power Semiconductor\nConcentration / KENTECH College\n\n21, Kentech-gil, Naju-si, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea(KR)\n\nKorea Institute of Energy Technology\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Flying Mars rocks to Earth could cost an astronomical $11 billion\n\n  * A year on Mars: How NASA\u2019s Perseverance hit a geological jackpot\n\n  * What\u2019s happened to China\u2019s first Mars rover?\n\n  * Is the Mars rover\u2019s rock collection worth $11 billion?\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Planetary science\n  * Engineering\n  * Funding\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
