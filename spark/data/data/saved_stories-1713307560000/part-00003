In the fall of 2016, now seven and a half years\nago, Elon Musk took to Twitter to tell the world that he was fed up with the\ntraffic in Los Angeles and that he had decided to remedy it. His solution, as\nprosaic as it was effective, consisted of building tunnels and taking a large\npart of that traffic underground, to a high-performance network where people\ncould get from any point in the center of the big city to airport terminals in\nless than 10 minutes \u2014 all for just a $1 one-way ticket.\n\nTo materialize this utopia of urban mobility in record time, Musk created the\nBoring Company, his first major infrastructure company, presented with the\nappropriate pomp and ceremony in Hawthorne, California, in December 2016.\nShortly after, Boring announced the launch of The Loop, a \u201cmodular\u201d network of\nunderground connections that was going to begin construction in less than a\nyear in four metropolitan areas: Chicago, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and the\nconurbation between Washington D.C. and Baltimore.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial steps \u2014 the construction of a first tunnel in Hawthorne,\na test bed for Musk\u2019s team innovative technology \u2014 suggested that the\nCalifornian phase was going to be a priority. But in the end, it was the Las\nVegas Loop that became the Boring Company\u2019s star project. It was an ambitious\nproject, with an initial budget of $48.7 million that was set to rise to more\nthan $500 million once it had passed the early phases. By 2024, the network\nwas expected to cover nearly 70 miles and include 55 stations. A fleet of\nTesla Model 3 cars, mostly self-driving, was going to cover the routes at an\naverage speed of 150 miles per hour.\n\nA Tesla Model X at the entrance to the Hawthorne Tunnel in 2018.ROBYN BECK\n(AFP via Getty Images)\n\n### Problems arise\n\nIn recent weeks, media outlets such as Fortune, Bloomberg, Fox and QZ have\nreported on an incident that occurred several months ago, but has only just\nbecome public. As Jessica Mathews explains in Fortune, in May 2023, the then\nsafety manager of one of the Boring Company\u2019s branches, Wayne Merideth, sent a\nlate-night email to his superiors in which he denounced the precarious\nconditions of the Las Vegas tunnel excavation works.\n\nMerideth wrote that the company \u201chas been very fortunate these past few months\nthat there hasn\u2019t been a fatality.\u201d The safety manager said the lack of\nsupervision and basic precautions had made the underground work highly\ndangerous. \u201cWe have consistently flirted with death,\u201d he said in the email.\n\nMerideth blamed the dire safety conditions on the company\u2019s poorly calibrated\nattempt to accelerate the pace of excavations to meet deadlines that were\nnever realistic and, what\u2019s more, did not take into account the\nparticularities of the terrain. Bloomberg journalist Max Chafkin reported that\nthe excavation team has been forced to deal with pools of mud at least two\nfeet deep with the \u201cconsistency of a milkshake\u201d and a high degree of toxicity.\nSeveral employees said they had suffered burns, rashes and allergic reactions\nattributable to the high concentration of chemical accelerants (the byproducts\nof any dig) in the mud. Some of these injuries had become chronic due to the\nworkers\u2019 continuous exposure to the accelerants, an issue the company did not\ntry to address. Merideth ended his email with this cutting sentence: \u201cNo\ntunnel is worth a single person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nBloomberg reported that the workers\u2019 complaints have reached the Nevada state\nhealth and safety commission. The newly opened proceedings could lead to\nmillion-dollar penalties for the Boring Company and cause new delays in the\nconstruction of the underground network that was going to transform the Las\nVegas metropolitan area.\n\n### What\u2019s happening in Las Vegas\n\nThe first two sections of the Vegas Loop \u2014 drilled 12 meters deep \u2014 were built\nin the spring of 2020 and entered the testing phase a year later, once the\nlast of the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. Tens of thousands of volunteers\nwere willing to act as guinea pigs on wheels in the cutting-edge experiment.\n\nA few weeks later, Boring announced that these two sections and the five\nstations already operational had demonstrated their capacity to transport\nnearly 4,400 passengers per hour, with most journeys lasting less than five\nminutes. The launch and debut of the Vegas Loop would come a year and a half\nlater, coinciding with the 2023 edition of the Consumer Electronic Show (CES).\n\nAt that time, Adri\u00e1n Revuelta, a 43-year-old engineer from Madrid, who was a\nresident in Las Vegas and accredited at the 2023 fair, had the opportunity to\ngo underground to see what Elon Musk\u2019s new avant-garde development had to\noffer. \u201cI remember that it seemed like an extravagance without much substance,\nfar below initial expectations,\u201d he told EL PA\u00cdS. \u201cI went down some escalators\nthat gave access to a kind of quite precarious subway platform. Once there,\nafter a short wait, they boarded me with another couple of travelers into a\nwhite Tesla Model Y piloted by a company driver. In a few minutes, at a\nconstant speed of about 60 kilometers [40 miles], we traveled the only section\navailable that day, around four kilometers [2.5 miles] between one end of the\nconvention center and the other.\u201d\n\nThe driver, apparently repeating the arguments that the company had given him,\ntold Revuelta that this was the first \u201cof more than a hundred tunnels that\nwere going to be available in a few months and that very soon would take in\nbetween 5 and 10% of the private traffic of the city of Las Vegas.\u201d Revuelta\nshowed his skepticism and even commented that the tunnel \u2014 measuring \u201cjust\nthree and a half meters wide, illuminated with rather dim LED lights\u201d \u2014 seemed\na bit \u201cclaustrophobic.\u201d The driver shrugged his shoulders and acknowledged\nthat there were still \u201cminor details\u201d to iron out. He then spoke to him about\nthe magnificent opportunity that this cutting-edge engineering work was going\nto provide for professional drivers like him. \u201cHe imagined a fleet of\nthousands of electric cars making continuous journeys from one end of the\nnetwork to the other. I asked him if there were plans to replace them with\nself-driving vehicles in the very short term and he replied that this idea had\nbeen rejected for safety reasons.\u201d\n\nOnce on the surface, Revuelta met a co-worker who had also gone down to Musk\u2019s\nunderground tunnel and was as wary as him about the project. \u201cHe told me that\nit seemed like a cross between a private limousine service and the reinvention\nof the subway. We agreed that, no matter how much they promised individual\nroutes for $1 and daily passes for less than $5, it seemed to be conceived\nrather as a very restricted and elitist network, a minority solution so that\nthe richest could avoid the inconvenience of traveling on the surface. It\nseemed to us then and it still seems to me now that its impact on city traffic\nis going to be very limited. I think it is very unlikely that a network with\nthese characteristics will one day absorb between a twentieth and a tenth of\nthe vehicles that circulate through the city.\u201d\n\nRevuelta lives very close to the southern end of the Strip, the most popular\n\u201cand most congested\u201d avenue in Las Vegas. Few people would benefit more from\nMusk\u2019s umpteenth idea becoming a success. What\u2019s more, Revuelta is willing to\nrecognize \u201cits indisputable potential\u201d and give it the benefit of the doubt.\nBut he says nothing he has seen or read has inspired \u201ceven moderate\u201d optimism.\n\nImage of the controversial Las Vegas tunnel works.Las Vegas Review-Journal\n(TNS)\n\n### The stuff dreams are made of\n\nThe four local variants of The Loop project have made hardly any progress in\nthe 15 months since CES 2023. The Chicago, Los Angeles and Baltimore projects\nappear to have gone into hibernation and there is little news about the Loop,\nwith the exception of controversy in Las Vegas about worker complaints.\n\nIn the opinion of Walter Isaacson, the most prestigious of his biographers,\nElon Musk is a genuine representative of the culture of the so-called\n\u201cprovidential man\u201d and of what could be defined as the syndrome of executive\nimpatience. According to Isaacson, Musk tends to think that what he doesn\u2019t\ndo, no one else will, because contemporary capitalism suffers from a worrying\nshortage of disruptive leadership. He believes that the changes demanded by\nour societies are happening at an exasperatingly slow pace for lack of\nambition, competence and, very often, financial muscle. And that everything he\ndoes not lead seems doomed to failure or, worse, to irrelevance.\n\nEntrepreneurship expert Sid Mohasseb argues that Musk has become obsessed with\ngaining the superpowers of a James Bond movie villain. Boosted by a fortune\nthat remains around $180 billion despite last year\u2019s drop, the Pretoria-born\ntycoon \u201ccan manipulate entire markets with a single tweet,\u201d says Mohasseb, or\nembark on cyclopean projects such as plans \u201cto program minds\u201d and take\nsociety\u2019s elite on trips to outer space.\n\nIn 2022, Mohasseb warned of the self-proclaimed \u201ctechnological savior\u2019s\u201d\ndominance in diverse fields, be it driving the electric revolution with Tesla,\nimplanting microchips in human brains with Neuralink, conquering space and\ndestroying the asteroids with SpaceX, providing new payment options with\nPayPal or guaranteeing the supply of Internet to the farthest corners of the\nplanet with Starlink. And this was all before Musk set out to monopolize\npublic debate through an \u201calternative\u201d channel (Twitter, now X) or take\nartificial intelligence to another level with Grok.\n\nA Tesla driving through the Las Vegas tunnel in January 2023.PATRICK T. FALLON\n(AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSome of these projects may be considered \u201cnoble\u201d and worthy of praise \u2014 more\nin line with the work of a philanthropist with an unprecedented fortune than\nof a Darth Vader or a Montgomery Burns \u2014 but Mohasseb points out that even the\nJoker \u201cwanted to make the world smile.\u201d He argues that it is not a good idea\nfor all the eggs of technological disruption to be in the same basket and\nthat, as Lord Acton once said, \u201cabsolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d\n\nFor Mohasseb, the recipe against this one-man monopoly of large transformative\nprojects is not to clip Musk\u2019s wings, but to create a breeding ground that\npromotes free competition much more strongly. As much as money attracts money,\nother entrepreneurs deserve the opportunity to enjoy the generous grants and\nstrong corporate support that Musk has received since his name began to become\nsynonymous with capitalism.\n\nOther analysts have also supported the thesis that Musk is the supervillain of\nour time. Jim Lepore, from The New Yorker, argues that self-proclaimed\nsuperheroes slide down the slope of evil as soon as they begin to put their\npowers at the service of their own agenda, a switch that may have happened\nwith Bill Gates. When Stephen Colbert invited Musk on his late night show, he\nasked him \u2014 with a heavy dose of irony \u2014 if he really wanted to save the\nworld. And Liam Gaughan, from The Dallas Observer, goes so far as to compare\nhim to Joffrey Baratheon from Game of Thrones, an autocrat who invites his\nsubjects to speak out in order to identify the dissidents so he can purge\nthem, as Mao Zedong did in his day.\n\nUltimately, as Alice Kelly argues in Your Tango, there are at least 16 \u201cvalid\u201d\nreasons to hate Elon Musk, from how he has widened the global wealth, to his\narrogant contempt for the diver who rescued a group of Thai schoolchildren, to\nhis dalliances with the anti-vaccine movement, and to his treacherous\nmanipulation of the cryptocurrency market. Seen this way, the fact that his\nplan to decongest traffic in Las Vegas has become stuck in a puddle of toxic\nmud with the consistency of milkshake doesn\u2019t seem, by any stretch of the\nimagination, the worst of his actions.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Brazil justice investigates Musk for social media attacks on judge who\nfights disinformation\n\nJoan Royo Gual | Rio de Janeiro\n\n### Elon Musk reclaims title as world\u2019s richest person in good year for\nbillionaires\n\nManme Guerra | Madrid\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Neuralink\n  * Space X\n  * Las Vegas\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nRentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nPV Angebote\n\nHausbesitzer f\u00fchlen sich veralbert!
