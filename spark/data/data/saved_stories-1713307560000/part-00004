Last month, 404 Media covered the\nbizarre new trend of old people praying to AI images of Shrimp Jesus. But it\nseems like Shrimp Jesus is out and the hot new Facebook engagement hack being\nused to terrorize and mystify the platform\u2019s elderly user base is flight\nattendants praying to Jesus. Here\u2019s what I learned about the pages that are\ngenerating these images and my best guess as to why it\u2019s happening.\n\nThe search term to use if you want to find this stuff is \u201cbeautiful cabin\ncrew,\u201d which seems to be the main way pages are sharing these pictures. You\ncan also use the hashtag #cabincrew to see a bunch more. There are also at\nleast a dozen very, very popular Facebook Groups using some variation of the\nphrase as their title. Some of these groups are only for AI images of flight\nattendants, some are for pictures of flight attendants and Jesus, and some are\njust for sharing softcore pornography \u2014 and clearly stolen personal photos and\nvideos \u2014 of real human flight attendants. But let\u2019s start with the images that\ndon\u2019t have Jesus in them.\n\nThe biggest \u201ccabin crew\u201d group I found is called \u201cBeautiful Cabin Crew \ud83d\udc99 \u2708\ufe0f\u201d\nand it has around 700,000 members. Most of the posts are AI-generated flight\nattendants and women in military uniforms posted by bots and/or fake profiles.\nThough, there do seem to be real men commenting on the posts \ud83d\ude15. This group\nalso doesn\u2019t seem to post any pictures of Jesus. It\u2019s moderated by two people,\na Bengali guy and an account called Mitu, which is promoting a network of\nmassive private Facebook Groups sharing actual pornography on the platform.\nSome of these groups have over a million members and they\u2019re extremely creepy.\n\nThere are also a bunch of AI-generated flight attendant influencers. These\npages post in the cabin crew groups and are generating thousands of images of\nflight attendants. Some are incredibly popular, like this one called Bee,\nwhich has 150,000 followers. It\u2019s uploading a new AI-generated image every\nhour from what I can tell.\n\nAs for the pages generating the pictures of flight attendants with Jesus,\nthey\u2019re also using these cabin crew communities, most likely as a way to\npromote themselves. One smaller cabin crew group is called \u201cCabin crew Beauty\nlove\u201d and it shares both kinds of AI-generated flight attendant pictures. It\u2019s\nmoderated by one of the bigger AI flight attendant pages, which is called\n\u201cRaffy Tulfo News and Rescue\u201d. It has almost half a million followers and is\none of the main sources of all the Jesus-praying-with-flight-attendants photos\ntraveling around Facebook right now. Raffy Tulfo is a Filipino senator and\nmedia personality btw and it seems like the page was originally created in\n2022 as a way to spoof Tulfo\u2019s real pages.\n\n(Facebook/Wildlife Fan)\n\nWhich brings us to the question of where these pages are based. I found one\npage that was based in Pakistan contributing to a cabin crew group. And I\nfound another, smaller group called \u201cBeautiful Cabin Crew \u2708\ufe0f \u2708\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0f\u2764,\u201d run by a\nguy in Cambodia. I suspect that Facebook\u2019s Page Transparency settings have\nbroken somehow or these pages have figured out a way around them with VPNs\nbecause almost all of these pages are listed as being run out of the US, but\nare full of fake details.\n\nA popular AI image page called Tatyand Davon9, which makes flight attendant\nimages, along with other more traditional(?) AI-generated images of just\nJesus, went viral on X recently and none of its page information is correct.\nIt has 150,000 followers and lists itself as being based in California. I\ncalled the phone number on the page and it goes to a martial arts facility in\nFlorida. The receptionist was very nice, but also very confused when I asked\nher about the AI pictures of Jesus! I tried to contact another one of these\npages \u2014 one called Wildlife Fan, which seems to specialize in crying flight\nattendants? \u2014 but its number went to voicemail. Though, the address listed on\nthe page is for a flower shop in California.\n\nThe most interesting thing about these groups and pages is that they\u2019re not\nclearly selling anything \u2014 or even, seemingly, working together in any\ncoherent way, like the bad food magicians. Though, one page I came across,\nMelodee Lynnet, has about 10,000 followers and is now posting flight\nattendants and pictures of Jesus, but was posting old people and women in\nwheelchairs celebrating their birthdays earlier this year. (It was the big\nFacebook engagement hack before AI images took off.) And the Melodee page says\nit\u2019s affiliated with a viral marketing firm called Quantum Tech HD, but I\ncan\u2019t tell if that\u2019s real or not. I emailed them, but haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nI assume these pages are simply jamming a bunch of popular stuff together to\nfarm engagement to eventually monetize in some way down the line. Why AI\nimages? Because you can flood Facebook with thousands of posts and the\nplatform won\u2019t really do anything about it. These pages are also using the\nplatform\u2019s built-in 3D photo filter, possibly to bypass Facebook\u2019s bar-is-in-\nhell bare-minimum AI image detection. Why flight attendants? Because Facebook\nusers are, and always have been, uncontrollably horny. But, also, my mom is a\nflight attendant (sorry mom if you\u2019re reading this!) and aviation and flight\nattendant Facebook has always been huge. So I think they\u2019re just identifying\ncommunities that were already active and swarming them. Why Jesus? Because\nreligious content \u2014 and getting users to say \u201cAmen\u201d underneath it \u2014 became one\nof the fastest growing types of content on the site after it stopped promoting\nnews content last year.\n\nThe fact that, in the span of less than year, Facebook effectively removed\nanything resembling news from the platform, even conservative news, and\nallowed AI-generated spam to take its place, and both investors and\nadvertisers don\u2019t care, should tell you all you need to know about what social\nnetworks are in 2024. They\u2019re a data holding pen for advertisers to harvest\nand it seems like Meta has finally given up pretending they\u2019re anything else.\nWho cares if users are praying to and/or asking to marry AI images of flight\nattendants? All that matters is that they\u2019re on the app and you can stick ads\nin front of them.\n\nThe following is part of a promo swap I\u2019m doing with Semafor this week.

The most recent\nreheating of this take comes from The Atlantic, in a new piece titled,\n\u201cDemocracy Dies Behind Paywalls\u201d. Of course, you won\u2019t be able to read it\nunless you pay for an Atlantic subscription. Womp womp.\n\nThe Atlantic piece argues that outlets should make their journalism free\nduring the election year because of rampant mis- and disinformation online.\nAnd it only offers a single paragraph trying to imagine how an outlet might\npay for such an idea, mentioning, uh, grants, sponsors, and ads. Oh dang, what\na revolutionary idea.\n\nWriter Hamilton Nolan called the piece \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201claughably tossed-off\u201d\nand I agree. Though, Hamilton suggested publicly-funded journalism programs as\nthe only answer to this conundrum. Which, sure, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re\nrealistic at a scale that would matter in the US. But maybe one day!\n\nMy more pragmatic take here is that media outlets should do literally anything\nthat sorta-kinda works. But the idea that cutting off revenue streams during\nan election year could somehow result in BETTER information is, frankly,\nidiotic. The big lesson of the free news viral media age wasn\u2019t that news only\nworks when it\u2019s free, the lesson was that well-funded newsrooms work,\nregardless of where that funding comes from. Report news, figure out how to\nsell it, and put pressure on platforms (via your reporting) to limit\nmisinformation.\n\n## A Few Updates From The Brazil/X Feud\n\nX\u2019s head of legal in Brazil, Diego de Lima Gualda, resigned after Elon Musk\nsaid he would defy court orders imposed on the site. Probably smart. Gualda\nwas mentioned by name twice in a recent court decision regarding X, according\nto a report from Folha (one of Brazil\u2019s largest papers). Gualda was also\nspotlighted by the new round of Brazilian Twitter Files.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has joined Bluesky.\nIn case you were curious like I was, he\u2019s been on Threads since it launched\nand has a much bigger presence there.\n\n(bsky.app/lulaoficial.bsky.social)\n\n## Wifejak And Husbandjak\n\n(r/WojakDrawings)\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to cover this meme because it\u2019s actually sort of old and I feel\nlike these kind of \u201cmemes\u201d don\u2019t really matter anymore, but it went viral over\nthe weekend and briefly became unavoidable for a split second on X. I thought\nthis husbandjak one was pretty funny.\n\nI\u2019d say the main takeaway here, if you\u2019re looking for one, is that a lot of\ndaily life memes like this feel more and more abstracted from actual life\nbecause the increasingly small group of guys on sites like X and Reddit making\nthem don\u2019t really seem to experience real life anymore. They\u2019re like\nprojections of a projection of a projection.\n\n## Energy Toast\n\n(r/energydrinks)\n\nI saw a screenshot of this on X recently and hoped that by finding the\noriginal post on Reddit I\u2019d get a few more answers about what\u2019s going on here.\nIt was posted in r/energydrinks, so I assumed \u201cenergy toast\u201d is toast with a\njam made from some kind of melted down energy drink, but I was curious which.\nDown in the comments, the original poster said it was something called \u201cC4\njelly,\u201d which I found a recipe for on Instagram. I guess, it\u2019s jelly made from\nan energy drink called C4.\n\nAnyways, here are my favorite comments:\n\n  * \u201cEvery day in this sub we stray further from God.\u201d\n\n  * \u201cStraight to jail\u201d\n\n  * \u201cI mean this in the worst way possible, go to hell \ud83d\ude02\u201d\n\n  * \u201cIf you were really in a rush then you'd take it in the shower like everyone else.\u201d\n\n## A Real Good AI-Generated Yearbook\n\n> I'm absolutely losing my shit at this \u0100\u00ce gen yearbook\n>\n> \u2014 S\u13e6\u13a9L\u0190\u13d2 \ud83d\udd1c \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83d\uddfc (@skyezera) Apr 12, 2024\n\n## Some Stray Links\n\n  * Marques Brownlee reviewed the bad AI pin\n\n  * \u201cThe Intercept is running out of cash\u201d\n\n  * \u201cSome ex-TikTok employees say the social media service worked closely with its China-based parent despite claims of independence\u201d\n\nP.S. here\u2019s a rat named Kronk learning to drive a tiny car.\n\n***Any typos in this email are on purpose actually***\n\n#### Join the conversation\n\nor to participate.\n\n  * Sam G \u2022 15 hours ago\n\n\"Quantum Tech HD\" uhhhh maybe it's time to check back in with the boys over at\nQanon Anonymous again.
