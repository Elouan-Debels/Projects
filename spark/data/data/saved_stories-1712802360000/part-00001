The company is using some of the\nnew housing legislation passed in recent years to help homeowners with big\nlots to split their lot, develop housing and sell. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News\nGroup)\n\nBy Kate Talerico | ktalerico@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nPUBLISHED: April 5, 2024 at 2:02 p.m. | UPDATED: April 5, 2024 at 2:06 p.m.\n\nIn recent years, California lawmakers have approved a flurry of legislation\naimed at increasing the housing supply and addressing the state\u2019s decades-in-\nthe-making housing crisis.\n\nMany of the changes are modest \u2014 rather than creating massive apartment towers\nor sprawling new subdivisions, they are meant to add moderate density in\nexisting neighborhoods. It\u2019s the type of \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing that\nadvocates say will help the Bay Area hit state regulators\u2019 goal of building\n441,000 new homes by 2031.\n\nSenate Bill 9, passed in 2021, is one such change: it allows single-family\nhomeowners around the state to split their lots in two, and build two homes on\neach lot. An analysis by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC\nBerkeley estimated that the new law could result in 700,000 new homes.\n\nBut in the first year after SB 9 passed, just a handful of homeowners ended up\napplying for lot splits, the Terner Center found.\n\nIs that a surprise? Housing law is dense and obscure \u2014 and difficult for the\naverage homeowner to navigate. Enter BuildCasa, a company founded by serial\nentrepreneur Ben Bear and former architect Paul Steidl, which works to\nidentify homes on large lots where an SB 9 project could be feasible, then\noffers to buy up the extra land to get it developed. To start, they are\ntargeting three key markets \u2014 San Jose, Sacramento and San Diego. In just\ntheir first year of operating, they\u2019ve gotten plans approved for 115 new\nhousing units.\n\nBear and Steidl recently relocated their company headquarters from San\nFrancisco to downtown Oakland. In the midst of their move, they took time to\nchat about California\u2019s housing crisis and how BuildCasa could help address\nthe shortage.\n\nQ: BuildCasa wouldn\u2019t exist without SB 9. Why do you think so few people are\nusing SB 9, and how does BuildCasa help?\n\nSteidl: There are a lot of folks who have really great properties with the\npotential for new units, but don\u2019t have the financial or the logistical\ncapabilities of taking on a project to add additional units, like an accessory\ndwelling unit (ADU) or a new house. It can cost hundreds of thousands of\ndollars \u2014 you have to hire an architect, an engineer, and then go through the\nwhole development process.\n\nBear: Homeowners aren\u2019t developers, right? We saw the need for someone to come\nin, so homeowners could take advantage of this trapped asset \u2014 their extra lot\nspace \u2014 with no cost or work. So far, we\u2019ve had our first few projects that\nhave had their lots appraised after a split. On average, people are losing\nabout 4.5% of their home\u2019s value, but they\u2019re gaining 15% to 20% on top of\nthat with the new parcel.\n\nQ: If I\u2019m a homeowner with a big backyard and I want to split my lot, how does\nthis work? Do I still maintain ownership over the other half of my lot once\nit\u2019s been split?\n\nBear: We have two models. In one, when the homeowner is looking to get\nliquidity, we help them sell to a developer. In the second model, we help the\nhomeowner subdivide the lot, they retain ownership, and they develop it\nthemself. We\u2019ve been surprised: Most people are interested in selling. It\u2019s\nappealing for people with low-interest mortgages who want to keep their house,\nbut want to get some extra cash without taking on any debt or work.\n\nIn particular, it\u2019s popular with senior citizens \u2014 a lot of them are house\nrich and cash poor. They want to stay in their neighborhood, but they could\nuse more financial flexibility. In Sacramento, the average payout is $100,000.\nIn the Bay Area, we\u2019ve seen upwards of $350,000 for a split lot. It\u2019s a\nsignificant windfall \u2014 and you\u2019re not taking on any debt, like in a reverse\nmortgage, and you\u2019re not losing out on your Prop 13 eligibility.\n\nQ: We\u2019ve heard a lot about how California has a lot of single-family homes and\na lot of tall apartment buildings, but that there\u2019s a need for more \u201cmissing\nmiddle\u201d housing. Tell me why that\u2019s important?\n\nSteidl: At the turn of the 20th century all the way through the 1940s, there\nused to be a lot of housing like this \u2014 duplexes, townhouses. Then we made\nchanges to how we regulate land use, and these types of housing dropped off a\ncliff. Most houses built now are either large multifamily properties in urban\ncenters, or tract housing in the exurbs. We look at opportunities in existing\nneighborhoods. It\u2019s much more sustainable to build where there\u2019s already\ninfrastructure like water and sewage lines in place, and when you build in\nwalkable communities, you\u2019re also cutting down on vehicle miles traveled.\n\nQ: How does building more missing middle housing help with affordability?\n\nBear: There\u2019s a lot of programs for low income, renters and homeowners \u2014 but\nthere are very few market rate options available for folks who are middle-\nincome. The focus of our company is really creating new for-sale units that\nare affordable by design. For example, on the lot that\u2019s split, state law\ngives us the right to build a duplex, and each of those units can be sold\nseparately as a condo \u2014 which may cost around 35% as much as a single-family\nhome. It can really be this new version of the American dream where you still\nhave private outdoor space, and you\u2019re living in the type of single-family\nneighborhood that people want to live in, but you can afford homeownership,\neven if you have a middle-class occupation.\n\nQ: Tell me about the technology you\u2019re building at BuildCasa and how that\nhelps you find the best candidates for a lot split?\n\nBear: We have developed a geospatial algorithm that would attempt to find the\nbest opportunities for development. We can look at a lot and assess whether,\ngiven the local constraints and zoning and the requirements of SB 9, does a\nduplex design fit? A property owner can go to our site, and within 30 seconds,\nthey can get a sense of what that extra lot space would be worth, were they to\nsubdivide it.\n\nQ: Sacramento is one of your first test markets. Why start there?\n\nSteidl: Sacramento is very orderly \u2014 it\u2019s got lots of rectangular lots and a\nrepetitive city grid. We figured this would create a lot of potential SB 9\nopportunities. It also looks a lot like the rest of the country \u2014 so as we\u2019re\nthinking about the expansion of laws like this around the U.S., it\u2019s a good\ntesting ground. And third, it\u2019s helpful to demonstrate the power of these new\nlaws in the backyard of the people who are writing them.\n\nBear: We looked at San Jose next because it has a progressive and competent\nplanning department. Residents there have really embraced new housing laws,\ntoo.\n\nQ: How important is it for you to have strong relationships with local\nplanning staff?\n\nBear: Previously, I was the CEO of Spin, a Ford-owned electric bike and\nscooter company that was focused on working with the government rather than\nagainst it. It doesn\u2019t come super naturally to most folks in tech \u2014 there can\nbe an antagonistic relationship with business.\n\nWe\u2019ve been laser-focused on working with jurisdictions that are pro-housing.\nBefore we launch in a city, we make sure to meet with the mayor\u2019s office and\nthe planning director, and even at the staff level. The rubber meets the road\nat the intersection between state law, local regulation, and then the planner\nthat\u2019s actually reviewing the application.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n## Most Popular\n\nRecommended For You\n\n  * Arizona high court says state can impose near-total abortion ban\n  * Vacaville, Fairfield police nab robbery suspect following pursuit\n  * Why spring cleaning your wallet can save money\n  * More funding coming to improve Highway 37\n  * Vallejo City Council to appoint interim city manager, consider action following state of emergency\n  * Pinole becomes latest Bay Area city to ban new gas stations as movement spreads\n  * Woman faces court dates for biting officer, trespassing in Fairfield\n  * The Great North American Eclipse returns\n  * Vallejo honors Times-Herald\u2019s Freedman with stage tribute\n  * PHOTO: Pangora\u2019s Box is ready to be unleashed in Vallejo\n\n## Trending Nationally\n\n  * 'Deeply disturbing': Harrowing video released of fatal Chicago police shooting of Dexter Reed\n  * Paraprofessional arrested after police say video shows her beating autistic child on school bus\n  * Assistant principal charged with child neglect in 6-year-old\u2019s shooting of teacher\n  * Concerned about misuse, Disney World changes disability passes\n  * Zendaya on Tom Holland, stepping away from spotlight to raise future kids\n\n## More in Business\n\n  * ### \n\nHealth |\n\nFor-profit companies open psychiatric hospitals in areas clamoring for care\n\n  * ### \n\nBusiness |\n\nTo retain workers, consider paying them more often\n\n  * ### \n\nSports |\n\nOakland B\u2019s hustle to get new Raimondi Park stadium ready before first game\n\n  * ### SUBSCRIBER ONLY\n\n###\n\nBusiness |\n\nVets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies\n\n  * 2024\n  * April\n  * 5\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n    * e-Edition\n    * Sign Up For Newsletters\n    * Print Subscribe\n    * Web Subscribe\n  * Contact Us\n\n    * Work With Us\n    * Special Sections\n    * Privacy Policy\n    * Accessibility\n    * Sitemap\n  * Advertise With Us\n\n    * MediaNews Group Advertising\n    * Today\u2019s Ads\n  * Public Notices\n\n    * Local Guide\n    * Jobs\n    * Real Estate\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * California Notice at Collection\n  * Notice of Financial Incentive\n  * Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information\n  * Arbitration\n  * Powered by WordPress.com VIP\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 MediaNews Group\n\n", "frontpage": false}
