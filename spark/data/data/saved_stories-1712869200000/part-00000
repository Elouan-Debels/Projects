(Beth LaBerge/KQED)\n\nNot enough salmon will swim up the state\u2019s rivers to spawn this year to make a\ncommercial salmon season viable, the Pacific Fishery Management Council\nannounced late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe number of fish that could be available for harvest was so small there was\nrisk that we wouldn\u2019t be able to conduct a fishery and stay within our\nlimitations,\u201d Robin Ehlke, a staff officer with the Salmon and Pacific Halibut\nPacific Fishery Management Council, told KQED.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d rather see the fish go back up the river.\u2019Matt Juanes, Bay Area fisher\n\nThis is the second year in a row that the council voted to close the season,\nwhich hundreds of commercial fishers and tribes rely on for their livelihoods\nand food supplies. This year\u2019s scarcity of Chinook salmon is tied to\nCalifornia\u2019s last drought. The fish have a three-year lifecycle, so the\nreturning fish were born when there wasn\u2019t enough water to thrive. The issues\nthreatening the species extend well beyond the recent dry years.\n\nSponsored\n\n\u201cWe hope the decision gives the benefit to the fish so they can rebuild\nthemselves and be available for fisheries in future years,\u201d said Ehlke.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s water management decisions have played a significant role in the\nspecies\u2019 decline over the years \u2014 cutting off the fish from spawning grounds\nand decreasing the cold water the salmon need.\n\nState leaders unveiled a blueprint to boost salmon populations in January that\nincludes tearing down dams that block salmon from spawning grounds and\nrestoring some river flows. But, scientists and environmental groups argue\nthat the pace of the work is too slow and that some salmon runs may not exist\nby the time the state completes the projects.\n\n## \u2018It comes down to water\u2019\n\nThe closing of the salmon season will force Matt Juanes, who docks his green\nand white 36-foot-long boat, Plumeria, at San Francisco\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf,\nto diversify his income this year. Juanes said he will likely lose nearly half\nhis income. \u201cThis year is going to be very difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nCommercial salmon fisher Matt Juanes prepares to set sail at Pier 47 in San\nFrancisco on June 7, 2023. With California\u2019s salmon season shut down this\nyear, Juanes is pivoting to fish for crab and using his boat to charter\ntourists. (Kori Suzuki/KQED)\n\nHe\u2019s fished salmon for six years, and the numbers seem to dwindle each season,\nhe said. The closure of the fishery is a gut punch, but he agreed that it was\na necessary step so that the species can rebound.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather see the fish go back up the river,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes down to\nwater. If it had rained, we probably wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament.\u201d\n\nDrought isn\u2019t the only factor contributing to the demise of California\u2019s\nsalmon.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s a beacon of hope for the future, but it has to happen at a faster\nrate. We need these habitats like yesterday.\u2019Robert Lusardi, UC Davis wetlands\nprofessor\n\nAlso to blame is a warming and acidifying ocean, toxic dust from tires that\nkills the fish in hours, dams blocking migration paths, managers diverting\nwater flows for storage and climate-fueled storms complicating river systems.\n\nWith all these challenges, the state could lose nearly half of its native\nsalmon and trout species within 50 years, according to a study coauthored by\nUC Davis professor Robert Lusardi.\n\nLusardi, who studies freshwater ecology and wetlands, said the closure of the\nsalmon season is a direct result of humans\u2019 alteration of the salmon habitat.\nNearly two million salmon historically swam up rivers within the Central\nValley. This year, Lusardi expects just over 200,000 to spawn.\n\n\u201cWhat we have left are small populations that I would argue are not diverse,\nwhich means they are incapable of acclimating to changing environments,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n## \u2018We need these habitats like yesterday\u2019\n\nIn January, Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined his administration\u2019s strategy to\nrestore salmon populations \u201camidst hotter and drier weather exacerbated by\nclimate change.\u201d The sprawling plan includes improving salmon migration\npathways, tearing down dams that block fish from spawning, updating hatcheries\nand restoring flows in some waterways.\n\nCalifornia \u2014 alongside environmental groups, tribes and scientists \u2014 has\nstarted to restore floodplains where juvenile fish can grow into what\nconservationists call \u201cfloodplain fatties,\u201d which are a nickname for the well-\nfed salmon that feed off bugs in flooded areas. The state is removing four\nhydroelectric dams on the Klamath River partly so fish have more room to\nspawn.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a beacon of hope for the future, but it has to happen at a faster\nrate,\u201d said Lusardi. \u201cWe need these habitats like yesterday.\u201d\n\nState scientists, including Colin Purdy, environmental program manager for the\nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife, are tasked with implementing the\ngovernor\u2019s plan. They have a considerable feat ahead of them. While some of\nthe actions outlined in the state\u2019s new blueprint are already underway, Purdy\nsaid changing how fisheries operate \u201ctakes years of doing pilot studies to\nflesh out the details\u201d before hatchery managers can reintroduce the fish into\nhabitats.\n\n\u201cThe sooner we can get started on that stuff, the better,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Golden State Salmon Association and other groups critiqued the governor\u2019s\nplan. They argue while it has some suitable components, California is also\npursuing projects \u2014 a new reservoir and a 45-mile water tunnel beneath the\nSacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to divert more water south \u2014 that could\ndecrease the amount of cold water in rivers that salmon need to live.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being distracted by this smoke and mirrors scenario,\u201d said Scott Artis,\nthe association\u2019s executive director. \u201cIf we don\u2019t address the water\ndiversions, we\u2019re going to continue to see salmon numbers decline, and we\u2019re\ngoing to continue to be in a situation where there are closures.\u201d\n\nlower waypoint\n\nGet the best of KQED\u2019s science coverage in your inbox weekly.\n\nTo learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy\npolicy.\n\n## Signed up.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KQED Inc.
