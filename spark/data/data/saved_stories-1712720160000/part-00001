But when\nthe teacher sets out into the hills to investigate a claim, he's seeking\nanything but attention.\n\nOn a remote stretch of the Fraser River in British Columbia \u2014 about a two-hour\ndrive northeast from Vancouver \u2014 a highway and a major railway curl along the\ncanyon around us, but all I can really hear is the steady rush of muddy water,\npropelled by the spring snowmelt from the mountains farther north.\n\nThen, to my surprise, the quiet is broken by an ear-piercing digital shriek \u2014\nsqUUUAAWWk! \u2014 as I turn to see Dan Hurd smiling as he reaches for a petite\nshovel. In his other hand is the business end of a metal detector, which he\nwaves over a tiny patch of dirt and gravel, over and over again. \u201cThat sounds\nlike what we\u2019re here for,\u201d Hurd exclaims, waving me over as he begins to dig\ninto the sandy soil with his bare hands.\n\nI walk to him, carefully stepping on giant shards of shale that jut out from\nthe ground. The long striations of the rock forms nooks and crevices all along\nthe water, creating an endless series of cracks, big and small, that can trap\ndeposits of gold. The claim to mine this half-kilometer stretch of the Fraser\nbelongs to Hurd, and it\u2019s become a fast favorite of his. \u201cI\u2019m keeping this\nclaim kind of secret because the amount of big gold I\u2019ve found here is\nsignificant compared to any other claim,\u201d he tells me, describing a multi-gram\nnugget he picked up off the ground last year. \u201cI\u2019ve already pulled a half\nounce of gold out of this claim, which, for a prospector, is a lot. That\u2019s\naround $900 Canadian.\u201d\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * Work: I Was the Male Star in a \u2018Dancing Bear\u2019 Porn\n  * Relationships: Secrets of a Happy Ending Massage Parlor\n  * Culture: The Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Paying a Bar Tab\n  * Work: Here\u2019s What Your HR Department Knows About Your Online Nudes\n\nHurd\u2019s blue-gray eyes widen as he waves the detector again. In that moment,\ncrouched on the rock in the sun, shaded by a large straw hat, cracking into\nshale with a hammer and his hands, Hurd is exactly what you imagine a gold\nprospector looks like. His huge, curly ginger beard waves in the wind as he\nscoops up dirt into a green plastic pan, and we walk to a creek just a few\ndozen steps away, where he begins to wash the sediment in clear, cold water.\nGold is so heavy it rapidly sinks when rinsed in a pan, but Hurd\u2019s initial\nexcitement fades into neutrality as he peers down at the dregs. There are just\na few specks of gold, despite all the excitable squawking from the metal\ndetector.\n\n\u201cIt might be a lot for another claim, but it\u2019s nothing for this spot. Must\u2019ve\nbeen a piece of metal that got the detector,\u201d he says, tossing the pan\u2019s\ncontents into the creek. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out where the gold is\ncoming from, whether it\u2019s being eroded out of quartz seams in these big rocks,\nor whether it\u2019s just been washed down river. The last nugget I pulled was\nreally smooth, really old. That means it was deposited probably thousands of\nyears ago into the bottom of the river.\u201d\n\nI stumbled across Hurd thanks to the random machinations of YouTube\u2019s front-\npage algorithm, which for some reason wanted me to witness gold prospecting.\nHe\u2019s racked up more than 8 million views since he began documenting his work\nabout a decade ago, and has recently seen a big rise in channel subscribers\nand views alike (\u201cThe algorithm!\u201d). He\u2019s one of a number of prospectors who\nhave discovered the history and culture around gold hunting, and Hurd is now\nhelping to write the story of prospecting in the 21st century. His patient\ndigging and panning along riverbeds, rock formations and cave systems is a far\ncry from the industrialized, large-scale operations that define gold and\nmineral mining today. It\u2019s closer to the platonic ideal of the adventurous\nminer \u2014 one ready to venture into \u201cthe idealistic purity of the country... the\nvast expanse of unclaimed land ripe for the taking,\u201d as the Digital Public\nLibrary of America describes.\n\nThe California gold rush that predated rushes in Canada created its own set of\nsymbols and mythical imagery, many of them ripe with a wild, almost lawless\nmale energy. In his book, Gold Rush Masculinity, expert Christopher Herbert\ndescribes how miners bought into the culture around high-risk, high-reward\ngold hunting, promoting the ideal of individual opportunity. \u201cAfter 1852, [the\nprospector] became romanticized as the embodiment of a type of risk-taking and\nindependent white manliness that represented a similarly romanticized period\nbefore the growth of wage labor,\u201d Herbert writes. Modern stereotypes around\nprospecting and gold seem to celebrate this independence, even if it\u2019s subtle\n\u2014 perhaps it\u2019s why people invest more in gold during a recession, or why\nprospecting got more popular during the 2008 downturn.\n\nHurd\u2019s reasons for prospecting aren\u2019t as wild as those of old-school\nprospectors, but you can sense history when he talks about the serenity of\nbeing out, completely alone, sans cell signal in an unkempt land. Hurd remains\npulled to these old claims by something less tangible than earning money \u2014\nmaybe just the thrill of interacting with aged earth in such a primitive,\ninstinctual way.\n\n\u201cWe call him the gold hound. It\u2019s incredible how he\u2019s just got a nose for\ngold. He understands the lay of the land really well, what kind of rock to\nlook for, what kind of conditions in the environment,\u201d says Pete Bricker, a\nfellow prospector and frequent companion on Hurd\u2019s expeditions. \u201cProspecting\ncan seem more like an art than a learned skill at times. Dan is a great\nteacher, but he\u2019s got an innate sense that\u2019s hard to describe.\u201d\n\nHurd has found plenty of gold in his roughly two-dozen claims over the years,\nand uncovering several thousand dollars\u2019 worth of the metal in an annual\nseason isn\u2019t unusual, though it takes a lot more time and failure than people\nexpect, he jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of delusions of grandeur out there. A lot of\npeople think they can go out there, spend a day and pull $1,000 of gold out of\nthe ground,\u201d Hurd says. \u201cI\u2019ve done that once or twice, and those were really\nlucky days. I\u2019ve had thousands of days I find nothing at all. It\u2019s hard to\nmake a living on just finding gold.\u201d\n\nIronically, it\u2019s the modern world of recreation and entertainment that\u2019s led\nto a second livelihood for Hurd, who hustles on YouTube and resells good\nclaims alongside his full-time job as a teacher and counselor. The principles\nand methods that guide Hurd\u2019s hands haven\u2019t changed much since the famous 19th\ncentury rushes that created the cult of gold in North America. In return, Hurd\nis one of a number of figures keeping the legend of the gold-hunting mountain\nman alive in 2019.\n\n* * * * *\n\nHurd grew up in the small town of Penticton (population 30,000), tucked\nbetween two lakes in the picturesque Okanagan Valley. The slower pace of life\nand extravagant natural scenery attracts a lot of retirees to this corner of\nBritish Columbia, and it was a similarly mellow upbringing for Hurd and his\nolder sister. His father was a mechanic, while his mother worked in real\nestate, and both made it a point to offer the outdoors to their kids.\n\nHurd departed the Okanagan for college, heading west to Vancouver for stints\nat the B.C. Institute of Technology and the University of British Columbia\nwhile pursuing degrees needed to teach. He always loved working with his\nhands, and trained in the craft of wood and metalworking. Big-city life was\nharder to reconcile. \u201cI hated being there, even though I loved what I was\nlearning,\u201d Hurd admits as he watches the Fraser rush by. \u201cAll those people,\njust rushing around you all the time. I had friends who loved things like\nnightlife. I couldn\u2019t care less. I saw a lot of empty energy.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for Hurd to start his teaching career, he looked toward the\nOkanagan once more, landing just 30 minutes north of his hometown, in the\nhamlet of Peachland (population 5,000). For a while, life was on track: He met\nhis wife Dayna in the Okanagan, had two kids, got promoted. But a moment of\nreckoning came about a decade ago, when Hurd looked in the mirror and realized\nhow busted his body and health were. \u201cI had high blood pressure, high\ncholesterol. My back was hurting, my legs ached. And it was because I wasn\u2019t\ndoing anything active. On my off hours, to relax, I played video games,\u201d Hurd\nsays. \u201cI was on a highway to a heart attack as a young father.\u201d\n\nHurd today says that putting his mind toward prospecting got him out the door\nand saved his life, as dramatic as it sounds. That addictive mind needed\nsomething new, and it fed on an activity he had first tried with his father at\nage 10. He recalls how an afternoon of panning with a friend at Mission Creek,\nnear his school, led to the very first \u201cbig haul\u201d: a series of thin flakes,\nwide and sparkling in the bottom of his pan. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be much for my\nstandards now, but it got me hooked good,\u201d he says.\n\nWe spend the entire morning on the Fraser, looking for \u201cpickers\u201d like these \u2014\nliterally gold flakes that are big enough to be picked off the bottom of the\npan. Flakes usually signal a bigger deposit of gold, whether it\u2019s embedded in\nquartz or just settled into a hole or crack along the exposed riverbed. But\npan after pan eludes Hurd and I, even after he busts out a small, lipstick-\nlike hand detector that\u2019s even more precise at sniffing gold than the\ntraditional metal detector we\u2019ve been using. I can see the edges of\nfrustration creeping onto Hurd\u2019s face as he digs into a wide crack of rock\nthat\u2019s been especially fruitful lately. He gives the dirt pile a wash in the\npan, peering into it while hunched over on a stone. \u201cFinally,\u201d he whispers,\nwaving me over. \u201cLook at that.\u201d It\u2019s a hunk of gold, shining up from the dull\ngreen pan, shaped like a pristine flake of earwax. Hurd promised me gold, and\nwe\u2019ve got it, albeit less than he hoped.\n\nShowing off gold is something Hurd does a lot of on his YouTube channel, which\nis the most rapidly growing example within a network of prospectors who show\noff their bounty online. The biggest is the American prospector Jeff Williams,\nwhose goofy, over-caffeinated style has earned him 133,000 subscribers.\nAnother popular prospector is Pioneer Pauly, whose slick video work and\nmillennial production value racks up hundreds of thousands of views. There are\nnewer channels from around the world, but the fan base remains similar \u2014\nmostly men, many who express they\u2019ve never prospected before or are just\nstarting to try it.\n\nHurd professes that he\u2019s got an addictive personality, one that helped\naccelerate his prospecting education. He combed through online forums for old\nposts on hotspots, hoping to dig harder where others had given up. Sometimes\nhe played trial-and-error in creeks, testing his memory of geological\nformations that could trap gold. It\u2019s a puzzle he can\u2019t resist. \u201cAfter such a\nlong winter this year, he was itching to get back out there,\u201d his wife Dayna\ntells me. \u201cHe\u2019s spent the last three weekends mining, and he\u2019s a happier\nperson for it. Prospecting has been fabulous for Dan\u2019s mental health.\u201d\n\nWhat transformed the hobby into a business, however, was the picking and\nselling of claims. You can purchase claims from another prospector, but the\nreal treasure hunt is in staking an \u201copen\u201d claim, meaning those that come on\nthe market because it has expired. That can happen because someone failed to\ndo any work on the site for a year, or forgot to file paperwork, but the\nprocess is simple: You sit at the computer, hitting refresh like you\u2019re\ngetting Coachella tickets. First come, first served. \u201cAlmost everything that\nhas gold on it is already owned by someone. So a lot of people are waiting for\na claim to be forfeited. There\u2019s probably a hundred people out ready to click\ntheir mouse when the claim comes online at 10 a.m.,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of us have\nthe timing down perfect. I got about one in 10 that I try.\u201d\n\nHurd evaluates each of his new claims, walking the land to gauge its potential\nand then panning by hand or cranking up the \u201chigh-banker\u201d (a sort of filtering\nmachine that uses pumped water) for evidence of gold. If it\u2019s good, he\u2019ll look\nfor a buyer \u2014 he sold his very first claim for $500. If it\u2019s really good,\nhe\u2019ll keep it for himself, at least for a little while. Hurd currently juggles\nbetween 20 to 30 claims in a year.\n\n### Popular\n\n  1. Real Italians Put Hot Dogs and French Fries on Their Pizza\n  2.

The $65 Million Art Heist That Put \u2018Ocean\u2019s Eleven\u2019 to Shame\n\nHurd and I drive to the tiny town of Yale, at the mouth of the Fraser Canyon,\nwhich once stood as a bustling hub of commerce when the Fraser gold rush\nkicked off in 1857. A community of 15,000 is now a tiny town of 200, comprised\nmostly of indigenous First Nations people, and these days its main draw is the\nYale Public Panning Reserve, a stretch of riverbed open to all prospectors.\nUpriver, the banks are claimed, making it illegal for other members of the\npublic to dig there.\n\nDuring the rush, the first man on a piece of land had to put literal stakes in\nthe ground to claim it, then find a way to get to a gold commissioner\u2019s office\nto register it, often risking life and limb to beat out (or beat up) competing\nminers. Historians now believe the Fraser Canyon gold rush was a direct\nextension of the iconic rush in California that took place just a decade\nprior, starting in 1848. As that rush matured and most of the accessible gold\nwas dug up, individual and small-group miners were pushed aside by large-scale\nhydraulic mining operations. The eyes of broke miners turned north when a\nshipment of gold ore was sent from Vancouver Island to the San Francisco Mint,\nindicating riches. More than 15,000 miners migrated into British Columbia, in\na move that defined the region\u2019s modern history.\n\nThe influx filled towns, spurred trade and spread prospecting knowledge. It\nalso led to bloody skirmishes, as whites from America and European migrants\nclashed with indigenous communities such as the Nlaka\u2019pamux, who were some of\nthe first to harvest large amounts of gold from the Fraser. The Fraser Canyon\nWar of 1858, incited by the alleged rape of a Nlaka\u2019pamux girl by a French\nprospector amid rising cultural tension, nearly destabilized the British\ncolony.\n\nThe aftermath was often ugly: The destructive mining practices of newcomers\npermanently impacted the natural environment, causing erosion, polluting the\nwaters and shifting salmon runs. But so many men touched by the rush ended up\nchasing it, anyway. \u201cBroader economic changes were transforming British\nColumbia. Indigenous people from all over B.C. were moving between different\nmining zones to take advantage of not just the gold harvesting but the\neconomic activities that accompanied the rush. This changed the human\nlandscape,\u201d says Mica Jorgeson, a postdoctorate fellow at McMaster University\nwho has done extensive research on Canada\u2019s gold rushes.\n\nBy the late 1800s, the culture of gold mining began to take irreversible\nshifts. The image of the independent miner-adventurer had been a reality in\nthe North American rushes, but the discovery of massive goldfields in South\nAfrica, and the need to dig so much earth to uncover them, subverted that\nmyth. Big costs favored large corporate entities that took investments and\nbought up land. The modern gold industry is defined by these types of\noperations, even if reality TV shows like Gold Rush depict financial successes\nfor smaller miners.\n\nThere is still something free about small-time prospecting, symbolized best by\nthe phenomenon of claim-jumping, in which someone illegally seizes another\u2019s\nclaim. It used to be that some jumpers, armed with rifles and revolvers, would\nhold a claim by force. These days, it\u2019s more passive than aggressive. Instead\nof stealing the claim, jumpers merely mine for gold on others\u2019 property.\nSometimes it\u2019s brazen, other times sneaky, but always present for someone who\nliterally puts footage of their gold-hunting on social media, Hurd observes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inviting it on myself. People watch what I post, and it\u2019s kind of funny\nhow a claim will have absolutely no activity forever until I post something\nabout it. Then all of a sudden I\u2019ll see holes mysteriously appear on that\nclaim,\u201d he says, lifting his brows in mock surprise. \u201cI\u2019m not so worried about\nthe people that just don\u2019t know better. A dad and his son coming out and\npanning for the day, and it happened to be on my claim. If I see that, I will\nwelcome them, let them know about the rule but not be bugged by it.\u201d\n\nHe narrows his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the people that know better that I\u2019m worried about.\nIn fact, we\u2019re going to go check some cameras now.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nWe stop for a quick lunch in Hope, B.C. before driving to a dirt road that\nspills from a foothill. He eyes my small Toyota Corolla before waving me into\nhis truck. \u201cI don\u2019t think the rental company wants you taking that up there,\u201d\nhe cracks, and the truth of that statement becomes clear as we meander up the\npath, rocking in our seats as we traverse large rocks and potholes. At times,\nit feels like the road is barely wide enough for the truck, but it eventually\nopens onto a flat piece of land littered with piles of broken wood, bombed-out\nfurnishings, random detritus and the occasional hypodermic needle. \u201cIt\nactually looks like someone came up here and cleaned the place up,\u201d Hurd says\nwith a pleased shrug. \u201cI wonder who it was.\u201d\n\nWe get out and walk through the debris, following a crumbly dirt path along a\nsteep drop. Up ahead, I can see the mouth of the Blue Chip mine, a favorite\nspot of Hurd\u2019s where he\u2019s shot multiple YouTube videos over the past year.\nUnlike at the Fraser, there\u2019s no panning for gold here \u2014 instead, Hurd is\ndigging out quartz stone from a wide seam that runs along the edge of the\nmine, then pulverizing and filtering the remains to unlock any gold in the\nrock. It\u2019s a lucrative way to mine if you can find the right seam, and\nfrustrating if you can\u2019t.\n\nStrangers have been prodding around here \u2014 a few unfamiliar holes and chunks\nof rock prove that someone is still claim-jumping here despite the bright\nyellow signs that declare Hurd\u2019s right to the property. \u201cNo one who can\nenforce the law cares, of course. It\u2019s just a hassle for everyone,\u201d Hurd says\nwith a sigh and a smile. \u201cThe authorities don\u2019t want to deal with it. There\u2019s\nbigger fish for them to fry than someone sneaking on a claim. The mines\nregulators want to deal with big operations. They want to prevent another\nMount Polley mining disaster.\u201d\n\nFor now, Hurd\u2019s got to deal with trespassers on his own. He calls me over to a\nlog on the ground near the mine\u2019s entrance, where he\u2019s hidden a trail camera\nthat\u2019s triggered by motion. It\u2019s one of a half-dozen cameras he recently\nbought, believing that his YouTube videos have led some unscrupulous viewers\nto the mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge deal, but maybe if I capture faces we can put\n\u2018em up on a video, shame them a little bit,\u201d he says.\n\nPeople used to get shot over their claims, but getting value out of a spot\nlike the Blue Chip is a marathon, not a sprint, requiring days of work just to\nunderstand the innate uniqueness of the rock and soil. In a coincidence, a\nclose friend of Hurd\u2019s, now in his mid-80s, used to prospect the Blue Chip\nmine in the 1970s and found little evidence of riches, even if the site was\nbeautiful. That did nothing to deter Hurd, and a siren song brings him up the\nmountain every few weeks. Sometimes he finds a bit of gold. Other times he\nfinds nothing but beautiful, otherworldly ice stalagmites, rising from the\nground at the mouth of the cave.\n\nThere have only been a handful of times that Hurd regretted giving up a claim.\nHis biggest sale ever came a few years ago, after he took two international\nprospectors to a favorite spot on the Fraser. An afternoon of mining inspired\nthe duo to ask Hurd about an offer for the claim, which he quickly declined.\n\u201cThen they basically brought out a blank checkbook and asked me what my price\nwas,\u201d Hurd recalls. \u201cI said a five-figure number that I thought was\noutrageous. To my surprise, they said yes.\u201d\n\nLooking back, Hurd wonders whether he misjudged the value of that space, given\nhow happy he was to prospect there. Getting rich off gold has never really\nbeen Hurd\u2019s M.O. \u2014 he\u2019s happier as an educator, and there\u2019s plenty of people\nlooking for guidance in this old craft. Jorgeson, the researcher, tells me\nthat public prospectors like Hurd are the newest extension of a tradition that\nhas seemingly always been admired. So much so that her research suggests there\nwas a fear in the early 20th century that a loss of prospecting culture amid\nrapid industrialization would be a national failing.\n\n\u201cIt was this feeling that we\u2019re losing the salt-of-the-earth guy who can go\ninto the bush and read a rock because he\u2019s done it a million times. But there\nwere actually always individuals from different backgrounds who built a\nrelationship to the landscape through this labor. That continues into the\npresent,\u201d Jorgeson says. \u201cRemember, even during the rushes, there were a lot\nof highly funded operations, not just individuals in the wilderness. The\nlatter were a minority then, too. But Dan is filling that role in the\npresent.\u201d\n\nHurd and I spend as much time poking around the innards of the Blue Chip mine\nas we do looking at the quartz seam outside of it, and I\u2019m struck by the\nserenity of sitting in a pitch-black cave, imagining the veins of gold\nspreading along the rocky roof. Eventually, we decide to pack up and head back\ndown the mountain, and as I get out of his pickup, Hurd jokes that he\u2019ll\nhopefully have more gold to show me if I visit another time. As we drive out\nof Hope, I wonder if maybe finding so little gold was the best takeaway of\nall.\n\nI think back to our morning on the Fraser, when Hurd told me I\u2019ve made it up\nto the river just in time. The spring runoff is about to hit in full force,\nwhich makes it dangerous to prospect along the fast-flowing water. But there\u2019s\na critical purpose to this annual cycle. \u201cIn a couple weeks\u2019 time, this water\nwill be way over our heads, and it will just wash all of this clean,\u201d Hurd\nsaid, pointing to the chipped shale and dirt around our feet. \u201cAnd with that,\ncomes more gold.\u201d\n\nI will likely never return to that stretch of river and canyon, as beautiful\nas it is. Hurd will, however, again and again until something almost\nintangible tells him the hunt is over.
