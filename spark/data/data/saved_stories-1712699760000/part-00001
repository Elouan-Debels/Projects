There\u2019s always been something about the format that\nnever really sat right with me; each entry presents work I\u2019ve done, sometimes\nrepresenting many multiple years of my life, without explaining the \u201cwhy\u201d or\nthe through-line of how I got there. It\u2019s always felt to me like they\u2019re\nmissing the fundamentals of the human being behind them \u2014 the values and\nmindsets of the living, breathing person you\u2019d actually be hiring.\n\nOn top of that, mine was stuck in a document, when all of my work is on the\nweb.\n\nSo I set out to rewrite mine, make it web-first, and turn it into something\nthat I feel like actually represents me and my career. You can check it out\nhere: I gave it its own subdomain at resume.werd.io.\n\nThe default version now displays my career in chronological order, each life\nevent building on the next, and includes things that, while not technically\nbeing work, informed the work I\u2019ve subsequently done. You\u2019ll find stuff like\nthe electronic hypertext magazine I built as a teenager and the popular meme\nsite I built at university, which wouldn\u2019t normally find their way into a\nstandard resum\u00e9, but do help define my expertise and how I approach projects.\n\nFrom that page, you can flip to a more traditional reverse-chronological\nresum\u00e9 that omits the non-employment content and removes unnecessary\ndescription. Because it\u2019s an edited-down version of my story, rather than a\ncollection of bullet points, it\u2019s probably better than any resum\u00e9 I\u2019ve had in\nthe past. It\u2019s web-first but there are a few print-only CSS rules in there to\nmake sure it prints or turns into a PDF really nicely. It\u2019s also nicely\nresponsive, so it displays well on both a laptop / desktop and a phone.\n\nBehind the scenes, here\u2019s how it works:\n\n  * Each element of my experience is a standalone HTML snippet file of the form startyear-endyear.html. Some are annotated to be \u201cnarrative-only\u201d, which means that they won\u2019t show up in the traditional view. The engine I wrote for this will also omit any entries marked \u201ctraditional-only\u201d from the narrative view, but in practice I didn\u2019t use that.\n  * In narrative view, the engine reads the files in alphabetical order. In traditional view, the engine reads them in reverse-alphabetical order. The effect is to order the entries chronologically or reverse-chronologically as described.\n  * Educational entries are marked as such. In narrative view they\u2019re placed into the main flow; in traditional view they\u2019re displayed at the end of the document.\n  * In narrative view, any HTML element with a class traditional is marked as display:none in order to hide it; in traditional view, any HTML element with a class narrative is hidden. This allows me to mix narrative content in with more traditional resum\u00e9 content and only display them in one view.\n  * Everything is marked up with the h-resume microformat.\n\nThe most important thing for me was being able to write my story as a story,\nand then edit down accordingly. I\u2019m pretty happy with it!
