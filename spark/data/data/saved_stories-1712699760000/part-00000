After being convicted and sentenced to death, he was sent to\nLouisiana State Penitentiary, known by prisoners, guards and locals as Angola\nafter a slave plantation that previously existed on the site. Rideau was given\nthe label C-18. The C stood for \u201ccondemned\u201d, and the number denoted his place\non the death-row list. His fate was to be the electric chair.\n\nRideau lived in isolation on death row for more than a decade, and read\nvoraciously. He became interested in journalism and started to write. By the\nmid-1970s he was living in the main prison and editing the penitentiary\u2019s in-\nhouse monthly magazine, the Angolite. In the end Rideau avoided execution, and\ntoday he is undoubtedly Angola\u2019s most famous former prisoner. Under Rideau\u2019s\n20-year editorship, the magazine won many national awards, but he first made\nhis name as a prison reporter with a column he called The Jungle. The very\nfirst topic he chose was the working of the prison economy.\n\nToday there are almost 2.3 million prisoners in the US \u2013 by far the highest\nnumber of any country in the world. Louisiana today has the second-highest\nincarceration rate in the US (after Oklahoma overtook it in 2018), with a male\nincarceration rate that far exceeds the national average, and Angola is the\nstate\u2019s only maximum-security jail. It is also the country\u2019s largest, covering\nan 18,000-acre site that is larger than Manhattan. On a mission to investigate\nthe world\u2019s most extreme economies, I set out for Angola. My hunch was that I\nwould find examples of simplistic barter; what I discovered was an innovative,\ncomplex and modern system of hidden trade that offers an important lesson\nabout the way economies work.\n\nLouisiana state penitentiary. Photograph: Aerial Archives/Alamy\n\nServing prisoners and ex-convicts say the first law of prison economics is\nunsatisfied demand and the innovation that it stimulates. Cut off from the\noutside, prisoners find themselves lacking staples and unable to make choices\nthat they had previously taken for granted. The urge to get hold of simple\nmaterial goods is strong, and prisoners I met described the first few weeks\ninside as a shock during which time they learn the rules of their new world\nand adapt to the reality that they have lost not only their freedom but also\ntheir possessions. Today in Louisiana new inmates receive basic supplies:\nstandard-issue clothing, a bar of soap and some lotion. But there are lots of\nday-to-day items they lack and want: deodorant, decent jeans, better sneakers.\nIt was the same in the 1960s, Rideau told me when we met in Baton Rouge,\nLouisiana\u2019s capital: while you got simple provisions, a lot of effort went\ninto getting hold of extra comforts.\n\nSome goods are available via official channels, but getting hold of them takes\na long time. When a prisoner in Angola orders a book or is sent one, it can\ntake six months, or longer, to reach them, since censors need to check the\ncontent. The delay is an example of a general theme in the Louisiana prison\neconomy: it operates in a time warp.\n\nTime works differently in Louisiana prisons in part because the state\u2019s\nsentences have, historically, been so long. Reforms since 2017 have begun to\nmake some sentencing guidelines more lenient, but for decades everyone\nconvicted of murder in the state got a mandatory life sentence, as did any\naccomplices or friends who were at the scene. Even nonviolent crimes have\noften led to huge sentences in Louisiana. Mandatory sentences for repeat\noffenders often doubled with each conviction. There was also, until recently,\nanother rule that meant a fourth offence could have a mandatory minimum of 20\nyears and a maximum of life in jail. I met one ex-Angola resident, Louis, who\nspent 20 years in Angola on a drug charge. He explained his case isn\u2019t the\nworst: Timothy Jackson, a man caught stealing a jacket from a shop more than\n20 years ago, is set to spend the rest of his life in Angola. The average\nsentence in Angola is almost 90 years.\n\nIn many prisons, simple goods that are cheap and insignificant on the outside\ncan have huge value inside; in facilities like Angola, the ultra-long\nsentences take this to another level. In his memoir, In the Place of Justice,\nRideau explains how tiny improvements can transform a prisoner\u2019s life. Like\nthe other men on death row, he was confined to a small cell. Three of the\nwalls \u2013 the back and two sides \u2013 were brick. The front wall was a grid of\nbars, offering no privacy as guards and other prisoners walked past, and\nletting in a cold draught during winter. Getting hold of a blanket or a\ncurtain to hang over the bars could have a transformative effect on an\ninmate\u2019s life. When your world shrinks to a three-sided box, a piece of cloth\nthat will grant you privacy and warmth becomes a fundamental need you will\nwork hard to satisfy.\n\nOne way for an inmate to improve his lot in Angola is through official work.\nAnother nickname for the penitentiary is \u201cthe Farm\u201d \u2013 it is surrounded by\nfields planted with crops including corn, wheat, sorghum, soybeans and cotton.\nInmates toil all year, including in August, when temperatures can rise to\naround 38C. Fruit and vegetables are grown and supplied across the state\nprison system. It also raises revenue: Louisiana\u2019s Prison Enterprises, which\nsells goods produced by inmates, brought in almost $29m in 2016, much of it\nfrom Angola.\n\nThe prisoners\u2019 official work schedule is designed to take up most of their\nday. Inmates cannot refuse to work, and the vast majority have a job of some\nkind (exceptions include men on death row or in solitary confinement). There\nis a clear hierarchy of jobs, and those in the fields are at the bottom. One\ncurrent prisoner explained to me why being sent out \u201cpicking greens\u201d is the\nworst gig in the prison: the shift lasts eight hours and it is hot, hard work.\nThe men work in parallel lines, tossing waste plant matter to their side.\nAccidentally hitting another prisoner with a discarded stalk can cause a\nfight; cutting your own hand while picking can be taken as an attempt at self-\nharm, leading to a tedious investigation. Those who serve a full decade\nwithout breaking any rules \u2013 fighting or self-harm can both set the clock back\nto zero \u2013 are awarded \u201ctrusty\u201d status. These prisoners get prized jobs such as\nworking as a caddy at the guards\u2019 golf club, or as a cleaner at the small\nmuseum devoted to the history of the penitentiary located just outside the\nmain gates.\n\nThe official payroll at Angola works on a different scale from the outside\nworld. For years, inmates say, pay in the penitentiary ranged from 2\u00a2 to 20\u00a2\nper hour. While recent reforms lift this, most of those I spoke to said\npicking greens or other basic farm work would earn just 4\u00a2 per hour, giving\nthem a weekly wage of $1.60. At this pay rate a convict must work for 181\nhours to earn $7.25, the federal minimum hourly wage in the US. Those on the\nhigher rates of pay can be quickly demoted. One lifer explained how his\ntrusted status was revoked and his pay put to the bottom of the scale when he\nwas accused of taking a wrench from the workshop, something he said he did not\ndo. Whatever the truth, with good behaviour he can expect an annual raise of\n4\u00a2 \u2013 it could take him several years to get back to the higher scale. Work in\nAngola is hard, mandatory and not lucrative.\n\nPrisoners at work at the Angola penitentiary.

These official shops are a lifeline for prisoners\nseeking material comforts. In Angola they carry Russell Athletic sweatshirts,\nFruit of the Loom T-shirts and a range of footwear. The other big category is\nfood. The inmates are served three meals a day but say they are tasteless; by\ncontrast, the commissary offers snacks such as sweet and hot Asian sauce,\nTexas Tito\u2019s jumbo whole dill pickles and jalape\u00f1o-flavoured cheese curls. The\nquantities Angola orders reveal the scale of the operation: a recent document\nsets out a tender for 3,000 boxes \u2013 312,000 packets \u2013 of Cool Ranch-flavour\nDoritos.\n\nPrisoners know they are a captive market. The biggest complaints are about the\nprices: prisoners are convinced they are being ripped off, paying more than\nthey would in the outside world, and that their cost of living is rising\nfaster than their wages. They have a case. Until recently, pay scales in\nAngola have been held at the level seen in the 1970s. A packet of rolling\ntobacco back then retailed at less than 50\u00a2, so an inmate on 20\u00a2 could earn a\npacket in half a day. Today it costs around $8 \u2013 they would need to work a\nfull week to buy a pack.\n\nLouisiana is not alone in requiring its prisoners to work on pay scales that\nbear no relation to the cost of goods they might want to buy. Legally\nspeaking, prisoners do not need to be paid at all (the US constitution\u2019s 13th\namendment prohibits all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude, \u201cexcept as\npunishment for crime\u201d). Prisoners in Georgia make furniture and road signs,\nand receive no payment. In Missouri, convicts are paid $7.50 a month for full-\ntime work \u2013 an hourly rate of around 4\u00a2. The UK\u2019s system is less extreme, but\nsimilar. Pay rates average around \u00a310 for a 35-hour week, and the same price\ncomplaints arise: favourite canteen purchases \u2013 a bag of salted nuts, noodles,\nbreakfast cereal \u2013 often sell for over \u00a32. Earning one of these items on\nprison pay can be almost a full day\u2019s work.\n\nIn many ways, a prison\u2019s official economy is like that of a regular town. In\nAngola there is a world of work, with jobs and pay, promotions and demotions.\nAnd there is a world of shopping, with consumer goods and stores. But prisons\nare economic systems in which the cost of goods bears no relation to wages or\nthe buying power of the workforce. The most important connections of a market\neconomy \u2013 the prices that link work and pay, demand and supply \u2013 have been\nsevered, intentionally, by the authorities. The official prison economy\nexists, but it may as well not, leaving the prisoners to build their own\nunderground markets.\n\nIn the underground prison economy, things that might seem simple are hard, and\nthings that might seem impossible can be pretty easy. The case of John Goodlow\nand his pecans illustrates why. For 20 years Goodlow was the pecan king of\nAngola, Wilbert Rideau told me. Pecan nuts are grown across the US south, and\nhomemade pecan pralines are a favourite treat in Louisiana. Goodlow made his\nown \u2013 the best ever, said Rideau, \u201cbetter than outside\u201d \u2013 and sold squares of\nit for $2. He probably could have raised his prices, said Rideau: they were so\nsought after that Goodlow had often pre-sold a whole batch before he had even\nfinished cooking it.\n\nThe fact that making pralines was possible in a maximum-security prison is\nsurprising. Cooking them requires lots of ingredients, as well as pots, a\nhotplate and an oven. \u201cPrisoners are never powerless,\u201d Rideau said. \u201cThey\nalways have the power of rebellion, violence, and just screwing up operations\nand making life hard for the management.\u201d The power prisoners have means that\nmanagement often cooperate, and facilitate certain requests, he explained. In\nprisons, on low-level matters, power is shared, and there is room for simple\ntradeoffs. So getting hold of a pan can be fairly easy.\n\nBut some things that are mundane outside are outlawed in jail. Anything that\nraises the probability of escape or violence is banned: weapons, drugs,\ncigarette lighters, mobile phones. But a host of innocent-seeming items are\ncontraband, too: savoury spreads like Marmite contain yeast and can be used in\nillicit brewing; chewing gum can be used to make an imprint of a key or lock;\nbaby oil can make an inmate\u2019s arms slippery, rendering them impossible to\nrestrain.\n\nInside Angola prison. Photograph: Giles Clarke/Getty\n\nPhysical money itself counts as contraband. Instead, prisoners\u2019 wages are\nloaded on to cash cards that can be used at the commissary. This keeps hard\ncash out of prisoners\u2019 hands and is a way to deprive powerful inmates of\nresources that could help them bribe guards. The logic means cash is treated\nas top-level contraband, and any prisoner with \u201ctrusty\u201d status caught handling\nit loses their privileges.\n\nThe lack of cash is a problem for prisoners operating one of the businesses to\nwhich guards tend to turn a blind eye: baking pecans, selling fried chicken,\ngrooming services ranging from haircuts to tattoos to shirt-pressing. These\nprisoner entrepreneurs can offer the goods or service, but cannot accept cash\nas payment. One Angola inmate told me that a prisoner with a spotless record\nfor good behaviour would be unlikely to take a $5 bill as payment, even if the\nitem being sold is worth $2. Money is too risky to hold \u2013 making US prisons\none of the few places on earth where the dollar is not accepted. Instead,\nprisoners are pushed towards a barter economy, in which goods are swapped\nrather than bought and sold with money.\n\nThe problem with barter is that it can be hard to find a swap that works.\nOften the person who wants what you are offering will not own the thing you\nwant. Economists have called the rare situation in which a swap will work out\nthe \u201cdouble coincidence of wants\u201d, ever since William Stanley Jevons explained\nthe problems with barter, and how money solved them, in his 1875 book Money\nand the Mechanism of Exchange. Jevons outlined four separate roles that money\ncan play. First, money is a medium of exchange, something that everyone\naccepts and that \u201clubricates the action of exchange\u201d. Second, it is a\n\u201cmeasure\u201d \u2013 the way that prices are set out today. Third, it is a \u201cstandard\u201d\nby which future prices may be set. Finally, it is a way to \u201cstore\u201d value \u2013 it\ncan transport economic value over distances or through time.\n\nBecause lots of things have the properties Jevons set out, lots of things can\nbecome a circulating currency. When a currency emerges in this unofficial way,\nit often has particular physical attributes that make it suitable. Above all,\nit must be an object that can change hands hundreds of times without losing\nvalue. Consumer goods \u2013 clothes, shoes, books \u2013 would be no good as currency\nsince once they are bought they become second-hand and their price drops.\nCommodities \u2013 salt, sugar or grain \u2013 are much better currencies: second-hand\nsalt is as good as new.\n\nFurthermore, a commodity tends to make a good currency if it is \u201cdivisible\u201d \u2013\neasily chopped up and used in smaller trades. Another key criterion is\ndurability. Food commodities that rot or spoil would make a poor currency. And\nfinally, ease and cost of transport matters. Cotton, which is divisible and\ndurable, may seem like a good informal currency, but it is so light that it\nlacks value in small quantities: any meaningful trade would require\ntransporting huge sacks of it.\n\nPrisons have a rich tradition of inventing informal currencies. The most\nobvious prison currency \u2013 always saleable and easily divisible \u2013 is tobacco.\nFor a century, underground trading in Angola ran on it. But in 2015 smoking\nwas banned, and tobacco and cigarettes became contraband. Around the same\ntime, an aggressive new drug called mojo \u2013 a type of synthetic cannabis \u2013\nbegan to infiltrate the prison, and many men became hooked. The underground\neconomy was rocked. Its currency was now illegal, yet there was huge demand\nfor this new drug. The foundations of the prison economy had shifted: what\nmany men wanted changed, as did the way they could pay for it.\n\nThe response in Angola, and across Louisiana\u2019s prisons, was to adapt rapidly,\ninventing a new currency, one that is as high-tech as the designer drug it is\noften used to purchase.\n\nOn my second trip to Louisiana, I arranged to meet an ex-convict in his\nmid-30s who had recently been released after 16 years in state prisons,\nincluding Angola. \u201cMost people in prison are looking for some kind of way to\nget high,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a way to kill time.\u201d But there is a more specific\nreason why mojo took off so quickly: \u201cIt changes so much that it is hard for\nthem to drug test for it.\u201d Continual adjustment of the compounds used in\nsynthetic cannabis means there are thousands of variants, making detection\ndifficult.\n\nLouisiana prisoners remember mojo first appearing in 2010 or 2011. One ex-\nconvict I met in New Orleans remembered the rumours: \u201cEveryone was like: \u2018You\ncan smoke it and pass the drugs test.\u2019 But in my mind I was like: \u2018They test\nyou for THC, so if it is not THC that is getting you high, what is getting you\nhigh?\u2019\u201d It was a wise decision to be cautious, he recalled: \u201cI said no, but\nthey all started smoking it. Some started having seizures and aneurysms, and\npeople were freaking out and getting paranoid and scared. I saw a dude get\nbutt-naked and jump in a dumpster and refuse to come out. They were going\ncrazy on it. But they loved it.\u201d\n\nThe first rule of prison economics is unsatisfied demand, and on this measure\nmojo had become king in Louisiana\u2019s prisons. The demand was huge. Once the\ndrug had been smuggled in, the only challenge that remained was how to pay the\nsmugglers. The informal currencies used inside the prison are often of no real\nuse outside, so prisoners running serious hustles like mojo smuggling don\u2019t\nuse them \u2013 the way to persuade guards to smuggle contraband in is with cash.\n\nThe use of dollars inside the prison is a puzzle. Anyone running a major drug\noperation is going to need to shift large cash balances, but dollar bills are\nsomething sniffer dogs can detect, and any digital transfers can be traced. It\nturns out that drug traders and smugglers face none of these risks, because\nLouisiana prisons have a remarkable new currency innovation. \u201cCash is\ncontraband, but people have got cash,\u201d the former prisoner explained, \u201cbut it\nis not cash like cash in hand. It is untraceable. It is all based on numbers.\nPeople pay each other with dots.\u201d\n\nLife inside Angola. Photograph: Gilles Mingasson/Getty\n\nThe new \u201cdot\u201d payment system is the latest in the ever-evolving system of\nprison currencies. This new form of money started with a technological\ninnovation. It was an idea that Blockbuster video came up with in the\nmid-1990s to replace the old, inefficient system of paper gift certificates:\nits first store card. Plastic and shaped like a credit card, it could be\nloaded with dollars. Unlike a paper gift certificate, it was durable, allowing\nparents and relatives to make periodic uploads as part of an allowance. The\ncard formed a so-called \u201cclosed loop\u201d between the person loading the credit,\nthe company providing the goods and the person consuming them. Other stores\nquickly followed suit. By the late 1990s, most retailers had adopted some form\nof gift-credit system using plastic cards.\n\nFinancial firms spotted an opportunity, and soon offered their own cards.\nMoney still had to be pre-loaded on to these cards, but the system was now an\n\u201copen loop\u201d. The cards were not restricted to a specific store \u2013 the\ncardholder could spend the money anywhere, or even withdraw it as cash. The\nidea was that the cards would be used by young adults \u2013 parents loading\ncollege kids\u2019 cards with a monthly allowance \u2013 or as a modern alternative to\ntraveller\u2019s cheques.\n\nThe use of prepaid cards has rocketed in the US in the past 20 years. Usage\ntripled from 3.3bn transactions in 2006 to 9.9bn in 2015. While the innovation\nwas a hit, the initial customers the financiers had in mind \u2013 well-to-do\nparents, cash-rich retirees on trips to Venice \u2013 were way off. Prepaid cards\nare favoured by people with a poor credit history, usually because they have\noverdue debts or are recent immigrants. In the US, users are more likely to be\nAfrican American, female, unemployed and/or have no college degree. The cards\nare predominantly used in the south, most of all in Texas.\n\nGet the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday\nmorning\n\nThe name of the prisoners\u2019 new currency comes from the popular Green Dot brand\nof these cards, which carry the Visa or Mastercard logo and can be used to\nmake purchases wherever regular credit and debit cards are accepted. Some\nusers have found ways to set up an account for the card without using their\ntrue identification details. They then buy a second card, this one a single-\nuse scratch card called a MoneyPak, which is used to load the debit card with\ncredit of anywhere between $20 and $500. Both cards can be bought pretty much\nanywhere: at Walmart, at CVS or any other pharmacy. Scratching away the back\nof a MoneyPak reveals a 14-digit number. This number, the \u201cdots\u201d, is the vital\nlink, carrying up to $500 of buying power. The user goes online, logs in to\ntheir account and enters the number, and the credit appears, instantly, on\ntheir debit card.\n\nThe person buying the Green Dot card can pay in cash, as can the person buying\na $500 MoneyPak, so there is no trace of who owns them. The beneficiary of the\ncredit does not need to see the MoneyPak itself \u2013 all they need are the\nnumbers. Texting someone the 14-digit \u201cdots\u201d using a contraband phone, sending\nthem a photo or letter with the numbers, or simply communicating the numbers\nover a telephone call will do. The dots are a currency close to cash: an\ninstant, simple and safe transfer of value over long distance.\n\nTo make a large cash payment, a prisoner asks a friend on the outside to buy a\nMoneyPak and to pass on the dots once they have done so. These 14 digits can\nthen be exchanged with a guard or another prisoner for something in the\nprison, including drugs. By exchanging dots instead of cash, the prisoners\nkeep their hands clean. The free people on the outside \u2013 one buying the\nMoneyPak, the other receiving its value on a Green Dot card \u2013 do not need to\nmeet each other, know each other or link bank accounts. Using prepaid cards in\nthis way creates an informal currency that is durable, divisible into payments\nas small as the MoneyPak minimum of $20, and is accepted everywhere. It fits\nprecisely the standards for a good currency that Victorian economists set out\nin the 19th century.\n\nThere are broader lessons from this currency invention. Many policymakers\nregard the rise of online banking as a way to tackle illicit trade and money-\nlaundering, because banking digitally leaves a trace. This should mean that\ndigital economies are easier to police than cash-based ones. Some countries\nare even considering banning paper money entirely as a way to clean up their\neconomies. Yet an understanding of how currency innovation works suggests\nthese hopes are credulous: from remote islands to high-security prisons, money\ninvention is informal, organic and \u2013 as Louisiana\u2019s prisons show \u2013 can now be\nuntraceable. The new digital \u201cdot\u201d currency is reportedly already being used\nto launder cash across national borders.\n\nDespite the damage illicit prison markets can do, one ex-convict in his 30s\ndefended the underground prison economy to me: \u201cI\u2019ve got friends inside. This\nis how they support their families.\u201d He said most prisoners have limited\nchance to improve their lot. \u201cSo they sell drugs, they run tickets and they\ngamble; this is how they make their money.\u201d Veterans who have spent decades in\nLouisiana\u2019s prisons defend their economy too, insisting that underground\nexchanges are a way to keep life inside the prison calm.Simple trades \u2013\nhaircuts, pecans, books, shirt pressing and even tattoos \u2013 that were once made\nusing tobacco have shifted to alternative currencies including coffee, packets\nof noodles and even tins of mackerel. They are a way to make the ultra-long\nLouisiana sentences a little easier to bear.\n\nThe simple idea that could transform US criminal justice | Tina Rosenberg\n\nRead more\n\nFor those concerned about the future, the hidden economies of the Louisiana\nprison system offer a vital lesson. It stems from the power of the informal\neconomy in enabling a society to recover from a shock, and the extraordinary\nlevels of effort and innovation that people will use to establish a trading\nsystem if theirs is damaged or destroyed.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s prisons have parallel economies. There is the illicit drug economy\nthat runs on its untraceable dot currency, and alongside it a more innocent\nmarketplace where basic necessities are mediated with some agreed item \u2013\ncurrently coffee \u2013 acting as a currency. Trades in both economies work because\nof the most basic law of prison economics \u2013 that a prison is a place defined\nby unsatisfied needs, tastes and demands. Both economies are self-built,\norganic and highly innovative. Both show that a currency, the provision of\nwhich can seem like the ultimate role of the state in an economy, can be\nestablished completely informally. Prisons show that the human urge to trade\nand exchange is impossible to repress, and that solutions to future challenges\nare as likely to come from informal markets as formal ones.\n\nAdapted from Extreme Economies: Survival, Failure, Future \u2013 Lessons from the\nWorld\u2019s Limits by Richard Davies, published by Bantam Press on 5 September and\navailable at guardianbookshop.com\n\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read\nweekly email here.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * The long read\n  * US prisons\n  * Prisons and probation\n  * UK criminal justice\n  * Economics\n  * Economic policy\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
