The graph correctly shows that US deaths\nfrom infectious disease have decreased a lot over the last hundred years. The\ngraph incorrectly makes it seem like death rates from other causes have been\nstable over this period. The age-adjusted death rate has decreased by around\n50% since 1950. Death rates at every age band have been meaningfully\ndecreasing, apart from the impact of COVID-19.\n\nHere's the graph in Outlive:\n\nWhat a remarkably horizontal white line! It supports Attia's position, in that\nhe's arguing that we need to invest more in fighting other causes of death\n(heart disease, cancer, dementia, diabetes) so he's trying to make them seem\nlike big unsolved problems. And certainly, they are big unsolved problems. But\nthe claim that mortality rates haven't been improving is misleading.\n\nLet's first go to the graph in The Rise and Fall of American Growth:\n\nAttia copied this graph fairly exactly, except for adding \"top\" before and\nremoving the asterisk after \"diseases,\" which is just as well since the\nasterisk doesn't seem to have an explanation in Growth anyway.\n\nSuch a horizontal white line! Here, it supports Gordon's position, in that\nhe's arguing that things were getting better in the US from 1870-1970, but\nthings aren't getting better so much any more. So here's a decrease that stops\ndecreasing by 1970.\n\nThe biggest problem with this presentation is that the data is not age-\nadjusted, and as such it's sensitive to the distribution of ages in the\npopulation. For example, with low death rates for people in their early years,\none way to lower the raw death rate is to arrange for the birth of a lot of\nbabies. The raw death rate doesn't tell us much about anything in particular,\nand certainly isn't the \"real\" death rate in any meaningful way. Let's compare\nwith a CDC graph that is age-adjusted:\n\nThe green line is the age-adjusted death rate. It was 1,446 in 1950, 1,222.6\nin 1970, and 723.6 in 2018. That's a 50% improvement from 1950, and a 41%\nimprovement from 1970.\n\nAdjusting for age is important, because for example, when people don't die\nyoung, you get more old people. Baby booms and so on also matter. The\npopulation pyramid looks different now than it did in 1900. Compare the 1900\nand 2000 shapes as presented in a Stanford visualization:\n\nBoth the raw and age-adjusted overall death rates don't tell us everything\nabout what's happening at every age, so let's look at that. Here are death\nrates for the oldest nine age buckets in data from the Human Mortality\nDatabase from 1933 to 2021, shown with a quick graph I made.\n\nEvery age group is seeing decreasing death rates up until COVID-19 impacts\n2020 numbers. I left out younger age bands to avoid crowding, but those also\nshow improvement, especially for the youngest.\n\nFor people 85-89, the death rate per 1,000 was 179.87 in 1950, and 154.77 in\n1970. It was 103.14 in 2018. That's a 43% improvement since 1950, and 33%\nimprovement from 1970. Even the COVID-19 spike takes us back only to around\nthe same levels as we saw in 2000.\n\nThings have been improving. Improving since 1950, improving since 1970,\nimproving since 2000 apart from COVID-19. It just isn't accurate to suggest\nthat death rates haven't been going down over these periods. There's still\nroom for improvement, but the real gains should be celebrated, not ignored.\n\nThe question of whether life expectancies have leveled off or even decreased\nover shorter, more recent periods is quite distinct from the trend over these\nlonger periods.\n\nI attempted to replicate Gordon's graph using the HSUS data. He cites\nAb929-943, which includes ten columns of infectious disease death, by my\ncount. He uses Ab952 for the total death rate, I believe.\n\nIt adds only confusion that Gordon's figure is titled \"Mortality Rate as\nPercentage of GNP\" (emphasis added). He also cites HSUS series Bd46\n(percentage of GNP spent on health care from 1929 to 1997) and 2012 SAUS table\n134 (health care spending). This seems to be a leftover of an idea from an\nearlier paper. Gordon's footnote 22 says that his figure \"is an update of\nMcKinlay and McKinlay (1977, figure 3, p. 416)\" so let's track that down.\n\nThe paper is The Questionable Contribution of Medical Measures to the Decline\nof Mortality in the United States in the Twentieth Century. It has this Figure\n3:\n\nThere is no horizontal white line here. The presentation is quite different,\narguably better for showing the decrease in death from infectious disease.\nMcKinlay and McKinlay seem to have known to use age-adjusted statistics as\nwell. More relevant to the discussion of GNP, however, their paper has this\nFigure 2:\n\nThe point it's making is that increased spending on health care doesn't seem\nto be driving a lot of increased reduction in death rate. There's something to\nthis argument, but 50 years later we can also see (in the CDC graph above)\nthat the period roughly 1955-1965 was a fairly flat spot on the death rate\ngraph, with improvement continuing after it.\n\nGordon mentions the concern that spending on health care isn't delivering\nmatching results in death rate improvement, but it doesn't make it into his\nfigure apart from the title and data citations.\n\nThe horizontal white line is basically a coincidence as death has been\nshifting from younger to older people over time and the population pyramid has\nbeen changing shape. This graph is misleading.\n\nIf you sign up, I'll send you an email update at most monthly with new stuff.\n\nThis site also has RSS.
