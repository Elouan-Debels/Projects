We\u2019re thrilled to launch this\nblog as the hub for informing you about Microsoft\u2019s work on Go. You\u2019ll also\nsee posts about deploying Go workloads on Azure, and Go programming within the\nMicrosoft ecosystem.\n\n### Our Goal: Fostering Collaboration and Innovation\n\nOur goal with this blog is to inform users and customers of what we are doing\nto ensure that Go is well supported on Azure. We envision this platform as a\nspace for meaningful discussions, learning opportunities, and sharing best\npractices for Go Developers deploying to Azure.\n\n### Contributing to the Go Ecosystem\n\nA significant portion of our work involves making Go applications more\ncompatible with the Windows APIs and services. This includes efforts to\nsupport debugging, profiling, troubleshooting, and monitoring functionalities,\nensuring seamless integration with the Windows environment.\n\nAdditionally, we devote considerable resources to making Go crypto FIPS 140-2\ncompatible. We do this by leveraging OpenSSL and Windows CNG as the underlying\ncryptographic libraries. This work underscores our commitment to enhancing the\nsecurity and reliability of Go applications in enterprise environments.\n\n### \u201cUpstream Everything\u201d Philosophy\n\nOne of the key principles guiding our approach to Go development at Microsoft\nis our commitment to open collaboration and contribution. We believe in the\npower of the open-source community and recognise the importance of giving\nback. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to follow our \u201cupstream everything\u201d philosophy\nwithin the team. Microsoft intends to upstream all patches \u2013 subject to them\nbeing accepted upstream of course!\n\n### Join Us on this Journey\n\nThis approach reflects our belief in the collaborative spirit of open source\nand our commitment to driving positive change in the Go ecosystem. We\u2019re\nexcited to engage with the community, share our insights, and contribute to\nthe ongoing maintenance of Go as a language and platform.\n\nHappy coding!\n\n### George Adams Senior SWE Manager, Go Engineering Group\n\nFollow\n\nPosted in Community Microsoft for Go Developers\n\n### Read next\n\nGo 1.21.7-1 and 1.20.14-1 Microsoft builds now available\n\nThe Microsoft builds of the Go patches released today, Feb 6, are now\navailable for download.
