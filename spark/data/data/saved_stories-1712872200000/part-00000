This powerful integration abstracts away\nthousand-line SQL queries, enabling companies to quickly derive insights to\nenhance customer journeys.\n\nSince the dawn of SQL in the 1970s, analysts and engineers have struggled to\ndistill their bold analytical ambitions into the SELECT and HAVING clauses\nthat can unlock insight from raw data.\n\nBut there was usually something lost in translation between the idea in the\nhead and the SQL query in the terminal. The best analytics & data science\nteams have found ways to get it done with thousand line SQL queries that find\nsignal in the noise, followed by the python scripts to get those insights into\nthe business systems \u2013 the CRM, the support tool, the email platform \u2013 to\nenhance the customer journey.\n\nWith the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), data platforms, and\nReverse ETL, what would have taken teams of PhDs and data engineers months to\naccomplish is now within reach for all businesses.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll show you how you can use Reverse ETL with Snowflake Cortex\nto derive new insights from your data \u2013 like sentiment analysis, advanced\nsummarization, classification \u2013 and activate it everywhere you need, with just\na few lines of SQL.\n\n### Generating Intelligent Insights with AI Traits\n\nNew LLM models open new insights for your data. But being able to apply these\nmodels to your data has been complex \u2013 requiring additional ETL jobs or,\nworse, copying & pasting into a chatGPT window. \ud83d\ude31\n\nSnowflake Cortex, currently in Public Preview, enables organizations to\nanalyze data directly on top of data that already resides within their data\nplatform. The capabilities are really powerful: with a single SQL function,\nyou can summarize unstructured data, score sentiment for a review, or ask\nquestions directly of your data.\n\nBut generating insights is not enough to drive business impact. For analytics\n& data science teams to truly drive business outcomes, they need to equip\nteams across their org with these insights. That\u2019s where Reverse ETL can help,\nenabling teams to sync these generative insights into hundreds of applications\nto influence, augment, and accelerate the customer journey.\n\n### Reverse ETL with AI in Action\n\nLet\u2019s see how easy it is to generate a new insight from our data & use it to\nsend a personalized message in a multi-channel marketing tool like Braze. For\nthis example, let\u2019s say we want to send a personalized email recommending the\nnext book in a series, based on the sentiment analysis of customer reviews.\nWe\u2019re using Braze, but you can pick from hundreds of tools to connect. You\u2019ll\nneed a Snowflake account with customer data if you want to follow along.\n\n#### 1\\. Selecting a Dataset\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get a feel for the dataset. We\u2019ll be querying a Reviews table,\nwhich comes with a user_id and unstructured review field. You can see a sample\nbelow.\n\n#### 2\\. Using AI Functions\n\nNext, we\u2019ll use two LLM Functions to extract insights from this messy data.\nThe first LLM Function is sentiment, which is an out-of-the-box sentiment\nanalysis model from Cortex. This will return a value from -1 to 1 based on the\nsentiment of the review.\n\nThe second LLM Function is more configurable & flexible: complete, which takes\na model, a prompt, and the text field to operate on. We\u2019ll use the following\nprompt: \u201cwould the user like the next book or game in the series?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full query:\n\nAnd we can see the result set here:\n\nYou can see examples where the recommendation is more nuanced than the\nsentiment, based on the context of the review! A review that says \u201cI am just\nso frustrated I don\u2019t know how the story ends!\u201d may be lower sentiment, but\nqualify for recommendation.\n\n#### 3\\. Sync Traits to Profile & Destinations with Reverse ETL\n\nNow, with a few clicks, we can set up a Reverse ETL job to sync these insights\ninto the Segment user profile and into our marketing automation tool, Braze.\n\nWe can see these traits on the user profile & synced downstream into Braze.\nNow our marketing team can build advanced audiences and send a personalized\nemail to reviewers, recommending the next product in the series or suggesting\na new series to jump into based on their feedback!\n\nYou can see the AI generated sentiment score reflected on both the Segment\nprofile (left) as well as the Braze profile (right). This score can now be\nused as a criteria to build cohorts to send personalized messages to depending\non their last review sentiment.\n\n### We\u2019re Excited to See What you Build\n\nCombining your data with the natural language understanding (NLU) from LLMs\nunlocks use cases for virtually any business. We demonstrated how this\ntechnology can be applied to sentiment analysis for reviews, but the same\nsteps can be applied to unlock a better understanding of your customers\nthrough analyzing support ticket data, call transcripts, profile data, or\nother datasets.\n\nOur goal at Segment is to provide world class data infrastructure for advanced\ndata & marketing teams. We\u2019re excited about the potential for AI Traits &\nReverse ETL to unleash new insights across your organization and easily\nactivate that data across your business applications.\n\nReverse ETL with Snowflake Cortex is currently in Open Preview.
