It\u2019s\nridiculous, but possibly not that ridiculous?\n\nBy Kaitlyn Tiffany\n\nMichael Houtz\n\nAugust 31, 2021\n\nIf you search the phrase i hate texting on Twitter and scroll down, you will\nstart to notice a pattern. An account with the handle @pixyIuvr and a glowing\nheart as a profile picture tweets, \u201ci hate texting i just want to hold ur\nhand,\u201d receiving 16,000 likes. An account with the handle @f41rygf and a pink\norb as a profile picture tweets, \u201ci hate texting just come live with me,\u201d\nreceiving nearly 33,000 likes. An account with the handle @itspureluv and a\npink orb as a profile picture tweets, \u201ci hate texting i just wanna kiss u,\u201d\nreceiving more than 48,000 likes.\n\nThere are slight changes to the verb choice and girlish username and color\nscheme, but the idea is the same each time: I\u2019m a person with a crush in the\nage of smartphones, and isn\u2019t that relatable? Yes, it sure is! But some people\non Twitter have wondered whether these are really, truly, just people with\ncrushes in the age of smartphones saying something relatable. They\u2019ve pointed\nat them as possible evidence validating a wild idea called \u201cdead-internet\ntheory.\u201d\n\nLet me explain. Dead-internet theory suggests that the internet has been\nalmost entirely taken over by artificial intelligence. Like lots of other\nonline conspiracy theories, the audience for this one is growing because of\ndiscussion led by a mix of true believers, sarcastic trolls, and idly curious\nlovers of chitchat. One might, for example, point to @_capr1corn, a Twitter\naccount with what looks like a blue orb with a pink spot in the middle as a\nprofile picture. In the spring, the account tweeted \u201ci hate texting come over\nand cuddle me,\u201d and then \u201ci hate texting i just wanna hug you,\u201d and then \u201ci\nhate texting just come live with me,\u201d and then \u201ci hate texting i just wanna\nkiss u,\u201d which got 1,300 likes but didn\u2019t perform as well as it did for\n@itspureluv. But unlike lots of other online conspiracy theories, this one has\na morsel of truth to it. Person or bot: Does it really matter?\n\nRead: The internet is mostly bots\n\nDead-internet theory. It\u2019s terrifying, but I love it. I read about it on Agora\nRoad\u2019s Macintosh Cafe, an online forum with a pixelated-Margaritaville vibe\nand the self-awarded honor \u201cBest Kept Secret of the Internet!\u201d Right now, the\nbackground is a repeated image of palm trees, a hot-pink sunset, and some kind\nof liquor pouring into a rocks glass. The site is largely for discussing lo-fi\nhip-hop, which I don\u2019t listen to, but it is also for discussing conspiracy\ntheories, which I do.\n\nIn January, I stumbled across a new thread there titled \u201cDead Internet Theory:\nMost of the Internet is Fake,\u201d shared by a user named IlluminatiPirate. Over\nthe next few months, this would become the ur-text for those interested in the\ntheory. The post is very long, and some of it is too confusing to bother with;\nthe author claims to have pieced together the theory from ideas shared by\nanonymous users of 4chan\u2019s paranormal section and another forum called\nWizardchan, an online community premised on earning wisdom and magic through\ncelibacy. (In an email, IlluminatiPirate, who is an operations supervisor for\na logistics company in California, told me that he \u201ctruly believes\u201d in the\ntheory. I agreed not to identify him by name because he said he fears\nharassment.)\n\nPeppered with casually offensive language, the post suggests that the internet\ndied in 2016 or early 2017, and that now it is \u201cempty and devoid of people,\u201d\nas well as \u201centirely sterile.\u201d Much of the \u201csupposedly human-produced content\u201d\nyou see online was actually created using AI, IlluminatiPirate claims, and was\npropagated by bots, possibly aided by a group of \u201cinfluencers\u201d on the payroll\nof various corporations that are in cahoots with the government. The\nconspiring group\u2019s intention is, of course, to control our thoughts and get us\nto purchase stuff.\n\nAs evidence, IlluminatiPirate offers, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the same threads, the same\npics, and the same replies reposted over and over across the years.\u201d He argues\nthat all modern entertainment is generated and recommended by an algorithm;\ngestures at the existence of deepfakes, which suggest that anything at all may\nbe an illusion; and links to a New York story from 2018 titled \u201cHow Much of\nthe Internet Is Fake? Turns Out, a Lot of It, Actually.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s\nentirely obvious what I\u2019m subtly suggesting here given this setup,\u201d the post\ncontinues. \u201cThe U.S. government is engaging in an artificial intelligence\npowered gaslighting of the entire world population.\u201d So far, the original post\nhas been viewed more than 73,000 times.\n\nRead: Artificial intelligence is misreading human emotion\n\nObviously, the internet is not a government psyop, even though the Department\nof Defense had a role in its invention. But if it were, the most compelling\nevidence to me is the dead-internet theory\u2019s observation that the same news\nitems about unusual moon-related events seem to repeat year after year. I\nswear I\u2019ve been saying this for years. What is a super flower blood moon? What\nis a pink supermoon? A quick search of headlines from just this month brings\nup: \u201cThere\u2019s Something Special About This Weekend\u2019s Moon,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Miss: Rare,\nSeasonal \u2018Blue Moon\u2019 Rises Tonight,\u201d and \u201cWhy This Weekend\u2019s Blue Moon Is\nExtra Rare.\u201d I just don\u2019t understand why everyone is so invested in making me\nlook at the moon all the time? Leave me alone about the moon!\n\nDead-internet theory is a niche idea because it\u2019s patently ridiculous, but it\nhas been spreading. Caroline Busta, the Berlin-based founder of the media\nplatform New Models, recently referenced it in her contribution to an online\ngroup show organized by the KW Institute for Contemporary Art. \u201cOf course a\nlot of that post is paranoid fantasy,\u201d she told me. But the \u201coverarching idea\u201d\nseems right to her. The theory has become fodder for dramatic YouTube\nexplainers, including one that summarizes the original post in Spanish and has\nbeen viewed nearly 260,000 times. Speculation about the theory\u2019s validity has\nstarted appearing in the widely read Hacker News forum and among fans of the\nmassively popular YouTube channel Linus Tech Tips. In a Reddit forum about the\nparanormal, the theory is discussed as a possible explanation for why threads\nabout UFOs seem to be \u201chijacked\u201d by bots so often.\n\nThe theory\u2019s spread hasn\u2019t been entirely organic. IlluminatiPirate has posted\na link to his manifesto in several Reddit forums that discuss conspiracy\ntheories, including the Joe Rogan subreddit, which has 709,000 subscribers. In\nthe r/JoeRogan comments, users argue sarcastically\u2014or sincerely?\u2014about who\namong them is a bot. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely the type of loser who would get swindled\ninto living among bots and never realize it,\u201d a member of the 4chan-adjacent\nSomething Awful forum commented when the theory was shared there in February.\n\u201cSeems like something a bot would post,\u201d someone replied. Even the playful\narguments about how everything is the same are the same.\n\nRead: Why is Joe Rogan so popular?\n\nThat particular conversation continued down the bleakest path imaginable, to\nthe point of this comment: \u201cIf I was real I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be out there\nliving each day to the fullest and experiencing everything I possibly could\nwith every given moment of the relatively infinitesimal amount of time I\u2019ll\nexist for instead of posting on the internet about nonsense.\u201d\n\nAnyway ... dead-internet theory is pretty far out-there. But unlike the\ninternet\u2019s many other conspiracy theorists, who are boring or really gullible\nor motivated by odd politics, the dead-internet people kind of have a point.\nIn the New York story that IlluminatiPirate invokes, the writer Max Read plays\nwith paranoia. \u201cEverything that once seemed definitively and unquestionably\nreal now seems slightly fake,\u201d he writes. But he makes a solid argument: He\nnotes that a majority of web traffic probably comes from bots, and that\nYouTube, for a time, had such high bot traffic that some employees feared \u201cthe\nInversion\u201d\u2014the point when its systems would start to see bots as authentic and\nhumans as inauthentic. He also points out that even engagement metrics on\nsites as big and powerful as Facebook have been grossly inflated or easily\ngamed, and that human presence can be mimicked with click farms or cheap bots.\n\nSome of this may be improving now, for better or for worse. Social-media\ncompanies have gotten a lot better at preventing the purchase of fake views\nand fake likes, while some bot farmers have, in response, become all the more\nsophisticated. Major platforms still play whack-a-mole with inauthentic\nactivity, so the average internet user has no way of knowing how much of what\nthey see is \u201creal.\u201d\n\nBut more than that, the theory feels true: Most weeks, Twitter is taken over\nby an argument about how best to practice personal hygiene, or which cities\nhave the worst food and air quality, which somehow devolves into allegations\nof classism and accusations of murder, which for whatever reason is actually\nnot as offensive as classism anymore. A celebrity is sorry. A music video has\nbroken the internet. A meme has gotten popular and then boring. \u201cBennifer\nMight Be Back On, and No One\u2019s More Excited Than Twitter.\u201d At this point, you\ncould even say that the point of the theory is so obvious, it\u2019s clich\u00e9\u2014people\ntalk about longing for the days of weird web design and personal sites and\nlistservs all the time. Even Facebook employees say they miss the \u201cold\u201d\ninternet. The big platforms do encourage their users to make the same\nconversations and arcs of feeling and cycles of outrage happen over and over,\nso much so that people may find themselves acting like bots, responding on\nimpulse in predictable ways to things that were created, in all likelihood, to\nelicit that very response.\n\nThankfully, if all of this starts to bother you, you don\u2019t have to rely on a\nwacky conspiracy theory for mental comfort. You can just look for evidence of\nlife: The best proof I have that the internet isn\u2019t dead is that I wandered\nonto some weird website and found an absurd rant about how the internet is so,\nso dead.\n\nKaitlyn Tiffany is a staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of Everything\nI Need I Get From You: How Fangirls Created the Internet as We Know It.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
