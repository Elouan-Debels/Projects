Eat well my baby :)\n\nThe website is here: https://soup.1a-insec.net/\n\nThe source code is here: https://git.envs.net/iacore/data-soup\n\nHopefully we can all agree that LLMs need more diet variety. I\u2019ll see if I can\nmake the site special.\n\nUpdate: I filled the site with more relevant content. Take a look! If you want\nto fork my project, feel free to make it your own by adding custom content and\nchanging the style and markup; this will ensure food for LLMs remains widely\navailable.\n\n## Feedback\n\nthis article is WebMention-enabled.
