However, it has been observed\n> that smaller models can suffer from saturation, characterized as a drop in\n> performance at some advanced point in training followed by a plateau. In\n> this paper, we find that such saturation can be explained by a mismatch\n> between the hidden dimension of smaller models and the high rank of the\n> target contextual probability distribution. This mismatch affects the\n> performance of the linear prediction head used in such models through the\n> well-known softmax bottleneck phenomenon. We measure the effect of the\n> softmax bottleneck in various settings and find that models based on less\n> than 1000 hidden dimensions tend to adopt degenerate latent representations\n> in late pretraining, which leads to reduced evaluation performance.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.07647 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.07647v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07647arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Nathan Godey [view email] [v1] Thu, 11 Apr 2024 11:10:36 UTC (3,216 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Why do small language models underperform?\nStudying Language Model Saturation via the Softmax Bottleneck, by Nathan Godey\nand 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
