The plant in Gujarat, which will\ncost $11bn, is to employ 20,000 people and produce 50,000 silicon wafers a\nmonth. At the $3bn facility in Assam, 27,000 workers will package chips into\nprocessing units.\n\nThe two projects are masterminded by Tata Group, India\u2019s biggest conglomerate.\nIn Gujarat it has teamed up with Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing\nCorporation of Taiwan. In Assam Tata is going it alone. It is all a giant bet\nthat the Indian government\u2019s dream of turning the country into a high-tech\nmanufacturing powerhouse will materialise.
