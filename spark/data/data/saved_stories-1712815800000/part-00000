This survey provides the\n> first systematic view of LLM-based agents planning, covering recent works\n> aiming to improve planning ability. We provide a taxonomy of existing works\n> on LLM-Agent planning, which can be categorized into Task Decomposition,\n> Plan Selection, External Module, Reflection and Memory. Comprehensive\n> analyses are conducted for each direction, and further challenges for the\n> field of research are discussed.\n\nComments:| 9 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2402.02716 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2402.02716v1 [cs.AI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.02716arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Xu Huang [view email] [v1] Mon, 5 Feb 2024 04:25:24 UTC (324 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Understanding the planning of LLM agents: A\nsurvey, by Xu Huang and Weiwen Liu and Xiaolong Chen and Xingmei Wang and Hao\nWang and Defu Lian and Yasheng Wang and Ruiming Tang and Enhong Chen\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2402\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
