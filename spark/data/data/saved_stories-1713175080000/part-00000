According to\nits developer, the browser extension has been removed from GitLab after being\nhit with a DMCA takedown notice. Many users of BPC are venting their\nfrustrations right now, mostly in respect of the takedown itself. In reality,\nthe things that led up to the takedown notice are more worthy targets.\n\nIf the vision for the creation of the web included a day one feature that\ncould restrict access to content, people working on their own specialist\ntopics, catering to their own niche audiences, would\u2019ve happily pressed the\nbutton.\n\nA hundred or a thousand thriving communities, small utopias in their own\nright, with no connection to each other, would\u2019ve been seen as a feature, not\nthe failure of the internet we otherwise see today. The openness of the early\ndays of today\u2019s web, the ability to see most other sites and communities while\nbeing exposed to creativity and information like never before, was the easiest\nelevator pitch in history.\n\nCome and see, everything you want for free, was the dream made reality and\npeople couldn\u2019t wait to experience it. Some things for free, but you have to\npay for everything else, would\u2019ve changed everything.\n\nRegardless, that\u2019s what we have as our internet today, although the definition\nof \u2018free\u2019 has been adjusted over time, mostly to mean no money changes hands.\nJust watch a few ads, allow the content providers to share your data with the\nworld, and enjoy a lifetime of \u2018free\u2019 content.\n\nUnfortunately, a \u2018lifetime deal\u2019 on the internet is subject to change too and\nwhen ads and other mechanisms stop paying the bills, the doors get locked\nuntil payment is made for the key.\n\n## Paywalls and News\n\nIf the whole piracy debate is put to one side just for a moment, paying for\nmusic, movies, and books, doesn\u2019t sound especially ridiculous. Yet when it\ncomes to paying to read news, a majority suddenly get a little offended,\nannoyed even. They read a handful of articles a day, and they\u2019re not paying\nfor that, period. Certainly, they\u2019re not paying a full subscription to several\nonline newspapers on the basis they might have something worth reading this\nmonth.\n\nAnd to be frank, who can blame people for that sentiment? The days of someone\nsitting back in an armchair with a single newspaper, from which they consume\nall news, are largely gone. And good riddance too. Consuming news from\nmultiple sources is the only way to filter out the political biases, balance\nopinions, and get closer to the truth. Yet increasingly, large swathes of\ninformation, crucial to broader insight and analysis, can only be found behind\npaywalls.\n\nThe conundrum is currently unsolvable; a news business requires revenue, just\nlike any other. Ads don\u2019t work and while paywalls are broadly disliked, they\npay the bills. People want access to news, information about their world,\ncurrent events that affect their lives. The only issue is that when asked to\npay for it, people mostly don\u2019t want to. If the streaming service market is\nfragmented, news takes it to a whole new level.\n\n## Bypass Paywalls Clean\n\nBypass Paywalls Clean (BPC) is a browser extension that bypasses many of the\npaywalls put in place by most of the world\u2019s news publishers. While that\u2019s an\naccurate description, it\u2019s really an indication of a wider problem.\n\nBPC restores the news landscape to one that people can enjoy again, in keeping\nwith news delivery of the last couple of decades. It removes the irritations\nof news articles appearing in search engines with excerpts promising\neverything, only to transform into a \u2018subscribe now\u2019 bait-and-switch popup, of\nwhich there was no mention earlier.\n\nBPC removes the need for credit card hunts, not to mention the pain of any\nsubsequent data breaches. BPC removes the need for usernames, passwords,\nlogins authorized by 2FA, and eliminates the barrage of follow-up spam news\npublications suddenly feel permitted to send; pressure to sign up for longer,\nand for more money, not to mention the price increases of this year and the\nyear after, plus \u2018special offers\u2019 that nobody wants.\n\nFor these and other closely related reasons, users of BPC are very upset right\nnow. In a post to X yesterday, the software\u2019s developer revealed why his\nproject is no longer available; someone filed a DMCA takedown notice against\nhis repo on GitLab.\n\nBPC has not published a copy of the DMCA takedown notice, GitLab doesn\u2019t\nappear to have shared it either. In fact, the URL where the repo could be\npreviously found returns only a 404 error; there\u2019s no indication that a DMCA\ncomplaint was even received, let alone who sent it and what it said.\n\n## DMCA Abuse or Something Else?\n\nThe absence of information has led to some speculation that the notice may\nhave been abusive. Only the developer can say for sure but on the assumption\nthat a DMCA notice was indeed responsible for taking BPC down, some point to\nthe BPC code while shouting \u2018foul\u2019. They claim that since the BPC code is the\nunique creation of its developer, a DMCA notice would need to wrongfully claim\ncopyright of his code.\n\nWhile that could be a worthy topic of discussion, these scenarios can be\nimmediately addressed using a DMCA counter-notice. BPC\u2019s creator can simply\nfile one with GitLab and in less than two weeks\u2019 time, the platform would have\nto restore it, if whoever sent the original notice didn\u2019t sue the developer in\nthe United States.\n\nDiving into a potential legal quagmire is rarely attractive or sensible. Here,\nhowever, there are signs to suggest the option has been rendered unavailable.\nThe repo no longer exists according to GitLab, but that seems like a minor\ndetail when compared to the status of the developer\u2019s account.\n\nThere\u2019s no information close to hand on GitLab that attempts to explain why\nmagnolia1234 is \u2018blocked\u2019 and no reason supplied on the developer\u2019s account on\nX either. Responses from BPC users are limited to those who @Magnolia1234B\nspecifically mentions, so discussion is somewhat limited.\n\n## More than One Type of DMCA Notice\n\nThe developer\u2019s earlier comment, \u201canother day another DMCA takedown notice\u201d\ntends to suggest receipt of two, three or potentially more DMCA notices. On\nwhich platforms they were received isn\u2019t specified but if those all relate to\nGitLab, it raises the question of whether a \u2018repeat infringer\u2019 policy came\ninto play. That could explain the \u2018blocked\u2019 account status but since details\naren\u2019t being made available, it\u2019s difficult to say for sure.\n\nHowever, DMCA takedown notices come in more than one flavor and the \u2018remove\nthis copy of my content\u2019 type may not even be the best fit here. It\u2019s\ncertainly possible that if a DMCA notice is responsible, it could be an anti-\ncircumvention notice for which there is no counter-notice option available.\n\nWhether BPC amounts to a tool that circumvents a \u201ctechnological measure that\neffectively controls access to a work protected by copyright\u201d rendering it\nillegal under 17 U.S. Code \u00a7 1201, cannot be answered without a proper\ntechnical analysis.\n\nWebsites use all kinds of methods to restrict access to content but whether\nsome, any or all qualify for protection is mostly uncharted territory. There\u2019s\nalso the question of intent, i.e what BPC was designed and marketed for; that\nhas the potential to matter a lot.\n\n## Blame the Game, Not the Player\n\nIn the physical world, a locked door is a pretty clear sign that whatever lies\nbehind it is currently unavailable for access. Some people might give the\nhandle a couple of tries to be sure but, in ordinary circumstances, people\ndon\u2019t immediately start searching for security weaknesses or pull out a\nlockpicking set.\n\nIn the online environment, where there\u2019s an underlying assumption most things\nare free, a paywall popup with an article just visible underneath, is a signal\nthat whoever published the article cannot afford to deliver it in any other\nway. Yet in many cases it has already been delivered, because the text is\nalready right there.\n\nIs it legally acceptable to remove the blocking element in your own browser or\nis this really about respecting the people who spent time and money creating\nthe content, regardless of how good their security is?\n\nOr could this be more about the online news situation in general, where anyone\ncan setup a website that automatically copies everything a news site publishes\nin public, the moment it\u2019s published, and then pumps it out as their own\ncontent to generate revenue?\n\nMaybe the terrible ad networks that many illegal and indeed legal news\nplatforms foist upon their readers are the real problem? Or perhaps the\nresponse to this barrage of unwanted ads causes most damage; exhausted readers\nsimply rejecting ads altogether, blocking the good and bad in one swoop?\n\nWith no ad revenue, news sites can either shut down completely or turn to a\npaywall. So rather than viewing BPC as a parasite that stops creators getting\npaid for their work, perhaps a broader look at the news ecosystem itself is in\norder.\n\n## Who\u2019s Really Taking Available Revenue?\n\nConsidering the volume of news available at any one moment, much of it simply\nrehashed or otherwise trash copies of reports produced by a limited number of\noriginal publishers, the real parasites driving paywall uptake aren\u2019t found in\nthe form of a browser extension.\n\nThey\u2019re the publications that pass news off as their own, sometimes completely\nrewritten by AI, who then spend ten times more money on SEO, because getting\nlow quality junk to the top of search results is clearly more important than\njournalism. They take news articles already being offered for free yet their\nonly contribution is to make whatever they take worse. The world is awash with\nthem yet search engines seem incapable of doing anything about most.\n\nRemoving these sites from the market would return more of the revenue to those\nthat should\u2019ve received it in the first place, hopefully negating the need for\nmore paywalls and any future for tools like BPC.\n\nIf news consumers want fewer paywalls, boycott the parasites, plagiarists, and\nthose bombarding your browser and inboxes with spam. Adding them to a hosts\nfile or making a firewall rule is fairly painless but a convenient, open\nsource browser extension might be a fitting solution under the circumstances.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * anti-circumvention\n  * bypass paywalls clean\n  * DMCA\n  * gitlab\n  * paywall\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nLawsuits\n\n### YouTuber Liable For Bogus DMCA Notice \u201cAwareness Campaign\u201d Targeting\nBungie\n\n  * March 15, 2024, 11:56 by Andy Maxwell\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### Nintendo Hits Circumvention Tool Linkers With DMCA Trafficking Violations\n\n  * March 14, 2024, 11:00 by Andy Maxwell\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### DMCA Notices Took Down 20,517 GitHub Projects Last Year\n\n  * March 8, 2024, 22:24 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nKodi Addon & Build Repositories Shut Down Citing Legal Pressure (Updated)\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMajor Record Labels Sue Youtube-dl\u2019s Hosting Provider\n\nKodi Addon & Build Repositories Shut Down Citing Legal Pressure (Updated)\n\nMorgan Freeman: Movie Pirates Have Tiny, Useless Penises\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14948\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": true}
