The U.S. Navy is fighting a critical battle against a\nJapanese invasion fleet bound for Port Moresby, a steppingstone to the\nAustralian mainland. The Battle of the Coral Sea would be the first time two\nnaval forces engaged in combat outside of visual range. Although Japan would\nbe forced to abandon its invasion, it won a tactical victory against the\nAllies. The fleet carrier USS Lexington was 25% of the Navy's carrier strength\nin the Pacific Theater at the time, and it had been rendered completely\ninoperable.\n\nAs the skipper of the Lexington realized his situation, he gave the order to\nabandon ship. Some 2,735 of its sailors were evacuated, but a handful of them\nwere late making their way to the lifeboats. They were busy raiding the\ncarrier's ice cream fridge, making sure to take every last delicious bite.\nSuch was the power ice cream had over American sailors.\n\nIf an army marches on its stomach, as Napoleon Bonaparte once purportedly\nsaid, then a fighting force as large and powerful as the one the United States\nfielded in World War II is also going to need dessert. That was the thinking\nbehind a surprising number of decisions made at the highest levels of American\nmilitary power during the war, anyway. The U.S. War Department, the Navy and\nthe American dairy industry all teamed up to make sure the country's fighting\nmen and women had ready access to the frozen sweet treat at all times.\n\nThis is not to say ice cream was the single-most decisive factor for an Allied\nvictory in the Pacific Theater of World War II, but there's a reason the U.S.\nbuilt a flotilla of ice cream delivery ships and a floating ice cream barge.\n\nTechnically, it was called a BRL: \"Barge, Refrigerated, Large.\" Each was\ncapable of making 500 gallons of ice cream and storing 1,500 more.\n\nA few things happened before World War II that not only made ice cream more\naccessible, but also more in-demand among Americans than ever before. The\nfirst was a series of technological advancements that made ice cream both\neasier to make and easier to store. Freezers were suddenly capable of making\ncontinuous streams of ice cream in just about five minutes, according to\nauthor Anne Cooper Funderburg's fantastic history of the treat, \"Chocolate,\nStrawberry, and Vanilla: A History of American Ice Cream.\".\n\n\"At the beginning of World War II, the American ice cream factory was far\nremoved from the labor-intensive, salt-and-ice operations of the 19th\ncentury,\" Funderburg wrote. \"The consumer could buy ice cream at more outlets\nand in a greater variety of flavors and packages than ever before.\"\n\nThough Prohibition, which outlawed the manufacture and sale of alcohol in the\nUnited States, ended before the start of World War II, American industry\nneeded to make products to fill the gaps booze left behind. More than one beer\nbrewery converted its machinery to make ice cream, and soda fountains replaced\nsaloons as gathering spots. Between 1916 and 1925, ice cream consumption grew\nby 55% among hungry Americans.\n\nNeither the end of Prohibition nor the Great Depression could stop the\nAmerican ice-cream craze. So when the country entered World War II, it\nnaturally became what we call today a \"force multiplier.\"\n\nImagine a fighting force fueled by coffee, cigarettes and ice cream: It's the\nUnited States Navy. (U.S. Navy)\n\nA national tragedy such as the attack on Pearl Harbor and the country's\nsubsequent entry into the largest conflict of all time wasn't about to stop\nthe trend, either. Americans still loved ice cream, and enlisting in the\nmilitary did nothing to stop that. In fact, the popularity of ice cream\n(combined with a little lobbying from the U.S. dairy industry) made sure it\nwould be readily available to any U.S. service member who wanted it.\n\nAnd boy, did they want it. The U.S. Navy had (in)famously outlawed alcohol\naboard ships in 1914, six years before Prohibition, but it still needed to\nfill the gap in morale boosting power a sailors daily drink left behind. As\nany noncommissioned officer who has overseen junior enlisted Americans will\ntell you: if you don't give them something to boost their morale, they can get\ninto anything ... and you might not like what they find.\n\nLuckily, they found ice cream. Airmen in the Army Air Forces were using open\nseats on B-17 Flying Fortresses as ice-cream freezers during bombing missions\n(where temperatures could be as low as -25\u00b0F). Navy and Marine Corps aviators\nwould mix canned milk and cocoa powder in fuel drop tanks, then fly missions,\nreturning to their otherwise tropical or desert climates with tanks full of\nsweet treats.\n\nAfter an assistant to then-Under Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal wrote\nthat \"ice cream, in my opinion, has been the most neglected of all the\nimportant morale factors,\" the secretary made getting ice cream to those\ntroops his highest priority. Thereafter, any ship large enough would be fitted\nwith a so-called \"gedunk bar\" (gedunk being the World War II sailor's word for\nice cream, but now just means any junk food). The ice cream had the triple\nbenefit of providing calories, helping beat the heat and boosting morale.\n\nFour out of five World War II sailors agree. (U.S. Navy)\n\nHere's where a little interservice rivalry (whether real or imagined) came\ninto play for the benefit of everyone. The Army also realized the benefits of\nproviding ice cream to its soldiers. It not only created a dehydrated ice\ncream mix that could be flavored with any fruit or candy on hand (some 135\nmillion pounds of the stuff by 1943). The Quartermaster Corps also provided\nthe machines and ingredients to make another 80 million gallons of fresh-made\nice cream to soldiers and airmen around the world.\n\nFunderburg writes that by February 1945, at the same time the Allies were\npreparing to invade Germany in earnest, the Army began building ice-cream\nfactories to bring half-pint cartons \"right into the foxholes.\"\n\nNot to be outdone, the Navy borrowed a concrete barge from the Army and then\nspent a million dollars (around $17.2 million in today's dollars) turning it\ninto a floating ice-cream factory, parlor and storage facility. It could turn\nout 10 gallons every seven minutes and hand off gallons to smaller concrete\nbarges, pulled by tugs, which would distribute ice cream to anywhere and\neverywhere it was needed in the Pacific.\n\nNot everyone was thrilled with ice cream's rampant popularity. At the end of\nthe war, then-Col. Lewis \"Chesty\" Puller allegedly decried ice cream as \"sissy\nfood\" and lobbied for beer and whiskey instead. The newly formed Department of\nDefense opted to stick with ice cream instead.\n\n## Want to Learn More About Military Life?\n\nWhether you're thinking of joining the military, looking for post-military\ncareers or keeping up with military life and benefits, Military.com has you\ncovered.
