Their peer-reviewed\npaper was published on March 13 in the Chinese academic journal Propulsion\nTechnology.\n\nHeadquartered in the United States, Nvidia is the world\u2019s largest supplier of\nAI chips. Nvidia began selling the TX2i for industrial applications about six\nyears ago. The module\u2019s peak single-precision performance is 1.26 TFlops,\nabout one-fiftieth of the capability of the company\u2019s most powerful AI chip,\nthe H100.\n\nThe H100, however, costs tens of thousands of US dollars and is in short\nsupply. The TX2i, on the other hand, can be obtained for a few hundred\ndollars, is not subject to US export controls and is widely available online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen contacted by the South China Morning Post on April 12, Nvidia said it had\nno comment on the matter.\n\nThe project team, led by Professor Sun Ximing, said in their paper that the\nTX2i module in the scramjet engine control system not only boosted the range\nand stability of hypersonic vehicles, but also significantly reduced their\nresearch and development costs.\n\nDaily, Monday to Friday\n\nChina at a Glance Newsletter\n\nYour daily must-read of essential stories from China, including politics,\neconomy and current affairs.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

Previous studies used\nIntel CPUs and Nvidia\u2019s high-end graphics cards to simulate complex high-speed\nflow fields.\n\n\u201cHigh-performance graphics cards possess excellent computational capabilities\nbut require supporting equipment such as a hosting platform, power supply and\nradiator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have disadvantages such as high power consumption, heavy weight and\nlarge size, which do not meet the demands of lightweight and small-sized\nembedded controllers in the aerospace field,\u201d Sun\u2019s team wrote in their paper.\n\nBecause of the sequential nature of hypersonic flow field simulations, where\none event must occur before another can be calculated, industry experts\ngenerally believe that such computational tasks cannot be accomplished using\nlower-end AI chips adept at performing simple parallel computations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo solve this problem, Sun\u2019s team introduced a novel CPU plus GPU\narchitecture, which detailed how to tackle sequential parallel computing\nproblems by ensuring the two different chip types worked well together.\n\nThe \u201cstep-by-step\u201d guide provided in the paper provides detailed formulas and\naddresses potential engineering challenges, including limiting simulation grid\nsize, memory management, code optimisation, and specific compilation\ninstruction schemes.\n\n02:44\n\nIran\u2019s new missile can reportedly reach Israel and US military bases in Middle\nEast\n\nIran\u2019s new missile can reportedly reach Israel and US military bases in Middle\nEast\n\nFor better universality, the engine controller\u2019s interface and communication\nprotocol adhere to international standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the engine is only one component of the entire weapon platform.\n\n\u201cTo apply [the AI chip] to hypersonic vehicles, further work is needed in\ninlet modelling, shock wave correction, and data modelling,\u201d the team said in\nthe paper.\n\nSome important parameters involved in these tasks usually need to be obtained\nin extensive wind tunnel testing and actual flights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the likelihood of the TX2i being used for Chinese hypersonic missiles\nis low. China\u2019s domestic chip manufacturers can provide chips to the country\u2019s\nmilitary that perform as well as, or better, than the TX2i, with minimal\nconcerns over supply chain reliability and safety.\n\nIt remains unclear why the researchers selected the Nvidia chip for their\nexperiment, and the authors could not be reached for comment.\n\nIt is possible that the intention was to prove the feasibility of using an\ninexpensive AI chip for hypersonic weapons, regardless where it is made.\nHowever, such weapons can operate with different types of chips.\n\nWhile few countries are able to design and manufacture such chips, a growing\nnumber of nations, including Germany, France, Japan, North Korea and Iran,\nhave launched hypersonic weapon research and development programmes.\n\nEven the Houthis, an Iranian-backed rebel group that controls most of Yemen,\nhave claimed they have been testing hypersonic missiles capable of reaching\nMach 8.\n\nThe proliferation of hypersonic weapon technology has been a major concern for\nthe United States. In 2017, the Rand Corporation suggested that Washington\nwork with Moscow and Beijing to prevent other countries from acquiring such\ntechnology.\n\nBut while Chinese and Russian military experts admit hypersonic weapons\ntechnology poses certain risks, they said it is more likely to accelerate the\ncollapse of the US-centered world order.\n\nThey have reasoned that hypersonic missiles could penetrate the defences of\nAmerica\u2019s massive aircraft carrier fleet, which it has long relied on for\nglobal military superiority.\n\nIn a war game exercise conducted last year by Chinese scientists, a Ford-class\naircraft carrier battle group was destroyed by about 20 hypersonic anti-ship\nmissiles. If more countries possessed hypersonic weapons, the advantage\nenjoyed by the few countries with significant naval power over the past five\ncenturies may come to an end, according to some experts.\n\nOn April 3, North Korea successfully test-fired a hypersonic gliding missile,\nand on Monday, Iran claimed to have used hypersonic missiles to attack Israeli\nmilitary bases in retaliation for Israel\u2019s bombing of the Iranian embassy.\nCurrently, there is no evidence to suggest that China or Russia provided\nweapons or technical support to either country.\n\nThe Beijing Power Machinery Research Institute is affiliated with China\nAerospace Science and Industry Corporation, a major supplier of China\u2019s\nhypersonic weapons. Dalian University of Technology, closely associated with\nChina\u2019s navy, is a major research and development base for advanced\nmanufacturing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen\n\n32\n\n1\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use cookies to tailor your experience and present relevant ads.
