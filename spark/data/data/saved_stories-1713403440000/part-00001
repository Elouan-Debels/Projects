It\u2019s\nimpossible to really know the counterfactual, but I suspect not.\n\nStripe wasn\u2019t easy to get off the ground. It required convincing banks to work\nwith us, and to take a bet on an unproven startup. I actually spoke to some\nbanks in Ireland when we were starting out, and it was pretty clear that\ngetting them to work with us would have been a very tough battle. I doubt we\u2019d\nhave been able to pull it off.\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure that asking whether Stripe could have been started in Ireland\nis the right question. Most technology start-ups don\u2019t have to convince banks\nto work with them. The interesting question is probably \u201chow hard is to start\na successful start-up in Ireland compared to doing so in Silicon Valley?\u201d (I\u2019m\nnot claiming that Stripe itself is yet successful\u2014it's still very early days.)\n\nThe answer is almost definitely \u201csubstantially harder\u201d. Among the reasons:\n\n  * While improving, the investment climate still isn't very strong. There are far more investors in the US, particularly once you look beyond the seed stage. More importantly, all investors aren\u2019t created equal, and the investors a start-up is likely to want are much more likely to be in the US. It still makes sense for most Irish start-ups to raise money outside Ireland, and over the last few years, it seems that the most notable technology start-ups with Irish founders have chosen this path.\n  * The talent pool here is much smaller than that of Silicon Valley. The single most important aspect of Silicon Valley is that it\u2019s where many great people choose to live. Stripe\u2019s employees come from Honduras, Kenya, India, Sweden, Canada, Austria, and more\u2014but they\u2019ve all chosen to live in Silicon Valley. Because Ireland has fewer of these immigrants, Irish start-ups are forced to either hire from a much more limited group, or to try to convince people to move here. (A third option is to have a geographically distributed team from the start; this route is also quite tough.)\n  * There aren\u2019t many acquisitions happening, reducing the expected outcome of a start-up. In Silicon Valley, a failed start-up with good founders will often be bought by one of the tech giants; In Ireland, that same start-up is likely to simply fail. This matters not only because founders are less likely to want to start companies, but also because it\u2019s harder to attract capital and to convince employees to join.\n\nDespite these issues, I\u2019m struck by how things seem to be improving every time\nI come back to Ireland. Dogpatch Labs recently opened in Dublin, and Eamon\nLeonard has been organizing a successful tech events series. Conferences like\nthe Web Summit, f.ounders, FunConf, and \u00dall have substantially increased\nDublin\u2019s profile. Thanks to firms like Atomico, Accel, Index, DST, and others,\nthe European investment scene generally looks much better than it did five\nyears ago. Early stage tech companies like Hubspot and Zendesk have opened\noffices in Dublin. In general, things appear to be moving in the right\ndirection. Given its size, Dublin compares surprisingly favorably to Berlin or\nLondon as a tech hub.\n\nIt also goes without saying that it\u2019d be a mistake to look at any of the\nproblems identified in this post as immutable, and it\u2019s worth keeping in mind\nthat they apply to most areas of the world that aren\u2019t Silicon Valley. The\nfirst two issues mentioned above have gotten better since we started a company\nin Ireland in 2007. But given how much effort is (rightly!) being put into\nmaking Ireland a better place to start a start-up, it\u2019s probably worth being\nclear about what should be improved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
