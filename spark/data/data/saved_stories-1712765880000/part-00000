(Photograph by Susana Giron)\n\n####\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to not be taken seriously.\n\nWhen I was a kid, one of my most agonizing frustrations was about how rare it\nwas that anybody would take me seriously. It doesn\u2019t bother me as much\nanymore, largely because I\u2019ve since achieved some level of success at the\nthings I care about. I now have some people who have my back \u2013 people who see\nme for who I am and what I\u2019m doing \u2013 and I\u2019ve also learned to be more patient\nwith other people\u2019s misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and so on. I\u2019m\nwriting this to share some of my thoughts about that.\n\nI think I got partially radicalized by the books I\u2019d read. Good books are\nwritten by serious authors, and being deeply immersed in their work stirred\nsomething in me that made me yearn to live a serious life myself. It just\nseemed so obvious to me that a serious life is a life well-lived, and it\u2019s\nalways been weird to me how uncommon this perspective really is. Sure, you can\ncatch snippets of it in all the motivational speeches and slogans that people\nthrow about:\n\n  * \u201cThe world has the habit of making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where he is going.\u201d \u2013 Napoleon Hill\n\n  * \u201cThe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\u201d \u2013 Eleanor Roosevelt\n\n...but mostly people seem to use it as window dressing, rather than, something\nto actually take seriously. This disparity is something that\u2019s haunted me all\nmy life, and I\u2019ve sought to understand it, and I think I have a pretty decent\n(albeit always imperfect) understanding of it.\n\nvisakanv's switchboard is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts\nand support my work, please consider becoming a free or paid subscriber!\n\n####\n\nWe do live in a world that\u2019s full of unserious people.\n\nAs I got older it became clearer to me that not many people are really serious\nabout anything. Some people go their whole lives without ever having met\nanyone else who I might describe as actually serious, so they find it hard to\nbelieve that anybody could really mean what they say, since everything\neveryone says is bullshit. I remember feeling like that myself at some of my\nlow points in life, when I was at my most depressed.\n\nLooking back now I don\u2019t think I was entirely wrong, the issue was that I was\noverly fixated on unpleasant truths. I find myself compelled to describe it as\n\u201cLinkedIn World\u201d, where everyone is performing a bullshit role in a bullshit\nplay. And my blessing was that I did still have a little light in the darkness\nfrom the authors I mentioned earlier, which felt like a glimmer of honest\nearnestness. And that glimmer has kept me going through everything.\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I fell madly in love with the local music scene. It\nseemed to me like a dank oasis of sincerity on a sterile, shrink-wrapped\nisland of lies. It was my church, and I was convinced that it could save the\nworld if only everyone would join in its sweaty embrace\n\n2:42 AM \u2219 Mar 21, 2018\n\n57Likes9Retweets\n\n(Even that isn\u2019t the whole picture, since there was definitely bullshit in\nthat scene too, as there is in all scenes \u2013 but there was also a truth to it.)\n\nAnyway so\u2013 it\u2019s actually quite rational for most people to assume that any\nother random person probably isn\u2019t serious. That they don\u2019t really mean what\nthey say. Lots of people play-act seriousness for social reasons, but quit\nwhen the going gets tough. So it makes sense that lots of people are broadly\ncynical. Cynicism is a completely reasonable defense against fraud and\nbullshit. The trouble with cynicism as a defense mechanism is that you can get\nso good at it that you inadvertently also defend yourself against anything\ngood happening for you. But back to seriousness...\n\n####\n\nSerious people do exist. Let me tell you about some of them.\n\nJusto Gallego Mart\u00ednez was serious. At about 36 years old, he got stricken\nwith tuberculosis, got better, promised God that he would build a cathedral,\nand spent the remaining 60 years of his life building it. \"When I started\nbuilding, word on the street was that I was crazy. They didn't believe I would\nbe so dedicated... I'm proving them wrong.\"\n\nDashrath \u201cMountain Man\u201d Manjhi was serious. In 1959, Dashrath Manjhi\u2019s wife\ndied from her injuries after a fall, being unable to get medical attention in\ntime. He spent the next 22 years using a hammer and chisel to carve a 360ft\npath through a mountain, reducing the distance between his village and the\nnearest doctor from 55-70km to 1km. \"When I started hammering the hill, people\ncalled me a lunatic but that steeled my resolve.\" You can see the impact of\nhis efforts on Google maps:\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\n@Zio_QQr\n\n2:59 PM \u2219 Oct 1, 2021\n\nHokusai was serious. Here\u2019s him talking about his paintings after ~70 years of\nworking on them: \u201cFrom the age of six, I had a passion for copying the form of\nthings and since the age of fifty I have published many drawings, yet of all I\ndrew by my seventieth year there is nothing worth taking into account. At\nseventy-three years I partly understood the structure of animals, birds,\ninsects and fishes, and the life of grasses and plants. And so, at eighty-six\nI shall progress further; at ninety I shall even further penetrate their\nsecret meaning, and by one hundred I shall perhaps truly have reached the\nlevel of the marvellous and divine. When I am one hundred and ten, each dot,\neach line will possess a life of its own.\u201d\n\nHere are two of his paintings, you might recognize one of them:\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\neverything I've done so far VS what I see in my mind\n\n5:42 PM \u2219 Nov 17, 2021\n\n64Likes5Retweets\n\nI could go on and on \u2013 Gertrude Stein was serious, Erasmus was serious,\nMandela was serious... I have a list of hundreds of people throughout history\nwho\u2019ve inspired me with their focus and their devotion \u2013 that\u2019s part of how I\nknow that I\u2019m serious about understanding who\u2019s serious, how to be serious,\netc. This is a talking point I keep returning to. You can actually do the\nreading. You can get surprisingly far with this.\n\n####\n\nYou can only really find out who\u2019s serious over time.\n\nThis is true internally too. Fraud and bullshit aren\u2019t the only problems with\nplay-acted seriousness \u2013 even when we\u2019re being maximally truthful, we often\ndon\u2019t know what seriousness in some context even is, until we\u2019ve experienced\nit ourselves.\n\nI would like to describe myself as serious, but... part of the whole point of\nthis essay is that talk is cheap. Anybody can say that they\u2019re serious. How\ncan I demonstrate that I\u2019m serious? Well, I could point to work that I\u2019ve\ndone. When I was 22, I decided that I wanted to become a good writer, and that\ndoing that would require doing a lot of writing. So I started a writing\nproject called 1000wordvomits, where I set out to write 1,000 stream-of-\nconsciousness essays of 1,000 words each. 10 years later, I\u2019ve written 821 out\nof 1,000 essays, and I intend to complete them. I\u2019ve similarly made 200+\nyoutube videos and I intend to make over 1,000 of those, too \u2013 at least one a\nmonth every year for the rest of my life, or as long as YouTube exists.\n\nI haven\u2019t lived long enough to really demonstrate just how serious I am, and I\nhesitate to say it because seriousness is something that really you can\u2019t tell\nfrom an utterance. You can mainly only tell from watching how someone conducts\nthemselves over an extended period of time. Over decades. Particularly, how\nthey deal with shocks, rough times, downcycles. Everyone is optimistic when\ntimes are good. The thing to look out for is who keeps going when the going\ngets tough.\n\nIn one of my previous essays about earnestness, I linked to a poem that I\nwrote when I was 20 that\u2019s basically about how serious I wanted to be. While\nit\u2019s janky and overwrought, 12 years later I still stand by every word that\nkid wrote, and I believe with full conviction that I will continue to be proud\nof that kid for as long as I live. Earnestness is daring to be serious about\nyour feelings.\n\n####\n\nWhen I say serious I don\u2019t mean solemn and tedious.\n\nI mean something closer to \u2018dynamic persistence\u2019, and a sense of humor is\noften critical to that. It\u2019s hard to persist for a long time if you \u2018take\nyourself too seriously\u2019. You become rigid, stiff, the opposite of dynamic, and\neventually you bang up against something that breaks you one way or another,\nbecause you weren\u2019t able to back down, or laugh it off.\n\nSo the point is to take the work seriously but you don\u2019t take yourself too\nseriously. There\u2019s a riff about this in Stephen Pressfield\u2019s War of Art, where\nhe talks about how amateurs are too precious with their work: \u201cThe\nprofessional has learned, however, that too much love can be a bad thing. Too\nmuch love can make him choke. The seeming detachment of the professional, the\ncold-blooded character to his demeanor, is a compensating device to keep him\nfrom loving the game so much that he freezes in action.\u201d\n\nThe word \u2018amateur\u2019 comes from amare, \u2018to love\u2019, and I will be the first to\nreadily admit that I can be very precious about my work! I\u2019m almost definitely\na more precious than what would be ideal. But the point is to not be so\nprecious that you choke. I\u2019m still publishing. That\u2019s the litmus test. Are you\npublishing, whatever publishing means to you? I want to see it!\n\nThis tension is also part of what I\u2019m getting at with the \u201cayy lmao\u201d meme \u2013\n\u201cexcruciatingly meaningful\u201d is when everything you do or don\u2019t-do is so\noverwhelmingly important that it paralyzes you \u2013 or worse, convinces you that\nit\u2019s okay to treat people poorly because your quest is of such cosmic\nsignificance.\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\nthis is the heart of philosophy, all else is commentary \ud83e\uddd0\n\n12:49 PM \u2219 Sep 29, 2021\n\n3,044Likes838Retweets\n\nSolemnity is pomposity, is arrogance, is rigidity. We can be serious and we\ncan have fun, joke around, be playful, silly. I even like to argue that\nsilliness is sacred, in part because it keeps thing dynamic and fresh. John\nCleese had a great bit on this too:\n\n##### John Cleese: \u201cNow I suggest to you that a group of us could be sitting\naround after dinner, discussing matters that were extremely serious like the\neducation of our children, or our marriages, or the meaning of life, and we\ncould be laughing, and that would not make what we were discussing one bit\nless serious. Solemnity, on the other hand, I honestly don\u2019t know what it\u2019s\nfor. I mean, what is the point of it? The two most beautiful memorial services\nthat I\u2019ve ever attended both had a lot of humor and it freed us all and made\nthe services inspiring and cathartic. But solemnity, it serves pomposity. And\nthe self-important always know, at some level of their consciousness, that\ntheir egotism is going to be punctured by humor. That\u2019s why they see it as a\nthreat.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a great anecdote from Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman,\nwhere he talks about how physics used to delight him when he used to play with\nit, but then it started to disgust him when he got burdened by this idea that\nhe was obligated to advance the future of science. That he was supposed to be\ndoing \u201cimportant\u201d work.\n\nIt\u2019s quite poetic how, he only broke through his malaise when he decided to\ngive up on the whole enterprise of \u201cdoing important work\u201d, and simply started\nfooling around for the sake of it \u2013 and even more poetically, it was his\nfooling around with wobbly plates that led to the equations that he won the\nNobel prize for!\n\nIt\u2019s worth reflecting on this one for a bit. For Feynman, taking physics\nseriously meant being playful and silly with it. As I revisit my own drafts\nand notes, I often find the same issue \u2013 I want to write essays that mean\nsomething to me, but when they become tedious, solemn obligations, then I\ndon\u2019t wanna. That\u2019s the tension to navigate. It\u2019s not complicated.\n\n####\n\nIf you\u2019re serious, you will optimize for survival, because you can\u2019t keep\nplaying if you\u2019re dead.\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\nthe big lesson of survivor bias is that you should optimize for being a\nsurvivor\n\n7:48 AM \u2219 Aug 16, 2020\n\n579Likes71Retweets\n\nOne of the stupidest things I\u2019ve repeatedly seen smart people do \u2013 I call this\nAdvanced Stupid \u2013 is that they get so fixated on trying to optimize something\ncomplicated, that they forget to optimize for survival, and then they get\nknocked out of the game. Like having a startup trying to do something\ncomplicatedly clever, and then running out of money. The thing here is to\nstudy the failure conditions \u2013 how and why have past players failed to do what\nyou\u2019re trying to do? \u2013 and be conscientious about avoiding that.\n\nYou do the reading. You look up your predecessors and study why they\nsucceeded, why they failed, what worked, what didn\u2019t. You recognize that\nwhatever understanding you have is provisional, piecemeal, wrong and not-even-\nwrong to degrees that you cannot understand. If you\u2019re serious, you\u2019ll work at\nmanaging your psychology such that you stay motivated to keep going, because\nif you run out of juice, you\u2019re out of the game. You recognize that your day-\nto-day motivations will likely change, and prepare for this. You\u2019ll\nperiodically review your behavior to see how things are working out for you.\nYou\u2019ll learn to think about constraints.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s not ridiculously complicated, either. I remember\nexperiencing waves of euphoria at some point when it became clear to me how\nsimple it all really is. But of course, simple doesn\u2019t mean easy. Bullshit is\neasier.\n\n####\n\nOn the problem of stolen valor polluting the commons\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\nif you say you're ambitious, but you don't have a body of work you can point\nat, you should STFU and build the body of work first. even if it's a bunch of\nnotes and drafts and crappy prototypes or whatever. code your apps, write your\nplays and poems. I will die on this hill.\n\n11:25 AM \u2219 Oct 21, 2021\n\n675Likes59Retweets\n\nFrom time to time I get very angry about the idea of stolen valor, by which I\nmean people claiming and pretending to be serious when they are not. I\nprobably still have some personal issues to work through here, but I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m crazy or wrong to be mad about this \u2013 people who are loudly,\npublicly unserious pollute the commons by making everyone else a little bit\nmore cynical in response. This makes it harder for any kid to be taken\nseriously, which in turn means that as a society we get less of the glorious\noutput of serious players. We crush the caterpillars and complain there are so\nfew butterflies.\n\nThere\u2019s some complication to get into about fraud, delusion and the problem of\nknowledge. Even if we could somehow successfully discourage all bad actors\nfrom their stupid bullshit, we do still have to deal with more foundational\nproblem of knowledge, which is that there are ways in which you cannot know if\nyou\u2019re actually serious until you\u2019re in the thick of it. There\u2019s a kind of\ncruel injustice here about the nature of life itself, of being a mortal, a\nfinite being with limited knowledge.\n\nWhen I talked about this with my ex-boss Dinesh, he said, \u201cYou never really\nknow what being serious means in your context till you try to be serious. So\npeople might in good nature start out wanting to be serious. But you might not\nprepared for the fact that your notion of serious is going to possibly change\nquite radically and disillusion you.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m in two minds about this. On one hand, some amount of it is inescapable,\nand it is very, very important to anticipate dealing with the inescapable.\nLife has a surprising amount of detail. But on the other hand, so much of it\nIS avoidable, too. Literally by doing a little preparation. Yeah, you can\u2019t\nprepare for everything. But you can prepare for a lot, in a surprisingly short\namount of time and space, if you\u2019re methodical and thoughtful about it.\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\npeople are really not used to dealing with someone who's well-prepared\n\n7:35 AM \u2219 Jun 16, 2020\n\n417Likes31Retweets\n\nThis is where I get to this strange situation of... am I being too harsh? On\nmyself? On others? Are my expectations too high? I don\u2019t think so. I think I\njust want more out of life than most people do. And I don\u2019t say that to flex\non anybody, if anything I\u2019ve come to become kinda sheepish and embarrassed\nabout it. You could say that I was infected with brain parasites, from all\nthose books that I read as a kid. I\u2019m choosing to write an essay about it in\npart because I don\u2019t like subjecting random people to it mid-conversation. I\ndon\u2019t want anybody to ever feel bad because of me, or feel like they\u2019re not-\nenough, not doing enough, etc etc.\n\nThe solution here is to have clear boundaries and to communicate them clearly.\nFor me, that looks like this:\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\nperiodic reminder (more for myself than for you) that I tweet for 0.1%\noutliers in optimism, thoughtfulness, creativity, kindness, competence,\nambition, drive, curiosity. all are welcome to read and hang out, but I won't\ndilute my writing trying to be \"more accessible\"\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\n0.01% of people is a lot of people\n\n2:40 PM \u2219 Jul 24, 2021\n\n176Likes6Retweets\n\nYou\u2019re completely welcome to think that I\u2019m full of shit, or that I\u2019m\nunlikeable, or overwrought, dramatic, annoying, arrogant, all of that stuff.\nYou\u2019d be right! I used to be rattled hard by negative feedback, and I would to\ntwist and bend to try and accommodate everyone, and that actually often made\nthings worse. So now I\u2019m finding that it\u2019s easier to say, look, this is what I\ncare about, this is the game I\u2019m playing, you don\u2019t have to play it, you don\u2019t\nhave to like me, cheers, have a nice day.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty funny when you see how, being comfortable with being disliked,\nactually makes you even more likeable. It\u2019s one of the many ways in which life\ncan be really unfair.\n\n####\n\nSeriousness in relationships\n\nNavigating conflicts about disparities (and perceived disparities) in\nseriousness can be very contentious. It can maim relationships \u2013 people have\nvicious, ugly fights over it, and sometimes they end relationships over it,\nand sometimes they don\u2019t when they probably should. \u201cI wish you would take\nthis seriously\u201d is a request that can get parsed as an attack. And sometimes\npeople don\u2019t know how (or are unable) to make that request in a kind, gentle\nway, and so they go for the attack.\n\nVisakan Veerasamy \u26f5\ufe0f @visakanv\n\nWife and I were laughing about this last night: the thing nobody quite tells\nyou about marriage is: you\u2019re choosing the person in life who\u2019s going to\nupset, disappoint annoy and frustrate you more than anybody else\n\n5:47 AM \u2219 Nov 7, 2018\n\n1,541Likes289Retweets\n\nMarriage is a serious proposition. It\u2019s a commitment for life. And... a lot of\nmarriages do end up in divorce. And I really, really don\u2019t want to offend or\nupset or hurt anybody when I say this, I say this with love and sadness... the\nfact that so many marriages end in divorce is, to me, further proof that we\nare not very serious. I don\u2019t say this to victim-blame people who have\nsuffered in unhappy marriages. I think divorce can be a good thing, and I have\ncheered full-heartedly for friends who have separated for the better. I think\nwhat I\u2019m trying to say is that we\u2019re pretty unserious as a species. We don\u2019t\ndo enough to prepare ourselves for such a serious endeavor. I call this \u201cthe\ndivorce mystery\u201d \u2013 why do so many people divorce someone they thought was\ntheir favorite person? It\u2019s not really a mystery: it\u2019s mostly because good\ntimes are a poor predictor of how you\u2019ll handle bad times. But as a species,\nas a culture, we have not truly internalized this.\n\nAnd... I think we can improve it! I think we can do better. That sounds like\nan idealistic teenager thing to say, but I\u2019m in my thirties now, and I believe\nI will continue saying this for as long as I live. I believe we can improve\nthe human condition. We are culture workers, some of us more conscientiously\ndeliberate than others. With our actions and our utterances we contribute to\nthe building of culture. This is one of the things that I\u2019m serious about. I\u2019m\nwilling to die trying. The work will not be done in my lifetime, or the next,\nso it\u2019s important to enjoy the process.\n\n####\n\nYou can\u2019t demand seriousness from other people.\n\nYou can really only encourage it. You can\u2019t bully people into becoming truly\nserious, because even if you \u2018succeed\u2019, they\u2019ll mainly internalize that\nbullying is how you get things done \u2013 and they\u2019ll likely get twisted up about\nperforming seriousness, rather than being serious. So the best way to\nencourage it is to demonstrate seriousness yourself, in your own words and\nactions. Review your own life, and ask yourself what you\u2019re serious about and\nwhat you\u2019re not. Strive to be honest with yourself and others.\n\nParents often try to demand seriousness from their children, and fail. Spouses\noften try to demand seriousness from each other, and fail. I\u2019ve lost friends\nfrom the bitter fights that can arise when you try to discuss this stuff with\npeople who haven\u2019t yet developed the finesse of navigating one\u2019s deep\nemotional and psychological wounds. I look back on some of those with grief,\nbecause oftentimes those friendships were borne out of a seeming mutual\ninterest in being serious together. But again, talk is cheap, and the road is\nlong, and you\u2019ll see for yourself along the way who sticks around and who\ncalls it quits.\n\nI do think it\u2019s important to be gentle and kind with people who quit. No\nmatter how great any of us might be, it is true that we\u2019re all some accident\nor event away from not being able to keep going. There is no reason for\ncruelty, harshness, judgement, etc.\n\nIf we want to build great scenes that produce great work, we need serious\npeople to be honest with themselves and each other. I am committed to spending\nthe rest of my life trying to be a beacon for serious players to find and\nconnect with each other. And in my model, if you\u2019re serious about your work,\nyou also have to work through your personal issues \u2013 you have to be kind, you\nhave to be gracious, and so on \u2013 so that your work can really shine.\n\n####\n\nSeriousness is love and curiosity expressed earnestly.\n\nI took a bit of a roundabout way to get to saying this but I mean it.\n\nThis sets my earliest statement in an interesting light, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cIt\u2019s\nfrustrating to not be taken seriously\u201d becomes \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be treated\nwithout love and curiosity\u201d. And here I feel this deep sadness at realizing\nhow lonely and despondent I felt in my formative years, but also a deep\ngratitude for the books and art and music that kept my soul alive. And I feel\na rekindling in my heart to pay it forward.\n\nIt renews my convictions.

I\nwould dearly like to visit this cathedral\n\n12:32 PM \u2219 Oct 1, 2021\n\n408Likes83Retweets\n\nIf you liked this essay, you\u2019d also like my pdf ebook INTROSPECT, which you\ncould read as a guide to taking yourself seriously.\n\n### Subscribe to visa's voltaic verses \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nBy visakan veerasamy \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\n\"And that's how we measure out our real respect for people\u2014by the degree of\nfeeling they can register, the voltage of life they can carry and tolerate\u2014and\nenjoy.

I'm trying to strike my version of that\nbalance, but I think I still need more practice. I think I'll always think\nthat. And I think that's probably for the best.EDIT: I was going through old\nnotes and found this: \"i spent so much of my life frustrated at not being\ntaken seriously, that for a long time i tried to take everyone else as\nmaximally seriously as possible, and funnily this too led to a bunch of crappy\noutcomes\".Expand full commentLike (11)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies by visakan veerasamy and others\n\nThe Principle PodcastThe Principle PodcastJan 21, 2023Liked by visakan\nveerasamy\"We crush the caterpillars and complain there are so few\nbutterflies.\"You have a hell of a way with words, my friend.
