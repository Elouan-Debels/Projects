Inference latency is, in particular, a challenge\nfor LLMs, and flash attention has become a key technique that enables your LLM\napplications to respond faster.\n\nTransformer models are built on the attention mechanism, which helps the model\nfocus on relevant parts of the text input when making predictions. However, as\ntransformer-based models become larger and larger to handle more complex tasks\nor larger datasets, a major limitation arises from the self-attention\nmechanism. This mechanism becomes increasingly slow and memory intensive as\nthe model size grows. This is because it keeps loading and unloading data from\nmemory. Flash Attention is introduced as a solution to mitigate this memory\nbottleneck problem associated with attention mechanisms in transformer models.\n\n## Why is Flash Attention important?\n\nBy improving the efficiency of attention operations, Flash Attention allows\nfor faster training and inference of transformer-based models. Rather than\nloading queries, keys, and values, or intermediate computation results\nmultiple times for each computation iteration, Flash Attention loads all the\ndata (queries, keys, and values) just once. It then computes the attention\nscore (conducts a series of operations) on this loaded data before writing\nback the final results. Additionally, it divides the loaded data into smaller\nblocks, aiding parallel processing.\n\nBy strategically minimizing the back-and-forth data transfers between memory\ntypes, Flash Attention optimizes resource utilization. Key strategies include\n\"kernel fusion,\" which combines multiple computation steps into a single\noperation, reducing the need for repetitive data transfers thus reducing\noverhead. This streamlined approach not only enhances computational efficiency\nbut also simplifies the implementation process, making it accessible to a\nbroader audience of practitioners. Another key strategy is \"tiling\", which\ninvolves partitioning the input data into smaller blocks to facilitate\nparallel processing. This strategy optimizes memory usage, enabling scalable\nsolutions for models with larger input sizes.\n\n## Optimizing Data Movement with Flash Attention\n\nHigh Bandwidth Memory (HBM) offers large memory capacity but suffers from\nslower processing speeds. On the other hand, SRAM (Static Random-Access\nMemory) is a type of memory that provides fast access to data but is typically\nlimited in capacity compared to HBM. On-chip SRAM, as the name suggests, is\nlocated directly on the chip, enabling even faster access times compared to\noff-chip memory.\n\nIn standard attention mechanisms, such as those used in standard transformer\nmodels, HBM is used to store, read, and write the keys, queries, and values\nused in the attention computation. However, the operations involved in\nattention calculations often lead to frequent data transfers between HBM and\non-chip SRAM. For example, during computation, keys, queries, and values are\nloaded from HBM into on-chip SRAM for processing, and intermediate results and\nfinal outputs are written back to HBM after each step of the attention\nmechanism. The frequent movement of data between HBM and SRAM results in high\noverhead due to the time spent on data transfer and processing.\n\nInstead, Flash Attention optimizes the movement of data between HBM and on-\nchip SRAM by reducing redundant reads and writes. Instead of performing these\noperations for each individual attention step, Flash Attention loads the keys,\nqueries, and values only once, combines or \"fuses\" the operations of the\nattention mechanism, and then writes the results back to memory. This reduces\nthe overall computational overhead and improves efficiency.\n\nIn summary, while standard attention mechanisms rely heavily on data movement\nbetween HBM and SRAM, Flash Attention introduces optimizations such as\noptimized data movement, kernel fusion, and efficient memory usage to minimize\noverhead and improve efficiency in memory access and computation. The impact\nof Flash Attention offers tangible benefits in terms of both training speed\nand inference latency.\n\n## Flash Attention in Fine-Tuning Frameworks\n\nAxolotl supports flash-attention for open-source models like Llama-2 and\nMistral. You can enable flash-attention by installing its profile along with\naxolotl:\n\npip install axolotl[flash-attn]\n\nAxolotl can be used for fine-tuning models on Hopsworks by simply installing\nit as a Python dependency in your project. Your fine-tuning training data can\nbe loaded from Hopsworks by Axolotl using the built-in FUSE support that makes\nyour training data, stored on HopsFS-S3, available as local files to Axolotl.\n\n## Model Serving Servers that support Flash Attention\n\nSeveral model serving servers now support flash attention, including vLLM, and\nHF\u2019s one. It is anticipated that many more model serving servers will support\nflash attention to supercharge LLMs.\n\nFor an Enterprise model serving solution with flash attention, Hopsworks comes\nwith KServe support, which includes support for both vLLM and HF model serving\nservers. This gives you the benefits of scale, low latency, logging,\nmonitoring, and access control for serving LLMs at high performance.\n\nDoes this content look outdated?
