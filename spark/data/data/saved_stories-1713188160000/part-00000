Each feature's influence obtains an\ninteger score, making it easier to understand and communicate the model,\ncrucial in sectors where transparency is vital.\n\nDec 22, 2023\n\n### Cookie Mining\n\nA companion to our Orange Data Mining Holiday Special video on how we mined\ncookie descriptions and how to create cookie clustering.\n\nDec 20, 2023\n\n### Our Christmas Present: Free Orange T-Shirt!\n\nEnroll in our survival analysis tutorial, and you might just unwrap a free\nOrange T-shirt along with a hefty dose of data science cheer!\n\n## Visual Programming\n\nNo coding needed. Place widgets on the canvas, connect them, load your\ndatasets, and harvest the insight!\n\nLearn moreWatch video\n\n## Interactive Data Visualization\n\nExplore statistical distributions, box plots and scatter plots, or dive deeper\nwith decision trees, hierarchical clustering, heatmaps, MDS, t-SNE and linear\nprojections. Even your multidimensional data can make sense.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Extensions\n\nSpecialized add-ons can perform natural language processing and text mining,\nconduct network analysis, do association rules mining, or address fairness in\nmachine learning. Some address specialized data, such as time series, survival\ndata sets, spectra, or gene expressions. Also, check out Orange's cousin\nQuasar.\n\nWatch video\n\n## Teach with Orange\n\nWhen teaching data mining, we like to illustrate rather than only explain. And\nOrange is great at that. Used at schools, universities and in professional\ntraining courses across the world, Orange supports hands-on training and\nvisual illustrations of concepts from data science. There are even widgets\nthat were especially designed for teaching.\n\nLearn more\n\nMy laboratory produces large amounts of data from RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and genome\nresequencing experiments. Orange allows me to analyze my data even though I\ndon\u2019t know how to program. It also allows me to communicate with my\ncollaborators, who are experts in data mining, and with my colleagues and\ntrainees.\n\nGad Shaulsky, Ph.D.\n\nMolecular biologist and Director of Graduate Studies (Baylor College of\nMedicine, Houston, USA)\n\nThe scientific community is in need of tools that allow easy construction of\nworkflows and visualizations and are capable of analyzing large amounts of\ndata. Orange is a powerful platform to perform data analysis and\nvisualization, see data flow and become more productive. It provides a clean,\nopen source platform and the possibility to add further functionality for all\nfields of science.\n\nFerenc Borondics, Ph.D.\n\nPrincipal beamline scientist at SMIS (SOLEIL synchrotron, France)\n\nI teach Orange workshops monthly to a diverse audience, from undergrad\nstudents to expert researchers. Orange is very intuitive, and, by the end of\nthe workshop, the participants are able to perform complex data visualization\nand basic machine learning analyses. Most of our attendees have been able to\nincorporate this tool in their research practice.\n\nFrancesca Vitali, Ph.D.\n\nResearch Assistant Professor (Center for Biomedical Informatics &\nBiostatistics, The University of Arizona)\n\n## Contribute to Orange\n\nIf you love using Orange and want to support us, a donation would be very much\nappreciated.
