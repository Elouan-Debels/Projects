The\n62-year-old nonprofit executive\u2019s situation is straightforward: She only has\none or two W2 forms for her employment, sometimes with a 1099 for some\nconsulting work on the side, and her bank interest to report. She\u2019s always\nfigured that it wasn\u2019t worth paying a company like TurboTax or H&R Block to do\nwork she was capable of doing herself.\n\nNaturally, that meant the onus was on her to print out paper forms and set\naside hours to complete her taxes each year, following the instructions and\nhoping she got everything right. It was a process she consistently dreaded, so\nmuch so that she typically put it off until right before April 15. In more\nrecent years she\u2019s used the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s free filing options,\nwhich offer people who earn under certain thresholds access to commercial tax\nprep software. These, she says, are \u201cbetter than the paper ones but still time\nconsuming.\u201d Making her way through the numerous questions\u2014and determining\nwhether she qualified for various credits and deductions\u2014took a lot of work.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take a lot less time.\u201d If she owed the government, it meant going\nthrough a separate process to either mail in a check or muddle through another\nonline form.\n\nBut then she read about the IRS\u2019s new Direct File pilot in a newspaper\narticle, an option the IRS launched this year to let Americans file their\ntaxes for free directly with the agency. And when she found out that her state\nis one of the ones where the pilot is operational this tax season, she was\ndelighted. \u201cI went, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a great idea,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCongressional Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which not\nonly sent more funding to the IRS but required it to study direct filing. The\nIRS took that prompt and decided to build and roll out such an option this\nyear. This season, Direct File is available in 12 states: Arizona, California,\nFlorida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota,\nTennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. It\u2019s open to people with the\nsimplest tax situations: those who take the standard deduction\u2014which nearly 90\npercent of Americans do\u2014with W2 earnings from salaried employment, benefits\nfrom Social Security or unemployment insurance, and interest income of $1,500\nor less. The IRS expects several hundred thousand people to use it this\nseason; more than 50,000 people used it in the first two weeks.\n\nThose lucky thousands who get to use Direct File this year will almost\ncertainly save a whole lot of money and time. The IRS estimated that the\naverage taxpayer spent $210 and 11 hours to file their taxes in 2019.\n\nA few days after Black read about Direct File she decided to use it during an\nhour-long break in her work schedule, hoping that would be enough time to get\nher return done. She gathered the few documents she would need and logged in.\n\u201cIt was really user friendly compared to the other ones that I\u2019ve used,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cThe questions were simple and very clear.\u201d At the end she was told she\nowed $17 and was able to make the payment right then and there.\n\nIt took her between 15 and 20 minutes from start to finish, giving her back\nabout 45 minutes to do other things. That kind of time \u201cis really valuable,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cThat\u2019s huge.\u201d She also said it was far less stressful.\n\n\u201cIt was the most convenient way I\u2019ve ever filed my taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cI got to\nbe honest, it surprised me how simple it was.\u201d\n\nDirect File is currently available in Spanish, and the goal is to expand it to\nother languages as well. It also offers a way to chat with an actual human IRS\nemployee if someone has any problems or concerns, available Monday through\nFriday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nSome people who use it will have to file state taxes as well. Washington State\nhas no income tax, nor do Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota,\nTennessee, Texas, or Wyoming, so Black and her fellow Washingtonians don\u2019t\nhave to worry about state returns. In three other states\u2014Arizona,\nMassachusetts, and New York\u2014an integration tool copies a taxpayer\u2019s data from\nthe federal return over to the state one and then asks any remaining\nquestions. California directs users to the state filing site but doesn\u2019t\nprepopulate its fields with the information that users provide the feds.\n\nEven so, Direct File was a revelation for Carlos Gomez. When the 28-year-old\ngot his first W2 five years ago, he took it across the street from his\napartment in Pomona, California, to a storefront tax preparation firm. His\nparents had instilled in him a fear of getting things wrong on his return, so\nhe figured a service would ensure no mistakes were made, and he went back\nevery tax season. But it cost him about $100 every year to file his taxes, not\nto mention finding the time to get away from work and spend an hour getting\nthem done.\n\nThis year when he saw something about Direct File pop up in a friend\u2019s\nInstagram story he figured he would try doing his taxes by himself for the\nfirst time. He \u201cbasically did my taxes on my lunch break,\u201d he said. He had his\nW2 with him at work, so he was able to fill out all of his income information\nright then and there. The last piece was his signature from last year\u2019s\nreturn, which he was able to complete after digging his return out of a box at\nhome in a matter of seconds. Start to finish it took him about 20 minutes. \u201cIt\nwas a walk in the park,\u201d he said. Afterward the site directed him to where to\nfile his state return digitally, which was \u201cvery similar,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides saving himself time, it meant he didn\u2019t have to shell money out to a\npreparer. He got back about $400 total from his return this year\u2014and would\nhave lost a quarter of that had he stuck to his previous accountant. That\nmoney will \u201cgo in a piggy bank to save for a rainy day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes a\nbig difference.\u201d He\u2019s since tried to convince his family members and co-\nworkers to use Direct File too.\n\nThis year\u2019s Direct File pilot has been purposefully small and contained.\nMemories of the tortured debacle that was the Healthcare.gov rollout linger in\nWashington, so the IRS was smart to start small, the better to give itself the\nopportunity to fix bugs and learn lessons about the user experience, and then\nexpand the program carefully. The pilot was strategically released during the\nquiet part of tax season in the hope that it would be ready for prime time\nwhen the last-minute crunch of Tax Day finally arrives.\n\nAdvocates now have their eyes set on not just making sure the pilot doesn\u2019t\ndisappear but expanding as far as possible. \u201cDirect File ought to be expanded\nover a period of a couple years to most situations,\u201d said Adam Ruben, vice\npresident of campaigns and political strategy at the Economic Security\nProject.\n\nOne immediate goal for advocates is not just to expand the number of states\nwhere Direct File is available but also to incorporate the integration\navailable in Arizona, Massachusetts, and New York to others so that state\nreturns are prepopulated. Two different versions of that integration software\nwere built for this season, which means state systems that operate differently\nwill be able to choose the one that works best. For some states it \u201cis not\nmuch more than flipping a switch,\u201d Ruben said. For others, such as California,\nwhich has its own unique platform, it will take more work.\n\nNext, Ruben wants to see Direct File expanded to include people with 1099\nforms for gig work or side jobs. Eventually, he thinks it could cover the most\ncommon situations. TurboTax, after all, is able to tackle any tax situation\nwith its online software.\n\nUltimately, the goal is not only a filing system that is simple and free, but\none where the IRS does most of the work. Economists have found that even with\njust the information the agency already has on its own it could successfully\nfully prepopulate about half of all Americans\u2019 returns, and for the rest of\ntaxpayers, the majority would need to make just one change to finish their\nreturn. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear the IRS could do most people\u2019s taxes,\u201d said Vanessa\nWilliamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Treasury\nSecretary Janet Yellen has already said she hopes future versions of Direct\nFile will include information from W2s.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, we want to see all states, all common tax situations, and\nreally robust prepopulation,\u201d Ruben said. That would include filling forms out\nnot just with information the IRS already has but with information from other\ngovernment agencies as well, such as the Social Security Administration. As in\nmany other countries, that would mean most American taxpayers could simply\ncheck to make sure their return looked correct and sign off on it; anyone who\nwanted to add more information for credits or deductions would be free to do\nso. \u201cThere\u2019s really no reason why we should put taxpayers through this annual\nexercise of, \u2018Better make sure you do this right because we\u2019ll check your math\non the back end,\u2019\u201d said Igor Volsky, campaign director of Better IRS.\n\nThe Economic Security Project has estimated that Direct File could cover most\ntax situations in all states, integrate with state filing, and offer\n\u201csignificant\u201d prepopulation within five years. At that point, the organization\nprojects that it would save Americans $8 billion a year in filing fees and $3\nbillion worth of time saved. It could deliver billions of unclaimed tax\ncredits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, to\nfamilies that are currently eligible but don\u2019t claim them.\n\nThe program would also save the government money. The IRS could save $300\nmillion, the organization estimates, by reducing the time it takes to handle\npaper returns and resolve errors.\n\nThe problem with expanding Direct File \u201cis not a technological problem or a\nlogistical problem,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThe problem is a political problem.\u201d\nMaking the program permanent and allowing it to keep growing will require both\nreliable funding and letting the agency do its work without interference.\n\nBut there is already opposition coalescing against Direct File. Intuit, which\nowns TurboTax and has spent decades fighting free and easy tax filing,\nimmediately and unsurprisingly opposed it. In February, 12 state attorneys\ngeneral sent a letter to Yellen opposing Direct File and calling it\n\u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Republicans in Congress have been pushing hard to claw\nback IRS funding, some of which has made the pilot possible, and have even\ntried to explicitly block the agency from doing it.\n\nVolsky still thinks that now that Direct File is out in the open, it will\nprove hard to get rid of. \u201cThere is a strong foundation both of public support\nand also a proof point about the success of the program,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roots\nof Direct File are pretty damn strong.\u201d\n\nThe goal, Ruben said, is not to eliminate the accountants and TurboTaxes of\nthe world. If you like your tax preparer, you\u2019ll be able to keep them. The\nidea is to compete with them by having the government offer something better.\n\u201cThis is a public option,\u201d he noted. The very wealthy will probably need their\naccountants for all of their offshore tax havens; some low-income people with\nvery complicated returns and language barriers can make use of the Volunteer\nIncome Tax Assistance program. But with a free and easy option on the market,\nother preparers may feel the pressure to make their products better and more\naffordable. \u201cIt\u2019s fighting TurboTax\u2019s effective monopoly on the market,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nThat alone carries huge significance. Paying taxes is \u201ca civic function that\nshould be handled by the government,\u201d Williamson argued. The faster people can\ndo their taxes, the faster they can get their refunds and get back to their\nlives.\n\nMoreover, a program that dramatically reduces the time, expense, and anxiety\nabout filing your annual return could change how Americans view paying taxes\ngenerally\u2014and, possibly, make them less allergic to raising them. The United\nStates is a low-tax country given our wealth. \u201cBecause the income tax is\nirritating for many Americans, it puts them in the mindset that they are in\nthe same class as all the other taxpayers who are oppressed by the tax\nsystem,\u201d Williamson said. In other words, because paying taxes is such a huge\nhassle, the 99 percent has come to believe that it pays taxes just like the 1\npercent. This illusion can make us \u201cmore open to top-heavy tax cuts,\u201d she\nsays, because it distorts our sense of class\u2014and therefore our sense of tax\nfairness.\n\nDirect File even has the potential to change how Americans interact with and\nsee their government. If scaled up completely, it could represent \u201cgovernment\nat its best,\u201d Ruben said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking something that\u2019s a real pain point with\nbeing a taxpayer in this country and making it frictionless.\u201d\n\nThat pays dividends for our democracy. An easy tax-paying process may not\nsound like something that could make or break our increasingly fragile\npolitical system, but it\u2019s one of the regular times we all interact directly\nwith our government. If the government can prove that it can make our lives\neasier, we might become more inclined to participate in it and work to improve\nit. \u201cCreating a government that people have trust in is vitally important to\nthe functioning of a democracy,\u201d Williamson noted.\n\nCindy Black doesn\u2019t just recommend that other people use Direct File. She\u2019s\nhoping it sticks around for good. \u201cI would totally do it again,\u201d she said.\nShe\u2019d like to see it expanded so that it can be available to people with more\ncomplicated tax filing needs. The only change she would make would be\nprepopulating the form with information the IRS already has. \u201cThat would just\ntake it to the next level,\u201d she said.\n\nBryce Covert @brycecovert\n\nBryce Covert is a contributor to The Nation and The New York Times.
