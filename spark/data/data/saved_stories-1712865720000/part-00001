Their recent failures have been spectacular\nand covered extensively in the news. In 2018 and 2019, 346 people died in 2\nseparate 737 MAX 8 airplanes. And in January of this year, a piece of the\nfuselage (a \u201cdoor plug\u201d) came off another Boeing airplane while in flight.\n\nThese failures have been a long time coming, and are the symptoms of long-term\nmismanagement. The mismanagement is reflected in an empty product pipeline, an\naging workforce, a faltering defense business, and huge spending on stock\nbuybacks while the company remains deep in debt. To top that off, Boeing paid\nan astounding $32.8M last year to the CEO who is flying Boeing into\nirrelevancy.\n\nBoeing\u2019s trajectory is sad, but it\u2019s not irreversible. The company has a\ndiversified portfolio. It needs to lean into its winners and pivot away from\nits losers.\n\nHere are my thoughts on what the next set of company leaders should do with\neach of the 3 major business units:\n\n  * Commercial Airplanes, which makes passenger and cargo planes for airlines\n  * Defense, Space, and Security, which is a major defense contractor that makes everything from satellites to fighter jets\n  * Spare Parts and Aftermarket Services (spoiler alert: this unit is in the best shape of the three)\n\nDisclosure: I was an intern at Boeing 11 years ago, but none of these thoughts\nare directly related to that experience.\n\n## Commercial Airplanes\n\nThis is the part of Boeing that we are most familiar with, and in many ways\nthe crown jewel. It makes passenger and cargo aircraft, like the 737 family\nand the 787. Surprisingly, this unit only makes up 40-45% of the company\u2019s\nrevenue in recent years.\n\nIt sounds obvious, but Boeing needs to stabilize its existing airplane\nprograms by focusing on quality control. This means ending near-term\ndistractions like other requests it has pending with the FAA. After it gets\nthat under control, Boeing should launch a new airliner program. Building a\nnew aircraft may sound incongruous with putting a singular focus on quality,\nbut I will explain why it is necessary.\n\n### Stabilizing existing programs\n\nBoeing\u2019s commercial airplane business has been in a long-term, stable duopoly\nwith Airbus, riding on the growth of global air travel. It has a host of\nadvantages in this business: a storied brand, a massive install base with\nmarquee customers flying all-Boeing fleets, a hometown regulator, and the\nexport power of the US government.\n\nHowever, over the past several years, it has been steadily losing share. In\n1995, Airbus had 18% market share. Under the guidance of a legendary sales\nchief, Airbus navigated missteps like the A380 program and worked its way to a\n50/50 market share split with Boeing by 1999. This 50/50 split was durable for\nthe better part of two decades, but has now tilted to 62/38 in Airbus\u2019 favor\n(measured by backlog of orders for Boeing\u2019s 737 family vs. Airbus\u2019 A320\nfamily). It may be heading for 70/30.\n\nAirbus A320 (light blue) / Boeing 737 (dark blue) order backlog from July 2022\nSource: FT\n\nThe reasons for the recent decline are simple. After the 2018/2019 MAX\ncrashes, Boeing lost the trust of its airline customers, and hasn\u2019t been\ndelivering enough aircraft to keep up. Boeing was slow to diagnose and admit\nthe issues with the MAX, and slow to resolve them. This resulted in protracted\ngroundings, which infuriated airline customers who invested large amounts of\nmoney in these airplanes. Other factors have sped up the decline in market\nshare, e.g., Airbus gaining control of a potential third competitor, and\nthereby adding a new, efficient plane to their lineup. That is a wild story\nfor another post.\n\nBoeing\u2019s top priority should be to get back to delivering aircraft safely at\nfull rate. It should welcome customer and regulator representatives to visit\nits factories, inspect its lines, and participate in finding solutions to\nproduction issues. This should be everybody\u2019s focus. That is the only way to\nrestore confidence and to get the FAA to agree to expand production.\n\nTo give the FAA confidence that Boeing can produce quality airplanes, it needs\nto actually do the things you would do if you want to produce quality\nairplanes. Boeing cannot achieve this by checking boxes or adding compliance\npaperwork alone...it must actually embark on the spiritual journey of wanting\nto make a good product and having its whole team buy into that. Clearly\nsomething is broken here. Managers need to spend more time on the shop floor.\nQuality management systems must be improved. Factory workers must be\nincentivized and aligned with the right objectives. The current negotiation\nwith a major factory union is a great opportunity to set this last point on\nthe right path.\n\nFixing the 737 MAX 9 (the aircraft involved in the door plug incident) means\ndeprioritizing certification of two other aircraft variants in the 737 MAX\nfamily: the 737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 10. Certification of these aircraft is\npending resolution of an issue with the anti-ice system. Finally, there are\nissues with the 777 and 787 as well, but those should also be addressed after\nthe MAX is stabilized.\n\n### Launching a new program\n\nDave Calhoun, the current CEO, has repeatedly said a new aircraft is not\ncoming any time soon. He allegedly told Wall Street analysts: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\nwon\u2019t be launching anything new for at least another decade.\u201d This is horribly\nbackward. Despite all its issues today, Boeing needs a vision for the future.\nIf it is not going to build anything new, we should be worried. What\u2019s the\npoint? Is the company just going to harvest until it winds down?\n\nBoeing needs to announce a new aircraft program. It should wait until the MAX\nsituation has stabilized to announce this, but not too much longer. Here are\nthe core arguments why (some other references):\n\n  * You need to build new products to attract and retain engineering talent; if you don\u2019t, your engineering muscles will atrophy.\n  * There is a huge market for next-gen airliners at stake, worth $100B+; competitors will take it if you don\u2019t, and you\u2019ll miss out on the next generation\n  * Mature technology can already produce a sufficient efficiency gain (10-15%) to justify the investment, despite what Boeing executives say\n\nFrankenstein extensions of current products have been taken as far as they can\ngo, and have problems of their own (the 737 MAX is a prime example). Engine\nupgrades can only improve the aircraft so much, and have similarly been taken\nto their current limit. Boeing needs to develop a clean sheet design. There\nare plenty of candidate configurations, like the Truss-Braced Wing, Blended\nWing Body, or the D8 Double Bubble. These have all been studied by Boeing at\nvarious points. Boeing could use this as an opportunity to leave the local\nmaximum of the \u201ctube and wing\u201d design.\n\nIt is reasonable to wonder whether a new aircraft program would distract from\nthe ability to fix quality issues on the 737 MAX. In the early phases, the\npeople involved in the preliminary design would be a mostly distinct set from\nthose working on the production systems for the 737 MAX. There should be\nminimal resource contention here. Once the program gets going, there will be\nsome splitting of executive attention, but there is no way around this, and\nthe program is existential.\n\nIf Boeing does not develop a new aircraft, new entrants like COMAC, Embraer,\nand startups will enter the narrowbody market and take Boeing\u2019s place in the\nnext product iteration. They may enter anyway, but Boeing should participate\nin the market it created.\n\n### Workforce\n\nThere are time-sensitive workforce issues that weigh on both Boeing\u2019s need and\ncapability to launch a new aircraft.\n\nEngineers\n\nThe company is suffering from an engineering workforce age problem that is a\nticking time bomb. By some indications, nearly half of the engineers in\nBoeing\u2019s Seattle base are over 50 years old (although recent data is hard to\nfind).\n\nThese workers will take critical tribal knowledge with them when they go,\nleaving gaps that will be very hard to fill. Boeing\u2019s last clean sheet\naircraft program, the 787, was launched in 2004. An engineer who was 30-years-\nold at the time is now nearing retirement age. If Boeing waits another 5 or 10\nyears to kick off a new program, it will have nobody left who remembers how to\ndesign new aircraft. There needs to be a mass recruitment effort of younger\npeople to refresh the workforce, and a new program for them to work on.\n\nThis recruitment effort should be biased towards more software engineers, to\nreflect the fact that modern aerospace products are increasingly like flying\ncomputers. The workforce\u2019s expertise is tilted too far towards traditional\naero domains.\n\nProduction workers\n\nThere are also issues with production workers in Boeing\u2019s Seattle base, where\nthe 737 MAX planes are built. Negotiations with the IAM, the largest union\nthere, have started. The union\u2019s expectation is 30-40% wage increases over the\nnext several years, based on the benchmark of auto worker wage increases. This\nunion represents 32,000 workers, or 21% of Boeing\u2019s workforce. Boeing doesn\u2019t\nhave much leverage to push back, given the other issues they are facing.\n\nThe production workforce has been continually antagonized over the past couple\nof CEO tenures. Of special note, during the last negotiation with this\nparticular union, Boeing\u2019s management announced that they would build the 787\nin a non-union plant in South Carolina. This decision antagonized the Seattle\nworkforce and is still a source of embitterment.\n\nBoeing should give the union what it wants, even at the expense of short-term\nfinancial pain. They should also consider commitments to build the next\naircraft in Seattle. This would go a long way to align the workforce with\nBoeing\u2019s future success.\n\n## Defense, Space, and Security\n\nBoeing\u2019s second largest business unit, which makes \u201cDefense, Space, &\nSecurity'' products, is also struggling. The unit was historically an\nuncorrelated counterweight to the commercial unit\u2019s cycles. Today, this unit\nis unprofitable and home to a range of programs that are perennially over\nbudget and behind schedule.\n\nRevenue was flat last year at ~$25B (32% of total), with a $1.7B loss. Charges\nare mounting on key programs.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n  * The VC-25B program, the replacement for Air Force One, has now lost $2.4B and has dragged the whole division into the red.\n  * Starliner, Boeing\u2019s space capsule, has now lost $1.5B. SpaceX has already flown 8 missions on Crew Dragon before Starliner has even flown one. These two programs were once viewed as neck-and-neck competitors.\n  * The KC-46A military air tanker program has lost more than $5B, more than the entire budget of the program. This was firm-fixed-price, so taxpayers are not bearing the burden, but it\u2019s bad for Boeing.\n  * The satellite division lost $315M just last year on a charge for the SES O3b mPOWER constellation.\n\nBoeing is not reliably able to deliver large projects on time or on budget.\nFor some of these businesses, the answer might be to change to a more\ncommercial posture. For example, there is a story to be told about how Boeing\nmight evolve its satellite business to compete with newer entrants. There are\nsome programs Boeing simply cannot get out of, and has no choice but to\nimprove and deliver.\n\nFor other product lines, especially ones without a significant contract win in\nsight, the right answer might be to exit / restructure the business. There is\na stable of acquisitive defense contractors who might be interested in pieces\nof these businesses.\n\nBoeing should invest in programs / areas it wants to be a player in, and pare\nback the rest. One thing that may seem obvious but should not be taken for\ngranted: this R&D investment should come from Boeing\u2019s own money, not the\ngovernment\u2019s money. A company investing its own money to develop capabilities\nand products is so rare in the defense industry that it has been given a\nspecial name, \u201cinternal research and development (IRAD)\u201d.\n\n### Space\n\nIn space, the competition is just much stronger than it was 20 years ago.\nSpaceX is leading the charge, but there is a whole cohort of fast-moving\ncompanies eating Boeing\u2019s lunch.\n\nSome thoughts on a few of the unit\u2019s space programs:\n\n  * Boeing makes the core for the Space Launch System (SLS), a large NASA rocket which looks increasingly questionable vs. Starship. SLS has splintered itself across 46 states, making it very resilient politically. But if current trends continue, even it will be tough to defend.\n  * The International Space Station, which Boeing has a contract to maintain, is set to be retired in 2030. Boeing doesn\u2019t have a prime role in any of the successors.\n  * As mentioned above, Starliner and the satellites division are still the sources of large charges.\n  * The X-37 space plane program is a bright spot.\n  * Rumors suggest that Boeing was already looking to sell its 50% stake in United Launch Alliance (ULA), a space launch provider, before this year. That seems like a good idea. Boeing was not the right owner for that business.\n\nActually, ULA may be a good model for what a Boeing transformation could look\nlike. In 2014, the rocket company was struggling to respond to stiff\ncompetition from SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket. It brought in the current CEO, Tory\nBruno, who took decisive action to transform the legacy company into something\nmore nimble. He launched a new rocket program, consolidated two legacy rocket\nfamilies into one, closed redundant launch sites, refreshed the workforce, and\nbuilt a partnership with Blue Origin. These changes took the better part of a\ndecade. Boeing is a much larger organization than ULA, so will take longer to\nchange. But ULA provides a relevant case study, and the lesson is that\ntransforming the company should be viewed as a project of 5-10 years or more.\n\n## Military aircraft\n\nThe future of Boeing\u2019s military aircraft programs is not clear. There is still\nhope for Boeing to snag a generational program with the US Air Force\u2019s next-\ngeneration fighter (\u201cNGAD\u201d) and the US Navy\u2019s analog (\u201cF/A-XX\u201d). That could\nkeep the lines humming and ensure Boeing\u2019s relevancy for another 50 years.\nWinning one or both of those programs would be transformative.\n\nWith the rest of the portfolio, it is worth considering all the strategic\noptions, including divestitures.\n\n  * For existing programs, the F-15 jet continues to deliver incremental improvements.\n  * The F/A-18 jet line is finally scheduled to be closed in 2027, after a few postponements. Those workers will presumably be moved to work on the F-15 and T-7.\n  * The delivery of the first T-7As, a small aircraft the US Air Force will use to train future pilots, seems to be an exception and is a source for optimism.\n  * Boeing\u2019s rotorcraft programs are not in a healthy state. The company was shut out of the two large next-generation military helicopter programs: FARA and FLRAA. FARA has since been canceled, which means some Chinook (CH-47) and Apache (AH-64) helicopters will see a longer life, but it is not a long-term answer for Boeing. The Army has signaled it may prefer smaller, uncrewed aircraft to more expensive crewed platforms going forward. Boeing\u2019s experience with ScanEagle and MQ-28 may help it here.\n\n    * The Apache and Chinook helicopter programs are very much late-stage programs, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any major work coming down the pike. Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop new, innovative concepts in this area, e.g., autonomy with unmanned AH-6 Little Bird helicopter, or the A160 Hummingbird helicopter all seem to have failed or been deprioritized. It\u2019s not clear what the future of the rotorcraft division is. Boeing does not currently have any commercial helicopter programs that might offset the slumps in Department of Defense (DoD) demand, as peers Airbus, Leonardo, and Bell do.\n\nThe company now owns 100% of Wisk, which could be viewed as its future\ncommercial VTOL bet. Wisk has a very ambitious vision of autonomy, and this\nproject should be applauded. On the flip side, Boeing\u2019s track record of\ncultivating startups is poor. It is probably better off buying mature\nconcepts.\n\nDisclosure: I work for another company building autonomous aircraft, in a\nsimilar space as Wisk.\n\n## Spare Parts and Aftermarket Services\n\nBoeing\u2019s commercial aftermarket unit is the only unit without significant\nissues right now. It earned $19.1B in revenue last year (~25% of the total),\nwith a 17.4% operating margin.\n\nBoeing needs to lean into this business. There are strong macro tailwinds, and\nironically, performance here may improve if the commercial unit ships fewer\nnew airplanes. Maintaining an older fleet will require higher maintenance\nspending.\n\nBoeing\u2019s share of its own aftermarket spend is low compared to others, but the\nwave of \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d spending presents an opportunity to grow,\naided by data the company has preferential access to. This is not just zero-\nsum...Boeing may actually save airlines money by reducing airlines\u2019\nmaintenance spending, while taking share.\n\nThere are, however, still issues with basic \u201cblocking and tackling\u201d in this\nunit. For one, the integration among the various legacy businesses Boeing\nacquired to form this unit is not operationally complete. There are still\nmultiple ERP systems, competing internal teams/projects, and unneeded\ncomplexity. These issues should be resolved. The performance of this unit\nmight also be even stronger if not for the distraction of issues in other\nunits.\n\n## So What?\n\nBoeing is starting from a remarkable legacy, and has so many things in its\nfavor. But poor execution, an unfavorable mix of complex legacy businesses,\nand bad luck have left it in a very tough spot.\n\nIt is timely that GE, an American industrial base peer, has just finished\nsplitting itself up into 3 companies. That process took 5 years. It\u2019s not a\nstretch of the imagination that Boeing could be in the same situation 5 years\nfrom now. That might not be the worst thing, given the new GE companies\u2019 share\nprices. But if Boeing wants to avoid a breakup, new management needs to make\nbig changes.\n\nThere is absolutely a way out of the current situation. The company needs to\ngive its workers and customers a clear vision of the future, and that future\nneeds to involve new products. Overall, I suspect the future Boeing will need\nto be leaner and smaller, with a more focused portfolio.\n\nThe company likes to talk about the aerospace milestones it was a part of\nduring its first 100 years. But if it doesn\u2019t make significant changes, it may\nnot survive to see the next century.\n\n### Subscribe to Hangar\n\nSign up if you'd like to get email updates about new posts.
