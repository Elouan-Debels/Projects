Their use\nis important for comparing results, similar to the way standard test images\nare used in image processing.\n\n## Modelled[edit]\n\nDesigned using CAD software; sorted by year of modelling.\n\nName and viewer| Render| Year of creation| Person/organisation that did the\nmodelling| Description of source object| Model size| License| Comments  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nUtah teapot| 1975| Martin Newell at University of Utah| Melitta teapot| 28\nB\u00e9zier patches (32 with the bottom)^[1]| Also called the \"Newell teapot\".
