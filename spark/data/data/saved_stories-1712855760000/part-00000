Their target was the\nresidence of Thomas Finlay, a former cabinetmaker who was suspected of running\nan \u2018infidel\u2019 library on the premises. Described by his sympathisers as a\n\u2018respectable and venerable old man\u2019, he had never previously attracted\nunwanted attention from the authorities. Yet Finlay had fallen foul of Scots\nblasphemy law, which banned the publication, sale or circulation of any work\nthat denied or ridiculed Christianity or the divine inspiration of the\nscriptures. From the 1820s, the authorities had sought to clamp down on such\nmaterials and, for the first time since the 17th century, several Scots faced\ncharges of blasphemy. The raid on Finlay\u2019s home, which he later recalled had\nleft the \u2018innermost corner of my dwelling ransacked, and the very locks of\nhair of my departed father and mother strewed about\u2019, duly uncovered numerous\nblasphemous books and pamphlets. These materials were seized in evidence and\nFinlay spent a grim night in Calton Jail before being released on bail, paid\nby his friends, to await trial.\n\nFinlay\u2019s arrest was just one of several dramatic episodes in a fractious\nbattle over belief that unfurled in the early decades of 19th-century\nScotland. At the heart of the struggle lay fundamental questions about freedom\nof expression. Should individuals have the right to share publicly\ncontroversial views on religion? Or were there ethical grounds to suppress the\npublic dissemination of such ideas for public safety? The debate had been\nsparked by the striking emergence of minority groups of self-professed\n\u2018conscientious unbelievers\u2019 or freethinkers during the 1820s, one of which\nFinlay had joined at its inception.\n\nThe most vocal members of these communities were either materialist atheists\nwho denied God\u2019s existence or deists who believed in a creator deity but\nrejected the divinely inspired status of the Bible. Despite theological\ndifferences, freethinkers shared the view that Christian theology,\ninstitutions and clergy had harmed the welfare of individuals and society.\nMany were sympathetic to political reform and argued that the erroneous belief\nin providence encouraged acceptance of the sociopolitical status quo as part\nof the divine plan. Others pointed to the distress caused by belief in the\nCalvinist doctrine of double predestination, which asserted that the elect\nwere foreordained for salvation while the damned were destined to eternal\ndamnation. Above all, it was agreed that social and individual flourishing\ndepended on the right to unrestricted intellectual enquiry and freedom of\nexpression on all subjects, including religion.\n\nGroups who held such controversial views were unprecedented in Scottish\ncultural history. Scotland was overwhelmingly Christian and Protestant.\nCalvinist Presbyterianism represented the dominant strain of Scottish\nreligiosity. It underpinned the Church of Scotland, established by law to\nprotect the nation\u2019s moral and spiritual welfare, and forged a distinctive\nreligious culture that set Scotland apart from its southern Anglican\nneighbour. So pivotal was Calvinist Presbyterianism to the national identity\nof most Scots that, as Colin Kidd argued in Unions and Unionisms (2010):\n\u2018Until the 1920s religion was unquestionably the central issue of division\nbetween Scots and English within the Union.\u2019\n\nCalvinism was also shared by many other denominations outwith the\necclesiastical establishment. From May 1843, this included the Free Church of\nScotland, which was born of the \u2018Great Disruption\u2019 of the Church of Scotland,\nwhen more than a third of the latter\u2019s ministry left in protest at state\nencroachments on its spiritual independence. Smaller Christian groups,\nincluding Episcopalians and Catholics (whose numbers would expand\nsignificantly with Irish immigration in the latter half of the century), did\nnot share the dominant Calvinism, and there were also minority Jewish\ncommunities. Yet the emergence of communities of freethinkers, who felt that\nthey could not \u2018conscientiously\u2019 subscribe to any existing religious group,\nwere very much a novel feature in the landscape of belief.\n\nThis is not to say that disbelief in the Judeo-Christian God had been entirely\nunheard of in Scottish society. Faith, then as now, was rarely static\nthroughout a person\u2019s life, and biographies, letters, spiritual diaries,\nconversion narratives and poems reveal that Scots across the centuries have\nexperienced periods of doubt or loss of faith. Nor were more radical forms of\ndisbelief entirely new. During the previous century, the age of the Scottish\nEnlightenment, the celebrated philosopher and historian David Hume (1711-76)\nhad acquired a notorious reputation for \u2018infidelism\u2019. His philosophical\nscepticism denied the possibility of any certain knowledge of God\u2019s existence\nand he had published highly provocative critiques of miracles, the soul\u2019s\nimmortality and the distinctiveness of Christianity in global religious\nhistory. Scottish freethinkers themselves were conscious of Hume\u2019s legacy.\nSpeaking at his trial in December 1843, Finlay reflected on the irony of his\nimprisonment in Calton Jail, just a few minutes\u2019 walk from Hume\u2019s grand\nmausoleum: \u2018I thought it strange to be confined for my infidelity, in a prison\nclose by the walls of which stands a splendid monument in memory of the\ncelebrated Infidel ... David Hume.\u2019\n\nYet there were radical differences between the modern unbelief of figures such\nas Finlay and the Humean scepticism that had raised eyebrows, but not the arm\nof the law, during the Scottish Enlightenment. What set the radical\n\u2018conscientious unbelievers\u2019 of the early 19th century apart from their 18th-\ncentury predecessors? How far did they succeed in changing opinions over the\nright to freedom of expression on religious matters? And what became of Finlay\nand his fellow freethinkers?\n\nFirst of all, the new type of unbeliever tended to come from the middling or\nlower ranks of Scottish society. Many were skilled artisans, apprentices or\nowners of small shops, and some belonged to less lucrative professions,\nincluding weavers and factory workers. By contrast, notorious freethinkers of\nthe previous century, such as Hume, had belonged to the intellectual and\nscholarly elite. For leading figures in Church and State, it was another\nmatter altogether for radical freethinking ideas to be circulating more widely\namong the people. \u2018Popular unbelief\u2019 summoned the terrifying spectre of the\nFrench Revolution of 1789 and the radical de-Christianisation campaign of the\nReign of Terror. To members of the civic and ecclesiastic establishment,\npopular unbelief was inseparable from the dangerous threat of republicanism,\nviolence and radical social upheaval.\n\nSecondly, 19th-century freethinking groups tended to eschew the philosophical\nscepticism of Hume. Rather than stressing the limits of humankind\u2019s ability to\ndefinitively determine anything about the nature and existence of God, they\nfavoured deism or atheism and were thus more attracted to the bold writings of\nFrench Enlightenment philosophes such as the materialist Baron d\u2019Holbach.\nThese new unbelievers were also forging increasingly visible and organised\ncommunities. Three crucial developments were pivotal to this process: radical\nnewspapers, the emergence of substantial freethinking societies, and\nfreethinking bookshops.\n\nPortrait of Richard Carlile (1790-1843) by unknown artist. Courtesy the\nNational Portrait Gallery, London\n\nThe Republican newspaper played a central role in bringing Scotland\u2019s\nfreethinkers together. Launched in London in August 1819, and dedicated to the\ndestruction of \u2018kingcraft\u2019 and \u2018priestcraft\u2019, its pages forged a sense of\ncommunity for freethinkers across Britain. Many were moved by the plight of\nthe Republican\u2019s bold editor, Richard Carlile. A former tinplate worker,\nCarlile faced charges of blasphemy and sedition in October 1819. He was\nsentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment in Dorchester Gaol and hit with an eye-\nwatering \u00a31,500 fine. Unable to pay such a large sum himself, he was released\nonly in 1825. Year on year, many sympathisers had contributed towards the\npayment of his fine, with lists of subscribers printed in The Republican,\nwhich Carlile continued to edit from prison. The names included men and women\nfrom Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Paisley, Aberdeen, Kirkcaldy and Falkirk. A\nhandful of these Scots identified themselves as \u2018liberal Christians\u2019 who\nopposed Carlile\u2019s prosecution and supported freedom of expression. Yet the\nmajority were fellow unbelievers who agreed with the editor\u2019s critique of\nChristianity. Some listed themselves by name, but others remained anonymous,\nusing tags such as \u2018A Sceptic\u2019, \u2018A Deist\u2019, \u2018A Materialist\u2019 or \u2018An Enemy to\nDevil Manufacturers\u2019.\n\n\u2018Infidel\u2019 parties were arranged by local weavers where controversial\ntheological works were read aloud\n\nSubscribers to Carlile\u2019s fines were among those who founded the freethinking\n\u2018Zetetic\u2019 societies in Edinburgh and Glasgow in the 1820s. Taking their name\nfrom the Greek verb z\u0113tein, meaning to \u2018to seek after\u2019 or \u2018enquire\u2019, they\nprovided new hubs for conscientious unbelievers. The Zetetics met weekly on\nSundays to debate controversial theological and philosophical topics and\nprovided their members with a library. In 1820, the Edinburgh Zetetic Society,\nwhich Finlay joined, rented premises in Potterrow, at the heart of the city\u2019s\nOld Town. By 1822, they were regularly attracting audiences of 300 to 400,\nincluding a small number of women and children. Despite having to restrict\ntheir meetings after a police raid in November that year, they remained active\nuntil at least 1826.\n\nBy the late 1830s, another \u2018Society of Freethinkers\u2019, in all likelihood a\ndescendant of the Zetetics, was active in nearby Blackfriars Street. Glasgow\u2019s\nZetetic Society, established in 1824, also attracted several hundred members.\nBy the 1830s, the group was renting a hall in Nelson Street, south of the\nClyde, where it continued to meet until at least the early 1840s. Although\nScotland\u2019s rapidly expanding cities were home to the most organised and\nsubstantial societies of freethinkers, more informal groups existed elsewhere.\nAs Norman Macleod, a minister in the rural parish of Newmilns in Ayrshire was\nto discover in 1839, \u2018infidel\u2019 parties were being arranged by local weavers\nwhere controversial theological works were read aloud.\n\nA sense of community among unbelievers was also fostered by a handful of\nindividuals who set up freethinking bookshops, reading rooms or lending\nlibraries in Edinburgh and Glasgow. James Affleck, a former grocer and\nfounding member of Edinburgh\u2019s Zetetic Society, opened the nation\u2019s first\nfreethinking bookshop in 1823 in the commercial district of Adam Square, now\nChambers Street. Affleck declared that a central motivation for doing so was\nto \u2018have a better opportunity of coming in contact with liberal-minded men\u2019.\nAffleck\u2019s bookshop proved short-lived. Despite proceeding with caution and\nselling radical literature only to known freethinkers, he was undone by a\npolice spy who posed as a fellow unbeliever for several months. Duped into\nselling the police agent a copy of the highly controversial Theological Works\nof Thomas Paine (1824), Affleck found himself facing trial for selling\nblasphemous works. Three other radical booksellers had already faced blasphemy\ncharges between 1819 and 1820 in the first of such cases since the 1690s.\nRather than stand trial, they had fled the courts and were outlawed in\nabsentia. Affleck chose to face the charges and was found guilty. His books\nwere confiscated and in 1824 he was sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment in\nCalton Jail and ordered to pay a \u00a3100 fine.\n\nOthers, however, emerged to take Affleck\u2019s place. Among the most notable was\nFinlay\u2019s son-in-law, Henry Robinson, a radical publisher and bookseller in\nBrunswick Place in Glasgow\u2019s South Side during the 1830s. By the 1840s, he had\nrelocated to Edinburgh\u2019s Greenside Street, close to Calton Hill. The same day\nthat Finlay was targeted, Robinson\u2019s shop was also raided by the police and\nled to his arrest in Calton Jail. Their cases prompted English freethinkers to\nrally to Edinburgh, including Thomas Paterson, who provocatively established a\n\u2018Blasphemy Depot\u2019 near Robinson\u2019s shop, and Matilda Roalfe, who set up another\nradical bookshop on Nicholson Street, close to the original site of the\nZetetic Society. Both booksellers were also arrested for selling blasphemous\nbooks.\n\nStrikingly, however, these were the last trials for blasphemy in Scottish\nhistory. This turning point in the cultural landscape is especially\nsignificant when we consider that several individuals continued to be\nprosecuted for blasphemy in England between the 1850s and 1920s. Indeed, the\nlast blasphemy trial in England took place in 1977, when the Gay News case of\nWhitehouse v Lemon resulted in a conviction. How, then, did Scotland\u2019s 19th-\ncentury freethinking communities succeed in turning the tide of opinion\nagainst prosecution for circulating \u2018blasphemous\u2019 ideas?\n\nA Street in Old Edinburgh, West Bow(?) (1857) by Henry Duguid. Courtesy\nNational Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh\n\nIn part through sheer persistence. Despite the risks involved, many continued\nto participate in freethinking societies and debates, to run radical\nbookshops, and to pen or purchase controversial publications. Booksellers were\nparticularly vulnerable to blasphemy charges, which concentrated on the\ncirculation of books that denied or ridiculed Christianity or the scriptures.\nYet all known unbelievers faced some degree of risk. Some were ostracised by\nfriends or family, others suffered economic consequences as the loss of\nrespectability depleted their customers, and several faced periodic waves of\nsuppression by the civic authorities. Emotions could run high and strong\nlanguage was not infrequently used by concerned Christians, clerics or civic\nauthorities who wished to put a stop to unbelief. On rare occasions, such\nrhetoric encouraged violent action. Emma Martin, an English freethinker who\nvisited Edinburgh for a lecture tour, discovered this first-hand in 1845.\nMartin\u2019s controversial response to a sermon in Newington\u2019s Free Church led her\nto be stoned by an angry mob, forcing her and her daughter to take shelter at\nRoalfe\u2019s nearby bookshop. By continuing to promote freedom of expression\ndespite the potentially negative consequences, Scotland\u2019s freethinkers ensured\nthat the debate over freedom of expression could not be ignored.\n\nSheer persistence, however, cannot fully explain why blasphemy prosecutions\nfell into disuse after 1843. More significantly, many within the Christian\nmainstream were increasingly sympathetic to unbelievers\u2019 arguments in favour\nof freedom of expression. We\u2019ve already seen that several Christian Scots had\nanonymously contributed to Carlile\u2019s large fine for selling blasphemous books\nand had expressed their distaste at the persecution of opinion. Other\nChristian individuals had made such arguments much earlier. In 1808, the\nnonagenarian John Goldie (1717-1811), a friend of the late poet Robert Burns\n(1759-96) and a man known for his heterodox theological views, opposed\nclergymen who sought to stamp out religious debate. His Conclusive Evidences\nAgainst Atheism (1808) made an ardent appeal for allowing \u2018impartial\ninvestigation\u2019 into religious subjects and opposed the persecution of\nunbelievers for their opinions alone. Goldie stressed that many had exemplary\nmorals, and he asserted that good conduct was far more important than belief.\n\nCorrect opinions were impossible to acquire without \u2018unlimited enquiry, free\ndiscussion, and liberty to publish\u2019\n\nAs the periodic attempts to suppress unbelief through official or unofficial\npersecution make clear, this view was by no means universally shared by\nScottish Christians in the first half of the 19th century. In response,\nfreethinkers mounted a campaign to persuade their contemporaries of the\nvirtues of freedom of expression. During the 1820s, the Zetetic Societies of\nEdinburgh and Glasgow sent petitions to the government to make their case. The\nEdinburgh group declared that the right to free discussion was essential to\nadvancing human knowledge, otherwise \u2018men have no way of detecting error, and\narriving at the truth of any subject; and the boasted freedom we are said to\nenjoy is only an empty name.\u2019 What\u2019s more, they argued, restricting free\ndebate put morality at risk by forcing individuals to hide their true opinions\nand take refuge in hypocritical conformity. A change in law was needed so\nthat, on all subjects, human beings would be \u2018convinced by reasoning, and not\nbe forced by law, as at present, to be hypocrites\u2019.\n\nIn connecting freedom of expression with the pursuit of honest virtue,\nfreethinkers were subtly disputing the common argument that state protection\nof Protestant Christianity was essential for the moral welfare of society. The\nsame theme was picked up in an 1824 petition from the Glasgow Zetetic Society\nthat attracted 420 signatures. The group stressed that good conduct was\ndependent on correct opinions, which were impossible to acquire without\n\u2018unlimited enquiry, free discussion, and liberty to publish whatever may be\ndeemed of consequence in the elucidation of truth.\u2019 Any opinions, they argued,\nthat were not \u2018embodied into actions detrimental to the peace and welfare of\nthe community\u2019 ought to be free from prosecution. Cannily appealing to the\nviews of their audience, they added that it was precisely because religion was\nso important that they should not be \u2018restrained in their researches and the\nexpression of their thoughts on this momentous subject\u2019. What\u2019s more, attempts\nto use the arm of the law to protect Christianity were fundamentally flawed\nand implied that it was \u2018incapable of withstanding opposition without the\nassistance of human laws\u2019.\n\nSimilar arguments were echoed by many Scottish freethinkers in the coming\ndecades. An important refrain was that freedom of expression was fundamental\nto liberty of conscience. Hitting the Protestant establishment where it hurt,\nmany suggested that, by fostering disingenuousness and hypocrisy among\nunbelievers, the Church of Scotland and the civic authorities were no better\nthan inquisitorial Catholics. This claim was made with relish by the Scottish\nAnti-Persecution Union, established by a group of freethinkers in 1843 in the\nwake of the arrests of Robinson and Finlay. Blasphemy legislation, they\ndeclared, contradicted the \u2018great principle of Protestantism, which gives to\nall the right of individual judgment, and professes, therefore to interfere\nwith the conscience of no man.\u2019\n\nBy the 1840s, there were important signs that increasing numbers within the\nScottish Christian mainstream were sympathetic to such arguments. Among those\nto express support was the liberal Tait\u2019s Edinburgh Magazine, which objected\nin 1840 to a government crackdown on radical publications by asserting that\nsuch policies blasphemed the deity by robbing his creatures \u2018in God\u2019s name, of\ntheir most sacred and inalienable right, the right of free thought and free\nspeech\u2019. The unfolding of the last blasphemy trials also indicated that change\nwas in the air. Lord Justice-Clerk John Hope (1794-1858), a stern judge who\nwas eager to see both individuals convicted, was appointed to oversee the\ntrials of Robinson and Paterson. Significantly, however, Hope felt compelled\nto remind the jury that they were not \u2018engaged in a theological discussion\u2019\nover the propriety of blasphemy prosecutions. Rather, they were simply to\ndetermine whether the accused were innocent or guilty of the charges laid\nbefore them. He also attempted to add nuance to the terms of the indictments\nlaid against Robinson and Paterson. Traditionally, blasphemy charges had\napplied to the circulation of any book that either denied or ridiculed\nChristianity or the scriptures. Yet Hope informed the jury that the mocking\ntone of the confiscated books was crucial. Had the works under discussion\noffered \u2018a fair and serious discussion of the truth and authority of the Holy\nScriptures\u2019, he claimed, the booksellers would not have been prosecuted.\n\nHope passed a severe judgment on both Robinson and Paterson, sentencing them\nto 12 and 15 months\u2019 imprisonment. Yet it is striking that even a figure so\nsupportive of their conviction felt obliged to justify the nature of the\nlegislation. To be sure, some Christians agreed with Hope and felt blasphemy\nlaws protected society at large. As the Free Church newspaper The Witness\ndeclared in 1843, there was \u2018both wisdom and humanity in the law\u2019 that had\nconsigned Robinson and Paterson to prison. Yet the wider public response to\nthe trials suggests that the tide was turning. Two weeks later, a crowded\npublic meeting arranged by the Anti-Persecution Union attracted more than\n1,000 freethinkers and Christians. Unconvinced by Hope\u2019s suggestion that the\ntone of the works was significant, the majority agreed to petition the\ngovernment for the abolition of blasphemy laws and the prisoners\u2019 release.\nAmong the Christian thinkers present, one appealed to Jesus\u2019 injunction to\nturn the other cheek, declaring that Christian persecutors did greater harm to\nthe faith than unbelievers. For another Christian attendee, prosecution was\nantithetical to the \u2018spirit of Christianity\u2019.\n\nChristians increasingly felt that open debate was preferable to the legal\nsuppression of freethinkers\n\nThe petition was ultimately unsuccessful. Yet the mid-19th century\nnevertheless marked a decisive turning point in debates over freedom of\nexpression. No further blasphemy prosecutions were heard in Scotland\u2019s High\nCourt. When Finlay was eventually called to stand trial in late December 1843,\nhe was tried only in the Sheriff Court, which could impose a maximum sentence\nof 60 days or a \u00a310 fine. Sheriff George Tait was obliged to follow the\nprecedent of the High Court and impose the maximum penalty, yet even he took\nthe opportunity to praise Finlay\u2019s \u2018very excellent and judicious defence\u2019.\n\nMinority groups of unbelievers remained a presence in Scotland, later leading\nto the establishment of communities such as the Edinburgh Secular Society in\nthe 1860s and proto-humanist ethical societies in Edinburgh and Glasgow in the\n1890s. Yet attitudes towards the toleration of these communities had begun to\nchange by the latter half of the century. Christians within the mainstream\nincreasingly felt that open debate was preferable to the legal suppression of\nfreethinkers. A shared commitment to liberty of conscience and freedom of\nexpression on religious subjects had created an unexpected area of common\nground between freethinkers and many Christians. The debate over blasphemy, in\nwhich emotions ran high, convictions were tested and boundaries pushed, had\ntherefore contributed to the emergence of a more openly pluralistic landscape\nof belief.\n\nAt his trial in 1844, Finlay claimed that his arrest was ironic since a\ncommitment to freedom of conscience ostensibly lay at the root of evangelical\nChristianity. \u2018I thought it very unseemly,\u2019 he explained, \u2018to find myself in\nprison, and treated as a felon by Christians, for merely doing what Christians\nthemselves glory in, and think it their duty to do, that is inviting the\nconsideration of their fellow-creatures to those opinions which they\nconscientiously believe to be well-founded, and conducive to the welfare of\nhuman society.\u2019 Finlay even went so far as to argue that liberty of conscience\nand freedom of discussion on all topics was fundamental to civilisation\nitself. Echoing Hume, he asserted that the progress of civilised society was\nutterly dependent on the right to put \u2018all ... modes of thought to the test of\ncomparison with other modes of thought\u2019 and to use our \u2018two ears for the\npurpose for which they are adapted, to hear on both sides.\u2019 By the latter half\nof the 19th century, most Scots had come to agree.\n\nThe research for this article was funded by the Leverhulme Trust.\n\nHuman rights and justiceReligionProgress and modernity\n\n11 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHistory of technology\n\nWhy America fell for guns\n\nThe US today has extraordinary levels of gun ownership.
