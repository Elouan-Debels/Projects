Understanding more about this\nphenomenon could reveal clues as to how the Universe will end. Credit: Mark\nGarlick / Science Photo Library\n\nThey can also directly measure the current expansion using \u2018standard candles\u2019,\nobjects whose known intrinsic brightness allows us to calculate their\ndistance.\n\nHowever, when the expansion values of the early and late Universe are\ncompared, the two are found to be stubbornly different.\n\nIt was thought that an observational error could be skewing the results.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has spent 30 years observing standard candles, but\nthe telescope\u2019s resolution means nearby stars often overlap in observations,\nwhile cosmic dust confuses the results.\n\nJWST\u2019s infrared eyes see through this dust and its higher resolution means the\ncandles are much clearer.\n\nA previous JWST study in 2023 confirmed that Hubble\u2019s measurements of standard\ncandles known as Type Ia supernovae were correct.\n\nImage of galaxy NGC 5468, 130 million lightyears from Earth, combining data\nfrom the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.

Riess\n(JHU, STScI)\n\nNow this new study has verified the results that Hubble got using Cepheid\nvariable stars (such as those in NGC 5468, above), standard candles used to\ntake measurements closer to Earth.\n\n\"We\u2019ve now spanned the whole range of what Hubble observed, and we can rule\nout a measurement error as the cause of the Hubble tension with very high\nconfidence,\" says Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who\nled the study.\n\n\"What remains is the real and exciting possibility we have misunderstood the\nUniverse. We need to find out if we are missing something on how to connect\nthe beginning of the Universe and the present day.\"\n\nThese 36 galaxies imaged by Hubble play host to both Cepheid variables and\nsupernovae used to measure the Universe\u2019s expansion.

Riess (STScI, JHU)\n\n## Why the Hubble tension is so important\n\nThe Hubble tension, far from causing headaches, is exciting.\n\nA disagreement about something as fundamental as the speed of expansion\nprovides a hope that some big breakthrough to solve it is round the corner.\n\nMaybe it is. But the fact that we call it a \u2018tension\u2019 \u2013 not argument, enormous\nproblem or embarrassment \u2013 reflects that comparing local measurements with the\nearly Universe is hard.\n\nHistory shows that astronomers measuring the expansion have typically been\noverconfident. If that\u2019s happening again, there may be no tension at all.\n\nUntil someone finds an error with our errors, though, we can go on dreaming of\nnew physics.\n\nThis article appeared in the May 2024 issue of BBC Sky at Night Magazine.\n\n## Share this article\n\nEzzy Pearson\n\nScience journalist\n\nEzzy Pearson is the Features Editor of BBC Sky at Night Magazine.
