On Monday, Google\nfinally launched its Find My Device network geared toward locating devices\neven if they're offline.\n\nAlso: Android 15 could bring back a buzzword that was once the talk of the\ntech industry\n\n\"Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices around\nthe world, starting in the US and Canada,\" Google said in a new blog post.\n\"With a new, crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My\nDevice can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items\nquickly and securely.\"\n\nAlthough Google already offers a Find My Device setting on Android phones, the\ndevice you're looking for must be powered on and connected for the feature to\nwork. The new Find My Device network is designed to use Bluetooth to track\ndown missing phones and other devices that are disconnected from a Wi-Fi or\ncellular network.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nA Powered Off Finding feature would let each device store beacons in its\nBluetooth controller's memory, letting the network see any supported device\neven if it's not connected.\n\nIn its blog post, Google described five ways Android users can tap into the\nnew Find My Device network. You can locate any compatible Android phone or\ntablet by ringing it or viewing its location on a map. The network will find\nany supported device even if it's offline. And it will track down any Pixel 8\nor Pixel 8 Pro phone even if it's powered off or the battery is depleted.\n\nAlso: The best Bluetooth trackers of 2024\n\nStarting in May, you'll be able to use the Find My Device app to locate items\nlike keys or luggage via Bluetooth tracker tags made by Chipolo and Pebblebee.\nDesigned especially for the new network, the tags will send you unknown\ntracker alerts across Android and iOS devices to warn you about any unwanted\ntracking.\n\nAlso launching in May will be a Find nearby button that will help you pinpoint\nan object that may be hiding right next to you. By using the upcoming\nBluetooth tags, you'll be able to hunt down nearby objects like a wallet or\nkeys.\n\nNext, the Find My Device app will show you a missing phone or other item in\nrelation to your home Nest devices, providing you with a reference point.\n\nAnd finally, you'll be able to share a device or accessory so that other\npeople can track it as well.\n\nAlso: How to enable Find My Device on your Android phone (and why you should)\n\nGoogle announced the Find My Device network in September 2023, but delayed its\nrollout over fears that the technology could be misused by people armed with\nBluetooth trackers, such as Apple's AirTags, to track and stalk other people.\nApple's upcoming iOS 17.5 (now in beta testing) reportedly contains the\nnecessary security protections to prevent this type of abuse, paving the way\nfor Google to finally launch the network.\n\nSo, which Android phones will be able to use the new Find My network? Though\nonly the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro can be found even if they're powered off, the\nnetwork will work with any phone running Android 9 or higher.\n\nAnd how secure and private will your devices been on this new network? \"Multi-\nlayered protections built into the Find My Device network help keep you safe\nand your personal information private, while keeping you in control of the\ndevices connected to the Find My Device network,\" Google said in its post.\n\"This includes end-to-end encryption of location data as well as aggregated\ndevice location reporting, a first-of-its-kind safety feature that provides\nadditional protection against unwanted tracking back to a home or private\nlocation.\"\n\n#### Featured\n\nGoogle finally launches its Find My Device network.
