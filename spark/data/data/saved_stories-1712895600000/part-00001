Notably, seed rounds constituted 40% of the Q1 funding\ntransactions, mirroring the figures from the previous year.\n\nThe Pinpoint Search Group report also highlighted a decline in merger and\nacquisition activity within the cybersecurity market, with the number of deals\ndecreasing from 31 in Q1 2023 to 24 in the most recent quarter.\n\n### Positive Signs Amid the Slowdown\n\nMark Sasson, founder and managing partner at Pinpoint Search Group, said the\nfact that Q1 2024 numbers came in as they did is a good sign.\n\n\u201cThe first quarter of 2023 represented the tail end of an explosive two-year\nperiod of funding for cybersecurity vendors that quickly trended downward in\nparallel with the broader economic downturn,\u201d Sasson explained. \u201cThe Q1 2024\nnumbers represent a potential upward trajectory following three quarters of\ndecline.\u201d\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSeed rounds dominated funding transactions throughout 2023. It\u2019s not\nsurprising that the trend is continuing into Q1 2024, Sasson said. \u201cAs many\nlate-stage security vendors failed to adapt to changing market conditions,\ninvestors moved on,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt seems many decided to make low-risk,\nlow-dollar investments into early-stage companies proposing solutions that\naddress the biggest security holes today.\u201d\n\nSeth Spergel, managing partner at Merlin Ventures, said from what he\u2019s seen,\nseed funding has remained strong, and the primary drop-off has been in the\nlater stages. \u201cWhile there is a small dip in seed deals, even as the\nindividual deal sizes get larger, the number of A, B, and especially later\nstage deals has fallen off dramatically,\u201d Spergel said. \u201cI believe some of\nthis is due to a stagnant IPO market.\u201d\n\nWithout IPOs happening, Spergel said, it\u2019s harder to justify an investment in\na late-stage company that does not have an obvious path to exit.\n\n### Confidence in Cybersecurity Innovators\n\nSpergel sees signs that the market is opening. He hopes that the pressure will\nbegin to alleviate over the next six to twelve months.\n\nIn terms of innovation, Spergel pointed out, many of the newest developments\ncome from new companies that are raising their seed rounds, and there the\nmarket remains strong. \u201cGiven the time horizons for a company to raise a\nseries A after a strong seed round, I believe companies raising seed rounds\nnow will be raising their A rounds in a much stronger later-stage market, as\nthey will likely not need to raise for 18 months or so,\u201d he said.\n\nAs far as the market outlook is concerned, Sasson said, it\u2019s too early to\ntell. But his confidence in cybersecurity remains high. \u201cMarch 2024 was a\nparticularly encouraging month, with vendors exceeding $1 billion in funding\nfor the first time in thirteen months,\u201d Sasson said. \u201cHowever, we really need\nto see how funding shapes up in the next few quarters to determine if we saw a\ntemporary spike versus a stabilizing trend.\u201d\n\nPeople with bad intentions and nation-state competition and conflict will\ncompel all parties to continue innovating, investing in, and purchasing modern\nsecurity solutions, Sasson said.\n\nStrategically, investors are expected to continue to track new technology\ninnovations and how threat actors might exploit them. \u201cFrom there, they\u2019ll\ninvest in founders that present a credible solution,\u201d Sasson said. \u201cA few\nsegments of security I\u2019ll be watching with interest will be Web3 and\nblockchain, firmware and supply chain, critical infrastructure, and, of\ncourse, AI model security.\u201d\n\nSpergel said companies that can drive reductions in cost and complexity for\nbuyers will be the winners. \u201cNovel approaches to the market that rethink old\nways of doing things and improve both service levels and cost efficiencies\nbecome even more critical as organizations struggle with both budgets and\nfinding qualified staff,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto credit: Jakub \u017berdzicki on Unsplash\n\nRecent Articles By Author\n\n  * Insider Threats Surge Amid Growing Foreign Interference\n  * 10 Million Devices Were Infected by Data-Stealing Malware in 2023\n  * CISA Unveils Critical Infrastructure Reporting Rule\n\nMore from Nathan Eddy\n\nApril 11, 2024April 11, 2024 Nathan Eddy cybersecurity funding, Finances,\nInvestment, IPO, Pinpoint Search Group, venture-capital\n\n  * \u2190 Rooting out Risky SCCM Configs with Misconfiguration Manager\n\n#### Nathan Eddy\n\nNathan Eddy is a Berlin-based filmmaker and freelance journalist specializing\nin enterprise IT and security issues, health care IT and architecture.\n\nnathan-eddy has 248 posts and counting.See all posts by nathan-eddy\n\n### Techstrong TV\n\nClick full-screen to enable volume control\n\nWatch latest episodes and shows\n\n### Upcoming Webinars\n\n### Podcast\n\n### Press Releases\n\n#### GoPlus\u2019s Latest Report Highlights How Blockchain Communities Are\nLeveraging Critical API Security Data To Mitigate Web3 Threats\n\n#### C2A Security\u2019s EVSec Risk Management and Automation Platform Gains\nTraction in Automotive Industry as Companies Seek to Efficiently Meet\nRegulatory Requirements\n\n#### Zama Raises $73M in Series A Lead by Multicoin Capital and Protocol Labs\nto Commercialize Fully Homomorphic Encryption\n\n#### RSM US Deploys Stellar Cyber Open XDR Platform to Secure Clients\n\n#### ThreatHunter.ai Halts Hundreds of Attacks in the past 48 hours: Combating\nRansomware and Nation-State Cyber Threats Head-On\n\n### Subscribe to our Newsletters\n\n### Most Read on the Boulevard\n\nHere Comes the US GDPR: APRA, the American Privacy Rights Act\n\n10 Million Devices Were Infected by Data-Stealing Malware in 2023\n\nBarracuda Report Provides Insight into Cybersecurity Threat Severity Levels\n\nWatch This?
