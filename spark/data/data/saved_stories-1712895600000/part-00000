The set came with a variety of gear options like planetary gear,\nworm gear, and clutch capsules. You could use chain drives and propellers. A\nlot of the parts were water-resistant, and part of the toy\u2019s shtik was that\nyou could make boats out of it with pontoons keeping most of the robot out of\nthe water.\n\nHex connectors printed by ericd3\n\nCapsela\u2019s sets were relatively simple, with only DC motors to make things\nmove. However, as the product found success, the company built increasingly\nlarger and more complicated sets with greater capabilities. For instance, in\n\u201987 they released the Robotic Workshop that included an IR remote that could\nbe configured with a Commodore 64. Later on the Capsela Voice Command 6000 was\nreleased, featuring a microcontroller that could understand 8 verbal commands\nas well as interpret IR signals within 25 feet.\n\nI never got any of those fancy sets, but I still found a lot to do with the\nbasic set my parents bought me for Christmas. The unique architecture of the\nset was both boon and bane\u2013it certainly was a striking set, in terms of its\nappearance. However, there were only so many ways you could those spheres\ntogether. Also, if you weren\u2019t making a boat the pontoons were fairly useless,\nwith the most clever solution being to use one as a wheel substitute.\n\nThe thing that really did it for me, other than hacking out reconfigurable\nboats in my bathtub, was being able to see everything. All the gearboxes could\nbe seen though the clear plastic. How many nerds learned about mechanical\nengineering by peering through Capsela spheres?\n\nAs with all things, Capsela had its peak and faded away. The product was\nlicensed to a number of new manufacturers, but never found the same success.\nThey tried focusing on the educational market but no dice.\n\nNevertheless, the product has retained a degree of nostalgia for those of us\nwho outgrew it. A few years ago, software developer [Jos\u00e9 Romaniello]\ndescribed how the toy set him on a path toward being an engineer. He started a\nHacker News thread that engaged a bunch of fans in a nerdfest about how great\nthe toy was and how one might 3D print new pieces. Not much was done in the\n3DP world that I have seen, other than re-creating Capsela\u2019s hex connectors\nand that sort of thing.\n\n### It\u2019s Baaaaack....\n\n\u201cIf they can remake Beauty and the Beast they can bring back Capsela\u201d, is how\nI\u2019m assuming the thought process went. Sure enough, a company emerged with a\nredesigned version of the set, available over the internet and in brick and\nmortar stores. Put out by a shell company called the Unitrust Development\nCompany, the product has been renamed IQ Key.\n\nThe new kits seem very similar to those classic sets from the 80s, other than\nsuperficial changes in the product\u2019s appearance \u2014 the faceted geography of the\npontoons and capsules suggest a refreshed product \u2014 it looks pretty much the\nsame. The battery pack (slash switch) has also been redesigned, and looks like\nit may have an IR receiver built in. The company has also redesigned those\nhexagonal connectors and now they are circular and bayonet into place.\n\nIs it the same old Capsela we knew and loved? Maybe, maybe not, but there\u2019s\nonly one way to find out: to hack the hell out of it!\n\n[Main image source: Capsela model with swivel by Adrian J.

My parents found some for me as only \u201cengineering-like\u201d toys\npleased me :D\n\nHowever many fond memories I have with those, it was pretty frequently a\nsource of hassle to use. Anyone who had stuck two flat peices of lego together\nthat resorted to a knife to part them will understand me. Those pesky hex\nconnectors had the very bad habit of getting stuck and nearly impossible to\nremove. Mine had teeth bites all over the place from me trying to remove\nthose. Moreover, the battery packs had long leads without any kind of stress\nreleif. I lost count of how many broke due to a wire breaking at its root.\n\nBut heh, still had a lot of fun with those, especially with the crappy IR\nremote, which proved to be the best battery pack of all (stress releif FTW !)\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Being located in the midwest\nwith major agricultural equipment. I think we could sell manufacturers on\nfinancially supporting stem activities in our schools. Perhaps 3D printers\ncould be used to redesign the units which caused you the most grief in France.\nPlease use Continuous Improvement in the subject line to avoid my filters\njfnennig@gmail.com\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  5.

In my single digits I would break apart my toys to see how they worked to\nmy parents\u2019 frustration. They bought me a transparent toy train so I could see\nthe moving gears in hopes I wouldn\u2019t break it. No dice. I didn\u2019t just want to\nunderstand how things worked, I wanted to rework them. Capsela was a toy I\ncouldn\u2019t break (I remember trying) but could reconfigure into many different\nworking machines. So glad to be reminded of it.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  7.

Capsela was one of my favorite toys when I was in my late single\ndigits, but I ran into some of the same issues with it that [Tuetuopay] lists\nabove. It didn\u2019t take long (a year or two) for the set I had to have most of\nits parts either lost or broken. I ended up moving on to Erector (as Meccano\nwas known in the US) and Lego, and learned a lot while having fun with both of\nthose, especially the Lego. I don\u2019t really miss Capsela, and the new ones look\npretty lame. They should concentrate more on the engineering blocks (okay,\n\u201cspheres\u201d) with gears, motors, transmissions, and the like. It looks like they\nare trying too hard to be something that Capsela never really was, a modeling\ntoy.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  10. Madox says:\n\nSeptember 15, 2017 at 3:21 pm\n\nCapsela was truly amazing in its simplicity and the range of vehicles and\ncontraptions you could build with it. From cars, tanks to \u201cboats\u201d with the\nattachable floats, it was great fun and probably what made me love\nengineering.\n\nUnfortunately I found out about the demise and unavailability of the kits a\nfew years ago, the IQ Key replacement was out but the website was unavailable\n(exceeded data allowance, ha!) and trying to find it in Australia would have\nbeen futile.\n\nAny other great simple kits for kids people might recommend? Age 3-7.\nAdmittedly I played with Capsela probably 7-11.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  11.

Meccano second, but first in beautiful gear sets until tri\nshaft plastic. Real Erector sets died a couple years after A.C. Gilbert did.\nBoth still the sturdiest construction toy/development tool. Spin Master trying\nat least to keep Erector/Meccano names meaningful. Long over due Erector\n/Meccano robotics entry Meccanoid but slid back to not quite \u2018MAX\u201d. Meccanoid\nhas a limited programmabilit thru smart device. LEGO still busting up the\nschool bots scene. Expensive to ridiculous. Capsela was too expensive. Awkward\nand limited to build with. Fragile. Reminded me of DC-3 Erector Gabriel\nmotors. Like to snap and break under no stress whatsoever. And that was just\nassembly. Models dont really look like anything. Only a few parts were\nwaterproof and even those barely. Wasn\u2019t uncommon to get rust in drive modules\nand water in others. Wires liked to corrode to pretty green after building one\nof their water models. Condensation was not accounted for. Milton Bradley\nRobotix slightly better than capsela. Robotix continues on too but not a MB\nproduct anymore. K\u2019nex would be just below LEGO. They have a robot entry with\nSTEM programming environment now as well.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  18.
