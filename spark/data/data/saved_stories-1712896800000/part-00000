Switch the site to dark mode for best results.\n\n### Lucy in the skAI with diamonds\n\nA vision came to us in a dream \u2014 and certainly not from any nameable person \u2014\non the current state of the venture capital-fueled AI and machine learning\nindustry. We asked around and several others who work in the field concurred\nwith this assessment.\n\nGenerative AI is famous for \u201challucinating\u201d made-up answers with wrong facts.\nThese are crippling to the credibility of AI-driven products.\n\nThe bad news is that the hallucinations are not decreasing. In fact, the\nhallucinations are getting worse.\n\nLarge language models work by generating output based on what tokens\nstatistically follow from other tokens. They are extremely capable\nautocompletes.\n\nAll output from a LLM is a \u201challucination\u201d \u2014 generated from the latent space\nbetween the training data. LLMs are machines for generating convincing-\nsounding nonsense \u2014 \u201cfacts\u201d are not a type of data in LLMs.\n\nBut if your input contains mostly facts, then the output has a better chance\nof not being just nonsense.\n\nUnfortunately, the venture-capital-funded AI industry runs on the promise of\nreplacing humans with a very large shell script \u2014 including in areas where\ndetails matter. If the AI\u2019s output is just plausible nonsense, that\u2019s a\nproblem. So the hallucination issue is causing a slight panic among AI company\nleadership.\n\nMore unfortunately, the AI industry has run out of training data that isn\u2019t\ntainted with previous AI output. So they\u2019re seriously considering doing the\nstupidest thing possible: training AIs on the output of other AIs. This is\nalready well known to make the models collapse into gibberish. [WSJ, archive]\n\nAI companies are starting to talk up \u201cemergent capabilities\u201d again \u2014 where an\nAI suddenly becomes useful for things it wasn\u2019t developed for, like\ntranslating languages it wasn\u2019t trained on. You know \u2014 magic.\n\nEvery claim ever made of \u201cemergent capabilities\u201d has turned out to be an\nirreproducible coincidence or data that the model was in fact trained on.\nMagic doesn\u2019t happen. [Stanford, 2023]\n\nThe current workaround in AI is to hire fresh master\u2019s graduates or PhDs to\ntry to fix the hallucinations. The companies try to underpay the fresh grads\non the promise of future wealth \u2014 or at least a high-status position in the AI\ndoomsday cult. OpenAI is notoriously high on the cultish workplace scale, for\nexample, not understanding why anyone would want to work there if they weren\u2019t\ntrue believers.\n\nIf you have a degree with machine learning in it, gouge them for every penny\nyou can while the gouging is good.\n\nRemember when AI had proper hallucinations? Eyeballs! Spurious dogs! [Fast\nCompany, 2015]\n\n### When the money runs out\n\nThere is enough money floating around in tech VC to fuel the current AI hype\nfor another couple of years. There are hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014\nfamily offices, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds \u2014 that are desperate to\nfind returns.\n\nBut in AI in particular, the money and the patience are running out \u2014 because\nthe systems don\u2019t have a path to profitable functionality.\n\nStability AI raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation. By October 2023,\nthey had $4 million cash left \u2014 and couldn\u2019t get more because their investors\nwere no longer interested in setting money on fire. At one stage, Stability\nran out of money for their AWS cloud computing bill. [Forbes, archive]\n\nEd Zitron gives the present AI venture capital bubble three more quarters\n(nine months), which would take it through to the end of the year. The gossip\nconcurs with Ed on this likely lasting another three quarters. There should be\nat least one more wave of massive overhiring. [Ed Zitron]\n\nCompare AI to bitcoin, which keeps coming back like a bad Ponzi. It\u2019s true, as\nKeynes says, that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay\nsolvent. Crypto is a pretty good counterexample to the efficient market\nhypothesis. But AI doesn\u2019t have the Ponzi-like structure of crypto \u2014 there\u2019s\nno path to getting rich for free for the common degen that would sustain it\nthat far beyond all reason.\n\nAI stocks are what\u2019s holding up the S&P 500 this year. This means that when\nthe AI VC bubble pops, tech will crash.\n\nWhenever the NASDAQ catches a cold, bitcoin catches COVID \u2014 so we should\nexpect crypto to go through the floor in turn.\n\n### AI will soon be doing reasoning! Well, \u2018reasoning\u2019\n\nFinancial Times headline, Thursday 11 April: \u201cOpenAI and Meta ready new AI\nmodels capable of \u2018reasoning\u2019\u201d. Huge if true! [FT, archive]\n\nThis is an awesome story that the FT somehow ran without an editor reading it\nfrom the beginning through to the end. You can watch as the splashy headline\nclaim slowly decays to nothing:\n\n  * Headline: AI models capable of \u2018reasoning\u2019 are nearly ready. According to the subheading, they\u2019ll come out this year!\n  * First paragraph: well, they\u2019re not ready as such, but OpenAI and Facebook are \u201con the brink\u201d of releasing a reasoning engine \u2014 trust us, bro.\n  * Fourth paragraph: the companies haven\u2019t actually figured out yet how to do reasoning. But \u201cWe are hard at work in figuring out how to get these models not just to talk, but actually to reason, to plan ... to have memory.\u201d Now, you might think they\u2019ve been claiming to be hard at work on all of these for the past several years.\n  * Fifth paragraph: it\u2019ll totally \u201cshow progress,\u201d guys. It\u2019s \u201cjust starting to scratch the surface on the ability that these models have to reason\u201d \u2014 that is, the models don\u2019t actually do this.\n  * Sixth paragraph: current systems are still \u201cpretty narrow\u201d \u2014 that is, the models don\u2019t actually do this.\n  * Thirteenth paragraph, halfway down: Yann LeCun of Facebook admits that reasoning is a \u201cbig missing piece\u201d \u2014 not only do the models not do it, the companies don\u2019t know how to do it.\n  * Fourteenth paragraph: AI will one day give us such hitherto-unknown applications as journey planners.\n  * Seventeenth paragraph: \u201cI think over time ... we\u2019ll see the models go toward longer, kind of more complex tasks,\u201d says Brad Lightcap of Facebook.\n\nIn the final paragraph, LeCun warns us:\n\n> \u201cWe will be talking to these AI assistants all the time,\u201d LeCun said. \u201cOur\n> entire digital diet will be mediated by AI systems.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see that other than as a threat.\n\n### His lips are moving\n\nLie detectors don\u2019t exist, but there\u2019s no sucker like a rich sucker. Speech\nCraft Analytics managed to get a promotional flyer printed in the FT for its\npurported voice stress analysers.\n\nVoice stress analysis is complete and utter pseudoscience. It doesn\u2019t exist.\nIt doesn\u2019t work. Fabulous results are regularly claimed and never reproduced.\nAnyone trying to sell you voice stress analysis is a crook and a con man.\n\nBut lie detectors are such a desirable product that merely being a known fraud\nwon\u2019t stop anyone from buying them.\n\nThe FT story markets this to professional investors and securities analysts \u2014\nthey claim that they can tell when a CEO is lying in an earnings call.\n\nHow do they do this? It\u2019s uh, AI! Totally not handwaving, magic or\npseudoscience.\n\nThe use case they don\u2019t name but obviously imply is, of course, to use this\nnigh-magical gadget on your own employees \u2014 whether it works or not. The\narticle even admits that this sort of claimed AI use case risks becoming an\nengine for racism laundering. [FT, archive]\n\n### But consider: everyone involved is in dire need of leashing\n\nFor anyone who doubts that AI is precisely the same rubbish as blockchain, we\npresent to you: the AI UNLEASHED SUMMIT! [AI Unleashed Summit, archive]\n\nThis amazing event ran in September 2023. The \u201cExponential Ai strategies\u201d were\npromises to teach you how to do prompt engineering.\n\n\u201cExperience the ultimate skill mastery like being plugged into a Matrix-like\nmachine!\u201d \u2014 someone who\u2019s totally watched The Matrix.\n\nThe promotional trailer video looks like a parody because it appears largely\nto be stock footage. [YouTube]\n\n### Impromptu engineering\n\nA card game developer told PC Gamer how it paid an \u201cAI artist\u201d $90,000 to\ngenerate card art \u2014 because \u201cno one comes close to the quality he delivers.\u201d\nThe \u201cartist,\u201d who totally exists, isn\u2019t on social media. The cards are generic\nAI ripoffs of well-known collectible card games but with extra fingers and\nmisplaced limbs and tails. It turns out PC Gamer was tricked into running a\npromotional story on an NFT offering \u2014 in 2024. [PC Gamer, archive]\n\nWhere is GPT-5 getting fresh training data? It looks like it\u2019ll be getting a\nlot of valuable new authentic human interactions from honeypot sites designed\nto waste the time of spammy web crawlers. [NANOG]\n\nBaldur Bjarnason: \u201cTech punditry keeps harping on the notion that nobody has\never successfully banned \u2018scientific progress\u2019, but LLMs and generative models\nare not \u2018progress\u2019. They\u2019re products and we ban those all the time.\u201d [blog\npost]\n\nYour subscriptions keep this site going.
