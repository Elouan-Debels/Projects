You can find a transcript there, or you\ncould read Zvi's notes. And if you want even more reactions than mine or\nZvi\u2019s, try feeding the transcript into one of the chatbots and ask for\ncommentary from The RamBam, or whoever.\n\nHaidt says,\n\n> The reason why I\u2019m so concerned about screen time is, first and foremost,\n> the opportunity cost. This is an odd thing about my book. People might\n> expect it to be about social media is bad and screens are bad, but half of\n> it is about childhood. What is childhood? How does it work? And how\n> important play is.\n\nTyler says,\n\n> At Emergent Ventures, we support many teenagers, young women. Many of them\n> not 13 years old, but very often 16 to 19 years old. They\u2019re doing science.\n> They\u2019re remarkably smart. They get in touch with their collaborations and\n> with each other using social media. They exchange information. They\u2019re doing\n> phenomenally well. They\u2019re an incredible generation, smarter, more dynamic,\n> probably more productive than any other scientific generation ever, and\n> that\u2019s because of social media. Now, you might think the costs outweigh\n> that, but there\u2019s no mention in your book of the benefits that I can see.\n\nHaidt\u2019s response: Internet good, social media bad. Don\u2019t confuse the two.\n\nTyler gives a ton of pushback to Haidt. Haidt tries to avoid endorsing\ngovernment intervention in children\u2019s use of media, but he does endorse having\ngovernment pressure social media companies into trying to deter use by young\npeople.\n\nI think that commentators are getting too hung up on Haidt the statistical\nresearcher. If you want to challenge his evidence that smart phones are a\nproblem, then you can find lots of \u201cgotchas.\u201d But if you agree that children\ntoday are too supervised and too much indoors, then you should be siding with\nHaidt, not nitpicking him.\n\nI, too, don\u2019t like the trends in childhood. But the worst trends are\ndemographic, including the decline in two-parent families and the decline in\nlarge families. I am skeptical that social media regulation is a useful point\nof intervention to make a big positive difference in childhood.\n\nIf I could push a button to change culture, I would try to induce better\nchildhood experiences. For boys, I advocate physical play, play outdoors, and\ngroups that organize themselves without adult supervision. That is what I\nremember enjoying as a boy, and it is what Joyce Benenson says is most\nnatural.\n\nWhat about for girls? My daughters seemed to enjoy getting together with\nfriends, making up plays, and acting in those plays. They turned out well.\n\nI probably end up closer to Tyler\u2019s hands-off approach to social media. But my\ndaughters grew up before social media took off. Perhaps if I had an eleven-\nyear-old daughter today I would be more in favor of regulation.\n\nI do know that in my high school teaching days I detected a sharp drop in\nmaturity and self-confidence between the seniors who graduated in 2002 and\nthose who graduated in 2014-2016. So I am not ready to dismiss completely\nHaidt\u2019s inclination to attribute this to smart phones and social media.\n\nShare\n\nsubstacks referenced above:\n\n@\n\nDon't Worry About the Vase\n\nOn the 2nd CWT with Jonathan Haidt\n\nIt was clear within the first ten minutes this would be a rich thread to draw\nfrom. In my childhood and education roundups, and of course with my own kids,\nI have been dealing with the issues Haidt talks about in his new book, The\nAnxious Generation. Ideally I\u2019d also have read the book, but perfect as enemy\nof the good and all that...\n\nRead more\n\n4 days ago \u00b7 8 likes \u00b7 3 comments \u00b7 Zvi Mowshowitz\n\n23 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n23\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Cowen Argues with Haidt\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n41\n\nShare\n\n41 Comments\n\nHandle10 hrs agoCowen, \"Let me offer a representative counterexample which is\na set whose members are some of the most exceptionally gifted young people in\nthe whole world, who possess the extraordinarily rare mix of attributes that\nmake them highly likely to successfully lead cutting edge projects to\ncompletion, as defined by me, since I personally selected them on that basis,\nand literally wrote a whole book on how to scout for elite talent.\"Come on\nman, you've got to be kidding me with this.Expand full commentLike\n(13)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies\n\nScott GibbTrim to Truth10 hrs agoLiked by Arnold KlingSmart phones and social\nmedia are evil\u2014a necessary evil. I was the last person to get a smartphone\nphone, and before that, even refused to text on a dumb phone, but it is very\ndifficult to live in this world without a smartphone or texting. It is too\nawkward and inefficient.I knew that being on Facebook and having a smartphone\nwould cause me enormous distractions, so I quit Facebook before getting a\nsmartphone phone.My oldest child hates smartphones and the internet because\nthey take away from me being with her.For years after getting a smartphone, I\nkept all apps off my phone, but I now have the Substack app on my phone. Its\nlittle push notifications that vibrate my wrist and pocket are a great source\nof \u201cdistraction and connectedness.\u201dOver the past decade I have quit all social\nmedia, including Gmail and LinkedIn; I despise YouTube, and Google, and avoid\nthem as much as possible. I am a \u201cpurist,\u201d as much as I can be.But as you\nknow, I do Substack. In My Tribe and other Substacks like yours are huge\n\u201cdistractions.\u201d I occasionally delete the Substack app, and free myself of\nthem for a day or two, but chatting with other Substackers is too fun. I\ndownload it again. Posting comments is too fun. Reading your posts, too\neducational. I know I should not be starting my day with Substack. It\u2019s sets\npoor tone for the day.How should I start my day?\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/scottgibb/p/how-shall-i-start-my-\nday?r=nb3bl&utm_medium=iosNot on Substack as I am doing right now.My kids will\nnot be getting smartphones until they turn 18. They don\u2019t attend and will\nnever attend a public K-12 school as long as I\u2019m alive. Public schools have\nmany problems, cell phone and social media being two of many.Laptops with\ninternet are evil too. \u201cSome people\u201d wake up, sit down at the breakfast table\nwith their bowl of oatmeal and silently read the news on their laptop rather\nthan participate in breakfast table conversation. \u201cThey\u201d also sneak off to the\nback room and quietly stream, rather than watch the family movie.Once, one\nmember of the family starts down this path, it pushes the others to do the\nsame.People want to connect either in person or online. If some family members\nare online, then the others in the room or house are alone\u2014sort of\nabandoned.What is the solution? Discipline. Strict rules of internet conduct\nimplemented at the family level. I myself need to implement these rules for\nmyself because I am this biggest abuser.For public schools, the solution is to\n\u201cget rid of public schools.\u201dFor public policy, I have nothing to contribute\nother than \u201cleave us alone.\u201dFor my own family, I am working towards moving us\nmore outside, to be more connected with our neighbors and community.I\u2019m an\nadvocate for children going outside and playing. I want to live in a\nneighborhood where there is lots of outdoor play, and many in person book\nclubs.I want In My Tribe to be in person in my neighborhood. We need more walk\nand talks.Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies\n\n39 more comments...\n\nThe Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\nWhy don't more women use it?\n\nSep 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n111\n\nI Condemn. . .But\n\nThe worst form of evil\n\nOct 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Condemn. . .But\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n80\n\nAssimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\nWe have not done it well\n\nMay 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n61\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arnold Kling\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
