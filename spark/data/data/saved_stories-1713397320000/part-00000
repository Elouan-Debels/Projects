Like\nmany European nations, Italy faces a demographic shift with an ageing\npopulation. The Digital Nomad Visa allows them to tap into a pool of highly\nskilled, often young, professionals.\n\nThese individuals bring fresh perspectives, entrepreneurial spirit, and in-\ndemand skill sets to the Italian economy, which are beneficial in specific\nsectors like tech, marketing, and design, where Italy might be looking to\nbridge a talent gap.\n\nIf you have any questions about UK immigration, our team is happy to assist.\n\n## Who Can Apply?\n\nThe specific eligibility criteria for the Italian Digital Nomad Visa are yet\nto be disclosed. Based on recent announcements, it\u2019s expected to be open to\nnon-EU/EEA citizens with high-skilled remote jobs. Italy\u2019s new nomad visa\nminimum income requirement means prospective applicants must make more than\nthree times the amount that exempts them from Italian healthcare costs,\nroughly \u20ac28,000 per year. Freelancers, self-employed persons and employees of\ncompanies located outside Italy are likely to qualify.\n\nWith a successful application, digital nomads can expect to enjoy a year-long\nstay in Italy, with the potential for renewal. On top of the income\nrequirement, Italy\u2019s digital nomad visa also requires health insurance for\nyour whole stay, proof you have somewhere to live in Italy, and at least six\nmonths of remote work experience elsewhere. You can apply at an Italian\nconsulate in your home country with an employer declaration, and dependant\napplications may be accepted.\n\nAt this stage, Italy will follow a similar eligibility to other European\ncountry\u2019s requirements for the Digital Nomad Visa.\n\n## A Gateway to Permanent Residency\n\nDigital nomads aren\u2019t simply remote workers; they\u2019re often hidden tourists.\nThey contribute to the local economy by renting apartments, co-working spaces\nand frequenting cafes and restaurants. This injection of spending can\nrevitalise local businesses, especially in smaller towns and villages seeking\nto attract a younger demographic.\n\nMany Digital Nomad Visas, like those offered by Portugal and Spain, often act\nas a stepping stone to permanent residency. While details of the Italian\nprogram are still emerging, successful digital nomads could use this visa to\npermanently establish themselves in the country, creating a more stable and\nintegrated addition to the Italian workforce and tax base.\n\n## The Future of Remote Work\n\nItaly\u2019s embrace of the digital nomad trend reflects a broader shift in the\ngeneral workforce. As technology allows for greater flexibility, more and more\npeople are choosing location-independent careers. Countries are recognising\nthis shift and adapting their immigration policies to attract this skilled and\nmobile workforce.\n\nWhile specifics of the Italian Digital Nomad Visa are still emerging, IAS is\ncommitted to bringing you the latest immigration news.

Our candidates were\nunable to leave the Phillipines because IAS did not notify us or the\ncandidates of the exit requirements. When we complained about their service\nIAS told us they had completed the UK Immigration section correctly and this\nwas their only responsibility. Be very careful when using this company because\nour experience showed they had no knowledge of the exit requirements for\nanother country. Not very helpful when you are expecting staff to arrive and\nthey cant leave their country of residence.\n\n1 month ago\n\nMark D\n\nAdvice was received from Mark Rigby who thoroughly understood the process and\nprovided expert advice.\n\n1 month ago\n\nWe offer immigration advice sessions as face to face appointments at all of\nour UK offices, or via the phone.\n\nAdvice Package\n\nNeed help with an immigration issue?
