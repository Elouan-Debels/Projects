Photograph:\nAndre Pattenden\n\nFilm\n\n# \u2018We\u2019re the last bastion of rental\u2019: the video stores resisting the rise of\nstreaming\n\nCheap DVDs, torrenting and streamers looked to have killed off video rentals.\nBut a group of cinephile shop owners are keeping the flame alive\n\nKyle MacNeill\n\nShare\n\nA man shuffles along a royal blue carpet and props himself up against a\nstacked shelf of videos. Reeling off a list of films, he is handed three\nstore-branded DVD cases. In return? A crisp fiver \u2013 plus his thoughts on South\nKorean horror flicks without any dialogue. This isn\u2019t a sepia-tinged flashback\nfrom the past. Nor is it all just a dream. It is 2024 and the transaction is\ntaking place at Snips Movies, one of the UK\u2019s last video rental stores, tucked\naway in a town in Wirral since 1995. The odd passerby does a double take,\nstaring back at the shop\u2019s welly-green facade to confirm its reality.\n\nSnips\u2019 owner, Dave Wain, is part of a small cast of movie mavericks refusing\nto let video rental fade to black. Alongside Snips, just two other original\nvideo rental stores still stand. There\u2019s TVL Allstar Video in Haverhill,\nopened in 1984, a detached brick video and print shop that\u2019s barely changed in\nthe last 40 years. Then there\u2019s 20th Century Flicks in Bristol, which manager\nDave Taylor says began as a \u201cslightly piratical enterprise knocking out\ndubious copies of ET\u201d, and has a focus on queer and arthouse cinema. Another,\nFor Your Eyes Only in Forest Hill, south London, survived until November last\nyear. A few months earlier, a parked car rolled down a hill and smashed\nthrough the shop window. Stranger Still, this literal block-buster was also a\nsequel \u2013 the exact same thing had happened before. A local fundraiser tried to\nsave the business, but the damage had been done and owner Gulam Charania was\nforced to close after 25 years.\n\n> I have an issue with the word nostalgia. For me it\u2019s about tomorrow\n\nDave Wain, Snips owner\n\nFor the next generation, there\u2019s VideOdyssey, which was opened by journalist\nand Tarantino enthusiast Andy Johnson in Liverpool in 2018, offering an\nimmersive movie experience, VCR hire and an arcade. While the original rental\ncrew may be sceptical of a non-original shop trying to tap into a video\nrevival, it proves that there\u2019s an audience for new stores. Hackney\u2019s film\nemporium \u00dcmit & Son, too, deserves a special mention. While not really dealing\nin video rental any more, it does rent out its micro-cinema. Owner \u00dcmit Mesut\nand film-maker Liam Saint-Pierre run a cult film club, Cin\u00e9 Real, screening\nfilms with a 16mm projector in its red-curtained back room to cool young\nthings who believe film-on-film is anything but hackneyed.\n\nUnlike the UK\u2019s other surviving stores, video rental wasn\u2019t always part of the\nSnips script \u2013 it started out as a womenswear boutique. \u201cMy dad had no\ninterest in films. But in the mid 90s it was a lucrative proposition and, by\nchance, the guy adjacent was a video butcher,\u201d Wain says. A what? \u201cOh, he sold\nvideos and he did butchery. It didn\u2019t really pass food standards. People would\nrent a VHS and get it home and out would come this meaty aroma. It was quite\nunforgettable.\u201d\n\nThe film fans who refuse to surrender to streaming: \u2018One day you\u2019ll barter\nbread for our DVDs\u2019\n\nRead more\n\nAfter buying up the butcher\u2019s beefy stock, Snips now houses a head-spinning\n15,000 films, which range from retro Euro-sleaze to the latest releases. Gaz,\nthe customer in the shop with a thing for South Korean flicks, has been a\nregular for 16 years. \u201cPeople have been waxing lyrical about saving our\nlibraries. This right here is a veritable library,\u201d he says, eyes widening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last bastion of video rental.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. After VHS came to the UK in the late 70s, scores\nof video rental stores cropped up and Blockbuster opened its first British\nbranch, in south London, in 1989. (Both Taylor and Wain cut their teeth at\nBlockbuster but were turned off by its lack of heart.) At its peak, there were\nmore than 800 Blockbusters in the UK, alongside another major chain,\nChoicesUK, and thousands of indie outlets. For years, these shops were\nubiquitous, their names in lights on almost every street in the country.\n\nThe remaining owners remember this golden age of rental well. \u201cThe business\nwas massive,\u201d AllStar Video owner Colin Richards recalls. \u201cOn a weekend we\nwould have six staff and it would be constant service. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to\nrent out 1,000 movies over the week.\u201d But when affordable DVDs for retail came\ninto play (accompanied by even cheaper pirate DVDs) the scene changed. A\nlittle later came postal services such as LoveFilm, with its absence of late\nfees. \u201cIt was the first axe blow,\u201d Taylor says.\n\n> You can come in for a DVD and spend a good half-hour meeting different\n> people and chatting about film\n\nAndrew, Snips customer\n\nMore damaging was the torrent of torrent sites. \u201cThat was us on notice. We\nknew it wasn\u2019t long before internet speeds could let you download movies. We\nlost the students in about 12 months,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt became a battle of\nattrition of cutting out bits of the shop to its bare bones,\u201d he adds. And\nthen the on-demand services truly crashed the party. In 2012, Netflix, itself\noriginally a postal service, landed in the UK with an ominous tudum and a\nstream of streamers followed. It all but wiped out the remaining video rental\nstores.\n\nA year later, Blockbuster left the UK. Since then, making a profit has been\nvirtually impossible and the industry has been reeling. Rent is also a major\nissue. Somehow, though, these few stores still survive. But all rely on bonus\nfeatures \u2013 Snips sells cards and party supplies, TVL Allstar does everything\nfrom photocopying to repairing scratched DVDs, and Flicks has two mini-cinemas\nto hire for parties and private screenings.\n\nThey are also supported by regulars. Some do so as part of a wider desire to\nbolster small businesses, such as farm shop owner Andrew, who visits Snips\nwhile I\u2019m there. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep the culture alive and keep passing it\ndown,\u201d he says, railing against the megacorp streamers. Others simply haven\u2019t\nchanged their ways of watching. \u201cI think some of our customers would be quite\ntickled by the fact that the video shops are seen as quite unusual,\u201d Taylor\nlaughs.\n\n\u2018This right here is a veritable library\u2019 ... inside Snips Movies in Bebington,\nWirral. Photograph: Courtesy of Snips Movies\n\nBut it\u2019s not just charity or habit \u2013 supporters believe film rental can offer\nsomething better than streaming. For Wain, cost is king \u2013 Britons now spend\n\u00a3300 a year on average for on-demand services. \u201cWatching films has become\nelitist. Now people with the most money who can subscribe to the most\nstreaming sites have a choice but the working class doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. Snips,\nliving up to its name, offers a flagship bargain deal of three films for a\nfiver. For Richards, it\u2019s all about experience. \u201cYou go home with a bag of\npopcorn, sit down and watch the film together. You aren\u2019t as distracted.\nYou\u2019re creating an event,\u201d Richards says.\n\nThen there\u2019s the choice. Gaz bemoans the fact that streaming services don\u2019t\nfeature classics or a truly wide range of films (Netflix UK, for example, has\njust a third of Snips\u2019 offering). Another solution to this is Cinema Paradiso,\nthe UK\u2019s last rental-by-mail service, boasting 100,000 titles. \u201cWe believe\nit\u2019s the largest film archive in Europe, if not the world, and it\u2019s still\ngoing strong,\u201d owner Zoran Dugandzic says. \u201cWe still have tens of thousands of\ncustomers, most of them with us over a decade. Pensioners really like to see a\npostman bringing a new disc.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They look forward to coming back to go into such detail like they\u2019re\nreal critics. We love it,\u201d says Richards.\n\nFor me, standing in Snips, there are two great joys. First, the decision-\nmaking process: the kaleidoscopic array of DVD cases draws the eyes to flicks\nthat algorithms wouldn\u2019t dare suggest. Then, there\u2019s the nostalgia. There is\nsomething truly magical about tangible media: the ritual of popping a disc out\nof the case, the artwork, the kitsch DVD menus, the blue carpets.\n\n\u2018Film is in my blood\u2019: the secret cinema in the back of a London shop\n\nRead more\n\nWain, though, is wary of this. \u201cI have an issue with the word \u2018nostalgia\u2019. I\nget people coming in dropping to their knees saying it reminds them of being\n16. And that\u2019s really nice. But for me it\u2019s about tomorrow,\u201d he says.\n\nTaylor feels the same way: \u201cNostalgia suggests what we do isn\u2019t real or\nrelevant or part of the present.\u201d\n\nCan video rental stores really still survive, or even enjoy a revival? There\nseems to be more than a popcorn kernel of hope. The streaming sites, after\nall, also face problems down the line with higher subscription fees and their\noffputting new advertising policies. Plus, all the owners of these rental\nstores have experienced a younger crowd coming in, craving physical video.\n\nWain has seen the excitement of this next generation first-hand. Just before I\nhead home the Snips owner spins a yarn. \u201cRecently, a kid from the local school\ncame in and rented out Rebel Without a Cause. His three mates came with and\nmocked him mercilessly.\u201d He flashes a smile. \u201cFast-forward two months later\nand they\u2019re all renting films.\u201d Perhaps, thanks to these rental rebels, we\nreally will see a sequel to the golden age of video.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Film\n  * Retail industry\n  * TV streaming\n  * Film industry\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
