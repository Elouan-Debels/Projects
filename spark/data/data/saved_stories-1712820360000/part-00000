The\nnext step was to identify the species to which they belonged, since sometimes\nlabels were lost during storage, or the scientific name they bore had fallen\ninto disuse. Remember that taxonomy (the science which names and classifies\nliving species) is constantly evolving as new species are described and their\nrelationships are reevaluated. The identification of all these specimens was\nperformed on the one hand thanks to comparative osteology, but on the other\nrequired a collaboration with the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig for the more\nelusive remains. By mass spectrometry on bone collagen (a very stable major\nprotein constituent), the scientists were able to identify all the enigmatic\nspecies! A next step was a thorough archive exploration to trace the origin of\nthe specimens.\n\nThree skeletons are almost complete, among them is that of an Arnoux's beaked\nwhale, Berardius arnuxii, a small whale inhabiting the Southern Ocean. Its\nhistory was reconstituted from archives: it was found in New Zealand in 1905\nby James Dall, a horticulturist in Collingwood, on a beach between the two\nmain islands which had always formed a natural trap for Cetaceans. Its cleaned\nskeleton was sent together with two other whale skeletons in 1906, by boat to\nStrasbourg. They were purchased by the director of the museum at that time.\nAfter we had reconstructed it (a step by step reconstruction ), the skeleton\nof the beaked whale was digitized, integrated into the Vertebrates App (the\nspecimen in the app), and eventually sent to a specialist who will reassemble\nit for display in the hall of the future museum when it reopens!\n\nFor the record: the Arnoux's beaked whale was described and named by Georges-\nLouis Duvernoy, director of the Zoological Museum of Strasbourg from 1827 to\n1837 (Berardius arnuxii Duvernoy, 1851). He meant to dedicate it to the\ncaptain Auguste Berard (1802-1846) and the naval surgeon Louis Arnoux\n(1814-1867) who brought back from New Zealand the skull of this new species,\naboard a corvette named 'Le Rhin'. You can\u2019t make that up!\n\nMarie Meister, Mus\u00e9e zoologique de Strasbourg\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\n### 11/30/23\n\n## DIGITISATION\n\nAnolis beckeri\n\nBecker\u2019s Anole is a small arboreal lizard, 6cm-long without the tail. This\nspecimen, preserved in alcohol in the collections of the Museum of Brussels,\nwas digitised by micro-CT as part of a programme for digital preservation of\ncollections.\n\nThe data was given to me by Jonathan Brecko who did the digitising. At first,\nit was only a test to see if it was possible to cleanly extract the bones of\nsuch a small specimen. While working on this, I discovered Dragonfly\nsoftware\u2019s Deep Learning module. It took a while to train the module but in\nthe end I was able to extract the skeleton and also separate all the bones.\nThe result is so precise that some bones from the skull were previously\nunknown. Researchers from Paris MNHN and the Museum of Brussels will soon be\nworking on this to make the specimen available to everyone.\n\nSamba Soussoko\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\n### 10/19/23\n\n## COLLECTIONS\n\nA lost giraffe\n\nSometimes some specimens can reappear in collections, such as this young\ngiraffe that was recently added to the Vertebrates app. Acquired for the\ncollections at Strasbourg Zoological Museum in 1910, this specimen comes from\nMorogoro in Tanzania. It had been partially prepared, the thoracic cage being\nplaced to dry in the Museum\u2019s attics before the First World War, then\nforgotten, with later staff changes. It was rediscovered and prepared...in\n2017!\n\nIt is a young individual, barely 3m tall, whose horns were not yet fused to\nthe frontal bone. We will soon be adding a 4m-tall adult specimen which will\nallow us to compare overall proportions of the skeleton at two different ages.\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\n### Partners\n\n### Support\n\n  * Legal notices\n  * \\- Contact\n\n", "frontpage": false}
