There are more AI-driven outdoor exoskeletons on the way,\ndesigned to help amateur adventurers go farther faster with less effort.\n\nNext up: the X1 from Chinese startup Dnsys. Slap this piece of motorized AI\nonto your waist and thighs and upgrade your anatomy with an extra 900 watts of\nwalking, hiking, scrambling, climbing and running power. The X1 shoulders up\nto 83 lb (38 kg) of load, empowers user speeds over 16 mph (26 km/h) and packs\ndown small for travel.\n\nMore Stories\n\nSports\n\nThe world's only streaming headset for swimming just got better\n\nArchitecture\n\nBoeing 737 transformed into incredible cliff-hanging luxury residence\n\nEven after years of covering safety, industrial, military and medically\ntargeted exoskeletons, the idea of a wearable recreational performance-booster\ndidn't come anywhere near our radar until Hypershell put its Omega lineup on\nKickstarter just over a year ago. That looked like an off-the-wall one-off at\nthe time, but it might just have kicked off the age of the temporary-cyborg\nadventure-seeker.\n\nJust like ebikes open up doors to fitness and exercise for people who might\nnot dare to take off on a long cycle without some assistance, these\nrecreational exoskeletons promise to welcome people to hiking and climbing\nexperiences that might otherwise be beyond their fitness level. So while the\nidea might sound like complete sci-fi lunacy right now, these things could end\nup being extremely useful, and a very liberating way to bypass physical\nconstraints.\n\nLike Hypershell, Dnsys is introducing its wearable outdoorsy exo via\nKickstarter, with a campaign that's set to launch at 9 a.m. EDT today. And\nit's clearly used Hypershell's exoskeletons for benchmarking, looking to\noutperform them on every line item of the spec sheet.\n\nThe X1 can help you climb and scramble with more ease\n\nDnsys\n\nThe X1's bragging rights start off with a lighter 3.5-lb (1.6-kg) build that\nducks below the 4-lb (1.8-kg) weight of the lightest Hypershell model from\nlast year's Kickstarter campaign. Meanwhile, the X1 puts out 100 watts more\nthan any Hypershell, resulting in an extra 18 pounds (8 kg) of weight-\noffsetting capability, which estimates in at 83 lb (38 kg) total.\n\nJust imagine carrying a huge, stuffed backpack \u2013 an old-school external-frame\npack to match the Dnsys styling \u2013 and feeling like you're hiking with nothing\nmore on your back than a breezy, fast-drying shirt.\n\nOf course, you don't actually have to be carrying 83 lb of miscellaneous life-\nsustaining kit on your back to benefit from the 30 lb-ft (40 Nm) of torque the\nX1 kicks into your stride. Even if you're simply day hiking with no more than\na water bottle in-hand, the X1 promises to remove stress from each step,\ncutting up to 50 percent of the energy expended so you can stay fresher for\nlonger and journey farther.\n\nWhether you're looking to keep your legs fresh, get there fast or a little of\nboth, the Dnsys X1 wearable exoskeleton is designed to give you the power to\ndo it\n\nDnsys\n\nWhatever one's mission of the day is, the X1 starts by identifying and\nanalyzing leg positioning via its onboard motion sensor to the tune of\nthousands of times every second. This information runs through advanced AI\nalgorithms on the dual-core 240MHz processor to interpret intentions and\ninstantaneously adjust motor output to the wearer's pace and movements.\n\nThe AI also learns the X1 owner's movements over time so it can better\npersonalize its output to the way you typically use it.\n\nLike a high-performance hybrid sports car, the X1 also includes a push-button\nboost mode that instantly marshals the full 900 watts (1.2 hp). That allows\nyou to shoot for a top running speed of 16.7 mph (27 km/h) \u2013 not quite peak-\nhuman 27.8-mph Usain Bolt territory, but it tops the average half-marathon\nrunner's pace by about 10 mph (16 km/h). To visualise it, here's a fella\nrunning a little slower:\n\nTreadmill Challenge, 1 minute at 25 km/h\n\nThe X1 isn't merely about speed and power, though. On descents, it can\nintroduce resistance to maintain a slower, steadier pace that protects the\nwearer's knees and delivers more precise foot control.\n\nDnsys estimates battery range at about 15.5 to 18.6 miles (25 to 30 km),\ngiving the X1 more than enough juice for a solid day's hike. Users can also\nhot-swap batteries, dropping in a fresh one to double the range. Dnsys says\nthat just eight minutes connected to a mobile phone charger will add 20\npercent battery power. Integrated kinetic energy recovery (KERS) helps\nmaximize battery runtime.\n\nAs for basic construction, Dnsys keeps weight low with a mix of ultralight\nmaterials that includes aerospace-grade aluminum and carbon fiber. The X1\nstraps to the user's waist via a chain clasp belt that Dnsys claims improves\nfit, security and comfort. Separate thigh straps provide a snug, custom fit by\nway of Boa dials.\n\nWhen the adventure is over, the X1 packs down to a relatively flat 6-L size\nfor easily stashing away in a backpack or suitcase.\n\nThe Dnsys X1 hits Kickstarter today\n\nDnsys\n\nIt's hard to really say whether these types of exoskeletons will be the\nperformance enhancers their inventors claim or will end up being more\nuncomfortable and in the way than they're worth. Now that we've seen more than\none roaming out the market (or pre-market, anyway), we might just have to get\nour legs into one and see what bionic adventuring is really like.\n\nIf you're interested in doing the same, you can get Kickstarting to put\nyourself in position for X1 early adoption. Dnsys will offer three different\nmodels, with super-early bird pledges ranging between US$399 and $998. The\nmid-level $599 Carbon model looks to be the Goldilocks option for those who\ndon't anticipate venturing beyond the base 15.5+ mile range, packing all the\naforementioned specs.\n\nThe $998 Carbon Plus adds a spare battery and a build spec that includes\ntitanium, while the entry level $399 Lite model weighs a bit more and uses a\nsmaller 500-W motor drive for more modest performance. Plans call for\ndeliveries to begin in July.\n\nAs with any Kickstarter, we'd caution that the X1 may take much longer than\nplanned or may never come to fruition at all; it's pledger beware. But we have\nto admit, this one's really got us thinking!\n\nEnjoy a truly awful video below, complete with what sounds like audio\nwatermarks from ripped-off stock music. Whoops! Still, tell me this doesn't\nlook like fun.\n\nDysns Exoskeleton\n\nSource: Dnsys\n\nView gallery - 9 images\n\n## Tags\n\nOutdoorsExoskeletonHikingOutdoorsWearableArtificial\nIntelligenceBackpackingKickstarter\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nC.C.
