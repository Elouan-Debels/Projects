Compared with men aged between 18 and 29, women\nreported worse mental and financial wellbeing, lower satisfaction with pay and\nconditions and admitted coping worse with the cost-of-living.\n\nThe report found that one-in-five people have skipped meals due to rising\ncosts.\n\nDespite surface level satisfaction, there is an undercurrent of discontent\namong the younger generation, especially when they are directed to think about\ntheir future.\n\nNearly half (48pc) of young people are dissatisfied with their current housing\nsituation, while more than half of those with rental or mortgage payments have\nseen costs increase in the last 12 months, with 44pc feeling financially worse\noff than the previous year.\n\nYoung people\u2019s fear of being worse off than their parents is being driven by\nhousing challenges and economic concerns. Many of those surveyed feel home\nownership is getting further out of their reach.\n\nMore than half (52pc) of those surveyed are still living with their family,\nwhile one-in-two have experienced rent increases in the past year, with some\nfacing rises of up to 30pc.\n\nOne-in-10 say they have had to take out a loan to cover monthly expenses.\n\nThe 750 adults surveyed were asked a set of specific questions relating to\nfeelings of being optimistic, relaxed, feeling close to others and dealing\nwith problems. Based on the mental wellbeing scale developed by Warwick and\nEdinburgh Universities, half of young people displayed low levels of\nwellbeing. Four-in-10 stated they felt relaxed either rarely or none of the\ntime in the past two weeks. This appeared to peak among 18 to 22-year-olds,\nwith 46pc saying they weren\u2019t feeling relaxed.\n\nThose aged 27 to 29 feel the least optimistic about the future. Nearly 4 in 10\n(39pc) said they feel optimistic rarely or none of the time, compared to 28pc\nof 23 to 26-year-olds and 31pc of 18 to 22-year-olds. Women appear less\noptimistic about the future - with well over a third (38pc) of women stating\nthey rarely feel optimistic about the future, compared to only a quarter\n(26pc) of men.\n\nThe report made a number of recommendations in addressing the challenges faced\nby young people. Among them are tackling housing and accommodation issues by\nintroducing rent caps and increasing social and affordable housing supply.\n\nThe NYCI has called for the abolishment of sub-minimum wage rates for under\n20s and a reduction in education fees.\n\nPaul Gordon, NYCI director of policy and advocacy, said: \u201cMany of this\ngeneration feel like their lives are being put on hold and this is manifesting\nin a very concerning finding that half of 18-29-year-olds have low mental\nwellbeing.\n\n\u201cIn response, we are calling on the Government to take a far more coordinated\napproach to tackling the economic and social challenges facing young people by\nmoving quickly to establish a cabinet sub-committee on young people.\u201d\n\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\n\nStay up to date with all the latest news\n\nPromoted Links\n\nRecommended by\n\n### Latest Irish News\n\n  * ##### Man left brain damaged after botched delivery at Rotunda awarded \u20ac9m\n\n  * ##### Off-duty garda grabbed keys to getaway car during petrol station robbery, court hears as knife wielding raider jailed\n\n  * ##### Soldier convicted and sacked from Irish army for \u2018punishment beating\u2019 of recruit fails in appeal bid\n\n  * ##### Self-harm and suicide TikTok content recommended to 13-year-olds within minutes of signing up, investigation finds\n\n  * ##### Mary Lou McDonald tackles Simon Harris on past promise to scoliosis patients in his first leaders\u2019 questions as Taoiseach\n\n  * ##### Man (21) accused of intimidating Michael Healy-Rae during protest outside Leinster House appears in court\n\n  * ##### Dublin priest dies following tragic accident in Mexico\n\n  * ##### LATEST | Traffic cameras will be soon used to catch and fine drivers using mobile phones at the wheel \u2013 or on their lap\n\n  * ##### Sinn F\u00e9in TD \u2018open\u2019 to changes on 12-week abortion limit\n\n  * ##### High hotel rates charged in Dublin during major gigs are in line with other European cities, report on \u2018price gouging\u2019 finds\n\n### Top Stories\n\n  * Irish News\n\n#### Tell us your experience of using the new Re-turn bottle and can recycling\nmachines\n\n  * Rural Life\n\n#### \u2018The Old Irish Goat is our living, breathing heritage \u2013 how could we let\nthem die out or be hunted for sport?\u2019\n\n  * Politics\n\n#### Mary Lou McDonald tackles Simon Harris on past promise to scoliosis\npatients in his first leaders\u2019 questions as Taoiseach\n\n  * Dublin News\n\n#### \u2018Even if I wanted to live in Dublin, I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u2019 says TV\npresenter James Kavanagh\n\n### Latest NewsMore\n\n  * Other Sports\n\n##### \u2018We know the Irish love sports so we believe they would show up\u2019 \u2013\nPittsburgh Steelers hope to play NFL game in Dublin\n\n16:19\n\n  * Farming\n\n##### Kerry Group and Lakeland Diaries announce milk price for March supplies\n\n16:15\n\n  * Videos\n\n##### Stormont Opposition leader Matthew O'Toole outlines plans to poverty in\nNorthern Ireland\n\n16:05\n\n  * Videos\n\n##### Minister for Justice Helen McEntee introduces tougher knife crime\nsentences\n\n16:05\n\n  * Celebrity News\n\n##### Celebrity baker Paul Hollywood to receive royal honour at Windsor Castle\n\n16:05\n\n  * Videos\n\n##### Chance to do treble again an \u2018inspiration and motivation\u2019 \u2013 Bernardo\nSilva\n\n15:48\n\n  * Celebrity News\n\n##### Beatles documentary Let It Be to be released on Disney+\n\n15:45\n\n  * International Soccer\n\n##### Chris Hughton approached by FAI again as speculation mounts announcement\nof new Ireland boss will be delayed\n\n15:41\n\n  * Videos\n\n##### Heavy flooding in Dubai stores\n\n15:38\n\n  * Life\n\n##### Over 50 and lonely?
