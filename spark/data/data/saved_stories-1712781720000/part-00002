This is due to an error with the initial package. When\nthe tag for 6.5.1 was created on the WordPress build server, it was created\nfrom a previous revision of the 6.5 branch. As tags are treated as immutable,\nthis meant that WordPress 6.5.1 could not be released.\n\nAs a follow-up, the core team will work with the WordPress.org Systems team\nand update respective documentation as needed to ensure that everything is\ndone to prevent similar situations.\n\nThanks to @audrasjb, @davidbaumwald, and @jeffpaul for pre-publication review.\n\n#6-5, #6-5-x\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nShow Comments\n\n\u2190 Speculative Loading in WordPress\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Gutenberg 18.1?
