Its emphasis on morality and civics has also primed it for partisan\ntakeover.\n\nBy Emma Green\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\nHundreds of classical schools have opened in the United States in recent\nyears.Illustration by Ricardo Tom\u00e1s; Source photographs from Getty\n\nListen to this article.\n\nThe first thing you notice when walking into the middle-school classrooms at\nBrilla, a charter-school network in the South Bronx, is the sense of calm. No\nphones are out. The students are quiet\u2014not in the beaten-down way of those\nunder authoritarian rule but in the way of those who seem genuinely interested\nin their work. Sixth graders participate in a multiday art project after\nstudying great painters such as Matisse. Seventh graders prepare to debate\nwhether parents should be punished for the crimes of their minor children.\nAnother group of sixth graders, each holding a violin or a cello, read out\nnotes from sheet music. A teacher cues them to play the lines pizzicato, and\nthey pluck their strings in unison.\n\nBrilla is part of the classical-education movement, a fast-growing effort to\nfundamentally reorient schooling in America. Classical schools offer a\ntraditional liberal-arts education, often focussing on the Western canon and\nthe study of citizenship. The classical approach, which prioritizes some ways\nof teaching that have been around for more than two thousand years, is\nradically different from that of public schools, where what kids learn\u2014and how\nthey learn it\u2014varies wildly by district, school, and even classroom.\n\nIn many public schools, kids learn to read by guessing words using context\nclues, rather than by decoding the sounds of letters. In most classical\nschools, phonics reign, and students learn grammar by diagramming sentences.\nSome public schools have moved away from techniques like memorization, which\neducation scholars knock as \u201crote learning\u201d or \u201cdrill and kill\u201d\u2014the thing\nthat\u2019s killed being a child\u2019s desire to learn. In contrast, classical schools\nprize memory work, asking students to internalize math formulas and recite\npoems. And then there\u2019s literature: one New York City public-high-school\nreading list includes graphic novels, Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, and a coming-\nof-age book about identity featuring characters named Aristotle and Dante. In\nclassical schools, high-school students read Aristotle and Dante.\n\nClassical education has historically been promoted by religious institutions\nand expensive prep schools. (Many classical schools have adopted the Harkness\nmethod, pioneered by Phillips Exeter Academy, in which students and teachers\ncollectively work through material via open discussion.) More recently,\npowerful investors have seen its potential for cultivating academic excellence\nin underserved populations: the Charter School Growth Fund, a nonprofit whose\ninvestors include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Bloomberg\nPhilanthropies, has put millions of dollars into classical schools and\nnetworks.\n\nRepublican politicians have also smelled opportunity in the movement, billing\nits traditionalism as an antidote to public-school wokeism. Ron DeSantis, the\ngovernor of Florida, has railed against \u201ca concerted effort to inject this\ngender ideology\u201d into public-school classrooms, and has celebrated the influx\nof classical schools in his state. Tennessee\u2019s governor, Bill Lee, proposed\nlaunching up to a hundred classical charter schools statewide, touting their\nmission to preserve American liberty. As more conservatives have flocked to\nclassical education, progressive academics have issued warnings about the\nmovement, characterizing it as a fundamentally Christian project that doesn\u2019t\ninclude or reflect the many kids in America who aren\u2019t white, or who have\nroots outside this country. The education scholar and activist Diane Ravitch\nrecently wrote that classical charters \u201chave become weapons of the Right as\nthey seek to destroy democratically governed public schools while turning back\nthe clock of education and social progress by a century.\u201d\n\nStephanie Saroki de Garcia, who co-founded Brilla, acknowledged that\n\u201cclassical education is often seen as a white child\u2019s education.\u201d This is\npartly because of the curriculum: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about teaching the canon and\nmainly white, male authors,\u201d she said. It\u2019s also because these schools have\nbeen embraced by white Republicans who have the resources to keep their\nchildren out of the local school system. And yet Brilla is not rich, or white,\nor discernibly right-wing. Many students are English-language learners and\nimmigrants, from Central America and West Africa. According to Brilla\u2019s\nleaders, nearly ninety per cent of their students meet the federal\nrequirements for free or reduced-price lunches. Saroki de Garcia purposefully\nopened the first Brilla school in the poorest neighborhood of the Bronx, which\nhas a large population of Latino Catholics. (Brilla is secular, but it offers\na free Catholic after-school program.) The students I met were nerdy and\nearnest, and far from young reactionaries. Angelina and Fatumata, two eighth\ngraders, told me that they started a book club to read about racism in\nAmerica; one recent pick was \u201cPassing,\u201d the 1929 novel by Nella Larsen, set in\nthe Harlem Renaissance. Brilla\u2019s leaders intentionally take a wide view of the\ncanon, and of which texts are valuable to study. \u201cWe try to make that\nconnection for our students, who are mostly Black and Hispanic, with faces\nthey can see themselves in,\u201d Will Scott, the principal of one of Brilla\u2019s\nmiddle schools, said.\n\nBrilla\u2019s administrators were careful to note that the network isn\u2019t\n\u201cclassical\u201d but, rather, \u201cclassically inspired.\u201d This distinction is partly\npractical. Although teachers invoke Latin root words when they\u2019re teaching\nkids English, for example, students don\u2019t take Latin as a subject. But it also\nseemed like the school\u2019s leaders wanted to put some distance between\nthemselves and the broader classical-education movement. \u201cIf we say \u2018classical\nschool,\u2019 that has a connotation,\u201d Scott said. Still, it\u2019s telling that the\nschools have found traction by marketing themselves as \u201cclassically inspired\u201d\nin the South Bronx, where voters overwhelmingly prefer Democrats and the\ncollege-graduation rate is among the lowest in New York City. During the lead-\nup to Brilla\u2019s launch, in 2013, volunteers posted up outside a local\nMcDonald\u2019s to pitch families on enrolling. \u201cWe billed it as, This is what the\n\u00e9lite get,\u201d Saroki de Garcia told me.\n\nEveryone I met at Brilla seemed aware that their school is an implicit\nrejection of traditional public schools, but not in the way one might expect.\nAlthough America\u2019s public-school wars are often depicted as fights over race\nand gender ideology, there are also a lot of parents who think their local\nschools just aren\u2019t very good. Brilla\u2019s two middle schools are in New York\nCity\u2019s School District 7, where, last year, less than a third of sixth graders\nwere proficient in math or in reading and writing. Angelina, a recent\nimmigrant from St. Croix, said that most of her friends \u201cgo to a public\nschool, and they talk really poorly about their school.\u201d Fatumata added that\n\u201cthey don\u2019t have what we have,\u201d such as Algebra I classes for middle\nschoolers. \u201cThe schools around us are, frankly, failing,\u201d Scott, the\nprincipal, told me.\n\nThere are many charter schools that aim to address the problem of low\nachievement, often through an obsessive focus on test scores and discipline.\nBrilla cares about both of these things, but what sets it apart is its\nmission. Classical education is premised on the idea that there is objective\ntruth, and that the purpose of school is to set kids on a path toward\nunderstanding it. This principle is often framed in philosophical\nshorthand\u2014classical educators love talking about \u201ctruth, beauty, and\ngoodness,\u201d which can sound like a woo-woo catchphrase to the uninitiated\u2014and\nit\u2019s paired with an emphasis on morality and ethics. Brilla students attend a\ncharacter-education class every morning, where they talk about how to live out\nthe different virtues reflected in the texts they read. As Alexandra Apfel, an\nassistant superintendent for Brilla\u2019s middle schools, said, \u201cWe\u2019re building\nstudents that are not just going to be academic robots but moms and dads\nsomeday.\u201d\n\nIn 1947, Dorothy Sayers, a motorcycle-riding Anglican crime writer, delivered\na paper at Oxford titled \u201cThe Lost Tools of Learning,\u201d in which she bemoaned\nthe state of education. \u201cDo you ever find that young people, when they have\nleft school, not only forget most of what they have learnt (that is only to be\nexpected) but forget also, or betray that they have never really known, how to\ntackle a new subject for themselves?\u201d Young people do not know how to think,\nshe argued, because they\u2019ve never been taught. They may have been introduced\nto subjects, but not to what it means to learn.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nIn the face of this contemporary problem, Sayers proposed an ancient solution:\nthe revival of a medieval teaching format called the trivium, which divided\nlearning into three stages\u2014grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric. The first stage\nis about mastering basic skills and facts; the second teaches students to\nargue and to think critically about those facts. By the third stage, they\u2019re\nready to express themselves in essays and oration. This model of education,\ncultivated by Renaissance thinkers and the Catholic Church alike, was common\namong European \u00e9lites for centuries.\n\nCartoon by Roz Chast\n\nLink copied\n\nSayers\u2019s essay built on a long-standing debate about whether this kind of\neducation made sense in a rapidly changing, industrialized world. Classical-\neducation advocates often point to John Dewey, the early-twentieth-century\nprogressive reformer, as the b\u00eate noire who marginalized their preferred form\nof schooling: \u201cThere was a war going on between the progressive and the\nclassical educators, and the progressives won in a rout,\u201d Andrew Kern, the\nfounder of the Center for Independent Research on Classical Education, told\nme. Although this story is perhaps overly simplistic, Johann Neem, a historian\nat Western Washington University, said, it\u2019s true that Dewey and other\nprogressives thought that the old ways of education were inadequate for modern\nstudents. These progressive reformers planted the seeds of two trends. The\nfirst was shifting the focus of school toward appealing to the interests of\nthe child, rather than transmitting ancient knowledge and wisdom, which these\nreformers considered \u00e9litist. (\u201cAcademic and scholastic, instead of being\ntitles of honor, are becoming terms of reproach,\u201d Dewey wrote.) The second was\na utilitarian impulse\u2014some scholars thought that the purpose of education was\nto train workers. They did not believe that every student needed to read\nPlato.\n\nIn the late nineteen-seventies and early eighties, classical education\nre\u00ebmerged as a pushback against these trends. A handful of schools built\naround Sayers\u2019s ideas launched in Idaho, Massachusetts, Kansas, and Indiana,\nindependently of one another. They were all Christian, but of different\nflavors\u2014two had Catholic roots, one was ecumenical, and one was evangelical.\nDoug Wilson, the pastor who founded the evangelical school, in Idaho, later\nstarted a conference for Christian parents and educators who were interested\nin creating their own schools. This was the beginning of the Association of\nClassical Christian Schools, or A.C.C.S., which has since grown into a network\nof more than five hundred and forty schools, most of which are Protestant and\nuse aspects of the trivium model. Even in Christian circles, Wilson is a\npolarizing figure\u2014he promotes a theology that prizes strictly traditional\ngender roles and has made inflammatory comments about race relations. But the\nclassical movement has expanded into something much broader: there are more\nthan two hundred Catholic classical schools, which call their approach\n\u201cCatholic liberal education,\u201d along with a growing number of classical charter\nschools with no religious identity. The movement is diverse, in part because\nclassical education has boomed among homeschoolers, who run the gamut from\nserious athletes to kids with learning differences to conservative Christians.\nThese homeschooling families \u201clike the idea of a traditional, rigorous\neducation that really demands a lot out of a child, and that is also\nresponsive to them,\u201d Susan Wise Bauer, the co-author of \u201cThe Well-Trained\nMind,\u201d a popular guide to classical homeschooling, told me.\n\nThe notion of a standardized curriculum, let alone a shared value system, no\nlonger exists in most American public schools. Proponents of classical\neducation argue that any student can find value in the same timeless\ntexts\u2014Augustine and Austen, Chaucer and Chesterton\u2014regardless of that\nstudent\u2019s race, religion, or class. James Baldwin once said that reading\nDickens \u201ctaught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things\nthat connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had been alive.\u201d\nClassical-education advocates want kids to read Dickens and feel that same\nconnection.\n\nThough classical schooling might have once been the education of \u00e9lites, the\nmodern version has egalitarian potential. In Texas, enrollment in classical\ncharter schools is growing most quickly among Asian and Hispanic students. In\nArizona, a charter-school network called Espiritu, which mostly serves\nimmigrants, recently overhauled its curricula to be more classical. And yet,\nperhaps inevitably, the movement has also felt the gravitational pull of the\nculture wars. With many classical schools focussed on moral formation and\ncivics\u2014and, incidentally, white male authors\u2014this educational mode is primed\nto be co-opted into something that\u2019s not just traditional but reactionary. The\narchitects of contemporary classical education believed that, by reaching into\nthe past, they could build a better future for American education. Today, many\nof the people embracing classical education are more interested in running\naway from the aspects of progressive schooling they fear.\n\nPete Hegseth, the perfectly coiffed Fox News host, sits on a stage in\nFranklin, Tennessee, a small city south of Nashville. To his left is a giant\nAmerican flag. He is here taping a segment of his Fox Nation special \u201cThe\nMisEducation of America\u201d before a live audience of parents who are disturbed\nby what they\u2019ve encountered in local public schools. \u201cWe are fighting the\nbattle of fires,\u201d Cameron Sexton, the speaker of the Tennessee House of\nRepresentatives, tells Hegseth: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about C.R.T.\u201d\u2014critical race\ntheory\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re talking about books in the library,\u201d which might incorporate\nideas about gender or sexuality. Sexton goes on to explain that the only\nsolution is for people to enroll their children in classical schools, like he\ndid with his own daughter, where students won\u2019t be spoon-fed ideology.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more powerful than for an individual to have the ability to\nthink and decide things for themselves,\u201d Sexton says. \u201cThat\u2019s how you stop the\ngovernment from intruding on your life.\u201d\n\nWhen we spoke, Hegseth acknowledged that his interest in the movement \u201cstarted\nas a reaction against\u201d what he saw as progressive indoctrination in typical\npublic schools. He has since reoriented his life around classical Christian\neducation; in 2022, he and his wife moved outside Nashville to send their kids\nto such a school. He also understands the appeal of the model to a politically\nconservative audience. \u201cWhat our viewers are looking for is a back-to-basics\napproach,\u201d he said, one in which Christianity is \u201cfront and center.\u201d\n\nHegseth is close with David Goodwin, who became the president of A.C.C.S. in\n2015. Under Goodwin, the number of A.C.C.S. schools has more than doubled.\nGoodwin and Hegseth recently co-wrote a book called \u201cBattle for the American\nMind,\u201d in which they argue that Marxists \u201chave taken full control of America\u2019s\neducation system.\u201d Wokeism, they explain, is driven by a vision of education\nthat prizes \u201ccontrol of your identity, being accepted for who you are, finding\nadventure, and creating your own path in life.\u201d Arguably, these are\ncontemporary buzzwords with roots in century-old progressive ideas\u2014that\nknowledge and virtue are not objective and external but, rather, subjective\nand internal, to be discovered as one develops one\u2019s sense of self. Hegseth\nand Goodwin believe that, by focussing students\u2019 education on the\ncivilizations that flowed out of \u201cthe convergence of Greece, Rome, and Hebrew\ncultures,\u201d America can recapture the norms it was built on. \u201cWe are the new\nradicals, the new revolutionaries,\u201d they write.\n\nAs part of this revolution, Goodwin and the A.C.C.S. have been promoting\nclassical education overseas. They see Africa, in particular, as fertile\nground: over the last twenty-five years, Christian missionaries and pastors\nhave planted classical schools in a dozen countries. This past fall, I went\nwith Goodwin to Nairobi for a conference hosted by the Rafiki network, which\nruns schools in ten English-speaking African countries and publishes a\ncurriculum used by dozens of other schools. Goodwin lives in Boise\u2014it was his\nfirst time in Africa, or south of the equator, for that matter. Wearing a\nslightly baggy blazer and a yellow tie, he stood in front of roughly two\nhundred people in a dim auditorium near an Anglican cathedral.\n\nThe obvious question of the day was why Goodwin\u2019s version of classical\neducation would be compelling to people living outside the West. \u201cIt took me\nabout twenty hours from where I live in the States to get here,\u201d Goodwin said.\n\u201cFifteen hours in, I started crossing over the territories that most developed\nthe West. I crossed Macedonia. The plane flew down through Greece and near\nAlexandria, in Egypt, and then down the Red Sea, with Mt. Sinai on the left.\u201d\nIn Nairobi, he argued, they were far closer to the history of the West than he\nwas back at home. \u201cThis is where Christendom grew up,\u201d he said. He noted that\nthe word \u201cWestern\u201d is often associated with colonization. Goodwin framed his\nrole not as one of domination and takeover but, instead, as an emissary from a\npossible future. \u201cWe\u2019re in a pitched battle in the United States,\u201d he said,\n\u201cbetween the powers of light and the powers of darkness.\u201d His prayer was that\nthe audience wouldn\u2019t let progressive education take root in their country.\n\nAfter the lecture, Goodwin confessed to me that his earlier argument\u2014that\nKenya is closer to the origins of the West than America is\u2014was a bit of a\nstretch. Despite nearly three-quarters of a century of colonialism in Kenya,\nhe said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s dominantly a Western culture, because Greco-Roman\nphilosophy is not deeply ingrained.\u201d In his view, no place on the African\ncontinent is currently part of the West. Even Alexandria, which was one of the\nseedbeds of Western thought and philosophy in the centuries before and after\nChrist, is now dominated by Islam, which Goodwin does not see as part of the\nWest. Although Christianity might have roots in Africa, it moved westward,\ntoward Europe and the United States, and that\u2019s the intellectual tradition\nGoodwin is focussed on. It is \u201cexistentially evident that Western culture is\nthe most influential in the history of man,\u201d he had told me a few weeks\nearlier. Goodwin thinks that Kenyans should learn songs and stories from their\ncountry and continent, along with the history of Greece and Rome. But, he\nsaid, \u201cwe don\u2019t buy into the cultural philosophy that all cultures are equally\nvaluable and good.\u201d\n\nThe next day, I got in a car with Theodore and Crystal Wilson, the heads of\nRafiki Classical Christian, a school on the outskirts of Nairobi that educates\nkids aged three to eighteen. The Wilsons, a Black, missionary couple, taught\nat classical schools in America before moving to Kenya, in 2022. We wove\nthrough chaotic traffic on our way out of central Nairobi\u2014speeding minibuses\ntaking men to work, throngs of people crossing the street seemingly at random.\nChurches were everywhere: Israel New Creation House, Abundant Glory\nInternational Ministries. Soon, we arrived at the Rafiki compound, originally\nthe summer home of Kenya\u2019s first President, Jomo Kenyatta. Behind a tall rock\nwall, the campus was a lovely oasis: ibises flew around acacia trees that were\nscattered among a series of small, squat buildings with red tile roofs, each\nhousing a couple of grades.\n\nTheo Wilson was a Navy chaplain, and his military background showed. When he\nand his wife arrived in Kenya, they cultivated a morning-assembly tradition\u2014a\nhighly orchestrated performance of students marching along an outdoor\nbasketball blacktop. Wilson, wearing a canvas safari hat, a bow tie, and a\nsweater vest, stood before the children, who lined up in neat rows with their\nhands behind their backs. \u201cWhy are we in school today?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo glorify\nand enjoy God,\u201d they answered, following a script provided by the A.C.C.S.\n\nIn the classrooms, the trivium was everywhere. Preschoolers were memorizing a\nverse from I Samuel. Third graders took turns reciting lines from \u201cThe\nFisherman and His Wife,\u201d a fairy tale published by the Brothers Grimm. Some\naspects of Kenyan culture were present: on the wall of a second-grade\nclassroom, the Kiswahili alphabet was written out next to the English one. \u201cWe\ngo to great lengths to feature their art, their music, but also historical\nfigures of the African diaspora,\u201d Theo Wilson said. Still, there was a jarring\nemphasis on Western civilization. In one classroom, the history of music was\nlaid out according to European eras\u2014Renaissance, Baroque, Classical,\nRomantic\u2014and the walls were decorated with portraits of white European\ncomposers. Later, we visited the library inside Rafiki\u2019s teacher-training\ncollege. One wall was covered by a twenty-three-foot-long time line of world\nhistory first published in 1871, starting from Adam and Eve. It featured a\nsketched map of the world that portrayed Europe and the Middle East in\ncolorful detail, whereas the whole of the African continent south of Carthage\nwas a giant black mass. Each civilization had its own line, tracing its\nevolution through the centuries. By the time of the birth of Jesus, any\nreference to African history had disappeared.\n\nAt the conference, I met a Kenyan woman named Melissa Wakhu, who wore large,\ngeometric earrings and styled her hair in shoulder-length locs. She had worked\nas a consultant for Deloitte before choosing to homeschool her four children\nfull time using Classical Conversations, a classical-homeschooling curriculum\nthat\u2019s popular in America. Her kids have received the full classical\nexperience, from learning literature and Latin to memorizing the names of\nGreek and Roman gods. \u201cI\u2019ve watched what it\u2019s done to my children, in terms of\nopening up their minds, their vocabulary, their thinking, their empathy,\u201d she\nsaid. She even works for Classical Conversations part time, as its\nrepresentative for East Africa.\n\nAnd yet, as time went on, she started feeling unsettled. Her children would\nlisten to classical music, \u201cbut then my kids started asking, \u2018Are there no\nAfrican musicians and composers?\u2019 \u201d she said. One lesson suggested that\nchildren go outside and collect maple leaves, which are nowhere to be found in\nNairobi. Her tenth grader was working through a unit on the American\ngovernment and economy. \u201cThey have to memorize a well-written speech and\npresent it, and what they were memorizing was the preamble to the\nConstitution,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I have these African, Kenyan children standing\nand reading out to me, \u2018We the People of the United States . . . \u2019 For me,\nthat was a conflict.\u201d Wakhu has now written and published more than a dozen\nkids\u2019 books featuring Kenyan scenes and African heroes, to fill what she saw\nas a gaping hole in the classical resources available to her family.\n\nThroughout the conference, American speakers kept bringing up Augustine, who\nlived and wrote in what is now Algeria. \u201cHe\u2019s northern Africa, which has a\ncompletely different experience than the rest of us,\u201d Wakhu told me. The\nimplication, in suggesting that Augustine is the closest thing to an African\nthinker that the classical tradition has to offer, is that \u201cthere was no\nphilosophical thinking\u201d in places like Kenya, Wakhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge\nfor this group of foreigners to try and come and convince us of something that\nis beautiful, but is also Western.\u201d\n\nPlenty of Americans are also skeptical of the classical-education movement\u2019s\nnarrow emphasis on the West. In 2021, Angel Adams Parham, a sociology\nprofessor at the University of Virginia, became the board chair of the Classic\nLearning Test, or CLT\u2014an SAT alternative often taken by classical-school\nstudents and homeschoolers. Parham came to classical education by the same\npath as many others: when her oldest daughter was getting ready for school,\nParham looked at the available options and wasn\u2019t satisfied, so she started\nhomeschooling. Just like Wakhu, Parham found Classical Conversations, which\nset her on her own intellectual journey. \u201cAs I\u2019m reading the Republic for the\nfirst time\u2014I must have been in my forties\u2014I\u2019m thinking, Why have I never read\nthis?\u201d She had an undergraduate degree from Yale and a Ph.D. from the\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, and yet, she told me, she had never been\nexposed to these foundational texts.\n\nParham, who is Black and studies the history of race, came to believe that the\nWestern canon is deeply intertwined with the Black intellectual\ntradition\u2014after all, Malcolm X read the classics in prison. Black figures have\nalso fundamentally shaped the Western tradition. Parham recently led a\nreassessment of which authors appear on the CLT; one figure who got added was\nOlaudah Equiano, a freed slave who was part of the movement to end the slave\ntrade in Britain and wrote an influential autobiography. For the most part,\nthough, Parham has found that \u201cthe mainstream of the movement\u201d is hesitant\nabout efforts to widen the aperture of classical education: \u201cTheir sense is,\nThere\u2019s a list of texts, and these people are not on the list.\u201d The result\ntends to be a Eurocentric notion of the West. \u201cYou have to take a very sharp\nscalpel to the world to carve out Africa, the Middle East, and Asia in order\nto get the version that they want to call \u2018Western\u2019 and \u2018classical,\u2019 \u201d Parham\nargued. Homer talks about Ethiopians. Herodotus tells tales from Asia and\nAfrica. Aquinas engaged with Islamic scholarship. But \u201cwe\u2019re not educated in\nthat tradition,\u201d Parham said.\n\nI first encountered Parham in September, when the CLT\u2019s board of advisers held\na summit in Annapolis, Maryland, at St. John\u2019s College. Men and women in\nbrightly colored preppy dress milled around before the first activity of the\nday: croquet lessons. The scene, complete with a nearby lemonade table, felt\nlike the most extreme possible caricature of what people who venerate the\nclassics would do for fun. (Then again, the next day\u2019s activity was sailing.)\nThe impresario of the croquet field was Jeremy Tate, the C.E.O. of the CLT. He\nschmoozed his way through the small pack of players in a blue summer suit, his\nblond bangs carefully tousled with gel. He was riding a high: last fall,\nFlorida\u2019s board of governors agreed to let students use the CLT to apply to\nstate universities and scholarship programs, significantly increasing its\nnumber of test-takers. (That number is still minuscule compared to those who\ntake the SAT.)\n\nAs one might expect, the CLT is heavy on classic texts\u2014one practice exam uses\nexcerpts from the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Federalist Papers to test reading\ncomprehension. But, despite the exam being promoted by conservatives like\nDeSantis, the sharpest critique that the CLT\u2019s founders make is not about\npolitics but about high-stakes testing\u2014a critique typically associated with\nprogressives. Tate told me that the College Board, which makes the SAT, is\ncynical and career-focussed. \u201cThe point of education was always the\npreservation of civilization,\u201d Tate said. \u201cIt was the cultivation of virtue.\u201d\nTo Tate, this includes the kind of learning that can never be fully measured\nby a test, such as an appreciation for poetry or theatre. According to Tate,\npolicymakers in other red states are interested in following Florida\u2019s lead by\noffering the CLT. But when Republicans ask if he wants them to promote the\nexam, he told me, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to say, \u2018Not really,\u2019 because your being a\nchampion of this would further politically hijack it.\u201d\n\nTate represents a common figure in the classical-education world: a\ndispositionally conservative guy who is also adamant that classical education\nis not right-wing. He acknowledged that the movement has a natural\nconstituency on the right, among parents who are panicked about wokeism. But\n\u201cit\u2019s not enough to get some of the ideas out that you consider toxic,\u201d Tate\nsaid. \u201cYou need a bigger vision for education.\u201d Besides, the G.O.P. has its\nown utilitarian tendencies when it comes to schooling, which are out of step\nwith classical education. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long ago that you had Marco Rubio on\nnational television making fun of philosophy majors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird\nmoment, where this kind of education would be championed on the right.\u201d\n\nThe right\u2019s suspicion of identity politics has also made conversations about\ndiversity difficult. One of the questions that Parham and the other CLT board\nmembers considered during their reassessment of the authors on the test was\nwhether more nonwhite or non-male thinkers should be included, prompting one\nboard member to complain that \u201cthe CLT was going woke.\u201d Parham expressed\nfrustration with this kind of attitude. \u201cThere are people who really love\nclassical education, but they are really hungry for \u2018How do we weave together\na more diverse tapestry?\u2019 Does it all have to be Greece and Rome and European\nauthors?\u201d she said. \u201cThat is very different than saying, \u2018We just want\ndiversity for diversity\u2019s sake.\u2019 \u201d Parham thinks that kids, and especially\nkids who are not white, would benefit from learning about the crossroads of\nthe Mediterranean back before modern notions of racial hierarchy existed. But\nit\u2019s challenging to find an audience for this argument in America\u2019s polarized\nculture. \u201cLeft academia is not helping us,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are pushing back\nagainst some of the extremes of that. They are fleeing to classical education,\nunfortunately, thinking it\u2019s going to be a safe space. But it\u2019s all very\nwrongheaded.\u201d\n\nThe tricky thing about truth, beauty, and goodness is that, for all their\nsupposed timelessness and objectivity, not everyone agrees on what is actually\ntrue, beautiful, and good. As the classical-education movement grows, it must\ncontend with the fundamental question of pluralism: Does the movement\u2019s notion\nof truth keep out not only certain texts but certain children?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a shelter dog. We don\u2019t know much about his past.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Victoria Roberts\n\nLink copied\n\nDoug Wilson, the A.C.C.S. founder, who is often credited with repopularizing\nclassical education, is a difficult figurehead for a movement that wishes to\nbe inclusive. He maintains a \u201cControversy Library\u201d on his blog, which includes\nan account of the outrage over his now retracted pamphlet \u201cSouthern Slavery as\nIt Was,\u201d in which he described slavery as \u201cproducing in the South a genuine\naffection between the races that we believe we can say has never existed in\nany nation before the War or since.\u201d (Wilson says the pamphlet was retracted\nbecause of citation problems.) He believes that it is not possible to have a\ntruly classical education without Christianity. This is a common view, even\namong leaders of the Society for Classical Learning, a more moderate\nalternative to the A.C.C.S. that de\u00ebmphasizes \u201cculture war\u201d in favor of\n\u201cculture care\u201d\u2014inviting people into the movement, rather than policing its\nborders.\n\nFor people like Susan Wise Bauer, the co-author of \u201cThe Well-Trained Mind,\u201d\nthe idea that there\u2019s something fundamentally conservative or Christian about\nclassical education is ahistorical and myopic. A specific type of person tends\nto dominate the classical speaker circuit, she told me: the \u201ctheo bro,\u201d which\nshe defined as a \u201cconservative Protestant-theology fan who likes to smoke\ncigars, drink whiskey, talk theology, and has a beard.\u201d She sees herself as\nspeaking for a much broader, more diverse constituency, including Jews,\nMuslims, atheists, and \u201cliberal, pinko, Marxists\u201d who love classical\neducation. If she and Doug Wilson were discussing the classical approach, she\nadded, \u201cwe\u2019d probably both agree on the importance of teaching grammar, but I\ndon\u2019t know that we\u2019d have much in common, other than that.\u201d Kevin Hall, the\nC.E.O. of the Charter School Growth Fund, told me that he sees a particular\nhunger for classical education among parents who are not religious, and who\nmay find comfort in a public charter school that can partner with them in\ndeveloping their kids\u2019 character.\n\nBy law, classical charter schools are secular, because they are publicly\nfunded. The largest network is Great Hearts, which has twenty-eight thousand\nstudents across its schools in Arizona, Texas, and Louisiana, with fifteen\nthousand more students on its waiting lists. Daniel Scoggin, one of the Great\nHearts co-founders, told me that it wasn\u2019t hard to arrive at a version of\nclassical education that was appropriate for a public charter school. \u201cYou\ntake out the theology,\u201d he said. \u201cYou keep a focus on the Greeks, keep a focus\non the classics, the great American tradition as the capstone to the classical\nstory.\u201d Doug Ducey, the former governor of Arizona, who helped push through a\nsignificant expansion of charter-school funding, told me that he sent his sons\nto Catholic school, \u201cbut if Jack, Joe, and Sam Ducey were in kindergarten\ntoday I would be trying to enroll them in Great Hearts.\u201d\n\nAlthough networks like Great Hearts and Brilla have attracted many families,\nsome parents find the ideas associated with the movement alienating. The\nArchdiocese of Portland is one of many Catholic dioceses that is slowly\nincorporating elements of classical education into its schools. But this\ntransition has become mixed up with sensitive issues of identity, including\nthe place of gay and trans kids and families in the Church. The archbishop,\nAlexander Sample, recently released guidelines on \u201cdealing with gender\nissues,\u201d instructing Catholic institutions, including schools, not to support\ngender transitions in any way. At least one group of parents protested, but\nthey say their concerns were ignored.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at those who are promoting the classical-education model, there\nhave been a lot of red flags,\u201d Charlene Hannibal, one of the parents,\nexplained. \u201cThe main thing that concerns me is the lack of acceptance for\ntrans youth and L.G.B.T.Q. families and children.\u201d Elias Moo, the\nArchdiocese\u2019s new superintendent, told me, \u201cIt does no one any favors if we\ntry to sugarcoat or water down what the Church teaches.\u201d This includes the\nfaith\u2019s understanding that humans are created as male or female. \u201cWe will\nhonor the primacy of parents to such an extent that we\u2019re willing to recognize\nwhen a parent says, \u2018This isn\u2019t the best environment for our child,\u2019 \u201d he\nsaid. In classical schools, inclusion isn\u2019t necessarily the highest virtue.\n\nThere can be a sense of urgency in the classical-education world\u2014a feeling\nthat whole generations have been lost, and that the next must be saved. In\nJanuary, I visited a new classical school on the Upper East Side where that\nfeeling was acute. The school is called Emet Classical Academy; emet means\n\u201ctruth\u201d in Hebrew. Plans for Emet had been in the works for over a year, but\nafter Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th Emet\u2019s leaders decided to open the\nschool on an accelerated timeline. Two mothers\u2014both well-dressed,\nprofessional-class women\u2014took me on a tour of the Conservative synagogue\nwhere, beginning this fall, students will learn about their place in the\nWestern tradition. It will be a contained world of study; classroom windows\nlook out onto a brick wall.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is really about antisemitism,\u201d one of the moms, who asked not to\nbe named, told me. \u201cAfter October 7th, it became abundantly clear that unless\nmy child is in a safe space, like a Jewish school, there is opportunity for\nantisemitic rhetoric.\u201d The other mom said that she worries about sending her\nkids to college unprepared for an onslaught of criticism of Jews, and of\nIsrael: \u201cWhatever the antisemitism du jour is in five years, I realized over\nthe last few months that it\u2019s my responsibility as a Jewish parent to make\nsure they\u2019re prepared to respond to it.\u201d So much of New York City schooling is\nabout helping students understand their identity, she added, \u201cand that\u2019s all\nexcellent. But most schools don\u2019t include Judaism or Zionism in those aspects\nthat they seek to develop in the kids.\u201d\n\nThis is the pitch that Emet is making: through a classical education, students\ncan become confident in themselves as Jews, and as Americans. As much as the\nproject is intended to be countercultural\u2014a fix for what\u2019s wrong with modern\nschooling\u2014it also mirrors modern schooling\u2019s obsession with developing kids\u2019\nsense of identity. Both moms were eager to point out that the school will be\nJewish but not religious, which they see as a plus. Abraham Unger, the head of\nthe school, told me that every morning the students will say the Pledge of\nAllegiance and sing \u201cHatikvah,\u201d the Israeli national anthem, but there will be\nno mandatory prayers, and kids will not be expected to learn how to\nparticipate in synagogue services. Most of the families who have expressed\ninterest in Emet are not from traditionally observant backgrounds, and their\nkids are not coming out of religious Jewish day schools. They\u2019re parents like\nthe two moms I met. This moment in history has shaken something in them.\nThey\u2019re looking for roots.\n\nEmet is a project of the Tikvah Fund, a prominent Jewish foundation chaired by\nElliott Abrams, a neoconservative fixture who served in the Reagan, George W.\nBush, and Trump Administrations. Eric Cohen, Tikvah\u2019s C.E.O., told me that he\nhopes Emet will eventually be a model for dozens of schools around the\ncountry, including existing Jewish day schools. He also wants to start a\nJewish classical-education version of Teach for America.\n\n\u201cThe Jews were summoned in history to have a kind of purpose,\u201d Cohen said.\n\u201cJews brought certain ideas and ways of understanding reality into the world:\nthat humans are both created and commanded. That we\u2019re covenantal beings that\nhave a responsibility in shaping history. That there\u2019s a moral vision of life\nthat\u2019s articulated in the Jewish tradition that has wisdom and relevance for\nall human beings.\u201d To him, the story of Jewish civilization is fundamentally\nWestern, and the story of Western civilization is fundamentally Jewish. \u201cThe\nWest is Greco-Roman culture recast through a Jewish lens,\u201d he said. The goal\nof Emet is to cultivate students \u201cwho can enter the world with that\ncivilizational vision\u2014those habits of mind and heart and leadership and\ncharacter that classical learning at its best can shape\u2014for deeply Jewish\npurposes.\u201d\n\nSo far, Cohen said, the school has been welcomed into the Christian-dominated\nclassical-education movement. The movement\u2019s leaders don\u2019t necessarily agree\nwith Cohen\u2019s interpretation of history or his high view of Jewish texts,\nthough. I asked David Goodwin why students in A.C.C.S. schools don\u2019t learn\nHebrew\u2014the language of the Old Testament, and the lingua franca of the rabbis\nwho, according to Cohen, helped shape the West. \u201cThe Hebrew tradition is one\nof authority and law, which we study,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cBut the emphasis is on\nthe Greek and Roman tradition, which is one of persuasion and logic. There\u2019s\nmore there to study\u2014in the Greek, it\u2019s a deeper pool.\u201d Plus, he added, Hebrew\nis too hard for most high schoolers to learn.\n\nNothing is more classical than Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave, which is really a\nstory about education: how human beings emerge from ignorance and discover\ntruth. In the story, humans are prisoners chained up in a dark chamber, facing\na wall. They believe that the shadows on the wall represent the world. Then\none day a prisoner makes his way out into the light. He is blinded by the sun,\nbut eventually his eyes adjust. He goes back into the cave to persuade the\nothers to come out. But his eyes no longer work in the darkness; all the\nprisoners see is a blind man, and they assume that leaving the cave is\npointless.\n\nThere\u2019s a sly tension in the allegory. Plato clearly believes that it\u2019s better\nto live in the light and know the truth. But he also acknowledges that a\nperson can be blinded in two ways, both as they\u2019re emerging from the cave and\nagain as they\u2019re returning to it. It can be difficult to know which direction\nleads to the truth. Even Plato\u2019s fanboys might get lost on their way. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the March 18, 2024, issue, with the headline\n\u201cOld School.\u201d\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nEmma Green is a staff writer at The New Yorker who covers education and\nacademia.\n\n### Weekly\n\nEnjoy our flagship newsletter as a digest delivered once a week.\n\nRead More\n\nArs Longa\n\nA Matisse by the Tool Drawer\n\nPhyllis Hattis, who lived with the late MOMA curator William Rubin in art-\ncrammed adjoining apartments (his was rent-controlled), gives a tour, hammer\nin hand.\n\nBy Zach Helfand\n\nAnnals of Education\n\nThe Meltdown at a Middle School in a Liberal Town\n\nA post-pandemic fight about racism, the respectful treatment of trans kids,\nand the role of teachers\u2019 unions has divided Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nBy Jessica Winter\n\nDeath Valley Postcard\n\nThe Death Valley Lake That\u2019s Gone in a Flash\n\nLake Manly forms in Badwater Basin only after especially heavy rains.
