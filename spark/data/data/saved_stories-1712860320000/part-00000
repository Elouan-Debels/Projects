You can only work in Cosmigo Pro Motion\n(https://www.cosmigo.com/pixel_animation_software) or few other\nprograms/libraries that support BMFs (see the ?page=support) or, at each\nindividual font page, you can output the text you want using the tryout input\nfield, and then work with it as with an image.  \n2024-03-10 15:56:52| General discussion| quatricise| Does anybody know how to\nuse BMF fonts on windows 11? I kind of need to install some of these fonts and\nI have no idea how. It isn't recognized by the system by default.  \n2024-02-14 02:39:24| xenon2| admin| Besides Xenon ][ this font was used in the\ntitle of a short film called \"Pixels\" (2010) -\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt1635656/  \n2024-02-13 21:14:36| General discussion| admin| bzt: Thank you very much!
