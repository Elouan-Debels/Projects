There\u2019s only one problem: it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBy David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of\nexperience covering consumer tech.

See\nour ethics statement.\n\nThe idea behind the Humane AI Pin is a simple one: it\u2019s a phone without a\nscreen. Instead of asking you to open apps and tap on a keyboard, this little\nwearable abstracts everything away behind an AI assistant and an operating\nsystem Humane calls CosmOS. Want to make a phone call, send a text message,\ncalculate the tip, write something down, or learn the population of\nCopenhagen? Just ask the AI Pin. It uses a cellular connection (only through\nT-Mobile and, annoyingly, not connected to your existing number) to be online\nall the time and a network of AI models to try to answer your questions and\nexecute your commands. It\u2019s not just an app; it\u2019s all the apps.\n\nHumane has spent the last year making the case that the AI Pin is the\nbeginning of a post-smartphone future in which we spend less time with our\nheads and minds buried in the screens of our phones and more time back in the\nreal world. How that might work, whether that\u2019s something we want, and whether\nit\u2019s even possible feel like fundamental questions for the future of our\nrelationship with technology.\n\nI came into this review with two big questions about the AI Pin. The first is\nthe big-picture one: is this thing... anything? In just shy of two weeks of\ntesting, I\u2019ve come to realize that there are, in fact, a lot of things for\nwhich my phone actually sucks. Often, all I want to do is check the time or\nwrite something down or text my wife, and I end up sucked in by TikTok or my\nemail or whatever unwanted notification is sitting there on my screen. Plus,\nhave you ever thought about how often your hands are occupied with groceries /\nclothes / leashes / children / steering wheels, and how annoying / unsafe it\nis to try to balance your phone at the same time? I\u2019ve learned I do lots of\nthings on my phone that I might like to do somewhere else. So, yeah, this is\nsomething. Maybe something big. AI models aren\u2019t good enough to handle\neverything yet, but I\u2019ve seen enough glimmers of what\u2019s coming that I\u2019m\noptimistic about the future.\n\nThat raises the second question: should you buy this thing? That one\u2019s easy.\nNope. Nuh-uh. No way. The AI Pin is an interesting idea that is so thoroughly\nunfinished and so totally broken in so many unacceptable ways that I can\u2019t\nthink of anyone to whom I\u2019d recommend spending the $699 for the device and the\n$24 monthly subscription.\n\n\u201cAI Pin and its AI OS, Cosmos, are about beginning the story of ambient\ncomputing,\u201d Humane\u2019s co-founders, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, told\nme in a statement after I described some of the issues I\u2019ve had with the AI\nPin. \u201cToday marks not the first chapter, but the first page. We have an\nambitious roadmap with software refinements, new features, additional\npartnerships, and our SDK. All of this will enable your AI Pin to become\nsmarter and more powerful over time. Our vision is for Cosmos to eventually\nexist in many different devices and form factors, to unlock new ways to\ninteract with all of your devices.\u201d\n\nAs the overall state of AI improves, the AI Pin will probably get better, and\nI\u2019m bullish on AI\u2019s long-term ability to do a lot of fiddly things on our\nbehalf. But there are too many basic things it can\u2019t do, too many things it\ndoesn\u2019t do well enough, and too many things it does well but only sometimes\nthat I\u2019m hard-pressed to name a single thing it\u2019s genuinely good at. None of\nthis \u2014 not the hardware, not the software, not even GPT-4 \u2014 is ready yet.\n\n4Verge Score\n\n## Humane AI Pin\n\n$699\n\n### The Good\n\nWell-made device\n\nPhotos look pretty good\n\nMuch easier to access than your phone\n\n### The Bad\n\nJust doesn\u2019t work half the time\n\nReally slow even when it does work\n\nMissing way too many basic things\n\n$699 at Humane\n\nHow we rate and review products\n\n### Front and center\n\nAs a piece of gear, the AI Pin is actually pretty impressive. It\u2019s smaller\nthan you might think: roughly the size of four quarters laid in a square, or\nhalf the size of a pack of Orbit gum. It\u2019s not heavy (about 55 grams,\naccording to my scale \u2014 roughly the same as two AA batteries or the key fob to\nmy car), but it\u2019s definitely solid, made of aluminum and designed to survive\nfalls or even the occasional trip through the washing machine. My review unit\nis white, but the AI Pin also comes in black. Both look and feel much better\nthan your average first-gen hardware product.\n\nThe AI Pin\u2019s designed location is right above your chest, where either hand\ncan reach it.\n\nThe bar here is high, though, because of how you\u2019re meant to use the AI Pin.\nIn all of Humane\u2019s demos and marketing, the AI Pin sits in the same place: on\nthe right or left side of your chest, right below your collarbone, attached\nvia a magnet that also acts as a \u201cbattery booster.\u201d It\u2019s a pin on a lapel.\n(It\u2019s a little fiddly to get situated, but the magnet does hold through all\nbut the thickest of clothes.) You don\u2019t have to use it this way \u2014 you can hold\nit in your hand or even talk to it while it\u2019s in its desk charger \u2014 but the AI\nPin\u2019s built-in microphones are designed to hear you best from that angle; the\nslightly downward-facing camera sees best from there, and the upward-firing\nspeakers work best in that spot.\n\nThe AI Pin is also just incredibly unsubtle. When you stand in front of a\nbuilding, tapping your chest and nattering away to yourself, people will\nnotice. And everything gets in the way, too. My backpack straps rubbed against\nit, and my messenger bag went right over it. Both my son and my dog have\naccidentally set the AI Pin off while climbing on top of me. If you buy this\nthing, I recommend also buying the $50 clip that makes it easier to attach to\na waistband or a bag strap, where I actually prefer to keep it.\n\nHumane makes a bunch of accessories for the AI Pin \u2014 that black clip is\nparticularly handy.\n\nThe upside of sticking it on your chest is that you can reach it with either\nhand (I call the moves \u201cThe Pledge of Allegiance\u201d and \u201cThe Backpack Strap\nGrab\u201d), and even a spare pinkie is enough to wake it up. Anytime you want to\ntalk to the AI Pin, you press and hold on its front touchpad \u2014 it\u2019s not\nlistening for a wake word \u2014 and speak your questions or commands. Practically\nanything the AI Pin can do, you can ask for. It can answer basic ChatGPT-style\nquestions, make phone calls, snap photos, send text messages, tell you what\u2019s\nnearby, and more. You can also do a few things just by tapping the touchpad,\nlike keyboard shortcuts on a computer: double-tap with two fingers to take a\nphoto; double-tap and hold with two fingers to take a video.\n\nHaving the thing right there did make me use it more, sometimes for things I\nwouldn\u2019t have bothered to pull out my phone to do. It feels a little like the\nearly days of Alexa and Siri a decade ago, when you discovered that saying\n\u201cset a timer for 10 minutes\u201d beats opening your phone\u2019s Clock app by a mile \u2014\nand you can do it with sticky fingers, too.\n\nExcept, oh wait, the AI Pin can\u2019t set an alarm or a timer. It can\u2019t add things\nto your calendar, either, or tell you what\u2019s already there. You can create\nnotes and lists \u2014 which appear in the Humane Center web app that is also where\nyou connect the device to your contacts and review your uploaded photos \u2014 but\nif you try to add something to the list later, it\u2019ll almost always fail for\nsome reason. The problem with so many voice assistants is that they can\u2019t do\nmuch \u2014 and the AI Pin can do even less.\n\nHumane has said it\u2019s working on a lot of this functionality, and it\u2019s surely\ntrue that a lot of this will get better over time as AI models and interfaces\nget better. Bongiorno tells me there\u2019s a huge software update coming this\nsummer that will add timers, calendar access, more ways to use the touchpad,\nand much more. But at The Verge, our longstanding rule is that we review\nwhat\u2019s in the box, never the promise of future updates, and right now, it\u2019s\ninexcusable that this stuff doesn\u2019t work on a device that costs as much as the\nAI Pin does.\n\nEvery time the AI Pin tries to do seemingly anything, it has to process your\nquery through Humane\u2019s servers, which is at best quite slow and at worst a\ntotal failure. Asking the AI Pin to write down that the library book sale is\nnext week: handy! Waiting for 10 seconds while it processes, processes, and\nthen throws a generic \u201ccouldn\u2019t add that\u201d error message: less handy. I\u2019d\nestimate that half the time I tried to call someone, it simply didn\u2019t call.\nHalf the time someone called me, the AI Pin would kick it straight to\nvoicemail without even ringing. After many days of testing, the one and only\nthing I can truly rely on the AI Pin to do is tell me the time.\n\nThe one and only thing I can truly rely on the AI Pin to do is tell me the\ntime\n\nThe more I tested the AI Pin, the more it felt like the device was trying to\ndo an awful lot and the hardware simply couldn\u2019t keep up. For one, it\u2019s pretty\nmuch constantly warm. In my testing, it never got truly painfully hot, but\nafter even a few minutes of using it, I could feel the battery like a hand\nwarmer against my skin. Bongiorno says the warmth can come from overuse or\nwhen you have a bad signal and that the device is aggressive about shutting\ndown when it gets too hot. I\u2019ve noticed: I use the AI Pin for more than a\ncouple of minutes, and I get notified that it has overheated and needs to cool\ndown. This happened a lot in my testing (including on a spring weekend in DC\nand in 40-degree New York City, where it was the only warm thing in sight).\n\nThe battery life is similarly rough. The AI Pin ships with two battery\nboosters, a charging case, and a desk charger, and you\u2019ll make heavy use of\nall of it. I went through both boosters and the AI Pin\u2019s smaller internal\nbattery in the course of just a few hours of heavy testing. At one point, the\nAI Pin and a booster went from fully charged to completely dead in five hours,\nall while sitting untouched in my backpack. This thing is trying to do an\nawful lot, and it just doesn\u2019t seem able to keep up.\n\nIn fairness, you\u2019re not meant to use this device a lot. The whole point of the\nAI Pin is to get in, get out, and go back to living your life without\ntechnology. On my lightest days of testing \u2014 which typically consisted of a\ncouple of calls, a few texts, a half-dozen queries about the number of\nteaspoons in a tablespoon and whether it\u2019s safe for dogs to eat grapes, and\nmaybe a half-hour of music \u2014 I didn\u2019t have many overheating issues, though the\nbattery did still die well before the day ended. As long as you don\u2019t use the\nprojector too much, the AI Pin can muddle through. But if I\u2019m going to pay\nthis price and stick this thing so prominently on my body, it needs to do more\nthan muddle.\n\nThe AI Pin\u2019s projector is the closest thing it has to a screen.\n\n### Look but don\u2019t touch\n\nThe closest thing the AI Pin has to a screen is its \u201cLaser Ink\u201d projector. You\nsummon it by tapping once on the touchpad or by asking it to \u201cshow me\u201d\nsomething. If the AI Pin is speaking something to you aloud, you can also pick\nup your hand, and it will switch to projecting the text instead. The projector\nis also how you access settings, unlock your device, and more.\n\nWhenever it wants to project, the AI Pin first sends a green dot looking for\nyour hand. (It will only project on a hand, so my dream of projecting all my\ntexts onto the sides of buildings is sadly dead.) After a few minutes, I\nmemorized the sweet spot: about ribcage-high and a few inches away from my\nbody. The projector\u2019s 720p resolution is crap, and it only projects green\nlight, but it does a good-enough job of projecting text onto your hand unless\nyou\u2019re in bright light, and then it\u2019s just about invisible.\n\nI figured out the hand placement pretty fast \u2014 but not the actual interface.\n\nThe projector\u2019s user interface is \u2014 how can I put this nicely? \u2014 bananas. To\nunlock your device, which you have to do every time you magnetically reattach\nthe AI Pin, you move your hand forward and backward through a series of\nnumbers and then pinch your thumb and forefinger together to select a number.\nIt feels a bit like sliding a tiny trombone. Once you\u2019re unlocked, you see a\nhomescreen of sorts, where you can see if you\u2019ve gotten any recent texts or\ncalls and tap your fingers through a menu of the time, the date, and the\nweather. To scroll, you tilt your hand forward and backward very slightly. To\nget to settings, you move your hand away from your body \u2014 but not too far, or\nthe projector loses you \u2014 until a new radial menu comes up. To navigate that\nmenu, you\u2019re supposed to roll your hand around like there\u2019s a marble in your\npalm. I swear to you, I never once managed to select the correct icon the\nfirst time. It\u2019s way too many interaction systems to memorize, especially when\nnone of them work very well.\n\nIt feels like Humane decided early on that the AI Pin couldn\u2019t have a screen\nno matter what and did a bunch of product and interface gymnastics when a tiny\ntouchscreen would have handled all of these things much better. Kudos to\nHumane for swinging big, but if you\u2019re going to try to do phone things, just\nmake a phone.\n\nUsing the AI Pin is to constantly just ask a question and hope for the best.\nWay too often, you get nothing.\n\n### Asked and unanswered\n\nThe single coolest thing I\u2019ve been able to do with the AI Pin is something\nI\u2019ve done a few times now. I stand in front of a store or restaurant, press\nand hold on the touchpad, and say, \u201cLook at this restaurant and tell me if it\nhas good reviews.\u201d The AI Pin snaps a photo with its camera, pings some image\nrecognition models, figures out what I\u2019m looking at, scours the web for\nreviews, and returns it back. Tacombi has great reviews, it might say. People\nreally like the tacos and the friendly staff.\n\nThat\u2019s the best-case scenario. And I have experienced it a few times! It\u2019s\nvery neat, and it\u2019s the sort of thing that would take much longer and many\nmore steps on a smartphone. But far more often, I\u2019ll stand in front of a\nrestaurant, ask the AI Pin about it, and wait for what feels like forever only\nfor it to fail entirely. It can\u2019t find the restaurant; the servers are not\nresponding; it can\u2019t figure out what restaurant it is despite the gigantic\n\u201cJoe & The Juice\u201d sign four feet in front of me and the GPS chip in the\ndevice. Bongiorno says these issues can come from model hallucinations, server\nissues, and more, and that they\u2019ll get better over time.\n\nIn general, I would say that for every successful interaction with the AI Pin,\nI\u2019ve had three or four unsuccessful ones. I\u2019ll ask the weather in New York and\nget the right answer; then, I\u2019ll ask the weather in Dubai, and the AI Pin\ntells me that \u201cthe current weather in Dubai is not available for the provided\nuser location in New York.\u201d I\u2019ll ask about \u201cthe thing with the presidents in\nSouth Dakota,\u201d and it\u2019ll correctly tell me I mean Mount Rushmore, but then it\nwill confidently misidentify the Brooklyn Bridge as the Triborough Bridge. And\nhalf the time \u2014 seriously, at least half \u2014 I don\u2019t even get an answer. The\nsystem just waits, and waits, and fails.\n\nWhen I first started testing the AI Pin, I was excited to try it as a music\nplayer. I dream of going on walks or runs while leaving my phone at home, and\nthe always-connected AI Pin seemed like a possible answer. It\u2019s not. For one\nthing, it only connects with Tidal, which means most people are immediately\nruled out and also means no podcast support. For another, that connection is\nas broken as anything else on the AI Pin: I ask to play Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s new album or\n\u201csongs by The 1975,\u201d and the AI Pin either can\u2019t connect to Tidal at all or\ncan\u2019t play the song I\u2019m looking for. Sometimes it works fine! Way more often,\nI have interactions like this one:\n\n  * Me: \u201cPlay \u2018Texas Hold \u2019Em\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n  * The AI Pin: \u201cSongs not found for request: Play Texas Hold \u2019Em by Beyonc\\u00e9. Try again using your actions find a relevant track, album, artist, or playlist; Create a new PlayMusic action with at least one of the slots filled in. If you find a relevant track or album play it, avoid asking for clarification or what they want to hear.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a real exchange I had, multiple times, over multiple days with the AI\nPin. Bongiorno says this particular bug has been fixed, but I still can\u2019t get\nTidal to play Cowboy Carter consistently. It\u2019s just broken.\n\nYou can talk to the AI Pin all you want \u2014 but there\u2019s no telling what you\u2019ll\nget back.\n\nIt\u2019s all made worse by the AI Pin\u2019s desire to be as clever as possible.\nTranslation is one of its most hyped features, along with the fact that it\nsupposedly automatically discerns which languages to translate. When you land\nin Spain, boom, it switches to Spanish. Super cool and futuristic, in theory.\nIn reality, I spent an hour in our studio trying desperately to get the AI Pin\nto translate to Japanese or Korean, while The Verge\u2019s Victoria Song \u2014 who\nspeaks both \u2014 sat there talking to it in those languages to absolutely no\navail. Rather than translate things, it would just say them back to her, in a\nhorrible and occasionally almost mocking accent.\n\nThe language issues are indicative of the bigger problem facing the AI Pin,\nChatGPT, and frankly, every other AI product out there: you can\u2019t see how it\nworks, so it\u2019s impossible to figure out how to use it. AI boosters say that\u2019s\nthe point, that the tech just works and you shouldn\u2019t have to know how to use\nit, but oh boy, is that not the world we live in. Meanwhile, our phones are\nconstant feedback machines \u2014 colored buttons telling us what to tap, instant\nactivity every time we touch or pinch or scroll. You can see your options and\nwhat happens when you pick one. With AI, you don\u2019t get any of that. Using the\nAI Pin feels like wishing on a star: you just close your eyes and hope for the\nbest. Most of the time, nothing happens.\n\nUsing the AI Pin feels like wishing on a star: you just close your eyes and\nhope for the best\n\nStill, even after all this frustration, after spending hours standing in front\nof restaurants tapping my chest and whispering questions that go unanswered, I\nfind I want what Humane is selling even more than I expected. A one-tap way to\nsay, \u201cText Anna and tell her I\u2019ll be home in a half-hour,\u201d or \u201cRemember to\ncall Mike tomorrow afternoon,\u201d or \u201cTake a picture of this and add it to my\nshopping list\u201d would be amazing. I hadn\u2019t realized how much of my phone usage\nconsists of these one-step things, all of which would be easier and faster\nwithout the friction and distraction of my phone.\n\nBut the AI Pin doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know how else to say it.\n\nI hope Humane keeps going. I hope it builds in this basic functionality and\nfigures out how to do more of it locally on the device without killing the\nbattery. I hope it gets faster and more reliable. I hope Humane decides to\nmake a watch, or smart glasses, or something more deliberately designed to be\nheld in your hand. I hope it partners with more music services, more\nproductivity apps, and more sources of knowledge about the internet and the\nworld. I hope the price goes down.\n\nBut until all of that happens, and until the whole AI universe gets better,\nfaster, and more functional, the AI Pin isn\u2019t going to feel remotely close to\nbeing done. It\u2019s a beta test, a prototype, a proof of concept that maybe\nsomeday there might be a killer device that does all of these things. I know\nwith absolute certainty that the AI Pin is not that device. It\u2019s not worth\n$700, or $24 a month, or all the time and energy and frustration that using it\nrequires. It\u2019s an exciting idea and an infuriating product.\n\nAI gadgets might one day be great. But this isn\u2019t that day, and the AI Pin\nisn\u2019t that product. I\u2019ll take my phone back now, thanks.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## Which M2 is right for you?
