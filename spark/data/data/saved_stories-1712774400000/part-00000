In this paper, we examine if selected\n> interpretability methods originally designed for transformer language models\n> will transfer to these up-and-coming recurrent architectures. Specifically,\n> we focus on steering model outputs via contrastive activation addition, on\n> eliciting latent predictions via the tuned lens, and eliciting latent\n> knowledge from models fine-tuned to produce false outputs under certain\n> conditions. Our results show that most of these techniques are effective\n> when applied to RNNs, and we show that it is possible to improve some of\n> them by taking advantage of RNNs' compressed state.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.05971 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.05971v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Nora Belrose [view email] [v1] Tue, 9 Apr 2024 02:59:17 UTC (4,990 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Does Transformer Interpretability Transfer to\nRNNs?, by Gon\\c{c}alo Paulo and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
