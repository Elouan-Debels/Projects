Language is at the core of these innovations, and the EU \u2014\na Tower of Babel with 24 official languages, from Lithuanian to Maltese \u2014\nwants the booming tech to click with its own cultural content and quirks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMark Twain should not erase Stendhal,\u201d France\u2019s Economy Minister Bruno Le\nMaire said at a tech event in Cannes in February. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to settle\njust for English ... Going ahead, we don\u2019t want our language to be weakened by\nalgorithms and AI systems.\u201d\n\nThe United States lead the current wave of innovations. The country boasts\namong its ranks ChatGPT maker OpenAI \u2014 and its large backer, Microsoft \u2014 and\nGoogle with its Gemini model. Anthropic, Meta and Elon Musk's xAI are also in\nthe race to build leading models.\n\nThe speed of the U.S. industry has made European governments anxious. They\nfear a repeat of the dominance that American firms had in the age of social\nmedia and Web 2.0.\n\nFrom academic ventures to government-sponsored masterplans to startups and\nhardscrabble teams of independent coders, the Continent is putting up a fight\nagainst the Californian behemoths. In the last year alone, 13 European\ncountries have announced or taken steps to develop local models focused on\ntheir local languages, POLITICO research has found.\n\nMost of the existing or developing projects are open-source, in a bid to make\nup for the computing and funding gaps with the U.S. by relying on a vast\ncommunity of volunteer developers.\n\nWith the bustle comes the hope to create a vibrant local AI economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHaving models in the local language is also about encouraging more people in\nyour country to code and develop more AI products,\u201d said Carlos Romero Dupl\u00e1,\na former Spanish diplomat who negotiated the EU\u2019s AI law and is now a\nBrussels-based consultant with Vinces. \u201cIt fosters a whole tech ecosystem.\u201d\n\nFor some countries, like Spain, own-language models could help boost their\nclout in culturally and historically connected parts of the world. Madrid,\nwhich is funding the creation of an LLM able to speak Spanish based on a\ncorpus of high-quality Spanish content for AI training, sees the emerging\ntechnology as an area for closer cooperation with Ibero-American countries.\n\nThe scramble for own-language LLMs comes as the cultural industry is in a\nfierce \u2014 and, some say, existential \u2014 fight with tech companies over cultural\ncontent including film scripts, media archives and even the copyright over\nmusical artists\u2019 voice imprints.\n\nIn past months OpenAI has been busy cutting deals with international media\nbrands like Axel Springer, the owner of German-language outlets Bild and Welt\n(which also owns POLITICO) and French daily Le Monde, building a trove of\nhigh-quality training content in foreign languages.\n\nIn his speech, Bruno Le Maire pitched the creation of a price-controlled European single market for training data. | Mathilde Kaczkowski/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe maneuver set off alarm bells in France. In his Cannes speech, Le Maire\npitched the creation of a price-controlled European single market for training\ndata to prevent deep-pocketed U.S. tech giants from outbidding European AI\ncompanies for access to every last scrap of valuable content.\n\nFrance has also spearheaded the creation of Alt-EDIC, a 12-country EU\nconsortium devoted to intra-bloc collaboration on developing LLMs in European\nlanguages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Lost in translation\n\nIronically, to be truly competitive, European LLMs will still need to be\nfluent in English \u2014 which remains the language of most of the world\u2019s\nscientific papers, and just over half of the pages on the world wide web,\naccording to online surveys outfit W3Techs.\n\n\u201cThere's a power imbalance in terms of the amount and quality of training\ndata: just look at how large English Wikipedia is compared to its versions in\nother languages,\u201d said Sebastian Ruder, a research scientist at Canada-based\nmultilingual AI company Cohere.\n\nSome U.S.-made LLMs are conversant in languages other than English, but they\ndo not always have the proficiency and nuance needed to serve local users\nwell.\n\n\u201cYou need, for instance, to get the right level of politeness,\u201c Ruder said.\nThink of teaching a chatbot to use the polite pronoun \u201cvous\u201d instead of the\ninformal \u201ctu\u201d to avoid miffing an elderly French user.\n\nFor chatbots designed to interact in whole conversations with everyone from a\ncountry\u2019s citizens to a company\u2019s clients, that can create problems. An August\n2023 \u201ccultural alignment\u201d assessment by researchers at University College\nLondon found OpenAI\u2019s and Google\u2019s LLMs to be out of whack with cultural norms\nin countries including China, Saudi Arabia and Slovakia \u2014 while acing tests\nfor adherence to U.S. mores.\n\nAs AI becomes entrenched in every aspect of our societies, the impact of such\ncultural clashes could be significant. Kris Shrishak, a technology fellow at\nthe Irish Council for Civil Liberties, said, \u201cA U.S. tech company can train\nits model in, say, Lithuanian, but that's loss-making. So it\u2019d usually train\nit in English and then do some finetuning.\u201d\n\nThe solution, according to Ruder, is for European AI developers to train their\nbots in both their language and English, thus allowing the LLM to tap into\nEnglish-encoded knowledge when speaking its native tongue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Tags\n\nArtificial Intelligence Copyright Data Media Technology\n\nRelated Countries\n\nFrance Spain United States\n\nRelated People\n\nBruno Le Maire\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nGoogle Microsoft\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## UK\u2019s Rishi Sunak issues \u2018fulsome apology\u2019 for ruining Adidas Sambas\n\n46 MINS ago 2 mins read\n\n## EU political parties promise to steer clear of deepfakes ahead of election\n\n4 HRS ago 3 mins read\n\n## On holiday with Europe\u2019s right-wingers\n\n10 HRS ago 15 mins read\n\n## Zelenskyy reveals his Trump playbook: An invitation and a warning\n\n16 HRS ago 7 mins read\n\n## More from Gian Volpicelli\n\n## Inside the shadowy global battle to tame the world\u2019s most dangerous\ntechnology\n\nCan anyone control AI?\n\nMar 26 15 mins read\n\nFOOD REVIEW\n\n## Siendas\n\nQuiet Sardinian eatery with tastemaking ambitions.\n\nMar 21 2 mins read\n\n## European lawmakers rubber-stamp EU\u2019s AI rulebook\n\n\u201cNo \u2018ifs\u2019 and \u2018buts\u2019: these are the rules,\u201d said Romanian liberal MEP.\n\nMar 13 2 mins read\n\n## International AI rights treaty hangs by a thread\n\nCouncil of Europe talks risk collapsing as Washington seeks to exempt\ncompanies from new rules on AI and human rights.\n\nMar 11 4 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": false}
