Simpson later served nine years in a Nevada prison after being\nconvicted in 2008 on 12 counts of armed robbery and kidnapping two sports\nmemorabilia dealers at gunpoint in a Las Vegas hotel.\n\nThe official booking photograph released by the Los Angeles Police department\nshows OJ Simpson as the former professional football star is arrested for\nmurder on June 17, 1994.

He was ordered to surrender to police,\nbut five days after the killings, he fled in his white Ford Bronco with a\nformer teammate \u2013 carrying his passport and a disguise.\n\nA slow-speed chase through the Los Angeles area ended at Simpson\u2019s mansion,\nand he was later charged in the murders.\n\nA white Ford Bronco, driven by Al Cowlings carrying OJ Simpson, is trailed by\nLos Angeles police cars as it travels on a motorway in Los Angeles in June\n1994.

It had everything: a rich celebrity defendant; a black\nman accused of killing his white former wife out of jealousy; a woman murdered\nafter divorcing a man who had beaten her; a \u201cdream team\u201d of pricey and\ncharismatic defence lawyers; and a huge gaffe by prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimpson, who at the outset of the case declared himself \u201cabsolutely 100 per\ncent not guilty\u201d, waved at the jurors and mouthed the words \u201cthank you\u201d after\nthe predominately black panel of 10 women and two men acquitted him on October\n3, 1995.\n\nProsecutors argued that Simpson killed Nicole in a jealous fury, and they\npresented extensive blood, hair and fibre tests linking Simpson to the\nmurders. The defence countered that the celebrity defendant was framed by\nracist white police.\n\nThe trial transfixed America. In the White House, President Bill Clinton left\nthe Oval Office and watched the verdict on his secretary\u2019s television. Many\nblack Americans celebrated his acquittal, seeing Simpson as the victim of\nbigoted police. Many white Americans were appalled by his exoneration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimpson\u2019s legal team included prominent criminal defence lawyers Johnnie\nCochran, Alan Dershowitz and F Lee Bailey, who often outmanoeuvred the\nprosecution.\n\nProsecutors committed a memorable blunder when they directed Simpson to try on\na pair of bloodstained gloves found at the murder scene, confident they would\nfit perfectly and show he was the killer.\n\nRobert Kardashian at OJ Simpson\u2019s murder trial.

They are out there\nsomewhere ... I would not, could not and did not kill anyone.\u201d\n\nOJ Simpson is shown with his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and their children,\ndaughter Sidney Brooke, 9, and son Justin, 6, at the premiere of Simpson\u2019s new\nfilm \u201cNaked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult\u201d, on March 16, 1994.

In 1997, a predominately white jury in Santa\nMonica, California, found Simpson liable for the two deaths and ordered him to\npay US$33.5 million in damages.\n\n\u201cWe finally have justice for Ron and Nicole,\u201d Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman\u2019s\nfather, said after the verdict.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I have to say is it\u2019s just further reminder of Ron being gone\nall these years. It\u2019s no great loss to the world. It\u2019s a further reminder of\nRon\u2019s being gone,\u201d Goldman told NBC News.\n\nSimpson\u2019s \u201cdream team\u201d did not represent him in the civil trial, in which the\nburden of proof was lower than in a criminal trial \u2013 a \u201cpreponderance of the\nevidence\u201d rather than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d.\n\nNew evidence also hurt Simpson, including photographs of him wearing the type\nof shoes that had left bloody footprints at the murder scene.\n\nAfter the civil case, some of Simpson\u2019s belongings, including memorabilia from\nhis football days, were taken and auctioned off to help pay the damages he\nowed.\n\nOn October 3, 2008, exactly 13 years after his acquittal in the murder trial,\nhe was convicted by a Las Vegas jury on charges including kidnapping and armed\nrobbery.\n\nThese stemmed from a 2007 incident at a casino hotel in which Simpson and five\nmen, at least two carrying guns, stole sports memorabilia worth thousands of\ndollars from two dealers.\n\nOJ Simpson listens as a district court judge reads his sentence at the Clark\nCounty Regional Justice Centre in Las Vegas, Nevada on December 5, 2008.\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nSimpson said he was just trying to recover his own property but was sentenced\nto up to 33 years in prison.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody,\u201d Simpson, wearing a blue prison jumpsuit with\nshackles on his legs and wrists, said at his sentencing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was\ndoing anything wrong.\u201d\n\nSimpson was released on parole in 2017 and moved into a gated community in Las\nVegas. He was granted early release from parole in 2021 due to good behaviour\nat age 74.\n\nHis life saga was recounted in the Oscar-winning 2016 documentary O.J.: Made\nin America, as well as various television dramatisations.\n\nOrenthal James Simpson was born in San Francisco on July 9, 1947. He\ncontracted rickets at age 2 and was forced to wear leg braces until he was 5\nbut recovered so thoroughly that he became one of the most celebrated football\nplayers of all time.\n\nDuring nine seasons for the Buffalo Bills and two for the San Francisco 49ers,\nSimpson became one of the greatest ball carriers in NFL history.\n\nIn 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a\nseason. He retired in 1979.\n\nOJ Simpson reacts after being convicted on all charges in his Las Vegas\nkidnapping and robbery trial at the Clark County Regional Justice Centre in\nLas Vegas on October 3, 2008.

Nordberg. \u2018His acting was a lot like his murdering: He got away with\nit, but no one believed him,\u2019\u201d wrote David Zucker, who directed Simpson in two\nNaked Gun films, on social media.\n\nSimpson married his first wife, Marguerite, in 1967, and they had three\nchildren, including one who drowned in the family\u2019s swimming pool at age 2 in\n1979, the year the couple divorced.\n\nSimpson met future wife Nicole Brown when she was a 17-year-old waitress, and\nhe was still married to Marguerite. Simpson and Brown married in 1985 and had\ntwo children.\n\nShe later called the police after incidents in which he struck her. Simpson\npleaded no contest to spousal abuse charges in 1989.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use cookies to tailor your experience and present relevant ads.
