The screen erupts in blue, then a cascade\nof thick, white hexadecimal numbers and cracked language, \"UnusedStk\" and\n\"AllocMem.\" Black screen cedes to blue to white and a pair of scales appear,\ncrossed by a sword, both images drawn in the jagged, bitmapped graphics of\nWindows 1.0-era clip-art\u2014light grey and yellow on a background of light cyan.\nBlue text proclaims, \"God on tap!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is TempleOS V2.17, the welcome screen explains, a \"Public Domain\nOperating System\" produced by Trivial Solutions of Las Vegas, Nevada. It\ngreets the user with a riot of 16-color, scrolling, blinking text; depending\non your frame of reference, it might recall DESQview, the Commodore 64, or a\nhost of early DOS-based graphical user interfaces. In style if not in\nspecifics, it evokes a particular era, a time when the then-new concept of\n\"personal computing\" necessarily meant programming and tinkering and breaking\nthings.\n\nGif by the author\n\nIt's all innocuously familiar. You see a sprite-based first person shooter\ncalled Castle Frankenstein and a dollar-bill icon that opens a budgeting\napplication. Vocab is a multiple-choice quiz (can you define \"folliculous\"?).\nA Battlezone homage opens with the admonishment, \"Write games, don't play\nthem!\"\n\nThen there are less mundane features. Pressing F7 anywhere in TempleOS summons\na pseudo-random \"tongues word.\" Five F7s at the command prompt might produce\ndownmarket Dada like \"flashedt ARE evil madly peacemaker.\" Shift-F7 inserts a\nBible passage. (Or, less revelatory, the copyright notice from Project\nGutenberg's e-text Bible.) Jukebox offers a collection of PC-speaker tunes\nwith Biblically inspired lyrics, like this gloss on Mark 4:37: Lord, there's a\nstorm upon the sea / Lord, there's a storm upon the sea /Relax, fellas / (Sea\nbecame glass).__\n\nTempleOS is more than an exercise in retro computing, or a hobbyist's space\nfor programming close to the bare metal. It's the brainchild\u2014perhaps the\nlife's work\u2014of 44-year-old Terry Davis, the founder and sole employee of\nTrivial Solutions. For more than a decade Davis has worked on it; today,\nTempleOS is 121,176 lines of code, which puts it on par with Photoshop 1.0.\n(By comparison, Windows 7, a full-fledged modern operating system designed to\nbe everything to everyone, filled with decades of cruft, is about 40 million\nlines.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's done this work because God told him to. According to the TempleOS\ncharter, it is \"God's official temple. Just like Solomon's temple, this is a\ncommunity focal point where offerings are made and God's oracle is consulted.\"\nGod also told Davis that 640x480, 16-color graphics \"is a covenant like\ncircumcision,\" making it easier for children to make drawings for God. God\ndemands a perfect temple, and Davis says, \"For ten years, I worked on\nprogramming TempleOS, full time. I finished, basically, and the last year has\nbeen tiny touch-ups here and there.\"\n\nWithin TempleOS he built an oracle called AfterEgypt, which lets users climb\nMt. Horeb along with a stick-figure Moses. At the summit, a round scrawl of\nrapidly changing color comes into sight\u2014the burning bush. Before it you should\npraise God. You can praise Him for anything, Davis says, including sand\ncastles, snowmen, popcorn, bubbles, isotopes, and sand crabs.\n\n\"The Holy Spirit can puppet you,\" the screen reads. When you press the\nspacebar, an onscreen timer stops, and a corresponding Biblical passage\nappears. \"Sometimes interpretation is tricky,\" Davis says in one of his many\nYouTube demonstrations. He describes this AfterEgypt oracle as a technical\nimprovement on speaking in tongues or using a Ouija board, and points to 1\nCorinthians 14:2: \"For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to\nGod; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis hasn't hesitated to speak to the world about God's digital temple. Back\nin 2004, he was calling it the J Operating System and OSNews profiled his\nwork. He later renamed it LoseThos\u2014a somewhat murky reference to a scene in\nPlatoon\u2014and had a productive conversation with the contributors at MetaFilter,\nwhere his work was introduced as \"an operating system written by a\nschizophrenic programmer.\"\n\nHe has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, having dealt with mental health\nissues since the mid-1990s. Because Davis often communicates in blocks of text\nproduced by his oracle, or with apparently off-topic declarations about God,\nhe's had accounts banned from SomethingAwful and Reddit. He can be aggressive\nand confrontational, sometimes denouncing critics with profanity and call them\n\"nigger.\"\n\nThis has gotten him \"shadowbanned\" on Hackernews, meaning he's visible only to\nusers who've explicitly chosen to see his \"dead\" posts, and has led to a\nlengthy discussion about how to manage a fellow message board member's mental\nillness. MetaFilter and Reddit have similarly touching, frustrating\nconversations among people grappling with basic questions of empathy and\ncommunity.\n\nBut none of this is the recognition Davis is looking for in building God's\ntemple. \"It's nice when getting attention,\" he says, \"but now I know what it's\nlike.\" It rarely means more people using TempleOS to talk to God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what compelled him to build a 16-color world in worship? I wanted to\nunderstand, as best I could, how he's spent a decade as God's lonely\nprogrammer, a voice in the wilderness shouting the good news.\n\nDavis emails me regularly and late into the night, in Courier font, from a two\nor three year-old Dell desktop running Ubuntu. Unable to work, he collects\nSocial Security disability and spends most of his time coding, web surfing, or\nusing the output from the National Institute of Standards and Technology\nrandomness beacon to talk to God\u2014he posts the results on his webpage as \"Terry\nDavis' Rants.\"\n\n> He drinks a lot of caffeine and lives mostly on a 48-hour schedule\n\nHe drinks a lot of caffeine and lives mostly on a 48-hour schedule: \"I stay\nawake 16*2 and sleep 8*2.\" He shares a house with his parents and a pair of\ncockatiels. Of his parents he says, \"We don't interact that much.\"\n\nTerry Davis was born in December 1969, in West Allis, Wisconsin, just west of\nMilwaukee, the seventh of eight children. His brothers and sisters were close,\nbut about his relationship with them today he says, \"Jesus did not talk to his\nsiblings\u2014he wanted nothing to do with them, strangers are better. I am the\nsame way.\"\n\nHis dad was an industrial engineer, and the family moved a lot while Davis was\ngrowing up, from Wisconsin to Washington to Michigan to California to Arizona.\nIn an elementary school gifted program, he started using an Apple II; in the\nearly 1980s, he learned assembly language on a Commodore 64, then continued\nprogramming throughout high school. Then he enrolled at Arizona State\nUniversity, where he earned his bachelor's degree, then a master's in\nelectrical engineering in 1994.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduation he stayed in Tempe, Arizona, partly because he had a job. As\nan undergrad he'd been hired at Ticketmaster to program operating systems. He\nliked the work, but when the company shifted him to research projects that\nnever seemed to pan out, he decided it was time to look elsewhere. He was 26,\nhad a master's degree, and he wanted to use that knowledge to build satellite\ncontrol systems. In early 1996 he sent out some resumes to defense\ncontractors.\n\nHe'd grown up Catholic, but later embraced atheism. \"I thought the brain was a\ncomputer,\" Davis says, \"And so I had no need for a soul.\" He saw himself as a\nscientific materialist; he believes that metaphor\u2014the brain as a computer\u2014has\ndone more to increase the number of atheists than anything by Darwin. He still\nconsiders himself scientifically minded. \"Today I find the people most similar\nto me are atheist-scientist people,\" he says. \"The difference is God has\ntalked to me, so I'm basically like an atheist who God has talked to.\"\n\nDavis describes how that happened in a fragmentary, elliptical way, perhaps\nbecause it was such a profoundly subjective experience, or maybe because it\nstill embarrasses him. \"It's not very flattering,\" he says. \"It looks a lot\nlike mental illness, as opposed to some glorious revelation from God.\" It was\na period of tribulation, but to this day he declares, \"I was being led along\nthe path by God. It just doesn't look very glorious.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn mid-March 1996, \"I started seeing people following me around in suits and\nstuff. It just seemed something was strange,\" he says. He thought it might be\npart of a background check by one of his prospective employers, but it\nunnerved him. He began connecting it to a side-project he'd worked on\ninvolving computer control systems. And he'd been listening to Rage Against\nthe Machine; the line, \"Some of those work forces are the same that burn\ncrosses\" stuck with him for reasons unknown.\n\nHe got thinking about conspiracy theories and the men he'd seen following him\nand a big idea he'd had. He spooked himself. \"It would sound polite if you\nsaid I scared myself thinking about quantum computers,\" he says now. \"And then\nI guess you just throw in your ordinary mental illness.\"\n\nHe left town. Driving south with no clear destination, he says, \"I was\nlistening to the radio and it seemed like the radio was talking to me.\" It\nspouted commentary on everything he did. He believed the end of the world was\nat hand. His head swam with conspiracy theories and apocalyptic foreboding.\n\nHe ended up in Marfa, Texas, where he abandoned his car \u2014a Honda Accord his\nparents had given him. He'd started thinking about Big Oil and the\nconspiracies alleged to have suppressed more efficient, water-based engines.\nHe'd torn off all the side panels from his car looking for a tracking device,\nthen stopped the car and pitched the keys into the desert. He walked. A cop\npulled up and ushered him into the passenger's seat. Moments later, Davis dove\nout of the cruiser, breaking his collarbone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the hospital, he overheard doctors talking about \"artifacts\" on his X-ray\nscans. Panicked at the thought of artifacts supposedly left inside by alien\nabductors, he bolted from the hospital, despite the broken collarbone. When he\ntried to steal a pickup truck idling nearby, the police caught up with him. In\njail, he reasoned that he could open his cell door by flipping the circuit\nbreaker; he broke his glasses and stuck them into the cell's electrical\noutlet, only to realize he had non-conductive frames. The police rushed in. \"I\nthink I stripped,\" Davis says, \"because I was thinking of corporate logos\nbeing bad or something.\"\n\nHe was taken to a mental hospital, where he refused to eat the food, thinking\nit might be drugged. He broke a window with a chair. Released after two weeks,\nhe sought to emulate Jesus by giving away all his belongings; he donated to\nGoodwill, and delivered presents to his siblings' children. He may have\ncrossed into Mexico at some point, then had to bribe his way back across the\nborder. He just drove, looking to street signs to divine God's will. Later he\nlived on the streets.\n\n\"In the Bible it says if you seek God, He will be found of you,\" Davis says\nnow. \"I was really seeking, and I was looking everywhere to see what he might\nbe saying to me.\"\n\n\"Looking back on it, I'm not especially proud of the logic and thinking. It\nlooks very young and childish and pathetic,\" Davis adds. He compares the\nexperience to having a switch flipped, one that revealed his deepest\nconscience and morality. \"I felt guilty for being such a technology-advocate\natheist,\" he says. He thought of the Amish and Little House on the\nPrairie\u2014simple, decent ways of living with God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one of his rants, he writes, \"In 1996, I off-handedly decided to give a few\ndollars to charity for the blind. I was an atheist from 1990-1996 and gave\nnothing to charity. Perhaps, that act caused God to reveal Himself to me and\nsaved me.\" He estimates he gave about $10,000 to the Newman Center, Arizona\nState's campus ministry.\n\nBy July of 1996, his mental state had calmed enough that he returned to\nArizona. For the next year he lived on credit cards, trying to make a business\nout of a three-axis milling machine he'd prototyped. (It was obvious to him\nthat 3D printing would be the next big thing, but it was also painfully slow.)\nAfter an errant Dremel tool nearly set his apartment on fire, he abandoned the\nidea.\n\nEventually he moved in with his parents in Vegas, hoping to save money while\nhe worked on a book, a sequel to George Orwell's 1984. He didn't finish it.\n\n\"From 1996 to 2003, about every six months I would have what they call a manic\nepisode and I would end up in a mental hospital,\" he says. He hasn't been to a\nhospital since; once diagnosed as bipolar, he's since been declared\nschizophrenic. He now only takes a single medication, and shrugs off the\ndiagnosis. The label doesn't concern him. \"For those first few years, I was\ngenuinely pretty crazy in a way. Now I'm not. I'm crazy in a different way\nmaybe,\" he says. He says he's learned not to freak out.\n\nAs 64-bit computing began trickling down to desktops around 2003, Davis saw it\nas the next big disruption. He dusted off some code from ten years earlier,\nwhen he'd worked on operating systems for Ticketmaster and tinkered on the\nside. \"It kind of developed on its own,\" he says, \"I didn't plan it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the idea of a digital oracle grew out of his earlier methods for talking\nto God. At first he'd open a Bible to a random page, and it would speak. Yet\nhe had a general sense of where the book had opened, whether he might be\nchoosing from Genesis or Revelation. He began using coin tosses to choose a\npage number; then he expanded his technique to include all the books in his\nlibrary. Soon he'd settled on a digital timer for his oracle, AfterEgypt.\n\nHe kept the rest of the programming simple. God told him to stick to 640x480\nand 16 colors, with only a single audio voice. Like Noah, he built as he was\ncommanded. \"It's really obvious what to do next,\" he says, \"and it can keep\nyou busy for the first ten years.\" But now he's finished.\n\n> He talks to God constantly, and his God is conversational, even chatty\n\n\"The way God works is he caused the course of my life. I can see how it's been\na charmed life in some ways, so I think He planned it,\" Davis says. Sometimes\nhe seems to believe TempleOS will exist for 1,000 years, that it will be\nembraced and perfected by the giants of Silicon Valley, and that he will be\nrecognized as King Solomon 2.0. Other times he seems less certain, even\nvulnerable to doubt. \"Is it going to be as big as Solomon's Temple?\" he asks.\n\"I don't know. But we'll see. What else is there?\"\n\nHe talks to God constantly, and his God is conversational, even chatty. In\nfact, Davis believes he's proven God speaks to him. He believes anything can\nbe an oracle; that the divine word reveals itself through randomness.\n\nAt least a dozen times on his webpage, he describes putting a question to his\nmother. If he won the lottery three times, he asks, would she believe? No, she\nresponds, because improbable things happen all the time. \"I can sit down with\nmy parents and praise God and open the Bible randomly,\" he says, \"and it will\ntalk.\" For him this is both astounding and undeniable, an ongoing revelation,\nlike winning the lottery ten times every day. Yet, he says, \"They just ignore\nit because it's against their way of thinking. They just ignore the facts.\n\nTerry Davis asks God about war (\"Servicemen competing\") and death (\"awful\"),\nabout dinosaurs (\"Brontosaurs' feet hurt when stepped\") and His favorite video\ngame (\"Donkey Kong\"). God's favorite car is a \"Beamer,\" and His favorite\nsinger is Mick Jagger, though if He could sing He'd want to sound like\nChristopher Hall from Stabbing Westward. His favorite national anthem is\nLatvia's. His favorite band is, no surprise, The Beatles, but Rush and Triumph\nare pretty good, too. Classical music is poison. The best thing Bill Gates\ncould do to save lives, God says, is work on earthquake prediction. The\nEleventh Commandment is \"Thou shall not litter.\" Terry Davis tells God\neverything seems bad. God replies: \"Plant trees.\"\n\nThe words pour out on TempleOS.org, a torrent of verified random numbers, news\nlinks, YouTube videos, and scriptural exegesis. It's the dense work of a\nsingle, restless mind writing ceaselessly without an audience.\n\nAfter two months of emails and phone conversations, I know more than when I\nbegan; specifically, I've accumulated more raw data, more facts about his life\nand experience. But I suspect I've only sketched a shadow. The full reality\nremains unreachable, an irreducible mystery.\n\nOne morning, Davis emailed me about this story, saying, \"What people are going\nto read is, 'It's about a pathetic schizophrenic who made a crappy operating\nsystem.' My perspective is, 'God said I made His temple.'\" It echoed something\nhe'd written before: \"I don't care much about you and your story. It's not\nlikely to be what it actually is\u2014world news with God claiming His temple.\"\n\nI can't disagree. Theophany belongs to those who can see, and the rest are\nbarred from its consolation. Davis believes he has proven he can talk to God\nthrough random numbers; he calls his parents sheep, because they cannot\nbelieve this. The word they\u2014we\u2014have for him is schizophrenic, and the\ncondition is never cured, only treated. Terry Davis has offered the world a\ntemple to a God who speaks only to him, and is and still waiting for everyone\nelse to listen.\n\nTagged:codesmotherboard showOperating SystemsTempleOSTerry\nDavisTechMotherboard\n\n### ONE EMAIL.
