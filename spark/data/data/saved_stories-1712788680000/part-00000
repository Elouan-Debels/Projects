The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose42 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 of 42\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 of 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 of 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 of 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices.

Afriyie/Associated Press\n\n\u201cAll school districts are grappling with the challenges and impact of\nartificial intelligence and other technology available to students at any time\nand anywhere,\u201d Raymond Gonz\u00e1lez, the superintendent of Westfield Public\nSchools, said in the statement.\n\nBlindsided last year by the sudden popularity of A.I.-powered chatbots like\nChatGPT, schools across the United States scurried to contain the text-\ngenerating bots in an effort to forestall student cheating. Now a more\nalarming A.I. image-generating phenomenon is shaking schools.\n\nBoys in several states have used widely available \u201cnudification\u201d apps to\npervert real, identifiable photos of their clothed female classmates, shown\nattending events like school proms, into graphic, convincing-looking images of\nthe girls with exposed A.I.-generated breasts and genitalia. In some cases,\nboys shared the faked images in the school lunchroom, on the school bus or\nthrough group chats on platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, according to\nschool and police reports.\n\nSuch digitally altered images \u2014 known as \u201cdeepfakes\u201d or \u201cdeepnudes\u201d \u2014 can have\ndevastating consequences. Child sexual exploitation experts say the use of\nnonconsensual, A.I.-generated images to harass, humiliate and bully young\nwomen can harm their mental health, reputations and physical safety as well as\npose risks to their college and career prospects. Last month, the Federal\nBureau of Investigation warned that it is illegal to distribute computer-\ngenerated child sexual abuse material, including realistic-looking\nA.I.-generated images of identifiable minors engaging in sexually explicit\nconduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet the student use of exploitative A.I. apps in schools is so new that some\ndistricts seem less prepared to address it than others. That can make\nsafeguards precarious for students.\n\n## More on U.S. Schools\n\n  * A.I.-Doctored Photos: Teen girls are confronting an epidemic of deepfake nudes in schools, as middle and high school students have used A.I. to fabricate explicit images of female classmates\n  * N.Y.C.

The school official then asked \u201cwhat was she\nsupposed to report,\u201d the police document said, prompting the detective to\ninform her that schools are required by law to report sexual abuse, including\npossible child sexual abuse material. The school subsequently reported the\nincident to Child Protective Services, the police report said. (The New York\nTimes obtained the police report through a public-records request.)\n\nIn a statement, the Issaquah School District said it had talked with students,\nfamilies and the police as part of its investigation into the deepfakes. The\ndistrict also \u201cshared our empathy,\u201d the statement said, and provided support\nto students who were affected.\n\nThe statement added that the district had reported the \u201cfake, artificial-\nintelligence-generated images to Child Protective Services out of an abundance\nof caution,\u201d noting that \u201cper our legal team, we are not required to report\nfake images to the police.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt Beverly Vista Middle School in Beverly Hills, Calif., administrators\ncontacted the police in February after learning that five boys had created and\nshared A.I.-generated explicit images of female classmates. Two weeks later,\nthe school board approved the expulsion of five students, according to\ndistrict documents. (The district said California\u2019s education code prohibited\nit from confirming whether the expelled students were the students who had\nmanufactured the images.)\n\nMichael Bregy, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District,\nsaid he and other school leaders wanted to set a national precedent that\nschools must not permit pupils to create and circulate sexually explicit\nimages of their peers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s extreme bullying when it comes to schools,\u201d Dr. Bregy said, noting\nthat the explicit images were \u201cdisturbing and violative\u201d to girls and their\nfamilies. \u201cIt\u2019s something we will absolutely not tolerate here.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nMichael Bregy, superintendent of Beverly Hills schools, said he wanted to send\na message that schools must not allow pupils to make and share explicit images\nof their peers.Credit...Tracy Nguyen for The New York Times\n\nSchools in the small, affluent communities of Beverly Hills and Westfield were\namong the first to publicly acknowledge deepfake incidents.

(The Manis said they are not involved with the\nlawsuit.)\n\nAfter she accepted the request, the male student copied photos of her and\nseveral other female schoolmates from their social media accounts, court\ndocuments say. Then he used an A.I. app to fabricate sexually explicit, \u201cfully\nidentifiable\u201d images of the girls and shared them with schoolmates via a\nSnapchat group, court documents say.\n\nWestfield High began to investigate in late October. While administrators\nquietly took some boys aside to question them, Francesca Mani said, they\ncalled her and other 10th-grade girls who had been subjected to the deepfakes\nto the school office by announcing their names over the school intercom.\n\nThat week, Mary Asfendis, the principal of Westfield High, sent an email to\nparents alerting them to \u201ca situation that resulted in widespread\nmisinformation.\u201d The email went on to describe the deepfakes as a \u201cvery\nserious incident.\u201d It also said that, despite student concern about possible\nimage-sharing, the school believed that \u201cany created images have been deleted\nand are not being circulated.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nAn October email that the principal of Westfield High sent to parents about\nthe deepfakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDorota Mani said Westfield administrators had told her that the district\nsuspended the male student accused of fabricating the images for one or two\ndays.\n\nSoon after, she and her daughter began publicly speaking out about the\nincident, urging school districts, state lawmakers and Congress to enact laws\nand policies specifically prohibiting explicit deepfakes.\n\n\u201cWe have to start updating our school policy,\u201d Francesca Mani, now 15, said in\na recent interview. \u201cBecause if the school had A.I. policies, then students\nlike me would have been protected.\u201d\n\nParents including Dorota Mani also lodged harassment complaints with Westfield\nHigh last fall over the explicit images. During the March meeting, however,\nMs. Mani told school board members that the high school had yet to provide\nparents with an official report on the incident.\n\nWestfield Public Schools said it could not comment on any disciplinary actions\nfor reasons of student confidentiality. In a statement, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez, the\nsuperintendent, said the district was strengthening its efforts \u201cby educating\nour students and establishing clear guidelines to ensure that these new\ntechnologies are used responsibly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBeverly Hills schools have taken a stauncher public stance.\n\nWhen administrators learned in February that eighth-grade boys at Beverly\nVista Middle School had created explicit images of 12- and 13-year-old female\nclassmates, they quickly sent a message \u2014 subject line: \u201cAppalling Misuse of\nArtificial Intelligence\u201d \u2014 to all district parents, staff, and middle and high\nschool students.
