Their triple-junction,\nperovskite/silicon tandem cells are converting sunlight to electricity at a\nrate of 27.1%. That's a \"certified world-record,\" according to the university.\nThe experts there are testing cells less than a square inch in size,\nresembling a postage stamp.\n\nFor comparison, most solar panels have efficiency rates of 15-20%. If the\nSingapore results can become standard, solar energy output could grow faster\nthan the impressive rates already being marked. For reference, the United\nStates' solar sector capacity saw a 51% increase in 2023 over the prior year,\nper statistics from the Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\n\"Collectively, these advancements offer groundbreaking insights into\nmitigating energy loss in perovskite solar cells,\" project lead, Assistant\nProfessor Hou Yi, said in a lab report.\n\nPerovskites are a group of materials that are good at converting sunlight to\nenergy at a low cost, as noted by the U.S. Energy Department.\n\nThe Singapore team added silicon and cyanate, which is a salt. This helped the\nteam to form a triple-junction cell, which has performed better than any other\nof its type to date. Multi-layered cells, made of a variety of materials, are\nable to absorb sunlight in a different range on each layer, increasing\nefficiency, all per the university.\n\nGood news, green hacks, and the latest cool clean tech \u2014 straight to your\ninbox every week!\n\n#### Watch now: Solar-powered boats from the Honnold Foundation are making a\ndifference in the Amazon\n\nSolar-powered boats from the Honnold Foundation are making a difference in the\nAmazon\n\n0 seconds of 50 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nCopied\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:50\n\n00:50\n\n\"Remarkably, after 15 years of ongoing research in the field of perovskite-\nbased solar cells, this work constitutes the first experimental evidence for\nthe inclusion of cyanate into perovskites to boost the stability of its\nstructure and improve power conversion efficiency,\" Yi said in the lab\nsummary.\n\nDuring research and development, the cyanate-enhanced perovskite was able to\noperate nonstop for hundreds of hours, maintaining capacity and achieving\nhigher voltages than typical cells.\n\nSolar innovations are taking new shapes, including stretchable concepts geared\nto power wearable tech. Several labs, including NASA's, are developing thin,\nfilm-like suncatchers with unique application possibilities. Some of the tech\nis even printable.\n\nWhat's more, government programs are making the latest solar tech more\naccessible for average homeowners, who can save thousands of dollars during\nthe first decade of installing a system. That's thanks to tax breaks and other\nincentives that can lower the initial cost, which can be $16,000 on average.\n\nImportantly, about 8,500 pounds of air pollution can be reduced each year. The\nlong-term health benefits are great, as dirty air is linked to many problems,\nincluding increased dementia risks.\n\nNext up for the Singapore team is increasing the efficiency of their cells to\nan aggressive goal of 50%, while also \"upscaling\" the tech to larger modules.\n\n\"And set a new course for the further development of perovskite-based triple-\njunction solar technology,\" Yi said, continuing a prior quote in the\nuniversity lab report.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations\nimproving our lives and saving our planet.\n\n  * share\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Link Copied!\n\n## Cool Picks\n\n#### Here are 5 innovative design ideas that can protect homes during the most\nextreme weather disasters\n\n#### This startup helps you save money on your utility bills by switching to\nsolar power \u2014 no rooftop panels necessary\n\n#### Here's a simple way to turn your old sneakers into actual cash: 'I can\ntell you firsthand \u2014 it works'\n\n#### This new law is like a free '$8,000 bank account' for remodeling your\nhome \u2014 here's how to take advantage of it\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * PRIVACY\n  * TERMS\n  * CONTACT\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\n\u00a9 2024 THE COOL DOWN COMPANY.
