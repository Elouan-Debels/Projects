(Video:\nMonica Rodman, Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n\nListen\n\n8 min\n\nShare\n\nComment41\n\nSave\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Our phones constantly clamor for our attention, and some\npeople \u2014 myself included \u2014 are getting tired of it.\n\nWe\u2019re more than 15 years into the age of the modern, all-screen smartphone,\nand companies big and small are busy reimagining what we might want to use\nnext.\n\nMeta has AI sunglasses that can recognize objects around you. The start-up\nRabbit has an AI handheld that can learn to interact with apps and services\nfor you. And former Apple design chief Jony Ive is raising money to build some\nkind of secretive AI companion gadget.\n\nOr you could put on Humane\u2019s AI Pin, a $699 wearable with a touch pad, a\ncamera and a laser projector you stick to your shirt. It\u2019s not meant to\nreplace your phone, but Humane thinks you could live a little more in the\nmoment when you\u2019re asking an AI to answer questions and text people instead of\nstaring at a screen again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last two weeks testing the Pin to see if it could possibly live\nup to the hype. Here\u2019s how it went and what you need to know.\n\n###\n\nFirst, here\u2019s how the AI Pin works\n\nIf you've ever watched Captain Picard tap his combadge to talk his colleagues\non Star Trek, congratulations: You basically already know how to use the AI\nPin.\n\nYou\u2019re meant to wear the Pin high up on your chest, so you can quickly reach\nover and press its touch pad \u2014 that turns on its microphone so you can ask\nsomething.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n###### Should you trust that AI?\n\n(Outlanders Design For The Washington Post)\n\nArtificial intelligence is becoming part of everyday life. But is it better\nthan what it replaces? Is it accurate or biased? What does it do to your\nprivacy? And what happens when something goes wrong? The Washington Post\u2019s\nHelp Desk is putting AI to the test.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, Humane President Imran Chaudhri told me the company\ndoesn\u2019t \u201cuse any of your data in any of our training or training of other\nmodels,\u201d unless you view your Pin\u2019s activity online and choose to leave\nfeedback.)\n\nWhen you want to read an incoming message or fiddle with the Pin\u2019s settings,\nyou hold your hand up in front of the Pin so the projector can beam its\ninterface onto your palm. To interact with items that appear on your palm,\nyou\u2019re supposed to tilt your hand around to highlight them and pinch your\nfingers Vision Pro style to \u201cclick\u201d on them.\n\nIf this all sounds pretty neat, well, it is. And Humane is right about one\nthing: Interacting with a device like this feels surprisingly natural, to the\npoint where I sometimes find myself reaching for the Pin to ask a question\neven when I\u2019m not wearing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut using the Pin can get frustrating, fast. Take those tilt and pinch\ngestures: They\u2019re easy to understand, but hard to master. Even after two\nweeks, I still find myself struggling to select just the right menu options.\n\nHere\u2019s another catch: The projector is basically unreadable when you\u2019re in the\nsun. Summer\u2019s just around the corner, and it\u2019s sure to offer plenty of warm\ndays I don\u2019t want my phone to get in the way of, but the Pin is much less\nuseful in broad daylight.\n\nSpeaking of warmth, the Pin starts to overheat pretty quickly when you\u2019re\nmaking back-to-back requests or using the Pin\u2019s projector for too long.\n\nWhen that happens, don\u2019t be surprised when the Pin cuts off contact for a\nwhile as it cools off. This has happened four or five times in two weeks, at\nleast once when it was just charging from one of its magnetic booster\nbatteries. That\u2019s not great, especially since you\u2019ll have to snap on another\nbooster to use the Pin for a full day.\n\n###\n\nUsing the Pin as a phone\n\nLet's be clear here: No one, not even the folks at Humane, think the Pin is\ngoing to replace your smartphone. But it does act like one sometimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nYou have to shell out $24 each month to use the Pin, and part of that cost\ngives it a line of T-Mobile service for making calls, sending messages and\naccessing the internet away from home.\n\nPhone calls generally sound pretty good through the Pin\u2019s built-in speaker,\nbut if you\u2019re around more than a few people, the sound it produces is easily\ndrowned out. (Connecting a pair of Bluetooth headphones, however, really\nhelps.)\n\nTexting is trickier. Unless you specifically tell the Pin you\u2019re dictating the\ncontents of a message \u2014 something that\u2019s easy to forget when you\u2019re just\ntrying to contact someone \u2014 the Pin has this weird tendency to truncate some\nmessages and pretend swear words don\u2019t exist.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHere's an example: One day, I asked the Pin to send a message to a friend\nsaying \u201cI'm tired of this [expletive] San Francisco weather and the food.\u201d\n(Neither of these things are even close to true, for the record.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the full message he received said \u201cOf this San Francisco weather and\nthe food.\u201d My friend was a little confused, to say the least.\n\nAlso, think about the services you rely on every day through your phone and\npick three of them. Odds are, the Pin can\u2019t connect to any of them.\n\nRight now, all it can do is pull contacts from Apple, Google and Microsoft\naccounts, and play music in Tidal. Humane says it\u2019s working to widen the Pin\u2019s\nset of tools, but those changes are going to take time \u2014 and buy-in from\ncompanies that believe in the Pin\u2019s promise.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOh, and the camera? At best, it\u2019s hit-or miss. In daylight, the results can be\npleasant enough, but if you\u2019re anywhere dim, expect to see lots of grain and\nblurry faces.\n\nThe idea of a less intrusive kind of camera is a powerful one, but if you want\na visual record of your life you might actually want to revisit, you\u2019re better\noff sticking to your phone for photos and video.\n\n###\n\nTalking to the AI\n\nAt its best, the Pin is a sort of speed dial button to a question-and-answer\nhotline with an AI on the other end. And on the whole, it worked pretty well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I sat down to watch \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and discovered that former New\nYork mayor Ed Koch was gay, the Pin correctly offered a bit of insight into\nhis only long-term relationship.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut it still gets some factual things wrong. It claimed, for example, that\nsome ingredients in Twinkies have been banned by the state of California.\n(That\u2019s not true, but a local lawmaker is crusading against one of the dyes\nused in those treats.)\n\nEven though the Pin\u2019s answers are more correct than not, I still feel like I\nhave to fact check them. And if that\u2019s the case, why shouldn\u2019t I just pick my\nup phone in the first place?\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to be careful about how you talk to it. Small differences in\nthe way you structure your request mean the difference between success and\nsheer confusion.\n\nAnd even when the Pin knows exactly what you\u2019re talking about, it produces\nresults that are far from helpful. Just recently, my fianc\u00e9e and I were\nfiguring out an order for fancy disposable flatware for a pre-wedding\nreception cocktail hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt sounded a little like a word problem so I asked the Pin: \u201cPlates come in\npackages of 200. Forks come in packages of 150. How many packages of plates\nand forks do I need to buy to wind up with an equivalent number of plates and\nworks?\u201d\n\nA little arithmetic gives us the answer: 3 packs of plates, and 4 packs of\nforks. Simple. Instead, the Pin explained calmly and at length about how one\nmight solve this equation, without ever actually solving it.\n\nHumane has a clear plan for making the Pin more useful such as working on\nfeatures to identify objects with the camera, track your nutrition and connect\nto other services you rely on. I\u2019m looking forward to trying them out when\nthey arrive, because \u2014 when everything works the way it\u2019s supposed to \u2014\nthere\u2019s a glimmer of a good product here.\n\nIf there\u2019s a lesson here, though, it\u2019s that rather than splurging on a new\ndevice that promises to fix our problems we may be better off forcing\nourselves to use the ones we have more judiciously.\n\n### Help Desk: Making tech work for you\n\nHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and\ntake control of the technology used in everyday life.\n\nTake control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and\nadvice on how to make your tech a force for good.\n\nTech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation online\n\nData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.
