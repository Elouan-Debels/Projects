The term, which refers to the economic\ndevelopment of a low-income area that ultimately displaces the neighborhood\u2019s\ncurrent residents, is culturally ubiquitous but rarely understood. Because of\nits prevalence, the more broad definition of gentrification has been reduced\nin people\u2019s minds to \u201cthe emergence of new coffee shops,\u201d or \u201cwhite people\nmoving in with their dogs.\u201d While those aren\u2019t exactly untrue results of this\nphenomenon, gentrification typically begins higher up, when urban planners,\ncity officials, and bigwig developers with their fat pockets lined with shiny\ngold doubloons get together to revamp local infrastructure. They are the ones\nwhose residential buildings and businesses drive the cost of living up, and\nforce residents out of homes they\u2019ve lived in for decades.\n\nIt was this type of insidious, dictionary-definition gentrification that led\neight artists in Providence, Rhode Island, to fight back. Just before the turn\nof the century in August 1999, construction was completed on the massive\nProvidence Place Mall, which developers hoped would boost the city\u2019s economy\nand revitalize its downtown area. The shopping center was not just an eyesore\nin the middle of the city; it was also a central attraction that pushed the\nvalue of the surrounding land sky-high. Cut to local artist Michael Townsend\nand his friends being kicked out of their home nearby so it could be torn down\nand turned into a grocery store. While trying to find a new place to stay,\nthey hatched a plan: Take an empty, forgotten space inside of the gigantic\nmall, and turn it into an apartment as a middle finger to the man.\n\nExcept this wasn\u2019t just some punks playing a prank. The apartment turned into\na home, one that housed a group of working artists on and off for four whole\nyears before it was discovered.\n\nTownsend and his cohorts are the subjects of Secret Mall Apartment, a\nfantastic new documentary premiering at this year\u2019s South by Southwest Film\nFestival. Even though their hidden home made national news when it was\ndiscovered by mall security in 2007, no other accomplices came forward. The\ndocumentary introduces the world to Townsend\u2019s friends and partners in this\nproject for the first time, telling their story through priceless archival\nfootage from a dingy digital camera used to document the whole multi-year\nprocess. The result is an odd and outrageous doc that captures a low-tech blip\nin time, and affirms the power and necessity of art and those who create it.\n\nWhen Providence Place opened a few months before the new millennium, a\nshopping mall as a revitalization tool seemed like a sure bet. No one could\nhave predicted how online shopping would shake the industry, especially\nconsidering the impending Y2K incident had people legitimately convinced that\nall computer systems would fail and the country would be plunged into\ndarkness. Why not throw $500 million at a super-mall? Surely that concept\nwould not be verging on extinction two decades later.\n\nThat lack of forethought impacted Townsend, his friends, and the thousands of\nothers who were eventually displaced from their homes after the mall was\nbuilt. Townsend was part of an artists\u2019 enclave in an old mill building on the\n\u201cpoorer\u201d side of town, not far from the mall, which now physically divided\nProvidence\u2019s income brackets. Hidden camera footage of a developer who bought\ntheir building telling them, \u201cWhen I come back, you better be out\u2014I\u2019m not\nfucking around,\u201d is downright chilling. Is it so shocking that a group of\nultra-creative people would turn their rage from being kicked out of their\nhome into an ambitious, slightly dangerous real-life art project inside the\nvery structure that displaced them?\n\nIn 2003, Townsend, along with his then-wife Adriana and friends Andrew and\nJay\u2014as well as an eventual rotating group of eight total artist\ncolleagues\u2014scouted the corridors of Providence Place and found a room hidden\nin the bowels of its design. The decently sized cement surface sat atop a\nlarge set of steep metal stairs, which were only accessible through tight\npassageways or security doors that set off a loud alarm. But once Townsend and\nhis team discovered that the two-minute alarm was more of a deterrent than an\nactual alert, their plan was hatched.\n\nThe footage captured during this time is remarkable. Though Townsend\u2019s little\ndigital camera\u2014which fit inside of an Altoids can and could remain discreet as\nthey surveilled and mapped the mall\u2014is low-res, the extent of what has\nsurvived and made it into the finished film is incredible. Secret Mall\nApartment is a time capsule of early-2000s iconography, with loose-cut, dirt-\nwashed jeans and War of the Worlds novelty popcorn bags (purchased from inside\nthe mall\u2019s movie theater and brought back to the apartment) catapulting us\nback to a bygone era. Watching the team trick and evade the mall\u2019s security\nand staff and slowly build out their fantasy apartment piece by piece is\ncompletely thrilling.\n\nThis was not a simple project by any means. The goal was to turn the secret\napartment into a real, livable home, and the videos of the group at thrift\nstores picking out couches and wooden hutches to haul through the mall and\nfinagle up those steep stairs undetected are hysterical. Half the fun of\nSecret Mall Apartment comes from watching the project ramp up from a wacky\nidea into its unbelievable execution. And it helps that Townsend and his\nfriends are such compelling, confident documentary talking heads. It\u2019s so\nvividly clear that this secret apartment was not merely a stunt; it deeply\nmeant something to them.\n\nThe film dextrously expands past all of its initial excitement when it\nillustrates precisely why this group of creative minds held such affection for\ntheir clandestine condo. Director Jeremy Workman sews together a larger\nnarrative that, at times, becomes unexpectedly moving. Yes, the secret\napartment was a living, changing project. But it was also a place for people\nto come together and to plan more involved, important work together.\n\nThe film finds its strongest emotional footing when it explores the art that\nTownsend and his crew made during the years that the mall apartment was\nfunctioning. His beautiful tape art projects, which Townsend brought to\nchildren\u2019s hospitals and used to memorialize the victims of 9/11 in the years\nimmediately following the attacks, will not so much tug at your heartstrings\nas yank them. Meanwhile, the footage of a late-\u201990s sculpture piece that\nTownsend hid underneath a Providence train track for the public to find is a\nstirring reminder that art doesn\u2019t need clear political intention attached to\nbe poignant and significant.\n\nThe movie isn\u2019t always as graceful as these moments. At one point, in their\npresent-day talking head interviews, Townsend and his friends recall their\nwhite privilege after they weren\u2019t arrested or violently harmed by police\nwhile being questioned about why they were hauling cinder blocks through an\narmed entrance in the mall. (This was, naturally, to build an entire cement\nwall, with a door in the middle, to throw any prying eyes off their trail.)\nThese observations are frustratingly surface-level, short, and shoehorned in,\nas if to remind us that these artists are globally aware of their privilege.\nThat\u2019s a necessary talking point in this story, but the film doesn\u2019t explore\nit past a few quick soundbites before moving back to the fun. The result is\ntonally jarring, and feels perfunctory and obvious when compared with how\nexcellently the film studies other subjects.\n\nBut Secret Mall Apartment is also careful to avoid suggesting that\ngentrification is bad specifically because it displaced these brilliant\nartists. Rather, the film asks its audience to consider the people whose whole\nlives are in one place, and who have them tossed aside by forces outside of\ntheir control so a strip mall can be built. Townsend and the rest of the\npeople who frequented the secret apartment know well that their experience\nwith gentrification was relatively trivial compared to others. But it\u2019s\nbecause they were affected at all that their four-year project and this\ndocumentary exist.\n\nOften, art reveals an even greater importance over time. By examining the\neffects of gentrification on a small scale, and the need for artistic outlets\nin the face of strife, the secret mall apartment inside Providence Place finds\na new significance 20 years after it was created. The documentary depicts the\nreptilian idea of \u201cprogress\u201d eating its tail, and in its final kicker, Secret\nMall Apartment delivers one hilarious, nauseating gut punch that reaffirms its\nbrilliance.\n\n# Coleman Spilde\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\n@colemanjspildeColeman.Spilde@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Kirk, the principled shepherd of the\nstarship Enterprise. Shatner narrated the famous line during each episode\u2019s\nopening credits, indelibly tying his voice not just to pop-culture\niconography, but to an ethos that has inspired generations of fans.\n\nA new documentary, William Shatner: You Can Call Me Bill, which is now in\ntheaters, charts Shatner\u2019s career and the philosophies he\u2019s developed about\nlife and the world over the course of his 93 years on Earth\u2014and a short spell\nin a spaceship above it. In the film, we learn that the phrase has also given\nhim marching orders as he navigated a lifetime\u2019s triumphs and tragedies. It\nserved him well in a career spanning seven decades, including studio-system\nfilms of the \u201950s and \u201960s, rebounding from joblessness after starring on Star\nTrek, and rebranding as one of Hollywood\u2019s most self-aware\u2014and self-\neffacing\u2014celebrities, always in on the joke of what it means to be William\nShatner. (There\u2019s a reason so many of us have booked trips through\nPriceline.com.)\n\nYou Can Call Me Bill features Shatner recalling that experience going where,\ntruly, few men have gone: his 2021 spaceflight where, at age 90, he became the\noldest human to fly into space. Shatner\u2019s sense of wonder mixes with\nmelancholy as he looks back at that feat in the film, in which he is\nstartlingly, profoundly candid about his mixed feelings about a life well-led\nand his inevitable next bold adventure: death, and what that might mean.\n\nWilliam Shatner, circa 1988\n\n#### John Downing/Getty\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 93, so there\u2019s an end of the road there,\u201d Shatner told The Daily Beast\u2019s\nObsessed in a Zoom interview about You Can Call Me Bill. He recounted a scene\nfrom a movie he had watched recently. He couldn\u2019t remember the title, but he\nremembered the sequence: A car is speeding down a Florida causeway that\nconnects its southern islands. A plane had blown up a part of the road miles\nahead of the car. \u201cThe car is racing towards the hole in the causeway. We know\nthey\u2019re going to go over, unless they see it. And they\u2019re not going to see\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of in my life,\u201d he added, looking wistful. \u201cThere\u2019s\na hole in my causeway, and I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to hit, but I haven\u2019t\ngot that long.\u201d\n\nA nonagenarian with a prodigious career and pop-culture legacy, this is\nobviously not the first time Shatner has been approached to participate in a\ndocumentary about his life. He\u2019s always turned the offers down. \u201cIt seems so\nfinal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like you make it, and then you die.\u201d\n\nWilliam Shatner in Star Trek\n\n#### Silver Screen Collection/Getty\n\nThe difference this time was how the film was made. Production company Legion\nM financed much of the documentary through crowdfunding, allowing fans to\nreceive a percentage of any profits the film makes. \u201cI\u2019ve never crowdfunded\nanything,\u201d Shatner said. \u201cIt seemed like begging.\u201d But he found something\ninnovative and intimate about this being a shared project with the fans, those\nwho have invested in his career and to whom he can now return that investment\nby giving them access to his story and beliefs through his interviews in the\nfilm.\n\nThere was another convincing factor: \u201cThis documentary is my love letter to my\nfamily,\u201d he said. If he ever was going to do a project like this, he didn\u2019t\nwant it to be one of those superficial pop documentaries where the subject\ngate-keeps any deep or dark anecdotes or thoughts. \u201cI wanted to be honest with\nthem about how I felt about what I did, and answer the questions from my soul.\nI\u2019m not sure that other people who do this have that attitude. This came from\ndeep within me. It\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m naked in a way, but I thought that was\nthe best way to go.\u201d\n\nWilliam Shatner and Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality\n\n#### Warner Brothers/Getty\n\nSo You Can Call Me Bill doesn\u2019t just have Shatner waxing poetic on a rundown\nof his IMDb page. The opening moments find him marveling at the \u201cpreciousness\u201d\nof a world that has evolved over billions of years, then decrying its\n\u201cextinction\u201d that is happening \u201cby mankind\u2019s own hands.\u201d He talks almost\nimmediately about death: \u201cThe occasion of your death is meaningless. You\u2019re\none of billions upon billions who lived and died on earth.\u201d And, perhaps of\nmost interest to Star Trek enthusiasts, we quickly learn his thoughts about\nwhether we\u2019re alone in this universe: \u201cOur ignorance is so profound. And the\nmore we know the more we realize how stupid and how egotistical human beings\nare thinking we\u2019re the only ones.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the documentary eschews biography, the stories of how he was\ncast in Star Trek, or how he feels about people imitating his speaking voice:\n\u201cPeople\u2019s supposed imitation of me... I don\u2019t hear it.\u201d (He still, though, has\na sense of humor about it.) But these are plot details, bullet points onto\nwhich he colors his most intense thoughts about mortality\u2014musings that are\nalmost brutal in their bluntness, yet also refreshingly sage in their honesty\nabout what it means to have lived a life.\n\nWilliam Shatner, circa 1975\n\n#### Michael Ochs Archives/Getty\n\n\u201cIf we consider that we\u2019re born all alone, we all die alone.\u201d Shatner told\nObsessed. \u201cDo we ever find a partner in life that is so close and meaningful\nthat you\u2019re not alone? Or is our condition to be alone and to endure it,\nbecause that\u2019s part of the pain of life? There are enjoyments, which abound:\ngood food, good company, good work. I mean, there\u2019s so much joy waiting for\nus. Can we mix the two together and participate in all of it? Can we\nparticipate in the sadness and loneliness that we all feel and still vibrate\nto the magic of life?\u201d\n\nWe stare at each other quietly for a beat\u2014stunned silence on my end, and him\nunderstanding that questions like these need time for rumination. After a few\nseconds, he looks out the bright window over his left shoulder and looks back\ninto the camera, smiling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking out a window right now as I talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cI see green\ntrees. I see a city. I see mountains. I see the sky with the birds, that the\nEarth is throbbing with life, and it\u2019s waiting to be discovered. What makes me\nso sad, which was brought to mind when I came off of the spaceship that I went\non, was the absolute realization. I\u2019ve known this, but it was dramatically\nshown to me when I looked down at the planet [from space]: how intricately\nconnected everything is.\u201d\n\nBlue Origin vice president of mission and flight operations Audrey Powers,\nWilliam Shatner, Planet Labs co-founder Chris Boshuizen and Medidata Solutions\nco-founder Glen de Vries wave on the landing pad of Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard\nafter they flew into space on October 13, 202.\n\n#### Mario Tama/Getty\n\nSo what does \u201cto boldly go\u201d mean now, then? What does it mean for someone who\nhas been saying it for over half his life\u2014someone who has legitimately been\nwhere none of us will ever dream to go? Now, as Shatner faces down the last\nstretch of the causeway, does it mean something new?\n\n\u201cI always meant to go boldly into life as best you can,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are so many people \u201cthat you and I know,\u201d he said, that face\ndisappointment, tragedy, or heartbreak, and wallow in the negativity, stalling\ntheir lives. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to hide in your bed and not participate in life.\u201d\n\nWhat a waste.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you come back,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s life after\ndeath. I think this is it. This is the journey you take. This is the sadness,\nthe joy, the ecstasy, the love that you feel in this one participation in\nlife. So you have to take the bad with the good. Let the bad wash over you.\nAnd I\u2019m saying this theoretically, because so many times in the bad parts,\nit\u2019s awful. It\u2019s hard to do. But if you keep that in mind\u2014I will do this; I\nwill participate in life and not hide; I will boldly go into that hurt locker\nagain\u2014that\u2019s the only way to do it. The only way to live.\u201d\n\n# Kevin Fallon\n\nSenior Editor, Obsessed\n\n@kpfallonkevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?
