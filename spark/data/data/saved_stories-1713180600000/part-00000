It has an\nactive user and developer community, and there are commercial versions which\nare deployed on a large scale and in safety-critical systems. In this paper we\nexamine the lessons learnt in those 20 years about microkernel design and\nimplementation. We revisit the L4 design papers, and examine the evolution of\ndesign and implementation from the original L4 to the latest generation of L4\nkernels, especially seL4, which has pushed the L4 model furthest and was the\nfirst OS kernel to undergo a complete formal verification of its\nimplementation as well as a sound analysis of worst-case execution times. We\ndemonstrate that while much has changed, the fundamental principles of\nminimality and high IPC performance remain the main drivers of design and\nimplementation decisions.
