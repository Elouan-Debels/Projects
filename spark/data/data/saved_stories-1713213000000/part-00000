The recipe has two ingredients: egg and flour.\nThe proportions are astonishingly flexible: I can use more egg and less flour\nor vice versa. Cake baking is really taking off, so the government decides to\ncollect taxes from cake-makers. In order to do this, they make the arbitrary\ndecision to tax the egg by 20 per cent. This makes the egg relatively more\nexpensive than the flour. Very soon, all the cake-makers are trying to make\ncakes with the smallest amount of egg possible. There is a reduction in egg\nsales. Tax receipts drop accordingly, meaning the government has to increase\nthe rate of tax on eggs to 30 per cent to get their pound. This, in turn,\ncauses further reduction in egg use. Cakes everywhere are now very floury.\nFlour production has ramped up dramatically. Agriculture has tipped heavily\ntowards intensive grain production, which has damaged the soil and created a\ndust bowl. Colossal \u2018black blizzards\u2019 rise up over these limitless wheat\nfields and blow through our towns and cities, suffocating forgotten batteries\nof millions of starving hens. This is called tax distortion.\n\nFor hundreds of years, time and care has been taken to create elegant and\nsurprising structures; the interlaced lattice columns of Marks Barfield\u2019s\nCambridge Central Mosque, completed earlier this year\n\nCredit:Morley von Sternberg\n\nThe highly efficient web-like structures of the Block Research Group at ETH\nZurich learn from English Gothic fan vaulting, as seen at the 15th-century\nPeterborough Cathedral\n\nCredit:Block Research Group, Institute of Technology in Architecture, ETH\nZurich\n\nInstead of flour and eggs, imagine we had material and labour and, instead of\nmaking a cake, we were making a building. Material (including energy) is the\nflour and labour is the egg. Labour is heavily taxed but materials for new\nbuildings are hardly taxed at all. Under these circumstances, as with the\ncake, I would be inclined to minimise the amount of labour I used in\nproportion to material: more flour, less egg. Not only would I try to reduce\nsite labour but I would also try to reduce management and design. I would\ndesign things very quickly, with considerable rationalisation to minimise\ndesign labour. I would design things that were buildable with fewer people\nusing the brute processes of machines favouring repetition and\nstandardisation. Because everything is designed and built for the worst-case\nscenario, these rationalisations naturally engender overuse of material. As\nwith the floury cake, this overuse of material also has consequences.\n\nWhen we think about waste, we think about leftovers. We envision piles of\ndisregarded material that will be thrown into landfill. Waste also means\nunnecessary use of material. When you look at a completed building, you don\u2019t\nsee waste but you should. It is more than likely that the building is 30 per\ncent heavier than it needed to be due to labour-saving rationalisation.\n\n> \u2018Now waste is also a crime against the environment: it means carbon,\n> pollution and extinction\u2019\n\nIn concrete buildings, heavy \u2018flat slabs\u2019 proliferate while thin shells or\nwaffles are rare. Flat formwork is faster to make. Heavy \u2018I\u2019 section steel\nbeams are standard instead of lighter trusses because the rolling mill is\ncheaper than the human welder. Flat CLT slabs are preferred to natural timber\ncarpentered by hand on-site. Hundreds of tonnes of concrete are poured into\nmass concrete footings because it\u2019s quicker to dig straight trenches with an\nexcavator than to vary their widths.\n\nIn the past we used to think of waste as a crime against the needy. Now waste\nis also a crime against the environment: it means carbon, pollution and\nextinction. Until the end of the 20th century, our preoccupation was with\nproducing enough food and material for everyone to live decent lives. The idea\nthat humans could damage the planet might have seemed presumptuous a century\nago. Suddenly there were seven billion of us. Now the idea that the planet\nwill survive us seems presumptuous.\n\nPier Luigi Nervi and Giacomo Maccagno engineered the reinforced thin-shell\nconcrete dome of the Palazzetto dello Sport in Rome, designed by Annibale\nVitellozzi, 1957\n\nA contemporary of Nervi working with bricks in Uruguay, Eladio Dieste also\nbuilt monuments of elegance and economy, such as the Gaussian vaults \u2013\nspanning 45m but only one-brick-layer in thickness \u2013 of the JHO warehouse at\nthe docks in Montevideo, 1979\n\nThe problem is that so much of our ingrained behaviour has come from the\nformer period, including our tax system. In the UK, income tax was introduced\nby William Pitt the Younger in 1798 to finance the Napoleonic Wars and bolster\nanother distorting fiscal measure, the window tax. Today income tax and\nnational insurance account for about 45 per cent of all taxes raised; while\nnew-build construction is exempt from VAT, fuel duty is only 4 per cent and\nthe aggregates levy, for example, raises only 0.05 per cent. This system of\ntaxation favours capital over labour. If I set up a factory full of workers, I\nwould indirectly pay a lot of tax. If, instead, I invest in machines to do\ntheir jobs, I would pay hardly any. Corporation tax is on profit and the cost\nof feeding and watering robots is tax-deductible. Not so with labour. The tax\nis taken from wages before humans pay for their food.\n\nMany people have called for tax policy to be set to counter carbon use.\nWriting in 2019 in The Guardian, John Vidal said that we should tax cement and\nother high-carbon materials directly, returning the proceeds to people as tax\nbreaks. He argued that carbon taxes and trading measures adopted so far have\nbeen ineffective in changing industrial behaviour. On the issue of tax\ninequality between machines and humans, Bill Gates says robots should be taxed\nto pay for the social adjustment of the people whose jobs they are replacing.\nNew York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has called for an automation policy designed\nto protect the 36 million jobs that may be made obsolete by technology by\n2030. As early as 1976, Walter Stahel wrote The Potential for Substituting\nManpower for Energy, with the idea that human labour used in repair and\nmaintenance could replace the energy costs associated with discarding and\nremanufacturing broken products with machines. All these issues arise from the\ncost of labour relative to machines and the idea that it isn\u2019t worth our time\nto be materially frugal.\n\nsP+a creating an undulating brick roof that seems to rise out of the ground of\nthe Maya Somaiya school library, 2018\n\nCredit:Edmund Sumner\n\nIn the 1950s, F\u00e9lix Candela and Eladio Dieste were part of a cohort of\nengineers working in Latin America designing thin shell structures. These\nhighly efficient structural forms use a fraction of the material of\nconventional structures. Although they take much longer to design and need\ncurved formwork, which is much more laborious to build, in that time and place\nlabour was cheap and material was expensive. Pier Luigi Nervi was probably\nworking under similar circumstances during the same period in Italy, where\nhyper-efficient structures like the ribbed dome of the Palazzetto dello Sport\nare arrestingly beautiful and take on a sophistication normally only seen in\nthe natural world. This all but forgotten architectural movement is now seen\nas an exotic \u2018future of the past\u2019 and was long ago snuffed out by economics,\nbut it could indicate the nature of a new future.\n\nIn this future we could shift the tax burden from labour to material. The cost\nof lazy material use is now so high that the client is incentivised to\ncarefully choose and pay higher fees to designers with a track record of doing\nmore with less. There are now audited parameters to help them make their\nselection. Designers compete on material economy. Design teams are now formed\nof tightly integrated engineers and architects who have had to hone their\nskills through significant additional training. In the past, design\napproximation led regulators to mandate high levels of strength redundancy or\nsafety factors in structures for public safety. This was materially very\ncostly. The upskilling of practitioners, together with greater time\nallowances, leads to greater precision in design so that now certain firms\ndemonstrating greater acuity are licensed for far lower safety factors than\nbefore. Practitioners can work together to devise audacious ways of making a\nproject economic. Static form-finding can inform every design.\n\nGabinete de Arquitectura building vaults out of rubble and ceramic tiles at\nthe Telet\u00f3n Children\u2019s Rehabilitation Centre, 2010\n\nCredit:Federico Cairoli\n\nContemporary practices doing more with less include: 24H Architecture working\nwith locally sourced bamboo and labour for the Children\u2019s Activity and\nLearning Centre in Koh Kood, 2009\n\nCredit:Olav Bruin\n\nIn this future, a client needs a building with a basement. The upper floors\nare heavily loaded so an optimised floor slab is needed. The best possible\npeople are used. Jana, a specialist formworker, is brought in. She is trained\nnot only in carpentry but also in statics and stress modelling. She is\nintroduced to the team early on and works with the engineers to find an\nefficient and achievable coffering pattern. After several weeks of iterations,\nthe team has developed a tessellated alligator-skin grid of beams that use a\nset of three repeated shapes which reduces concrete volumes by 70 per cent.\nThe skin of the building needs to be light \u2013 no more neo-Victorian, coal-era\nbrickwork. Jos\u00e9, a fabric facade specialist, is employed, working with them to\nfind a facade shape that suits the anticlastic insulated fabric wrap. Flat\nrectangular basement walls are weak and so these tend to be thick, reinforced\nconcrete. Jack, an expert in three-dimensional soil analysis, develops\nellipsoid plan forms that require very thin stone compression shells instead.\nThe drawings and design documents are triple-checked as errors create waste.\nConstruction is planned meticulously. Finishes are a thing of the past \u2013\nstructures have to be beautifully made and so construction work is done slowly\nand carefully. The work is brought to fruition by workers who have trained for\nyears in their areas of expertise, take great pride in their output and are\nnow better paid.\n\nIn this possible future, there are more jobs but industrial production is\nfalling. Sustainability hasn\u2019t meant less economy or less enrichment: it has\nmeant less waste. It has meant less exploitation of material and energy in\nexchange for more human activity. It has meant better employment using more\nskill and intelligence in the way we work. In this possible future, wages are\nhigher, pollution and carbon dioxide levels are dropping and, most\nimportantly, the story doesn\u2019t end with dust bowls, \u2018black blizzards\u2019 or dead\nhens.\n\n2021-06-15\n\nEllen Peirson\n\nComment\n\nShare\n\n### AR June 2021\n\nWaste\n\nBuy Now\n\nPlease remember that the submission of any material is governed by our Terms\nand Conditions and by submitting material you confirm your agreement to these\nTerms and Conditions.
