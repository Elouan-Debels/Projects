Applying algorithms that some - these days - might call AI\nto improve noise cancellation or image processing is a good thing. Yet a\nbutton on a mouse that fires up a dialog to create ChatGPT prompts seem like\noverkill. Like the Copilot key.\n\nWe tried out the Logi AI Prompt Builder, so readers don't have to. The prompt\nbuilder is fired up using the Logi + Option app, after which the user can\ncreate a shortcut key on the Logitech mouse or keyboard. Alternatively,\nthere's the dedicated AI prompt button if you buy the new Signature AI mouse.\n\nAny text the user selects will automatically be captured, and the user can\nthen use a recipe to turn that text into a prompt that is acceptable to\nChatGPT, after which it can do the work a user wants it to do.\n\nDefaults include the option to create an email, summarize text, and so on.\nDepending on the recipe, there are also options including length, style, and\ntone. Click submit, and the prompt is passed to ChatGPT, which will obediently\ngenerate a response.\n\nAnd that really is it. It's a tool to convert text into something that ChatGPT\ncan grok, thus allowing it to give a desired response. This defeats the object\nof a chatbot while also handily highlighting one of the major flaws of the\ncurrent crop of generative AI services: users need to be able to write an\neffective prompt that will make the service produce the desired outcome.\n\nSome might say it is almost like knowing how to write a database query or\ngetting a search engine to find what is needed.\n\n  * Logitech MX Brio 705 \u2013 where Ultra HD meets Ultra AI\n  * Logitech warns of logistical impact of Houthi attacks in Red Sea\n  * Logitech's Wave Keys tries to bend ergonomics without breaking tradition\n  * Microsoft postpones death date for personally licensed Teams Rooms hardware\n\nA Logitech spokesperson told The Register that its \"main goal is around\nenhancing productivity.\n\n\"As GenAI becomes a firmer fixture of day to day workflows, the idea of this\ntool is that it's a quick shortcut that helps you get to ChatGPT quicker and\nbuild more effective prompts. Even if it's two minutes saved each time, if\nthat's five times in a day, in Logitech's eyes that's 10 minutes saved to do\nsomething more creative/rewarding, which is a win!\"\n\nLogitech builds some great hardware. What it has created here serves only to\nhighlight one of the major limitations of AI services in 2024: a user has to\nknow how to create prompts to get the most out of generative AI. The fact that\nthe company has identified this need indicates that AI companies have more\nwork to do before their bots are truly chatty. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Logitech\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Logitech\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n12 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Logitech\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Logitech\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Google Cloud chief is really psyched about this AI thing\n\nCloud Next We're on a highway to ML\n\nPaaS + IaaS8 days | 6\n\n#### AI spam is winning the battle against search engine quality\n\ninterview 'Not all AI content is spam, but I think right now all spam is AI\ncontent'\n\nAI + ML4 days | 34\n\n#### What's up with AI lately?
