An image of the ASCA-1 reusable\nsatellite launch vehicle\n\nThe Yomiuri Shimbun\n\n12:46 JST, April 8, 2024\n\nTokyo-based startup Innovative Space Carrier Inc. announced Thursday that it\nwill develop a reusable satellite launch vehicle in collaboration with a U.S\nrocket engine developer. The company says it aims to test-fly \u201cASCA-1\u201d in the\nUnited States as early as next year.\n\nAt ISC, which was established in May 2022, former rocket engineers at major\nmanufacturers work to develop crewed space planes, such as space shuttles in\nthe United States.\n\nAccording to the announcement, ISC signed a partnership with Ursa Major\nTechnologies Inc. (UM), a U.S.-based rocket developer founded by people\nincluding a former engineer at leading space company SpaceX. UM has the\ntechnology to build rocket engines in a short period of time using 3D\nprinters.\n\nISC will shorten development time by installing rocket engines built by UM on\nits rocket. The company will conduct a test flight in the United States as\nearly as next year to launch the rocket to an altitude of several kilometers\nand land it.\n\nIn March, ISC founded a U.S. subsidiary for the business partnership. Since\nexporting rocket technologies that can be used for military purposes is\nprohibited, test flights will be conducted in the United States for the time\nbeing.\n\nISC Chief Executive Officer Kojiro Hatada said at a press conference in Tokyo,\n\u201cWe have the goal of developing a rocket capable of launching satellites in\nthe next five years and aim to develop crewed space transportation systems in\nthe future.\u201d\n\nAdd TheJapanNews to your Google News feed.\n\n## Companies Latest Articles\n\n  * ### Toyota to Be Responsible for Daihatsu Compact Car Development\n\n  * ### CEO: TSMC to Build Another Plant in Kumamoto Pref.\n\n  * ### Nissan Ineligible for Wage Hike-Related Preferential Tax Treatmen...\n\n  * ### Musk Says Tesla Will Unveil 'Robotaxi' on August 8\n\n## Latest Articles\n\n  * ### New Volcano Research Headquarters to Come Up with Policy by Summe...\n\n  * ### AUKUS Nations Considering Cooperating with Japan\n\n  * ### Seiya Suzuki Hits a Double; Yu Darvish Lasts Only Three Innings,...\n\n  * ### Overseas Sites Allow Betting on Japanese High School Baseball Cha...\n\n## Popular Articles\n\n  * ### M6.0 Earthquake Hits Japan\u2019s Tohoku Region; Fukushima, Iwate, Miy...\n\n  * ### Tsunami Advisory for Okinawa Lifted at Noon (UPDATE 2)\n\n  * ### Strong Earthquake Rocks Southern Part of Kyushu; No Risk of a Tsu...\n\n  * ### Strong Quake Rocks Okinawa Prefecture; Tsunami Warnings Issued (U...\n\n  * ### Tsunami Warning Sends Okinawa Residents, Tourists Rushing to High...\n\n  * ### Netherlands Consul General Envisions 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo as Ra...\n\n  * ### Princess Kako to visit Greece in late May; Courtesy Visit to Pres...\n\n  * ### Search Continues for Missing People After 72-Hour Window Ends in ...\n\n## \"Business\" POPULAR ARTICLE\n\n  * ### BOJ Chief Denies Possible Surge in Deposit, Lending Rates\n\n  * ### BOJ to Discuss Ending Negative Rate Policy\n\n  * ### Bank of Japan Considering Major Changes to Monetary Policy; May Lift Negative Interest Rate Policy\n\n  * ### Dollar Tops 151 Yen for 1st Time in 4 Months\n\n  * ### Nikkei Stock Average Hits Record High\n\nJN ACCESS RANKING\n\n  * BOJ Chief Denies Possible Surge in Deposit, Lending Rates\n\n  * BOJ to Discuss Ending Negative Rate Policy\n\n  * Bank of Japan Considering Major Changes to Monetary Policy; May Lift Negative Interest Rate Policy\n\n  * Dollar Tops 151 Yen for 1st Time in 4 Months\n\n  * Nikkei Stock Average Hits Record High\n\nThe Japan News / Weekly Edition\n\nOur weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting,\nreadable fomat.\n\nRead more\n\n  *     1. eng\n\n    2. jp\n\n    3.
