However, hybrid perovskite\nsolar cells are yet to make an impact beyond the research community, with\ntranslation to large-area devices fabricated by industry-relevant\nmanufacturing methods remaining a critical challenge. Here we report the first\ndemonstration of hybrid perovskite solar cell modules, comprising serially-\ninterconnected cells, produced entirely using industrial roll-to-roll printing\ntools under ambient room conditions. As part of this development, costly\nvacuum-deposited metal electrodes are replaced with printed carbon electrodes.\nA high-throughput experiment involving the analysis of batches of 1600 cells\nproduced using 20 parameter combinations enabled rapid optimisation over a\nlarge parameter space. The optimised roll-to-roll fabricated hybrid perovskite\nsolar cells show power conversion efficiencies of up to 15.5% for individual\nsmall-area cells and 11.0% for serially-interconnected cells in large-area\nmodules. Based on the devices produced in this work, a cost of ~0.7 USD W^\u22121\nis predicted for a production rate of 1,000,000 m2 per year in Australia, with\npotential for further significant cost reductions.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Scalable fabrication and coating methods for perovskite solar cells and\nsolar modules\n\nArticle 19 February 2020\n\nNam-Gyu Park & Kai Zhu\n\n### High-speed sequential deposition of photoactive layers for organic solar\ncell manufacturing\n\nArticle 27 October 2022\n\nRui Sun, Tao Wang, ...

Paetzold\n\n## Introduction\n\nOrganic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) are a promising next-\ngeneration photovoltaic (PV) technology that has a demonstrated power\nconversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1%^1. Despite the record efficiencies being\ncompetitive with the market incumbent technology, crystalline Si PV with 26.8%\nPCE^1, numerous challenges must be addressed for PeSCs to be realised in real-\nworld applications. Foremost is the need to translate small-area lab-scale\ncells, which are often fabricated using materials or methods that are not\neconomically viable or scalable, to large-area devices produced by high-\nvolume, low-cost manufacturing methods. As shown by other solar PV\ntechnologies with high PCEs, such as inorganic multi-junction or GaAs cells, a\nfailure to lower production costs will prevent PeSCs from making an impact in\nthe marketplace^2,3.\n\nA key difference between PeSCs and conventional inorganic PV technologies is\nthe potential for low-cost and low-energy manufacturing using solution-based\nindustrial processes, such as spray^4,5,6, blade^7,8,9 and slot-die (SD)\ncoating^10,11,12,13,14,15. Recent advances in large-area glass-based PeSCs\nhave resulted in promising efficiencies of up to 25.8%^16,17,18,19. However,\nthese devices have been produced using discrete sheet-to-sheet processing,\nutilise vacuum-based evaporation steps, and employ subtractive laser-\npatterning to achieve interconnections for large-area modules. These\nrequirements will add challenges in lowering the cost of large-scale\nproduction. In contrast, flexible PeSCs enable high-volume and high-throughput\nmanufacturing using continuous roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing\ntechniques^20,21,22. The lightweight and physical flexibility of flexible\nPeSCs also offer the prospect of solar PV panels having high specific power\n(power-to-weight ratio), which is highly desirable for emerging applications,\nincluding space^3, vehicle-integrated PV, and building-integrated PV^2,23.\nHowever, the process of manufacturing PeSCs on a continuously-moving flexible\nplastic substrate imposes several technical challenges, particularly time and\ntemperature processing limitations^24.\n\nBeyond advancing the manufacturing process, replacing the high-cost components\nin the solar cell architecture with cheaper alternatives while retaining\ncomparable performance remains a persistent challenge. The highest cost\ncomponent is the vacuum-processed Au electrode, followed by commercially\nproduced transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs). Vacuum deposition is\ncostly, and the nature of the process is unsuitable for use with a\nconventional R2R manufacturing line. There have been several reports of\nsolution-processed back electrodes in glass-based devices^25,26,27, but their\nprocessing involved a prolonged high-temperature step that is neither\ncompatible with flexible plastic substrates nor suitable for R2R-based\nupscaling due to time constraints in the continuous process. Due to these\ntechnical challenges, the first example of a small-area PeSC (0.09 cm^2 active\narea) having all layers deposited on a flexible plastic substrate using R2R\nprocesses was only very recently reported (in February 2023)^28 with\nindividual cells displaying PCEs of up to 10.8%. While the first report marked\na significant milestone in the field, the efficiency was still far from that\nof typical research cells and only small cells were demonstrated.\n\nHere we report the fabrication of entirely R2R-printed individual PeSCs with a\nrecord-high 15.5% PCE. We also report the first demonstration of PeSC modules\nproduced using only industry-relevant R2R fabrication techniques, and under\nambient room conditions. This was achieved by developing: (i) a robust and\nscalable deposition technique, (ii) perovskite-friendly carbon inks to replace\nvacuum-based electrodes, and (iii) a R2R-based high-throughput experimental\nplatform as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The latter mimics manufacturing processes\nto produce and test thousands of research cells a day. This allowed the\nseamless translation from the miniature factory to the full-scale R2R\nfabrication of PeSC modules (~50 cm2 active area) exhibiting up to 11% PCE.\nThe future prospects of the printed PeSCs are evaluated by considering\nmanufacturing costs for various production scenarios calculated using cost\nmodels based on the production methods and materials used in the present work,\ntogether with the resulting device efficiencies.\n\nFig. 1: Schematic illustration of the workflow of this work.\n\na A reliable SD coating process and a perovskite-friendly carbon ink are\ndeveloped to enable vacuum-free perovskite PV production. The carbon ink is\nupscaled using a three-roll mill and used to optimise device parameters by\nfabricating and testing numerous research cells using an automated roll-to-\nroll research platform. b Schematic illustration of roll-to-roll production of\nmodules using SD coating, reverse gravure (RG) coating and screen printing. c\nThe detailed structure of the series connected module, which is fully roll-to-\nroll fabricated on commercially available transparent electrodes.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Results\n\n### Control of perovskite crystallisation for upscaling\n\nAlthough spin coating has been widely adopted to produce efficient PeSCs, the\ndeposition and drying parameters are significantly different in R2R\nproduction. As such, it is necessary to initially develop processing\nconditions using R2R or R2R-compatible methods. The introduction of the\nprinting-friendly sequential deposition (PFSD) technique by select co-authors\nof this work in 2017^13 enabled the demonstration of the first PeSCs\ncomprising R2R-deposited electron-transport layer (ETL), light-absorbing\nlayer, and hole-transport layer (HTL), with up to 11% PCE achieved for a\nsmall-area device. Since then we also developed more facile single-step\ndeposition techniques via the introduction of various additives such as\npolymers, ammonium salts, and 2D organic cations together with heating and\nnitrogen blowing^12,29,30,31,32,33, and investigated R2R techniques reported\nby others^10,11,15,24,34. Although it was possible to produce the perovskite\nlayer in a single-step deposition, we found no approach that significantly\noutperforms PFSD for R2R-based upscaling.\n\nThe PFSD approach is described as \u2018printing friendly\u2019 due to its robustness\nand reliability under ambient conditions, and the absence of time-consuming\nprocessing steps. The key to PFSD is adding organic cations at a loading of\nless than 50 mol% of PbI_2, far below the stoichiometric amount required to\nform perovskite crystals. This strategy retards crystallization and the\nprecursor thin-film behaves like an amorphous material with much better film-\nforming properties than crystalline analogues. When additional organic cation\nis subsequently deposited, the reactive amorphous-phase film quickly converts\nto a perovskite without needing to remove the additive as it becomes a part of\nthe perovskite. This allows the conversion to be completed on a time scale\nsuitable for R2R processing.\n\nOur further development of the PFSD method resulted in up to 17.9% PCE from\nR2R-fabricated PeSCs with vacuum-deposited Au electrodes, as discussed in\nSupplementary Note 2. One significant innovation in the PFSD technique is the\nintroduction of a shallow-angle blowing technique, (Fig. 2a) as opposed to the\nconventional blowing technique applied at a right angle, used to fabricate\nhigh-quality perovskite films involving blowing gas across the substrate^35.\nWhile effective at a laboratory scale, creating a highly uniform gas flow over\na large area is challenging. The shallow-angle blowing on the edge of a roller\nis a simple but effective way to upscale this process, and the angle of\nincidence can be easily adjusted to levels that can approach zero degrees by\nsimply changing the blower-head position. Utilising this approach, the SD-\ncoated wet films are not deformed by an aggressive air flow before entering\nthe well-defined solidification zone. This significantly reduces the amount of\ncrystalline defects, and amorphous glassy films can be fabricated that are\nthen converted instantly to a perovskite when the methyl ammonium iodide (MAI)\nsolution is deposited, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 2: Reliable fabrication of high-quality perovskite film by the edge-\nblowing technique.\n\na Schematic illustration of the edge-blowing technique in the roll-to-roll\nprocess. b An image (reflection mode) of perovskite films after MAI\ndeposition.

(The large peak at 27\u00b0 is PET and the peak at 10.4\u00b0\nis hydrated perovskite of the air-exposed sample.) Source data are provided\nwith this paper.\n\nFull size image\n\nFigure 2b shows the improved quality of the perovskite film fabricated with\nthe edge-blowing technique. The inset photograph shows the flawless mirror-\nlike perovskite film continuously fabricated under ambient conditions (40\u201350%\nrelative humidity). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the film does not\nindicate the presence of PbI_2 crystals, which would be evidence of ion\nmigration followed by inhomogeneous local concentration in the solidification\nprocess. Shallow-angle blowing produced an intermediate layer that appeared to\nbe amorphous or comprised of small enough grains that allowed for rapid and\ncomplete conversion to perovskite upon MAI deposition. Notably, this could not\nbe examined directly as the reactive and unstable intermediate films\ncontinuously change upon exposure to air. Scanning electron microscope (SEM)\nimages in Supplementary Fig. 2 show more homogenous films with compact grains\nof the shallow-angle-blown sample compared to the right-angle-blown sample.\nThe introduction of the shallow-angle blowing not only improved the quality of\nthe perovskite and the reliability of device performance, but also enhanced\nhumidity tolerance (as discussed later), making the PFSD approach a suitable\ntechnique for low-cost manufacturing.\n\n### Automated, ambient, and vacuum-free device fabrication\n\nThe discovery of R2R-printable electrodes for PeSCs has long been a critical\nchallenge in the realisation of fully R2R-fabricated vacuum-free cells. To\ndate, most R2R-fabricated PeSCs in the literature incorporate vacuum or batch-\nprocessed back electrodes. The first fully R2R-fabricated PeSC was reported\nrecently using a printed carbon electrode, achieving a PCE of 10.8%^28. The\nefficiency was significantly lower than vacuum-based counterparts, suggesting\nperformance degradation caused by the carbon ink. Therefore, we developed\nperovskite-friendly carbon inks and trialled them alongside commercially\navailable carbon pastes, as discussed in Supplementary Note 3.\n\nReplacing this vacuum process, which is not only costly but also time\nconsuming, has the additional benefit of creating a new avenue for\nexperimental optimisation. While such an approach improves throughput for\nconventional R2R systems with manual operation^36, its full potential is\nrealised with the development of a programmable R2R SD coater for unmanned\noperation, allowing for the fabrication of thousands of unique PeSCs daily.\nManual characterisation of this many cells is not practical. We therefore\ndeveloped an automated R2R tester to test over ten thousand solar cells a day.\nDevice parameters were automatically calculated and saved online, permitting\nthe analysis of thousands of solar cells in minutes, rather than hours or\ndays. The custom-built R2R research tools are shown in Fig. 3a, b, and\ndemonstrations of the system can be seen in the Supplementary Information.\nFigure 3c shows the device layout and testing setup for the high-throughput\ntesting of R2R-fabricated solar cells.\n\nFig. 3: Automated fabrication of 1600 PeSCs in one experiment.\n\na The custom-built R2R SD coater used for the fabrication of thousands of\nunique solar cells in a day. b The custom-built automatic solar tester with a\ndaily throughput of over 10,000 cells. c Schematic illustration of the\nautomatic testing setup. d\u2013h An example of a high-throughput R2R experiment to\nscreen deposition parameters of the perovskite layer of PeSCs with a\nconfiguration: flexible TCE/SnO_2/FA_0.45MA_0.55PbI_3/PPDT2FBT/carbon\nelectrode.

Source data are provided\nwith this paper.\n\nFull size image\n\nThis high-throughput experimental platform enabled us to explore the extensive\nfabrication parameters of vacuum-free PeSCs to rapidly identify the optimal\nconditions. Figure 3d\u2013h show an example of the high-throughput R2R experiment,\nin this case being used to optimise deposition parameters for PbI_2 with 45\nmol% formamidinium iodide (FA) and MAI solutions and to identify composition-\ndependant device parameters. Three PbI_2 conditions were selected to fabricate\nperovskite layers of about 600 nm to 1000 nm thickness. This range is somewhat\nthicker than typical vacuum-deposited electrode devices due to the absence of\na mirror effect from the carbon-based back electrode. Also, a perfectly\nmatched stoichiometry is not necessarily the best formulation in the\nFA_0.45MA_0.55PbI_3 system, as it can benefit from either a slight excess of\nlead^37,38,39 or a cation-excessive composition^40. Therefore, the ability of\nSD coating to give quantitative control over the amount of material deposited\nallowed for the amount of MAI present in the perovskite layer to be varied\nfrom slightly cation deficient (lead-excessive composition) through to\nstoichiometric and slightly excessive compositions for each PbI_2 condition.\nThe MAI-deposition flow rate was varied between 30 and 100 \u03bcL min^\u22121 in 10 \u03bcL\nmin^\u22121 intervals. Figure 3h shows the deposition parameters together with the\nPCEs of 1600 consecutively fabricated PeSCs with 20 deposition parameters\ndepending on the position along a 9 m-long substrate. The PeSCs were obtained\nin a roll form and the roll was transferred to the automatic R2R PV tester\nshown in Fig. 3b.\n\nFigure 3d\u2013h show statistical device parameters obtained from 80 cells for each\ncondition. A thickness-tolerance hole transport material,\npoly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole)]\n(PPDT2FBT)^41 (further discussion on the material choice can be seen in\nSupplementary Note 3), which was used to screen carbon inks was used as an HTL\nin these devices. The devices with an MAI content close to the stoichiometric\namount show better performance than others. The thinnest condition (16 \u03bcL\nmin^\u22121) shows the best performance at the stoichiometric amount and\nperformance decreases rapidly with an excess of MAI or PbI_2. Thicker films\nshow more interesting behaviour; MAI-deficient films show better fill factor\n(FF) with narrow performance variations, while films with excess MAI show\nhigher short-circuit current (J_sc). Most importantly, these results\ndemonstrate the utility of the high-throughput experimental platform by\nidentifying a composition-dependent performance trend in just one day.\n\nA significant improvement in fully R2R-fabricated cells was achieved by\nintroducing a new hole-transport layer (HTL) system. Poly(3-hexylthiophene)\n(P3HT) is a simple, widely used conjugated polymer with good light-harvesting\nand charge-transporting properties^42 that lends itself to low-cost mass\nproduction. While the polymer alone shows relatively poor performance as an\nHTL, it shows promising performance when combined with n-hexyl trimethyl\nammonium bromide (HTAB)^43, which passivates the surface traps of the\nperovskite layer and also provides anchoring points for the hexyl side chain\nof P3HT to self-assemble in the preferred molecular orientation. Despite such\nadvantages, this HTL system has never been used with R2R-fabricated PeSCs,\nlikely due to the technical difficulty of forming an ultra-thin HTAB skin on\nperovskite layers utilising a scalable deposition technique. The fabrication\nof the HTAB skin is achieved through delicate control of surface reactivity by\nadjusting the ratio of relatively nonpolar and less reactive chlorobenzene to\n2-propanol solvents. A uniform P3HT layer was achieved by heating the\nsubstrate to 45 \u00b0C, which lowers the surface tension of the polymer solution\nand promotes the self-assembly of P3HT on the HTAB surface. Without substrate\nheating, P3HT formed poor films on HTAB intermittently, as shown in Fig. 4a.\n\nFig. 4: Reliable fabrication of fully R2R-processed PeSCs.\n\na R2R SD-coated P3HT films on perovskite films with and without gentle heating\nof the coating stage. b Histograms of fully R2R-fabricated PeSCs with a\nconfiguration of flexible TCE/SnO_2/FAI_0.45MA_0.55PbI_3/HTAB-P3HT or\nPPDT2FBT/carbon electrode. c PCE, (d) J_sc, (e) FF, (f) V_oc, and (g)\nhysteresis factor (forward-scan PCE divided by reverse-scan PCE) of the 240\nconsecutively fabricated HTAB-P3HT-based devices. The devices were fabricated\nin uncontrolled ambient conditions on a high-humidity (~60% RH) day.

Source data are provided with this paper.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe HTAB-P3HT HTL clearly outperformed PPDT2FBT, as shown in Fig. 4b. The\ndevices not only showed higher performance but also improved reliability,\nindicated by the narrower distribution in the histogram. All device\nparameters, including the hysteresis factor of the HTAB-P3HT-based devices,\ncan be seen in Fig. 4c\u2013g. The figures show the parameters of the unfiltered\n240 cells that were consecutively fabricated using the automated R2R SD\ncoater. The substrate consists of blocks of 40 electrodes, separated by a 2 cm\ngap which can be seen in the data. The experiment was carried out under\nuncontrolled ambient conditions on a day with high relative humidity (~60%\nRH), demonstrating the robustness of the manufacturing process. In general,\nwhile the best devices were obtained on days with low humidity (30-40% RH),\nreliable production of PeSCs with an average PCE of ~13% was confirmed,\nregardless of the humidity in the lab. The J-V curve and IPCE spectrum of the\nbest-performing device are shown in Fig. 4h, i, respectively, with 15.5% PCE,\n19.9 mA cm^\u22122 J_sc, 76.1% FF and 1.02 V V_oc. The IPCE spectrum shows good\nagreement with a calculated current density of 19.4 mA cm^\u22122.\n\n### Transitioning from cells to modules\n\nThe optimised device fabrication parameters were used to produce large-area\nmodules. Since all processes were developed by scalable deposition methods,\nmodules could be fabricated in the same way using larger SD heads, as shown in\nFig. 5a, and a 10 cm wide substrate with a pre-patterned TCE. The SD heads\nhave five channels (a detailed structure can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 3),\nand hence the optimised flow rate was simply multiplied by five to produce\nfive-cell modules. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows images of high-quality\nperovskite stripes produced continuously using the R2R SD coating method. The\nHTAB and P3HT layers were also deposited at a flow rate five times higher than\nthe optimised flow rate for single-stripe coating.\n\nFig. 5: R2R production of perovskite PV modules.\n\na Image showing the deposition of the perovskite layer using a 5-channel SD\ncoater. The deposition of non-stoichiometric perovskite precursor solution,\nblow-drying, and the conversion to perovskite by SD coating the MAI solution\nwere carried out in one coating run. b Image showing the RG-coated carbon film\non the TCE/ETL/perovskite/HTL stack. c Image of the R2R-screen-printed\nperovskite PV modules.

Source\ndata are provided with this paper.\n\nFull size image\n\nFor the R2R-deposited electrode, the carbon ink was deposited using the\nreverse gravure (RG) technique^44. The modules were completed by R2R screen\nprinting a silver paste on the carbon film using an industrial R2R screen\nprinter, shown in Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 5. The printed silver was\nused to form charge-collection grids and interconnect the 5 individual cells,\nas illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5d. It was crucial to incorporate\nadditional conductive elements alongside the carbon layer, which had a sheet\nresistance of approximately 800\u03a9 sq^\u22121. Supplementary Fig. 11 illustrates that\ncells without a grid design exhibited significantly poorer performance\ncompared to those with grids. Nonetheless, excessively covering the screen-\nprinted silver led to a decline in performance, most likely due to solvent\ndamage to the underlying layers. Consequently, we designed the silver pattern\nto achieve minimal coverage while maintaining adequate conductivity, at least\nsurpassing that of the front electrode, for efficient charge collection. We\ndetermined that a 0.2 mm line with a 180 mesh screen provided the finest\npattern that we could consistently print onto the carbon surface, and this\nparameter was adopted for the module.\n\nThe interconnection of cells was formed through gaps between the stripe\npatterns at the same time as the grid. The active area is 49.5 cm^2 (1.1 cm \u00d7\n9 cm \u00d7 5 cells) and the geometric fill factor (GFF), as defined as the cell\narea over total area (cell area + gap area)^45 of the modules, is 75%. The GFF\nis somewhat lower than that of laser scribed modules with a demonstrated GFF\nof up to 99%^46 due to the inherent limitation of the stripe-pattern approach.\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the laser scribing process may not be suitable\nfor the high-throughput, cost-effective manufacturing of PeSCs. Therefore, our\nnext challenge lies in developing modules with higher GFFs and larger areas\nwhile continuing to enhance cell efficiencies through scalable processes.\n\nThe entirely R2R-fabricated modules demonstrated up to 11.0% active-area-based\nPCE with 192 mA current output, 62.3% FF and 4.59 V V_oc in a reverse scan and\n9.96% PCE in a forward scan. This efficiency is lower than the small cells,\nlikely due to the loss of FF caused by the high resistance of the TCE and\npartial solvent damage incurred during the screen-printing process.\nNonetheless, this report marks a significant milestone in the development of\nfully R2R-fabricated PeSCs.\n\nThe efficiencies obtained in this work are compared with the previous records\nof various PeSCs, as summarised in Fig. 5e and detailed in Supplementary Table\n1. Flexible PeSCs have always shown inferior performance compared to their\nglass-based counterparts due to the intrinsic performance limitation of the\nflexible TCEs. Therefore, batch-processed flexible PeSCs are a more suitable\nbenchmark for R2R PeSCs as they share the same intrinsic properties. While the\nperformances of R2R devices still trail those of batch-processed analogues,\nthis work demonstrates significant progress towards achieving high-efficiency\nflexible devices. Considering the low-cost nature and the scalability of the\nR2R-printed carbon electrode, achieving over 15% PCE represents a major\nmilestone in the development of this technology. Through market surveys and\nconsidering advantages in the form factor, we established that R2R PeSCs could\nbecome competitive in the portable PV market at >10% PCE^47. Therefore, the\ndemonstration of an 11% R2R-fabricated module is a significant step forward in\ncommercialising this technology. However, the printed silver used in this work\nmay not be suitable for long-term operation for commercial applications due to\nthe corrosion issue. The next challenge would be developing a perovskite-\nfriendly conductive carbon ink that is at least as conductive as TCEs to\nproduce efficient silver-free PeSC modules.\n\n### Towards ultra-low-cost manufacturing\n\nThis work aimed to develop low-cost manufacturing technologies for PeSCs.\nTherefore, we developed a cost model based on our previous work^47 which\nimplemented the new materials, processes and device configurations used in\nthis work, as shown in Fig. 6a. Further details of the cost model can be seen\nin Supplementary Note 4. In addition to the demonstrated devices, a model\ndevice architecture (Sequence C) is also considered to predict the potential\nfor further cost reduction by eliminating the remaining high-cost components,\ni.e., commercial TCEs and silver grids.\n\nFig. 6: Technoeconomic analysis of R2R-produced perovskite PV modules.\n\na Device configurations used for the analysis. Sequence (seq.) A: high-cost\nand high-performance option, seq. B: fully R2R-fabricated device, and seq. C:\nultra-low-cost printing option to be pursued. Cost breakdown for (b) seq. A\nand (c) seq. B. Projected production costs of the modules (d) per module area\nand (e) per peak watt for all three sequences based on 17.9%, 15.5%, and 10%\nPCE, respectively.\n\nFull size image\n\nFigure 6b, c show the cost fraction of each functional layer and corresponding\ncapital costs for sequences A and B. For the vacuum-deposited electrode (Seq.\nA), a combination of the gold material and the equipment purchase and running\ncosts of a R2R evaporator, is the highest cost component, followed by the\ncommercial TCE. Other significant material costs include the encapsulation\nmaterials and the HTL whilst the costs of the ETL and perovskite are\nnegligible in comparison. The fully printed configuration, Seq. B, shown in\nFig. 6c, shows a significant reduction in the back electrode cost, resulting\nin only two high-cost components; the commercial TCE, and the encapsulation\nmaterial.\n\nFigure 6d, e show the production cost of encapsulated flexible perovskite\nsolar modules per unit area (m2) and peak power (W_p), respectively. The best\n(not average) efficiencies obtained in this work are used for Seq. A (17.9%)\nand B (15.5%) to calculate $ Wp^\u22121. Since Seq. C is not experimentally\ndemonstrated here, we have considered it with our highest recorded efficiency\nto date, achieved for a HTL-free and vacuum-free device (10%), as the most\noptimistic scenario. The figures clearly show the cost benefits of the carbon-\nelectrode-based devices for both area and power-related cost metrics. The cost\nfor Seq. B is likely to be lower than 1 USD W^\u22121, and Seq. C could be lower\nthan 0.5 USD W^\u22121. These represent a significant reduction to the cost\nestimate from previous works of around 1.5 USD W^\u22121^47. This results from a\nsimilar or lower cost in $ m^\u22122, and a higher recorded efficiency. However,\nthe technology is still not able to compete with mass-produced silicon solar\ncells, for which module spot prices have been lower than 0.30 USD W^\u22121^48.\nDespite this, opportunities may exist in niche markets that value the\nlightweight and flexible nature of these modules, as discussed in our previous\nwork^47. The next step for the technology would be exploring high-value PV\nmarkets at the predicted manufacturing costs while addressing the remaining\nhigh-cost components to sustainably advance the technology towards\ncommercialisation. Supplementary Fig. 12, with about 5 USD m^\u22122 module cost\n(excluding encapsulation), shows the potential for the further cost reduction\nby eliminating the remaining high-cost components.\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully addressed the key challenges for low-cost\nroll-to-roll production of large-area perovskite solar modules and\ndemonstrated the world-first fully roll-to-roll-fabricated perovskite solar\nmodules (including back electrodes) on a commercial substrate. A perovskite-\nfriendly carbon ink was developed to replace vacuum-processed metal\nelectrodes, the highest-cost component in perovskite solar cells. This enabled\nthe high-throughput, vacuum-free fabrication of perovskite solar cells using\nonly roll-to-roll processes. Automated roll-to-roll fabrication and testing\nsystems were developed to take full advantage of high-throughput fabrication,\nallowing thousands of research cells to be fabricated and tested in a single\nday to rapidly improve roll-to-roll experimentation. Further optimisation of\nthe process and device configuration enabled fully roll-to-roll fabricated\nperovskite solar cells with up to 15.5% PCE, which represents the record\nefficiency for fully roll-to-roll fabricated perovskite solar cells to date.\nAll developments in this work were performed with due consideration to\nupscaling, leading to the first demonstration of fully roll-to-roll printed\nperovskite solar modules with up to 11% PCE based on the active area of the\nmodule ~50 cm2. Finally, the cost model developed in this work predicts the\nprojected manufacturing cost of modules likely to be ~0.7 USD W_p^\u22121 with the\npotential for substantial further reduction via replacing remaining high-cost\ncomponents with low-cost alternatives. This work demonstrates significant\nprogress of the perovskite solar technology towards low-cost at-scale\ncommercial manufacturing.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Materials\n\nMaterials for the preparation of flexible solar cells, lead(II) iodide\n(99.9985%) and tin(IV) oxide (15 wt% in H_2O colloidal dispersion) were\npurchased from Alfa Aesar. MAI (99.99%), FAI (99.99%) and n-hexyl trimethyl\nammonium bromide (HTAB) were purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials.\nCommercially available TCE substrates with a sheet resistance of 8 \u03a9 sq^\u22121\n(OPV8) were sourced from MekoPrint. Hole-transport materials\npoly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole)]\n(PPDT2FBT), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Lisicon SP001) and\n2,2\u2019,7,7\u2019-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)\u22129,9\u2019-spirobifluorene (Spiro-\nMeOTAD) were purchased from 1-Materials, Merck and Luminescence Technology\nCorp. (Lumtec), respectively. FK209 was purchased from Lumtec. Silver paste\n(PV416) was purchased from DuPont. All other chemicals, including 4-tert-\nbutylpyridine (t-BP), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiNTf_2),\ndichlorobenzene (99%), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (99.8%), and anhydrous\n2-propanol (99.5%), and acetonitrile were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich and used\nas received.\n\n### Ink Preparation for R2R coatings\n\nTo prepare stock solutions for reverse gravure (RG) coating, a mixture of 10\nmL of a 15 wt.% solution of tin(IV) oxide and 5 mL of deionised water was used\nwithout any additives. The stock solution could be used for several RG coating\ntrials over a few weeks. For SD coating, stock solutions were prepared by\nmixing 5 ml of the 15 wt% solution, 10 ml of deionised water and 15 \u03bcl of\nacetic acid. For the perovskite layer, a fresh PbI_2:FAI solution was prepared\nby dissolving 1.1 mmol (507 mg) PbI_2 and 0.45 mol% (0.5 mmol, 0.85 mg) FAI\nper 1 ml of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide in a nitrogen-filled glove box,\nand stirred at 70 \u00b0C for approximately 1 h. The solution was cooled to ambient\ntemperature before transferring to a SD head. The MAI solution for the second\nstep of the deposition was made by stirring 40 mg of MAI per 1 ml of anhydrous\n2-propanol for 10 min at ambient temperature. 1.0 mM of HTAB solution was\nprepared in a mixed solvent (chlorobenzene:isopropanol = 9:1 v/v%). The\nPPDT2FBT and P3HT HTM solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 mg of PPDT2FBT\nper 1 ml of dichlorobenzene and 5 mg of P3HT in 1 mL of dichlorobenzene,\nrespectively. Polymers without any dopants were dissolved by stirring at 70 \u00b0C\nfor more than 1 h. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by mixing 6.0 \u00d7\n10^\u22125 mol Spiro-OMeTAD (73 mg), 2.0 \u00d7 10^\u22124 mol t-BP (28.8 \u03bcL), 2.0 \u00d7 10^\u22124\nmol LiNTf_2 (17 \u03bcL of 520 mg mL^\u22121 solution in CH_3CN), and 1.6 \u00d7 10^\u22126 mol\nFK209 (8 \u03bcL of 300 mg mL^\u22121 solution in CH_3CN) in 1 mL chlorobenzene.\n\n### Carbon ink preparation\n\nFor the formulation of the SD ink, ethyl cellulose (EC, Sigma-Aldrich, 200646,\nviscosity 4 cP, 5% in toluene/ethanol) was used as the binder. A 1:1 mixture\nof carbon black (Vulcan XC72, Cabot) and graphene nanoplatelet powder\n(CamGraph G3, Cambridge Nanosystems) was used as the conductive carbon\npigment. Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) was used as the\nsolvent. Due to the low viscosity of the desired SD ink, the ink preparation\nmethod was separated into two stages. In the initial stage, a high-viscosity\nink was produced, which can be processed with a three-roll mill, breaking down\npigment agglomerates into primary particles. For a 500 g ink batch, 40 g of EC\nwas mixed in 330 g of PGMEA, stirred until the binder dissolved completely\n(Supplementary Fig. 9a). Later, 100 g of the solution was reserved for use in\nthe second stage. The remaining 270 g of solution was mixed with 130 g of\nconductive carbon pigment to form a slurry (Supplementary Fig. 9b). This\nmixture was then processed through a three-roll mill, resulting in a uniform\nhigh viscosity ink (Supplementary Fig. 9c). In the second stage, the high\nviscosity ink was diluted to produce an ink that can be used for SD coating.\nThe remaining 100 g of EC/PGMEA was hand-mixed with the high-viscosity ink and\nstirred with a magnetic stir bar until a uniform ink was obtained.\n\n### Small-area cell fabrication\n\nFunctional layers were coated under ambient conditions on a benchtop R2R\ncoater (Mini-LaboTM, Yasui-Seiki) installed in a fume cabinet. A thin layer of\nSnO_2 ETL layer was coated on the flexible TCE substrate as received using the\n10 Wt.% stock solution using reverse-gravure (RG) coating method at 4 rpm RG\nroll (200 R roll) speed, 0.25 m min^\u22121 line speed and a coating width of 13\nmm. The wet film was found to dry immediately and was subsequently moved to a\n> 135 \u00b0C curved hot plate for about 30 s, with hot air blowing at 120 \u00b0C for\nabout 30 s.\n\nThe PET/TCE/SnO_2 film then underwent R2R IR treatment (2\u20133 W cm^\u22122) for about\n5 min using an industrial R2R screen printer (Orthotec SRN3030). The film was\nthen installed back onto the Mini-Labo coater for coating of the perovskite\nlayer. The PbI_2:FAI solution was then SD coated (20 \u03bcL min^\u22121 flow rate, 0.3\nm min^\u22121 web speed, 13 mm coating width) onto the SnO_2 film and the\ncontinuously moving wet film was then subjected to a flow of nitrogen using a\n10 cm-wide air blade installed at the edge of supporting roller about 10 cm\nbehind the coating head and 1\u20132 cm above the substrate. The N_2 flow rate was\nadjusted to about 50\u2013100 L min^\u22121 to form a dried intermediate PbI_2:FAI\nlayer. The MAI solution was then SD coated on the dried intermediate layer\nwith the 60 \u03bcL min^\u22121 solution. Solvent evaporation was promoted by gentle air\nblowing using a small fan placed approximately 20 cm behind of the MAI coating\nhead. The film was then passed over a hot plate at 135 \u00b0C for about 10 s. The\nPET/TCE/SnO_2/Perovskite film was then rewound and the HTAB and the P3HT\nsolutions were deposited sequentially via SD coating at 0.3 m min^\u22121 line\nspeed, first coating the HTAB layer (15 \u03bcL min^\u22121 flow rate, 7 mm coating\nwidth) followed by an annealing step on a curved hotplate at 100 \u00b0C for 30 s\nand then coating the P3HT layer (10 \u03bcL min^\u22121 flow rate, 6 mm coating width)\nby placing the SD head immediately above the second curved hotplate at 45 \u00b1 5\n\u00b0C. Finally, the carbon electrode was SD coated onto the P3HT layer using the\nPGMEA-based carbon ink by placing the SD head immediately above the curved\nhotplate at 70 \u00b0C (120 \u03bcL min^\u22121 flow rate and 5 mm coating width) to remove\nthe solvents on the wet film completely, before an additional annealing step\non the second curved hotplate at 130 \u00b0C. All R2R-processed devices were tested\nboth with and without the additional screen-printed silver grid. The silver\ngrid was screen printed using a semi-auto screen printer (Keywell KY-600FH)\nwith 180 mesh screen onto the top carbon electrode and was annealed at 130 \u00b0C\nfor 30 s on a hot plate.\n\nFor automatic fabrications, a thin SnO_2 ETL layer was prepared by SD coating\nof the 5 wt% solution (65 \u03bcL min^\u22121, 13 mm coating width) with an acetic acid\nadditive at 0.2 m min^\u22121. (See Supplementary Note 1 for further details) The\nfilm was dried with hot air (135 \u00b0C for 5 min) and hot plate (135 \u00b0C for 1\nmin) using the commercial coater and then the film was IR treated as described\nabove. 100 m length rolls are typically prepared and a batch of film could be\nused for multiple experiments over weeks. For other layers, the custom-built\nR2R machine shown in Fig. 3a was used. The same SD heads used in the\ncommercial R2R coater were used in the custom-built machine. Therefore, all\ncoating parameters were interchangeable between the two machines. However, a\nsmaller air blade (13 mm width) with a lower flow rate (~20 L m^\u22121) was used\nfor the nitrogen blowing. Besides the blowing condition, various coating\nparameters for PbI_2 and MAI solutions described in the main text were\ntrialled with the automatic fabrication setup. For the fabrication of HTAB,\nP3HT, PPDT2FBT and carbon layers, the coating conditions described above were\nused in the custom-built machine. Once coating is complete, the roll at the\nwinder was moved to the unwinder so that no rewinding was necessary. The two-\nstep deposition for the perovskite layer was performed in a single pass and\nthe HTAB/P3HT were also deposited in a single pass. So, the fabrication\nrequired total four coating runs (ETL, perovskite, HTL and carbon) and was\ntypically completed within a day. The same-design SD heads could be used for\nall the layers. They were typically cleaned after full disassembly by wiping\nthe remaining inks, followed by ultrasonication in the solvent used in each\nink for 5 min and drying by nitrogen blowing. The sonication and drying steps\nwere repeated two more times, and the cleaning typically took 20 min. The\ntubing was used only once and disposed, except for the SD set for carbon layer\n(including tube, syringe and the ink), which was kept without disassembly in a\nsealed bag and used for multiple batches over months.\n\n### Serially connected module fabrication\n\nFunctional layers were coated under ambient conditions on a benchtop R2R\ncoater (Mini-LaboTM, Yasui-Seiki) installed in a fume cabinet. All\nR2R-processed PeSC modules comprising five series-connected strip cells were\nfabricated on a stripe-patterned (13 mm stripes with 2 mm gap between stripes)\ncommercial TCE. The module has the same configuration as the small cells,\ni.e., PET/TCE/SnO_2 FA_0.45MA_0.55PbI_3/HTAB/P3HT/Carbon/Ag. The SnO_2 ETL\nlayer was deposited by RG coating in the same way as the small cells (200 R\nroll, 4 rpm, and 0.25 m min^\u22121 line speed) but with a roller with 5 stripes.\nThe coating width was the same width as the TCE pattern so that the stripes\nwere made with 0.5\u20131 mm of offset with respect to the patterned TCEs to\nachieve exposed TCE for series connections.\n\nThe remaining layers up to the carbon electrode were coated using the coating\nmethods (SD coating head having five channels to deposit five 13 mm-wide wet\ncoating stripes), line speeds, and the annealing conditions illustrated in the\nprevious section. Flow rates used for the coating of 5 stripes using the\nPbI_2:FAI, MAI, HTAB, P3HT and carbon inks were 100, 300, 140, 92, and 600 \u03bcL\nmin^\u22121, respectively. The P3HT layer was deposited on a custom-built curved\nhot plate fitted with a heating tape (shown in Supplementary Fig. 4b) at 45 \u00b1\n5 \u00b0C. A screen-printed grid using a commercially available Ag ink was used to\nenhance the charge collection of the module and to interconnect the 5 cells in\nseries. Screen printing was performed on an Orthotec-2 R2R screen printing\nsystem. The screen-printed Ag grid was dried using IR irradiance (1.5\u20132 W\ncm^\u22122) and hot air (90 \u00b0C). The active area of each strip cell was typically\n~10 cm^2 (width: ~1.1 cm determined by manually controlled offset and length:\n9.0 cm) resulting in an active module area of ~50 cm^2. The fabrication of R2R\nmodules typically took two days and required two researchers.\n\n### Characterisation methods\n\nManual J-V measurements were undertaken using a solar simulator (Newport\nOriel) in air without encapsulation. The solar simulator was calibrated to\n1-sun (1000 W m^\u22122) AM 1.5 G illumination using a certified Si reference cell\nwith KG-1 filter (Enlitech, certified by Enlitech in accordance with IEC\n60904-1:2006, spectral mismatch factor with carbon-based cells: 0.92) and a\nsource metre (Keithley 2400). Devices were typically kept in air or a dry box\nfor long-term storage before the measurement. A shadow mask was used to define\na cell active area of 0.08 cm^2 for small cells. Modules were tested without a\nshadow mask. J-V measurements were carried out in the forward (increasing\nforward bias) and reverse (decreasing forward bias) scan directions over the\nvoltage range from \u22120.2 V to 1.2 V with 20 mV step for cells (~250 mV s^\u22121)\nand \u22120.2 V to 5 V with 200 mV step (~1 V s^\u22121) for modules, respectively. For\nautomatic J-V testing, a class AAA solar simulator (Enlitech SS-F5-3A) was\nused after calibration using the same reference cell. A secondary reference\ncell provided by Enlitech was also used to regularly check the light\nintensity. For the automatic testing, a circular aperture (1.8 mm diameter,\nThorlabs) was used to define the beam size of 0.025 cm^2 which was illuminated\non about 0.2 cm^2 cells defined by the coating width of carbon electrodes and\nthe TCE pattern. The small aperture was deliberately chosen to tolerate the\npositioning error of the roll-to-roll tester. The PeSCs fabricated in the\ncustom-built R2R coater were collected as a roll. The roll was then mounted on\nthe R2R tester by positioning it on the winder of the tester and then rewound\nto get the starting point of the coating experiment. It is critical to set the\nposition of the first cell under the aperture. A 2 cm gap in the TCE pattern\nwas used to recalibrate the first cell position of every 20 cm block of 40\nstripes by checking conductivity through the spring pins. The automatic\ntesting was typically performed in air, but the data in Fig. 4c\u2013g was obtained\nin a nitrogen-filled box. IPCE measurements were carried out using a\ncommercial IPCE setup (Peccel S20). XRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku\nSmartLab, equipped with a rotating anode CuK\u03b1 source (45 kV, 200 mA), and\nHypix 3000 detector. The SEM images of the films were taken with a Zeiss\nMerlin field emission SEM. A Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode-array\nspectrophotometer was used for optical density measurements. Time-resolved\nphotoluminescence measurements were performed using a time-correlated single-\nphoton counting (TCSPC) luminescence spectrometer (Edindburgh Instruments\nLtd., FLSP920) comprising a pulsed diode laser excitation source (466 nm, 100\nkHz, ~100 ps FWHM, ~0.2 nJ cm^\u22122 pulse^\u22121) and a Hamamatsu R928P\nphotomultiplier tube detector, giving an overall instrument response time of\n~0.7 ns (FWHM). Photoelectron Spectroscopy in Air (PESA) measurements were\nperformed using a Riken Kekei AC2 spectrometer.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe experimental data that support the findings of this study are available in\nFigshare with the identifier: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24502210.\n\n## References\n\n  1. https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html. accessed February 2024.\n\n  2.
