The movement is frequently\ndescribed as a psychedelic renaissance; Michael Pollan, author, journalist and\npsychedelics advocate, writes that \u2018There has never been a more exciting \u2013 or\nbewildering \u2013 time in the world of psychedelics.\u2019 Spanning numerous domains\nand branches of modern society \u2013 including medicine, psychotherapy,\npharmaceutical drug development, self-improvement and spiritual transformation\n\u2013 individuals and communities worldwide are evolving with psychedelics as the\nconduit.\n\nThe loudest declaration to date of the psychedelics comeback may have been the\nPsychedelic Science 2023 conference in Denver, Colorado, hosted by the\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) in June, attended\nby some 12,000 people. Conference-goers heard talks about psychedelics from a\ndiversity of perspectives, from Rick Doblin, the founder of MAPS and a\ndecades-long champion of psychedelics, to Rick Perry, who introduced himself\nas \u2018the dark, knuckle-dragging, Right-wing, Republican former governor of the\nstate of Texas\u2019.\n\nDespite unrestrained hype and valid criticisms of the psychedelic-assisted\npsychotherapy model (MAPS had to rectify fallout after revelations of sexual\nmisconduct by research therapists were publicised in 2021 and 2022),\npsychedelics are increasingly accepted and endorsed among both the populace\nand institutions. In 2021, 8 per cent of young adults in the US reported using\nhallucinogens in the past year, compared with just 3 per cent in 2011. Federal\ngovernments and industry, including venture capital firms, are investing\nbillions to research and develop psychedelic treatments and pharmaceuticals. A\nUS National Institutes of Health grant is currently supporting research into\npsilocybin treatments, for instance, while other governments have opened up\naccess to the drugs. In 2023, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Association\ngave psychiatrists approval to prescribe MDMA and psilocybin for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and depression, and a Special Access Program in\nCanada, though still heavily bureaucratic and mired in red tape, similarly\nopens a pathway to treat serious medical conditions with psychedelics.\n\nMeanwhile, another vibrant subculture based on microdosing \u2013 consuming small\namounts of psychedelic substances semi-regularly over a period of time \u2013 has\nemerged in the psychedelic landscape. The practice has been tantalising but\nfraught. Indeed, while studies supported by government and industry focus\nmainly on generating clinical trial evidence for standard doses to treat\nmental health problems, most research into microdosing falls on the lower end\nof the scientific rigour pyramid, often exploratory and observational in\nnature. In that sense, rather ironically, it resembles the experience of\npsychonauts taking full and heroic doses to seek enlightenment.\n\nOf course, microdosers are more interested in enhancing cognitive and\nintellectual performance or filling gaps in a hobbled mental healthcare\ninfrastructure than plumbing the depths of their psyches. Research surveys of\nadults who microdose regularly find that the most common motivations for\nmicrodosing relate to strengthening or mending the psyche \u2013 improving mood,\ndecreasing anxiety, or boosting focus and creativity. Some have compared its\nimpact with stimulants for ADHD or SSRIs for depression. Even US Marines are\nlooking to microdosing to increase productivity, creativity, problem-solving\nand flow.\n\nAre these positive cognitive and psychological benefits real? From a strictly\nevidence-based perspective, the science is young and undetermined. A sizeable\nslice of the microdosing scientific literature debates whether the impact\ncomes from the placebo effect, in which expectation influences outcome. But\nplacebo effect or not, qualitative accounts have been so positive and\npersuasive that scientists feel compelled to understand the practice further.\n\nMicrodosing in the psychedelic world has a meaning unto itself \u2013 and is a bit\ndifferent than the use of the term in pharmacology overall. A 2019 commentary\nin the Journal of Psychopharmacology summarised guidelines from a handful of\ndrug and medicine regulatory agencies, and reported that a microdose is \u20181 per\ncent of the pharmacologically active dose [of any drug], up to a maximum of\n100 \u03bcg [micrograms]\u2019. A microdose is a tiny dose of a pharmacological agent\nthat is likely not pharmacologically active, but is useful for studying\nsafety, side-effects and other properties of the substance.\n\nThe informal shared definition in psychedelic microdosing communities, on the\nother hand, is 5-10 per cent of a standard or \u2018trippy\u2019 dose of a psychedelic.\nGiven that many consider 2-5 grams of magic mushrooms or 100-200 micrograms of\nlysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) the dosing amounts to consume for a proper\npsychedelic trip, microdosing of these substances comes out to be about\n0.2-0.5 grams of magic mushrooms and 5-20 micrograms of LSD. (Note that most\ncontrolled research studies use psilocybin, the psychoactive molecule in magic\nmushrooms. Therefore, a standard dose of 25 milligrams of psilocybin equates\nto about 1-2 milligrams per microdose. However, pure psilocybin is not\ntypically accessible to the general public. Pretty much the only legal way to\nobtain psilocybin in the US is in highly regulated clinical research studies.\nTherefore, it is more practical to consider microdosing psilocybin in the\ncontext of magic mushrooms. And since the psilocybin potency of magic\nmushrooms can be highly variable, these dose calculations are no more than\nbroad estimates.)\n\nMany believe microdosing can yield benefits equal to a full-dose psychedelic\ntrip\n\nGiven all this, the commonly accepted phrase \u2018microdosing\u2019 when it comes to\npsychedelics is a bit of a misnomer; the actual amounts consumed are more\nanalogous to a \u2018low dose\u2019 or \u2018very low dose\u2019 of the psychedelic itself. Though\nthese semantic details may seem tedious, it is important to understand that\nmicrodosing is not simply a product of subcultures in psychedelia; it is a\nmethod of studying and understanding the effects of pharmacologically active\nsubstances overall.\n\nIt is also important to understand that much of what is discussed among the\ngeneral public and in online communities about microdosing is implicit and\ninferred, with standardised definitions, crucial for moving the enterprise\nforward, still to come. Semantics aside, microdosing psychedelics means merely\nconsuming very small amounts of the substance, usually 5-10 per cent of the\nstandard hallucinatory dose.\n\nThere\u2019s another way to look at microdosing psychedelics that may be a bit more\nhelpful. Microdosing refers to consuming very small amounts of psychedelics so\nthat psychoactive effects are sub-perceptual. The aim of microdosing is to\nobtain whatever psychological and neurological benefits the psychedelic may\nbestow, but at a level that is perceptually unnoticeable to the consumer. This\nflies in the face of what is widely understood to be why humans use\npsychedelics \u2013 to hallucinate, undergo a deeply psychologically transformative\nexperience, and expand consciousness. Psychonauts are wholly uninterested in\nanything sub-perceptual; rather, they seek to completely alter how they\nperceive the physical, mental and spiritual realms. Nonetheless, despite\nlimited controlled research evidence, many believe that microdosing can yield\nbenefits equal to what one may gain from a full-dose psychedelic trip.\n\nThis is especially true if the microdosing occurs on a regular schedule over a\nperiod of several weeks to several months. Somewhat like taking a traditional\nantidepressant, microdosing psychedelics requires adhering to a predetermined\ndosing regimen, and remaining persistent with it even if benefits are not\nimmediately noticeable. Microdosing psychedelics, however, does not occur\ndaily but once every couple of days, or perhaps once a week or even every\ncouple of weeks.\n\nThe reported effects of microdosing vary just as much as the reported effects\nof traditional consciousness-bending doses of psychedelics. Let\u2019s consider\nsome scientifically derived conclusions before delving into some of the more\nglowing anecdotal reports.\n\nA comprehensive systematic review of microdosing, published in 2022 in the\njournal Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, may be the best peer-reviewed\nempirical summary of the effects. The most striking finding from this review\nis that numerous studies have shown that psychedelic microdoses frequently\ncause mild noticeable perceptual effects, including perceptual distortions,\naltered mental states, somaesthesia, feelings of bliss, increased vigilance,\nand experiences of unity. These perceptual effects of course pale in\ncomparison with a full-blown psychedelic trip but diverge from the assumption\nthat microdoses are sub-perceptual. It may be that the customary 5-10 per cent\nof a standard dose is far more than what is necessary for an effective\nmicrodose, or, as the authors highlight, that mild alterations in perception\nmay indeed be a \u2018prerequisite for the beneficial effects of microdosing\u2019. This\nis a quandary of microdosing that will benefit from more experimental\nresearch.\n\nOther key findings of the review are summarised as follows:\n\n  * Microdosing is regularly associated with improvements in depression in uncontrolled observational studies, though a handful of controlled lab studies have shown no changes in depression after microdosing.\n  * The relationship between microdosing and anxiety is unclear \u2013 more studies have shown mixed or negative results on measures of anxiety than studies showing positive results.\n  * Several studies have shown improvements in areas such as wellbeing, self-fulfilment, self-efficacy, wisdom and physical health, though none of these studies were controlled laboratory experiments.\n  * Several studies have shown increases in creativity following ingestion of psychedelic microdoses. Other studies have shown mixed positive and negative effects of microdosing on other cognitive functions, including psychomotor vigilance, attention, mindfulness, ability to focus, and cognitive control.\n\nAnother systematic review of microdosing published in January 2024 looked at\nthe effects on mental health. The authors found favourable correlations\nbetween microdosing and several variables of psychological health including\nemotionality, mood and mental wellbeing. Several studies in this review also\nfound adverse associations such as increased anxiety and substance use. The\narticle\u2019s Table 4 adroitly depicts these mercurial findings across all studies\nreviewed. The more important finding from this study is probably the overall\nquality assessment of the research (see Table 3); each study received an\naverage quality score of 1 or less on a quality assessment scale ranging from\n0-2.\n\nThe sum of the research literature so far suggests microdosing may provide a\nuseful boost in some cognitive functions, a moderate reprieve from depression\nthough foiled by an increase in anxiety, and a mild enhancement of general\nwellbeing and daily functioning. And these benefits may just be marginal,\nalthough it\u2019s impossible to know for sure. The studies done so far look at\nsmall sample sizes of healthy, demographically homogeneous research\nparticipants, making it difficult to generalise the results, especially for\npeople diagnosed with longstanding mental disorders.\n\nNeither faction in the microdosing coterie can prove positive effects are more\nthan placebo\n\nYet reports of microdosing in the media and online are often glowing and\nremarkable. In Silicon Valley, workers have turned to microdosing to aid with\nintensive daily cognitive tasks as a healthier alternative to ADD medications\nsuch as Adderall, according to an article in Wired in 2016. In these circles,\nwhich are driven by productivity hacks and technical prowess, microdosing can\nalleviate a \u2018bevy of disorders, including depression, migraines and chronic-\nfatigue syndrome, while increasing outside-the-box thinking\u2019, according to a\nreport in Rolling Stone in 2015. (If that is true, we all should be\nmicrodosing!) Some claim that microdosing has helped them become better\nparents, and mothers are turning to microdosing to counter post-partum\ndepression. The toolkit for treating trauma-related cognitive impairment\nsuffered by combat veterans is increasingly incorporating psychedelics, and\nmicrodosing may become a component. A qualitative analysis of YouTube self-\nreports of microdosing experiences includes claims of solving Rubik\u2019s Cubes\nfaster and performing 20 per cent better in sales and marketing tasks. The\nauthor Ayelet Waldman states in the subtitle of one of her books that\nmicrodosing made a \u2018mega difference\u2019 in her mood, marriage and life. In a\nconference talk in 2018, Waldman said that, upon microdosing for the first\ntime, \u2018in that instant, I went from being suicidally depressed and unable to\nexperience joy, to looking out the window and finding myself exhilarated by\nbeauty.\u2019\n\nThe benefits of microdosing tallied in the peer-reviewed literature are\nsignificantly tamer than the anecdotal declarations, of course. Modern\nsocieties rely on science to sift through facts and falsities, but some of the\nmost profound human experiences cannot (at least for now) be directly measured\nwith empirical tools: narratives and personal accounts are a valuable source\nof understanding them. Microdosing has become inexorably lodged between these\ntwo paradigms, and we are still in the earliest of days.\n\nWhether you side with the middling empirical findings or the exuberant\nanecdotes of believers, neither faction in the microdosing coterie can prove\nits positive effects are anything more than placebo. Scientists haven\u2019t found\nan explanation for the reported effects, suggesting a placebo response. And\nanecdotal accounts must be qualified because many who claim benefits from\nmicrodosing may actually be taking small doses that produce some perceptual\nchanges, rather than true microdoses below the perceptual threshold.\n\nNonetheless, we live in a society where small advantages mean a lot \u2013 we\nmaintain a ceaseless drive for minuscule gains in work, hobbies and\nrelationships. The cultural milieu makes microdosing attractive, and the\nreality is that many have microdosed, and many more will do so as acceptance\nof psychedelics enters the mainstream. If you would like to try it yourself,\nwe suggest you proceed with an abundance of caution, using this Aeonic guide.\n\nGuidelines\n\nFor initiating a sensible microdosing programme, follow the steps below:\n\n1\\. Complete a physical and mental health assessment\n\nAs with any psychotropic substance taken as medication, recreationally or\notherwise, the benefits and risks to one\u2019s personal wellbeing should be\nevaluated and balanced appropriately. Though consumed at very low, presumably\nsub-perceptual doses, psychedelic microdoses are not without potential harms.\nSome scientists are warning of potential cardiovascular effects associated\nwith repeated consumption of the classic psychedelics, which affect\nneurotransmission pathways that involve serotonin. Other research has shown\nthat microdosing LSD may elevate anxiety. Until larger, more robust and\nrigorous experimental trials of microdosing are completed, it is nearly\nimpossible to determine how microdosing may influence any individual person.\n\nOne\u2019s personal experience during a psychedelic experience can be blissful and\nenlightening or terrifying and dark \u2013 the outcome is largely a factor of the\npsychonaut\u2019s a priori physical and psychological characteristics. That said,\nanyone considering microdosing should assess their physical and mental\nwellbeing before entering a microdosing cycle. If possible, completing a\ncheckup with a primary care physician can help you evaluate your physical\nhealth and uncover any risk factors that psychedelics may exacerbate.\nConsulting with a mental health professional can help you evaluate your\ntransient and persistent mental states and any cognitive, emotional and\nbehavioural risk factors susceptible to psychedelic microdosing. If medical\nand mental health services are not accessible to you, an online self-\nassessment tool can be helpful.\n\nThey are amusing and pleasant for some but may be shocking and scary for\nothers\n\nExpectedly, microdosers living in regions and territories where psychedelics\nare still illegal may choose to refrain from disclosing drug use to physicians\nand therapists. Consulting with clinical providers about specific healthcare\nquestions without disclosing microdosing intent or behaviour is a more\ndiscreet tactic. There are two major attributes of microdosing to consider\nwhen assessing for physiological and psychological risk factors:\nhallucinogenic effects and prolonged repeated exposure to psychedelics.\n\nHallucinogenic effects: psychedelics, especially high doses of the so-called\n\u2018classic psychedelics\u2019, can stimulate dramatic alterations to perception,\ncausing hallucinatory visions, voices, and other sensory distortions. They are\namusing and pleasant for some but may be shocking and scary for others. It\u2019s\nall a part of the trip, some would say, and a necessary feature of\nconsciousness-expansion. However, the hallucinatory effects of psychedelics\ncan provoke a more dangerous break from reality, such as psychosis or mania.\nConsequently, clinical trials of psychedelic therapies stringently screen out\nindividuals with personal or family histories of psychotic or manic-depressive\ndisorders. The adverse effect of even a single psychotic or manic episode\ntriggered by a psychedelic outweighs any potential gains.\n\nFortunately, a 2022 review article affirmed that \u2018no psychotic episodes have\nbeen documented in modern clinical trials\u2019, suggesting that the risk for such\nevents is low for those without psychotic or manic psychiatric\npredispositions, and when psychedelics are used in controlled, safe settings.\n\nProlonged and repeated exposure: the risk of mania and psychosis pertain to\nsingle, high-dose consumption of psychedelics. Studies and reviews of\nmicrodosing have not associated it with the onset of severe mental impairment.\nHowever, common sense suggests that repeated exposure to hallucinogens, even\nin low doses, poses some risk to psychological health. Indeed, in a 2020\nsystematic review, upwards of 10 per cent of microdosers self-report negative\nmental health side-effects such as insomnia, anxiety and worsening depression.\n\nPotential cardiovascular side-effects of microdosing are a growing concern in\nmedical discourse. Though clinical investigators are cognizant of\ncardiovascular effects of single, high-dose psychedelics (eg, increased heart\nrate and blood pressure), associated risks of significant, adverse events are\ngenerally low.\n\nSome, however, are not convinced the same can be said of microdosing\npsychedelics. Given the neurochemical mechanism whereby psychedelics mimic\nserotonin and trigger various receptors in the brain, the effect of repeated\ndosing is an important question.\n\nFurthermore, because serotonin can constrict blood vessels and increase blood\npressure, the effects of repeated dosing on the cardiovascular system require\nscrutiny and additional research, at the very least. Over the past few years,\nresearchers have theorised that chronic microdosers may be at risk of\ndeveloping valvular heart disease (VHD). Since psychedelics have a high\naffinity for 5-HT2B receptors, found in the peripheral and central nervous\nsystem, the theory goes, and since medications with similar neurotransmitter\nactivity have been linked to VHD, microdosing could be a culprit as well. A\n2023 article in the Journal of Psychopharmacology analysed in vitro, animal,\nand clinical studies evaluating the risk of psychedelic-induced VHD. Though\nthe analysis did not control for microdosing schedules, the authors concluded\nthat repeated exposure to full doses of MDMA could cause VHD (they did not\nfind such risk associated with four other psychedelics, but this was mostly\ndue to a lack of relevant research). Though microdosing is, obviously, done at\nlower doses and at non-daily schedules, caution is still warranted until more\nclinical and laboratory evidence is generated.\n\nTo summarise, a physical and mental health assessment in preparation for\nmicrodosing should, at the very least, consider risk for psychiatric and\ncardiovascular adverse events. As with most drugs, side-effects and problems\nare not limited to just two arenas. Other, less dramatic side-effects, from\nnausea to changes in body temperature to panic and more, are summarised in the\nJournal of Psychopharmacology; you should refer to the aforementioned 2022\narticle for a more comprehensive review of risk factors and adverse effects.\n\n2\\. Select a substance for microdosing\n\nThe most commonly microdosed psychedelics are LSD and magic mushrooms\n(psilocybin). A 2019 study that tracked the practices and experiences of\nmicrodosers over six weeks found that a little under half of participants\nmicrodosed either LSD or psilocybin; the aforementioned 2020 systematic review\nof 17 quantitative and qualitative studies reported that \u2018drugs most\nfrequently used in this research were LSD and psilocybin\u2019; the majority of\nplacebo-controlled, experimental studies of psychedelic microdoses have\nadministered either LSD or psilocybin to research participants. Many other\npsychedelics are microdosed, albeit much less commonly, including MDMA,\nmescaline, ketamine, ibogaine, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT).\n\nPrudence suggests that the safest and most effective options for microdosers\nare LSD or magic mushrooms. The safety profile and ubiquity of these\nsubstances imply that healthy individuals will fare best when microdosing\neither of these, as opposed to other psychedelic drugs. Furthermore,\nmicrodosers who select LSD or magic mushrooms can review dozens of research\narticles to explore how these substances may affect them, and connect with\nonline communities where most members are likely microdosing these substances\n\u2013 the aforementioned 2022 systematic review is a good place to start. The more\nthoroughly documented effects of standard doses of psychedelics in general are\nalso informative \u2013 the book Psyched (2022) by the journalist Amanda Siebert\ncovers seven different psychedelics in detail.\n\n3\\. Determine how much to microdose\n\nAfter choosing a psychedelic, you will want to determine how much of it to\nmicrodose. If you aspire for a truly sub-perceptual experience because you\u2019re\ninterested to see if microdosing can enhance your mental processes, then your\nmicrodoses should be less than the 5-10 per cent standard, perhaps 1-2 per\ncent. You can experiment and work your way up from there (of course, people\nwho are very sensitive to psychedelics may feel substantial perceptual effects\nat 1-2 per cent). If you want to mildly shift your mental states and\nexperiment with different levels of perception without going on a full-blown\ntrip, the 5-10 per cent standard is a good place to start. At 15-20 per cent,\nchances are you will be flirting with a light but very real psychedelic trip\nthat stimulates an elevation of consciousness. Previous experience with full\ndoses of psychedelics will be helpful for this step. Reflect on how much of a\npsychedelic was necessary for you to have a good trip, and go from there.\n\n4\\. Procuring your psychedelics\n\nRegarding legal access to psychedelics, these substances are entering the\nexceptionally grey regulatory area already inhabited by cannabis. In the US,\nat the federal level, most psychedelics are classified as Schedule I\nsubstances and considered to have \u2018no currently accepted medical use and high\npotential for abuse\u2019, meaning that possessing or procuring psychedelics is a\ncriminal offence. However, many states and municipalities have moved to\ndecriminalise some psychedelics.\n\nIn 2020, Oregon became the first state in the US to decriminalise possession\nof most drugs, including many psychedelics, and is establishing a system for\nresidents to receive psilocybin services. At the same time, it\u2019s worth noting\nthat microdosing was a contentious part of these reforms and remains legal\nonly under supervision, just like higher doses of psychedelics. Colorado\npassed a similar measure in 2022 to initiate a regulatory framework for\nresidents to procure and use psilocybin at licensed healing centres. Many\nother cities and towns across the US have passed measures to decriminalise\npsychedelics, most often those naturally occurring such as mushrooms and\ncacti, and develop systems to launch psychedelic-assisted mental health\nservices. A recent preprint underscores that none of these laws have\nspecifically addressed microdosing and, therefore, its legal status may be\nuncertain in any particular jurisdiction.\n\nThe vast majority of consumers of psychedelics are likely procuring them via\nunderground methods\n\nOutright buying psychedelics for recreational purposes is still prohibited in\nthe US and much of the world. Even in Portugal, where personal possession of\nall drugs has been decriminalised since 2001, the manufacturing and selling of\ndrugs remains illegal. All of this is to say that, by and large, procuring\npsychedelics is still an underground endeavour.\n\nI do not endorse any specific underground method for obtaining psychedelics\nfor microdosing. Ideally, they should be obtained legally and used in\naccordance with federal and local laws. That said, the reality is that more\nand more people are using psychedelics for microdosing or otherwise, and the\nvast majority of consumers of psychedelics are likely procuring them via\nunderground methods. Readers should use reasonable and sensible judgment in\ntheir attempts to acquire psychedelics, and rely on their personal network and\nknown connections to source them rather than on social media or shadowy\ndelivery services. (If psychedelic mushrooms are decriminalised in your city\nor state, you may consider growing them yourself.)\n\n5\\. Testing your psychedelics\n\nMicrodosers should opt to test their psychedelics before consuming them as\nthey would any other drug, at least any substances sold in powder, pill or\nliquid form. (A 2020 survey in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that\nmost microdosers do not test the substances they use.) Unfortunately,\nrecreational drugs such as cocaine and MDMA are regularly laced with\nadulterants such as fentanyl and xylazine, and these laced drugs are\ncontributing to an intensifying overdose crisis in the US.\n\nFungi and plants (eg, cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms) are not likely to be\ncontaminated with fentanyl. However, powder, pills and liquids can be laced\nwith a potentially fatal adulterant. Ensuring the safety of your drugs can be\ntricky given the various levels of drug-testing measures. Fentanyl test strips\nare relatively easy to access and use, and are a quick-and-dirty way to detect\nfentanyl in street drugs, but they cannot measure the potency of the fentanyl\nor confirm that the drug you have acquired is actually what it was advertised\nas.\n\nDrug-specific testing is an option as well, but is more expensive than\nfentanyl test strips which are often freely available in the US. Dancesafe.org\nsells testing kits to detect specific drugs such as MDMA and LSD, though these\nkits range from $20 to $120. DrugsData, an independent drug-testing laboratory\nbased in Sacramento, California \u2018tests all psychoactive drugs including\necstasy tablets, powders, research chemicals, novel psychoactive substances,\nand other drugs through [their] DEA-licensed laboratory\u2019. This drug-testing\noption is likely the most comprehensive and accurate available to recreational\ndrug users, but there are some noteworthy caveats. You will have to mail the\ndrugs to the lab, and for $100-$150 DrugsData will test the drugs and post\nresults publicly on their website 3-4 weeks later.\n\n6\\. Storing your psychedelics\n\nStoring psychedelics during microdosing is crucial given that these substances\nwill be used over a period of several weeks or months. Psychedelics are\nsusceptible to degrading and loosing potency if stored in unfavourable\nconditions. The two most commonly microdosed psychedelics \u2013 LSD and magic\nmushrooms \u2013 are best stored in airtight containers and placed in a cool, dry\nand dark environment. For long-term storage, keep LSD in the fridge or\nfreezer.\n\n7\\. Design a microdosing protocol\n\nThe dosing schedule is crucial. The aforementioned 2020 survey in the Journal\nof Psychopharmacology reported results from a study of microdosing practices\nfrom 414 microdosers. The authors found that just over a third of respondents\nused a one-day-on, two-days-off microdosing protocol, and about one-fifth of\nrespondents used a one-day-on, three-days-off protocol. In other words, most\nmicrodosers consume their preferred psychedelic one day and refrain for 2-3\ndays before microdosing again. Some respondents also reported using a once-a-\nweek or once-every-two-or-more-weeks microdosing schedule. A 2019 survey of\nmore than 1,000 respondents found that almost half of them designed their own\nmicrodosing protocol.\n\nMany practitioners follow schedules invented by some key thought leaders in\npsychedelia. The most popular is the Fadiman protocol, initially proposed by\nthe psychologist James Fadiman in his book The Psychedelic Explorer\u2019s Guide:\nSafe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys (2011), and further specified in a 2019\narticle in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The Fadiman protocol is one day\nof microdosing followed by two days off. In the 2019 article, the authors\nstated that this protocol was informed by anecdotal reports suggesting that\nthe effects of microdosing last two days. Another popular microdosing protocol\nis the so-called \u2018Stamets stack\u2019. The renowned mycologist Paul Stamets advises\ncombining microdoses of dried psychedelic mushrooms with Lion\u2019s Mane, another\nmushroom purported to enhance cognitive function, and Vitamin B3 on a dosing\nschedule of 4-5 days on and 2-3 days off. This cycle is repeated for 4-6\nweeks, followed by a break of 2-6 weeks. These schedules are popular, but have\nnot been tested in any systematic way against others.\n\nAt least a month of microdosing may be necessary to obtain any potential\nbenefits\n\nMicrodosers should tailor their protocol to best fit their needs and desired\noutcomes, though this can be difficult to gauge the first time someone embarks\non a microdosing cycle. Some may consider using microdoses for specific\npersonal and professional activities, such as deep cognitive work or social\nengagements. Such protocols may not adhere to a fixed dosing schedule but may\nprovide a psychedelic boost in preferred settings and situations. Despite\nlimited consensus on the best microdosing protocol, dosing every day should be\navoided. Psychedelic microdosing is not without risks and any negative side\neffects are more likely to occur when a substance is consumed daily.\n\nIn his guide, Fadiman counsels to go slow:\n\n> By going slow, you give yourself a chance to really know, to really observe\n> what is different, why it\u2019s different, and how you can best take advantage\n> of it. The day you\u2019re completely off is great as a reset day, kind of like\n> clearing the mind/body palate. Then you\u2019re fresh and ready to undertake the\n> experiment again.\n\nLittle has been written about the ideal length of a complete microdosing\ncycle. In Fadiman\u2019s 2019 article, he and his co-author collected self-reports\nof experiences with microdosing from research participants after one month of\nmicrodosing using the Fadiman protocol. The one-month cycle was chosen for\nresearch purposes, however, and lengthier schedules (from 2-4 months) are very\ncommon. Unless you experience serious negative side-effects after the first\nfew microdoses, at least a month of microdosing may be necessary to obtain any\npotential benefits. Going on for too long, though, isn\u2019t recommended. Even if\nyou experience significant positive effects, microdosing consistently for six\nmonths to a year or more is not advisable due to cardiovascular risk.\n\nThe best approach to a microdosing protocol is consistent with any\nrecreational drug use \u2013 proceed with caution.\n\n8\\. Carefully measure and divide microdoses\n\nPrecision goes a long way when using drugs recreationally. Along with\nadulterated black-market substances, a great deal of drug harm stems from\nusers miscalculating how much they are actually consuming. In his book Drug\nUse for Grown-Ups (2021), the neuroscientist Carl Hart provides readers with\nfour \u2018important lessons to facilitate their health and happiness\u2019 when using\ndrugs recreationally, the first of which is dose; the other three are route of\nadministration, set, and setting. Hart writes that the dose, the amount of the\ndrug consumed, \u2018is perhaps the most crucial factor in determining the effects\nproduced by the drug\u2019. The most delightful psychedelic experience can quickly\nbecome harrowing if too much of the drug is consumed. It is imperative to be\nas accurate as possible when measuring individual microdoses.\n\nPsychedelic plants and fungi can be measured with milligram scales. Generally\nspeaking, a microdose is considered one-10th to one-20th of a standard\npsychedelic dose. Things are trickier with psychedelics like LSD, a liquid\ntypically sold as tiny squares of blotting paper. It is basically impossible\nto ascertain the potency of an LSD blotter without hi-tech drug-testing\nhardware. One blotter is commonly understood to be one recreational dose of\nLSD, about 100 micrograms. One method for dividing LSD blotters is to cut a\nsquare into nine equal microdoses, though this is slightly greater than the\none-10th to one-20th standard. Those new to microdosing may consider cutting\nsmaller squares given how potent LSD is, though it may be difficult to cut the\nmicrodoses into equal portions.\n\nFinally, dividing each microdose and storing them properly before starting the\ncycle is prudent for a safe and effective microdosing adventure.\n\n9\\. Day 1 microdosing and beyond: track microdoses and effects in a journal or\nspreadsheet\n\nThe first day of microdosing is exceptionally important, especially if you\nhave never previously used a psychedelic, microdosing or otherwise. Though LSD\nand magic mushrooms are considered relatively safe recreational substances,\nthere is always a chance you may experience a bad reaction, as is true with\nany recreational or medicinal drug. On day 1, jotting notes or journaling\nabout how you respond to the microdose is a good way to keep track of any bad\nreactions. Be sure to track good reactions as well. The goal is to just be\nmindful of how you respond to the psychedelic, and ensure it is something you\ncan manage on a regular basis.\n\nYou may consider journaling and tracking other data points regularly\nthroughout a microdosing cycle. Given the varied nature of how any individual\nperson on any given day may experience psychedelics, monitoring your day-to-\nday experience may help you decode hype from reality. As I detailed earlier,\nthe anecdotal reports of microdosing soar far higher than the scientific\nevidence. Reports of phenomenal outcomes due to microdosing should not be\ndismissed, but any positive effects you experience are likely to be less\ndramatic. You can use tools like daily journaling, or psychometric measures of\ndepression, anxiety, flow, and wellbeing to gain clarity about your\nexperiences with microdosing. You may consider N-of-1 citizen science, a\nmethod based on a study population of one, currently gaining ground in\nmicrodosing research, as a model for collecting and interpreting data about\nyourself. Again, the goal is to use more than personal intuition to delineate\nhow microdosing affects your mind, body and wellbeing.\n\nIt would be irresponsible to conclude this piece without the cautionary note\nthat microdosing suffers from a thorny quandary: it is clear that it is\ninfluenced by prior expectations, so we can\u2019t be sure how much of the effects\nare due to this or to inherent properties of the drugs. This is a complex\npredicament for psychotropic substances, including antidepressants, across the\nboard.\n\nIn popular culture, microdosing has been associated with transformative\npsychological and spiritual experiences. When captivating and sparkling\nanecdotes are propagated in the media, many people considering microdosing may\ninevitably surmise that it will also be transformative for them. Hype\nsurrounding microdosing and psychedelics in general has cultivated an air of\nexceptional optimism and enthralment about their capabilities. The reality is\nthat microdosing is susceptible to expectancy effects, possibly more so than\nother psychotropics. In fact, a 2021 study found no significant difference\nbetween a microdosing group and a placebo group on multiple psychological\noutcomes. There is a growing body of academic literature and lay media\ndiscussing the relevance of expectancy and placebo effects in microdosing, and\nit is worth reviewing it before starting a microdosing cycle.\n\nNone of this means that microdosing should be written off \u2013 placebo-controlled\nstudies do show that microdosing has positive (and sometimes negative) effects\non mood, cognition and wellbeing. And psychedelics across the board are\ninherently difficult to investigate because they affect fundamental features\nof consciousness, rendering one\u2019s response to them subject to the many\nvicissitudes of life itself. This is not acceptable to scientists \u2013 scientists\nlike to explain how and why things happen, and in fine detail. They like to\nquantify variables and generate equations. Psychedelic experiences do not lend\nthemselves to such precise explanations.\n\nPsychedelic experiences are esoteric phenomena that humanity grapples with\nmercurially\n\nCompounding the complexity is the fact that establishing causal effects is\ndifficult in microdosing research due to inadequate blinding methods. Indeed,\nthe most consistent finding across the existing microdosing literature is that\nthe effects of microdoses are often subjectively noticeable, in other words,\nmicrodosers can reliably tell they are \u2018under the influence\u2019. (Some would\nargue that these slight alterations in consciousness are necessary for\nmicrodosing to work.) Nonetheless, blinding is a bedrock of establishing\ncausality in clinical trial and experimental research \u2013 scientists cannot say\nmicrodosing is superior to placebo if participants can reliably guess whether\nthey have been given the actual drug or not. In a recent review of placebo-\ncontrolled microdosing studies, a duo of Australian researchers contend that\n\u2018it is likely that a substantial proportion of participants in these studies\nwere able to identify whether they had taken a microdose.\u2019\n\nI believe that microdosing can have positive effects on cognition, mental\nhealth and happiness, and can be extremely useful for many when used\ncorrectly. I am also convinced that controlled microdosing research will\nlikely continue to produce middling results, as has been the case so far.\nPsychedelic experiences are esoteric phenomena that humanity grapples with\nmercurially, as an individual does with complicated emotions like fear and\nlove. Neither multitudes of subjective anecdotes nor scientific instruments\ncan capture the multidimensional value of psychedelics in society. Historical\nevidence is more compelling in my view and, historically, psychedelics are\ndeeply intertwined with some of the most ethereal elements of humanity \u2013\nrituals, healing, culture and consciousness. Psychedelics seem to vary and\nrespond in accordance with the society and era in which they exist.\n\nThe question is: what is the role of microdosing in the context of today? I\nobviously do not have the answer. However, microdosing appears to agreeably\nintegrate psychedelics with 21st-century society. In the modern era, genetic\nengineering, brain-computer interfaces and digital biomarkers are possible in\nhumans. Those of us using digital and software technologies for daily work are\nalready augmenting our productivity and our brains. And the need to gain an\nedge has become more relentless than ever before. The microdosing ethos aligns\nperfectly with these sentiments \u2013 just a little more biohacking to drive\nresults.\n\nThere may be a simpler interpretation. Psychedelics are mainstream and widely\naccepted in the 21st century, possibly more so than at any other time in the\nhistory of Western societies. But at the same time, it\u2019s not practical to\nenter the altered state of the high-dose psychedelic experience in any routine\nway. Microdosing may be that accessible and modest psychedelic nudge we might\nall need in modern society to expand our collective consciousness and see the\nworld in new and creative ways.\n\nConsciousness and altered statesWellbeingTechnology and the self\n\n5 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nPsychiatry and psychotherapy\n\nThe therapist who hated me\n\nGoing to a child psychoanalyst four times a week for three years was bad\nenough.
