They simply have forcefully criticized dominant narratives around the\nwar.\n\nSachs is a highly respected international development expert who has angered\nUkrainian officials over his repeated calls for a diplomatic solution to the\ncurrent military conflict. Last November, he gave a speech at the United\nNations calling for a negotiated peace.\n\nMearsheimer has written extensively on international relations and is a\nskeptic of NATO expansion. He predicted that Western efforts to militarize\nUkraine would lead to a Russian invasion.\n\nGreenwald is a Pulitzer Prize-winning independent journalist who has\ncriticized not just war coverage but media dynamics that suppress voices that\nrun counter to U.S. narratives. \u201cWhat they mean when they demand censorship of\n\u2018pro-Russia propaganda\u2019 is anything that questions the US/EU role in the\nUkraine war or who dissents from their narratives,\u201d Greenwald has observed.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence of Kremlin influence over their viewpoints, but their\ncomments alone are enough for a network of U.S.-backed Ukrainian media groups\nto tarnish these experts as Russian propagandists.\n\nU.S. taxpayer dollars are flowing to outlets such as the New Voice of Ukraine,\nVoxUkraine, Detector Media, the Institute of Mass Information, the Public\nBroadcasting Company of Ukraine and many others. Some of this money has come\nfrom the $44.1 billion in civilian-needs foreign aid committed to Ukraine.\nWhile the funding is officially billed as an ambitious program to develop\nhigh-quality independent news programs; counter malign Russian influence; and\nmodernize Ukraine\u2019s archaic media laws, the new sites in many cases have\npromoted aggressive messages that stray from traditional journalistic\npractices to promote the Ukrainian government\u2019s official positions and\ndelegitimize its critics.\n\nVoxUkraine has released highly produced videos attacking the credibility of\nAmerican opposition voices, including Sachs, Mearsheimer, and Greenwald.\nDetector Media, one of the most influential media watchdog groups, similarly\nproduces a flow of social media and posts branding American critics of the war\nas part of a Russian disinformation operation. The outlets are also devoted to\ndomestic disputes. Detector Media\u2019s broadcasts have lampooned critics of\nUkrainian government moves to shut down opposition media outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s not only dissident voices targeted by the USAID-funded groups.\n\nDetector Media went after the New York Times in February over a news report\nabout hundreds of Ukrainians in the battle for Avdiivka who were captured or\nmissing. The Ukrainian fact-check site offered little in terms of a rebuttal.\nDetector Media only cited a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Defense Forces\ndisputing the Times' story, which it labeled \"disinformation.\" The New Voice\nof Ukraine quoted a Ukrainian official describing the Times story as a\n\u201cRussian Psyop,\u201d a term for psychological warfare.\n\nUnlike similar media development programs that the International Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID) has led throughout the Middle East,\nUkrainian outlets tend to produce a great deal of English content that\ntrickles back into the domestic American audience and explicitly targets\nAmerican foreign policy discourse.\n\nThe New Voice of Ukraine syndicates with Yahoo News. VoxUkraine is a fact-\nchecking partner with Meta, which assists in removing content deemed \u201cRussian\ndisinformation\u201d from Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Detector Media has\nsimilarly led a consortium of nonprofit groups pressuring social media\nplatforms to aggressively remove content critical of Ukraine.\n\n##### Above: VoxUkraine, a USAID-funded group, produced videos and attacks\nsmearing Americans such as economist Jeffrey Sachs as an agent of Kremlin\npropaganda. Sachs is a proponent of resolving the Ukraine-Russia war through\ndiplomacy.\n\n\"It makes more sense to have it in English because one of the things that\nhappens is that the narrative that one encounters in the mainstream media in\nthe West is referenced as the official Ukrainian voices,\" said Nicolai N.\nPetro, a professor specializing in Russian and Ukrainian affairs at the\nUniversity of Rhode Island.\n\n\"These then become the known Ukrainian voices, although they're actually only\nan echo of the voice that we are projecting into Ukraine,\u201d Petro added.\n\nCongress is now weighing a new supplemental funding measure, with\napproximately $60 billion earmarked for the war in Ukraine. A small portion of\nthe emergency spending package is devoted to continued USAID programs in the\ncountry.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky, in an interview this week with Politico, argued\nthat legislators were skeptical of the aid package and were under the\ninfluence of Russian propaganda.\n\n\u201cThey have their lobbies everywhere: in the United States, in the EU\ncountries, in Britain, in Latin America, in Africa,\u201d Zelenskyy said of Russian\ninfluence, without naming names. \u201cWhen we talk about the Congress \u2014 do you\nnotice how they work with society in the United States?\u201d\n\nThe pro-Russian pressure groups, the Ukrainian president added, relied on\n\"certain media groups, citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nInformation control is a central dynamic playing out in the Ukraine-Russia\nwar. U.S. media have provided wide coverage of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s\nefforts to clamp down on critical news outlets, enacting new criminal\npenalties for those publishing \"false information\" about the conflict. Many\nindependent outlets in Russia have been forced to close, including the left-\nleaning radio station Ekho Moskvy. The Russian government has also blocked\nRussian-language news sites based in the West and arrested at least 22\njournalists, including the Wall Street Journal's Evan Gershkovich.\n\nBut far less attention has been paid to the Ukraine government\u2019s crackdown on\nindependent and opposition media, a push aided by the U.S.-backed network of\nanti-disinformation groups. Even as Washington\u2019s efforts to censor information\nat home is drawing greater scrutiny, its support of Ukraine\u2019s efforts reflects\nthe increasingly global reach of the American government\u2019s propaganda arms.\n\n\"There's an information war going on between Russia and Ukraine, and the\nUnited States is not a disinterested party \u2013 we're an active participant,\u201d\nsaid George Beebe, a director with the Quincy Institute for Responsible\nStatecraft. \"The U.S. government has been trying to shape perceptions, and\nit's very difficult to separate what's intended for foreign audiences from\nwhat seeps into the Anglosphere media, if you want to call it that, including\nhere in the United States.\u201d\n\nAmerican influence in Ukraine\u2019s media environment stretches back to the end of\nthe Cold War, though it has intensified in recent years. Since the outbreak of\nthe war, USAID support has extended to 175 national Ukrainian media entities.\n\nOver the last decade, efforts to crack down on speech have been increasingly\njustified as an effort to protect social media from disinformation. The U.S.\nhelped set up new think tanks and media watchdogs and brought over\ncommunications specialists to guide Ukraine\u2019s approach. Nina Jankowicz, the\npolarizing official whom President Biden appointed to lead the Department of\nHomeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board to police social media\ncontent, previously advised the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on its anti-\ndisinformation work.\n\nIn response to questions about the U.S.-backed anti-disinformation groups in\nUkraine targeting Americans, the U.S. State Department provided a statement\nsaying it defines disinformation as \u201cas false or misleading information that\nis deliberately created or spread with the intent to deceive or mislead.\u201d It\nadded, \u201cWe accept there may be other interpretations or definitions and do not\ncensor or coerce independent organizations into adopting our definition.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the U.S. \u201cprovides funding to credible independent media\norganizations to strengthen democracies in the countries we work in around the\nworld,\u201d the statement declared, \u201cWe do not control the editorial content of\nthese organizations.\u201d\n\nHowever, disclosures indicate that the U.S. government and its contractors\ntasked with reforming Ukraine\u2019s institutions have directly set the agenda for\nUkrainian outlets. Immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago, the\nUSAID dispensed emergency grants to its media partners, partly through the\nZinc Network, a contractor based in London that has been accused of setting up\ncovert public relations campaigns on behalf of the British government.\n\nThe grant description notes that the money went to the Zinc Network and\nDetector Media to assist the Ukrainian government with strategic\ncommunications and to \"undermine Kremlin information operations.\u201d Far from\nindependent reporting, the grant instructions asked the recipients to provide\n\"quick, effective PR and media engagement.\" In addition to countering Russian\ndisinformation, the money was intended to \u201cmaintain public morale\u201d and\n\"bolster international support for solidarity with Ukraine.\"\n\n##### Above: Zinc Network\u2019s Open Information Partnership coordinates the\nactivities of anti-disinformation watchdogs funded by NATO countries,\nparticularly the U.S. and U.K.\n\nLast September, journalist Jack Poulson reported on a leaked report from the\nZinc Network\u2019s Open Information Partnership, which helps coordinate the\nactivities of several anti-Russian disinformation nonprofits around Europe\nbacked by NATO members, including Detector Media.\n\nThe lengthy report defines disinformation as not only false or misleading\ncontent but also \"verifiable information which is unbalanced or skewed,\namplifies, or exaggerates certain elements for effect, or uses emotive or\ninflammatory language to achieve effects which fit within existing Kremlin\nnarratives, aims, or activities.\"\n\nIn other words, factual information with emotional language that simply\noverlaps with anything remotely connected to Russian viewpoints is considered\ndisinformation, according to this U.S.-backed consulting firm helping to guide\nthe efforts of Ukrainian think tanks and media.\n\nMany of the broad narratives the report identified as Russian disinformation\nfollow this vague rubric. These included allegations that NATO is using\nUkraine as a pawn in a proxy war against Russia and concerns that Ukrainian\npoliticians are corrupt.\n\nThe report goes on to blame many British and American experts who \u201cportray the\nWest as being divided, corrupt, or nefarious\u201d as part of the Russian\ndisinformation system. The document names liberal journalists Max Blumenthal\nand Newsweek\u2019s Ellie Cook, as well as Republican figures such as former\npresidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs, as\nvoices that end up featured in Russian propaganda and disinformation.\n\nThe Open Information Partnership report suggests new legislation to counter\n\"malign foreign actors\" and for European intelligence agencies to \"do more\"\nand provide a \"unified approach\" against the dangers of disinformation. Zinc\nNetwork did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUkraine\u2019s government has also worked with U.S. government officials and others\nto censor its American critics. One prominent example is Aaron Mat\u0117, an\nindependent journalist who has criticized U.S. policy regarding Ukraine in\nother outlets. Following the Russian invasion, Twitter, under its old\nownership, flagged Mat\u0117 to be censored after the Security Service of Ukraine\n(SBU), the Ukrainian intelligence agency, included him on a list of accounts\nsent to the FBI that were \"suspected by the SBU in spreading fear and\ndisinformation.\u201d\n\nJust months after the social media request, Ross Burley, a former Zinc Network\nand Open Information Partnership official now with the Centre for Information\nResilience, spoke openly about his desire to censor critics of the war,\nincluding Mat\u0117. Burley, who \"designed, implemented, and led several of the UK\nGovernment\u2019s counter disinformation programmes,\" according to a now-deleted\nprofile, discussed the rise of independent media critical of the Ukrainian\ngovernment and Western support for a war that has devastated that country. He\ndiscussed the conflict at the Opinion Festival in Tallinn, Estonia, in August\n2022.\n\nBurley argued that social media platforms needed more \u201cresponsibility\u201d\nregarding what types of content to allow. \"Even I saw Russell Brand, who has a\nhuge following on YouTube, was interviewing a journalist called Aaron Mat\u0117 on\nhis channel,\" said Burley, who added that it is \"incredibly irresponsible for\nYouTube and other social media companies to continue to host these people.\u201d\n\n##### Above: The National Endowment for Democracy touts pro-NATO political\nupheaval in Ukraine and credits its long-term investments in local media and\njournalism.\n\nThe organizations supported by the U.S. government have also sought to silence\ncritics inside Ukraine. Before the war, in one of President Zelensky\u2019s first\ncontroversial acts to stifle political opposition, he moved in February 2021\nto close television channels 112, NewsOne, and ZIK \u2013 stations owned by Viktor\nMedvedchuk and his associate Taras Kozak, former lawmakers with the Opposition\nParty of Life, a bloc opposed to Zelensky \u2013 over allegations of Kremlin ties.\n\n\"The sanctions against TV channels of Mr. Medvedchuk are not about media and\nfreedom of speech at all,\" said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky's\nchief of staff. \"This is only about effective countermeasures against fakes\nand foreign propaganda.\"\n\nLater that year, in December 2021, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights released a statement that criticized the Ukrainian crackdown\non journalists and peaceful expression. The report cited the closure of\nopposition television channels and other media.\n\nThe USAID-funded Ukrainian media network, however, was quick to defend the\nZelensky government. The decision to close the outlets, wrote Detector Media,\nwas \"not an attack on freedom of speech\" because the channels, the group\nargued, provided \"informational support of Russian aggression against\nUkraine.\"\n\nIn May 2022, the Zelensky government widely expanded its efforts to outlaw the\npolitical opposition. Zelensky moved to ban 11 political parties over alleged\nties to Russia. The largest of which was Medvedchuk\u2019s Opposition Party of\nLife, which previously held 44 seats in the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian\nparliament.\n\nLater that summer, other bills to crack down on media rights that had failed\nto pass in the past over civil liberty concerns were brought back into\nconsideration. Mykyta Poturayev, a Ukrainian legislator and close ally of\nZelensky, re-introduced the On Media Law.\n\nThe legislation features provisions to penalize hate speech and\ndisinformation, as well as broad powers to limit certain forms of foreign\ninfluence. Among its most contentious provisions is the power granting a\ncouncil controlled by Zelensky and his allies to ban media outlets without a\ncourt order.\n\nBefore Zelensky signed the bill in December 2022, many journalists spoke out\nagainst the legislation. The European Federation of Journalists and the\nCommittee to Protect Journalists denounced it as an extreme violation of\njournalistic freedom. Ukraine's National Union of Journalists described the\nbill as the \"biggest threat to free speech in independent [Ukraine's]\nhistory.\"\n\nAgain, the USAID-funded media groups provided pivotal support amid a\ntightening on journalistic freedom. The push to support the bill was largely\nled by U.S.-government-backed think tanks and media outlets. As the Ukrainian\nlegislature moved forward, Detector Media reported a new statement from select\njournalists and nonprofits who supported the controversial legislation. The\nstatement argued that the Zelensky-appointed council overseeing media was an\n\u201cindependent regulator\u201d and urged the adoption of the law as a tool to\ncounteract foreign aggression.\n\nThe statement was organized by Ukraine's Center for Democracy and Rule of Law.\nIn 2022, the group received 76.67% of its budget from USAID, USAID\u2019s\ncontractors, and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a U.S.\ngovernment-funded nonprofit that was spun out of the Central Intelligence\nAgency in the 1980s.\n\nThe other signatories of the statement included the Laboratory of Digital\nSecurity and Human Rights Platform \u2013 both funded by USAID and Internews, a\nCalifornia-based USAID contractor that manages much of the agency\u2019s Ukraine\nmedia work. Internews Ukraine, the company\u2019s in-house Ukraine media outlet,\nalso signed the statement supporting the On Media Law.\n\nInternews is a significant pillar of USAID's $35 million Ukraine media\nprogram. Other European governments and private sector donors, led by\nbillionaires Pierre Omidyar via the Omidyar Network and George Soros via the\nInternational Renaissance Foundation, have financed the network of media and\nactivists working with the USAID groups.\n\nDisclosures suggest other supplemental funding has been rushed to local\nUkrainian media. In 2021, before Russia's invasion, Detector Media received\n35.1% of its nearly $1 million budget from Internews. New data released by the\nfederal government shows that USAID provided a $2.5 million direct grant to\nDetector Media last year.\n\nIn a report titled \"Long-Term Investments Pay Dividends in Ukraine,\" NED noted\nthat U.S.-backed groups have been pivotal in reshaping the country's law. It\npointed to a coalition of nonprofits led by the Coalition Reanimation Package\nof Reforms, a USAID-backed group that mobilized civil society to lobby for\nlegal and legislative changes. The group was pivotal in the push for the On\nMedia Law. The group hailed the law's passage, calling it one of the major\nachievements of reforms passed during the war.\n\nAfter the legislation was passed, Detector Media attacked \u201cPro-Russian\nTelegram channels\u201d for spreading \u201cfakes and manipulations\u201d about the law. One\nfact-check published by the group claimed that the law \u201chad to be adopted in\nthe context of Ukraine\u2019s European integration.\u201d The post countered claims that\nthe law introduces authoritarian forms of censorship by pointing to the fact\nthat \u201cmedia professionals and members of the public were involved in its\ndevelopment.\u201d\n\nNED, the former CIA arm, has publicly touted the effort to pass the On Media\nLaw for its work in reshaping Ukraine\u2019s media landscape. In a report written\nin collaboration with Detector Media, the group discusses the law with respect\nto bolstering efforts to \u201crid the Ukrainian information space of harmful\nRussian propaganda.\u201d The report noted some journalistic criticism of the\nproposal, concluded that it was \"supported by the majority of media related\ncivil society organizations and international donors for its expansion of\ndemocratic accountability in the information space.\"\n\nUnmentioned in NED and Detector Media\u2019s claims of widespread media support for\nthe law is its own central role and that of other USAID-backed groups.\n\n##### Above: Samantha Power, the administrator of USAID, was interviewed on\nJuly 20, 2023, by the Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine, also known as\nSuspilne, Ukrainian for \u201cPublic.\u201d Suspilne has received significant funding\nfrom USAID over the last decade.\n\nIn the midst of the first months of the Russian invasion, many in Ukraine\nreadily accepted the need for emergency government influence. The Ukrainian\ngovernment condensed the major television channels into a single \u201cUnited News\u201d\nnational broadcast that continues today. Many journalists voluntarily paused\ncritical reporting of the Ukrainian government to focus on coverage of the\nRussian invasion.\n\nNow, over two years into the conflict, reporters are facing new difficulties\nin reporting on routine issues. Journalists taking a critical look at the\ngovernment are facing intimidation and threats.\n\nThe Columbia Journalism Review has chronicled the precarious situation\nindependent journalists face in today's Ukraine. In January, a pair of thugs\nwent to the home of Yuriy Nikolov, a prominent investigative journalist who\nhas uncovered scandals involving military catering contracts. The men tried to\nbreak down Nikolov's door, and according to his mother, who was home, called\nhim a \"provocateur\" and a \"traitor.\"\n\nThat same month, an anonymous video released videos from hidden cameras\nshowing journalists with Bihus.Info \u2013 a local media outlet that has\nextensively reported on Ukrainian government corruption \u2013 using illegal drugs\nin private. Denys Bihus, the head of the site, has reported on Ukraine's\nintelligence service's involvement in the surveillance and intimidation of his\nmedia outlet.\n\nAnatoly Shariy, a controversial Ukrainian blogger living in exile over\nrepeated death threats, has clashed repeatedly with USAID's network of media\noutlets. Shariy is known for his blistering criticism of the 2014 Maidan\nRevolution that toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and set\nUkraine on a path to alignment with NATO. The SBU, the Ukrainian intelligence\nagency, has accused him of \"high treason\" over alleged ethnic slurs targeted\ntowards the people of the western region of Ukraine.\n\nIn July 2023, the agency added new charges, claiming Shariy distributed staged\nvideos of Ukrainian prisoners under detention by Russian forces. The SBU has\nattempted to extradite Shariy, who has moved from the Netherlands to Spain and\nreportedly to Italy for asylum.\n\nOnline reporting in English, though, is dominated by USAID media outlets. A\nsearch for Shariy\u2019s name returns half a dozen articles by VoxUkraine, Detector\nMedia, the Institute of Mass Information, and the New Voice of Ukraine. The\narticles trash Shariy as a pro-Russian propagandist and criminal, guilty of a\nvariety of speech-related crimes.\n\n\u201cIn his Telegram posts, Shariy tries to emphasize that Russia is more united\nand stronger than Ukraine,\u201d Detector Media claimed. \u201cHe rejects the severing\nof any ties between Ukraine and Russia. Even in the face of proven Russian\nlies and evidence of their crimes, Shariy continues to promote narratives\nfavorable to Russia and disseminate disinformation.\u201d\n\nThe Detector Media article provides little substance in terms of any illegal\nactions beyond Shariy\u2019s viewpoints. But expressing viewpoints that run counter\nto Ukraine and NATO policies with respect to the war is enough to make an\nindividual an enemy of the state.\n\nHeader Photo: Brigadier-General Oleksii Hromov, Deputy Chief of the Main\nOperational Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\nspeaks during a press conference of representatives of the Security and\nDefense Forces of Ukraine at the Military Media Center in Kyiv, Ukraine, on\nApril 13, 2023.
