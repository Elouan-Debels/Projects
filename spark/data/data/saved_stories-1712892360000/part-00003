Despite the studied 10 week period ending in\nApril, the report was internally released earlier this month. The ten studied\nEuropean regions are highlighted in blue.\n\nA leaked 130-page report made public here for the first time documents an\ninternational censorship campaign funded by the British government and led by\na public relations contractor for U.S. Special Operations Forces. The basic\nstrategy is to redefine \u201cdisinformation\u201d to include even factual criticism of\nthe U.S. military or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and then\nto exert \u201ccoordinated action to pressure social media and digital market\nactors\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d such speech. The previously secret report also\nrecommends \u201cintensifying cooperation among the intelligence agencies within\nthe EU [European Union]\u201d, which in the past has included Ukrainian\nintelligence conducting what it described as a \u201cmulti-level special operation\u201d\nin Spain to arrest a critical journalist for treason over his YouTube\nbroadcasts.\n\nA screenshot of the introduction to the leaked final report of Open\nInformation Partnership\u2019s Ukraine War Disinfo Working Group. The term\n\u201cdisinformation\u201d is defined to include large categories of verifiably true\ncriticisms of Western governments, including those deemed \u201cemotive\u201d or to have\noriginated from an anonymous source. Such a definition of disinformation is\neven more expansive than \u201cmalinformation\u201d, which is generally understood as\nfactual information shared out of context.\n\nThe international effort is coordinated by the U.K.-based government public\nrelations contractor Zinc Network, which rose to prominence more than two\nyears ago as the subject of the first piece of investigative journalism to be\nforceably labeled by Twitter as potentially obtained through hacking. Despite\nbeing based upon documents implicitly confirmed as authentic, the reporting\nwas arguably panned by major U.S. outlets because of the embarrassing ties it\nrevealed between Western intelligence agencies and prominent investigative\njournalism.\n\nBased upon a fresh leak of a report internally released by the Ukraine War\nDisinfo Working Group of Zinc\u2019s Open Information Partnership (OIP) earlier\nthis month, the author is independently concluding that the U.K. government-\nfunded network of think tanks and investigative journalists has recommended a\ncoordinated campaign to pressure social media companies and \u201cdigital market\nactors\u201d into suppressing even factual criticism of NATO-aligned governments.\n\nWe are further revealing from public procurement records that Zinc Network\nreceived more than $500,000 from a direct contract with U.S. Special\nOperations Command in Kenya and more than $3 million from a subcontract with\nU.S. Army Europe and Africa under the controversial U.S. intelligence\ncontractor CACI. (Last month a federal judge again refused to dismiss a\nlawsuit against CACI regarding its alleged support for U.S. military torture\nin the Abu Ghraib prison.)\n\nMuch of the polarization surrounding The Grayzone\u2019s reporting centered on\nOIP\u2019s previous partnership with the influential investigatory nonprofit\nBellingcat, whom Zinc funded with more than 65,000 euros between 2019 and\n2021. Grayzone\u2019s 2021 publication noted that one of the potential Bellingcat\ntrainers named in Zinc\u2019s documents was Christiaan Triebert, who subsequently\nmoved to the Visual Investigations team of The New York Times. Bellingcat\u2019s\nformer director of training and research, Aric Toler, recently joined the same\nteam.\n\nZinc Network and Bellingcat did not respond to detailed requests for comment\nsent two days before publication. Additional emails to the two official public\naccounts associated with OIP bounced due to the author\u2019s email address not\nbeing on a pre-approved list, but both Zinc and its OIP team confirmed receipt\ndirectly before the requested response deadline. This article will be updated\nif any of the organizations provide a post-publication comment.\n\nThe former head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s short-lived\nDisinformation Governance Board, Nina Jankowicz, has also prominently\nadvertised their role as a member of OIP\u2019s advisory board. Much of the concern\nsurrounding such a content moderation board within DHS stemmed from fears that\nit could become a tool for suppressing even factual critiques of the U.S.\nGovernment \u2014 an overt aim of the newly public OIP report.\n\nA screenshot from the second page of the leaked final report of the Ukraine\nWar Disinfo Working Group which details the distribution of narrative analysis\ntasks to eleven different organizations.\n\nThe Ukraine War Disinfo Working Group\u2019s study was largely outsourced by Zinc\nto eleven separate organizations: the Ukrainian narrative surveillance firm\nLetsData led the social media data collection and network analysis, while each\nof the ten Eastern European regions of study was handled by a separate think\ntank. For example, analysis of Ukraine was assigned to Detector Media, whose\n2020 annual report listed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, the U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development, OIP, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark\nas funders.\n\nThe number one target of Detector\u2019s campaign in Ukraine, journalist and\npolitician Anatoliy Shariy, has been twice charged with treason by the\nSecurity Service of Ukraine (SBU). The first charge, for posting a map of\nUkraine to his YouTube channel which excluded Crimea and the Donbas, resulted\nin his brief arrest in Spain as a result of what the SBU itself described as a\n\u201cmulti-level special operation\u201d. The second charge was announced in July\nthrough the SBU\u2019s Telegram channel, based on an accusation that Shariy\nprovided filming advice to Russian intelligence.\n\nA screenshot from Detector Media\u2019s list of \u201cKey actors\u201d for \u201cpro-Russian\u201d\nnarratives in Ukraine from page 125 of the final report of Open Information\nPartnership\u2019s Ukraine War Disinfo Working Group. Detector\u2019s primary target,\njournalist Anatoliy Shariy, has twice been charged with treason by the\nSecurity Service of Ukraine (SBU). Shariy was temporarily arrested in Spain\nlast year through what the SBU labeled a \u201cmulti-level special operation\u201d in\nresponse to posting a map of Ukraine to his YouTube channel which excluded the\noccupied regions of Crimea and the Donbas.\n\nLeaked emails from the Twitter Files revealed that the U.S. Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) forwarded requests from the SBU to Twitter which included\na demand to censor both Shariy and Canadian journalist Aaron Mat\u00e9. Mat\u00e9 is\nperhaps the second most prominent contributor to The Grayzone behind founding\neditor Max Blumenthal, whom OIP names alongside Columbia professor Jeffrey\nSachs as an influential American figure in \u201cpro-Russian\u201d narratives in\nBelarus. The SBU\u2019s request for Twitter to censor Shariy and Mat\u00e9 came one year\nafter Grayzone\u2019s expos\u00e9 of Zinc\u2019s Open Information Partnership.\n\nThe OIP working group\u2019s recent recommendation of \u201ccoordinated action to\npressure social media and digital market actors\u201d to censor even factual\njournalism is laid out in the leaked final report. The first page of its\nintroduction defines disinformation to include even verifiable criticisms of\nNATO, with two such explicit categories including \u201cContent based on verifiable\ninformation which...uses emotive or inflammatory language\u201d and \u201cNot-\nattributable...information which fits with existing pro-Kremlin narratives,\naims or activities\u201d. Under a non-partisan extension of this system, the U.S.\nCongressman-endorsed online troll army known as the North Atlantic Fella\nOrganization (NAFO) would have its communications labeled as disinformation,\nregardless of the veracity of its individual arguments. But OIP\u2019s targets are\ninstead influential journalists who report critically on NATO.\n\nThe basic methodology of the report was to collect 50 postings each week using\nkeyword searches on individually selected \u201cpro-Russian\u201d information sources in\neach of the ten studied regions, typically taking 35 of the 50 posts from\nsocial media such as Telegram and Facebook and 15 from online media outlets.\nU.S. Army Cyber Command has similarly been purchasing bulk copies of the\npublic content of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter as part\nof its mission to protect the \u201cNATO brand\u201d, as was revealed by the author in\nApril.\n\n(Twelve pages of the Ukraine War Disinfo Working Group\u2019s final report were\nmade public six days ago on LinkedIn by the Lithuanian non-profit Civic\nResilience Initiative (CIR), which handled the Baltics region for the group.\nSeveral weekly reports from OIP\u2019s study were also published by Political\nCapital, the Hungarian think tank tasked with monitoring narratives in its own\ncountry. While of a similar format, the weekly reports do not contain, for\nexample, the final report\u2019s noteworthy recommendation of a coordinated\npressure campaign against social media companies and \u201cdigital market actors\u201d.\nCIR\u2019s twelve pages similarly are focused on the Baltics and do not contain the\nfull report\u2019s more controversial definitions or recommendations.)\n\nA screenshot from the ninth page of the leaked final report of the Ukraine War\nDisinfo Working Group commissioned by the Zinc Network\u2019s Open Information\nPartnership with funding from the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development\nOffice. The contained text explains the group\u2019s methodology for surveilling\n\u201cpro-Russian narratives\u201d on select Telegram and Facebook accounts, as well as\nin targeted media outlets, through a partnership with the Ukrainian company\nLetsData.\n\nThe leaked U.K. government-funded report explicitly warns against usage of the\nphrase \u201cthe West\u201d, arguing that \u201cThis may fuel the narrative that the so-\ncalled \u2018collective West\u2019 exerts undue control over Ukraine.\u201d On the other\nhand, the final pages of the report argue that \u201cintelligence agencies across\nEurope can and should do more and they require a more unified approach\n[emphasis theirs]\u201d. The group further recommends \u201cImproving and intensifying\ncooperation among the intelligence agencies within the EU with the focus on\nmalign foreign information influence.\u201d\n\n64 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n17 Restacks\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Exclusive: British government funded a plan for international censorship\nof critiques of NATO\n\njackpoulson.substack.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nMariaAccounting and Finance Newslett...Sep 25, 2023The effort JSOC, Ukraine,\nNATO etc. put into these 'disinformation' campaigns is eye-opening.
