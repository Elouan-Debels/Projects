Older\nversions are disappearing, and the terms are getting much more restrictive.\n\nThe corporation behind the continued development of OpenVMS, VMS Software,\nInc. \u2013 or VSI to its friends, if it has any left after this \u2013 has announced\nthe latest Updates to the Community Program. The news does not look good: you\ncan't get the Alpha and Itanium versions any more, only a limited x86-64\nedition.\n\nOpenVMS is one of the granddaddies of big serious OSes. A direct descendant of\nthe OSes that inspired DOS, CP/M, OS/2, and Windows, as well as the native OS\nof the hardware on which Unix first went 32-bit, VMS has been around for\nnearly half a century. For decades, its various owners have offered various\nflavors of \"hobbyist program\" under which you could get licenses to install\nand run it for free, as long as it wasn't in production use.\n\nSince Compaq acquired DEC, then HP acquired Compaq, its prospects looked\ncheckered. HP officially killed it off in 2013, then in 2014 granted it a\nreprieve and sold it off instead. New owner VSI ported it to x86-64, releasing\nthat new version 9.2 in 2022.\n\nAround this time last year, we covered VSI adding AMD support and opening a\nhobbyist program of its own. It seems from the latest announcement that it has\nbeen disappointed by the reception:\n\nDespite our initial aspirations for robust community engagement, the reality\nhas fallen short of our expectations. The level of participation in activities\nsuch as contributing open source software, creating wiki articles, and\nproviding assistance on forums has not matched the scale of the program. As a\nresult, we find ourselves at a crossroads, compelled to reassess and\nrecalibrate our approach.\n\nAlthough HPE stopped offering hobbyist licenses for the original VAX versions\nof OpenVMS in 2020, VSI continued to maintain OpenVMS 8 (in other words, the\nAlpha and Itanium editions) while it worked on version 9 for x86-64. VSI even\noffered a Student Edition, which included a freeware Alpha emulator and a copy\nof OpenVMS 8.4 to run inside it.\n\n  * Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n  * Red Hat tries on a McKinsey cap in quest to streamline techies' jobs\n  * Good news: HMRC offers a Linux version of Basic PAYE Tools. Bad news: It broke\n  * FreeBSD Foundation hands out Beacon gongs for safer software\n\nThose licenses run out in 2025, and they won't be renewed. If you have vintage\nDEC Alpha or HP Integrity boxes with Itanic chips, you won't be able to get a\nlegal licensed copy of OpenVMS for them, or renew the license of any existing\ninstallations \u2013 unless you pay, of course.\n\nThere will still be a Community license edition, but from now on it's x86-64\nonly. Although OpenVMS 9 mainly targets hypervisors anyway, it does support\nbare-metal operations on a single model of HPE server, the ProLiant DL380\nGen10. If you have one of them to play with \u2013 well, tough. Now Community users\nonly get a VM image, supplied as a VMWare .vmdk file. It contains a ready-to-\ngo \"OpenVMS system disk with OpenVMS, compilers and development tools\ninstalled.\" Its license runs for a year, after which you will get a fresh\ncopy.\n\nThis means you won't be able to configure your own system and keep it alive \u2013\nyou'll have to recreate it, from scratch, annually. The only alternative for\nthose with older systems is to apply to be an OpenVMS Ambassador.\n\nThe decision is understandable. There is no new Alpha or Itanium hardware and\nnever will be. VSI is a business, and not a big one; it needs to make money.\nWhile it was maintaining v8, it continued offering hobbyist licenses for it,\nbut now, if OpenVMS has a future, it's v9. VSI put a lot of effort \u2013 and money\n\u2013 into creating the new x86-64 edition. Version 9 is its only chance of\nsurvival, so that's what it wants to promote.\n\nBut saying that... rare indeed are those passionate about vintage enterprise\nsoftware that they want to run old big-iron servers in their basements, and\nkeep them legally licensed. Alienating those folks doesn't look good, and\nsurely won't help. The Reg FOSS desk suspects that the main result will be to\nencourage them to run up the skull and crossbones flag and become software\npirates. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Retro computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Retro computing\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Android\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Linux\n  * macOS\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * MySQL\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Qubes\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows XP\n  * WordPress\n\n#### More about\n\n47 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Retro computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Retro computing\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Android\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Linux\n  * macOS\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * MySQL\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Qubes\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows XP\n  * WordPress\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### A cheeky intern nearly turned MS-DOS into NSFW-DOS\n\nEaster egg in test build could have scrambled Microsoft's reputation\n\nOSes3 days | 48\n\n#### How a single buck bought bragging rights in the battle to port Windows 95\nto NT\n\nIt reached the desktop and then ...\n\nOffbeat14 days | 137\n\n#### Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n\nIn happier news, Ubuntu Pro extended support now goes up to 12 years\n\nSecurity14 days | 18\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware7 days | 183\n\n#### Good news: HMRC offers a Linux version of Basic PAYE Tools.
