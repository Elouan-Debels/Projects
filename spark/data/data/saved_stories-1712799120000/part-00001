(known as Infinium Labs, Inc. until 2006) was a\ncompany founded in 2002 by Tim Roberts which made computer keyboards. However,\nPhantom was best known for the Phantom, a video game console advertised for\nInternet gaming on demand in 2004; it was never marketed, leading to\nsuggestions that it was vaporware. The company's website was last updated in\nlate 2011.^[3]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nInfinium Labs was founded by Tim Roberts in 2002 as a private company. In\nJanuary 2003 it issued a press release saying that it would soon release a\n\"revolutionary new gaming platform\" with an on-demand video-game service,\ndelivering games through an online subscription. The press release had no\nspecific information, but included a computer-generated prototype design. Due\nto the use of buzzwords and the lack of details, the product was derided\nnearly from the beginning^[4] by news sites such as IGN^[5] and Slashdot and\nin the Penny Arcade webcomic.^[6] The hardware and gaming site HardOCP\nresearched and wrote an extensive article on the company and its operation,\nand was sued in turn. The Phantom placed first in Wired News's \"Vaporware\n2004\".^[7] In 2004, Infinium Labs went public.^[8]\n\nRoberts left the company in summer 2005 (with millions of shares of stock)\nbefore any products had been delivered. He later rejoined as chairman of the\nboard, but in a July 2007 press release he again resigned from the\ncompany.^[8] Subsequent CEOs included Kevin Bachus (who took the post in\nAugust 2005), Greg Koler (in January 2006)^[9] and John Landino, who was\nappointed CEO and interim chief financial officer in July 2008.^[10]\n\nIn September 2006 the company (which had changed its name from Infinium\nLabs)^[11] promised to introduce its Phantom Lapboard product in November\n2006, with a gaming service to follow in March 2007.^[12] In June 2008, the\ncompany released the Lapboard.^[13] In August 2007, Phantom Entertainment\nsigned an agreement with ProGames Network to provide Lapboards and \"game-\nservice content\" in hotels worldwide.^[14]\n\n## The Phantom[edit]\n\nThe PhantomThe Phantom at E3 2004 in Los Angeles  \n---  \nType| Home video game console  \nGeneration| If released, sixth or seventh generation (depending on release\ndate)  \nRelease date| Canceled; release promised in November 2004, January, March and\nSeptember 2005  \n  \nThe Phantom is a cancelled home video game console whose development was\nsupposedly begun by Phantom Entertainment\u2013then known as Infinium Labs\u2013in 2003.\nThe device was said to be capable of playing current and future PC games,\ngiving the system a large initial game library and making it easier for\ndevelopers to produce games for the system. The system was said to feature a\ndirect-download content delivery service, instead of the discs and cartridges\nused by most game consoles at the time.\n\nPress releases said in 2003 that the console would be released that year, and\nthe digital rights management software would be provided by\nDiStream.^[15]^[16] A prototype Phantom was first seen at the May 2004\nElectronic Entertainment Expo (E3), although it was rumored to be fake.^[17]\nRobrady Design was hired to develop the first Phantom prototype, and Synopse\nID was later retained to develop second- and third-generation prototypes.\n\nTwo units of the first-generation prototype were known to exist, one publicly\ndestroyed by HardOCP at QuakeCon 2004 as a result of their legal battles with\nthe company (see below),^[18] the other was spotted by a computer repair shop\nin Venice, Florida in 2015 and reported by Ars Technica.^[19] In October 2021,\na first-generation prototype unit was listed for auction, presumably the same\nunit that was previously reported by Ars Technica due to its listed repair\nhistory.^[20] A second-generation prototype unit shown at E3 2004 surfaced a\nyear later after the discovery of the surviving 2003 prototype.^[21]\n\n### Release[edit]\n\nThe Phantom had an online release on August 17, 2003, with basic hardware\nspecifications and a price of \"below $399\".^[22] Options included customized\nhardware and the PhantomNet (a gaming-content service), priced at $9.95 a\nmonth. A sale date for the first quarter of 2004 was set. It was missed; the\ncompany later claimed it would go on sale in November for the holiday season,\nalthough it had not developed online-delivery software, licensed games or\nfound any retailers. The second deadline was missed, with Infinium sending\nthousands of faxes claiming that the system would be released in January 2005.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Infinium predicted the system's release for around\nMarch 2005. That date also passed, and Infinium Labs was absent from the 2005\nE3.^[23] Kevin Bachus (former Infinium CEO) hinted that the Phantom would be\nreleased around the same time as the Xbox 360 in fall 2005, but that date was\nalso missed. By August 2006, the Phantom Console was removed from the products\npage of the Phantom Entertainment website.\n\n### Financial problems[edit]\n\nThe company was unable to raise its projected $30 million to complete the\nPhantom and announced it would downsize and focus on the Phantom Lapboard, a\nwireless keyboard for home use. On May 16, 2006, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission accused Phantom Entertainment founder and former CEO Timothy\nRoberts of running a \"pump and dump\" scheme in promoting the Phantom console\nin 2004.^[24] The Phantom lost credibility in the gaming and business worlds\nbecause its release date was continually pushed back, and because of financial\nscandals involving Phantom Entertainment (which lost more than $62.7 million\nsince its creation).^[25]\n\n## Lapboard[edit]\n\nLapboard (black version)\n\nThe Phantom Lapboard is a wireless keyboard made by the company. It was\nreleased on June 23, 2008, two years after its originally planned release\ndate. Designed as a component of the Phantom game console, it is sold for use\nwith Internet TV and PC video games since the console has been cancelled.^[26]\nIn 2010, a new model of the Lapboard was released to work with Internet TV,\ngaming and media centers.^[27]\n\n### Announcement[edit]\n\nOn January 3, 2006, Infinium Labs announced that the lapboard component of the\nconsole (a keyboard and mouse designed to be held on the lap, for example,\nseated on a couch in front of a television) was due to be released to online\nretailers by the second quarter of 2006.^[28] On April 19 it announced that\nthe keyboard would not be released in time for Q2 2006, but the device\n(manufactured by Itron Technology) would be released in North America and\nEurope \"no later than October\" 2006.^[29] On August 15 it was announced that\nthe price for the Lapboard would be $129.99, with customers who preordered\nreceiving a $30 discount.^[30] The keyboard was then delayed until\nNovember.^[26] On August 22, 2007, Phantom Entertainment signed an agreement\nwith ProGames Network to provide Lapboards and its game services content in\nhotels worldwide^[14] as well as with Alienware for their media center PCs\n(Alienware later pulled out of the agreement in December 2007 due to another\ndelay in Lapboard's launch).^[31] The keyboard was finally released on June\n23, 2008,^[32] two years after its originally planned release date.\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\nWhite Lapboard\n\nIn April 2008 Maximum PC published a preview of the lapboard, describing it as\n\"extremely promising\" although the supplied mouse \"experienced signal dropouts\nat a distance of about 24 inches from the sensor\". The author was able to use\nother wireless mice successfully. The preview states that the peripheral will\nbe available in \"June for $130 in limited quantities\".^[33] In the actual\nreview, however, Maximum PC gave the Lapboard a verdict of 4 out of 10 saying:\n\"The bottom line is that this thing is bad. The mouse isn\u2019t good for gaming,\nthe angled keyboard is awful for typing, and for media playback you\u2019d do much\nbetter with a slimmer wireless media keyboard with a built-in trackpad or\nball, which are available for significantly less than the Lapboard\u2019s $140\nasking price.\" On July 20, 2009, a sample lapboard received a favorable review\nfrom the Hardware Heaven website.^[34] Despite its lukewarm review, in May\n2010 About.com included the Phantom Lapboard in its Father's Day gift\nguide.^[35]^[36] On July 19, 2010, Michael Welter posted a generally positive\nreview of the Phantom Lapboard on Missing Remote.^[37]\n\n## Legal controversies[edit]\n\n### HardOCP lawsuit[edit]\n\nIn September 2003 HardOCP, a computer-hardware news website, published an\ninvestigative report by writer Steve Lynch critical of Infinium Labs and its\nfounder.^[38] On February 19, 2004, Infinium Labs' lawyers sent a cease and\ndesist letter to HardOCP's editor demanding that the news site take down the\narticle, claiming that it \"painted a portrait of a company intent on swindling\nthe public\" and threatening to file a defamation suit. Rather than concede to\nInfinium's demands, HardOCP owner Kyle Bennett filed a lawsuit for a\ndeclaratory judgment that his company had done nothing wrong.^[39] Infinium\nLabs then filed suit in Florida, denying that Texas was the proper\njurisdiction (although it had previously maintained a staffed office in\nRichardson).^[40]\n\nIn September 2004, the judge required Infinium Labs to produce a number of\nfinancial records, including Roberts's personal income-tax returns, by the end\nof that month. Because the company failed to produce the required documents,\nHardOCP won a court order compelling them to do so. The judge ruled that\nsanctions would be awarded to KB Networks and Kyle Bennett in an amount to be\ndetermined by the court (later reported as $50,000).^[41] Infinium Labs\nsettled the suit, agreeing to drop the pending Florida suit, and admitting all\nallegations of KB Networks' Texas complaint; they paid $50,000 to end the\nsuit.\n\n### Other controversies[edit]\n\nIn October 2005, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) had notified Tim Roberts that charges were pending against\nhim for violating federal securities laws.^[42] In a statement about the\nnotice, Infinium said it was not notified of specific charges, but suspected\nthey were related to an SEC investigation of the unlawful promotion of penny\nstocks (including Infinium's).^[43] Roberts hired a stock promoter to send\nfaxes claiming that the Phantom console's release was imminent, and the\ncompany's stock price might increase as much as 3,000 percent. The SEC alleged\nthat the company never intended to release the console at the promised time\ndue to significant unresolved \"technological and manufacturing hurdles\", and\nthe faxes were part of a pump and dump scheme on the part of Roberts. Roberts\nreached a settlement with the SEC in which he was barred from serving as an\nofficer or public director of a public company or participating in penny-stock\nofferings for five years and paid a $30,000 fine.^[44] Roberts was again\nconvicted of fraud in 2017 in a case involving his cloud commerce startup\nventure Savtira, which collapsed in 2011.^[45]^[46]^[47]\n\nWhen Roberts was CEO of Infinium, the company failed to report a substantial\namount of interest and penalties on unpaid payroll taxes.^[48] From its\ninception, the company had consistently reported a small amount of cash on\nhand amid extensive (and increasing) debt.\n\nIn January 2006, Infinium Labs reached an agreement to borrow up to $5,000,000\nfrom Golden Gate Investors to finance the manufacturing of the Phantom\nLapboard, scheduled for release later that year. This would have been the\nlargest amount of money Infinium Labs had ever borrowed at one time. The loan\nwould have been repaid over three years, with an option of repayment with\nshares of common stock.^[49]\n\nIn February, GameSpot reported that Phantom Entertainment was suspending the\nPhantom Game Service to develop the Lapboard. An SEC filing showed three-year\nlosses in excess of $62.7 million, over half of which was marketing for the\ncompany and unreleased products. Over $24 million was spent on salaries and\nconsultants, and $2.5 million on development. Infinium claimed it still\nintended to release the Lapboard if its financial situation improved,^[50] but\nit missed release dates for the second quarter of 2006, October 2006 and\nNovember 2006. On August 15, 2006, Phantom Entertainment removed all\nreferences to the Phantom Game Receiver from its website, claiming that the\ncontent-delivery system targeted for the Phantom would be available for PCs\nrunning the Microsoft Windows XP Media Center edition;^[51] it later indicated\nthis service would be available in March 2007, after the initially planned\nNovember 2006 release of the Lapboard,^[52] the service did not materialize\nwhen the Lapboard ultimately launched in 2008.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Indrema\n  * ApeXtreme\n  * Coleco Chameleon\n  * Piposh Hollywood, a video game that Phantom Entertainment was set to publish.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Register\".
