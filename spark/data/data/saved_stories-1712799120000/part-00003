The answer might surprise you.\n\n|\n\nTingshu Wang/Reuters\n\nCEO Elon Musk, a South African who immigrated to the U.S., gets in a Tesla as\nhe leaves a hotel in Beijing, May 31, 2023. While politicians say otherwise,\nimmigrants are statistically more likely to found their own companies than\nnative-born Americans.\n\n  * By Stephen Humphries Staff writer\n\n@steve_humphries\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nAre immigrants a boon to the U.S. economy or a drag on it?\n\nFor urban centers that have experienced a surge of immigrants, the costs are\nstaggering. For instance, the office of the mayor of New York predicted that\nthe city will spend north of $12 billion through fiscal year 2025 to\naccommodate more than 100,000 migrants. But that\u2019s a microcosm. The macro\npicture tells a different story.\n\nThe United States is experiencing a labor shortage, according to Dhaval Joshi,\nchief strategist at BCA Research, an economic analysis firm. Blame the\npandemic. It led many older workers to retire early. Plus, an estimated 1.7\nmillion native-born workers ages 25 to 55 have dropped out of the workforce\nsince the pandemic. The surge of people who have immigrated to the U.S.\nlegally or illegally since 2022 has helped fill those job vacancies. That\u2019s\nhelped stave off a recession.\n\n## Why We Wrote This\n\nA story focused on\n\nProsperity\n\nImmigration and the economy are top concerns of voters ahead of the 2024 U.S.\nelection. But political talking points don\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\n\u201cOne important way to reduce inflation is to increase the production of goods\nand services,\u201d says David Bier, associate director of immigration studies at\nthe Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. \u201cOne reason why\nthe economy has adjusted over the last three years is the fact that we have\nstarted to get these immigrants into the labor force.\u201d\n\nMany foreign-born workers are filling important roles in sectors such as care\nfor older adults and construction. Sometimes, they are invisible, until\ntragedy strikes. The six workers who died while filling potholes after\nmidnight on Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge came from El Salvador,\nGuatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.\n\nImmigrants also create a disproportionate share of both patents and companies.\nSome 55% of U.S. startup companies valued at more than $1 billion were founded\nby immigrants, according to a 2022 study by the National Foundation for\nAmerican Policy.\n\nRecommended\n\nTrust\n\n### Trump defied political norms. Now he tests the stock market.\n\nThe increase in foreign-born labor is vital at a time when U.S. birthrates are\ndeclining, economists say.\n\nGet stories that empower and uplift daily.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads.\n\nSome Americans fear that an influx of unskilled laborers means lower wages for\nunskilled laborers. But Mr. Bier says that the increase in competition for\nthose jobs incentivizes workers to jockey for position by becoming more\nskilled and educated. It has a positive effect on the long-term quality of\njobs.\n\n\u201cThe story of the last 40 years is not declining living standards,\u201d says the\nanalyst. \u201cIt\u2019s a shift toward a more skilled, more service-sector economy.\nBanning immigration would disrupt that change in a very significant way.\u201d\n\nSOURCE:\n\nUSAFacts, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Stanford Graduate School of\nBusiness\n\n|\n\nJacob Turcotte/Staff\n\nYou've read 3 of 3 free articles.

My work in Kenya, for example, was\nheavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself\nto read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things \u2018boring\u2019 simply because\nthey lie outside the box we are currently in.\u201d\n\nIf you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that\nwould probably be it. We\u2019re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and\nperhaps a bit too earnest. We\u2019re the bran muffin of journalism.\n\nBut you know what? We change lives. And I\u2019m going to argue that we change\nlives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human\nbeings think they live in.\n\nThe Monitor is a peculiar little publication that\u2019s hard for the world to\nfigure out. We\u2019re run by a church, but we\u2019re not only for church members and\nwe\u2019re not about converting people. We\u2019re known as being fair even as the world\nbecomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper\u2019s founding in 1908.\n\nWe have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We\u2019re about\nkicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, \u201cYou are bigger and\nmore capable than you realize. And we can prove it.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for bran muffin journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor\nfor $15. You\u2019ll get the Monitor Weekly magazine, the Monitor Daily email, and\nunlimited access to CSMonitor.com.\n\nSubscribe to insightful journalism\n\n## Next Up\n\n  * ### Trump defied political norms.
