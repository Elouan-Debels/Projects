Demand hasn\u2019t\nrecovered fully since the energy crisis and the region\u2019s wind and solar parks\nare producing more power than ever, which is eating into the share that both\nnuclear and coal plants send to national grids.\n\n\"With current power prices, the traditional baseload plants will struggle,\nunless we face longer periods with very unfavorable solar and wind conditions,\ndrought or strong heat,\u201d said Sigurd Pedersen Lie, a senior analyst at\nStormGeo Nena A/S in Oslo.\n\nLonger term, it\u2019s a warning sign that reactors might get increasingly squeezed\nout, even as countries such as France and the U.K. plan to spend huge sums on\nnew plants, having identified the technology as a key element in the fight to\nlimit global warming. At the United Nations climate meeting in Dubai late last\nyear, they were joined by more than 20 nations including the U.S., the United\nArab Emirates, Japan and South Korea in calling for a tripling of global\nnuclear generation by the middle of the century.\n\nElectricite de France, which is just getting its fleet of nuclear plants back\non track after years of lengthy outages for repairs and checks, has already\nhad to reduce output and halt plants, or extend stoppages. Over the weekend,\nthe firm idled half a dozen plants as prices turned negative.\n\nTo the south in Spain, electricity prices for Friday plunged to the lowest\nlevel since 2013 and have barely settled above zero for weeks. The country\u2019s\nAsco I and Asco 2 reactors cut output on a regular basis in the past five\nweeks. In the Nordic region, operators are also curbing output more often.\n\nWhile EDF\u2019s reactors were designed with some degree of flexibility, the\ncompany is looking at current developments \"with extreme care,\u201d Cederic\nLewandowski, the company\u2019s head of nuclear and thermal generation, told a\nsenate hearing on Thursday.\n\nEuropean Union nations added a record amount of wind power capacity last year.\nThe growth of solar capacity exceeded 40% for a third year running, lobby\ngroup data showed.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for nuclear operators to dial down output when demand is low\nand supplies of solar and wind energy surge, but shutting down units\ncompletely is rare because of the time it takes to ramp back up again and the\ncomplexities involved.\n\n\"What we dread the most is reactor stoppages,\u201d Lewandowski said. \"If we were\nto have more frequent halts tied to renewables, climate change and so forth,\nwe would have to look at that very closely.\u201d\n\nPressure to curtail nuclear output, which often materializes when industrial\nactivity slows during weekends and holidays, may show up again soon.\nConsumption in France dropped to just 33 gigawatts in pre-dawn hours on\nSunday, according to grid data on Bloomberg. A Bloomberg model indicates that\nusage will slide below 35 gigawatts again next weekend. That\u2019s a level more\nnormally seen in May when the weather is warmer.\n\nSince Thursday, French day-ahead prices have been below \u20ac10 per megawatt-hour,\nin addition to going negative for Saturday in an auction on Epex Spot SE in\nParis.\n\nAccording to Sabrina Kernbichler, lead power analyst at Energy Aspects, EDF\nneeds to recoup about \u20ac22 ($23.80) per megawatt-hour in the wholesale market\nto operate economically. EDF declined to comment.\n\nIt\u2019s not just nuclear plants that will suffer. Some German coal stations are\nalso likely to face months on the sidelines, according to StormGeo\u2019s Lie, as\nthey are outmaneuvered by gas plants that are cheaper to operate after a\nplunge in the price of that fuel.\n\nThe current concerns for producers have also been exacerbated by a mild, windy\nand rainy winter, which is pushing hydropower operators to empty reservoirs to\nmake room for the melting snowpack, said Emeric de Vigan, vice president for\npower markets at industry consultant Kpler SAS.\n\nThe issue for nuclear generators will only become more acute as the green\nexpansion continues, especially if power demand remains lower for longer. The\nEuropean Union\u2019s target of a 42.5% share for renewables in the EU\u2019s energy mix\nby the end of the decade raises the stakes further for legacy plants ranging\nfrom nuclear to coal and even gas.\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nnuclear energy(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/nuclear-energy),\nrenewables(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/renewables),\nEurope(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/europe),\nENERGY(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/energy)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
