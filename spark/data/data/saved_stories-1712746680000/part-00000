Photograph from Vernon Richards' 'George Orwell at Home'.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever expressed a political view to the left of Tony Blair, chances\nare you\u2019ve been met with a response along the lines of: \u2018Haven\u2019t you ever read\nany Orwell?\u2019 The irony of this statement is usually in how little Orwell that\nperson has actually read.\n\nSubmitted by Ed on January 9, 2019\n\nCopied to clipboard\n\nScratching the surface a little, it\u2019s pretty much always limited to some\ncombination of the following:\n\n  * Something from Animal Farm i.e. \u201cAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\u201d or similar\n  * Some catchphrases from Nineteen Eighty-Four i.e. \u201cThought Police\u201d, \u201cThoughtcrime\u201d, \u201cBig Brother\u201d or similar\n  * A general idea they remember from school that those books were against the Soviet Union and, therefore, all socialism ever\n\nThis obvious flaw here is that Orwell was, in fact, a socialist himself1 , who\ntook part in a literal revolution as part of a Marxist militia (the POUM,\nwhose name translates to \u2018Workers\u2019 Party of Marxist Unification\u2019).\n\nSo in the hope that the \u2018read some Orwell\u2019 crowd might shut up with their\nhalf-baked anti-socialism they absorbed at school without giving it a second\nthought, here are some Orwell quotes they never mention. Maybe they might even\nend up actually reading some Orwell as well!\n\n## 1\\. Orwell did not write Animal Farm to be anti-socialist or anti-\nrevolution\n\nWriting to his friend, the American writer and critic, Dwight Macdonald,\nOrwell explained:\n\n> Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution. ...\n> I meant the moral to be that revolutions only effect a radical improvement\n> when the masses are alert and know how to chuck out their leaders as soon as\n> the latter have done their job. The turning-point of the story was supposed\n> to be when the pigs kept the milk and apples for themselves (Kronstadt). If\n> the other animals had had the sense to put their foot down then, it would\n> have been all right. If people think I am defending the status quo, that is,\n> I think, because they have grown pessimistic and assume that there is no\n> alternative except dictatorship or laissez-faire capitalism.\n\n## 2\\. Orwell actually took part in a revolution\n\nAs mentioned above, contrary to his supposed anti-socialism, Orwell actually\ntook part in the revolutionary events which accompanied the Spanish Civil War,\nwriting about it in his excellent book, Homage to Catalonia. In chapter one,\nhe describes his experiences of Barcelona under workers\u2019 control:\n\n> Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and\n> was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists;\n> every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of\n> the revolutionary parties ... All this was queer and moving. There was much\n> in it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I\n> recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\n\nHowever, though fighting with the Marxist POUM, he never formally joined the\nparty itself. He did, however, express sympathy for the anarchists, explaining\n(in chapter nine) that he only decided not to join as a result of his desire\nto go to the Madrid front:\n\n> As far as my purely personal preferences went I would have liked to join the\n> Anarchists. If one became a member of the CNT it was possible to enter the\n> FAI militia, but I was told that the FAI were likelier to send me to Teruel\n> than to Madrid. If I wanted to go to Madrid I must join the International\n> Column, which meant getting a recommendation from a member of the Communist\n> Party.\n\nIn chapter ten of Homage to Catalonia, Orwell also declares himself very much\nas ACAB:\n\n> I have no particular love for the idealized \u2018worker\u2019 as he appears in the\n> bourgeois Communist\u2019s mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker\n> in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask\n> myself which side I am on.\n\nOrwell\u2019s experience in Spain would stay with him for all his life, as he wrote\nin \u2018Why I Write\u2019, published in 1946 (i.e. after Animal Farm and just before he\nwrote Nineteen Eighty-Four):\n\n> The Spanish war and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter\n> I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since\n> 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and\n> for democratic socialism, as I understand it.\n\n## 3\\. Orwell didn\u2019t believe centrism could defeat fascism\n\nWhile we might not agree with all of Orwell\u2019s politics, it\u2019s just indisputable\nthat he believed in some form of socialism (even if his precise definition may\nbe up for discussion) and that it was through socialism that fascism could be\ndefeated. In chapter five of Homage to Catalonia he explains how Franco\u2019s\nfascist forces were initially beaten:\n\n> by a huge effort, mainly of the working class, aided by some of the armed\n> forces (Assault Guards, etc.) who had remained loyal. It was the kind of\n> effort that could probably only be made by people who were fighting with a\n> revolutionary intention \u2014 i.e. believed that they were fighting for\n> something better than the status quo.\n\nOrwell follows a similar line of argument2 again in his 1941 essay \u2018The Lion\nand the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius\u2019:\n\n> We cannot win the war without introducing Socialism, nor establish Socialism\n> without winning the war.\n\nAnd, in case the point needed clarifying:\n\n> The difference between Socialism and capitalism is not primarily a\n> difference of technique. One cannot simply change from one system to the\n> other as one might install a new piece of machinery in a factory, and then\n> carry on as before, with the same people in positions of control. Obviously\n> there is also needed a complete shift of power. New blood, new men, new\n> ideas \u2013 in the true sense of the word, a revolution.\n\n## 4\\. Orwell believed in killing fascists\n\nWhen arguing that modern-day fascists should be met with physical force, the\nresponse is often something along the lines of \u2018who gets to decide who\u2019s a\nfascist?\u2019, pulling out a line from Orwell\u2019s \u2018Politics and the English\nLanguage\u2019:\n\n> The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies\n> \u201csomething not desirable\u201d.\n\nThe implication being that anti-fascists just call anyone they don\u2019t like\n\u2018fascists\u2019 and, by extension, that the people being called \u2018fascists\u2019 are\nactually \u2018patriots\u2019 who believe in \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019 who don\u2019t deserve\nphysical opposition.\n\nConveniently, these people don\u2019t mention the next sentence which reads: \u201cThe\nwords democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each\nof them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one\nanother\u201d and that \u201cWords of this kind are often used in a consciously\ndishonest way.\u201d The point, part of a section titled \u2018Meaningless Words\u2019, is\nthat political buzzwords are used to conceal real meanings.\n\nOne example Orwell gives: \u201cMarshal P\u00e9tain was a true patriot\u201d. Marshal P\u00e9tain\nwas a Nazi collaborator who led German-occupied France during World War Two.\nOrwell\u2019s point is therefore as much that fascists like to conceal themselves\nbehind words like \u2018patriot\u2019 as it is that the word \u2018fascist\u2019 is sometimes\nmisused.\n\nInterestingly, while these types like to pull out the \u2018fascism has no meaning\u2019\nquote, they rarely mention the following one from chapter five of Homage to\nCatalonia:\n\n> When I joined the militia I had promised myself to kill one Fascist \u2014 after\n> all, if each of us killed one they would soon be extinct\n\n## 5\\. For Orwell, there was no such thing as a right-wing intellectual\n\nA fun one to remind those Jordan Peterson sycophants and other perusers of the\nso-called \u2018intellectual dark web\u2019 is a statement from Orwell which only seems\nto get truer with time:\n\n> It should be noted that there is now no intelligentsia that is not in some\n> sense \u201cLeft\u201d. Perhaps the last right-wing intellectual was TE Lawrence.\n\nTE Lawrence (aka \u2018Lawrence of Arabia\u2019) died in 1935.\n\n  * 1Of course, the kind of socialist Orwell was fluctuated over time: from revolutionary with anarchist leanings to left-wing social democrat. These complications are also compounded by his inexcusable decision to pass on names of Communist Party members and sympathisers to British intelligence, often put down to some combination of anti-Stalinism, wanting to help the Labour government and not being of entirely sound mind as a result of the tuberculosis which killed him a few months later.\n  * 2Though by now his idea of a break with the status quo had changed significantly from the possibilities he saw in revolutionary Catalonia towards a far-left social democracy/democratic socialism.\n\n  * writers\n  * United Kingdom\n  * George Orwell\n\n## Comments\n\nadri\n\n5 years 3 months ago\n\nIn reply to Welcome by libcom.org\n\nSubmitted by adri on January 9, 2019\n\n### I did a blog thing about this\n\nI did a blog thing about this a while back myself (of probably not the best\nquality/research). It's always strange to me when right-wingers invoke Orwell\nand his works to lend support to their views, especially when he plainly\ncalled himself a democratic socialist (for whatever that's worth) in \"Why I\nWrite,\" as you point out. Nice to see articles/blogs addressing this, to put\nright-wingers in their place when they try bringing him up.\n\nThere's also this passage from Homage to Catalonia which effectively dispels\nany idea Orwell was \"anti-Socialist/Communist\".\n\n> I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has\n> anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of\n> party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy \u2018proving\u2019 that Socialism\n> means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left\n> intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite\n> different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and\n> makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the \u2018mystique\u2019 of \u2018Socialism,\n> is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a\n> classless society, or it means nothing at all. And it was here that those\n> few months in the militia were valuable to me. For the Spanish militias,\n> while they lasted, were a sort of microcosm of a classless society.

And, after\n> all, instead of disillusioning me it deeply attracted me. The effect was to\n> make my desire to see Socialism established much more actual than it had\n> been before. Partly, perhaps, this was due to the good luck of being among\n> Spaniards, who, with their innate decency and their ever-present Anarchist\n> tinge, would make even the opening stages of Socialism tolerable if they had\n> the chance.\n\nMrSickNoodle\n\n5 years 3 months ago\n\nIn reply to Welcome by libcom.org\n\nSubmitted by MrSickNoodle on January 10, 2019\n\n### I love this.

In the long run \u2013 it is important to\nremember that it is only in the long run \u2013 the working class remains the most\nreliable enemy of Fascism, simply because the working class stands to gain\nmost by a decent reconstruction of society. Unlike other classes or\ncategories, it can\u2019t be permanently bribed.\n\nTo say this is not to idealize the working class. In the long struggle that\nhas followed the Russian Revolution it is the manual workers who have been\ndefeated, and it is impossible not to feel that it was their own fault. Time\nafter time, in country after country, the organized working-class movements\nhave been crushed by open, illegal violence, and their comrades abroad, linked\nto them in theoretical solidarity, have simply looked on and done nothing; and\nunderneath this, secret cause of many betrayals, has lain the fact that\nbetween white and coloured workers there is not even lip-service to\nsolidarity. Who can believe in the class-conscious international proletariat\nafter the events of the past ten years? To the British working class the\nmassacre of their comrades in Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, or wherever it might be,\nseemed less interesting and less important than yesterday\u2019s football match.\nYet this does not alter the fact that the working class will go on struggling\nagainst Fascism after the others have caved in. \"\n\nJuan Conatz\n\n5 years 3 months ago\n\nIn reply to Welcome by libcom.org\n\nSubmitted by Juan Conatz on January 10, 2019\n\n### Is Orwell really worth\n\nIs Orwell really worth defending though?

He told me that the world could not be completely\nencapsulated within the boundaries of socialist philosophy. I had more or less\ncome to this conclusion on my own, but had not admitted so much in words. Soon\nafterward, however, I read George Orwell\u2019s Road to Wigan Pier. This book\nfinally undermined me\u2014not only my socialist ideology, but my faith in\nideological stances themselves. In the famous essay concluding that book\n(written for\u2014and much to the dismay of\u2014the British Left Book Club) Orwell\ndescribed the great flaw of socialism, and the reason for its frequent failure\nto attract and maintain democratic power (at least in Britain). Orwell said,\nessentially, that socialists did not really like the poor. They merely hated\nthe rich. His idea struck home instantly. Socialist ideology served to mask\nresentment and hatred, bred by failure. Many of the party activists I had\nencountered were using the ideals of social justice to rationalize their\npursuit of personal revenge.\n\nAnd here is George Orwell, in The Road To Wigan Pier, which Peterson says\nconvinced him that socialism was folly because socialists were resentful:\n\nPlease notice that I am arguing for Socialism, not against it. [...] The job\nof the thinking person, therefore, is not to reject Socialism but to make up\nhis mind to humanize it...For the moment, the only possible course of any\ndecent person, however much of a Tory or an anarchist by temperament, is to\nwork for the establishment of Socialism. Nothing else can save us from the\nmisery of the present or the nightmare of the future [...] Indeed, from one\npoint of view, Socialism is such elementary common sense that I am sometimes\namazed it has not established itself already. The world is a raft sailing\nthrough space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea\nthat we must all co-operate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of\nthe work and gets his fair share of the provisions, seems so blatantly obvious\nthat one would say that nobody could possibly fail to accept it unless he had\nsome corrupt motive for clinging to the present system. [...] To recoil from\nSocialism because so many socialists are inferior people is as absurd as\nrefusing to travel by train because you dislike the ticket-collector\u2019s face.\n\nOrwell flat-out says that anybody who evaluates the merits of socialist\npolicies by the personal qualities of socialists themselves is an idiot.\nPeterson concludes that Orwell thought socialist policies was flawed because\nsocialists themselves were bad people. I don\u2019t think there is a way of reading\nPeterson other than as extremely stupid or extremely dishonest, but one can be\ncharitable and assume he simply didn\u2019t read the book that supposedly gave him\nhis grand revelation about socialism.\"\n\nredschlog\n\n5 years 2 months ago\n\nIn reply to Welcome by libcom.org\n\nSubmitted by redschlog on January 17, 2019\n\n### \u201cOne sometimes gets the\n\n\u201cOne sometimes gets the impression that the mere words \u2018Socialism\u2019 and\n\u2018Communism\u2019 draw towards them with magnetic force every fruit-juice drinker,\nnudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, \u2018Nature Cure\u2019 quack, pacifist, and\nfeminist in England\u201d: Pacifist?
