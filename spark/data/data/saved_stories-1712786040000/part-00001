Owned by ByteDance,\nit has been downloaded more than 10 million times on Android phones alone, and\nuntil recently, its website boasted that it had supported more than 200\nmillion students. But its Chinese ownership could pose problems as TikTok \u2014\nthe most famous app owned by ByteDance \u2014 fights for its life against lawmakers\nin Washington D.C.\n\nUnlike TikTok, Gauth is an educational app, designed specifically to help\nusers with their homework. To use it, you take a photo of a homework\nassignment \u2014 like a sheet of math problems, for example \u2014 and watch as AI\nsolves the problems for you. Upon downloading the app, the first prompt you\nreceive is a request for permission to use the camera. The app appears similar\nto a China-based ByteDance app known as \u201cHippo Learning.\u201d\n\nIn addition to AI help, Gauth also offers a paid \u201cPlus\u201d version, which\nconnects students with tutors in a given subject area. \u201cWe have fifty\nthousands of experts and dedicated experts ready to help you 24/7 with\nmultiple subjects,\u201d says the app description in the Apple app store. Gauth\nsolicits tutors through a website, gauthexpert.com, where it offers payment of\nup to $1500 per month for tutors with expertise in math, chemistry, physics,\nor biology. ByteDance spokesperson Mike Hughes told Forbes that tutors are\nbased in the United States, India, the Philippines and portions of Africa.\n\nGauth also offers a set of homework timers and reminders and other fun\nfeatures, including an animated \u201cPersonal AI Study Buddy\u201d and a selection of\nlofi beat soundtracks. There is also a system of \u201cpoints\u201d that can be used for\nin-app purchases; you can buy points with cash or accrue them by watching ads.\nThere is a \u201ctargeted ads\u201d toggle in your settings, which is auto-set to \u201coff.\u201d\n\nGauth\u2019s surge has come at a precipitous moment for ByteDance. On March 13, the\nHouse of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would require the\ncompany to sell its stake in TikTok or face a ban of the app in the United\nStates. The bill arose from concerns that the Chinese government could require\nByteDance to spy on Americans through TikTok, or use it to influence civic\ndiscourse in the United States. The Department of Justice opened a criminal\ninvestigation into ByteDance after it used TikTok to surveil journalists,\nincluding this reporter, in 2022, and the Chinese government has run influence\ncampaigns on the platform.\n\nAlthough Gauth is focused on math and the hard sciences, it also offers a\nchatbot that can answer questions about social sciences and the humanities. In\na series of chats with Forbes, Gauth gave uncensored answers to questions\nabout the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of Uyghur communities and the events\nof June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Asked whether President Xi Jinping looks\nlike Winnie the Pooh (a comparison that has resulted in a ban of the friendly\nyellow bear in China), the app said, \u201csome people have noticed a resemblance,\nbut as for the real deal, I\u2019ll leave that up to everyone\u2019s personal judgment.\u201d\n\nHughes noted that the chatbot is powered by OpenAI technology made available\nthrough a Microsoft Azure license. \u201cNo LLMs from ByteDance are utilized,\u201d he\nsaid. Earlier this year, Forbes reported that ByteDance had used OpenAI\u2019s GPT\nto power several other international generative AI apps.\n\nEducation apps have long been an area of interest for ByteDance, which\nlaunched its primary education brand, Dali, in 2020. The company further\nscaled up its education offerings during the COVID-19 pandemic, when students\nwere stuck learning from home. In late 2021, however, the Chinese government\nordered a crackdown on education apps, out of concern that privatizing and\ncharging for education could put it out of reach for some students. The\ncrackdown resulted in mass layoffs at ByteDance \u2014 but the company has looked\nfor ways to reenter the market ever since.\n\nTo some lawmakers in the U.S., Gauth might be a welcome addition to children\u2019s\nscreen-time diet. Senator Ted Cruz, for example, has praised ByteDance\u2019s\nDouyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, for promoting educational videos to\nChinese teens, while criticizing TikTok for promoting dangerous challenges to\nAmerican ones. Cruz, though, previously expressed vehement concern about a\nprivacy policy that allowed TikTok to share private user information with\nother companies in ByteDance\u2019s \u201ccorporate group,\u201d including those based in\nChina.\n\nAccording to Gauth\u2019s privacy policy, the information it collects can also be\nshared with other \u201centities within our corporate group.\u201d\n\nIn a chat conversation, Forbes asked Gauth outright whether the content of the\nchat was viewable to ByteDance employees in China. In response, Gauth said,\n\u201cYour privacy is important, and I\u2019m here to have a chill chat with you. But\nthe specifics of how things work behind the scenes? Not my area of expertise.\nLet\u2019s keep the conversation going\u2013got any fun topics to chat about?\u201d\n\nWhen asked about data access from China, Hughes said: \u201cA limited number of\nemployees who need access to perform their jobs can view Gauth data.\"\n\n### MORE FROM FORBES\n\nMORE FROM FORBESThe U.S. Takes A Major Step Toward Banning TikTokBy Emily\nBaker-WhiteMORE FROM FORBESWhy Is TikTok Parent ByteDance Moving Into Biology,\nChemistry And Drug Discovery?By Alexandra S.
