Image courtesy of\nthe artist.\n\nby Verity Babbs March 27, 2024\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Expulsion of the Moriscos (1627) did not have the same lucky\nescape as Las Meninas (1656) when a catastrophic four-day fire broke out in\nMadrid\u2019s royal palace in 1734. Las Meninas was snatched from the flames, taken\nfrom its frame, and thrown out of a nearby window to save it. But sadly\nExpulsion of the Moriscos was destroyed (along with 500 other artworks\nincluding those by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Titian, and Hieronymus Bosch).\n\nBut now, after almost 300 years, the work has been recreated using A.I.\ntechnology. Fernando S\u00e1nchez Castillo, a Madrid-based artist whose practice\nfocuses on reconsidering historical events and figures, has used Photoshop to\nreimagine what Expulsion of the Moriscos would have looked like before it was\ndestroyed.\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez, Philip III (1627). Courtesy Museo Nacional del Prado.\n\nThe painting showed the moment in the 1609 when King Philip III decreed that\nthe Moriscos\u2014Muslims, numbering around 300,000, who had been forced to convert\nto Christianity in the early 16th century\u2014were to be expelled from Spain. In\nthe painting, the Spanish king Philip III issues his order to expel the\nMoriscos.\n\nEighteen years later, in 1627, the king\u2019s son, King Philip IV, challenged his\ncourt\u2019s artists (Vincente Carducho, Eugenio Caxesi, Angelo Nardi, and\nVel\u00e1zquez) to a competition to earn the title of chamber painter, and dictated\nthe expulsion as the subject for their paintings. Vel\u00e1zquez won, dispelling\nthe myth that he was an artist only able to paint heads.\n\nIn addition to Photoshop, S\u00e1nchez Castillo was also armed with written\ndescriptions of the painting, made by painter and writer Antonio Palomino a\nfew years before the fire, and a preliminary study portrait of Philip III made\nby the artist in 1627 (six years after the monarch\u2019s death), which was\ndiscovered in the 1980s. (The portrait was donated to the American Friends of\nthe Prado Museum by the art historian William B. Jordan, who purchased the\nwork in 1988 at Phillips, where it had been incorrectly identified as a work\nby the circle of Flemish painter Justus Sustermans.) The artist was also\nassisted by PhD candidate Paula Garc\u00eda, whose doctoral thesis explores A.I.\u2019s\napplications in contemporary art practices.\n\nFernando S\u00e1nchez Castillo, preparatory sketch (2024). Image courtesy of the\nartist.\n\nIn S\u00e1nchez Castillo\u2019s preparatory sketch of the painting, guided by the\ndescription of Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s painting written by Palomino, he lays out the main\nelements of the composition: the two figures, the architecture, the\nbackground, and a cartouche in the lower right corner.\n\nFernando S\u00e1nchez Castillo, AI Progress Stage (2024). Image courtesy of the\nartist.\n\nNext, S\u00e1nchez Castillo begins to use generative A.I. generative to fill in the\ndetail of the background and the base architecture. The areas of\nA.I.-generated imagery do not necessarily join up cohesively to one another.\nBlank space is left for the swooping curtain, figures, and expansive sky.\n\nFernando S\u00e1nchez Castillo, AI Progress Stage (2024). Image courtesy of the\nartist.\n\nIn this next phase, the artist has expanded the A.I.-generated background to\nfill the digital canvas. He has also added his figure of Philip III and the\nseated female figure (who is currently not in her final position) as well as\nthe large red curtain. The different visual elements in this stage still do\nnot necessarily fit together.\n\nFernando S\u00e1nchez Castillo, AI Progress Stage (2024). Image courtesy of the\nartist.\n\nHere the woman\u2019s face has been made more painterly, better fitting with the\nstyle of the portrait of Philip III. The foreground plaque is added and the\narea behind the curtain is cleared out into darkness.\n\nFernando S\u00e1nchez Castillo, Expulsion of the Moriscos (2024). Image courtesy of\nthe artist.\n\nIn the final phase, S\u00e1nchez Castillo ensures that all elements sit cohesively\nwith one another, and adds a filter effect that unifies the color palette.\n\nThe usage of A.I. by artists is controversial: some of these models have been\nslammed for scrapping the work of creatives without their consent, though the\ntechnology has also proved handy in fields such as art authentication. S\u00e1nchez\nCastillo, however, sees A.I. as an addition to the artist\u2019s toolkit. \u201cI\nconsider [artificial intelligence] a powerful tool to create a community brain\nable to empower aesthetic united to ethics,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:\n\nWant to stay ahead of the art world?
