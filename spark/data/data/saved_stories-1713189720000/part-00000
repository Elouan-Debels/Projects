One \u201cmid-\nlevel\u201d Nvidia employee accrued a fortune of $62 million, claims Kim. Thus,\ncompany share schemes can be a great incentive for employees. However, as a\ncounterpoint, the senior Barron\u2019s reporter also knows of at least one Nvidia\nemployee who made a \u201chalf billion dollar mistake,\u201d after their \u2018green-gold\u2019\nslipped through their fingers.\n\n> Today, I learned about a mid-level Nvidia employee (not an engineer) who\n> maxed out the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) for 18 years. The benefit\n> allows employees to use 10-15% of salary to buy stock at a 15% discount.The\n> person left Nvidia with shares now worth $62 millionApril 11, 2024\n\nSee more\n\nIn the Tweet above, Kim tells the happy tale of a mid-level Nvidia employee\nwho \u201cmaxed out the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) for 18 years,\u201d and kept\na firm hold of this \u2018green gold.\u2019 The employee wasn\u2019t a big shot engineer, it\nis made clear. They simply took full advantage of the Nvidia ESPP, which\nallows employees to use between 10-15% of their salary to buy company stock at\na 15% discount to the market.\n\nThis lucky (wise?) employee is said to have left Nvidia with a stack of shares\nworth $62 million. It must have been hard to hold these shares without\nsometimes dipping in to take some cash, but Kim asserts that this individual\n\u201cnever sold during tenure.\u201d We don\u2019t need to say that $62 million is a\nconsiderable retirement nest egg, and hope that the ex-employee enjoys the\nbest of health, too.\n\nAs teased in the intro, not everyone who took advantage of the Nvidia ESPP\nduring the rocket-propelled share valuation gains of recent years fared so\nwell. Kim tells of an early Nvidia employee, an engineer, who once was the\nproud owner of a million Nvidia shares (a single share is valued at $882 at\nthe time of writing).\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nSadly, this employee had to sell up his green gold to pay for losses when his\nbroker \u201cmargined his account with another stock that fell 90%,\u201d explains Kim.\nA margin account is where you leverage the value of one or more holdings to\npurchase other stocks or financial assets. In this instance, the forced sell\nfrom the margin account led to a \u201chalf billion dollar mistake\u201d according to\nthe source.\n\n## Curtis Priem and the semi-retirement mode Nvidians\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we have heard of, or reported on, Nvidia employees\nand their fortunes. Last November, we wrote about a lesser-known Nvidia co-\nfounder, Curtis Priem (the first Nvidia CFO), who cashed out relatively early.\nInterestingly Priem\u2019s Nvidia stock would have been worth over $70 billion if\nhe had held onto it. However, this \u2018loss\u2019 seems to be of no concern to Priem,\nwho has an estimated $30 million personal fortune and what sounds like a busy,\nfulfilling life.\n\nWe published another fascinating story stemming from Nvidia\u2019s undeniable\nsuccess in December last year. The headlining employee with $62 million in\nNvidia shares might have retired. However, there seems to be a problem at\nNvidia with reports of wealthy Nvidia employees operating in semi-retirement\nmode.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

So, kind of a weird\ndistinction to make.\n\nReply\n\n  * slightnitpick\n\nSomething that rubs me wrong about this stock increase in general is that the\npresent value of NVIDIA is not just predicated on the work of past employees\nof NVIDIA, but the future work of future employees of NVIDIA. And yet, given\nthe stock increase, those future employees cannot hope to be compensated\nproportionately.\n\nI don't know how to solve this with stock ownership of publicly traded\ncompanies. It's just striking me as morally wrong.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nU.S. blacklists Intel's and Nvidia's key partner in China \u2014 three other\nChinese firms also included in the blacklist for helping the military\n\nWestern Digital preps 4TB SD cards for 2025 \u2014 SDUC cards big enough to tackle\n8K video\n\nRaspberry Pi 4 brings KITT from Knight Rider to life using ChatGPT\n\nJim Keller suggests Nvidia should have used Ethernet to stitch together\nBlackwell GPUs, saving billions\n\nIntel's latest CPUs run so hot that delidding has become common \u2014 EKWB\nintroduces world's first AIO liquid cooler designed for delidded CPUs\n\nFirst AI-generated rom-com is due this summer -- and the trailer puts Hallmark\nChannel to shame\n\nNanotronics promises modular, shippable chip fab facilities powered by Nvidia\nGPUs and AI\n\nRTX 4090s continue to melt \u2014 GPU repair facility claims it works on 200\nflagship Nvidia cards per month\n\nChinese gamers can't RMA their RTX 4090s due to US sanctions \u2014 users are being\nvery careful with how they treat their top-tier GPUs\n\nNearly 90% of chips used in Russia come from China despite US sanctions:\nReport\n\nCritical EUV chipmaking tool supplier hacked, pressed to pay $10 million for\nransomware unlock \u2013 Hoya dismisses hack as an \u2018IT system incident\u2019\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
