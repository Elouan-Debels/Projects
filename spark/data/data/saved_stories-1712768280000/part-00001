Our architectural design\n> advancements include multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic\n> recurrence mechanism that improve expressivity while maintaining the\n> inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs. We introduce a new\n> multilingual corpus with 1.12 trillion tokens and a fast tokenizer based on\n> greedy matching for enhanced multilinguality. We trained four Eagle models,\n> ranging from 0.46 to 7.5 billion parameters, and two Finch models with 1.6\n> and 3.1 billion parameters and find that they achieve competitive\n> performance across a wide variety of benchmarks. We release all our models\n> on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license.
