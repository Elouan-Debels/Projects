OpenGov, a leader in cloud software\nfor government, is a perfect example of that. The company just received a\nmajority investment from Cox Enterprises in a deal valued at $1.8 billion. I\u2019m\nproud to say that this is one of the largest govtech transactions ever and,\naccording to the Wall Street Journal, the largest venture-backed software exit\nin recent memory.\n\nOpenGov serves more than 1,900 U.S. cities, counties, state agencies, and\nschool districts with cloud applications for budgeting, accounting,\nprocurement, and asset management. With OpenGov, local and state entities can\noperate more efficiently, adapt to change, and strengthen public trust.\n\nMy involvement with OpenGov dates back to 2012 when I became an early investor\nin the company. I was introduced to OpenGov by its co-founder, Joe Lonsdale,\nas I had previously invested in one of Joe\u2019s earlier companies, Addepar.\n\nThose days were the start of the first major cloud cycle. There were thousands\nand thousands of on-premise systems that needed to be shifted to the cloud. As\nan early investor in Salesforce, I had direct insight into the cloud market\nand the economic value it could create for customers. My big thesis at the\ntime was that government, in particular, had a massive opportunity to save\nmoney and create new efficiencies by shifting their digital processes and\nsoftware stack to the cloud.\n\n### David vs. Goliath\n\nOf course, there was one big problem. Software behemoths like Oracle and SAP\nalready had a dominating presence within the government market. This was a\nreal David vs. Goliath situation, and not many people thought that OpenGov\nwould be able to slay the giant. But I love investing in underdogs\u2014especially\nin underdogs with a clear mission and vision.\n\nThe team at OpenGov, led by CEO Zac Bookman, cares deeply about our country\nand wants to make government more efficient and transparent for everyone. In\nfact, before co-founding OpenGov, Zac served multiple tours of duty as an\nadvisor to U.S. Army General H.R. McMaster on the Anti\u2010Corruption Task Force\nin Kabul, Afghanistan. His commitment to serving our nation and creating a\ncompany to improve government was refreshing to me, especially as a Silicon\nValley investor.\n\n### Power to the people\n\nOpenGov\u2019s vision was bringing best-in-class cloud software to state and local\ngovernment. Their mission was to empower citizens by creating a technology\nplatform that ensured the government was working as it should be.\n\nOne of their early ideas was that the government should be able to publish its\nbudgets in real time so citizens could gain a clearer understanding of, for\nexample, how much their local fire department was spending. The belief was\nthat this kind of transparency could only help to strengthen the government.\nToday, one in three people in the U.S. is benefiting from OpenGov software.\n\nZac turned out to be a fabulous leader. In truth, building this business was\nno easy feat. He and his team had to adapt their product and go-to-market\nstrategy numerous times throughout the journey. They were constantly\ndeveloping and improving their technology based on feedback from their\ncustomers. Zac was a master at navigating the company through all these\nobstacles and setting the tone from the top. He was also great at raising\ncapital and convincing investors that investing in government technology was\nthe right thing to do.\n\n### The perfect partner\n\nCox is the perfect partner for OpenGov at this point in their journey. Zac and\nhis team did a stellar job growing the company, but having a dedicated backer\nlike Cox is essential to taking the business to the next level. Cox has a\nproven track record of investing in mission-driven companies and empowering\nthose organizations to build for long-term impact. I\u2019m confident that Cox will\nserve as an enabler for OpenGov to further accelerate product development and\nadvance its goal of improving communities and empowering citizens.\n\nGoing forward, I firmly believe that digitalization will strengthen the\ngovernment and create even greater transparency for citizens. With this sale,\nOpenGov is in an even stronger position to execute on that worthy mission.\n\n#### Why Cota\n\n  * Approach\n  * Values\n  * Team\n  * Impact Fund\n  * Contact Us\n\n#### Portfolio\n\n  * Current Companies\n  * All Companies\n  * Portfolio Company Careers\n\n#### Knowledge Capital\n\n  * Insights\n\nLinkedin Youtube\n\n#### Cota Newsletter Signup\n\n  * View past newsletter issues\n\n\u00a92024 Cota Capital.
