But the choice is yours.\n\nBut it has no desktop effects!\n\nThere is kwin_wayland, Wayfire and Hyprland for you.\n\nWhat are the requirements for running LXQt 2.0 on wayland?\n\nQt 6.6, kwindowsystem 6.x, layer-shell-qt 6.x.\n\nI need only the panel, the desktop, the runner or the notifications.\n\nLXQt is modular and users can use what they like, but probably you want to use\nlxqt-qtplugin and lxqt-appearance for styling.\n\nI\u2019ve a question which is not yet answered!\n\nOn the side panel here are listed all possibilities to ask them.\n\n# Links\n\nDiscussions\n\n    \n\ngithub.com/lxqt/lxqt/discussions\n\nBug Tracker\n\n    \n\ngithub.com/lxqt/lxqt/issues\n\nWiki\n\n    \n\ngithub.com/lxqt/lxqt\n\nInstant messaging\n\n    \n\n  * Matrix: #lxqt:matrix.org\n  * Telegram: LXQt Project\n  * IRC: #lxqt on OFTC (bridged among them)\n\n  * #lxqt-dev on OFTC\n\nMastodon\n\n    \n\n@LXQt@mastodon.social\n\nTwitter\n\n    \n\nTwitter/lxqt-project\n\nFeed RSS\n\n    \n\nlxqt-project.org/feed.xml\n\n# Downloads\n\n  * GitHub\n\n  * ALT Linux\n\n  * Arch Linux\n\n  * Artix\n\n  * Debian\n\n  * Devuan\n\n  * Endeavouros\n\n  * Fedora\n\n  * FreeBSD\n\n  * Garuda\n\n  * Gentoo\n\n  * NetBSD\n\n  * Mageia\n\n  * Manjaro\n\n  * OpenMandriva\n\n  * ROSA Linux\n\n  * openSUSE\n\n  * Ubuntu\n\n  * Void\n\n# Legal\n\nLXQt is licensed under GNU GPL 2.0+ and GNU LGPL 2.1+. lxqt-project.org is\nlicensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
