This is most clearly measured\nby the long-term drop in the confidence people have in important institutions.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about why this is happening. My preferred theory\natm is it\u2019s a combination of scaling problems \u2014 institutional practices\ninvented in the previous decades and centuries are not scaling well as the\nworld grows larger and more complex. And then the mother of all disruptions,\nthe internet, which changed how humanity senses the world \u2014 which disrupts\nmany of the underlying mechanisms supporting institutions.\n\nBut regardless of why it\u2019s happening \u2014 we have to fix it. Institutions have to\nwork \u2014 history shows over and over that when institutions stop working,\nsociety falls into anarchy and terror.\n\nSo the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\n\nHow are the growing collective of researchers and practitioners around Summer\nof Protocols tackling this issue? They\u2019re trying to create a powerful new way\nof thinking about protocols that\u2019ll uplevel our collective imaginations and\ncapabilities so that we can all iterate faster towards better ways of running\nthe world.\n\n## What are Protocols?\n\nWhat exactly are Protocols? My preferred simple definition for protocols is\nany set of behaviors that make something more likely to happen.\n\nProtocol Theory encompasses a huge range of related topics \u2014 habits, rules,\nlaws, policy, frameworks, software protocols, algorithms, conventions, and\nstandards. So it\u2019s not a new topic \u2014 legal frameworks have existed for 1000s\nof years and religions and philosophers have long provided detailed sets of\nrules for living.\n\nVenkatesh Rao, one of the co-founders of Summer of Protocols, commented on\nthis strangeness of Protocol Theory feeling new despite being very old:\n\n> This is rather odd, if you stop to think about it. Why do protocols feel\n> like an emerging world even though they\u2019re clearly not?\n>\n> Despite its antiquity and size, and despite all the recent drama around\n> modern crypto technologies, the world of protocols is a strangely hidden\n> one. Even though there are hundreds of millions of people around the world\n> who explicitly organize their work and thinking around protocols of various\n> sorts, the language of protocols is not a familiar one. It is easier to look\n> through protocols than at them. It is easier to act through protocols than\n> on them. It is easier to systematize an emergent local practice into a\n> bespoke local protocol than to think about the general features of all\n> protocols.\n\nProtocols again aren\u2019t new. They just haven\u2019t been important enough in the\npast to emerge as their own field. As Venkat puts it, \u201cprotocols are evolving\nfrom an artisan craft to an engineering and art domain.\u201d\n\n## See the Protocols\n\nProtocols thoroughly permeate our lives. There are 100s of protocols embedded\nin the walls of our homes. We follow dozens throughout our day-to-day lives\nfrom brushing our teeth to which side of the road we drive.\n\nBut like the famous \u201chow\u2019s the water?\u201d fish story \u2014 for most of us, if someone\nasked \u201chow\u2019s your protocols?\u201d we\u2019d also respond \u201cwhat the hell is a protocol?\u201d\n\nTo successfully adapt our institutions, many of us are going to need to get a\nlot more comfortable at seeing the \u201cwater\u201d of protocols that surround us.\n\nIt\u2019s common for individuals or organizations to figure out how to get good\noutcomes but often the protocols that led to those good outcomes don\u2019t spread\nbeyond the initial innovators \u2014 often because the original people involved\ndon\u2019t fully understand the protocols they created!\n\nThe world is full of \u201cjust-so stories\u201d about why or why not someone or a group\nwas successful. Protocol Theory can help us tease out the underlying protocols\nand sources of hardness that led to the success and help these protocols\nreproduce much more readily elsewhere.\n\n## Engineer the Protocols\n\nProtocols Theory is the CAD software, CNC machines, jigs, dies and molds,\nassembly lines, and quality control for mass manufacturing good outcomes.\n\nThere needs to be tens of thousands of skilled protocol engineers and\nmachinists designing and building the new protocols for the new world we find\nourselves in.\n\nGiven that an institution is just a big set of nested protocols, how can they\nlearn to experiment faster around new hardness/protocol ideas, correctly\nidentify improved protocols (avoiding capture by bad actors), and help their\nconstituents migrate?\n\nThis seems like the most important question of our time, can our institutions\nsuccessfully evolve to meet the conditions and problems of today? The answer\nto this question will determine how pleasant (or otherwise) the next 100 years\nwill be. Hopefully the next 40 years will see a steady upward trend in the\naverage confidence in major institutions.\n\n## A Protocol Age\n\nJosh Stark compared Protocol Theory to Information Theory in his essay Atoms,\nInstitutions, Blockchains. Not until Claude Shannon published his Information\nTheory in 1946, did the now common abstraction of \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cdata\u201d\nexist.\n\nInformation Theory created a powerful new way of seeing the world as discrete\ninformation which is stored, transmitted, and processed. This new perspective\nhelped inspire a whole generation of technologists to imagine and successfully\ninvent technologies like the CPU, fiber optics, and the internet. Information\nTheory led to the Information Age.\n\nPerhaps Protocol Theory is also laying the foundation for a coming Protocol\nAge?\n\nSubscribe to get updated on new posts!\n\nKyle Mathews lives and works in Seattle building useful things.
