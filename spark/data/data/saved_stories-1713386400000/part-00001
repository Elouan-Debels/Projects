Those will be officially supported by OpenWrt developers with assistance\nfrom MediaTek.\n\nAnnounced in January 2024, we only had the specifications of the OpenWrt One\nrouter so far, but since the first samples are now available we have more\ndetails including several photos of the board, and some units will be\nauctioned away at the OpenWrt Summit taken place in Cyprus on May 18-19.\n\nJohn explains fifteen prototypes will be manufactured, a website will be set\nup (maybe openwrt dot one), and that MediaTek helped with documentation:\n\n> Just dropping a quick update on the OpenWrt One project. I\u2019ve received the\n> first batch of three PCBs for testing today. I am in the process of testing\n> the hardware to make sure everything works as intended. There are twelve\n> further early prototype boards on standby in case we need to tweak anything\n> hardware-wise...\n>\n> Work is underway to establish a website where all legal information and\n> links to our sources will be provided. Keeping everything transparent and\n> accessible is crucial for us. MediaTek also generously released a\n> substantial amount of programming manuals for the SoC used by the OpenWrt\n> One which will be made available shortly.\n\nHere\u2019s a reminder of the OpenWrt One router specifications:\n\n  * SoC \u2013 MediaTek MT7981B (Filogic 820) dual-core Cortex-A53 processor @ 1.3 GHz\n  * System Memory \u2013 1GB DDR4\n  * Storage\n\n    * 128 MB SPI NAND flash for U-boot and Linux\n    * 4 MB SPI NOR flash for write-protected (by default) recovery bootloader (reflashing can be enabled with a jumper)\n    * Two types of flash devices are used to make the board almost unbrickable\n    * M.2 2242/2230 socket for NVMe SSD (PCIe gen 2 x1)\n  * Networking\n\n    * 2.5GbE RJ45 port\n    * Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 port\n    * Dual-band WiFI 6 via MediaTek MT7976C (2\u00d72 2.4 GHz + 3\u00d73/2\u00d72 + zero-wait DFS 5Ghz)\n    * 3x MMCX antenna connectors\n  * USB\n\n    * 1x USB 2.0 Type-A host port\n    * USB Type-C (device, console) port using Holtek HT42B534-2 UART to USB chip\n  * Expansion \u2013 MikroBUS socket for expansion modules\n  * Debugging \u2013 Console via USB-C port or 3-pin header, 10-pin JTAG/SWD header for main SoC\n  * Misc\n\n    * Reset and User buttons\n    * Boot select switch: NAND (regular) or NOR (recovery)\n    * 2x PWM LEDs, 2x Ethernet LED (GPIO driven)\n    * EM6324 External hardware watchdog\n    * NXP PCF8563TS (I2C) RTC with battery backup holder for CR1220 coin-cell\n  * Power Supply\n\n    * 12V USB-PD on USB-C port (might have changed to up to 15V)\n    * Optional 802.3at/af PoE via RT5040 module\n  * Dimensions \u2013 148 x 100.5 mm compatible with Banana Pi BPI-R4 case design\n  * Certifications \u2013 FCC/EC/RoHS compliance\n\nThere\u2019s still no information about mass production and general availability,\nbut at least one or two samples will be given away during the OpenWrt Summit\naccording to a discussion thread started by Ar\u0131n\u00e7 \u00dcNAL on April 10. John\nfurther added that the 15 EVT samples mentioned have already been tested, and\na new production run of 100 DVT samples would start shortly. These 100 samples\nwill have OpenWrt OUI macs and calibration data, and the winners of the\nauction will receive samples via express courier (as opposed to being given at\nthe OpenWrt Summit).\n\nJean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)\n\nJean-Luc started CNX Software in 2010 as a part-time endeavor, before quitting\nhis job as a software engineering manager, and starting to write daily news,\nand reviews full time later in 2011.\n\nShare this:\n\nFacebookTwitterHacker\nNewsSlashdotRedditLinkedInPinterestFlipboardMeWeLineEmailShare\n\nSupport CNX Software!

It\u2019ll have to be the bpi-r3 or r4\neven if they risk being janky.\n\nReply\n\n## Trending Posts - Last 7 Days\n\n  * ODROID-H4 \u2013 A Compact Alder Lake N-Series SBC with up to dual 2.5GbE and four SATA III ports 5.3k views | 23 comments\n  * ESP32-H4 low-power dual-core RISC-V SoC supports 802.15.4 and Bluetooth 5.4 LE 5.2k views | 11 comments\n  * Orange Pi 5 Pro \u2013 A low-cost Rockchip RK3588S SBC with up to 16GB LPDDR5 RAM, dual HDMI video output 4.3k views | 21 comments\n  * Radxa NIO 12L \u2013 A low-profile MediaTek Genio 1200 SBC with Ubuntu certification for at least 5 years of updates 3.3k views | 2 comments\n  * Raspberry Pi at Embedded World 2024: AI camera, M.2 HAT+ M Key board, and 15.6-inch monitor 2.8k views | 0 comments\n\nSubscribe to Comments RSS Feed\n\n## SPONSORS\n\n## Recent Comments\n\n## Latest Reviews\n\nChange Ad Consent Do not sell my data\n\nCopyright 2010-2024 - CNX Software Limited\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.
