(You can imagine how that\nwent.) Years later, we learned the importance of set and setting \u2013 one\u2019s\nmindset, and one\u2019s environment \u2013 and how they influence the nature of highly\nsubjective experiences.\n\nLast year, as I prepared for my own momentous event \u2013 unmedicated childbirth \u2013\nI was surprised to learn that giving birth operates similarly, even though we\ndon\u2019t talk about it that way. Psychology strongly influences physicality: when\nwe are afraid, our bodies seize up, and birth slows down. When we are calm,\nour bodies relax, and birth can progress smoothly.\n\nThese observations seem obvious now that I\u2019ve been through it, but at the\ntime, this was news to me. Because birth manifests so clearly in the body, I\nhad assumed it was something that happened to me \u2013 like getting the flu, or\narthritis \u2013 rather than something could be influenced, to some degree, by my\nmind. (By contrast, positive thinking has only a marginal impact on illness or\ndegenerative disease.)\n\nIn researching birth, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the parallels with\npsychedelics. Both these \u201cexotic states of consciousness,\u201d as the Qualia\nResearch Institute might call them, suggest that there are still vast oceans\nto explore inside our brains, which influence not just fuzzy, hard-to-measure\nthings like mood or motivation, but in some cases \u2013 as with birth \u2013 vastly\ndifferent medical outcomes.\n\nAround the same time, I took fresh notice of growing Twitter chatter about the\njhanas, a series of eight altered states of consciousness that are accessed\nvia a special form of meditation. Practitioners claim that they can enter\nblissful, euphoric states that are comparable to MDMA or psychedelics \u2013\nwithout the use of substances.\n\nLike many others, I thought these these claims were interesting, but likely\nexaggerated. But my recent learnings tugged at me. It took decades for\nresearchers to understand how psychedelics worked: to differentiate them from\nchemically-induced psychosis, to identify that they had therapeutic benefits,\nand to be able to discuss them openly. And, despite its many advancements, the\nUnited States medical establishment still treats childbirth \u2013 a phenomenon\nthat occurs thousands of times per day \u2013 as a purely physical, rather than\npsychological, experience. So...why not the jhanas?\n\nWhen Asterisk magazine approached me about contributing a piece to their\nupcoming issue, I decided to use the opportunity to understand what the jhanas\nwere about. I expected to write a piece that was a more anthropological,\nobserved account of a strange Twitter subculture. I did, in fact, write that\npiece, and initially submitted it to my editors. But in the course of my\nresearch, I met Stephen Zerfas, who co-founded a company, Jhourney, that aims\nto teach the jhanas to novices. Stephen invited me to one of their upcoming\nretreats, which, after much deliberation, I agreed to attend.\n\nI am not a meditator. (Even after experiencing the jhanas, I still have no\ndesire to develop a meditation practice.) Nor am I a \u201cspiritual seeker\u201d of the\nsort you might find at Burning Man or a Vipassana retreat. Despite my lack of\nexperience, within my first hour of practice, I found myself in the equivalent\nof an MDMA roll. With ten hours of practice, I had an out-of-body experience.\nLess than fifteen hours, a psychedelic experience that rivaled what might be\nhad on LSD. All of this took place using only concentration.\n\nIf you\u2019re raising an eyebrow right now, I must once again stress that I, too,\ndid not believe this was a thing. I arrived at the retreat feeling rather\nsilly for being there. I left astonished, and perplexed, as to why barely\nanyone has studied the jhanas at all. Public accounts of jhanic experiences\nare widely dismissed or snickered at by skeptics. I\u2019ve found only three\nnotable academic studies about the jhanas that were published in the last ten\nyears. These studies used fMRI and EEG data to examine whether the phenomenon\nwas real \u2013 and they did, in fact, find that their subjects displayed unusual\nbrain activity, comparable to being asleep or in a coma while conscious \u2013 but\nconspicuously missing still is the secular language needed to describe how the\njhanas work, how they are accessed deterministically, and their impact on\npractitioners\u2019 minds. Strangest to me, as an outsider, is that the jhanas are\nstill firmly lodged in meditation circles and norms, rather than studied as a\nform of behavioral therapy.\n\nI am less interested in making the argument that everyone should try the\njhanas. But it seems to me that if people can access these experiences with\nrelatively little mental effort \u2013 and to do so legally, for free \u2013 more ought\nto know that such a thing exists. At the very least, shouldn\u2019t there be more\nthan three published studies about it?\n\nIf anything I\u2019ve said so far has caught your attention, then I\u2019d love for you\nto check out the piece I published in Asterisk today. I think it\u2019s a good\nprimer on the jhanas and their history, as well as a narrative account of my\nexperience at the retreat.\n\nRead it now\n\nFinally, if you\u2019ve followed my work for awhile, you know I love a good\nunexplored landscape, and \u2013 against all odds \u2013 the jhanas have grabbed my\nattention like a dog with a bone. If they\u2019re interesting to you as well, I\u2019d\nlove to talk about it, particularly from a qualitative research and\nstorytelling perspective.
