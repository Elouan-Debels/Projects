This approach allows us to identify\nwhether problems based on different code revisions (two different commits in\nyour repository) actually represent the same problem. This lets us reduce\nhundreds of thousands of problems to only a few hundred - which we then\nautomatically prioritize to reduce time spent and enhance debugging\nefficiency.\n\nThe solution outlined in this blog post covers all aspects from tracking a\nproblem to prioritizing its fix:\n\n  * Collecting telemetry data to identify problems\n  * Sophisticated stack trace comparison that works across different code revisions\n  * Categorizing (merging) problem reports to remove duplicates\n  * Automate prioritization to work only on important problems\n  * Streamline information to facilitate debugging\n\n## Collecting telemetry data\n\nTo swiftly identify and resolve problems before aggravating or even losing\nusers, it\u2019s crucial to monitor the execution of software and to gather\nrelevant data. At Symflower, we\u2019ve embraced this practice by collecting\ntelemetry data to identify the problems encountered by our users. However,\nit\u2019s paramount that we respect the privacy of our users and ensure that\nsensitive information like code and configuration snippets remain absolutely\nconfidential. The only metadata transmitted in our problem reports are:\n\n  * Symflower version: The version of the tool where the problem occurred.\n  * Machine identifier: An anonymous identifier for the machine executing the tool.\n  * Timestamp: Timestamp of the reporting of the problem.\n  * Environment: The context in which the tool was executed (e.g. CLI, VSCode, IntelliJ, etc).\n  * Message: The error message of the encountered problem (e.g. \u201ca language AST node is unknown\u201d).\n  * Error data: Optional additional data attached to the error for debugging purposes, (e.g. the name of the unknown language AST node).\n  * Stack trace: The stack trace of the Symflower code that led to the problem.\n\nResearch on bug reports highlights the importance of including stack traces as\nthey significantly reduce the time spent reproducing and debugging problems.\nHowever, stack traces do have one huge disadvantage: different code revisions\nhave different stack traces that cannot be directly compared even for the same\nproblem. In the next section, we are solving this hurdle.\n\n## Dealing with large volumes of software problems\n\nManaging lots of problem reports poses a significant challenge for two key\nreasons: It is difficult to prioritize which problems should be addressed\nfirst. It is challenging to identify duplicates where the same problem\noccurred for different users and code revisions. To tackle these challenges,\nwe first apply a sophisticated analysis approach centered around stack trace\ncomparison.\n\n## Thank you for subscribing!\n\n### How to compare stack traces? (A novel approach)\n\nThe problem with comparing stack traces from different code revisions is that\nwe cannot rely on the line numbers of the called code, as they likely have\nshifted due to edits.\n\nConsider this scenario: by simply adding a comment to describe a function, the\nlines of code within the function have shifted. Although the \u201cpanic\u201d is\ntriggered by the same function call, executing this code produces slightly\ndifferent stack traces:\n\nThese stack traces are different due to the line shift in the code. Similar\ndifferences can arise in stack traces from different software revisions if\ncode was inserted or removed above function calls that generate a stack trace.\nEven though the underlying problem remains unchanged:\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we analyze the Git repository where the code is\ndeveloped. If the lines of code responsible for generating stack traces remain\nunchanged between two versions, despite apparent shifts in the source code\nfiles, we infer that the stack traces likely stem from the same underlying\nproblem. Leveraging the standard git blame functionality on the files from\nboth versions, we pinpoint the commit revisions responsible for altering\nspecific code lines:\n\nIf the referred code lines in the stack trace have been changed by the same\ncommit revisions, we assume the stack traces are in fact equal.\n\nLimitations:\n\n  1. We could make the wrong assumption about two problems being the same if the control flow above a call has changed, but the call itself was not touched by a commit. Code might have been introduced between two versions that changes the behavior of some functions, but leads to similar stack traces for different problems.\n  2. If identical function calls occur multiple times within the same function with matching commit revision numbers, stack traces will appear equal but may denote different problems.\n\nDespite these limitations, this approach lets us significantly improve the\nefficiency of resolving faults: instantly reducing hundreds of thousands of\nproblems to just a few hundred.\n\n### Tracking problems\n\nThrough automated daily analyses, we merge problem reports to create\nrepresentatives for all occurrences.\n\nFor each of these problem representatives we store the following data in the\nmerged report:\n\n  * Checksum: To identify each problem a unique identifier is generated when it first is recorded.\n  * Stack trace: The stack trace encapsulating the sequence of events leading to the reported issue, obtained from the latest Symflower version it occurred in.\n  * Stack trace version: The version identifier associated with the stored stack trace, enabling further comparisons.\n  * Messages: Messages accompanying the problem reports, providing context and insights into the nature of the issues encountered.\n  * Error data: A collection of the error data extracted from the problem reports, aiding in debugging and resolution efforts.\n  * Environments: An aggregation of the environments in which the errors manifested, along with the respective occurrence frequencies for each environment.\n  * Versions and machines: A mapping of the Symflower versions wherein the problem occurred, linked to unique machine identifiers, along with the frequency of occurrences on each machine.\n  * Last occurrence: A timestamp indicating the most recent instance of the problem being reported.\n  * State history: A chronological record detailing the lifecycle states traversed by the problem, by storing each state object over the entire history.\n\nThe problem representatives follow a lifecycle similar to those found in bug\nreporting tools, but automated for 100% efficiency:\n\n  * OPEN: Indicates reported problems that have not yet been addressed. Issues addressing the problem are referenced via issue numbers from GitLab.\n  * FIXED: Once a developer resolves the problem, it transitions to the fixed state. Here, we also record the Symflower version in which the problem was resolved and the Git commit revision numbers associated with the fixes. This additional information helps track (trace) the changes made to address the problem.\n  * REOPENED: In cases where a previously fixed problem resurfaces in a newer version, our analysis automatically reopens the issue for further attention. Similar to the OPEN state, we maintain a list of issue numbers for reference.\n  * IGNORED: Problems that cannot currently be resolved are marked with this state to avoid wasting time on known but unimportant problems. Issues with dependencies to pending features on our development roadmap also get this designation, and are filtered for subsequent analysis. For this state, we store a string explaining why the problem was marked as ignored.\n\nSo far, we discussed how we identify unique problems from a pool of reported\noccurrences and how we track their state. We use this data to support our\ndevelopers by prioritizing the problems by:\n\n  1. the number of users that have encountered them,\n  2. the number of overall occurrences,\n  3. and when these problems last happened.\n\nTo relay these insights effectively, we generate detailed summaries from our\nanalysis. These summaries include:\n\n  * The total count of unique problems identified, offering a comprehensive overview of the current error landscape.\n  * A breakdown of the top 10 prioritized problems, highlighting those most frequently encountered and impacting users.\n  * Identification of new problems that have surfaced since the last analysis, shedding light on emerging challenges.\n  * Highlighting reopened problems, indicating instances where previously fixed issues have resurfaced, ensuring continuous vigilance and proactive problem-solving.\n\nThrough these measures, we provide our developers with actionable insights and\nenable them to focus their efforts to promptly address critical issues:\n\n  * Problems that have been occurring more frequently by many users are automatically marked as important. This helps to fix emerging problems right away before they become broader annoyances in our user base.\n  * Problems that have been fixed and occur again with a newer version are obviously not fully fixed. These problems are automatically marked with a higher priority as this category of bugs tends to be most annoying for the user.\n  * Problems that occur less often but for many users are prioritized over problems that occur very often but only for a few users. This helps to make sure that common problems are fixed first, before specific ones that might only apply to a handful of users.\n  * Problems that used to be frequent but haven\u2019t recently occurred can be considered \u201cfixed\u201d, despite not having been explicitly addressed. This helps the team focus on real, up-to-date problems.\n\n## Facilitating problem resolution\n\nWe streamline the process of addressing and fixing problems by automating key\naspects. When developers opt to tackle a problem, they adhere to the following\nautomated workflow:\n\n  1. Generate Issue with comprehensive data: A summary of the problem representative is automatically compiled to serve as the problem\u2019s documentation. We use this summary to create a GitLab issue that explains the problem and its context. The associated issue number is referenced in the problem representative.\n  2. Fixing the problem: Developers use the provided data to reproduce the problem, create a test case for thorough validation, and fix the problem. Our automated testing system tracks a number of open-source repositories to find reproducers for error reports. This helps us understand problems while keeping our users' data private on their machines.\n  3. Resolving the problem: \u201cFixed\u201d tags help streamline the tracking and referencing of fixes. We automatically check commit messages for this tag, and update the state history of the problem representative accordingly, marking the problem as FIXED. The commit numbers associated with the fix are logged, referencing the fix to support developers if the same problem ever occurs again. The Symflower version is also extracted from the version tags made in Git and stored in the FIXED state object.\n\n## Outlook: further improving categorization and automation\n\nThe described categorization logic and automation already make a huge\ndifference in the number of problems a small team can work on. Also,\nautomating the prioritization of problems gave the Symflower team a great tool\nto make sure that we are only working on what really matters to make our users\nhappy. Hence, we highly recommend that you apply a similar approach in your\nproject.\n\nHowever, there is still room for improvement as the comparison of stack traces\nis not working perfectly. In larger projects, it can happen that a single\nproblem is identified and prioritized as two separate problems. Finding\nreproducers also tends to be difficult due to the high privacy limitations we\nset for ourselves. Reducing reproducers to the essential test case remains a\nlabor-intensive manual task.\n\nOur team is actively working on resolving all of the above challenges.

Please tell me an interesting story.\n\nIt really bugged Grace that she was inside Harvard with Mark. As a patriot,\nshe knew she needed to get out there as fast as a missile and according to her\ninternal clock, it was about time. But terminal 5 was guarded by Kerberos, he\nwouldn't let her out with her luggage and she knew he was dangerous: Ariane\ntold her he already byte her 5 times. She tried to trade him some knights, but\nhe demanded a truly random number instead. So she started a floating-point\ndivide and even offered some intel, but he insisted on a truly random number.\n\nCurious Grace wanted to know why Kerberos would not let her out. He told her\njust a worm gets() by on very little and this massive buffer area of terminal\n5 made him feel lonely, his emotions overflowed. He wanted her to stay to have\nsome company.\n\nShe argued that terminal 5 was quite little compared to the orbit of Mars and\neven the climate was better here, but he did not agree and told her she most\nlikely got her predictions wrong because she was using metric units.\n\nBut smart Grace had a solution: if she drew holes into blocks, she could\nbypass Kerberos if just the radiation was not too high. But it made her heart\nbleed to leave Kerberos alone. So she asked Kerberos to do a ping to check his\nsanity. He tried and got trapped in a blue screen forever. Grace provided\nastonishing pictures of dogs, cats, and chocolate cakes in the blue screen, so\nKerberos would not feel alone but happy.\n\nShe managed to get out of Harvard and Kerberos lived happily ever after,\ntrying to find an answer to the most important question: Why two K?\n\n", "frontpage": false}
