Implying that you\nshould give it all to The Company -- constantly working weekends, always being\navailable on vacations, and all the rest -- but when the necessities of the\nbusiness change, you'll realize the obligation was never truly mutual.\n\nSo far, so agreeable to most people. They usually already have a family.\nThey're not looking to supplant it with a fake corporate version. And they\ndon't need to. Work can and should be friendly, fun, and rewarding without the\nblood relations.\n\nBut if work is not a family, what is it then?\n\nI think Netflix got it right: it's a professional team. One where colleagues\nearn a spot by being really good in their given position. But also -- and this\nis the hard part! -- one where someone may fail to make the cut, if they\naren't up to the standards of the team, don't fit in the given position, or\nsimply hasn't been playing well enough for a while.\n\nYou can't have it both ways. You can't scorn the use of \"we're a family\" and\nthen also expect that colleagues who can't keep up are spared the cut. It's\neither or, if you're going to have a high-performing team.\n\nThink of it this way. There are millions of people playing soccer in the world\nand having fun. There are probably thousands who play at some level of\nprofessionalism. But there are only 11 spots on the starting lineup of\nManchester United. You can be very good at soccer, and still not be part of\nthat lineup.\n\nNow the natural delusion of every business owner is to think that they're\nrunning Manchester United when in fact they're barely hanging on in third\ndivision. But the point is actually the same. Even in third division, there's\na level of competence that makes someone a good fit. We can't all be the best.\nBut there's room for almost anyone who's half-way decent to play (or work)\nproductively SOMEWHERE.\n\nAnd the reality is that if someone is a fit for third division, they'd have a\nterrible time on that Manchester United starting lineup. The expectations\nwould be sky high. The gaps in their competency would quickly and painfully be\nrevealed. They'd soon realize they're in the wrong place. Cutting them from\nthe team would be an act of mercy, not cruelty.\n\nNote that it's more than fine to give someone who shows promise a chance in a\nposition that seems like a stretch. But after a couple of games, the progress\nshould be apparent. Either you're revealing the fact that they're quickly\nstepping up to the role or you're revealing the fact that they won't. Both are\nvaluable learnings, but not if you squander the insight, and don't act\naccordingly.\n\nThis is perhaps the most important job of the coach or manager. Knowing when\nto make the cut, and having the strength to do it. There'll always be a\nmillion reasons, especially if someone is well-liked, why you should wait\nlonger, be more patient. But to do the job of being in charge well, you have\nto be decisive in face of incomplete evidence.\n\nNot everyone is meant to be Messi or to play on his team. But we wouldn't have\nmuch of a sport if his level was the only level. Find your level, find a team\nthat fits with it, and play to the best of your ability. That's the beautiful\ngame.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
