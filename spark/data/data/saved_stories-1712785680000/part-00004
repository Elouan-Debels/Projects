Despite a protracted hunger strike and 317 days\nisolated in a cell, Jacob\u2019s prison sentence of forty-one months for\nobstruction of an official proceeding on January 6, 2021, had been shortened\nowing to good behavior, and he was let out about a year early on supervised\nrelease.\n\nIt took some doing to get him to sit for an interview, as Jacob is wary of\nwhat he calls Operation Mockingbird, an alleged CIA-sponsored effort begun in\nthe Fifties to use mass media to influence public opinion. Jacob believes that\npeople like me are the tools of the Mockingbird operation, of the deep state,\ninternational bankers, pharmaceutical cartels, and corporate monarchies that\ncontrol the world. People like me believe in medicines that are addictive\ndrugs, in food that is poison, in environmentalism that is ecocide, in\neducation that is ignorance, in money that is debt, in objective science that\nis not objective. \u201cPeople are brainwashed by the elites and their propaganda\nnetworks,\u201d he said. \u201cMass hypnosis, bro.\u201d\n\nHe had agreed to meet with me on a number of conditions, including:\n\n1\\. That I mention Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, the American inventor of an\noscillating beam-ray medical technology that, according to Jacob, is a cure\nfor cancer that has been quashed by the government, the military, and\npharmaceutical giants; and\n\n2\\. That I call attention to the existence of a clean, free, wireless, and\nrenewable energy source powered by the earth\u2019s magnetic field that was\ndiscovered by Nikola Tesla but suppressed by the government because such a\ntechnology would make the existing energy grid obsolete, and thus threaten the\nrule of the globalists and their corporate monopolies.\n\nJacob believes he has been sent to earth to combat wicked forces such as\nWarner Bros. and MGM. He believes in the clear and present danger of a global\nring of slave-trading, adrenochrome-swigging Clintonistas. He would also like\nto lift the ban on psilocybin mushrooms. And he\u2019s been doing the work for a\nlong time\u2014for \u201cmillennia,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have reincarnated on this planet\nnumerous times throughout the ages.\u201d\n\nJacob is as apt to paraphrase Shirley MacLaine as WikiLeaks Vault 7 or Alex\nJones, which is why I had reached out to him. He is Exhibit A of the widely\nreported observation that MAGA, QAnon, and the broader conspiratorial mishmash\ndraw substantial support from the consciousness-raising, om-chanting, sound-\nhealing, joint-toking, crystal- and chart-reading crowd, the long-haired\nhippies who half a century ago were lumped together with the fellow travelers\nof the left, but have been reincarnated two generations later as pivotal\nelements of the Trump coalition. Jacob and his cosmic vibrations epitomize\nthat political reversal. Perhaps, I thought, there was something in his belief\nsystem that could explain how the self-evident truths that guided the\nfoundation of American democracy had lost their way in the wilderness.\n\nI figured the tattoos would be a good place to start. As he was perusing\nPicazzo\u2019s menu, I mentioned the marks on the backs of his hands. They were\nplanets, pyramids, and runes, he said\u2014the alphabets native to early Germanic\nand Norse peoples. The massive dark blots on his shoulder took six and a half\nhours. \u201cMy reality\u2014what I thought was reality\u2014was ripping at the seams right\nin front of my closed eyelids,\u201d he said, recalling the ordeal. \u201cI was seeing\nthe quantum particles.\u201d\n\nHe was also tripping on mushrooms.\n\nThor\u2019s hammer he mostly did himself. \u201cIt would have looked a lot better,\u201d he\ntold me, \u201cbut I got locked up.\u201d The tattoos on his shoulder, Jacob said,\n\u201crepresent manhood.\u201d\n\nThe bricks that adorn his arms are a result of his dad having introduced him\nto the psychedelic space-rock band Pink Floyd and their wildly successful\nstoner opera The Wall, which tells the story of a fatherless musician who can\nperform onstage only after a drug injection leads him to believe he is a\nfascist dictator. (Roger Waters, mastermind of the production, has\ndemonstrated his own penchant for parading around onstage in Nazi-style\nregalia, flanked by men dressed like storm troopers.) Jacob explained that the\nwall of bricks was a means of \u201chealing from all the mental and emotional pain\nof growing up with an alcoholic dad who I loved very much and I know loved\nme.\u201d\n\nHis biological father spent most of Jacob\u2019s youth in jail and played no role\nas a parent. His stepfather, whom he calls his dad, committed suicide.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche once said that \u201cwhen one has not had a good father, one\nmust create one.\u201d Carl Jung ratified the idea of the fantasy father in 1919,\nwhen he labeled the concept an \u201carchetype,\u201d by which he meant a mental\ncompendium of mythic, legendary, and fairy-tale fathers all wrapped up into\none enormous daddy issue.\n\nJacob, who was born in 1987, came of age in the wake of Robert Bly\u2019s Iron\nJohn, a book published in 1990 about modern man\u2019s alienation from heroic male\narchetypes that spent sixty-two weeks on the New York Times bestseller list\nand was a seminal work of the mythopoetic men\u2019s movement. Like Jacob, Bly\nserved in the Navy. Like Jacob, Bly\u2019s father was an alcoholic. Like Jacob, Bly\nwas interested in Old Norse mythology\u2014in particular, the epic tales of the\nprincipal Norse god Odin, who, in order to gain mystical knowledge, subjected\nhimself to nine days and nights of torture. He lanced himself with a spear and\nhung upside down from Yggdrasil, the cosmic tree that connects the nine realms\nof the universe, a tattoo of which lies over Jacob\u2019s heart.\n\nIn the era of Iron John, \u201cmanosphere\u201d membership required bongos, sweat\nlodges, hugging, weeping, and throwing spears at boars. Today, it\u2019s about\ngetting buff, buying liver-enzyme pills online, and keeping a paleo diet.\nStill, Bly resonates throughout the language and philosophy of Jordan\nPeterson, Joe Rogan, Tony Robbins, Andrew Tate, Josh Hawley, and other\nprophets of the modern men\u2019s-rights movement.\n\nIn 2018, under the pseudonym Loan Wolf, Jacob self-published his own version\nof Iron John, called Will & Power: Inside the Living Library, whose hero\nretreats to the wilderness and stumbles upon an alien from the planet Ularu\nwho looks like a hairy Sasquatch, has telepathic powers, and does a lot of\nyoga. This steely \u00dcbermensch goes by the name E-Su and teaches the hero to\nbattle the corruptions of the world. We discussed the novel\u2019s scenes of\nviolence, and Jacob told me that there had been many powerful ancestors in his\nbloodline, and that in each of his thousands of previous lives, he and they\nhad fought the good fight.\n\nI nodded, and we sat in silence for a while. A waiter appeared, smiling in a\nvague, embarrassed sort of way. He seemed to have recognized Jacob and was\nready to stand at attention.\n\nBut The Shaman\u2019s thoughts had roamed far from the realm of gluten-free food.\n\u201cThe most evil things happen when a person believes that they are anonymous,\nwhen they\u2019ve covered their face,\u201d he mused after some time. \u201cWhether it be\nwith war paint, or whether it be with a mask.\u201d Which struck me as odd, because\nat the Capitol on January 6, Jacob had painted his face. He had covered his\nhead with a coyote-tail headdress and topped it off with buffalo horns.\nHolding his staff and megaphone, he sat his ass down in the presiding\nofficer\u2019s chair.\n\nNow he looked me square in the eye.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re paying, right?\u201d\n\nFor the record, The Shaman ordered his pizza topped with artichoke hearts,\nbasil, chicken, and mushrooms.\n\nIn court, Jacob\u2019s lawyer told the judge that his client would not kill an\ninsect, that he was picked on as a child and bullied as a teenager. After high\nschool, he joined the Navy and found himself aboard the aircraft carrier USS\nKitty Hawk, a floating apocalypse-in-waiting, bristling with surface-to-air\nmissiles, Super Hornet fighter jets, Prowler radar jammers, and Seahawk\nhelicopters. It was the same ship aboard which John Frankenheimer filmed\nscenes for Seven Days in May, the 1964 black-and-white classic in which Kirk\nDouglas plays Colonel \u201cJiggs\u201d Casey, who uncovers a plot against the United\nStates government masterminded by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nIt was the first movie of its kind, ushering in what became a standard in\nHollywood thrillers after the Kennedy assassination: the deep state\nconspiracy.\n\nAbout six months into his assignment, the ship psychologist diagnosed him with\nschizotypal personality disorder, an incurable condition characterized by\nsocial isolation, limited reactions to social cues, and sometimes a penchant\nto dress unusually. He received what the military calls a \u201cgeneral discharge,\nunder honorable conditions,\u201d in 2007, and returned to his mother\u2019s house in\nPhoenix.\n\nThe living room here has an ornamental equine vibe\u2014lit by a horse lamp, wall\nadorned with images of horses\u2014except for the bookshelf, where what might have\nbeen a cowboy hat has been replaced by a Trump hat. Martha Chansley doesn\u2019t\nsubscribe to cable television. She believes that the buffalo is a \u201cmystic\u201d\nanimal. When a reporter and camera crew from FOX 10 Phoenix descended on her\nhouse after her son had been taken into custody, she noted another mystical\nbond, this one with Donald Trump: \u201cWe are a part of him, and he is a part of\nus.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mom was always kinda into woo-woo,\u201d Jacob admitted.\n\nAfter being discharged from the Navy, he remembered how he had once happened\nupon a CD in his mother\u2019s car. The plastic case showed a bald and bearded\nhippie who had been dismissed from his psychology assistant professorship at\nHarvard because of his research on psychedelic drug therapies.\n\n\u201cI was like\u2014oh, okay, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\nWhat The Shaman had stumbled across was a set of lectures given by Timothy\nLeary\u2019s colleague Richard Alpert. Four years after his dismissal from Harvard,\nAlpert had traveled to India and changed his name to Baba Ram Dass. Four years\nafter that, he published a book called Be Here Now, which sold two million\ncopies and became a counterculture bible for Steve Jobs, Wayne Dyer, and\nGeorge Harrison.\n\n\u201cI was awestruck,\u201d Jacob said.\n\nThe Ram Dass lectures took their place in his library of unorthodox thinkers,\nwhich had long embraced Ralph Abraham, a professor of mathematics at UC Santa\nCruz, who was not only an expert on chaos theory and psychedelic shamanism but\nhad spent a good deal of time living in a cave in the Himalayas. Abraham\ncredited his use of the psychedelic drug DMT with his ability to see the\nconnection between numbers and Logos.\n\nJacob discovered Terence McKenna, widely regarded as the \u201cintellectual voice\nof rave culture.\u201d McKenna was an ethnobotanist and mystic who read Carl Jung\nat the age of fourteen and later recorded hundreds of hours of lectures on\ntopics that range from transhumanism to the so-called stoned ape theory of\nhuman evolution, which posits that one hundred thousand years ago Homo erectus\nbecame Homo sapiens by eating magic mushrooms.\n\nJacob also became enthralled by the man often called the \u201cGodfather of the New\nAge,\u201d Carlos Castaneda, who wrote about a shaman named Don Juan who ate\npeyote, talked to coyotes, and could enter \u201ca separate reality.\u201d As Castaneda\ncontinued writing, however, ultimately publishing a dozen books and selling\nmany millions of copies, scholars reached a consensus that he had made the\nwhole thing up. Don Juan was fake news.\n\nBut even if the accusations against Castaneda about Don Juan were true,\ncontended Jacob\u2014\u201cthat he\u2019s not really a brujo, not really a sorcerer or a\nshaman, or that Don Juan\u2019s not real\u2014does that change the truth?\u201d\n\nI said nothing. The Shaman sipped his ice water.\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d he continued, \u201cif I were to tell you all of the stories, all of the\nparanormal experiences that I\u2019ve had, the UFOs that I\u2019ve seen, the strange\nsynchronicities\u2014you know, Carl Jung synchronicities, the strange\nsynchronicities that are of a divine nature very similar to divine\nprovidence\u2014we\u2019d be here for hours.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, we did sit there for hours. As Jacob had tweeted several\nweeks earlier:\n\n> The ether is filled with ideas! Ideas which are frequencies of energy that\n> exist within the larger fractal sacred geometric pattern called the Unified\n> Field or God, Carl Jung called it the Collective Unconscious.\n\nCarl Jung\u2019s great ally turned rival, Sigmund Freud, proposed a model of the\nhuman psyche that acted much like a machine\u2014repression and projection as twin\npistons in the psychic engine. Freud\u2019s mechanistic sex drives and death drives\nwould eventually please the psychoanalytic establishment, but it was Jung who\nwould win the war of woo. While Freud had been consigned to dry debates within\nthe New York Psychoanalytic Institute, Jung\u2019s theory threw open the door to\nthe New Age less than a decade after his death in 1961. His ideas went well\nwith paisley prints, black lights, and sitars. Cosmic codes of harmonic\nconvergence became the sort of conversation starter that could blow someone\u2019s\nmind between sips of hippie juice at a Joplin concert\u2014not to mention the\nthriving trade they sparked in crystals, hypnosis, meditation, numerology,\npalmistry, tie-dye, yoga, and all things unicorn.\n\nWhen we go to Big Sur to soak naked in a freshwater pool overlooking the\nPacific in an effort to explore \u201csuperhumanism, the survival of bodily death,\nextraterrestrial intelligence, and more\u201d (straight from the Esalen Institute\u2019s\nwebsite), it is Carl Jung we channel. When we pop ketamine and puke ayahuasca,\nit is to Jung we owe our faith in the great synchronic woo.\n\n\u201cOur DNA and our brains are like antennae,\u201d Jacob said to Alex Jones on his\npodcast The Alex Jones Show. \u201cOur thoughts and our emotions are\nelectromagnetic frequencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the Force of Star Wars,\u201d agreed Jones. \u201cThis is a real thing.\u201d\n\nWere all conspiracy theorists Jungians in disguise? And how in the cosmic\nworld had the Zurich School of analytic psychology become entangled with\nDonald Trump?\n\nIn 1902, Jung received his M.D., writing his dissertation On the Psychology\nand Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena, which linked medical cases of\nepilepsy, multiple personality disorder, and somnambulism with s\u00e9ances,\nspiritualism, and divine metaphysics. It was the first of many works that\nwould outline Jung\u2019s belief in the convergence of the scientific and the\nsupernatural, an idea that would eventually attract cultlike followers to his\npractice on Lake Zurich to explore the contours of the collective soul and\nreestablish an intimate connection with forefathers and fatherland, a\nrelationship that had been diluted and usurped by those of a different\nphylogenetic inheritance\u2014that is, by those of a different race.\n\nThe goal of this proto-Aryan philosophy was to purge a nation riddled with\ndecadence, drug addicts, and degeneracy\u2014the bloodsucking horror that was\ndraining the vitality of European civilization, typified by the dark vision of\nBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, which appeared in 1897 and reached a cinematic\nrepresentation in the 1922 German film Nosferatu, in which the vampire was\ngiven stereotypical features of a Jew.\n\nScholars have observed a wide swath of such early-twentieth-century German\nprotofascist life-energy movements, and have labeled the phenomenon v\u00f6lkisch.\nMuch like MAGA, the term is not easy to define. It implies a preference for\nrural, populist values as opposed to urban, elite ones, tradition as opposed\nto modernity, ethnic unity as opposed to diversity, nationalism as opposed to\ncosmopolitanism, all intertwined with a quasi-mystical nostalgia.\n\nFrom the late-nineteenth century, v\u00f6lkisch ideas permeated German cults intent\non discovering, in Jung\u2019s words, \u201cthe age-old experiences of mankind that\nspeak to him from his blood.\u201d The Munich Cosmic Circle, for example, was\nanimated by the belief that rationalism had caused the West to decline and\nthat the only way out was a return to paganism. The Thule Society traced the\nAryan race to a lost continent made of ice, while the Tannenberg Foundation,\nfounded by General Erich Ludendorff, sought relief from the exigencies of\nmodern life in the forests outside Munich by lighting bonfires and sacrificing\nhorses in honor of Thor. Later in life, Ludendorff would assist in planning\nHitler\u2019s failed 1923 putsch in Munich.\n\nThe future f\u00fchrer, too, had v\u00f6lkisch leanings. Whenever he had the chance, he\nretreated to Haus Wachenfeld, his cottage in the Bavarian Alps that a 1938\nissue of Homes & Gardens described as \u201cset amid an unsophisticated peasantry\nof carvers and hunters.\u201d His diet was plant-based. His closest advisers\nbelieved in astrology. He refused to ride in a zeppelin because no bird on\nearth had ever flown that way. He suggested that ships be propelled from the\nside, like the fins of fish. He believed that a previous age was dying, a new\none about to be born. When the Nazis sought to repurpose the celebration of\nChristian holidays in the Thirties, embracing the paganism of their ancestors,\nthey replaced St. Nicholas with the deity Odin, whose watchful eye was the\nsun. And when members of the Wandervogel, Germany\u2019s first nationalist youth\nmovement, communed in the sacred forest to feel the invisible tissues that\nlinked German to German, to become one with the fatherland that had forged the\nAryan soul, to be initiated into manhood by jumping over the campfire, and to\ndespise the parasitic bastard races\u2014they brought their guitars.\n\nAfter January 6, a former high school classmate told the Daily Mail that Jacob\nhad \u201cchanged a lot\u201d since graduating. Clearly, the kid didn\u2019t know Jacob.\nBecause in his last year of high school, when asked to write a paper about\nwhat he wanted to be when he grew up, he had a ready answer:\n\n> My career of choice is to be a \u201cmaster,\u201d a Christ, a Buddha, or a Muhammad,\n> whichever you prefer to call it. Now most people would say that there is no\n> such career, and that a career is something you do for a living. Then I\n> would reply with a smile and say, \u201cWhat better living is there?\u201d\n\nGoals included \u201cmoving things with your mind, healing the sick, and rising\nfrom the dead.\u201d Daily responsibilities \u201care nothing. That is the beauty of it;\none can choose whatever one wants to create in one\u2019s reality.... This is why\nevery day of the master\u2019s life is the best day of their life.\u201d\n\nWhich would include January 6. When he reached the west side of the Capitol,\nhe moved as if in a dream, gliding onto the Senate floor as if he were some\nfabulous pooh-bah whom no one had ever heard of yet. He ambled down the center\naisle of the Senate chamber, past one hundred abandoned desks.\n\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 A, man,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat then is the American, this new man?\u201d J. Hector St. John de Cr\u00e8vecoeur\nasked in 1782. At long last, Jacob provided the answer: He is a pagan straight\nout of central casting, a bro tripping on the hidden figures of the cosmos, a\nnatural man convinced of his own self-evident truths, a hero ready to fight\nfor his blessed fatherland, notwithstanding the fact that he still lived with\nhis mother. Jacob stepped onto the dais, looked out on the sea of marble\ncolumns, and flexed his naked biceps.\n\nA cop asked him to leave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a sit in this chair,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Cause Mike Pence is a fucking\ntraitor.\u201d\n\nThe Shaman penned his infamous prophecy of cosmic reprisal\u2014it\u2019s only a matter\nof time! justice is coming\u2014and then stood. \u201cLet\u2019s all say a prayer in this\nsacred space,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you, Heavenly Father, for gracing us with this\nopportunity\u2014\u201d\n\nHe stopped mid-sentence, removed his horned helmet, and began again: \u201cThanks\nto our Heavenly Father ...\u201d\n\nOne of the patients at the Burgh\u00f6lzli Hospital, where Jung worked in\nsoutheastern Zurich, suffered from a recurring hallucination that the sun had\na penis. The man\u2019s name was Emil Schwyzer, and at the age of twenty-five he\nbelieved he had been up for promotion at a London bank only to discover that\nhe was instead being fired. For the next three days, he wandered the city\nstreets in a daze, then put a bullet through his head\u2014yet failed to kill\nhimself. Delusions, depressions, paranoias, and various suicide attempts\nfollowed.\n\nThe bullet that presumably remained lodged in Schwyzer\u2019s skull had left one\neye virtually useless; he heard voices, couldn\u2019t stick out his tongue, and\nwas, in short, a twitching mess. Jung might have summarily dismissed the case\nas incurable \u201cdementia praecox\u201d (as he described it to Freud)\u2014if not for the\npenis.\n\nFor years, Jung had been immersed in long-lost pagan rituals, from the worship\nof \u201cdog-faced baboons\u201d in Egypt to the esoteric philosophizing of Hermes\nTrismegistus. Now he recalled the Mithras Liturgy, which echoed Schwyzer\u2019s\nhallucination \u201calmost word for word.\u201d How else could the patient have known\nabout the ancient Persian cult of the sun, or the mystery religion it inspired\nin Rome, except if there were such a thing as inherited memory\u2014that is, a\ncollective unconscious? \u201cThe fantasies or delusions of ... patients,\u201d an early\nJungian analyst declared, had been \u201cparalleled in mythological material of\nwhich they knew nothing.\u201d\n\nAs if the scales had fallen from his eyes, Jung now saw penis imagery in the\nrising and setting of the sun, in the death and rebirth of gods, and he\nconcluded that worship of male heroes from Heracles to Elijah, alongside the\nrigid and indomitable rays of Helios and Horus, and other sun gods of all\ndescription and from all times, defined a condition not only embedded within\nthe male ego, but within male egos dating back to time immemorial. Emil\nSchwyzer was not a run-of-the-mill psychotic. He was Solar Phallus Man.\n\nThenceforth, Jung sought to rediscover the \u201ctwo-million-year-old\u201d in each of\nus. He traveled to North Africa, Kenya, Uganda, India, and eventually to \u201ca\nstill lower cultural level,\u201d that of the Pueblo Indians of the American\nSouthwest\u2014the native land of Jacob Angeli-Chansley. There, Jung encountered a\nman named Ochwiay Biano, also known as Mountain Lake. As Jung recalled in\nMemories, Dreams, Reflections, he and the Taos Pueblo leader conversed as \u201cthe\nblazing sun\u201d rose \u201chigher and higher.\u201d As the conversation came to a close,\nJung asked: Might not the sun \u201cbe a fiery ball shaped by an invisible god\u201d?\n\n\u201cWe are the sons of Father Sun,\u201d Mountain Lake later said.\n\nThe ancient realm of the ancestral Pueblos stretched into the northeastern\nreaches of what is now Arizona, some 145 miles north of Phoenix. The native\npopulations there have largely been exiled to the Gila River Reservation south\nof the city and west of the Superstition Mountains. Their traces remain in the\nfaux sandpainting of eagle heads on street signs, the patterns of hotel\nwallpaper, an airport mural of a strange psychedelic bird with outstretched\nwings, the crushed gypsum diamonds and ocher triangles that adorn local fast-\nfood joints.\n\nJacob\u2019s Arizona is not the glittering land of real estate billionaires, nor is\nit the modernist enclave of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Taliesin West, the golfing\narcadia of Jack Nicklaus\u2013designed courses, or the Hollywood getaway where\nMarilyn once sat by the pool of the Biltmore sipping a tequila sunrise.\nJacob\u2019s Arizona is the land of Barry Goldwater and Kari Lake, where Boogaloo\nBoys, Proud Boys, and Three Percenters carrying pitchforks and semiautomatic\nweapons descended on the county election office to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d Weeks\nbefore Jacob drove to the nation\u2019s capital, he had been among that very crowd,\nwhere he was photographed, dressed in full shaman regalia, holding a hand-\npainted sign: q sent me.\n\nBut to get back to those quantum particles Jacob saw while tripping on\nmushrooms: The field of quantum mechanics emerged in Twenties Germany among a\ngroup of theorists that included a young math genius from Vienna whom Albert\nEinstein considered his \u201cspiritual heir.\u201d His name, Wolfgang Pauli, now\ncolonizes the field, from Pauli repulsion and the Pauli equation to the Pauli\ngroup and Pauli paramagnetism. In 1930, Pauli postulated the existence of the\nsubatomic particle now known as the neutrino, the most common variety of which\nspills down from the sun and penetrates the human body at a rate of roughly\none hundred trillion per second. That same year, Pauli divorced his wife,\nmourned his mother\u2019s suicide, and had a mental breakdown. All of which led to\na life-changing decision: he made an appointment with Carl Jung.\n\nBoth Jung and Pauli believed that the solution to the riddle of his\npsychological turmoil resided in what the physicist called \u201cthe cosmic order\nof nature,\u201d which like the bosons, fermions, quarks, and leptons that the new\nquantum theory contemplated, were not only invisible to the naked eye, but\nwhose strange entanglements defied reason, prompting Einstein to famously dub\nthem spooky.\n\nJung\u2019s sessions with Pauli became the stuff of psychoanalytic legend. The\nSwiss doctor eventually interpreted hundreds of the Austrian physicist\u2019s\ndreams, enough to fill the twelfth volume of Jung\u2019s collected works,\nPsychology and Alchemy. The title of the volume was deliberate. \u201cAlchemy is\nnot only the mother of chemistry,\u201d Jung wrote, \u201cbut is also the forerunner of\nour modern psychology of the unconscious.\u201d\n\nAlchemists had long searched for the drug that would open their minds to\nperfect knowledge\u2014more along the lines of modafinil or Nooceptin than Klonopin\nor Lexapro, much less Cialis or Viagra. Their chymistry led them to toxic\nconcoctions of copper and mercury and \u201csugars\u201d of lead, crushed into \u201cblack\npouder\u201d and sublimated into \u201cstinking smoke\u201d\u2014which the adepts breathed and\ntasted. Paracelsus himself synthesized diethyl ether, a sweet-smelling, highly\nflammable hallucinogenic anaesthetic that could induce euphoria. The\nconcoction remained popular in the \u201cether frolics\u201d of the nineteenth century.\nLong before the microdosers of Silicon Valley, long before Terence McKenna and\nRam Dass and Timothy Leary\u2014and before even Carl Gustav Jung and Wolfgang\nPauli\u2014the alchemists had discovered better living through chemicals.\n\nEvery old hippie, astrologist, shaman, and yogi already knows this: Everything\nis connected. Everything is full of meaning. Wisdom consists in decrypting the\nsynchronicities. Thus: the world of the conspiracy theorist, in which a new\nrespiratory virus could explain everything from Fukushima to Frankenfood, fake\nmeat to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\n\nAs for the pervasively eponymous Pauli, the man who turned spooky\ncorrespondence into hard science: thirteen years after coming to Jung for\ntreatment, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Jacob began his thirty-four-hour trek back to the desert,\nwhich proved uneventful except for a text message from his mother saying the\nFBI was looking for him. The farther he drove west, the more conscious he\nbecame that he was now famous\u2014and that the police wanted to chat. He called\nthe FBI\u2019s Washington field office and confirmed that he was in fact the one\nwho had sat in the chair of the president of the United States Senate, that\nMike Pence was a child-trafficking traitor, and that he was the one who had\nleft a note for the vice president promising that it was only a matter of\ntime\u2014justice was coming.\n\nThe agent on the other end of the line asked if he might swing by their\noffices in Phoenix to continue the interview, and Jacob was amenable. The next\nday, on his way to yet another protest at the Arizona State Capitol, he pulled\nhis Hyundai into the parking lot on North Seventh Street, down the street from\nthe Deer Valley Airport, home of the Phoenix Police Department\u2019s citywide\nhelicopter patrol operations.\n\nPerhaps he was surprised when the FBI asked if they could search his car.\nInside they found his buffalo horns; coyote-tail headdress; red, white, and\nblue face paint; a six-foot-long flagpole-spear; his white bullhorn; and a\nrubber mallet that according to Jacob just happened to be in the vehicle, and\nhad no connection whatsoever with Thor\u2019s hammer.\n\nUnfortunately for Jacob, Mjollnir never made it to the Arizona State Capitol;\nneither did the ancient pagan god of thunder unleash his vaunted cosmic\npyrokinesis on the feds or eviscerate the office building with one of his god-\nblasts, as the FBI cuffed him without incident.\n\nOn January 11, a federal grand jury indicted him on six counts\u2014two felonies\nand four misdemeanors\u2014and Jacob became one of the first insurrectionists to be\narrested and charged. He faced twenty years of imprisonment, plus a fine of up\nto $250,000. Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram removed his accounts.\n\nWithin days, Jacob\u2019s counsel reached out to the White House chief of staff,\nMark Meadows, to request a presidential pardon. In the final days of his\npresidency, Donald Trump pardoned more than 150 people, including Roger Stone,\nPaul Manafort, Charles Kushner, and Lil Wayne, but not Jacob Angeli-Chansley,\nwho eventually pleaded guilty, spent twenty-seven months behind bars, and a\nfew weeks after early release found himself ordering organic pizza at\nPicazzo\u2019s.\n\nWhen at long last lunch landed on the table, he clasped his hands and prayed.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, I asked whether he was a Christian.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not.\u201d\n\nThen why the \u201cthank you, Heavenly Father\u201d\u2014just as he had prayed on January 6?\n\n\u201cFather Sky,\u201d he said. \u201cMother Earth.\u201d\n\nEventually, the attractions of ancient hermetic wisdom reeled in the greatest\nrationalist of them all: Sir Isaac Newton. When his long-forgotten secret\nnotebooks finally surfaced at auction in 1936 (some of which, oddly enough,\nwere purchased by John Maynard Keynes), they revealed that beneath the sane\nworld that he had laid bare by dint of cold reason lay something far beyond\ncomprehension\u2014that his numerical calculations were the merest shadow of his\nkabbalistic obsessions. The same man who had pierced nature\u2019s hidden order and\nrevealed the rainbow of colors encrypted within white light had devoted\nmillions of words to topics including astrology, gematria, the cosmic\nsignificance of the number seven, and the philosopher\u2019s stone. The\nextraordinary lengths to which he went to predict the date of the apocalypse\nwere equal parts profound and preposterous.\n\nAnd just as it would to Q and his Anons, the temptations of secret knowledge\nthat had hooked Newton proved irresistible to the masses. By the middle of the\neighteenth century, Europe and North America were teeming with alchemists.\nWriting half-baked verses about the divine powers of truth, beauty, gravity,\nand magnetism had become as fashionable as playing the clavichord. No less of\na clear thinker than Benjamin Franklin would envisage the \u201cinestimable Stone\u201d\nthat could cure \u201call Diseases, even old Age itself.\u201d Counts and dukes spent\nfortunes purchasing laboratory equipment they hoped might enable them to\ndistill the drug of endless vitality and virility\u2014life from blood, feces, and\nurine\u2014and, like the great Peter Thiel, stay young forever. The age of Locke\nand Voltaire is littered with victims of poison, electrocution, and\nasphyxiation.\n\nAs was to be expected, the search for higher consciousness eventually became\nan excuse for the elite to see and be seen. Eighteenth-century society ladies\ngathered at private parties to swoon as waves of \u201canimal magnetism\u201d enveloped\ntheir body and soul. When they escaped the city for country estates, they\nfound pagan temples constructed in the grottoes and caves that dotted untamed\nEnglish gardens, often inhabited by hired hermits paid to wear goatskins and\ninstructed not to bathe or cut their hair or nails so that they might possess\na look rather like Jacob\u2019s on January 6, one that radiated wisdom born of\nmeditation and solitude. After that frisson of primitivism, it was time to\nhead inside to inhale some laughing gas\u2014the invention of which soon followed\nthe discovery of nitrous oxide. \u201cI am sure the air in heaven must be this\nwonder-working gas of delight,\u201d wrote England\u2019s poet laureate Robert Southey.\n\nThree centuries ago, then, a revolution in consciousness was at hand, yet the\nstandard story of America\u2019s founding remains stubbornly the same: a political\nrevolution born at the height of the Age of Reason, a constitution written by\nsober Enlightenment philosophes grounded in the world of empirical fact, a\ncountry dedicated to the proposition that reason and reason alone would lead\nto a more perfect union of humans within a society.\n\nThere is plenty of support for this scenario. No doubt modern chemistry was\nbubbling up from the ancient stew of alchemy right around this time, and the\nmechanistic, self-limiting, evidence-based notion of truth could not help but\noppose the older and more popularly embraced mystical, occult, almost v\u00f6lkisch\nnotion of the truth\u2014with each side declaring itself the truthiest truth of\nthem all. While cosmic mysteries beckoned, a new breed of natural\nphilosopher\u2014the scientist\u2014was quite content with the fact that some secrets\nmight be beyond his purview. The French atheist Baron d\u2019Holbach articulated a\nnovel set of boundaries:\n\n> It is not given man to know everything, it is not given him to know his\n> origins, it is not given him to penetrate to the essence of things or to go\n> back to first principles.\n\nD\u2019Holbach believed that the universe was matter in motion, that there was no\nGod, no miracles, no supernatural, no endless referential reticulation of\ncannabis, crystals, and kabbalah. But such a thoroughly disenchanted cosmos\nwas but a fraction of the evolving cultural landscape. Marshaled against the\nnew philosophy of science was a tradition led by a pantheon of Jacob\u2019s\nintellectual forebears, from Paracelsus to Newton, Ludendorff, Jung, Leary,\nand Ram Dass.\n\nWith this intellectual lineage, conspiracy theorists are not about to back\ndown from their truths, because their own scientific method possesses a\nhistorical claim as deeply entrenched as ours. And they have a point: their\nspooky correspondences, their spheres of influence, their invisible forces,\ntheir gravities and their magnetisms, their parsing of the invisible\neffluvia\u2014without these, there never would have been any science at all. And\nthat\u2019s the reason reason has yet to dent the citadel of MAGA, and never will.\n\nLike his solar-phallic fantasy father, who is able to stare down an eclipse\nwithout eye protection, Jacob plans to return to the Capitol. He has filed\npaperwork to run for Congress and represent Arizona\u2019s Eighth District in the\nHouse of Representatives. If you rent a billboard for him, he promises to give\nyou a personal call. Details at shamanforcongress.com.\n\nWin or lose, there\u2019s always branded retail. Since his release from federal\ncustody, he\u2019s variously hawked Shaman iPhone cases, Shaman stainless-steel\nwater bottles, Shaman hats, and Shaman-brand mouse pads, not to mention\nT-shirts, socks, yoga mats, yoga pants, leggings, and slides. At one point,\nhis online store, Forbidden Apparel, offered a rather ornate Shaman American\nflag featuring an image of Jacob in full regalia superimposed onto the Stars\nand Stripes, his mouth open mid-chant, his staff with stainless-steel finial\ngleaming like a bayonet. (The flag cost $44, but you could purchase the same\ndesign on a coffee mug for $17.) No beer cozies, but for those manifesting a\npresidential run, there were plenty of shaman 2024 bumper stickers.\n\nHe produces The Occult Apocalypse Show, available from Apple Podcasts. Recent\ntopics of discussion include the Rosicrucians, Skull and Bones, and Judy\nGarland. As his brand metastasizes, Jacob has become a supermeme, portrayed by\nturns as an action figure, a Halloween costume, the Joker, and for Christmas\nFrosty the Shaman. On his educational website, forbiddentruthacademy.com, he\nappears as a god, staring down the phases of the moon.\n\nHe\u2019s also available on Cameo.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to put yourself in the alchemical fire every day,\u201d Jacob told me.\n\u201cHello ordeals and suffering. Hello enlightenment. Hello purity.\u201d\n\nWe talked until his agent called and he had to go. But before he disappeared\ninto the celestial fire of the Phoenix heat dome, I had to ask\u2014what was his\nbest-selling merch?\n\nIt was the coffee mugs.\n\nFrom the\n\nApril 2024 issue\n\n#### From the Archive\n\nTimeless stories from our 173-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of\nthe day.\n\n### Got it!
