(Jonathan Newton/for The Washington\nPost)\n\nListen\n\n4 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nThe FBI has opened a criminal investigation focusing on the massive container\nship that brought down the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore last month \u2014\na probe that will look at least in part at whether the crew left the port\nknowing the vessel had serious systems problems, according to two U.S.\nofficials familiar with the matter.\n\nAuthorities are reviewing the events leading up to the moment when the Dali, a\n985-foot Singapore-flagged ship, lost power while leaving the Port of\nBaltimore and slammed into one of the bridge\u2019s support pillars, said the\nofficials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing\nprobe.\n\nOn Monday morning, federal agents appeared to board the ship to conduct a\nsearch. Less than an hour after the sun rose at 6:30 a.m., a succession of\nthree boats pulled to the port side of the Dali. About 6:50 a.m. Monday,\npeople wearing yellow or orange life jackets entered the Dali through a lower\ndoor and climbed a ladder to the ship\u2019s bow. About a half-hour later, nearly a\ndozen more people wearing dark clothing pulled up in a smaller boat and\nclimbed aboard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FBI is present aboard the cargo ship Dali conducting court authorized law\nenforcement activity,\u201d the agency said in a statement Monday morning.\n\nOfficials boarded the Dali cargo ship on April 15 in the Patapsco River as the\nFBI opened an investigation into the collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge.\n(Video: Hadley Green/The Washington Post)\n\nThe FBI said it did not have any additional public information and would not\ncomment further. The Justice Department confirmed federal agents were on the\nship conducting a \u201ccourt-approved search.\u201d\n\nThe criminal inquiry escalates efforts to determine what occurred leading to\nthe crash and who should be held accountable for the disaster. News of the\ncriminal inquiry emerged the same day Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott\nannounced that the city had hired two law firms to work with the city\u2019s own\nlegal team to \u201chold the wrongdoers responsible and to mitigate the immediate\nand long-term harm caused to Baltimore City residents.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGrace Ocean Private Ltd. owns the Dali and Synergy Marine Pte Ltd. is the\nship\u2019s manager.

Barron, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, said in\na statement. \u201cHowever, the public should know, whether it\u2019s gun violence,\ncivil rights abuse, financial fraud, or any other threat to public safety or\nproperty, we will seek accountability for anyone who may be responsible.\u201d\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n###### Baltimore bridge collapse\n\nSee how a cargo ship took down the bridge and how the collapse will impact the\neconomy.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nThe owner and operator of the ship and attorneys representing them also did\nnot immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe pre-dawn crash March 26 crumpled the Key Bridge, where eight people were\nworking to repair concrete and fill potholes. Six members of the repair crew\nfell into the water and died, officials said. Two survived.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe criminal investigation is separate from the probe the National\nTransportation Safety Board has launched to determine the cause of the crash\nand assess other safety-related measures. The opening of a criminal\ninvestigation means the Coast Guard\u2019s Marine Board of Investigation, which is\ninvestigating in parallel to the NTSB, will pause evidence collection, but it\nwill still be able to analyze evidence it has already gathered to inform\nsafety efforts like new regulations or inspection campaigns, according to a\nCoast Guard official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing\ninvestigations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Biden and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) have both previously said that\nthey intend to hold accountable any parties deemed potentially liable for the\ndestruction of the bridge.\n\nIn a statement Monday announcing the city hired DiCello Levitt and Saltz\nMongeluzzi Bendesky Trial Lawyers, Scott said said the city will take\n\u201cdecisive action\u201d to seek accountability for the Key Bridge collapse,\nincluding the owner, charterer, operator and manufacturer of the Dali and \u201cany\nother potentially liable third parties.\u201d Scott said his administration was\nforced to act quickly to \u201cprotect the city\u2019s interests\u201d after the Dali\u2019s owner\nand manager within days of the crash filed a petition in federal court to\nlimit its liability. Also Monday, private attorneys for three of the\nconstruction workers who fell into the river -- including one who survived and\ntwo who died -- announced they were also pursuing legal action.\n\nIan Duncan contributed to this report.
