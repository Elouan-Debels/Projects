To\n> improve user experience and extend the functionality of browsers,\n> practitioners provide mechanisms to allow users to install third-party-\n> provided plugins (i.e., extensions) on their browsers. However, little is\n> known about the performance implications caused by such extensions. In this\n> paper, we conduct an empirical study to understand the impact of extensions\n> on the user-perceived performance (i.e., energy consumption and page load\n> time) of Google Chrome, the most popular browser. We study a total of 72\n> representative extensions from 11 categories (e.g., Developer Tools and\n> Sports). We observe that browser performance can be negatively impacted by\n> the use of extensions, even when the extensions are used in unintended\n> circumstances (e.g., when logging into an extension is not granted but\n> required, or when an extension is not used for designated websites). We also\n> identify a set of factors that significantly influence the performance\n> impact of extensions, such as code complexity and privacy practices (i.e.,\n> collection of user data) adopted by the extensions. Based on our empirical\n> observations, we provide recommendations for developers and users to\n> mitigate the performance impact of browser extensions, such as conducting\n> performance testing and optimization for unintended usage scenarios of\n> extensions, or adhering to proper usage practices of extensions (e.g.,\n> logging into an extension when required).\n\nSubjects:| Performance (cs.PF); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Software\nEngineering (cs.SE)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.06827 [cs.PF]  \n(or arXiv:2404.06827v1 [cs.PF] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.06827arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Bihui Jin [view email] [v1] Wed, 10 Apr 2024 08:31:40 UTC (968 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Impact of Extensions on Browser Performance: An\nEmpirical Study on Google Chrome, by Bihui Jin and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.PF\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.HC cs.SE\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
