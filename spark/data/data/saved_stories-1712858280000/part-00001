The new regime\ninitially suffered from low subscription rates, and the government has\nunderspent hundreds of millions from the \u00a32.4bn farming budget each year due\nto lack of sign-up.\n\nScotland and Wales have different farming schemes, and Northern Ireland has\nnot yet set up its new scheme due to Stormont not having sat for two years. In\nWales, there have been protests over plans to ask farmers to set aside 20% of\ntheir farms for nature and tree planting.\n\nGovernment projections and independent analysis have shown that the new nature\npayments schemes will not plug the gap left by the lack of EU subsidies for\nmost farmers. The nature schemes were never meant to replace the CAP payments\nexactly, and instead are aimed at paying farmers to provide public goods.\n\nNow, at least 100 farmers have signed up to a new campaign group, BI4Farmers,\nto ask for a universal basic income (UBI) for all farmers in Britain.\n\nThe campaigners said that farmers across the UK were \u201cbasically kept afloat\u201d\nby EU subsidies and now risk going out of business. Analysis by the organic\nfarming group Riverford has found that half of farmers surveyed said they may\ngo out of business due to post-Brexit trade deals, uncertainty over farming\npayment schemes and rising costs.\n\nJo Poulton, the BI4Farmers coordinator, said: \u201cBritish farmers are overworked\nand underpaid but the Brexit process presents an ideal opportunity to change\nthis.\n\n\u201cA basic income for farmers would guarantee an adequate income, improving\naccess to time off and reasonable working hours and making entering a career\nin farming affordable for new entrants.\u201d\n\nSustainable farming groups have also shared their support for a UBI for\nfarmers to enable to them to experiment with nature friendly farming methods\nsuch as using fewer pesticides without sacrificing their income.\n\nWill White, sustainable farming campaign coordinator at Sustain, said:\n\u201cUniversal basic income could be an important safety net for farm workers and\nsmall new entrant growers, providing financial security that liberates them to\npursue agro-ecological practices without the looming pressure of financial\nsurvival.\n\n\u201cWhen paired with better funding for environmental land management schemes,\nUBI has the potential to significantly bolster the agricultural sector\u2019s\noverall resilience. Looking into radical yet promising solutions like this is\nessential. We support a deeper exploration of how basic income policies could\nwork in the UK context and are watching this campaign with interest.\u201d\n\nRuth West, a cofounder of the Oxford Real Farming Conference, added:\n\u201cConcerned citizens, farmers in dire straits, policymakers and all those who\ncare about a fairer food system should get onboard and help move this\npractical, doable plan to the next phase.\n\n\u201cBI4Farmers presents us with a golden opportunity for a sustainable farming\nfuture. It\u2019s an opportunity we must not miss.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Farming\n  * England\n  * Brexit\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### New Brexit checks to cost UK business \u00a32bn and fuel inflation, report finds\n\n13h ago\n\n  * ### Ditching European trade for China and India was ever a poor bet.
