I mean I thought we were moving on to AI. So why are we doing floppy\ndisk,\" said Katie Guillen, SFMTA passenger.\n\nTurns out that in 1998, SFMTA had the latest cutting edge technology when they\ninstalled their automatic train control system.\n\n\"We were the first agency in the U.S. to adopt this particular technology but\nit was from an era that computers didn't have a hard drive so you have to load\nthe software from floppy disks on to the computer,\" said Mariana Maguire,\nSFMTA Train Control Project.\n\nMORE: SFMTA to add 35 more transit fare inspectors amid financial crisis\n\nSFMTA says 35 more transit fare inspectors will be added to improve ticket\nenforcement amid its ongoing financial crisis.\n\nIt's been 26 years and every morning SFMTA staff still relies on floppy disks\nto tell the trains how to operate.\n\n\"It's like if you lose your memory overnight, and every morning, somebody has\nto tell you hey 'this is who you are and what your purpose is what you have to\ndo today,'\" said Maguire.\n\nWe went underground where SFMTA Train Control Project public information\nofficer gave us a tour of their system.\n\nLuz Pena: \"What is the role the floppy disk is playing right now?\n\nMariana Maguire: \"The floppy disk is one component of one system. The system\nthat automatically controls our trains inside the subway. But our metro system\nthat operates citywide has many components to it.\"\n\nSFMTA's train control system relies every morning on 5 inch floppy disks.\n\nLuz Pena: \"How dire is it to change the system to upgrade it from a floppy\ndisk to a wireless system?\"\n\nJeffrey Tumlin: \"It's a question of risk. The system is currently working just\nfine but we know that with each increasing year risk of data degradation on\nthe floppy disks increases and that at some point there will be a catastrophic\nfailure.\"\n\nMORE: BART riders prepare for new system changes, say goodbye to legacy trains\n\nBART riders can expect to see only the new trains and a new schedule starting\nMonday.\n\nThis system was designed to last 20 to 25 years. SFMTA's director Jeffrey\nTumlin said upgrading the system will take another decade and cost hundreds of\nmillions of dollars.\n\n\"The detail project schedule will be finalized once we have a contractor\nonboard. This is effectively a multi-phase decade long project that starts\nwith pieces of market street subway and pieces in the surface. Ultimately our\ngoal is to have a single train control system for the entire rail system,\"\nsaid Tumlin.\n\nSFMTA said upgrading the system will improve reliability something the team in\nthe control room is tracking every day.\n\nLuz Pena: \"Once the upgrade happens, what will change here?\"\n\nMariana Maguire: \"They will be able to track the movements of trains and the\noperations of trains throughout the city much more easily with the assistance\nof autopilot, which will be able to boost the human element as well.\"\n\nMORE: Iconic San Francisco Cable Car turns 150 years old. Here's a look at the\ncelebration\n\nCable Cars are synonymous with San Francisco and recognized around the world.\nIt all started in 1873 with an idea to navigate the city's hills.\n\nWho will pay for the system upgrade?\n\n\"We are hoping that a large component of this will come from state and federal\ngrants. The rest of it will come from Muni's rapidly declining internal\ncapital resources,\" said Tumlin.\n\nIf you're on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live\n\nReport a correction or typo\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KGO-TV.
