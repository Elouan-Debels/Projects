From\nthere, classifications dog our every step: to school, work, the doctor\u2019s\noffice, and even the grave.\n\nDespite the vast diversity and individuality in every life, we seek patterns,\norganization, and control. Or, as cognitive psychologist Gregory Murphy puts\nit: \u201cWe put an awful lot of effort into trying to figure out and convince\nothers of just what kind of person someone is, what kind of action something\nwas, and even what kind of object something is.\u201d\n\nGregory L. Murphy is the author of \u201cCategories We Live By: How We Classify\nEveryone and Everything\u201c\n\nIn his new book \u201cCategories We Live By,\u201d Murphy, a professor emeritus at New\nYork University who has spent a career studying concepts and categories,\nconsiders the categories we create to manage life\u2019s sprawling diversity.\nAnalyzing everything from bureaucracy\u2019s innumerable categorizations to the\nminutiae of language, his book reveals how these categories are imposed on us\nand how that imposition affects our everyday lives.\n\nIn the interview that follows, Murphy discusses his lifelong interest in\nstudying concepts and categories \u2014 \u201cthe glue that holds our mental world\ntogether,\u201d as he\u2019s described them \u2014 the impact of his research on his\nworldview, and the complex relationship between language and categorization\nacross cultures.\n\nWhat got you interested in studying concepts and categories, and how did this\neventually lead to your new book?\n\nI started studying categories in my first year of graduate school. The\npsychology of categories was fairly new and an exciting area then, because of\nthe important discoveries by Eleanor Rosch and her students (some reviewed in\nthe book). It was clear that the traditional way of studying how people learn\ncategories was no longer appropriate, and we had to develop new techniques and\nask new questions. So, it was a great time to be in the field.\n\nBut, as happens in many scientific fields, the work began to get increasingly\ntechnical and specialized. By this century, much of the work relied on\nmathematical models and computer simulations in order to test different\ntheories. This is a normal and generally useful progression, but it meant that\nthe average person couldn\u2019t read the work or benefit from the field\u2019s\ndiscoveries.\n\n> We often feel that once we determine the thing\u2019s category, then all\n> questions will be answered about it.\n\nAs I became a \u201csenior figure\u201d (ahem) in the field, I began to think that to\nsome degree we\u2019ve lost the forest for the trees, so I wanted to write about\nsome of the important things we have learned about categories over the past 50\nyears, many of which are interesting or useful (and some both). Not all of\nthis comes from psychological research; there have also been important\ncontributions from philosophy, linguistics (especially semantics), and\nanthropology. I also wanted to get beyond theoretical investigations and talk\nabout a lot of concrete examples, from the life-changing to the trivial. I\nlearned a lot from doing research into some of these examples and thought\nothers would find these cases interesting as well.\n\nI want to get back to some of those examples. But first, how do you think your\nwork has changed the way you view the world?\n\nI think it has made me more skeptical of arguments about identities, of people\nand all kinds of things. We put an awful lot of effort into trying to figure\nout and convince others of just what kind of person someone is, what kind of\naction something was, and even what kind of object something is. We often feel\nthat once we determine the thing\u2019s category, then all questions will be\nanswered about it: The person is qualified or unqualified; it\u2019s the right\nthing to do or the wrong thing; the object must be made out of wood. But\ndivision into categories is often arbitrary \u2014 not completely, but in some\nrespects. And every category is a simplification to some degree; it throws\naway information about the thing. If you call me an academic, that is no doubt\ntrue, but that doesn\u2019t include a lot of other information about me, nor do I\ncorrespond exactly to your stereotype of an academic. (OK, I actually do, but\na lot of academics don\u2019t.)\n\nThere are a number of different ways to make categories, and they don\u2019t always\nagree with one another. At some point, we have to make a principled decision\nabout what the category is and why that is the best way to think about it,\nbecause the world isn\u2019t pre-divided into nice categories that we simply have\nto notice.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that disputes over categorization aren\u2019t important. They may\nbe necessary, especially in rule-making contexts like the law or in\norganizations. But you have to take the entire process with a grain of salt\nand recognize the limits of what the category can tell you.\n\nYou suggest that any human culture that had language must have also had\ncategories. How do words and their meanings influence the way we categorize\nand understand the world around us?\n\nThe relationship between language and categories is pretty complex. One thing\nto keep in mind is that every content word essentially specifies a category,\nof all the things that can be called by that word. So, a verb like jump\nspecifies a category of actions that we would describe using that verb. A noun\nlike cat specifies a category of the animals we would call \u201ccat.\u201d However,\nword meanings are often very complex and extended. They can include very\ndifferent things.\n\nAn obvious example is homonyms, when two different and unrelated words happen\nto have the same name. From the point of view of the child learning a\nlanguage, these are confusing, and one of the joys of parenthood is being\nforced to explain why the flying bat is called the same thing as a baseball\nbat, why we hear through ears but eat ears of corn, how a calf can refer both\nto a baby cow and to the muscles on the bottom of the leg, and so on. Children\nsoon figure out that \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is\u201d and have to go along with the\ncrazy word meanings that adults have given to them. But from the perspective\nof the Whorfian hypothesis \u2014 which proposes that the language we use\ninfluences and shapes our thought processes and worldview \u2014 all such cases are\ntroubling. I don\u2019t think that English speakers believe that baseball bats are\nin any way similar to the mammal, even though they have the same name. There\nare limits on how much language can shape our thoughts.\n\nOf course, most words are not homonyms, but many very common words have a lot\nof different, though related, meanings. So, the word church can be used to\nrefer to a religious organization but also to a building (\u201cThe church burned\ndown.\u201d). Surely organizations and buildings aren\u2019t the same kind of thing. So,\nlanguage is an imperfect clue to what categories we have. Research comparing\nsimilar words of different languages confirms this: The categories picked out\nby different languages can be very different, even when people\u2019s categories\nare quite similar.\n\n> Language is an imperfect clue to what categories we have.\n\nStill, we have to admit that word meanings can help or hinder the learning\nabout categories. If you\u2019re a new skier, hearing people use words like popcorn\nor powder to describe different kinds of snow may help you learn what\ndifferent kinds of snow there are and how they affect your skiing. But it\nseems pretty clear that this vocabulary developed historically in response to\nthe categories that skiers had already figured out. The words didn\u2019t come\nfirst, and then people learned about snow later. If there is a category that\nis important to us, society tends to find a label to refer to it.\n\nHow much do categories differ across languages and cultures? Do you believe\ncertain languages inherently foster different categorization systems?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to give a specific answer to this. In some respects, the categories\nof different cultures are surprisingly similar. In other respects, they\u2019re\n(not-so-surprisingly) different. In the basic, common categories of everyday\nlife, different cultures seem to have pretty similar categories. The\ndifferences may be in more social and abstract categories. There\u2019s actually a\nfield of study \u2014 ethnobiology \u2014 that compares the categories of the natural\nworld across cultures, and to some degree, people pick out the same\ncategories, or at least the same kinds of categories even in very different\ncultures. Of course there are differences when parts of the natural world\noccur in one place but not in another. I don\u2019t know the different kinds of\nbirds of South Asia, and I would imagine that the people of South Asia don\u2019t\ngenerally know the different American sparrows or wild mammals. That is not\nvery surprising. However, when people in different parts of the world make\ncategories of plants or animals, they tend to make about the same kinds of\ncategories, often based on the biological genus: categories like oaks,\nsparrows, trout, or roses.\n\nAnthropologists who have studied nonindustrial societies often find that their\ncategories of plants and animals are pretty similar to ours at a middle level.\nThe differences are often found in the more specific and more abstract\ncategories. An abstract category like arthropods is something that scientists\nmay find useful and that you could be taught in your biology class, but it\u2019s\nnot something that people who are directly in contact with animals find at all\nuseful. Arthropods don\u2019t look very similar, don\u2019t do the same behaviors,\naren\u2019t all edible, and so on. Knowing about crabs is useful; knowing that\ncrabs and millipedes are in the same category... not so much. Similarly,\npeople often know about very specific categories only when they are actually\nused in agriculture, hunting, or for some specific purpose. If you raise corn,\nyou will want to know which corn is good to plant, which is only good for\nanimal fodder or is decorative, and so on. So, you\u2019ll have categories of\ndifferent kinds of corn to help distinguish them. If you don\u2019t raise corn,\nthen you\u2019ll probably just see it all as corn.\n\nSo, for most natural categories, the effect of culture is in providing focus\nand expertise to develop more categories of the things you\u2019re interested in.\nOccasionally, that focus may result in categories that are specifically\ndesigned for a single purpose, like edible fish that can be caught in the\nlocal rivers. This is not a \u201cnatural\u201d category, and it wouldn\u2019t be known to\npeople who don\u2019t fish or don\u2019t live in the area, but it could be very useful\nto the subset of people who rely on fishing or engage in it as a hobby. We may\nall form categories like that in our mini-cultures of special interests and\nactivities.\n\nThe second part of your book is organized around specific case studies\nexploring categories ranging from critical (medicine, race, mortality) to\ntrivial (peanut butter, almond milk, parking regulations). We could probably\ndedicate separate discussions to each of those, but since it\u2019s not feasible to\ncover any of them comprehensively here, can you share the broader insights\nthese diverse case studies collectively offer about the nature of categories?\n\nTheories of categories are useful only insofar as they tell us about real\nexamples. If they can only be applied to artificial and simplified situations\n(as in many psychology experiments), they aren\u2019t of much use. So, my goal was\nto show how the different aspects of categorization play out in real examples.\nSome of these are outright silly, such as whether a burrito is a sandwich, or\nthe famous case of whether Pringles are potato chips. Others are extremely\nimportant to the people involved and to society as a whole, such as racial or\nlegal categories.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that the same issues arise for the trivial and\nserious categories, such as the difficulty of making a definition that works,\nbeliefs that categories have essences, and problems of fuzzy boundaries.\nSometimes the law steps in, to tell us just how much peanut something must\nhave to be sold as peanut butter or exactly what criteria must be met for\nsomeone to be declared dead. But such rules still allow for unclear cases, and\noften people don\u2019t know or don\u2019t follow those rules in their everyday lives.\nSo, there are at least two categories: the official one based on the law and\nthe one that most people actually use.\n\nIs there anything else you think our readers should know?\n\nI had the idea early in my career that science might step in and tell us what\nthe answers are, at least for some categories. However, many scientific\ncategories have the same problems as our everyday categories do. The case of\nPluto is one that many people know. During the debate over whether Pluto is a\nplanet, it came to light that there was no definition of what a planet is.\nOops! And I discovered, to my dismay (which I share in the book), that there\nis little agreement in biology over how to determine what a species is. The\nproblem, I argue, is not in science or in our human institutions, but in the\nworld, which is extraordinarily complex. There are many different valid ways\nof dividing up the entities in the world, and we have to figure out which ones\nare useful to us. That\u2019s why understanding how and why we make categories is\nitself an important goal. The world doesn\u2019t give us categories for free \u2014 we\nhave to make them ourselves.\n\nGregory L.
