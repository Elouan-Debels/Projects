Many Cybertruck owner hopefuls have complained on\nCybertruck Owners Club forum that they received a notification that their\ndelivery appointments have been canceled due to an \"unexpected delay.\"\n\n\"Hi, we have just been informed of an unexpected delay regarding the\npreparation of your vehicle. We need to cancel your delivery appointment for\ntomorrow and we will reach out again when we\u2019re able to get you back on the\nschedule,\" the notification read, according to one of the forum users.\n\n## Why The Delay?\n\nDetails of the postponement weren't disclosed to the frustrated owners\nexpecting to receive their units this weekend. However, X user and long-time\nTesla correspondent Whole Mars Catalog said the Cybertruck deliveries will be\nstopped for seven days. The issue is said to be with the truck's accelerator\npedal, which is something other forum users have also pointed out.\n\nOne user, Avery21, said that the issue is with the lubricant that causes\nslippage in the accelerator. Tesla is mum on the real cause of the delay, but\nit's certainly something owners, who have been patiently waiting for their\nCybertrucks for a while, aren't exactly happy about.\n\nRelated\n\n##### Real-World Tesla Cybertruck Towing Range Is In... And It's Worse Than We\nExpected\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck's towing range is less than the Model X, despite all its\nnew tech.\n\n## Cybertruck Issues\n\nThis isn't the first issue the Cybertruck has faced since it finally reached\nthe market late last year. Early owners have reported signs of rusting on the\ntruck's stainless steel body \u2013 something Tesla's lead engineer has strongly\nrefuted. Tesla also fixed over 2 million EVs, including the Cybertruck, due to\ntheir font issues, which were rectified through over-the-air updates. Some\nearly deliveries reportedly came without aero wheel covers.\n\nIf the report on the accelerator pedal issue holds, the postponement of\nCybertruck deliveries isn't bad. Having major issues rectified before they\narrive at customers' hands is a good initiative by the company, instead of\njust fixing them after several complaints.\n\nSource: Cybertruck Owners Club\n\nShare Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nShare Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * News\n  * Electric Vehicles\n  * trucks\n  * industry news\n  * Tesla\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJacob Oliva (580 Articles Published)\n\nJacob Oliva is an automotive journalist with nearly a decade of experience\ncovering stories about anything with wheels.
