The table is also organized to represent how\nthese teeny, tiny bits of matter interact with the fundamental forces of\nnature.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t begin as a table. The grand theory of almost everything actually\nrepresents a collection of several mathematical models that proved to be\ntimeless interpretations of the laws of physics.\n\nHere is a brief tour of the topics covered in this gargantuan equation.\n\n### The whole thing\n\nThis version of the Standard Model is written in the Lagrangian form. The\nLagrangian is a fancy way of writing an equation to determine the state of a\nchanging system and explain the maximum possible energy the system can\nmaintain.\n\nTechnically, the Standard Model can be written in several different\nformulations, but, despite appearances, the Lagrangian is one of the easiest\nand most compact ways of presenting the theory.\n\nLagrangian standard model\n\nCourtesy of T.D. Gutierrez\n\n### Section 1\n\nThese three lines in the Standard Model are ultraspecific to the gluon, the\nboson that carries the strong force. Gluons come in eight types, interact\namong themselves and have what\u2019s called a color charge.\n\n### Section 2\n\nAlmost half of this equation is dedicated to explaining interactions between\nbosons, particularly W and Z bosons.\n\nBosons are force-carrying particles, and there are four species of bosons that\ninteract with other particles using three fundamental forces. Photons carry\nelectromagnetism, gluons carry the strong force and W and Z bosons carry the\nweak force. The most recently discovered boson, the Higgs boson, is a bit\ndifferent; its interactions appear in the next part of the equation.\n\n### Section 3\n\nThis part of the equation describes how elementary matter particles interact\nwith the weak force. According to this formulation, matter particles come in\nthree generations, each with different masses. The weak force helps massive\nmatter particles decay into less massive matter particles.\n\nThis section also includes basic interactions with the Higgs field, from which\nsome elementary particles receive their mass.\n\nIntriguingly, this part of the equation makes an assumption that contradicts\ndiscoveries made by physicists in recent years. It incorrectly assumes that\nparticles called neutrinos have no mass.\n\n### Section 4\n\nIn quantum mechanics, there is no single path or trajectory a particle can\ntake, which means that sometimes redundancies appear in this type of\nmathematical formulation. To clean up these redundancies, theorists use\nvirtual particles they call ghosts.\n\nThis part of the equation describes how matter particles interact with Higgs\nghosts, virtual artifacts from the Higgs field.\n\n### Section 5\n\nThis last part of the equation includes more ghosts. These ones are called\nFaddeev-Popov ghosts, and they cancel out redundancies that occur in\ninteractions through the weak force.\n\nNote: Thomas Gutierrez, an assistant professor of Physics at California\nPolytechnic State University, transcribed the Standard Model Lagrangian for\nthe web. He derived it from Diagrammatica, a theoretical physics reference\nwritten by Nobel Laureate Martinus Veltman. In Gutierrez\u2019s dissemination of\nthe transcript, he noted a sign error he made somewhere in the equation.
