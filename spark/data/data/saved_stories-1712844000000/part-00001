(April 2020) (Learn how and when to\nremove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nMental toughness is a measure of individual resilience and confidence that may\npredict success in sport, education, and the workplace.^[1] The concept\nemerged in the context of sports training, as one of a set of attributes that\nallow a person to become a better athlete and able to cope with difficult\ntraining and difficult competitive situations and emerge without losing\nconfidence. The term has been used by coaches, sport psychologists, sports\ncommentators, and business leaders.\n\nMental toughness can be thought of as the applications of grit\ncharacteristics.^[citation needed] Additional synonyms might include:\nresilience, determined, strong-willed, and stalwart. A person who has the\nqualities of mental toughness might accept challenges as they arise aiding\nthem to achieve their goals whether that be in sports, academics, or in their\nprofessions.\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\"Mental toughness\" is frequently used colloquially to refer to any set of\npositive mental attributes that helps a person to cope with difficult\nsituations. Coaches and sport commentators freely use the term mental\ntoughness to describe the mental state of athletes who persevere through\ndifficult sport circumstances, such as playing while hurt, to succeed. In\nsupport of this, a number of studies have linked mental toughness to sporting\nsuccess or achievement.^[citation needed] However, the phrase is often simply\napplied as a default explanation for any victory. Criticisms about this\nimprecise use of this term abound.^[2]\n\nScientific research has attempted a formal definition of mental toughness as a\npsychological construct with clear measurement criteria, which would allow\nrobust analyses and comparisons to be made.\n\nIn particular, three research teams produced both a definition and a construct\ndefinition for mental toughness: being able to push past failures or blockades\nby remaining positive and competitive. This involves training the mind to be\nready for challenges.\n\n### Jones, Hanton, and Connaughton[edit]\n\nGraham Jones, Sheldon Hanton, and Declan Connaughton of the United States used\npersonal construct psychology in interviews with elite athletes, as well as\nelite-level coaches and sport psychologists, to arrive at the following\ndefinition of mental toughness:\n\n> Having the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to:\n> generally, cope better than your opponents with the many demands\n> (competition, training, lifestyle) that sport places on a performer;\n> specifically, be more consistent and better than your opponents in remaining\n> determined, focused, confident, and in control under pressure.^[3]^: 209\n\nThese same researchers published a second paper which provided four dimensions\n(categories) for mental toughness attributes: a general dimension of a\nperformer's attitude or mindset (specifically, the performer's focus and self-\nbelief), and three time-specific dimensions: training, competition, and post-\ncompetition. These time-specific dimensions contain attributes of mental\ntoughness (such as handling pressure, handling failure, and pushing yourself\nto your physical limit in training) that pertain to their use at those\ntimes.^[4]\n\n### Clough and Earle[edit]\n\nPeter Clough et al.^[5] proposed a model of mental toughness that\nconceptualizes it as a personality trait. Their model has four components:\nconfidence, challenge, control, and commitment. They developed a questionnaire\nby which to measure mental toughness.^[6] They combined existing psychological\ntheory and applied sport psychology in an attempt to bridge the gap between\nresearch and practice. They saw comparisons between their emerging mental\ntoughness data and the concept of hardiness, a key individual difference and\nresistance resource that helps buffer stress and has become an accepted\nconcept in health psychology within the study of the stress-illness\nrelationship. They believe mental toughness has broad application and should\nnot be limited to the sports domain. They feel that sports-specific measures\nare unlikely to move the field forward in any meaningful ways. The development\nwork relating to their model is fully described and discussed in their book on\nmental toughness.^[7]\n\n### Gucciardi, Gordon, and Dimmock[edit]\n\nDaniel Gucciardi, Sandy Gordon, and James Dimmock of Australia have proposed a\ndifferent definition and framework of mental toughness, based primarily on\ntheir work with Australian footballers. Using personal construct psychology,\nthese authors proposed the following definition of mental toughness:\n\n> Mental toughness in Australian Football is a collection of values,\n> attitudes, behaviors, and emotions that enable you to persevere and overcome\n> any obstacle, adversity, or pressure experienced, but also to maintain\n> concentration and motivation when things are going well to consistently\n> achieve your goals.^[8]^: 278\n\nAlthough this definition was produced through work with Australian\nfootballers, it has been generalized to other sports, including\ncricket^[9]^[10] and soccer.^[11] This definition conceives mental toughness\nas having reactive and proactive qualities; players can use mental toughness\nattributes to help endure and perform well during adverse situations, but can\nalso employ other attributes of mental toughness when the game is going well,\nto keep them playing at their best.\n\n## Studies[edit]\n\nSome psychologists argued that a separate, sport-specific definition of mental\ntoughness should be developed.^[12] The attributes of a mentally tough athlete\nin one sport may differ greatly from the attributes of a mentally tough\nathlete in a different sport. Differences have also been hypothesized between\nmale and female athletes, and between \"team sport\" and \"individual sport\"\nathletes, but to date^[update], little empirical evidence has shown what these\ndifferences are.\n\nSport-specific studies of mental toughness have been conducted in\ncricket,^[9]^[10]^[13] soccer,^[11]^[14] gymnastics,^[15] and Australian\nfootball.^[8]^[16]^[17]^[18] These studies have not employed a common\nframework, although many have used the definition of mental toughness provided\nby either the Jones et al. study or the Gucciardi et al. study.\n\nMany sports-focused studies employed the Clough model of mental toughness.\nThey use samples of athletes to investigate a possible link between toughness,\ncoping, emotional reactivity, psychological skills, and performance.^[19]\n\nOne of the few published studies that takes mental toughness out of the\nsporting domain is based on the 4 'C's model. This study showed that senior\nmanagers are tougher than their junior colleagues.^[20] Clough and his team\nare working in a number of areas outside of sport\u2014education, health, social,\nand occupational\u2014to explore the relevance of mental toughness in these areas.\n\nIn 2019, a study using a personality assessment identified six personality\ntraits of top NCAA Division 1 and professional athletes that define mental\ntoughness. This study also highlighted that the traits that make up mental\ntoughness and that predict athletic success are some of the same traits seen\nin the most successful sales professionals.^[21]\n\nIn April 2020, researchers found that top gamers shared the ability to cope\nwith stressors as well as Olympian athletes.^[22]\n\nMental toughness can also be found in the workplace. It's been found that when\nthose in positions of influence instill mental toughness in their team\nmembers, those team members are more productive, take less sick leave, and\nwork better together when collaboration arises.^[23]\n\n### Developmental studies[edit]\n\nThere is debate about whether mental toughness is primarily a developed\ncharacteristic, or has a genetic basis. Two studies suggest that foundational\nprocesses occur during development that allow a person to build mental\ntoughness throughout life. For instance, a study of American soccer players,\nparents, and coaches found that parents provide a \"generalized form\" of mental\ntoughness upon which coaches can build a sport-specific form of mental\ntoughness.^[11] A similar study suggested that mental toughness development\nproceeds first through the development of a tough attitude (strong focus and\nstrong self-belief); upon a tough attitude, an athlete learns how to develop\nmental toughness attributes needed for training, then for competition.^[24]\nAnother study examined the developmental experiences of ten super-elite\nathletes and found that coaches and significant adults played an important\nrole in mental toughness development through all stages of talent\ndevelopment.^[25]\n\nHorsburgh et al. demonstrated that genetic and non-shared environmental\nfactors contribute to the development of mental toughness (as measured by\nquestionnaire), and that mental toughness behaves \"in the same manner as\nvirtually every personality trait that has ever been investigated in\nbehavioural genetic study\".^[26]^: 104 In establishing significant\nrelationships with the big five personality factors of Costa and McCrae\n(1992),^[full citation needed] these researchers have also provided evidence\nto support Clough et al.\u2019s conceptualisation of mental toughness.^[26] While\nembracing the importance of genetics, Clough acknowledges that mental\ntoughness can be developed.^[27]\n\n### Studies with Sports[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by\nadding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and\nremoved. (August 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nA research study analyzed how kids with mental toughness performed compared to\nthose without the trait. Of randomly-selected people the researchers found\nthat the mentally tough athletes were better in their sport. There were five\nreoccurring themes with the athletes that possessed mental toughness.\n\n  1. The athletes proved and showed their mental toughness by overcoming obstacles and not getting down on themselves when things did not go their way.\n  2. The athletes who were mentally tough were much more self driven to do well in their given sport and were self determined.\n  3. The mentally tough were able to control their emotions while playing the sport.\n  4. The mentally tough focus on ways to become better at their sport in ways where they do not get all the glory. They will do things that help their team win that most people may not notice such as giving an assist in basketball.\n  5. Mentally tough athletes are good teammates, they are not selfish. They will do whatever it takes to win. They do not care about the glory, they just do whatever it takes for their team to succeed.\n\n### Mental Toughness in the Workplace[edit]\n\nA study by done Ruparel, ^[28]Namita, et al has found that the relationship\nbetween mental toughness and more job demand has led to better authentic\nhappiness. Essentially higher job demand led to increased happiness. And\nmental toughness helps to bring about the relationship between higher job\ndemand and happiness.\n\nAdditionally, it has been found that employees with higher levels of mental\ntoughness may experience lower levels of stress than their colleagues.\nFurther, lower stress levels and higher abilities to cope can lead to\nincreases in job performance. Individuals in the workplace may become\nproficient if the skill of being mentally tough is taught and reiterated.\n^[29]\n\nMental toughness has led to better performance among employees. One trait of\nmental toughness is the tendency for improved performance on task-oriented\ngoals. Another trait of high mental toughness is it leads to achievement goal\nmaking, providing individuals with a state of mind to go above and beyond at\nwork. Finally, individuals equipped with mental toughness are better suited to\nhandle stress at work. ^[30]\n\nMental toughness invokes motivation and drive in goal achieving. It helps with\nproblem solving abilities and supports personal hope. Additionally higher\nmental toughness can give a better desire for learning, boost confidence, and\nresilience. Resilience in adversity can foster competitiveness in the\nworkplace.^[31]\n\nResearch done by Turkington et al. studied mental health and perceived stress.\nIt was found that perceived in mental health workers was related to low mental\ntoughness. The research suggests that increasing mental toughness is needed to\ncombat high stress. ^[32]\n\n### Mental Toughness in the Military[edit]\n\nThere is limited research and methods by which one can measure for mental\ntoughness. However the military has been a great population by which research\nhas been conducted in order to better understand this mindset. ^[33]\n\nOne of these studies was conducted by Smith et al. who looked at active-duty\nAirman's decreased suicidal rates in relation to those who had a support group\nand mental toughness. Their efforts to scale mental toughness came from the\nMental Toughness Psychological Skills Profile (MTPSP; Asken 2005). They found\nthat there could be a link between suicidal ideations decreasing when social\ngroups were present, which those social groups helped facilitate mental\ntoughness and self-confidence. ^[33]\n\nIn an effort to better understand how to test for mental toughness Arthur et\nal. developed and tested for a scale in hopes to better understand and define\nmental toughness through a study with military recruits, the scale is known as\nthe Military Training Mental Toughness Inventory (MTMTI).^[34] Over the span\nof three studies, Fitzwater et al. claim it to have proper psychometric\nproperties, good reliability (tested through test-retest methods) concurrent\nvalidity and could be used as a decent predictor of performance. ^[34]\n\n### Academics and Mental toughness[edit]\n\nSt Clair-Thompson found that mental toughness plays a significant role in\nacademics.^[35] Mental toughness is positively associated with increases in\nacademic attainment and attendance. It also plays a positive role in school\nbehavior and peer relationships.^[35] Mental toughness in academics is often\nincorrectly assumed to be the same thing as Grit. Mental toughness and Grit\nare similar, but they are not the same thing. Grit is having patience and\nperseverance to complete a long term goal. Mental toughness refers to a mental\nstate capable of being meaningful, purposeful, and flexible when trying to\nachieve a goal.^[36] Both play a part in academic achievement.\n\nOn average, mentally tough people deal with academic anxiety more positively,\nby using coping mechanisms rather than avoidance techniques.^[37]^[38] Mental\ntoughness acts as a mediator between academic anxiety and academic avoidance,\nwhich allows individuals to be more successful in academic endeavors.^[37] Due\nto mental toughness being a state of mind, it can be improved when\npracticed.^[36]\n\nLike Grit, resilience is often used interchangeably with mental toughness. It\nhas a similar meaning, but once again, they are not the same.^[39] Stock\nstates that mental toughness must be paired with resilience, but resilience\ncan exist without mental toughness. In academics, mental toughness can be\nmeasured through confidence and positive attitudes during difficulties.^[39]\nMen usually report higher Mental toughness than women, but recent evidence\nsuggests that mental toughness may be expressed differently between genders.\nEspecially in an academic environment.^[39]^[40] Maintaining mental toughness\nand a feeling of control is correlated with higher academic performance in\nboth men and women.^[39]\n\n## Similar constructs[edit]\n\nMental toughness has been equated with better-understood constructs from\npsychology such as resilience and hardiness.\n\nThe term resilience is often incorrectly used interchangeably with mental\ntoughness, though researchers have found the two constructs are positively\nassociated with one another.^[41] However, psychologists define resilience as\na positive adaptive process of coping with stress and adversity, as opposed to\na collection of psychological attributes or personality traits.^[dubious \u2013\ndiscuss]\n\nHardiness has been suggested as a similar construct to mental toughness.\nHardiness has typically been constructed as a stable personality trait. This\ndiffers from the conceptions of mental toughness offered by both Jones et al.\nand Gucciardi et al. Those authors conceive of mental toughness as unstable,\narising in development, fluctuating over time, and varying for an individual\nperformer between different sport and life scenarios.\n\nThis definitional dilemma plagues the use of the term mental toughness. In\naddition, if mental toughness exists as a valid construct it may on occasion\nbe maladaptive. Evidence to support this contention is derived from a study of\novertraining behaviors and mental toughness. The author reported: \"The results\nsuggest that some attributes of MT may relate to increased ability to recover\nwhereas other attributes are associated with lower recovery... Arguably mental\ntoughness is more closely linked with goal fixedness rather than adaptability\nand a flexible mindset, attributes which are central to resilience.\"^[42]\n\n## Measurement[edit]\n\nTwo instruments have been developed and validated since 2009^[update].\nGucciardi et al. validated the American Football Mental Toughness Inventory\n(AFMTI),^[17] while Sheard and Golby validated the Sports Mental Toughness\nQuestionnaire (SMTQ).^[43] The MTQ48 predates these by seven years. The factor\nstructure of the MTQ48 has been supported by an independent research\ngroup.^[26] Dr Lee Crust, University of Lincoln, compared the SMTQ with the\nMTQ48 and concluded \"Both instruments appear to tap the core components of MT\nbut the MTQ48 seemingly provides a more comprehensive measure\".^[44]\n\nThe MTQ48 questionnaire has demonstrable criterion-related, construct, and\ncontent validity. Reliability has been assessed by numerous independent\nresearchers and it has demonstrable internal consistency and test-retest\nreliability.{^[45] All component scales exceed 0.70 and the overall measure\nhas a reliability in excess of 0.90.^[citation needed]Specifically for self-\nefficacy results show r = .68, p < .01. ^[45] While this is on the higher end,\n(.7) tends to be the standard minimum for research purposes. Nevertheless,\nboth the construct validity and the psychometric properties of this test have\nbeen questioned.^[46]\n\nSeveral other instruments purport to measure mental toughness, but research\nhas called their validity into question. For example, the Performance Profile\nInventory (PPI) developed by Jim Loehr used seven subscales to compute a\nmental toughness score. The Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI) developed by\nMiddleton et al. measures mental toughness using twelve subscales and appears\nto show strong theoretical evidence for its formation. However, construct\nvalidation has only been performed with a narrow sample of athletes, leaving\nits psychometric properties up for debate.^[43]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Hardiness \u2013 in humans, the ability to endure stress without deleterious effects on healthPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n  * Psychological resilience \u2013 Ability to mentally cope with a crisis\n  * Resourcefulness \u2013 definition on Wiktionary\n  * Stress management \u2013 Techniques and therapies to manage stress\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Lin, Ying; Mutz, Julian; Clough, Peter J.; Papageorgiou, Kostas A.
