The effect on society is profound\n\nThis article is more than 5 years old\n\nMaryanne Wolf\n\nWhen the reading brain skims texts, we don\u2019t have time to grasp complexity, to\nunderstand another\u2019s feelings or to perceive beauty. We need a new literacy\nfor the digital age\n\n  * The best of 2018: we\u2019re resurfacing some of our top stories of the past year\n\nShare\n\nLook around on your next plane trip. The iPad is the new pacifier for babies\nand toddlers. Younger school-aged children read stories on smartphones; older\nboys don\u2019t read at all, but hunch over video games. Parents and other\npassengers read on Kindles or skim a flotilla of email and news feeds.\nUnbeknownst to most of us, an invisible, game-changing transformation links\neveryone in this picture: the neuronal circuit that underlies the brain\u2019s\nability to read is subtly, rapidly changing - a change with implications for\neveryone from the pre-reading toddler to the expert adult.\n\nAs work in neurosciences indicates, the acquisition of literacy necessitated a\nnew circuit in our species\u2019 brain more than 6,000 years ago. That circuit\nevolved from a very simple mechanism for decoding basic information, like the\nnumber of goats in one\u2019s herd, to the present, highly elaborated reading\nbrain. My research depicts how the present reading brain enables the\ndevelopment of some of our most important intellectual and affective\nprocesses: internalized knowledge, analogical reasoning, and inference;\nperspective-taking and empathy; critical analysis and the generation of\ninsight. Research surfacing in many parts of the world now cautions that each\nof these essential \u201cdeep reading\u201d processes may be under threat as we move\ninto digital-based modes of reading.\n\nThere\u2019s an old rule in neuroscience that does not alter with age: use it or\nlose it Photograph: Sjale/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThis is not a simple, binary issue of print vs digital reading and\ntechnological innovation. As MIT scholar Sherry Turkle has written, we do not\nerr as a society when we innovate, but when we ignore what we disrupt or\ndiminish while innovating. In this hinge moment between print and digital\ncultures, society needs to confront what is diminishing in the expert reading\ncircuit, what our children and older students are not developing, and what we\ncan do about it.\n\nWe know from research that the reading circuit is not given to human beings\nthrough a genetic blueprint like vision or language; it needs an environment\nto develop. Further, it will adapt to that environment\u2019s requirements \u2013 from\ndifferent writing systems to the characteristics of whatever medium is used.\nIf the dominant medium advantages processes that are fast, multi-task oriented\nand well-suited for large volumes of information, like the current digital\nmedium, so will the reading circuit. As UCLA psychologist Patricia Greenfield\nwrites, the result is that less attention and time will be allocated to\nslower, time-demanding deep reading processes, like inference, critical\nanalysis and empathy, all of which are indispensable to learning at any age.\n\n> The negative effects of screen reading can appear as early as fourth and\n> fifth grade\n\nIncreasing reports from educators and from researchers in psychology and the\nhumanities bear this out. English literature scholar and teacher Mark\nEdmundson describes how many college students actively avoid the classic\nliterature of the 19^th and 20^th centuries because they no longer have the\npatience to read longer, denser, more difficult texts. We should be less\nconcerned with students\u2019 \u201ccognitive impatience,\u201d however, than by what may\nunderlie it: the potential inability of large numbers of students to read with\na level of critical analysis sufficient to comprehend the complexity of\nthought and argument found in more demanding texts, whether in literature and\nscience in college, or in wills, contracts and the deliberately confusing\npublic referendum questions citizens encounter in the voting booth.\n\nMultiple studies show that digital screen use may be causing a variety of\ntroubling downstream effects on reading comprehension in older high school and\ncollege students. In Stavanger, Norway, psychologist Anne Mangen and her\ncolleagues studied how high school students comprehend the same material in\ndifferent mediums. Mangen\u2019s group asked subjects questions about a short story\nwhose plot had universal student appeal (a lust-filled, love story); half of\nthe students read Jenny, Mon Amour on a Kindle, the other half in paperback.\nResults indicated that students who read on print were superior in their\ncomprehension to screen-reading peers, particularly in their ability to\nsequence detail and reconstruct the plot in chronological order.\n\nZiming Liu from San Jose State University has conducted a series of studies\nwhich indicate that the \u201cnew norm\u201d in reading is skimming, with word-spotting\nand browsing through the text. Many readers now use an F or Z pattern when\nreading in which they sample the first line and then word-spot through the\nrest of the text. When the reading brain skims like this, it reduces time\nallocated to deep reading processes. In other words, we don\u2019t have time to\ngrasp complexity, to understand another\u2019s feelings, to perceive beauty, and to\ncreate thoughts of the reader\u2019s own.\n\n\u2018Multiple studies show that digital screen use may be causing a variety of\ntroubling downstream effects on reading.\u2019 Photograph: Westend61/Getty\nImages/Westend61\n\nKarin Littau and Andrew Piper have noted another dimension: physicality.\nPiper, Littau and Anne Mangen\u2019s group emphasize that the sense of touch in\nprint reading adds an important redundancy to information \u2013 a kind of\n\u201cgeometry\u201d to words, and a spatial \u201cthereness\u201d for text. As Piper notes, human\nbeings need a knowledge of where they are in time and space that allows them\nto return to things and learn from re-examination \u2013 what he calls the\n\u201ctechnology of recurrence\u201d. The importance of recurrence for both young and\nolder readers involves the ability to go back, to check and evaluate one\u2019s\nunderstanding of a text. The question, then, is what happens to comprehension\nwhen our youth skim on a screen whose lack of spatial thereness discourages\n\u201clooking back.\u201d\n\nUS media researchers Lisa Guernsey and Michael Levine, American University\u2019s\nlinguist Naomi Baron, and cognitive scientist Tami Katzir from Haifa\nUniversity have examined the effects of different information mediums,\nparticularly on the young. Katzir\u2019s research has found that the negative\neffects of screen reading can appear as early as fourth and fifth grade - with\nimplications not only for comprehension, but also on the growth of empathy.\n\n> We need to cultivate a new kind of brain\n\nThe possibility that critical analysis, empathy and other deep reading\nprocesses could become the unintended \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of our digital\nculture is not a simple binary issue about print vs digital reading. It is\nabout how we all have begun to read on any medium and how that changes not\nonly what we read, but also the purposes for why we read. Nor is it only about\nthe young. The subtle atrophy of critical analysis and empathy affects us all.\nIt affects our ability to navigate a constant bombardment of information. It\nincentivizes a retreat to the most familiar silos of unchecked information,\nwhich require and receive no analysis, leaving us susceptible to false\ninformation and demagoguery.\n\nTo survive our high-speed society, cultivate 'temporal bandwidth' | Alan Jacobs\n\nRead more\n\nThere\u2019s an old rule in neuroscience that does not alter with age: use it or\nlose it. It is a very hopeful principle when applied to critical thought in\nthe reading brain because it implies choice. The story of the changing reading\nbrain is hardly finished. We possess both the science and the technology to\nidentify and redress the changes in how we read before they become entrenched.\nIf we work to understand exactly what we will lose, alongside the\nextraordinary new capacities that the digital world has brought us, there is\nas much reason for excitement as caution.\n\nWe need to cultivate a new kind of brain: a \u201cbi-literate\u201d reading brain\ncapable of the deepest forms of thought in either digital or traditional\nmediums. A great deal hangs on it: the ability of citizens in a vibrant\ndemocracy to try on other perspectives and discern truth; the capacity of our\nchildren and grandchildren to appreciate and create beauty; and the ability in\nourselves to go beyond our present glut of information to reach the knowledge\nand wisdom necessary to sustain a good society.\n\n  * Maryanne Wolf is the Director of the Center for Dyslexia, Diverse Learners, and Social Justice in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Internet\n  * Ideas for America\n  * Psychology\n  * Digital media\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * The Guardian view\n  * Columnists\n  * Cartoons\n  * Opinion videos\n  * Letters\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
