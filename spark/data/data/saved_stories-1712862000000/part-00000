Or rather,\ndifferent authors choose different definitions as the starting point, mainly\nbased on convenience. This isn\u2019t problematic, or even particularly unusual in\nmathematics - as long as we can derive any of the other forms from any\nstarting point, it makes little theoretical difference which we start from as\nthey\u2019re all equivalent anyway.\n\nThe most common starting points are the series definitions, the solution to an\ninitial value problem involving ordinary differential equations, or using\ncomplex numbers as Euler\u2019s formula. You can find detailed descriptions of\nthese on the Wikipedia page. These are all fine starting points as far as they\ngo, and as I said before they are all equivalent.\n\nWhat struck me as odd when I was an undergraduate, and still strikes me to\nthis day, is that none of these are the obvious trigonometric definitions\nabout the opposite and adjacent sides of a right triangle. Aren\u2019t axioms and\ndefinitions supposed to be obvious, so obvious and self-evident they can\u2019t be\ndoubted? So why are we using a highly non-obvious formulation as our\ndefinition, and then backing into the intuitive form as a theorem? The answer\nis actually pretty simple - the proofs are slightly shorter and more elegant\nif we do it that way.\n\nHowever, I never liked this approach because it\u2019s very much like pulling a\nrabbit out of a hat, or perhaps more like pulling a \u201cpreviously prepared\u201d\nturkey out of the oven on a cooking show. It gives students and completely\nbackward impression of how mathematics is done. We don\u2019t start from intuitive\ndefinitions and work on them until we can understand them more deeply or\nconnect them to other structures; no, we simply write down a bizarre and\nunmotivated equation and show it has the desired properties, with no mention\nof how anyone thought it up in the first place. This often leads to shorter,\nmore elegant proofs but at the cost of completely failing to teach the student\nhow to actually \u201cdo\u201d mathematics.\n\nI mean, look at this thing:\n\nsin(x)=\u221e\u2211n=0(\u22121)n(2n+1)!x2n+1\n\nsin(x)=\u2211n=0\u221e(\u22121)n(2n+1)!x2n+1\n\nAnyone who looks at that and says, \u201cyes, that\u2019s a self-evident definition\u201d is\neither lying or Ramanujan.\n\nThe differential equation definition is almost as bad. While the equations\nthemselves are fairly simple:\n\nd2ydt2=\u2212y y(0)=0,y\u2032(0)=1\n\nThe problem is that we have to rely on the ODE existence and uniqueness\ntheorem which is non-trivial to prove; the most common proof involves invoking\nthe Banach fixed point theorem. That seems like a weirdly technical approach\nto defining what should be an elementary concept.\n\nWhat would be nice would be to start from the intuitive, geometric definition:\n\nsin(\u03b8)=oppositehypotenuse cos(\u03b8)=adjacenthypotenuse\n\nand derive the analytic definitions by working forward. I think I\u2019ve found a\nclear and unambiguous way to explain this at the undergraduate level. Briefly,\nwe\u2019ll prove the angle addition formulas using geometric methods, then show how\nthis leads immediately to the other results.\n\nSince we\u2019re interested in establishing a foundation for sine and cosine from\ngeometric principles, we have to establish some ground rules. It\u2019s of crucial\nimportance that you ignore everything you already know about these functions.\nYes, I know you can prove this stuff more easily from Euler\u2019s formula. Yes, I\nknow there a dozen different ways to prove any of these. For the moment,\npretend like you don\u2019t know anything about sine and cosine except the\ngeometric definitions, and we won\u2019t use anything unless we\u2019ve proved it\nearlier. The structure of the proofs will be as follows:\n\nAs the goal is to ground everything on the geometric definition in an easy-to-\nfollow way, jumping ahead and using theorems before we\u2019ve established that\nfoundation defeats the purpose.\n\n## Notation\n\nIn the first draft of this proof, I left points unlabeled and simply referred\nto \u201cthe middle triangle\u201d or the \u201cright angle in the top triangle\u201d and so on.\nThe idea was to keep things simple for a broad audience but I quickly found it\nwas very hard to follow. Instead, we\u2019ll use the conventional notation, which\nI\u2019ll briefly review here.\n\nWe use upper case roman letters such as A or B to label points. The line\nsegment connecting two points is written \u0304AB. The triangle with vertices A, B,\nand C is written \u25b3ABC. Even though the notation symbol shows an equilateral\ntriangle, the triangle in question doesn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ll write \u201cThe right\ntriangle \u25b3ABC\u201d if it\u2019s important to specify that the triangle is a right\ntriangle.\n\nThe above are all fairly self-explanatory, but the last bit of notation can be\nconfusing if you don\u2019t know exactly what it means. To describe the angle at B\nbetween \u0304AB and \u0304BC, we write \u2220ABC.\n\n\u2220ABC is always equal to \u2220CBA, but \u2220BAC or \u2220ACB refer different angles located\nat a different part of the diagram. To locate an angle \u2220ABC in the diagram,\nfirst look for the point labeled with the middle letter B. Then imagine lines\nconnecting B to A and C - the angle referred to is the angle between those\nlines.\n\nI know this notation takes some getting used to, but it allows us to\nunambiguously refer to angles on a cluttered diagram.\n\n## Geometric Proof of Angle Addition Formulas\n\nWe set up the problem by simply stacking two right triangles on top of each\nother.\n\nLet\u2019s define \u0304AB to have a length of 1. \u0304AB is hypotenuse of the right\ntriangle \u25b3ABC. Since the hypotenuse is length 1, the lengths of opposite and\nadjacent sides are simple sin(\u03b2) and cos(\u03b2) respectively.\n\nWe can do the same thing for the triangle \u25b3ACD and angle \u03b1 but with the twist\nthat hypotenuse of this triangle is no longer 1 but instead cos(\u03b2). Therefore,\nthe lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides have to each be multiplied by\ncos(\u03b2).\n\nLet\u2019s add another triangle to our diagram by extending \u0304CD out in a straight\nline and drawing a perpendicular line through the point B. This gives us the\ntriangle BCE. Since \u0304BE is perpendicular to \u0304EC it is in fact a right\ntriangle.\n\nNow, the line \u0304EC is perpendicular to \u0304AB, and the line \u0304BC is perpendicular\nis \u0304AC, so the angle \u2220BCE is the same as the angle \u2220CAD which we called \u03b1.\n\nNow that we know the hypotenuse and one angle of the right triangle \u25b3BCE we\ncan once again use the definitions of sine and cosine to label the lengths of\nthe opposite and adjacent sides.\n\nWe\u2019ll do something similar for the last triangle. We\u2019ll draw a line\nperpendicular to \u0304AD through A and extend it up to point F where it intersects\nthe extension of \u0304BE. \u0304FE and \u0304AD are parallel (because they are both\nperpendicular to \u0304AF) therefore \u2220FBA is equal to \u2220BAD which is the sum of \u03b1\nand \u03b2. So we can label this angle \u03b1+\u03b2. For the fourth and final time, we\u2019ll\nuse the definition of sine and cosine to label opposite and adjacent sides of\nthe right triangle \u25b3FAB. Note that this is where the expressions cos(\u03b1+\u03b2) and\nsin(\u03b1+\u03b2) enter the proof.\n\nSo far, everything has been construction - adding triangles and chasing angles\nto label edge lengths. But now the diagram is complete, and we can easily read\noff the angle addition formulas by equating opposite sides. Note that FEAD\nforms a rectangle; \u0304FE and \u0304AD are parallel which proves \u0304AF and \u0304DE are\nequal; likewise \u0304AF and \u0304ED are parallel, which proves \u0304FE and \u0304AD are equal.\nAll we have to do now is equate opposite pairs of sides:\n\ncos(\u03b1+\u03b2)+sin(\u03b1)sin(\u03b2)=cos(\u03b1)cos(\u03b2) sin(\u03b1+\u03b2)=sin(\u03b1)cos(\u03b2)+cos(\u03b1)sin(\u03b2)\n\nFinally, we rearrange these slightly to put them in the canonical form of the\nangle addition formulas:\n\ncos(\u03b1+\u03b2)=cos(\u03b1)cos(\u03b2)\u2212sin(\u03b1)sin(\u03b2) sin(\u03b1+\u03b2)=sin(\u03b1)cos(\u03b2)+cos(\u03b1)sin(\u03b2)\n\n## Pythagorean Theorem\n\nOK, now that we have the angle addition formulas, let\u2019s put them to work.\n\nFirst, we\u2019d like sine and cosine to trace out a unit circle; in other words,\nwe want to make sure that sin2(\u03b8)+cos2(\u03b8) for all angles \u03b8.\n\nThere are lots of ways to prove this, but the angle addition formula provides\none of the neatest approaches. Instead of adding two separate angles \u03b1 and \u03b2,\nwe\u2019ll use \u03b8 and \u2212\u03b8. These two sum to zero so we have:\n\n1=cos(0) =cos(\u03b8\u2212\u03b8) =cos(\u03b8)cos(\u2212\u03b8)\u2212sin(\u03b8)sin(\u2212\u03b8) =cos(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8)+sin(\u03b8)sin(\u03b8)\n=cos2(\u03b8)+sin2(\u03b8)\n\nHere, we additionally used the fact that sine and cosine are odd and even\nfunctions respectively, so cos(\u2212x)=cos(x) and sin(\u2212x)=\u2212sin(x).\n\nThat means that the Pythagorean theorem is actually an immediate corollary of\nthe angle addition formula for cosine.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAnother neat thing we can do with the angle addition formulas is calculate the\nderivatives of sine and cosine. This is because the limit definition of\nderivative includes a term with f(x+h) which we can handle with the formulas.\n\nddxsin(x)=limh\u21920sin(x+h)\u2212sin(x)h\n\n=limh\u21920sin(x)cos(h)+cos(x)sin(h)\u2212sin(x)h\n\nBy considering a triangle with hypotenuse 1 and a very small \u201copposite\u201d side,\nit\u2019s not hard to see geometrically that sin(x)\u2248x and cos(h)=x when x is small,\nso we have:\n\nddxsin(x)=limh\u21920sin(x)+cos(x)h\u2212sin(x)h\n\n=limh\u21920cos(x)hh\n\n=cos(x)\n\nThe equivalent argument for cos(x) is:\n\nddxcos(x)=limh\u21920cos(x+h)\u2212cos(x)h\n\n=limh\u21920cos(x)cos(h)\u2212sin(x)sin(h)\u2212cos(x)h\n\n=limh\u21920cos(x)\u2212sin(x)h\u2212cos(x)h\n\n=limh\u21920\u2212sin(x)hh\n\n=\u2212sin(x)\n\nOnce we know these first derivatives, computing higher derivates is simple,\nfor example:\n\nd2dx2sin(x)=ddxcos(x)=\u2212sin(x)\n\nd2dx2cos(x)=ddx\u2212sin(x)=\u2212cos(x)\n\nWith just these second derivatives, we can already motivate the initial value\nproblem ODE definition of sine and cosine.\n\nIt\u2019s equally obvious that we can continue the process indefinitely,\nalternating between sine and cosine. Since we know sin(0)=0 and cos(0)=1, we\ncan evaluate all derivatives of sine and cosine at zero, allowing us to\ncalculate the Maclaurin series. This gives us the series form.\n\n## Arc Length\n\nThe above shows that sine and cosine trace out a unit circle, but there is one\nfinal thing we need to show to fully connect the geometric and analytic\ndefinitions.\n\nThe formula for arc length is:\n\nL=\u222bba\u221a(dxdt)2+(dydt)2dt\n\nLet\u2019s write down the equations for the unit circle in parametric form.\nLuckily, we already worked out the first derivatives: x(t)=cos(t),dxdt=\u2212sin(t)\n\ny(t)=sin(t),dydt=cos(t)\n\nThen, substituting these into the arc length formula:\nL=\u222b\u03b80\u221a(\u2212sin(t))2+(cos(t))2dt\n\nSimplifying inside the square root: L=\u222b\u03b80\u221asin2(t)+cos2(t)dt\n\nSince we showed above that sin2(t)+cos2(t)=1 for all t, this further\nsimplifies to: L=\u222b\u03b801dt\n\nIntegrating from 0 to \u03b8: L=t|\u03b80=\u03b8\u22120=\u03b8\n\nThis tells us that the parameter t we used is equal to the arc length along\nthe unit circle; in other words, the angle expressed in radians.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve shown that all of usual definitions of sine and cosine can be derived\nfrom the geometric definition, and that this can be made elementary if we\nstart by proving the angle addition formulas using geometric arguments. The\ngeometric proof itself is quite beautiful and easy to remember as it is simply\na matter of stacking two triangles, building a rectangle around them, and\nequating the opposing sides. We offer this as a more pedagogically sound and\nhistorical accurate way to motivate the various definitions of sine and\ncosine.\n\n  * < Newer\n  * Older >\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 Oran Looney\n\nPowered by Hugo\n\n", "frontpage": true}
