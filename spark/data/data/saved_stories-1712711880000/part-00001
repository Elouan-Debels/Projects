(Source photos by Reuters and Microsoft)\n\nNAOKI WATANABE, Nikkei staff writerApril 9, 2024 19:01 JST | Japan\n\nCopyCopied\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif. -- Microsoft will invest $2.9 billion in data centers in\nJapan by 2025, its biggest investment in the country, President Brad Smith\ntold Nikkei in an exclusive interview, in response to Tokyo's push for more\ncomputing power for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe U.S. tech group will announce its investment plans in the coming hours, at\na time when the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is visiting Washington.\n\nSmith said the adoption of AI, and investments in domestic capability, has\nbecome \"a critical national priority for governments around the world.\"\n\nTokyo is introducing measures to add more AI computing power in the country,\namid concerns about domestic data being transferred and stored in overseas\ndata centers.\n\nMicrosoft will install advanced AI semiconductors at two existing sites in\neastern and western Japan. Microsoft is the No. 2 provider of cloud services\nin the world, behind Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company also plans to announce an AI-related reskilling program in Japan\nto train 3 million workers over three years, and to set up a new lab in Tokyo\nfor research and development on robotics and AI.\n\n\"The competitiveness of every part of the Japanese economy ... will depend on\nthe adoption of AI,\" Smith said, adding that AI is essential to \"sustain\nproductivity growth, even when a country has a declining population.\"\n\nThe new lab will be set up by Microsoft Research Asia, which will provide 1.5\nbillion yen ($9.9 million) to both the University of Tokyo and a partnership\nbetween Keio University and Carnegie Mellon University to fund research\nprojects over the next five years.\n\nSmith said that infusing AI into robotic development \"gives Japan the\nopportunity to build on its technological strengths in many other areas,\"\nrevealing a plan to conduct joint research with universities on automation\ntechnology.\n\nMicrosoft will also partner with the Japanese government to strengthen\ncybersecurity resilience.\n\nSmith said, \"The threat landscape for cybersecurity has become more\nchallenging ... We're seeing that from China and from Russia in particular,\nbut we're also seeing growing ransomware activity around the world.\" He\npointed out that \"a close partnership between leading tech companies and the\ngovernment\" is one of the keys for protecting cyberspace.\n\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI released its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, which touched\noff a global frenzy on generative AI. There has been a growing demand for\nlarge language models, a foundational technology for services such as ChatGPT,\non cloud platforms.\n\nGovernments are increasingly claiming \"data sovereignty,\" which implies that a\ncountry's data should be managed domestically, amid security and privacy\nconcerns.\n\nTokyo has restricted the transfer of personal data to overseas data centers,\nwhich led to cloud platforms like AWS and Google announcing bigger investments\nin data centers in Japan.\n\nWhile the U.S. has taken the lead in developing generative AI, other countries\nare trying to catch up with their own domestic versions of the technology.\nJapan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry has launched a program to\nsupport domestic development. France's Mistral AI, founded by former employees\nof Facebook parent Meta, has grown rapidly, while the United Arab Emirates is\ndeveloping its own AI.\n\nRecently, the European Parliament has passed a law regulating the use of AI\nand tightening its grip on the big tech groups.\n\nSmith said that \"Japan has played an important leadership role,\" including in\n\"helping to connect the U.S. and the U.K., Canada, and the EU all together.\"\nHe voiced hopes to the Japanese government, which led the Hiroshima AI Process\nat the Group of Seven summit in 2023, that it would coordinate the efforts of\nthese economies to develop AI rules.\n\n\"From our vantage point, this kind of investment ... fits very closely with\nwhat we see in terms of the role of the government itself,\" he said.\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * Technology\n\n#### OpenAI to open its first Asia office in Tokyo this month\n\n  * Technology\n\n#### Japan, U.S. team up on generative AI to modernize research\n\n  * Technology\n\n#### TSMC founder Morris Chang predicts Japan 'chip renaissance'\n\n  * Technology\n\n#### Amazon to invest $15bn in Japan over 5 years, topping funds for India\n\n  * The Big Story\n\n#### Japan's chip reboot: TSMC, Samsung, Micron pave way for silicon revival\n\n  * Defense\n\n#### Japan and five Pacific Islands countries plan cyberdefense drill\n\n## Latest On Companies\n\n  * Companies\n\n#### Konica Minolta cuts 2,400 jobs as demand for office printing wanes\n\n  * Companies\n\n#### Berkshire Hathaway-backed Japan trading house boosts shareholder returns\n\n  * Companies\n\n#### Japan company beats 'bad-faith' trademark filer in Chinese court\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n### About Sponsored Content This content was commissioned by Nikkei's Global\nBusiness Bureau.\n\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\n\n#### Get Insights on Asia in your inbox\n\nRegister for our newsletters\n\n#### Connect With Us\n\nNikkei Inc.
