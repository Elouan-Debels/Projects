I. Rosenbaum\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic.

That summer, after he recovered, he\nreturned to the string quartet he\u2019d been writing before his illness\u2014Quartet\nNo. 15 in A Minor, Op. 132\u2014and added a new segment inspired by his survival.\nTo this day, the piece is known for the slowly unfolding, baffled joy of its\nthird movement, where the music seems to trace the shuffling steps of an\ninvalid breathing fresh air for the first time in weeks. Beethoven would call\nit Heiliger Dankgesang, a \u201choly song of thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nHe wrote in the mornings when the light was good, on rag paper thick enough\nthat he could scrape off mistakes with a knife. His handwriting was\nnotoriously chaotic: He couldn\u2019t draw a set of parallel lines if his life\ndepended on it. The maestro is said to have used his pencil not only to write\nwith, but also to feel the vibrations of his piano, pressing one end of the\nwooden rod to the instrument while holding the other end between his teeth. He\nwas by now profoundly deaf; in less than two years, he would be dead.\n\nOnce he finished a composition, Beethoven would hand off the manuscript to a\ncopyist, who\u2019d write it all out again, this time legibly. After Beethoven\ncorrected any mistakes the copyist made\u2014berating the man the whole time\u2014the\nscore would go to a publishing house where, after more last-minute changes\nfrom the composer, an engraver would trace it, backwards, onto a copper sheet.\nFrom there, the score would be published and republished, appearing in largely\nthe same form on music stands across the world even to this day.\n\nBut even discounting those final revisions, the Opus 132 that the world came\nto know was not exactly the Opus 132 that Beethoven handed to his copyist. The\ncomposer littered his original score with unusual markings that the copyist\nsimply ignored. Below one staff, for example, Beethoven jotted \u201cffmo\u201d\u2014a tag\nthat wasn\u2019t a standard part of musical notation, and wasn't used by any other\nmajor composer. In another place, he drew an odd shape like an elongated\ndiamond, also a nonstandard notation. None of these marks made it into even\nthe first clean copy, let alone the published version. Almost no one would see\nthose marks in the roughly 200 years after Beethoven first scribbled them\ndown.\n\nThen, one evening in 2013, the violinist Nicholas Kitchen was in New Mexico\ncoaching a quartet through Opus 132. Kitchen is a man of obsessions; one of\nthem is playing from a composer\u2019s original handwritten manuscripts, rather\nthan printed music, so he had a facsimile edition on hand. The errant \u201cffmo\u201d\ncaught the eye of the quartet\u2019s cellist. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked.\n\nAs soon as Kitchen saw Beethoven\u2019s mark, something in his brain shifted;\nlater, he would tell people that it was as if someone had turned over a deck\nof cards to reveal the hidden faces behind the plain backs. Suddenly, he had a\nnew obsession. Over the next several years, he would come to believe he had\ndiscovered Beethoven\u2019s secret code.\n\nFor most of the past two centuries, Beethoven\u2019s original handwritten\nmanuscripts have been difficult, if not impossible, for musicians to access.\nFew could afford a trip to view them at archives in Vienna or Berlin, and\nfacsimile editions were prohibitively expensive. Scholars hadn\u2019t bothered\ntaking a look: By the time musicology arose as a discipline, Beethoven was\nseen as pass\u00e9, says Lewis Lockwood, a Harvard professor emeritus and co-\ndirector of the Boston University Center for Beethoven Research. \u201cThere is no\narmy of Beethoven scholars,\u201d Lockwood told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny field ... terra\nincognita.\u201d\n\nKitchen is not a scholar. A boyish 57-year-old with a shock of bushy white\nhair, he\u2019s a working musician and a faculty member at New England\nConservatory, where my parents also taught. The Boston classical-music world\nis a small one\u2014almost everyone I interviewed for this story is friendly with\nmy violist mother and pianist father\u2014and Kitchen is well known and well\nrespected in those circles. Prior to reporting this story, I\u2019d heard him\nperform with his quartet many times, although I didn\u2019t know him personally.\n\nThat said, I was aware that Kitchen had a bit of a reputation as, if not an\neccentric, at least an enthusiastic innovator. Around 2007 he persuaded the\nensemble he co-founded, the Borromeo Quartet, to play from full scores instead\nof parts, because he felt it enriched the performance. A full score doesn\u2019t\nfit on a music stand, so the group was among the first to play from laptops,\nand later iPads, in performance.\n\nAround the same time, scans of Beethoven manuscripts began to appear on a wiki\nsite for musicians called the International Music Score Library Project. The\nonly thing better than playing from a full score, Kitchen believed, was\nplaying from a handwritten original full score\u2014the closest glimpse possible of\nthe composer\u2019s working mind. \u201cJust by reading the manuscript, you are\ninstantly exposed to an archaeology of ideas,\u201d Kitchen told me. \u201cYou\u2019re\ntracing what was crossed out\u2014an option tried and not used, one tried and\nrefused, then brought back\u2014all these processes that are instantly visible.\u201d\n\nThe more Kitchen played directly from Beethoven\u2019s chaotic handwriting, the\nmore anomalous notations he found. Initially, Kitchen didn\u2019t know what to make\nof them. \u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Well, it may be the equivalent of a doodle,\u2019\u201d\nhe said. But once he began to study Beethoven\u2019s scores more systematically, he\nrealized just how prevalent\u2014and how consistent\u2014many of these strange markings\nwere across the composer\u2019s 25 years of work.\n\nKitchen began to develop a theory about what he was seeing. The marks mostly\nseemed to concern intensity. Some appeared to indicate extra forcefulness:\nBeethoven used the standard f and ff for forte, \u201cloud,\u201d and fortissimo, \u201cvery\nloud,\u201d but also sometimes wrote ffmo or fff. He occasionally underlined the\nstandard p or pp for piano and pianissimo, \u201csoft\u201d and \u201cvery soft,\u201d as if\nemphasizing them.\n\nKitchen would eventually identify 23 degrees of dynamics (and counting), from\nfff\u2014thunderous\u2014to ppp\u2014a whisper. He found four kinds of staccato, two kinds of\ndynamic swells, marks to indicate different ways of grouping notes together,\nmarks to reinforce crescendos and diminuendos. Taken together, Kitchen argued,\nthese marks amount to \u201cliving instructions from one virtuoso performer to\nanother,\u201d an elaborate hidden language conveying new levels of expression\u2014and\nthus emotion\u2014in Beethoven\u2019s music that had been lost for centuries.\n\nWhenever people have tried to invent a way of writing music down, the solution\nhas been imperfect. Jewish, Vedic, Buddhist, and Christian traditions all\nsearched for ways to keep sacred melodies from mutating over time; each ended\nup inventing a set of symbols for different musical phrases, which worked as\nlong as you already knew all the phrases. Other cultures evolved away from\nnotation. In classical Indian music, for example, every soloist\u2019s performance\nis meant to be improvised and unrepeatable.\n\nIn Europe, however, musical values began to emphasize not spontaneity but\npolyphony: ever more complex harmony and counterpoint performed by ever larger\nensembles. For these ensembles to play together, they needed some kind of\nvisual graph to coordinate who plays what when. The result evolved into the\nnotation system in global use today\u2014an extraordinarily lossless information-\ncompression technology, unique in its capacity to precisely record even music\nthat has never been played, only imagined. Orchestras in Beethoven\u2019s time, as\nwell as now, needed only the score to play something remarkably similar to\nwhat the composer heard in their mind. It\u2019s as close as humans have come,\nperhaps, to telepathy.\n\nBy Beethoven\u2019s time, composers had developed ways to communicate not just\npitch, duration, and tempo, but the emotion they wanted their music to evoke.\nDynamic markings shaped like hairpins indicated when the music should swell\nand when it should ebb. A corpus of Italian words such as andante, dolce, and\nvivace became technical terms to guide the musician\u2019s performance. The effect\nwas a lot like the old religious systems: If you already knew how andante was\nsupposed to sound, then you knew how to play something marked andante. But\ncompared with the rest of the notation system, such descriptions are\nsubjective. How passionate is appassionato, exactly?\n\nSomeone like Beethoven, a man of extreme moods, might very well have chafed\nagainst these restraints. It\u2019s not a stretch to conclude, as Kitchen has, that\nBeethoven would feel the need to invent a method of more perfectly conveying\nhow he intended his music to be played.\n\nBut whether Kitchen is correct remains up for debate. Jonathan Del Mar, a\nBeethoven scholar who has worked extensively with the composer\u2019s manuscripts,\ntold me in an email that any anomalous marks in Beethoven\u2019s manuscripts were\nmerely \u201ccosmetic variants\u201d of standard notations. Beethoven was a stickler for\nprecision, Del Mar explained, especially when it came to his music, and if\nhe\u2019d cared about these marks, he would have made sure they appeared in the\npublished versions. \u201cI am absolutely convinced that, indeed, no difference of\nmeaning was intended,\u201d Del Mar wrote.\n\nJeremy Yudkin, Lockwood\u2019s co-director at the Center for Beethoven Studies,\nalso initially viewed Kitchen with skepticism. \u201cWhen I first talked to him, I\nthought he was nuts,\u201d Yudkin told me. But Kitchen\u2019s close and careful research\nwon him over. Yudkin now believes that Kitchen has discovered a previously\nunknown layer of meaning in Beethoven\u2019s manuscripts: \u201cThere are gradations of\nexpression, a vast spectrum of expression, that music scholars and performers\nought to take into account,\u201d he said.\n\nAs to why the marks never made it into the composer\u2019s printed scores, Yudkin\nthinks Beethoven may have accepted that his large personal vocabulary of\nsymbols and abbreviations wouldn\u2019t be easily deciphered by others. Perhaps,\nYudkin suggested, he included the marks in his manuscripts simply for his own\nsatisfaction. \u201cYou put things in a diary,\u201d Yudkin said, because it yields \u201ca\nmental satisfaction and emotional satisfaction in being able to express what\nit is that you feel. And no one else has to see it.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, Kitchen and the Borromeo Quartet have presented a\nseries of Beethoven concerts prefaced by brief lectures on his findings, but\nother than that, and his presentations at BU, he hasn\u2019t spent much time\nsharing his ideas with the world. Instead, he\u2019s been preparing his own set of\nBeethoven scores that will include all the marks left out of earlier editions.\nHe wants other musicians to be able to see them easily, without needing to\ndecipher Beethoven\u2019s scrawl. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople can argue about all\nthose things as much as they want.\u201d\n\nAs I was working on this story, I asked my father, the pianist, why he thought\nWestern notation had developed to such specificity, even before Beethoven\u2019s\ntime. He told me he thought it was because of a change in composers\u2019\nperspective: Where before they\u2019d been composing anonymously for the Church, as\nmusic became more secular, composers\u2019 names became more prominent. \u201cThey\nstarted to think about how people would play their work after their deaths,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nFor Kitchen, that\u2019s precisely the point of studying Beethoven\u2019s markings. If\nwritten notation can encode music, he told me, music can encode human\nfeelings. Therefore, written music can actually transplant \u201ca living emotion\u201d\nfrom one mind to another. It\u2019s not just telepathy: Music allows a sliver of\nimmortality.\n\nAt this point, Kitchen believes he knows the code well enough that he can hear\nit in music. Once, at a concert in Hong Kong, he was listening to a\nperformance of Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonata No. 23 in F Minor, Op. 57\u2014the\n\u201cAppassionata.\u201d He noticed an unstable chord that seemed especially ominous\nand unsettling\u2014the kind of quiet but emotionally powerful moment that\nBeethoven often noted with one of his bespoke abbreviations.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I bet you that\u2019s a two-line pianissimo,\u2019\u201d Kitchen recalled. After\nthe performance, he checked. Sure enough: Scrawled below the disconcerting\nbass note troubling the otherwise serene chord, Beethoven had written a\ndouble-underlined pp. Two hundred years later, maybe Kitchen finally\nunderstood exactly what he\u2019d meant.\n\nS.I.
