A powerful, very custom, TI\nmanufactured chip.\n\nBut the ACE3 does more than just handle USB power delivery: It's a full\nmicrocontroller running a full USB stack connected to some of the internal\nbusses of the device, and is responsible for providing access to JTAG of the\napplication processor, the internal SPMI bus, etc. Previous variants of the\nACE, namely the ACE2 found in MacBooks, could easily be dumped and analyzed\nusing SWD and even be persistently backdoored through a software vulnerability\nwe found.\n\nOn the ACE3 however, Apple upped their game: Firmware updates are personalized\nto the device, debug interfaces seem to be disabled, and the external flash is\nvalidated and does not contain all the firmware. However using a combination\nof reverse-engineering, RF side-channel analysis and electro-magnetic fault-\ninjection it was possible to gain code-execution on the ACE3 - allowing\ndumping of the ROM, and analysis of the functionality.\n\nThis talk will show how to use a combination of hardware, firmware, reverse-\nengineering, side-channel analysis and fault-injection to gain code-execution\non a completely custom chip, enabling further security research on an under-\nexplored but security relevant part of Apple devices.\n\n### BIO\n\nThomas Roth aka stacksmashing is a security researcher mostly focused on\nhardware and firmware. His work includes hardware attacks on processors,\nmicrocontrollers and cryptocurrency wallets, building cheap JTAG tooling for\nthe iPhone, and attacking a wide variety of embedded devices.\n\nHe also runs a YouTube channel called stacksmashing about security, reverse\nengineering and hardware hacking.\n\n#### Organized by\n\n#### Diamond Sponsor\n\n  * twitter.com/offensive_con\n  * youtube.com/c/offensivecon\n\n  * Imprint\n  * Terms\n  * Code of Conduct\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Contact\n\n# Services we would like to use\n\nThis website uses services to provide you with an optimal website experience.\nThis includes services that are necessary for the operation of the site and\nits security, as well as those used for other purposes.
