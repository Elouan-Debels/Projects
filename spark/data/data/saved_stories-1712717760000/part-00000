The\nspacecraft, which entered lunar orbit in December 2022, is designed to help\nplan future missions to the lunar poles. It was also used to demonstrate a\n\"lunar internet,\" which is a delay-tolerant network that could one day allow\nlanded assets to communicate with Earth.\n\nScientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center \"needed exquisite timing in\npointing LROC to the right place at the right time to catch a glimpse of\nDanuri,\" per NASA.\n\nThe reason why Danuri appears as a tiny sliver \u2014 rather than a conventional-\nlooking spacecraft with two solar panels and an antenna \u2014 is because the LRO's\ncamera exposure time was extremely short at just 0.338 milliseconds. As a\nresult, Danuri appears \"smeared to ten times its size in the opposite\ndirection of travel because of the relative high travel velocities between the\ntwo spacecraft,\" according to NASA.\n\nApart from freezing an orbiting spacecraft in time, the LRO has also spotted\nremains of crashed lunar landers. Earlier this year, it even shot and bounced\na laser off India's Vikram lander in an effort to improve future landers'\npositioning systems.\n\nLast year, Danuri's NASA-developed ShadowCam spotted the LRO in a perfect role\nswap, showing the spacecraft's behind perfectly reflecting the Sun's rays.\n\nMore on the LRO: NASA Probe Shoots Indian Moon Lander With Laser\n\nShare This Article\n\nWater Off Boeing's Back\n\nCommander of First Boeing Astronaut Launch Issues Warning\n\nMar 27, 11:56 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nSpace Fireworks\n\nNASA Experiment With Fire in Space Ends When Entire Spacecraft Burns Up\n\nFeb 16, 9:22 AM EST\n\nRead More\n\nBudget Cuts\n\nMars Sample Return in Trouble After Mass NASA Layoffs\n\nFeb 7, 1:09 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\nSearching for Biosignatures\n\nExperts Push Back Against Rumors of James Webb Life Detection\n\nJan 17, 4:33 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
