Unstructured data sources pertaining to\n> sports are available in various places such as blogs, social media posts,\n> and online news articles. Sports visualization methods either not fully\n> exploited the information present in these sources or the proposed\n> visualizations through the use of these sources did not augment to the body\n> of sports visualization methods. We propose the use of unstructured data,\n> namely cricket short text commentary for visualization. The short text\n> commentary data is used for constructing individual player's strength rules\n> and weakness rules. A computationally feasible definition for player's\n> strength rule and weakness rule is proposed. A visualization method for the\n> constructed rules is presented. In addition, players having similar strength\n> rules or weakness rules is computed and visualized. We demonstrate the\n> usefulness of short text commentary in visualization by analyzing the\n> strengths and weaknesses of cricket players using more than one million text\n> commentaries. We validate the constructed rules through two validation\n> methods. The collected data, source code, and obtained results on more than\n> 500 players are made publicly available.\n\nSubjects:| Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nACM classes:| I.2.7  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.00030 [cs.HC]  \n(or arXiv:2404.00030v1 [cs.HC] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.00030arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Swarup Ranjan Behera [view email] [v1] Fri, 22 Mar 2024 07:13:10 UTC\n(1,241 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Visualization of Unstructured Sports Data -- An\nExample of Cricket Short Text Commentary, by Swarup Ranjan Behera and Vijaya V\nSaradhi\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.HC\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
