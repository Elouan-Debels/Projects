What would we make of the journey that we would have to take to get\nfrom line 1 to line 2? How would we relate the opening request with the final\nfact and then connect these in turn to a larger tradition of myth? One might\nnaturally assume that the former leads to the latter in a causal fashion, but\nthere\u2019s no necessary reason to posit that.\n\nThere\u2019s an openness, though, to both lines. The initial invocation asks for a\nstory to be told; the final one offers a scene in process: the imperfect tense\nof the verb \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd shows an action that is ongoing but not yet complete, it\nleaves the audience with the sense that more is still to come, that the final\nword has not actually been spoken. This certainly functions to mark the epic\nas part of a larger story cycle, just as the imperfect in line 1.7 (\u0394\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b4'\n\u1f10\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae) indicates that the Iliad is part of a larger process, a\ncosmic narrative arc.\n\nYet, without external evidence, each name is merely an empty sign waiting to\nbe filled, a story needing to be told. But we have the whole poem. We can\nfollow from line 1.1 to 24.804. And we still likely ask why the Iliad ends\nwith the burial of Hektor, tamer of horses. Ancient scholars had a range of\nless than satisfactory answers. The scholia record that a scholar named\nMenekrates believed that Homer was silent about the events after Hektor\nbecause \u201che sensed his own weakness and inability to tell the events in the\nsame way\u201d (Schol. bT ad. Hom. Il. 21.804). Another claims that some modified\nthe final line:\n\nShare\n\nSchol. T ad. Hom. Il. 21.804a\n\n> \u201cSome people write \u201cand so they were completing the burial of Hektor.

Even if a performer\nwould segue from an Iliad to an Aithiopis, we still face the fact that each\nwas felt to be a unitary and individualizable narrative. So, here are some\nother reasons why the Iliad ends as it does.\n\n1.\u2018Epic\u2019 time is different from normal narrative time: it is more like a time\nloop in modern science fiction. All the main events always happen and have\nalready always happened, but there\u2019s room for variation in the journey between\nthem. This occupies a place between what we might clumsily call \u201critual time\u201d\nand a causal narrative chain. For the former, I have in mind the narrative\ncycle of a liturgical calendar where congregants/audiences are treated to the\nsame stories at the same part of the year. The stories never change because\nthey have happened and must happen the same, but our experiences of them\nchange as we move from one repetition to another. For the latter, the logic of\ncausation is imposed through the repetition of the same basic events, but by\nfinding space in the interstices to tell different stories, audiences explore\nthe dynamic interaction between determinism and agency, between accepting what\none cannot change and being empowered to alter what one can.\n\n2.The city has already been destroyed in the imaginations of the characters\nand the audience. Following on the immutable layering of epic time, Iliadic\nnarrative refers to canonical events of the Trojan War but mostly moves around\nthem: the judgment of Paris, the abduction of Helen, the marshaling of the\narmies, the sacrifice of Iphigenia, the sack of the city, and other events all\nexist on the periphery, at times marginalized to such an extent that scholars\ncan doubt whether or not the Homeric epics appeal to them. At the same time,\nthe Iliad appropriates and reperforms moments from the larger tale that should\nnot be part if its tale, engaging in a creative anachronism that manages to\nplace the catalogue of ships, the teikhoskopia, the duel over Helen, and the\nbuilding of Achaean fortifications between Achilles\u2019 falling out with\nAgamemnon and the embassy to try to resolve the spat.\n\nThe Iliad reshuffles the deck of mythical time both to assert the supremacy of\nits story and to show that no series of events, no causal chain, can alter the\noutcome of the overall narrative. This is theological in the cosmic sense:\nnotions like Zeus\u2019 plan and the double determination (when the narrative shows\nthe gods \u2018causing\u2019 an action but also features mortals choosing to act without\nknowledge of divine will) underscores the complexity of causation and the\ninscrutability of single efficient causes. At the same time, such shuffling is\nevocative of human cognition, the way we understand and retain basic concepts\nof beginning and ending but can lose track of intermediary steps.\n\nShare\n\n3.Achilles has already died. In a way, this is no different than the previous\npoint, but it is important enough to emphasize again. The Iliad does not\nmerely deal out the deck of myth in a different order, it redraws the images\non the most important cards to achieve similar ends. Achilles dies through\nPatroklos\u2014his physical death is disassembled and re-used in book 11 and then\nbook 16, anticipated in books 18, 19, 22, 23, and 24, but never performed\nbecause it has already been achieved. Just as the city is destroyed in the\nwords of Hektor, Andromache, Priam, and Hecuba, so too is Achilles\u2019 death\nportrayed through Patroklos\u2019 surrogacy and the divine and mortal speeches that\nanticipate it.\n\n4.Hektor\u2019s death may be more important than Achilles\u2019. As I have mentioned\nbefore, the Iliad takes part in an etiological (that is, explanatory) arc that\nmoves from the dios boul\u00ea, Zeus\u2019 plan to rid the world of the race of heroes,\nto an era when the realms of gods and men are more thoroughly distinct. While\nthe Odyssey more-or-less completes this journey toward Hesiod\u2019s Works and\nDays, where human beings toil distant from tangible divine favor or aid, the\nIliad moves audiences from the twin rages of Achilles and Apollo in book 1\n(where they are both upset at Agamemnon) to Apollo\u2019s anger at Achilles for his\ntreatment of Hektor in book 24. Apollo\u2014much to Hera\u2019s surprise\u2014takes the side\nof a non-divine mortal for the rite of burial against one closer to his own\nkin.\n\nAlong the way, we see the widening distance between divine knowledge and human\nknowledge\u2014the whole motif of double determination, whereby we as audience\nmembers see the gods and mortals as understanding different levels of\ncausation for a given action. The repeated toggling between divine\nintervention paired with human decisions shows us separate worlds, even\nseparate realities or dimensions whose entanglement does little more than\nincrease damage and pain to one another. It is almost as if the Iliad attests\nto a time when the fabric between two different realities was thin enough to\nbe permeable and that it shows us how perilous it is when beings from one\nrealm meddle with events in another. The world of the gods was overturned by\nthe silly decision of one man (Paris!); the mortal plain roils with each\noutsized, overwrought divine act. The steady movement towards emphasizing the\nhonor of mortals in death and the separation of gods and humans both justifies\nand supports the way the world is for mortals and suggests rather strongly\nthat it is better this way.\n\n5.Hektor\u2019s burial is the end of an era. And also a beginning. Hektor is\ndifferent from Achilles as a full-mortal and as a \u2018family\u2019 man. By ending with\nhis burial rather than the fall of the city or the funeral games for Achilles,\nthe Iliad elevates his importance and closes out the race of heroes by\nencapsulating a different series of values in this one fallible man. Hektor is\nfar from perfect throughout the epic: he struggles to understand his role in\nleading the city, he blusters and glowers when things don\u2019t go his way, and he\nis shown to be in the framework of Achilles and Diomedes somewhat un-heroic in\nhis final moments. But the laments that follow his death in books 22 and\n24\u2014cast against the obscenity of Achilles\u2019 treatment of his body\u2014double down\non the importance of his unheroic character as a son, father, and a man whose\nkindness towards the most hated woman in the world and the cause of all his\ntroubles is so incredible that scholars have speculated he was under the spell\nof her charisma. Hektor\u2019s inconsistencies and internal contradictions form a\ncounterpoint to Achilles\u2019. In a universe where even the gods are churlish and\nquick-to-rage, what kinds of excess should we be grateful for in a man?\n\n6.Hektor\u2019s burial may also be self-reflective for epic poetry. As I mentioned\nabove, the tense/aspect of the verb performing Hektor\u2019s burial is incomplete,\nand ongoing ( \u0314\u0300\u03a9\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f35 \u03b3' \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd \u0314\u0301\u0395\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf). The Iliad\ndoesn\u2019t so much end as fade away, to black as in the end of the final episode\nof the Sopranos. The process of burying Hektor remains ongoing as the poem\nends, as we all continue to engage in its continuation through sharing in his\nmemory. But I think the process, the imperfectivity goes farther than this.\n\nThe process of the burial is the beginning of enshrining Hektor\u2019s memory and\ncreating his kleos. But this may also be an example of an unnoticed ekphrasis.\nWhile the tomb itself is not the creation of a work of art like Achilles\u2019\nshield, it is still the execution of a physical craft described within an\noral/written artform. As such it may contain an implicit comparison between\nthe practice of burial and the art of epic poetry.\n\nHomer, Il. 24.797\u2013800\n\n> \u201cThey quickly placed the bones in an empty trench and then They covered it\n> with great, well-fitted stones.

There\nhe imagines that, once he had won the contest, the dead hero\u2019s tomb would be a\nmonument to, and sign of, his everlasting glory. Ironically, the dead hero\u2019s\ntomb turns out to be his, once the Trojans construct it at the epic's end\n\nBut what kind of sign is it? Homer describes how the Trojans\u2019 burial mound for\nHector leaves \u2018a mark\u2019\u2014the word here is s\u00eama (from which we get the words\n\u2018semantics\u2019 or \u2018semaphore\u2019), and also means a sign or symbol. In the end,\nthen, the epic leaves us with a symbol of some kind that I think points back\nto this epic itself. Ostensibly, of course, that is Hector\u2019s burial mound, a\nphysical marker of his fame\u2014and as a metonym it stands for the fame of all the\nheroes who fought at Troy. Yet, its immediate referent, the physical thing it\ndescribes, is a \u2018hollow grave\u2019 (koil\u00ean kapeton).\n\nAn English speaker might wonder whether or not the hollowness of the grave\nmarks some sort of empty meaning and thus offers some judgment on the vanity\nand meaninglessness of the conflict, perhaps evoking ambivalence. But part of\nthe trick in translating metaphors from one culture to another is\nunderstanding that a cognitive valence can be very different. In English,\n\u2018hollow\u2019 and \u2018empty\u2019 tend to refer to the absence of substance within\nsomething else. (Hence, our use for it to describe depression or anhedonia.)\n\nBut in ancient Greek, the word koil\u00ea is used to describe the shape made by a\nthing that allows it to hold something else. It can sometimes then come to\nshift to point to the absence of that something else, but it is, more often, a\nmarker for the vessel which can carry something, even when it is carrying it.\nIn conjunction with Hektor\u2019s grave, consider the following lyric mentions of\nthe \u2018hollow ships\u2019 of the Trojan War:\n\nConsider:\n\nIbycus fr. 1a 16-19\n\n> Nor yet the overreaching virtue of heroes whom the hollow, many-benched\n> ships brought as the destruction of Troy.\n>\n> \u1f21\u03c1]\u03ce\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0]\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f55\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03bb\u03b1[\u03b9 \u03bd\u1fb6\u03b5\u03c2] \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1[\u03bd \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af]\u03b1\u03b9\n> \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f25\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u0323\u03b8\u0323[\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2\u00b7\n\nPindar, Ol. 6.1\n\n> Unrisked virtue becomes honored Neither among men nor in the empty ships.\n> But many a man is remembered When something noble has been tried.\n>\n> ... \u1f00\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4' \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1' \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u1f76 \u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03af\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7\n> \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u1f76 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd- \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f78\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u1fc7.\n\nIn both these passages, the ships are marked out for their potential to carry\nsomething and their ability to do so. It is also arguable that the ships carry\nethical content of the heroes they convey to Troy as well. Of course, in the\nIliad the ships are often invoked as empty in their capacity to carry things\nas well as people\u2014but these moments are also seen as critical in telling the\nstory, as when the Trojan herald Idaios refers to the beginning of the\nconflict:\n\nHomer, Il. 7.399-400\n\n> \u201cHowever many possessions Alexandros led in his hollow ships To troy.

The message of Hektor\u2019s \u201cempty grave\u201d is not like the elegiac regret of\nT.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cHollow Men\u201d, but instead it represents the potential of an empty\nvessel to be filled by the audience in its reception of the poem. It is a\nsignal, I think, of the assumption that meaning continues to be made outside\nthe world of the poem and that we stare into the sign we create the meaning\nbased on what we \u2018read\u2019 there and knew before. Each time we engage in this\nprocess, we create anew. This outward looking burial mound that is\nsimultaneously Hektor\u2019s grave and the Iliad itself is a continuation of the\nnarrative\u2019s strategy of showing us characters responding to other\u2019s narratives\nby reflecting on their own lives and then engaging in storytelling themselves,\nas we see in Achilles\u2019 final story to Priam in book 24. We are the people to\ncome, walking or sailing by on the Hellespont or traveling through the tale as\nit is sung or read. We recreate the story of Achilles, bound up in the grave\nof the man he killed, just as Hektor imagined his story would be told through\nhis own enemy\u2019s tomb.\n\nSo, in addition to Hector\u2019s grave, this vessel, this s\u00eama, refers to the Iliad\nitself. The epic is a vessel of fame, of Hector\u2019s, Achilles\u2019, and Agamemnon\u2019s,\nbut it is also a marker for the death of a world, for the end of a bygone\ntime. On the one hand, it marks the transition from the heroic age to the\npresent day. On the other, it acts as a grave marker of an entire tradition of\nepic poetry which would have sung about the wars at Troy and Thebes. We as\naudience members recreate the tale, but in the raiment of our time,\ntransforming it, but reviving it too.\n\nThe hollowness of this thing is not about being empty, but about having the\npower to carry something, to produce something else, even something new. As\nthe Tao Te Ching states, \u201cWe shape clay into a pot / but it is the emptiness\ninside / that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is\nthe inner space / that makes it livable\u201d (Chapter 11; Stephen Mitchell, 1988).\nThus, Hector\u2019s grave carries with it everything he was or could be; and the\nIliad, far from empty and devoid of meaning, is that vessel that carries so\nmuch unknown across the oceans of time.\n\nTao Te Ching: Chapter 11 translated by Stephen Mitchell (1988)\n\n> We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the\n> wagon move.\n>\n> We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever\n> we want.\n>\n> We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable.\n>\n> We work with being but non-being is what we use.\n\nblack-figure terracotta vessel depicting an ancient greek ship.\n\nPainful Signs, Or, Joel's Substack is a reader-supported publication.
