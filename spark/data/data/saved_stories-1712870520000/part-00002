This research explores how potential adopters perceive\nthese issues.\n\nEach year, millions of dogs enter U.S. shelters in need of a permanent home.\nAdopters typically go into a shelter with preferences for a certain appearance\nor personality type, meaning shelters often have a hard time finding homes for\ndogs who don\u2019t fit the mold. In particular, research shows that medical\nissues, behavioral issues, or histories of abuse prevent many dogs from being\nadopted.\n\nThe authors of this study wanted to find out exactly what kind of influence\nthese issues have on would-be adopters. In a survey, they asked 752 U.S.\nrespondents whether they would adopt a dog. Those who said yes were shown\nphotos of six purebred dogs with one of six different descriptions \u2014 a major\nor minor medical issue, a major or minor behavioral issue, a history of abuse,\nor friendliness. For example, descriptions included \u201cThis dog has diabetes\u201d\n(classified as a major medical issue) and \u201cThis dog pulls on the leash and\njumps up on people\u201d (classified as a minor behavioral issue).\n\nAfter viewing the photos, respondents were asked how likely they would be to\nadopt each dog, as well as how much benefit each dog would receive from their\ncare, and concerns about the costs and effort of caring for the dog.\n\nDogs described as friendly were perceived as more adoptable and less demanding\nthan dogs described as having medical or behavioral issues. However, when\ncomparing medical and behavioral issues, the authors noticed a significant\ndivide based on gender. Women were more likely to adopt a dog with medical\nissues over a dog with behavioral issues, while men showed a preference for\ndogs with behavioral issues over dogs with medical issues.\n\nFurthermore, dogs described as having a history of abuse were viewed as more\nadoptable and less demanding than dogs with medical or behavioral issues. The\nauthors speculate that abused dogs may appear more adoptable because people\nfeel more compassion for dogs with a sad backstory, and are drawn to the idea\nof rescuing a dog from a bad situation.\n\nParticipants who had a dog or grew up with a dog viewed dogs as more adoptable\nacross the board. Younger people and married people also viewed dogs as more\nadoptable in general. Finally, larger dogs were viewed as significantly more\nadoptable than smaller dogs. Among the dog photos, the Yellow Lab was seen as\nmost adoptable, followed by a Border Collie, Jack Russell Terrier, Maltese,\nHusky, and Pug.\n\nThe survey asked about hypothetical adoption in an online setting, meaning\nthat the findings may not reflect the choices people make in actual adoption\nsettings. Furthermore, the study relied on photos of purebred dogs, and the\nauthors only asked people about four very specific behavioral and medical\nissues. In other words, there are many different behavioral and medical issues\na dog may have, and it\u2019s unclear whether people\u2019s responses would change if\nthe dogs were described with a different behavioral or medical problem.\n\nNonetheless, the authors argue that companion animal advocates can use this\ninformation to increase the chances of adoption for \u201cchallenging\u201d dogs. For\nexample, The finding that dogs with histories of abuse are seen as just as\nadoptable as other dogs shows that shelters can still find homes for these\ndogs, perhaps by appealing to people\u2019s compassion or the idea of rescuing a\ndog from a tragic background.\n\nThe authors conclude by emphasizing the importance of transparency and\neducation in the adoption process. Shelters can mitigate concerns over medical\nor behavioral issues by being fully transparent with adopters and recommending\nsolutions like medical resources, training classes, or written behavior plans.\n\nExternal Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927936.2...\n\nMeet the Author: Stephen Ingram\n\nStephen is currently pursuing his Master\u2019s in Philosophy with a concentration\nin Ethics and Public Policy.

Without accounting for any\nsort of \"personality\" traits, they found a strong relationship between the\nsize of the dog and their length of stay (LOS), but found only tenuous links\nbetween the dog's coat color and their LOS, as well as the type of breed\n(including \"fighting breeds\") and their LOS. Researchers hope that their\nfindings will help shelters tailor their adoption efforts to focus on getting\nLOS down for all dogs, concentrating first on those that might normally stay\nin the shelter the longest.\n\n  * In The Spotlight\n\nNov 29 2014 | karol orzechowski\n\n###### Food-Related Aggression in Shelter Dogs: A Comparison of Behavior\nIdentified by a Behavior Evaluation in the Shelter...\n\nMany shelters consider food aggression (FA+) a dangerous behavior and will\neither adopt such dogs out with restrictive conditions, or consider them not\nappropriate for adoption and euthanize them. A 2013 study from Boston asks us\nto rethink conventional wisdom. In a sample of 97 dogs studied three months\nafter adoption, researchers found that only 55% of dogs who were food\naggressive (FA+) in the shelter displayed similar behavior at home. Of the\ndogs that were FA+ after adoption, almost all (93%) of them displayed the\nbehavior rarely and only 18% displayed more aggressive behavior such as lunges\nor bites.\n\n  * In The Spotlight\n\nOct 2 2012 | Faunalytics\n\n###### Investigation Of Food Guarding Behavior In Shelter Dogs In The U.S.\n\nFood guarding behavior in dogs is usually used as a reason for euthanasia.\nHowever, research has shown that once adopted, food guarding behavior\ndisappears for over 90% of dogs after three weeks, and disappears for all but\n1% after three months.\n\n  1. 1\n  2. 2\n  3. 3\n  4. 4\n  5. 5\n  6. 6\n  7. 7\n  8. 8\n  9. 9\n  10. 10\n  11. 11\n  12. 12\n\n  * Previous\n  * Next\n\n  * In The Spotlight\n\nNov 29 2022 | Trent Davidson\n\n###### The Adoptability Of Hoarded Cats\n\nLittle is known about the medium- and long-term behavior and outcomes of cats\nadopted from hoarded homes.
