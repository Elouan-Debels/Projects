April 2024\n\nAs submarines become quieter and operations shift towards the littorals, high-\nend sonar systems are needed in order to better detect and identify targets in\nthe water column, especially in a cluttered environment. This article examines\nthe latest technologies being used to improve sonar performance and the new\nproducts on the market that meet emerging naval requirements. It also\nidentifies the latest sonar programmes and their importance for submarines and\nanti-submarine warfare operations.\n\nThe return of high-intensity peer-on-peer competition has raised the stakes in\nthe underwater domain. The ability to control the sea lines of communication\nand exploit that control in the littorals has returned as a priority area for\ninvestment. Submarines perhaps represent the ultimate platform for sea\ncontrol; their ability to gather information about the underwater environment\nin order to either hunt for submarines or to improve submarine operations is\noutstanding.\n\nNaval requirements for sonar systems are evolving to improve submarine\ndetection, underwater navigation and the tracking of underwater objects. With\nthe addition of quietening technologies, modern submarines are becoming\nextremely difficult to detect; there is therefore a drive towards improving\nsonar systems and integrating them as part of a wider enhancement of the anti-\nsubmarine warfare (ASW) effort.\n\nThese efforts include bringing sonar systems into the combat network and\nintegrating sonar data with other sonar and sensor system data; using the\nnetwork to increase the use of multi-statics; adapting products to make them\nmore modular and capable of integrating with drone operations; and utilising\ndata processing enhancements such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine\nlearning (ML) and data aggregation.\n\nActive Low Frequency Towed Array Sonar (ALOFTS) from L3Harris combines a high-\npowered, active source in a variable-depth towed body. A directional towed\narray receives active and passive signals. Credit: L3Harris\n\n## Multi-statics\n\nMulti-statics is all about getting more sensors into the water to improve the\nability of sonars to detect and localise targets. It means using an active\nsonar (often offboard) to generate a \u2018ping\u2019, with multiple passive sonar\ndevices acting as listening posts to detect the sound bouncing off the target\nand allowing the target and its location to be found.\n\nUnlike the air domain, where communications networks can easily be established\nlinking sensors through the electro-magnetic spectrum in the air and via\ncables over land, this is not so easily achieved underwater or through the\nair-surface gap.\n\nFor multi-statics to work, it means that an active sonar source, such as from\na helicopter dipping sonar will have to be networked with ships, aircraft,\nsonobuoys and submarines to collate the information. Multi-statics becomes\nmore important in shallow littoral waters where active sonar is refracted and\nreflected creating false contacts among the clutter, thereby making it less\neffective \u2013 this means more sensors are needed to help identify targets.\n\nThe addition of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and uncrewed underwater\nvehicles (UUVs) fitted with sonars is part of the solution to have more\nsensors in the water and provide a more persistent surveillance of more\nchallenging underwater environments. This can be realised with a more\neffective underwater communications system able to link AUVs and UUVs and\ncrewed submarines together, and also with command centres.\n\nDistributed acoustic sensors connected by fibre-optic cables also have the\ncapability to continuously monitor larger underwater areas and provide real-\ntime information.\n\nThere are several potential sonar developments that could prove to be game\nchangers. These include the integration of sensors, such as passive and active\nsonar to enhance detection, and the fusion of contact data from different\nsources to provide a comprehensive situational awareness picture.\n\nAdvances in signal processing with algorithms that can better filter and\nanalyse sonar data will reduce false alarms and improve accuracy of threat\ndetection, while the use of AI and machine learning (ML) can enhance the\nautomated processing of that data to enable faster and more effective\ndecisions.\n\nSonars also need to be adaptive so they can adjust their operational\nparameters based on the environmental conditions and the specific\ncharacteristics of the underwater domain. For example, there is a need for\nenhanced sonar to operate more effectively in icy environments that can\naddress the challenges of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. This can be\nenabled with advances in environmental sensing technologies to provide a\nbetter understanding on how sonar performance is impacted by underwater\nconditions.\n\n## Passive/active approaches\n\nAccording to a spokesperson from Thales Underwater Systems: \u201cThe new trend for\nanti-submarine warfare systems is to use a combination of both passive and\nactive sonar for a more complete and effective underwater surveillance\ncapability, depending on environmental conditions and missions.\u201d\n\nHull-mounted sonar devices are common on most warships with different variants\nselected to provide higher or lower levels of capability. Thales BlueWatcher\nhas been chosen for the French Navy\u2019s new OPVs, with BlueHunter set to be\nfitted on French and Greek FDI frigates and Polish Miecznick frigates.\nBlueMaster will also be fitted to Spanish Bonifaz class (F110) frigates.\nCredit: Thales\n\nThe Thales spokesperson told ESD: \u201cNowadays, there is a growing operational\nneed for both improved active and passive capabilities so that surface ships\ncan fulfil their various [mission types]. For submarine sonars, the focus is\nmore on passive sonars, however high frequency active sonar remains useful for\nMine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (MOAS) for instance.\u201d\n\nPassive and active sonar technologies have different uses. The Thales\nspokesperson said that different principles apply to each. Advances are\nrequired in both technologies. Active sonars use acoustic transducers and\npower for sound output, with algorithms designed determine the distance,\ndirection and characteristics of targets depending on the acoustic returns.\n\nThe Thales spokesperson noted that, \u201cThe development of advanced signal\nprocessing techniques to improve target discrimination and reduce the impact\nof background noise in active mode is essential\u201d, adding, \u201cThe implementation\nof adaptive sonar technologies with the use of the most appropriate ping\nparameters such as frequency, pulse lengths, and types, as well as other\nparameters based on environmental conditions, is also a key differentiator.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile passive sonars use hydrophones for listening. These rely on\ndetecting and analysing acoustic signatures from the environment. Improved\nsignal processing algorithms are needed for improved detection and\nclassification of those signatures. Sonar resolutions are increasing, and with\nthem the volume of data needing to be analysed, which means that technologies\nto help with processing and networking are becoming increasingly important.\n\nFor a more collaborative form of ASW to be achieved with integrated sonars and\ninterconnected sensors, the use of modern digital technologies such as AI, ML\nand Big Data will be vital for sonar operators to help make sense of the\nacoustic environment and find threats. The Thales spokesperson said that as an\nexample, these could be used in classification and database management.\n\nThe Thales spokesperson concluded that, \u201cFor submarine sonars, the\ntechnologies enabling the management of large quantities of data are being\ninvestigated. Trustable IA and ML are also possible tools for the sonar\noperators, but only under operators\u2019 supervision.\u201d The spokesperson added,\n\u201cThey are important to alleviate the operators\u2019 workload and enable them to\nfocus on their main tasks.\u201d\n\n## Sonar programmes\n\nThe number of programmes for new sonar systems and for upgrades to existing\nsonar systems is increasing for both ship- and submarine-mounted equipment.\n\nIn July 2023, the UK MOD announced a GBP 30 million (USD 38.4 million)\ncontract with Ultra Electronics for the supply of five Type 2150 hull-mounted\nsonar (HMS) for the Royal Navy\u2019s Type 26 frigates adding to the three already\ncontracted. The 2150 is part of the company\u2019s Sea Searcher range of sonar\nalready being fitted to the Type 23 frigate as part of a wider programme to\nreplace the Type 2050 HMS developed in the 1980s. Deliveries are expected to\nbe completed by 2032.\n\nUltra stated that the 2150 incorporates digital control of the outboard array\nto minimise interference and reduce cabling. Under a USD 19 million contract\nfrom Lockheed Martin awarded in October 2022, Ultra is delivering an HMS for\nthe Type 26 frigates being built under the Canadian Surface Combatant\nprogramme. The HMS will allow the ships to passively or actively detect\nsubmarines and extend the time between maintenance periods for the sonar.\n\nThe CAPTAS-4 sonar suite is in service with the navies of France, Italy,\nMorocco, and Egypt on their FREMM frigates, and other recent customers include\nthe US Navy for its Constellation class frigates, Greece\u2019s Hellenic Navy for\nits FDI frigates, the Spanish Navy for its F110 frigates. Credit: Thales\n\nThe Type 26 frigates are specialist ASW frigates using the Sonar 2087 low-\nfrequency active/passive variable depth towed sonar array. Sonar 2087 is the\nRoyal Navy\u2019s name for the CAPTAS-4/UMS 4249 product from Thales and is the\nservice\u2019s primary ASW sensor. The company is providing a series of\nenhancements to the Type 2087 sonars fitted to the Type 23 frigates under a\nGBP 110 million contract awarded in September 2022 for the Sonar 2087 Design\nAuthority Capability Insertion Project (DA-CIP). Under the DA-CIP, Thales is\nincorporating new technologies into the system for enhanced detection and\ntracking, faster processing, better displays and controls that will allow it\nto retain operational capability in the underwater spectrum and operate well\ninto the mid-2030s.\n\nIn the United States, during July 2021, Lockheed Martin was awarded a USD 80.2\nmillion contract for the provision of a technical insertion-20 (TI-20) for the\nAN/SQQ-89A(V)15 surface ship undersea warfare combat systems and AN/SQS-53C\nhull-mounted sonar. The system is fitted to the US Navy\u2019s Arleigh Burke class\ndestroyers and Ticonderoga class cruiser; it uses both active and passive\nsensing to detect and track underwater objects.\n\nThe AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade includes improved automation for torpedo detection\nand sophisticated sonar processing and performance prediction. It also has a\nredesigned display to alleviate operator loads and integrates training and\nlogistics. The AN/SQS-53C is a digital HMS, and compared to earlier variants\nit provides a longer detection range, relying on less power and offers more\ndetailed contact information. Deliveries will be completed by June 2026. The\nAN/SQQ-89A(V)15 receives regular upgrades and in September 2022, Lockheed\nMartin underwent a contract modification worth USD 253.89 million for the\ninclusion of Technical Insertion-22 (TI-22) hardware and new TB-37A\nmultifunction towed array components.\n\nMeanwhile Thales announced in February 2024 that its subsidiary Advanced\nAcoustics Concepts (AAC) had delivered the first CAPTAS-4 Variable Depth Sonar\nto the US Navy in October 2023. CAPTAS-4 is to be fitted to the Constellation\nclass frigates under a contract signed in May 2022. Four Constellation class\nvessels have been ordered so far, and the Navy\u2019s present plans call for up to\n20 in total. This first CAPTAS-4 is due to be fitted to the first-of-class\nvessel shortly, but Thales also announced that a new CAPTAS-4 production\nfacility is being built at the AAC site at Uniontown, Pennsylvania for the\nfinal assembly, integration and acceptance testing of the next systems\nexpected.\n\n## Submarine sonar\n\nUnlike surface ships, submarines require a range of different sonar systems\nnot just for detecting threats, but also for navigation and obstacle\navoidance. These are mainly passive sensors because the submarine\u2019s main asset\nis stealth.\n\nNorthrop Grumman\u2019s Lightweight Wide Aperture Array (LWWAA) flank array sonar\nfor the US Navy\u2019s Virginia class submarines form part of the Acoustics-Rapid\nCommercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) sonar system used on USN\nsubmarines. Credit: Northrop Grumman\n\nOn US Navy submarines, L3Harris Chesapeake Sciences Division is providing a\nnew TB-34X fat-line tactical towed sonar array that includes more hydrophones,\nimproved towing mechanisms and with less internal noise generated by the\nsystem. It also produces the new TB-29A Compact Towed Array for operations in\nshallow water, where a slower vessel\u2019s speed means longer towed array systems\nmay risk coming into contact with the propeller. The TB-29A also has a reduced\npower and space requirement. L3Harris is also delivering the six acoustic\npanels that are used on the Lightweight Wide Aperture Array (LWWAA) flank\narray sonar fitted to the US Navy\u2019s Virginia class submarines. These are\nlighter and smaller than previous panels, which means the LWWAA offers nuclear\nattack submarines (SSNs) more buoyancy whilst maintaining sonar sensitivity.\n\nFor the French Navy, Thales is providing a new sonar suite for the Sous-Marin\nNucl\u00e9aire Lanceur d\u2019Engins de Troisieme G\u00e9n\u00e9ration (SNLE 3G) third generation\nnuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), and for modernising the\nsecond generation boats (SNLE 2G) \u2013 Triomphant class. The suite will include\nbow sonar, flank array, and towed arrays with optical technology, intercept\narray and echo sounders. Thales was awarded the contract from the DGA, the\nFrench defence procurement authority, in July 2023. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe\nnew arrays will be bigger, with [higher performance] sensors will require big-\ndata algorithms to be deployed on more powerful processors. This will be the\nfirst implementation of ALICIA [Analyse, Localisation, Identification,\nClassification Int\u00e9gr\u00e9es et Alertes] architecture.\u201d\n\nALICIA is a data processing system designed to handle the significantly larger\nvolumes of data that will be generated by the new sonar suite. It will include\nintuitive user interfaces to optimise operator workload and provide decision\nsupport. The company is also completing a sonar retrofit on the French Navy\u2019s\ntwo Am\u00e9thyste class SSNs that is due to be completed later in 2024.\n\nImproved detection ranges and accuracy are a feature of the ISUS 100 sonar\nsuite that can include large acoustic aperture long-range flank arrays and a\nreelable thin line extended towed array. Credit: Atlas Elektronik\n\nELAC Sonar is developing a new sonar system for the Italian Navy\u2019s two new\nU212 Near Future Submarines under a EUR 49 million contract from prime\ncontractor Leonardo. The Spanish Navy\u2019s new S-80A Plus submarines will have\nthe Lockheed Martin Submarine Integrated Combat System (SUBICS) sonar suite\nthat includes a bow, flank, passive ranging and mine and obstacle avoidance\nsonar (MOAS). Sweden\u2019s Blekinge class (A26) submarine will be fitted with new\nbow, flank and HF intercept sonar arrays by Atlas Elektronik, along with the\nSA9510S MOAS and bottom navigation systems including an EM2040 multibeam echo\nsounder, side-scan sonar, sub-bottom profiler and hydrographic echo sounders.\n\nIn terms of materials science, textured ceramics is one technology that\npromises to improve acoustic transducer performance, further enhancing\nsensitivity, and potentially also reducing weight and power requirements in\nsonar systems. Improvements in construction methods can also improve the\nconduction of sound to the sensor, reducing the ambient noise. Textured\nceramic-based transducers are being incorporated into the product lines of a\nnumber of sonar manufacturers.\n\n## Uncrewed capabilities\n\nSolutions are being developed to address uncrewed ASW assets. At DSEI in\nSeptember 2023, UMS Skeldar and Ultra Marine showcased a new ASW sonobuoy\ndispenser that could be mounted on a Skeldar V-200 rotary-wing vertical take-\noff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). It was developed under a\ndefence innovation contract from the Canadian Department of National Defence\nawarded in October 2022.\n\nThe intention is for the UAV to provide a rapid sonobuoy dispensing capability\nto supplement that provided by fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft and dipping\nsonar mounted on a ship\u2019s helicopters. It rapidly adds more sensors into the\nwater that can contribute to a multi-static sensor network, for the detection\nof submarines. A prototype is being developed under phase 2 of the contract,\nwith a live flight demonstration expected should the project progress to a\nthird phase.\n\nScreenshot from a UMS Skeldar concept video showing the Skeldar V-200 VTOL UAV\nbeing used for dispensing sonobuoys and data relay. Credit: UMS Skeldar\n\nMeanwhile, the UK MoD is seeking to develop, demonstrate and deliver new\nuncrewed deployable ASW capabilities under Project Charybdis. It is part of\nthe wider Royal Navy ASW Spearhead programme in which the Submarine Delivery\nAgency is delivering phase 1 \u2013 to identify technologies ripe for application\nand awards contracts for concept studies.\n\nThis project includes autonomy, robotics, AI and ML that be harnessed in\nuncrewed platforms to enhance their capability and provide a persistent and\ndeployable uncrewed ASW capability alongside existing assets. The service\nwants this new capability to be able to deploy across wide areas of ocean,\ndetect dangerous object, classify them, localise and track them and report\ncontacts to allied units.\n\nWith the project underway, almost 30 companies have received small contract\nawards to develop concepts. Phase 2 is for the demonstration of technologies,\nand this is due to start during FY2024\u201325. This second phase will build on\ninitiatives already begun and provide evidence for new work and develop\nessential elements to each project, including shore infrastructure, regulatory\napproaches, training and support. The intention is to find solutions that\ncould be fielded within five years.\n\nThe Thales spokesperson said that under Project Charybdis, the company\n\u201cdefined two ASW Surveillance concepts with a blend of UxVs [uncrewed\nsurface/underwater vehicles] within the solutions. We are waiting for the\ncustomer to advise on the next steps for Phase 2, but the intention is to\nprototype capabilities from the phase 1 concepts\u201d.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSonar systems remain the key to unlocking the underwater domain. The two key\nimprovements are firstly to enhance the performance of the sonar systems and\nprocess the data faster and more effectively, and secondly to connect larger\nnumbers of sonar systems and into the wider military network to enable multi-\nstatic detection of targets.\n\nSonar developments aim to increase sensitivity to detect, classify and\nlocalise targets at longer range and apply greater processing power to manage\nthe data loads and present information to speed up decision-making.\n\nThis technology can then also fuse sonar data with data from other, multi-\nstatic, sources via robust communications systems, that will offer a much\nclearer understanding of the acoustic environment across a wider area, and the\nability to rapidly identify and classify targets in the water column in\ndifferent environments. As sophisticated sonar capabilities such as these\ndevelop and proliferate, submarines will find it ever more difficult to remain\nhidden.\n\nTim Fish\n\n  * Keywords\n  * Active Low Frequency Towed Array Sonar (ALOFTS)\n  * L3Harris\n  * sonar technologies\n\nESD\n\n#### Verwandte ArtikelMehr vom Autor\n\nCyber/Coms\n\n### US State Department approves FMS to Germany covering HF/VHF/UHF radios\n\nLand\n\n### VAMPIRE deployment having the desired effect in Ukraine, says L3Harris\n\nTechnology\n\n### Soldier Communications \u2013 Rugged, Capable, and Interoperable\n\nAir\n\n### Stage-1 Static Test Firing Conducted of USAF\u2019s Future ICBM\n\nIndustry\n\n### IDEX 2023: EDGE Declares the Show \u2018a Great Success\u2019\n\n#### New releases\n\n#### More benefits for you\n\n### Service for subscribers\n\nIf you have questions regarding your subscription of European Security &\nDefence contact our subscriber service:\n\n    \n    \n    PressUp GmbH Postfach 70 13 11, D-22013 Hamburg Phone (040) 38 66 66 -319 Fax(040) 38 66 66 -299 E-Mail mittler-report@pressup.de\n\n#### News\n\n  * Policy\n  * Air\n  * Land\n  * Sea\n  * Cyber/Coms\n  * Tactical\n  * Industry\n\n#### Articles\n\n  * Policy\n  * Armed Forces\n  * Armament\n  * Technology\n  * Industry\n\n#### Information\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Contact\n  * Media Kit\n  * Profile\n  * Service\n  * Staff\n\nAbout us\n\nMittler Report Verlag GmbH Beethovenallee 21 D-53173 Bonn\n\nPhone +49 228 3500 870 Fax +49 228 3500 871\n\nContact us: info(at)mittler-report.de\n\nFollow us\n\n  * Contact\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Imprint\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms of business\n  * Cookie Policy\n\n\u00a9 2019 Copyright Mittler Report Verlag \u201eA company of TAMMMEDIA\u201c\n\n", "frontpage": false}
