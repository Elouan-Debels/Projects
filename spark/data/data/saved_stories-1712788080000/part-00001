Column by column, AI can reflect on parts of a problem\nrather than the whole, leading to a 32% reduction in errors over one-shot\nreasoning across document benchmarks, thanks to Chain of Thought Reasoning and\nIndex Knowledge.\n\n\u201cV7 Go achieved 98% accuracy with a zero-shot approach using Index knowledge,\nagainst 66% and 42%.\u201d\n\nV7 Go is powered by Index Knowledge, a technology that breaks down large files\ncontaining information into small searchable indexes that enable LLMs to query\ninformation more accurately than retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\ntechniques at the expense of more compute.\n\nTraditional chat AI products simply inject text from documents into a prompt,\nwhilst Index Knowledge utilizes the model itself to develop a data extraction\nplan, much like a human analyst would. This feature is particularly effective\nin files containing many numbers and uncommon terms such as proteins, proper\nnouns, and formulas, which RAG often fails to retrieve when summarizing.\n\nWe compared the extraction of these customs form against two leading document\nprocessing providers, and achieved 98% accuracy with a zero-shot approach\nusing Index knowledge, against 66% and 42%.\n\nAlberto Rizzoli Co-founder and CEO\n\nFeatures\n\n## Run frontier models across your documents, images, text, and videos.\n\nStart for freeRequest a demo\n\nAI select properties\n\nNo more essay long answers.

Find answers.\n\nWhy should I use Go instead of calling a model provider directly?\n\nGo is more accurate and robust than calling a model provider directly. By\nbreaking down complex tasks into reasoning steps with Index Knowledge, Go\nenables LLMs to query your data more accurately than an out of the box API\ncall. Combining this with conditional logic, which can route high sensitivity\ndata to a human review, Go builds robustness into your AI powered workflows.\n\nIs V7 Go part of V7 Darwin?\n\nV7 Darwin is a data labeling platform for annotating videos and medical\nimaging to train your own model, while V7 Go specializes in applying\nfoundation models to multimodal data, starting with intelligent document\nprocessing. In time they will be natively connected.\n\nWhat is a Go token?\n\nGo tokens are standardized units obtained by converting tokens from various\nmodel providers into a single measure. More expensive models consume Go tokens\nat a faster rate than cheaper models. While Go tokens are metered and limited\nas part of a billing plan, the primary limit is on fields.\n\nDoes V7 Go support external models?\n\nV7 Go will support external models via API, allowing for a flexible approach\nto document processing by incorporating both in-house and third-party AI\nmodels.\n\nCan V7 Go recognize printed and handwritten text?\n\nV7 Go is capable of recognizing both printed and handwritten text, leveraging\nadvanced optical character recognition (OCR) technologies, as well as charts,\ndiagrams and logos.\n\n## Solve tasks, reliably at scale.
