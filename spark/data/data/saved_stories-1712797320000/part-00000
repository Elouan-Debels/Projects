Google Cloud, the\ncloud platform division that competes with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\nAzure, is following in the footsteps of those companies and rolling out its\nown Arm-based chip designs. Google says its new \"Google Axion Processors\" are\n\"custom Arm-based CPUs designed for the data center\" and offer \"industry-\nleading performance and energy efficiency.\"\n\nGoogle has been developing custom data center accelerators for things like AI\nand video transcoding, but this is the first time the company is making a CPU.\nGoogle says it's seeing \"50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-\nefficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances.\"\n\n### Further Reading\n\nBehind the scenes: How we host Ars Technica, part one\n\nGoogle's \"Axion\" chip is based on the Arm Neoverse V2 CPU, so just like the\nARM chips we see on mobile devices, by making \"custom\" chips, these companies\nare closely following a lot of blueprints that Arm makes available. Google\nsays it did include a custom microcontroller called \"Titanium,\" which it says\nhandles networking, security, and storage I/O.\n\nThis is Google Cloud, so you won't be buying anything with an \"Axion\" chip in\nit. You can pay for cloud processing that uses the new CPU, with Google naming\n\"Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow, Cloud\nBatch, and more\" as services that will use the new chip. Some of these\nservices bill by \"vCPU\" usage, so theoretically a faster CPU could lead to\nlower prices, but Google doesn't spell that out in the post. Internally Google\nis also moving BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth\nEngine, and the YouTube Ads platform from its current Arm servers to this new\ncustom one soon.\n\nIt's a bit strange to tout a new cloud infrastructure CPU when the whole point\nof services like AWS and Google Cloud is that you don't have to worry about\nthe server. The services you were running will continue to run, while\ncompanies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft can take care of all that\ncomplicated hardware and network data center stuff. Google says that Axion VMs\nwill be available as a \"preview\" in \"the coming months\" and that Cloud\ncustomers can sign up for access.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n23\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
