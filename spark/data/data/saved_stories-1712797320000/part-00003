This rev is about 2 years old and is probably the only rev that Maxis\nwill do. It is available on the CD-ROM Collection and on floppy. It should be\nnoted that the installer has been revved to fix an installation bug and to\ninclude more sound drivers. If you have the CD-ROM Collection or floppies with\nsound drivers for the AWE and Ensonique, you have the newer installer. There\nis no Version 1.1 in general release. There is one available, but it's only to\nfix a specific crash bug related to the interrupt processing on some\nmotherboards and generally is WORSE on machines that do not have the interrupt\nprocessing bug.SC2k Win 3.1 - Version 1.2 currently ships on the CD-ROM\nCollection and floppies. It was released in March if I remember correctly. It\nincludes support for the Urban Renewal Kit and a few nice goodies.SC2k Win95 -\nVersion 1.0 is the current and only version in release. It's only available on\nthe CD-ROM Collection format.SC2k Mac - Version 1.2 is available on the CD-ROM\nCollection and on floppy. It's a \"fat binary\" which means it will run on a\n680x0 based Mac and in native mode on a PowerPC based Mac. If you have a\nPowerPC based Mac, I HIGHLY recommend you get the newer version. It also\nincludes support for the Urban Renewal Kit and some other goodies.SCURK DOS -\nVersion 1.0 is the current and only version in release.SCURK Windows - Version\n1.0 is the current and only version in release.SCURK Windows 95 - Version 1.0\nis the current and only version in release.SCURK Mac - Version 1.0 is the\ncurrent and only version in release. It also is a \"fat binary\" and runs on\nboth 680x0 and PowerPC based Macs.These version numbers related to the U.S.\nversions only. Update programs are available for the Windows 3.1 and Mac\nversions just about everywhere. Try ftp.maxis.com or ftp.emf.net/users/six.\nNote that the CD-ROM Collections are platform specific. They're available for\nDOS, Mac/PowerMac (1 CD), and Windows3/Windows95 (1 CD).The Windows version\ndoes have several nice additions over the DOS version. Since it supports\nWindows Multimedia, there's much wider sound support. wit the extended\nresolution, you can fit more on the screen at once. The windows version also\nhas a 4th zoom level, so you can get even tighter in on things - It basically\njust doubles the size of the pixels, but at high resolutions, even the 3rd\nzoom level is too tiny to work in). It also runs in the background, so you can\ncrank on Excel or whatever while your sims are running around in the\nbackground. It also does fix a lot of the DOS (and even some Mac) bugs.As for\ngoing with the DOS or Windows version, that's a tough call. The DOS version\nmay be difficult to get running under 4 megs (most people have to make a boot\ndisk ), but the Windows version may be too slow on a 386-25. I'd say stick\nwith the DOS version, for speed reasons.Windows and Mac versions of the Urban\nRenewal Kit and CD-Collections are in the works for early '95.[soapbox mode\non] I don't want to start a widespread exodus from DOS, but to be honest, the\nSimCity 2000 DOS code is so damn messy, we hate trying to touch it (we've\npretty much given up on a decent 1.1 patch - the 1.1 patch floating around\nonline will probably never be officially offered to customers, it seems to\nbreak more things than it fixes). There is a definite push from just about\neveryone to move our focus from DOS to Windows, it's just easier to let\nMicrosoft deal with the millions of hardware configurations around than to try\nand do it ourselves (it was much easier when there was just the 8088, 286, and\n386 chips, Soundblasters, one kind of bus, non-accelerated video cards, two\nbrands of Mice, and 2 main versions of MS-DOS). We used to be able to spend\n%80 of the coding/testing/debugging time dealing the actual program, and just\n%20 testing for hardware conflicts. Now it's easily a 50/50 situation, if not\nworse. That may be one reason why we still do a lot of first-run development\non the Mac. Even though the sales aren't nearly as high, it allows us to spend\nmore time developing and less time debugging (or it could just be that Will\nWright is just a Mac head :). [soapbox mode off]\n\n  1. Is the DOS version the same as the MAC version or are there different features in the DOS version that are not in the MAC's or vice versa? i don't want them to be disappointed if the look and feel of the DOS version is different than the MAC's.MI can say that the DOS versions looks EXACTLY like the Mac version, including pull down menus and it's even got that macintrash font :) I think there are only a couple features missing, but you'll never notice those. (i.e. arcologies don't blast off in the dos version, there are a couple small bugs in the dos version, etc.)\n  2. Does the WINDOWS version have any new features over the DOS version?Not that I'm aware of, no.\n  3. The kids liked the graphics on the MAC version. does the DOS version have the same graphics and is the resolution just as good, if not better?Everything for dos is better, graphics and resolution are just the same\n  4. How does the graphics on the WINDOWS version compare to the DOS version?I haven't actually seen the windoze version, but I can say from other programs that generally DOS graphics programs are better if the programmers have successfully designed a good GUI for it. I'm speaking out of my ignorance here, but I would say that the DOS version would be better.\n  5. If i exchanged the DOS version for the WINDOWS version it would be running on a 386-25, 4MB, ATI Wonder SVGA video card. is this hardware sufficient for the WINDOWS version?Well, 4megs of RAM under DOS is just enough to cut it. As for you're processor, that's fine and the graphics card is perfect for it. Probably it would be slower under Windoze.\n  6. I just joined this list so i've read about some of the problems with the DOS version (i think one has to do something with a bulldozer, can't remember any others offhand). does the WINDOWS version fix these problems?Wouldn't know 'bout that..\n  7. Can the Great Disasters add-on be used under the WINDOWS version? if not, is there any plans to bring out a WINDOWS add-on?Ditto..\n\nThe bottom line is, should i exchange the DOS version for the WINDOWS version?\nplease don't recommend the DOS version if you are a WINDOWS hater or vice\nversa!! i need to know based on gameplay, graphics, ease of playing based on\ntheir ages, etc.Go for the DOS version!Another factor here: If you're aware of\nthe urban renewal kit, I can tell you that Maxis doesn't have any plans to do\na Windows version of it. (Correct me if I'm wrong there...) So, as your kids\nslowly vegetate and become Simheads, they'll want to be able to get all the\naddons they can-- and the DOS version will support those add ons.From Jerry\nMooreWhen Maxis released the version 1.1 software patch for the Mac platform,\none of the major changes was the ability to go beyond the previous limit of\n140 arcos and have these additional structures included in the total city\npopulation count. This did not appear to be the case with the DOS version 1.1\nupgrade patch. It now appears that once you run SimCity 2000 Windows on a\nhardware platform with enough RAM and a huge Windows swap file, that the 140\narco limit of the DOS software does not exist. When adding a large number of\narcologies the \"microsims\" still seem to go into the reduced memory mode where\nthe amount of data returned when using the query tool is reduced, but\nadditional arcos beyond 140 do get counted towards the overall city\npopulation. What is the largest population that others have been able to\nobtain with the Mac 1.1 and/or Windows software?DOS 1.0 vs DOS 1.1From Pat\nCostonWhen you age your city past the year 9999, it still goes to 0000 and\ncontinues, but when you reach Dec 11900, in 1.0 the date would be Jan 11901,\nbut in 1.1 the date is Jan 11900. In 1.1 you can't age past Dec 11900. The\nmonths will continue to go Jan, Feb, Mar ... and so on. Note that your city is\nstill aging. If you were to load up your city in 1.0 after hitting the Dec\n11900 barrier for a few years, you would see the actual date. Note that the\nactual date is only shown in the Budget window.Windows 95From Pat CostonYou\ncan only age a city to Oct 7,160,328 with a starting year of 2050. The very\nnext month it becomes Apr -7,156,228 then SimCity 2000 crashes.The reason it\ngoes negative at such a strange places is because of the way it calculates the\ndate. It uses a day-counter which starts at 0 on the year your city is founded\nwhich can be 1900, 1950, 2000 or 2050. Every month has 25 days. Every year has\n12 months. So there are 300 days in a year.To get the day it gets the\nremainder of the day-counter divided by 25. To get the month it divides the\nday-counter by 25 then by 12 to get the remainder. To get the year, it divides\nthe day counter by 25 then by 12.Example: The largest value a 32-bit signed\ninteger can have is 2,147,483,647 which is 2 raised to the 31st power minus 1.\nBit 32 is for the sign. We subtract 1 because it starts at 0.| Date|\nCalculation| Result| Comment  \n---|---|---|---  \nDay| 2,147,483,647 modulo 25| 22| Day 22  \nMonth| (2,147,483,647 / 25) modulo 12| 9.88| Rounded you get 10 which is Oct  \nYear| ((2,147,483,647 / 25) / 12) + 2050| 7,160,328.823| Rounded to 7,160,328  \n  \nSo if the day-counter is 2,147,483,647 and the start year was 2050 then the\ndate is October 22 in the year of 7,160,328.\n\nFrom Jerry Moore\n\nHow do you know what version you have? If you have SimCity 2000 for Dos or\nMac, you just type 'ver' and a version window will pop up. Unfortunately this\nis not the case with the Windows version. One way to know what version you\nhave is the date of your SC2000W.EXE file.\n\n  * ver 1.0 date 10/30/94\n  * ver 1.1 date unknown\n  * ver 1.2 date 3/10/95\n\nYou can also look for the version number in the debug window. Type oivaizmir\nafter you hilight the toolbox and the debug option should appear as one of the\nmenus at the top of your window. Open the debug menu and select Show Version\nInfo.\n\nFrom Patrick Coston\n\nThere's one thing I really hate about SimCity 2000 for Windows ver 1.0. When\nyou select File/Open, it always defaults to the directory you installed it in.\nIn my case that's c:\\sc2k4win.\n\nIt's a HUGE pain if I want to look at 10 cities in\nc:\\games\\cities\\contest\\here\\\\. Every time I go to load a city I have to\nnavigate back to where I just was. SimCity 2000 for DOS always remembers the\nlast directory you were in.\n\nThis problem has been fixed in SimCity 2000 version 1.2. It even works better\nthan DOS because it remembers the last directory you were in even after you\nclose the program and turn off your computer!  \n  \nThis Web Page was created by Patrick Coston July 16, 1995, Last updated\nDecember 15, 2014\n\n", "frontpage": false}
