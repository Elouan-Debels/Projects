Organizations have invested heavily in hopes of reaping\ntransformative benefits, yet widespread adoption and real impact have failed\nto materialize and match the hype.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on?\n\nAs it stands, the current suite of Large Language Models (LLMs) are not\nsophisticated enough to solve real-world business challenges right out of the\nbox. While these models perform well on academic benchmarks, addressing\npractical problems requires more context through prompts, retrieval\naugmentation, or fine-tuning. For developers of generative AI products, this\nprocess has been more of an art than a science, leading to slower, \u201cvibes-\ndriven\u201d iteration cycles and subpar results.\n\nWe\u2019re on a mission to change all that, and help developers build better AI\nproducts, faster.\n\n## Hello World, we\u2019re Quotient \ud83d\udc4b\n\nEvery developer understands that for a change in their system to be strategic\nrather than impulsive, it is crucial and essential to test its impact on the\ndesired outcome. The ability to do this seamlessly, swiftly, and reliably\nresults in flywheels of iterative improvements that ultimately create\ndisruptive products that delight users.\n\nQuotient equips all AI developers with the tools to achieve just that. With\nQuotient, they can swiftly gauge the effectiveness of their cutting-edge\ngenerative AI solutions to meet the unique requirements of each user or\ncustomer.\n\n## Quotient brings an end to one-size-fits-all evaluation\n\nWith Quotient, we're not just offering a tool; we're offering a solution that\nbridges the gap between the potential of generative AI and its real-world\nimpact.\n\nQuotient offers AI developers the capability to evaluate their AI products\nwith specialized datasets and frameworks, which can be customized or ready-to-\nuse, and tailored to their organization. By addressing challenges in\nevaluation management, version control, and orchestration, Quotient\nstreamlines assessments of models, prompts, and retrieval augmentation through\nrapid, data-driven iteration cycles.\n\nWith Quotient, you can achieve:\n\n  * 25x faster data curation, automatically. The data you already have becomes reference data for evaluation and fine-tuning.\n  * 20x faster evaluations, fully-orchestrated. You can handle model, dataset, and prompt management, and version control with ease.\n  * 100% personalized evaluation, at scale. Get ready to tailor your AI products to your users with customizable evaluators.\n\n## Accelerating evaluation to the speed of innovation\n\nOur ambition to build Quotient is rooted in first-hand knowledge of what is\nnecessary to build and launch powerful generative AI products.\n\nAt GitHub, our founders brought one of the most disruptive AI products to\nmarket: GitHub Copilot. They accomplished this by developing an evaluation\ninfrastructure that empowered interdisciplinary teams of engineers,\nresearchers, and product leaders with the ability to get fast, quantitative\nfeedback on their work, and ultimately release products that surpassed\naudacious goals.\n\nWe know that shipping based on vibes and manual trial and error is not enough.\nWe saw the road ahead \u2014 and we believe that the ability to understand,\nanticipate, and improve the performance of AI products is key to unlocking\ntheir adoption at scale.\n\nWe are committed to helping those embarking on similar journeys reach their\ngoals. We can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll achieve.\n\nLet\u2019s get started! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\\- Julia, Freddie, and Quotient\u2019s Founding Team\n\nNo items found.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Quotient AI.
