I\u2019ve been talking with a\nfew folks lately about how it feels like many people have either forgotten\nthat story or weren\u2019t paying attention when it happened. Two years ago, we did\na 10-year retrospective on the fight, and it feels like some people need a\nrefresher. Most notably, Charles Rivkin, the head of the MPA (formerly the\nMPAA), certainly appears to need a refresher because he just announced it\u2019s\ntime to bring back SOPA.\n\nFor the young ones in the audience, SOPA (and its Senate companion, PIPA) were\nbills pushed strongly by the film (MPA) and recording (RIAA) industries. They\nwere pushing for \u201csite blocking\u201d for websites that the industries accused of\nbeing \u201cdedicated to piracy.\u201d The law was a slam dunk. It had a huge number of\nco-sponsors, and the MPA/RIAA combo had convinced Congress to pass ever more\nexpansive copyright laws basically every two to three years for the past 25\nyears. SOPA was set to become law.\n\nUntil it wasn\u2019t. Because the public spoke up loudly. I (coincidentally) was at\nthe Capitol on the day of the big Internet Blackout in protest of SOPA/PIPA,\nand I heard the phones ringing off the hook. I was running up and down the\nhalls of the office buildings, having Reps. tell me how they were removing\ntheir names from the co-sponsor list. The public spoke up and it worked.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember why it worked: because the law was a horrific\nattack on free speech and the open web. And for no good reason.\n\nWe spent much time explaining why this would be a clear violation of the First\nAmendment. Under the First Amendment, you cannot shut down an entire\npublishing house just because it sometimes has published works that contain,\nsay, defamation. You cannot ban access to a photocopying machine because some\nusers use it to infringe. SOPA was basically built-in prior restraint.\n\nYou can only target the actually violative content and not declare entire\nsites be blocked. That goes way beyond what the First Amendment allows.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s dangerous. First, as was made clear at the time, site\nblocking of that nature would fuck with underlying technological protocols\nthat are designed to return sites on request. In particular, it would break\nDNSSEC, which remains an important bit of security online.\n\nThere is also the very real risk of false positives. We have plenty of\nexamples of this. During the run-up to SOPA, Universal Music actually declared\nhip-hop star 50 Cent\u2019s personal website to be dedicated to infringing content.\nAlso, the risk of collateral damage is very real. In the past, we\u2019ve had\nstories of orders to block a single site, not realizing it was on a shared\nserver, that ended up with tons of sites blocked as collateral damage.\n\nAll that is to say: site blocking is bad, doesn\u2019t work, isn\u2019t needed, would\ncause real damage, and much, much more.\n\nAnd so of course the MPA and Rivkin are trying to bring it back. In a speech\nearlier this week, Rivkin laid out the \u201cstate of the industry.\u201d He pulled out\nall the old debunked hits from a decade ago about how piracy was killing\nHollywood and blah blah blah. The problem is, it\u2019s just not true. Earlier this\nyear we released our latest Sky is Rising report, which again showed that\nHollywood is thriving, and that piracy was never a particularly serious\nproblem.\n\nIndeed, the only reason there\u2019s recently been a small increase in infringing\nuse is because the big streaming companies (who are all members of the MPA)\nhave started implementing a bunch of bullshit policies designed to annoy users\nand to squeeze them for more money, while giving less in return. The cause of\npiracy is the MPA members themselves.\n\nBut, alas, Rivkin insists that site blocking is the only answer to his own\nmembers\u2019 failures to treat customers right:\n\n> So today, here with you at CinemaCon, I\u2019m announcing the next major phase of\n> this effort: the MPA is going to work with Members of Congress to enact\n> judicial site-blocking legislation here in the United States.\n>\n> For anybody unfamiliar with the term, site-blocking is a targeted, legal\n> tactic to disrupt the connection between digital pirates and their intended\n> audience.\n>\n> It allows all types of creative industries \u2013 film and television, music and\n> book publishers, sports leagues and broadcasters \u2013 to request, in court,\n> that internet service providers block access to websites dedicated to\n> sharing illegal, stolen content.\n>\n> Let\u2019s be clear: this approach focuses only on sites featuring stolen\n> materials. There are no gray areas here.\n>\n> Site-blocking does not impact legitimate businesses or ordinary internet\n> users. To the contrary: it protects them, too.\n>\n> And it does so within the bounds of due process, requiring detailed evidence\n> establishing a target\u2019s illegal activities and allowing alleged perpetrators\n> to appear in a court of law.\n\nAlmost everything Rivkin says here is bullshit. Hollywood is thriving these\ndays. They had a blip due to COVID, but there is no indication, at all, that\n\u201cpiracy\u201d has ever been a problem, let alone now. Rivkin tosses out bullshit\nnumbers claiming massive job and revenue losses from piracy, and those numbers\ncome from laughably bad studies that often assume every infringing copy is a\nlost sale. Or they lump in claims of \u201ctrademark infringement\u201d to argue that\nevery counterfeit product is the same as someone downloading a movie they\nwould never have paid for in the first place.\n\nBut, more importantly, site blocking is 100% prior restraint and\nunconstitutional in the US. There is no serious due process in any site\nblocking regime, and every attempt has resulted in all sorts of bogus blocks\nand takedowns, many of which we\u2019ve detailed over the years.\n\nRivkin\u2019s claims that there \u201care no gray areas\u201d and that it \u201cfocuses only on\nsites featuring stolen materials\u201d would sound a lot better if we didn\u2019t have a\nlong list of bogus seizures of sites based on lies told by the RIAA and MPA.\nRemember Dajaz1? That site was seized by the government because the RIAA lied\nand claimed it featured infringing content. It did not. It was a music blog\nthat the industry itself would often send material to in an effort to hype up\nartists.\n\nOr how about OnSmash? It was another blog that the recording industry\nregularly sent tracks to as a promotional gambit, only to then claim it was a\npirate site. It was seized and the government ignored requests to return it\nfor FIVE YEARS, before finally handing it back to the original owner with no\ncharges filed and no apology.\n\nThere are many more examples like this of sites being seized by the government\nbased on outright lies by the industry. There is no due process. There is no\nfairness. It absolutely destroyed \u201clegitimate businesses and ordinary internet\nusers.\u201d\n\nRivkin is lying. He\u2019s hoping that people are too distracted with things like\ngenerative AI and fights over Section 230 to realize that they\u2019re bringing\nback SOPA and looking to destroy the open internet once again.\n\nDo not let this move forward. If Rivkin is mentioning it, it means he has the\nMPA\u2019s usual crew of bought-and-paid-for Congressional Reps and Senators ready\nto spring into action.\n\nCongress is going to need to be reminded why the internet stood up and said\n\u201cNO!\u201d last time SOPA/PIPA came around. They need to be reminded why they\u2019ve\nstayed away from copyright law for the most part all these years, realizing it\nhad become a third rail issue. The MPA bringing SOPA back suggests they think\ninternet users are distracted and have moved on.\n\nWe\u2019re going to need to show Rivkin that he\u2019s wrong.\n\nFiled Under: 1st amendment, charles rivkin, copyright, pipa, prior restraint,\nsite blocking, sopa Companies: mpa, mpaa\n\n16 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * How Copyright May Destroy Our Access To The World's Academic Knowledge\n  * AI-Powered Fake Copyright Trolling Threat Letters Really Just An SEO Scam\n  * Bureau Of Prisons Seeking To Criminalize Social Media Access By Inmates\n  * Game Jam Winner Spotlight: Letters To Cthulhu\n  * Germany Still Locking Up Some Laws Behind Copyright\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cHollywood Believes The Time Is Ripe To Bring Back SOPA\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n16 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 9:44 am\n\n# Europe, too\n\nThis sort of thing has also seen a surprisingly unrecognised push in the EU by\nway of their counterfeiting/piracy toolbox.

As I responded to a friend: I really hate the conflations they make in the... article??? Haidt seems to be advertising his book.

The danger here is ignoring that there are very real reasons why kids and americans in general are not happy.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yeah. Haidt's book is very problematic for a long list of reasons\n  * I keep debating if it's worth writing about it at all\n  * Especially since he seems to *enjoy* it when everyone points out his research methodology, including cherry picking data, ignoring alternative hypotheses, and misstating what the data actually shows, is so problematic\n  * the WaPo review of his new book is not kind. https://www.washingtonpost.com/b...\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/03/22/anxious-generation-rewiring-\nchildhood-jonathan-haidt-review/\n\n  * Samuel Abram: The Washington Post did something *not* shitty?

I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Wednesday  \n  \n---  \n09:27| Hollywood Believes The Time Is Ripe To Bring Back SOPA (16)  \n05:29| Prison Telecom Monopolies & Michigan Counties Sued For Kickback Deals\nThat Banned In-Person Visits To Boost Phone And Video Revenues (12)  \n  \n## Tuesday  \n  \n19:46| How Copyright May Destroy Our Access To The World's Academic Knowledge\n(8)  \n15:41| Fifth Circuit: Never Mind Your Lying Eyes, These Cops Who Killed A\nWoman Deserve Immunity (33)  \n13:30| Techdirt Podcast Episode 386: Democratic Design For Online Spaces (0)  \n11:55| AI-Powered Fake Copyright Trolling Threat Letters Really Just An SEO\nScam (14)  \n10:42| Bureau Of Prisons Seeking To Criminalize Social Media Access By Inmates\n(38)  \n10:39| Daily Deal: Headway Premium (0)  \n09:25| Elon Finally Finds A Government He\u2019s Willing To Stand Up To: When The\nCensorship Demands Target His Political Allies (188)  \n05:24| New Net Neutrality Rules Won't Harm Telecom Giants In The Slightest (5)  \n  \n##### More\n\n\u00d7\n\n## Email This Story\n\nThis feature is only available to registered users.
