That\u2019s Praxis (Magazine)\n\nThe group that wants to create an autonomous nation in the Mediterranean has\nmade a magazine.\n\nBy Caroline Haskins\n\n9:57 AM EDT on April 9, 2024\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on X (formerly Twitter)\n  * Share on Email\n\n(Caroline Haskins / Hell Gate)\n\n4Comments\n\nOn Wednesday night, the East Village French restaurant Ella Fun was converted\ninto a teeming club for the launch of Praxis Magazine, a free two hundred page\nvolume created by the company and aspiring nation known as Praxis.\n\nPraxis, co-founded by two white guys in their mid-twenties, is best known for\nraising more than $19 million in hopes of creating an autonomous, high-tech\nnation somewhere in the Mediterranean.\n\nSuch a task would take billions of dollars, and many years of planning and\nconstruction. So in the meantime, the company has largely spent its time and\nresources throwing parties and cultivating a social network. It quickly became\nknown as a hot-bed for far-right politics.\n\nPraxis employees have described co-founder Dryden Brown as unusually\ninterested in theology, Nazi occultism, libertarianism, and proto-fascism,\naccording to Mother Jones. The New York Times described Brown as having \"a\nsort of mood board politics: a social media pastiche of images and aphorisms\nthat celebrate antiquity, classicism and biological hierarchy.\" Praxis has\nhired extremists like Mike Mahoney, encouraged employees to read reactionary\ntexts, and courted right-wing influencers to support its mission.\n\nNaturally, the launch party included the types of people who can overlook\nstuff like this. The patrons were overwhelmingly white, mostly male, and often\nemployees for a VC firm. There were more women than I expected, and all of\nthem were beautiful. A few mentioned being personally invited by Brown,\nsometimes via Instagram DM.\n\nPraxis paid for an open bar until 1 a.m. and converted the main dining area\ninto a dance floor with pinkish lighting and a DJ. Around midnight, a fog\nmachine clouded up the space. The DJ played hits \u2014\"Dancing on My Own,\" \"Can\u2019t\nGet You Out of My Head,\" old Kanye West songs, etc.\u2014but I didn\u2019t see one\nperson dance the entire night. Past midnight, the room reeked of weed.\n\nBut people were there to socialize, not dance. From 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., I tried\nto talk to as many of them as I could. The resulting conversations often fell\non a spectrum between odd and unpleasant. It was fitting for a magazine that,\nI would later learn, amounts to a crude, juvenile fantasy of societal collapse\nand rebirth.\n\n(Caroline Haskins / Hell Gate)\n\nI approached three white guys who appeared to be in their late 20s. They said\ntheir first names, which I immediately forgot. A few minutes later, they all\nconfessed to giving me false names.\n\nA \"friend\" had told them about this party, they said, but declined to say who.\nAll three said they vehemently oppose the mission of Praxis. I asked them to\nexplain. A guy with curly hair and glasses, who said he had a job \"making VC\npeople money,\" said it was because of Praxis\u2019s right wing ideology. His two\nfriends felt similarly.\n\n\"I actually used to be right wing,\" curly hair said.\n\n\"Oh, what kind of right wing?\" I asked.\n\n\"Fascist,\" he said.\n\n\"Sorry, did you say fascist?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if he was being serious. Looking at his friends, I had a sense\nthey\u2019d heard some version of this conversation before. I struggled with words\nfor a moment, then asked what initially radicalized him.\n\n\"It started in 2020. As we all know, COVID was bullshit, the vaccine was\nbullshit\u2014\"\n\n\"Wait, what?\" I said, still unsure if he was messing with me. \"Did you say the\nvaccine is bullshit? Are you vaccinated?\"\n\nHis friends, visibly uncomfortable, tried to change the subject.\n\nI asked what led him to leave the right. \"The right wing is stupid,\" he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a culture of stupidity.\u201d He ranted about this sincerely for a while.\n\n\"So, you said you\u2019re on the left now?\" I asked him. \"What kind of left wing\nare you?\"\n\n\"Fascist,\" he said, laughing.\n\nA sticker from the magazine (Caroline Haskins / Hell Gate)\n\nI struck up a conversation with a tall woman who said her name was Alice. She\nwas holding a red sticker that said \"HAVE YOU SEEN A UFO?\" I asked Alice if\nshe\u2019s ever seen a UFO. She has.\n\nReferring to it as a UAP (\"unidentified aerial phenomenon\"), Alice said she\nsaw it a little north of Jacksonville, Florida. This was a few years ago. She\nsaid there was a cigar-shaped object jolting about the sky, unnaturally fast,\nat roughly the same altitude as a nearby commercial jet. Alice noted that the\ncigar shape was likely due to bending light, and that there were multiple\nmilitary facilities nearby.\n\nLater, she mentioned being an investor in \"hard tech\" like chips and nuclear\nenergy.\n\n\"I\u2019m working with defense and intelligence people,\" Alice said. \"I can\u2019t say\nmuch.\"\n\nAt one point, I approached a group of three: two women and a man. One woman\nwas UFO Alice. The other was a tall blonde woman wearing one of the black\n\"PRAXIS MAGAZINE\" baseball caps that were being given out. She said, with a\ngush of pride, that she was one of the people who put together the magazine.\nIt took more than a year of work. I asked what her name was, but she either\ndidn\u2019t hear me or ignored the question.\n\nThe man also didn\u2019t give his name. It was only after the party that I realized\nhe was Eric Wollberg, Praxis\u2019s former \"head of community\" and one of its first\nemployees. Wollberg told Curbed in 2022 that he \"used to work for the\ngovernment of Israel,\" and reportedly compared what it would take to form\nPraxis to the formation of Israel. He left Praxis about a year ago to start\n\"Prophetic,\" which sells halo-shaped wearables that use \u201cneurostimulation\u201d to\ntry to induce lucid dreams.\n\nWollberg didn\u2019t talk about any of that. He introduced himself as the grandson\nof a \"really famous opera singer\" and monologued passionately about opera\u2019s\n\"image problem.\"\n\n\"Operas are filled with old people and retirees, and that's an issue,\"\nWollberg said. The solution, he argued, is to make it a fancy night out for\nyoung people. He believes opera\u2019s decline began when dress codes became less\nformal. He said young people want to participate in an \"upper class social\ndynamic.\"\n\nWollberg also linked opera\u2019s decline to people undervaluing \"Western culture.\"\nThe other women nodded in agreement. Nostalgic promotion of \"Western\" culture\nis a known dog-whistle for a branch of far right politics defined by bigotry.\nFormer Praxis employees told Mother Jones in 2023 that when they were hired,\nthey got book recommendations that included \u201cBronze Age Mindset\" by the far-\nright influencer who goes by \"Bronze Age Pervert.\" It warns about \"the enemies\nof Western man and the enemies of beauty\" with racism, antisemitism, misogyny,\nand homophobia.\n\nWollberg spoke reverently of two particular pages in Praxis Magazine: One page\nshows the invitation to an 1865 opera performance of \"Tristan and Isolde\" in\nGermany, and the other has a black and white photo of the performers.\n\nI would later learn that these pages are directly followed by a two-page\nspread of anime girls with enormous racks, all captioned with platitudes like\n\"Your life is only as important as you make it.\"\n\n(Caroline Haskins / Hell Gate)\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve seen pictures of Dryden Brown, I needed a guy to identify him\nfor me because so many people fit his demographic. He was standing in front of\nthe DJ in a thick white sweater\u2014not dancing, but talking with two friends.\n\n\"Hey Dryden, I\u2019m Caroline Haskins, the freelance journalist who emailed you\nearlier,\" I said. \"You added me to the guest list.\" He and his friends looked\nat me silently.\n\n\"Sorry for, uh, my lip balm just exploded,\" I said, forcing a laugh, thinking\nthey were looking at my shirt. (About ten minutes earlier, I realized that the\ntinted lip balm I had been nervously fidgeting with all night had opened and\nstained my white button-down with berry-colored splotches. I was afraid this\nmade me look like a toddler.) More silence. \"Anyway I was just wondering,\nwhat\u2019s your goal, or the goal, of Praxis Magazine?\u201d\n\nBrown took out his phone and started taking a video of the DJ. I thought he\nwould take a short video and then answer my question. Instead, he took a\n360-degree shot that ended behind him, and walked away without saying a word.\n\nLater, I described this to a man who said he knows Brown. He said Brown\ndoesn\u2019t like journalists.\n\nPraxis Magazine spread (Caroline Haskins / Hell Gate)\n\nOn Thursday morning, I flipped through Praxis Magazine. It's thick, with its\n200 pages printed in what\u2019s clearly very high-quality paper. In many ways,\nit\u2019s a beautiful magazine. The colors are lush and vibrant, the images are\ncrisp, and there are gorgeous graphics on almost every page. It\u2019s also very\nbizarre.\n\nThe magazine makes an effort to be provocative that\u2019s excruciatingly heavy-\nhanded. It often feels like the moodboard of a teenager who\u2019s trying very hard\nto be edgy.\n\nThere\u2019s a memorial page for Theodore John Kaczynski (the Unabomber), and a\npetition to grant clemency to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road. There\u2019s\nphotos from Praxis parties, including one of Dasha Nekrasova, co-host of the\npodcast Red Scare. There\u2019s a photo of four young women smiling with the\ncaption, \"Fifteen years ago, these girls would have been following Julian\nCasablancas around on tour. Instead, they were born too late and have to\npretend to care about things like AI and crypto in order to sleep around.\"\nThese are broken up by archival photos and posters, especially from the 90s\nand 2000s, and old neoclassical paintings.\n\n(Caroline Haskins / Hell Gate)\n\nThere are just nine written essays and articles, all very short. One of them\nis by Miles Routledge, also known as \"Lord Miles,\" best known for getting\ncaptured by the Taliban and befriending his captors. He wrote about getting\n\"Tea With The Taliban.\" Another one is by Casey Krol, who runs a website\ncalled \"Truth about Fluoride.\" His article simply lays out his (scientifically\ndubious) case for why fluoride is harmful to humans. Another is an interview\nwith Bryan Johnson, the 46-year-old who is creating a cult of personality\naround his quest to spend his fortune becoming biologically equivalent to an\n18-year-old.\n\nThe front and back covers, as well as many, many pages inside, are dedicated\nto a single photoshoot. In the photos, female models wear oversized men\u2019s\nsuits and masks of a few former presidents: Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, and\neither Ronald Reagan or JFK (it\u2019s hard to tell.) They point large rifles at\n\"hostages,\" all professionally-dressed men posing in surrender. Later, the\nmodels take off their masks and sprawl out on a cash-laden floor. One points\nher rifle suggestively into her mouth.\n\n(Caroline Haskins / Hell Gate)\n\nThe magazine seems designed to bombard the reader with images and narratives\nof impending violence and doom. Conveniently, readers can join Praxis and\nescape all of that. There\u2019s Praxis stickers, and pages where you can sign a\n\"residency grant\" to the \"Eternal City of Praxis.\"\n\nThe six editors of the magazine all went by pseudonyms. Two of them are\ncharacters from Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged.\" One is a James Bond character.\nWhat caught my eye was \"Dennis Weekend,\" a person who does not exist anywhere\nexcept for a small X/Twitter account. It has just a few dozen followers,\nincluding crypto influencers, Truth About Fluoride, and ShapeShift CEO Erik\nVoorhees, who was a hostage in the aforementioned photoshoot. It only has 101\nposts, and they\u2019re overwhelmingly bigoted. Most have at least one slur, often\nthe n-word. It\u2019s dripping with the fake irony that has characterized far-right\nonline speech for ages.\n\n\"Google, generate an image of epic muscular black women In charge of running\nAuschwitz,\" he posted in February. \"It's called drag because you dress up like\na scary girl and drag children away to molest them,\" he wrote a few days\nlater.\n\nAccording to Praxis Magazine\u2019s masthead, he\u2019s on the \"Print Team.\"\n\nAlready a user?Log in\n\n## Thanks for reading!\n\n### Give us your email address to keep reading two more articles for free\n\nSee all subscription options\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on X (formerly Twitter)\n  * Share on Email\n\nCaroline Haskins\n\nCaroline Haskins is a freelance reporter.
