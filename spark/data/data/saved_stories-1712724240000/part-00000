Apparently an actual animal carcass was involved... Look, all I\nknow for sure is that some employees got upset and complained, there was an\ninternal investigation by Corporate, and eventually that manager was offered\nanother role in a strange state far away from us.\n\nI worked for Apple over a decade ago, during what many current and former\nemployees have described as the end of the Golden Years of Apple Retail. That\nmagical era when the company purportedly cared about nothing more than\nproviding a incredible experience to its employees and its customers.\n\nApple's Credo, given to all retail employees in a little booklet that fit in\nthe back of our lanyards, led with the simple phrase: Enriching lives. The\nfirst sentence inside that booklet read: \"At Apple our most important\nresource, our soul, is our people.\" I would go on to repeat that phrase\nverbatim, with no hint of irony, to hundreds of employees. The Credo was how I\nlived for three years, through the good times and the not-so-good times. I\nembodied its words\u2014I infused them into every training session I ran. They\ninformed how I made decisions.\n\nAt Apple, we were told that every team member was a steward of the brand. Each\ninteraction, however slight, was an opportunity to connect and deepen a\nrelationship with customers and potential customers. Our actions as\nindividuals reflected the brand, and therefore, our values as individuals and\nthe brand's values were the same. Implicit was the idea that each of us had a\nresponsibility to be good stewards. We were often trusted\u2014nay!\u2014instructed to\nmake the decision we thought was best for the customer. It was not uncommon to\nask a manager on the floor what we should do in any particular situation, only\nto have them respond, \"What do you think we should do?\" Sometimes that meant\nspending an extra 30 minutes with a trepidatious new iPhone owner to show them\nthe ropes of their device so they could leave the store with the confidence\nthey needed to truly love it. Sometimes it meant loosening our return policy.\n\nAnd then there were situations where it meant truly changing lives. Something\nthat sticks with me to this day was the time I was answering phones in Back of\nHouse. In the midst of informing callers of our store's hours and helping\nothers book Genius Bar appointments, a call came through with a person on the\nother end who sounded frantic, dismayed. He said he was rushing to the city\nbecause his wife called him from the ER of the children's hospital a couple\nblocks away from our store. Their young child had fallen down the stairs and\nwas unresponsive. His wife realized only after arriving at the hospital that\nher iPhone's battery was nearly depleted, and she couldn't find a charger. She\nwas worried that it would stop working while she was trying to keep the rest\nof the family informed, and the husband asked me if there was any way that he\ncould pay for a charger over the phone and have someone get it to the\nhospital. At that time, we weren't equipped to handle purchases over the phone\nlike that, so I told him, \"Don't worry. I'll get a charger to your wife.\"\n\nWhen I told my manager I wanted to comp a charger and run it over to the\nhospital, there was zero hesitation. I mean, what's a $29 piece of plastic\nmean to the richest company in the world when it means the world to this\nfamily? So we zeroed it out in our system and I ran to the ER and left it with\nstaff members who assured me they would take it to the wife.\n\nI never heard back from the family. I don't know what happened with their kid.\nBut I do know that I did the right thing, and it was Apple that made me feel\nlike that was the only choice I had.\n\nI promise that I am not telling that story to brag about how fucking amazing I\nam or anything, but rather paint a picture of how Apple got me to believe for\na long time that it was, in fact, different. And, yeah, I'll be the first to\nadmit that I left the company instilled with a bit of unrelenting optimism.^1\nIn my experience, there was something magical in the way that Apple's\nidealistic rhetoric often connected with reality. It is unusually adept at\ncreating ardent supporters, oftentimes out of its most dedicated employees.\nThese were people who wanted to be a part of something bigger, who wanted to\nmake a difference. True believers, some would say. Fans, cheerleaders, shills,\napologists, cult members, whatever you call them. But when the company you\nwork for emphatically declares that a core part of its existence is to make\nthe world a better place, and then seems to live up to that promise, it's hard\nfor all but the most jaded cynic to not get swept up in the fervor.\n\nIt was for me. And that helped convince me for a long time that Apple's more\ncapitalistic inclinations were somehow... Noble? How could it be anything but?\nApple believed in their people, their most important resource, their soul.\nRetail wasn't some second-class citizen that existed merely to peddle their\nwares. It was an integral part of helping people build relationships with the\ncompany and its technology. Apple Stores weren't stores. They were community\ncenters. They were places to be.^2\n\nSure, most days working at the Apple Store was like working for any fucking\nretail store. And yeah, I did, of course, find it strange how much Apple\nemphasized statements in the Credo like: \"We are at our best when we deliver\nenriching experiences that help owners of our products get more out of our\ntechnology and out of themselves,\" while placing equal, if not more emphasis\non statements like: Sell more AppleCare.^3 But these were desperate times, so\nI suppose I can understand why I might've forgiven a bit of philosophical\nmisalignment.\n\nThe point is, it's not like I didn't see the cracks in the fa\u00e7ade. \"The\nRitual\" wasn't the first time I cocked my head to the side and thought,\n\"Ummmm... Is everything on the up and up here?\" But with the benefit of\nhindsight, it does stand out as a notable example of how someone in leadership\nmight respond when empowered to make a decision that best reflects the values\nof the brand. What else do you do when the threat of missing quota looms large\noverhead?\n\nThink different. Call the shaman.\n\nIs that what Tim wanted? Is that what Steve would've wanted? Who's to say?\n\nBut I do know that other cracks come to mind. Some decisions effectively\nshifted the entirety of the store's morale overnight. Like the time Tim Cook\nhired interminable dope, John Browett, whose claim to fame prior to joining\nApple was resuscitating British retailer, Dixons. He did this, of course, by\ncutting swathes of staff and milking customers for every last penny (sorry:\npence) in every shitty, scummy way possible. Obviously, this was a completely\nsensible hire for the richest company in the world whose stores generated more\nrevenue per square foot than any other retailer. John brought a unique\napproach to elevating the prestige of the Apple Store by... cutting staff down\nto the point where nearly every shift was run by a skeleton crew, and\nintroducing new, innovative customer service opportunities such as \"One-to-\nMany,\" where Specialists, Creatives, and Geniuses alike were expected to\nwrangle multiple customers at once and perform shared interactions.^4 In\npractice, it felt as though we were no longer supposed to care about\nmeaningful, personalized connections with our customers. Instead, if there was\na group of people hanging around the iPads, our job was now to try and execute\nmultiple iPad transactions at one time. Do as much as possible with as few\nresources as possible.^5\n\nAnyway, John was very, very successful and went on to enjoy a long and\nillustrious career on the Apple Executive Team.\n\nThen there was Frank (not his real name).\n\nWorking at a flagship location in a major city, Frank's was about as familiar\na face as you could get amidst the thousands of tourists and locals and\nemployees who meandered through the cavernous, limestone box every day. Frank\nwas there most days to help people buy iPhones, which was a little strange,\nconsidering he didn't work for us.\n\nAt that time, iPhones in the U.S. were almost exclusively sold with two-year\ncontracts on one of the major carriers. I'm sure many of you reading this are\nfamiliar, but in case you aren't, those two-year contracts were good, (mostly)\nguaranteed business for the service providers, and to incentivize people to\ncommit to said contract, they would subsidize the vast majority of the cost of\na new iPhone. Essentially, you commit to paying the carrier 60 bucks a month\nfor two years, and that little $1,000 pocket computer is suddenly $199. What a\ndeal! Failure to see the contract through would result in, at best, hundreds\nof dollars worth of early termination fees, or, at worst, your credit score\ntanking as a result of delinquent payments, not to mention relentless\nharassment from collections agents.\n\nSo as Specialists, our process for most iPhone transactions was to have the\ncustomer input their personal identifiable information, agree to the terms and\nconditions of the contract, and consent to a credit check. If their credit was\ngood enough, they'd sign up for a new carrier plan and walk out of the store\nwith a reasonably-priced fancy glass brick in their pocket. Easy-peasy.\n\nFrank was there to help facilitate some of those transactions, and by\n\"facilitate some of those transactions,\" I mean he would show up multiple\ntimes a day, each time with a brand-new person in tow. The people accompanying\nhim followed his lead, and they all invariably exuded an aura I can only\ndescribe as perpetual befuddlement. Frank (or other handlers in Frank's crew)\nbrought these people in, demanded whichever phone was in stock, and told his\nnew companion to complete the credit check. We were always instructed to talk\ndirectly to the person actually signing up for the contract, so that we could\nensure that they fully understood the terms of what they were signing up for.\nBut doing that meant you also had to navigate around Frank's propensity for\ninterference as he tried to commandeer and move things along, which would\nhappen frequently when the \"customer\" didn't seem to comprehend what exactly\nit was they were doing, why they were there, or what future consequences\nexisted.\n\nOftentimes, their credit wasn't good enough to get the full subsidy (or any\nsubsidy at all), and when that happened, Frank would tell them, \"Come on,\" and\nusher them of the store, only to return minutes later with someone new.^6\n\nWhen their credit was good enough for the full subsidy, they were instructed\nby Frank to create a brand new account with a new, randomly-assigned phone\nnumber\u2014always a new number. And if their credit was really good, they would\nrepeat this process with additional phones on the same newly-created account.\n\nOnce the phones were paid for, Frank would take the devices when we tried\nhanding them to the \"customer.\" Strangely, these folks were never interested\nin opening and setting up the phone in the store, like people usually did when\nthey got their hands on their shiny new product.\n\nMy colleagues and I assumed that Frank was taking these subsidized phones and\nreselling them. iPhones were a hot commodity after all! So if you could manage\nto get one for a cool 200 bucks, it wouldn't be tough to turn a profit,\nespecially if you didn't have to worry about being on the hook when AT&T or\nVerizon came knocking for their monthly payment. Of course, I don't know with\nabsolute certainty that Frank's intentions were nefarious. But we were\nsometimes selling dozens of phones to him and his partners each day, so it\nseemed... suspect, if I\u2019m being generous.\n\nIf you're reading all of that and thinking to yourself: Hey, that sounds shady\nas fuck! You know what? We did, too! It didn't take long for the conversation\namongst me and my colleagues to veer into the realm of: \"This feels criminal?\nMaybe we shouldn't be allowing this???\" I know, we were soooo dramaaaatic.\n\nFor months, we complained to our managers. Many of them shared our concerns,\nbut offered no solutions.\n\nEventually, during one of our daily meetings, we received a statement from\nstore leadership laced with the glittery, euphemism-driven Apple-speak we were\nall so accustomed to receiving from on-high: We understand your concerns. We\nbelieve it's important to provide incredible experiences to all of our\ncustomers. The way we see it, eventually these phones will end up in the hands\nof future Apple owners. Yada yada yada\u2014It's been too long to remember a direct\nquote, but, holy shit, did it feel bad.\n\nFrom their response, the message seemed clear: all that mattered was that the\nphones got sold. That we met our numbers. That we made the money. Those\niPhones would end up in a real customer's hands sooner or later. It didn't\nmatter that lives could be destroyed in the process. It didn't matter that\npeople who seemingly didn't understand what was happening were being taken\nadvantage of. It wasn't our job to police the situation. Just move the\nproduct. Grind away.\n\nAt the time, I felt dismayed, betrayed. Many of my colleagues shared similar\nsentiments: This was an injustice, and it felt like all the high-minded\nrhetoric of making the world a better place was merely there to inspire\ncomplacency. As long as we sold the iPhones, we could lie to ourselves that we\nwere doing our part in \"enriching lives.\"\n\nI don't know how many phones we sold to Frank or his compatriots in total.\nHundreds, maybe? Does it matter? From my perspective, even one was too many.\nIf we were supposedly stewards of the brand, how do you reconcile being asked\nto turn a blind eye to your own values when they no longer align with the\ncompany?\n\nThere were a lot of reasons why I left Apple. I was also tired of watching my\nfriends get strung along with the promise of promotion, only to be\ndisappointed after months and months of toiling with additional\nresponsibility, no increase in pay, and the job instead going to an external\nhire brought in from some big box retailer. I was tired of feeling manipulated\nby the empty platitudes espoused by managers. I was tired of being told that I\nwas valued for my unique skills and perspective, only to have my suggestions\nor concerns discarded in the next sentence.\n\nIn short, Apple wasn't much different than any other fucking company out\nthere, and it sucked to have that image shattered.\n\nThe fucked up thing? I look back at my time there with fondness. Fondness\nobfuscated by the patina of cynicism, but fondness nevertheless. Apple taught\nme a lot about myself. I left there a more complete person. I had a clearer\nsense of purpose and identity. A more well-defined sense of justice. I've\nalways maintained that working for Apple taught me more in three years than I\never learned floundering in college. I still believe that. I am, ultimately,\ngrateful for who I became while working there.\n\nAnd I still (mostly) love their devices. Apple has helped me get more out of\ntheir products and out of myself. Hell, I use them every single day. To create\nart and make sense of the world around me. To connect with friends and family\nmembers. To find inspiration, joy, and community. It would be dishonest to\nsimply dismiss the fact that Apple has affected my life in an immensely\npositive way.\n\nBut that comes at a cost. Even in my brief time with them over a decade ago, I\nwitnessed too many people ground up in Apple's pursuit of more. No matter how\nmuch you may believe that they are ultimately a force of good in the world,\nremember that if it ever became a choice between you and selling another\niPhone, that iPhone is going to get sold. You don't win capitalism through\naltruism. Apple is not the exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.\n\nThe company I see today. The company that has rooted itself in so many\nindustries and leveraged its influence in said industries to stifle\ncompetition. The company that approaches regulation with spite, that seems to\nrelish in any opportunity to flex their muscles of malicious compliance. The\ncompany that has built up a walled garden so all-encompassing that it feels\ndamn near impossible to escape. The signs were always there.\n\nI used to read the Credo and think that \"At Apple our most important resource,\nour soul, is our people,\" was a promise. But when I read that now, it feels\nlike a threat. Like Apple doesn't intend to nurture its most important\nresource. It intends to consume them.\n\n^1 2,000 word essays wistfully reminiscing about your former employer don't\nwrite themselves, after all.\u2b0f\n\n^2 That's not some overwrought narrative flourish on my part\u2014that is how\nApple's own training materials described Apple Stores.\u2b0f\n\n^3 I am, unfortunately, having a hard time finding that one in the Credo.\u2b0f\n\n^4 Shoulda called it \"One-too-Many,\" amirite?\u2b0f\n\n^5 Believe me when I say that when we roleplayed these interactions during the\ntraining phase of the rollout, it was insufferable.\u2b0f\n\n^6 The real kicker was when you'd leave the store through the employee\nentrance and see a few cars parked on the street packed with the faces of\nFrank, his other handlers, and the \"friends\" he had brought in.
