Iverson, is a\nnotation that generalises the Kronecker delta, which is the Iverson bracket of\nthe statement x = y. It maps any statement to a function of the free variables\nin that statement. This function is defined to take the value 1 for the values\nof the variables for which the statement is true, and takes the value 0\notherwise. It is generally denoted by putting the statement inside square\nbrackets:\n\nIn other words, the Iverson bracket of a statement is the indicator function\nof the set of values for which the statement is true.\n\nThe Iverson bracket allows using capital-sigma notation without restriction on\nthe summation index. That is, for any property of the integer , one can\nrewrite the restricted sum in the unrestricted form . With this convention,\ndoes not need to be defined for the values of k for which the Iverson bracket\nequals 0; that is, a summand must evaluate to 0 regardless of whether is\ndefined.\n\nThe notation was originally introduced by Kenneth E. Iverson in his\nprogramming language APL,^[1]^[2] though restricted to single relational\noperators enclosed in parentheses, while the generalisation to arbitrary\nstatements, notational restriction to square brackets, and applications to\nsummation, was advocated by Donald Knuth to avoid ambiguity in parenthesized\nlogical expressions.^[3]\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\nThere is a direct correspondence between arithmetic on Iverson brackets,\nlogic, and set operations. For instance, let A and B be sets and any property\nof integers; then we have\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\nThe notation allows moving boundary conditions of summations (or integrals) as\na separate factor into the summand, freeing up space around the summation\noperator, but more importantly allowing it to be manipulated algebraically.\n\n### Double-counting rule[edit]\n\nWe mechanically derive a well-known sum manipulation rule using Iverson\nbrackets:\n\n### Summation interchange[edit]\n\nThe well-known rule is likewise easily derived:\n\n### Counting[edit]\n\nFor instance, Euler's totient function that counts the number of positive\nintegers up to n which are coprime to n can be expressed by\n\n### Simplification of special cases[edit]\n\nAnother use of the Iverson bracket is to simplify equations with special\ncases. For example, the formula\n\nis valid for n > 1 but is off by 1/2 for n = 1. To get an identity valid for\nall positive integers n (i.e., all values for which is defined), a correction\nterm involving the Iverson bracket may be added:\n\n### Common functions[edit]\n\nMany common functions, especially those with a natural piecewise definition,\nmay be expressed in terms of the Iverson bracket. The Kronecker delta notation\nis a specific case of Iverson notation when the condition is equality. That\nis,\n\nThe indicator function, often denoted , or , is an Iverson bracket with set\nmembership as its condition:\n\nThe Heaviside step function, sign function,^[1] and absolute value function\nare also easily expressed in this notation:\n\nand\n\nThe comparison functions max and min (returning the larger or smaller of two\narguments) may be written as\n\nand\n\nThe floor and ceiling functions can be expressed as\n\nand\n\nwhere the index of summation is understood to range over all the integers.\n\nThe ramp function can be expressed\n\nThe trichotomy of the reals is equivalent to the following identity:\n\nThe M\u00f6bius function has the property (and can be defined by recurrence as^[4])\n\n## Formulation in terms of usual functions[edit]\n\nIn the 1830s, Guglielmo dalla Sommaja used the expression to represent what\nnow would be written ; he also used variants, such as for .^[3] Following one\ncommon convention, those quantities are equal where defined: is 1 if x > 0, is\n0 if x = 0, and is undefined otherwise.\n\n## Notational variations[edit]\n\nIn addition to the now-standard square brackets [ \u00b7 ] , and the original\nparentheses ( \u00b7 ) , blackboard bold brackets have also been used, e.g. \u27e6 \u00b7 \u27e7 ,\nas well as other unusual forms of bracketing marks available in the\npublisher's typeface, accompanied by a marginal note.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Boolean function\n  * Type conversion in computer programming: many languages allow numeric or pointer quantities to be used as boolean quantities\n  * Indicator function\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Kenneth E.
