Over the preceding eight years, we had\npublished six games as a lean and mean duo, but the time had come to expand.\n\nIn 1993 and 1994 we invested our own money to develop the 3D0 fighting game,\nWay of the Warrior. In the summer of 1994 we finished it and sold the rights\nto Universal Studios. At the same time we agreed to a \u201chousekeeping\u201d deal with\nUniversal, which meant moving to LA, and for me bailing out on my M.I.T. PhD\nhalfway. It certainly didn\u2019t turn out to be a bad decision.\n\nJason and I had been debating our next game for months, but the three-day\ndrive from Boston to LA provided ample opportunity. Having studied arcade\ngames intensely (yeah, in 1994 they were still relevant) we couldn\u2019t help but\nnotice that 2 or 3 of the leading genres had really begun making the\ntransition into full 3D rendering.\n\nRacing had, with Ridge Racer and Virtua Racing. Fighting, with Virtua Fighter.\nAnd gun games, with Virtua Cop. Racing was clearly 100% the better in 3D, and\nwhile Virtua Fighter wasn\u2019t as playable as Street Fighter, the writing was on\nthe wall.\n\nSensing opportunity, we turned to our own favorite genre, the character\nplatform action game (CAG for short). In the 80s and early 90s the best\nsellers on home systems were dominated by CAGs and their cousins (like \u201cwalk\nto the right and punch\u201d or \u201cwalk to the right and shoot\u201d). Top examples were\nMario, Sonic, and our personal recent favorite, Donkey Kong Country.\n\nSo on the second day of the drive, passing Chicago and traveling through\nAmerica\u2019s long flat heartland, fed on McDonalds, and accompanied by a gassy\nLabrador/Ridgeback mix (also fed on McDonalds), the idea came to us.\n\nWe called it the \u201cSonic\u2019s Ass\u201d game. And it was born from the question: what\nwould a 3D CAG be like? Well, we thought, you\u2019d spend a lot of time looking at\n\u201cSonic\u2019s Ass.\u201d Aside from the difficulties of identifying with a character\nonly viewed in posterior, it seemed cool. But we worried about the camera,\ndizziness, and the player\u2019s ability to judge depth \u2013 more on that later.\n\nJason, Andy & Morgan on arriving at Universal\n\nBefore leaving Boston we\u2019d hired our first employee (who didn\u2019t start full\ntime until January 1995), a brilliant programmer and M.I.T. buddy of mine\nnamed Dave Baggett. We were also excited to work closely with Universal VP\nMark Cerny, who had made the original Marble Madness and Sonic 2. In\nCalifornia, in 1994, this foursome of me, Jason, Dave, and Mark were the main\ncreative contributors to the game that would become Crash Bandicoot.\n\nWe all agreed that the \u201cSonic\u2019s Ass,\u201d game was an awesome idea. As far as we\nknew, no one had even begun work on bringing the best-selling-but-notoriously-\ndifficult CAG to 3D. Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, was said to be\nworking on Yoshi\u2019s Island, his massive ode to 2D action.\n\nBut an important initial question was \u201cwhich system?\u201d\n\nThe 3D0 was DOA, but we also got our hands on specs for the upcoming Sega\nSaturn, the Sega 32X, and the mysterious Sony Playstation. The decision really\ndidn\u2019t take very long. 3D0, poor 3D power, and no sales. 32X, unholy\nFrankenstein\u2019s monster \u2013 and no sales. Saturn, also a crazy hybrid design, and\nreally clunky dev units. Then there was the Sony. Their track record in video\ngames was null, but it was a sexy company and a sexy machine \u2013 by far the best\nof the lot. I won\u2019t even bring up the Jaguar.\n\nSo we signed the mega-harsh Sony \u201cdeveloper agreement\u201d (pretty much the only\nnon-publisher to ever do so) and forked out like $35,000 for a dev unit. Gulp.\nBut the real thing that cinched the deal in Sony\u2019s favor though wasn\u2019t the\nmachine, but...\n\nBefore we continue to part 2 below, my parter and friend Jason Rubin offers\nthe following thoughts on this section:\n\nAndy and I always liked trying to find opportunities that others had missed.\nFill holes in a sense. We had done Way of the Warrior in large part because\nthe most popular games of the time were fighting games and the new 3DO system\ndidn\u2019t have a fighting game on it. Our decision to do a character action game\non the PlayStation was not only based on bringing the most popular genre on\nconsoles into the 3D, but also because Sega already had Sonic and Nintendo\nalready had Mario. Instead of running headlong into either of these creative\ngeniuses backyard, we decided to take our ball to a field with no competition.\n\nFilling a hole had worked to an extent with Way of the Warrior. The press\nimmediately used Way as a yardstick to make a comparison point against other\nsystems and their fighting games. This gave it a presence that the game itself\nmight never have had. And as a result, ardent fans of the system would leap to\ndefend the title even when perfectly fair points were made against it. The\ndiagonal moves were hard to pull off because the joypad on the 3DO sucked? No\nproblem, said the fans, Way of the Warrior plays fantastically if you just\nloosen the screws on the back of the joypad.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t the same effect work with a character action game on PlayStation?\n\nAnd remember, at the time these games were the top of the pile. It is hard to\nlook at the video game shelves today and think that only 15 years ago childish\ncharacters dominated it. There were first person shooters on the PC, of\ncourse, but sales of even the biggest of them couldn\u2019t compare to Mario and\nSonic. Even second tier character games often outsold big \u201cadult\u201d games.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to forget how many possible alternatives there were along the\nway. Most of Nebraska was filled with talk of a game called \u201cAlosaurus and\nDinestein\u201d which was to be back to the future like plot with dinosaurs in a 2d\nside scrolling character action game. I still like the name.\n\nThe \u201cSonic\u2019s ass\u201d nomenclature was more than a casual reference to the blue\nmascot turned 90 degrees into the screen. It defined the key problem in moving\na 2d game into the third dimension: You would always be looking at the\ncharacters ass. This might play well (it had never been tried) but it\ncertainly would not be the best way to present a character.\n\nOur solution, which evolved over the next 2 years, was multi-fold. First, the\ncharacter would start the game facing the screen (more on this later). Second\nthere would be 2d levels that guaranteed quality of gameplay and a chance to\nsee the character in a familiar pose allowing comparison against old 2d games.\nAnd third, we would attempt the reverse of a Sonic ass level \u2013 the run INTO\nthe screen \u2013 which became the legendary boulder levels. [ NOTE from Andy, more\non that in part 4 ]\n\nIt may have been this very Sonic\u2019s ass problem that caused Naka-san to \u201ccop\nout\u201d of making a true 3D game called Nights for Saturn. I also believe, but\nhave no proof, that he felt so unsure of the move to 3D that Sega didn\u2019t want\nto risk Sonic on that first experimental title. Instead they created a new\ncharacter. This lost Sega the goodwill that Sonic would have brought to the\nthree way game comparison that eventually ensued. That ended up working to our\nfavor.\n\nOf course Miyamoto-san did not have this problem. He created a truly new type\nof character action game with Mario 64. The controls and open world allowed\nyou to see the character from all sides. Eventually this proved to be the\nfuture of 3d Character games. But at the time it had disadvantages. More on\nthat later.\n\nThe concept of making a mascot game for the PlayStation was easy. The odds of\nsucceeding were next to nil. Remember, we were two 24 year olds whose biggest\ntitle to date had not reached 100,000 units sold! But if there was something\nwe never lacked it was confidence.\n\nNEXT PART [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] \u201cparts\u201d 12-13 are brand\nnew Jan 2012.\n\nIf you liked this post, follow me at:My novels: The Darkening Dream and\nUntimed or the video game post depot or win Crash & Jak giveaways!Latest hot\npost: War Stories: Crash Bandicoot  \n---  \n  \nThe Crash Bandicoot in-game model.
