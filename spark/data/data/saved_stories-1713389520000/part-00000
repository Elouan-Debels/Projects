week\n\nIt is great to have you here\n\nI will be sharing a lot of profitable resources this year.\n\nYou will be glad you subscribed\n\nIf I asked you what an idea was?\n\nHow would you define it?\n\nFor thousands of years,\n\nHuman Beings have created a lot of amazing things.\n\nAnd the Genesis of everything created has always been ideas.\n\nTalking of Genesis.\n\nWhen God wanted to create the world, he first designed it based on the ideas\nhe got.\n\nThat light in Genesis 1:3 was talking more about Revelation knowledge than\nlight as you know it.\n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t until Genesis 1:16 that the Sun and the Moon came into the\npicture\n\nEven in this current age, we use a light bulb to visualize what getting an\nidea looks like.\n\nNow back to ideas.\n\nIn Genesis Chapter One he declared (designed) how everything would be.\n\nThen In Genesis Chapter Two, he started building.\n\nThe NIV Translation used the word \u201cform\u201d to describe this process.\n\nOne insight that stuck with me most is in Genesis 2:5\n\nGod didn\u2019t send the rains or allow plants to grow until he created Man.\n\nHe only planted the Garden of Eden after he created Man ( Genesis 2:7-8)\n\nWherever there is no responsibility, growth cannot occur.\n\nSo as you read this article,\n\nUnderstand that your ideas are seeds that need the right environment to grow.\n\nAnd you are a major part of that environment.\n\nToday, I want to help you simplify everything about ideas.\n\nThere are a lot of paths that this can take.\n\nBut I will draw a boundary for this article around these key points:\n\n  * How to handle ideas you can\u2019t work on yet.\n\n  * How to create a personal roadmap that accommodates all your ideas (even the ones that don\u2019t seem related)\n\n  * How to compound efforts and build future ideas faster\n\nBefore I proceed, let me talk about what I call the theory of the complete\nthought\n\n####\n\nThe Theory Of the Complete Thought\n\nAs you already know.\n\nIdeas rarely come fully formed.\n\nYou need to brood on them and research before discovering a perceived best\npoint of approach.\n\nBut how do you even optimize your brain to get the best ideas?\n\nSome years back I started paying more attention to this problem and I created\na theory on how to achieve this.\n\nImagine that an idea is a cartoon of Indomie\n\nAnd your brain is a factory.\n\nYour conscious mind is the loading dock\n\nWhile your subconscious mind is the factory machinery that does most of the\nwork.\n\nBefore a carton of Indomie makes it to the loading dock\n\n40 packs of Indomie need to be neatly packed inside and sealed.\n\nNo matter how fast orders need to be delivered.\n\nThe factory will never ship out cartons containing 20 or 30 packs.\n\nIt always has to be that 40 packs.\n\nThe 40 packs in this analogy are the insight that you gather over a period of\ntime.\n\nMy attitude towards reading dramatically changed when I got this\nunderstanding.\n\nI remember telling an acquaintance in school then to read a particular book.\n\nAnd he asked me, how much he would be paid when he was done reading the book.\n\nI shook my head and smiled.\n\nIf only he knew.\n\nAs you study the works of people who have gone ahead of you.\n\nIt can be through text, video, or even audio.\n\nYou get a glimpse into their world and you gather insights that left on your\nown would have taken you decades to access.\n\nAs you go around gathering these insights\n\nYour subconscious mind sorts them into cartons based on relevance.\n\nThis activity is carried out behind the scenes, you don\u2019t feel or sense it\nhappening.\n\nOnce a carton is full, your subconscious mind seals the carton and pushes it\nout to the loading dock (conscious mind)\n\nAnd that\u2019s how you get an idea.\n\nYou now have this thing that rocks your world without being able to fully\nfigure out its origins.\n\nA lot of things can fill up that carton faster.\n\nI have found out that the faster a carton gets filled, the more likely you can\nguess where most of the insights that formed that idea came from.\n\nThis is my theory of how ideas are formed.\n\nIf you have any to share,\n\nHit the like button and drop a comment at the end of this article\n\nAll in all, a life devoted to learning is very important.\n\nThe more you read, the better the ideas you get.\n\nReading has a great role in managing ideas.\n\nLet\u2019s take a dive into the main article and see.\n\n###\n\nHow to handle ideas you can\u2019t work on yet.\n\nI wasn\u2019t always an online writer.\n\nAfter I completed secondary school in 2011.\n\nI knew that I would follow some unconventional paths in life when it came to\nbuilding a career.\n\nMy foray into newspapers helped me discover blogging and Information\nmarketing.\n\nHowever, I lacked the resources ( a laptop/capital) to start.\n\nThese days with a Smartphone, you can start blogging.\n\nThere were not even smartphones then.\n\nThe closest thing that we had to a Smartphone then was the BlackBerry Phones.\n\nWith no resources or even a mentor.\n\nIt was easy to give up, but I didn\u2019t\n\nMy uncle later gifted me his old Nokia phone in 2012.\n\nIt had Opera Mini and could access the Internet.\n\nSo I spent the next four years reading all I could about blogging and building\nan online brand.\n\nI was privileged to get a Laptop in late 2016\n\nHowever, I still lacked the resources needed to host a standard blog that I\ncould monetize.\n\nSo I just set up a free WordPress blog and started publishing articles.\n\nI had no traffic, so I shared the links with people in my circle.\n\nFast forward to January 2017.\n\nI discovered Steemit, like Medium there was already an audience on the\nplatform.\n\nIt was also easy to set up a blog there and start writing.\n\nI did that and started publishing four to five articles weekly.\n\nWithin three months, I crossed 1 Million Naira in earnings.\n\nNow you might say that I made my first million in three months.\n\nBut it took me five years.\n\nEverything that I had learned from 2011 until that point made that earning\npossible.\n\nSome people started blogging on Steemit when they saw my earnings but didn\u2019t\neven make 10% of that after months of blogging.\n\nNot because they were not smart.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have my level of insight, and some were also discouraged when they\ndidn\u2019t get my level of results and gave up fast.\n\nAs a coach and mentor, I have had conversations with people who have ideas\nthey can\u2019t work on.\n\nAnd it is mostly because they lack the skills needed to bring it to life (\nespecially technical skills)\n\nThey always tell me that they are learning the skill or waiting for when they\ncan afford to pay someone to build the product.\n\nGiving equity as payment rarely works.\n\nThe person would rather build their ideas instead.\n\nAnd most times, people with ideas rarely want to give significant equity to\nthose who want to accept equity.\n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nIf you fall into this category, these are some steps that you need to take.\n\n####\n\nLearn and Document\n\nMy favorite quote on preparing to work on ideas comes from Abraham Lincoln.\n\n> I will study and prepare myself, and one day my time will come.\n\nImagine I stopped learning about blogging and building an online brand because\nI didn\u2019t have a laptop in 2011.\n\nI would have wasted those years and when the laptop finally comes, I will have\nto start learning from scratch.\n\nOr worse, used it only for school assignments/projects and movies.\n\nWhen there is no vision, you can\u2019t take proper advantage of resources.\n\nThe Bible even went as far as saying you will perish.\n\nThe \u201cperish\u201d there is not physical death.\n\nYou kill your time doing things that don\u2019t add to your future.\n\nIt\u2019s the same way the death that Adam and Eve experienced after eating that\napple was spiritual.\n\nThe essence of life is found in vision, you must live for something bigger\nthan you.\n\nSo while you are waiting to work on that idea.\n\nLearn all you can about it and document any resource that comes your way.\n\nI am an expert documenter.\n\nThere are some things that I documented in 2017 that I just went back to this\nyear.\n\nCreate an online portal and dump things that you discover there\n\n####\n\nUpskill Fast\n\nIt is impossible to master all the skills required to build a product at once.\n\nBut mastering one skill is a great start.\n\nYou will need to go deep into that skill and monetize it richly.\n\nYour greatest issue at this point is distractions.\n\nI made significant progress (Monetary and relationships) with writing before I\neven started adding other skills.\n\nYou can keep saving money and working for others until you learn what it takes\nto kickstart your own thing.\n\nNow at this stage, you have the skill to bear part of that responsibility and\nthen money or clout to get others to work with that project on you.\n\nIf you have a great track record in your field, it will even be easier to get\npeople who will agree to accept only equity to work with you.\n\nMost of the time people reject equity because they don\u2019t have faith in you to\npull off the product.\n\nThink of the biggest people in your industry,\n\nIf they present with an amazing idea and tell you to be a co-founder that will\nget only equity for a start.\n\nWould you accept the offer?\n\nI can think of a few people I can accept such offers from.\n\nBut you need consistency and focus to get there.\n\nBelow is a roadmap framework that you can adapt.\n\n####\n\nHow To Create a Roadmap for Your Ideas\n\nMany companies create a public/private roadmap when launching.\n\nIt contains mini-projects that they have to complete to push their product\nforward.\n\nTwo years ago, I realized that companies aren\u2019t the only brands that need\nroadmaps.\n\nThe purpose of roadmaps is to give a sense of direction and ensure focus.l\n\nI needed that as an individual when it came to the things that I was building.\n\nBut having a list of things to do is not enough\n\nHow do you determine what to start first and when to add something else to the\nmenu?\n\nThere are two filters that you can use:\n\n  * Skill Based milestones\n\n  * Income Based milestones\n\nNow there are also two contexts for these milestones:\n\n  * You work for yourself (digital/physical products and consulting)\n\n  * You work for others (Full-time and Freelance)\n\nThere are two major skills required to create a successful product\n\n  * Building skills ( Coding and Design )\n\n  * Selling skills ( Sales and Marketing\n\nFor example, got an idea to build a savings app that allows crypto savings,\n\nThese are potential scenarios.\n\n####\n\nScenario One\n\nYou are already working in a form of Financial institution,\n\nAnd have the insights/skills/money needed to pull off the project.\n\nIf you lack any of the above, you can create a roadmap to get it.\n\nHere are some things that can be on your Roadmap\n\n  * Having a savings of 10 Million Naira\n\n  * Learn basic coding to build version one of the app if you have only selling skills\n\n  * Find a co-founder who trusts you and can code for equity.\n\n  * Learn all you can about Crypto ( take an extensive course)\n\nAnother reason people reject equity is if it comes from someone without\nsignificant building or sales skills.\n\nWhose major contribution to the product is only ideas.\n\nIdeas are cheap, talk doesn\u2019t cook rice.\n\n####\n\nScenario Two\n\nYou have been building a personal brand around finances.\n\nThis is actually a great start.\n\nYou most likely have thousands of people following your content.\n\nIt is easier to get your first set of users/customers from them.\n\nHere are some things to be in your roadmap\n\n  * Having a savings of 10 Million Naira\n\n  * Learn basic coding to build version one of the app\n\n  * Leverage your brand to get an experienced co-founder\n\n  * Learn all you can about Crypto and write about it to educate your readers/subscribers\n\nTargets are powerful because they are part of the things that keep you\nfocused.\n\nIf you not, you will jump from idea to idea without getting much done.\n\nTargets will also help you know which business opportunity is temporary.\n\nThere are things that you need to work only on for a season to get funds.\n\n####\n\nAdding To Your Roadmap\n\nBelow is a visualization of my roadmap.\n\nYou can see that it is divided into two sections:\n\n> Building - Projects I am actively working on.\n>\n> Brooding - Projects that require me to hit milestones to start.\n\nYou mostly like to know the projects under Building so I can show you.\n\nBut I have changed the names/business models of those under Brooding to\ndescriptions for the sake of privacy.\n\nAnd some have been outright censored.\n\nFocus on the lesson, not the project.\n\nThe Building/ Brooding filter protects my time and energy.\n\nDay One is a holding company for my brand.\n\nThere are times when you read about someone's stories or see a product out\nthere.\n\nInstead of picking up the lessons from the content/product, you have a desire\nto copy that idea.\n\nMost of the time, you have no business building that kind of product, but the\nrewards grab your focus.\n\nNow there might be a chance that such a product is a great fit for you.\n\nWhat I do at this stage is to create a folder for it under Brooding.\n\nAdd some initial thoughts and move on.\n\nIf I keep getting more and more insights from that idea and keep seeing more\nand more ways what I am doing currently adds to it.\n\nI move it up my idea rankings.\n\nCurrently, the next project that I am most likely to work on is the\n\u201cPublishing Business\u201d\n\nAnd I will use how I am preparing for it to show you the power of compounding\nefforts.\n\n###\n\nHow to Compound Efforts and Build Faster\n\nMoney is not the only thing that you can earn compound interest on.\n\nYou can earn compound interest on any efforts that you are putting into the\nprojects that you are working on now.\n\nFour years ago, I discovered a type of publishing business that was very\nlucrative.\n\nThat market is currently worth over $14 Billion\n\nI ignored some years back it because I didn\u2019t have what it took to start.\n\nBut it kept popping up now and then.\n\nI finally added it to my roadmap but still knew that I had a lot of work to\ndo.\n\nNo matter how course creators tell you, it takes a lot of work to build a\nbrand and make money from something.\n\nThere are only a few cases where you can leverage the network/partnership of\nsomeone else to make money faster.\n\nBut you still have to work.\n\nGoing into that publishing business will take a lot of work.\n\nAnd that work will take away time from Day One, Superday, and Sound Money.\n\nSo I checked these three things that I was building and pinpointed a place to\ncompound efforts.\n\nI decided to start converting one newsletter episode each month to a book.\n\nThe first book went live last week.\n\nIt was adapted from this article that I wrote in January.\n\nFebruary book is already cooking and will be out soon.\n\nPublishing these books helps me achieve two things:\n\n  * Grow Day One: The 40 Hours book launch netted me over 700 new subscribers\n\n  * Master Publishing: When it is time to work on the publishing project, I will achieve faster results.\n\nAnother example is this\n\nI have been learning how to. Run Ads to grow Sound Money.\n\nAs someone who has focused only on organic content for the past eight years\n\nIt has not been an easy experience.\n\nBut learning it will impact not just Sound Money, but it will help me grow\nother projects.\n\n> P.S. You mustn\u2019t do this, you can pay just someone to run Ads for you. I\n> have other reasons why I want to learn.\n\nI have to stop here for the sake of brevity.\n\nYou can share some of the things that you are working on and other ideas in\nthe comments below and I will give you tips.\n\n> P.S. Don\u2019t share business ideas if you are not comfortable.\n\nI am also opening three call slots next week.\n\nOne-hour sessions where you share your ideas and challenges\n\nAnd I will personally help you set up a Roadmap that works.\n\nBook a Slot with the link below, make sure to read the call description before\nbooking one\n\nIdea Session with Ajulu\n\nLast week, I published a book on productivity.\n\nIt has been getting lots of thanks and testimonies since it was published.\n\nI am not charging money for the book.\n\nYou can access it for free as long as you are a subscriber.\n\n#### On 40 Hours: A Book For A Time Like This\n\nAjulu\n\n\u00b7\n\nMar 9\n\nRead full story\n\nHow impactful was today\u2019s episode on ideas?\n\nDo you have questions?\n\nDrop your feedback in the comments below.\n\nI respond to all comments.\n\n### Subscribe to Day One\n\nBy Ajulu \u00b7 Launched 4 years ago\n\nA weekly newsletter about the skills and systems you need to achieve your\npersonal and business goals.\n\n32 Likes\n\n32\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Ultimate Guide To Managing Your Ideas\n\najulu.substack.com\n\n20\n\nShare\n\n20 Comments\n\nDaniel JesudarasimiMar 20Liked by AjuluThis is really insightful.
