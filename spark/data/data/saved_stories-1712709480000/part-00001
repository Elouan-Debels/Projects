I\nimmediately thought of one of the chapters that I had wanted to write for Make\nIt So: Interaction Design Lessons from Sci-Fi, but had been cut for space\nreasons, and that is: How is evil (in sci-fi interfaces) designed? There were\nsome sub-questions in the outline that went something like this.\n\n  * What does evil look like?\n  * Are there any recurring patterns we can see?\n  * What are those patterns?\n  * Why would they be the way they are?\n  * What would we do with this information?\n\nI made that presentation. It went well, I must say. Then I forgot about it\nuntil Nikolas Badminton of Dark Futures invited me to participate in his\nfirst-ever San Francisco edition of that meetup in November of 2019. In\nhindsight, maybe I should have done a reading from one of my short stories\nthat detail dark (or very, very dark) futures, but instead, I dusted off this\n45 minute presentation and cut it down to 15 minutes. That also went well I\ndaresay. But I figure it\u2019s time to put these thoughts into some more formal\nplace for a wider audience. And here we are.\n\nNah, they\u2019re cool!\n\n## Wait...Evil?\n\nThat\u2019s a loaded term, I hear you say, because you\u2019re smart, skeptical, loathe\nbandying about such dehumanizing terms lightly, and relish in nuance. And\nyou\u2019re right. If you were to ask this question outside of the domain of\nfiction, you\u2019d run up against lots of problems. Most notably that\u2014as Socrates\nsaid through Plato in the Meno Dialogues\u2014by the time someone commits something\nthat most people would call \u201cevil,\u201d they have gone through the mental\ngymnastics to convince themselves that whatever they\u2019re doing is not evil. A\nhandy example menu of such lies-to-self follows.\n\n  * It\u2019s horrible but necessary.\n  * They deserve it.\n  * The sky god is on my side.\n  * It is not my decision.\n  * I am helpless to stop myself.\n  * The victim is subhuman.\n  * It\u2019s not really that bad.\n  * I and my tribe are exceptional and not subject to norms of ethics.\n  * There is no quid pro quo.\n\nAnd so, we must conclude, since nobody thinks they\u2019re evil, and most people\ndesign for themselves, no one in the real world designs for evil.\n\nOh well?\n\nBut, the good news we are not outside the domain of fiction, we\u2019re soaking in\nit! And in fiction, there are definitely characters and organizations who are\nmeant to be\u2014and be read by the audience as\u2014evil, as the bad guys. The Empire.\nThe First Order. Zorg! The Alliance! Norsefire! All evil, and all meant to be\numabiguously so.\n\nfrom V for Vendetta.\n\nAnd while alien biology, costume, set, and prop design all enable creators to\nsignal evil, this blog is about interfaces. So we\u2019ll be looking at eeeevil\ninterfaces.\n\n## What we find\n\nNote that in earlier cinema and television, technology was less art directed\nand less branded than it is today. Even into the 1970s, art direction seemed\nto be trying to signal the sci-fi-ness of interfaces rather than the character\nof the organizations that produced them. Kubrick expertly signaled HAL\u2019s\npsychopathy in 1969\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey, and by the early 1980s more and\nmore films had begun to follow suit not just with evil AI, but with interfaces\ncreated and used by evil organizations. Nowadays I\u2019d be surprised to find an\ninterface in sci-if that didn\u2019t signal the character of its user or the source\norganization.\n\nEvil interfaces, circa Buck Rogers (1939).\n\nNote that some evil interfaces don\u2019t adhere to the pattern. They don\u2019t in and\nof themselves signal evil, even if someone is using them to commit evil acts.\nPhysical controls, especially, are most often bound by functional and\nergonomic considerations rather than style, where digital interfaces are much\nless so.\n\nMany of the interfaces fall into two patterns. One is the visual appearance.\nThe other is a recurrent shape. More about each follows.\n\n### 1\\. High-contrast, high-saturation, bold elements\n\nEvil has little filigree. Elements are high-contrast and bold with sharp\nedges. The colors are highly saturated, very often against black. The colors\nvary, but the palette is primarily red-on-black, green-on-black, and blue-on-\nblack.\n\n#### Mostly red-on-black\n\nThe overwhelming majority of evil technologies are blood-red on black. This\npattern appears across the technologies of evil, whether screen, costume,\nsets, or props.\n\nI just stopped uploading examples for space reasons.\n\nRed-on-black accounts for maybe 3/4 of the examples I gathered.\n\n#### Sometimes a sickly green\n\nLess than a quarter focus on a sickly or unnatural green.\n\n#### Occasionally calculating blue\n\nA handful of examples are a cold-and-calculating blue on black.\n\nA note of caution: While evil is most often red-on-black, red does not, in and\nof itself, denote evil. It is a common color to see for urgency warnings in\nsci-if. See the tag for big red label examples.\n\nNot evil, just urgent.\n\n### 2\\. Also, evil is pointy\n\nEvil also has a lot of acute angles in its interfaces. Spikes, arrows, and\nspurs appear frequently. In a word, evil is often pointy.\n\n## Why would this be?\n\nWhere would this pattern of high-saturation, high-constrast, pointy, mostly\nred-on-black come from?\n\nNow, usually, I try and run numbers, do due diligence to look for counter-\nevidence, scope checks, and statistical significance. But this post is going\nto be less research and more reason. I\u2019m interested if anyone else wants to\nrun or share a more academically grounded study.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine that these patterns in sci-fi are arbitrary. While a great\nnumber of shows may be camping on tropes that were established in shows that\ncame before them, the tropes would not have survived if they didn\u2019t tap some\nground truth. And there are universal ground truths to work with.\n\nMy favorite example of this is the takete-maluma effect from phonosemantics,\nfirst tested by Wolfgang K\u00f6hler in 1929. Given the two images below, and the\ntwo names \u201cmaluma\u201d and \u201ctakete\u201d, 95\u201398% of people would rather assign the name\n\u201ctakete\u201d to the spiky shape on the left, and \u201cmaluma\u201d to the curvy shape on\nthe right. This effect has been tested in 1947 and again in 2001, with\nslightly different names but similar results, across cultures and continents.\n\nWhat this tells us is that there are human universals in the interpretation of\nforms.\n\nI believe these universals come from nature. So if we turn to nature, where do\nwe see this kind of high-contrast, high-saturation patterning? There is a\nplace. To explain it, we have to dip a bit into evolution.\n\n## Aposematics: Signaling theory\n\nEvolution, in the absence of heavy reproductive pressures, will experiment\nwith forms, often as a result of sexual selection. If through this\nexperimentation a species develops conspicuousness, and the members are tasty\nand defenseless, that trait will be devoured right out of the gene pool by\npredators. So conspicuousness in tasty and defenseless species is generally\nselected against. Inconspicuousness and camouflage are selected for.\n\nWould not last long outside of a pig disco.\n\nBut if the species is unpalatable, like a ladybug, or aggressive, like a\nwolverine, or with strong defenses, like a wasp, the na\u00efve predator learns\nquickly that the conspicuous signal is to be avoided. The signal means Don\u2019t\nFuck with Me. After a few experiences, the predator will learn to steer clear\nof the signal. Even if the defense kills the attacker (and the lesson lost to\nthe grave), other attackers may learn in their stead, or evolution will favor\ncreatures with an instinct to avoid the signal.\n\nIn short, a conspicuous signal that survives becomes a reinforcing\nadvertisement in its ecosystem. This is called aposematic signaling.\n\nThere are many interesting mimicry tactics you should check out (for no other\nreason that they can explain things like Dolores Umbridge) but for our\npurposes, it is enough to know that danger has a pattern in nature, and it\ntends toward, you guessed it, bold, high-contrast, high saturation patterns,\nincluding spikes.\n\nLooking at the color palette in nature\u2019s examples, though, we see many\nsaturated colors, including lots of yellows. We don\u2019t see yellow predominant\nin sci-fi evil interfaces. So why is sci-fi human evil red & black? Here I go\nout on a limb without even the benefit of an evolutionary theory, but I think\nit\u2019s simply blood and night.\n\nNot blood, just cherry glazing.\n\nWhen we see blood on a human outside of menstruation and childbirth, it means\nsome violence or sickness has happened to them. (And childbirth is pretty\nviolent.) So, blood red is often a signal of danger.\n\nAnd we are a diurnal species, optimized for daylight, and maladapted for\nnight. Darkness is low-information, and with nocturnal predators around, high-\nrisk. Black is another signal for danger.\n\nThis is fine.\n\nAnd spikes? Spikes are just physics. Thorns and claws tell us this shape means\npointy, puncturing danger.\n\nSo I believe the design of evil in sci-fi interfaces (and really, sci-fi shows\ngenerally) looks the way it does because of aposematics, because of these\npatterns that are familiar to us from our experience of the world. We should\nexpect most of evil to embody these same patterns.\n\n## What do designers do with this?\n\nSo if I\u2019m right, it bears asking, What we do with this? (Recall that the \u201ctag\nline\u201d for this project is \u201cStop watching sci-fi. Start using it.\u201d) I think\nit\u2019s a big start to simply be aware of these patterns. Once you are, you can\nuse it, for products and services whose brand promise includes the anti-\nsocial, tough-guy message Don\u2019t Fuck with Me.\n\nOr, conversely, if you are hoping to create an impression of goodness, safety,\nand nurturance, avoid these patterns. Choose different palettes, roundness,\nand softness.\n\n## What should people not do with this?\n\nAs a last note, it\u2019s important not to overgeneralize this. While a lot of\nevil, like, say, Nazis, utilize aposematic signals directly, some will adopt\nmimicry patterns to appear safe, welcoming, and friendly. Some evil will wear\nbeige slacks and carry tiki torches. Others will surround themselves with in-\ngroup signals, like wrapping themselves in the flag, to make you think they\u2019re\na-OK. Still others will hang fuzzy-wuzzy kitty-witty pictures all over their\noffice.\n\nIs there a better example in sci-fi? @me.\n\nDo not be fooled. Evil is as evil does, and signaling in sci-fi is a narrative\nconvenience. Treat the surface of things as a signal to consider, subordinate\nto a person\u2014or a group\u2019s\u2014actual behavior.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Reddit\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis entry was posted in ~Meta and tagged best of, evil.

But really, red and black? They\u2019re making it really easy for the UEF to\ncast them as villains!\n\nReply\n\n  4.
