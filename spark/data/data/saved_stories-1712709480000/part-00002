I must use four editors each day to get my\nstudies done, because not one of them does everything.\"\n\nThe wizard nods sagely, and asks, \"And what would you propose that will solve\nthis obvious dilemma?\"\n\nThe student thinks carefully for several minutes, and his face then lights up\nin delight. Excitedly, he says, \"Well, it's obvious. I will write the best\neditor ever. It will do everything that the existing four editors do, but do\ntheir jobs better, and faster. And because of my new editor, the world will be\na better place.\"\n\nThe wizard quickly raises his hand and smacks the apprentice on the side of\nhis head. The wizard is old and frail, and the apprentice isn't physically\nhurt, but is shocked by what has happened. He turns his head to face the\nwizard. \"What have I done wrong?\" he asks.\n\n\"Fool!\" says the wizard. \"Do you think I want to learn yet another editor?\"\n\nImmediately, the apprentice is enlightened.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
