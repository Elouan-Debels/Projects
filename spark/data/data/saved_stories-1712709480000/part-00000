Can it be\nstopped?\n\nAmelia Bates / Grist\n\nRobert Langellier\n\nPublished\n\n    Mar 27, 2024\n\nTopic\n\n    Climate + Agriculture\n\nShare/Republish\n\n    \n\nCopy Link Republish\n\nCopy Link Email SMS Twitter Facebook\n\nRepublish Reddit LinkedIn\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with the Food & Environment Reporting\nNetwork, a nonprofit news organization.\n\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cfescue belt,\u201d named for an exotic grass called tall fescue,\ndominates the pastureland from Missouri and Arkansas in the west to the coast\nof the Carolinas in the east. Within that swath, a quarter of the nation\u2019s\ncows \u2014 more than 15 million in all \u2014 graze fields that stay green through the\nwinter while the rest of the region\u2019s grasses turn brown and go dormant.\n\nBut the fescue these cows are eating is toxic. The animals lose hooves. Parts\nof their tails and the tips of their ears slough off. For most of the year,\nthey spend any moderately warm day standing in ponds and creeks trying to\nreduce fevers. They breathe heavily, fail to put on weight, and produce less\nmilk. Some fail to conceive, and some of the calves they do conceive die.\n\nThe disorder, fescue toxicosis, costs the livestock industry up to $2 billion\na year in lost production. \u201cFescue toxicity is the most devastating livestock\ndisorder east of the Mississippi,\u201d said Craig Roberts, a forage specialist at\nthe University of Missouri Extension, or MU, and an expert on fescue.\n\nBy the early 20th century, decades of timber-cutting and overgrazing had left\nthe ranching region in southern states barren, its nutrient-rich native\ngrasses replaced by a motley assortment of plants that made poor forage. Then,\nin the 1930s, a University of Kentucky professor spotted an exotic type of\nfescue growing in the mountains of eastern Kentucky, which seemed to thrive\neven on exhausted land. Unlike most native grasses, Kentucky-31, as it was\ncalled, stayed green and hearty through the winter. Ranchers found the species\nremarkably resilient and, if not beloved by cattle, edible enough to plant.\nOver the next 20 years, much of the country\u2019s southern landscape was\ntransformed into a lush, evergreen pasture capable of supporting a robust\ncattle industry.\n\nCattle in Elk Creek, Missouri, submerge themselves in a pasture pond to cool\noff in between grazing on non-native fescue grass, which can raise a cow\u2019s\ntemperature and give them a constant fever, one of the symptoms of fescue\ntoxicity. Terra Fondriest via FERN\n\nAs early as the 1950s, however, ranchers began to notice tall fescue\u2019s\ndisturbing effects: One study showed that cattle had to be fenced out of other\ngrasses before they\u2019d touch fescue. When they did eat it, the cows saw only\none-sixth of their normal weight gain and lost eight pounds of milk production\na day.\n\nBetween the cells in fescue grows an endophyte, a fungus living symbiotically\ninside the grass. The endophyte is what makes the fescue robust against\ndrought and overgrazing, but it\u2019s also what makes it toxic. When scientists\nengineered a version of fescue without the fungal endophyte, in 1982, its\nhardiness disappeared and ranchers saw it die out among their winter pastures.\nFarmers learned to live with the health impacts of the toxic version, and\ntoday it remains the primary pasture grass across 37 million acres of\nfarmland.\n\nIt\u2019s a longstanding problem, and it\u2019s spreading. Warming temperatures from\nclimate change are now expanding the northern limit of the fescue belt, and\nthe grass is marching into new areas, taking root on disturbed land, such as\npastures. Northern Illinois and southern Iowa could already be officially\nadded to the fescue belt, Roberts said, introducing toxicosis to new farming\nregions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming not just present but part of their normal pastures,\u201d he said,\nnoting that he increasingly gets calls from farmers in this region who are\nwondering what to do.\n\nAmelia Bates / Grist\n\nAs more farmers find themselves facing the challenges of toxic fescue, there\nare two strategies emerging to finally solve the decades-old problem, though\nin diametrically opposed ways. One involves planting a modified version of\ntall fescue \u2014 called \u201cfriendly fescue\u201d \u2014 in which the toxic endophyte has been\nreplaced by a benign one that still keeps the grass hearty and green all\nwinter. Another would abandon fescue altogether and restore the native grasses\nand wildflowers that once dominated the region, as well as help revitalize\nnatural carbon sinks and fight climate change.\n\nFor a variety of reasons \u2014 some economic, some cultural \u2014 neither solution has\nreally taken hold with most fescue belt ranchers. But the debate embodies the\nagricultural industry in the era of climate change: As ecosystems shift and\nextreme weather makes farming even more precarious, ranchers are facing tough\ndecisions about how to adapt their land use practices. What is best for\nbusiness, and will that ultimately be what\u2019s best for the land and for the\nchanging climate?\n\nFriendly fescue hit the market in 2000, developed by Pennington Seed Inc. It\nlooks identical to toxic fescue and behaves almost identically, thus requiring\nlittle change to the ranching habits of fescue belt farmers over the last 70\nyears.\n\nIt would seem an ideal fit for an industry focused on maintaining the status\nquo amid climate challenges. But ranchers have been slow to embrace it. For\none thing, friendly fescue, formally known as \u201cnovel endophyte fescue,\u201d costs\ntwice as much as the toxic variety \u2014 $4 for a pound of seed versus $2. And\nreplacing one grass with another is labor-intensive; a 2004 report by the\nUniversity of Georgia said it would take farmers who made the switch about\nthree years to break even. Matt Poore, a professor of animal science at North\nCarolina State University, chairs the Alliance for Grassland Renewal, a\nnational organization dedicated to eradicating toxic fescue. Yet Poore, who\nalso raises cattle, has only converted 30 percent of his fields, preferring to\ndo it slowly. \u201cThe fear of failure is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re sticking\nyour neck out there when you go to kill something that looks really good.\u201d\n\nMany farmers would like to avoid the risk of total pasture makeovers, if they\ncan. Until now, toxic fescue ranchers have found ways to scrape by, and a\nparade of treatments have come out through the decades, promising relief from\ntoxicosis.\n\nThey can supplement their cows\u2019 diets with grain (an expensive remedy), or cut\nand dry their fescue and feed it to them as hay, which reduces its toxicity\nsomewhat. They can dilute the toxicity of their fields by planting clover\namong the fescue, or clip the especially toxic seed heads before cows can\ngraze them. They can try to genetically select cows with moderate fescue\ntolerance, which can salvage as much as a quarter of their losses.\n\nPoore counts over 100 such remedies. \u201cIf you do enough of those things you can\ntell yourself you don\u2019t really have a problem,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the lush\nground cover that fescue displays in winter is seductive.\n\nAn overgrazed non-native fescue pasture in Elk Creek, Missouri. Terra\nFondriest via FERN\n\nA lack of trust, too, is a problem. In the early 1980s, when researchers\nintroduced endophyte-free fescue, it was hailed as the answer to toxicosis, a\nway to save the industry. Ranchers trusted the scientists, and they lost a lot\nof money when that version withered in the fields. The sting of that debacle\npersists as researchers try to convince ranchers to trust friendly fescue.\n\u201cThe sins of the past have come back to haunt us,\u201d MU\u2019s Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s\ngoing to take a while to overcome that screwup.\u201d\n\nEvery March, Roberts and other scientists travel around the fescue belt giving\nworkshops on friendly fescue to anyone who will listen. He tries to assuage\nfarmers who are worried about the expense and labor of pasture conversion.\n\nThere aren\u2019t good numbers on adoption rates, because seed companies are\nguarded about how much they sell. But Robert says he knows it\u2019s rising. Some\nstates promote it more than others, by offering cost-shares, for example, and\nhosting workshops like those Roberts leads.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that endophyte-free fescue \u2014 the one that fails in the winter\n\u2014 remains on the market. The state of Kentucky even provides cost-share\nfunding for ranchers who switch from toxic fescue to endophyte-free fescue.\nAnd several Kentucky ranchers said they were still unclear on the differences\namong toxic fescue, endophyte-free fescue, and friendly fescue. Farm supply\nstores often don\u2019t even stock friendly fescue seed, as it\u2019s less shelf stable.\n\nRead Next\n\nThe next pandemic could strike crops, not people\n\nSaima Sidik\n\nRoberts noted that toxic fescue exudes fluids that \u201cpretty much destroy the\nfood web,\u201d poisoning insects that quail and other creatures feed on. A 2014\nstudy showed that climate change could increase the endophyte\u2019s toxicity.\nFriendly fescue soil, by contrast, has more microbes than toxic fescue soil.\nAnd water quality is better with friendly fescue, since sick cows don\u2019t have\nto congregate in streams and ponds to stay cool.\n\nDespite the confusion and slow uptake, Roberts is optimistic, noting the 30\nyears it took for farmers to embrace the revolution of hybrid corn in the\nearly 20th century. And he can point to some wins. Darrel Franson, a Missouri\nrancher who remembers the endophyte-free fescue debacle, nevertheless decided\nto take the risk, converting his 126 acres to friendly fescue. He loves the\nresults. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue with the production potential of tall fescue and\nthe length of season it gives us,\u201d he said.\n\nRoberts\u2019 employer, the University of Missouri, is betting that a modified\nversion of exotic fescue will appeal to ranchers more than the idea of\nconverting to native grasslands. \u201cWhat we\u2019re promoting is environmentally\nfriendly as well as economically sound,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you seed a nontoxic\nendophyte and add legumes [to dilute pasture toxicity], that works as well as\nanything, and we have a lot of data on it. It may take another 20 years for it\nto catch on, but it\u2019s not going away. It\u2019s too good.\u201d\n\nFor decades, Amy Hamilton and her late husband, Rex, fought fescue toxicosis\nin Texas County, Missouri, the heart of the Ozarks. They watched their and\ntheir neighbors\u2019 cows lose tail switches, hooves, and parts of their ears to\ngangrene. Finally, they\u2019d had enough.\n\nBut the Hamiltons didn\u2019t reach for an artificially modified version of an\nexotic grass. Instead, in 2012, they converted 90 acres of pasture to native\nwarm-season grasses, using their own money and cost-share funding from the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service, or\nNRCS. The effects were immediate; the next year they documented increased\nconception and weaning rates in their cows and calves. Since then, they\u2019ve\nconverted another 75 acres. A former soil conservationist with a degree in\nagronomy, Hamilton\u2019s mission became to annihilate fescue, on her property and\nacross the fescue belt.\n\nAmy Hamilton stands in a patch of prairie blazing star in one of the Hamilton\nfamily\u2019s native grazing fields in Elk Creek. Terra Fondriest via FERN\n\nI visited Hamilton\u2019s ranch in November 2022. She and her family run about 45\ncows and 150 bison. She and her daughter Elizabeth Steele, who helps run the\nfamily\u2019s native seed company, walked through a pasture where fescue grew 15\nyears ago. Now big bluestem, little bluestem, and sunflowers fill the main\nbody of the pasture, and freshwater cordgrass and ironweed decorate a creek\u2019s\nedge. Quail have returned for the first time in decades.\n\nUnlike the Hamiltons\u2019 neighbors\u2019 pastures, however, this field was not green;\nmost of the plants had gone dormant for winter. Hamilton reached through a\nthick mass of bluestem and pointed to two diminutive, green plants: wild rye\nand a sedge species, cool-season grasses that provide a native analogue to\nfescue \u2014 and, crucially, winter forage.\n\n\u201cThis is what would have been here pre-settlement,\u201d said Steele, referring to\nthe land before Europeans arrived. \u201cA functioning grassland with different\nplants serving different functions. Nature\u2019s design is not for monocultures.\u201d\n\nTo understand the fescue-native debate requires an understanding of the\necological tradeoff between warm- and cool-season grasses. Simply put, warm-\nseason grasses grow in the summer, harnessing the strong sunshine to grow tall\nand robust; then they go dormant in the winter. Cool-season grasses do the\nopposite, putting their evolutionary resources into frost-tolerance. As a\nresult, they tend to be smaller than their warm-season counterparts, providing\nless biomass and less food per plant for the cows that graze them.\n\nCattle belonging to the Hamiltons graze on freshly cut eastern gamagrass that\nwas harvested for seed on the family\u2019s land in Elk Creek. Terra Fondriest via\nFERN\n\nHamilton and Steele have decided to bet on biodiversity. Instead of a year-\nround monoculture of fescue, they have a biodiverse mix of warm- and cool-\nseason grasses, along with wildflowers. It\u2019s not as visibly lush as a fescue\nfield, but the benefits to cattle health, soil health, and climate resistance\nmake it worth it. \u201cIt is a kind of faith that these prairies evolved for the\ngood of the native species that were here,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nEven with the leaner cool-season grasses, their native fields produce twice as\nmuch forage as the old fescue fields and generate a much higher amount of\norganic matter, enriching the soil and allowing the pasture to hold more\nwater. A soil-health specialist from NRCS tested their soil\u2019s organic matter\ncontent before the 2012 restoration, then again five years later. The result\nwas pastureland that holds up to a half gallon more water per square foot than\na typical fescue field.\n\nIn a warming climate with more extreme droughts \u2014 much of the Ozarks was in\nsevere drought last year \u2014 that extra water storage can make a critical\ndifference for cattle and soil health. The southeastern U.S., the heart of the\nfescue belt, faces a future of more intense drought and floods. The Hamiltons\u2019\nbiodiverse style of ranching helps address both extremes, and they expect\ntheir native ecosystems will be more resilient to climate change.\n\n\u201c[The extra water] trickles into our stream through the year, as opposed to\nrunning off in a flood,\u201d said Steele.\n\nFrom left: Elizabeth Steele, her niece Scout Kipp, and sons Otis Ray and Jacob\nwork on making a native flower bouquet near Amy Hamilton\u2019s home in Elk Creek\nlast July. Terra Fondriest via FERN\n\nThe roots of native grasses also reach three times deeper than fescue roots,\nmaking them drought-resistant as well as efficient carbon sinks. Grasslands\nare uniquely good at carbon sequestration. Unlike forests, they store more\nthan 80 percent of their carbon underground, where it\u2019s more safely\nsequestered than in aboveground trees where the carbon can potentially\nvolatilize and return to the atmosphere.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, intensive grazing of monocultures makes it hard to sequester\ncarbon. A 2019 study, published in the journal Nature, showed that native,\nbiodiverse, restored grasslands hold more than twice as much carbon as\nmonocultures. The deep roots of the Hamiltons\u2019 native species lock carbon deep\nunderground, where it can take hundreds or even thousands of years to return\nto the atmosphere.\n\nIn the years since the Hamiltons converted their fields, the use of native\nwarm-season grasses has gained momentum in the ranching industry. The\nUniversity of Tennessee \u2014 firmly in the fescue belt \u2014 opened the Center for\nNative Grasslands Management in 2006 aimed at getting ranchers to incorporate\nnative warm-season grasses, known as NWSGs, into pastureland. The Missouri\nDepartment of Conservation conducts workshops to familiarize ranchers with\nNWSGs. Research by the center found that pastures of native switchgrass\nfinancially outperform fescue pastures.\n\nAnd Patrick D. Keyser, the center\u2019s director, says native grasses\nsignificantly outperform fescue in climate resiliency. Fescue, he says, wants\nit to be 73 degrees and rainy every other day. \u201cThink Oregon or Scotland,\u201d he\nsaid. Native warm-season grasses in the fescue belt, on the other hand, can go\nweeks with blistering heat and drought without a problem. \u201cTo them, the worst\nclimate projections that we\u2019re getting really aren\u2019t a big deal. From a\nresiliency standpoint, they absolutely win.\u201d\n\nIf replacing fescue with natives is moving slowly in general, replacing it\nwith native cool-season grasses, to get year-round forage, remains nearly\nunheard of. As with friendly fescue, cost is partly to blame. Elizabeth\nSteele\u2019s \u201ccowboy math\u201d estimates that a native conversion today would cost\naround $365 per acre, a scary number for ranchers.\n\nAmy Hamilton holds seed from a native grass within a savannah restoration area\non Hamilton family land in Elk Creek. Terra Fondriest via FERN\n\nProponents of native conversion also face a more complicated obstacle than\ncost as they seek buy-in from ranchers. The debate over how beef cattle are\nraised is caught up in the culture war over climate change. By some estimates,\nmeat production accounts for nearly 60 percent of the greenhouse gases\ngenerated by the food system, with beef as the leading culprit. Even as the\nconcept of \u201cregenerative ranching,\u201d a method of cattle farming that tries to\nrestore degraded soil and reduce emissions, has secured a toehold in the\nindustry, \u201cclimate change\u201d remains a political term in farm country, one that\nis largely avoided.\n\nRanchers like Amy Hamilton risk being marginalized as \u201cprogressives.\u201d So while\nshe believes diverse native grasslands will make pastures more resilient to\nclimate change, she doesn\u2019t mention that when proselytizing to fellow\nranchers. Insead, she talks about increased water infiltration, more abundant\nwildlife, and improved soil health \u2014 things that matter to ranchers no matter\ntheir thoughts on climate change.\n\nShe also tells them that native conversion pencils out. Hamilton doesn\u2019t\nfertilize her pastures, and she rarely uses hay, as most ranchers do to\nsupplement their cows\u2019 fescue diet. And Steele estimates that, because native\npastures produce more forage than fescue monocultures, increased forage and\nresulting weight gain makes up for the initial conversion costs in less than\ntwo years. \u201cThe more you emulate natural systems, the less money you have to\nspend on stuff like baling machines, herbicides, toxicosis effects, and\nfertilizer,\u201d she said. That extra forage also allows ranchers to feed more\ncows. So if a rancher wants to expand their herd size, they can either expand\ntheir fescue acreage, for $3,000 an acre, or spend $365 an acre to convert the\nland they already have to natives.\n\nSaving money matters in the fescue belt. According to U.S. Department of\nAgriculture data, 60 percent of farms in Texas County, Missouri, run a\ndeficit, and every state in the fescue belt loses money on agriculture, except\nfor Illinois, which is largely a crop state.\n\n\u201cAgriculture is so hard that if you don\u2019t do it with your pocketbook in mind,\nyou can cause people to go broke. I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nAmy Hamilton stands in one of the cooled seed storage rooms at the\nheadquarters of Hamilton Native Outpost in Elk Creek. Terra Fondriest via FERN\n\nHamilton estimates that more than 100 other fescue belt ranchers she\u2019s in\ntouch with are in the process of converting some or all of their pasture to\nnative grasses. One of them, Steve Freeman, co-owns Woods Fork Cattle Company\nwith his wife, Judy, in Hartville, Missouri. Freeman has converted 80 acres of\nfescue to natives, with plans to convert 180 more in three years. In total,\nthat will make a third of his pasture diverse native grasslands.\n\n\u201cAlmost all my inspiration has come from going to [the Hamiltons\u2019] field days\nevery year and seeing what this land could be,\u201d Freeman told me on the phone.\nFor him it\u2019s not just about eradicating fescue toxicosis, it\u2019s about the whole\nsuite of benefits for biodiversity, soil health, and water retention. \u201cI\nrealized we\u2019re not going to get there with the grasses we have.\u201d\n\nFreeman notes the power imbalance between the informal effort to promote\nnative grasses and the universities and beef industry groups that are pushing\nmodified fescue. \u201cThere\u2019s no money that backs this,\u201d he said of native\nrestoration. \u201cThe novel endophytes and those kinds of things, there\u2019s a lot of\nmoney to be made. They\u2019ve helped the universities. I think [Hamilton] is\nstarting to change people\u2019s minds, but it\u2019s been 15 years of doing this.\u201d\n\nRead Next\n\nThe American chestnut tree is coming back. Who is it for?\n\nMaya L. Kapoor\n\nFor his part, MU\u2019s Roberts hears the subtle dig at his work. \u201cFriends of mine\nin conservation groups think the university professors are hooked on fescue,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThey\u2019re not. What they\u2019re hooked on is a long grazing season, good\nyield, and good quality. They\u2019re hooked on criteria, not on a species.\u201d\n\nEither way, change on this scale takes time. The University of Missouri claims\nthat 98 percent of pastures in the state are still toxic, with ranchers slowly\nopening up to either friendly fescue or native forage. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are\nranchers out there that think we\u2019re absolutely nuts,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cBut some\nof them are interested in thinking about new ways of doing things.\u201d\n\nAs we drove out to visit her cows, we passed some of her neighbors\u2019 fields. In\none, a herd of emaciated cattle had grazed a fescue field down to stubble. In\nanother, all but a few cows stood in the middle of a pond, trying to cool\nthemselves on a mild, cloudy day.\n\n\u201cThese are good people,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to make a\nliving.\u201d\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
