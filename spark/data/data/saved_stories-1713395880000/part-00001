It\u2019s not fully open to third\nparty devs yet, but there's a whole lot more to come in the future.\nDistributing your apps will be as easy as hosting a JSON file and pointing it\nat your notarized IPAs\n\nhttps://altstore.io/\n\nALT\n\nApr 17, 2024, 04:31 PM\u00b7\u00b7Ivory for Mac\n\n18boosts\u00b729favorites\n\n1h\n\nSteve Troughton-Smith @stroughtonsmith\n\nI went through the purchase & install process for AltStore in the EU, and it's\nnot really any more onerous than downloading a Mac app or installing a\nprovisioning profile. One trip to Settings to \u2018Allow\u2019, and you can tap through\nthe install dialogs in a second.\n\nThe install confirmation sheet, which provides metadata and screenshots about\nthe app and its publisher, is kinda a nice thing to have? Honestly wouldn't\nsurprise me if this system came back to macOS, too (if developers don't\nrevolt)\n\nALT\n\n1h\n\nAhnaf Mahmud @ahnafm@techhub.social\n\n@stroughtonsmith I\u2019m curious what will happen if someone outside the EU tries\nto install it\n\n1h\n\naceJacek @acejacek@mastodon.cloud\n\n@stroughtonsmith I screwed up obviously, I clicked back at the first screen.\nNow I see no way to download store or manage subscription without new payment.\n\n1h\n\nChristian Selig @christianselig\n\n@stroughtonsmith @rileytestut How do I install this in Canada I think\nEuropeans like us\n\n1h\n\nBenRiceM @BenRiceM\n\n@christianselig @stroughtonsmith @rileytestut eh, you\u2019re ok\n\nALTGIF\n\n1h\n\nChristian Selig @christianselig\n\n@BenRiceM @stroughtonsmith @rileytestut\n\nALTGIF\n\n1h\n\nBuck @buck\n\n@stroughtonsmith @rileytestut I hope there is a plan for some kind of release\noutside of the EU\n\n1h\n\nAhnaf Mahmud @ahnafm@techhub.social\n\n@buck @stroughtonsmith @rileytestut https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-\nemulator/id1048524688\n\nApp StoreDelta - Game EmulatorDelta is an all-in-one emulator for iOS.
