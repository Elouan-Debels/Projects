We asked Harvard Business School faculty members to\ndiscuss what's at stake for companies facing talent needs, and the potential\nscenarios on the horizon.\n\nAlmost one-third of Americans consider immigration the most important\n\u201cproblem\u201d that the United States faces, according to a new Gallup poll. And\nyet, companies say they need far more workers than the current system allows.\n\nSome business leaders say that visa restrictions remain too tight on visas for\nskilled and unskilled labor. Either way, immigration will be a critical issue\nduring the US election season. The carefully negotiated bipartisan bill that\nfailed in the House of Representatives earlier this year highlights the thorny\nclimate surrounding this complex system.\n\nHarvard Business School experts discuss the current quandary and potential\npolicy and corporate solutions.\n\n## William Kerr: Untangling migration and employment\n\nThe immigration system to the United States is very complex. We have many\npeople coming at many different skill levels for differing durations of stay.\nWe seek to achieve diverse national goals (employment needs, family\nreunification, humanitarian) with different types of visas. And many people\nmove across skills or visa categories during their stay.\n\nEmployment-based migration focuses on providing workers with specific skills\nto firms that need them. Most applicants hold a bachelor's degree or higher\nand there are minimum salaries that must be met for positions.\n\nVisas are requested by the employer for a specific individual. Microsoft, for\nexample, is the lead actor when it makes an H-1B application. Built into this\napproach is that Microsoft already has a job identified for the migrant, and\nthey are approaching the immigration system in a strategic manner. Often, the\nmain constraint is gaining access to the scarce visa supply\u2014there are so many\napplications for H-1B visas that a lottery system is used to allocate them.\n\nFamily-based migration makes up the bulk of the US system. In this case, the\nmigrant is the lead actor in their efforts to come to the US, and a firm is\nnot involved. Upon migration, the individual enters into a general population\nof workers from which firms draw talent. Hiring firms will be building a set\nof skills for their company and drawing upon native and foreign talent as\nbefits their local situation.\n\nWhile the employment-based and family reunification pathways are distinct, the\ntight labor market makes them more alike. Whether it's very high- or lower-\nskilled work, companies all over are frequently decrying the lack of talent\nand saying, \u201cGosh, we need to find more workers.\u201d The unemployment rate is\nstill less for computer programmers than it is for workers who take jobs in\nfast food restaurants, but both unemployment rates are at historic lows.\n\nMany organizations are starting to think about access to labor as their\nprimary revenue constraint. In some settings, like fast food, migration will\nimpact this talent access mainly by increasing the general pool of local\nworkers. In other settings, like computer programmers, employment-based visas\nallow firms to target specific individuals (including foreign students\ngraduating from US schools who need a work visa).\n\nWhat about refugees, who are becoming more common globally? Research finds\nthat refugees assimilate at an even faster rate into the economy and the\nworkplace than general migrants when they are allowed to engage in work. That\nlatter caveat is important, as in many settings, refugees face severe\nrestrictions on how they can participate in the local economy.\n\nWhen you have a lower- or mid-skilled (non-refugee) migrant coming for US work\nopportunities, their motivation may be temporary. For instance, \u201cThis is a\ngreat way for me to earn extra money for my family for 10 years. I'm going to\nsend a lot of money back home in the form of remittances. I'm going to live\nvery frugally. And then, someday, I'm going to plan to go back home.\u201d\n\nRefugees often do not share this perspective. They are fleeing bad conditions,\nand they instead want to stay and really put down significant roots. If\nrefugees desire to stay in the country permanently, they make different\ninvestments\u2014for their own workplace opportunities and for their children. This\ncan boost their long-term integration into the economy.\n\nWilliam Kerr is the D\u2019Arbeloff Professor of Business Administration at HBS and\nco-director of Harvard\u2019s Managing the Future of Work initiative.\n\n## Marco Tabellini: One negative scenario and one positive for firms\n\nGiven the current political climate, it\u2019s unlikely the US Congress will relax\nimmigration restrictions. Instead, the two most plausible scenarios are:\n\n  * A more stringent cap on immigration regardless of education and skills.\n  * A tougher approach on undocumented immigration, with enhanced border security and possibly a tougher limit on the number of unskilled immigrants, but a more flexible and less stringent approach to regulate high-skilled immigration.\n\nThe first scenario will harm US firms by reducing the supply of workers in a\ntight market. The impact will be worse in sectors that are growing faster and\nwhere immigrants\u2019 skills are more important, such as the semiconductor\nindustry.\n\nThe effects of labor scarcity are likely to be heterogeneous: Large firms may\nbe better able to either automate or offshore (or both). Small firms, instead,\nmight be forced to shut down their production. It is thus possible that\ntighter immigration restrictions will result in more concentrated markets,\nwith possibly negative consequences for US consumers, who may end up paying\nhigher prices.\n\nRestrictions on unskilled immigration might be particularly harmful for\nsectors like hospitality or agriculture, where immigrant labor cannot be\neasily replaced because US-born workers typically do not want to take these\njobs or because tasks cannot be automated.\n\nThe second scenario may be more positive for US firms. Businesses will have\neasier access to high-skilled workers, who often bring new ideas and increase\ndynamism as well as innovation. In addition, a more flexible quota system\u2014for\nexample, linked to business-cycle conditions\u2014would allow US firms to find\nworkers more easily at times of high labor demand, while shielding US-born\nworkers from labor market competition during recessions.\n\nNot all firms will benefit from a scenario in which high-skilled immigrants\nreplace unskilled ones. Reducing the number of unskilled immigrants will\nlikely hurt US firms that employ less-educated workers and those that have a\nharder time hiring US-born individuals, such as hospitality and agribusiness.\n\nA complete and sudden removal of all immigration restrictions is neither\npolitically feasible nor economically desirable. Yet, further tightening the\ncurrent immigration regime would be a major mistake.\n\nThe US economy would instead benefit from a more flexible, counter-cyclical\nsystem that depends on the conditions of labor markets. Relaxing the quotas\ncurrently in place for high-skilled immigrants would likely result in higher\ngrowth and dynamism.\n\nMarco Tabellini is an assistant professor in the Business, Government, and\nInternational Economy Unit at HBS.\n\n## Raj Choudhury: The US gains when it welcomes skilled migrants\n\nMy research focuses on the migration of skilled workers. When the US lets in\nskilled migrants, it gains in terms of innovation outcomes, and in many ways.\n\nHere are three:\n\nKnowledge is shared and then recombined. Knowledge is transferred from the\nhome countries of the migrants to the US, we found in a study we did with data\nfrom US pharmaceutical companies. And then there's a subsequent effect, which\nis the knowledge transferred from the home countries is combined with local\nknowledge in the US to create new formulations, which are new to the world.\n\nThat's something we call knowledge recombination. From the standpoint of\ninnovation, it is extremely important, in my view and given my research, that\nthe US continues to attract the best and the brightest from all over the\nworld. And the implication for US companies is that attracting skilled talent\nfrom around the world is imperative for innovation and knowledge production.\n\nSecond, H1-B visa restrictions negatively affect companies and workers. We\nhave a paper that looks at both the H1-B restrictions and the executive orders\nthat Donald Trump issued in April 2017. We found that led to an erosion of\n$100 billion of valuation for US companies.\n\nFinally, the US is losing a policy battle related to visas being issued for\nremote work. Since the pandemic, there's been a revolution in almost all\nremote worker visas around the world. The digital nomad visa is now being\nissued by close to 75 countries, including Mexico and Canada, Portugal, the\nUnited Arab Emirates, Brazil, and many other countries, with the notable\nexception of the US, where the immigration debate in Congress has been clogged\ninto stasis. And the problem is, US policymakers have not been able to\nseparate the semi-skilled and unskilled immigration policy reform from skilled\nreform.\n\nFor that reason, they've not been able to come up with the digital nomad,\nremote worker visa. Almost every other developed country around the world has\ndone it. And that's a huge missed opportunity for the US.\n\nPrithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury is the Lumry Family Associate Professor at HBS.\n\n## You Might Also Like:\n\n  * How Trump\u2019s Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric Crushed Crowdfunding for Minority Entrepreneurs\n  * In Empowering Black Voters, Did a Landmark Law Stir White Angst?\n  * Why Aren\u2019t Business Leaders More Vocal About Immigration Policy?\n\nFeedback or ideas to share?
