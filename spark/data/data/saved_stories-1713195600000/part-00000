The\nMicron CZ120 modules are PCIe Gen5 x8 modules that are 128GB or 256GB in size.\nThese are drives we saw previously at FMS 2023, but now they are running on\nthe Intel Xeon 6 platform.\n\n## Micron CZ120 CXL Memory Module Spotted at Intel Vision 2024\n\nMonths ago at FMS 2023, we saw a 256GB module working on a SPR/ EMR platform.\n\nMicron CZ120 CXL Memory Expansion Modules At FMS 2023 3\n\nAt Intel Vision 2024, this changed to seeing more production-ready drives in\n128GB and 256GB capacity. We learned a number of really interesting things.\nFirst, Micron has been doing work to get these running in a striped mode. One\noption is to use CXL memory to expand the capacity of memory, but the other\nuse case is also to provide more bandwidth. To think about this a bit\nlogically, the CXL 2.0 memory uses PCIe Gen5 lanes and so the aggregate\nbandwidth for memory can be the DDR5 memory channels at full bandwidth plus\nthe PCIe Gen5/ CXL lane bandwidth. To do this, matching the size of the CXL\n2.0 memory modules to the capacity of the RAM becomes important. Think of this\nlike doing RAID 0 across SSDs, you would want SSDs to be the same capacity.\n\nMicron CZ120 Memory Expansion Module 2\n\nThe other thing we learned is that the PCIe Gen5 x8 modules or E3.S 2T x8\nmodules offer a lot of flexibility over the Astera Labs Leo CXL Memory\nExpansion solution. As a lower-speed x8 interface, in theory, Micron could use\nDDR5 or even lower-cost DDR4 on the CXL device.\n\nMicron CZ120 Memory Expansion Module 1\n\nAt the show, Micron and Intel had these running MLC on a future Intel Xeon 6\nplatform using engineering sample CPUs.\n\n## Final Words\n\nCXL memory is one of the technologies we have been excited to use for many\nyears. We just got the updated Astera Labs Leo CXL memory expansion model so\nexpect to see more content on CXL coming soon. The current state of DDR5\nmemory is that there is physically only so much space on CPU packages to put\npins for more memory channels and only so much motherboard space to put more\nmemory. As a result, those who want more memory and more memory bandwidth will\nhave the option to use CXL soon.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * CXL\n  * Micron\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedin\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nCopy URL\n\nPrevious articleienRon HG0402XG Switch Review 4x 2.5GbE and 2x 10G Cheap\n\nEric Smith\n\nhttps://www.servethehome.com\n\nEric has been in the IT industry for over 15 years and specializes in\ninfrastructure projects.\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### Gigabyte Shows Axiado BMC for NVIDIA MGX Systems\n\n### This is the Astera Labs Aries 6 PCIe Gen6 and CXL Retimer\n\n### AMD Infinity Fabric AFL Scale Up Competitor to NVIDIA NVLink Coming to\nBroadcom Switches in PCIe Gen7\n\n#### 1 COMMENT\n\n  1.
