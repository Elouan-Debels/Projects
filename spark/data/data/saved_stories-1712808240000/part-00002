Kudos to the MTIA team!\n\nAdi Fuchs / @iamadifuchs: Interesting. MTIAv2 has a small die and 90W TDP\n(typical training accelerators are ~350-500W / 700-1000W for MCM) and about\n1/3 of H100's TFLOPs, so could be an overall win, maybe something like\nGoogle's approach of scaling out many small TPUs. Nonetheless, great times for\nchips!\n\n@squashbionic: Interesting chip, but there's a 3.6x power consumption increase\nfor ~3x performance improvement(25w->90w) ? Am I seeing that correct?\n\n@__tinygrad__: If you want to build your own training accelerator, you must\nhave your own NN framework with adoption.
