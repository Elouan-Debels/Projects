Building upon generations\nof NVIDIA technologies, Blackwell defines the next chapter in generative AI\nwith unparalleled performance, efficiency, and scale.\n\n## Look Inside the Technological Breakthroughs\n\n### A New Class of AI Superchip\n\nBlackwell-architecture GPUs pack 208 billion transistors and are manufactured\nusing a custom-built TSMC 4NP process. All Blackwell products feature two\nreticle-limited dies connected by a 10 terabytes per second (TB/s) chip-to-\nchip interconnect in a unified single GPU.\n\n### Second-Generation Transformer Engine\n\nThe second-generation Transformer Engine uses custom Blackwell Tensor Core\ntechnology combined with NVIDIA\u00ae TensorRTTM-LLM and NeMoTM Framework\ninnovations to accelerate inference and training for large language models\n(LLMs) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models.\n\nTo supercharge inference of MoE models, Blackwell Tensor Cores add new\nprecisions, including new community-defined microscaling formats, giving high\naccuracy and ease of replacement for larger precisions. The Blackwell\nTransformer Engine utilizes fine-grain scaling techniques called micro-tensor\nscaling, to optimize performance and accuracy enabling 4-bit floating point\n(FP4) AI. This doubles the performance and size of next-generation models that\nmemory can support while maintaining high accuracy.\n\n### Secure AI\n\nBlackwell includes NVIDIA Confidential Computing, which protects sensitive\ndata and AI models from unauthorized access with strong hardware-based\nsecurity. Blackwell is the first TEE-I/O capable GPU in the industry, while\nproviding the most performant confidential compute solution with TEE-I/O\ncapable hosts and inline protection over NVIDIA\u00ae NVLink\u00ae. Blackwell\nConfidential Computing delivers nearly identical throughput performance\ncompared to unencrypted modes. Enterprises can now secure even the largest\nmodels in a performant way, in addition to protecting AI intellectual property\n(IP) and securely enabling confidential AI training, inference, and federated\nlearning.\n\nLearn More About NVIDIA Confidential Computing\n\n### NVLink and NVLink Switch\n\nUnlocking the full potential of exascale computing and trillion-parameter AI\nmodels hinges on the need for swift, seamless communication among every GPU\nwithin a server cluster. The fifth-generation of NVIDIA\u00ae NVLink\u00ae interconnect\ncan scale up to 576 GPUs to unleash accelerated performance for trillion- and\nmulti-trillion parameter AI models.\n\nThe NVIDIA NVLink Switch Chip enables 130TB/s of GPU bandwidth in one 72-GPU\nNVLink domain (NVL72) and delivers 4X bandwidth efficiency with NVIDIA\nScalable Hierarchical Aggregation and Reduction Protocol (SHARP)TM FP8\nsupport. The NVIDIA NVLink Switch Chip supports clusters beyond a single\nserver at the same impressive 1.8TB/s interconnect. Multi-server clusters with\nNVLink scale GPU communications in balance with the increased computing, so\nNVL72 can support 9X the GPU throughput than a single eight-GPU system.\n\nLearn More About NVIDIA NVLink and NVLink Switch\n\n### Decompression Engine\n\nData analytics and database workflows have traditionally relied on CPUs for\ncompute. Accelerated data science can dramatically boost the performance of\nend-to-end analytics, speeding up value generation while reducing cost.\nDatabases, including Apache Spark, play critical roles in handling,\nprocessing, and analyzing large volumes of data for data analytics.\n\nBlackwell\u2019s Decompression Engine and ability to access massive amounts of\nmemory in the NVIDIA GraceTM CPU over a high-speed link\u2014900 gigabytes per\nsecond (GB/s) of bidirectional bandwidth\u2014accelerate the full pipeline of\ndatabase queries for the highest performance in data analytics and data\nscience with support for the latest compression formats such as LZ4, Snappy,\nand Deflate.\n\n### Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) Engine\n\nBlackwell adds intelligent resiliency with a dedicated Reliability,\nAvailability, and Serviceability (RAS) Engine to identify potential faults\nthat may occur early on to minimize downtime. NVIDIA\u2019s AI-powered predictive-\nmanagement capabilities continuously monitor thousands of data points across\nhardware and software for overall health to predict and intercept sources of\ndowntime and inefficiency. This builds intelligent resilience that saves time,\nenergy, and computing costs.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s RAS Engine provides in-depth diagnostic information that can identify\nareas of concern and plan for maintenance. The RAS engine reduces turnaround\ntime by quickly localizing the source of issues and minimizes downtime by\nfacilitating effective remediation.\n\n## Get Started\n\nNotify me when NVIDIA Blackwell becomes available.\n\nNotify Me\n\nProducts\n\n  * Data Center GPUs\n  * NVIDIA DGX Platform\n  * NVIDIA EGX Platform\n  * NVIDIA HGX Platform\n  * Networking Products\n  * Virtual GPUs\n\nTechnologies\n\n  * NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture\n  * NVIDIA Hopper Architecture\n  * Confidential Computing\n  * NVLink-C2C\n  * NVLink/NVSwitch\n  * Tensor Cores\n  * Multi-Instance GPU\n  * IndeX ParaView Plugin\n  * Cybersecurity - Morpheus\n\nResources\n\n  * Customer Stories\n  * Data Center Blogs\n  * Data Center GPUs Product Literature\n  * DGX Product Literature\n  * Documentation\n  * Energy Efficiency Calculator\n  * Glossary\n  * GPU Apps Catalog\n  * GPU Test Drive\n  * GTC AI Conference\n  * NVIDIA GRID Community Advisors\n  * Qualified System Catalog\n  * Technical Blog\n  * Technical Training\n  * Training for IT Professionals\n  * Where to Buy\n  * Virtual GPU Forum\n  * Virtual GPU Product Literature\n\nCompany Info\n\n  * About Us\n  * Company Overview\n  * Investors\n  * Venture Capital (NVentures)\n  * NVIDIA Foundation\n  * Research\n  * Social Responsibility\n  * Technologies\n  * Careers\n\nFollow Data Center\n\nUnited States\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Manage My Privacy\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Data\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Accessibility\n  * Corporate Policies\n  * Product Security\n  * Contact\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NVIDIA Corporation\n\nNVIDIA uses cookies to enable and improve the use of the website.
