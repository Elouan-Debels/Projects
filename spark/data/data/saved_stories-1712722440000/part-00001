Prices can\nbe viewed in units of either per 1M or 1K tokens. You can think of tokens as\npieces of words, where 1,000 tokens is about 750 words. This paragraph is 35\ntokens.\n\n### GPT-4 Turbo\n\nWith 128k context, fresher knowledge and the broadest set of capabilities,\nGPT-4 Turbo is more powerful than GPT-4 and offered at a lower price.\n\nLearn about GPT-4 Turbo\n\nModel| Input| Output  \n---|---|---  \ngpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09| $10.00 / 1M tokens| $30.00 / 1M tokens  \n  \nInput\n\n$10.00 / 1M tokens\n\nOutput\n\n$30.00 / 1M tokens\n\n## Vision pricing calculator\n\nPrice per 1K tokens (fixed)| $0.01  \n---|---  \nResized width| 150  \nResized height| 150  \n512 \u00d7 512 tiles| 1 \u00d7 1  \nTotal tiles| 1  \nBase tokens| 85  \nTile tokens| 170 \u00d7 1 = 170  \nTotal tokens| 255  \nTotal price| $0.00255  \n  \n### GPT-4\n\nWith broad general knowledge and domain expertise, GPT-4 can follow complex\ninstructions in natural language and solve difficult problems with accuracy.\n\nLearn about GPT-4\n\nModel| Input| Output  \n---|---|---  \ngpt-4| $30.00 / 1M tokens| $60.00 / 1M tokens  \ngpt-4-32k| $60.00 / 1M tokens| $120.00 / 1M tokens  \n  \nInput\n\n$30.00 / 1M tokens\n\nOutput\n\n$60.00 / 1M tokens\n\nInput\n\n$60.00 / 1M tokens\n\nOutput\n\n$120.00 / 1M tokens\n\n### GPT-3.5 Turbo\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo models are capable and cost-effective.\n\ngpt-3.5-turbo-0125 is the flagship model of this family, supports a 16K\ncontext window and is optimized for dialog.\n\ngpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is an Instruct model and only supports a 4K context\nwindow.\n\nLearn about GPT-3.5 Turbo\n\nModel| Input| Output  \n---|---|---  \ngpt-3.5-turbo-0125| $0.50 / 1M tokens| $1.50 / 1M tokens  \ngpt-3.5-turbo-instruct| $1.50 / 1M tokens| $2.00 / 1M tokens  \n  \nInput\n\n$0.50 / 1M tokens\n\nOutput\n\n$1.50 / 1M tokens\n\nInput\n\n$1.50 / 1M tokens\n\nOutput\n\n$2.00 / 1M tokens\n\n### Assistants API\n\nAssistants API and tools (retrieval, code interpreter) make it easy for\ndevelopers to build AI assistants within their own applications. Each\nassistant incurs its own retrieval file storage fee based on the files passed\nto that assistant. The retrieval tool chunks and indexes your files content in\nour vector database.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe tokens used for the Assistant API are billed at the chosen language\nmodel's per-token input / output rates and the assistant intelligently chooses\nwhich context from the thread to include when calling the model\n\nLearn about Assistants API\n\nTool| Input  \n---|---  \nCode interpreter| $0.03 / session  \nRetrieval| $0.20 / GB / assistant / day (free until 04/01/2024)  \n  \nInput\n\n$0.03 / session\n\nInput\n\n$0.20 / GB / assistant / day (free until 04/01/2024)\n\n### Fine-tuning models\n\nCreate your own custom models by fine-tuning our base models with your\ntraining data.

For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words. As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.\n\nTo learn more about how tokens work and estimate your usage...\n\n    * Experiment with our interactive Tokenizer tool.\n    * Log in to your account and enter text into the Playground. The counter in the footer will display how many tokens are in your text.\n\n  * We generally recommend that developers use either gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo, depending on how complex the tasks you are using the models for are. gpt-4 generally performs better on a wide range of evaluations, while gpt-3.5-turbo returns outputs with lower latency and costs much less per token. We recommend experimenting with these models in Playground to investigate which models provide the best price performance trade-off for your usage. A common design pattern is to use several distinct query types which are each dispatched to the model appropriate to handle them.\n\n  * Log in to your account to view your usage tracking dashboard. This page will show you how many tokens you\u2019ve used during the current and past billing cycles.\n\n  * You can set a monthly budget in your billing settings, after which we\u2019ll stop serving your requests. There may be a delay in enforcing the limit, and you are responsible for any overage incurred. You can also configure an email notification threshold to receive an email alert once you cross that threshold each month. We recommend checking your usage tracking dashboard regularly to monitor your spend.\n\n  * No, OpenAI APIs and ChatGPT Plus subscriptions are billed separately. The API has its own pricing, which can be found at https://openai.com/pricing. The ChatGPT Plus subscription covers usage on chat.openai.com only and costs $20/month.\n\n  * Yes, we treat Playground usage the same as regular API usage.\n\n  * Chat completion requests are billed based on the number of input tokens sent plus the number of tokens in the output(s) returned by the API.\n\nYour request may use up to num_tokens(input) + [max_tokens * max(n, best_of)]\ntokens, which will be billed at the per-engine rates outlined at the top of\nthis page.\n\nIn the simplest case, if your prompt contains 200 tokens and you request a\nsingle 900 token completion from the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 API, your request will\nuse 1100 tokens and will cost [(200 * 0.001) + (900 * 0.002)] / 1000 = $0.002.\n\nYou can limit costs by reducing prompt length or maximum response length,\nlimiting usage of best_of/n , adding appropriate stop sequences, or using\nengines with lower per-token costs.\n\n  * There are two components to fine-tuning pricing: training and usage.\n\nWhen training a fine-tuned model, the total tokens used will be billed\naccording to our training rates. Note that the number of training tokens\ndepends on the number of tokens in your training dataset and your chosen\nnumber of training epochs. The default number of epochs is 4.\n\n(Tokens in your training file * Number of training epochs) = Total training\ntokens\n\nOnce you fine-tune a model, you\u2019ll be billed only for the tokens you use.\nRequests sent to fine-tuned models are billed at our usage rates.\n\n  * We will be publishing an SLA soon. In the meantime you can visit our Status page to monitor service availability and view historical uptime. If your company or application has specific requirements, please contact our sales team.\n\n  * Yes.
