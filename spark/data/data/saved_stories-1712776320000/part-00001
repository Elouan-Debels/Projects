Let's look at some examples:\n\nA Gm is...| 10^9 meters  \n---|---  \nA GW is...| 10^9 watts  \nA GA is...| 10^9 amperes  \nA Gmol is...| 10^9 moles  \n  \n#### But it's different in computing!\n\nLet's look at some more examples:\n\nA 2.2 GHz CPU operates at...| 2.2 \u00d7 10^9 cycles per second  \n---|---  \n1 Gbps Ethernet transmits data at...| 10^9 bits per second  \nThe 2.4 GHz band which wireless ethernet operates within lies...| between 2.4\n\u00d7 10^9 and 2.5 \u00d7 10^9 Hz  \nA 200 GB hard drive holds...| 200 \u00d7 10^9 bytes of data  \n  \n#### But what about RAM?\n\nYou're right: If you buy a \"1 GB\" stick of RAM, it will hold 2^30 bytes of\ndata.\n\nHowever, this is a special case: Unlike everything else in the world of\ncomputing, RAM is addressed in hardware. When you're designing a piece of\nsilicon, you want to have N address lines and have every combination of zeroes\nand ones map to a memory location \u2014 to do otherwise would make the logic far\nmore complicated. Nothing else is addressed this way.\n\nFinally, even for RAM calling 2^30 bytes \"1 GB\" isn't really proper; instead,\nthe IEC binary multiplier prefix \"Gi-\" should be used.\n\n#### This is all a conspiracy by hard drive manufacturers who want to cheat us\nout of the disk space we're paying for!\n\nWe all love good conspiracy theories... but really, this isn't about evil\nmegacorporations trying to cheat you. Hard drive prices are determined almost\nentirely by competition between manufacturers, so if hard drives were labelled\nin GiB instead of being labelled in GB, we'd be paying the same number of\ndollars for the same number of bytes anyway \u2014 if this really was a global\nconspiracy, it would be one of the dumbest conspiracies ever.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
