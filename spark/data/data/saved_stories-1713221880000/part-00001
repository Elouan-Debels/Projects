Wong, who has the unanimous support of\nlawmakers in the long-ruling People\u2019s Action Party, will be sworn in at the\nnational palace later the same day, it said.\n\nLee has served as prime minister and head of the PAP since August 2004.\n\nLee announced last November that he would retire this year and has already\nnamed Wong as his designated successor. Lee originally planned to step down\nbefore turning 70, but those plans were shelved because of the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\n\u201cFor any country, a leadership transition is a significant moment. Lawrence\nand the 4G (fourth-generation) team have worked hard to gain the people\u2019s\ntrust, notably during the pandemic,\u201d Lee said in a Facebook post on Monday. \u201cI\nask all Singaporeans to give Lawrence and his team your full support, and work\nwith them to create a brighter future for Singapore.\u201d\n\nLee has said there is no reason to delay the political transition and that\npassing the baton to Wong before national elections due next year will allow\nthe 51-year-old politician to win his own mandate and take the country\nforward.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCargo ship\u2019s owner and manager seek to limit legal liability for deadly bridge\ndisaster in Baltimore\n\nUS commerce secretary hails progress at year\u2019s first meeting of Indo-Pacific\ntrade grouping\n\nUS diplomat criticizes China for using coercion and intimidation as it presses\nmaritime claims\n\nWong came to prominence while helping to coordinate Singapore\u2019s fight against\nCOVID-19. He will be the city-state\u2019s fourth leader since its independence in\n1965.\n\nPAP, one of the world\u2019s longest-serving parties, retained its super majority\nwith 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats in 2020 general elections. But that was\nits worst performance after losing some seats and support slipped.\n\nLee is the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, who became Singapore\u2019s first prime\nminister and built the resource-poor city-state into one of the world\u2019s\nrichest nations during 31 years in office. But Singapore has also been\ncriticized for its tight government control, media censorship and use of\noppressive laws and civil lawsuits against dissidents.\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
