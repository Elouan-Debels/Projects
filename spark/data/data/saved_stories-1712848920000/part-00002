Truong My Lan\nwas convicted of taking out $44bn (\u00a335bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial\nBank. The verdict requires her to return $27bn, a sum prosecutors said may\nnever be recovered. Some believe the death penalty is the court's way of\nputting pressure on her to help locate the missing billions.\n\nThe habitually secretive communist authorities were uncharacteristically\nforthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They said\n2,700 people were summoned to testify, while 10 state prosecutors and around\n200 lawyers were involved.\n\nThe evidence was in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five\ndefendants were tried with Truong My Lan, who denied the charges.\n\n\"There has never been a show trial like this, I think, in the communist era,\"\nsays David Brown, a retired US state department official with long experience\nin Vietnam. \"There has certainly been nothing on this scale.\"\n\nThe trial was the most dramatic chapter so far in the \"Blazing Furnaces\" anti-\ncorruption campaign led by the Communist Party Secretary-General, Nguyen Phu\nTrong.\n\nA conservative ideologue steeped in Marxist theory, Nguyen Phu Trong believes\nthat popular anger over untamed corruption poses an existential threat to the\nCommunist Party's monopoly on power. He began the campaign in earnest in 2016\nafter out-manoeuvring the then pro-business prime minister to retain the top\njob in the party.\n\nGetty Images\n\nCommunist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong is leading an anti-\ncorruption campaign\n\nThe campaign has seen two presidents and two deputy prime ministers forced to\nresign, and hundreds of officials disciplined or jailed. Now one of the\ncountry's richest women has joined their ranks.\n\nTruong My Lan comes from a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City,\nformerly Saigon. It has long been the commercial engine of the Vietnamese\neconomy, dating well back to its days as the anti-communist capital of South\nVietnam, with a large, ethnic Chinese community.\n\nShe started as a market stall vendor, selling cosmetics with her mother, but\nbegan buying land and property after the Communist Party ushered in a period\nof economic reform, known as Doi Moi, in 1986. By the 1990s, she owned a large\nportfolio of hotels and restaurants.\n\nAlthough Vietnam is best known outside the country for its fast-growing\nmanufacturing sector, as an alternative supply chain to China, most wealthy\nVietnamese made their money developing and speculating in property.\n\nAll land is officially state-owned. Getting access to it often relies on\npersonal relationships with state officials. Corruption escalated as the\neconomy grew, and became endemic.\n\nBy 2011, Truong My Lan was a well-known business figure in Ho Chi Minh City,\nand she was allowed to arrange the merger of three smaller, cash-strapped\nbanks into a larger entity: Saigon Commercial Bank.\n\nVietnamese law prohibits any individual from holding more than 5% of the\nshares in any bank. But prosecutors say that through hundreds of shell\ncompanies and people acting as her proxies, Truong My Lan actually owned more\nthan 90% of Saigon Commercial.\n\nThey accused her of using that power to appoint her own people as managers,\nand then ordering them to approve hundreds of loans to the network of shell\ncompanies she controlled.\n\nThe amounts taken out are staggering. Her loans made up 93% of all the bank's\nlending.\n\n  * Vietnam secret document warns of 'hostile forces'\n  * US denies Cold War with China in historic Vietnam visit\n  * The country where Kissinger left a legacy of death and chaos\n\nAccording to prosecutors, over a period of three years from February 2019, she\nordered her driver to withdraw 108 trillion Vietnamese dong, more than $4bn\n(\u00a32.3bn) in cash from the bank, and store it in her basement.\n\nThat much cash, even if all of it was in Vietnam's largest denomination\nbanknotes, would weigh two tonnes.\n\nShe was also accused of bribing generously to ensure her loans were never\nscrutinised. One of those who was tried used to be a chief inspector at the\ncentral bank, who was accused of accepting a $5m bribe.\n\nThe mass of officially sanctioned publicity about the case channelled public\nanger over corruption against Truong My Lan, whose haggard, unmade-up\nappearance in court was in stark contrast to the glamorous publicity photos\npeople had seen of her in the past.\n\nBut questions are also being asked about why she was able to keep on with the\nalleged fraud for so long.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe trial took place in Ho Chi Minh City, where Saigon Commercial Bank was\nbased\n\n\"I am puzzled,\" says Le Hong Hiep who runs the Vietnam Studies Programme at\nthe ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n\n\"Because it wasn't a secret. It was well known in the market that Truong My\nLan and her Van Thinh Phat group were using SCB as their own piggy bank to\nfund the mass acquisition of real estate in the most prime locations.\n\n\"It was obvious that she had to get the money from somewhere. But then it is\nsuch a common practice. SCB is not the only bank that is used like this. So\nperhaps the government lost sight because there are so many similar cases in\nthe market.\"\n\nDavid Brown believes she was protected by powerful figures who have dominated\nbusiness and politics in Ho Chi Minh City for decades. And he sees a bigger\nfactor in play in the way this trial is being run: a bid to reassert the\nauthority of the Communist Party over the free-wheeling business culture of\nthe south.\n\n\"What Nguyen Phu Trong and his allies in the party are trying to do is to\nregain control of Saigon, or at least stop it from slipping away.\n\n\"Up until 2016 the party in Hanoi pretty much let this Sino-Vietnamese mafia\nrun the place. They would make all the right noises that local communist\nleaders are supposed to make, but at the same time they were milking the city\nfor a substantial cut of the money that was being made down there.\"\n\nAt 79 years old, party chief Nguyen Phu Trong is in shaky health, and will\nalmost certainly have to retire at the next Communist Party Congress in 2026,\nwhen new leaders will be chosen.\n\nHe has been one of the longest-serving and most consequential secretary-\ngenerals, restoring the authority of the party's conservative wing to a level\nnot seen since the reforms of the 1980s. He clearly does not want to risk\npermitting enough openness to undermine the party's hold on political power.\n\nBut he is trapped in a contradiction. Under his leadership the party has set\nan ambitious goal of reaching rich country status by 2045, with a technology\nand knowledge-based economy. This is what is driving the ever-closer\npartnership with the United States.\n\nYet faster growth in Vietnam almost inevitably means more corruption. Fight\ncorruption too much, and you risk extinguishing a lot of economic activity.\nAlready there are complaints that bureaucracy has slowed down, as officials\nshy away from decisions which might implicate them in a corruption case.\n\n\"That's the paradox,\" says Le Hong Hiep. \"Their growth model has been reliant\non corrupt practices for so long. Corruption has been the grease that that\nkept the machinery working. If they stop the grease, things may not work any\nmore.\"\n\n## Vietnam's president out after just year in office\n\n## Why Starbucks cannot crack coffee-loving Vietnam\n\n## Power shift in Vietnam as president quits\n\nVietnam\n\nAsia\n\nRelated\n\n## Home Office ad campaign to deter Vietnamese migrants\n\n25 Mar 2024\n\nUK Politics\n\n## Vietnam's president out after just year in office\n\n21 Mar 2024\n\nAsia\n\n## Three killed in Houthi missile attack on cargo ship\n\n7 Mar 2024\n\nMiddle East\n\nMore\n\n9 mins ago\n\n## India\u2019s Modi urges peace at China border\n\nThe Indian PM made the comments in a rare interview on the eve of general\nelections.\n\n9 mins ago\n\nIndia\n\n12 hrs ago\n\n## The Indian men traumatised by fighting for Russia\n\nTwo men who were duped by agents into joining the war against Ukraine speak\nabout their experiences.\n\n12 hrs ago\n\nIndia\n\n1 day ago\n\n## Counting under way in South Korea's parliamentary elections\n\nThe elections are widely seen as a midterm referendum on President Yoon Suk\nYeol\u2019s administration.\n\n1 day ago\n\nAsia\n\n1 day ago\n\n## BBC splits news operation in India\n\nThe move comes a year after BBC India's offices in Delhi and Mumbai were\nsearched by tax authorities.\n\n1 day ago\n\nEntertainment & Arts\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Is this K-drama?
