As detailed in a new study published in the journal Nature, the\nfluid, or \"metafluid,\" is designed to have programmable compressibility,\noptical behavior, and viscosity. In a first for metafluids, it can even\ntransition between Newtonian and non-Newtonian states.\n\nThe researchers claim that the fluid could have a wide variety of\napplications, especially in robotics \u2014 but more on that later.\n\n\"We are just scratching the surface of what is possible with this new class of\nfluid,\" study co-author Adel Djellouli, a physicist at Harvard's John A.\nPaulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) said in a statement\nabout the work. \"With this one platform, you could do so many different things\nin so many different fields.\"\n\n## Structurally Sound\n\nMetamaterials are artificially engineered materials with rare properties that\nare, in the researchers' words, \"determined by their structure rather than\ncomposition.\"\n\nUnlike other metamaterials, whose building blocks are traditionally \"arranged\nin fixed positions within a lattice structure,\" this latest creation is made\nof tiny rubber-like spheres suspended in an incompressible fluid, in this case\nsilicon oil.\n\nThese spherical capsules are filled with air and, when subjected to enough\npressure, will buckle. Collapsed, the capsules form a lens-like half-sphere.\nLeave them alone, and they retain their normal shape. This radically alters\nthe fluid's properties: for example, the under-pressure half-spheres can allow\nlight to focus and pass through, while the full spheres can block it.\n\n\"Unlike solid metamaterials, metafluids have the unique ability to flow and\nadapt to the shape of their container,\"co-author Katia Bertoldi, William and\nAmi Kuan Danoff Professor of Applied Mechanics at SEAS, said in the statement.\n\"Our goal was to create a metafluid that not only possesses these remarkable\nattributes but also provides a platform for programmable viscosity,\ncompressibility, and optical properties.\"\n\n## Dynamically Fluid\n\nIn a promising demonstration, the researchers used their metamaterial as the\nhydraulic fluid in a robotic gripper. The test was seemingly simple: all the\nrobot had to do was pick up fragile objects like a glass bottle and an egg\nwithout crushing them.\n\nThanks to the metafluid, the robot crushed it \u2014 the test, that is. The fluid\nautomatically responded to different pressures of the various objects without\nextra programming or external control, something that a traditional hydraulic\nfluid like plain old water wouldn't enable the gripper to do.\n\n\"We show that we can use this fluid to endow intelligence into a simple\nrobot,\" Djellouli said.\n\nStill, this is just an early preview of its capabilities. Next up, the\nresearchers want to test the metafluid's acoustic and thermodynamic\nproperties, which are common applications of metamaterials in general.\n\n\"The application space for these scalable, easy-to-produce metafluids is\nhuge,\" Bertoldi said.\n\nMore on hard science: New Paper Claims Dark Matter Doesn't Exist at All\n\nShare This Article\n\nScientists Created a New Organic Material That Generates Electricity When\nStressed\n\n11.11.17, 1:21 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\nScientists Are Creating Materials From DNA\n\n10.13.17, 12:27 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nResearchers Create Soft, Flexible Material That\u2019s 5 Times Stronger Than Steel\n\nUpdated 7.20.17, 3:07 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nThis New \u201cSuper\u201d Carbon Is Tough, Elastic, and Electrically Conductive\n\nUpdated 6.12.17, 2:58 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
