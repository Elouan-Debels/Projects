FPGA tech allows developers to\nreplicate the performance of vintage platforms on a hardware rather than\nsoftware level, offering a level of accuracy and faithfulness which is much\nharder to achieve via \"traditional\" emulation.\n\nWe've seen a flood of systems appear over the past decade which leverage FPGA\nchips, including the Super Nt, Mega Sg, Analogue Pocket and Analogue Duo \u2013 but\nthe one which gets perhaps the most attention from the community is the open-\nsource MiSTer FPGA project, which has been running for quite some time now and\nis able to replicate systems such as the Saturn, PS1 and N64 thanks to the\ntireless efforts of an active and passionate pool of developers.\n\nThe beauty of FPGA 'cores' is that it's often quite easy to port them between\nFPGA-based systems, and we've seen developers such as Jotego release new cores\non both Analogue Pocket and MiSTer at roughly the same time. However, more\nrecently, the community has begun to splinter, with some key developers\nturning their backs on MiSTer.\n\nThis schism has been demonstrated rather dramatically in a recent public spat\nbetween YouTube and FPGA advocate Pixel Cherry Ninja and Pramod Somashekar\n(@pr4m0d), one of the key FPGA developers behind the hugely promising MARS\nFPGA project.\n\nAccording to Somashekar, he has ceased all work on MiSTer FPGA cores due to a\ndisagreement between himself and Pixel Cherry Ninja. Pixel Cherry Ninja, for\nhis part, has acknowledged this and issued an apology, but this appears to\nhave been rejected by Somashekar.\n\n(Since this piece went live, Pixel Cherry Ninja has deleted his apology video\nand removed a tweet which detailed Somashekar's response.)\n\n> Concerning my recent YouTube video and tweets relating to it. I have\n> received a lot of feedback from within the community with a lot of solid\n> advice.\n>\n> One thing that is apparent is that no one is coming out a winner from this\n> and this only does our niche FPGA Gaming community...\u2014 Pixel Cherry Ninja\n> (@PixelCNinja) April 10, 2024\n\nSadly, this kind of episode seems to be common whenever the whole MARS FPGA vs\nMiSTer FPGA situation is mentioned, with supporters of both platforms\nseemingly engaged in the tiresome 'console war' mentality that plagues other\nparts of the industry.\n\nSpearheaded by developer atrac17, MARS is seen by many as the successor to\nMiSTer; the $700 system was due to be released earlier this year but missed\nits expected launch date.\n\nWith key figures in the retro community like Flxel (a talented developer of\n3DO and Dreamcast emulators) and RetroTINK creator Mike Chi, MARS has gained a\nlot of attention \u2013 but not all of it has been positive.\n\nRecently, atrac17 \u2013 who had previously approached Time Extension with the view\nto doing an interview following our coverage of MARS \u2013 has begun blocking\npeople on Twitter seemingly without reason (for example, Time Extension has\nbeen blocked despite the positive coverage we've afforded the system). We also\nassume, at this point, that atrac17 won't be answering the questions he\nrequested we send over in October of last year.\n\nA cursory glance at Twitter shows quite a few negative comments relating to\nthe MARS project, and it seems that the delays to the system's release have\ncaused some to doubt its potential \u2013 but those close to the project are\nadamant that everything is proceeding as planned.\n\n> MARS is proceeding as planned. We will be showing off hardware and games at\n> TooManyGames in June and maybe do some live streaming stuff before then. And\n> lots more info from now until then.\n>\n> Basically PixelCherryNinja doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about. Like\n> usual.\u2014 Todd Gill - Retro Frog (@ToddsNerdCave) March 9, 2024\n\nFor the record, here at Time Extension we're very excited about MARS \u2013 any\nFPGA-powered system which has more advanced hardware inside is naturally going\nto be of interest to anyone who's keen on retro gaming and game preservation\nin general. As more potent hardware appears, there's the opportunity to\npreserve more systems for future generations to enjoy; after all, many retro\nconsoles are operating well beyond their intended lifespans, so accurate\nreplication via FPGA is likely to be the best way to experience consoles like\nthe PS1, 3DO and Dreamcast in the decades to come.\n\nIt's just a shame that the launch of MARS comes at a time when the FPGA\ndevelopment community appears to be splintering rather than unifying; a\ncombined community would massively benefit owners of MiSTer, Analogue Pocket\nand (when it eventually arrives) MARS \u2013 and would lay down solid foundations\nfor future FPGA-based systems.\n\nWe've contacted the individuals mentioned in this piece and given them a\nchance to tell their side of the story directly; we will update it if and when\nwe hear back.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're invested in the world of FPGA retro gaming, let us\nknow what impact all of this has on you personally \u2013 will you shift your\nallegiance to another system if MiSTer starts getting frozen out? Are you\nexcited about MARS or sceptical?

Who knows why. I think people are right to\nwalk away if something is making them unhappy - so credit for that. All the\nfighting and bickering explains a lot with regards to the quality of many of\nthese projects too. I'm solely a consumer, so who cares what I think, but the\nstate of many of the cores leaves a lot to be desired. No doubt there's\nimmense talent on display, but communication and people skills are clearly\nlacking. They need someone to manage them all!\n\n(No thanks!!)\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 2\n  * BLAZINOAH\n  * 12:33pm\n\nVery sad news. We can only hope that the passage of time will sufficiently\nheal these wounds. I will give credit to Pixel Cherry Ninja for his attempt to\nset things right, but I respect Pramod Somashekar's work and his decision to\nwalk away.\n\nWhatever Pixel Cherry Ninja may have done, I hope he won't be bullied and\ncancelled by the rest of community because of this episode. Besides, I doubt\nit would bring Somashekar back into the fold anyway.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 3\n  * Ryu_Niiyama\n  * 12:38pm\n\nThis is why I stick with analogue. They are slow to make product and expensive\nbut they function correctly as a business. Usually when you get a bunch of\npeople freelancing there is no real project management and products go to heck\nmore readily. Sometimes a standard business model us what stands between\nproduct with support and vaporware.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 4\n  * Azuris\n  * 1:26pm\n\nWere people are, is Drama. The Mister is a real Dream Machine, i would have\nnever thought that we'll see PSX and mostly the N64 on it, i even got my\noriginal Save Games to run on it\n\nSo Kudos to all the People that worked on it with all the different Systems\nand Cores.\n\nI guess they did need a Shield and Spokesman, that catches all the bad Stuff\nthat can appear from People.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 5\n  * ganonms\n  * 1:37pm\n\n@atrac17 you're posting that info on Twitter... Nothing bad has been said\nhere.\n\n  * 5\n  * Reply\n\n  * 6\n  * ganonms\n  * 1:38pm\n\nIt's a shame this is happening, I don't think there is a right or wrong side,\njust your usual internet drama instead of people uniting for what they love,\nretro games and preservation.\n\n  * 4\n  * Reply\n\n  * 7\n  * Damo\n  * 1:48pm\n\n@atrac17 Apologies, the information was included here because it offers a\nvalid and understandable explanation as to why the MARS project was delayed.\nThere was no intention to offend, and I'm happy to remove that portion of text\nfrom this piece.\n\nHaving said that, I hope it's obvious from the amount of coverage we've given\nMARS (and your FPGA cores) on this site that we're not the \"enemy\"; blocking\nus on Twitter simply means we won't have the chance to report on the good work\nyou're doing, which seems a shame to me.\n\n  * 6\n  * Reply\n\n  * 8\n  * ganonms\n  * 1:51pm\n\n@atrac17 taking what has been said in other related conversations somewhere\nelse, you should have approached this privately, I'm sure time extension are\nvery reasonable and update it if that's your wish.\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 9\n  * Damo\n  * 2:08pm\n\n@atrac17 Apologies if this article or any of the others we've posted has led\nto unwelcome or unpleasant behaviour being directed to yourself on social\nmedia; the intention has always been to provide some context to delays\nrelating to MARS.\n\nLaunching a piece of hardware is something I don't think I'd ever have the\nskill, talent or patience to do myself, so I'm very sensitive to people\njumping to conclusions when they don't know all of the facts - that was the\nsole reason for including personal information (which I wouldn't have included\nhad it not been posted to a public social media platform).\n\nI realise TE isn't blocked by the MARS account but by blocking it from your\npersonal account I won't see stuff related to the other FPGA projects you're\nworking on - for example, the WWF core wouldn't have gotten a news story the\nother day (I assume you blocked the account recently).\n\nI've been on the end of social media hate many times myself and can fully\nappreciate how difficult it is, but I can assure you TE's intention has never\nbeen to create such issues; we're here to report on exciting developments in\nthe world of retro gaming, which MARS / your FPGA work certainly counts as.\n\n  * 4\n  * Reply\n\n  * 10\n  * mariteaux\n  * 2:49pm\n\nRemember when video games were fun?\n\nAlso, if you post it publicly, it's public knowledge and fair game. Long and\nshort of it. Hop off Twitter if you don't like that.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 11\n  * Bod2019\n  * 3:24pm\n\nCan anyone clarify why there is so much drama around MARS, is it simply a\ncompetitive thing, or are there other reasons for such animosity?\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 12\n  * Gamemoose\n  * 3:30pm\n\nDang, it's hard to provide positive journalism when something posted publicly\non social media (which could be found if a person searched on a search engine)\nis then considered verboten if it's mentioned elsewhere.\n\nThis is why, other than forums, I don't do mainstream social media. Plus, if\nit's personal, I don't include it online for the world to see. We have issues,\nthings come up but beyond saying \"there be personal issues\", we don't need to\njustify. We're pressured to justify our actions, no matter how minute, but we\nhave to remember we don't have to say diddly squat.\n\nAs Mom used to say \"are you writing a book? Well, leave me out of that\nchapter\".\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 13\n  * 3d0\n  * 3:30pm\n\nFixel isn't free from controvery either, the 3DO community discord is full of\nunhappy customers due to him being uncommunicative and repeatedly claiming\nproducts will ship \"next week\" or even \"today\" but then nothing happens and\nradio silence for months at a time. Some have been waiting since 2022 without\nmuch of an explanation or apologies.\n\n:Edit: I see Atract17 deleted his responses to the article, so now you can\nonly see the authors responses to him. He wasn't happy with them putting\ninformation from his twitter account in the article after he blocked them.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 14\n  * SandyRegion\n  * 3:42pm\n\nSeems the Mars developers are blaming PCN for getting heat from Twitter users,\nbut twitter is built on a toxic algorithm, and everyone gets criticized on\nthere. I think it's foolish to block accounts like this site and PCN, when you\ncan actually work with them to create positive buzz and promote your product\nwith them. I fear the Mars team have engineered this drama by being too\nsensitive and unwilling to communicate.\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 15\n  * MARl0\n  * 3:49pm\n\nAll I'll say is that I love all FPGA platforms, and that I love the work\neveryone is doing on them to preserve classic games and hardware. Love it!\n\nI also just worked directly with srg320 to get Shining Force III working\nproperly on the MiSTer Saturn core, and he was an absolute pleasure to work\nwith. Amazing job by him and everyone else in the community who help make\nthese platforms what they are.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 16\n  * Gamemoose\n  * 3:51pm\n\n@3d0: I'm not up on the MARS- was there money exchanged already for the system\nor is this system being promised to be released with no funds from potential\ncustomers?\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 17\n  * BradleyCresva\n  * 3:57pm\n\n@Bod2019 The founder of MARS has a known track record against the maintainer\nof MiSTer. He rallied up a couple of people who are in the camp of \"MiSTer is\ndoing everything wrong\" and attempting to hijack the community.\n\nAfter the announcement of MARS, there were coordinated attacks against certain\nsellers and companies that the MiSTer community supported which certain MARS\nmembers had previous spats with.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 18\n  * PaulDriver\n  * 4:01pm\n\nAs MiniMig begat Mist which begat Mister so MistEx will take over, allowing\nseveral families of FPGA to run the cores, at a lower cost, and hopefully,\neventually, better performance.\n\nThis is the way.\n\nhttps://github.com/MiSTeX-devel\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 19\n  * 3d0\n  * 49m ago\n\n@Gamemoose The situation with Fixel isn't MARS, it's his own projects such as\nOptical Drive Emulators (ODE) for consoles and PCs. These have been paid for\nby customers, in some cases years ago, but haven't shipped and some haven't\neven received tracking info. For some he won't respond to DMs or emails which\nmakes the situation even worse.\n\nSome are acussing him of lying about progress and, while he has denied this,\nhe hasn't put forward any real proof that things are moving along yet. Earlier\nthis year Fixel was caught in a lie about shipping products to Stone Age\nGamer, when a customer contacted SAG they confirmed they had not received\nanything and after that Fixel changed his story.\n\nBatch 2 of the IDE EMU still says it is a pre-order shipping November 2023\nwhich went up for sale before batch 1 has shipped and neither batch has\nshipped! Still available to purchase: https://3do.dev/products/copy-of-ide-\nemulator-batch2\n\nHe's working for MARS now, even though his own projects are massively lagging\nbehind schedule, that's why I brought it up.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 20\n  * BradleyCresva\n  * 40m ago\n\n@3d0 The irony is that MARS pride themselves of saying it like it is and not\ntaking people's money, but completely shuts down or ignores comments when the\npeople in their circle commit the same.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\nTap here to load 20 comments\n\nLeave A Comment\n\nHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * 33 Years Later, Game Boy Title's 16-Player Mode Is Finally Unlocked\n\nFaceball 2000, the way it was meant to be played\n\n  * Modder Transforms Rare PS1 Controller Into Working PS1 Console\n\nTakara's Roulette controller was exclusive to Japan\n\n  * Fallout And Twin Peaks Star Kyle MacLachlan Stayed Up Late To Finish Mega Man\n\n\"We got all the way through to the end of that\"\n\n  * The NES Slotmaster Is An Open-Source Replacement For The 72-Pin Cartridge Slot\n\nAn open-source solution that is both affordable & easy to build\n\n  * Double Dragon Studio Wanted To Make A New 2D Golden Axe\n\nBut now Sega's making a 3D one\n\nPopular Right Now\n\n  * All Is Not Well In The World Of FPGA Retro Gaming\n\n12pm\n\n  * 33 Years Later, Game Boy Title's 16-Player Mode Is Finally Unlocked\n\nMon, 10:05am\n\n  * Guide: The Best Retro Gaming Gifts - April 2024\n\nMon, 1pm\n\n  * Random: Gamers Are Using 3DSen To Play NES Games In Mixed Reality\n\nYesterday, 10:45am\n\n  * Sealed NES Castlevania Sold For $90,000 Because It Was \"The First Game My Mom Ever Bought Me\"\n\nYesterday, 10:15am\n\n  * The Reason Sega Lost The 32-Bit War?
