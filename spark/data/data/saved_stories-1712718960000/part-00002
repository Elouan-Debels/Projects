But first,\nlet me show you what happened.\n\nJust before the eclipse there were a lot of low clouds over the totality path\nin northeastern Texas (see blue oval area below)\n\nBut during and right after the eclipse, many of the clouds were gone (see\nbelow)\n\nDivine intervention? The influence of the prayers of the astronomically\ndevoted?\n\nNo, it was the result of the weakening solar radiation that caused the surface\nto cool. Many of these clouds were shallow convection/cumulus, driven by solar\nheating (see figure below). When the sun weakened, so did the clouds.\n\nNot surprisingly, surface air temperatures cooled during the eclipse by as\nmuch as 5-10F at some locations. To illustrate, here are the temperatures in\nJoplin, Missouri, where temperatures went from around 80F to 73F between 12:30\nPM and 2 PM, before recovering during the next hour as the sun returned.\n\nAnd then there was the wind. At many locations, there was a dramatic reduction\nin the wind speed during the eclipse. Here are the temperatures and winds at\nanother Missouri location (Folly Ridge). Significant wind reduction during\ntotality (from roughly 10 to 3 mph).\n\nThis can be explained by a reduction in vertical mixing in the lower\natmosphere.\n\nHave you ever noticed that during the warm season, winds are greater during\nthe afternoon and weaker at night? During the day, solar heating at the\nsurface causes vertical mixing, that brings strong winds aloft (not slowed\ndown by the rough surface) down to the surface. When the sun weakens, the\nmixing weakens, which reduces the flow of stronger winds to the surface.\n\nFinally, there is another change I am not quite sure I can explain-- so maybe\nI better be careful about downplaying divine intervention.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Changes in the weather radar imagery.\n\nConsider the radar image from Dallas, Fort Worth, early in the morning (1406\nUTC or 9 AM Dallas time). Not many radar echoes.\n\nThree and a half hours late (12:34 PM), there were lots of weak radar echoes.\n\nBut an hour later, near the height of the eclipse, there were few\nechoes...just like night.\n\nAnd then an hour later when the sun returned, the echoes were back.\n\nWhat is going on here? What are these echoes? Birds or bugs that like to fly\nduring the day? I will have to dig into this deeper.\n\nIn summary, by greatly changing the heating profile in the lower atmosphere,\nthe eclipse had some profound, but temporary effects on many weather\nparameters.\n\nPosted by\n\nCliff Mass Weather Blog at\n\nApril 09, 2024\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n#### 5 comments:\n\n  1.

I'm going with answered prayers as the explanation.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\n    1.

Several\nhouses away, a similar gathering included fireworks and cheering. A good time\n- I suppose - repeated along the entire path of totality. Here in central WA,\nI didn't notice anything.

I can see how a car engine works and what cause and effect of the\nenvironment are on its running, that doesn't explain how the engine was\nmanufactured and made to be a running machine.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\n  4.
