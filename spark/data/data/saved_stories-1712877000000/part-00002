She described running errands with her\nhusband the morning of April 9.\n\nWhile the couple were stopped along Bush and Montgomery, they thought the\nyellow Specialty Towing truck was moving toward a nearby Waymo autonomous\nvehicle. But soon, it was getting too close for comfort.\n\n\"He came from the side. I thought he was turning right. He started in reverse\nand all the lights came on. That's when we were like, hey something's really\nwrong. His lever was coming down.\"\n\nYou can see in the video taken by a witness, the tow truck makes several\nattempts to hook onto their 2017 Toyota Corolla.\n\nA witness can be heard on video screaming \"What the f**k are you doing!\"\n\nWhen the light turns green, the Waymo next to Joanne and her husband drives\noff. The couple then realize they're stuck in front of a black sedan.\n\n\"We were freaking out. The first instinct was to get away,\" says Joanne.\n\nFortunately, the black car backs up, and Joanne's husband is able to drive\naway. You can see the tow truck giving a chase. Joanne says the truck chased\nthem for several blocks.\n\n\"It's definitely really scary,\" says Joanne, who looks back at the incident\nand wonders what would have happened if the tow truck was successful in\nhooking onto their car.\n\nMORE: New San Francisco program will text you if your car is about to be towed\n\nABC7 reached out to Special Towing via email and phone but did not hear back.\n\nThe company along with two others were charged by City Attorney David Chiu in\nFeb. for fraud and illegally towing parked cars. His office described the\ncompany as \"unscrupulous\" in their online news release. Specialty Towing is\nnow prohibited from bidding or receiving city contracts.\n\nJoanne and her husband tell me they were eventually able to lose the tow truck\nand drove back home to the East Bay. They maintain they didn't do anything\nwrong and are still perplexed as to why they were targeted.\n\n\"Full disclaimer, I definitely paid off my car, I paid my registration,\" she\nsays.\n\nJoanne is planning to file a police report soon and is sharing their story to\nraise awareness for other drivers.\n\n\"Be more careful when they're driving around and making sure if something\ndoesn't look right, make sure you do your best to protect yourself,\" she\nshares.\n\nIf you're on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live\n\nReport a correction or typo\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KGO-TV.
