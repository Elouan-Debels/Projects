Our goal is to make you more efficient\nwhen looking through your projects by providing tools designed to spotlight\nissues that need attention.\n\nWe've been busy adding ways to filter dependencies by alert severity among\nother things - a requirement for long lists of dependencies. However, even\nwith all of these filtering tools, to get a sense of a project's state you\nmust dig through potentially many pages of dependencies. With that in mind,\nwe've been thinking about how to concisely display the overall state of a\nproject. Some projects have a ton of dependencies - if you've ever worked on\nor seen a modern web front-end codebase, you know what we're talking about.\n\nWe decided to focus on a visualization for the SBOM report page \u2014 a grid of\npackages, displayed as boxes, where the box height and color represent their\nlevel of risk. For example, we want packages with critical alerts to stick out\nlike a sore thumb. Although you can figure out the state of a project manually\nby clicking through the alerts, this visualization gives you a quick\nimpression without getting lost in the details.\n\nThis grid of boxes is a set of all the unique dependencies in your project\nwith heights correlating to risk. Dependencies with critical alerts are\nrepresented in the brightest color and packages without problems fade into the\nbackground (light gray).\n\nOf course dependencies can still be filtered in the Alerts and Dependencies\ntabs and the 3D view will be updated to match.\n\nWhile on the Alerts tab, clicking on individual boxes in the 3D view will open\nthe associated alert details. Other packages with the same alert will also be\nselected.\n\nTo disable the visualization, you can use the X on the left. This will replace\nit with a button that can be used to enable it again.\n\nWe're excited to see how this visualization helps you efficiently identify and\nresolve problems within your projects, so you can get back to confidently\nbuilding the technology of tomorrow.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nGet notified when we publish new security blog posts!\n\n## Related posts\n\nBack to all posts\n\nSecurity News\n\n### Double Whammy: Change Healthcare Targeted Again by RansomHub Following\nALPHV's Exit Scam\n\nRansomHub claims to have over 4TB of sensitive data from the Change Healthcare\nransomware attack.
