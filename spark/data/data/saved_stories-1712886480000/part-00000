The cause: a supply chain\nsnafu involving an open source software package and hardware from multiple\nmanufacturers that directly or indirectly incorporated it into their products.\n\nResearchers from security firm Binarly have confirmed that the lapse has\nresulted in Intel, Lenovo, and Supermicro shipping server hardware that\ncontains a vulnerability that can be exploited to reveal security-critical\ninformation. The researchers, however, went on to warn that any hardware that\nincorporates certain generations of baseboard management controllers made by\nDuluth, Georgia-based AMI or Taiwan-based AETN are also affected.\n\n## Chain of fools\n\nBMCs are tiny computers soldered into the motherboard of servers that allow\ncloud centers, and sometimes their customers, to streamline the remote\nmanagement of vast fleets of servers. They enable administrators to remotely\nreinstall OSes, install and uninstall apps, and control just about every other\naspect of the system\u2014even when it's turned off. BMCs provide what\u2019s known in\nthe industry as \u201clights-out\u201d system management. AMI and AETN are two of\nseveral makers of BMCs.\n\nFor years, BMCs from multiple manufacturers have incorporated vulnerable\nversions of open source software known as lighttpd. Lighttpd is a fast,\nlightweight web server that\u2019s compatible with various hardware and software\nplatforms. It\u2019s used in all kinds of wares, including in embedded devices like\nBMCs, to allow remote administrators to control servers remotely with HTTP\nrequests.\n\nIn 2018, lighttpd developers released a new version that fixed \u201cvarious use-\nafter-free scenarios,\u201d a vague reference to a class of vulnerability that can\nbe remotely exploitable to tamper with security-sensitive memory functions of\nthe affected software. Despite the description, the update didn\u2019t use the word\n\u201cvulnerability\u201d and didn\u2019t include a CVE vulnerability tracking number as is\ncustomary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBMC makers including AMI and ATEN were using affected versions of lighttpd\nwhen the vulnerability was fixed and continued doing so for years, Binarly\nresearchers said. Server manufacturers, in turn, continued putting the\nvulnerable BMCs into their hardware over the same multi-year time period.\nBinarly has identified three of those server makers as Intel, Lenovo, and\nSupermicro. Intel hardware sold by Intel as recently as last year is affected.\nBinarly said that both Intel and Lenovo have no plans to release fixes because\nthey no longer support the affected hardware. Affected products from\nSupermicro are still supported.\n\n\u201cAll these years, [the lighttpd vulnerability] was present inside the firmware\nand nobody cared to update one of the third-party components used to build\nthis firmware image,\u201d Binarly researchers wrote Thursday. \u201cThis is another\nperfect example of inconsistencies in the firmware supply chain. A very\noutdated third-party component present in the latest version of firmware,\ncreating additional risk for end users. Are there more systems that use the\nvulnerable version of lighttpd across the industry?\u201d\n\n## Defeating ASLR\n\nThe vulnerability makes it possible for hackers to identify memory addresses\nresponsible for handling key functions. Operating systems take pains to\nrandomize and conceal these locations so they can\u2019t be used in software\nexploits. By chaining an exploit for the lighttpd vulnerability with a\nseparate vulnerability, hackers could defeat this standard protection, which\nis known as address space layout randomization. The chaining of two or more\nexploits has become a common feature of hacking attacks these days as software\nmakers continue to add anti-exploitation protections to their code.\n\nTracking the supply chain for multiple BMCs used in multiple server hardware\nis difficult. So far, Binarly has identified AMI\u2019s MegaRAC BMC as one of the\nvulnerable BMCs. The security firm has confirmed that the AMI BMC is contained\nin the Intel Server System M70KLP hardware. Information about BMCs from ATEN\nor hardware from Lenovo and Supermicro aren\u2019t available at the moment. The\nvulnerability is present in any hardware that uses lighttpd versions 1.4.35,\n1.4.45, and 1.4.51.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttempts to immediately reach lighttpd developers and most of the makers of\naffected hardware weren\u2019t immediately successful. An AMI representative\ndeclined to comment on the vulnerability but added the standard statements\nabout security being an important priority.\n\nThe lighttpd flaw is what\u2019s known as a heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability\nthat's caused by bugs in HTTP request parsing logic. Hackers can exploit it\nusing maliciously designed HTTP requests.\n\n\u201cA potential attacker can exploit this vulnerability in order to read memory\nof Lighttpd Web Server process,\u201d Binarly researchers wrote in an advisory.\n\u201cThis may lead to sensitive data exfiltration, such as memory addresses, which\ncan be used to bypass security mechanisms such as ASLR.\u201d Advisories are\navailable here, here, and here.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nJust about every Windows and Linux device vulnerable to new LogoFAIL firmware\nattack\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first major supply chain gaff to be unearthed by Binarly. In\nDecember, the firm disclosed LogoFail, an attack that executes malicious\nfirmware early in the boot-up sequence as a result of outdated firmware used\nin virtually all Unified Extensible Firmware Interfaces, which are responsible\nfor booting modern devices that run Windows or Linux.\n\nPeople or organizations using Supermicro gear should check with the\nmanufacturer to find information on possible fixes. With no fixes available\nfrom Intel or Lenovo, there\u2019s not much users of these affected hardware can\ndo. It\u2019s worth mentioning explicitly, however, that the severity of the\nlighttpd vulnerability is only moderate and is of no value unless an attacker\nhas a working exploit for a much more severe vulnerability. In general, BMCs\nshould be enabled only when needed and locked down carefully, as they allow\nfor extraordinary control of entire fleets of servers with simple HTTP\nrequests sent over the Internet.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n11\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
