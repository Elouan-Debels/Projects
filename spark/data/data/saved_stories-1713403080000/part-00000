The technology could expand worldwide screening\nand treatment for the condition. (Getty Images)\n\nAn artificial intelligence technology can accurately and independently detect\n100% of severe cases of a blindness-causing condition that affects prematurely\nborn babies, according to new research from Oregon Health & Science University\nand collaborators, published today in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nThe technology has the potential to expand worldwide screening \u2014 and\nultimately sight-saving treatment \u2014 for retinopathy of prematurity, or ROP,\nthe condition that caused musician Stevie Wonder to go blind.\n\nROP causes abnormal blood vessel growth near the retina, which is light-\nsensitive tissue at the back of the eye. About 2 million babies annually are\nborn early enough to develop ROP, although in most cases the disease is mild\nand resolves without treatment. Severe cases cause about 500 babies in the\nUnited States, and about 50,000 babies globally, to go blind every year. More\ncases go untreated in low- and middle-income countries, where there are fewer\nophthalmologists to examine and treat preemies.\n\nPeter Campbell, M.D., M.P.H. (OHSU)\n\n\u201cROP is the leading cause of blindness in children in the U.S. and around the\nworld, and perhaps the most solvable problem among many in global efforts to\nreduce preventable blindness,\u201d said the study\u2019s corresponding author, J. Peter\nCampbell, M.D., M.P.H., an associate professor of ophthalmology in the OHSU\nSchool of Medicine and the OHSU Casey Eye Institute. \u201cAlthough we cannot fully\nprevent ROP, we can almost always prevent blindness from ROP.\n\n\u201cWhile there are doctors who are skilled in ROP treatment in many parts of the\nworld, there simply aren\u2019t enough to screen all of the babies who are at\nrisk,\u201d Campbell continued. \u201cThis paper demonstrates that AI can effectively\nreplace the physician for bedside screening and refer the most urgent cases to\na physician for treatment.\u201d\n\n## Tech to expand care\n\nMichael Chiang, M.D. (OHSU)\n\nWhen he was still at OHSU, Michael Chiang, M.D., now director of the National\nEye Institute of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues first\ndeveloped the i-ROP Deep Learning system, which uses an AI algorithm to\nidentify blood vessel anomalies in retinal images. Currently, specially\ntrained ophthalmologists must manually review these images to diagnose ROP.\n\nThe team\u2019s earlier research showed that their AI technology could accurately\ndiagnose ROP and can also be effectively used remotely through telemedicine\nappointments instead of traditional, in-person eye exams.\n\nThis new study marks the first time that autonomous AI screening for ROP has\nbeen shown to work in a real-world population \u2014 meaning the technology\ncorrectly flags the condition on its own, without ophthalmologist support and\nwithout preselecting images to improve data quality. While many AI algorithms\nwork in controlled experiments, they often fail to work in the real world due\nto differences between training data and real-world use.\n\nFor this study, the AI system analyzed nearly 12,000 images of more than 4,000\nbabies\u2019 retinas. The photos were taken by nurses at neonatal intensive care\nunits in U.S. and Indian hospitals. Ophthalmologists had previously reviewed\nthe images as part of telemedicine programs in both countries and found that\nabout 1.2% of the babies had severe forms of ROP, while about 5.8% had more-\nthan-mild cases. The AI system correctly identified all of the severe cases\nand accurately detected 80% of the cases with more-than-mild ROP.\n\nThe i-ROP Deep Learning system was initially developed by researchers from\nOHSU, Massachusetts General Hospital, Northeastern University, University of\nIllinois Chicago and the Imaging & Informatics in ROP, or i-ROP, consortium.\nIn 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted the technology breakthrough\nstatus to accelerate its development.\n\nIn addition to his role at OHSU, Campbell is also chief executive officer of\nSiloam Vision, which licensed the technology and is currently leading clinical\ntrials to evaluate the AI system\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Siloam Vision has\nalso partnered with the nonprofit Orbis International to implement the\ntechnology in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIf the technology is ultimately approved by regulatory agencies, ROP would\nbecome the second eye disease that can be independently detected by AI.\nDiabetic retinopathy \u2014 which affects people with diabetes and is the leading\ncause of blindness in working age adults \u2014 can already be detected with three\nautonomous AI devices that are approved for use in the U.S.\n\nThis research was supported by the National Eye Institute of the National\nInstitutes of Health (grants R01 EY019474, R01 EY031331, R21 EY031883, P30\nEY010572), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Of Child Health &\nHuman Development of the National Institutes of Health (grant R01 HD107494),\nResearch to Prevent Blindness (Career Development Award), Malcolm Marquis\nInnovation Fund, U.S. Agency for International Development, Seva Foundation\nand the National Eye Institute\u2019s intramural research program.\n\nIn the interest of ensuring the integrity of our research and as part of our\ncommitment to public transparency, OHSU actively regulates, tracks and manages\nrelationships that our researchers may hold with entities outside of OHSU. The\ntechnology has been licensed for commercial development, which may result in\nroyalties to J. Peter Campbell, M.D., M.P.H., and Oregon Health & Science\nUniversity.

Shown here are two such images: one of a normal eye (left) and another\nof an eye with twisted and dilated retinal vessels, which indicates ROP. OHSU\nand Massachusetts General Hospital have developed an artificial intelligence-\nbased algorithm that more accurately diagnosed ROP in images such as these\nthan most of the eight expert physicians involved in the study.
