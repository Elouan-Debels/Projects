Following those lines, this morning Intel and Sandia National\nLaboratories are celebrating the deployment of the Hala Point neuromorphic\nsystem, which the two believe is the highest capacity system in the world.\nWith 1.15 billion neurons overall, Hala Point is the largest deployment yet\nfor Intel\u2019s Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip, which was first announced at the tail-\nend of 2021.\n\nThe Hala Point system incorporates 1152 Loihi 2 processors, each of which is\ncapable of simulating a million neurons. As noted back at the time of Loihi\n2\u2019s launch, these chips are actually rather small \u2013 just 31 mm^2 per chip with\n2.3 billion transistors each, as they\u2019re built on the Intel 4 process (one of\nthe only other Intel chips to do so, besides Meteor Lake). As a result, the\ncomplete system is similarly petite, taking up just 6 rack units of space (or\nas Sandia likes to compare it to, about the size of a microwave), with a power\nconsumption of 2.6 kW. Now that it\u2019s online, Hala Point has dethroned the\nSpiNNaker system as the largest disclosed neuromorphic system, offering\nadmittedly just a slightly larger number of neurons at less than 3% of the 100\nkW British system.\n\nA Single Loihi 2 Chip (31 mm^2)\n\nHala Point will be replacing an older Intel neuromorphic system at Sandia,\nPohoiki Springs, which is based on Intel\u2019s first-generation Loihi chips. By\ncomparison, Hala Point offers ten-times as many neurons, and upwards of 12x\nthe performance overall,\n\nBoth neuromorphic systems have been procured by Sandia in order to advance the\nnational lab\u2019s research into neuromorphic computing, a computing paradigm that\nbehaves like a brain. The central thought (if you\u2019ll excuse the pun) is that\nby mimicking the wetware writing this article, neuromorphic chips can be used\nto solve problems that conventional processors cannot solve today, and that\nthey can do so more efficiently as well.\n\nSandia, for its part, has said that it will be using the system to look at\nlarge-scale neuromorphic computing, with work operating on a scale well beyond\nPohoiki Springs. With Hala Point offering a simulated neuron count very\nroughly on the level of complexity of an owl brain, the lab believes that a\nlarger-scale system will finally enable them to properly exploit the\nproperties of neuromorphic computing to solve real problems in fields such as\ndevice physics, computer architecture, computer science and informatics,\nmoving well beyond the simple demonstrations initially achieved at a smaller\nscale.\n\nOne new focus from the lab, which in turn has caught Intel\u2019s attention, is the\napplicability of neuromorphic computing towards AI inference. Because the\nneural networks themselves behind the current wave of AI systems are\nattempting to emulate the human brain, in a sense, there is an obvious degree\nof synergy with the brain-mimicking neuromorphic chips, even if the algorithms\ndiffer in some key respects. Still, with energy efficiency being one of the\nmajor benefits of neuromorphic computing, it\u2019s pushed Intel to look into the\nmatter further \u2013 and even build a second, Hala Point-sized system of their\nown.\n\nAccording to Intel, in their research on Hala Point, the system has reached\nefficiencies as high as 15 TOPS-per-Watt at 8-bit precision, albeit while\nusing 10:1 sparsity, making it more than competitive with current-generation\ncommercial chips. As an added bonus to that efficiency, the neuromorphic\nsystems don\u2019t require extensive data processing and batching in advance, which\nis normally necessary to make efficient use of the high density ALU arrays in\nGPUs and GPU-like processors.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting use case of all, however, is the potential for\nbeing able to use neuromorphic computing to enable augmenting neural networks\nwith additional data on the fly. The idea behind this being to avoid re-\ntraining, as current LLMs require, which is extremely costly due to the\nextensive computing resources required. In essence, this is taking another\npage from how brains operate, allowing for continuous learning and dataset\naugmentation.\n\nBut for the moment, at least, this remains a subject of academic study.\nEventually, Intel and Sandia want systems like Hala Point to lead to the\ndevelopment of commercial systems \u2013 and presumably, at even larger scales. But\nto get there, researchers at Sandia and elsewhere will first need to use the\ncurrent crop of systems to better refine their algorithms, as well as better\nfigure out how to map larger workloads to this style of computing in order to\nprove their utility at larger scales.CP\n\nGallery: Intel and Sandia National Laboratories Roll Out \u201cHala Point\u201d\nNeuromorphic Research System\n\nSource: Intel, Sandia National Laboratories\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 2 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n  * #### GeoffreyA - Wednesday, April 17, 2024 - link\n\nIf I understand correctly, neuromorphic chips are hardware, and normal neural\nnetworks are software, so to speak. In the brain, hardware and software are\ntied together, or are one and the same, similar to early computers' code being\nthe physical wiring. To enable \"rewiring\" in neuromorphic chips, arguably\nwhat's needed is the biological approach, with some sort of biological\ntransistor and neuron. Then, the neural networks could be tied to them more\nclosely; indeed, becoming them.
