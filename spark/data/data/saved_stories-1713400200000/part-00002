This is a tutorial for Jujutsu\u2014a version control system.\n\nThis tutorial exists because of a particular quirk of mine: I love to write\ntutorials about things as I learn them. This is the backstory of TRPL, of\nwhich an ancient draft was \"Rust for Rubyists.\" You only get to look at a\nproblem as a beginner once, and so I think writing this stuff down is\ninteresting. It also helps me clarify what I'm learning to myself.\n\nAnyway, I have been interested in version control for a long time. I feel like\nI am the only person alive who doesn't mind git's CLI. That's weird. I also\nheard friends rave about \"stacked diffs\" but struggled to understand what\nexactly was going on there. Nothing I read or conversations I had have\nclicked.\n\nOne time I was talking with Rain about this and she mentioned jj being very\ncool. I looked at it but I didn't get it. I decided to maybe just come back to\nthis topic later. A very common thing people have when learning Rust is,\nthey'll try it, quit in frustration, and then come back months later and it's\neasy and they don't know what they were struggling with. Of course, some\npeople never try again, and some who try don't get over the hump, but this\nused to happen quite often, enough to be remarkable. So that's what I decided\nwith jj. I'd figure this stuff out later.\n\nWell, recently Chris Krycho wrote an article about jj. I liked it. I didn't\nfully grok everything, but it at least felt like I could understand this thing\nfinally maybe. I didn't install it, but just sat with it for a while.\n\nI don't know if that is why, but I awoke unusually early one morning. I\ncouldn't get back to sleep. Okay. Fine. Let's do this. I opened up the\nofficial jj tutorial, installed jj, made this repository on GitHub, followed\nthe \"cloning a git repo\" instructions to pull it down, and started this\nmdBook.\n\nWhat follows is exactly what the title says: it's to teach me jj. I am\npublishing this just in case someone might find it interesting. I am very\nexcited about jj. I feel like I'm getting it. Maybe your brain will work like\nmine, and this will be useful to you. But also, it may not. I make no claim\nthat this tutorial is good, complete, or even accurate.\n\nYou can find the source for this content here. Feel free to open issues or\neven send me pull requests for typos and such. Zero guarantees I will respond\nin a timely fashion though.\n\nAnyway, let's get on with it.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
