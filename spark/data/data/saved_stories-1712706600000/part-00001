Nuclear energy\u2019s\nproponents, however, counter that nuclear power has historically been among\nthe safest forms of power generation, and that the consistent carbon-free\nenergy it generates makes it an essential tool in the fight against global\nwarming.\n\nBut this well-worn debate may not actually be the one that determines the\nfuture of nuclear energy in the United States. More decisive is the unresolved\nquestion of whether the U.S. actually has the practical ability to build new\nnuclear plants at all.\n\nThe answer to this question may hinge on what happens in the wake of a\nconstruction project that\u2019s reaching completion near Waynesboro, Georgia,\nwhere the second in a pair of new nuclear reactors is scheduled to enter\ncommercial service at some point over the next three months. Each reactor has\nthe capacity to power half a million homes and businesses annually without\nemitting greenhouse gases. Despite this, they are hardly viewed as an\nunambiguous success.\n\nThe construction of those reactors \u2014 Units 3 and 4 of Plant Vogtle, the first\nU.S. nuclear reactors built from scratch in decades \u2014 was a yearslong saga\nwhose delays and budget overruns drove the giant nuclear company Westinghouse\ninto bankruptcy. The reactors, first approved by Georgia regulators in 2009,\nare reckoned to be the most expensive infrastructure project of any kind in\nAmerican history, at a total cost of $35 billion. That\u2019s nearly double the\noriginal budget of the project, which is set to cross the finish line seven\nyears behind schedule. Much of the cost was ultimately borne by Georgia\nresidents, whose energy bills have ballooned to pay off a portion of the\noverruns.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple fact that Vogtle had disastrous cost overruns and delays, and\nyou have to stare that fact in the face,\u201d said John Parsons, a researcher at\nMIT\u2019s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible\nthat nuclear, if we can do it, is a valuable contribution to the system, but\nwe need to learn how to do it cheaper than we\u2019ve done so far. I would hate to\nthrow away all the gains that we\u2019ve learned from doing it.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of learning experience Vogtle ends up being may well come down to\nhow it\u2019s interpreted by the state and regional utility officials who approve\nnew sources of power. Many are likely looking at the monumental expense and\ndifficulty of building Vogtle and thinking they\u2019d be foolish to try their hand\nat new nuclear power. Other energy officials, however, say those delays and\noverruns are the reason they\u2019d be foolish not to.\n\nThe case for building more nuclear plants in the wake of Vogtle rests on a\nsimple argument: Because the new reactors were the first newly built American\nnuclear plant to come online since 1993 \u2014 and the first to begin construction\nsince the 1970s \u2014 many of their challenges were either unique to a first-of-a-\nkind reactor design or a result of the loss of industrial knowledge since the\ndecline of the nuclear industry. Therefore, they might not necessarily recur\nin a future project, which could take advantage of the finalized reactor\ndesign and the know-how that had to be generated from scratch during Vogtle.\n\nThe Biden administration, which sees nuclear energy as an important component\nof its plan to get the U.S. to net-zero emissions by 2050, is betting that\nVogtle can pave the way for a rebirth of the nuclear industry.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nThe generational gap between Vogtle and previous nuclear projects meant that\nthe workforce and supply chain needed to build a nuclear plant had to be\nrebuilt for the new units. Their construction involved training some 13,000\ntechnicians, according to Julie Kozeracki, a senior advisor at the Department\nof Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office, a once-obscure agency that has become one of\nthe federal government\u2019s main conduits for climate investments under the Biden\nadministration.\n\nWhen Vogtle\u2019s Units 3 and 4 were approved by Georgia regulators in 2009, the\nreactor model, known as an AP1000, had never before been built. (It was\nWestinghouse\u2019s flagship model, combining massive generation capacity with new\n\u201cpassive safety\u201d features, which allow reactors to remain cooled and safe\nwithout human intervention, external power, or emergency generators in the\ncase of an accident.) It later emerged that the reactor\u2019s developer,\nWestinghouse, had not even fully completed the design before starting\nconstruction, causing a significant share of the project\u2019s costly setbacks.\nWhile that was bad news for Georgians, it could mean a smoother path ahead for\nfuture reactors.\n\n\u201cIn the course of building Vogtle,\u201d Kozeracki told Grist, \u201cwe have now\naddressed three of the biggest challenges: the incomplete design, the immature\nsupply chain, and the untrained workforce.\u201d\n\nThese factors helped bring down the cost of Unit 4 by 30 percent compared to\nUnit 3, Kozeracki said, adding that a hypothetical Unit 5 would be even\ncheaper. Furthermore, as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, the climate-\nfocused law that Congress passed in 2022, any new nuclear reactor would\nreceive somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of its costs back in tax credits.\n\n\u201cWe should be capitalizing on those hard-won lessons and building 10 or 20\nmore [AP1000s],\u201d Kozeracki said.\n\nDespite this optimism, however, no U.S. utility is currently building a new\nnuclear reactor. Part of the reason may be that it\u2019s already too late to\ncapitalize on the advantages of the Vogtle experience. For one thing, the\n13,000 workers who assembled Vogtle may not all be available for a new gig.\n\n\u201cThe trained workforce is a rapidly depreciating asset for the nuclear\nindustry,\u201d said John Quiggin, an economist at the University of Queensland, in\nan email. \u201cOnce the job is finished, workers move on or retire, subcontractors\ngo out of business, the engineering and design groups are broken up and their\ntacit knowledge is lost. If a new project is started in, say, five years, it\nwill have to do most of its recruiting from scratch.\u201d\n\nIn Quiggin\u2019s view, the opportunity has already passed, as much of the physical\nconstruction at Plant Vogtle happened years ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t go back and say,\n\u2018Look, we\u2019ve got the team, we know what we did wrong last time, we\u2019re going to\ndo it better this time.\u2019 It\u2019ll be a totally new group of people doing it,\u201d he\nsaid in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt would have been better to start five years ago,\u201d Kozeracki acknowledged.\n\u201cBut the second best time is right now.\u201d\n\nThe federal government has put money on the table, but whether a new nuclear\nplant will actually get built is ultimately in the hands of a constellation of\nplayers including the nuclear industry, utility companies, and utility\ncommissions, who would have to work together and overcome their current\nstalemate. None of them are clamoring to shoulder the risk of taking the first\nstep.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s hoping that someone else would solve the cost problem,\u201d Parsons\nsaid.\n\nUtility commissioners \u2014 the state-level officials, often in elected positions,\nwhose approval would be needed to site a future reactor \u2014 are wary of being\nblamed for passing on potential cost overruns to ratepayers.\n\n\u201cIt would just be surprising for me if a Public Service Commission signed off\non another AP1000 given how badly the last ones went,\u201d said Matt Bowen, a\nresearcher at Columbia\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n\nIf more nuclear energy is built soon, it will most likely be in the Southeast,\nwhere power companies operate under what\u2019s called a \u201cvertically integrated\nmonopoly\u201d profit model, meaning they do not participate in wholesale energy\nmarkets but rather generate energy themselves and then sell it directly to\ncustomers.\n\nUnder this model, utilities are guaranteed a return on any investment their\nshareholders make, which is paid for by their customers at rates set by the\nstate-level utility commissions. Many ratepayer advocates accuse these\ncommissions of effectively rubber-stamping utility demands as a result of\nregulatory capture \u2014 at the expense of customers who are unable to choose a\ndifferent power company. But this same dynamic means that vertically\nintegrated utilities are in the best position to build something as expensive\nas a nuclear plant.\n\n\u201cTheir primary business model is capital expenditure,\u201d explained Tyler Norris,\na Duke University doctoral fellow and former special advisor at the Department\nof Energy. \u201cThe way they make money is by investing capital, primarily in\ngeneration capacity or transmission upgrades. They have an inherent incentive\nto spend money; they make more money the more they spend.\u201d\n\nUnder the regulatory compact between states and utilities, it is utility\ncommissioners\u2019 job to make sure those expenditures (which ultimately, after\nall, come from ratepayer money) are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d\n\nTim Echols, a member of Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission, said in an email\nthat he would not approve another nuclear reactor in Georgia in the absence of\n\u201csome sort of federal financial backstop\u201d to protect against the risk of a\nrepeat of the Vogtle experience.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any other [utility commission] raise their hand to build a\nnuclear reactor,\u201d added Echols, who is also the chair of a committee on\nnuclear issues at the National Association of Regulatory Utility\nCommissioners.\n\nKozeracki, of the Department of Energy, said that private-sector nuclear\nindustry players have also asked for such a backstop in the form of a federal\ncost overrun insurance program, which would require Congressional legislation.\nHowever, she added that it might be incumbent upon industry figures to explain\njust how much more capacity to build such a backstop would give them.\n\n\u201cThe real piece that\u2019s missing there is a compelling plan from the nuclear\nindustry for what they would deliver with something like a cost overrun\ninsurance program,\u201d Kozeracki said.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate among nuclear advocates about whether a different\ntype of reactor, such as the so-called small modular reactors currently in\ndevelopment, is a more viable solution than the AP1000. The Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission has issued a permit for the Tennessee Valley Authority to build one\nsuch reactor. But the excitement around SMRs has somewhat waned since the\ncancellation of a much-anticipated project in November. Experts told Grist\nthat some, but not all, of the knowledge and lessons gained through the Vogtle\nexperience would carry over to a new project that was not an AP1000.\n\nThe search for new nuclear solutions is coinciding with what could be a\ndramatic juncture in the history of American energy planning. In recent\nmonths, utilities across the country have reported anticipating massive\nincreases in demand for electricity, which had remained relatively flat for\ntwo decades. A December report from the consulting firm Grid Strategies found\nthat grid planners\u2019 five-year forecasts for the growth of their power loads\nhad nearly doubled over the last year.\n\nThe growth in demand is largely attributed to a mix of new data centers, many\nof which will power artificial intelligence, as well as new industrial sites.\n\nFor James Krellenstein, co-founder of the nuclear energy consultancy Alva\nEnergy, this new load growth \u201cdramatically changes the calculus in favor of\nnuclear.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacing both the need to decrease carbon emissions while having to increase\nthe amount of power that we need, nuclear is a natural technology for that\nchallenge,\u201d Krellenstein added.\n\nSo far, however, utilities have responded instead by seeking to rapidly expand\nfossil fuel generation \u2014 in particular, by building new natural gas plants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing utilities put forward very large gas expansion plans, and this\nis eating nuclear\u2019s lunch,\u201d said Duke University\u2019s Norris.\n\nKozeracki characterized the utilities\u2019 plans as shortsighted. \u201cI recognize\nthat natural gas may feel like the easy button, but I should hope that folks\nare able to account for the cost and benefits of decarbonizing resiliently and\nmake choices their children will be proud of, which I think would be starting\nnew nuclear units now,\u201d she said.\n\nNorris urged caution in accepting the largest estimates of forecasted\nelectricity demand. \u201cUtilities have every incentive to characterize a worst\ncase scenario here for extreme load growth, and not seriously consider demand\nresponse solutions, so that they can justify very large capital expenditures\nfor capacity,\u201d Norris said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that the clean\nenergy and climate community be very engaged in these state level resource\nplanning processes.\u201d\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
