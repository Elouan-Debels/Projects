Games like\nHogwarts Legacy, Remnant 2, Alan Wake 2, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us\nPart 1, and Outpost: Infinity Siege have also reportedly been affected; the\nproblem primarily seems to affect titles made with Epic's Unreal Engine. Intel\nsaid in a statement to ZDNet Korea (via The Verge) that it's looking into the\nproblems, escalating it from an \"isolated issue\" to something that may be more\nwidespread and could require a more systemic fix.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nIntel\u2019s 6.2 GHz Core i9-14900KS is a reminder of why the MHz wars ended\n\nRelated CPUs like the i9-13900KF, i9-14900KF, i9-13900KS, and i9-14900KS may\nbe affected, too, since they're all the same basic silicon. Some user reports\nhave also indicated that the i7-13700K and i7-14700K series may also be\naffected.\n\n\"Intel is aware of reports regarding Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen unlocked\ndesktop processors experiencing issues with certain workloads,\" an Intel\nspokesperson told Ars. \"We\u2019re engaged with our partners and are conducting\nanalysis of the reported issues.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Intel hasn't indicated what it thinks could be causing the issue,\nsupport documents from Epic Games and other developers have suggested that the\nprocessors' power settings are to blame, recommending that users change their\nBIOS settings or manually restrict their processors' speed with tools like\nIntel's Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU). Most enthusiast motherboards will set\nthe power limits on Intel's processors to be essentially infinite, squeezing\nout a bit more performance (especially for i7 and i9 chips) at the expense of\nincreased power use and heat.\n\nEpic suggests using a BIOS power setting called \"Intel Fail Safe\" on Asus,\nMSI, and Gigabyte motherboards\u2014its name makes it sound like some kind of low-\npower safe mode, but it's most likely just setting the processors' power\nlimits to Intel's specified defaults. This could result in somewhat reduced\nperformance, particularly when all CPU cores are active at the same time. But\nwe and other reviewers have seen sharply diminishing returns when letting\nthese chips use more power. This can even be a problem with Intel's stock\nsettings\u2014the recently announced i9-14900KS can use as much as 31 percent more\npower than the standard i9-14900K while delivering just 1 or 2 percent faster\nperformance.\n\nIf power limits are to blame, the good news is that users can adjust these in\nthe short term and that motherboard makers could fix the problem in the long\nrun by tweaking their default settings in future BIOS updates.\n\nUpdated April 9, 2024, at 2:12 pm to add Intel spokesperson statement.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n47\n\nAndrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with\na focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of\noperating systems like Windows and macOS.
