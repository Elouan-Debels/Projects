The administration has strengthened U.S. alliances in\nAsia, restricted Chinese access to critical U.S. technologies, and endorsed\nthe bipartisan mood for competition. Yet the administration is squandering\nthese early gains by falling into a familiar trap: prioritizing a short-term\nthaw with China\u2019s leaders at the expense of a long-term victory over their\nmalevolent strategy. The Biden team\u2019s policy of \u201cmanaging competition\u201d with\nBeijing risks emphasizing processes over outcomes, bilateral stability at the\nexpense of global security, and diplomatic initiatives that aim for\ncooperation but generate only complacency.\n\nThe United States shouldn\u2019t manage the competition with China; it should win\nit. Beijing is pursuing a raft of global initiatives designed to disintegrate\nthe West and usher in an antidemocratic order. It is underwriting expansionist\ndictatorships in Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. It has more than\ndoubled its nuclear arsenal since 2020 and is building up its conventional\nforces faster than any country has since World War II. These actions show that\nChina isn\u2019t aiming for a stalemate. Neither should America.\n\nWhat would winning look like? China\u2019s communist rulers would give up trying to\nprevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and its friends. And\nthe Chinese people\u2014from ruling elites to everyday citizens\u2014would find\ninspiration to explore new models of development and governance that don\u2019t\nrely on repression at home and compulsive hostility abroad.\n\n### Stay informed.\n\nIn-depth analysis delivered weekly.\n\n#### Thank you for signing up. Stay tuned for the latest from Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn addition to having greater clarity about its end goal, the United States\nneeds to accept that achieving it will require greater friction in\nU.S.-Chinese relations. Washington will need to adopt rhetoric and policies\nthat may feel uncomfortably confrontational but in fact are necessary to\nreestablish boundaries that Beijing and its acolytes are violating. That means\nimposing costs on Chinese leader Xi Jinping for his policy of fostering global\nchaos. It means speaking with candor about the ways China is hurting U.S.\ninterests. It means rapidly increasing U.S. defense capabilities to achieve\nunmistakable qualitative advantages over Beijing. It means severing China\u2019s\naccess to Western technology and frustrating Xi\u2019s efforts to convert his\ncountry\u2019s wealth into military power. And it means pursuing intensive\ndiplomacy with Beijing only from a position of American strength, as perceived\nby both Washington and Beijing.\n\nNo country should relish waging another cold war. Yet a cold war is already\nbeing waged against the United States by China\u2019s leaders. Rather than denying\nthe existence of this struggle, Washington should own it and win it. Lukewarm\nstatements that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely court a hot war;\nthey signal complacency to the American people and conciliation to Chinese\nleaders. Like the original Cold War, the new cold war will not be won through\nhalf measures or timid rhetoric. Victory requires openly admitting that a\ntotalitarian regime that commits genocide, fuels conflict, and threatens war\nwill never be a reliable partner. Like the discredited d\u00e9tente policies that\nWashington adopted in the 1970s to deal with the Soviet Union, the current\napproach will yield little cooperation from Chinese leaders while fortifying\ntheir conviction that they can destabilize the world with impunity.\n\n### BIDEN\u2019S NEW BASELINE\n\nThe administration\u2019s China policy initially showed promise. President Joe\nBiden maintained the tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed on\nChinese exports in response to the rampant theft of U.S. intellectual\nproperty. He renewed, with some adjustments, the executive orders Trump had\nissued to restrict investment in certain companies affiliated with the Chinese\nmilitary and to block the import of Chinese technologies deemed a national\nsecurity threat. In a particularly important step, in October 2022, Biden\nsignificantly expanded the Trump administration\u2019s controls on the export of\nhigh-end semiconductors and the equipment used to make them, slowing Beijing\u2019s\nplans to dominate the manufacturing of advanced microchips. Across Asia,\nBiden\u2019s diplomats pulled longtime allies and newer partners closer together.\nThey organized the first summits of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security\nDialogue, bringing together the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the\nUnited States, and convened high-profile trilateral summits with the leaders\nof Japan and South Korea. Biden also unveiled AUKUS, a defense pact among\nAustralia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nAs it turned out, however, aggression would come from the opposite direction,\nin Europe. Less than three weeks before invading Ukraine, Russian President\nVladimir Putin had signed a \u201cno limits\u201d security pact with Xi in Beijing. In a\nprudent step after the invasion, Biden drew a redline by warning Xi in a video\ncall that the U.S. government would impose sweeping sanctions if China\nprovided \u201cmaterial support\u201d to Moscow. Xi nonetheless found plenty of ways to\nsupport the Russian war machine, sending semiconductors, unarmed drones,\ngunpowder, and other wares. China also supplied Moscow with badly needed money\nin exchange for major shipments of Russian oil. Chinese officials, according\nto the U.S. State Department, even spent more money on pro-Russian propaganda\nworldwide than Russia itself was spending.\n\nBeijing was also coordinating more closely with Iran and North Korea, even as\nthose regimes sent weapons to help Moscow wage war in Europe. Yet Washington\nwas pursuing siloed policies\u2014simultaneously resisting Russia, appeasing Iran,\ncontaining North Korea, and pursuing a mix of rivalry and engagement with\nChina\u2014that added up to something manifestly incoherent. Indeed, the situation\nthat Xi had forecast at the start of the Biden administration was becoming a\nreality: \u201cThe most important characteristic of the world is, in a word,\n\u2018chaos,\u2019 and this trend appears likely to continue,\u201d Xi told a seminar of\nhigh-level Communist Party officials in January 2021. Xi made clear that this\nwas a useful development for China. \u201cThe times and trends are on our side,\u201d he\nsaid, adding, \u201cOverall, the opportunities outweigh the challenges.\u201d By March\n2023, Xi had revealed that he saw himself not just as a beneficiary of\nworldwide turmoil but also as one of its architects. \u201cRight now, there are\nchanges, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen for 100 years,\u201d he said to Putin\non camera while wrapping up a visit to the Kremlin. \u201cAnd we are the ones\ndriving these changes together.\u201d\n\nIf ever the time was ripe to call out Beijing for fomenting chaos and to start\nsystematically imposing costs on the country in response, it was early 2023.\nBiden, inexplicably, was doing the opposite. On February 1, residents of\nMontana spotted a massive, white sphere drifting eastward. The administration\nwas already tracking the Chinese spy balloon but had been planning to let it\npass overhead without notifying the public. Under political pressure, Biden\nordered the balloon shot down once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a scheduled trip to Beijing to\nprotest the intrusion. Press reports suggested the administration had kept\nquiet about the balloon in order to gather intelligence about it. But a\ntroubling pattern of downplaying affronts by Beijing would persist in other\ncontexts.\n\n> Lukewarm statements that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely court\n> a hot war.\n\nIn June 2023, leaks to the press revealed that Beijing, in a remarkable echo\nof the Cold War, was planning to build a joint military training base in Cuba\nand had already developed a signals intelligence facility there targeting the\nUnited States. After a National Security Council spokesperson called reports\nabout the spy facility inaccurate, a White House official speaking anonymously\nto the press minimized them by suggesting that Chinese spying from Cuba was\n\u201cnot a new development.\u201d The administration also greeted with a shrug new\nevidence suggesting that COVID-19 may have initially spread after it\naccidentally leaked from a Chinese laboratory. If the virus, which has led to\nthe deaths of an estimated 27 million people worldwide, turns out to have been\nartificially enhanced before it escaped, the revelation would mark a turning\npoint in human history on par with the advent of nuclear weapons\u2014a situation\nthat already cries out for U.S. leadership to govern dangerous biological\nresearch worldwide.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, as Beijing\u2019s actions grew bolder, Biden initiated what\nthe White House termed an \u201call hands on deck\u201d diplomatic campaign\u2014not to\nimpose costs on Beijing but to flatter it by dispatching five cabinet-level\nU.S. officials to China from May to August. Blinken\u2019s June meeting with Xi\nsymbolized the dynamic. Whereas Xi had sat amiably alongside the billionaire\nBill Gates just days earlier, the U.S. secretary of state was seated off to\nthe side as Xi held forth from the head of a table at the Great Hall of the\nPeople. For the first time in years, Xi appeared to have successfully\npositioned the United States as supplicant in the bilateral relationship.\n\nWhat did the United States get in return for all this diplomacy? In the Biden\nadministration\u2019s tally, the benefits included a promise by Beijing to resume\nmilitary-to-military talks (which Beijing had unilaterally suspended), a new\ndialogue on the responsible use of artificial intelligence (technology that\nBeijing is already weaponizing against the American people by spreading fake\nimages and other propaganda on social media), and tentative cooperation to\nstem the flood of precursor chemicals fueling the fentanyl crisis in the\nUnited States (chemicals that are supplied mainly by Chinese companies).\n\nAny doubts that Xi saw the American posture as one of weakness were dispelled\nafter Hamas\u2019s October 7 massacre in Israel. Beijing exploited the attack by\nserving up endless anti-Israeli and anti-American propaganda through TikTok,\nwhose algorithms are subject to control by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\nChinese diplomats, like Russian ones, met with Hamas\u2019s leaders and provided\ndiplomatic cover for the terrorist group, vetoing UN Security Council\nresolutions that would have condemned Hamas. And there is little sign Beijing\nhas done anything, despite Washington\u2019s requests, to help rein in attacks\ncarried out by the Houthis on commercial vessels and U.S. warships in the Red\nSea\u2014attacks conducted by the Yemeni rebel group using Iranian missiles,\nincluding ones with technology pioneered by China. (Chinese ships,\nunsurprisingly, are usually granted free passage through the kill zone.)\n\nWhether Xi is acting opportunistically or according to a grand design\u2014or,\nalmost certainly, both\u2014it is clear he sees advantage in stoking crises that he\nhopes will exhaust the United States and its allies. In a sobering Oval Office\naddress in mid-October, Biden seemed to grasp the severity of the situation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing an inflection point in history\u2014one of those moments where the\ndecisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to\ncome,\u201d he said. Yet bizarrely\u2014indeed, provocatively\u2014he made no mention of\nChina, the chief sponsor of the aggressors he did call out in the speech:\nIran, North Korea, and Russia. Through omission, Biden gave Beijing a pass.\n\n### THAT \u201970S SHOW\n\nThe current moment bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1970s. The Soviet Union\nwas undermining U.S. interests across the world, offering no warning of its\nally Egypt\u2019s 1973 surprise attack on Israel; aiding communists in Angola,\nPortugal, and Vietnam; and rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and investing\nheavily in its conventional military. These were the bitter fruits of\nd\u00e9tente\u2014a set of policies pioneered by President Richard Nixon and his top\nforeign policy adviser, Henry Kissinger, who stayed on and continued the\napproach under President Gerald Ford. By using pressure and inducement, as\nwell as downplaying ideological differences, the United States tried to lure\nthe Russians into a stable equilibrium of global power. Under d\u00e9tente,\nWashington slashed defense spending and soft-pedaled Moscow\u2019s human rights\naffronts. The working assumption was that the Soviet Union\u2019s appetite for\ndestabilizing actions abroad would somehow be self-limiting.\n\nBut the Russians had their own ideas about the utility of d\u00e9tente. As the\nhistorian John Lewis Gaddis observed, the Soviets \u201cmight have viewed d\u00e9tente\nas their own instrument for inducing complacency in the West while they\nfinished assembling the ultimate means of applying pressure\u2014their emergence as\na full-scale military rival of the United States.\u201d Nixon and Kissinger thought\nd\u00e9tente would secure Soviet help in managing crises around the world and, as\nGaddis put it, \u201cenmesh the U.S.S.R. in a network of economic relationships\nthat would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the Russians to take\nactions in the future detrimental to Western interests.\u201d But the policy failed\nto achieve its goals.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977 intending to keep d\u00e9tente in\nplace, but the policy didn\u2019t work for him either. His attempt to \u201cde-link\u201d\nSoviet actions that hurt U.S. interests from Soviet cooperation on arms\ncontrol ultimately yielded setbacks in both categories. The Soviets became\nmore aggressive globally, and a wary U.S. Congress, having lost faith in\nMoscow\u2019s sincerity, declined to ratify SALT II, the arms control treaty that\nCarter\u2019s team had painstakingly negotiated. Meanwhile, Zbigniew Brzezinski,\nCarter\u2019s national security adviser, had grown increasingly skeptical of\nd\u00e9tente. Brzezinski felt that a turning point had come in 1978, after the\nSoviets sponsored thousands of Cuban soldiers to wage violent revolution in\nthe Horn of Africa, supporting Ethiopia in its war with Somalia. The Soviet\ninvasion of Afghanistan the following year was \u201cthe final nail in the coffin\u201d\nfor arms control talks, Brzezinski wrote in his journal\u2014and for the broader\npolicy of d\u00e9tente.\n\nBy the time President Ronald Reagan entered the White House, in 1981, Nixon\nand Kissinger\u2019s invention was on its last legs. \u201cD\u00e9tente\u2019s been a one-way\nstreet that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims,\u201d Reagan stated\nflatly in his first press conference as president, effectively burying the\nconcept.\n\nReagan sought to win, not merely manage, the Cold War. In a sharp departure\nfrom his immediate predecessors, he spoke candidly about the nature of the\nSoviet threat, recognizing that autocrats often bully democracies into silence\nby depicting honesty as a form of aggression. In 1987, when Reagan was\npreparing to give a speech within sight of the Berlin Wall, some of his aides\nbegged him to remove a phrase they found gratuitously provocative. Wisely, he\noverruled them and delivered the most iconic line of his presidency: \u201cMr.\nGorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d\n\n### THE SMOKELESS WAR\n\nWashington must adopt a similar attitude today and try harder to disseminate\ntruthful information within China itself and to make it possible for Chinese\ncitizens to communicate securely with one another. Tearing down\u2014or at least\nblowing holes in\u2014the \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d of China must become as central to\nWashington\u2019s approach today as removing the Berlin Wall was for Reagan\u2019s.\n\nBeijing is waging a bitter information war against the United States\u2014which is\nlosing, despite its natural advantages. Xi and his inner circle see themselves\nas fighting an existential ideological campaign against the West, as Xi\u2019s\nwords from an official publication in 2014 make clear:\n\n> The battle for \u201cmind control\u201d happens on a smokeless battlefield. It happens\n> inside the domain of ideology. Whoever controls this battlefield can win\n> hearts. They will have the initiative throughout the competition and combat.\n> . . . When it comes to combat in the ideology domain, we don\u2019t have any room\n> for compromise or retreat. We must achieve total victory.\n\nFor Xi, the Internet is the \u201cmain battlefield\u201d of this smokeless war. In 2020,\nthe scholar Yuan Peng, writing before he resurfaced under a new name as a vice\nminister of China\u2019s premier spy agency, also recognized the power of\ncontrolling speech online: \u201cIn the Internet era . . . what is truth and what\nis a lie is already unimportant; what\u2019s important is who controls discourse\npower.\u201d Xi has poured billions of dollars into building and harnessing what he\ncalls \u201cexternal discourse mechanisms,\u201d and other Chinese leaders have\nspecifically highlighted short-video platforms such as TikTok as the\n\u201cmegaphones\u201d of discourse power. They aren\u2019t afraid to use those megaphones.\nAccording to a February 2024 report from the Office of the Director of\nNational Intelligence, TikTok accounts run by Chinese propaganda outfits\n\u201creportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S.\nmidterm election cycle in 2022.\u201d\n\nAs the CCP seeks to set the terms of global discourse, what it wants more than\nanything from the United States and the rest of the West is silence\u2014silence\nabout China\u2019s human rights abuses, silence about its aggression toward Taiwan,\nand silence about the West\u2019s own deeply held beliefs, which contrast\nirreconcilably with the party\u2019s. It is no surprise, then, that so much of the\nCCP\u2019s strategy on the smokeless battlefield is about drowning out speech it\ndoesn\u2019t like\u2014both inside and outside China. It is American silence\u2014not\ncandor\u2014that is truly provocative, for it signals to the CCP that China is\nadvancing and the United States is retreating.\n\n### REARM, REDUCE, RECRUIT\n\nWhat U.S. officials need first is clarity about the contest with China. They\nhave to recognize that rising tensions are inevitable in the short run if the\nUnited States is to deter war and win the contest in the long run. Once they\nhave faced these facts, they need to put in place a better policy: one that\nrearms the U.S. military, reduces China\u2019s economic leverage, and recruits a\nbroader coalition to confront China.\n\nXi is preparing his country for a war over Taiwan. On its current trajectory,\nthe United States risks failing to deter that war, one that could kill tens of\nthousands of U.S. service members, inflict trillions of dollars in economic\ndamage, and bring about the end of the global order as we know it. The only\npath to avoid this future is for Washington to immediately build and surge\nenough hard power to deny Xi a successful invasion of Taiwan. Yet the Biden\nadministration\u2019s latest budget request sheds badly needed combat power,\nproposing the retirement of ten ships and 250 aircraft and a drop in the\nproduction goal for Virginia-class submarines from two per year to just one.\nIt replenishes only half the $1 billion that Congress authorized for the\npresident to furnish military aid to Taiwan. And in its 2023 supplemental\nrequest, the White House asked for just over $5 billion in weapons and\nindustrial base spending earmarked for the Indo-Pacific\u2014barely five percent of\nthe entire supplemental request. Looking at the budget trend line, one would\nthink it was 1994, not 2024.\n\nThe Biden administration should immediately change course, reversing what are,\nin inflation-adjusted terms, cuts to defense spending. Instead of spending\nabout three percent of GDP on defense, Washington should spend four or even\nfive percent, a level that would still be at the low end of Cold War spending.\nFor near-term deterrence in the Taiwan Strait, it should spend an additional\n$20 billion per year for the next five years, the rough amount needed to surge\nand disperse sufficient combat power in Asia. Ideally, this money would be\nheld in a dedicated \u201cdeterrence fund\u201d overseen by the secretary of defense,\nwho would award resources to projects that best align with the defense of\nTaiwan.\n\nThe deterrence fund should headline a generational effort directed by the\npresident to restore U.S. primacy in Asia. The priority should be to maximize\nexisting production lines and build new production capacity for critical\nmunitions for Asia, such as antiship and antiaircraft missiles that can\ndestroy enemy targets at great distances. The Pentagon should also draw on the\ndeterrence fund to adapt existing military systems or even civilian technology\nsuch as commercially available drones that could be useful for defending\nTaiwan. Complementing its Replicator Initiative, which tasks the services to\nfield thousands of low-cost drones to turn the Taiwan Strait into what some\nhave called \u201ca boiling moat,\u201d the Pentagon should quickly embrace other\ncreative solutions. It could, for example, disperse missile launchers\nconcealed in commercial container boxes or field the Powered Joint Direct\nAttack Munition, a low-cost kit that turns standard 500-pound bombs into\nprecision-guided cruise missiles.\n\n> What China wants more than anything from the United States and the rest of\n> the West is silence.\n\nFor U.S. forces to actually deter China, they need to be able to move within\nstriking range. Given the maritime geography of the Indo-Pacific and the\nthreat that China\u2019s vast missile arsenal poses to U.S. bases, the State\nDepartment will need to expand hosting and access agreements with allies and\npartners to extend the U.S. military\u2019s footprint in the region. The Pentagon,\nmeanwhile, will need to harden U.S. military installations across the region\nand pre-position critical supplies such as fuel, ammunition, and equipment\nthroughout the Pacific.\n\nBut the United States could keep the Chinese military contained and still lose\nthe new cold war if China held the West hostage economically. Beijing is bent\non weaponizing its stranglehold over global supply chains and its dominance of\ncritical emerging technologies. To reduce Chinese leverage and ensure that the\nUnited States, not China, develops the key technologies of the future,\nWashington needs to reset the terms of the bilateral economic relationship. It\nshould start by repealing China\u2019s permanent normal trade relations status,\nwhich provides China access to U.S. markets on generous terms, and moving\nChina to a new tariff column that features gradually increasing rates on\nproducts critical to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. The\nrevenue raised from increased tariffs could be spent on offsetting the costs\nthat U.S. exporters will incur as a result of China\u2019s inevitable retaliatory\nmeasures and on bolstering U.S. supply chains for strategically important\nproducts.\n\nWashington must also halt the flow of American money and technology to Chinese\ncompanies that support Beijing\u2019s military buildup and high-tech surveillance\nsystem. The Biden administration\u2019s August 2023 executive order restricting a\nsubset of outbound investment to China was an important step in the right\ndirection, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough. Washington must expand investment\nrestrictions to include critical and emerging technologies such as\nhypersonics, space systems, and new biotechnologies. It must also put an end\nto U.S. financial firms\u2019 disturbing practice of offering publicly traded\nfinancial products, such as exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, that\ninvest in Chinese companies that are on U.S. government blacklists. Using the\ncurrent export controls on advanced semiconductors as a model, the Department\nof Commerce should reduce the flow of critical technology to China by\nintroducing similar export bans on other key areas of U.S. innovation, such as\nquantum computing and biotechnology.\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon falling into the ocean near Surfside Beach, South\nCarolina, February 2023\n\nRandall Hill / Reuters\n\nAs China doubles down on economic self-reliance and phases out imports of\nindustrial goods from the West, the United States needs to recruit a coalition\nof friendly partners to deepen mutual trade. Washington should strike a\nbilateral trade agreement with the United Kingdom. It should upgrade its\nbilateral trade agreement with Japan and establish a new one with Taiwan,\nagreements that could be joined by other eligible economies in the region. It\nshould forge an Indo-Pacific digital trade agreement that would facilitate the\nfree flow of data between like-minded economies, using as a baseline the high\nstandards set by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nTo overhaul its dilapidated defense industrial base, the United States should\nturbocharge innovation in the defense industry by recruiting talented workers\nfrom allied countries. Every year, the U.S. government authorizes roughly\n10,000 visas through the EB-5 program, which allows immigrants to obtain a\ngreen card if they invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in American\nbusinesses. The program is rife with fraud and has deviated far from its\nintended purpose as a job-creation program, becoming mostly a method for\nmillionaires from China and other places to become permanent residents. These\nvisas should be repurposed as work authorizations for citizens of partner\ncountries who hold advanced degrees in fields critical to defense.\n\nThe U.S. government also needs to recruit the next generation of cold warriors\nto apply their talents to the contest with China. It should start by reversing\nthe crisis in military recruitment\u2014not by lowering standards, promising easy\npay, or infusing the force with diversity, equity, and inclusion ideology but\nby unapologetically touting the virtues of an elite, colorblind, all-volunteer\nforce and challenging young Americans to step up. The intelligence community\nalso needs to recruit experts in emerging technology, finance, and open-source\nresearch and make it easier to temporarily leave the private sector for a\nstint in government. National security agencies need to cultivate deep\nexpertise in Asia and in the history and ideology of the CCP. The curricula of\nthe service academies and war colleges, as well as ongoing professional\nmilitary education, should reflect this shift.\n\nFinally, U.S. officials need to recruit everyday Americans to contribute to\nthe fight. For all the differences between the Soviet Union yesterday and\nChina today, U.S. policymakers\u2019 squeamishness about the term \u201ccold war\u201d causes\nthem to overlook the way it can mobilize society. A cold war offers a\nrelatable framework that Americans can use to guide their own decisions\u2014such\nas a company\u2019s choice whether to set up a sensitive research and development\ncenter in China or an individual\u2019s choice whether to download TikTok. Too\noften, however, elected officials on the left and the right give the\nimpression that the competition with China is so narrow in scope that\nAmericans can take such steps without worry. The contest with Beijing, they\nwould have people believe, shouldn\u2019t much concern ordinary citizens but will\nbe handled through surgically precise White House policies and congressional\nlegislation.\n\n### CHINA AS A NORMAL COUNTRY\n\nIt is a peculiar feature of U.S. foreign policy today that the elephant in the\nroom\u2014the end state Washington desires in its competition with Beijing\u2014is such\na taboo subject that administrations come and go without ever articulating a\nclear goal for how the competition ends. The Biden administration offers up\nmanaging competition as a goal, but that is not a goal; it is a method, and a\ncounterproductive one at that. Washington is allowing the aim of its China\npolicy to become process: meetings that should be instruments through which\nthe United States advances its interests become core objectives in and of\nthemselves.\n\nWashington should not fear the end state desired by a growing number of\nChinese: a China that is able to chart its own course free from communist\ndictatorship. Xi\u2019s draconian rule has persuaded even many CCP members that the\nsystem that produced China\u2019s recent precipitous decline in prosperity, status,\nand individual happiness is one that deserves reexamination. The system that\nproduced an all-encompassing surveillance state, forced-labor colonies, and\nthe genocide of minority groups inside its borders is one that likewise\ndesecrates Chinese philosophy and religion\u2014the fountainheads from which a\nbetter model will eventually spring.\n\nGenerations of American leaders understood that it would have been\nunacceptable for the Cold War to end through war or U.S. capitulation. If the\n1970s taught Washington anything, it is that trying to achieve a stable and\ndurable balance of power\u2014a d\u00e9tente\u2014with a powerful and ambitious Leninist\ndictatorship is also doomed to backfire on the United States. The best\nstrategy, which found its ultimate synthesis in the Reagan years, was to\nconvince the Soviets that they were on a path to lose, which in turn fueled\ndoubts about their whole system.\n\n> Washington is allowing the aim of its China policy to become process.\n\nThe U.S. victory wasn\u2019t Reagan\u2019s alone, of course. It was built on strategies\nforged by presidents of both parties and manifested in documents such as\nNSC-68, the 1950 Truman administration policy paper that argued that the\nUnited States\u2019 \u201cpolicy and actions must be such as to foster a fundamental\nchange in the nature of the Soviet system.\u201d One can draw a straight line from\nthat document to National Security Decision Directive 75, the 1983 Reagan\nadministration order that called for \u201cinternal pressure on the USSR to weaken\nthe sources of Soviet imperialism.\u201d In some ways, it was the d\u00e9tente years,\nnot the Reagan years, that were an aberration in Cold War strategy.\n\nIronically, Reagan would end up pursuing a more fulsome and productive\nengagement with the Soviets than perhaps any of his predecessors\u2014but only\nafter he had strengthened Washington\u2019s economic, military, and moral standing\nrelative to Moscow and only after the Soviet Union produced a leader, Mikhail\nGorbachev, with whom Reagan could make real progress. Reagan understood that\nsequencing was everything. He also knew that the confrontational first phase\nwouldn\u2019t be easy or comfortable. His first directive on national security\nstrategy, in May 1982, predicted, \u201cThe decade of the eighties will likely pose\nthe greatest challenge to our survival and well-being since World War II.\u201d It\nwas a tense and unsettling period, to be sure, during which Reagan called out\nthe Soviet Union as \u201cthe focus of evil in the modern world\u201d and deliberately\nsought to weaken its economy and contest its destabilizing activities around\nthe world. Yet it paid off.\n\nXi, who has vilified Gorbachev and fashioned his own leadership style after\nthat of Joseph Stalin, has proved time and again that he is not a leader with\nwhom Americans can solve problems. He is an agent of chaos. Washington should\nseek to weaken the sources of CCP imperialism and hold out for a Chinese\nleader who behaves less like an unrelenting foe. This does not mean forcible\nregime change, subversion, or war. But it does mean seeking truth from facts,\nas Chinese leaders are fond of saying, and understanding that the CCP has no\ndesire to coexist indefinitely with great powers that promote liberal values\nand thus represent a fundamental threat to its rule.\n\nThe current mass exodus of Chinese people from their homeland is evidence they\nwant to live in nations that respect human rights, honor the rule of law, and\noffer a wide choice of opportunities. As Taiwan\u2019s example makes plain, China\ncould be such a place, too. The road to get there might be long. But for the\nUnited States\u2019 own security, as well as the rights and aspirations of all\nthose in China, it is the only workable destination.\n\nLoading...\n\n### You are reading a free article.\n\n#### Subscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\n\n  * Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\n  * Unlock access to iOS/Android apps to save editions for offline reading\n  * Six issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n  * MATT POTTINGER served as U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser from 2019 to 2021 and as Senior Director for Asia on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2019.
