That's absurd\nand needs to stop. https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/last-72-hours\n\nFor royal bay hacks, I wanted to create a solution for school shootings to\nhelp save young lives!\n\n## How it works\n\nThe system uses 3 different detection methods and a dashboard for government\npurposes:\n\n### Cameras\n\nCameras would be placed inside of schools to detect gun being brought in and\ncall 911. This would be the first line of defense.\n\n### Audio\n\nBased off decibels (Would love to train a model to do this though) it would\ndetect gun shot decibel levels, compare them to gunshot audios and then call\nthe police. This is the second line of defense.\n\n### Dashboard\n\nI've also created a dashboard where all the calls to 911 and why will show up\nto, this can help with rare false-calls and government use purposes.\n\n## Features I would love to add\n\nNot everything I said here was implemented in the 10 hours given, some things\nI'd like to implement are:\n\n  * Gunshot audio ml detection\n  * Better dashboard\n  * Better camera detection\n  * Building a first iteration hardware device that incorporates all of these\n  * So much more!\n\n## About\n\nDetects gun violence in schools using a mix of audio and cameras and calls the\npolice to the location. Displays 911 calls on a dashboard for government.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n5 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 63.1%\n  * JavaScript 33.2%\n  * CSS 3.7%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
