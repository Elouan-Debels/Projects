That\u2019s because the\ncompany\u2019s phones have user-repairable designs and the company sells spare\nparts (and sometimes even hardware upgrades).\n\nLast year the company expanded into the wireless audio space with the launch\nof premium over-ear, wireless, noise-cancelling headphones called the Fairbuds\nXL that also have a modular, repairable design. Now the company is doing it\nagain, but this time smaller. The Fairbuds are a pair of true wireless earbuds\nfeaturing sustainable design elements.\n\nThe Fairbuds have the sort of features we\u2019ve come to expect from premium\nearbuds. They\u2019re noise-cancelling Bluetooth 5.3 earbuds with support for wind\nnoise reduction and an environmental noise-cancelling feature that sets noise\nreduction depending on your environment.\n\nFairphone\u2019s earbuds have six microphones, 11mm drivers, and an IP54 rating for\nwater (and sweat) resistance. They also support multipoint connectivity, which\nmeans you can connect the earbuds to two different devices at the same time\n(like your phone and your laptop).\n\nThe earbuds offer up to 6 hours of battery life and they come with a charging\ncase that gives you another 20 hours of use between charges. And Fairphone\noffers iOS and Android apps that let you adjust EQ, install firmware updates,\nand make other changes.\n\nOther features include automatic play and pause when the Fairbuds are removed\nfrom your ears, capacitive touch controls, and three different ear tips sizes\nincluded in the box.\n\nBut the key thing that makes these earbuds different from the competition is\nthat they\u2019re designed to be repairable rather than replaceable. Lose just one\nearbud? Fairphone will let you buy a single earbud without paying again for a\nfull set with a case. Is your battery life degrading a few years after\npurchase? Fairphone will sell battery replacements and let you swap out the\nbatteries in your earbuds or charging case.\n\nAll told, the company offers seven repairable/replaceable components for the\nFairbuds:\n\n  * Earbud (left)\n  * Earbud (right)\n  * Earbud battery and silicon ring kit\n  * Earbud tips\n  * Charging case outer shell\n  * Charging case core\n  * Charging case battery\n\nSince one of the main reasons people tend to replace older gear is that the\nbatteries no longer hold a charge, the inclusion of user-replaceable batteries\nalone could dramatically extend the longevity of the Fairbuds. And it\u2019s\nparticularly impressive that Fairphone was able to include user-replaceable\nbatteries in something as small as a set of true wireless earbuds, while still\noffering IP54 water resistance.\n\nIt apparently took the company a while to achieve, because these are actually\nthe company\u2019s second set of true wireless earbuds. The Fairphone TWS Earbuds\nlaunched a few years ago as a pretty standard set of earbuds that lacked the\nrepairability factor of the new models, and only really stood out thanks to\nFairphone branding and the use of recycled materials. Those earbuds have now\nbeen discontinued, but Fairphone continues to offer spare single earbuds,\ncharging cases, and replacement tips.\n\nThe company also offers a 3-year warranty for its new Fairbuds and notes that\nthey\u2019re manufactured using:\n\n  * 70% of all materials used in production are fair and recycled (fair = ethically sourced).\n  * 100% of rare earth elements used are recycled.\n  * Plastics used in the Fairbuds and their charging case are recycled.\n\nThe Fairbuds are available now in Europe for \u20ac149. Unfortunately, like most\nFairphone products, they have yet to launch outside of Europe.\n\n## Support Liliputing\n\nLiliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links\n(if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on\nAmazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).\n\nBut there are several ways you can support the site directly even if you're\nusing an ad blocker* and hate online shopping.\n\n### Contribute to our Patreon campaign\n\nor...\n\n### Contribute via PayPal\n\n* If you are using an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and seeing a pop-up message at the bottom of the screen, we have a guide that may help you disable it.\n\n## Subscribe to Liliputing via Email\n\nJoin 9,545 other subscribers\n\nTagged: earbuds, fairbuds, fairphone, true wireless earbuds\n\n## Join the Conversation\n\n2 Comments\n\nCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
