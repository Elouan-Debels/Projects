It took me six months to regain the ability to do anything beyond\nresting the moment I was done working, and in the past year I have recovered\nmuch of my ability to function, though not necessarily in the sense of\nspending eight hours in an office - that is forever gone. Instead, I find\nmyself producing all sorts of things that I never had the time, energy, or\nspark for when I was spending thirty minutes commuting to the city, crammed\nshoulder-to-shoulder with the rest of the populace, a further eight hours in\nthe hideous lighting of an open-plan office, and closing out with a final\nthirty minutes commuting back home. This is the life lived by most knowledge\nworkers, and it was one where people sometimes openly envied me for, after a\nfew months of acclimatizing, having the energy to go to the gym consistently\nafter work. And, just between the internet and me, I was leaving the office a\nhalf-hour early without permission, three times a week, so that the squat rack\nwouldn't be totally occupied or I wouldn't have even been getting that done.\n\nI was living for the weekend, watching the clock 'till closing time, and\notherwise embodying \"Happy Friday!\" energy, a phrase that still absolutely\nrocks me with the juxtaposition of good-natured cheerfulness and the dystopian\nacknowledgement we'd all rather be doing something else. This was a period of\nmy life where I was earning more money than I knew what to do with, being both\nsingle and without dependents, but once the rush of wealth wore off, it\nstopped meaning a whole lot to me. Not imagining anything better was possible,\nI was actually quite happy about it for a while after leaving university -\nputting aside the time it took to realize that most people were just\npretending to work for five of the eight hours of the day, and to become numb\nto all that vacant-eyed screen-staring.\n\nNow that I'm (mostly) out, I'm starting to realize, with some intense dismay,\nexactly how much I was giving up.\n\n# I. Meaning From Work\n\nSince largely escaping the office, my \"work\" has been very different. In that\ntime, I've created a (barely non-zero revenue) business with some of my\nclosest friends^1, de-anonymized myself despite using language that will\nstress my very conservative father out when he finally reads this blog, caused\na stir on Hackernews a few times, and started a podcast. Some of this is a\nreal accomplishment, some of this isn't^2, and the jury is still out on a fair\nwhack of it.\n\nBut the character of the work itself is very, very different. For one thing, I\nam earning A$90K less per year (i.e, losing that money in opportunity cost)\nbecause I refused to take a five-day-a-week gig last year, and currently\nreceive only about A$1.7K a year for my writing, but I value that little bit\nof money so much more. It just about pays for all my music classes being\nforty-five minutes instead of thirty minutes, and I savour every second of\nthem because I feel like I've earned them producing something that brings\npeople joy.\n\nIn fact, there are all sorts of stark differences. When I went to an office,\nI'd have days where I'd drag myself out of bed and wish I could get just a\nlittle more sleep in, but the neighbor's dog woke me up at 5AM. Now I wake up\nand think, \"Well, I'd love to sleep a bit more, but I get to make a cup of tea\nand enjoy working in that beautiful moment before the world is fully awake.\" I\nfrequently force myself not to roll out of bed and start writing within a\nminute of waking up in a desperate bid to maintain some semblance of not being\na Ritalin-addled Silicon Valley \"thought leader\". This is a relationship with\nlabour that I never expected to experience, and it really is wonderful. I make\nsome exceptions for the painful parts of the business (read: grinding out\nleads) which frankly still aren't nearly as bad parsing yet another\nspreadsheet while wishing that you had one of the desks next to a window.\n\nPeople talk a lot about the joy they get from stakeholders and customers\ntelling them their product was useful. Not only have I rarely experienced this\nin a believable way, a fair few of the people who espouse happiness about this\nstrike me as having brainwashed themselves into valuing very strange things. A\ngreat deal of small work has real value and I don't wish to denigrate that,\nbut there are clearly flavours of work that are more meaningful to most people\nthan others. I always think of HR - I didn't have a single peer at university\nwhose fondest wish was to spend eight hours a day harassing strangers to\ncomplete useless mandatory training, but we find ourselves here anyway. More\nconcretely, many people in my specialty (data) end up talking about how\nappreciative their internal users are with visual upgrades to a dashboard\nwhich is opened a few times a month. Sure, I'm glad someone feels good about\nthat. But surely that's inferior to someone in data entry saying that the new\nUI reduces their toil, and that's inferior to optimization algorithms\nincreasing patient flow at a hospital. The mania in the eyes of the corporate-\nbred when they discuss \"prettier dashboard\" with the same zeal as \"literally\nsaved lives\" scares me.\n\nI read a book called Radical Focus a few weeks ago, which was fine. I learned\nsome useful things. But it has this bizarre tendency for the protagonists, who\nhave a company working on the supply chain of tea to retailers, keep saying\nthe company is changing the world, something that is technically true and\nmight resonate for some true tea aficionados (and Godspeed to them). But if\nwe're being honest, if this was said in real-life, probably by someone that\ncalls themselves an entrepreneur, it would usually indicate that your\ninterlocutor has been captured by an ideology best described as \"wanting more\nVC money\"... which as I say, I realize is their main concern in the book.\n\nWe can just admit that some stuff is meaningful, but, with all things being\nequal, most of us can trivially imagine something that would be more\nmeaningful to us, were it not for the pesky problem of earning a living and\ncorporations being pathological.\n\nIn my first job, I had to get used to the awkward energy of having people lie\nto me about my work being useful because they didn't know I could see they\nnever opened it, and most data initiatives are useless to customers because\nthey're managed so badly. Someone, somewhere, had to write that LinkedIn\nfeature that tries to automatically generate spam responses to posts on their\nown platform, a feature that I desperately wish that I could have been in the\ndiscussions for just to see what on earth is happening over there, and I can\nassure you with total certainty that a fucking moron tried to tell the\nengineers involved that the work was meaningful.\n\nWhat are we fucking doing as a society? I am also reminded of Netflix chad\nPrimagen telling the story of how he spent a year of his life getting Black\nMirror to display S4:E1 to users on their homepages instead of S1:E1, a\n\"feature\" that was mostly perceived as a bug to the best of my knowledge.\n\nI must contrast that with opening my inbox and seeing:\n\n> Long time reader, first time writer. Thank you for writing! Thanks for all\n> the fish Europe Trip and free lunch Love your work Hello from Atlanta Trip\n> to Europe and Lunch? If you're in Amsterdam Thank you from a delighted\n> reader in Barcelona! Just a hello and some thanks from the other side of the\n> planet Europe Coffee / Beers Thank you for your writing! Norway has coffee\n> and hikes.\n\nI've even committed some of the business' time (as have my co-founders) to\nassisting Tina Lam's research into combating alcoholism, whose team can't\npossibly afford the rates that professional software engineers charge but Tina\nsent me this gorgeous watercolor painting of my pet rabbit apropos of nothing.\n\nIn the face of these gestures of appreciation, it is difficult to contemplate\nwhat I might have given up had I worked in slightly-less-toxic-but-still-toxic\nworkplaces. Like a frog being boiled I would have just kept slogging away,\nnever quite experiencing enough discomfort to arrange something better for\nmyself. I may have my own doubts, like most people, about the value of what I\nput out, but I won't be so rude as to deny that other people value it or that\nit brings me happiness to see it valued. What a terrible deal it all was in\nretrospect. For A$90K, give up an international network of friends, a chance\nat owning your own business, your health, and your energy!\n\n# II. Intellectual Growth\n\nOver the past few months, I've found myself reasoning a little bit more deftly\nwith each passing week. That's the only way I can think of to describe it -\nI've been connecting thoughts in disparate fields that have surprised myself,\nbeen speaking more fluently, and otherwise felt switched-on in a way that I\nhaven't for a long, long time. A friend of many years stopped me to ask if I'm\nokay, and when I asked why, he said I sounded smarter. Despite this, as\nsomeone chronically arrogant in my late teens, I was concerned that I was\ngetting high on my own supply.\n\nThen, on a whim, I popped open my old Master's thesis code. It's a deeply\nflawed piece of work for various reasons, ranging from my own inadequacies as\na young engineer to my truly accursed university-bred workflow, but it looks\nastonishingly complex to me, to the degree that both the code and the actual\ntext of the thesis look like they were written by someone ten times smarter\nthan me. I dimly recall checking out a physical copy of Mardia and Jupp's\nDirectional Statistics which does appear in the citations of the paper, but\nwas there really a point in 2019 where, instead of blearily reading over the\npandas documentation to deliver a report no one is going to read, I was so\nconcerned with how to write an expectation-maximization algorithm from scratch\nto estimate the parameters of mixed von Mises distributions that I checked out\na physical book? That sounds like some fucking nonsense they'd say in Star\nTrek right before explaining why the warp core is about to overload for the\ntenth time that season.\n\nThen it clicked. The feeling of suddenly feeling smart was just reclaiming the\nintellectual life that the corporate world demanded I sacrifice. I used to\nspend huge numbers of hours reading, to the point that my poor, despairing\nparents used to tell me off for developing a strange left-handed claw-grip\nthat I would use to manipulate books during meals, and I kept reading all the\nway through university. The fact that I was giving this up never occurred to\nme because \"you'll be too tired to read something complex\" isn't in the\ncontract I signed with my first employer, it's just sort of baked into the\nfabric of the universe at all but the greatest workplaces. Reading slowly\ndropped off until it wasn't happening at all, not even for something useful!\nJust to stare at a screen then go home.\n\nI couldn't glance over at a book during office hours, because non-engineers\n(and bad engineers) think it looks bad when I stopped staring at my computer\nscreen while I was in the office, and even audiobooks prevented me from\nreadily pausing and pondering whatever I was listening to. The train was too\npacked at 8:30 AM in Melbourne to have enough space to turn pages without\nborderline fondling my fellow passengers. I had to stop engaging with a wide\nrange of topics that were too nuanced or controversial to be suitable for\noffice discussion, such as whether the institution should come out in support\nof same-sex marriage or whether the green crayons taste better. I was lucky\nenough to get home by 5:30 PM, which left me just enough time to be done with\nthe gym, showered, and fed by 7PM if I really hustled.\n\nUnfortunately, there are scarcely any other arrangements available within the\nnormal social script, especially due to my visa situation at the time. But\neven excluding that constraint, the industry has congregated on some strange\nnorms where they default to a 9AM to 5PM workday, and can't tell which\nengineers are productive so we mostly have a few productive people subsidizing\nothers that are scared of version control.\n\nI am university education's greatest nemesis - I think having a degree that\nwasn't obtained for visa reasons makes many candidates less appealing. What\nwas good is that I had sixteen hours a day free to indulge my curiosity\n(because I was studying psychology which, even as someone who is deeply\ninvested in the field, I must concede is basically a pseudoscience at the\nlevel it is taught in undergraduate courses). I did not spend this time very\nwisely - I am always reminded of Scott Galloway repeatedly admitting that he\nspent his time at university smoking pot and watching Planet of the Apes over\nand over. I wasted about 80% of my time, but the remaining 20% ended up being\nincredibly formative simply because I had so much of it.\n\nStarting from my first year, I drilled hundreds of hours of sabre fencing,\nwhich is a simple but fascinating exercise in game theory, complete with rock-\npaper-scissors style tactical wheels. In fencing, I watched and participated\nin my own rivalries that drove people to the absolute peaks of their personal\nperformance - mine wasn't that high but it was higher than I thought - and\nwatched other people wash out because they didn't have the discipline for\ntraining. I even watched my old club fall apart as one or two of the strongest\nveterans left, which tells you a lot about how excellence works in most\nplaces.\n\nAfter one of my philosophical units, I read Practical Ethics in its entirety\nsimply because the university insisted I buy the whole book to read a few\nchapters. Around this time, I came across Taleb's The Black Swan and as many\nother books as I could stomach. I had enough time to watch probably every talk\nfrom Christopher Hitchens that's available on YouTube (what a fucking\nchampion) multiple times, and regardless of what you think of him, the man\ncould talk and the man could write. I did so many things that I probably can't\neven remember 95% of them, ranging from getting far too invested in running a\ngood tabletop game to trying out 5AM Muay Thai classes^3.\n\nEventually, I moved on to my Masters in Data Science (also a borderline\nfraudulent degree - they cancelled Data Structures & Algorithms because none\nof the students were taking it) and fumbled around with some Python, before\nfinally writing what felt like the insurmountable challenge of my thesis.\n\nOccasionally, my education distracted me from my learning^4 but I persevered.\n\nThen I graduated, got my first A$100,000 salary and... did... nothing. I mean,\nI worked, whatever that means, but it's strange what we teach students what\nthe world is going to be like. You get through primary school, where they tell\nyou to get your act together because high school will be the real deal. Then\nyou go through high school, where they tell you to get your act together\nbecause university is the real deal. Then you go to university, where you're\ntold to get your act together because the workplace will be the real deal.\n\nThen you go to the workplace where, at the overwhelming majority of\nworkplaces, it takes weeks to make a firewall change, and the three most\nimportant skills are how busy you can look, how close you are to being a\nconfident-tall-white-cis-dude (only one of which you can change), and how good\nyou are at telling the boss that they're awesome without being so clumsy as to\nsound like a sycophant. Other skills become more important as you defect from\nthe system and play smarter games, but those are clearly the most important\nthings for advancement in a large corporation, and I'm brown, outspoken, and\nof average height. A bit of a heads up that society, broadly speaking, doesn't\nwant me advancing too far or rocking the boat would have been awesome.\n\nMy problems turned from the sophisticated, mind-broadening concerns that my\nsupervisors encouraged me to think about, such as how conceptualizing model\nfit in terms of information theory is a parsimonious framework for penalizing\noverly-complex theories, to the utterly dull, where dimwits asked me to use\nExcel to plot linear regressions because it's what they were familiar with,\neven if it made no sense. I no longer opened books, I read out-of-date\nConfluence pages to learn about acronyms for bespoke enterprise systems that I\ndidn't care about. Soon, it had been over a year since I had truly had a\ncomplex insight into any topic, and I was instead having all my energy\ndeflected into meaningless issues such as \"Why does the I.T department keep\ntelling me I can have that VM I need, then scheduling another meeting saying\nit needs further review?\" or \"How do I convince people that say they do their\nlearning on LinkedIn to give two fucks about my work?\".\n\nAmidst this all was a barrage of people repeating platitudes that sound people\noriented but boil down to something toxic. \"Complaining about these things\nshows that you aren't a mature engineer\", which is really \"You aren't a good\nsoftware engineer if you think it's possible to drive value by writing good\ncode instead of dealing with organizational dysfunction\", or \"This is just the\nreality of the industry\" which translates to \"Thinking that better work is\npossible is naive and immature\", which does nothing other than drive people\nfrom the field or away from taking care of themselves, and isn't even true.\nYes, sometimes a person saying this stuff is guilty of all charges, but\nsometimes they're totally right that everyone should shut up and let them fix\nthe problem. Only a Sith deals in absolutes, you scumbags.\n\n> She reached down and picked a crab out of a bucket. As it came up it turned\n> out that three more were hanging on to it. \"A crab necklace?\" giggled\n> Juliet.\n>\n> \"Oh, that's crabs for you,\" said Verity, disentangling the ones who had\n> hitched a ride. \"thick as planks, the lot of them. That's why you can keep\n> them in a bucket without a lid. Any that tries to get out gets pulled back.\n> yes, as thick as planks.\u201d\n\nAt the very core of this is the simple observation that life trends towards\nwhatever you spend your time on, and I was being paid what was, in retrospect,\nnot enough to spend almost all my time structuring my life around things that,\nif they didn't impoverish me, enriched me at a tiny fraction of what I could\nhave been doing. I thought I was being paid to turn up at an office, but I was\nactually being paid to no longer have the time or energy to seriously better\nmyself. The deal makes sense until I have enough money to comfortably avoid\nhomelessness, then each dollar gets less and less valuable, but society only\nhas a default template to buy most of us in five-day-a-week batches whether\nyou like it or not.\n\n# III. Corporate Topics Are Largely Dead-Ends\n\nAt the core of this is the simple fact that the topics at most (not all)\nworkplaces are an endless labyrinth of growth-related dead-ends, almost all\noriented at somehow convincing people to better themselves against their\nincentives. This seemed to me like a necessary ingredient to work, until I\ndirectly experienced that there is an endless chasm between what this is in\nthe best case and the average case. The best case is a collaboration where\neveryone learns a lot and leaves feeling respected, and once you've tasted it\nyou can't go back. The average case is trying to incentivize someone to care\nwhen they've worked out that they don't need to learn anything new to continue\ndrawing a salary. The way to personal development is fraught with diversions\ninto trying to fix these fundamental issues that feel like they are going to\nlead you to a great deepening, but in practice are simply shallow nonsense for\nunserious people.\n\nFor one of the most extreme and somewhat sympathetic examples, consider the\nindustry around Agile and Scrum, even though we all know this is something I\nhate doing. Whatever you think about the broad ideas around Agile originally,\nthe thing that we actually have has become some putrid, shambling mound\nreplete with a thousand salivating mouths, all asking why you haven't cleared\nmore tickets this week.\n\nThe shambling mound is an object which deserves hatred, but consider the\nindividuals that constitute that mound. Most of us have direct experience with\nthe fact that there are people that sincerely will spend the rest of their\ncareers shuffling Jira cards around a board, never realizing that a Story\npoint is not supposed to be a unit of time, and they will nonetheless spend\nmost of their professional lives thinking and stressing about this. They will\nlose sleep, they'll have their mental health atrophy, they will cheer when\nthey accidentally load up a sprint with easy tasks and mistake the velocity\nfor something they did right, and otherwise engage in a career that consists\nof nothing more than Agile-flavoured astrology.\n\nIn other words, they think they're being paid to help a product ship features,\nbut are in fact committing themselves to decades of an impoverished\nintellectual life. It is all, fundamentally, nonsense, and I find it\nprofoundly sad when I see this. Half of me wants to shake people and say \"My\nGod! You don't have to live like this!\", and the other half wants to gently\nreassure them that scoping tasks down to the hour, as pointless an activity as\nexists, was worth all the misery they endured. Most of us end up being\ndeflected from the things that are most authentic to us into matters that\nmerely sound like they aligned with our goals, though perhaps less visibly\nthan the people who have never read the literal four lines of the Agile\nmanifesto.\n\nOne of the first flavours of this that I fell for was the trite adage of\ntrying to \"educate my stakeholders\" into making more reasonable requests from\ndata teams. Is it possible to help a non-specialist understand how to best\nmake use of your talents? Yes, and it's a huge part of the job description,\neven now as a consultant. Can you educate everyone that has no interest in\nlearning and no general competence? Of course not, that's why everyone says\nthe hardest part of consulting is finding good clients. The fact that people\nwill happily say that you can and acknowledge that the hardest part of\nconsulting is finding good clients shows that they aren't thinking clearly,\nbecause those are more-or-less mutually exclusive lines of thought. The\nfiction that you're somehow going to accomplish a harmonious working\nenvironment without the ability to tell someone to fuck off is only propagated\nin corporate environments. The moment you have to earn money yourself and\nsurround yourself with people on the same journey, it evaporates in its\nentirety. There are many, many people that I don't want to work with, that I\ndon't want to \"educate\", whose narcissism, short-sightedness, and all-around\ndisrespect are someone else's problem because I value my health. But when I\nwas spending all my time at a normal corporate gig, it was my problem, and\nmost teams are one bad hire away from entering such a dynamic.\n\nThe first client that approached my consultancy had a website outage which was\ncosting them approximately A$1.4K per day, at a rough estimate. When I cited a\nbill of A$5K to fix the (simple) issue and then ensure that it never happens\nagain, they immediately came back with some fairly insulting questions about\nhow the work could possibly be worth that much for \"changing a few lines\" (at\nwhich point I declined the work), similarly insulted the cheaper overseas\ncontractor I forwarded them on to, and eventually spent two weeks finding\nsomeone to fix the issue on Fiverr. Then they went back to that contractor to\ntell them how they got the problem solved for A$50 after losing two weeks of\nrevenue. They took the time to reach out just to insult someone that was\ntrying to help. That all sounds comical except that fucker still runs a\ncompany and some poor bastard is out there having to deal with that sort of\ntreatment.\n\nI also once watched a woman working in data science, at the request of someone\nthat gets on stages in Melbourne as a thought leader and executive, produce a\nten page document explaining the concept of artificial intelligence and what\nit was capable of doing. She worked on it for several days, delighted that\nsomeone had finally demonstrated an interest in actually doing the whole\nmachine learning thing correctly, instead of just asking for more\nspreadsheets. The executive, who asked for it, said that the ten minutes it\nwould take to read was \"too long\" then asked her to produce a spreadsheet.\n\nThe idea that it's always the ground staff's fault for failing to play\npsychotherapist to the disrespectful people is something you can waste years\non. You can, of course, develop as a person at a company by the simple virtue\nof living your life and talking to people, but it is hardly an effective way\nto do so, at least in typical engineering roles. I've still only seen one\n(small) business that wasn't subject to this sort of borderline-\npsychologically-violent personality, and it happens to be our main client.\n\nWorking with them is such a Zen experience that I can feel my blood pressure\ndropping just thinking about it. The last time I visited, we talked at length\nabout what would serve the business best strategically, got diverted into a\nconversation about how mermaid.js-driven documentation is delightful, hammered\nout an action plan, then got lunch with the whole team. Then they paid me my\nhighest hourly rate ever voluntarily because they didn't need us to do the\nwork ourselves but wanted us to feel valued. And for the purposes of this\narticle, neither of us wasted any time trying to handle the other party like\ntoddlers.\n\n# IV. Touching Grass\n\nThere are many, many downsides to not working a comfortable office job. I\nmentioned to a recruiter that I sometimes contemplated whether it was healthy\nfor me to spend so many hours in an office. He replied that he used to be a\nplumber, and that he would regale me with tales of working at 5:30AM in the\nfreezing mud if I ever wanted to bail. I believed him.\n\nBut the first day I had off from work was a Thursday. I went down into the\nMelbourne city center with a book, and ended up lying down in a park with a\nbook, in beautiful weather. Glancing over, I realized I could see the office\nthat I would have been working from a few weeks ago, where I wouldn't even\nhave been able to see the park because I didn't have a window seat.\n\nWhenever a company tells me they have more than one mandated day in the office\n(even I'll concede that socializing a little bit might make sense), I tell\nthem to piss off.\n\n# V. Dedicating The Mind To Ugly Topics\n\nRich Hickey has a wonderful talk titled Hammock Driven Development, on what it\ntakes to do high-quality work. The man, to the best of my understanding, more-\nor-less made Clojure, which means we take his talks very seriously here. It is\na ponderous piece on how really deep work is produced by some strange\ninteraction between loading your mind with important information and then\nbasically lounging in peace. I've had my own experience with this, having\nsolved most of the hardest problems I've ever worked on in the shower the next\nmorning, and sometimes I've seen the negative side of this. During the Covid\nlockdowns, I had to stop playing chess because I would wake up exhausted from\ntrying to solve unsolvable tactical puzzles in my sleep. I'm not saying this\nwas making me better at chess, I'm just saying the unconscious mind is doing\nsome truly weird stuff and we'd be foolish to pretend we know exactly what,\nand I'd rather not load it with garbage.\n\nIt took me about thirty seconds to punch 'Hammock Driven Development' into\nKagi^5, knowing with absolute certainty that I'd find something to illustrate\nmy point. I immediately landed on the following quote on Hackernews from a\ndelightful fellow named Felix Dahlke:\n\n> Reminds me of how I solved some of the hardest problems I've ever worked on\n> (all in side projects) while being on parental leave, pushing around\n> strollers. During that time I had something of 1-2 hours at the keyboard\n> each day, but endless hours to think. It was quite the enlightening\n> experience, I was literally shocked how much I got done as opposed to\n> exploring problems while writing code.\n>\n> But I've never managed to find that kind of focus at work, neither as\n> developer nor CTO, neither remote nor on site. I feel I've always spent a\n> large chunk of my time trying to get people to explain the problem they're\n> trying to solve, to stop rushing, or to reduce scope. Tragic, really.\n\nI suspect that I am a lot more productive, even in crude, capitalist, give-\nshareholders-a-return-on-investment terms, when I am free to idly work at a\nsensible pace. In fact, this is why I am a software engineer instead of doing\nbrutal manual labour - because working on a domain where a leisurely stroll\ncan translate into immense value is a great way to live in a system that is\nfocused on value extraction. When I fill my days with meetings around whether\nthe Change Approval Board (CAB) is going to give us the go-ahead for a project\nwhere they literally don't know what we're talking about, my thoughts are now\nfilled with the CAB. Is this necessary for the functioning of a large\norganization? I have my doubts, but I'm willing to accept that for now. Is\nthis what I want my subconscious to be working on? Fuck no, and I don't get\ncontrol over this if I have to sit through four hours of meetings on it. Even\nwhen I did my best to embrace the old \"work-life balance\" schtick, clocking\nout at 5PM sharp, my subconscious was still worrying away at soulless,\nuninteresting problems.\n\nSomething I spend a lot of time reiterating is that one of the key things that\nyou pay a large class of professionals for is their judgement. You can pay for\nother things, such as their muscles if you're moving to a new house and want\nmovers, but even in that case you're paying for experienced-driven judgements\nsuch as:\n\n  1. Judging what orientation would be the most effective in getting that couch through this door\n  2. Working out how many people it would take to semi-safely move this cupboard\n\nIn the case of software engineers, you're paying a lot for design intuition,\nand that is only partially solved by paying someone to sit in front of a\nscreen and demand they think about a particular topic. I currently have\nextremely clear career savings of A$500K and ambiguous savings^6 of A$1.2M,\nwith literally everything else I've worked on for an employer having been a\ntotal and complete waste of everyone's time. I really, really think, removing\nthat first year or so where I made my most egregious blunders, that I could\nhave been producing something like A$200K in surplus per year measured in\nnothing other than mistake-avoidance and workflow improvements (excluding the\nnon-repeatable events of finding lots of \"save hundreds of thousands of\ndollars\" buttons), had I been free to actually both think without constantly\nhaving to justify that the job will take as long as it'll take. God knows what\nthat number could actually be if I actually shipped products instead of\nslapping people's hands every time they reach for Lambda functions because\nthey heard serverless is good.\n\n(But that's another dead-end: wasting endless time trying to convince people\nat larger businesses that one's role should be fundamentally different, or\nthat the organization can be made competent. Not a single person out of the\nhundreds of emails I've gotten have provided an example of someone\ntransforming their job this way, but it is also a myth that persists. Every\nsuccess story involved either starting one's own business or going somewhere\ngood that someone else started. A reader recently ran into the legendary Kent\nBeck at a book signing. On the topic of improving the median organization,\nBeck said that all he ever got out of it was stress-driven eczema. I am\nneither smarter nor more experienced than Kent Beck.)\n\nThis is a somewhat painful topic to think about for me, because while there\nare many things that I'm happy to sacrifice, my intellectual development isn't\none of them, though I may sing a different tune if I find myself feeding kids.\nI'd be a homeowner now if I had been okay continuing to put full-time hours\ninto an office environment, and knowing that might never happen as the market\ngrows beyond my savings is not easy. This is the reverse problem, where I'd\nalmost prefer it if having endless hours free to think deeply didn't change me\nas a person for the better... but how could it not be thus? Should we be\nsurprised that studying mathematics makes one better at maths? Then I wouldn't\nhave to answer hard questions about what this means for everyone in the\nworkforce in general. Do we really have to choose growth or home ownership? Is\nit crazy to think we could have both?\n\nI had some job interviews which I really didn't enjoy recently, and I declined\nto proceed to the next stage despite receiving another decent offer. After the\nsecond interview, I caught Iain McLaren for lunch, the mysterious lawyer than\nnonetheless is a formidable programmer that I mentioned here, and said\nsomething to the effect of:\n\n> \"I'm a bit worried that my standards are too high.\"\n\nTo which Iain replied, very quickly and in a manner which suggested he hears\nthis a lot and never approves of it:\n\n> \"Go on, but I don't think there's such a thing.\"\n\nThere are much worse starting points than that for taking care of yourself.\n\n# VI. Taking Time With People I Love Away\n\nFrom Jeremy Jone's beautiful essay about his grandfather's life:\n\n> The best time of his life was when his girls were little, Ray said as he\n> neared the end.\n\nMany things are less-than-ideal about working from home in a tiny, tiny\napartment, but I got to watch The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager\nwith my brother over the last three years with the extra time. One day, when\nwe're no longer so close or one of us is gone, I can't imagine trading those\nmoments away for any amount of money.\n\n# VII.\n\nWe're trying this new thing where I attempt to strike a hopeful note. It was\nnot hard to make the trades necessary to be where I am today (not wealthy but\nvery free), and I'm certain that a more talented engineer than myself can pass\nthe \"take care of a family\" threshold while still maintaining control over\ntheir time, with a little bit of daring and cunning, with cunning being the\nultimate virtue.\n\nSome weeks ago, I was talking to a psychologist about the painful conditions\nthat practicing clinicians undergo when they enter a poorly-run practice,\nwhich as per Sturgeon's Law which all the high-performance professionals I\nmeet endorse and the peanut gallery insists is a sign of immense arrogance (we\nmight both make valid points), is most clinics. It is not unusual to have many\nextremely distressed clients back-to-back, and the only way out is typically\nto start a private practice after grinding out a few years of experience^7. I\nremarked that it seemed very scary to have to do such a thing, and even I, a\nprobably-overconfident person, was only able to take a stab at it because I\nknow my three days in the office effectively protects me from serious threats\nsuch as homelessness. The psychologist, a much wiser person than myself due to\nboth age and exposure to suffering, said:\n\n> \"Of course, but in life you have to go and get the things that you want, and\n> that takes vision and courage.\"\n\nThere's a lot to mull over, and a lot of it is best reserved for individuals,\npreferably with a lot more life experience than me. I'm just going to focus on\nenjoying the comfort that my tiny, rented apartment and lots of free time\nbrings me. But I wish everyone lots of vision and courage.\n\n  1. One of the reasons that I always say we're not earning much money, to the distress of people that wisely want me to project staying power to clients, is that I really don't want to underhandedly jockey for clout. A low-revenue consultancy is about as impressive as running an unprofitable business on VC money - it's literally as failed as a business can get and should be embarrassing, despite the glamour society throws at such people. \u21a9\n\n  2. Funnily enough, since my first post ever was #1, I still genuinely have absolutely no idea if this hard or not, but I don't know who does know the answer to this question or if asking it would make me sound like a jerk. \u21a9\n\n  3. During my second class, someone demonstrated what a knee to the stomach at extremely low intensity feels like as part of a conditioning exercise, and I decided that I'm a lover, not a fighter. \u21a9\n\n  4. \"This group presentation teaches communication skills!\", or more accurately, \"We couldn't think of another assignment and this way we can pay someone to mark your work during class which is already paid for, and the tutor can do four students at once!\" \u21a9\n\n  5. You've left the horror of Google for the blessed peace of Kagi already, right? \u21a9\n\n  6. The project still hasn't shipped, but it would certainly be 100% dead without my intervention. \u21a9\n\n  7. In the same vein, I certainly find myself wishing that I had gotten jaded around the age of 35, after a reasonable stint at Google, whereupon I could probably just make bank doing Kubernetes correctly for people. Alas, I was in the spreadsheet mines. \u21a9\n\nSubscribe via RSS / via Email.\n\nPowered by mataroa.blog.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
