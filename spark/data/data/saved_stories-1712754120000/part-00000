But first...\na review of the last 24 hours of Large Language Model news. All times are in\nUS Pacific.\n\n  * 11:01am: Google Gemini Pro 1.5 hits general availability, here\u2019s the blog post\u2014their 1 million token context GPT-4 class model now has no waitlist, is available to anyone in 180 countries (not including Europe or the UK as far as I can tell) and most impressively all the API has a free tier that allows up to 50 requests a day, though rate limited to 2 per minute. Beyond that you can pay $7/million input tokens and $21/million output tokens, which is slightly less than GPT-4 Turbo and a little more than Claude 3 Sonnet. Gemini Pro also now support audio inputs and system prompts.\n  * 11:44am: OpenAI finally released the non-preview version of GPT-4 Turbo, integrating GPT-4 Vision directly into the model (previously it was separate). Vision mode now supports both functions and JSON output, previously unavailable for image inputs. OpenAI also claim that the new model is \u201cMajorly improved\u201d but no-one knows what they mean by that.\n  * 6:20pm (3:20am in their home country of France): Mistral tweet a link to a 281GB magnet BitTorrent of Mixtral 8x22B\u2014their latest openly licensed model release, significantly larger than their previous best open model Mixtral 8x7B. I\u2019ve not seen anyone get this running yet but it\u2019s likely to perform extremely well, given how good the original Mixtral was.\n\nAnd while it wasn\u2019t released today (it came out last week), this morning\nCohere\u2019s Command R+ (an excellent openly licensed model) reached position 6 on\nthe LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard\u2014the highest ever ranking for an open\nweights model.\n\nSince I have a lot of software that builds on these models, I spent a bunch of\ntime today publishing new releases of things.\n\n#### Datasette Extract with GPT-4 Turbo Vision #\n\nI\u2019ve been working on Datasette Extract for a while now: it\u2019s a plugin for\nDatasette that adds structured data extraction from unstructured text, powered\nby GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nI updated it for the new model releases this morning, and decided to celebrate\nby making a video showing what it can do:\n\nI want to start publishing videos like this more often, so this felt like a\ngreat opportunity to put that into practice.\n\nThe Datasette Cloud blog hasn\u2019t had an entry in a while, so I published\nscreenshots and notes there to accompany the video.\n\n#### Gemini Pro 1.5 system prompts #\n\nI really like system prompts\u2014extra prompts you can pass to an LLM that give it\ninstructions about how to process the main input. They\u2019re sadly not a\nguaranteed solution for prompt injection\u2014even with instructions separated from\ndata by a system prompt you can still over-ride them in the main prompt if you\ntry hard enough\u2014but they\u2019re still useful for non-adversarial situations.\n\nllm-gemini 0.1a2 adds support for them, so now you can do things like this:\n\n    \n    \n    llm -m p15 'say hi three times three different ways' \\ --system 'in spanish'\n\nAnd get back output like this:\n\n> \u00a1Hola! \ud83d\udc4b \u00a1Buenos d\u00edas! \u2600\ufe0f \u00a1Buenas tardes! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nInterestingly \u201cin german\u201d doesn\u2019t include emoji, but \u201cin spanish\u201d does.\n\nI had to reverse-engineer the REST format for sending a system prompt from the\nPython library as the REST documentation hasn\u2019t been updated yet\u2014notes on that\nin my issue.\n\n#### datasette-enrichments-gpt using GPT-4 Turbo #\n\nAnother small release: the datasette-enrichments-gpt plugin can enrich data in\na table by running prompts through GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4 Vision. I\nreleased version 0.4 switching to the new GPT-4 Turbo model.\n\n#### Everything else #\n\nThat covers today... but my last weeknotes were nearly four weeks ago! Here\u2019s\neverything else, with a few extra annotations:\n\n#### Blog entries #\n\nAll five of my most recent posts are about ways that I use LLM tools in my own\nwork\u2014see also my How I use LLMs and ChatGPT series.\n\n  * Building files-to-prompt entirely using Claude 3 Opus\n  * Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser\n  * llm cmd undo last git commit\u2014a new plugin for LLM\n  * Building and testing C extensions for SQLite with ChatGPT Code Interpreter\n  * Claude and ChatGPT for ad-hoc sidequests\n\n#### Releases #\n\nMany of these releases relate to ongoing work on Datasette Cloud. In\nparticular there\u2019s a flurry of minor releases to add descriptions to the\naction menu items added by various plugins, best illustrated by this\nscreenshot:\n\n  * datasette-enrichments-gpt 0.4\u20142024-04-10 Datasette enrichment for analyzing row data using OpenAI\u2019s GPT models\n  * llm-gemini 0.1a2\u20142024-04-10 LLM plugin to access Google\u2019s Gemini family of models\n  * datasette-public 0.2.3\u20142024-04-09 Make specific Datasette tables visible to the public\n  * datasette-enrichments 0.3.2\u20142024-04-09 Tools for running enrichments against data stored in Datasette\n  * datasette-extract 0.1a4\u20142024-04-09 Import unstructured data (text and images) into structured tables\n  * datasette-cors 1.0\u20142024-04-08 Datasette plugin for configuring CORS headers\n  * asgi-cors 1.0\u20142024-04-08 ASGI middleware for applying CORS headers to an ASGI application\n  * files-to-prompt 0.2.1\u20142024-04-08 Concatenate a directory full of files into a single prompt for use with LLMs\n  * datasette-embeddings 0.1a3\u20142024-04-08 Store and query embedding vectors in Datasette tables\n  * datasette-studio 0.1a3\u20142024-04-06 Datasette pre-configured with useful plugins.
