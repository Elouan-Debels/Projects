The stereotype of a state functionary is grumpy, unhelpful, and\nirritable. Do they choose them like that on purpose? More likely, they become\nlike that as they assume their roles.\n\nThe reason they behave like misanthropes, the authors write, is that they\ndon't have the authority to help you. If you didn't bring the right number of\nsigned copies required for your visa application, the immigration desk clerk\nis not allowed to accept it. It's not that they wouldn't be glad to help you,\nnor that they couldn't physically process the document: they must not. This\nturns them into the harbingers of bad news. It elects them as your official\nenemies. So they can't help but act as such.\n\nWhen you spend enough time controlling an avatar very different from you\u2014for\nexample the armed protagonist of a battle video game\u2014you're hit by the Proteus\nEffect, where your behavior and personality changes to be more consistent with\nyour virtual appearance. Psychologists have found, for example, that players\nwho were assigned taller and more attractive characters in a fantasy video\ngame performed better at the game, and were more aggressive negotiators both\nwithin the game and, for a while, outside of it (the effect was small but\nconsistent).\n\nIt's as if we unconsciously adapt to what we think we're supposed to be like.\nThis aligns with Benjamin Franklin's famous hypothesis that, to win someone's\nfavor, the best method is to ask them for a favor. From his autobiography: \"He\nthat has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than\nhe whom you yourself have obliged.\"\n\nIn other words, make people feel like they're the kind of person that is\ngenerous to you, and they'll act accordingly.\n\nThere is more to the definition of self than a name, a face, and a collection\nof memories. You (and everyone else) are constantly observing your current\nstate as it relates to your environment and especially to other people, and\nyou adjust your behavior to account for it. Whenever your framing and model of\nthe world change, so does the Tree of Possibilities you perceive for yourself.\nAn action that was previously inhibited might become more likely. Something\nyou'd normally do before, now looks inappropriate.\n\nIt doesn't matter if there is little or no change \"in reality\". When you play\na video game the only thing that actually changes is which pixels lit up on a\nscreen, and when the bureaucrat refuses to accept your papers there is no\nphysical law preventing them. It doesn't matter, because we live in real\nsystems, but we always act in imaginary ones. This is the Thomas Theorem:\n\n> If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.\n\nIt means that invisible forces, conjured by shared imagination, can sway and\ncondition and even define us.\n\nIt also means that, often enough, changing yourself is as easy as reframing a\nthought. \u25cf\n\nAll content is licensed under\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\n", "frontpage": false}
