What tools would you use?\n\n> The most important part is deciding what to do! You don\u2019t just make any old\n> music, then decide how to spread the word.\n>\n> You decide BEFORE you make the music: What could we create that would be SO\n> noteworthy, SO remarkable, that there\u2019s no way it could be ignored?\n>\n> If it were me, I\u2019d probably make some freaky Blue Man Group type band, and\n> we\u2019d often do michevious publicity stunts to give the media something to get\n> worked-up about.\n>\n> As for tools, I\u2019d try to find ones that aren\u2019t already saturated with music.\n> Maybe an artistic use of Twitter. Or Improv Everywhere.\n>\n> But really I\u2019d make sure that I was always in a real three-way conversation\n> with my fans. Encourage them to talk with me and with each other. Make my\n> success their success, like Obama.\n\n### What are your feelings towards the major record labels today? Have they\ncompletely missed the big picture as far as how to market artists and\ndistribute their songs?\n\n> It\u2019s easy to look at them as buffoons (like we do politicians), but most of\n> them are surprisingly smart.\n>\n> If you just look at results (the current biggest-sellers), they\u2019re almost\n> all on major labels, so it\u2019s just bad logic to say that the labels are doing\n> everything wrong. Many things wrong, yes. But not everything.\n>\n> This last 10 years has been humbling for them. It\u2019s shaken out the people\n> that are only in it for the money. So most of the people at labels today are\n> in it for the right reasons, and are more entrepreneurial.\n\n### Why is the indie scene alive and kicking while the major labels are\nsuffering?\n\n> Most indies can profit off of 10,000 sales, but majors can\u2019t. Their\n> different expectations change their costs.\n>\n> The music business might be like the poetry business some day. Which means:\n> almost no profit, and people do it because they want to, never for the\n> money. I\u2019m sure there are some companies making money off of poetry, but not\n> many. Not making millions. So labels still have to get incredibly lean and\n> efficient, so they can actually profit off of something that sells only\n> 10,000 copies.\n\n### Since lots of indie musicians make their livings primarily on touring,\nwhat do you think the proposed Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger will do to\nindie artists trying to play big venues? Will there be enough smaller venues\nleft to support the smaller artists?\n\n> Every trend has a counter-trend. Video moving to bite-size bits on YouTube?\n> At the same time, the super-long narrative (Lost, Sopranos, 24) is more\n> popular than ever.\n>\n> So if big venues are gobbled up and homogenized, there will be a counter-\n> trend of tons of small places offering small concerts. Whether small\n> businesses or house concerts.\n\n### Did you sell CDBaby because of the decline of recorded music? Is the\nrecorded music business among indie labels still thriving?\n\n> I only left CD Baby for personal reasons. I like to challenge myself to stay\n> immersed in the unknown. I had been doing CD Baby for 10 years. It was too\n> familiar. That was enough.\n>\n> Recorded music is definitely still thriving for indies. They\u2019re on more of a\n> level playing field than ever. Sales are up.\n\n### I\u2019m not sure what your experience is with agents, managers, promoters,\netc., but you have talked to numerous successful (and probably unsuccessful)\nmusicians over the years. What is the general consensus on how musicians feel\nabout those people? Do they feel that they need a manager to get gigs? Do you\nthink independent artists need managers today?\n\n> Well... Most musicians feel if they just had a good manager/agent/promoter\n> they\u2019d be \u201call set\u201d.\n>\n> But most managers/agents/promoters will tell you \u201cmost artists aren\u2019t ready\n> yet\u201d.\n>\n> I agree. I\u2019m a hard-ass when it comes to talent, because I was a hard-ass on\n> myself. I wrote, improved, recorded, and perfected over 100 songs before I\n> ever released one! Produced and engineered those 100 songs, playing all the\n> instruments myself. I practiced my vocals for 2 intense hours a night for 5\n> years before anyone heard me sing. I would write twenty verses for every\n> song, to find two good ones. I\u2019ve performed over 1000 shows in 10 years, to\n> all kinds of audiences. 8am in the cold to kids. 2am to a drunken southern\n> bar. Learning how to win over every kind of crowd under any situation.\n>\n> So if I were to invest in an artist, I\u2019d expect nothing less than what I\u2019d\n> done, as just a basic entry-level way of showing they\u2019re serious about this,\n> and are going to commit at least 10 years of non-stop diligent self-\n> improvement to it.\n>\n> In other words, I think it\u2019s the artist\u2019s responsibility to develop\n> themselves to the point where they\u2019ve proven their persistence and ability\n> to make music that people love - to put on a show that people love.\n>\n> Then yes, once they\u2019ve got more bookings than they can handle, it\u2019s a good\n> time to hand that job to an agent.\n>\n> As for a manager, I think that should be like a business-minded band member.\n> One person in the band whose sole job is to handle the business and\n> marketing. It doesn\u2019t have to be a professional manager. But yes, someone of\n> that mindset should definitely be included always. Don\u2019t go too long without\n> one!\n\n### If I could take away just a few things from what I\u2019ve learned about you,\nthey would be: 1. Be true to yourself. 2. It\u2019s all about the music! 3. Don\u2019t\ndo it (start a business, band or anything) for the money or some other\nmaterial motivator; do it because it helps you, it helps other people or\nbecause it\u2019s what you love to do. Is this accurate? Is there anything you\nwould add?\n\n> Cool. There\u2019s a great quote: \u201cIf you can learn music, you can learn\n> anything.\u201d\n>\n> Making music is a great vehicle for self-improvement.\n>\n> To be a great musician, you have to learn how to focus. You have to observe\n> yourself objectively to notice what needs improvement, and have the\n> dedication to improve that, even when you think you can\u2019t.\n>\n> To be a successful professional musician, you have to learn how to look at\n> yourself through others\u2019 eyes. You have to understand why the venue owner is\n> really booking artists, why this person really signed your mailing list, and\n> why people really go out to a bar at midnight on a Thursday.\n>\n> It\u2019s an amazing learning experience, and as you\u2019ve noticed, I\u2019m endlessly\n> fascinated in this side of things.\n\n\u00a9 2009 Derek Sivers\n\n", "frontpage": false}
