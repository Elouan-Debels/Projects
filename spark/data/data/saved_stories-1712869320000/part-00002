Barely a\nday passes without a new headline about the concept, which envisions computer\nsystems outperforming humans at various cognitive tasks.\n\nIn the last month alone, a trio of tech luminaries have added fresh\nproclamations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggested AGI would arrive within five\nyears. Ben \u201cfather of AGI\u201d Goertzel forecasted a mere three. Elon Musk\ntypically made the boldest prediction for the tipping point: the end of 2025.\n\nStill, not everyone is so bullish. One notable sceptic is Yann LeCun, Meta\u2019s\nchief AI scientist and a winner of the prestigious Turing Award.\n\nOften referred to as one of three \u201cgodfathers of AI,\u201d LeCun goes as far as to\nargue that \u201cthere is no such thing as AGI\u201d because \u201chuman intelligence is\nnowhere near general.\u201d The Frenchman prefers to chart a path towards \u201chuman-\nlevel AI.\u201d\n\nThe <3 of EU tech\n\nThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder\nBoris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox.\nSign up now!\n\nAt an event on Tuesday in London \u2014 Meta\u2019s flagship engineering hub outside the\nUS \u2014 LeCun said even that remains a distant destination.\n\nHe pointed to a quartet of cognitive challenges: reasoning, planning,\npersistent memory, and understanding the physical world.\n\n\u201cThose are four essential characteristics of human intelligence \u2014 also animal\nintelligence, for that matter \u2014 that current AI systems can\u2019t do,\u201d he said.\n\nWithout these capabilities, AI applications remain limited and error-prone.\nAutonomous vehicles still aren\u2019t safe for public roads. Domestic robots\nstruggle with basic household chores. Our smart assistants can only complete\nbasic tasks.\n\nThese intellectual shortcomings are particularly prominent in large language\nmodels (LLMs). In LeCun\u2019s view, they\u2019re severely restricted by their reliance\non one form of human knowledge: text.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re easily fooled into thinking they are intelligent because of their\nfluency with language, but really, their understanding of reality is very\nsuperficial,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re useful, there\u2019s no question about that. But on the path towards\nhuman-level intelligence, an LLM is basically an off-ramp, a distraction, a\ndead end.\u201d\n\n## Why LLMs aren\u2019t as smart as they seem\n\nThe likes of Meta\u2019s LLaMA, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, and Google\u2019s Bard are trained on\nenormous quantities of data. According to LeCun, it would take a human around\n100,000 years to read all the text ingested by a leading LLM. But that\u2019s not\nour primary method of learning.\n\nWe consume far more information through our interactions with the world. LeCun\nestimates that a typical four-year-old has seen 50 times more data than the\nworld\u2019s biggest LLMs.\n\n\u201cMost of human knowledge is actually not language so those systems can never\nreach human-level intelligence \u2014 unless you change the architecture,\u201d LeCun\nsaid.\n\nNaturally, the 63-year-old has an alternative architecture. He calls it\n\u201cobjective-driven AI.\u201d\n\n## Objectives of intelligence\n\nObjective-driven AI systems are built to fulfil specific goals set by humans.\n\nRather than being raised on a diet of pure text, they learn about the physical\nworld through sensors and training on video data.\n\nThe result is a \u201cworld model\u201d that shows the impact of actions. All the\npotential changes are then updated in the system\u2019s memory.\n\nWhat would be the difference, for instance, if a chair is pushed to the left\nor the right of a room? By learning through experience, the end states begin\nto become predictable. As a result, machines can plan the steps needed to\ncomplete various tasks.\n\nLeCun is quietly confident about the pay-off.\n\n\u201cEventually, machines will surpass human intelligence... it\u2019s gonna take a\nwhile though,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just around the corner \u2014 and it\u2019s certainly\nnot next year like our friend Elon has said.\u201d\n\nOne of the themes of this year\u2019s TNW Conference is Ren-AI-ssance: The AI-\nPowered Rebirth.
