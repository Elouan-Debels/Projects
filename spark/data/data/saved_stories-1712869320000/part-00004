Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, and they\nhave a big advantage.\n\nApril 4th, 2024 - By: Adam Kovac\n\nThe total amount of data will swell to about 200 zettabytes of data next year,\nmuch of it stored in massive data centers scattered across the globe that are\nincreasingly vulnerable to attacks of all sorts.\n\nThe stakes for securing data have been rising steadily as the value of that\ndata increases, making it far more attractive to hackers. This is evident in\nthe scope of the attack targets \u2014 today that can include software, hardware,\nand the networks and interconnects through which data moves \u2014 as well as the\nrising security budgets for governments and companies. But as the number of\nattacks and the sophistication of the attackers continues to increase, along\nwith the growing complexity of devices used to process and store all of this\ndata, the need to secure systems has taken on a new sense of urgency.\n\nA recent report by Stuart Madnick, professor of information technology at MIT,\nfound that between 2022 and 2023 more than 2.6 billion personal records were\nbreached, up from 1.1 billion in 2021 and 1.5 billion in 2022, and that 80% of\ndata breaches involved data stored in the cloud. Moreover, Madnick found that\n98% of organizations have a relationship with a vendor that was breached in\nthe last two years. On U.S. government networks, there were 14 million known\nexploited vulnerabilities remediated and 900 million malicious DNS requests\nblocked, according to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nPut simply, the number of new attack vectors is growing, but the old ones\naren\u2019t going away. This has led to significant efforts to beef up security on\nall fronts.\n\n\u201cData center chips are, just by the nature of the location and the U.S. model,\ngenerally quite physically secure,\u201d said Lee Harrison, director of automotive\nIC solutions at Siemens EDA. \u201cThey\u2019re typically locked up in a data center\nwith quite strict access, compared to some other areas. If you take into\naccount IoT or automotive, where people can physically get their hands on the\nchips and physically tamper with them, data center devices are actually quite\nsecure from a physical perspective.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the CPU/GPU/NPU, or the memories connected to them that are\nundergoing changes. One large processor vendor, for example, has been\nratcheting up security for power management chips that communicate directly\nwith various processing elements.\n\n\u201cThere is communication between the power management and the GPU, or the main\nCPU, for how much current or power is demanded, and what the voltage variation\nshould be,\u201d said Davood Yazdani, senior director of product marketing at\nInfineon. \u201cThat sets the voltage and current and temperature. If you get\ncontrol of that communication, you can easily drop the voltage and cause a\nshutdown, or you could damage the power management or even the main CPU.\nEspecially in the server applications, we are seeing requests for certain\nsecurity features to be implemented in the power management devices, or any\nCPU or GPU that has a digital interface, because that\u2019s an area that might get\ncompromised.\u201d\n\nAll of this adds to the cost and the complexity of systems. But it doesn\u2019t\nguarantee data will remain secure. With enough attempts and planning, even\nold-school approaches sometimes work. Consider the SolarWinds attack in 2020,\nfor example, which provided back-door hardware access to some 18,000\ncustomers, including many U.S. government agencies. That attack served as a\nreminder that all avenues of attack need to be considered.\n\nOf particular concern are attacks that take advantage of increasing\ndigitalization and the flood of data being processed and stored. That has\ndriven rising complexity in both hardware and software, in addition to many\nmore interactions between workers (particularly with hybrid office/home work\nschedules). Coupled with higher-value data being collected, processed, and\nstored online, there is a growing incentive for hackers of all types to begin\nprobing for weaknesses at every level. That includes stealing data with state-\nof-the-art encryption, which cannot be breached today, but which is very\nlikely to be breached at some future date with more powerful computers and\nmore collaboration among hackers.\n\n\u201cMore and more parties started to use data centers to store their data because\nthey wanted to have fast team connections \u2014 fast connections from home to\nSharePoint,\u201d said Gijs Willemse, senior director of product management for\nRambus Security. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t maintain local networks or storage anymore.\nThey really moved to data centers, and with that, the most valuable data moved\nto data centers. That\u2019s the reason why we saw the bar being raised, and we\u2019re\nat a point where governments also start to protect and store data in those\ngigantic centers, just because it\u2019s more efficient.\u201d\n\nMuch of that data is still connected, however, and in many cases what it\u2019s\nconnected to \u2014 operational technology and industrial control systems, for\nexample, \u2014 are not state-of-the-art. \u201cThey were designed for zero access, but\nit\u2019s like they were designed in a bubble because they didn\u2019t need internet\naccess or the ability to push logs out,\u201d said Jim Montgomery, principal\nsolutions architect at txOne Networks. \u201cThey weren\u2019t moving logs to the cloud\nor allowing remote access. But over the last few years, they\u2019ve had to adjust\neverything to accommodate for situations like COVID, where they weren\u2019t\nallowing anybody into the environments. That accommodation typically added\nsome sort of remote access, and they basically created their own monster. You\ncan combat those things with segmentation and IDS (intrusion detection\nsystems) or IPS (intrusion prevention systems), but once you create that\naccess into the environment, you\u2019re creating an avenue for attack.\u201d\n\nJason Oberg, founder and CTO of Cycuity, noted that security in general is\noften an afterthought, one made even less of a priority thanks to the\nfragmented nature of the component market. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a chiplet\narchitecture or you\u2019re licensing IP and building a chip, because everything is\nso fragmented, there are so many different stakeholders,\u201d he said. \u201cAt\ndifferent stages of that process people say, \u2018Here\u2019s the assumptions I made on\nsecurity. Here\u2019s what we validated. Here\u2019s what we expect you to do, Mr.\nconsumer of my chiplet, or IP, or chip, or whatever it may be. That provides\nthat transparency people know what to focus on. Unfortunately, right now a lot\nof the industry is like, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s a chip, here\u2019s the user manual, or\nhere\u2019s an IP, here\u2019s the user guide. Go build your system off of it.\u2019 There\u2019s\nnot a lot of good clarity in terms of what\u2019s been done for security.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s changed? In the past, many attacks were focused on software, because it\nwas remotely accessible. But using that as an entry point to the hardware\nallows hackers to gain control of the entire system, and potentially systems\nof systems. That, in turn, makes it more difficult for companies to regain\ncontrol of their servers. A good example of this is the rowhammer attack,\nwhich can cause a disturbance in rows of DRAM cells by accessing them faster\nthan the memory can respond, providing an opening for a hacker to take control\nof the memory and change the access privileges. Increased density, which is\nneeded to store more data, has been essential for improving processor\nperformance, but it also has exacerbated this weakness.\n\n\u201cChannel leakage is one area of concern, but rowhammer attacks are equally\nconcerning,\u201d said Lang Lin, principal product manager at Ansys. \u201cThey\u2019re\ngetting the benefit of coupling between the row with the neighbor. It\u2019s\nleaking out the data from the neighbor. Imagine if the neighbor stores some\ndata in one row. When you stress this row, you probably can see some pattern\nversus the data storing is zero. When stressing the system, there\u2019s some\npattern you can monitor from the response of the system. That\u2019s one of the\nways to attack the data.\u201d\n\nDecomposing SoCs into chiplets adds multiple attack surfaces. \u201cData center\nprocessors and SoCs are being built as disaggregated designs with chiplets,\u201d\nsaid Arif Khan, senior product marketing group director for design IP at\nCadence. \u201cThe security implications of chiplet-based manufacturing with\nprovenance need to be factored in. However, this is a one-time scenario as\nopposed to a dynamic run-time situation in data centers.\u201d\n\nThis is just one more concern to add to an ever-expanding list. \u201cProtection\nfor stored data, and data being transmitted, has been covered by various\nsecurity mechanisms since the early days of networking and internet\ndevelopment,\u201d said Khan. \u201cThe rise of cloud computing and data centers now\nbrings the need for \u2018confidential computing\u2019 to protect data as it is being\nprocessed. Confidential computing relies on trusted execution environments\n(TEEs). The TEE is a secure computing area that can execute code with a higher\nsecurity level and access sensitive data.\u201d\n\nIn general, data in motion almost always is more vulnerable than data at rest.\nThis is particularly true for data being transferred to a CPU, a GPU, or back\nto the memory array, and at the point of encryption/decryption. The good news\nis that while this all happens in very short time windows, it can raise an\nalert based on a predictable and measurable shift in the power profile.\n\n\u201cThe power consumption of the system is dramatically different,\u201d said Lin.\n\u201cThe delay of the operation is different. It is all data-dependent. And these\nthings can be actually measured in real-time by the aggressor. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m\njust dialing into the data center. I send a message with all zeros, measure\nthe delay. Then I send all ones and measure the delay. The delay is different.\nImagine that all hackers have a way to actually characterize this so-called\nspy channel, meaning that you\u2019re not directly probing the data for ones or\nzeros, but you\u2019re looking at the physical behaviors associated with this. This\nis a side-channel attack.\u201d\n\nIdentifying these patterns isn\u2019t free. It requires additional resources, such\nas dummy circuits for obfuscation, as well as the power needed to identify any\nunusual activity. That, in turn, adds to the initial price tag, the complexity\nof the initial design, and the overall power budget.\n\n\u201cThere are costs to secure a system,\u201d Lin said. \u201cIn order to make my motion\nnot leak the data, you probably have got to add some noise. You\u2019ve got to add\na lot of circuits around it so that some dummy circuit is always operating.\nThen, the way you measure the difference between sending different data is\noverwhelmed by the noise. This is one way to mask the leakage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only way, however. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot of companies who are\nselling a lot of parts in this space that are really doing a whole lot of\nthat,\u201d said Mike Borza, principal security technologist at Synopsys. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nlittle bit like the honeypot approach to internet firewalls, just putting an\nopen or seemingly open server out on the internet and seeing what it attracts.\nYou see if you can get some people to show up at your doorstep and start\ntrying to take it over. Most chips that are specified have a difficult time\nshoe-horning the functionality they do need in the chip without going to the\ntrouble of supplying a lot of extra functionality.\u201d\n\nDummy circuits are not the only line of defense. Lin pointed to various other\napproaches that can be implemented at the design level in order to prevent\noutside forces from reading a chip\u2019s activity.\n\n\u201cMost of the [defense tactics] are at the gate level, then patch to the system\nlevel where you start to have, let\u2019s say, one chip with countermeasures at the\nlogical level, but the others are not. Would that actually compromise the\nwhole system security? People would like to know that, and it could be a\nsystem-level countermeasure also there for, say, side channel leakage,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt could be electromagnetic leakage from the server chip, so maybe they\nwill put an EM shield on top of this chip so nothing can be measured. It is\nsimilar for power. You probably can put some sensor in to say, \u2018If I see some\ndata, let\u2019s show some pattern. Let\u2019s do something to stop doing anything.\u2019\nThat\u2019s at the system level. You don\u2019t do anything on the gate level, but it\u2019s\nonly monitoring the whole system. That you can do to a different level.\u201d\n\nOne key for maximizing security is the idea of separation. With many different\nclients having access to a data center, keeping their information from getting\ncrossed over is of paramount importance.\n\n\u201cIf you run an application for Customer One, you don\u2019t trust the other\napplication that you\u2019re running for Customer Two,\u201d said Rambus\u2019 Willemse. \u201cYou\nneed to separate those applications, separate the data. In today\u2019s\nenvironments, that\u2019s the base requirement that has been pushed by the users of\ndata centers, and that drives the security of the SoC. That starts with the\nroot of trust, which is the very first chip identity within the chip that\nneeds to be protected from the actual applications running on the chip. But\nalso, the keys that are derived from that are the keys that are generated\nduring the lifetime of the chip or during the real-time processing.\u201d\n\nOthers agree. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that chip vendors, software\nplatforms, OEMs, and CSPs can deploy and access standardized Root of Trust\nservices,\u201d said Chowdary Yanamadala, technology strategist at Arm. \u201cSecurity\nis complicated. You need the whole value chain to work together.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts have been touting the need for hardware security for nearly\ntwo decades, but until recently that has been considered an add-on for many\ndesigns. Concerns finally reached a critical stage at the end of the 2010s, as\nmore electronics were added into vehicles and medical devices, and more\ncompanies began using cloud-based services. This was accompanied by increased\npenalties for breaches in some regions, and stringent reporting requirements\nwith late fees.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, Arm noticed an opportunity to proactively improve the quality\nof chip security,\u201d Yanamadala said. \u201cIoT was in its early stages, and each\nchip vendor had varied and fragmented approaches to security. They also rarely\napproached an independent evaluation lab to check the robustness of their\nsecurity implementation. With devices increasing their connectivity and data\nbecoming more valuable \u2013 hackers were paying close attention, and governments\nwere considering what action to take to protect consumers. That\u2019s why in 2019,\nwe launched PSA Certified, to rally the ecosystem to be proactive with\nsecurity best practice and democratize device security through independent\nsecurity evaluation.\u201d\n\nStacks and stacks of vulnerabilities This is harder than it sounds. Every\nlevel of the networking protocol stack, every interconnect, and every access\npoint is a potential vulnerability. Assuming all of that can be bundled up\ntightly enough, the first step is making sure that the original key, and the\nkeys that are added for sessions, are generated and managed by an independent\nentity on the chip, and that they are not impacted by any of the other\nprocesses running on the chip. This effectively is an in-system air gap, and\nit\u2019s a necessary starting point for any security.\n\nFig. 1: NIST\u2019s approach to security. Source: NIST\n\n\u201cThe second part is an advisory or somebody that is coming from the outside\nand tries to come in or tries to monitor interfaces or basically anything\nthat\u2019s not related to the chip itself,\u201d Willemse explained \u201cAnd that comes\nwith additional requirements for secure communication. Originally, that was\nbetween data centers. There was communication security from rack-to-rack, and\nnowadays securing communication chip-to-chip must be done, so even PCI\ninterfaces are protected with security so that data that is transferred over\nthese interfaces is also secure.\u201d\n\nWillemse noted that Rambus has several layers of security it can physically\nbuild into a chip in order to guarantee as much separation as possible.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dedicated hardware module, which is separated from the main CPU, and\nhas its own sub-system that cannot be accessed directly. It runs its own\nproprietary firmware. Users can develop their own firmware inside, but it\u2019s\nnot exposed to the system. That\u2019s the core of the security of the system. If\nyou talk about physical protection, on top of the fact that there\u2019s a\ndedicated module on the chip, we also add contraction against side channel\nattacks.\u201d\n\nSiemens\u2019 Harrison said that some of the components added to chips specifically\nfor security have gotten so efficient at what they\u2019re measuring that they\ndon\u2019t do much to impact performance.\n\n\u201cWhat we have essentially is a collection of core functional monitors,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThese are small pieces of IP that typically are inserted in the design\nduring the overall initial design phase. They\u2019re relatively unobtrusive. They\ndon\u2019t impact performance, because they\u2019re passive monitors that are hanging\noff functional elements in the design. They may take up a little bit of area,\nand a little bit of power, so if you\u2019re looking for tradeoffs, they\u2019re in the\nareas where if you were to put thousands of these monitors on the chip, you\u2019re\ngoing to start to see a significant impact on area and power. But typically\nwhat our users are doing is being very targeted on where they put these\nmonitors to make sure that they catch all the critical areas in the design.\u201d\n\nSecurity is not static As technology evolves, so do the threats. Currently,\npeople working in data center security have an eye on artificial intelligence\nand the ways it may be used to crack into the facilities. But even more potent\nthreats are on the horizon.\n\n\u201cIf AI is used on large scale to attack a system, it will probably attack\nthose security mechanisms that are generally designed by the chip makers\nitself, or bought by companies like us, because there\u2019s no specification to do\nthe security. There is no specification to design how you protect your windows\nor your doors,\u201d said Willemse. \u201cThere is a lock with the key, but if you can\njust push it and open the door with a lock itself, it\u2019s not secure. There are\ncertain Zero Day attacks on CPUs that were discovered a couple of years ago,\nincluding Heartbleed. Those could be revealed more easily with AI because you\ncan put in a lot of data and attack scenarios at the same time in a device.\u201d\n\nBut for all the power that an AI-driven attack can have behind it, that could\npale as the full potential of quantum computing is realized. Developers\nalready are taking this into consideration, trying to build security into\nproducts that could still be in use by the time quantum-powered attacks are\nfeasible.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t protect your chip now, and it exists for five, six, or seven\nyears down the line, all of a sudden it\u2019s there. You need to be sure that\nyou\u2019re ready for it today,\u201d said Willemse. \u201cAnother concern that exists is\nthat quantum computing is expected to break key negotiations. So if you\ncapture data today, including the key negotiation, a quantum computer will be\nable to retrospectively extract the key and decrypt the data. Data that is now\ncommunicated, for which the key is exchanged with current protocols, can\nretrospectively be decrypted unless there is quantum-safe protection.\u201d\n\nWith all these concerns, the initial conception of a chip has become ever more\nimportant. Security must be factored in from the ground up, and EDA is a vital\npart of policing and monitoring data.\n\n\u201cChip companies have asked us to do something at the design stage, so they\ndon\u2019t have to wait for the silicon to be bad and find the loopholes,\u201d said\nAnsys\u2019 Lin. \u201cWe need to fix the security as soon as possible. It\u2019s a big\ntrend, one that the semiconductor chip companies have started to ask us about\nsolutions. Many of them started approaching us saying they need something to\nhelp their engineers, so the EDA industry is in an important position. We\nprobably need five years to have mature technology to do the simulation for\nsecurity. Another challenge is that the security problem is so broad. It\u2019s not\nlike power that is measured by watts. In security, there is supply chain\nsecurity, side channel leakage, fault injection, and counterfeiting, among\nother things, and in order to have EDA tools to handle these different\naspects, I think it\u2019ll take more than five years.\u201d\n\nConclusion Security is an ever-evolving concern when it comes to chip design,\nmanufacturing and implementation, particularly as data center use continues to\nexpand. While there are some very solid measures already in place that are\nconstantly being advanced, the AI boom is a huge opportunity for the industry,\nbut also a danger to those seeking to keep gigantic volumes of sensitive data\ntucked safely away. Quantum computing will move this war of attrition between\nsecurity experts and attackers into another level of complexity.\n\nAttackers will continue to grow in sophistication. Breaches will occur. But as\nSiemens\u2019 Lee put it, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about staying one step of the attackers,\nbut also about what you can learn from them. The challenge is always based on\nnot trying to stop every attack, but trying to make the ability to attack\nharder. There\u2019s always the next rotation, and at some point, an attacker will\nbe able to breach the system. That\u2019s where a number of users are employing\nmonitoring technology, and talking to us about the fact that it\u2019s not so much\nthe protection, but if there is an attack, whether we can provide all of the\nforensic data to do the analysis that led up to the attack.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading Security Becoming Core Part Of Chip Design \u2014 Finally Dealing\nwith cyberthreats is becoming an integral part of chip and system design, and\nfar more expensive and complex. Increased Automotive Data Use Raises Privacy,\nSecurity Concerns More valuable data is being generated by vehicles and\ncollected by a variety of companies.
