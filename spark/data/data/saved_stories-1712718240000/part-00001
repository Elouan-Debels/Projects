(Part 1)\n\nsarahconstantin.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nYou\u2019ve seen this picture before.\n\nSo, everybody knows what a neuron is, right? It\u2019s a cell in the nervous\nsystem, it \u201cfires\u201d by transmitting something electricity-like along the length\nof the axon, and that sends neurotransmitters across synapses to the next\nneurons, thus modulating the activity of those downstream neurons.\n\nSo far, so good. This is the high school biology picture. What\u2019s so mysterious\nhere?\n\nWell, I just glossed over some very vague things.\n\n  * The axon transmits \u201csomething electricity-ish\u201d. Well, what is it exactly?\n\n  * When one neuron fires, it \u201cmodulates\u201d (weasel word alert) the activity of downstream neurons. Well, what does it do to them exactly?\n\nWe care, once again, from the perspective of neurotech, because if we want to\nknow how different technologies will alter neuronal activity, we need to know\nhow that activity physically works.\n\nAs far as this post goes, I\u2019m mostly teaching myself \u2014 I\u2019m sticking to what\nseems to be uncontroversial consensus stuff, probably nothing new for any of\nyou who are actual neuroscientists.\n\n###\n\nThe Action Potential\n\nThe electricity-ish thing that travels along a neuron is an action potential.\n\nNormally, a neuron, like other cells, has a voltage across its cell membrane.\nThe outside is more electrically positive than the inside.\n\nVoltages in cells are determined by the concentrations of charged ions,\nchiefly sodium and potassium (both with a +1 positive charge). The lipids that\nmake up a cell membrane do not permit these ions to pass through, but certain\nembedded proteins, the ion channels, can selectively let through ions and even\n\u201cpump\u201d ions against their concentration gradient. One key ion pump found in\nneurons is the sodium-potassium pump, which pumps 3 sodium ions out of the\ncell and 2 potassium ions in. Since 2-3 = -1, the sodium-potassium pump keeps\nthe inside of the cell more negative than the outside.\n\nThis default state, the resting potential, for a neuron is about -70 mV.\n(Again, remember: more negative on the inside.)\n\nSo what happens when the neuron \u201cfires\u201d?\n\nIt comes down to changes in ion channels. There are many types of ion channels\nin neurons, but a well-studied example is the sodium ion channel.\n\nWhen sodium ion channels open, they let sodium ions into the cell, which make\nthe inside more positive. This is called depolarization \u2014 remember, the inside\nstarted out negative, so letting in a bunch of positive ions reduces the\nmembrane potential to zero and even overshoots, making it more positive inside\nthan outside.\n\nIn response, potassium ion channels open, letting potassium ions out of the\ncell, repolarizing it until it\u2019s once again more negative on the inside. This\nstage too has an overshoot \u2014 the membrane potential goes even more negative\nthan -70 mV and gradually returns back there.\n\nThe trick is, these ion channels are voltage-gated. If the depolarization is\nstrong enough, it triggers a positive feedback loop where more sodium ion\nchannels open, making the inside of the neuron even more positive, and opening\neven more sodium ion channels, and so on.\n\nThis is what happens when the neuron fires. Voltage-gated ion channels\nactivate nearby ion channels along the axon, causing a traveling \u201cpatch\u201d of\ndepolarization, which flares and is extinguished at each point in turn as the\npotassium ions come in and repolarize the cell.\n\nSo what\u2019s actually \u201ctraveling\u201d along the axon? A patch of positive electric\ncharge in a \u201cwire\u201d of mostly negative charge...so it is, in fact, a current.\n\nA very small current.\n\nTypically tens to hundreds of picoamperes \u2014 trillions of times less than the\n15-20 amperes that can be drawn from a typical household electrical outlet.\n\n###\n\nWhat Happens When You Zap A Neuron?\n\nElectrodes placed across the frog\u2019s legs, running a current through the\nmuscles, make the legs twitch into the bent position.\n\nThe oldest way to \u201cstimulate\u201d a neuron to fire is by running an electrical\ncurrent through it. This goes back to Galvani and his dead frogs in 1792.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that it works. But why does it work?\n\nBecause an externally applied electric current can start the depolarization\nprocess.\n\nIf you put a cathode (negatively charged) electrode somewhere around the\nneuron, it creates a localized electric field that attracts positive ions near\nit. Since there\u2019s now a high concentration of positive ions near the cell,\nthey flow down their concentration gradient across the cell membrane. This\nturns the inside of the cell less negative/more positive, causing\ndepolarization.1\n\nAnd, as we saw above, once you get a strong enough depolarization, the\npositive feedback of voltage-gated ion channels takes over and you get a\ntraveling action potential along the neuron.\n\nIf you put an anode (positively charged) electrode near the neuron, by\ncontrast, you\u2019ll get hyperpolarization, which will make it more difficult for\nthe neuron to fire.\n\nSo this mechanism tells us a few things about electrical neurostimulation.\n\nFirst of all, it can start a neuron firing from a dead stop.\n\nSecond of all, its effect depends entirely on the charge direction. Anodal and\ncathodal stimulation have opposite effects on the targeted neurons.2\n\nThird of all, its effect depends on the physical extent and intensity of the\nelectric field. We can predict that the neurons affected by electrical\nstimulation are going to be the neurons physically located near a sufficiently\nstrong electric charge.3\n\nMagnetic stimulation (eg transcranial magnetic stimulation) works exactly the\nsame way.\n\nIt uses induction to create an electric current. A magnetically-generated\nelectric current can depolarize or hyperpolarize nearby neurons based on the\nexact same mechanisms that an electrode-applied current can.\n\nIn the case of transcranial magnetic stimulation, the direction of current\nflowing in the coil determines the polarity of the magnetic field, which in\nturn determines the electric charge applied to the brain.\n\nIn practice, TMS is usually produced by alternating current, so the induced\nelectric field oscillates \u2014 it\u2019s not directly comparable to direct electrode\nstimulation with an anode or cathode.\n\nAnd the proposed mechanisms of action of TMS include not only direct effects\non a targeted neuron\u2019s membrane potential but indirect effects involving how\nneurons \u201cexcite\u201d and \u201cinhibit\u201d their post-synaptic neighbors, which we\u2019ll save\nfor a later post.\n\nBut basically, both magnetic and electrical stimulation of neurons work by\napplying an electric field near them, and electric fields can directly alter\nthe neuron\u2019s membrane potential, causing a neuron to fire if it depolarizes\nenough, or to not fire when it otherwise would if it hyperpolarizes enough.\n\nIn the next post I\u2019ll cover what happens to post-synaptic (downstream) neurons\nafter a neuron fires.\n\n1\n\nThis is all extracellular electrode stimulation, where the electrode is\noutside the neuron. It\u2019s also possible to directly inject current inside a\nneuron with much tinier (~1 micron) pipette filled with a wire and conduction\nsolution. But that\u2019s very technically difficult. It\u2019s not how Galvani did it,\nobviously, and the electrodes used in today\u2019s clinical contexts \u2014 deep brain\nstimulators, cochlear implants, brain-computer interfaces \u2014 are all\nextracellular electrodes.\n\n2\n\nWhat about alternating current? Well, then you can get the neuron to fire when\nthe charge is negative, and block it from firing when the charge is positive.\nYou can even entrain a rhythmic firing pattern in the neuron this way.\n\n3\n\nof course neuron type and other factors will also affect how much charge needs\nto be applied to get a neuron to fire, or stop firing. But \u201chow much charge is\nthere in the vicinity of this neuron\u201d is always relevant, afaik.\n\n### Subscribe to Rough Diamonds\n\nBy Sarah Constantin \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\nUnderrated opportunities in science, technology, and society\n\n3 Likes\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What Really Happens When A Neuron Fires?
