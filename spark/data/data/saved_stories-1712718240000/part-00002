To place this solar boom in context, the entire United States had\njust 40 GW of total cumulative installed solar capacity in 2016, according to\nSEIA.\n\nThe effect of solar on Texas\u2019 grid is starting to have tangible effects on the\ndaily supply of electricity, according to a report by the Energy Information\nAdministration (EIA). Solar, now often paired with flexible battery energy\nstorage, is helping serve seasonal and daily intermittent electricity demand,\nhelping to squeeze out natural gas plants.\n\n\u201cWith more solar capacity on the ERCOT electricity grid, we expect less use of\nnatural gas generation during the middle of the day when solar generation\ndisplaces it,\u201d said EIA. \u201cWe also expect less use of natural gas in the summer\nwhen electricity demand is at its highest in Texas.\u201d\n\nImage: EIA\n\nHowever, EIA expects natural gas to continue to play a role in the ERCOT grid.\nThe intermittent cycles of solar and wind generation lead to an evening\nmismatch of supply and demand, typically around the hours of 6:00 PM to 8:00\nPM. This mismatch is sometimes referred to as the \u201cduck curve,\u201d a phenomenon\nfamiliar to grid operators in California.\n\n\u201cAs solar power generation declines later in the afternoon, natural gas is\ndispatched to meet the electricity demand,\u201d said EIA. \u201cWind generation also\nincreases in the evening, limiting the need for additional generation from\nnatural gas or other dispatchable resources.\u201d\n\nEnergy storage is increasingly important in closing this supply and demand gap\nand negating the need for emissions-causing natural gas burning. Many energy\nstorage projects being deployed in Texas today range between one to four hours\nof duration, serving the use case of dispatching electricity when it is needed\nmost. Natural gas peak demand plants or \u201cpeaker\u201d plants are among the most\ninefficient uses of natural gas reserves. A study from Sandia National\nLaboratories explores this issue and how energy storage is expected to replace\nnatural gas peakers.\n\nThis is reflected in the capacity additions planned for ERCOT. EIA expects 13\nGW of battery storage capacity to be added between the time of this report and\n2025. Over the same period, 3 GW of natural gas additions are expected.\n\nSolar generation has increased significantly over a year for Texas. In winter\n2022-23 peak generation was 2.1 GWh, and in 2023-24, it reached 3.8 GWh, said\nEIA. Wind production remained relatively flat, though it remains a larger\nsource of electricity than solar on the ERCOT grid. In the summer of 2022, the\nmaximum hourly average solar generation was 3.9 GWh and increased to 5.3 GWh\nin the summer of 2023.\n\nImage: EIA\n\nSolar generation increased 35% year-over-year in the state, and 16 GW of solar\nwas added in 2023 alone. Developers are expected to add another 24 GW in 2024\nand 2025, while wind power is expected to increase by 3 GW of capacity.\n\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.
