Bitmovin\nhas especially focused on how AI can provide value for our customers,\nreleasing our AI Analytics Session Interpreter earlier this year and we\u2019re\nlooking closer at several other areas of the end-to-end video workflow.\n\nWe\u2019re very proud of how our encoder maintains the visual quality of the source\nfiles, while significantly reducing the amount of data used, but now we\u2019re\nexploring how we can actually improve on the quality of the source file for\nolder and standard definition content. Super Resolution implementations have\ncome a long way in the past few years and have the potential to give older\ncontent new life and make it look amazing on Ultra-High Definition screens.\nKeep reading to learn about Bitmovin\u2019s progress and results.\n\n## What is video Super Resolution and how does it work?\n\nSuper Resolution refers to the process of enhancing the quality or increasing\nthe resolution of an image or video beyond its original resolution. The\noriginal methods of upscaling images and video involved upsampling by using\nmathematical functions like bilinear and bicubic interpolation to predict new\ndata points in between sampled data points. Some techniques used multiple\nlower-resolution images or video frames to create a composite higher\nresolution image or frame. Now AI and machine learning (ML) based methods\ninvolve training deep neural networks (DNNs) with large libraries of low and\nhigh-resolution image pairs. The networks learn to map the differences between\nthe pairs, and after enough training they are able to accurately generate a\nhigh-resolution image from a lower-resolution one.\n\n## Bitmovin\u2019s AI video Super Resolution exploration and testing\n\nSuper Resolution upscaling is something that Bitmovin has been investigating\nand testing with customers for several years now. We published a 3-part deep\ndive back in 2020 that goes into detail about the principles behind Super\nResolution, how it can be incorporated into video workflows and the practical\napplications and results. We won\u2019t fully rehash those posts here, so check\nthem out if you\u2019re interested in the details. But one of the conclusions we\ncame to back then, was that Super Resolution was an especially well-suited\napplication for machine learning techniques. This is even more true now, as\nGPUs have gotten exponentially more powerful over the past 4 years, while\nbecoming more affordable and accessible as cloud resources.\n\nNvidia\u2019s GPU computation capabilities over the last 8 years \u2013 source: Nvidia\nGTC 2024 keynote\n\n### ATHENA Super Resolution research\n\nBitmovin\u2019s ATHENA research lab partner has also been looking into various AI\nvideo Super Resolution approaches. In a proposed method called DeepStream,\nthey demonstrated how a DNN enhancement-layer could be included with a stream\nto perform Super Resolution upscaling on playback devices with capable GPUs.\nThe results showed this method could save ~35% bitrate while delivering\nequivalent quality. See this link for more detail.\n\nOther Super Resolution techniques the ATHENA team has looked at involve\nupscaling on mobile devices that typically can\u2019t take advantage of DNNs due to\nlack of processing power and power consumption/battery concerns. Lightweight\nSuper Resolution networks specifically tailored for mobile devices like LiDeR\nand SR-ABR Net have shown positive early outcomes and performance.\n\n## AI-powered video enhancement with Bitmovin partner Pixop\n\nBitmovin partner Pixop specializes in AI and ML video enhancement and\nupscaling. They\u2019re also cloud native and fellow members of NVIDIA\u2019s Inception\nStartup Program. They offer several AI-powered services and filters including\nrestoration, Super Resolution upscaling, denoising, deinterlacing, film grain\nand frame rate conversion that automate tedious processes that used to be\npainstaking and time consuming. We\u2019ve found them to be very complementary to\nBitmovin\u2019s VOD Encoding and have begun trials with Bitmovin customers.\n\nOne application we\u2019re exploring is digital remastering of historic content.\nWe\u2019ve been able to take lower resolution, grainy and generally lower quality\ncontent (by today\u2019s standards) through Pixop\u2019s upscaling and restoration, with\npromising results. The encoded output was not only a higher resolution, but\nalso the application of cropping, graining and color correction resulted in a\nvisually more appealing result, allowing our customer to re-monetize their\naged content. The image below shows a side-by-side comparison of remastered\ncontent with finer details.\n\nSide-by-side comparison of AI remastered content\n\nInterested in giving your older content new life with the power of AI video\nSuper Resolution?
