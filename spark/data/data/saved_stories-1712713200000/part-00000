They\u2019re not totally to blame for\nthat, though\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare by email\n\n\u2716\n\nLogin required\n\nTamlin Magee\n\n19 Jul 2023\n\nAs the big economies of the West boomed after the second world war,\nadolescents in those countries, especially the US, gained significant spending\npower for the first time. This prompted businesses to create a whole new\nmarketing segment for them, putting the term \u2018teenager\u2019 into common usage. By\nthe 1970s, the generation gap had come into play: it was no longer about how\nold you were, but when you were born. Such slicing and dicing has since\nevolved into a system featuring several age categories, including the silent\ngeneration, post-war baby boomers, generation X and millennials. Today\u2019s\nteenagers and under-25s are known collectively as generation Z, while those\nborn since the early 2010s are classed as gen alpha.\n\nIf you type gen Z\u2019s other name, \u2018zoomers\u2019, into your favoured internet search\nengine, you\u2019ll find all sorts of claims about their characteristics, many of\nwhich are contradictory. They\u2019re political activists, yet they\u2019re nihilists.\nThey\u2019re into trends such as urban fishing, but they\u2019re also hard-nosed\ncapitalists. Apparently, they can\u2019t stand millennials, punctuation or the US.\n\n> We often talk about cybersecurity from a deep technical perspective, but\n> don\u2019t discuss its societal impact in a non-technical way\n\nWhether such sweeping generalisations could possibly hold true for the world\u2019s\n2 billion zoomers is beside the point. The one key factor that unifies them\nall is that they\u2019re the primordial internet-brained batch, the first that has\nonly ever known life with the net seeping into every pore, for better or for\nworse. For many, using a smartphone is as natural as drawing breath. They\nspend half of their waking lives on screen time, according to research\npublished by the Los Angeles Times last year.\n\nYet, for all their familiarity with the digital world, significant problems\nhave arisen for zoomers as they\u2019ve entered the workplace and been confronted\nby antediluvian hardware and software. Reports abound of gen Z\u2019s struggles\nwith (admittedly infuriating) tech such as office printers and spreadsheets.\n\nA general IT literacy gap may exist, then, but more worrying than a junior\nemployee\u2019s inability to work a scanner is the potential cybersecurity threat\nthis gap presents. A survey conducted last year by the National Cybersecurity\nAlliance made some surprising findings. It found that, despite their\nfamiliarity with the digital economy, 64% of zoomers did not rate\ncybersecurity as a high priority. They also reported a higher cybercrime\nvictimisation rate than other age groups and were most likely to take phishing\nbait.\n\nDuring the depths of the Covid crisis, younger employees also experienced more\nIT problems than their older colleagues while working remotely. According to a\nsurvey by Security magazine, 38% of zoomers were logging four or more tech-\nrelated issues a week on average in Q2 2020, compared with only 12% of\ncolleagues aged 45 to 54. They engage in riskier behaviour too: while they\nunderstand the need to change passwords regularly, they don\u2019t actually do so,\naccording to the World Economic Forum.\n\n## The psychology of cyber literacy\n\nGen Z\u2019s apparent lack of computer literacy and lax attitude to cybersecurity\nmay spell trouble for everyone. The digital economy has become even more\ninterlinked in nature since the Covid crisis, when millions of people were\nobliged to live more of their lives on the internet. Critical infrastructure,\nprivate health records, our personal data \u2013 it\u2019s all online. The recent\nupsurge in supply chain attacks shows that criminals need find only one\ndefensive weak link to cause widespread damage. Consider a hospital to which\nan employee accidentally introduces ransomware, effectively shutting down its\nvital systems \u2013 literally a matter of life and death.\n\nAll this seems a little mystifying, given that gen Z has widely been touted as\nthe most IT-savvy generation. But the \u2018digital native\u2019 badge is possibly an\nunhelpful one, according to Dr Elinor Carmi, lecturer in data politics and\nsocial justice at City, University of London. She observes that, while people\nare indeed becoming acquainted with online tech at a younger and younger age,\nthe range of applications they\u2019re using is actually quite limited.\n\n> If you have an individual who doesn\u2019t care much about their own data, what\n> attention are they going to pay to their organisation\u2019s data?\n\n\u201cWhen I ask my students what they mean when they say they\u2019re online, 99% say\nthey mean they\u2019re using TikTok,\u201d Carmi reports. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing only\none thing, that limits how you understand different types of options and\nwhat\u2019s available to you.\u201d\n\nResearchers at Royal Holloway, University of London, are studying the\ndisconnect between zoomers\u2019 comfort with digital tech and their risky\nbehaviour online. Some of the answers might lie in human biology, suggests\nProfessor Dawn Watling, director of the college\u2019s social development lab.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex, which helps us to make rational decisions and exercise\ncognitive control, is one of the last parts of the brain to mature, she says.\nBy contrast, the limbic system, which contains areas of the brain involved in\nreward and reinforcement \u2013 develops much sooner, so it may be more natural for\nyounger people to throw caution to the wind and open a dodgy email promising a\nhuge cash windfall.\n\nAt the same time, zoomers may have developed a sense of complacency that\nthey\u2019re less likely than older people to become victims of cybercrime simply\nbecause they\u2019ve grown up with digital tech.\n\n\u201cOn top of this overconfidence, there\u2019s been a lack of understanding about the\nconsequences,\u201d says Watling\u2019s colleague, Dr Konstantinos Mersinas, director of\nRoyal Holloway\u2019s distance learning programme in information security. \u201cThey\nmight say: \u2018OK, maybe my phone is hacked, but I\u2019ll survive.\u2019 Such an attitude\nis related to risk-seeking behaviour. If you have an individual who doesn\u2019t\ncare much about their own data, what attention are they are going to pay to\ntheir organisation\u2019s data?\u201d\n\n## Cybersecurity\u2019s image problem\n\nYet apathy is not the predominant attitude that Lisa Plaggemier, executive\ndirector of the National Cybersecurity Alliance, has detected during her\nconversations with zoomers. Rather, it\u2019s a prevailing sense of nihilism tied\nto their perceived lack of agency.\n\nContrary to what many people might think, zoomers are mistrustful of the tech\nindustry, according to research by marketing agency FleishmanHillard in 2020,\nyet many feel powerless against the might of big tech. Having grown up with\nthe internet and learnt of many high-profile data breaches, they feel that\n\u201cthe horse is out of the barn and there\u2019s not a lot they can do\u201d, Plaggemier\nsays. That\u2019s not actually true, she adds, but cybersecurity has such an image\nproblem that the effective defensive measures people could actually take are\noften ignored.\n\n> When I ask my students what they mean when they say they\u2019re online, 99% say\n> they mean they\u2019re using TikTok\n\nIf this situation persists, the cyber literacy gap is likely to become a\nchasm, where highly technical criminals target their constantly online victims\n\u2013 something that\u2019s already happening to a degree and becoming easier than ever\nfor attackers.\n\nA big problem here is the perception that effective cyber hygiene is an\nonerous chore. This needs to be tackled socially, starting at school,\naccording to Mark Brown, MD for digital trust at the British Standards\nInstitution (BSI).\n\n\u201cWe often talk about cybersecurity from a deep technical perspective, but what\nwe haven\u2019t discussed is its societal impact in a non-technical way,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhen we use solely technical terms, that puts people off. Our messaging has\nto change: we must cover the reality of personal outcomes and include real-\nlife examples.\u201d\n\n## Critical thinking is the foundation of cyber literacy\n\nCarmi suggests that one way to prepare young people better could be for\nschools to focus more on teaching critical thinking skills. She notes that,\nwhile data literacy is mentioned in the ongoing saga that is the UK\u2019s online\nsafety bill, regulators are understandably reluctant to take ownership of that\nproject.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something you can do really quickly, but governments prefer to think\nabout the moment rather than the future,\u201d Carmi says. \u201cWe need a future\nthinking programme for different demographic groups, who haven\u2019t learnt this\nin schools and universities. It needs to provide ongoing support, because\nthings learnt five years ago may not be relevant today. But some factors are\nnever going to change \u2013 teaching people how to cross-check sources is will\nstill be relevant in 10 years\u2019 time, for instance. Core skills such as\nassessing whether websites (or people) are legitimate or not are important.\u201d\n\n## How to build a culture that values cybersecurity\n\nThere are signs that some of tech\u2019s biggest players are starting to position\nfactors such as data privacy as a competitive differentiator. Apple\u2019s recent\nad featuring US comedian Jane Lynch, for instance, may go some way towards\naddressing security\u2019s image problem.\n\nMore could be done, though. If Plaggemier had one wish, it would be for\nbusinesses to use multi-factor authentication as the default, providing a\nmassive security boost overnight.\n\nBut finding a solution to the problem won\u2019t be simple. It will require a\nconcerted effort from government and the tech industry to communicate in clear\nterms why security is important. They must collaborate to explain the benefits\nof good cyber hygiene and provide ongoing support for users of all ages,\ntaking into account not only the technology but the psychology too.\n\nClearly, this issue cannot be attributed to some inherent generational\ndifference. There\u2019s strong evidence to suggest that the rest of us have let a\ngenerational cyber literacy gap widen too far. Where governments have run\nawareness campaigns, these have changed people\u2019s views and habits. Take the\nUAE, for example. One of the world\u2019s most digitally advanced economies has\nbucked the trend with a targeted public education programme and made\ncybersecurity a key concern among younger people.\n\nTraditional training will not work in this context and neither will sanctions,\naccording to Watling and Mersinas at Royal Holloway.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s too disruptive to people\u2019s work, they often seek an alternative way\nto do what they want to do,\u201d Watling argues. \u201cWe think it\u2019s crucial to think\nabout cybersecurity culture, how we explain things to people and how we\nsupport their own buy-in. It\u2019s important for training to happen, but we need\nto think more generally about what kind of cybersecurity culture we have.\u201d\n\nRisk & RegulationCybersecurity & Authentication 2023Cybersecurity\n\n## Read this next\n\nResponsible Business\n\nWhy fleet managers should not delay the transition to EVs\n\nTechnology\n\nBusinesses need to provide better cybersecurity training \u2013 here\u2019s how\n\nRisk & Regulation\n\nFive cybersecurity predictions for 2024\n\nRisk & Regulation\n\nDo businesses really need to worry about deepfakes?\n\nSupply Chain\n\nSupply chain fraud is on the rise \u2013 here\u2019s how to combat it\n\nInfographics\n\nWhy burnout is becoming a cybersecurity risk\n\n## Want to read on?\n\nSimply sign in or register to continue.
