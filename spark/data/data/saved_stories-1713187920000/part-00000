They\u2019d first encountered each other on a website called\nBlackPlanet.\n\nTo the 5-year-old, the answer seemed fantastical. \u201cHe clearly didn\u2019t hear\n\u2018website,\u2019 \u201d Williams, a writer and comic creator, told me. \u201cHe was like,\n\u2018Wait, you all met on Black Planet? Like, there\u2019s a planet that\u2019s full of\nBlack people? Why did you leave?!\u2019 \u201d\n\n## Explore the May 2024 Issue\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nView More\n\nWilliams had to explain that they\u2019d actually been right here on \u201cregular\nEarth.\u201d But in some ways, their son\u2019s wide-eyed response wasn\u2019t so off base:\nFrom the perspective of the 2020s, there is something otherworldly about the\nmid-aughts internet that brought his parents together. In a social-media era\ndominated by the provocation and vitriol of billionaire-owned mega-platforms,\nit can be hard to imagine a time when the concept of using the internet to\nconnect with people felt novel, full of possibility\u2014and when a site billed as\nthe homepage of the Black internet had millions of active users.\n\nBlackPlanet went live in 1999, nearly three years before Friendster, four\nyears before MySpace, five years before Facebook, and seven years before\nTwitter. In those early years, the internet was still seen by many as a giant\nlibrary\u2014a place where you went to find things out. Sure, the web had chat\nrooms, bulletin boards, and listservs. But BlackPlanet expanded what it meant\nto commune\u2014and express oneself\u2014online.\n\nThe site offered its users the opportunity to create profiles, join large\ngroup conversations about topics such as politics and pop culture, apply to\njobs, send instant messages, and, yes, even date. It provided a space for them\nto hone their voice and find their people. A visit to someone\u2019s customizable\nBlackPlanet page would probably tell you where they grew up, which musicians\nthey idolized, and what they looked like. \u201cThat now seems like the most\nobvious thing in the world,\u201d Omar Wasow, one of the site\u2019s co-founders, told\nme, \u201cbut at the time reflected a real break from the dominant ideas about how\nthis technology was meant to be used.\u201d\n\nBlackPlanet is often overlooked in mainstream coverage of social-media\nhistory. But at its peak, it wasn\u2019t just some niche forum. Despite skepticism\nwithin the tech industry that a social-networking site geared toward African\nAmericans could be successful, about 1 million users joined BlackPlanet within\na year of its launch. By 2008, it had about 15 million members. The site\u2019s\ncultural reach extended beyond what numbers can capture: BlackPlanet amplified\nthe work of emerging artists, served as a powerful voter-outreach hub for\nBarack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign, and fostered now-prominent voices\nin contemporary media. Gene Demby, a co-host of NPR\u2019s Code Switch podcast,\ntold me he joined BlackPlanet while attending a predominantly white college as\na way to make connections beyond his campus. \u201cIt was sort of like, \u2018Give me\nall the Black people I can find!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe site and its users helped establish visual-grammar and technical\nframeworks\u2014such as streaming songs on personal pages and live, one-on-one\nchatting\u2014that were later widely imitated. BlackPlanet arguably laid the\nfoundation for social media as we know it, including, of course, Black\nTwitter.\n\nNow, nearly 25 years after its launch, looking back at BlackPlanet\u2019s glory\ndays can be more than just an exercise in nostalgia. Today\u2019s social-media\nplatforms often seem designed to reward the worst in humanity, subjecting\ntheir users to rampant hate speech and misinformation. Perhaps by revisiting\nBlackPlanet and the story of its rise, we can start to envision a different\nfuture for the social web\u2014this time, one with the potential to be kinder, less\ndangerous, and more fun than what the past two decades have given us.\n\nOmar Wasow met Benjamin Sun in the late 1990s, when they were among the few\npeople of color working in New York City\u2019s tech scene. After graduating from\nStanford University in 1992, Wasow had moved back to his hometown and started\na hyperlocal community hub and internet-service provider, New York Online,\nwhich he operated out of his Brooklyn apartment. The service had only about\n1,000 users; Wasow made his actual living by building websites for magazines.\nSo he was excited when he met Sun, then the president and CEO of the social-\nnetworking firm Community Connect, which in 1997 launched an online forum for\nAsian Americans called AsianAvenue.\n\nWasow, the son of a Jewish economist and a Black American educator, had been\nthinking about how to build community on the internet for years. Like many\nearly tech enthusiasts, he frequented the bulletin-board systems (BBSes) that\nproliferated in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s. Spending time on those primarily\ntext-based, hobbyist-run dial-up services helped him anticipate how popular\nsocial technologies could be. Many of the BBSes were standard tech-nerd\nfare\u2014chats where users would discuss pirating software or gossip about buzzy\nnew product releases. But two sites in particular, ECHO (East Coast Hang Out)\nand the WELL (Whole Earth \u2019Lectronic Link), modeled a more salonlike online\nexperience that piqued Wasow\u2019s interest. He realized that people didn\u2019t\nnecessarily want the internet to be just an information superhighway. They\nwanted connection; they wanted to socialize.\n\nFrom the October 2021 issue: Hannah Giorgis on the unwritten rules of Black TV\n\nWasow admired the cultural cachet that AsianAvenue had already amassed\u2014enough,\nby 1999, to compel Skyy Spirits to discontinue a print ad for vodka that\nfeatured a racist image of an Asian woman after the site\u2019s users protested.\nSun, for his part, wanted to expand Community Connect to new forums for other\npeople of color. They decided to work together to build a new site that would\nallow users to participate in forum-style group discussions, create personal\nprofile pages, and communicate one-on-one.\n\nBut Wasow, Sun, and the rest of the Community Connect team faced a major\nchallenge in launching BlackPlanet: the perception that Black people simply\ndidn\u2019t use the internet. It was true, around the turn of the millennium, that\nwhite households were significantly more likely to have internet access than\nBlack ones. At the same time, reports of this \u201cdigital divide\u201d had helped\nfoster a myth of what the media historian Anna Everett has termed \u201cBlack\ntechnophobia.\u201d Well into the aughts, much of the coverage of Black American\ntech usage had a tone of incredulity or outright condescension. As a result,\nadvertisers and investors were hesitant to back Wasow and Sun\u2019s site. Would it\nreally attract enough users to be viable?\n\nLess than two years into its run, BlackPlanet had more than 2.5 million\nregistered users.\n\nWasow felt confident that it would. The very first week it went live, in\nSeptember 1999, a friend teased Wasow about the ticker on BlackPlanet\u2019s\nhomepage, which showed how many people were logged on at any given moment: \u201cI\nlogged in, and it said there were, like, 15 people online,\u201d Wasow remembered\nhim saying. \u201cYou sure you want to leave that up? Because it sort of feels like\nan empty dance floor.\u201d By the next week, the ticker showed closer to 150\npeople. Every day, the number climbed higher.\n\nWithin a few months, BlackPlanet had so many users that they couldn\u2019t possibly\nhave squeezed onto any dance floor in New York City. Wasow began to spend much\nof his time speaking at marketing conferences and advertising events. Still,\nhe and Sun struggled to attract significant capital. \u201cEven as the site was\nshowing real evidence of just incredible numbers, people had this story that\nwas like, in some ways, \u2018That couldn\u2019t be!\u2019 \u201d Wasow recalled. \u201cBecause the\ndigital divide was the narrative in their heads ... It wasn\u2019t enough just to\nshow success. We had to be insanely successful.\u201d\n\nBy May 2001, less than two years into its run, BlackPlanet had more than 2.5\nmillion registered users. Wasow himself had taught Oprah Winfrey and Gayle\nKing how to surf the Net on national television (after learning how to use a\nmouse, the women responded on air to emails from Diane Sawyer, Hillary\nClinton, and Bill Gates). BlackPlanet had secured advertising deals with the\nlikes of Hewlett-Packard, Time magazine, and Microsoft. In the last quarter of\n2002, BlackPlanet recorded its first profit. (Facebook, by contrast, did not\nturn a profit until 2009, five years after its launch, and Twitter didn\u2019t\nuntil 2017, 11 years after its founding.) By then, it was the most popular\nBlack-oriented website in America.\n\nWasow never forgot one seemingly trivial detail from BlackPlanet\u2019s fledgling\ndays. When the site went live, \u201cthe first person who logged in was\n\u2018TastyTanya,\u2019 \u201d he said, laughing. \u201cFor whatever reason, it\u2019s now more than 20\nyears later and I still remember that screen name.\u201d\n\nI tracked down the woman once known as TastyTanya, who was 20 when she joined\nthe site. Today, she\u2019s a married mother of two young children who works in\naccounting; she prefers not to have her real name attached to her old handle.\nWhen we spoke, she recounted how strangers on the site would strike up\nconversations with her because someone called TastyTanya just seemed\napproachable. One man she met on the site even emblazoned her BlackPlanet\nprofile picture onto a CD he burned for her and sent her in the mail, which\ndidn\u2019t seem creepy at the time. As quaint as that might sound now,\nTastyTanya\u2019s experience perfectly illustrates what made BlackPlanet so fun. In\nits heyday, the site was largely populated by users just like her, people in\ntheir teens and 20s who were doing online what people in their teens and 20s\nhave always done: figuring out who they want to be, expressing their feelings,\nand, of course, flirting.\n\nFrom the May 2024 issue: Hannah Giorgis on LaToya Ruby Frazier\u2019s intimate,\nintergenerational portraits\n\nLike many early users, Shanita Hubbard came to BlackPlanet in the early 2000s\nas a college student, eager to take advantage of the dial-up internet in her\ndorm room. A member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority at a historically Black\ncollege in South Carolina, Hubbard had heard about a cool-sounding site that\nwould help her meet Zetas on other campuses. She chose the screen name\nNaturalBeauty79 and peppered her profile with references to her sorority,\nnatural hair, and the music she loved. BlackPlanet soon became a fixture of\nher undergraduate experience.\n\nHubbard is now a freelance journalist and the author of Ride or Die: A\nFeminist Manifesto for the Well-Being of Black Women. When I asked her how\nshe\u2019d describe those days on BlackPlanet to a hypothetical Gen Zer, she\nlaughed: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m trying to explain a rotary phone.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, she told me, it was her first experience understanding how\ntechnology could broaden her universe not just intellectually, but socially.\nOn BlackPlanet, Hubbard befriended Black people from all walks of life,\nincluding Zetas as far away as California. \u201cWhat we think Black Twitter is\ntoday is actually what BlackPlanet was eons ago in terms of connecting and\nbuilding authentic community,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cExcept there was levels of\nprotection within BlackPlanet that we never got on Twitter.\u201d\n\nFrank Dorrey\n\nSome of the insulation was a product of the site\u2019s scale and user makeup:\nBlackPlanet was both smaller and more racially homogeneous than today\u2019s major\nsocial-media networks. Its infrastructure played a role too. Users could see\nwho else was online or recently active, send private messages, and sign one\nanother\u2019s digital \u201cguest book,\u201d but group discussions of contentious topics\ntended to happen within specific forums dedicated to those issues, not on a\ncentralized feed where bad-faith actors would be likely to jockey for the\npublic\u2019s attention. There was no obvious equivalent to the \u201cRetweet\u201d button,\nno feature that encouraged users to chase virality over dialogue.\n\nBlackPlanet users talked candidly about politics, debated sports, and engaged\nin conversations about what it meant to be Black across the diaspora. A 2008\nstudy found that the \u201cHeritage and Identity\u201d forum on BlackPlanet (as well as\nits equivalents on AsianAvenue and another sister site, MiGente), where users\nstarted threads such as \u201cI\u2019m Black and I Voted for Bush,\u201d consistently\nattracted the highest engagement rate. The conversation wasn\u2019t always\nfriendly, but it was rarely hostile in the ways that many Black social-media\nusers now take for granted as part of our digital lives. \u201cThere was never a\ntime ... where racists found us on BlackPlanet and infiltrated our sorority\nparties or flooded our little BlackPlanet pages with racist nonsense,\u201d Hubbard\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the white gaze was just not even a factor for us.\u201d\n\nEventually, Hubbard began using the site for more than friendly banter.\n\u201cEveryone likes to pretend it was all about formulating a digital family\nreunion,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s true. But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, when online-dating services such as eHarmony were still in their\ninfancy, BlackPlanet launched a dating service that cost $19.99 a month and\nhelped members screen their would-be love interests. The site offered its\nmembers something that is still rare in online romance: Everyone who signed up\nfor BlackPlanet\u2019s dating service wanted to be paired with other Black people.\n\nSoon enough, BlackPlanet romances were referenced in hip-hop lyrics and on\nother message boards, becoming a kind of shorthand for casual dating among\nyoung people. As Hubbard put it, BlackPlanet was \u201cTinder before there was\nswiping right, honey.\u201d\n\nIf you wanted your BlackPlanet page to look fly\u2014and of course you did\u2014you had\nto learn how to change the background colors, add music, and incorporate\nflashing GIFs. At the height of the site\u2019s popularity, the competition led\nsome users to protect their pages by disabling the right-click function that\nallowed others to access their HTML codes. Giving users the opportunity to\ndigitally render themselves made the site feel less like a staid old-school\nforum and more like a video game. That\u2019s how BlackPlanet sneakily taught a\ngeneration of Black internet users basic coding skills, an accomplishment that\nremains among Wasow\u2019s proudest.\n\nEvery former BlackPlanet user I spoke with for this story recalled doing at\nleast a little coding, though most didn\u2019t know to call it that at the time.\nSome told me they continued building those skills and went on to work in tech\nor media, at companies such as Meta and Slate. For others, though, learning\nHTML was just a way to express personal style. \u201cWe were our own webmaster, our\nown designer, our own developer,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cWe were maintaining it and\nthen we would switch it up every couple of weeks to keep it fresh and\npoppin\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just BlackPlanet users who took note of how much fun customizing\none\u2019s own webpage could be. In late 2002, a man named Tom Anderson decided\nthat he and his business partner should start a new social network.\n\n\u201cBlackPlanet was both ahead of its time and unfortunately not far enough ahead\nof its time.\u201d\n\nWhen MySpace launched in 2003, the site included several features that were\nsimilar to the ones BlackPlanet had offered for years. But where BlackPlanet\nand the other Community Connect sites emphasized the value of shared heritage\nand experiences, MySpace billed itself as the universal social network. \u201cI had\nlooked at dating sites and niche communities like BlackPlanet, AsianAvenue,\nand MiGente, as well as Friendster,\u201d Anderson told Fortune in 2006 (by then,\nhe was better known as \u201cMySpace Tom\u201d). \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018They\u2019re thinking way\ntoo small.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMySpace didn\u2019t immediately cut into BlackPlanet\u2019s user base. It would take at\nleast five years and the advent of three more major social networks before\nBlackPlanet saw a significant downturn in its numbers. Even as late as October\n2007, when then\u2013presidential candidate Obama joined BlackPlanet, he quickly\nacquired a large following.\n\nStill, as time went on, some BlackPlanet users found themselves visiting the\nsite less frequently. Mikki Kendall, a cultural commentator and the author of\nHood Feminism: Notes From the Women That a Movement Forgot, told me she didn\u2019t\nspend as much time on BlackPlanet as some of her friends did in part because\nshe thought of it primarily as a meeting space for singles. Also, its\ninterface didn\u2019t appeal to her. \u201cBlackPlanet was both ahead of its time and\nunfortunately not far enough ahead of its time,\u201d she said. The site was full\nof delays, and the mobile option seemed all but unusable. \u201cI always felt like\nit was the bootleg social-media network, even though it wasn\u2019t,\u201d she added.\n\u201cBut it was run like somebody was in the back with a hammer just knocking\nthings together and hoping it came through.\u201d\n\nSome observers I spoke with attributed BlackPlanet\u2019s decline partly to the\ndifficulty its founders had attracting capital. Wasow remembered Community\nConnect bringing in a total of $22 million by 2004. In 2007, Facebook received\n$240 million in investment funds just from Microsoft. \u201cWhat does it take\nfinancially to get Facebook to where it is? How much money?\u201d Charlton\nMcIlwain, a professor at NYU and the author of Black Software: The Internet &\nRacial Justice, From the AfroNet to Black Lives Matter, told me. How far into\n\u201cthe millions and into the billions of dollars has it taken for a Google to\nexperiment and succeed at some things and fail at a lot of things, but then be\na dominant player in that ecosystem?\u201d Black American culture has always been a\npowerful engine of innovation, but this has too rarely translated into actual\nfinancial rewards for Black people.\n\nIn 2008, three years after Wasow left BlackPlanet to attend graduate school at\nHarvard, the Maryland-based urban-media network Radio One (now Urban One)\npurchased Community Connect for $38 million. At the time, BlackPlanet still\nhad about 15 million users. But with Twitter slowly gaining attention outside\nSilicon Valley and Facebook beginning to overshadow MySpace, BlackPlanet\nsimply didn\u2019t have the resources to continue attracting the same mass of users\nthat it once had. The rise of these social-media giants\u2014and the industry-wide\nshift to prioritizing mobile experiences\u2014decimated BlackPlanet\u2019s numbers in\nthe years after it was acquired.\n\nStill, the site held on. In February 2019, BlackPlanet got a notable boost.\nThat month, Solange Knowles released the visuals for When I Get Home, her\nfourth studio album, exclusively on the site. The project arose after Solange\ntweeted about wanting to release a project on BlackPlanet and caught the\nattention of Lula Dualeh, a political and digital strategist who had just\nstarted in a new role there.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were asking themselves the question What\u2019s next outside of\nFacebook and Twitter and Instagram? \u201d Dualeh told me. Maybe the answer could\nbe a return to BlackPlanet. In the days following the rollout of the When I\nGet Home visuals\u2014a collection of art and music videos\u2014BlackPlanet saw more\ntraffic than it had in about a decade, as old and new visitors alike flocked\nto the site. Black Twitter was abuzz. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realize is that there was\njust this underbelly of nostalgia around BlackPlanet,\u201d Dualeh said.\n\nDespite the success of the Solange rollout, BlackPlanet hasn\u2019t seen a\nsignificant, lasting bump in numbers. Nostalgia alone won\u2019t be enough to keep\nusers engaged\u2014no matter how much worse Twitter (now X) has gotten. The\nBlackPlanet interface feels dated, with an early-2010s-Facebook quality to it,\neven as the posts crawling across the main feed reference music or events from\n2024. Alfred Liggins, Urban One\u2019s CEO, acknowledges that there\u2019s work to be\ndone on the technical side. But he argues that the site is still relevant. And\nalthough today\u2019s BlackPlanet does often seem like a repository for WhatsApp\nmemes, YouTube links, and conversation prompts copied over from other\nplatforms, some users do continue to use it to share photos and reflections\nfrom their real life.\n\nIn the current internet landscape, talk of eliminating hostility from large,\nmultiracial platforms feels idealistic at best\u2014particularly when those\nplatforms are owned by egotistical billionaires such as Elon Musk, who has\nused Twitter to endorse racist claims and alienate parts of its user base.\nStill, there\u2019s reason to hope that we may be entering a new era of social\nnetworking that prioritizes real connection over conflict-fueled engagement.\nSeveral new microblogging platforms have launched in recent years. Spill, a\nBlack-owned Twitter alternative co-founded by two of the app\u2019s former\nemployees, joins networks such as Mastodon and Bluesky in offering users a\nspace that isn\u2019t subject to the whims of provocateurs like Musk.\n\nWasow, for his part, is cautiously optimistic. The emergence of smaller, more\ndedicated digital spaces, he said, could \u201ctake us back to some of that\nthriving, \u2018Let a thousand flowers bloom\u2019 version of online community.\u201d It\u2019s\nnot that he expects people to stop using the huge social networks, Wasow said,\njust that he can see a world where they log on to Facebook and Snapchat and\nInstagram less.\n\nThe emergence of these new outlets also serves as a useful reminder: The\nsocial web can take many forms, and bigger is not always better. The thrill of\nthe early internet derived, in part, from the specificity of its meeting\nplaces and the possibility they offered of finding like-minded people even\nacross great distances (or of learning from people whose differing\nperspectives might broaden your own). Not everyone is lucky enough to meet a\nfuture spouse on their web planet of choice. But the rest of us still have the\ncapacity to be transformed for the better by the online worlds we inhabit.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2024 print edition with the headline \u201cBefore\nFacebook, There Was BlackPlanet.\u201d When you buy a book using a link on this\npage, we receive a commission.
