Instead, the effective causal model is to\napproximate to what extent each atom is interacting with every other atom. If\nwe increase the temperature, then the number of atoms each atom interacts with\nshould increase. As the temperature decreases, the number of atoms each atom\ninteracts with should decrease.\n\nIf we were to randomly sample any atom, then on average, the atom should\ninteract with a set of atoms of a certain size. Instead of thinking in terms\nof conditional probabilities and causal implications, we think in terms of\nsets of interconnected events. And this is because it is not computationally\neffective to analyze chaotic systems in a linear manner.\n\nWe can apply the same line of reasoning to sampling. If a system has a\nparticular sampling rate, the inputs to the system are batched according to\nthe sampling rate. In other words, the system cannot discern the ordering of\nevents within a single sample, only between samples. The coupling of events\n(according to a sampling rate) is not done for computational efficiency, but\nit is a quality of the system.\n\nIt is strange that the predominant way to reason about causality is through\natomic implications, such as p implies q. If we lower the temperature of a\nchaotic system such that each atom only interacts with one other element, have\nwe not achieved the same thing, just without identity? Or if we increase the\nsampling rate of a system such that every event can be represented as an\natomic sample, have we not achieved the same thing?\n\nIt seems causality is a consequence of two systems having different levels of\nentropy, or two systems having different sampling rates, because it is the\ndifference in entropy or sampling rate that allows a pattern to be captured.\nIf two systems have the same level of entropy, then neither can introspect the\nother because they look the same to each other. Likewise, if two systems have\nthe same sampling rate, neither can decode the ordering of events within a\nsample. But if two systems have two different levels of entropy, then the one\nthat has less entropy will look more ordered to the one that has more.\nLikewise, if two systems have two different sampling rates, then the one that\nhas a higher sampling rate will look more ordered to the one that has a lower\nsampling rate. And a causal model of the events that are either interactively\nconnected (due to entropy) or batched (due to sampling) can be constructed due\nto the difference.\n\n  * Get link\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Other Apps\n\n  * Get link\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Other Apps\n\n### Comments\n\n#### Post a Comment\n\n### Popular posts from this blog\n\n### Emergent Replication and the Fractal Computer\n\nMay 31, 2022\n\n  * Get link\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Other Apps\n\nPost a Comment\n\nRead more\n\n### Computation and Morality\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\n  * Get link\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Other Apps\n\nPost a Comment\n\nRead more\n\n### Concepts and universal structure\n\nAugust 30, 2023\n\nEvery political and philosophical theory is only as useful as the number of\nvariables the theory takes into account. In some way, every political and\nphilosophical theory can be said to have a certain amount of predictive power,\na certain illuminating factor. Every school of thought can be seen as an\nattempt to define a boundary between that which is inside and that which is\noutside. Some political theories focus on the divide between the citizen and\nthe state. Some philosophical theories focus on the divide between thought and\nmatter. And this divide could be metaphorically interpreted as a grammar which\nallows causal associations: as a way to understand the changing relationship\nbetween the inside and the outside. The growth of every theory requires\nexperimentation. And experimentation requires that one side of the coin is\nheld constant, either the inside or the outside. The boundary between the\ninside and outside is refined through experimentation.
