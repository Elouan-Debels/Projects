March consumer\ninflation out Wednesday shows them up 22% compared to last year. Since the end\nof 2019 \u2014 just before Covid hit \u2014 they\u2019re up 45%.\n\nWhy? That\u2019s where things get complicated.\n\nIn a prophylactic press release released Wednesday morning, an insurance\nindustry trade group cited \u201cgreatly increased the cost of repairing and\nreplacing cars\u201d due to inflation. As anyone who has shopped for a new or used\ncar over the last couple years can tell you, costs have gone up. That goes for\nthe costs of replacing minor parts like bumpers or mirrors as well.\n\nInsurers lost a lot of money on those replacement costs in 2021 and 2022, and\nare now trying to make that money back by raising rates a lot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThen there\u2019s also the the objectively atrocious driving record of Americans.\nEven before the pandemic, Americans were awful drivers compared to other high\nincome countries, with auto death rates the highest among peer nations. High\naccident rates are reflected in higher costs of insurance.\n\nAnd of course there\u2019s also the old-fashioned profit motive. Insurers are\ntrying to make money and raising rates is the way to do it.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to pursue rate increases to restore profitability in states\nthat are not yet at target margins,\u201d Jesse Merten, chief financial officer at\nAllstate told an investor conference in early March. \u201cAnd in other states,\nwe'll take rate to keep pace with increases in loss costs.\u201d\n\nWall Street seems pretty confident profits are on the way. Share prices of\nmajor auto insurers such as Allstate and Progressive, are hovering near all-\ntime highs, and are handily outpacing the market this year, rising about 21%\nand 29%, compared to the 8% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### More Markets\n\nSee all Markets\n\n## Mortgage rates jump after price data\n\n7.34%\n\nConsumers can\u2019t get a break lately.\n\nMatt Phillips10m\n\nJack Raines\n\nThe call of destiny\n\n1h\n\nRetail investors want private stocks\n\nWhy are investors vastly overpaying to own shares of Destiny?\n\nJack Raines\n\n3h\n\n## Fitch goes negative on China\n\nFitch cut its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating to negative, four\nmonths after Moody's made a similar move, as the country's economy has become\nmore and more dependent on government debt in the absence of private sector\ngrowth.\n\nFor context, Fitch sees China's explicit central and local government debt\nrising to 61.3% of GDP in 2024, up from 38.5% in 2019. The country's total\ndebt to GDP sits at a staggering 287%.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has used debt financing to fund aggressive\ninfrastructure and real estate projects around the country. However, the\ncountry has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, with GDP growth still\nbelow 2019 levels, and earlier this year, Beijing ordered indebted local\ngovernments to halt some state-funded infrastructure projects.\n\n### Fitch cuts China's ratings outlook on growth risks\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has used debt financing to fund aggressive\ninfrastructure and real estate projects around the country.
