This\nproject was inspired by Steve Losh' Learn Vimscript the Hard Way. I thought it\nwould be neat to do a broader, albeit less deep, overview of Vim + Vimscript\nin 2024. So here it is!\n\nThis guide consists of three parts:\n\n  * How to use Vim\n  * How to customize Vim\n  * How to use Vimscript\n\nIf you're an advanced user already, I would encourage you to read this guide\nfrom start to finish anyway, because you will learn something new. Let's get\nstarted!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
