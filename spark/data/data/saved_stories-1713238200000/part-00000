Accordingly, there is a\ngeneral consensus on the fact that the anchors deposited at Eastern\nMediterranean Bronze Age temples were important carriers of meaning for\nseafaring groups. Nevertheless, little effort has been made to understand the\nrole of anchors in the conceptual world of the ancient seafarers beyond the\nfact that they were powerful symbols of maritimity. Borrowed and adapted from\nlinguistics, Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) provides the theoretical\nframework to use material culture as a source for the investigation of ancient\nthought processes. In this paper, I apply the perspective of CBT to the\nanchors found at the Late Cypriot sanctuary of Kition-Kathari, with\ncomparisons to those from Byblos and Ugarit, and I examine the cognitive\nimplications of anchors as material metaphors and investigate how they embody\nthe blending of the mental spaces of the sacred, the city, and the sea.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Over There: The Mediterranean Surface and the Archetype of the Island as\nContemporary Paradigms for Accessing Cultural Commons\n\nChapter \u00a9 2020\n\n### Instruments of Acquisition and Reflections of Desire: English Nautical\nCharts and Islamic Shores, 1650\u20131700\n\nChapter \u00a9 2019\n\n### Cultural Frames: Sociocultural Metaphors in Owerri-Igbo Bongo Music\n\nChapter \u00a9 2022\n\nUse our pre-submission checklist\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## Introduction\n\nOne of the most salient classes of material culture that stands for Bronze Age\nseafaring in the Mediterranean is constituted by stone anchors. Despite the\nongoing debate concerning their typology, there are over a thousand stone\nartefacts that fall within the category of anchors (Warburton, 2020, p. 195).\nThese objects, first identified as anchors by Honor Frost in the 1960s (Frost,\n1963), are dressed stones, roughly triangular or trapezoidal, with one rope\nhole at the top and, in the so-called composite anchors, two additional stock\nholes at the bottom corners (Fig. 1). Both McCaslin (1980, pp. 18\u201320) and\nFrost (1991, p. 367) hypothesized that the weight anchors (single-hole) would\nhave served to moor a craft on a rocky seabed, while the composite ones,\nequipped with wooden stock-arms, would have had a better grip on sandy\nbottoms. The stocks, however, would have gotten easily stuck on rocky crevices\nmaking this second type less useful on uneven seafloors (cf. T\u00f3th, 2002, p.\n85). While McCaslin\u2019s and Frost\u2019s theory is sensible, both types of anchors\nhave, in fact, been found in either seafloor context, suggesting a use\ndictated by opportunism: in the end, in case of emergency, any heavy weight\ntied to a rope would have been better than nothing. While it is possible that\na Late Bronze Age seafaring ship would have carried a complement composed of\nboth types of anchors to perform better on different types of seabeds, this\nwas not necessary the case. For instance, all of the 24 stone anchors found on\nboard the Uluburun shipwreck were of the single-hole type (Pulak, 2008),\nimplying that the choice of anchors a ship carried depended on a variety of\nfactors that are difficult to reconstruct. The type of stones used and their\nsize is widely diverse, from well over a ton to just a few kilograms,\ncorresponding to their employment on board crafts of different sizes,\npurposes, and travelling on different routes.\n\nFig. 1\n\nComposite anchor. Drawing by K. Yamasaki after Wachsmann, 1998, Fig. 12.44,\nreproduced with permission\n\nFull size image\n\nRegardless of their diversity, all anchors were, and still are, a fundamental\npiece of equipment on any ship that keeps the vessel from drifting away at the\nmercy of waves and currents and stabilizes in bad weather. On ancient\nMediterranean seafaring ships, which were unable to sail against the wind, the\nrole of the anchors was even more crucial: the change of wind direction in the\ncourse of the day obliged the ships to drop anchor\u2014often on dangerous\nshallows\u2014and wait for the turn of the wind (Frost, 1982, p. 161, 1985, p. 281;\nSafadi, 2016, pp. 354\u2013356).\n\nAmong seafaring communities, it thus is unsurprising that anchors were equated\nwith navigation also in a symbolic sense. As Frost (1982, p. 161) wrote: \u2018when\na ship is in distress, storm-tossed towards shore, only the hold of her\nanchors can save her from destruction and her crew from death by drowning. It\nis therefore small wonder that anchors retain symbolic significance\u2019. And this\nsignificance is not limited to the area of navigation, but extends to a\nmultitude of other domains. In the Bible, the anchor is a metaphor of hope\n(Heb. 6:19), and a quick search on the web shows hundreds of results related\nto anchor symbolism. In the Bronze Age, their symbolic importance beyond the\nconfines of the ship is well testified by the conspicuous presence of votive\nanchors at various temples and sanctuaries along the Eastern Mediterranean\ncoast, where they embody the connection between the maritime community and the\ndivine.\n\nThis deep symbolic entanglement between maritimity and the divine that is\nmanifested through the anchors has been highlighted by several scholars,\nparticularly by Honor Frost (1969, p. 425; 1991, p. 367), who pioneered\nresearch on stone anchors, and, more recently, by Aaron Brody (1998, 2008,\n2023) with his work on the ancient Levantine seafarers\u2019 religion, and Valeria\nTito (2018), who focused on stone anchors within the framework of\nMediterranean aniconic cults. However, there has been no concrete attempt to\naddress the conceptual meaning of these objects and how they functioned as\nmaterial pivots to connect the dimensions of seafaring, maritime community and\nsacred. To this end, I adapt the theoretical framework offered by cognitive\nlinguistics to the study votive stone anchors.\n\nCognitive Metaphor Theory (CMT) and Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT), albeit\nin slightly different ways, offer the tools to map the cognitive processes\nthat underlie this network of relationships. A network that culminates with\nthe anchors being imbued with such communicative power to become the merging\npoint of the dimensions of maritimity, sacredness, and of all their cognitive\nassociations. CMT is based on the identification of a source and a target\ndomain in the mapping of cognitive metaphors: it maintains that a metaphor\nentails the understanding of a new concept based on the previous knowledge of\nanother concept. Source and target domains are well suited to the analysis of\nlinguistic metaphors, but have some limitations when trying to approach\nmaterial metaphors, such as votive stone anchors. In fact, CMT does not\ncontemplate the interaction of more than two domains, and does so in a mostly\none-directional way (i.e. source target). CBT theory expands on the idea of\nmapping a concept in function of another but admits the possibility of multi-\ndirectional blending of multiple sources. Said sources have their foundation\nin the human experience, which includes materiality as well as language and\ncultural knowledge (Fauconnier & Turner, 2003). This makes CBT more easily\nadaptable to the study of archaeological contexts.\n\nIn the following section, I propose an application of CBT to votive stone\nanchors from sanctuaries in Cyprus and the Levant. I begin with a concise\nreview of the main features of this class of objects, especially in relation\nto stone anchors from mundane contexts. Far from being a summary of all the\nknown votive anchors from the Eastern Mediterranean\u2014as there are indeed\nseveral examples of special stone anchors from the Aegean as well (Shaw,\n1995)\u2014this paper is intended to exemplify the application of the principles of\nCBT to archaeological material. The votive anchors from Kition-Kathari,\nByblos, and Ugarit will serve as the case studies. I wish to illustrate how\nthese votive objects are used to consolidate the conceptual relationship\nbetween the maritime community, the sea, the ship, and the divine.\n\n## Votive Stone Anchors\n\nIt is evident that an anchor\u2019s primary function is at sea, to keep the ship\nfrom drifting. The hundreds discovered on the seabed are testimony to the\nintense maritime traffic along the coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean in the\nsecond millennium BCE. While there are certainly more anchors in the sea than\non land, this second group is no less interesting. In particular, those\nanchors found in sacred contexts present distinctive features that make them\nthe ideal subject within a CBT framework. In fact, such votive stone anchors\nare some of the most significant artefacts that both materially and\nmetaphorically express the connection between the maritime community and the\nsea. The term votive is intended here in opposition to secular or mundane, to\nindicate objects that were deposited in special places within a framework of\nreligious beliefs, possibly but not necessarily in fulfilment of a vow.\nTherefore, the focus of this study are the votive stone anchors that were\ndiscovered in temples and sanctuaries. The non-votive anchors and the ones\nfound on the seabed will not be included in this paper as they would deserve a\nseparate discussion.^Footnote 1 Instead, they will only be addressed when\nnecessary to clarify elements about the votive stone anchors. Strong\nsimilarities can be detected between anchors embedded in the architecture of\nsanctuaries and those in tombs. However, the evidence for the use of stone\nanchors in tombs is limited to about ten anchors, five of which derive from\nproblematic contexts or are now lost (Brody, 1998, pp. 89\u201392), which makes the\nvotive nature of these objects very difficult to confirm. For these reasons, I\nprefer to exclude them from the present discussion. Even in sanctuaries,\nespecially in those with centuries of continuous use (e.g. at Kition-Kathari),\nwe encounter cases where the votive function of an anchor is difficult to\nprove, and indeed, it may well be that some were used as common building\nmaterial. Nevertheless, there is abundant evidence that a majority of those\nfound in temples have clear symbolic implications.\n\nConcerning the characteristics of said votive stone anchors, like their\nsecular counterparts, they are roughly triangular or trapezoidal stones, often\nrather large, equipped with one or more passing holes, which, theoretically,\ncould be used for the rope and the wooden stocks. Quite intuitively, the first\ndefining element distinguishing a votive anchor from a secular one is its\ncontext of primary deposition. Votive anchors are found in a variety of\nlocations within sacred precincts and temples, where they can be incorporated\nin the foundation walls, as well as placed free standing in courtyards and\nother open spaces. Indeed, the placing of anchors in building deposits well\nresonates with the long tradition of placing foundation/building deposits in\nsanctuaries as a mean to assure divine protection.^Footnote 2\n\nConnected to the context of deposition is another key feature of votive\nanchors: as far as it could be observed, all the votive anchors in the temples\nwere deposited new. It was initially supposed that some of these anchors,\nparticularly those used in the stone foundations of the walls and as the base\nfor pillars and columns, could have been deposited after the successful\njourney of a ship. However, as Frost pointed out, this does not appear to have\nbeen the case as none of the anchors discussed here shows signs of ever being\nused at sea (Frost, 1985, p. 282; 1991).\n\nRelated to the previous points, a last aspect to consider is that votive\nanchors need not have been functional in an actual sea voyage. While the\nmajority of anchors found in temples could have been used on board a ship,\nthis is not always the case. As will become evident in the examples below, the\nimpossibility of using a votive anchor on board the ship does not reduce its\nfunctionality within its sacred context. This implies that while\nmorphologically very similar, votive anchors and secular ones are in fact\ndifferent classes of objects with distinct\u2014although related\u2014properties. It is\nprecisely in the conceptual integration, or blending, between the two domains\nof sacred and profane that the emergent properties of the votive anchors come\ninto existence.\n\n### Byblos\n\nThe oldest evidence for the use of votive anchors is attested in various\ntemples at Byblos, where the tradition dates as far back as the early third\nmillennium BCE. In the Sacred Enclosure and in the Temple of Obelisks, thrteen\nstone anchors were found within the sacred precinct. Among these were three\nsmaller ones that did not exceed 30 cm in height. Given their relatively light\nweight, they were interpreted as fishing tackle shaped to resemble the large\ntriangular anchors (Frost, 1969, p. 429). In the Field of Offerings, the\nexcavators discovered four pierced stone anchors, along with other maritime\nvotives distributed in various deposits. In the Tower Temple, the earliest\nphases of which can be dated to the EB II (c. 3000\u20132800 BCE), the lowest\ncourse of the flight of steps leading to the single entrance to the building\nis constituted of six anchor-shaped stone blocks (Dunand & Lauffray, 2008, pp.\n393\u2013394; Frost, 1969, pp. 249\u2013430). The upper end of each block was rounded\nand presented a wide, regular passing hole as one would expect from typical\nMiddle Bronze Age (MBA, c. 2000\u20131600 BCE) single-hole anchors. These were only\nfinished on the upper side and showed no trace of use (Frost, 1969, 1970).\nAdditionally, as McCaslin (1980, p. 12) noted, being made of chalk, they could\nnot have been used at sea (Lawrence et al., 2013)\u2014a fact that the ancient\nseafarers were certainly aware of. Interestingly, the holed, upper portion of\nthe blocks would have been hidden under the next step in the sequence, making\nit impossible to recognize these stones as anchor-shaped once they had been\ndeposited.\n\n### Ugarit\n\nIn use between the end of the MBA until the destruction of the city (c. late\n17th to early twelfth century BCE), the Bronze Age Temple of Baal at Ugarit is\noften cited as the prototypical seafarers\u2019 temple. At Ugarit, the storm god\nBaal had distinct maritme attributes in his capacity of controlling the\nweather and as vanquisher of the sea (Brody, 1998, pp. 15\u201317; 2008, p. 445;\nYamasaki, 2023, pp. 78\u201380). Even the location of his temple on top of the\nacropolis would have probably served as a landmark for ships approaching the\nport at Minet el Beidha (Cornelius & Niehr, 2004, p. 65; Frost, 1991, p. 355;\nYon, 1990). Alone among the two contemporary temples on the acropolis, only\nthe Temple of Baal presented a concentration of maritime votives. Relevant to\nour discussion, several stone anchors of weights varying from a few kilograms\nto half a ton were built into the cella and were also used in the construction\nof the walls. Two more were found in the courtyard and must have been free\nstanding. Once again, these anchors had never been used and were deposited new\n(Frost, 1991, 362). Eight small weights were found in the area of the\nAcropolis, near the Temple of Baal and on the slopes directly below.^Footnote\n3 Of these, five resemble the large anchors, and in one case, the subsidiary\nhole for the wooden stock-arm is unfinished (Frost, 1991, Pl. VIII.26).\n\n### Kition-Kathari\n\nWe find the closest resemblance in shape, size, and use to the Ugaritic\nanchors at the Cypriot sanctuary of Kition-Kathari, which was founded in the\nlate 12th/early eleventh century BCE. Similar to Ugarit and Byblos, Bronze Age\nKition\u2019s economy largely relied on maritime trade, and this dependance was\nalso manifested in devotional practices. Among the most interesting material\nevidence of the tie between Kition and the sea, we have the 147 stone anchors\nin the sanctuary complex at Kition-Kathari from Temples 1, 2, 4 and 5\u2014this is\nthe most numerous group of anchors recovered from a land site (Wachsmann,\n1998, p. 273). Of these, a large part can be assigned to the category of\nvotives. The stone anchors from Kition are not only numerous, but they are\namong the largest on record, reaching up to 1350 kg weight and 1.6 m height,\nroughly spanning from the Late Bronze Age to the Phoenician period. They are\nlocated in a variety of contexts within the sanctuary and can be either free\nstanding or embedded in the temple architecture such as walls, thresholds, and\naltars. Similarly, they may be alone, or more frequently grouped in pairs,\ntriplets, and so on up to alignments of six anchors. Unlike at Byblos and\nUgarit, where anchors were not initially recognized by the excavators, the\nanchors at Kition were noted from the start of the excavation, and their\nposition, size, and shape were recorded together with all of their contextual\ninformation. Since they are discussed in great detail in Frost\u2019s appendix to\nthe Kition excavation report (Karageorghis & Demas, 1985), I will limit myself\nto highlight here some of the most notable examples.\n\nThe freestanding anchors are those to which a ritual/symbolic function may be\nmore easily attributed. Especially clear is the case with anchors 947 (Room\n12, Northern Workshops) and the fragmentary 4199 (Temple 5). Both were found\nupright and freestanding, with obvious signs of exposure to fire, in close\nassociation with burnt animal bones and bucrania, in what appears to be an\noffering installation.\n\nSeveral anchors were included into structures, of which at least 13 were used\nin the thresholds between various rooms in Temple 2 and in the Northern\nWorkshops\u2014it is perhaps significant that both thresholds and anchors can be\ninterpreted in relation to liminality. In one case, two anchors (2610, 2611,\nRoom 16, northern workshops) were found stacked on top of each other, with a\nthird anchor (2609) perpendicular to the other two completing the\nconfiguration. It is possible that the rope hole of the top anchor could be\nused in libations to be held upon entering/leaving this particular room. There\nare a few instances of thresholds featuring pairs of anchors identical in\nshape and size that were made of a different type of stone\u2014such as the case\nwith 2612 and 2612A (Temple 2) or 946 and 946A (northern workshops). This\nstrongly implies that the pairs were made at the same place, likely in one of\nthe temple workshops, from material that had been brought from different\nsources. To support the suggestion of an in situ production, we also have\nincomplete and newly carved, unused anchors out of stones of foreign\nprovenance (Forst, 1985, pp. 290\u2013291). These too were incorporated \u2018fresh\u2019\ninto the top layer of the stone foundations of the temple.\n\nAlignments of up to 6 anchors in the top course of the wall foundations can be\nobserved in the northern workshops, in Temple 1, and are especially\nconcentrated in Temple 4. As mentioned above, anchors may also be used as\ncolumn bases (2605\u20132607, room 16). It cannot be excluded that these last\nexamples were originally deposited as individual votives, and were\nincorporated in the temple architecture at a later stage. It is still debated\nwhether the number of anchors and their relation to each-other could be\nmeaningful.\n\nOther configurations include the anchors used as altar base in Temple 5 (4977,\n4978B/C), which show traces of fire exposure and were probably stand-alone\noffering installations before being incorporated in the altar. In other cases,\nthere are anchors laid into the floor or in shallow pits, at times\nindividually, other times in groups. In Room 15, four anchors are placed next\nto each-other into the floor with their rope-holes neatly aligned (944, 944A,\n2603, and 2604). Finally, from Temple 1, there are also 6 smaller anchors,\nvariously interpreted as miniature anchors, fishing weights, or diving weights\nthat have an individual mass up to 10 kg.\n\nInterestingly, as was the case at Ugarit and Byblos, none of the votive\nanchors from Kition shows clear signs of being ever used at sea (Frost, 1985,\np. 290). This applies as much to the free standing votives as to those used as\nconstruction materials. We also have examples of unfinished anchors. Some were\nonly finished on one side, or had only partially carved out rope holes,\nindicating, as already suggested by Frost, replicas rather than actual\nanchors. The presence of these unfinished specimens and of new anchors made of\nforeign stones further implies that at least some of the anchors were produced\ndirectly in the temple workshops.\n\n## Concepts, Cognitive Metaphors, and Blending Theory\n\nBefore addressing the issue of the conceptualization of votive anchors, it is\nnecessary to briefly discuss the term concept as intended in this paper.\nSimply defined, concepts are bundles of properties, actions, and knowledge\nblocks formed within a discourse, which are internalized by the mind and used\nto understand the world (Schwarz, 2008, pp. 109\u2013115). They are \u2018ideas or\ngroups of ideas that share specific common features or characteristics\u2019 (Solso\net al., 2014, p. 3). Within the study of ancient cultures, the study of\nconcepts is possible in as much as concepts are not only connected to the\nindividual experience, but are influenced by cultural background, education,\nand prevailing discourses\u2014as such, they are \u2018connected to, and expressed by\nsigns, like images, sounds, rituals\u2019 (Schmidt, 2019, p. 122) and material\nculture.\n\nOne important aspect of concept formation\u2014and as such, key to discuss the\nconceptualization of anchors\u2014revolves around humans\u2019 tendency to metaphorical\nthought in making sense of the world. Metaphorical thinking has been explored\nin detail within the field of cognitive linguistics. Some of the theoretical\nframeworks developed in that field, in particular, cognitive metaphor theory\nand blending theory, can be adjusted to the analysis of material and\niconographical evidence.\n\nIn Metaphors we live by (1980), Lakoff and Johnson maintain that concepts\nstructure how we perceive the world and relate to other people, and that our\nconceptual system is largely metaphorical: this implies that we understand one\nconcept in function of another (Lakoff & Johnson, 2003, p. 4). In other words,\nin a conceptual metaphor, we map a source domain onto a target domain. In\nturn, the target influences our concept of the source domain (Lakoff &\nJohnson, 2003, pp. 10\u201314). These conceptual metaphors depend both on the way\nour bodies interact with and perceive the world (e.g. humans locate the \u2018self\u2019\nin the head, where most sensory organs are concentrated, or in the upper part\nof our bodies (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2019); we have frontal, binocular vision;\nexperience is strongly connected with our visual perception since some 90% of\nthe information we receive is visual), as well as on socio-cultural factors\n(e.g. education, beliefs, traditions), that are learned by individuals in the\ncourse of their lives as members of specific groups (Lakoff & Johnson, 2003,\npp. 18\u201319).^Footnote 4 While many of the common metaphors that guide our\nthought processes can be reduced to the type of metaphors described by Lakoff\nand Johnson, they are but one kind of metaphorical thinking. In everyday\nsituations, our mind operates on more than a binary mode of conceptualizing\nthe world. In fact, source-domain metaphors appear to operate as a very\nspecific type within the wider framework of conceptual blending, i.e. the\nmultidirectional interaction of several domains and signs/objects (Fauconnier\n& Turner, 2003, pp. 126\u2013127).\n\nA well-known example of the blended metaphorical thought proposed by Gilles\nFauconnier and Marc Turner (1998, p. 279) is contained in the following\nstatement: \u2018this surgeon is a butcher\u2019. While the sentence proposes the\njuxtaposition of two fields, the surgeon and the butcher, to understand its\npejorative implications, it is not sufficient to map the source (butcher) onto\nthe target (surgeon). Both the surgeon and the butcher share some structures\nor features within a generic space: cut parts of meat/flesh, use similarly\nsharp instruments, can be precise, clean, and reach the desired results. Out\nof these seemingly shared structures, the metaphor operates a further\ntransformation in a fourth space, the blend, where the setting and actors of\nthe surgery are combined with the tools and purposes of butchery creating new\nemergent properties (Fig. 2; Birdsell, 2014; Fauconnier & Turner, 1998, p.\n279; Roberts, 2018, pp. 34\u201335).\n\nFig. 2\n\nAdapted from Birdsell, 2014, Fig. 2.4.6\n\nSurgeon and the butcher diagram.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe inputs (here: surgeon and butcher), which need not be limited to two, take\nthe name of mental spaces and include all our pre-existing knowledge about\nthem (here: medicine, economy, slaughterhouse, hospital, social status,\nprofession, blood and flesh, etc.). Fauconnier and Turner define mental spaces\nas the \u2018short-term constructs grounded in experience informed by the more\ngeneral and more stable knowledge structures associated with a particular\ndomain\u2019 (Grady et al., 1999, p. 102). Mental spaces, together with all the\nbackground of socio-cultural knowledge that we have about them, are connected\nto an infinity of other mental spaces in an equally infinite variety of\nrelations, which come to the forefront or remain obscured on a contextual\nbasis. From this pool of properties, the mind (which is influenced by society,\nmilieu, culture, etc.) recruits the relevant knowledge and selects structures\nthat are shared by the mental spaces involved in the blend. The mental space\nof shared properties takes the name of generic space. From the generic space,\nthe mind takes the elements to construct a new metaphor within a blended\nspace. It is in this blended space that the new concept takes form. In the\ncase of the butcher and the surgeon, we have a surgeon that operates with the\ntools and skills of a butcher within a framework of surgery.\n\nGeneralizing from the above example, mental spaces share a certain number of\nconceptual structures in a generic space, while their conceptual elements are\ncombined and reworked in a blended space (Fauconnier & Turner, 2003, p. 40).\nThe use of mental spaces instead of domains as posited by CBT proves more\nadaptable than CMT to a variety of phenomena, including the use of figurative\nspeech in ancient texts, as already demonstrated by Rune Nyord (2009, pp.\n23\u201327), and I shall add, material culture. In the case of archaeological\nobjects, a blended space framework allows us to recognize a variety of mental\nspaces. It also allows us to highlight the shared conceptual structures from\ndifferent mental spaces that were associated to an object, and how these\nelements interacted with each other, shaping multifaceted and multidirectional\nmetaphorical meanings. With Fauconnier and Turner\u2019s surgeon in mind, let us\nturn to a concrete example from an archaeological context.\n\nThe fish-shaped askos in Fig. 3 was found in one of the three MBA sea-side\ntombs discovered during construction works in Byblos in 1924 (Montet, 1928b,\np. 244). Although there is relatively little information about this object,\nCBT allows us to frame our interpretation from a cognitive perspective. In the\nconceptualization of a fish-shaped vase in a Bronze Age cemetery, we can\nidentify, at the very least, the mental spaces of the container, those of the\nanimal, and the framework of the context in which the vessel is used (in this\ncase, the sphere of death, as suggested by the finding spot in a necropolis).\nA basic structure shared by the input spaces is the cognitive metaphor of the\nbody as a container, and water or another libation, which we often find in\nconnection with concepts of purification and cleansing (Fisher, 2007).\nAdditionally, the mental space of the tomb and the mental space of the fish\nhave shared structures as well, particularly in the form of liminality (of\nwater, in the case of the fish, and of death in the case of the tomb). Even\nwithout knowing which particular statement is being made by such an object, we\ncan assume that properties common to the animal, the container, and the\ncontext are interacting in the creation of meaning for the zoomorphic jug.\nFollowing the known associations of vessels in mortuary rituals, purity, and\nliminality in the Levantine Bronze Age, the diagram proposes the integration,\nor blend, of multiple structures and mental spaces in the fish shaped vessel\nand thus presents a potential framework in which to interpret the object (Fig.\n4). This blended approach allows us to discuss also the Eastern Mediterranean\nvotive stone anchors as material metaphors.\n\nFig. 3\n\nFish-shaped askos from Byblos. Drawing by K.

There would be no logical reason to\ncarve an anchor only to use it as common building material when with less\neffort; one could dress an aptly shaped block from the start. These special,\nbrand-new anchors were deposited in temples as votives and, as seen in Kition,\nat least in part employed in special rituals involving burning, libations and\nanimal offerings.\n\nRemarkably, only anchors that were never used at sea, were employed in the\nconstruction of the temple itself. If this were a case of opportunistic reuse\nof good stone material, we would have a wider variety of new and used anchors\naligned in the walls and in the floors. The concentration of new anchors\nindicates that they had been specifically produced to be used within the\nsanctuary.\n\nNow that I hope to have established that the anchors in question were not used\nin temple architecture by mere opportunism, I would like to focus the\ndiscussion on how these objects were conceptualized and go beyond the\nacknowledgement of their strong symbolic import. By bringing the cognitive\nprocess that underlie the construction of a concept to the forefront, CBT\noffers the right framework to address this issue. Within the blend expressed\nby votive stone anchors, we can recognize, at the very least, three input\nspaces: the temple, the city, and the ship.\n\n### Temple and City\n\nFrom the Ancient Near Eastern urban tradition, we know that the association\nbetween the city and its tutelary god(s) through their temple was more than a\nmatter of patronage: the fate of the city was intertwined with that of its\ndeity and their house-temple. Voluminous literature discusses the mapping of\nthe Near Eastern temple onto the concept of the house in general, and of the\npalace in particular, and I refer the reader to the volume by Michael Hundley,\nGods in Dwellings (2013), for an overview on the topic. When an enemy army\nentered a city, it was not infrequent for the statues of their gods to be\ntaken away with the war booty. Far from being the simple removal of precious\nobjects from a temple, this was intended to function as an actual abduction of\nthe deity, without whom the city would be deprived of their protection\n(Johnson, 2011; Zaia, 2015). In a common literary topos, the gods, angered by\nhuman misconduct, decide to leave their city, with terrible consequences, and\nonly reconciliation with and return of the deity can restore good fortune.\nDivine abandonment, whether voluntary or forcible, implied the ruin of the\ncity (Zaia, 2015, p. 24). A well-functioning, solid temple thus guaranteed the\ncontinued residence of the tutelar deity. As such, the existence of the temple\nwas perceived to be essential to the functioning of the city.\n\n### Ship and City\n\nThe other conceptual integration that we need to consider is that of ship and\ncity. To best illustrate this blend, I would like to discuss a known passage\nfrom the Old Testament, the Lamentation for Tyre in Ezekiel 27:26\u201336. The Book\nof Ezekiel was likely composed sometime around the early sixth century BCE\n(Sweeney, 1998, p. 89; Zimmerli, 1979, pp. 9\u201315), thus several centuries after\nthe deposition of the Bronze Age votive anchors in Byblos, Ugarit, and Kition.\nHowever, the metaphor expressed here might shed some light over the\nconceptualization of the city in function of the ship. In this passage, the\ncity of Tyre is compared to a sinking ship:\n\n> Your oarsmen brought you into many waters, but the east wind broke you in\n> the midst of the seas. Your riches, wares, and merchandise, your mariners\n> and pilots, your caulkers and merchandisers, all your men of war who are in\n> you, And the entire company which is in your midst, Will fall into the midst\n> of the seas on the day of your ruin [...] But you are broken by the seas in\n> the depths of the waters; Your merchandise and the entire company will fall\n> in your midst (Ezek. 27:26\u201336, NIV).\n\nIn this case, we have the two organizing frameworks of the city and the ship,\nfrom which only a selection of common structures is used to create the\nmetaphor. The doomed historical trajectory of a city whose fortune was largely\nbased on maritime trade is equated to a tragic shipwreck with no survivors:\nthe common structures are thus the people whose lives depend on the ship or\ncity (oarsmen, mariners etc., and inhabitants), the precious goods (as cargo\nand merchandise), and disaster (shipwreck and destruction of the city).\nEzekiel\u2019s counterfactual equation of the city as ship allows the creation of a\nnew mental space, where properties of the ship and the city can merge. A\ncryptic passage appearing twice in the Ugaritic poem of Keret (KTU 1.16.I.6\u20139;\nII.44\u201347) may also be interpreted as a metaphor of the ship as the city,\ndepending on the reading of the Ugaritic \u1e25l. Brody (1998, 16, n. 31) presents\na convincing argument in favour of such metaphorical equation. The emerging\nblended metaphorical concept is that of a city-ship that relies on both the\nconceptual structures of the city and the ship to function. Phoenician coinage\nfrom Sidon dating to the fifth century BCE appears to visually represent the\nsame metaphor (Fig. 5). The Sidonian shekel and double shekel depict a galley\nin front of the towered city walls (Elayi & Elayi, 2014, pp. 587, Pl. LXXIV.3,\nLXXV.C11-12, LXXVI.C13-15). The composition of the image merges the city and\nthe ship to the point that it almost appears that the latter is supporting the\nother. Certainly, neither the Sidonian coins nor Ezekiel\u2019s Lamentation for\nTyre can be considered a generalization of the conceptualization of the city\nin the second millennium BCE. Nevertheless, given the cultural continuity\nbetween the Canaanite and Phoenician city states, the presence of city-ship\nimagery in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE at least suggests that similar\nmetaphorical associations may have existed already in the Late Bronze Age,\nespecially for coastal cities with strong maritime inclination.\n\nFig. 5\n\nSidonian double shekel, fifth century BCE. Drawing by the author after Elayi\nand Elayi, 2014, Plate LXXIV.3\n\nFull size image\n\n### Ship and Temple\n\nEven more than between city and ship, we can clearly visualize the common\ncognitive structures shared by the temple and the sea in the Mediterranean\nBronze Age: they are both powerful liminal spaces and as such potentially\ndangerous in a natural and/or supernatural way, a similarity that facilitates\nconceptual blending. The ship is likewise understood to possess liminal\nqualities as she allows relatively safe passage between two points on land\nacross the dangers of the sea (Westerdahl 2005; Monroe, 2011). It is safe to\nassume that her symbols would evoke similar scenarios and that the act of\ndepositing anchors in a sanctuary, as seen at Kition, Ugarit, and Byblos,\nclearly brought the sea and its relations within the associative space of\nsacredness (Yamasaki, 2023, pp. 157\u2013158; forthcoming). Additional evidence\nsupports the close relationship between the concepts of ship and temple, and\nof the Temple of Baal in particular. In the Ugaritic Story of Keret, the house\nof Baal, the storm god, is referred to as a ship (KTU 1.16.I.6\u20139 and KTU\n1.16.II.44\u201347; Brody, 1998, 15; Parker, 1989). In the Sallier IV Papyrus, we\nfind the formula \u2018to the ship of Baal \u1e62ap\u014dn\u2019 in reference to the god\u2019s temple\n(Brody, 1998, p. 17).^Footnote 5\n\nFurthermore, if the temple is the house of the god, then the opposite may also\nbe true that a place that is inhabited by the god may be regarded as a temple.\nIn this respect, there is some evidence that ships may have functioned as cult\nspaces. Wachsman (1998, pp. 206\u2013208) interprets the gilded female figurine\nfrom the shipwreck of Uluburun as the possible representation of the ship\u2019s\nresident goddess. The depictions of Syro-Canaanite ships on the wall of the\nTomb of Kenamun (fourteenth century BCE) show Levantine merchants performing\nincense offerings at the bow (Davies & Faulkner, 1947).\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that, as early as in the Late Bronze Age (possibly\neven earlier), the ship would either be the house of the deity or that the\ndeity had a dedicated space on board. Indeed, first millennium Phoenician and\nGreek evidence strongly implies the sacredness of the ship inasmuch as it was\ninhabited by the divine (Brody, 2008). Mark Christian (2013) suggests that\npart-time cultic personnel was part of the usual crew on-board long-range\nPhoenician seafaring vessels and that these specialists would have also been\nin charge of performing the rituals at small and remote coastal shrines. If we\naccept the ship-temple blend, we can see how the two input spaces of ship and\ntemple share a significant number of structures (e.g. liminality, danger, and\nritual) for which the ship acquires the properties of a sacred space.\n\nAnchors were not the sole symbols of seafaring that appeared in maritime-\noriented temples\u2014we have for instance the very conspicuous ship graffiti at\nKition (Basch & Artzy, 1985) and several ship models from Byblos (Wachsmann,\n1998, pp. 52\u201354). There is little doubt, however, that in the materiality of\nthe maritime cultures of the eastern Mediterranean, anchors possessed a strong\ncommunicative power, to the point of embodying the very essence of maritimity.\nGiven that they are an integral part of the construction of temples, it is\nthen apparent that examining them just as voti or ex-voti in the strict sense\nof votum fecit gratia accepit for a successful seaborne expedition is greatly\nreductive of the wide scope of interactions between the anchors and temples.\n\nIn her analysis of the anchors from the Tower Temple, Frost (1969, 430)\nsuggested that the anchors deposited in group may have represented the\nstandard complement of a ship. She reprises this theory in her interpretation\nof the Kition material. However, this is a particularly difficult statement to\nverify, as it is clear that the number of anchors on board could vary\nimmensely from craft to craft. Therefore, the number of anchors in a temple\nwall or at the bottom of the stairs may not literally represent the actual\nnumber on board a given vessel. Afterall, within a blended framework of ship\nand temple, it is not necessary for the temple to be equipped with the same\nnumber of anchors needed on board any particular ship (or ships).\n\nThe temple and the ship share essential structures common to both that enable\nthe metaphor, of which the anchor is the material manifestation. Ships have a\nliminal relationship with a space (the underwater world) below, whereas\ntemples and other on-land sacred spaces have a liminal relationship with a\nspace (the heavens) above. Thus, both similarly allow a link both above and\nbelow to realms which otherwise humans cannot explore. Albeit with local\ndifferences from temple to temple, the placement of the anchors within the\nprecincts makes them carriers of meaning intertwined with their function at\nsea of keeping a ship from drifting. In other words, it makes them material\nmetaphors that acquire meaning within a blended space of maritime and sacred.\n\nIn the capacity of material metaphors, anchors create a connection between the\nsea and the temple with its associations of sacredness, transcendence and\nworship. The consistent use of these objects as maritime votives suggests that\nthey would have been perceived as a salient part of the ship, able to\nrepresent pars pro toto the entire vessel within a sacred context. In\nmaritime-oriented cities, whose wealth relied in no little measure on seaborne\ntrade, we can imagine a community of mariners and merchants for whom the city\n= ship equation was more than a literary metaphor. Their livelihood and\nsuccess depended on those same powers that governed a ship, and as such needed\nto ward themselves against the natural and supernatural dangers, both at sea\nand on land. In other words, just like ships, their lives depended on the\nsteadiness of all of their anchors, on board and in the temples.\n\nThe vast chronological distance that separates the archaeologist from those\nwho deposited these objects does not allow us to know all of the many layers\nof meaning that votive anchors had in the Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age.\nNevertheless, the model presented here allows us to understand how these\nobjects blended maritimity and sacredness and became the pivot to establish a\nmultitude of conceptual connections (Fig. 6).\n\nFig. 6\n\nCity-ship-temple blend diagram\n\nFull size image\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAs first observed by Frost, the numerous stone anchors discovered in Bronze\nAge sanctuaries strongly imply that they were attributed symbolic value as\nearly as the third millennium BCE down to at least the Early Iron Age. Even\ntoday, the entanglement between the concepts of safety and anchor is so tight\nthat it is difficult to separate one from the other: anchors are synonymous\nwith security, stability, and hope.\n\nWhile we cannot be certain of the exact meaning that the Bronze Age votive\nanchors were intended to carry, we can highlight how votive anchors functioned\nwithin a wider conceptual framework. By approaching the subject from the\nperspective of CBT, I have demonstrated that these special objects are found\nat the convergence of multiple conceptual domains of ship, temple, and city.\nOn a ship, anchors are used to keep her from drifting and are essential to her\nsafety during a storm. While we can infer that a part of the symbolic meaning\nof votive anchors is connected to safety, in the blend between ship, city,\ntemple, and ship, there are a multitude of conceptual associations that\nconnect the domains of maritimity to the sacred, the coastal cities, and their\ninhabitants. While many of the concrete associations are lost to us, they\nwould have been clear to the inhabitants of Kition or Ugarit. Nevertheless,\nCBT shows how multiple conceptual spaces can be integrated together with their\npotential associative fields. Votive anchors are clearly the manifestation in\nstone of complex conceptual blending processes, and as such pivotal to the\nunderstanding of the conceptualization of maritimity in the Eastern\nMediterranean Bronze Age.\n\n## Data Availability\n\nAdditional data available upon request.\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. Failing other contextual evidence, we shall assume, on the basis of parsimony, that anchors found on the seabed were lost or abandoned, rather than deposited as watery votives.\n\n  2. For a comprehensive overview on Ancient Near Eastern foundation deposits, see Ellis (1968).\n\n  3. An unspecified number of similar objects was observed but not properly recorded in Minet el Beidha (Frost 1991, 385).\n\n  4. For instance, the experience of gravity is at the base of various orientational metaphors structured in terms of GOOD IS UP/BAD IS DOWN: \u2018they are in peak shape\u2019, \u2018they fell ill\u2019, \u2018they reached the top\u2019. At the same time, the metaphorical expression use of the physical experience of an uphill road may produce different metaphorical outcomes: in English, \u2018an uphill goal\u2019 is structured on GOING UP IS TIRING, implying an arduous task; in Japanese, \u2018to go uphill\u2019 is structured on GOOD IS UP, thus with the meaning that the given condition is improving. In this case, the metaphorical use of uphill, while still based on the same human experience, is culturally specific.\n\n  5.
