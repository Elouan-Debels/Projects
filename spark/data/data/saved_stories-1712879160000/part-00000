The first\n90 days at your new gig could make or break the relationship with your entire\nteam moving forward, so how do we make a great first impression?\n\nTaking inspiration from The First 90 Days by Michael D. Watkins, I believe it\nreally comes down to these three things.\n\n  1. Learning\n\n  2. Execution\n\n  3. Growing Others\n\n#\n\n1\\. Learning (Days 1-30)\n\nTake whatever you learned from your previous company and throw it out the\nwindow. All your best practices, your testing strategies, your rollout\nstrategies, your genius tooling, PR review methods. Say goodbye. I know, those\nare your babies, but for now let\u2019s forget them.\n\nThink of yourself as an anthropologist, invest early to speaking like the\nlocals\n\n\\- Michael D. Watkins\n\nIt\u2019s time to learn everything about your company. Think beyond just your\nimmediate team, what does this company do?\n\n  * What are the informal networks of communication?\n\n  * What are the most important products of the business?\n\n  * Who are the customers?\n\n  * What is the company\u2019s operating model?\n\n  * Who are your stakeholders outside of product/design/engineering?\n\nThis is a great time to meet with as many people as possible across the\ncompany and ask questions. Don\u2019t come in with any answers quite yet.\n\nSoon you\u2019ll become the company expert on your team. Chances are the other\nengineers have no idea how the company works outside of their\ndomain/expertise. The more you know about the business the more you can move\nthe needle forward for your pillar.\n\n#\n\n2\\. Execute (Days 30-60)\n\nNow that you have a good idea of the culture, met stakeholders and peers, and\nhave assimilated as much as possible. It\u2019s time to execute.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s time to let go of ego. Just because you\u2019re coming in as a senior\nengineer doesn\u2019t mean you must do senior level tasks right away (e.g. design\ndocs, large projects).\n\nInstead, secure early wins. Building momentum early is the easiest way to gain\nrespect from your peers.\n\nThink about it, have you ever had a new person join your team who just knocked\nout a ton of low hanging fruit or tickets? What did everyone say about them?\nI\u2019m going to assume pretty positive things about how quickly they\u2019ve become\nhelpful.\n\nSo, do the easy tasks, the mundane tasks, whatever you think would help the\nteam right now.\n\n#\n\n3\\. Growing Others (Days 60-90)\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably gained quite a bit of trust from the team. Let\u2019s\nleverage the respect you\u2019ve garnered to grow and help others.\n\nIn my personal experience, I\u2019ve found the best way to do this is through\nasking questions and leading by example.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n  * Ask questions in a non-confrontational way in PRs and design reviews\n\n    * \u201cI noticed you\u2019re using `cache_fn()` to store the team_id, does that mean we\u2019ve elected to not use the new CacheInstance::class that was introduced last week?\u201d\n\n  * Creating in depth PR descriptions for your own PRs when you notice others have empty descriptions\n\n  * Creating reusable test infrastructure for your tests when you notice others aren\u2019t adding unit tests to their code\n\n  * Fixing issues that other people have brought up in meetings/standup\n\n    * E.g. In standup people were complaining about a noisy page/alert and you spend an hour fine tuning it to reduce pages\n\nI hope this helps.
