The bigger piece is the\nmiddle, where \"willing to pay\" includes the phrase \"as long as you make it\nconvenient\".\n\nFor a while, the media companies looked like they had learned that lesson.\nThen, they decided to silo everything into 100 different streaming services\n(while, at the same time, reducing the ability to buy physical media), each\nwith their own policies, payment plans, restrictions, etc. And even then, they\nstill tend to remove (or never make available) large parts of their own\nlibraries.\n\nAnd so, all of the casual pirates who had switched to paying for stuff, are\nnow in the process of switching back to the old ways. (Note: this is not a\ndefense of pirating of any sort, please don't anyone take it as such.)\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n#### More options\n\nReport Add bookmark Share\n\nUpvote\n\n122 (122 / 0)\n\nQuote\n\nReport\n\nUpvote\n\n122 (122 / 0)\n\n#### ThatEffer\n\n##### Ars Scholae Palatinae\n\n    4y\n\n    610\n\nSubscriptor++\n\nYesterday at 2:12 PM\n\n* #20\n\n  * Yesterday at 2:12 PM\n\n  * Add bookmark\n  * #20\n\nThis old chestnut again?\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n#### More options\n\nReport Add bookmark Share\n\nUpvote\n\n30 (30 / 0)\n\nQuote\n\nReport\n\nUpvote\n\n30 (30 / 0)\n\nPost content hidden for low score.

The middle class no\nlonger has endless dollars to spend on superfluous entertainment expenses like\nmovies and dining out while they're struggling to pay rent and buy food. Of\ncourse the studios' revenues are down.

I pay for\nYouTube Premium, I pay for Netflix and Hulu and Disney+ and Max and Apple+. I\nhave Amazon Prime. Hell, I pay for Fubo too, my wife uses it for sports. I'm\nas legal as you can get.\n\nAnd yet it feels so damn hard sometimes to just watch the things I want to\nsee. There are times when I want to give you money to watch your content and\ncan't.\n\nOur systems don't really feel reasonable.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n#### More options\n\nReport Add bookmark Share\n\nUpvote\n\n102 (103 / -1)\n\nQuote\n\nReport\n\nUpvote\n\n102 (103 / -1)\n\n#### Super King\n\n##### Wise, Aged Ars Veteran\n\n    5y\n\n    137\n\nSubscriptor\n\nYesterday at 2:31 PM\n\n* #39\n\n  * Yesterday at 2:31 PM\n\n  * Add bookmark\n  * #39\n\n> 50me12 said:\n>\n> Not to help out the MPAA but if you're up for an afternoon time, local\n> theaters in my area are crazy cheap and surprisingly empty.

I'm too old to be trying to steal stuff. If it's worth it I pay for it\nso you guy can keep making content. My kids get pissed off at me because I\nmake them stay until the credits are gone. Initially I told them the truth \"we\nwant to honor the the hundreds of people that made this movie possible\" but\nkids have the attention span of a gnat so now we've done the half-truth \"there\nmight be a teaser at the end of the credits\". I'm old skool\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n#### More options\n\nReport Add bookmark Share\n\nUpvote\n\n15 (21 / -6)\n\nQuote\n\nReport\n\nUpvote\n\n15 (21 / -6)\n\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\n\n  * Forums\n\n  * Ars Lykaion\n\n  * News & Discussion\n\n  * Light theme\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Posting guidelines\n  * Terms and rules\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Help\n  * RSS\n\nCommunity platform by XenForo^\u00ae \u00a9 2010-2021 XenForo Ltd. | Community services from Audentio\n\nJump to latest Follow Reply\n\nJump to latest Follow Reply\n\n## We Care About Your Privacy\n\nWe and our 167 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
