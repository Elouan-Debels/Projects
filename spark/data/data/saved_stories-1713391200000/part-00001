Discover new apps, update\neverything with single click, and automate maintenance tasks. Basically all\nyou would expect. Plus, really nice icons and shortcuts.\n\n### But we already have Homebrew in the terminal\n\nFair point... However, Brewer X builds upon the existing Homebrew experience\nand makes it faster and smoother. You will get app\u2019s icons, bulk actions, and\nparallel processes. Also, searching by name, token, and description will give\nyou superpowers.\n\n## Why should you use it\n\n### One, two, three, upgrade!\n\nGoing down one step at the time is boring... why don\u2019t you try two, or three!\nWith the bulk actions you can do everything you want on precisely what you\nwant. All done in parallel!\n\nBulk actions allow you to install, upgrade, or uninstall anything in parallel.\n\n### Search, filter, and be right there\n\nAre you looking for a new photo editor? Or maybe you forgot the name of that\nnew browser. No big deal... Our blazingly fast search gets you to the right\nresults in a flash.\n\nModular search tokens allow you to search by name, token, description, or all\nthree.\n\n### Keep everything under control\n\nSometimes a process can fail, or you may wonder what is going on behind the\nscenes. In both cases press \u2318Y to open the Transcript panel. You\u2019ll have a\nlook at the Homebrew logs beneath Brewer X. It\u2019s that easy.\n\nThe Transcript gives you an inside view to debug and keep track of the\nactivities.\n\n### Don\u2019t be limited by first-party\n\nIt\u2019s all about content after all. The more the better. That\u2019s why we have a\nbuiltin repositories manager. It allows you to add new sources of apps,\nscripts, fonts, and even functionalities.\n\nRepositories manager allows you to open the door at new content and\nfunctionalities.\n\n## Supported Homebrew features\n\nThis table here is constantly updated. If a feature is not supported yet it\nwill probably be in a future update.\n\nFeature| Homebrew| Taps| Formulas| Casks  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nUpdate| -| -| -  \nInstall| -  \nUpgrade| -| -  \nUpgrade All| -| -  \nUninstall| -  \nHome| -  \nCleanup| -| -| -  \nPrune| -| -| -  \nAutoremove| -| -| -  \n  \n#### Brewer X\n\nv1.1 \u00b7 Requires macOS 13.0+\n\n##### $49/once\n\nLifetime license\n\nBuy once and own the app, forever.\n\nOne year of updates\n\nOptionally get another year for just $29.\n\n30-day money back guarantee\n\nJust write us an email to get your refund.\n\nBuy Now\n\n1% of your purchase will contribute to CO2 removal.
