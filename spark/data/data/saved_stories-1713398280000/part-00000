Instead of a\nnetwork of organic neurons and synapses, Intel's Hala Point emulates them all\nin silicon.\n\nAt roughly 20 W, our brains are surprisingly efficient at processing the large\nquantities of information streaming in from each of senses at any given\nmoment. The field of neuromorphics, of which Intel and IBM have spent the past\nfew years exploring, aims to emulate the brain's network of neurons and\nsynapses to build computers capable of processing information more efficiently\nthan traditional accelerators.\n\nHow efficient? According to Intel, its latest system, a 6U box roughly the\nsize of a microwave that consumes 2,600 W, can reportedly achieve deep neural\nnetwork efficiencies as high as 15 TOPS/W at 8-bit precision. To put that in\nperspective, Nvidia's most powerful system, the Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72,\nwhich has yet to even ship, manages just 6 TOPS/W at INT8, while its current\nDGX H100 systems can manage about 3.1 TOPS/W.\n\nResearchers at Sandia National Labs take delivery of Intel's 1.15 billion\nneuron Hala Point neuromorphic computer \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nThis performance is achieved using 1,152 of Intel's Loihi 2 processors, which\nare stitched together in a three-dimensional grid for a total of 1.15 billion\nneurons, 128 billion synapses, 140,544 processing cores, and 2,300 embedded\nx86 cores that handle the ancillary computations necessary to keep the thing\nchugging along.\n\nTo be clear, those aren't typical x86 cores. \"They are very, very simple,\nsmall x86 cores. They're not anything like our latest cores or Atom\nprocessors,\" Mike Davies, director of neuromorphic computing at Intel, told\nThe Register.\n\nIf Loihi 2 rings a bell, that's because the chip has been knocking around for\na while now having made its debut back in 2021 as one of the first chips\nproduced using Intel's 7nm process tech.\n\nDespite its age, Intel says the Loihi-based systems are capable of solving\ncertain AI inference and optimization problems as much as 50x faster than\nconventional CPU and GPU architectures while consuming 100x less power. Those\nnumbers appear to have been achieved [PDF] by pitting a single Loihi 2 chip to\nNvidia's tiny Jetson Orin Nano and a Core i9 i9-7920X CPU.\n\n### Don't throw out your GPUs yet\n\nWhile that might sound impressive, Davies admits that its neuromorphic\naccelerators aren't ready to replace GPUs for every workload just yet. \"This\nis not a general-purpose AI accelerator by any means,\" he said.\n\nFor one, arguably AI's most popular application, the large language models\n(LLMs) powering apps like ChatGPT, won't run on Hala Point, at least not yet.\n\n\"We're not mapping any LLM to Hala Point at this time. We don't know how to do\nthat. Quite frankly, the neuromorphic research field does not have a\nneuromorphic version of the transformer,\" Davies said, noting that there is\nsome interesting research into how that might be achieved.\n\nHaving said that, Davies' team has had success running traditional deep neural\nnetworks, a multi-layer perceptron, on Hala Point with some caveats.\n\n  * RISC-V AI chip upstart Rivos plans to undercut Nvidia, helped by a quarter-billion in VC lucre\n  * AI cloud startup TensorWave bets AMD can beat Nvidia\n  * Los Alamos Lab powers up Nvidia-laden Venado supercomputer\n  * Intel Gaudi's third and final hurrah is an AI accelerator built to best Nvidia's H100\n\n\"If you can sparsify the network activity and the conductivity in that\nnetwork, that's when you can achieve really, really big gains,\" he said. \"What\nthat means is that it has to be processing a continuous input signal ... a\nvideo stream or an audio stream, something where there's some correlation from\nsample to sample to sample.\"\n\nIntel Labs demonstrated Loihi 2's potential for video and audio processing in\na paper published [PDF] late last year. In testing they found that the chip\nachieved significant gains in energy efficiency, latency, and throughput for\nsignal processing, sometimes exceeding three orders of magnitude, compared to\nconventional architectures. However, the largest gains did come at the expense\nof lower accuracy.\n\nThe ability to process real-time data at low power and latency has made the\ntech attractive for applications like autonomous vehicles, drones, and\nrobotics.\n\nAnother use case that's shown promise is combinatorial optimization problems,\nlike route planning for a delivery vehicle, which has to navigate a busy city\ncenter.\n\nThese workloads are incredibly complex to solve as small changes like vehicle\nspeed, accidents, and lane closures have to be accounted for on the fly.\nConventional computing architectures aren't well suited to this kind of\nexponential complexity, which is why we've seen so many quantum computing\nvendors targeting optimization problems.\n\nHowever, Davies argues that Intel's neuromorphic computing platform is \"far\nmore mature than these other experimental research alternatives.\"\n\n### Room to grow\n\nAccording to Davies, there's also still plenty of headroom to be unlocked.\n\"I'm sad to say it's not fully even exploited to this day because of software\nlimitations,\" he said of the Loihi 2 chips.\n\nIdentifying hardware bottlenecks and software optimizations is part of the\nreason Intel Labs has deployed the prototype at Sandia.\n\n\"Understanding the limitations, especially at the hardware level, is a very\nimportant part of getting these systems out there,\" Davies said. \"We can fix\nthe hardware issues, we can improve it, but we need to know what direction to\noptimize.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time Sandia boffins have gotten their hands on\nIntel's neuromorphic tech. In a paper published in early 2022, researchers\nfound the tech had potential for HPC and AI. However, those experiments used\nIntel's first-gen Loihi chips, which have roughly an eighth the neurons\n(128,000 vs 1 million) of its successor. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * HPC\n  * Intel\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * HPC\n  * Intel\n  * Research\n  * Semiconductor\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * ASML\n  * Broadcom\n  * Cadence Design Systems\n  * Exascale\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Hadoop\n  * Hot Chips\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Loongson\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Mobileye\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * NXP Semiconductors\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Star Wars\n  * STMicroelectronics\n  * Tachyum\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * United Microelectronics Corporation\n  * vPro\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FPGA\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * HPC\n  * Intel\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * HPC\n  * Intel\n  * Research\n  * Semiconductor\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * ASML\n  * Broadcom\n  * Cadence Design Systems\n  * Exascale\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Hadoop\n  * Hot Chips\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Loongson\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Mobileye\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * NXP Semiconductors\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Star Wars\n  * STMicroelectronics\n  * Tachyum\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * United Microelectronics Corporation\n  * vPro\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FPGA\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Intel Gaudi's third and final hurrah is an AI accelerator built to best\nNvidia's H100\n\nIntel Vision Goodbye dedicated AI hardware and hello to a GPU that fuses Xe\ngraphics DNA with Habana chemistry\n\nSystems8 days | 1\n\n#### Intel's effort to build a foundry biz is costing far more \u2013 and taking\nlonger \u2013 than expected\n\nAnalysis If you wanna make money you've gotta spend money.
