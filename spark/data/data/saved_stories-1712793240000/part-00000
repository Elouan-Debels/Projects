The\ncosts of failure come front and center, as the ability for a company to play\nout scenarios where something would not work overwhelms the na\u00efve optimism\nthat used to characterize efforts. It is like one day, suddenly, everything\nbecomes more difficult and scarier. Clippy, n\u00e9e Clippit, needs no introduction\nas the failure, the evolution to kitsch, and the resurrection as a technology\nahead of its time have been baked into even mainstream consciousness. If you\nwould have asked me in 2000, three years after the debut, if I would still be\ntalking about this failed feature, I would have LOLed. While I could probably\nfill a book with the story and the team that brought the feature, this is the\nstory told in the context of the arc of the PC and Microsoft.\n\nAlso, a good time to note that success has many parents and failure has none.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of told-you-so around Clippy, until recently that is.\n\nNote, this post is best read in a desktop browser for a complete experience.\n\nBack to 041. Scaling the Office Infrastructure and Platform\n\nWhy not subscribe? \ud83d\ude4f\n\nIn early discussions, we attempted to explain how we had learned from the\nabysmal failure of Microsoft Bob and that we had a plan. At one point, the\nconversation turned from stepping through a complex task in Excel to BillG\nbringing us to tears in playing back what he heard. They were both tears of\njoy and tears of pain. It went something like this:\n\n    \n    \n    Demo: The Assistant will then appear and offer each step in sequence to create a chart, as the user interface does today. But it will be more friendly and approachable and have easy access to help content.\n    \n    \n    Bill: So, when I want to create a chart the clown will pop up and say, \u201cI\u2019m here to help\u201d and . . .\n    \n    \n    Demo: Not clown, but assistant.\n    \n    \n    Bill: The clown pops up and then I\u2019m like clicking on the clown saying clown next, next, clown next or something just to create a chart.\n    \n    \n    Demo: The Assistant is just a more approachable and helpful version of the same number of clicks and steps you always had.\n    \n    \n    Bill: Next . . . next . . .next, and pretty soon I just want the fucking clown to get out of the way.\n\nBill often had these routines or short skits that he would play out over and\nover\u2014if you were the target, it was painful the first couple of times then it\nwas for show for other attendees then you had to assert yourself. This was one\nof those. Through the entire rise and ultimate fall of the idea of an animated\ncharacter or agent, which he referred to as a \u201cclown\u201d, this pattern complete\nwith the escalating high-pitched frustrated BillG voice would make an\nappearance. I lost track of how many times he ridiculed the feature this way.\nStill, he doesn\u2019t get the right to say told-you-so.\n\nMicrosoft Fine Artist showing McZee taking over the full user experience, even\noffering to work with files. (Source: Personal Collection)\n\nThis started with the earliest products based on an animated helper that were\ndeveloped in the early 1990s and released while I was working as Technical\nAssistant, so I was quite familiar with the above routine. Then Microsoft\u2019s\nfocus was on bringing software and PCs to children and like all products for\nchildren, the general theory of education told us that products needed to be\nfun, engaging, and immersive, and different from business-oriented or grownup\nproducts.\n\nA pair of products were developed together for Windows 3, Creative Writer and\nFine Artist, a kid-oriented word-processor and drawing program. While these\nproducts were nominally about the basics of productivity, they were part of an\nentire animated world called Imaginopolis hosted by the ever-present guide,\nMcZee, a lanky purple humanoid. It is easy to be dismissive of the products,\nbut in fact they contained enormous feature-depth for the time. McZee was more\nthan just a helper, but essentially the full user interface for the products.\nAll the actions were directed through McZee.\n\nMeasuring success in the new Microsoft Kids line was difficult because the\nunit sales weren\u2019t spectacular and because everything was new and the company\nwas determined to stick with it (remember the Microsoft reputation for taking\nthree versions to get something right). The spiritual successor to these two\nproducts was an even greater product risk as it was not just for kids, but for\nthe home. The problem that needed solving was that people were buying home\ncomputers, but lacked software to do home things, like keep lists, write\nletters, track to-do items, and calendars. While there were business packages\nthat did that, the general theory was that software for the home needed to be\nmore friendly and approachable, especially because those not skilled in\nbusiness computers would use it.\n\nThe book that defined key ideas in how humans interact with computers, tv, and\nnew media as though they were real people and places. The authors were Byron\nReeves and Clifford Nass (sadly, he passed away in 2013) of Stanford who\ncontributed to Bob and Office, and collaborated with KarenFr and BarryL co-\nleaders of Bob. (Source: Personal Collection)\n\nThe Consumer Division where Microsoft Kids software came from was filled with\npeople on a mission to bring software to a broader audience. One of those was\nKaren Fries (KarenFr) who was the lead advocate and pioneer for the use of\nwhat was widely known in academic circles as social interface. Karen was co-\nleading program management for these new products and was deeply immersed in\nthe cutting-edge technology. She was a co-author of a 1994 paper \u201cSeductive\ninterfaces: satisfying a mass audience\u201d with some of the early work in the\narea. Other authors on the paper were Stanford researchers, Clifford Nass and\nByron Reeves. This was serious work with some depth. Nass and Reeves (who\nwould later consult with our efforts in Office) developed the work into a book\nThe Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like\nReal People and Places. Their research developed and provided evidence of a\ncore thesis that humans \u201ctreat computers, televisions, and new media as real\npeople and places\u201d and beyond that, humans develop models for interacting with\ntechnology and media based on how those works are designed. At the extreme,\nthis explained frustration and fear of computers because of the general belief\nthat computers are smarter than people and so interacting with them took on\nthe traits of interacting with a much smarter and less tolerant human. This is\nwhat Karen, along with her co-leader (and designer) Barry Linnet (BarryL) set\nout to fix in developing Microsoft Bob, codename Utopia. No strangers to\nmaking easy to use software, Karen and Barry co-led the creation of Microsoft\nPublisher, a very successful and much-loved entry into what was known as\ndesktop publishing, a tool for creating newsletters, certificates, menus,\nsigns, etc. aimed at home and small business users.\n\nSome of the capabilities of writing a letter with Microsoft Bob. The product\nhad significant feature depth compared to many products, all accessible\nthrough the social user interface. (Source: Personal Collection)\n\nLike McZee, Microsoft Bob was an immersive environment. The experience,\nhowever, was less kid and more home. It was still animated, and it was still\nfun. Bob was the smiley face that occupied the middle letter O of the name,\nthough within the software an ever-present puppy acted as the assistant and\nguide for using the many modules of the product. Each module was depicted as a\nplace to click on in the home\u2014click on a phone index for contacts, a pad of\npaper to write a letter, a checkbook for finances, a globe for a geography\nquiz (gosh, that was such a BillG thing), and so on. The software had even\nmore depth than the previous products. As an example, a typical home letter-\nwriting effort might be a complaint to an airline for lost luggage. Bob not\nonly contained samples, but even maintained a list of airlines and addresses\nthat it would use to pre-populate a complaint letter (and this is before the\ninternet).\n\nUnveiled at the Consumer Electronics show in January 1995, Microsoft Bob\nreceived amazingly broad and favorable press coverage. (Source: Washington\nPost, January 8, 1995)\n\nAt the January 1995 Consumer Electronics Show, Bob was launched to immense\nfanfare and broad media coverage across print and even morning television.\nThere was so much enthusiasm about home computers but before the internet\npeople were just not sure what to do with them, at least broadly. That said,\nthe product was unfortunately not well-received and ran into the buzzsaw of\ntechnologists who simply didn\u2019t buy into the shell or veneer Bob created\naround Windows.\n\nWhy was Microsoft going through all this and making these risky, or even edgy,\nproducts? Many seemed puzzled by this at the time. In order to understand that\ntoday, one must recognize that using a PC in the early 1990s (and before) was\nnot just difficult, but it was also confusing, frustrating, inscrutable, and\nby and large entirely inaccessible to most everyone unless you had to learn\nhow to use one for work. In fact, using a computer usually meant signing up\nfor an in-person class that would meet at night for a few hours over the\ncourse of several weeks\u2014often buying a computer came not with an extended\nwarranty upsell, but one of these classes. It was this era when businesses\nwould put out job opportunities for people that had 1-2 years of experience\nusing a PC, preferably Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect. These products with their\ndizzying array of keystroke commands and chorded combinations of ALT, CTRL,\nand SHIFT keys were difficult if not bordering on impossible for most people\nto master.\n\nUsing Office back then usually meant investing in after-market books such as\nsome of these (including Microsoft\u2019s own \u201cAt a Glance\u201d series). These books\noften went to 700 or more pages and were as thick as phonebooks. (Source:\nPersonal Collection)\n\nAs written previously, Windows and the graphical user-interface were supposed\nto fix all this with its easy to use menus and direct manipulation with a\nmouse. Yet the exact opposite happened because while those made accessing\ncommands easier, the number of possible commands was growing at a rapid pace.\nIt wasn\u2019t just that Word added bullets and numbering, but it added the myriad\nof options to stylize, format, and order paragraphs. And footnotes, endnotes,\npagination, hanging indent, and on and on, then Excel and PowerPoint too. In\norder to mitigate the growing complexity of the products, Office developed an\narray of bolt-on utilities from massive printed and bound books, wizards\n(pioneered in Publisher), tutorials, getting started (like a tutorial but\nshorter), even a friendly tip-of-the-day that offered a quick refresher lesson\nwhen you launched a program. It got to the point where even these various\nforms of help needed an overview to explain them. Ironically, an after-market\ndeveloped which packaged up all that information and the expertise of authors\nto create even more help. Typically, owners of Office (or even those\nconsidering owning the product) would invest in phonebook sized softcover\nbooks further explaining the use of the product. At first this seemed cool,\nthen we started to realize the futility of our own product development\nefforts.\n\nMy college recruiting talk on developing the Assistant detailed the story of\nbuilding the guru into Office in these several slides (animated). (Source:\nPersonal Collection)\n\nThe one constant, as we studied the landscape of people using Office, was that\ngetting anything done involved tracking down the nearby Office guru\u2014the person\nthat invested the time and effort to master the software more than the rest of\nthe people in the office. Need to create a table, figure out a formula, or\ndraw an org chart then go down the hall and get help from the guru.\n\nChances were high that the product did what you thought you wanted to do, but\nthe path through the maze of commands was not only difficult but fraught with\nthe risk of destroying your work or getting the document into a state that\nwould make further work even more difficult. We often would receive letters\ndetailing specific features or outcomes a customer would like to achieve, only\nto learn that the feature was already in the product.\n\nWith Office96 we set out to build the guru into Office to solve this growing\nproblem and dissatisfaction with the product. The early love of Office was\nturning into early signs of resentment as the customer-base grew. Early\nadopters loved the power of the product, but increasingly new customers felt\noverwhelmed by their lack of mastery. We had a genuine customer satisfaction\nproblem on our hands.\n\nAs we knew from Nass and Reeves research, people had confidence in the tool to\nget things done but lacked a way to interact with it to understand how unless\nthe right human guru was helping. Our challenge was to build a software\nequivalent to the guru.\n\nThat software equivalent would start with the clown as BillG called it, or\nAssistant as we called it. The name of the internal implementation of the\nAssistant, tfc in our Hungarian notation, was a hat tip to BillG\u2019s \u201cthe\nf*cking clown.\u201d Even though Bill had ridiculed each social interface product,\nwe were deep in the problem we needed to solve and optimistic we could figure\nout an approach. We needed to look no further than the computers on Star Trek,\nwhich enabled Captain Kirk and Spock to tap into the vast resources with vague\nquestions and open-ended problems. Similarly, the industry was buzzing with\nthe idea of agents that would be able to do work on your behalf such as find\ncheap airline flights or schedule meetings. Everywhere from Apple to the MIT\nMedia Lab were talking about agents. There was ample evidence this was not\nsimply a weird vision in our corner of the tech world. In fact, by some\naccounts we were in a race to have the first and best guru in the box.\n\nThe lesson from Bob was clearly that an entire immersive environment would not\nwork, plus there was no way we would do that for Office. We also knew that\nrewiring the entire interface to do everything through the step-by-step\ninteractions with the assistant would not work. Instead we wanted to combine\nthe warmth and comfort of a social experience with the kind of help the guru\nprovided in real life. While many would ultimately conclude that the paperclip\nwas simply bolted on the side of Office to provide cuteness, we made three big\ntechnology investments, even bets, to bring Clippy to market.\n\nPlease consider subscribing\n\nThe first step in asking a Guru for help was to ask a question in your own\nlanguage. The guru then maps that question to the typical answers or FAQ\n(frequently asked questions) that were known. You might ask \u201chow to print\nsideways\u201d and the guru knows to check the landscape option in the print\ndialog, or \u201chow do I hide the elephants in Word\u201d and the guru knows you are\ntalking about the pilcrow symbol, \u00b6. A typical question might be even more\nabstract such as \u201chow do I format alternating lines in a spreadsheet\" which a\nguru might point to more sophisticated features of Excel rather than some of\nthe direct formatting tools. This is precisely the technology we had developed\nand released for Office 95 as the Answer Wizard. In fact, we back-ported\nAnswer Wizard to Office 95 because it was working pretty well and did not\ndisturb the rest of the product. As mentioned previously, there was a\ncollaboration with Microsoft Research (also a group from Stanford) that led\nthis first pillar of the guru.\n\nNext, one of the things a guru does, at least a good guru, is watch over your\nshoulder when you are struggling. Often diagnosing a problem, like trying to\nalign two boxes in an org chart or get the columns of a table to be the right\nwidth, is not so much being told the right answer as much as being told which\nstep was where you went astray. We knew many tasks in Office were composed of\nmultiple steps that needed to be done in the right order, and often people\nwould try something click undo and try something else. We posited that if we\ncould track the activities as the product was used we could either proactively\nor on request (hitting the help key, F1) offer a suggestion from our library\nof help topics for how to get the right thing done. For example, if a user\nseemed to be clicking around paragraph formatting and indenting, the system\nmight know enough to suggest a help topic on formatting headings or paragraph\nspacing. And if a user was stuck, simply hitting F1 was a way to summon the\nguru using the context that was accumulated over the most recent few minutes\nof use. This was another collaboration with Microsoft Research based on some\nof early 1990s work using Bayesian math to build a model for making these\nguesses based on contextual cues. This work came out of Stanford\u2019s artificial\nintelligence lab and formed the early AI efforts in Microsoft Research. It too\nwas all the rage at the time in academic tech circles.\n\nIt was this part of Clippy that proved to be the most challenging to deliver\non the promise. Deciding when to fire off the assistant, finding that balance\nto being helpful versus annoying, is precisely what the human guru finds\nchallenging when looking over your shoulder. Too little help and the product\nremains frustrating. Too much help and the user just wants to hand the\nkeyboard over and say you do it. The artificial intelligence approach may or\nmay not have been the right technology, but it proved inadequate at the time.\nThe product had too many commands and entry points, or simply too many\ndecisions to make at any given time to be truly helpful.\n\nOne mistake, well really the mistake, was firing Assistant on the most simple\nand obvious effort in Word. The sequence of starting a new document, typing\nDear <name> and pressing return would cause the assistant to say, \u201cLooks like\nyou\u2019re trying to write a letter.\u201d And with that Clippy was forever sentenced\nto memedom (is that a word?) In our heads we thought this was OK because we\nwere already doing a tip (a yellow bar across the top of the screen) to alert\nthe user to the letter writing feature. This was really a step too far. It did\nnot help that if you clicked \u201cYes\u201d the software would launch an incredibly\ncomplicated wizard offering all sorts of options for a letter, most of which\nwent unused. A few years later, the Microsoft researcher who contributed the\nBayesian technology even turned on us in an interview with The Economist and\nsaid it was all because we didn\u2019t use enough of the technology. That really\nhurt\u2014it was as much their work as our work.\n\nThis is from The Economist, March 24, 2001 (more on this time in a future\npost). In this article you can see how at this point in the evolution of the\nfeature, failure was indeed an orphan.\n\nThe third pillar of bringing the guru to Office was to offer the user the\ncalming and comforting personality of a guru. Using a computer was difficult\nand frustrating, and we set out to bring some levity to the daily grind.\nLeaning heavily on the work of Nass and Reeves, we developed the actual\ncharacter to represent the guru\u2014to attach a personality to the source for\nanswers and tips that would encourage help. We also went a step beyond that\nand decided that the Office Assistant would be where messages (or alerts)\nwould come from. The ever-present \u201cDo you want to save this file\u201d or \u201cThe\nspell check is complete\u201d would emanate from the assistant. This was the\nbiggest and highest risk bet of the entire feature. It is also what separated\nthe feature from the previous dozen attempts at providing help\u2014it wasn\u2019t yet\nanother bolted-on tool, but it was in the flow of usage and there to help\neveryone. Internally we called this IntelliAssist.\n\nThe minute we had an animated Assistant it was obvious that any opinion or\ncontroversy about the feature would stem from the clown or character itself,\nnot the assistance provided. Starting in early 1994 we began the most\nintensive usability research testing we had done to date on a feature. The\nnumber of tests, the number of locations and languages, and design ideas we\niterated on was kind of mind-blowing. At one point people were flying to Japan\nand Europe to rerun tests to see how the results might differ. How big should\nthe assistant be, how much noise should it make (if the user even had a sound\ncard), how often should it appear, how animated should it be, and on and on.\nThe iterations were seemingly endless, all with the goal of making it friendly\nand approachable while tapping into the fancy underlying artificial\nintelligence technology.\n\nChoosing the actual character was incredibly controversial. It became\nimmediately apparent everyone had an opinion, and importantly every major\nsales geography had their own view of what would work locally. It didn\u2019t\nmatter that many animated characters worked globally, there was a strong\ndemand for input and oversight. The risk, after all, was very high. For\nexample, Japan accounted for nearly one-third of Office profits because of the\nunique market there. The lead program manager, Sam Hobson (SamH), an\nexperienced member of the Excel team who joined OPU (also a college hire like\nthe rest of us) had the perfect demeanor for managing all the connections\nacross the company.\n\nPerhaps we were naive, but we never sat around contemplating the risk the\nbusiness of doing this feature. In 1995, Platforms revenue was $2.36 billion,\nand Applications revenue was $3.58 billion\u2014even a small hiccup in Office would\nbe a huge deal. We weren\u2019t comforted in the past sales of the product, but\nrather sought the comfort of believing we were on a mission to solve an acute\ncustomer problem\u2014a problem left unchecked that could materially impact the\nbusiness. How could a product remain successful if people increasingly dislike\nit?\n\nSam created huge boards of potential characters for everyone to look at and\npick their favorite. He would lead tests at shopping malls and markets around\nthe world understanding preferences. Meanwhile, Nass and Reeves reminded us\nthese preferences were rather predictable and also not as crucial as maybe the\nsales people who saw this more as branding than utility believed. In one\nhilarious early use of these boards, Sam invited the spiritual leader (and\nthen Microsoft board member) Mike Maples to pick his favorite character. Ever\nthe rancher and Oklahoman, everyone thought Mike would pick the big dog or\nmaybe the lion or something. Instead after browsing the dozens of choices,\nMike went with. . . the pink bunny rabbit. He smiled and said it reminded him\nof the rabbits on the ranch. This kind of reaction is what led to the full\ngallery of choices. While the paper clip, Clippit aka Clippy, would be the\ndefault, we featured a dog, a cat, a happy smiling dot reminiscent of Bob, and\nseveral more including a really boring Office logo for marketing purposes. The\nscale of Japan\u2019s business required us to take their input and from that we\nended up with the highly controversial Office Lady or Saeko Sensei, which to\nmany at HQ was less than appropriate. Japan also came to love symbols of\nnature, and guided us to a Kairu, a dolphin and again there was irony in that\nchoice that made us uncomfortable. We kept those characters to the Japanese\nversion of the product. We would later add a small Macintosh-like computer\ncalled Max for Mac Office. Being Microsoft, we had an SDK and even a third-\nparty partner that could (and would) create additional assistants.\n\nThe character, like the artificial intelligence behind the first two pillars,\nhad a depth of capabilities that often go unappreciated and certainly did at\nthe time. We were severely constrained in disk space and memory, not to\nmention graphics capabilities, yet wanted to provide a reasonable animation\nexperience. This proved extremely difficult as the expectations for animation\nhad been set by cartoons.\n\nJoin the discussion \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n\nAt one point we had a most memorable opportunity to meet with the legendary\nanimators from Walt Disney, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston otherwise known as\nFrank and Ollie. Together they were involved with everything from Pinocchio to\nFantasia to Bambi and more. An example of a constraint that frustrated us was\nthe window the character was trapped in. We wanted to do a borderless\nAssistant like in Bob, but the platform constraints were too much when\noverlayed with regular Windows apps. Frank and Ollie not only relieved us of\nthat but explained how we should use the window as their stage to allow for\nentrance and exit and directional animations. They also pushed us to add a\nsidekick (think Thumper) which was something they had pioneered in animation.\nThey suggested Clippit have something like a little eraser friend. That was\nwell beyond the two dozen or so animation sequences we could have but really\nbrought us optimism for how the feature could evolve with more platform\nsupport.\n\nSound was still nascent in most PCs, constrained by the original MIDI sound\ncapabilities. Windows 95 and multimedia were changing that. We also added a\nset of sounds that came along with animations which if a user had them on made\na real difference in the experience.\n\nThese capabilities were coded throughout the product. The Assistant would\noccasionally just blink or smile or take note of work. If you stopped typing\nfor a while it might perk up and notice you. Using a technical feature would\ncome with a more substantial animation. The assistant was also programmed to\nget out of the way while you were typing or scrolling, which led to a fun game\nof chase-the-paperclip using mouse and the Excel grid as was commonly shown in\ndemonstrations.\n\nAs we tested the character in various stages behind one-way glass or in focus\ngroups, there was almost always surprise and more frequently than most would\nbelieve today praise and support for the feature. It is a clich\u00e9 for a failed\nfeature to say that it worked in early testing, but that was genuinely the\ncase.\n\nAs the product evolved, we expanded the customizability of the Assistant\nbehavior. Our belief was that we should have limited the number of options,\nbut the culture and spirit of Microsoft at the time tended to win out over\nthat more narrowly held belief, resulting in a plethora of settings. (Source:\nOffice 97, Personal Collection)\n\nStill as the project progressed there were many that were nervous or outright\nhostile. As we showed the product to the hardcore technical audience, the\nreactions were often visceral and immediate. Either people wanted to\nimmediately turn it off without much consideration or they would be thoughtful\nand suggest that it is not for them, but they could see others (read as less\ntechnical) people benefitting. As we would learn time and gain, when core\ntechnical users say that something isn\u2019t for them but for others it too often\nmeans that the feature might be good, but it is going to need to get past\nthese gatekeepers. We made a very difficult decision to provide an array of\nsettings to control the various capabilities of the Assistant. In other words,\nwe made it possible to turn it off. At the same time, we provided full\nprogrammability with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) so that developers\ncould create custom solutions with full control over the Assistant, including\nadding custom text in the balloons and choosing animations. Imagine how much\nfun that budget template in Excel could be with custom chatter from the\nAssistant!\n\nThe Assistant was one part of an enormous release of Office. The remainder of\nthis chapter details some of the other challenges in building Office 97 on the\nplatform and infrastructure described in the previous section. The product\nreviews were ultimately mixed, but hardly universal, as we will see in the end\nof this chapter.\n\nWe stuck with and improved the Assistant in the next release of Office. By the\nsecond subsequent release we retired the feature, albeit in a humorous way. In\nparallel with Office 97 an effort began to bring the Assistant to Windows for\nuse by third party developers. Microsoft Agent had much richer interactions\nusing early speech recognition and voice but lacked deeper integration with\napplications unless coded by developers. Agent was used in Windows XP and\nremained available for some years.\n\nThe journey of Clippy (in spite of our best efforts that was what the feature\ncame to be called) was one that parallels the PC for me in so many ways. It\nwas not simply a failed feature, or that back-handed compliment of a feature\nthat was simply too early like so many Microsoft features. Rather Clippy\nrepresented a final attempt at trying to fix the desktop metaphor for typical\nor normal people so they could use a computer. What everyone came to realize\nwas that the PC was a generational change and that for those growing up with a\nPC, it was just another arbitrary and random device in life that one just\nused. As we would learn, kids didn\u2019t need different software. They just needed\naccess to a PC. Once they had a PC they would make cooler, faster, and more\nfun documents with Office than we were. It was kids that loved WordArt and the\nnew graphics in Word and PowerPoint, and they used them easily and more\nfrequently than Boomers or Gen X trying to map typewriters to what a computer\ncould do. It was not the complexity that was slowing people down, but the real\nconcern that the wrong thing could undo hours of work. Kids did not have that\nfear (yet). We needed to worry less about dumbing the software down and more\nabout how more complex things could get done in a way that had far less risk.\n\nThe other lesson from the Clippy experience is clearly how amazing it was that\nMicrosoft even considered such a high-risk feature. Imagine doing a feature\nthat you know at launch will have some people significantly annoyed with you\nbut doing so also knowing that you could reach some other new customers or\nbring joy to customers that were otherwise worried. The whole business relies\non upgrading existing customers and attracting new customers when all of them\nhave an option of doing nothing or going to one of several competitors. The\nMicrosoft that made Clippy is the risk-taking company that I admired so much.\nIt was the failure of Clippy and the lack of repercussions that in a sense\nthat cemented my own connection to the company. I got way more grief outside\nthe company than inside.\n\nAnd I needed that because for the next five years of college recruiting trips,\nI would have to answer snarky questions about Clippy from college students.\nThe deepest pit in my stomach came when I was in New York on a trip at a low\npoint in the Microsoft versus DOJ trial. I turned on the hotel television for\nsome Late Night with Conan O'Brien and his opening monologue took a swipe at\nMicrosoft, \u201cCome on Bill, Microsoft got off easy compared to what the\nGovernment did to Clippy, that annoying paperclip icon that pops up in\nMicrosoft Word\u201d [emphasis added] followed by a gruesome violent act\nperpetrated against poor Clippy. That hurt. A lot. The cheers from the studio\naudience hurt even more. I was totally signed up for the risk and reviews but\nbeing mocked on my favorite late-night show. Ouch.\n\nThen one campus season, perhaps in 2002 or 2003, those snarky comments turned\ninto an expressed love of Clippy and comments like \u201cI remember Clippy on my\nmom\u2019s computer at work\u201d or \u201cI miss the Dog\u201d. That was amazing. Only that was\noutdone when about a decade later, Clippy transitioned from nostalgia to a\nhigh-tech feature that was somehow ahead of its time. I wish I could say that\nwas the case, but it was simply an idea, not an unreasonable one and not one\nwith a particularly bad execution. The implementation, however, was decidedly\n1997.\n\nEnjoyed this? Please subscribe \ud83d\ude4f\n\nOn to 043.

I think there was some legal story behind that. :)\\-\nVersion two was about getting the assistant \"out of the box\" and more\ninteractive.\\- I still have my shirt that I got from Sam Hobson with \"the\nusual suspects\" with many of the Office assistant characters in police lineup\npicture. I wear it when I feel nostalgic.\\- It feels sad for me that I helped\nput Clippy in and I helped to take him out.Expand full commentLike\n(9)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Steven Sinofsky\n\nJean Philippe BagelAug 15, 2021Liked by Steven SinofskyThere's a lesser known\nEaster egg using the Assistant, I can't remember which version.
