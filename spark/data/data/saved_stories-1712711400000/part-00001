It was the first book to use the Hindu term avatar to describe a\nvirtual representation of a person, it coined the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d, and was\none of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pieces of required reading for new executives at\nFacebook a decade before he changed the focus of the entire company to attempt\nto build Stephenson\u2019s fictional world in reality.\n\nThe plot revolves around an image that, when viewed in the metaverse, hijacks\nthe viewer\u2019s brain, maiming or killing them. In the fiction of the world, the\nimage crashes the brain, presenting it with an input that simply cannot be\ncorrectly processed.\n\nIt\u2019s a recurring idea in science fiction. Perhaps the first clear example came\nfour years earlier, in British SF writer David Langford\u2019s short story BLIT,\nwhich imagines a terrorist attack using a \u201cbasilisk\u201d, images which contain\n\u201cimplicit programs which the human equipment cannot safely run\u201d. In a sequel\nto that story, published in Nature in 1999, Langford draws earlier parallels,\neven pulling in Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus, \u201cwith its famous sketch about\nthe World\u2019s Funniest Joke that causes all hearers to laugh themselves to\ndeath\u201d.\n\nThe collective fiction project SCP coined the name for such ideas: a\ncognitohazard. An idea, the very thinking of which can be harmful.\n\nAnd one question that deserves to be taken increasingly seriously is: are\ncognitohazards real?\n\nWhat you know can hurt you\n\nWhat if labelling isn\u2019t enough? An AI-generated image of Donald Trump with\nBlack voters. Photograph: Mark Kaye/Twitter\n\nI started thinking about that question this week, as part of our reporting\ninto the efforts to automatically identify deepfakes in a year of elections\naround the world. Since 2017, when I first heard the term in the context of\nface-swapped porn, it has been possible to identify AI-generated imagery by\nexamination. But that task has got harder and harder, and now we\u2019re on the\ncusp of it being beyond the ken of even experts in the field. So it\u2019s a race\nagainst time to build systems that can automatically spot and label such\nmaterial before it breaks that threshold.\n\nBut what if labelling isn\u2019t enough? From my story:\n\n> Seeing a watermark doesn\u2019t necessarily have the effect one would want, says\n> Henry Parker, head of government affairs at factchecking group Logically.\n> The company uses both manual and automatic methods to vet content, Parker\n> says, but labelling can only go so far. \u201cIf you tell somebody they\u2019re\n> looking at a deepfake before they even watch it, the social psychology of\n> watching that video is so powerful that they will still reference it as if\n> it was fact. So the only thing you can do is ask how can we reduce the\n> amount of time this content is in circulation?\u201d\n\nCould we call such a video a cognitohazard? Something so compellingly\nrealistic that you involuntarily treat it as reality, even if you\u2019re told\notherwise, seems to fit the bill.\n\nOf course, that also describes a lot of fiction. A horror story that sticks\nwith you and leaves you unable to sleep at night, or a viscerally unpleasant\nscene of graphic violence that makes you feel physically unwell, could be a\ncognitohazard if the definition is stretched that far.\n\nThe dominoes fall\n\nPong wars, an automatically generated \u2018game\u2019 of Breakout that you will watch\nit far longer than is wise. Photograph: Koen van Gilst\n\nPerhaps closer to the examples from fiction are techniques that hijack, not\nour emotions, but our attention. Emotions, after all, are rarely under our\ncontrol at the best of times; feeling something you don\u2019t want to feel is\nalmost the definition of a negative emotion.\n\nAttention is supposed to be different. It\u2019s something we have conscious\ncontrol over. We talk of being \u201cdistracted\u201d at times, but more serious\nseizures of attention warrant increasingly medicalised language: \u201cobsession\u201d,\n\u201ccompulsion\u201d, \u201caddiction\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to TechScape\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

In a world of\nad-supported media, with businesses increasingly competing not for our money\ndirectly but for our time, inherently limited to just 24 hours a day, there\u2019s\na huge commercial motivation to grab and keep attention. Some of the tools of\nthe trade that have been developed to achieve that goal certainly feel like\nthey tap into something primal. The glaring red dots of new notifications, the\ntactility of a pull-to-refresh feed and the constant push of gamification have\nall been discussed at length.\n\nAnd some, I think, have crossed the line to become real cognitohazards. While\nthey may perhaps only be dangerous to those with a susceptibility for having\ntheir attention hijacked, the compulsion feels real.\n\nOne is a type of game: \u201cclickers\u201d or \u201cidle\u201d games, such as the critically\nfeted Universal Paperclips, condense the reward mechanics of a game down to\ntheir simplest structures. So called because they almost literally play\nthemselves, idle games present a dazzling array of timers, countdowns and\nupgrades, and constantly offer some breakthrough, improvement or efficiency\njust a couple of seconds away. I have lost whole days of productivity to them,\nas have many others.\n\nAnother is a type of content, what I\u2019ve started to think of as \u201cdomino\nvideos\u201d, are the non-interactive equivalent of an idle game. A video of some\nprocess progressing in an orderly, yet not quite fully predictable, manner,\ndrawing you in and leading to an inexorable compulsion to watch until the end.\nSometimes that\u2019s literally a domino run; other times, it might be someone\nmethodically cleaning a carpet or depilling a sweater. Sometimes the process\nmight never even complete; pong wars is an automatically generated \u201cgame\u201d of\nBreakout, with two balls each threatening to invade the others\u2019 space. It\nnever ends, but you will watch it for longer than is worthwhile.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that this is as bad as it gets. It may be that there is\nsomething inherently off-putting about true attention harvesters, that means\nthat the drive to stare at them as the progress is always going to be\ncounteracted by the shame or disgust at having wasted time.\n\nBut what if it isn\u2019t? What does it look like if generative AI is set loose on\nsocial media to truly capture attention at an industrial scale? If the advice\nthat parents give to young children isn\u2019t just to be careful of who they speak\nto on the internet, but to be wary of what they even look at?\n\nEverything is science fiction until it\u2019s reality.\n\nIf you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to\nreceive TechScape in your inbox every Tuesday.\n\nJoin Alex Hern for a Guardian Live online event about AI, deepfakes and\nelections, on Wednesday 24 April at 8pm BST.
