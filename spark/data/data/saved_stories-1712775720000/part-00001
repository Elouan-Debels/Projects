For eleven months, the Japanese\ncontinued to refine their plans while at the same time working diplomatically\nto relieve tensions with the United States. On November 26, 1941, the main\nbody of the attack force began moving toward Hawaii.\n\n[Japanese announcement of the attack at Pearl Harbor], Japan, 1941. (The\nGilder Lehrman Institute of American History, GLC09552.01 p1)\n\nShortly before 8 a.m. on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise\nattack against US armed forces in Hawaii. Japanese pilots targeted Army, Navy,\nand Marine airfields, and then naval ships at Pearl Harbor, with the aim of\ndevastating the entire US Pacific fleet. The two-hour attack left 2,403\nAmericans dead and 1,178 injured, and was followed by a formal declaration of\nwar against the United States. On December 8, after a nearly unanimous vote by\nCongress, the US formally declared war on Japan.\n\nIn this printed announcement, the Japanese government provides a detailed\naccount of its victory over the Americans at Pearl Harbor and the British in\nMalaya and Hong Kong. In addition to providing a detailed account of the\nbattles, it also served \u201cas a memento of the great work being done by this\nincomparable Empire of ours, and also as food for thought about the many\ntrials that have yet to be overcome.\u201d The first page includes illustrations\nmade from photographs taken by Japanese pilots to document the damage.\n\n### Excerpt\n\nWhat an uproar! Japan\u2019s Imperial Forces got things off to a quick start with\none splendid strike then another in historic surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor,\nwhere the bravado of the US Asia fleet met with sudden defeat, and off the\nMalaya Coast, where the main forces of the British Asia fleet were utterly\nannihilated. Word has it that Roosevelt and Churchill were shaken up and went\npale upon hearing of the defeats. In a third strike, Hong Kong Island,\nEngland\u2019s strategic base for its 100-year exploitation of East Asia, fell into\nruin in only a matter of ten days. During this time, Churchill was sent\nreeling, cutting off contact with others and showing up in Washington.\n\nWhat these two headstrong countries are striving for will only lead them on a\ndownhill path to military defeat. Our barbaric enemies are already cowering in\nfear in the Pacific, and the fall of Manila shall mark the day of the\nPhilippines\u2019 subjugation and reversion back to Greater East Asia. The enemy\npower of Singapore, which was\u2014alas\u2014boasting of its impenetrable stronghold\nbefore the Imperial Forces penetrated the jungle area of the Malay Peninsula\nand advanced southward like a raging tide, shall also vanish into nothingness\nin the midst of this glorious chapter in history.\n\nThe military gains of the glorious Imperial Forces are truly great, and the\narmy, navy, and air force should be given our heartfelt gratitude. We should\nalso honor our courageous men who are ready to lay down their lives when\ncharging enemy lines, as well as those who went out to conquer but never\nreturned.\n\nA full translation of the document is available here.
