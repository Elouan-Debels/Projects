But Revolut says \u2018no\u2019 to a refund\n\nThe company seems to hold me entirely responsible for the fact \u00a340,000 was\nstolen\n\nMiles Brignall\n\nWed 10 Apr 2024 08.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nI desperately need help after falling victim to a scam resulting in my Revolut\nbusiness account being emptied of \u00a340,000. The company is refusing a refund.\n\nIt happened in February while I was staying up a mountain in Italy with no\ninternet and a poor mobile phone signal. I declined a call from a hidden\nnumber, then took a call from my accountant asking me to pick up the phone to\nRevolut because there were \u201csome suspicious attempts to access my account\u201d.\n\nWhen they called back, I answered, believing I was talking to Revolut\u2019s anti-\nfraud staff, not least because the person had full access to my account\ndetails and was able to quote past transactions, even verification codes sent\nto confirm them.\n\nI was told they were contacting me as someone using a suspicious device was\nattempting to log into my account. After I confirmed it was not me, they said\nthey would restrict access to my account. As part of a \u201csecurity check\u201d, they\nsent two verification codes, which I read back to them.\n\nI now know I was talking to a fraudster who used these codes to set up new\npayees, and to go on and make 38 withdrawals from my account in a matter of\nminutes, cleaning out my account.\n\nSince then, I have been trying to get my money returned. I have no idea how\nthe scammers were able to gain access to my account, and I\u2019m shocked that\nRevolut\u2019s security appears to have been bypassed.\n\nI did not hand over any personal login details to anyone, so I don\u2019t\nunderstand how this happened.\n\nRevolut is refusing to share with me the selfie they say was allegedly used to\naccess the account. They also stopped trying to recover my funds after just 10\ndays.\n\nThe Metropolitan police are currently conducting an investigation.\n\nI feel the company has held me entirely responsible for the fraud, without\nlooking into its own role into how its systems were apparently overcome.\n\nWhat would you do in my shoes? LG, by email\n\nThis letter should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who has a significant sum\nheld in a Revolut account. My advice would be to move your balance to a\nconventional bank as quickly as possible \u2013 one that will probably refund you\nif you fall victim to a sophisticated scam such as this. Revolut still does\nnot have a UK banking licence.\n\nIt has confirmed to me that it will not be refunding you.\n\nRevolut is not signed up to the contingent reimbursement model code (CRM\ncode), a voluntary code for banks and financial firms that outlines when\ndefrauded customers should get back their cash. As part of this, banks have\npromised to refund scam victims who have not been unduly negligent.\n\nRevolut says: \u201cWe are sorry to hear of LG\u2019s case, and any instance where our\ncustomers have been targeted by ruthless and sophisticated criminals. Each\npotential fraud case concerning a Revolut customer is carefully investigated\nand assessed independently of other cases.\n\n\u201cWe take a data-driven approach to identify scam activity and use\nsophisticated fraud modelling for inbound and outbound transactions to protect\ncustomers from falling victim to fraud, including clear, unskippable warnings\nand direct interventions by our specialist fraud prevention teams. Revolut\nwill never phone you without first confirming via our secure in-app chat.\u201d In\neffect, it believes you were negligent.\n\nThat\u2019s all very well, but the number of complaints to Action Fraud by Revolut\ncustomers has risen from 567 in February 2023 to 1,086 for February 2024.\n\nWhat would I do in your shoes? Take the matter to the Financial Ombudsman\nService, which, I suspect, will, after a long wait, find in your favour. And\ngiven the large sum involved, you may want to hire a solicitor to help bring\nthe claim.\n\nSarah Spruce, a partner with TLW Solicitors, told me her law firm was helping\n90 Revolut fraud victims bring claims against the company.\n\nOther customers should take note of how this company operates.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
