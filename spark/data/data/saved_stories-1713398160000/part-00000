It depends on who you are, what you\u2019re building, and\nwhat you know here.\n\nWe often see founders getting it backwards. Some of the founders with the most\nexpertise are the ones who hesitate to build the thing they know the world\nneeds, while founders without much experience want to spend the next five\nyears working on their vision before talking to anyone about it.\n\nIn this episode of Dalton + Michael we talk more about this, how to know when\nyou should spend more time validating, and when to just commit.\n\nCategories\n\nvideos\n\nOther Posts\n\nOffice Hours: YC\u2019s Group Partners share advice on actually getting things done\n\nOctober 6, 2023 by Greg Kumparak\n\nRead More\n\nWhy you shouldn't copy your tech idols\n\nSeptember 13, 2023 by Dalton Caldwell\n\nRead More\n\nVideos from Startup School 2013 are now online\n\nOctober 27, 2013 by Y Combinator\n\nRead More\n\nSubscribe\n\n# Author\n\n  * ### Dalton Caldwell\n\nDalton is Managing Director, Architect and Group Partner at YC.
