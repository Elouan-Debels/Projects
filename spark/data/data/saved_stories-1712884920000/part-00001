The new architecture is structured around a centralized compute module\nwhich executes multiple applications such as Advanced Driver Assistance\nSystems (ADAS)/highly automated driving (HAD), infotainment, chassis/body\ncontrol and powertrain. The new centralized EE architecture is creating a new\ngeneration of system-on-chips (SoCs) with increased levels of integration,\nvery high performance, and increased amounts of AI to host the combined\napplications. This article highlights the trend towards an integrated ADAS/IVI\napplication enabled by a centralized compute SoC implementing automotive-grade\ninterface and processor IP.\n\nFig. 1: Evolution of electrical/electronic (EE) system architectures.\n\n## Advantages of integrating multiple automotive applications in a single SoC\n\nCombining ADAS and digital cockpit (or IVI) functionality requires the\nsimultaneous execution of ADAS applications such as automatic emergency\nbraking (AEB), adaptive cruise control, and lane keep aid (LKA) with the\ndigital cockpit applications such as pillar-to-pillar high resolutions\ndisplays. The automotive industry\u2019s decision to merge applications into\nintegrated HW may occur incrementally, targeting multiple different hybrid\napproaches. A different combination of merged applications for a centralized\nEE architecture could be to merge telematics functions with ADAS functions, or\nmultiple different hybrid platforms integrating different applications. Such\nintegrations can create new opportunities for both HW and SW suppliers.\n\nThe implementation of zonal architectures with a centralized compute module\nwill impact the compute SoCs that host the merged applications. The new\ngeneration of central compute SoCs running multiple applications require\nincreased levels of AI processing, increased numbers of cache coherent multi-\ncore 64-bit host processors, and increased levels of display processing. Due\nto the high performance and complexity to implement the compute SoCs, advanced\nsemiconductor finFET processes are required. Integrating multiple functions\ninto a central compute SoC will lower cost and minimize complexity, allowing\nautomakers, Tier 1, and Tier 2 suppliers to differentiate.\n\n## Central computer SoC requirements\n\nThe new generation of automotive central compute SoCs will have common\ncriteria, including high amounts of sensor data transported along the in-car\nnetwork and high amounts of AI using the latest AI algorithms.\n\nThe high amounts of sensor data for safety critical ADAS applications must be\ncontinuously processed in real time. Data from sensors such as radar, lidar,\nultrasonic, and camera sensors need to continuously arrive with the lowest\nlatency. The data traffic and protocols must not oversubscribe the in-car\nnetwork wiring harness. Most in-car networks using a combination of automotive\ngrade Ethernet, direct connect MIPI links for image sensors, and legacy CAN\nnetworks. Due to the amount of radar/lidar data running over automotive grade\nEthernet, multiple streams of 10G Ethernet are required for the Ethernet links\nusing the IEEE Ethernet Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol. By using the\nEthernet TSN protocol, high priority safety-critical data packets can be\ntransferred based on network policies to ensure lower priority data such as\nrear-seat entertainment does not interfere with safety-critical applications.\nFor imaging data, a high-resolution image sensor can generate over 10G of\nreal-time uncompressed data per sensor, which would overload the Ethernet\nnetwork carrying the radar/lidar data. As such, most imaging data is\ntransported using a separate MIPI interface. Several proprietary protocols\nhave been developed to transfer MIPI-based imaging data in the severe channel\nconditions in the car. In addition to proprietary data channels, the MIPI\nAlliance has developed the new 15m automotive A-PHY protocol to carry image\ndata to central compute modules. MIPI A-PHY is becoming more popular as an in-\ncar data transfer protocol.\n\nThe new generation of centralized compute SoCs must execute real-time,\nsimultaneous applications. Since multiple real-time applications are running\nsimultaneously, the processing SoCs used in the centralized compute modules\nmust support virtualization similar to high performance data center server\nprocessors. Since the SoCs must support multiple real-time applications, the\nSW stacks for the applications need to be optimized for the new generation of\nRISC-V based high-performance automotive processors. Forward planning of the\napplication SW will allow automakers to design the future software-defined\nvehicles (SDVs) and allow the introduction of new application-specific\nbusiness models. But for the high-performance SoCs targeting zonal central\ncomputing, the processors must include specialized functionality to meet the\nperformance necessary to run the real-time applications.\n\nOne key design feature for a centralized compute SoC is scalable heterogeneous\nmulticore processors with up to 12 64-bit application processors integrated\ninto the SoCs. Enabling efficient software-first development is a key goal of\nautomotive SDV suppliers, including SoC suppliers. To establish a single\nsource for automotive-grade RISC-V processors and enable compatible RISC-V\nbased products and provide reference architectures, industry suppliers such as\nBosch, Infineon, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP, and Qualcomm have formed a joint\nventure company named Quintauris. Quintauris seeks to enable the next-\ngeneration of SDV-compatible HW development by advancing the adoption of\nautomotive RISC-V deployments.\n\nTo execute the AI algorithms required for safety critical ADAS applications\nalong with AI-based IVI applications such as Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS)\nand Occupant Monitoring Systems (OMS), the SoCs need additional deep learning\nAI accelerators. The addition of generative AI allows the IVI suppliers to\noffer natural language digital assistants, which place additional AI workloads\non the central compute modules. OEMs are using AI for multiple applications in\nADAS/HAD such as path planning, object/scene detection, and recognition and\nAI-based decisions making. The ADAS/HAD applications previously mentioned,\nsuch as automatic emergency braking, lane keep aid, and adaptive cruise\ncontrol, are all AI based.\n\nFigure 2 shows a general example for a central compute SoC for merging ADAS\nand IVI applications. The discrete SoC shown on the left contains up to 12\n64-bit application processors and an AI-based vision subsystem for camera-\nbased AI applications. In addition to the required processing performance, the\nSoC contains a separate ISO 26262 functional safety manager and an independent\nsecurity subsystem to minimize security vulnerabilities. A complete suite of\nconnectivity interfaces including automotive grade Ethernet TSN provides\nmultiple channels to connect to the SoC to the in-car zonal network, as well\nas to the additional point-to-point protocols such as MIPI. The central\ncompute SoC includes a PCI Express (PCIe) interface to expand the processing\nperformance of the SoC by adding separate SoC accelerators to achieve multi-\nSoC performance. PCI Express is the dominant peripheral protocol to connect\nmultiple SoCs, which adds AI algorithm accelerators to increase SoC\nperformance.\n\nFig. 2: Central compute processor SoC.\n\nConsidering the amount of virtualized applications processing, AI acceleration\nand DSP processing required to host the merged ADAS/IVI applications, the\ncentral compute module will require advance semiconductor manufacturing to\nimplement the SoCs. To meet the functional, integration, and performance\ntargets, advanced finFET class semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as\nautomotive-grade 5nm, is required. Industry leaders are already planning their\nadoption strategy for the automotive-grade 3nm foundry process to implement\nthe merged ADAS/IVI compute SoCs.\n\nThe right side shows an alternative implementation using a UCIe-based multi-\ndie solution. Multi-die design using UCIe connects the various heterogeneous\ndie to provide a number of benefits for a merged ADAS/IVI central compute\nmodule. UCIe-based multi-die design provides the ability to choose the optimum\ntechnology node and design style for each functional die. The opportunity to\nmix-and-match the die provides flexibility in product management and reduces\ntime to market. Since the UCIe protocol is an industry standard, it ensures\neach die interface will be interoperable and ensures success with minimal\nrisk.\n\n## Summary\n\nDesigners are leveraging automotive-grade IP to integrate the required\nfunctionality to merge ADAS and IVI applications in the new zonal\narchitecture, ensuring lower cost and higher performance, robust\nfunctionality, and low power requirements. Industry leading 64-bit RISC-V\nbased processors and interface IP such as PCI Express, LPDDR, MIPI, and\nEthernet with TSN features that are compliant with the ISO 26262 functional\nsafety standard provide the compute requirements that SoCs must implement for\nthe next stage of centralized EE architecture.\n\n3 Shares\n\nTags: automotive automotive Ethernet EE architectures Synopsys time-sensitive\nnetworking\n\n### Ron DiGiuseppe\n\n(all posts) Ron DiGiuseppe is a senior automotive IP segment manager.
