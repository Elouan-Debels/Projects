Veterinarians share insights and\npet safety tips\n\nBy Aliza Chasan\n\nUpdated on: April 8, 2024 / 4:54 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nFarm animals confused during eclipse\n\nFarm animals were scared and confused during total solar eclipse 01:30\n\nWith around 180 million people living in or near the 2024 solar eclipse path\nof totality, many pet owners have been wondering how the eclipse may impact\nanimal behaviors and how their pets might react.\n\nVeterinarians said they've been fielding questions from some concerned pet\nowners about the eclipse's impact on animals. Ultimately, there isn't a clear\nanswer for pet owners because eclipses happen so infrequently. Researchers did\nplan to watch animal reactions during the April 8 eclipse to learn more about\nhow it affects animals.\n\n\"There's not a lot of scientific research done on this topic of animals and\neclipses mostly because they don't come often,\" said American Kennel Club\nChief Veterinary Officer Dr. Jerry Klein. \"And a lot of it's just been\nanecdotal reports and just volunteering information.\"\n\n## How does a solar eclipse affect animals?\n\nThough there isn't a lot of information out there, veterinarians and animal\nresearchers do have some idea how the eclipse may impact dogs, cats and more.\n\n\"Most animals will be overall unaffected by the eclipse, but pet owners may\nnotice brief periods of confusion, and dogs and cats may exhibit fear and\nconfusion,\" said Dr. Katie Krebs, a veterinarian and professor at University\nof Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nPets may hide, howl, pace or pant during the eclipse, Krebs said. As the sky\ndarkens, some pets may start their nighttime routine early.\n\nThe average indoor dog or cat is likely not going to be affected by the\neclipse, said Dr. Rebecca Greenstein, veterinary expert with pet care company\nRover.\n\n\"So owners should take heart and take comfort in knowing that,\" Greenstein\nsaid.\n\n## Why do solar eclipses affect animals?\n\nIt's not so much the eclipse that affects pets, but the behavior of people,\nKlein said.\n\n\"They'll take their cues from us,\" Klein said. \"So if they're kept indoors and\nwe don't try to force them into a situation that's peculiar, there should be\nminimal to none as far as reactions.\"\n\nMany people will gather at eclipse parties and those large gatherings can\nimpact pets if they're brought along, Klein said. The travel, noise and crowds\ncan be stressful for animals.\n\nSome animals that depend more on the light-dark cycle, like birds, may be more\naffected because the sky will darken during the eclipse, Krebs said.\n\n\"Things like fireworks and thunderstorms are probably a much more significant\nphenomenon than an eclipse that's lasting only a few minutes,\" Greenstein\nsaid.\n\n## Can animals look at the eclipse without going blind?\n\nAnimals generally know not to stare at the sun themselves \u2014 they've learned\nthat doing so can temporarily blind them, leaving them vulnerable.\n\n\"Dogs know that if something hurts them, they probably shouldn't do it,\" said\nKlein. \"So left to their own devices, dogs are probably not going to stare at\nthe sun.\"\n\nPets may look up if they see the people around them are preoccupied with\nlooking up at the sky, vets said.\n\n\"Dogs follow your cues, so if you're preoccupied with looking up, your dog is\nlooking to your cues to figure out how to behave,\" Greenstein said. \"So this\nmay be a time to either not bring them along, or if you are, to reassure them\nwith their favorite toy or treat and just keep them preoccupied with what's\ngoing on at ground level.\"\n\nA dog wears eclipse glasses in New York City as people gather to see the solar\neclipse on April 8, 2024.

Eclipse\nglasses that have scratches or punctures should not be used.\n\n## Should you keep your pets inside or outside during the solar eclipse?\n\nVeterinarians agree that it's likely best to keep pets inside during the\neclipse, especially if they're stressed by crowds or events like storms or\nfireworks.\n\n\"If possible, keep them indoors in a comfortable environment where they will\nfeel more secure because the feeling of this is probably the most important\nthing,\" Klein said.\n\nOwners planning to go to eclipse events should be respectful of their pet's\nboundaries.\n\n\"Not all animals do well with large crowds or with you being distracted with\nother things, so leaving them at home or calling a trusted pet sitter are\nprobably the best bet,\" Greenstein said.\n\nAt home, owners can try distracting a pet with a favorite toy, vets said. Pets\nwho are often anxious may benefit from anti-anxiety medication during the\neclipse, but owners should check with their veterinarian for specifics before\ngiving their dog or cat any medication, Krebs said.\n\n\"If you plan to stay home during the eclipse, your pet may seek out extra\nattention or comfort, so providing them with extra comfort and reassurance may\nhelp,\" Krebs said.\n\n## More pet safety tips to keep in mind\n\nIf you've decided to take your dog to an eclipse event, it's important to make\nsure they're microchipped with current info in case they get stressed and run\naway, Klein said. While there, make sure they're well controlled on a leash.\n\n\"By and large, we're not thinking this represents any major danger, but\ndefinitely pet owners should use their judgment,\" Greenstein said.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nBill Nye shares tips for eclipse: \"Be in the moment\"\n\nCouple gets engaged on flight to see total solar eclipse\n\nHow to find the best tax relief company\n\n5 reasons to invest in gold amid rising inflation\n\nJessica Alba steps down from position at Honest to pursue new endeavors\n\nIn:\n\n  * Eclipse\n\nAliza Chasan\n\nAliza Chasan is a digital producer at 60 Minutes and CBSNews.com.
