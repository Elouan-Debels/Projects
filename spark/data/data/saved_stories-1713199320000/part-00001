It's a little behind schedule as the\ndevelopers decided to rebuild all its packages because of the xz/liblzma\nsecurity hole, which the Reg covered last month.\n\nSome of the new features are things that will also be in other distros:\n\"Noble\" includes GNOME 46, which we looked at in February, and is based on\nkernel 6.8, which after some delays of its own finally d\u00e9buted last month. As\nusual, Canonical has customized the experience more than many distros with a\ndozen preloaded extensions, of which four are active by default: its dock,\napplication indicators, desktop icons, and a Windows-inspired tiling assistant\nwhich can tile windows into quarters of the screen. GNOME still breaks this\ngrumpy old vulture's muscle memory, but Ubuntu's configuration is one of the\nbetter ones.\n\nIf you do a clean install, one of the first things you'll see is the new\ninstallation program. It offers some accessibility options right at the\nbeginning, which is always good, and asks if you have a YAML file with which\nto customize the setup. Feed it the URL to your ready-rolled config and it\nwill do the rest, which will be handy if you're deploying multiple machines.\nAlso YAML-driven is the Netplan network-configuration tool, which hits version\n1.0 in this release. Those who prefer static IPs and to manage their own DNS\nmay well like this release even less than before.\n\nDespite GNOME's quest for simplicity, the Settings app now has many more\nsubscreens. You'll need that Search box (click to enlarge)\n\nThis version defaults to a minimal installation, so if you want the extra\napplications which Ubuntu used to include as standard, such as LibreOffice,\nemail, chat and media clients, you must choose the \"extended selection.\" If\nyou do, there are some changes: Thunderbird is now a Snap package, the Cheese\nwebcam viewer has been replaced, and the GNOME Games compilation has gone.\nEven so, the Noble beta is a whopping 5.64GB download.\n\nThis release has a new app-store called the Ubuntu App Center, which focuses\non Snap applications \u2013 this version 1.0.0 doesn't handle plain old .deb\npackages at all. Canonical continues to lean into its controversial snap\npackaging format, and in Noble, the Thunderbird email client is now packaged\nthis way. However, its new Core Desktop offering, planned to appear with this\nrelease, hit some delays some months back and won't be included.\n\nUbuntu pre-installs so many GNOME extensions we needed a bigger screen mode to\nshow the whole list (click to enlarge)\n\nAlongside the new App Center, there's also a Firmware Update tool app\nincluded. This is good news: a lot of weird little problems faced by people\nrunning anything other than Windows can be resolved by just updating the\nsystem firmware. In his prior role, the Reg FOSS desk inherited a desktop\nworkstation that was still on its 1.0 ROM, and updating bumped that by some 17\nreleases and took about three minutes off the time it took to POST. Although\nwidely neglected, it's well worth doing. We suspect that like most Linux\nfirmware tools, though, this will only work if you boot in UEFI mode.\n\nIn theory, the newer kernel and drivers will mean that Noble performs better\non newer hardware. Saying that, though, a full (\"Extended\") installation of\nthe beta version takes about 11GB of disk space and a gig of RAM at idle. This\nis not an especially lightweight distro any more, and will need a capable PC\nto perform well. It defaults to a Wayland session, and we saw screen\ncorruption issues in VirtualBox using the guest additions from Ubuntu's own\nrepository.\n\n  * Virtually and actually, LXC 6 and Incus 6 are here \u2013 both LTS versions\n  * SiFive is back with another 64-bit RISC-V dev board \u2013 hopefully\n  * Easy-to-use make-me-root exploit lands for recent Linux kernels. Get patching\n  * Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n\nIf you're running the previous LTS, you won't get nagged to upgrade until\n24.04.1 is out in a few months' time. We definitely do not recommend upgrading\nworking systems to it yet, nor should you run beta releases in production. If\nyou're that impatient for the latest components \u2013 and you don't want Ubuntu\nPro \u2013 then either run interim releases, or a different distro.\n\nWe suspect that some folks running the current LTS may hit some difficulties \u2013\nindeed, those running the HWE stack may already be having problems. If you\nhave an nVidia card, most of nVidia's legacy drivers won't install or run\nproperly on kernel 6.8. This vulture owns several older Thinkpad laptops with\non-board nVidia GPUs and nVidia Optimus switching. These nVidia chips can't be\nreplaced, but they no longer work with kernel 6.5 in Ubuntu 23.10... which was\npushed out to 22.04 users earlier this year.\n\nThe desktop is starting to feel a little cramped at a mere 1024\u00d7768 resolution\n(click to enlarge)\n\nWe didn't realize this at the time, but we think that was the cause of the\ndisplay corruption we saw while upgrading to 23.10 on a Thinkpad T420. This\nmeans they'll never work properly with Wayland, either, as it needed much more\nrecent nVidia drivers. Although still very capable, these are decade-old\nmachines now, and we suspect Canonical isn't testing against anything that\nold. They have far better keyboards than any newer Lenovo offerings, so it's\nsad to see them hit the end of their useful lives. To be fair, it's not really\nCanonical's fault: the issues are not confined to Ubuntu, and the machines\ndon't work with Debian 12 either, let alone any distros with even newer\ncomponents.\n\nAfter its abbreviated release cycle, Ubuntu \"Noble\" should be out by about the\n24th of April, along with all its official remixes. If you want to monitor\nprogress, the work-in-progress release notes for 24.04 will tell you more. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * GNOME\n  * Ubuntu\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * GNOME\n  * Ubuntu\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Elementary OS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Canonical\n  * Debian\n  * GNU\n  * Linux\n  * Operating System\n\n#### More about\n\n8 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * GNOME\n  * Ubuntu\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * GNOME\n  * Ubuntu\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Elementary OS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Canonical\n  * Debian\n  * GNU\n  * Linux\n  * Operating System\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n\nIn happier news, Ubuntu Pro extended support now goes up to 12 years\n\nSecurity18 days | 18\n\n#### Fresh version of Windows user-friendly Zorin OS arrives to tempt the\nLinux-wary\n\nAdding extra shine to Ubuntu Jammy... with the lightweight edition to follow\n\nOSes1 month | 109\n\n#### Miracle WM, a new tiling window manager built on Mir\n\nTry preliminary version of a new environment in a snap\n\nOSes2 months | 20\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### GNOME 46 beta has more tweaks than a coffee shop\n\nThe future desktop of Ubuntu 24.04 and Fedora 40 is nearly ready\n\nOSes2 months | 15\n\n#### Ubuntu, Kubuntu, openSUSE to get better installation\n\nFedora, though, won't \u2013 until at least the version after next\n\nOSes2 months | 37\n\n#### KDE 6 misses boat to make it into Kubuntu 24.04\n\n'Noble Numbat' users will face a major post-install upgrade, which isn't ideal\n\nOSes2 months | 14\n\n#### Canonical reveals more details about Ubuntu Core Desktop\n\nUbuntu Summit This new entrant in the immutable space is not a replacement for\nordinary Ubuntu\n\nOSes5 months | 34\n\n#### Ubuntu for Arm64 laptops (plus RISC kit)\n\nUbuntu Summit Did you know there's an Asahi flavored Ubuntu?
