A father and three kids\nwere missing. Then the story got darker\u2014and stranger.\n\nBy Dan Kois\n\nApril 09, 20245:40 AM\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\nThe waves were already crashing over the Toyota\u2019s hood when they found it.\n\nIt was a blustery September Sunday in 2021, and the Hilux pickup sat far down\nthe gray sand in a remote cove on the wild west coast of New Zealand\u2019s North\nIsland. The M\u0101ori men who noticed the car live in mobile homes and cabins up\nby the road, on ancestral land near Kiritehere Beach. The truck was parked\nbelow the high-tide line, facing the sea, and was nearly swamped by the waves\npummeling the shore. The men found the keys, tucked under the driver\u2019s-side\nfloormat, and backed the car up the beach. They couldn\u2019t help but notice empty\nchild seats strapped into the back. If any kids had gotten close to the sea on\na day like this, they were long gone.\n\nThe truck, it would turn out, belonged to Tom Phillips, the son of a prominent\nP\u0101keh\u0101\u2014white\u2014family with a farm nearby in Marokopa. Phillips, 34, spent much\nof his time on the farm, where he home-schooled his three kids, Jayda, 8,\nMaverick, 6, and Ember, 5. He\u2019d separated from his wife three years before and\nhad custody of the kids. Locals heard she was down on the South Island,\nstruggling with her own problems.\n\nNow here was his truck, marooned. The next morning, Tom\u2019s brother Ben drove\ndown to the beach. He\u2019d last seen Tom and the kids on Saturday, Sept. 11, when\nthey\u2019d left the farm, heading, everyone thought, back to \u014ctorohanga, the\ninland town where Tom kept a house. Now it was Sept. 13. Ben inspected the\nToyota, then called the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon photos of the missing father and his three smiling children were in every\nnewspaper and on every TV channel in New Zealand. Police and volunteer\nsearchers fanned out over the area, knocking on doors. Helicopters, planes,\nand heat-detecting drones flew over the deep bush surrounding the beach.\nRescue boats and jet skis buzzed through the roaring waves, looking for\nbodies. On days the sea was calm, swimmers from surf rescue teams explored\ncaves along the shoreline. The local hap\u016b, or M\u0101ori clan, cooked hot meals for\nthe searchers in a shed near the beach. Three days into the search, Phillips\u2019\nex-wife released a careful statement through the police, thanking the\nsearchers for their efforts. \u201cWe are holding out every hope that my children\nJayda, Maverick, and Ember are safe,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the stark facts\u2014the lonely car on the beach, the 8-foot waves, Tom and the\nchildren vanishing completely\u2014were daunting. \u201cI do fear the worst,\u201d Tom\u2019s\nsister, Rozzi Pethybridge, told a reporter. \u201cI am worried a rogue wave has\ncaught one of the kids and he\u2019s gone in to save them.\u201d Phillips\u2019 uncle seemed\nto be hinting at something even darker when he told another reporter that in\nsome ways he hoped it had been a rogue wave: \u201cIf something has happened to the\nchildren, the best-case scenario is that they were washed out to sea,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThat way it\u2019s an accident.\u201d\n\nSeptember in New Zealand, the height of Southern Hemisphere spring, is\nwhitebaiting season, when locals set up nets at the river mouth to capture the\nshoals of immature fish headed back to their freshwater home. But during the\nsearch operation, authorities placed a r\u0101hui, a ban, on fishing. Some Marokopa\nresidents grumbled about halting what had been a boom season. But others put\nthings in perspective. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of the whitebaiting,\u201d one local told a\nreporter, \u201cbut that\u2019s small-time compared with losing a family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn social media and on Reddit, observers seized on rumors of a custody dispute\nand spun out dark theories of an abduction or staged disappearance. Phillips\nwas an experienced bushman, camper, and hunter. In passing, locals told\nreporters that if Phillips had taken the kids out into the wild for some\nreason, they were confident he could last for weeks or months out there, even\nwith three children in tow. A week into the search, family members seemed to\nbe pinning their hopes on this idea. \u201cWe\u2019re looking on the bright side,\u201d the\nuncle told Radio New Zealand. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping he\u2019s just gone and hidden in the\nbush.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter 12 days of active searching, the police stood down. The whitebaiting\nr\u0101hui was lifted. Emergency services personnel moved out of the Marokopa\ncommunity building on the banks of the river. Other than the Toyota, not a\nsingle sign had been found of the four missing Phillipses. The media continued\ncovering the case, but there wasn\u2019t much to say\u2014everyone understood that until\nbodies washed up somewhere, it was unlikely there would be any further news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one knew that the disappearances were just the beginning of an ordeal that\nhas not yet ended\u2014a case that has only grown stranger and more ominous in the\ntwo and a half years since, prompting pleas from family, increasing public\nastonishment, online speculation, a shocking crime, and a community\u2019s closing\nranks around one of its own.\n\nBack in September 2021, the real mystery started when the first one was\nsolved. Because 17 days after they had been reported missing, Tom Phillips and\nhis three children walked through the front door of his parents\u2019 farm.\n\nThe Tom Phillips disappearance captivated New Zealand. But the incident never\nreached the 24/7 fever pitch of blanket coverage that would have characterized\nthe story if it had happened in the United States. In part that\u2019s because\nthere\u2019s no CNN-style 24-hour news channel in New Zealand, though pretty much\nevery outlet in the country sent a reporter to the west coast in hopes of\ndigging something up. But no one had much to say. Phillips\u2019 uncle spoke to\npress during the search, but other members of the Phillips clan stuck to the\nfarm and stayed away from television cameras. The police delivered a daily\nbriefing most afternoons, which never offered any new information. The\nchildren\u2019s mother remained unnamed. Reporters were unable to reveal details of\nthe couple\u2019s custody disputes, because family courts in New Zealand strictly\nprohibit media from reporting on their proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven after Phillips and his children returned, there was no footage of the\nhappy family waving from the front porch, no soft-focus newsmagazine\ninterviews, no morning-show feature. Phillips never spoke to the press. The\nfamily issued a statement\u2014\u201cTom is remorseful, he is humbled, he is gaining an\nunderstanding of the horrific ordeal he has put us through\u201d\u2014and Pethybridge\ngave a brief interview to the New Zealand Herald in which she seemed shell-\nshocked by the situation. \u201cHope dwindled and we became more and more resigned\nand sad,\u201d she said. Now, she added, she could \u201csmile and laugh for the first\ntime in three weeks, and not feel bad if you have a little smile.\u201d\n\nThe Phillips kids: from left, Maverick, Jayda, and Ember. Courtesy of NZ\nPolice\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe did not, however, smile once in the entire interview. The family closed\nranks, and reporters were stuck combing social media for clues. (\u201cPethybridge\nalso shared a song titled \u2018Hey Brother\u2019 by Swedish DJ Avicci,\u201d one report\nnoted.)\n\nThe residents of Marokopa, too, had little to say once the children were safe,\none reporter told me. \u201cAfter he was found, no one wanted to talk,\u201d said Karen\nRutherford of Newshub. \u201cHe has put people through the wringer, to be honest.\u201d\nAfter all, what had all that work been for? They\u2019d served meals to rescuers,\nopened the community center 24/7. Many residents had tramped along the\nshoreline, looking for bodies. Even after the police had called off the\nsearch, members of the local hap\u016b went out every day. Then it turned out that\nPhillips simply had not bothered to tell anyone he was taking the children to\nthe deep bush, pitching a tent 15 kilometers south of the beach where his car\nwas found. \u201cHe\u2019s done this before. It\u2019s not the first time,\u201d a local farmer\nsaid. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to have him back, but he should be held accountable. What\nwas he thinking?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd why had he left the car there, anyway? Though one friend suggested that\nthe pickup had been stolen by joyriding kids, most everyone assumed that\nPhillips had parked on the beach to throw searchers off the trail. But for\nwhat purpose? Some noted Pethybridge\u2019s comment that Phillips was in \u201ca\nhelpless place\u201d and wanted to \u201cclear his head.\u201d A Reddit user mused: \u201cIt\u2019s one\nthing for him wanting to clear his head but what about the kids? Hope they\u2019re\nOK, might need some therapy stat.\u201d Others leaped in to assure everyone that a\ntrip to the bush was just what any kid needed: \u201cGoing camping with dad and\nforgetting about the rest of the world would be pretty sweet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s a long tradition in New Zealand of valorizing backcountry\nadventure\u2014getting lost in the bush for a while\u2014shared by parents and children.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Man Alone thing,\u201d the Auckland education researcher Stuart McNaughton\ntold me, referring to the 1939 novel by John Mulgan still viewed by many as\nessential to understanding the \u201cKiwi character.\u201d \u201cGetting on with stuff,\ntaming a difficult environment, getting hurt in the process.\u201d To many New\nZealanders, a proper father figure is a guy who knows how to handle the\nwilderness, a place where increasingly citified Kiwi kids seem less and less\ncomfortable. McNaughton summarized the attitude: \u201cIf they\u2019re gonna have an\naccident, they\u2019re gonna have an accident\u2014it\u2019ll probably do them good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe modern urtext on this subject is Taika Waititi\u2019s 2016 comedy Hunt for the\nWilderpeople, still the most successful locally produced film in the nation\u2019s\nhistory. In the movie, a troubled M\u0101ori kid from the Auckland streets bonds\nwith a brusque P\u0101keh\u0101 outdoorsman in the deep bush. The movie\u2019s villain is a\nmaniacal child protection officer who hunts them down\u2014the overweening nanny\nstate, in the flesh. It\u2019s based on a book by the late Barry Crump, famous for\nhis reputation as a rugged bloke; New Zealanders know him best for his long-\nrunning ads for the Toyota Hilux ute, the official truck of\nbushmen\u2014unsurprisingly, the truck Tom Phillips owned and parked on Kiritehere\nBeach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter he returned, Phillips was charged with wasting police resources and\nordered to appear in court. He was \u201creckless as to whether wasteful deployment\nof police resources would result,\u201d the charges read. He \u201cbehaved in a manner\nthat was likely to give rise to serious apprehension for the safety of\nhimself, Jayda Phillips, Ember Phillips and Maverick Phillips, knowing that\nsuch apprehension would be groundless.\u201d The charges carried a maximum penalty\nof three months in jail or a $2,000 fine.\n\nIn neighborhood Facebook groups and on playgrounds across New Zealand, parents\ndebated the news. How dare this screw-up risk the lives of searchers and\nterrify his family because he hadn\u2019t bothered to tell anyone where he was\ngoing. Shouldn\u2019t he at least pay the government back for what it spent on that\nsearch plane? Or: How dare the government charge a parent for going camping\nwith his children! Wasn\u2019t he the kind of throwback dad we didn\u2019t see enough of\nanymore, as modern kids become coddled and soft?\n\nI was certainly sympathetic to this second argument. I\u2019d taken my own family\nto New Zealand to live for a period in 2017, specifically to capture that\nspirit of adventure, something that felt sorely lacking in our suburban\nAmerican lives. Our daughters\u2014just a little older than Phillips\u2019 kids were\nwhen they disappeared\u2014rarely left their comfort zones, and no one we knew let\ntheir children roam our neighborhood freely. We hoped that New Zealand might\nhelp shake us up. I was no bushman like Tom Phillips, but the four of us did\ngo tramping across graywacke streams, into the forest primeval, even along a\nremote shore that looked quite a bit like the Marokopa coast. Unlike Phillips,\nI told my friends where we were going, but still: Were the police really\ncharging this guy for giving his kids what might have been a wondrous\nadventure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReporters, struggling to advance the story, asked experts what they thought\nabout it all. One family lawyer admitted he knew nothing about the children\u2019s\ncustody arrangement but said, \u201cIf there was no parenting order, and he was\njust going on holiday, legally he\u2019s done nothing wrong.\u201d The same outlet asked\na \u201chuman rights lawyer\u201d what she thought about a parent taking children out\ninto the deep bush without letting anyone know. \u201cIt\u2019s not best practice,\u201d she\nreplied, in a tone I could almost hear from the page.\n\nTom Phillips. Courtesy of NZ Police\n\nThen, in December, as summer vacation season began, the New Zealand Herald\nfound a Facebook post\u2014seemingly from someone close to the children\u2019s\nmother\u2014stating that Phillips had once again taken his kids on walkabout. \u201cHe\nnotified family of where he was going,\u201d the local police commander said in\nresponse. \u201cIn terms of current court restrictions of what he can and can\u2019t do,\nhe\u2019s doing nothing wrong.\u201d Commenters online were aghast that the paper had\npursued the story. \u201cSo this is just literally a man taking his kids camping?\u201d\none wrote. \u201cCorrect,\u201d replied another. \u201cHis ex-missus has gone to NZH and\nthey\u2019ve run with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhillips\u2019 scheduled court date was Jan. 12, 2022. That morning, reporters\npacked the tiny wooden courthouse in Te K\u016biti, lured by the chance to finally\nask questions of the enigmatic father who had made news and driven debate\nacross the country for months. More media spilled onto Queen Street outside,\npacing in the warm summer sun.\n\nTom Phillips never showed up. Appearing via video, his lawyer told the judge\nthat he\u2019d informed his client of the appearance date and never spoken to him\nagain. He also asked to withdraw as counsel in the case.\n\nThe judge issued a warrant for Phillips\u2019 arrest. But the police couldn\u2019t\nlocate Phillips or his three children. They had disappeared into the bush. And\nthis time, they didn\u2019t come back.\n\nWhen I spoke to New Zealanders in the months after the second disappearance of\nTom Phillips, it was clear that some in the country still viewed him as a kind\nof quirky folk hero who\u2019d taken his kids out into the wilderness to avoid the\noppressive, overreaching government. \u201cThere was a lot of talk like that,\u201d said\nMax Baxter, the mayor of \u014ctorohanga, where Phillips\u2019 house sat empty, weeds\ngrowing over his fence. \u201cHe felt that his personal protection of the children\nwas paramount, and the result was that he was opening them up to experiences\nthat kids nowadays don\u2019t get. He\u2019s teaching them to be bushmen.\u201d He laughed.\n\u201cMy grown children probably couldn\u2019t survive two weeks in the bush!\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people are like, \u2018Leave him alone, those kids are probably having\nthe time of their lives,\u2019 \u201d said Karen Rutherford, the New Zealand reporter\nwho got the only on-camera interview with Phillips\u2019 ex-wife. But others, she\ntold me, felt that \u201cnow he\u2019s skipped court he\u2019s stuffed all his chances of\nbeing a good dad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the United States, I felt my admiration of Phillips wash away like the road\nto Marokopa as heavy rains swept through the region. Was he really hiding his\nkids in the bush during this kind of weather? The children\u2019s mother made a\npublic appeal for assistance in May, as New Zealand winter approached. Other\nrelatives on the mother\u2019s side launched an online petition urging police to do\nmore. They complained that Phillips\u2019 parents were refusing to let anyone onto\ntheir enormous Marokopa compound to search the wilderness around the farm\u2014or\nthe baches, the guesthouses the family used to rent out to tourists.\n\nThe Phillips family remained silent objects of fascination for the news media.\nOn the day of Phillips\u2019 courthouse no-show, his mother had told reporters\nassembled outside the gates of the family farm, \u201cI am trespassing all media\nfrom this property.\u201d According to one outlet, asked if she knew where her son\nwas, \u201cJulia Phillips simply answered with a shrug and a smile.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re real sort of rugged, coast-y people who don\u2019t come into town much,\u201d a\nlocal reporter told me. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of unusual. You\u2019d call them rednecks, I\nthink.\u201d (Being \u201ccoastal\u201d has a very different connotation in New Zealand than\nit does in the U.S.) Tony Wall, a reporter for the newsmagazine Stuff, told me\nthat Phillips\u2019 parents have been \u201cvery uncooperative. If you read between the\nlines, it definitely seems like they know something but they\u2019re not telling\nus.\u201d\n\nSomeone, everybody assumed, was shopping for supplies and ferrying them out to\nPhillips, wherever he was hiding out. \u201cIt\u2019s almost unfathomable to think a\nfather could survive with three small children without someone buying them\nsupplies,\u201d Baxter told me. \u201cBut what\u2019s the endgame? I\u2019m looking out my window\nnow, and it\u2019s pouring down rain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of urgency on the part of Waikato police was often commented upon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strange,\u201d one reporter who\u2019s been covering the case said. \u201cThe cops\nare not pouring any resources into looking for him and those children. I think\nthey are of the view that he\u2019s not going to hurt them and he\u2019ll eventually\ncome out.\u201d The department responded to press requests with a not-particularly-\ninspiring statement: \u201cPolice continue to make enquiries to establish the\nwhereabouts of Tom Phillips, who we believe is currently with his three\nchildren. While Police understand the ongoing interest in this matter, we will\nnot be disclosing the details of the enquiries that are under way.\u201d\n\nWhatever enquiries were under way, that cold and wet winter passed with no\nsign of Tom Phillips. As 2022 turned into 2023, Phillips and his children had\nbeen missing without a trace for more than a year. Then came the bank robbery.\n\nThe two figures were dressed in all black\u2014motorcycle helmets, puffer jackets,\nand boots\u2014when they walked into the ANZ bank branch less than half a mile from\nthe courthouse in Te K\u016biti, just before noon on May 16, 2023. When the bank\u2019s\nanxious staff asked them to take their helmets off, the pair displayed guns\nand demanded money. Tellers quickly gave them cash and, within moments, the\npair ran out the front door.\n\nAs the robbers hurried down Rora Street, one witness later said they were\ndropping cash out of their pockets, \u201cheaps of $50 notes.\u201d The street was\nstrewn with money. The confused passerby asked one of them, a slight figure\nwhom they described as \u201ca girl,\u201d if she needed help picking up the money. Up\nahead, the girl\u2019s companion\u2014a man, it seemed\u2014turned back to look at what was\nhappening. Right then, he was tackled to the ground by the owner of the\nSuperValue supermarket they\u2019d been hurrying past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtesy of NZ Police\n\nSuddenly, the girl brandished her gun. The passerby backed away. Someone\ncalled, \u201cFire the gun!\u201d No one\u2019s quite clear who did what, or whom they were\naiming at, but someone did fire, more than once. The passerby froze in their\ntracks, and the supermarket owner retreated.\n\nThe robbers ran past a vape shop and around a corner to a parking lot, where\nthey climbed onto a motorbike and rode off to the north. Behind them, bank\nnotes littered the pavement, 20s and 50s\u2014as much as $1,000, one witness\nestimated.\n\nThe armed robbery shocked the town, which bills itself as the nation\u2019s\nsheepshearing capital. A week later, the robbery led a Waikato Times feature\nabout growing youth crime concerns in Te K\u016biti, full of nervous quotes from\nresidents and shop owners about meth, burglary, and car thefts broadcast on\nTikTok.\n\nYet on the subject of the bank robbery itself, one Ma\u014dri warden had only to\nsay that he reckoned locals already knew who did it. It wasn\u2019t some wayward Te\nK\u016biti youth or a more organized criminal element. Even in those early days,\nspeculation was running rampant among residents that the bank robbers were, in\nfact, Tom Phillips\u2014and one of his children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took four months for police to officially name Phillips for the crime,\ncharging him with aggravated robbery, aggravated wounding, and unlawful\npossession of a firearm. They believe that he was the larger of the two\nrobbers, the one who seemed to be leading things, and have not identified the\nsecond, smaller robber, other than to say that they think she is \u201cfemale.\u201d At\nthe time of the robbery, Jayda was 10.\n\nThe September 2023 charges in the Wild West\u2013style bank robbery\u2014guns blazing,\nbank notes blowing in the wind\u2014eliminated any residual goodwill Phillips had\naccumulated in his long months on the run. They capped off an eventful winter,\nPhillips\u2019 second on the run with his children.\n\nThe month before, Phillips had stolen a truck\u2014naturally, a Toyota Hilux\u2014and\ndriven to Hamilton, the biggest city in the Waikato region, about 40 miles\nnorth of \u014ctorohanga. An acquaintance recognized him in the parking lot of\nBunnings, a Home Depot\u2013type home improvement store, where Phillips, wearing a\nsurgical mask and a woolen hat, used a large amount of cash to buy headlamps,\nbatteries, seedlings, buckets, and gumboots.\n\nThat evening, Phillips got into an altercation on a road about an hour up the\ncoast from Marokopa. The owner of the Hilux\u2014who had also realized that winter\nclothing had been stolen from his property\u2014fought with Phillips, then chased\nhim along the winding highway, reportedly attempting to run him off the road.\nEventually multiple vehicles were pursuing Phillips, who switched off the\nHilux\u2019s headlights and turned sharply into the parking lot of the Te Kauri\nLodge, driving through a gate and into a paddock. \u201cHe went in there and he\nhid,\u201d a lodge custodian told Radio New Zealand. \u201cThese fullahs drove straight\npast.\u201d The police sent out a search helicopter, to no avail. A few days later,\nthe Hilux was found deep in the undergrowth, about 25 meters off Marokopa\nRoad, not far from the Phillips farm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few weeks later, a private investigator\u2014he tells reporters he \u201cfollows the\ncase on his own time\u201d\u2014tipped off Tony Wall, the reporter at Stuff, that the\nproperty to which the Hilux was returned had hosted Phillips for a visit the\nyear before. (The P.I. says he reported the sighting to the police but nothing\ncame of it.) According to an informant, Phillips had been receiving help from\na network of local residents \u201csince day one.\u201d\n\nWall chronicled his visit to the steep, densely wooded property near\n\u014ctorohanga in a hair-raising story published last August. A neighbor, who was\nreportedly also present when Phillips visited the property in 2022, launched\ninto a coy, taunting conversation about the disappearance. \u201cI can\u2019t say if I\nhave or haven\u2019t seen him in the last few years,\u201d the man said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a\ngood game of hide-and-go-seek. He\u2019s fucking good at it. Never, ever play hide-\nand-go-seek with him because you\u2019ll give up, and he won\u2019t come out.\u201d When Wall\nasked the man how someone like Phillips could simply vanish, the man scoffed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy in New Zealand. The justice system is shit, the court system is\nshit, the police are shit, the media is shit. That\u2019s the facts of it.\u201d\n\nAs Wall drove away, his car was overtaken by two other drivers, who boxed him\nin and forced him to pull over to the side of the road. One of the vehicles\nwas driven by the owner of the stolen Hilux, who accused Wall of \u201csnooping\naround\u201d and \u201ccausing havoc.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong fucking place for this,\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to come and harass us out here, on my own turf?\u201d He\ntried to force open Wall\u2019s car door, telling him, \u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck you up,\nmate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWall finally managed to drive away, but the ute\u2019s owner had one last thing to\nsay. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lucky we\u2019re letting you out of here, cunt. You want the\ntruth about the whole fucking scenario, mate, you\u2019d better be on your game,\n\u2019cause you\u2019re pushing shit uphill now.\u201d\n\nAfter the police named Phillips in the bank robbery, residents phoned in more\nthan a dozen sightings, but the police could never seem to catch him. Late one\nnight in November, Phillips and one of his children rode a stolen quad bike to\nthe town of Piopio and smashed the window of a superette in an attempted\nburglary, police say. Security footage showed a pair dressed in full camo gear\napproaching the store\u2019s camera with a spray can. When an alarm sounded, they\nfled south.\n\n## Related From Slate\n\n#### Aymann Ismail\n\n### A 6-Year-Old Boy\u2019s Killing Stunned America. What It Did to His Parents Is\nSomething Else Entirely.\n\nRead More\n\nThis January, the two-year anniversary of Phillips\u2019 second flight passed with\njust another wan police announcement\u2014this time that they had narrowed\nPhillips\u2019 hiding place to the Marokopa area, a development that surprised\nabsolutely no one who\u2019s been following the case. Yet I feel for the police,\nwho are looking in an area spanning hundreds of square miles, where a number\nof residents clearly still have no desire to share information with them. (The\nowner of the stolen Hilux\u2014a guy who disliked Phillips enough that he tried to\nrun him off the road\u2014nevertheless referred to the police as \u201cfucking\npigshits.\u201d) \u201cIf a plane crashed in this bush, you\u2019d be fortunate to find it,\u201d\nMax Baxter told me. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to begin somewhere, unless\nthere\u2019s someone who knows and decides it\u2019s time to come forward.\u201d\n\nFew New Zealanders still believe that Phillips and his kids\u2014now 10, 8, and\n7\u2014are roughing it, stalking game in the deep bush like the wilderpeople of\nold. Most everyone thinks that he\u2019s hiding on or near his family farm, aided\nby a network of friendly locals that may or may not include his parents.\n(That\u2019s certainly what Wall, still trying to crack the case, believes.) On\nsocial media, it\u2019s been a long time since anyone has called Phillips a good\ndad merely fighting authority. \u201cHe\u2019s just a piece of shit human being with\nanger and control issues who is subjecting his children to child abuse,\u201d went\none typical comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd few anticipate any ending to this story that feels happy at all. In the\nworst-case scenario, Phillips and his kids are injured, or killed, robbing\nanother bank or battling it out with the cops. But even the best-case scenario\nat this point feels grim. Phillips\u2019 children have spent the past two and a\nhalf years with a father who\u2019s surely told them that everyone is out to get\nthem, that they can trust no one but him, that the only way to stay safe is to\nhide out far from the rest of the world. He\u2019s relayed to them that their\nfuture depends on smashing windows, stealing cars, waving guns.\n\nSomeday those children will be found, and their father will almost certainly\nbe sent to jail. Every news report about the case\u2014a dwindling number, as the\nmonths go on\u2014features the same photos of the children: the girls in fairy\ndresses, all three of them grinning widely. In the next photos we see of\nJayda, Maverick, and Ember, they won\u2019t be smiling. I once thought perhaps\ntheir father was giving them a gift, the adventure of a lifetime. Instead, he\nstole their childhoods. When it\u2019s all over they\u2019ll be as alone as that truck\nwas, parked on the gray sand, the implacable sea rushing up to meet it.\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * Crime\n  * Family\n  * Parenting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
