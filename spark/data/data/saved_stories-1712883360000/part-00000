This tracks with the VCs that invested in me. When I asked\nthem why they invested in my original idea none of them said it was because\nthey liked my idea. They all said I was the right founder to explore this\nmarket segment.\n\nI thought that this meant that I:\n\n  * Had unique skills (a \u201dbuilding product\u201d edge)\n\n  * Had a unique vantage point (passion for the market)\n\nAfter winding down and reflecting, the real reason they invested in me was:\n\n  * I was a young kid with a lot of time that had some interest/expertise entering a blue ocean market that requires throwing mountains of spaghetti at a wall and seeing what sticks\n\nIt took me 1 year of pivoting around and failing to realize this. After\nwinding down my first product, I was tired of building for blue ocean markets.\nThe uncertainty and pioneer tax was getting to me. So, I decided to enter some\nhuge red ocean markets (e.g. ERPs, Marketplaces). I thought I could do it\nbecause I had a \u201cbuilding product\u201d edge. I spent most of my career building\nproducts at BigTech. Products used and loved by billions of people. I\u2019ll be\nway better at building a SaaS product than Oracle. I mean have you used\nNetSuite?\n\nChatGPT: Generate a drawn cartoon image of a child swimming in a red ocean\n\nAfter countless user interviews and demos, I was unable to find a product\nedge. Since I was a complete noob to these problems, I had to negotiate data\nshares with clients to even get started. Clients had a hard time trusting me\nwith their data\u2014many conversations ended there. Fortunately, since these\nmarkets are incredibly large, someone was always willing to give me a chance.\nUnfortunately, big customers have nearly all necessary features supported by\nthe incumbents\u2014they select software based on brand and integration costs.\nSmall players do have some interesting new features but are small and not a\nlarge market.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve realized after doing this 5-6 times is that markets are efficient\nand that I didn\u2019t have a \u201cbuilding product\u201d edge. Given enough time and little\nchange, large opportunity will be competed away. There will always be numerous\nlifestyle businesses that can exist, but finding huge VC back-able opportunity\nis challenging in mature markets if you are like me\u2014a young kid with a lot of\ntime on my hands. What I thought was a \u201cbuilding product\u201d edge was actually a\ntime edge. I believe there to be three edges a founder can have in a market:\n\n  * Time edge \u2014 great for blue ocean markets. Young founders all have a time edge as they have few responsibilities and no baggage. This is great if the market needs some more time to get to venture scale (e.g. Web Social, MicroComputer Software).\n\n  * Distribution edge \u2014 great for red ocean markets. Famous people have a distribution edge and don\u2019t need to worry too much about how they will get their product in front of people. This is great if the market is mature (e.g. HR Software) and very on brand with your audience.\n\n  * Product edge \u2014 great for all markets. For red ocean markets, you need a unique take on a common product. Large niches have developed with varying tradeoffs that your product insight plays into. For blue ocean markets, you need a unique take on a problem the market has.\n\nI was hoping my time edge would let me discover a product / distribution edge.\nI do think that it is possible for me to discover a product / distribution\nedge given enough time but red ocean markets can stay stagnant longer than I\ncan stay interested.\n\nThis is now what I believe founder market fit actually means\u2014does this founder\nhave the right edge for the market. A distribution edge in a blue ocean market\nis not enough\u2014what will you distribute? As we talked about above, a time edge\nin a red ocean market is not enough\u2014how will you break in? On that note, I\u2019m\ngoing to lean into my time edge and explore markets that are moving fast and\nthat I am irrationally interested in. Just like Jack Donaghy in 30Rock, going\nthe wrong way is often the only way you\u2019ll learn you were on the right path\nall along.\n\n### Subscribe to George\u2019s Substack\n\nBy George Cadenza \u00b7 Launched 2 months ago\n\nMy personal Substack\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What VCs Really Want Regarding Founder Market Fit\n\ngcadenza.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to be a founder?\u201d\n\nThe right motivations for Entrepreneurship\n\nMar 21 \u2022\n\nGeorge Cadenza\n\nShare this post\n\n#### \u201cWhy do you want to be a founder?\u201d\n\ngcadenza.substack.com\n\nThe Three Things Money Can\u2019t Buy\n\nWhy I gave back all the money\n\nFeb 23 \u2022\n\nGeorge Cadenza\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Three Things Money Can\u2019t Buy\n\ngcadenza.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 George Cadenza\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
