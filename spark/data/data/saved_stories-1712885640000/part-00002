Today, we\u2019re\ngoing to talk about how you might use that second brain differently depending\non what your current ADHD state is.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in!\n\n## Your natural states #\n\nI\u2019ve found I personally have three states of being...\n\n  1. Hyperfocus, where I\u2019m deeply focused on one thing and phenomenally productive.\n  2. Physical, where I have lots of energy, but little mental focus.\n  3. Burnt out, where both my mental and physical energy are low.\n\nYour states of being might be different. These are three I tend to operate in\nmost frequently.\n\nI\u2019m better suited for certain types of tasks depending on which state I\u2019m in.\nUnderstanding what my current state of being is, and choosing tasks for the\nday that align with it, helps me live a more happy, healthy, and fulfilling\nlife with less stress.\n\n## Hyperfocus #\n\nAt its best, hyperfocus is a bit like being in the zone or feeling the flow.\n\nYou can tunnel vision in on a specific task or collection of tasks and get a\nphenomenal amount done! This is the state in which I tend to do my best deep\nwork.\n\nI was in hyperfocus mode when I created all of my courses, Reef JS, and\nvarious other projects. At my last job, I got three months of coding done in\nabout three weeks during an intense period of hyperfocus.\n\nThe challenge with hyperfocus is that sometimes it zeroes in on the wrong\nthing (as in not the task you need to be doing).\n\nBut trying to fight it is a fool\u2019s errand. I get literally nothing done in\nthose situations.\n\nBest to just give in to it and let it run its course.\n\nOn hyperfocus days, I don\u2019t really look at my second brain at all. I just\nstart working, and only open up my second brain to add things I don\u2019t want to\nforget later, like a piece of digital scrap paper.\n\n## Physical #\n\nSometimes, I have a lot of energy, but head is full of bees, scattered and\nunable to focus on any one thing for too long.\n\nWhen I\u2019m in this state, I can usually knock a ton of small-to-mid-sized tasks\noff my todo list. These are the kinds of things that my brain would find\nannoying during a period of hyperfocus, but require little thought and let me\ngo into a place a rote zen.\n\nIt includes things like...\n\n  * Making phone calls\n  * Responding to emails\n  * Folding laundry\n  * Doing dishes\n  * Paying bills\n  * Vacuuming the house\n\nI\u2019ll often throw Bob Ross videos on in the background or listen to a podcast\nwhile doing these kinds of tasks, just to keep myself entertained.\n\nOn physical days, I review all of the tasks in my second brain in the morning,\nand flag any of the ones that I think I can do that day as stuff to do today\n(more on how I do that in another article).\n\nThen, I get to it! I do take frequent breaks throughout the day, though.\n\n## Burnt out #\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for folks with ADHD to feel burnt out.\n\nAfter an extended period of hyperfocus or bees in the head, you feel kind of\nspent. You\u2019re too fuzzy in the brain to hyperfocus, but too physically tired\nto do anything else.\n\nI don\u2019t try to fight that anymore.\n\nI take leisurely walks with my dog. I go for a hike or swim or bike ride. I\nread a book or just veg out on a TV show or movie.\n\nGreen time is better than screen time (like, literally, for your ADHD brain),\nbut I don\u2019t beat myself up about it if I watch something instead of getting\noutside.\n\nOften, though, being out in nature helps reenergize me and calm my busy brain.\nI\u2019ll often use that time to brainstorm and come up with ideas or clarify how\nI\u2019m thinking about something.\n\nSometimes, it even shifts me into a hyperfocus or physical state.\n\nOn burnt out days, I may check my second brain for really important has-to-be-\ndone-today tasks, or add things that come to mind, but I\u2019m not looking at it\nall that much.\n\n## Don\u2019t fight your natural state #\n\nIf I try to do mundane tasks when I\u2019m in a hyperfocus mode, my brain keeps\nshifting back to whatever its hyperfocused on, and I get nothing done.\n\nIf I try to do deep work when I\u2019m in a physical state, I sit staring at my\ncomputer for hours and get nothing done.\n\nWorking with your ADHD unlocks so much hidden potential inside you!\n\nFeel like your ADHD is holding you back? I send out a short email each weekday\non how to unlock your neurodivergent superpowers. Join over 180 others.\n\nMade with \u2764\ufe0f in Massachusetts.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
