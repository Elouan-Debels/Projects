Workflows are your enterprise software, your Jira, and your\nSalesforce. Tools are your text editors, your git, and your terminal.\n\nHere is a simple way to differentiate between the two:\n\n  * Tools are used to create things.\n  * Workflows are used to manage things.\n  * Tools are used by creators.\n  * Workflows are used by managers.\n  * Tools are used to build.\n  * Workflows are used to organize.\n  * ...\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nThe ultimate goal of a tool is for you to forget that it\u2019s there. You should\nbe able to focus on your work, not the tool. The ultimate goal of a workflow\nis making sure that everyone is on the same page. It\u2019s about making sure that\neveryone is following the same process.\n\nI hate workflows. I hate them with a passion. I hate them because they are a\nnecessary evil we use to extract the final bit of productivity from our\nemployees. I hate them because they are the reason why we have to fill out\nforms, attend meetings, and write reports.\n\nI love tools. I love them because they are the reason why we can build amazing\nthings. I love them because they empower us all to be creators who can get\nmore stuff done in less time. I love them because they are the reason why we\ncan create art, music, and literature.\n\nMake tools, not workflows.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
