Now authorities may long for the days when he was in charge.\n\nBy William Langewiesche\n\nPhotography by Massimo Vitali\n\nApril 10, 2012\n\nThe thing about being murdered, it usually comes as a surprise. Even in\nNaples, where the criminal clans known collectively as the Camorra are again\nstruggling violently for control of the streets, no victim wakes up expecting\non that given day to die. He shaves carefully, dresses in his beloved clothes,\nslips on an expensive watch, and maybe squeezes his wife before heading out to\nmeet with his friends. If he suspected his fate, he might at least kiss his\nwife good-bye. But the neighborhood has been home for generations to everyone\nhe knows who counts. He deals there in extortion, protection, narcotics, and\ncounterfeit goods. He abides by alternative rules. For this he is respected.\nHe rarely carries a gun. His experience until now has been that murder happens\nonly to others. Then someone comes along and kills him.\n\nIt is a strangely final event. There may be a moment of recognition at the\nend, but by then the man can no longer stay alive. Recently, in a northern\ndistrict called Secondigliano, it was obvious that the victim knew his fate\nfor about seven seconds before he died. Secondigliano is an old farming town\nthat has been swallowed by the city. It has evolved into one of Europe\u2019s\nlargest open-air drug markets and a working-class stronghold for the Camorra.\nThe victim was a mid-ranking member of one of its clans involved in a\ntypically convoluted struggle, and not known to the police before. He was in\nhis mid-30s and beginning to bald. He was immaculately dressed and groomed. As\nwas his habit, he had come to a small street-front gambling shop to play a bit\nof one-armed bandit. Surveillance cameras there captured his demise. It was\nbroad daylight. As a cautionary measure he had placed three guards outside,\none of whom was burly, but none of whom was armed. The gambling shop was\nnarrow and had space for only six machines against one wall. In the back was a\nclosed door. The victim was alone in the room. He sat on a stool to gamble.\n\nA street camera caught the killers\u2019 arrival. There were two of them. They\npulled up fast on a motor scooter, both in full-face helmets with the visors\ndown. From the certainty of their movements, they seemed sure that the victim\nwas inside. It is not known who had informed them. The clerk who normally\ntended to the shop was nowhere in sight. As soon as the scooter came to a\nstop, the man on the back hopped off and, with a 9-mm. pistol in hand, strode\npurposefully toward the front door. The guards fled before him. Two of them,\nincluding the burly one, tumbled into the room to raise the alarm. The camera\ninside showed them bursting in, followed closely by the gunman\u2014a slender\nfigure looking bug-like in his full-face armor. The victim reacted\nimmediately. He leapt from his stool, dashed to the back door, and tugged on\nit, only to find that it was locked. His heart must have been racing. He\nturned and tried to escape through the front. This took him to within point-\nblank range of the gunman, who had stopped about halfway into the room. With\ntwo pistol kicks, the gunman shot him in the back as he passed. The victim\nfell facedown. The gunman took two steps forward, leaned over, and finished\nhim with a single shot to the head.\n\nWatch Now:\n\nHow a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies\n\nBut the gunman was not cool about the killing. In his rush to get away, he\ntripped over a stool and crashed to the floor, catching himself with his\nforearms and rolling as he rose. The gyration left him facing back toward the\nroom just as the burly guard, in his own hurry to escape, made the mistake of\nbarging in his direction. The gunman fired twice into the guard\u2019s chest. The\nguard fell backward and lay stretched for a while, repetitively moving his\nhands to his chest until he lowered his hands and died. By then the gunman had\nalready climbed onto the motor scooter behind his accomplice outside, and the\ntwo had raced away. The scooter did not have legible license plates. Shortly\nafterward a detective told me that the police had not been able to identify\nthe assailants, but he assured me that the Camorra already had. So take the\nlong view, he said: one way or another, justice will probably be done.\nFurthermore, even the state will eventually figure things out if only because\nin Naples, he said, murder is a language that the police can understand. The\ndead may talk, he implied, more fully than the living can.\n\nAn Understanding\n\nSilence is a Neapolitan birthright. The city has such a culture of it that\nsome years ago, when an innocent girl was killed in a Camorra crossfire, many\nof the witnesses who had initially identified the shooters to the police\nrecanted their statements during the trial that ensued. In frustration, the\ninvestigating judge lost his calm and began berating the witnesses, as if here\nin the courtroom he had come face-to-face with the Camorra itself. He had not.\nHe had come face-to-face with ordinary Neapolitans. You cannot really berate\nthe Camorra. If you try, you will find yourself meeting blank stares.\n\nThe Camorra is not an organization like the Mafia that can be separated from\nsociety, disciplined in court, or even quite defined. It is an amorphous\ngrouping in Naples and its hinterlands of more than 100 autonomous clans and\nperhaps 10,000 immediate associates, along with a much larger population of\ndependents, clients, and friends. It is an understanding, a way of justice, a\nmeans of creating wealth and spreading it around. It has been a part of life\nin Naples for centuries\u2014far longer than the fragile construct called Italy has\neven existed. At its strongest it has grown in recent years into a complete\nparallel world and, in many people\u2019s minds, an alternative to the Italian\ngovernment, whatever that term may mean. Neapolitans call it \u201cthe system\u201d with\nresignation and pride. The Camorra offers them work, lends them money,\nprotects them from the government, and even suppresses street crime. The\nproblem is that periodically the Camorra also tries to tear itself apart, and\nwhen that happens, ordinary Neapolitans need to duck.\n\nSecondigliano is well practiced at this. It currently has one of the highest\nmurder rates in Western Europe. Probably one of the highest shooting rates,\ntoo. I have a friend from there who is an architect. Her father is a retired\nmunicipal-bus driver. He owns a station wagon that he uses to transport\nanother daughter, who requires a wheelchair. One day not long ago two men\nstole the station wagon, then called the family\u2019s apartment and demanded 2,000\neuros in cash for the return of the car. The thieves were cheap Camorra punks,\nthe lowest sort of clan associates. My friend was outraged, but her father\npaid what he could of the ransom. He did this on a street, with the cash in an\nenvelope, while his daughter circled around trying to take pictures with her\ncell phone. None of the pictures worked out. My friend accused her father of\ncomplicity with the system. He answered that he simply could not afford to buy\nanother car. Yes, there was a time when no punk from Secondigliano would have\ndared to steal the car of a local man with a crippled child\u2014because the\nCamorra itself would have intervened. But he did not feel sorry for himself.\nHe is a realist. Fighting broke out in the district in 2004, and it has\ncontinued sporadically ever since, weakening the clans to the point where they\ncan no longer control their own. The lowest of them are idiots who know only\nhow to shoot. And so what? You learn to duck. In his entire life only once has\nhe had to buy back his car. Certainly the government of Italy has cost him\nmore in taxes.\n\nHe was raised in Secondigliano. He knows Naples well. For 30 years he shuttled\nits residents around. To drive a bus was to work the streets. All sorts of\npeople climbed on and off. He watched over them when they were in his charge.\nHe did not isolate himself from Naples as a northerner might have. He opened\nhis heart to get the job done. Naples is filthy. Naples is wild. Naples is the\ngreatest city of all. To hell with Rome and Milan, and their soccer teams too.\nWhen Napoli plays, the whole world stops. When it plays at home, the\nsupporters of the opposing teams hardly dare to show up. Forza Napoli! Its\nopponents are bastards born to whores. At the stadium they huddle behind\nprotective caging against the debris and the fireworks thrown at them. This is\nbeautiful to behold. Naples is busy. Naples is poor. Naples has a bus route\ncalled R5, which my friend\u2019s father sometimes drove. It carries addicts and\npickpockets in a standing-room crush of ordinary citizens, and runs from the\ntrain station deep into the parallel world of the Camorra\u2014skirting the narrow\nstreets of the old city center, where the police don\u2019t go, grinding uphill\npast the airport, with all of its associated rackets, stopping by a popular\ndrug market in an alley of Secondigliano, and ending in a slum called Scampia,\na district of dispersed apartment blocks where the Camorra holds sway and\nsomeone has spray-painted a declaration in giant graffiti on a building\u2019s\nside. mala via masta ne, it reads, or, roughly, Crime Rules the Way.\n\n$2.50 $1/mo for 1 year + a free tote.\n\n$2.50 $1/mo for 1 year + a free tote.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nThe Piazzas\n\nScampia is what poverty looks like when Corbusierian city planners try to\nimpose their utopias on people\u2019s lives. The sidewalks are broad but empty. The\nparks are fenced off for safety. There are almost no stores or caf\u00e9s. Many of\nthe residences are falling prematurely into ruin, and some, still inhabited,\nhave been gutted by fire. A Catholic billboard reads, if you believe in\nscampia, you will find a sea of love. In the common space of one iconic\nbuilding, a broken pipe has been gushing municipal water into the gutters for\nfive years straight. Nearby there are several gloomy apartment blocks that\nenclose defensible courtyards and have fortified stairwells that can be\ncontrolled from within. These are the drug bazaars\u2014known as piazzas\u2014over which\nNeapolitans have spilled so much blood. They are among the more lucrative\nretail operations in the world\u2014outlets for low-grade heroin and cocaine that\nfunction openly but remain largely beyond the reach of the state. The\nlogistical details vary, depending on location and customer base, but the\nlargest operations run day and night, and deploy dozens of lookouts to cover\nthe approaches\u2014some sitting astride motor scooters on the streets, some\nwatching the driveways and parking areas from upper-floor windows, others\nstanding in groups at the allowed entry points to the courtyards and\nbuildings. Again, there are variations, but the ideal is to seal off the outer\nperimeter of the complex by augmenting the existing window bars and steel\ndoors with concertina wire and heavy bolts, and then to cut a small portal in\nthe ground-floor wall of a stairwell\u2014whether to the courtyard or to the back\nof the complex\u2014through which cash and narcotics can be safely exchanged.\n\nThese arrangements cannot stop the police from entering, but they practically\nguarantee that no sellers will be found in possession of weapons or drugs\u2014and\nthis in turn makes raids seem pointless. As for the residents of the\ncomplexes, they are captives to the extent that they have to avoid the active\nstairwells and must leave and return through Camorra checkpoints that may\noccasionally be closed. In any case, they themselves are often involved,\nwhether as lookouts, needle vendors, or the recipients of the Camorra\u2019s aid.\nMore fundamentally, the Camorra is simply a part of life. One afternoon I\nwalked with a police detective\u2014armed, gritty, unshaven, and in sweatshirt and\njeans\u2014past a group of Camorra soldiers, across a courtyard, and through an\nopen steel door into a stairwell. A couple of chairs stood by a portal cut\ninto a wall. The door was equipped with a massive locking bolt which the\ndetective demonstrated by sliding it into place. Soon afterward a woman\nappeared from upstairs, accompanied by a young girl. Without a word they\nwalked past us to the door, which the mother unbolted to go outside. The girl\nsaid, \u201cBut, Mama, don\u2019t we have to wait for the men to give us permission?\u201d\nThe woman answered, \u201cNo, these are the police.\u201d Her tone was patient, as if\nshe were conveying the most basic facts to her child. \u201cThis is what cops look\nlike,\u201d she seemed to mean. And also, \u201cIn our world, angel, they don\u2019t count\nfor much.\u201d\n\nOn the backside of the building a line of customers snaked up an outside\nflight of stairs and along a second-floor passageway to a hole in a door where\nheroin was being sold. They were Italians, all of them, some furtive, most\nnot. If only because the prisons would be overwhelmed, the personal possession\nof narcotics in Italy is not significantly criminalized. The heroin was going\nfor eight euros a dose\u2014hardly more than a pack of cigarettes, and one-fourth\nthe price in Milan. A few customers had come all the way from Florence for the\nbargain. Men, women, young, old. Some had arrived on the R5 bus. Some could\nnot wait to get high before heading home. Dozens of addicts milled around in a\nrubbish-strewn field that was littered with needles, near a patch of pavement\nstained with what appeared to be dried blood. They sat on concrete walls or in\nthe dirt, exposing their arms or feet and preparing their veins with loving\ncare, before injecting themselves with their chemical bliss. Afterward they\nsat nodding, or stood against the cold by a bonfire, or wandered aimlessly\nthrough the smoke and refuse. We walked among them. They were largely\nindifferent to our presence, but one man approached. The detective asked him,\n\u201cWhy do you live this way?\u201d\n\nThe man said, \u201cDrugs like everyone, and everyone likes drugs.\u201d\n\nThe detective said, \u201cMe, I do not like drugs. I like women.\u201d\n\nThe man said, \u201cYes, but the difference is that drugs won\u2019t betray you.\u201d\n\nYes, but the drugs were hollowing him out inside. And all around him the\nCamorra kept falling out and fighting. And love cannot be as dangerous as\nthat.\n\nLife Lessons\n\nBetrayal? The Camorra murders especially when it is weak. The killing in\nScampia and Secondigliano has been going on for so long that some prosecutors\nalmost regret their previous triumphs. In memory there is a golden era when\nthe Camorra was strong. The boss then was a recluse named Paolo Di Lauro, a\npresence rarely seen, who is now in prison effectively for life and stands as\none of the greatest Camorristi of all time. Little is known of his early years\nexcept that he was born in Secondigliano in 1953, was orphaned young, and was\nadopted by a family of modest means that had a house near the center of the\ndistrict. The mother was a housewife, the father a simple laborer. They were\ndeep Neapolitans who spoke a dialect nearly unintelligible elsewhere in Italy.\nDi Lauro attended a few years of primary school before dropping out and\ngetting to work, first as an assistant for a local shopkeeper. By his late\nteens he had moved to the industrial zones of far-off Northern Italy, where he\nworked door-to-door selling underwear and bedsheets to migrant factory workers\nfrom the South. In local parlance such merchants are known as magliari, a word\nthat can also mean cheaters. There is no evidence that Di Lauro cheated anyone\nat the time, but his subsequent history indicates that he might not have\nhesitated if given the chance. He was quiet and unusually ambitious. In the\nNorth he made a bit of money and developed a taste for card games and\ngambling. It turned out that he was mathematically inclined. Back in\nSecondigliano he married a local girl who in 1973 bore him the first of 11\nchildren\u2014all of them sons. His wife was very Catholic, as was he. They loved\neach other very much.\n\nHe was not a fighter. It was his coolness when gambling that brought him to\nthe attention of the clan that controlled Secondigliano at the time. The head\nof the clan was a flamboyant Camorrista named Aniello La Monica, who had a\nclothing store named Python, after his preferred weapon, a heavy .357 Magnum\nrevolver. La Monica was an aggressive killer\u2014responsible for the deaths of\nmany men, including, it is said, one by hands-on decapitation\u2014but he was\nstrangely shy about the drug trade, preferring to stick to the traditional\npursuits of dealing in black-market cigarettes, meddling in public\nconstruction, and protecting the neighborhood shopkeepers from crime. Around\n1975 he engaged Di Lauro to do the clan\u2019s books. The position gave Di Lauro a\nprivileged view of the business and convinced him after several years\u2014despite\nthe continuing reluctance of La Monica\u2014that far greater profits could be made\nin the as yet unexploited local trade in heroin and cocaine. This became all\nthe more evident after the great Neapolitan earthquake of 1980, which drove\nthousands of people from their ruined center-city slums and swelled the\nScampia public-housing projects with the poor and dispossessed.\n\nIn the years that followed, billions of dollars of reconstruction funds\ninfused cash into every level of Neapolitan society. Di Lauro stuck to the\nshadows. He spoke little. He listened and observed. He believed that rational\npeople can resolve their professional disputes through compromise and\nnegotiation, and that they should kill only as a last resort. He was more\nself-disciplined, however, than he was gentle. La Monica, who is said to have\nbeen a good judge of men, came to fear that Di Lauro was the most ruthless man\nof all. For his part, Di Lauro concluded that La Monica had become an\nimpediment to business, and in 1982 he tried to remove him from power by\ninforming key clan members, as the bookkeeper, that La Monica had been taking\nmore than his fair share of the proceeds. When La Monica learned of Di Lauro\u2019s\ntreachery, he hired two killers from a nearby town to hunt Di Lauro down. They\narrived by motor scooter, found Di Lauro at a street market, shot at him,\nmissed, and chased him around until he escaped.\n\nAfterward there was no room left for compromise, and people within the clan\nfaced the prospect of having to choose between the two men. Any uncertainty\nthey felt did not last for long. Di Lauro paid an associate to lure La Monica\nout of his house by offering to show him stolen diamonds, and La Monica, much\nas he recognized the risk, walked into the trap so he would not seem to be\ncowering at home. Once on the street he found that the associate had\ndisappeared. Before he could retreat into his house, Di Lauro and three others\ncame speeding around a corner in a Fiat and smashed into him. The impact did\nnot knock him down. The damage to the Fiat is unknown. Di Lauro and his\naccomplices got out of the car and killed La Monica with pistol shots. La\nMonica was barely 40 years old. Di Lauro was not yet 30. It is rumored that he\nwas a poor marksman. On the advice of his friends, he swore never again to\nhandle a gun. It seems that he never did, directly, from then on.\n\nOn the day of La Monica\u2019s funeral, all of Secondigliano mourned, and many\nshopkeepers closed their doors in respect. Di Lauro solemnly attended the\nburial, then faded again into the shadows. He was so averse to standing out\nthat the police knew nothing about him for years. They had no idea who had\nmurdered La Monica, because no one talked. Soon after the killing, the leaders\nof an important clan in the center of the city asked for a meeting, because\nthey too could not decipher the event. Di Lauro attended the meeting with\nseveral of his men and explained that they wanted to do business in friendship\nand peace. This was true, at least for Di Lauro himself. As luck would have\nit, the police picked that meeting to raid. They detained Di Lauro but then\nreleased him without questioning, assuming he was a minor thug of no\nconsequence. Di Lauro swore that he would never again attend such a meeting.\nHe was a great one for drawing lessons from life. He liked to teach lessons,\ntoo. For instance: It is better to share profits than to fight over them. And:\nYou have to be willing to go to war, but if violence is your only skill, you\nwill lose in the end and die. And: Murder is bad because it attracts\nattention. And: If the police search your place, stay calm; do not act cocky;\ndo not say more than necessary. Live modestly, dress modestly, drive modestly,\ndo not carry a gun. Do not use drugs. If you want to gamble and whore around,\nthat\u2019s fine, but do it somewhere far away, like Monaco or Marbella. Go with\nFrench women or Spanish. Here in Secondigliano, don\u2019t fuck casually with other\nmen\u2019s wives and daughters. Here in Secondigliano, the only sound we should\nhear is the patter of cash.\n\nDi Lauro amassed his power incrementally as people turned to him for decisions\nand help. He was careful to maintain respectful relations with other clans\nthroughout the region, and yet to avoid the potentially dangerous entanglement\nof formal alliances. Particularly delicate were his dealings with a local\nfamily named Licciardi\u2014a powerful clan well established in areas of\nSecondigliano and Scampia, with whom he managed repeatedly to avoid going to\nwar even as his business expanded. That business was now based primarily on\nnarcotics, with its five-fold profit margins, but not to the exclusion of\nother opportunities in the traditional realms of untaxed cigarettes, local\ngambling shops, and small-time extortion, as well as in the blossoming new\nmarket in counterfeit brands.\n\nMiracles\n\nBy 1992, a decade after killing La Monica, Di Lauro was on his way to becoming\none of the wealthiest men in Italy, with an uncountable fortune in the\nhundreds of millions of dollars. I recently spoke to Vittorio Giaquinto, his\nformer lawyer\u2014a large, immaculately dressed man sitting in the splendor of a\nbaroque office\u2014who is one of the few people who knew Di Lauro well. He said\nthat Di Lauro was motivated less by greed than by operational logic, and by an\nunwavering determination, as an orphan himself, to provide for the long-term\nsecurity of his family. As a gambler, Di Lauro knew that he was playing a\nloser\u2019s game and would have to diversify into legitimate businesses if he was\nto achieve that aim. He founded a holding company through which ultimately he\nwent into textiles, home furnishings, meat and dairy products, bottled water,\ncash-and-carry wholesale markets, prepared-food distribution, shopping-mall\ndevelopment, residential real estate, hotels, restaurants, shops of all sorts\nin Secondigliano, and a clothing store in Paris in the 12th Arrondissement.\nPeople say that he accumulated a fortune in precious stones sufficient to pave\nthe autostrada all the way to Rome. And yet, despite his understanding of the\nspecial risks, he was unwilling to quit dealing in drugs. He kept going,\nthough knowing it could ruin him and, worse, destroy the lives of his wife and\nsons. In this endeavor he was a gambler unable to stop.\n\nFor Secondigliano, those were the golden years anyway. Di Lauro tried to guard\nhimself against betrayal. His greatest defense was the business structure he\nbuilt, arranged as a pyramid of independent entrepreneurs, acting as\nfranchisees under his guidance, and respected by him as largely autonomous\nassociates. There were about 20 at that level, each with the exclusive rights\nto a major drug piazza. They bought a minimum of narcotics from Di Lauro each\nweek, and paid a significant rent, but beyond that they were free to earn as\nmuch from their piazzas as they could. This included going to outside vendors\nfor additional supplies if they could find them at a better price than Di\nLauro offered. He would even finance them, and at low interest rates, if they\nrequired it. In return, Di Lauro expected a certain code of behavior: within\nthe clan, people would be treated fairly, down to the lowest level of\nassociates; they would not quarrel stupidly with one another; they would\nrecognize Di Lauro as an arbiter in cases where the quarrel was real; in other\nways, also, they would recognize Di Lauro\u2019s authority at all times; they would\nnot take independent action against any other group in the city; and, finally,\nthey would never\u2014never!\u2014speak Di Lauro\u2019s name.\n\nHe was sensitive to the smallest signs of trouble. Simone Di Meo, a reporter\nwho has written the best accounts of those times, told me that one day, in the\ncenter of Secondigliano, Di Lauro happened to notice a large group of motor\nscooters parked outside a bar. He sent a man inside to investigate. It turned\nout that a beautiful girl was being held until she chose one of her captors as\na lover. Di Lauro sent word for the party to break up, saying he didn\u2019t want\nthis sort of foolishness in his district. He was not much for flirtation or\nfun. It is said that he enjoyed practical jokes, but the only hint is\ncontained in a story which may not be true: that he once dressed as a butcher\nin a butcher shop he owned and gave the shoppers 50 euros in change for every\n5 euros they spent. The customers were embarrassed, one version goes, because\nthey saw right through him, as if he were a king playing foolishly at pretend.\nThe customers were so impressed to see him in the flesh, another version goes,\nthat they lined up to kiss his hand.\n\nBut it is doubtful that Di Lauro ever put on such a show, or that his\ncustomers would have recognized him if he had. Within the community he was\nknown mythically as \u201cThe Man.\u201d Within his own organization he was known as\n\u201cPasquale.\u201d He was the phantom, the unseen power who had transformed the\nnorthern districts of Naples into Europe\u2019s greatest drug emporium, but also\nemployed many thousands of people and had effectively banished street crime\nfrom Secondigliano and Scampia. By the mid-1990s, rape, robbery, assault, and\ntheft had all but disappeared. You could walk anywhere you wanted at any hour.\nIf you had a car or motor scooter, you could park it anywhere without worry,\nexcept perhaps for the radio (because, after all, this was Italy). When the\nimportant newspaper Il Mattino published an article about illicit gambling in\nthe districts, Di Lauro ordered that the gambling stop\u2014and it did,\npermanently, within 48 hours. When he decided that the traditional business of\nextorting protection money from local shopkeepers was causing more trouble\nthan it was worth, he ordered not only that it be halted but that his men\nstart paying full prices, and even thank the shopkeepers for their services.\nIt was strange, but they did. For this and all the favors he gave, he was\nwidely loved\u2014and still is. People say that the difference between Di Lauro and\na saint was that Di Lauro delivered the miracles faster.\n\nAt his peak he was importing heavy loads of cocaine from Colombia (through\nSpain), heroin from Afghanistan (through Turkey, Eastern Europe, and the\nBalkans), and hashish from Morocco (again through Spain). These substances\nwere not smuggled in through the port (where customs officials were too\ngreedy) but were delivered overland by truck or car to Naples. Once in\nSecondigliano, the drugs were diluted and fed into the booming piazzas, as\nwell as to an extensive wholesale network elsewhere in Italy, and in Germany\nand France. Meanwhile, Di Lauro was manufacturing counterfeit brand-name\ngoods, which he wholesaled in Western Europe, Brazil, and the United States.\nLouis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Gucci, Prada\u2014that sort of stuff. Some\nof the counterfeits were made by the same Italian factories that produced the\noriginals, and were identical down to the stitching; others were crude\nknockoffs. It was a profitable business, and not the sort that would normally\nget you killed. An even better business turned out to be the trade in\ncounterfeit cameras and power tools\u2014shoddy Chinese imitations smuggled into\nItaly by Di Lauro and sold to the credulous far and wide.\n\nSo, great\u2014or good enough. Di Lauro did not kidnap or rob. He sold to people\nwhat they came to him to find. But he himself seems to have been unsatisfied.\nHe became increasingly reclusive and by the mid-1990s had withdrawn almost\nentirely into his house, where he lived behind closed steel shutters and\nbolted gates, refusing contact with all but his family and a few trusted\nlieutenants. He became pale from the lack of sun. His wife stayed inside with\nhim, producing another baby every few years. The children eventually grew up\nand went to school. The family had a huge Neapolitan mastiff named Primo\nCarnera, after the Italian heavyweight boxer. The dog slept in his own room.\nThe house was the same simple one Di Lauro had lived in as a child, though\nexpanded, fortified, and guarded. It had a basement bar well stocked with\nFrench wines and liqueurs, a bunkroom for the boys, and a large, sparsely\nfurnished living room where Di Lauro made decisions. The living room had\nreligious icons on the walls. Di Lauro hardly dared to go to church. He hardly\ndared to use the phone. He had a back passage for escape. He eyed people\nclosely when he spoke to them, and expressed himself in language so spare that\nit would have been difficult for outsiders to comprehend. The fact is that no\noutsiders were listening. But Di Lauro clearly feared that talk could bring\nhim down. He was no longer just naturally taciturn. He was muted by his\ncaution.\n\nAnd if talk could bring him down, what about a language that the state could\nreally understand\u2014what about murder? The police had missed the meaning of La\nMonica\u2019s death, but afterward the question must often have been on Di Lauro\u2019s\nmind. He remained safely out of sight partly by suppressing the Camorra\u2019s\ntendency toward anarchic violence. He did condone some killings, but these\nwere quiet actions within the clan, not public vendettas. For the safety of\nthe group, regrettably, a few men had to be made to disappear. The kills were\nso clean that after 10 years, in 1992, the police still did not know that Di\nLauro and his clan existed.\n\n\u201cThe Rabbit Man\u201d\n\nBut then, in that same year, Di Lauro briefly lost control. A former associate\nnamed Antonio Ruocco\u2014the leader of a small clan in a nearby town\u2014returned from\nprison and found that his piazza had been awarded to another man. Ruocco went\nto war and, after a couple of back-and-forth killings, gathered several\ngunmen, pulled up at a bar in Scampia, and opened fire with assault rifles,\nkilling five of Di Lauro\u2019s closest associates and wounding nine others. If\nthat was bad, the response was disastrous: certain members of Di Lauro\u2019s clan\nwent rogue, and on their own authority set out not just to hunt down Ruocco\nbut to exterminate his entire family. Ruocco survived by fleeing to Milan, but\nDi Lauro\u2019s men killed his aging mother, killed his uncle, shot his brother (he\nsurvived), shot his brother\u2019s wife (she died), and tried to kill a sister by\nlocking her in a bathroom and setting it on fire (she escaped through a window\nand left town). Di Lauro was angry about these actions. The targeting of\ninnocent family members\u2014and particularly an old woman\u2014constituted a serious\nviolation of Camorra norms. Worse, the drama had called attention to the\nnorthern districts. Di Lauro regained control by having the woman\u2019s killers\nkilled in turn, and by ordering a cease-fire, but dangerous questions had been\nraised that would not go away.\n\nThree months later, in August 1992, the police found Ruocco in Milan, where he\nhad been cowering in fear of Di Lauro\u2019s wrath. He jumped from a third-floor\nwindow when the police arrived, landed badly, and ended up in prison, where\nafter a period of silence he began spilling the Camorra\u2019s secrets, including\nthe story of La Monica\u2019s murder. It was the state\u2019s first break, but a lousy\none. After much confusion and fuss, all that came of Ruocco\u2019s cooperation was\nhis own conviction for conspiracy. By 1994 the ruckus had died down. According\nto Simone Di Meo, this was the moment when the Italian press first identified\nDi Lauro and his clan. If so, the police weren\u2019t reading the papers, because\nthe detectives who later ran the seven-year investigation that ultimately\nbrought Di Lauro down told me that at the start, in 1995, they had never heard\nof the man by name.\n\nUnbeknownst to the police, Di Lauro had trouble again, in 1997, when some of\nhis men killed a Licciardi nephew in what began as a quarrel over a woman in a\nbar, and the Licciardis responded by nailing a death list of 17 Di Lauro\nassociates to a church door. It is said that Di Lauro himself ordered some of\nthose on the list to be killed to show his good faith, but it seems more\nlikely that he simply acquiesced in their fates. The list stayed on the door\nuntil a priest took it down. Most of the named 17 survived. For whatever\nreason, the two groups veered away from war and continued their wary\ncoexistence as before. There was a lot of money being made. By now the police\nknew of a man named Di Lauro who was a local Camorrista, but they had no\nphotographs of him and did not understand his role. They thought he was at\nmost a mere captain, and in the Licciardi clan. A few detectives worked the\ncase full-time. They kept tapping phones and trying to piece together the\npuzzle. Rarely could they understand what was being said: the communications\nwere not merely guarded but illiterate and insular, like an entire micro-\nlanguage that had to be learned. By plotting the connections, they eventually\nrealized they were dealing with a pyramidal structure. They heard frequent\nreferences to someone named Pasquale. Sometimes he was called \u201cthe Rabbit\nMan.\u201d This may have meant that he had a large family or that he was fast. It\nseemed that he was the boss.\n\nCivil War\n\nThe break in the case was an accident. In 1998 at an elementary school in the\ncenter of Secondigliano, a teacher shouted at a young Di Lauro cousin for\nmisbehaving in class, and one of Di Lauro\u2019s sons\u2014a 10-year-old named\nAntonio\u2014took his cousin\u2019s defense by standing up and shouting back. The\nteacher reacted by giving Antonio a slap. Word of the incident traveled fast.\nIt is said that when the boy got home Di Lauro scolded him for misbehaving.\nOthers in the clan, however, felt that the family had been insulted. Three of\nthem went to the school, sought out the teacher, and slapped him as he had\nslapped Di Lauro\u2019s son\u2014or perhaps a little more. It is obvious that Di Lauro\nwould never have sent them, but when the teacher filed an official complaint,\nthe police took the occasion to summon Di Lauro to the district station for a\nconversation. He entered the station peacefully, leaving some associates\noutside, and was whisked to police headquarters in central Naples, where he\ndenied any knowledge of the assault and claimed to be a shopkeeper. The police\nhad to release him, but not before they took some mug shots\u2014face forward and\nin profile\u2014which now count among the few Di Lauro pictures that exist. Here he\nis in an open-necked blue shirt at age 45, emerging unwillingly from the\nshadows\u2014balding, a bit fat, clean-shaven, impressively self-contained. He is a\nstoic at the height of his power. There is something in his composure\u2014with the\nhint of a smile that is not a smile, and eyes subtly diverted from the\ncamera\u2014that conveys an unwavering autonomy. He sometimes insisted that he did\nnot oppose the government, but it is clear in these pictures why the\ngovernment should have feared him.\n\nPasquale? When the phone taps picked up the clan\u2019s excited chatter about Di\nLauro\u2019s station visit, it suddenly became clear that Pasquale and Di Lauro\nwere the same man, and therefore that Di Lauro, who was formerly seen as a\nminor character, was in fact a king. Di Lauro had long expected this disaster\nto strike. As a student of life he could not have been surprised that it was\nover an incident as minor as a spat with a teacher at school. Now that he\ncould no longer hide in plain view, he withdrew even more deeply into his\nprivate world and began a peripatetic existence, moving between barren\napartments in the district and only occasionally sleeping at home. Sometimes\nhe traveled abroad to make deals and to gamble. When he returned he never\nmentioned where he had been or what he had done. No one cared so long as he\nremained in charge. He was sharing his wealth throughout Secondigliano and\nbeyond. Many people believed that the state was too weak to touch him. Di\nLauro certainly knew better, and he must have wondered why, subsequently, the\nstate took so long to act.\n\nThe problem for the police was that no witnesses came forward to speak against\nthe clan. This left the investigators to proceed in the most tedious manner\u2014by\ncontinuing to tap the clan\u2019s phone calls (finally 7,990 conversations in all)\nand entering the evidence piecemeal into thick files for later review by a\nprosecuting judge. They had to meet the standards of Italian anti-Mafia laws\nsimilar to the American RICO statutes, which target direct association with\ncriminal syndicates and allow for murder prosecutions based on command\nresponsibility. Building the case took a full four years after the teacher-\nslapping incident, but in October 2002 orders were finally issued for the\narrest of Paolo Di Lauro and 61 members of the clan. Within months, many of\nthese people were picked up and jailed. Some of them were very close to Di\nLauro, including Di Lauro\u2019s second-oldest son. As for Di Lauro himself, he was\nnowhere to be found. For several years he was on the run. People claimed to\nhave spotted him in Marseilles, Athens, London, and Milan. Some newspapers\nreported that he had died. But his lawyer told me that not only was he alive\nbut he had remained in Secondigliano the entire time. When I asked his lawyer\nwhy, he spread his hands as if to say, It\u2019s obvious. He said, \u201cHe loved his\nfamily.\u201d In fact, it was during his years as a fugitive that he and his wife\nconceived their 11th and final child. The lawyer told me he had wondered aloud\nif the child would perhaps at last be a girl, and Di Lauro answered that he\ncould not even mention this to his wife because she might take the question as\na criticism for not yet having provided him with a daughter. He was that in\nlove with her, still. He cared for nothing if he did not care for his family.\n\nIn May 2004 one of his sons was killed in a motor-scooter accident. He was a\npassenger on the back, riding without a helmet. Di Lauro was devastated and\nbecame ineffectual for a while. This may help to explain why at around this\ntime he made the greatest error of his life, when he decided to hand over\npower to a child he loved beyond reason, Cosimo, his firstborn son. Cosimo,\naged 30, was a full-blown psychopath known for brutality. He wore long,\nstringy hair and black clothes in imitation of a gothic fantasy character from\nthe movie The Crow. He kept a Lamborghini in Paris. He was a heartthrob for\nlower-class girls, who were thrilled by his aggression and his style. For much\nthe same reason he was surrounded by a crew of young gunmen full of swagger.\nCosimo had been involved in Camorra business since his teenage years and had\nrecently concluded that the clan\u2019s principal associates, the long-honored\nfranchisees, had grown too independent and greedy, and that his father\u2014a mere\naccountant, after all\u2014had lacked the courage to take them on. All that was\ngoing to change, now that he was in charge. Henceforward all drug supplies\nwould be purchased exclusively from the Di Lauro family, and associates would\nessentially become its employees, to be paid as Cosimo saw fit, and under his\ncontrol. Any who objected would be replaced\u2014one way or another. It was obvious\nthat the old-timers were not going to accept these terms, nor, for that\nmatter, could they accept the authority of such an immature leader. Through an\nintermediary, Di Lauro ordered his son to desist. The intermediary said, \u201cI\nbring a message from your father. Do not do this war.\u201d It was too late. Cosimo\nanswered, \u201cPapa doesn\u2019t count anymore.\u201d\n\nThe war that followed was one of the most intense in the Camorra\u2019s history,\npitting a faction of former Di Lauro associates, now known as the\nSecessionists, against the new, younger gunmen, who stuck with Cosimo and\nretained the Di Lauro name. The fighting broke out in late 2004. In\nSecondigliano and Scampia that fall and winter at least 54 people were killed,\nsometimes several in a day. Paolo Di Lauro must have looked on in disgust and\ndismay. On one occasion, the former girlfriend of a Secessionist was captured\nby Cosimo\u2019s men, who tortured her (in vain) to get her to divulge her\nboyfriend\u2019s location, then murdered her and burned her body in a car. People\nwere outraged even within the clan and they talked: this was Cosimo\u2019s doing.\nThe police issued orders for Cosimo\u2019s arrest. He went into hiding in\nSecondigliano but sent so many text messages to various girlfriends that he\nwas tracked down within a few weeks. When the police broke in, he was not\narmed. He went to a mirror to comb his hair back, and he put on a black\nleather coat to complement his black sweater and jeans. It was a January\nafternoon in 2005. By the time the police got him downstairs, several hundred\nneighborhood women had converged on the site and begun to riot. They dropped a\ntoilet on the police from an upper-floor window, threw all manner of objects\nat them, and burned two police cars. Cosimo emerged into this scene, flanked\nby policemen, and stared directly into the cameras of the press. He was like a\nrock star playing to the paparazzi. The pictures that resulted became all the\nrage on schoolgirls\u2019 cell phones throughout Naples.\n\nWas he proud of what he had done? Wars are so easy to start and hard to stop.\nCosimo\u2019s lasted another month or two, and ended with the destruction of\neverything his father had built. For the Di Lauro clan, this was essentially a\nmilitary defeat. The Secessionists were more numerous, more experienced, and\nbetter armed; the Di Lauros consisted now mostly of the pretenders who had\naccepted Cosimo\u2019s leadership. In the end it was Paolo Di Lauro, still in\nhiding, who sued for peace. Meetings between envoys were set up under the\nsecurity guarantees of other clans. For additional safety, family members were\nswapped as hostages for the duration of the talks. In the end the two sides\nagreed on three crucial conditions. One: the Secessionists would now become a\nclan of their own, with no obligations to any Di Lauro. Two: the Secessionists\nwho had fled their apartments could return at no risk to live in Secondigliano\nagain. Three: Paolo Di Lauro would admit that his family had lost the war, and\nwith it the rights to all of his piazzas except for an alley in the center of\nSecondigliano, and an apartment complex nearby, in a loyalist stronghold\ncalled Rioni dei Fiori, where the women had rioted for his beloved\npsychopathic son.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 there was such quiet on the northern front that\nNeapolitans assumed Di Lauro was back in charge. This was good news rather\nthan bad. People did not know about his loss of power, and they could not have\nimagined that such a man would ever have surrendered. A few months later, on\nSeptember 16, 2005, he was found by the police in the simple apartment of a\nhumble old woman who had been sheltering and feeding him for a fee. He did not\nresist the police or make any comment when they walked in. He seemed to have\nbeen expecting the event. When he was taken outside, he kept his head down to\nfoil the photographers. He did not strut. He did not cower. At the station,\nwhen asked, he said no more than he had said before. \u201cI am Paolo Di Lauro, and\nI am a shopkeeper.\u201d He then fell silent, as he has been ever since.\n\nIsolation\n\nSo love is dangerous after all. Paolo Di Lauro stood trial in the spring of\n2006. He observed the first phase quietly, without obvious emotion. He was\ndressed modestly. About halfway through the trial, as more charges were\nleveled, he stopped attending the proceedings, gave up on his defense, and\ndismissed his longtime lawyer and friend. To the lawyer he said, \u201cYou should\nnot be offended. There is no lack of respect implied.\u201d But there was also no\npoint in carrying on. The court assigned him a public defender, as required by\nlaw, and in May 2006 Di Lauro was sentenced to the first of what have since\nturned into three consecutive 30-year prison terms for Mafia association,\ntrafficking, and murder. His son Cosimo, in separate trials, was also sent\naway for life. The court seized any Di Lauro properties that could be found.\n\nIt was a victory for the state, but an empty one. War broke out again in 2006\nbetween the Secessionists and the Di Lauro clan\u2014now headed by another son\u2014and\nseven people were murdered. The dynamics of the violence were extremely\ncomplex. It is believed that some of the dead may have been killed by the\nLicciardi to incite fighting by the two other sides. In the summer of 2007 it\nhappened again, and 11 high-ranking Di Lauro associates were killed. That same\nyear a group of loyalists who had stuck with the clan through the worst of the\ntroubles finally broke off in disgust and assumed independent control of the\ncentral alley in Secondigliano, leaving the Di Lauros pathetically enfeebled\nand with only the single piazza in Rioni dei Fiori to use for selling drugs.\nNearby, in Scampia, the Secessionists had control over multiple piazzas but\nwere unable to usher in a new era of peace, as they must have wanted to.\nRather, the opposite occurred, as fighting continued for reasons that seemed\nincreasingly petty and confused. Soon enough, in 2010, the Secessionists\nthemselves split into two groups\u2014veterans of the war with Di Lauro, known as\nthe Old Colonels, and upstarts led by a notoriously violent kid in his early\n20s, known as Mariano, who rides around not on a motor scooter but on a\npowerful dual-purpose Transalp motorcycle, wearing a full-face helmet in the\nfashion of killers. The police know he is there but can never find him. He is\ncoked up and certain to die young, and clearly he does not care.\n\nThis is the situation on the ground today, a chaos of constant splintering and\nmurderous rivalries that shows no sign of sorting itself out. It is the\npattern of the Camorra in Naples, as it has always been. There are periods of\nchaos, followed by peaceful times when men like Di Lauro rise, followed by\nchaos again when men like Di Lauro fall. The remnants of his clan are headed\nnow by a son named Marco, a fugitive from the law, who is widely disrespected\nfor being foolish and weak. Somewhere in Naples, in some other family, the\nnext great leader in all likelihood has already been born, but until he\nemerges onto the scene demonstrating particular strength and wisdom he cannot\nbe identified. Meanwhile, for those in the game in Secondigliano and Scampia,\nthere are so many different ways to die, and every one of them is a surprise.\n\nThe government wanders this terrain on its own uncertain missions. You have to\nwonder what it is trying to achieve when, for instance, it stops some people\nfor questioning on the streets, or throws others in prison forever. In a place\nlike Italy\u2014where the recent prime minister condones tax evasion as a natural\nright and publicly impugns the courts\u2014it becomes hard to believe that police\nactions are sincerely about law and order, or that officials still believe\nthat law and order matter. As warfare raged within the Camorra, Italy itself\nwas teetering on the edge of economic collapse and threatening to drag the\nrest of Europe with it\u2014and largely because of mismanagement by a succession of\ncorrupt and cynical governments. One day in Naples I was told of a police raid\nunder way against what was left of the Di Lauro clan in Secondigliano. I\nrushed to Rioni dei Fiori and came upon an opera, with a helicopter thumping\noverhead and the streets guarded by uniformed officers for blocks around. At\nthe center of the operation stood the piazza itself, a typically filthy\napartment complex built around a central square littered with trash and\nstained with at least one large smear of human excrement. The clan had\nobviously heard about the raid in advance and had quietly shut its operations\nfor the day. As a result, there were no drugs to be found, no arrests to be\nmade. Firemen broke down a steel door and removed some fortifications that the\nclan had installed at the two access gates to the courtyard. Then the raid was\nover. The man in charge was a detective. I asked him what purpose the raid had\nserved. \u201cIt was a show of state power,\u201d he said. \u201cOf making the dealers flee\nlike rats. It was a public humiliation. That was the purpose. But we are not\nstupid. We know they will come back to take over the piazza and control the\ngates again. Probably by tomorrow. Look, we can squeeze the Camorra, but we\nknow we can\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe that doesn\u2019t matter. People may wring their hands about the horror\nof it all, but this is Naples, one of the great alternatives to modern life.\nIt is possible that the world should no more root out the Camorra than make\nNeapolitans operate on time. And then there is the practical side. An anti-\nMafia judge told me that some of the police\u2014even those who have not been\ncorrupted\u2014would rather not see the government prevail, because they fear the\neven greater disorder that would result. Another judge pointed out to me that\nthe government needs the Camorra for social control. He said, \u201cFor a political\nleader, it\u2019s easier to speak to a Camorra boss than to 100,000 people to get a\nmessage across.\u201d More than that, he said: the Camorra sets standards, enforces\nlaws, keeps police power itself in check, fends off aggressive tax collectors,\nemploys a huge percentage of the population, creates and distributes wealth\nmore efficiently than any other sector of society, and stands in to keep\nthings going, especially in times like these, when the national economy has\nfailed and the currency itself is at risk.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly the system you would dream up in a civics class. Nonetheless the\nCamorra serves society best when it is strong. The judges I spoke to all\nrecognized this truth, and yet these were the same people who had taken Di\nLauro down. I asked them if they believed in the superiority of the Italian\nstate, and all but one replied no. That one said, to paraphrase, \u201cWe have no\nchoice. The Camorra has created an anti-state whose very existence threatens\nthe legitimacy of the Italian state. If the courts did not act, they would not\nbe real. If the courts are not real, Italy will not endure. Our role is not to\nprevail over the Camorra but to go through the motions of trying.\u201d I mentioned\nthis to a Camorra defense lawyer. She knew the judge in question. She said,\n\u201cThe anti-state is the state itself. It is the state, not the Camorra, that is\nstrangling Italy.\u201d She seemed to prefer the criminals to the officials. Most\nNeapolitans would agree. They demonstrate daily the extent to which they can\nlive without Italy. And if Di Lauro ever came back, their celebrations would\nshut down the city.\n\nThat will probably never happen. Di Lauro will turn 59 this year in a maximum-\nsecurity prison 40 miles northwest of Rome in the town of Viterbo. He is being\nheld there under a prison regime called 41-bis\u2014a program of severe and\nindefinite isolation by which Mafia leaders can be kept under 24-hour\nsurveillance, cut off from contact even with guards, denied access to national\nor regional news, and allowed visits only from their lawyers and, for one hour\na month\u2014behind plate glass, by monitored phone\u2014a designated member of their\nimmediate family accompanied only by those children who are minors. The\nprimary intent is to separate Mafia leaders from their organizations, and to\nprevent them from directing operations from within the prisons. The resulting\nconditions, however, are so extreme that in 2007 the European Court of Human\nRights held that certain aspects are in violation of the European Convention\non Human Rights, and that same year a U.S. judge refused to extradite a heroin\ntrafficker to Italy because of concerns that 41-bis would be applied to him\nand might constitute torture. Indeed, the regime, which is easily lifted when\nthe government chooses, has repeatedly served a coercive purpose, ultimately\npersuading a line of hardened men to give evidence to the courts in return for\nrelief from the promise of eternal solitude.\n\nBut Di Lauro is not one of them. It is not clear whether he has anything to\nread. I have been told that he spends his time in contemplation, chain-smoking\ncigarettes. It is an extraordinarily disciplined response. He knows that he\ncan end the suffering if he begins to talk, but this he refuses to do.\nInstead, he has chosen the opposite course, an even greater extreme than\n41-bis imposes, and has begun refusing not only any further contact with\nlawyers, but also the monthly conversation he is allowed with his wife. He\nmust still love her, but he is the master of silence. Trapped by the state, he\nremains the master of himself.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Calvin Harris's Wife, Vick Hope, Listens to His Ex-Girlfriend Taylor Swift's Music \"As Soon As\" He Leaves\n\nBy Kase Wickman\n\n  * Anna Sawai\u2019s Empowering, Enthralling Journey Through Sh\u014dgun\n\nBy David Canfield\n\n  * Sister, Sister: Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine\u2019s Lifelong Feud\n\nBy Hadley Hall Meares\n\n# William Langewiesche\n\nWilliam Langewiesche is Vanity Fair\u2019s international correspondent.\n\nSee More By William Langewiesche \u00bb\n\n### Cocktail Hour\n\nOur essential daily brief on culture, news, and style.\n\nRead More\n\nCelebrity\n\nCalvin Harris's Wife, Vick Hope, Listens to His Ex-Girlfriend Taylor Swift's\nMusic \"As Soon As\" He Leaves\n\n\u201cAs soon as my husband goes away, I listen to Taylor Swift,\u201d she said.\n\nBy Kase Wickman\n\nAward Season\n\nAnna Sawai\u2019s Empowering, Enthralling Journey Through Sh\u014dgun\n\nAs Sawai\u2019s Mariko reaches a major turning point, the breakout reflects on her\nown twisting path to stardom.\n\nBy David Canfield\n\nHollywood\n\nSister, Sister: Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine\u2019s Lifelong Feud\n\nThe Oscar-winning siblings endured one of Hollywood\u2019s most riveting rivalries,\nas recounted in each of their memoirs.\n\nBy Hadley Hall Meares\n\nPolitics\n\nNone of This Is Normal\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s 2024 bid is an antidemocratic revenge fantasy being treated\nlike a conventional political campaign.\n\nBy Molly Jong-Fast\n\n$2.50 $1/mo for 1 year + a free tote.\n\nJoin now\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
