It's often used to make data easy\nto explore and visualize.\n\n# 2D example\n\nFirst, consider a dataset in only two dimensions, like (height, weight). This\ndataset can be plotted as points in a plane. But if we want to tease out\nvariation, PCA finds a new coordinate system in which every point has a new\n(x,y) value. The axes don't actually mean anything physical; they're\ncombinations of height and weight called \"principal components\" that are\nchosen to give one axes lots of variation.\n\nDrag the points around in the following visualization to see PC coordinate\nsystem adjusts.\n\nPCA is useful for eliminating dimensions. Below, we've plotted the data along\na pair of lines: one composed of the x-values and another of the y-values.\n\nIf we're going to only see the data along one dimension, though, it might be\nbetter to make that dimension the principal component with most variation. We\ndon't lose much by dropping PC2 since it contributes the least to the\nvariation in the data set.\n\n# 3D example\n\nWith three dimensions, PCA is more useful, because it's hard to see through a\ncloud of data. In the example below, the original data are plotted in 3D, but\nyou can project the data into 2D through a transformation no different than\nfinding a camera angle: rotate the axes to find the best angle. To see the\n\"official\" PCA transformation, click the \"Show PCA\" button. The PCA\ntransformation ensures that the horizontal axis PC1 has the most variation,\nthe vertical axis PC2 the second-most, and a third axis PC3 the least.\nObviously, PC3 is the one we drop.\n\n# Eating in the UK (a 17D example)\n\nOriginal example from Mark Richardson's class notes Principal Component\nAnalysis\n\nWhat if our data have way more than 3-dimensions? Like, 17 dimensions?! In the\ntable is the average consumption of 17 types of food in grams per person per\nweek for every country in the UK.\n\nThe table shows some interesting variations across different food types, but\noverall differences aren't so notable. Let's see if PCA can eliminate\ndimensions to emphasize how countries differ.\n\nHere's the plot of the data along the first principal component. Already we\ncan see something is different about Northern Ireland.\n\nNow, see the first and second principal components, we see Northern Ireland a\nmajor outlier. Once we go back and look at the data in the table, this makes\nsense: the Northern Irish eat way more grams of fresh potatoes and way fewer\nof fresh fruits, cheese, fish and alcoholic drinks. It's a good sign that\nstructure we've visualized reflects a big fact of real-world geography:\nNorthern Ireland is the only of the four countries not on the island of Great\nBritain. (If you're confused about the differences among England, the UK and\nGreat Britain, see: this video.)\n\nFor more explanations, visit the Explained Visually project homepage.\n\nOr subscribe to our mailing list.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
