But physicists have now managed to directly image a \u201cWigner\ncrystal\u201d \u2013 and their images are the clearest ones yet.\n\n\u201cThere have been many, literally hundreds, of papers written on finding\nevidence for the Wigner crystal sort of indirectly,\u201d says Ali Yazdani at\nPrinceton University. \u201cAnd we never thought that we would succeed in\n[directly] imaging it. It was a bit of an accident.\u201d\n\nAt room temperature, electrons can flow together in electric currents because\ntheir kinetic energy overcomes the force that makes particles with the same\nelectric charge repel each other. At very low temperatures, however, repulsive\nelectric forces win out, and the electrons end up arranging themselves into a\nuniform grid, or a crystal. Physicist Eugene Wigner predicted this phenomenon\nin 1934, but researchers only recently started to understand how to create\nWigner crystals in the lab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more\n\nQuantum weirdness isn\u2019t weird \u2013 if we accept objects don\u2019t exist\n\nYazdani and his colleagues made their Wigner crystal from electrons inside of\ntwo thin sheets of graphene, each only one atom thick. To diminish the\nelectrons\u2019 kinetic energy, they put the graphene inside a fridge that cooled\nit to only a few hundredths of a degree above absolute zero and immersed it in\na strong magnetic field.\n\nYazdani says that it was crucial that their graphene had very few\nimperfections where electrons could get stuck. Otherwise, the particles could\nform a crystal-like state because of the structure of those imperfections,\nrather than because of the interactions with each other, as Wigner predicted.\n\n#### Sign up to our Lost in Space-Time newsletter\n\nUntangle the weirdness of reality with our monthly newsletter.\n\nSign up to newsletter\n\nIn past experiments, researchers would look for evidence of a Wigner crystal\nby trying to nudge electrons into forming currents: once the particles failed\nto flow, researchers could infer that the electrons were locked into a grid.\nBut Yazdani\u2019s team directly imaged its crystal with a special microscope.\n\nThis microscope used a quantum effect called tunnelling. It scanned an\nextremely sharp metallic tip across the surface of the graphene, and when it\npassed over an electron, the particle would tunnel through the gap between the\nsurface and the tip, creating a small electric current. Because of these\ncurrents, the researchers knew where and how densely the electrons were\npositioned inside the graphene, letting them create the most precise images of\na Wigner crystal yet.\n\nOne other experiment used this method previously, but in that case, the grid\nof electrons was inside of a material that was itself sandwiched between\nlayers of other materials. This made the imaging less direct, and it made it\nharder to determine why the electrons formed a crystal \u2013 they could have been\ninfluenced by the grid-like structure of the nearby materials.\n\nIn their images, Yazdani and his colleagues saw electrons sitting at vertices\nof repeating triangles, just as Wigner predicted. Additionally, they tracked\nhow the crystal\u2019s structure changed as they shifted factors such as\ntemperature, the strength of the magnetic field and how many electrons it\ncontained, which they could do by applying an electric voltage to the\nmaterial. Under these changing conditions, the crystal \u201cmelted\u201d into an\nexotic, incompressible electron fluid, as well as a fluid where electrons\nformed stripes.\n\nThese melted states are what the team wants to image next. Some of them are\nfull of particle-like excitations, which are like electrons but only carry a\nfraction of their charge. Yazdani hopes he and his collaborators could image\nthe excitations\u2019 crystallisation too.\n\nJournal reference:\n\nNature DOI: 10.1038/s41586-024-07212-7\n\nTopics:\n\n  * quantum physics\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Sign up to our weekly newsletter\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!
