The only dialysis now available\nis for kidneys.\n\nProfessor Jalan, whose work underpins the treatments, said: \u201cThis is\nrevolutionary because at the moment we treat these patients with antibiotics\nand if you treat them for a year or 18 months they introduce many resistant\nstrains.\u201d\n\nDaniel Green, chief executive of Yaqrit, the UCL spinout company developing\nthe treatments, said liver disease had been neglected for years even though it\nwas largely preventable. It was also the only widespread potentially fatal\ncondition where death rates were still increasing: \u201cLook at heart disease,\nrespiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer, and there are new products the whole\ntime but there [has been] virtually nothing for [obesity and alcohol-related]\nliver disease. \u201cWe know what the problems are for antibiotics. This will\ntransform it from a 20th-century to a 21st-century treatment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Professor Jalan, if the trials are successful patients would take\na teaspoon of nanoporous carbon in a sachet before bedtime. The carbon would\nremove toxins produced by bacteria in the gut that would otherwise enter the\nbody and liver, allowing them to pass harmlessly through the body.\n\nUnderlying Professor Jalan\u2019s treatment is the understanding that although the\nliver is damaged directly by alcohol and fatty food, it is the bacterial\ntoxins getting through the gut wall that exacerbate the damage.\n\nAbout 40,000 people in the UK have cirrhosis of the liver, according to the\nBritish Liver Trust, but about one in five of the population is at risk of\ndeveloping serious liver problems at some point. Over the past decade there\nhas been a five-fold increase in the development of cirrhosis in those aged 35\nto 55.\n\nThere were 916 liver transplants in the past year and approximately 600 people\nare on the liver transplant waiting list.\n\nProfessor Jalan said: \u201cIf the clinical trials are successful, it could\nrevolutionise the management of patients with liver disease as statins have\ndone for patients with high cholesterol levels and insulin has done for\ndiabetic patients.\u201d\n\nProduction of the carbon beads will start soon in Hampshire and 48 patients\nwill take part in the first trial. The research projects received \u20ac12.4m\n(\u00a310.6m) of European Union Horizon 2020 research funding.\n\nAndrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said: \u201cIf\nsuccessful, this treatment could prove vital for anyone who has been diagnosed\nwith cirrhosis as it may help prevent the complications caused by infections.\nLiver disease often does not have any symptoms and those at risk of developing\nthe disease are often missed. This means that three-quarters of people already\nhave severe problems or cirrhosis at the point of diagnosis when the options\nfor treatment are limited.\u201d\n\nEmailFacebookTwitterLinkedInShare\n\nWebsite developed by Moore-Wilson\n\nWe use cookies on this website.
