But how often do these drugs\nactually improve or extend patients\u2019 lives?\n\nIn a new study, researchers found that most cancer drugs granted accelerated\napproval do not demonstrate such benefits within five years.\n\n\u201cFive years after the initial accelerated approval, you should have a\ndefinitive answer,\u201d said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a cancer specialist and\nbioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the\nresearch. \u201cThousands of people are getting those drugs. That seems a mistake\nif we don\u2019t know whether they work or not.\"\n\nThe program was created in 1992 to speed access to HIV drugs. Today, 85% of\naccelerated approvals go to cancer drugs.\n\nIt allows the FDA to grant early approval to drugs that show promising initial\nresults for treating debilitating or fatal diseases. In exchange, drug\ncompanies are expected to do rigorous testing and produce better evidence\nbefore gaining full approval.\n\nRead More: Why Are So Many Young People Getting Cancer? It\u2019s Complicated\n\nPatients get access to drugs earlier, but the tradeoff means some of the\nmedications don\u2019t pan out. It's up to the FDA or the drugmaker to withdraw\ndisappointing drugs, and sometimes the FDA has decided that less definitive\nevidence is good enough for a full approval.\n\nThe new study found that between 2013 and 2017, there were 46 cancer drugs\ngranted accelerated approval. Of those, 63% were converted to regular approval\neven though only 43% demonstrated a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\n\nThe research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association\nand discussed at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting\nin San Diego on Sunday.\n\nIt's unclear how much cancer patients understand about drugs with accelerated\napproval, said study co-author Dr. Edward Cliff of Harvard Medical School.\n\n\u201cWe raise the question: Is that uncertainty being conveyed to patients?\u201d Cliff\nsaid.\n\nDrugs that got accelerated approval may be the only option for patients with\nrare or advanced cancers, said Dr. Jennifer Litton of MD Anderson Cancer\nCenter in Houston, who was not involved in the study.\n\nIt\u2019s important for doctors to carefully explain the evidence, Litton said.\n\n\u201cIt might be shrinking of tumor. It might be how long the tumor stays stable,\u201d\nLitton said. \u201cYou can provide the data you have, but you shouldn\u2019t\noverpromise.\u201d\n\nCongress recently updated the program, giving the FDA more authority and\nstreamlining the process for withdrawing drugs when companies don\u2019t meet their\ncommitments.\n\nThe changes allow the agency \u201cto withdraw approval for a drug approved under\naccelerated approval, when appropriate, more quickly,\u201d FDA spokesperson Cherie\nDuvall-Jones wrote in an email. The FDA can now require that a confirmatory\ntrial be underway when it grants preliminary approval, which speeds up the\nprocess of verifying whether a drug works, she said.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * Exclusive: Google Workers Revolt Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n  * Stop Looking for Your Forever Home\n  * Jane Fonda Champions Climate Action for Every Generation\n  * Hormonal Birth Control Doesn\u2019t Deserve Its Bad Reputation\n  * The Sympathizer Counters 50 Years of Hollywood Vietnam War Narratives\n  * Essay: The Relentless Cost of Chronic Diseases\n  * The Best TV Shows to Watch on Peacock\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
