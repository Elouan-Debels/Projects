The actual situation\nchanges slowly, so presumably the pace of interesting new things should slow\ndown over time from here.\n\n####\n\nDemographics\n\nThis time around, a visualization. Where will the next 1,000 babies be born?\n\n####\n\nPopulation Trends\n\nScott Lincicome notes American population now expected to peak in 2080 at 369\nmillion.\n\nSouth Korea now down to 0.7 births per woman. The story of South Korea is told\nas a resounding success, of a country that made itself rich and prosperous.\nBut what does it profit us, if we become nominally rich and prosperous, but\nwith conditions so hostile that we cannot or will not bring children into\nthem? If the rule you followed led you here, of what use was the rule? Why\nshould others follow it?\n\nMore Births reminds us that we have indeed seen countries fall below\nreplacement level and come roaring back, most famously in the Baby Boom.\nCultural trends can go any number of ways.\n\n> Basil: The fertility rate drops from 2015 -> 2023 are insane in just EIGHT\n> YEARS:\n>\n> France: 1.96 -> 1.68\n>\n> Sweden: 1.85 -> 1.42\n>\n> America: 1.84 -> 1.64\n>\n> UK: 1.78 -> 1.45\n>\n> Russia: 1.78 -> 1.41\n>\n> China: 1.75 -> 1.05 (wtf)\n>\n> Germany: 1.50 -> 1.42\n>\n> South Korea: 1.24 -> .73 (jesus christ)\n>\n> Netherlands: 1.55 -> 1.45\n>\n> Canada: 1.60 -> 1.25\n>\n> Japan: 1.45 -> 1.21\n>\n> Poland: 1.44 -> 1.28\n>\n> Taiwan: 1.18 -> 0.86\n\nThose are LFR numbers, so the actual changes are presumably bigger.\n\nSingapore falls to historic low of 0.97. New figures have South Korea at 0.72.\n\nI continue to say that if the numbers can decline this fast, they can also\nbounce back. Indeed do many things come to pass, and we can expect\ntransformational technological change. Things have looked bleak or inevitable\nbefore. Don\u2019t lose hope.\n\nAfter that, China\u2019s numbers came in for 2023 and they are even worse. The\npopulation already shrunk by 2 million in 2023, a trend that will rapidly\naccelerate by default.\n\nThat WSJ article ends with a Harvard professor saying China should not pursue\n\u2018higher\u2019 birthrates, allowing itself to quickly cease to exist, in order to\ninstead address nominal measures of well being.\n\n> Martin Whyte, a sociology professor emeritus at Harvard University, said in\n> an essay in China-US Focus, run by the independent China-United States\n> Exchange Foundation, last year that instead of pursuing higher birthrates,\n> China should focus on improving the welfare of its people, such as expanding\n> education opportunities for rural youths and reducing gender discrimination.\n\nWhat is the point of \u2018opportunity\u2019 and non-discrimination, if there is no\nfuture? What use is an education in a rapidly aging and thus economically\ncrashing country facing a population collapse?\n\n####\n\nCauses\n\nEmmett Shear points out that people see gradients of relative reward, rather\nthan looking at absolute rewards. This is a key reason that as societies get\nricher, people have fewer kids rather than more kids. If you want to fix this,\nyou need to differentially give parents, and only parents, money, and also\nother resources including respect and status.\n\nMany who advocate for pro-fertility policies end up focusing on money because\nthat is an easier knob to turn, and an easier knob to measure in terms of\nimpact, and everyone keeps not trying it. But yes, the true low-hanging fruit\nis largely in culture.\n\nThe boredom theory of fertility, that people have lots of alternative ways to\nspend their time that do not involve or lead to kids or relationships, or any\nmeaningful interactions with other humans, seems underrated.\n\n> Birth Gauge: As the fertility decline was the most pronounced among\n> teenagers and young adults in all of these cases, the widespread\n> availability of affordable smartphones for everyone that started in the mid\n> 2010s is a powerful explanation of the overall trend.\n>\n> Being connected to the whole virtual world is obviously more interesting\n> than casual unprotected sex, hence the strong decline of teenage\n> pregnancies.

Yes.\n\nChildren cost vast amounts of time and money, and we bar any attempts to use\nthem to recoup those costs. If you want to make the necessary money, you\nmostly need to spend time, and increasingly modern work has increasing\nmarginal returns to time. Meanwhile, we have made raising children far less\nrewarding and pleasant, on top of its economic burden.\n\nReduce the time and other lifestyle costs of raising children, reduce the\nmonetary costs, provide other benefits, pay parents money. Ideally in that\norder. This isn\u2019t hard.\n\n> Robin Hanson: \"U.S. government would have to spend approximately half of its\n> expected lifetime tax receipts if it wanted to fully offset families\u2019 costs\n> of having a child.\" So, its feasible then.\n>\n> Eliezer Yudkowsky: On the pronatalist side, deregulate childcare first and\n> then talk about pumping demand?

You can always trust Robin to be\n> consistent from his own perspective and he's usually pretty consistent from\n> my own perspective too.\n\nI would indeed vastly prefer to deregulate childcare, but also we have not\nregulated any of this via hard caps that would eat any subsidies we gave to\nparents. I do not think this is an infinite cost engine as such. So I do think\nthe subsidy plan would work. And I agree with Robin that, while the costs look\nextreme, the return on investment to even the most brute force interventions\nis clearly positive. There are still vastly better ways.\n\nMore Births gets into a debate with Ross Douthat about cultural causes of\ndeclining fertility, disputing Douthat\u2019s claim that Ehrlich\u2019s ideas and\nrelated motivations are not a major factor. There is indeed a major actively\nanti-natal movement in play.\n\n####\n\nCauses: South Korea\n\nThe anti-planner claims that South Korea has such a low birth rate in large\npart because of its high rises. Without the room for more kids, people don\u2019t\nhave more kids.\n\nI see two potential arguments one can make here. One is that square footage of\nyour apartment is too expensive, because high rises are more expensive than\nalternative housing, which is the point made here. In that case it is purely\nabout housing prices, and I expect the additional high rise construction costs\nto both not ultimately much matter and to be dwarfed by supply and demand\nconsiderations. Besides, if they are so much more expensive, what is stopping\nthe midsize buildings from being built, exactly? This would also be a self-\ncorrecting problem as the population declines.\n\nThe other case is that it is about outdoor space and distance to the outdoors.\nIf you concentrate that many families in one place, they perhaps have nowhere\nreasonable to go outside, although the high rises could also allow quite a lot\nof green space, and elevators work pretty well.\n\nI do believe in the housing theory of everything and that expensive housing is\na large part of the problem here, but it seems weird to blame it on the high\nrises, rather than on the country packing so many people into relatively\nlittle space. If anything, as the post notes, Seoul and the other very\nexpansive urban areas are less dense than American cities like Philadelphia,\nbut the solution to that is not to not build high rises, it is to also build\nmore other housing.\n\nLyman Stone offers another analysis, also centering housing details but also\nother problems. South Koreans have subsidized housing, yes, but what they get\nis not good for family life. Formal contracts made it impossible to capture\nyour children\u2019s wages as was previously common, and the welfare state is weak,\nso everyone is obsessed with saving as much money as possible.\n\nOn the issue of gender inequality, Lyman points to the gap in attitudes, that\nmen think the women are too feminist and the women think the men are too\nsexist, so they can\u2019t reach harmony. Then there\u2019s the k-pop music industry\n(!), which is heavily state-supported, a pervasive cultural phenomenon, and\ncontractually single, childless and youth focused, driving cultural norms.\n\nPhoebe Arslangic-Little asks why free taxis, free IVF and subsidized housing,\nwhich she calls \u2018showering couples with cash\u2019 hasn\u2019t worked. Right off the bat\nI would say, yes that all helps, but define \u2018showering.\u2019 The subsidies offered\na small fraction of total economic costs, and are dwarfed by the changes and\nissues raised by Lyman Stone.\n\nPhoebe instead focuses on sexist attitudes pressuring women. And yeah, it\nsounds bad.\n\n> Phoebe Arslangic-Little: Sexist attitudes put tremendous pressure on South\n> Korean women.\n>\n> In 2019 the government warned pregnant women not to look disheveled while\n> cooking their husband's meals...\n>\n> And 53% of South Koreans think women have less right to a job than men when\n> jobs are scarce.\n>\n> Workplace maternity discrimination is also rife, forcing women to choose\n> between parenthood and a career.\n>\n> As a result, South Korea has the biggest gender pay gap in the OECD.\n>\n> Change is happening, but there is a growing backlash, with young South\n> Korean men spearheading a vigorous anti-feminist movement.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Adding a post to reflect an extremely good point made by @lymanstoneky (&\n> others): \"Where Korea is unique is in the yawning gap in gender attitudes\n> between reproductive age men and women.\" It's this values gap especially\n> that contributes to SK's problems.\n\nTraditional sexist attitudes and sexism were more severe than this pretty much\neverywhere, and made life worse in many ways for women and especially mothers.\nThey were however part of a cultural package selected and designed in large\npart for high fertility.\n\nIf you get rid of the sexism, life improves, but you also remove the cultural\npackage that was enhancing fertility. Without the help and together with the\nshifting economics and other realities of raising a family, fertility seems to\nreliably drop below replacement, so you need to replace the old incentives\nwith new ones somehow.\n\nYou can, however, do so much worse.\n\nIf you get rid of the fertility-load-bearing parts of the old culture, but you\nkeep the sexism, as appears to be what happened in South Korea, then you get\nthe worst of both worlds. Life sucks a lot more whether you have kids or not,\nand you make having children look like a stupendously bad deal, so people\ndon\u2019t do it.\n\nIt is hard to look at a government that warns pregnant women \u2018not to look\ndisheveled while cooking their husband\u2019s meals\u2019 and see one that cares about\nfertility. Or a government that heavily subsidizes its pop music industry\nwhile forcing its stars to remain single and childless, as I will discuss\nbelow.\n\nSo yes, that is how you get a situation where you can correctly respond to\n'how can we raise fertility\u2019 with \u2018you need more gender equality and less\nsexism.\u2019 We know from other places that fixing that will not be sufficient,\nbut at this point it seems necessary.\n\nMore Births highlights the k-pop angle, where its stars are forced to stay\nsingle and childless, and speculates it is a big deal. It is certainly a\nfactor unique to South Korea.\n\n> More Births: Although it would be difficult to prove, it seems likely that\n> the KPOP industry's bizarre demand that its stars remain single is\n> reinforcing a sexless and childless culture. This may be hurting global\n> fertility rates given KPOP's massive global reach.\n>\n> If K-Pop made an effort to be supportive of its stars having partners and\n> families, that could boost fertility in \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 and worldwide!\n>\n> Not only that - if K-Pop became pro-family, it would likely boost relations\n> with the North, which is deeply distrustful of the South's culture.\n>\n> Stone points to the vast political divide between men and women in South\n> Korea as another thing that is likely lowering birthrates. I concur. I wrote\n> last month how these days, inter-political marriage is less common than\n> interracial marriage!\n\nI have no idea the magnitude of the impact of k-pop, but it sure isn\u2019t\nhelping. A government that was serious about saving the country would pivot to\na pro-family cultural agenda.\n\nSouth Korea also has to fix the economics. Phoebe only mentions IVF:\n\n> Phoebe Arslangic-Little: South Korea's policies aren't working at least in\n> part because free IVF does nothing to end the sharp trade-off between career\n> and motherhood that women face, or to alleviate the pressure of traditional\n> gender attitudes.\n\nIt is odd to focus this much on IVF. Even at $0, this is still a rather\nannoying procedure. Even in South Korea it is only responsible for 7.2% of\nbirths versus 2.1% in the United States. That\u2019s an additional 5.1% of births,\npresumably as a result of making it free, not all of which are additional\ncounterfactual births, although I think most of them are. Also, \u2018free\u2019 is a\nmisnomer here, they subsidize but it is far from the full cost.\n\nThey should pay for all of it within reason (obviously not infinite cycles for\nincentive reasons), as a first step or down payment.\n\nFree IVF is great because you are mostly subsidizing marginal births, and\ndoing so exactly at the pain point and where there is a liquidity crunch.\nNotice how nicely targeted the subsidy looks. The subsidy is really tiny, and\nI can see how this both unlocks a real liquidity or affordability bottleneck,\nand also changes the emotional valiance of the decision far out of proportion\nto the amount.\n\nSo this is likely a key part of the low hanging fruit of subsidizing more\nbirths, the most efficient path we have available. We already essentially\nthink health care should be a human right and mostly covered by insurance\neveryone has, so in a sense the marginal cost here is very close to zero.\n\n####\n\nCauses: South Korea: Status Competition\n\nHere is another perspective. A new paper argues that a major cause of South\nKorean low fertility is status competition, in particular pressure to spend on\neducation.\n\n> East Asians, especially South Koreans, appear to be preoccupied with their\n> offspring\u2019s education\u2014most children spend time in expensive private\n> institutes and in cram schools in the evenings and on weekends. At the same\n> time, South Korea currently has the lowest total fertility rate in the\n> world. Motivated by novel empirical evidence on spillovers in private\n> education spending, we propose a theory with status externalities and\n> endogenous fertility that connects these two facts.\n>\n> Using a quantitative heterogeneous-agent model calibrated to Korea, we find\n> that fertility would be 28% higher in the absence of the status externality\n> and that childlessness in the poorest quintile would fall from five to less\n> than one percent. We then explore the effects of various government\n> policies. A pro-natal transfer or an education tax can increase fertility\n> and reduce education spending, with heterogeneous effects across the income\n> distribution.\n>\n> The policy mix that maximizes the current generation\u2019s welfare consists of\n> an education tax of 22% and moderate pro-natal transfers.\n>\n> This would raise average fertility by about 11% and decrease education\n> spending by 39%. Although this policy increases the welfare of the current\n> generation, it may not do the same for future generations as it lowers their\n> human capital.\n\nAcademics cannot fathom the idea that education spending might not enhance\nhuman capital at the margin. In a hyper-competitive system where every child\u2019s\nlives are swallowed by the competition, often along with those of the parents\nand also their bank accounts, and without the slack to succeed via actual\ncuriosity and learning? It seems likely that the education spending is\nactively wasteful.\n\nIf my calculations are correct, then a tax on education spending, which is\nthen remitted to parents generally, is clearly welfare-improving across the\nboard.\n\nThe current situation is clearly unsustainable on its face:\n\n> Another notable feature of Korean society is that children\u2019s education is\n> very highly valued by parents. This preoccupation with education is\n> sometimes called \u201ceducation fever,\u201d echoing the title of a popular book by\n> Michael Seth (2002). Many teenagers attend math and English classes in\n> private education institutes called hagwons, often as late as midnight.\n> Others, meanwhile, spend numerous hours each week with a private tutor.\n>\n> Participation rates in after-school programs are around 75%. These private\n> education investments are so expensive that, on average, an individual\n> family spends as much as 9.2% of their income per child on education (even\n> though most children attend public schools).\n>\n> In this paper, we propose a new mechanism that connects high education\n> spending with low birth rates. The novel ingredient is a status externality\n> in which parents value the education of their children relative to the\n> education of other children\n\nYes. Because that is what education is primarily about at such margins. It is\na zero-sum status competition, a signaling game, a Red Queen\u2019s race.\n\n> Using regional variation in the change of late-night curfews on hagwons as\n> instruments, we find that lower spending on private education among\n> relatively rich families lowered private education expenditures of\n> socioeconomically disadvantaged (i.e., low-income or low-education)\n> families.\n\nThis is not obviously the correct way to react if you seek relative status. If\nhigh-income families are investing less in their children\u2019s education, then\nthat likely increases rather than decreases returns to effort by low-income\nfamilies, as they have a better chance of getting ahead.\n\nSo this seems a lot more like cultural pressures and norms and patterns? You\nsee what others are doing, you feel you must do it also.\n\nWhereas the correct way to play is actually the opposite. In America a few\ndecades ago, when others are putting in relatively low effort considering, you\ncould reliably get to an elite college via the tiger mom all-in high-\ninvestment strategy. That is plausibly a very good return.\n\nWhereas in South Korea now, if you run that race, everyone is running it with\nyou, all you are doing is staying put as everyone drowns. The only way to win\nis not to play. As the population shrinks and there are too few workers for\ntoo many jobs, your well-rounded kids who stayed home learning to code will\nthrive, and you could afford more of them that way.\n\nNote that the intervention mechanism still works, and perhaps works better, if\neveryone is trying to make educational investments relative to those around\nthem, rather than trying to get relative status via results.\n\nThe paper attempts to estimate the fertility effects of transfers. They\ncompare their results to Kim (2020), which found that cash transfers raised\nthe fertility rate in South Korea by 3%, with payments of very roughly 680 USD\nfor the first child, 926 for the second and 2,350 for the third. Also note:\n\n> Hong et al. (2016) estimate the causal effect of these transfers in Korea\n> using regional and time variation, finding that a one-time cash bonus of\n> 1,000 USD increases the crude birth rate by 4.4%.\n\nSo that\u2019s a very easy one to estimate from, you pay a little under $23k per\nbirth. That is super affordable. Still, I question the methodologies here. The\nnew paper seems not to have great justification for its calculations. I find\nthem plausible, but a lot of numbers could be plausible.\n\nEvery time I read about South Korea the situation seems worse. The linked post\nhas women working 9-6, saying they have no time for anything else, often\nstudying and getting an IV drip on weekends to be able to keep working and\nacting like that is normal, talk of women forced to leave their jobs or passed\nover for promotions due to having a child.\n\nSouth Korea teaches women they are supposed to be the equals of men. Then it\nexerts, on everyone, pressures that will crush you if you take on something\nlike a family, and also teaches everyone that men are useless at home, so\nwomen are told they should choose career over family then told they must\nchoose. So they do.\n\nAlso there is talk of expensive supplemental classes mentioned above as\nessentially culturally mandatory starting at age four, with 94% (!!!) saying\nit was a financial burden and only 2% not paying private tuition, with the\nresulting pressure consuming everyone through their 20s.\n\n> Only now, aged 32, does Minji feel free, and able to enjoy herself. She\n> loves to travel and is learning to dive.\n>\n> But her biggest consideration is that she does not want to put a child\n> through the same competitive misery she experienced.\n\nIf it is truly that bad, then there are essentially three choices: Ban, tax or\npay for it. Given it is a dystopian status competition hell, pay for it seems\nterrible, but if we have 98% participation now and 94% financial hardship,\nthen this could be a way to justify a huge de facto transfer to parents.\n\nIf New York City paid $20,000 per child per year to parents, everyone would be\nscreaming about how awful that was and how parents would have kids to collect\nthe check. Pay that much and more per child for public schools and no one much\nminds. That\u2019s the reason to do in-kind payments, it makes them politically\nviable by guarding against profiteering.\n\nSomething is going to have to give. It is time for a lot More Dakka.\n\n####\n\nMore Dakka\n\nIt looks like rather large payments for children are indeed about to be tried\nin South Korea. Not on a country level, which would be ideal, but rather on a\ncorporate level. At $75,000 per birth, this is serious money, enough to\nactually change people\u2019s decisions, as opposed to a \u2018baby payment\u2019 of $2,250\nthat is nice but not going to move the needle so much.\n\nThe potential selection problems are obvious. Once you announce the policy,\npeople will want to work for you if they already planned on having children.\nThat makes it impossible to know how many additional births this actually\ninduced. My guess is it is still quite a lot.\n\nAlso I am betting that you get a ton of very good workers, very loyal to you\nand to each other, who come together as a team and kick serious butt.\n\nIf something like this does not work, the next step I suppose is to accept\nthat South Korea has a culture where women cannot have it all, that there is\nno slack permitted in life, and that this problem exists in increasingly many\nplaces but they have it the worst.\n\nWhich implies three potential solutions if you have to intervene economically\nrather than directly on culture. You can do one or more.\n\n  1. Either you can actually pass and enforce labor laws that make families compatible with having good jobs and provide enough incentive to the employer that they can go along with it.\n\n  2. Or you can accept that being a mother is going to be a full-time job, you can create paths to doing a new type of less intensive job that is compatible and provide regulatory or monetary subsidies to that.\n\n  3. Or you can fully bite the bullet and say that being a mother of sufficiently many children is a noble full time job and compensate it like you mean that. As in, pay them a large fraction of the median salary and do it even if they have a husband that works. You don\u2019t have to like it, but there are no good choices.\n\nWhat determines the amount that is affordable?\n\n> Simone Collins: Is there some amount we could pay people to get them to have\n> kids? Of course. Is there an amount a government would be able to pay (i.e.,\n> something that would pass in Congress) that would make a significant\n> difference? The answer is no.

What about in the future? That depends on how much things shift.\n\nBorrowing against the taxes from a future citizen only counts as \u2018affordable\u2019\nif you borrow against the surplus, and include the financing costs. A child\nborn today can expect to pay quite a lot in taxes over their lifetime. And of\ncourse they already are effectively taking on their share of the national\ndebt. I don\u2019t know exactly what the answer should be here. I am confident that\nthe answer is \u2018a lot.\u2019\n\nA claim that subsidizing child care does not raise birth rates, and some very\nstrong counterarguments.\n\n> Lyman Stone: I like @jburnmurdoch but this entire post is wrong and detached\n> from the scholarly literature.

It forces parents to deal\nwith an anti-marriage, and anti-income welfare state, it forces the modality\nof using commercial childcare at scale which many parents reasonably feel\nterrible using, it greatly raises the costs of childcare for those not getting\nthe subsidies, and you get the benefits slowly over years in a way that is not\nso fungible. So one can expect this to be a pretty terrible policy, and also\nto be substituting for other policy and reflective of a culture that does not\nunderstand what it is to be a family or actually value children. It would be\nunsurprising if it was not correlated with higher birth rates in practice.\n\n####\n\nLess But Nonzero Dakka\n\nFlint, Michigan offers new mothers $1,500 for pregnancy and $500 per month for\nthe first twelve months, with no income test. This seems excellent. Alas,\nthere is a limit to how much a local area can do, given that people can move\nand the costs are paid locally while benefits largely accrue nationally.\nOffering $7,500 total is likely on the high end of what is practical before\npeople start inefficiently gaming the system.\n\nConsidering the cost of raising a kid in America has been estimated at\n$20,813, or a combined $237,482, one can see why $7,500 is nice but is very\nmuch not going to cut it.\n\nIn case it needs to be said, I am paying quite a lot more than this to raise\nmy three children. If you do not count taxes, they account for the majority of\nfamily expenses.\n\nAnna North of Vox is the latest to interpret cash payment programs as\nfailures. I continue to see the implied marginal costs as affordable, and like\nRobin Hanson I say one can simply pay more. Also pay more in the form of a\nlump sum, which is much more efficient than convoluted policies or increased\nleave that many do not even want.\n\nGuarantees of maternity leave increases the measured gender pay gap,\nincreasing the measured motherhood pay gap, and increased the likelihood of\nfirst children but decreased the chance of additional children. There is the\nnote that without leave more women leave the workforce entirely, which\ndecreases the pay gap as measured while increasing the real one. Based on\nfirst principles of economics this is not surprising. Once again, if you want\nto help out new parents, much better to give them money directly rather than\ntrying to give them things indirectly, and let people find what arrangements\nwork for them.\n\n####\n\nPreferences\n\nAn absurdly biased sample, still worth noting.\n\nMy favorite response was from Adamas Nemesis, pointing out that you could\nlikely use that billion to bankroll having a bunch of additional children. A\nstrong case.\n\nIf we take the spirit of the question, however, and assume the billions are\nsterile, then I do think this is rather clear. Also a hell of a willingness to\npay.\n\n> Miri Vinnie: We actually have data on this! And the answer is: not much\n> Women who want kids generally want at least 2, thus the % of one-child\n> families hasn\u2019t changed at all in 30 yrs. But instead of having 2 they\u2019re\n> having 0. Most often because they don\u2019t have anyone to have kids with.\n>\n> Cartoons Hate Her: She\u2019s right, and also, I don\u2019t understand why the\n> declining birth rate is seen as \u201cwomen choosing to have fewer kids\u201d when\n> often women want more kids than their husbands do.\n\nThe way it works today is that the man wants X kids, the woman wants Y kids,\nand by default this means you get min(X,Y) kids. If you instead got Y kids, or\navg(X,Y) kids, that would be a lot more kids. So would if people aggressively\nfiltered to ensure X=Y, but too often we don\u2019t prioritize that until very late\nin the game. And also of course if you don\u2019t have a partner, or life\ncircumstances don\u2019t allow, or biology doesn\u2019t cooperate, you can get less that\nway too.\n\n####\n\nSurrogacy\n\nYou can also go big, and have 22 children, 21 born via surrogates, with 16\nlive-in nannies.\n\nIf you are fine with people choosing to have zero kids when it is an obvious\nmistake, and you want the human race to continue to exist, well then some\npeople are going to have to have really quite a lot of kids, often in ways and\nfor reasons that do not seem ideal. I am fine with it.\n\nThe affirmative case for surrogacy is simple. Life is good. People are good.\nMore surrogacy means there are more people. Everyone involved is better off,\nmost of all the baby.\n\nThe affirmative case for essentially every way to have more children is the\nsame case. Life is good. People are good. Making those people be even better,\nis even better. The details are not so important.\n\nBeing pregnant, in many ways, sucks. It seems highly reasonable to pay money\nto avoid it, in a voluntary win-win trade. We shouldn\u2019t have a stigma about\nthis.\n\n> Amanda Askell: If I ever have kids, I want to have them via a surrogate\n> because (a) I want to use my own eggs and (b) I don't don't want to be\n> pregnant or give birth. This feels like a preference that is probably taboo\n> but shouldn't be.\n\nA fun scissor statement on the matter:\n\nTo me the answer is clear. That is part of what makes it a good scissor.\n\n####\n\nTechnology\n\nThe transformative answers are coming. Eventually.\n\n> Max Novendstern: the most underrated technology right now: the capacity to\n> generate egg cells from stem cells in arbitrary quantity + capacity to\n> select for IQ among embryos means IVF will enable the selection of children\n> with one-in-a-million IQ markers. this is not priced in.\n\nYes. When (not if, when) we gain the ability to do this, and do it\nsufficiently cheaply, not only do we remove practical age limits on fertility,\nwe can also do arbitrary amounts of embryo selection.\n\nWill a lot of people try to stop this from happening, treat it as some\nhorrible thing? Yes, of course they will. Don\u2019t let them stop it.\n\nHere is a modest proposal.\n\n> Cremieux: This is an interesting prospect. TL;DR: If you qualify, a company\n> will freeze your eggs for free, but they keep half the eggs.\n>\n> They sell them to people who need eggs to have children.\n\nNo monetary cost to you. This is a cute end run around the \u2018we are not allowed\nto pay people for things\u2019 problem.\n\nHow you think about it depends on how you think about egg donation. I am all\nfor it. If someone else wants to raise my biological children, to me that\nseems like a win for everyone involved, especially the child. I did not donate\n(sperm) \u2018when I had the chance\u2019 but I notice I am sad about that.\n\n7.4% of women who freeze their eggs go back and use them. Is that a good rate?\nIt is all about cost versus benefit, risk versus reward. The frozen eggs are\nan insurance policy and an option. The value of having a child when you could\nnot have otherwise had one is often very high. If you consider the all-in cost\nincluding storage as something like $25,000, then yes this is very much a rich\nsociety\u2019s game to be playing, but the money seems well spent.\n\n####\n\nInsular High Fertility Cultures\n\nRobin Hanson attempts to recalibrate respect towards insular high-fertility\ncultures, based on his anticipation of their future dominance. Tyler Cowen\nwould doubtless say that if respecting their practices is the goal, to stop\nwatching documentaries and to travel amongst them, the Amish are only a few\nhours away. I would agree.\n\nIt is a strange project. I hope that it can be used as an illustration of how\nto view \u2018right side of history\u2019 arguments.\n\nOften we are told that we should support that which we anticipate future\npeople supporting, so as to be on the \u2018right side of history.\u2019 This can be\nlong term reputational, so future people treat us kindly. It can be short\nterm, keeping an eye on what the winners will reward and punish. Get on the\nwinning team now, based on its arguments it will win in the future, and help\nit win now. This strategy is commonly employed throughout the political and\nsocial spectrums.\n\nCertainly one should notice what features lead to success, or have what\npositive or negative impact. And one should update accordingly in various\nways. What one should not do is automatically bow to our new insect overlords\n(or future AI overlords). We do not bow down. We definitely do not do it in\nadvance.\n\nHow much should we respect the features of these insular cultures, if we\nbelieve the future is likely to fully go the extreme way that Hanson\nanticipates? One must evaluate the features case by case, look at what work\nthey do in various ways, decide for one\u2019s self where the important work is\ndone and what is the best approach.\n\nHanson names several promising traits.\n\nThe most promising is that children and fertility begets fertility, especially\nhappy children. Children do better with lots of other children to play with\nand a world that is built around them rather than shoving them off to the\nside. And the children in such cultures, Hanson reports, typically are happier\nthan our children, despite materially having far less.\n\nI mostly buy this. Our society is very bad at giving children independence and\nresponsibility, giving them meaning and tangible things to do. Instead it is\nobsessed with the child\u2019s progression through various hoops and requirements,\nmaking their lives, and those of the parents, a constant stream of stress. We\ndo not need to do this. A radically different attitude towards children and\nraising children would go a long way. It is not obvious that this would not on\nits own, or together with modest other reforms to improve economic conditions,\nbe sufficient.\n\nWhat about the strong communal bond and lack of resentment of community\nobligations? That also seems promising. Communal bonds are great and we are\ndoing a terrible job of creating or maintaining them. This does not require an\nextreme insular culture. We need to get on this too, big time.\n\nWhat about the isolation, strong religion and restrictions on technology? They\nare necessary, under current conditions, to protect the valuable parts of the\nsocial technology from sustained attack across generations. Religion is also\n(among other things) a highly active ingredient in justifying extreme\ninvestment in community, and in tolerating a lot of quite inherently boring\ncommunity and cultural obligations.\n\nI believe this can be made to work without the extreme isolation, and with\nonly relatively sane limits on technology, under current conditions. Whether\ncurrent conditions sustain themselves under development of AI is of course\nanother matter, but if everything transforms from AI (whether or not something\ngood or better results) than questions of current fertility levels would\nbecome moot either way.\n\n####\n\nIn Brief\n\nRobin Hanson offers My Fertility Posts. He has quit a lot of them. If you want\nto explore, I recommend reading them in order of publication, as it allows you\nto follow Robin has he thinks about the problem, establishes his perspective,\nthen considers implications. It is quite a trip.\n\nBrink Lindsey considers some implications of a shrinking world.\n\nScott Alexander welcomes twins, in the most Scott Alexander way all around. A\nwonderful, heartwarming piece if you know his work well.\n\n####\n\nCultural Trends\n\nA simple summary of much of the issue:\n\n  1. We used to shame \u2018incorrectly\u2019 having children via sexuality.\n\n  2. Then we stopped shaming sexuality. Which is good.\n\n  3. Also we used to shame not having children. Then we stopped doing that.\n\n  4. Which, again, is good, if you find other ways to still ensure there are children.\n\n  5. Except then we started shaming \u2018incorrectly\u2019 having children directly.\n\n  6. We have also continuously raised the bar on what counts as \u2018incorrect.\u2019\n\n  7. And we don\u2019t much praise those who have children.\n\n  8. All of which is bad.\n\n  9. And means not enough kids.\n\n  10. Especially when kids make it hard to otherwise maintain social status.\n\nWe used to shame people too hard over too many and the wrong things. It is\ngood that we do less of that, although in some cases (such as some forms of\nliteral crime) we have clearly taken this too far. The problem is that the\nshaming we used to do mostly did have an underlying societal purpose.\n\nAnd rather than everyone realizing shaming is bad and not to do it at all, we\nhave substituted other forms of shaming and other social pressures.\n\nThe pro-social shaming, and pro-social judgments and status rewards, have been\nsubject to unilateral disarmament. We took the pro-social versions down,\nletting the socially neutral and actively anti-social shaming and judgments\nrun rampant in their place. At minimum, if we want to fix this, we will need\nto orient positive social status to those who do the things we want people to\ndo more often, such as having children.\n\nWe could of course also throw money at the problem. And we should do that as\nwell. But it will be a lot cheaper if we do both.\n\nCultural trends are about cultural trends.\n\n> Bryan Caplan: Conformity drives a lot of fertility behavior. The main driver\n> of the Baby Boom really was, \u201cEveryone else is having big families; we\n> should, too.\u201d\n>\n> Which ironically means that publicizing Baby Busts probably makes them\n> worse. See South Korea!\n\nThis should worry us when considering small interventions on the margin. But\nit should give us hope around large interventions, or interventions with broad\ncultural impact, and helps explain the many very large historical swings in\nfertility.\n\nCousins are vanishing as the birth rate declines, I would presume in practice\neven mores than the numbers would suggest, as our families become more\ndisconnected. Cousins (and nieces and nephews) are a clear example of a\npositive externality that is not properly priced into people\u2019s decisions.\nCousins make us less alone, provide social support and connections and\noptionality. They do this at vey low cost, if a cousin is not relevant to your\ninterests you can mostly ignore them.\n\nWe used to use various forms of social pressure to get people to do socially\noptimal things more often, now we do much less of that, and we have no plan to\nreplace the effect.\n\nIf you don\u2019t respect parents, people will be reluctant to become one.\n\n> Felicia Day: When someone at a function I don\u2019t want to talk to comes up at\n> me, I say I\u2019ve decided to focus on being a parent for a while. They\n> literally can\u2019t leave fast enough.\n\nThis raises an obvious dilemma. If Felicia Day said that to me, do I take it\nas a sign she wants to leave me alone? Or do we get to happily geek out about\nkids? Because I would happily geek out with Felicia Day about kids, with or\nwithout also geeking out about lots of other things. DM me anytime.\n\nRobin Hanson asks, what trends need to reverse to help fix fertility declines?\n\n> Robin Hanson: The following 8 social trends plausibly contribute to falling\n> fertility:\n>\n> More gender equality - More equal gender norms, options, & expectations,\n> have contributed to fewer women having kids.\n>\n> Higher parenting effort - Expectations for how much attention and effort\n> parents give each kid have risen.\n>\n> Long stiff career paths - The path of school & early career prep til one is\n> established worker is longer & less flexible.\n>\n> Cap- vs cornerstone marry - Now marrying/kids wait until we fully formed,\n> career established, then find matching mate.\n>\n> Grandparent less involved - Parents once helped kids choose mates, & helped\n> them raise kids. Now kids more on own.\n>\n> More urban less rural - People now love in denser urban areas where housing\n> costs more, kids have less space.\n>\n> Less fundamental religion - Religion once clearly promoted fertility, but we\n> less religious, especially re fundamentalism.\n>\n> Integrated world culture - We pay less attention to local, and more to\n> global, community comparisons and norms.\n\nHere was the combined effect. I think this underrates high parenting effort\nand the influence of religion, but I can see a good case for career paths,\ncornerstones and grandparents as well. I am inclined to consider cornerstone\nmore of a consequence or symptom than a direct cause, but this is not clear.\n\nThe \u2018big four\u2019 here are all rising costs. Higher effort required from you and\nless outside effort mean the direct costs are higher. Cornerstone approaches\nand stiff career paths raise opportunity costs.\n\nAs discussed under South Korea, gender equality is tricky here. If you get rid\nof other traditional values and norms around children and families, then more\ngender equality probably becomes actively good for fertility. The logic is\nsimple: Once you give women the choice on how many children they have,\notherwise treating them badly and giving them less opportunity is going to\ncause them to choose to have less children rather than more children. The way\nthat older gender inequality promoted fertility was that it took that choice\naway from women. I hope we can all agree that giving them that choice was a\ngood change.\n\nRelated and gated: China\u2019s Female Revolt, how sexist violence killed the\nChinese dream.\n\nIn some ways we return to tradition, but you might be wrong about what\ntradition is.\n\n> Jamie: My grandmother who was born in 1930 wants you all to know that there\n> is no Return to Tradition. They constantly had kids out of wedlock, they\n> just hid them. She said I should tweet that.\n\nConstantly is a relative term. It is highly plausible, and I would think\nlikely, that there are two equilibria, neither of which involves getting rid\nof out of wedlock births.\n\n  1. Maintaining norms against out of wedlock births, and minimizing how many there are, necessarily involves a lot of people choosing to hide out of wedlock births in various ways, but also a lot less such births overall.\n\n  2. Not maintaining those norms means you do not have to do that, but you get a lot more such births as a fraction of births.\n\nSimilar rules hold for many other behaviors, including much criminal activity.\nWe have moved a lot of things recently from the first category to the second\ncategory. The hypocrisy and local misery and cruelty inherent in option one\nhas not survived our greater awareness. Alas, often the second option is\nactually worse as an equilibrium.\n\nOne can also see this as a market failure. There is a wide range of behaviors\nthat imposes externalities on society as a whole, that we want to happen less\noften, but which it is impossible to entirely eradicate. Our strategy used to\nbe to punish such activities to reduce their frequency, even though this is\nlocally destructive and resulted in worse local outcomes, and people paid\ncosts to not get caught. This was not an ideal solution, but it was often\nstill net positive when compared with the original market failure, and\nincreasingly we are cutting down Chesterton\u2019s Fence.\n\nDINKs (double income, no kids) bragging about how they get to go on vacations\nand order both appetizers and desert and other neat stuff like that. I like to\nthink you can see the hints desperation below the surface as they attempt to\njustify how they made good life choices, but not everyone is that self-aware.\n\n> Andrew Domalewski: every dual income no kids couple I know who isn't having\n> kids \"because of climate change\" constantly posts photos of their vacations\n> around the world...\n\nAgain, we have a similar dilemma. If you are going to be DINKs either way, I\ndo not want you to be unhappy, please do go around subsidizing the local\nrestaurants and taking vacations and such and have a blast. However, the world\nwhere such people experience a bunch of existential angst and find the whole\nthing turning to ash in their mouths after a while is in the long run a better\nworld.\n\nCultural trends can change. Here is one particular potential future trend\nmaker:\n\n> Bryan Hobart: Feeling faintly annoyed that 1) someone is going to get\n> management fees for a \u201cbaby boom\u201d ETF that\u2019s prepped to launch as soon as\n> Taylor Swift announces she\u2019s pregnant, and 2) I will probably not get around\n> to buying Bright Horizons or Carter\u2019s in advance of this.\n>\n> What other public companies are most levered to birth rate?\n\nWhat percentage of people see family and children as a major source of\nmeaning?\n\nThe numbers peak at 30-49, when people are raising kids. Sadly, the number\nfalls away a lot for 65+, when one would hope that family and kids (and\ngrandkids) would be a major source of meaning in one\u2019s retirement. America\nseems to be doing a relatively strong job of not letting this fall off (and in\nTaiwan it actually goes up, but from an extremely low point). In Sweden it\nfalls off a cliff. Perhaps this is variance. If not I would like to better\nunderstand the causes.\n\nThis is a two-way problem. We need people to find meaning in family, because\npeople need meaning, and because it causes them to have and invest in families\nand children, which in turn will provide many things we need including more\nmeaning.\n\nWe also don\u2019t have many fans of romance in terms of meaning, I am very\nsurprised this is so low.\n\n> Alice Evans: Only 1% of Taiwanese emphasized romance. This tracks. I went to\n> one mall and one supermarket today, there are no valentines. But there are\n> thousands of celebrations of money.\n\nIn a more general alarm category, all the numbers here are scary but also what\nthe hell is going on in East Asia? They also don\u2019t value friends and\ncommunity, religion (the USA has 15% here, no one else is over 5%), work,\nhobbies or civic engagement. Looks like they simply lack almost all meaning.\n\nI am sad we did not get China onto these charts, very curious where they would\nland.\n\nAmericans across the board say that having a job or career you enjoy, or\nhaving close friends, is far more important than having children or being\nmarried.\n\nI believe that Americans and similar people throughout the world are very,\nvery wrong about this. Even on a pure happiness level, this is not what causes\nlong term happiness. Ask your grandparents. In any case, this is obviously a\nhuge part of the fertility problem.\n\nIt is actually rather stunning that the fertility problem is not vastly worse?\nIf only 26% of people think having children is very important specifically to\na \u2018fulfilling\u2019 life, you would think that would be vastly worse.\n\nThread pointing out that the trends around fertility are prone to frequent\nchange. Female education or labor force participation, or family income, is a\npositive correlation with fertility one decade or century, then negative in\nanother. There is no reason trends could not reverse themselves.\n\nAt minimum, what could we do about all this? Well, we could start by not\nletting the organization funded by literal Paul Ehrlich into our schools to\nshow millions of our kids propaganda on how horrible it would be to have\nchildren of their own.\n\nPaper says that India\u2019s son preference is focused on desire to have at least\none son, who can perform eldest son duties. That is enough for a large\nimbalance, and reduced family size is making this effect much larger. The\npaper doesn\u2019t point to solutions. It considers cash transfers, but worries\nthis would concentrate girls among poorer families. Which it clearly would,\nbut you do get overall balance, matches still have to even out, and I don\u2019t\nsee a better alternative.\n\nAria Babu looks at correlations to ask what beliefs kill birth rates. Most\nthings she looked at had little or no effect. The biggest effect was the\npercentage who agreed that \u2018if the mother works, a preschool child is likely\nto suffer.\u2019 Even then, the trend is not super strong, with a correlational\neffect size of 0.25 births per woman for no one versus everyone believing it,\nprobably not entirely causal. Mostly this tells us that there is no one easy\nanswer.\n\nRachel Cohen writes in Vox about motherhood dread. She paints a story where\nmany moms are happy with their lives, or have egalitarian home arrangements,\nbut they are afraid to tell anyone, whereas those who are dissatisfied\ncomplain loudly and proudly. It is okay to not be okay with motherhood, and\nnot okay to be okay with it. So every woman gets filled with dread about the\nwhole thing. Even if the underlying facts are happy, they have to feign\nunhappiness, which itself sucks. And of course, the financial and health\nburdens are immense. We used to sugar coat them, now we do the opposite. There\nis also complaining about inegalitarian gender norms at home, but even under\ntheoretically ideal conditions that could only solve half of the problem.\n\nMostly it\u2019s a lot of complaining, although with an attempted positive\nattitude, about the fact that everyone is constantly and exclusively\ncomplaining, whereas a positive attitude could go a long way. It makes clear\nthat both the cultural and financial incentives are stacked against being a\nmother, both of which we will have to work to reverse. And more fundamentally,\nthat we have let dread at the burdens of motherhood run rampant, while we work\nto suppress dread about growing old without children, dying lonely and leaving\nnothing as a legacy.\n\n### Subscribe to Don't Worry About the Vase\n\nBy Zvi Mowshowitz \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nA world made of gears.
