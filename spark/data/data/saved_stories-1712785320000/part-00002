We watched a Little Mermaid become a part of our\nworld once more. We saw Spider-Man swing into new dimensions; witnessed\nanother Scorsese masterpiece; and accepted another impossible mission.\n\nWe met an up-and-coming Willy Wonka, followed the latest chapters for the Fast\nfamily, and wondered whether fire and water could mix in Elemental.\n\nAnd if anyone doubts the blockbuster role cinema plays in igniting our\nimaginations, fueling our economy, or shaping our public discourse, I have one\nword for you \u2013 a word that I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll hear many times this week:\nBarbenheimer.\n\nBut make no mistake: people everywhere want to see great stories come alive on\nthe big screen. In fact, in 2023, box office was up 20 percent from the\nprevious year in the U.S. and Canada, and nearly 30 percent abroad.\n\nEven with that steady recovery, we can\u2019t shy away from the stark challenges of\nthis moment. Nor can we ignore this time of volatility in our industry.\n\nYet none of us should fear that uncertainty. After all, we work in a business\nwhere unexpected twists can make for an epic story where the unpredictable can\nbreed renewed bursts of creativity.\n\nWe understand the stakes. We recognize the need to do everything possible to\nensure the enduring health of cinema.\n\nAnd we know that the only way to reach our common goals is by working together\n\u2013 the creative minds who develop the films, the studios who produce them, the\nunion workers who make them, and the theaters who share them with the world.\n\nAs a partner in that cause, the MPA focuses on two pillars: Protecting content\nand the people who produce it. And by doing so, ensuring the creative forces\nof this industry can reach even bigger audiences worldwide.\n\nTo make that happen, we need to keep doing what we do best: telling a\ncompelling story.\n\nFor us at the MPA, it\u2019s a story about the impact of filmmaking, why it\nmatters, how it grows economies and unites people. And the audiences for our\nmessage tend to be drawn from the ranks of government, business, and more.\n\nWhen I head to Capitol Hill in DC or State Capitols throughout the country,\nfor example, I paint a picture of the ways our productions bolster\ncommunities: how film and television support 2.74 million American jobs; how\nproduction comprises 122,000 businesses; and how our incredible industry\nboasts a trade surplus with nearly every nation on earth.\n\nAnd when I meet with heads of state and leaders in foreign capitals, I set the\nscene for the kinds of policies that open doors for global production. That\npreserve the rule of law. That give casts and crews greater freedom to build,\nwrite, act, direct, design, edit, and produce our amazing stories.\n\nToday, our job involves another plotline countering a central threat to the\nsecurity of workers, audiences, and the economy at large: Widespread, digital\npiracy.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve talked about piracy here before. This problem isn\u2019t new. But piracy\noperations have only grown more nimble, more advanced, and more elusive.\n\nThese enterprises are engaged in insidious forms of theft, breaking laws each\ntime they steal and share protected content.\n\nThese activities are nefarious by any definition, detrimental to our industry\nby any standard, and dangerous for the rights of creators and consumers by any\nmeasure.\n\nRemember \u2013 these aren\u2019t teenagers playing an elaborate prank.\n\nThe perpetrators are real-life mobsters ... organized crime syndicates \u2013 many\nof whom engage in child pornography, prostitution, drug trafficking, and other\nsocietal ills.\n\nThey operate websites that draw in millions of unsuspecting viewers whose\npersonal data can then fall prey to malware and hackers.\n\nIn short, piracy is clearly not a victimless crime.\n\nAcross the globe, it undermines everyone who works in production \u2013 actors,\ndirectors, writers, carpenters, craftspeople, and more.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, it steals hundreds of thousands of jobs from workers and\ntens of billions of dollars from our economy, including more than one billion\nin theatrical ticket sales.\n\nLet me repeat that last point: in an average year, online piracy costs your\ntheaters more than one billion dollars at the box office.\n\nWe each have a vested interest in defeating this menace. And meeting this\nchallenge is one of the MPA\u2019s core priorities.\n\nTwo years ago, at CinemaCon, I told you about key tools in this battle.\n\nFirst was our Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment, or ACE as we call it,\nwhich has grown substantially since then and now has nearly 60 members\nthroughout the world \u2013 all collaborating with local law enforcement\nauthorities and global cybersecurity experts to identify and investigate\nillegal piracy operations.\n\nSecond was our Trusted Partner Network, or TPN, which now features almost\n1,000 partners \u2013 all working to secure content along every step of the journey\nfrom script to screen.\n\nThese initiatives are vital \u2013 and very effective.\n\nBut this danger continues to evolve \u2013 and so must our strategy to defeat it.\n\nSo today, here with you at CinemaCon, I\u2019m announcing the next major phase of\nthis effort: the MPA is going to work with Members of Congress to enact\njudicial site-blocking legislation here in the United States.\n\nFor anybody unfamiliar with the term, site-blocking is a targeted, legal\ntactic to disrupt the connection between digital pirates and their intended\naudience.\n\nIt allows all types of creative industries \u2013 film and television, music and\nbook publishers, sports leagues and broadcasters \u2013 to request, in court, that\ninternet service providers block access to websites dedicated to sharing\nillegal, stolen content.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: this approach focuses only on sites featuring stolen\nmaterials. There are no gray areas here.\n\nSite-blocking does not impact legitimate businesses or ordinary internet\nusers. To the contrary: it protects them, too.\n\nAnd it does so within the bounds of due process, requiring detailed evidence\nestablishing a target\u2019s illegal activities and allowing alleged perpetrators\nto appear in a court of law.\n\nThis is not an untested concept.\n\nSite-blocking is a common tool in almost 60 countries, including leading\ndemocracies and many of America\u2019s closest allies.\n\nWhat key player is missing from that roster?\n\nTake a look at the map behind me. It\u2019s us!\n\nThere\u2019s no good reason for our glaring absence. No reason beyond a lack of\npolitical will, paired with outdated understandings of what site-blocking\nactually is, how it functions, and who it affects.\n\nYet experiences worldwide have now answered these concerns and taught us\nunmistakable lessons:\n\nSite-blocking works.\n\nIt dramatically reduces traffic on piracy sites.\n\nIt substantially increases visits to legal sites.\n\nSimply put, this is a powerful tool to defend what our filmmakers create and\nwhat reaches your theaters.\n\nConsider one example of what this step could mean on our shores:\n\nOne of the largest illegal streaming sites in the world, FMovies, sees over\n160 million visits per month and because other nations already passed site\nblocking legislation, a third of that traffic still comes from the United\nStates.\n\nThat amounts to millions of Americans watching content that has been stolen\nand shared by digital pirates \u2013 content that was designed and developed for\nthe big screen.\n\nImagine if those viewers couldn\u2019t find pirated versions of films through a\nbasic internet search. Imagine if they could only watch the latest great\nmovies when they\u2019re released in their intended destinations: your theaters.\n\nIf we had site-blocking in place, we wouldn\u2019t have to imagine it. We\u2019d have\nanother tool to make that real.\n\nNow, I know what some in this room might be thinking: didn\u2019t we have this\ndebate in Congress already not too long ago?\n\nIf you\u2019re too young to remember, this story reached its previous climax in\n2012 \u2013 five years before I joined the MPA.\n\nBack then, we heard claims that site-blocking would \u201cbreak the internet.\u201d\nWell, I\u2019m not sure if anyone\u2019s noticed, but even after site-blocking became\ncommonplace around the world, the internet is doing just fine.\n\nBack then, we heard concerns about the potential use of site-blocking to\nstifle free speech. Well, that\u2019s something we take seriously in an industry\nthat embraces an unflinching commitment to the First Amendment.\n\nBut again, real-world experience proved those dire predictions wrong. Examples\nof free speech violations are practically non-existent. Safeguards exist to\nensure the protection of everyone\u2019s legal rights.\n\nWe can get this done \u2013 and do it right.\n\nAnd even if Members of Congress can\u2019t seem to agree on much these days, surely\nthey can find common ground on action to protect American businesses, defend\nAmerican workers, and strengthen our public safety.\n\nIt\u2019s long past time to bring our laws in line with the rest of the world.\n\nThe MPA is leading this charge in Washington. And we need the voices of\ntheater owners \u2013 your voices \u2013 right by our side. Because this action will be\ngood for all of us: Content creators. Theaters. Our workforce. Our country.\n\nIt will help us meet our core charge as representatives of an iconic industry\n\u2013 protecting everyone who brings films to life. Empowering our creative\ngeniuses. Ensuring they can take concepts from imagination, to idea, to your\ntheaters \u2013 and leave a lasting imprint on audiences everywhere.\n\nJust last month, upon accepting the Academy Award for Best Documentary\nFeature, Mstyslav Chernov, the Ukrainian director of 20 Days in Mariupol,\nreminded us of the power and impact of what we do:\n\n\u201cCinema forms memories,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd memories form history.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a man whose nation is beset by war and devastation. And he decided to\ntell that story, to etch his people\u2019s memories into history, through film.\n\nThat speaks to our ultimate purpose \u2013 Michael O\u2019Leary and NATO, the MPA and\ntheater owners, studios and the creative community:\n\nForging memories.\n\nMaking history.\n\nShining a light on remarkable stories.\n\nDeploying the unifying experience of seeing a film \u2013 on the big screen; on a\ngiant canvas; side-by-side; together \u2013 to enthrall and educate, to motivate\nand inspire.\n\nBecause it\u2019s in that experience that we find the true magic of movies.\n\nThank you.\n\n## Sign Up For Updates\n\nTo stay up to date with the Motion Picture Association, please sign up for our\nnewsletter.\n\n\u00a92024\n\nMotion Picture Association, Inc.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\n## Quick links\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Career Opportunities with MPA\n  * Press Kit\n  * Below the Line\n  * Where to Watch\n  * The Dangers of Online Piracy\n\n## Related Sites\n\n  * filmratings.com\n  * CARAfilmratings.com\n  * Alliance4Creativity.com\n  * Trusted Partner Network\n\nInternational Sites\n\n## Follow MPA\n\n## Privacy\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * California Consumer Privacy Statement\n  * CA: Don\u2019t Sell My Info\n  * Cookie Notice\n  * Cookie Settings\n\nIf you are a California resident, California law may consider certain\ndisclosures of data a \u201csale\u201d of your personal information (such as cookies\nthat help Motion Picture Association later serve you ads, like we discuss in\nour Privacy Policy here), and may give you the right to opt out.
