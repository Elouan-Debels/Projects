Discovery\u2019s Max and its hit TV series Tokyo Vice.\n\nThe neo-noir crime drama was then two-thirds of the way through production of\nits second season on location in Japan, and one of its most ambitious shoots\nwas planned for that night. The production was set to take over a full block\nof Akasaka\u2019s Esplanade, an old nightlife strip famous for the hundreds of bars\nand hostess clubs that are packed into its narrow mid-rise buildings. No\nJapanese TV production \u2014 let alone a foreign, Western one \u2014 had ever been\ngranted police permission to shoot in Akasaka, which is near many of Tokyo\u2019s\nmost important cultural and political sites. The likelihood of getting\napproval to set up there had once seemed so improbable that Tokyo Vice\u2018s\nproducers now viewed the night\u2019s planned shoot as nothing less than a\nculmination of all the progress they had made in getting unprecedented access\nto Tokyo\u2019s real-life, neon-lit underbelly. Aikawa and his team had somehow\ndelivered the impossible; they had won the official nod \u2014 but for most of the\nday, the forecast was calling for heavy rain.\n\n### Related Stories\n\nMovies\n\n### Cannes Film Festival Launches Immersive Competition Section\n\nGeneral News\n\n### 'Shogun' Star Tadanobu Asano on Creating Fan-Favorite Samurai Yabushige\n\n\u201cIf we had been rained out, I think I might have cried,\u201d Aikawa later told me\nthrough an interpreter, without any indication that he was joking.\n\nWhen I first arrived in Akasaka to visit the Tokyo Vice set, I had little\nsense of just how much was at stake that night. As on any TV production,\nactivity was underway everywhere. Clusters of Tokyo Vice\u2018s Japanese\ncrewmembers were prepping to rope off sections of the street, and various\ndepartment heads were huddled with their teams in small, closed restaurants\nthat Fifth Season, the show\u2019s lead production company, had rented out as\nworkspaces (Tokyo\u2019s streets are far too narrow to accommodate Hollywood-style\nproduction trailers). The night\u2019s shoot would create the streetside aftermath\nof one of season two\u2019s most explosive moments: a graphic shootout inside a\nhostess club that claims the life of a key character. Period ambulances,\npolice cars and dozens of extras were standing by to move into position in\nfront of the fictional building\u2019s facade, creating a scrum of onlookers and\nfirst responders. Tokyo Vice\u2018s stars, Ansel Elgort and Ken Watanabe, would\nthen meet amidst the mayhem to frantically discuss what has just transpired.\nCrucially, they would be doing so on the real streets of Akasaka, with the\nnightlife area\u2019s glowing signage and inimitable atmosphere hanging all around\nthem \u2014 not on a heavily dressed soundstage in Los Angeles or Toronto.\n\nAnsel Elgort on location in Tokyo\u2019s Akasaka District.\n\n\u201cThere was never a question about whether we were going to shoot Tokyo Vice\nentirely in Japan,\u201d says Sarah Aubrey, Max\u2019s head of original content. \u201cThis\nwasn\u2019t going to be a story set in the American embassy with a few excursions\nout into the rest of Tokyo. It\u2019s an immersion into Japanese culture through\nthat city\u2019s crime world \u2014 and that was the main selling point for me and the\nnetwork.\u201d\n\nLoosely based on a memoir written by journalist Jake Adelstein, Tokyo Vice\nfamously tells the story of a Japanese-fluent American writer (Elgort) who\nworks his way into covering crime for one of Tokyo\u2019s largest newspapers. In\nthe process, he forges an unlikely bond with a dogged local police detective\n(Watanabe), with the duo sharing information and working together to untangle\nsordid yakuza activities. The mixed-language show has impressed critics by\ngoing to uncommon lengths to illuminate the inner worlds and attendant\nsubcultures of its many prominent Japanese characters \u2014 far beyond their ties\nto the story\u2019s Caucasian interloper. Arguably, the series\u2019 freshest character,\nthough, is Tokyo itself.\n\nSays Aubrey: \u201cAudiences have already seen so much on television \u2014 we\u2019ve all\nhad seven or eight years of Peak TV \u2014 so the bar keeps rising for how you\nbring fresh storytelling to people. We knew that if we could go deeper and\ndeeper into the real Tokyo, we would be able to deliver just that.\u201d\n\nBut Tokyo\u2019s underexposed appeal as a setting derives precisely from the fact\nthat it has long had a reputation among production veterans as the world\u2019s\nmost challenging major metropolis to capture on camera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve shot almost everywhere in the world, and in most places, the scenery and\nthe languages change, but you can operate in more or less the same way,\u201d says\nTodd Sharp, president of production at Fifth Season. \u201cBut Japan is a totally\ndifferent world in terms of how the film industry works and how the local\npopulation feels about it.\u201d\n\nWhether in Paris, Sydney, Budapest or Seoul, any international TV series with\nsimilar ambitions to shoot on location would first approach the host country\u2019s\nlocal film commission, which would provide information on tax incentives and\nassist with streamlined approval processes for desirable shooting areas. Next,\nthe show\u2019s location team would approach local businesses with legal paperwork\nand compensate them for the temporary use of their space. Most often, the\nparties involved are simply excited to have a movie or TV show shooting in\ntheir neighborhood. When there are holdouts, the project just increases the\ncompensation offer. Money, inevitably, talks.\n\nJapan has only recently introduced a very modest incentive scheme, and local\nofficialdom historically has viewed foreign productions warily at best. The\ncapacities of film commissions in the country are also conspicuously limited.\nAnd for local business owners, getting paid well for the use of their space is\nfar from their first and only concern.\n\nAlan Poul was the executive producer on Tokyo Vice best equipped to navigate\nthe cultural challenges the show would inevitably face on the ground in Japan.\nToday, Poul is both an esteemed TV producer (Tales of the City, My So-Called\nLife, Six Feet Under) and an accomplished director (Big Love, Swingtown, The\nNewsroom), but he began his career on a soundstage in the 1980s on the west\nside of Tokyo. After graduating from Yale with a degree in Japanese language\nand literature, he was recruited by maverick writer-director Paul Schrader\n(Taxi Driver, Light Sleeper) to serve as an associate producer on Mishima: A\nLife in Four Chapters (1985) \u2014 the filmmaker\u2019s now cult-classic biopic about\nthe iconoclastic Japanese author Yukio Mishima, which was filmed with an all-\nJapanese cast and crew at Tokyo\u2019s Toho Studios. From there, Poul was hired as\nassociate producer on Ridley Scott\u2019s Japan-set Yakuza crime film Black Rain\n(1989), a project that was commercially and critically successful in its day\nbut which encountered such notorious difficulties and local blowback during\nproduction that it was effectively kicked out of Japan before shooting had\nfully wrapped. For decades, industry chatter about Black Rain\u2018s challenges\ndissuaded some studio projects from even considering working in the country.\n\n\u201cEverything in this country is local, and everything runs on precedent,\u201d\nexplains Poul, who also directs several of Tokyo Vice\u2018s episodes. \u201cWith\nanywhere you want to shoot in Tokyo, the decision comes down to the local\npolice station in that neighborhood. And if no one has shot there before,\ntheir instinct is always to say no. They operate by considering the worst-case\nscenario and the fact that responsibility will fall on them if anything goes\nwrong.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe only way to work here is to assuage every concern, and\ndemonstrate extreme conscientiousness at all times \u2014 and let\u2019s be honest,\nthat\u2019s not how everyone in this industry tends to behave.\u201d\n\nJ.T. Rogers, Tokyo Vice\u2018s creator, came to the project as an accomplished,\nTony-winning playwright (Oslo), but also as a \u201cusefully naive\u201d first-time\nshowrunner, as he puts it.\n\n\u201cI wrote the whole show without realizing how difficult any of this would be\nto shoot in Tokyo,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd this being Japan and such a polite\nsociety, when I got here, nobody came up to me from the position of, \u2018Are you\nfucking crazy? How do you think you can make this here?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course, I soon realized it was unbelievably difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in a\nway, I think the show lucked out, because I came at it from a naive place of\nsimply writing the show as I imagined it, rather than trying to cut corners in\nadvance \u2014 so we had no option but to try to be very bold with what we\nattempted.\u201d\n\nPoul, however, knew better from the beginning. \u201cWhen I told the studio how\nlong we would need to prep, at first they thought that I was joking,\u201d he\nremembers. \u201cBecause in most countries that have a film culture, if you go in\ntwo months in advance, you can pull almost anything together. In Japan, it\u2019s\nsix months.\u201d\n\nTokyo Vice creator J.T. Rogers and executive producer/director Alan Poul\nbehind the scenes in Tokyo.\n\nFor any given night of shooting in Tokyo, Aikawa\u2019s locations team could count\nas many as 20 staff members \u2014 well over double what would be required in any\nother city. The extreme effort his team expended to secure the Akasaka shoot\nwas exemplary of the challenges of working in Japan \u2014 as was his dismay over\nthe possibility of a rainout. According to Aikawa, no Japanese TV series or\nfilm had ever shot in Akasaka, mostly because the country\u2019s smaller-budget\nproductions would never be willing to expend the enormous time and resources\nrequired.\n\n\u201cWhen we first talked to the police about six months ago, they told us they\nwould consider our proposal only after we had gotten permission to shoot from\nevery single business in the area,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m sure they said this\nassuming it would make us just give up.\u201d\n\nInstead, the crew systematically fanned out and went about the usual\nrequirements for securing a location in Japan \u2014 in this case, individually\napproaching over 300 bars and shops within visibility of the building in\nAkasaka that they wanted to film.\n\n\u201cThe location process here, like everything else, is incredibly labor\nintensive,\u201d explains Poul. \u201cIt involves taking a small gift \u2014 a box of sweets\nor rice crackers \u2014 to every shop owner and sitting down with them to cultivate\na relationship. Their primary concern is going to be that the shoot will not\ndisturb their neighbors and regular customers, because your relationship with\nthose around you is sacrosanct in Japan.\u201d\n\nThese civic-minded cultural imperatives are part of what makes Japan such a\n\u201chighly functional and pleasant\u201d place, Poul says \u2014 but they also make the\ninescapably intrusive exercise of location filmmaking profoundly challenging.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t give [the shop owner] a strong sense of assurance that you\u2019re\ngoing to be thinking on their behalf, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you\noffer as a location fee,\u201d Poul adds.\n\nThe relationship between the production and the individual vendors also\nrequires uncommon care and continuity.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the cops or the person who owns the store, they will only want\nto deal with one person,\u201d Poul explains. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why our locations\nteam here is so much bigger than it would be in the U.S. Each location is\nassigned one person, who remains their contact. You can\u2019t have someone show up\nand say, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Suzy, I\u2019m you\u2019re new location manager today.\u2019 That will not\nfly and you\u2019ll be starting over.\u201d\n\nOver many months, countless visits and courtesy gifts dispersed by the van-\nful, Aikawa\u2019s team eventually won the blessing to shoot on Akasaka Esplanade\nfrom all 300-plus local establishments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 20 years, and this is the first time I\u2019ve ever\nbeen involved in a show that went this far,\u201d Aikawa says. \u201cWe did so much that\nI think the police eventually felt bad for us, and that\u2019s why they said yes.\nWe were very lucky that the people who happened to be in charge were able to\nfeel our passion and became sympathetic to what we were trying to do.\u201d\n\nStill, the official greenlight didn\u2019t come until just one week before the\nnight shoot was scheduled. And even though the heavy rain that was forecast\nfor that night ultimately didn\u2019t fall, if it had, Aikawa and his team would\nhave had no choice but to return to square one.\n\n\u201cWe would have had to go back to every shop to apologize and ask if we could\nreschedule, and then we would have had to negotiate with the police all over\nagain,\u201d he says, wincing just at the thought of it.\n\nTokyo Vice\u2018s locations crew also had to consider local issues that were\nsurprisingly apposite to the crime show\u2019s themes.\n\nHistorically, Japan\u2019s yakuza were deeply intertwined with the country\u2019s\nentertainment industry, which traces its roots to the live clubs and cabarets\nonce ruled exclusively by the underworld. For decades, Japanese film and TV\nproductions always sent a location manager to the nearest yakuza office\nwhenever they planned to shoot on location \u2014 usually with a nice bottle of\nsak\u00e9 in hand \u2014 to ask for protection and permission to operate within the\ngang\u2019s territory. But beginning in the 2010s, Japanese prefectures (akin to\nstates) began passing \u201cYakuza exclusion ordinances\u201d that banned paying tribute\nmoney or doing business with the gangs.\n\nTokyo Vice famously hired several former Japanese police detectives who worked\nthe yakuza beat during the 1990s to serve as cultural advisers to the show \u2014\npart of Poul\u2019s many efforts to maintain the utmost authenticity for the\nJapanese audience. The ex-cops, who now work as private detectives, helped\nRogers and the show\u2019s other writers and directors maintain accuracy in their\nportrayal of both Japanese police behavior and the yakuza\u2019s highly ritualized\ncustoms and nomenclature.\n\nThe ex-cops also provided research to the locations department by\ninvestigating the addresses of yakuza offices in the neighborhoods where Tokyo\nVice planned to shoot, so Aikawa and his team could avoid accidentally\napproaching them for locations buyouts and breaking the law. The old cops\u2019\npresence also reassured some in the crew that if any yakuza members were to\nattempt to disrupt the production, experienced hands were on set to deal with\nwhatever might arise (on the night I was there in Akasaka, Aikawa told me he\nhad noticed a conspicuous, slickly dressed character lurking around the\nperimeter of the production whom he assumed was a low-level yakuza dropping by\nto survey the scene).\n\nThe complexity and patience required to work within the system in Japan has\nmeant that most Hollywood productions set in country have simply broken the\nrules.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that we can set a positive precedent for the future,\u201d Alex Boden\n(SENSE8, Terence Malick\u2019s upcoming The Way of the Wind), one of Tokyo Vice\u2018s\nproducers, told me on the sidelines of the night shoot. \u201cBecause what most\nproductions have done is shot guerilla-style \u2014 often with fantastic artistic\nresults, but the reputation and relationships they left behind were damaged.\u201d\n\nNearly all Tokyo-set stories that film buffs will remember \u2014 such as Sofia\nCoppola\u2019s Lost in Translation, or the Japan storyline of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s Babel \u2014 were either mostly or entirely shot without legal\npermission whenever the camera ventured onto the city\u2019s streets. Other major\nseries and movies telling Japanese stories have simply attempted to re-create\nthe country elsewhere, with decidedly mixed results. Martin Scorsese\u2019s Silence\nshot in Taiwan; Disney\u2019s hit period series Shogun was filmed in and around\nVancouver; Brad Pitt\u2019s Bullet Train was set up on soundstages in Los Angeles;\nJohnny Depp\u2019s Minamata was lensed in Eastern Europe. The list goes on.\n\nBut Tokyo Vice\u2018s ambition to tell a story embedded in the city over several\nseasons precluded any temptation to flout the rules.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were here for six months on season one, and we wanted to come back\nfor a second season, so we just couldn\u2019t afford to jeopardize our\nrelationships in that way,\u201d Boden says. \u201cThere was no other option than to do\nit properly from the start.\u201d\n\nThe length of the production\u2019s commitment to Japan has also yielded benefits.\nAs anyone with significant time or business experience in Japan will tell you,\ncultivating trust in the country takes time, but it can be powerful once\nestablished.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in to make season one, we were these gaijin [the Japanese word\nfor foreigner] making a show \u2014 and the reputation for how gaijin behaved when\nthey filmed in Japan was not great,\u201d Poul recalls. \u201cPlus, we were shooting a\nstory about the yakuza \u2014 a pretty taboo topic \u2014 based on a book that was so\ncontroversial that it was never published here. So we had so many strokes\nagainst us and nobody wanted to deal with us.\u201d\n\nTokyo Vice\u2018s producers knew they could build on everything they had learned if\nthe network were to greenlight a second season.\n\n\u201cAlthough everybody loves how Tokyo looked in season one, I felt we didn\u2019t see\nenough,\u201d remembers Poul. \u201cWhen I watched it, I would think, \u2018Oh my God,\nthere\u2019s just so much of people sitting in rooms.\u2019 I wanted to get into the\nstreets even more.\u201d\n\nSays Sharp, First Season\u2019s production head: \u201cIn terms of the kinds of\nlocations we sought out and the things we tried to shoot in the city, we\nabsolutely made a significantly more ambitious show in season two.\u201d\n\nSharp estimates that about 70 percent of season two of Tokyo Vice was shot on\nlocation in Japan, compared to 50 percent for season one.\n\n\u201cWhat really enabled that to happen,\u201d adds Poul, \u201cwas the fact that the show\naired in Japan and we became a known commodity \u2014 and the word of mouth was\nthat the show was highly regarded because we had gotten the cultural\nauthenticity right. That turned us from being pariahs into being VIPs.\u201d\n\nWhen the Tokyo Vice team returned to Japan to shoot season two, Poul, Rogers\nand Watanabe met with Tokyo\u2019s mayor Yuriko Koike at a public press event where\nshe espoused her unequivocal support for the project. The mayor later gave\nPoul the honorary title of official tourism ambassador to Tokyo. The series\nalso received letters of support from elected members of Japan\u2019s Diet, the\nnational legislature.\n\n\u201cThese gestures didn\u2019t wield any immediate, direct power,\u201d Poul says. \u201cBut it\nhelped our locations department in dealing with local vendors and the cops,\nbecause the mayor had put out the word that we were to be treated well, and\nthat the show was now smiled upon by local and national government.\u201d\n\nWatanabe and Elgort, preparing to shoot their characters\u2019 encounter in\nAkasaka.\n\nOn the streets of Akasaka that Sunday night last March, Poul had pulled me\naside as the moment to shoot the big aftermath scene was finally nearing. The\nextras were being radioed into place and Watanabe and Elgort were each taking\na moment to themselves on the sidelines, preparing for their frantic meeting\non camera. The vague sense of tension that always precedes a take was\nbeginning to descend on the 50-plus cast and crewmembers scattered in various\npositions up and down the street. Poul pointed my attention to the arrangement\nof the period emergency vehicles parked in front of the building that was to\nserve as the fictional glitzy entrance to their story\u2019s shot-up hostess club.\nAkasaka Esplanade is a one-way street, and even though the police had granted\nthe show permission to close the road for several hours, stipulations\nremained. The producers had wanted to park the period ambulance and cop cars\nin a mish-mashed cluster surrounding the door, underscoring the feeling of\nchaos in the wake of a gun battle.\n\n\u201cEven though they let us close the road, the police said our prop cars had to\nobey the street signs,\u201d Poul explained, shaking his head at the emergency\nvehicles lined up in a tidy row in front of the building.\n\nSmiling ruefully, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve come a very long way, but we\u2019ll never quite\nget it all.\u201d\n\nAnsel Elgort on location in Akasaka.\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up\n\n## More from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n  * Live Feed\n\n### \u2018Quiet on Set\u2019 Directors Hint at Social Media as Next Area of Child\nEntertainment to Investigate\n\n  * Live Feed\n\n### The End of \u2018Yellowstone\u2019: What Is Known About the Final Episodes\n\n  * Live Feed\n\n### Kevin Costner Makes First Comments About His \u2018Yellowstone\u2019 Fate\n\n  * The Fien Print\n\n### \u2018The Sympathizer\u2019 Review: Robert Downey Jr. Dazzles and Distracts in HBO\u2019s\nAdaptation of the Pulitzer-Winning Novel\n\n  * Walton Goggins\n\n### \u2018Fallout\u2019 Review: Amazon Video Game Adaptation From \u2018Westworld\u2019 Creators\nIs Heavy on Vibes, Light on Narrative Stakes\n\n  * Live Feed\n\n### Michael Douglas on Playing a Founding Father in \u2018Franklin\u2019\n\nPMC Logo\n\n## Most Popular\n\n### Sources Claim John Travolta Is \u2018Totally Smitten\u2019 With This Co-star\n\n### Stevie J Shows The World What A \"Real\" Diddy Party Looks Like\n\n### IRS Letter an 'Indictment' of NIL Collectives\u2019 Exempt Status\n\n### Arles Caf\u00e9 Modeled After Van Gogh's Famous Painting Closed for Legal\nReasons\n\n## You may also like\n\n### The Best Swim Goggles for Men, According to Competitive Swimmers\n\n13 hours ago\n\n### Car of the Week: The First F1 Lotus Race Car Is Heading to Auction in\nMonaco\n\n2 days ago\n\n### BernNadette Stanis Says \u2018Good Times\u2019 Animation Was Supposed To Be\n\u201cProgressive\u201d\n\n5 hours ago\n\n### Megan Thee Stallion Reflects on \u2018Dark\u2019 Times Following Tory Lanez\nShooting: \u2018I Was Depressed\u2019\n\n7 hours ago\n\n### Follow Us\n\n### Newsletter Sign Up\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.
