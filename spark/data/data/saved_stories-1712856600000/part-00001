Accompanying the device is a free online book,\nproviding theoretical and practical insights into the unPhone\u2019s features.\n\nAccording to the product page, this device was developed through a\ncollaboration between the University of Sheffield, Pimoroni, and Gareth\nColeman. As mentioned earlier, this development platform is powered by the\nESP32-S3 microcontroller:\n\n\u2014 ADVERTISEMENT \u2014\n\n  * ESP32-S3 \u2014 Dual-core Xtensa LX7 (up to 240 MHz); 8M PSRAM, 8MB Flash\n\nunPhone kit (click image to enlarge)\n\nThe user interface is managed through a 3.5-inch LCD capacitive touchscreen,\noffering a resolution of 320 x 480 which can be used for debugging and UI\ndevelopment. Additional functionalities include IR LEDs, potentially used for\nremote control applications, and a vibration motor for notifications.\n\nSensors such as a compass and accelerometer are embedded in the unPhone,\nenhancing its utility in diverse applications. The device is powered by a\n1200mAh LiPo battery, which supports USB-C charging. The case appears to be\nincluded in the order, but the STL files are also available on the unPhone\nGitHub repository.\n\nunPhone pcb board (click images to enlarge)\n\nThe unPhone is designed with expandability in mind. It supports Adafruit\u2019s\nFeatherWing standard, allowing for straightforward extensions to the device.\nIn terms of programming, it supports both C++ and CircuitPython.\n\nDesigned as an open hardware and software platform, the unPhone is accompanied\nby a comprehensive IoT textbook to enhance its educational utility. Utilized\nin academic projects, such as control systems for aquaponic agriculture, it\nsupports and encourages community-driven learning, providing a various of\nresources and user support.\n\nunPhone demos (click images to enlarge)\n\nA complimentary online textbook is available, covering Sheffield University\u2019s\nInternet of Things course, suitable for anyone interested in IoT topics.\nChapter 11 specifically delves into the unPhone\u2019s capabilities. Additionally,\nits GitHub repository offers access to schematics, STL files, and software\nexamples for further exploration.\n\nFurther Information\n\nRetailing at \u00a3139.50, the unPhone kit includes a pre-assembled unPhone, an\nexpander board, a FPC cable to connect the two, and self-adhesive mounts for\nthe board, all available for purchase on the Pimoroni online store.\n\n#### LinuxGizmos related posts:\n\n  * ESP32-based LoRaWan Gateway Module with 1.8\u201d LCD\n  * M5Stack SmartWatch Kit Built Around ESP32-Pico-V2 MCU\n  * ESP Terminal is equipped with 3.5\u201d Capacitive Touch...\n  * BPI-Bit Lite is an educational board that runs on...\n  * Espressif Systems presents ESP32-S3-BOX-3 AIoT kit\n  * LILYGO\u2019s ESP32-based module comes with 2.41\u201d AMOLED display\n  * Olimex Launches ESP32 Boards with PoE and...\n  * RISC-V based ESP32-C3 DevKit supports Rust\n  * The Open-Source ESPGateway features 2x ESP32 modules\n  * ESP32-S3 based Rotary Switch with 2.1\" Touch Display\n\n(advertise here)\n\nPLEASE COMMENT BELOW  \n---  \n  \n### Please comment here...Cancel reply\n\n(advertise here)\n\nThe content on this site is copyright \u00a9 2007-2024 LinuxGizmos.com unless\notherwise noted.
