The state was experiencing its\nworst drought in 10 years. Trees went thirsty and died. Scrub brush crinkled\ninto kindling. And pandemic lockdowns drove Oregonions into one of their few\nescapes: the woods.\n\nThen, on Labor Day, the woods ignited. Blustery winds fueled five megafires\nand 12 others, which consumed a million acres in just a few days.\n\nOut in the woods, Wolfe knew one of those fires was burning just over the\nnearby mountain ridge. She stayed up all night, hitting refresh on the one\nFacebook page that shared updates on the fire's progress. In the morning, the\nsun rose red, illuminating a Mars-colored world. Wolfe kept hitting refresh as\nshe prepped her first lessons. School was starting soon. And Wolfe, who\nteaches high school environmental science, knew her students would have\nquestions about what was happening to their home. She was right: \"All the kids\nwere like, 'Why is our state on fire?'\"\n\nIn 2020, Oregonians lived through the most destructive wildfire season in the\nstate's history, which came with eerie red sunrises and huge swaths of burnt\nforest.

Such an amorphous,\nmultiheaded threat can be challenging to teach, if it is taught at all. Most\nteenagers get their climate change information (or disinformation) on social\nmedia. Each state gets to decide how much of their public school curriculum\nwill be dedicated to climate change (and the amount varies widely). Plus, not\nonly is the topic complex\u2014spanning a vast world of causes and solutions, many\nof which cannot be fully understood without some basic science\u2014but it can also\nbe anxiety-provoking. More than half of young people today feel \u201cvery or\nextremely worried\u201d about climate change. Gerunds and geometry do not cause the\nsame existential angst.\n\nWhen wildfires\u2014or floods, superstorms, or pandemics\u2014threaten your home, it is\nhard not to feel hopeless. Wolfe has often heard her students say: \u201cOh well.\nWe\u2019ll just move to Mars.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, recent studies suggest that focusing on solutions, action, and a\nsense of agency can help young people overcome climate anxiety. One of the\nmost promising solutions is clean energy: If the world can switch from fossil\nfuels to clean energy sources, like solar, wind, geothermal, water, and more,\nwe could dramatically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Now, the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Water\nPower Technologies Office (WPTO) have created a tool to help students\nvisualize these technological solutions.\n\nEnter: Renewable Energy Discovery (REDi) Island.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2024, NREL, WPTO, and IKM 3D released the long-anticipated REDi\nIsland app, an educational virtual world powered entirely by renewable energy.\n\nREDi Island is designed for students from high school and beyond (and\neventually from kindergarten on up), educators (like Wolfe), or anyone curious\nabout how we can build a more sustainable world powered by clean energy.\nStudents can explore technologies and careers through waystations, videos, 3D\nvisualizations, and more. And teachers can access curriculum resources and\nactivities, like a scavenger hunt that encourages users to think like a fish.\n\nRight now, REDi Island gets most of its energy from water power because, well,\nit is an island. These coastal communities live right beside powerful ocean\nwaves, currents, and tides, and an energetic river, too. In the future, the\napp developers plan to add even more renewable energy for users to explore\n(although users can already find two nonwater-power technologies churning out\nclean energy).\n\nText version\n\nFor now, this water-powered world can teach all about how steady hydropower\nand up-and-coming marine energy could help the country build a 100% clean\nenergy power system. REDi Island can also help students envision how they,\ntoo, can power this sustainable world by joining a vast range of water power\ncareers.\n\n\"It's very cutting edge,\" said Wolfe, who helped beta-test the app and plans\nto use it in her classroom. \"I like that it lets kids imagine how we could\npower our entire society with renewable energy because everyone's always\ntelling us that's impossible.\"\n\nSeeing is believing, as the adage says. But it is also what the research says\nabout climate communication: Visuals and videos are not only better at\nconveying abstract, esoteric concepts; they are also more likely to spark an\nemotional response. And emotions push people to act.\n\nIn REDi Island, users can see how river currents power a farm, how waves help\ngenerate clean drinking water, how bobbing buoys warn ships to avoid a coral\nreef, and how hydropower keeps a city's lights on. They can watch educational\nvideos on, say, \"the wonder of wave gliders,\" spin a 3D replica to examine\nwhat a winch drum does, or slip under water to discover if any featured\ntechnology is shorter than LeBron James.\n\nExplore REDi Island's waystations through videos, 3D replicas, and other\neducational resources.\n\nAs of the launch date, users can fully explore four of REDi Island's 15\nwaystations; two others are visible but not yet complete, and the final nine\nwill open in the coming months. Each station includes visual representations\nof a specific kind of renewable energy technology, like the observation buoy\nand surge flap pictured here, as well as videos, 3D replicas, and other\neducational resources.\n\n\"It's really challenging to get excited about science if it's stuff that they\ncan't relate to in their real lives,\" Wolfe said. \"The more that you can get\nkids playing around with things and seeing how things work, the better.\"\n\nOr, as one 9-year-old student student put it: \"It's better than regular\nclassroom lessons because it's 3D.\" Lucy Cardinal got a chance to play with\nthe web-based app before it launched. \"And your teachers are not just talking\nto you (no offense to Mrs. Ward),\" Lucy said. Mrs. Ward is her (beloved)\nteacher.\n\n## Why the World Needs Water Power, and Water Power Needs REDi Island\n\nAbout three years ago, a group of NREL researchers realized water power had a\nproblem. Unlike other renewable energy technologies, like rooftop solar panels\nor wind farms dotting plains next to highways, water power technologies are\noften overlooked.\n\nHydropower, one of the oldest renewables, has an invisibility problem: Often,\nhydropower facilities blend into the landscape and go unnoticed and\nunderappreciated. Yet they provide a solid foundation for the country to\ntransition to clean energy.\n\nNot much has changed\u2014at least in the overall island layout\u2014since the REDi\nIsland team drew this early schematic. The team started working on the app\nabout three years ago after they realized that water power, including\nhydropower and marine energy, are often left out of discussions about\nrenewable energy.\n\nAnd if hydropower is hard to find, marine energy technologies are even harder:\nAlthough this industry is getting closer to commercialization, many devices\nare still prototypes, being refined in labs or under water. The United States\nhas enough marine energy resources\u2014which include energy generated from fast-\nflowing rivers and ocean waves, currents, tides, and even shifts in salt\nlevels or pressure\u2014to meet nearly 60% of the country's electricity needs. We\ncannot harness all that power, but the grid will need all the clean energy it\ncan get. And these budding technologies could be especially valuable for\noffshore workers, like marine researchers or seafood farmers, as well as\ncoastal and island communities (like, say, the invisible residents of REDi\nIsland).\n\nThe problem is, these industries need a robust workforce to design, build,\nrefine, modernize, test, maintain, operate, and study these technologies, so\nthey fulfill their climate-change-fighting potential.\n\nSo, how do you encourage people to care about something they cannot even see?\n\nWill Moore (front, fourth from the left) and this team of University of New\nHampshire undergraduate students recently competed in the Marine Energy\nCollegiate Competition. Moore hopes that one day, REDi Island will include the\ndevice his team worked to build\u2014an open-ocean buoy that tracks weather and\nocean-current data using the power of the ocean. Photo from the University of\nNew Hampshire\n\nIn REDi Island, students not only get a chance to explore these often-\ninvisible technologies, but they can also explore water power career options.\nNot all water power workers need a degree in engineering or a passion for\ntinkering with gears, motors, or electrical wires. Future water power workers\ncould also help grow new coral reefs, draft ocean policy, weld metals together\nto fix underwater technologies, monitor fisheries or tsunamis, capture carbon,\nor even help communities get clean drinking water or recover from natural\ndisasters. (Folks can find even more water power careers\u2014and guidance on how\nto join them\u2014with the U.S. Department of Energy's water power career maps).\n\n\"Plenty of young people care about renewable energy. They just might not know\nhow to engage in the topic or become aware of how they can participate,\" said\nWill Moore, an undergraduate student at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nMoore, who is studying mechanical engineering, knew nothing about marine\nenergy until he and a team of his fellow engineers participated in WPTO's\nMarine Energy Collegiate Competition. \"It opened my eyes,\" he said. \"I'm only\nan hour and a half from the ocean at the most. But I've never really heard of\nmarine energy.\"\n\nMoore said he appreciates that users can choose how much information to glean\nfrom REDi Island's knowledge nuggets. Some technical bits, like how multimedia\nfilters remove large particles or oscillating water columns generate energy,\nare better suited for more advanced students while animated videos about\nHawaii's humpback whales or a glowing fish sculpture named \"Gil\" might entice\nyounger learners.\n\n\"When you say this device's power is 15 kilowatts, younger kids might not know\nwhat that means,\" Moore said. \"But if you said you could power your house for\ntwo days, they can get a better understanding. People are always surprised how\nmuch energy can actually be harvested.\"\n\nREDi Island provides teachers and students with a way to explore solutions in\na world that is successfully fighting the climate crisis. That is critical to\nhelp combat climate anxiety, which can prevent people, especially today's\nyounger generations, from feeling empowered enough to take action.\n\n## \"It's So Much More Than a Mario Brothers\"\n\nA clean energy future sounds lovely. And yet, much of today's news about\nclimate change can still feel dire and depressing. It is easy for people to\nsimply shut the news off and shut down. But apathy is the opposite of what the\nworld needs. The planet needs action.\n\nIn the United Nations tips for talking about climate change, they state: \"A\ngood way around disillusionment and 'crisis fatigue' is to convey a hopeful\nmessage focused on the solutions, helping people feel empowered and motivated\nto engage.\"\n\nIn River Ramble, one of REDi Island's forthcoming waystations, a farm runs\nexclusively on energy generated from river currents. This might seem too good\nto be true, but a rural town in Alaska, called Igiugig, is already generating\nenergy from its powerful Kvichak River.\n\nIn REDi Island, people can escape into a future where those solutions are\nalready creating the world we need. That world might seem as magical as living\non Mars, but unlike that fantasy, REDi Island's dream is closer to becoming a\nreality. The country is ready to build communities that look like REDi Island;\nthese climate-fighting industries just need people to care and get to work.\n\n\"The kids, they're ready for the real-world things they hear about routinely,\nright?\" Wolfe said. \"For them, it's about the cause.\"\n\nFuture generations can get excited about tidal turbines, run-of-river\nhydropower, or protecting coral reefs without carrying the weight of saving\nthe world. Although users can explore just four of 15 renewable energy\nwaystations currently, the next 11 are expected to open in the coming months;\nthose who are too excited to wait can watch videos on all 15 waystations,\nincluding Cooling Concourse, Aquaculture Arena, and Hydro Heights, on YouTube.\n\n\"It's so much more than a Mario Brothers,\" 9-year-old Lucy said. \"It's\nactually giving you facts so you can learn, and it's really fun. My friends\nare going to love this.\"\n\nIf enough people pick up REDi Island, maybe Wolfe's students will no longer\nsee Mars as their only hope. Maybe someday, she'll hear them say: \"Oh well.\nWe'll just move to REDi Island.\"\n\nArielle Cardinal, one of the original creators of REDi Island\n\nLucy Cardinal, Arielle's daughter, who got a chance to play with the REDi\nIsland app before it was officially launched\n\nEva Wolfe introduces her students to REDi Island\n\nPrevious Next\n\nLearn more about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)\ncareers and workforce development opportunities on the Hydropower STEM Portal\nand Marine Energy STEM Portal.\n\nSubscribe to NREL's newest water power STEM newsletter, the SPLASH (Student-\nProfessional Learning and Sharing Hub), to stay up to date on exciting\nresearch.\n\nTags:\n\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\n\nAbout\n\nResearch\n\nPartner With Us\n\nNews\n\nCareers\n\nContact Us\n\nVisit\n\nSubscribe to NREL\n\nAccessibility\n\nDisclaimer\n\nSecurity and Privacy\n\nSite Feedback\n\nContent Editors\n\nDevelopers\n\nEmployees\n\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory is a national laboratory of the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,\noperated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy LLC.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
