Sign up for a Shortcut account at https://www.shortcut.com/signup.\n\n     * NOTE: Do not run this importer against an existing Shortcut workspace that already has data you wish to keep.\n  2. Create a new API token and export it into your environment. Ensure you use this token only for this importer, so that you aren't rate limited unexpectedly by the Shortcut API.\n  3. Export your Pivotal project to CSV and save the file to data/pivotal_export.csv.\n  4. Create/Invite all users you want to reference into your Shortcut workspace.\n\n     * NOTE: If you're not on a Shortcut trial, please reach out to our support team before running this import to make sure you're not billed for users that you want to be disabled after import.\n  5. Run make import to perform a dry-run of the import.\n\n     * Follow instructions printed to the console to ensure the mapping of Pivotal and Shortcut data is complete and correct.\n     * Refer to data/priorities.csv, data/states.csv, and data/users.csv to review these mappings.\n     * Ensure a group_id is set in your config.json file if you want to assign the epics and stories you import to a Shortcut Team/Group.\n  6. If the dry-run output looks correct, you can apply the import to your Shortcut workspace by running make import-apply\n\n     * The console should print a link to an import-specific Shortcut label page that you can review to find all imported Stories and Epics.\n     * If you run the importer multiple times, you can review all imported Stories and Epics by visiting Settings > Labels and then searching for the pivotal->shortcut label and clicking on it.\n  7. If you find that you need to adjust your configuration or your Pivotal data and try again, you can run make delete to review a dry-run and make delete-apply to actually delete the imported Shortcut epics and stories listed in data/shortcut_imported_entities.csv. You can also archive or delete content in the Shortcut application if needed.\n\n# Operation\n\nBefore you run the import, you should go through the steps in Prerequisites\nand Setup. You can check that the prerequisites are superficially met by\nrunning pivotal_import.py which by default will not write any changes to your\nShortcut workspace. You can use this mode to validate that you've configured\nthe import correctly.\n\nIf pivotal_import.py completes without errors, you can run the script with the\n--apply flag, which will enable writing to the Shortcut API.\n\n# Known Limitations\n\nThis is alpha software. Not only is not guaranteed to be without bugs, but it\nis under active development and has several known feature gaps to be filled\nbefore we consider it complete.\n\nThe following are known limitations:\n\n  * Limited story reviews: Shortcut does not have a feature equivalent to Pivotal story reviews, so they are imported as follows:\n\n    * Pivotal story reviewers are imported as Shortcut story followers on the stories they were assigned for review. Shortcut story followers receive updates in their Shortcut Activity Feed for all story updates.\n    * Imported stories that had Pivotal reviews have an additional comment with a table that lists all of the story reviews from Pivotal (reviewer, review type, and review status).\n    * Imported stories that had Pivotal reviews have a label in Shortcut of pivotal-had-review.\n  * No story blockers: Pivotal story blockers (the relationships between stories) are not imported.\n  * No iterations: Pivotal iterations are not imported.\n  * Epics are imported as unstarted: Imported epics are set to an unstarted \"Todo\" state.\n  * No redirects: The URLs in the descriptions and comments of your Pivotal stories/epics are not rewritten to point to imported Shortcut stories/epics; they remain unchanged.\n  * No attachments: The attachments (including Google Drive attachments) are not imported into Shortcut.\n  * No history: Project history is not imported into Shortcut.\n\nOur intention is to attend to items higher on the list sooner than those\nlower.\n\nPlease check currently open issues for further reported limitations.\n\n# Customization\n\nIt's possible that this tool does not do exactly what you'd like it to - if\nthat's the case, we have tried to make it straightforward to modify. Make\nreference to the Shortcut API and the other examples in this cookbook, and\nplease let us know in our Discord what you're doing with it!\n\n# Contributing\n\nAny contributions you make are greatly appreciated!\n\nIf you have a bug report or feature request, please create a GitHub Issue.\n\nIf you need to share sensitive information or need help specific to your\nShortcut workspace, please submit a help center request instead.\n\nYou can also chat with us anytime on our Shortcut Communuity Discord.\n\nIf you have code changes that would make this better, please fork this\nrepository and create a pull request. Don't forget to give the project a star!\nThanks again!\n\n  1. Fork the Project\n  2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)\n  3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')\n  4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)\n  5. Open a Pull Request\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
