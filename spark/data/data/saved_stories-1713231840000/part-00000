Where did pop culture\u2019s most dramatic sound come from?\n\nThis article is more than 2 years old\n\nDid the iconic three-note sequence come from Stravinsky, the Muppets or\nsomewhere else? Our writer set out to \u2013 dun, dun duuuun! \u2013 reveal the mystery\n\nAmelia Tait\n\nShare\n\nThere\u2019s surely only one thing that unites Russian composer Igor Stravinsky\u2019s\nRite of Spring, the 1974 comedy horror Young Frankenstein and The Muppets\u2019\nmost recent special on Disney+. Regrettably, it is not Kermit the Frog. The\nthing that appears in all of these works has no easily recognisable familiar\nname, although it is perhaps one of the most recognisable three-beat musical\nphrases in history. It starts with a dun; it continues with a dun; it ends\nwith a duuun!\n\nOn screen, a dramatic \u201cdun, dun duuun\u201d has appeared in everything from\nDisney\u2019s Fantasia to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to The IT Crowd. In 2007, a\nYouTuber scored a video of a melodramatic prairie dog with the three beats,\nearning over 43m views and a solid place in internet history. Yet though many\nof us are familiar with the sound, no one seems to know exactly where it came\nfrom. Try to Google it and ... dun, dun, duuun! Its origins are a mystery.\n\nTaken together, these three duns are what\u2019s known as a sting \u2013 a brief bit of\nmusic that media producers can use to break up the action or punctuate a\ntheatrical moment. While today\u2019s dun dun duuuns are often employed jokingly to\nparody the dramas of days gone by, the suspenseful sound was once legitimately\nused to frighten and thrill.\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges of radio \u2013 and it\u2019s the same now as it was 100 years\nago \u2013 is how do you hook the listener?\u201d says Richard Hand, a media professor\nat the University of East Anglia and author of Terror on the Air! Horror Radio\nin America, 1931-1952. Alongside orchestral stings, sound effects such as\nclock chimes, claps of thunder, and whistling wind were used to grab the\naudience\u2019s attention in the early days of radio, as the medium has always\ninvited multitasking.\u201cThose dramatic organ stings could have a powerful\neffect.\u201d\n\nBefore the development of sound libraries, many of these stings were performed\nlive. \u201cThey became cliched and we laugh at them, but actually what soundscapes\ncan do can be extraordinary.\u201d\n\nSuspense, an American horror show broadcast on CBS Radio between 1942 and\n1962, was filled to the brim with sound effects and dramatic stings. Just over\nthree minutes into its first episode (after bells, the sound of a train, and\nplenty of piano), a three-beat sting lingers on its last note when a man\ndiscovers his wife is potentially an undead poisoner. But it\u2019s difficult to\npinpoint the very first on-air dun dun duuun, and it\u2019s likely the musical\nphrase predates the radio. Hand says the medium tended to adopt already\npopular tropes to entice listeners. \u201cThey imported that musical structure and\nmusical language,\u201d he says, pointing to Victorian stage melodramas.\n\nIn fact, Patrick Feaster \u2013 an expert in the preservation of early sound media,\nand co-founder of the First Sounds Initiative \u2013 argues that dun dun duuun\ncould have been a cliche long before the advent of radio drama. Though he\ndoesn\u2019t know when or where the three duns arose, he points out that stings\n\u201cthat work in much the same way\u201d appeared in the 1912 melodrama parody\nDesperate Desmond by comedian Fred Duprez.\n\nDramatic punctuation ... The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Photograph: NBC/Getty\nImages\n\nIn a recording of the sketch which can be heard on the US Library of Congress\nwebsite, Duprez mocks melodramas by telling a story and rebutting the\nincongruous sounds that play between the action (when a villain enters with a\ndramatic sting and a clip-clop, he exasperatedly says, \u201cNot on a horse! Just\non his feet!\u201d).\n\nThough the stings heard in this sketch are single duns (sans the follow -up\ndun and duuun), Feaster says: \u201cIt seems stinger chords must have been\nentrenched enough in melodrama by 1912 to invite parody.\u201d He guesses that the\nthree-beat version may have then come to be preferred for satire, \u201cbecause\nit\u2019s more conspicuous than a single all-at-once chord would be.\u201d\n\nProducers continued to enjoy parodying dramatic stings on radio shows\nthroughout the 20th century \u2013 The Goon Show in the 1950s regularly ridiculed\naudio tropes in mock detective stories such as The Dreaded Piano Clubber.\nOccasionally, three duns were still used for dramatic effect in film: In\n1940\u2019s Fantasia, Disney\u2019s recording of Stravinsky\u2019s 1913 Rite of Spring\nemphasised two duns and a lingering duuun at the end of a dinosaur battle\n(though the composer\u2019s original features a similar three beats, they\u2019re not as\npronounced or as recognisable as the sound we know today). From Tom and Jerry\nto Ren and Stimpy, dun dun duuuns also cropped up in cartoons, ensuring the\nsound became a television mainstay. Young Frankenstein\u2019s version debuted in\nthe 1970s, and it was this recording that was used for the dramatic prairie\ndog viral vid. But since 1984, if you\u2019ve heard a dun dun duuun vibrating from\nyour television set, it\u2019s likely it came from one specific source.\n\n\u2018Like having a Penguin Classic\u2019 ... Beavis and Butt-Head. Photograph:\nMoviestore/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a Penguin Classic,\u201d says 74-year-old composer Dick Walter,\nwho has arranged music for programmes such as The Two Ronnies and The\nMorecambe & Wise Show. In 1983, recordings library KPM Music asked Walter to\nproduce four vinyl albums of musical phrases known as The Editor\u2019s Companion.\nWith an orchestral lineup of around 35 to 40 people, Walter recorded hundreds\nof tracks over the course of 18 months, including chase music, sleighbells,\nand a four-second, three-beat sting called Shock Horror (A) that comprises the\nnotes D#, C and F#.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s musical shorthand which says a lot very quickly,\u201d Walter says of the\nfirst of five melodramatic exclamations that run all the way down to Shock\nHorror (E). But where did he find the inspiration? Walter\u2019s mother, an amateur\npianist, used to play Edwardian and Victorian melodrama in the house, while he\nwas a lover of jazz as a teen. He explains that for centuries, composers have\nused a particular musical interval to denote tension. Its name? Diabolus in\nmusica \u2013 or \u201cthe devil\u2019s interval\u201d to you and me.\n\nThe devil\u2019s interval is a dissonant combination of tones that unsettles the\nlistener because it is unresolved. You\u2019ve likely heard the devil\u2019s interval as\nthe opening two notes to The Simpson\u2019s theme tune, as well as the beginning of\nMaria from West Side Story (Walter helpfully sings both). Yet in both cases,\nthe tension is immediately resolved with the next note, producing a pleasant\neffect. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t resolve it, you\u2019re left feeling unsatisfied,\u201d Walter\nexplains, \u201cThat\u2019s what it boils down to.\u201d\n\nWhen Walter was charged with creating horror stings for The Editor\u2019s\nCompanion, \u201cthe obvious thing to do\u201d for Shock Horror (A) was use the interval\n\u2013 his is \u201cjust an extremely abbreviated version, about as short as you can\nget\u201d. A few years ago, he was happy to hear his sting played on BBC radio show\nI\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue, realising \u201cit\u2019s obviously become a bit of a go-to\nthing\u201d.\n\nThis is an understatement \u2013 The recording has since been used in SpongeBob\nSquarePants, Roseanne, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Beavis and Butt-Head,\nas well as adverts for cereal, snacks and a home improvement store. While some\nproducers may prefer to create their own version, Walter\u2019s sting has become an\neasy staple \u2013 the bread and butter of dun, dun, duuuns. There is \u2013 dramatic\npause! \u2013 no way of knowing where it will end up next.\n\n\u201cI think the thing that makes Shock Horror eminently usable is that it\u2019s\norchestral, so it\u2019s quite big,\u201d Walter says of the track\u2019s appeal. \u201cSo in one\nsense, it doesn\u2019t date. It\u2019s sort of timeless.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Music\n  * Television\n  * Radio\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
