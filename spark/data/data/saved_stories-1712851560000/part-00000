This\nimprovisation is most conspicuous in the ceaselessly evolving struggle between\nweaponized drones and electronic warfare, a cornerstone of this war.\n\nWeaponized civilian first-person-view (FPV) drones began dramatically\nreshaping the landscape of the war in the summer of 2023. Prior to this\nrevolution, various commercial drones played critical roles, primarily for\nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Since 2014, the main means of\ndefending against these drones has been electronic warfare (EW), in its many\nforms. The iterative, lethal dance between drones and EW has unfolded a rich\ntechnological tapestry, revealing insights into a likely future of warfare\nwhere EW and drones intertwine.\n\nAfter the invasion of Crimea, in 2014, Ukrainian forces depended heavily on\ncommercial off-the-shelf drones, such as models from DJI, for reconnaissance\nand surveillance. These were not FPV drones, for the most part. Russia\u2019s\nresponse involved deploying military-grade EW systems alongside law-\nenforcement tools like Aeroscope, a product from DJI that allows instant\nidentification and tracking of drones from their radio emissions. Aeroscope,\nwhile originally a standard tool used by law enforcement to detect and track\nillegal drone flights, soon revealed its military potential by pinpointing\nboth the drone and its operator.\n\nOn both sides of the line you\u2019ll find much the same kind of people doing much\nthe same thing: hacking.\n\nThis application turned a security feature into a significant tactical asset,\nproviding Russian artillery units with precise coordinates for their\ntargets\u2014namely, Ukrainian drone operators. To circumvent this vulnerability,\ngroups of Ukrainian volunteers innovated. By updating the firmware of the DJI\ndrones, they closed the backdoors that allowed the drones to be tracked by\nAeroscope. Nevertheless, after the start of the conflict in Crimea,\ncommercial, off-the-shelf drones were considered a last-resort asset used by\nvolunteers to compensate for the lack of proper military systems. To be sure,\nthe impact of civilian drones during this period was not comparable to what\noccurred after the February 2022 invasion.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s \u201cthunder-run\u201d strategy became bogged down shortly after the\ninvasion, Russian forces found themselves unexpectedly vulnerable to civilian\ndrones, in part because most of their full-scale military EW systems were not\nvery mobile.\n\nDuring a training exercise in southern Ukraine in May 2023, a drone pilot\nmaneuvered a flier to a height of 100 meters before dropping a dummy anti-tank\ngrenade on to a pile of tires. The test, pictured here, worked\u2014that night the\npilot\u2019s team repeated the exercise over occupied territory, blowing up a\nRussian armored vehicle. Emre Caylak/Guardian/eyevine/Redux\n\nThe Russians could have compensated by deploying many Aeroscope terminals\nthen, but they didn\u2019t, because most Russian officers at the time had a\ndismissive view of the capabilities of civilian drones in a high-intensity\nconflict. That failure opened a window of opportunity that Ukrainian armed-\nforces units exploited aggressively. Military personnel, assisted by many\nvolunteer technical specialists, gained a decisive intelligence advantage for\ntheir forces by quickly fielding fleets of hundreds of camera drones connected\nto simple yet effective battlefield-management systems. They soon began\nmodifying commercial drones to attack, with grenade tosses and, ultimately,\n\u201ckamikaze\u201d operations. Besides the DJI models, one of the key drones was the\nR18, an octocopter developed by the Ukrainian company Aerorozvidka, capable of\ncarrying three grenades or small bombs. As casualties mounted, Russian\nofficers soon realized the extent of the threat posed by these drones.\n\n## How Russian electronic warfare evolved to counter the drone threat\n\nBy spring 2023, as the front lines stabilized following strategic withdrawals\nand counteroffensives, it was clear that the nature of drone warfare had\nevolved. Russian defenses had adapted, deploying more sophisticated counter-\ndrone systems. Russian forces were also beginning to use drones, setting the\nstage for the nuanced cat-and-mouse game that has been going on ever since.\n\nThe modular construction of first-person-view drones allowed for rapid\nevolution to enhance their resilience against electronic warfare.\n\nFor example, early on, most Russian EW efforts primarily focused on jamming\nthe drones\u2019 radio links for control and video. This wasn\u2019t too hard, given\nthat DJI\u2019s OcuSync protocol was not designed to withstand dense jamming\nenvironments. So by April 2023, Ukrainian drone units had begun pivoting\ntoward first-person-view (FPV) drones with modular construction, enabling\nrapid adaptation to, and evasion of, EW countermeasures.\n\nThe Russian awakening to the importance of drones coincided with the\nstabilization of the front lines, around August 2022. Sluggish Russian\noffensives came at a high cost, with an increasing proportion of casualties\ncaused directly or indirectly by drone operators. By this time, the Ukrainians\nwere hacking commercial drones, such as DJI Mavics, to \u201canonymize\u201d them,\nrendering Aeroscope useless. It was also at this time that the Russians began\nto adopt commercial drones and develop their own tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures, leveraging their EW and artillery advantages while attempting to\ncompensate for their delay in combat-drone usage.\n\nOn 4 March, a Ukrainian soldier flew a drone at a testing site near the town\nof Kreminna in eastern Ukraine. The drone was powered by a blue battery pack\nand carried a dummy bomb.David Guttenfelder/The New York Times/Redux\n\nThroughout 2023, when the primary EW tactic employed was jamming, the DJI\ndrones began to fall out of favor for attack roles. When the density of\nRussian jammer usage surpassed a certain threshold, DJI\u2019s OcuSync radio\nprotocol, which controls a drone\u2019s flight direction and video, could not cope\nwith it. Being proprietary, OcuSync\u2019s frequency band and power are not\nmodifiable. A jammer can attack both the control and video signals, and the\ndrone becomes unrecoverable most of the time. As a result, DJI drones have\nlately been used farther from the front lines and relegated mainly to roles in\nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Meanwhile, the modular\nconstruction of FPVs allowed for rapid evolution to enhance their resilience\nagainst EW. The Ukraine war greatly boosted the world\u2019s production of FPV\ndrones; at this point there are thousands of FPV models and modifications.\n\nA \u201ckamikaze\u201d first-person-view drone with an attached PG-7L round, intended\nfor use with an RPG-7 grenade launcher, is readied for a mission near the town\nof Horlivka, in the Donetsk region, on 17 January 2024. The drone was prepared\nby a Ukrainian serviceman of the Rarog UAV squadron of the 24th Separate\nMechanized Brigade.Inna Varenytsia/Reuters/Redux\n\nAs of early 2024, analog video signals are the most popular option by far.\nThis technology offers drone operators a brief window of several seconds to\ncorrect the drone\u2019s path upon detecting interference, for example as a result\nof jamming, before signal loss. Additionally, drone manufacturers have access\nto more powerful video transmitters, up to 5 watts, which are more resistant\nto jamming. Furthermore, the 1.2-gigahertz frequency band is gaining\npopularity over the previously dominant 5.8-GHz band due to its superior\nobstacle penetration and because fewer jammers are targeting that band.\n\nHowever, the lack of encryption in analog video transmitter systems means that\na drone\u2019s visual feed can be intercepted by any receiver. So various\nmitigation strategies have been explored. These include adding encryption\nlayers and using digital-control and video protocols such as HDZero,\nWalksnail, or, especially, any of several new open-source alternatives.\n\nIn the war zone, the most popular of these open-source control radio protocols\nis ExpressLRS, or ELRS. Being open-source, ELRS not only offers more\naffordable hardware than its main rival, TBS Crossfire, it is also modifiable\nvia its software. It has been hacked in order to use frequency bands other\nthan its original 868 to 915 megahertz. This adaptation produces serious\nheadaches for EW operators, because they have to cover a much wider band. As\nof March 2024, Ukrainian drone operators are performing final tests on 433-MHz\nELRS transmitter-receiver pairs, further challenging prevailing EW methods.\n\n## Distributed mass in the transparent battlefield\n\nNevertheless, the most important recent disruption of all in the drone-versus-\nEW struggle is distributed mass. Instead of an envisioned blitzkrieg-style\nswarm with big clouds of drones hitting many closely spaced targets during\nvery short bursts, an ever-growing number of drones are covering more widely\ndispersed targets over a much longer time period, whenever the weather is\nconducive. Distributed mass is a cornerstone of the emerging transparent\nbattlefield, in which many different sensors and platforms transmit huge\namounts of data that is integrated in real time to provide a comprehensive\nview of the battlefield. One offshoot of this strategy is that more and more\nkamikaze drones are directed toward a constantly expanding range of targets.\nElectronic warfare is adapting to this new reality, confronting mass with\nmass: massive numbers of drones against massive numbers of RF sensors and\njammers.\n\nUkraine is the first true war of the hackers.\n\nAttacks now often consist of far more commercial drones than a suite of RF\ndetectors or jammers could handle even six months ago. With brute-force\njamming, even if defenders are willing to accept high rates of damage\ninflicted on their own offensive drones, these previous EW systems are just\nnot up to the task. So for now, at least, the drone hackers are in the lead in\nthis deadly game of \u201chacksymmetrical\u201d warfare. Their development cycle is far\ntoo rapid for conventional electronic warfare to keep pace.\n\nBut the EW forces are not standing still. Both sides are either developing or\nacquiring civilian RF-detecting equipment, while military-tech startups and\neven small volunteer groups are developing new, simple, and good-enough\njammers in essentially the same improvised ways that hackers would.\n\nUkrainian soldiers familiarized themselves with a portable drone jammer during\na training session in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on 11 March 2024.Diego Herrera\nCarcedo/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nTwo examples illustrate this trend. Increasingly affordable, short-range\njammers are being installed on tanks, armored personnel carriers, trucks,\npickups, and even 4x4s. Although limited and unsophisticated, these systems\ncontribute to drone-threat mitigation. In addition, a growing number of\nsoldiers on the front line carry simple, commercial radio-frequency (RF)\nscanners with them. Configured to detect drones across various frequency\nbands, these devices, though far from perfect, have begun to save lives by\nproviding precious additional seconds of warning before an imminent drone\nattack.\n\nThe electronic battlefield has now become a massive game of cat and mouse.\nBecause commercial drones have proven so lethal and disruptive, drone\noperators have become high-priority targets. As a result, operators have had\nto reinvent camouflage techniques, while the hackers who drive the evolution\nof their drones are working on every modification of RF equipment that offers\nan advantage. Besides the frequency-band modification described above, hackers\nhave developed and refined two-way, two-signal repeatersfor drones. Such\nsystems are attached to another drone that hovers close to the operator and\nwell above the ground, relaying signals to and from the attacking drone. Such\nrepeaters more than double the practical range of drone communications, and\nthus the EW \u201ccats\u201d in this game have to search a much wider area than before.\n\nHackers and an emerging cottage industry of war startups are raising the\nstakes. Their primary goal is to erode the effectiveness of jammers by\nattacking them autonomously. In this countermeasure, offensive drones are\nequipped with home-on-jam systems. Over the next several months, increasingly\nsophisticated versions of these systems will be fielded. These home-on-jam\ncapabilities will autonomously target any jamming emission within range; this\nrange, which is classified, depends on emission power at a rate that is\nbelieved to be 0.3 kilometers per watt. In other words, if a jammer has 100 W\nof signal power, it can be detected up to 30 km away, and then attacked. After\nthese advances allow the drone \u201cmice\u201d to hunt the EW cat, what will happen to\nthe cat?\n\nThe challenge is unprecedented and the outcome uncertain. But on both sides of\nthe line you\u2019ll find much the same kind of people doing much the same thing:\nhacking. Civilian hackers have for years lent their skills to such shady\nenterprises as narco-trafficking and organized crime. Now hacking is a major,\nindispensable component of a full-fledged war, and its practitioners have\nemerged from a gray zone of plausible deniability into the limelight of\nmilitary prominence. Ukraine is the first true war of the hackers.\n\nThe implications for Western militaries are ominous. We have neither masses of\ndrones nor masses of EW tech. What is worse, the world\u2019s best hackers are\ncompletely disconnected from the development of defense systems. The Ukrainian\nexperience, where a vibrant war startup scene is emerging, suggests a model\nfor integrating maverick hackers into our defense strategies. As the first\nhacker war continues to unfold, it serves as a reminder that in the era of\nelectronic and drone warfare, the most critical assets are not just the\ntechnologies we deploy but also the scale and the depth of the human ingenuity\nbehind them.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * The Fall and Rise of Russian Electronic Warfare \u203a\n  * Puzzling Out the Drone War Over Ukraine \u203a\n  * Budget Drones in Ukraine Are Redefining Warfare \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Killer drones pioneered in Ukraine are the weapons of the future \u203a\n\nelectronic warfarefpv dronedjiukraine conflictdrones\n\nJuan Chulilla\n\nJuan Chulilla is a cofounder of Red Team Shield S.L., a company dedicated to\ndeveloping defense solutions against weaponized commercial drones.

Although it is\ncommonly believed that VHF propagation is mostly \"line of sight,\" true line of\nsight propagation is in fact relatively rare in terrestrial applications.\nSignals at VHF normally experience refraction, reflection, diffraction, and\nscattering, with these effects often increasing with distance.\n\nIn addition to these common propagation modes, there are several uncommon\nmodes at VHF. This educational note introduces the four most important of\nthese modes: tropospheric ducting, sporadic E, meteor burst, and \"Earth-Moon-\nEarth\" (EME). Tropospheric ducting and sporadic E are not commonly used for\ncommunications due to their unpredictable appearance, but they are both\nsufficiently common that they can create issues with regard to interference,\ndirection finding, and signals intelligence applications. Other modes, such as\nmeteor burst and EME, can however provide reliable long-distance communication\nat VHF, and thus represent potential backup communications methods at the\nregional or global level.\n\nEnergy Semiconductors News Climate Tech Climate Change\n\n## Generator Redesign Tries to Catch a Good Wave\n\n###\n\nNew triboelectric nanogenerator doubles the current for smallscale wave energy\n\nRahul Rao\n\nRahul Rao is a freelance science and technology writer based in London.

For more than a decade, materials\nscientists have been tweaking materials on tiny scales to harvest electric\ncharge from moving water. Now, by making a fundamental change to one such\ndevice\u2019s design, a group at Central South University in Changsha, China, has\nmanaged to more than double its current collection capabilities.\n\nTo be precise, the Changsha group\u2019s device is called the triboelectric\nnanogenerator (TENG). True to their name, TENGs rely on the triboelectric\neffect: If one material rubs across another, electric charge can transfer from\none to the other. Given the correct materials, a TENG can then harvest that\nmoving charge as electricity. The \u201cnano\u201d part comes in the material: Creating\nan effective TENG requires shaping the material with very small structures in\norder to tweak the electric exchange into drawing more current.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\n", "frontpage": true}
