With attacks such\nas Leaky Vessels, a hacker can wreak havoc on your programs, smash other\ncontainerized applications, and grant the attacker root user-level privileges.\nIn short, it's all over for your security. To prevent such attacks, Edera is\ntaking an old program into a new language to provide a memory-safe container\nruntime.\n\nWritten in Rust, Edera is built on the foundation of the classic open-source\ntype-1, bare-metal Virtual Machine hypervisor, Xen. This hypervisor was\nselected, as Edera Chief Innovation Officer and Alpine Linux maintainer\nAriadne Conill, explained, because, unlike KVM, which runs inside the Linux\nkernel, it's a dedicated type-1 hypervisor. These are inherently more secure\nthan the popular type-2 hypervisors.\n\nAlso: The best VPN services: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nIf you're a techie, you may think that's true, but aren't hypervisors of both\ntypes all about virtual machines (VM), not containers? That's correct, but the\nEdera team has taken the hypervisor design and shifted it over to containers.\nAs Emily Long, Edera's CEO, said, \"Hypervisors haven't been reimagined for\nnearly two decades and just don't work in the cloud-native world.\" The Edera\ndevelopers are building a true 21st-century hypervisor.\n\nThe foundation of the new program is Krata. This is a Xen-based, single-host\nhypervisor built for Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant containers. It\nisolates containers with a fully memory-safe Rust control plane to bring Xen\ntooling into a new, secure era. In addition, Edera uses Lukko, an open-source\nmemory safety runtime library. This library detects memory safety violations\nat runtime and cleanly terminates programs before they can be exploited.\n\nEdera is secure by design. It's the only independent solution that offers\nisolation at the container level, making container escapes impossible, no\nmatter where you run your infrastructure: a hyper cloud, a local cloud, or\nyour own servers.\n\n## Edera's key features\n\nIsolation\n\n  * Type 1 hypervisor runs on bare metal with no shared kernel state between containers.\n\n  * Hardened security guarantees with no container escapes.\n\n  * Trusted and untrusted workloads run in the same cluster with zero risk.\n\nMemory Safety\n\n  * Coded in Rust, ensuring complete memory safety.\n\n  * The principle of least authority limits the attack surface.\n\nSecure Memory Encryption\n\n  * Unilateral data transfer between confidential containers.\n\n  * Memory encryption between guests creating highly secure enclaves.\n\nAdditionally, the finished Edera Protect will include a suite of advanced\nfeatures, such as an enterprise control plane, multi-cluster management, and\nguided memory safety violation remediation. These features will be\ncomplemented by out-of-the-box Kubernetes compatibility and premium support\nservices.\n\nEventually, Edera will also enable customers to deploy a mix of workload types\nin their clusters instead of having different clusters for legacy\nvirtualization and containers. It will also support distributing traditional\nVM images in the same way containers are distributed, providing a more\nconsistent developer experience when working with both containers and\ntraditional VMs.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nEdera's founding team, composed of Conill, Long, and Alex Zenla, CTO, is an\nall-women team. This is a departure from the usual tech bro technology\ndevelopment leadership norm. Their combined expertise spans engineering\nleadership, software security, product innovation, and executive management.\nThey have a shared vision of building a more inclusive, empowering, and secure\ntechnological future.\n\nThe time is right for Edera. With companies needing more secure containers\nthanks to the increasing complexity of container orchestration and Kubernetes\nsecurity vulnerabilities, Edera presents a secure-by-design approach that\naddresses these challenges. Indeed, the company's unique approach, leveraging\nRust's memory safety capabilities and modern hypervisor technology, may render\nmany existing security tools obsolete by providing robust isolation at the\ncontainer level.\n\nAlso: Google survey: 63% of IT and security pros believe AI will improve\ncorporate cybersecurity\n\nAnyone can contribute to Krata today, and Lukko is set for an initial release\non May 1, 2024. The founders will shortly be starting their first fundraising\nround and are excited to start that process.\n\nI'm excited to see what they do going forward. This really is a new,\ninnovative approach to container security, and it could well be a game changer\nfor cloud-native computing.\n\n#### Featured\n\nGoogle finally launches its Find My Device network.
