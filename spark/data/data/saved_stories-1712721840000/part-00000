The company is developing\nthe drone under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Manta\nRay program, which seeks to demonstrate critical technologies for a new class\nof very long-endurance payload-capable UUVs.\n\nThe news was announced by Northrop earlier today, along with the release of\nthe first image of its full-size testbed, seen in the feature image of this\narticle. Now that its assembly has been finalized, the next step will be to\nactually test it, which Northrop has previously said will take place at some\nstage this year.\n\nWhile details on the overall dimensions of the prototype have not been made\npublic, Northrop describes it as an \"extra-large glider\" that draws\ninspiration from the \"graceful glide\" of the manta ray. In mimicking the shape\nand movement of the fish after which it's named, Northrop's drone features a\nlifting body that has sea glider-like properties, but is not a glider in the\ntrue sense of the term (i.e., it does not strictly employ variable-buoyancy\npropulsion alone instead of thrusters or propellers to move it forward).\n\nIn the video below, released by Northrop in 2022, we see computer-generated\nfootage of Manta Ray being propelled via four small propellers. Imagery of the\nfull-size testbed released by Northrop today also shows the presence of rear\npropellers, of which there appear to be two, rather than four.\n\nA rear propeller seen on the full-size Northrop testbed. Northrop Grumman\n\nIn line with DARPA's specifications for the project, Northrop Grumman's Manta\nRay prototype is designed for \"long-duration, long-range missions in ocean\nenvironments where humans can\u2019t go,\" the company states.\n\n\"[The] Manta Ray Project really came out of the need for understanding more\nabout the ocean environment and being able to have underwater vehicles that\nlast longer than the order of a couple of hours or a couple of days,\"\naccording to Manta Ray Program Manager Kyle Woerner. The stated goal of the\nproject is to develop \"an autonomous underwater vehicle that\u2019s out operating\non its own, harvesting energy and completing whatever mission it's been\ngiven.\" You can learn more about DARPA's aims on unleashing robotic undersea\nendurance through Manta Ray in the 13-minute episode of the Voices from DARPA\npodcast below.\n\nIn order to achieve this, Northrop's demonstration vehicle features \"energy-\nsaving technologies,\" the exact nature of which remain murky, allowing it to\nanchor on the seafloor and hibernate in a low-power state, Northrop claims.\n\nHowever, along with Seatrec, a renewable-energy company, Northrop has also\ndesigned energy-harvesting technology ostensibly capable of powering Manta Ray\nover near-unlimited distances and durations. While many UUVs are constrained\nby the amount of stored energy they can carry onboard, Northrop-Seatrec's\n\"Mission Unlimited Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) Station\" purports to\nsolve this issue. At present, the Mission Unlimited UUV Station \"currently\nexists as a paper concept only.\"\n\nAn earlier Artist\u2019s concept of Northrop Grumman\u2019s unmanned underwater vehicle,\nManta Ray. Northrop Grumman\n\nThe Mission Unlimited UUV Station combines Seatrec's Thermal Energy Pod, which\nextracts energy from the ocean's thermal gradient \u2014 meaning the difference in\ntemperature between warmer mixed water near the surface and colder water below\n\u2014 and converts it to electricity, with Northrop's invention of a self-\ninsulating, wet-mate electrical connector, enabling submerged underwater\nconnections.\n\nYou can learn more about how this works in the videos below.\n\nNorthrop also states that its connectors will not only allow for energy\ntransfer between the Mission Unlimited UUV Station and Manta Ray. Via \"data\nbubbles\" large volumes of information can theoretically be sent from the UUV\nto the Mission Unlimited UUV station and then onto a satellite or ship,\nfurther maximizing its ability to operate without human intervention.\n\n\"Data bubbles are tiny electronic devices that store data,\" Brian Theobald,\nchief engineer for Northrop's Manta Ray program, states. \"When released from\nthe station, they float to the surface and begin using their RF satellite\ncommunications antenna to transmit data to shore, to a satellite, or to a\nship.\"\n\nAccording to Northrop, the testbed is payload-capable in order to \"support a\nvariety of missions.\" The specific kinds of payloads it will boast remain\nunclear; however, DARPA specifies the need for a \"large payload capacity\" in\norder for different mission sets to be executed. The design certainly has\nlarge internal volume, and video of the concept shows it deploying a tethered\nvehicle of some kind. Using Manta Ray as a mothership for smaller UUVs would\nmake sense, but really it could conceivably carry many types of payloads,\nincluding direct weaponization via a warhead. But missions like undersea\nmapping, mine detection, and passive surveillance could all be of great use.\n\nThe level of autonomy such a vehicle would need to be operationally effective\nis quite advanced as the communications and command and control issues are\nmore challenging below the waves than above them. However, the infusion of AI\ninto automated piloting and autonomous mission systems is advancing extremely\nfast, and much of this work is going on in the classified domain for\nunderwater applications.\n\nHow exactly the full-size Manta Ray prototype is to be launched, particularly\nsince its size has not been specified, is unclear. It's possible that it could\nbe deployed via a pier or from a ship \u2014 perhaps a well deck of an amphibious\nassault ship could work too.\n\nNorthrop Grumman\n\nNorthrop does note that the entire system has been designed for \"easy shipment\nin five standard shipping containers to support expeditionary deployment and\nin-field assembly worldwide.\"\n\nWhether or not the Department of Defense ultimately ends up procuring\nNorthrop's offering, or some variant or derivative thereof, remains unclear.\nAt this stage, it is just a prototype, and Northrop is not the only company\ndeveloping a Manta Ray testbed. PacMar Technologies, formerly known as Martin\nDefense Group which was formerly known as Navatek, is developing a prototype\ntoo; a scaled version of which completed in-water tests \u201cto verify sensors,\nvehicle hydrodynamic performance, and key autonomy behaviors of the glider\nbody\u201d in September last year. Northrop, Navatek, and Lockheed Martin were\nawarded contracts to work on the Manta Ray program in 2020, of which only the\nformer two were selected to progress to the next stage in late 2021.\n\nFirst pier-side splash of the scaled Manta Ray vehicle developed by PacMar\nTechnologies. DARPA\n\nDARPA\n\nWhatever design, or technologies, DARPA ultimately picks, having a \"new class\"\nof UVV capable of carrying various payloads for long durations, and possibly\nblending in with sea life, will be of benefit to the Navy. More broadly, the\nservice is looking to field a wide range of UUVs of various tiers, with\n\"extra-large\" being the largest. The Navy has already received its first Orca\nextra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle, or XLUUV, from Boeing, which you can\nread more about here.\n\nPossessing various UUV tiers will no doubt be critical in any future maritime\nfight; and it's under the waves where new technologies such as Manta Ray could\nmake the biggest impact. This works both ways, too, with adversaries,\nespecially China, having invested heavily in uncrewed underwater vehicles.\n\nWith that said, we will be keeping our eyes peeled for our first glimpse of\nNorthrop's Manta Ray prototype amid testing in the near future.\n\nContact the author: oliver@thewarzone.com\n\nAmericasAround The GlobeNaviesU.S. HomelandU.S. NavyUnmanned Underwater\nVehicles (UUVs)Sea Air Space 2024\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
