Wahl/Released\n\nAfter decades of cutting back on shipbuilding, the United States Navy is\nattempting to get back up to speed.\n\nAmerica\u2019s remaining shipyards are floundering. China\u2019s shipbuilding advantage\nputs them leagues ahead of the United States in a potential conflict.\n\nA leaked slide U.S. Navy briefing slide reveals that China\u2019s shipbuilding\ncapacity is 232 times greater than the United States. Specifically, Chinese\nshipyards have a manufacturing capacity of roughly 23,250,000 million tons,\nwhereas U.S. shipyards have less than 100,000 tons. The authors of the\nbriefing slide predicted that by 2035, China will have amassed 475\nbattleships; the U.S. will have between 305 and 317.\n\nSlide leaked from the U.S. Navy and shared via The War Zone\n\nThe War Zone originally reported the data in July, after verifying the slide\u2019s\nauthenticity with the Office of Naval Intelligence. Though this information\nputs the state of America\u2019s shipbuilding capacity into stark relief, the\ndecline it documents has been underway for decades.\n\nAmerica reached the pinnacle of its shipbuilding history during WWII and\ncontinued to serve as the world\u2019s leading shipbuilder for decades thereafter.\nBut competition from subsidized foreign shipyards quickly eroded that lead,\nespecially after U.S. shipbuilding subsidies expired in 1981. Between 1987 and\n1992, the U.S. shipbuilding industry \u201csold only eight commercial ships over\n1,000 gross tons, compared to 77 ships annually in 1975,\u201d according to Navy\nanalysis shared in a 2015 Eno Center for Transportation study.\n\nThe War Zones notes that U.S. Navy has been working on reversing this trend:\n\n> \u201cAfter decades of cutting back on spending, the U.S. Navy has been trying to\n> explore ways to alleviate those issues, including by modernizing its own\n> remaining shipyards and expanding its use of commercial yards to conduct\n> various types of often sensitive work. Reflecting the trend of shipbuilding\n> capacity increasingly being found outside of the United States, the latter\n> category could eventually include more foreign-owned and operated yards,\n> including ones in Japan, too.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, as James Holmes highlights in a 19FortyFive opinion, America has\nnot only ceded its ability to build more ships, but also to repair them and\nmaintain its fleet. China\u2019s capacity here offers crucial military advantage.\n\nChina\u2019s huge shipbuilding advantage also carries over into commerce. Recently,\nThe New York Times reported that China\u2019s shipyards are working nonstop to\nbuild a fleet of ships capable of exporting the hulk of its auto overcapacity\nto the rest of the world.\n\nAmerican national security obviously suffers from the reduced strength of our\nnation\u2019s shipbuilding capacity, but so does its economic health. American\nshipyards provide valuable, middle-class jobs that generate further economic\nactivity. \u201c[E]very shipbuilding job is supported by or creates three other\njobs \u2013 e.g. the engineers designing the ship, the steel workers producing what\nwill become the ship\u2019s hull, the accountants tracking the project, etc.,\u201d the\nEno Center for Transportation finds.\n\nThere have been dire warnings about the diminishing strength of America\u2019s\nshipbuilding capacity for several years, but the need to restore our nation\u2019s\nlead is more critical than ever as tensions increase with China.\n\n### Subscribe\n\nLoading....\n\n### Recommended Posts\n\nJul 23 2019\n\n### New Legislation Aims to Revive America\u2019s Shockingly Small Shipbuilding\nIndustry\n\nMay 30 2018\n\n### This Bill Would Help U.S. Shipbuilding Set Sail\n\nMar 15 2021\n\n### Will 2021 Be the Year the United States Finally Sets Sail on Shipbuilding?\n\n  * Press\n  * Contact\n  * Jobs at AAM\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n#### Connect With Us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Youtube\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * RSS\n\n\u00a9 2020 Alliance for American Manufacturing\n\nMade in America\n\n", "frontpage": false}
