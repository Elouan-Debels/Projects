This so-called Higgs mechanism, which was proposed by\nseveral physicists besides Higgs at about the same time, predicts the\nexistence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, the detection of which became\none of the great goals of physics.^[10]^[11] On 4 July 2012, CERN announced\nthe discovery of the boson at the Large Hadron Collider.^[12] The Higgs\nmechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the Standard\nModel of particle physics, without which certain particles would have no\nmass.^[13]\n\nHiggs was honoured with a number of awards in recognition of his work,\nincluding the 1981 Hughes Medal from the Royal Society; the 1984 Rutherford\nMedal from the Institute of Physics; the 1997 Dirac Medal and Prize for\noutstanding contributions to theoretical physics from the Institute of\nPhysics; the 1997 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize by the European\nPhysical Society; the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics; the 2009 Oskar Klein\nMemorial Lecture medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; the 2010\nAmerican Physical Society J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle\nPhysics; and a unique Higgs Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in\n2012.^[14] The discovery of the Higgs boson prompted fellow physicist Stephen\nHawking to note that he thought that Higgs should receive the Nobel Prize in\nPhysics for his work,^[15]^[16] which he finally did, shared with Fran\u00e7ois\nEnglert in 2013.^[17] Higgs was appointed to the Order of the Companions of\nHonour in the 2013 New Year Honours^[18]^[19] and in 2015 the Royal Society\nawarded him the Copley Medal, the world's oldest scientific prize.^[20]\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\nHiggs was born in the Elswick district of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, to\nThomas Ware Higgs (1898\u20131962) and his wife Gertrude Maude n\u00e9e Coghill\n(1895\u20131969).^[14]^[21]^[22]^[23]^[24] His father worked as a sound engineer\nfor the BBC, and as a result of childhood asthma, together with the family\nmoving around because of his father's job and later World War II, Higgs missed\nsome early schooling and was taught at home. When his father relocated to\nBedford, Higgs stayed behind in Bristol with his mother, and was largely\nraised there. He attended Cotham Grammar School in Bristol from\n1941\u201346,^[14]^[25] where he was inspired by the work of one of the school's\nalumni, Paul Dirac, a founder of the field of quantum mechanics.^[23]\n\nIn 1946, at the age of 17, Higgs moved to City of London School, where he\nspecialised in mathematics, then in 1947 to King's College London where he\ngraduated with a first class honours degree in Physics in 1950 and achieved a\nmaster's degree in 1952. He was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the\nRoyal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,^[26] and performed his doctoral\nresearch in molecular physics under the supervision of Charles Coulson and\nChristopher Longuet-Higgins.^[1] He was awarded a PhD degree in 1954 with a\nthesis entitled Some problems in the theory of molecular vibrations from\nKing's College London.^[1]^[14]^[27]\n\n## Career and research[edit]\n\nAfter finishing his doctorate, Higgs was appointed a Senior Research Fellow at\nthe University of Edinburgh (1954\u201356). He then held various posts at Imperial\nCollege London, and University College London (where he also became a\ntemporary lecturer in Mathematics). He returned to the University of Edinburgh\nin 1960 to take up the post of Lecturer at the Tait Institute of Mathematical\nPhysics, allowing him to settle in the city he had enjoyed while hitchhiking\nto the Western Highlands as a student in 1949.^[28]^[29] He was promoted to\nReader, became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 1974 and\nwas promoted to a Personal Chair of Theoretical Physics in 1980. He retired in\n1996 and became Emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh.^[6]\n\nHiggs was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1983 and Fellow of the\nInstitute of Physics (FInstP) in 1991. He was awarded the Rutherford Medal and\nPrize in 1984. He received an honorary degree from the University of Bristol\nin 1997. In 2008 he received an Honorary Fellowship from Swansea University\nfor his work in particle physics.^[30]\n\nAt Edinburgh Higgs first became interested in mass, developing the idea that\nparticles \u2013 massless when the universe began \u2013 acquired mass a fraction of a\nsecond later as a result of interacting with a theoretical field (which became\nknown as the Higgs field). Higgs postulated that this field permeates space,\ngiving mass to all elementary subatomic particles that interact with\nit.^[23]^[31]\n\nThe Higgs mechanism postulates the existence of the Higgs field which confers\nmass on quarks and leptons.^[32] However this causes only a tiny portion of\nthe masses of other subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons. In\nthese, gluons that bind quarks together confer most of the particle mass.\n\nThe original basis of Higgs' work came from the Japanese-born theorist and\nNobel Prize laureate Yoichiro Nambu from the University of Chicago. Professor\nNambu had proposed a theory known as spontaneous symmetry breaking based on\nwhat was known to happen in superconductivity in condensed matter; however,\nthe theory predicted massless particles (the Goldstone's theorem), a clearly\nincorrect prediction.^[6]\n\nHiggs was reported to have developed the fundamentals of his theory after\nreturning to his Edinburgh New Town apartment from a failed weekend camping\ntrip to the Highlands.^[33]^[34]^[35] He stated that there was no \"eureka\nmoment\" in the development of the theory.^[36] He wrote a short paper\nexploiting a loophole in Goldstone's theorem (massless Goldstone particles\nneed not occur when local symmetry is spontaneously broken in a relativistic\ntheory^[37]) and published it in Physics Letters, a European physics journal\nedited at CERN, in Switzerland, in 1964.^[38]\n\nHiggs wrote a second paper describing a theoretical model (now called the\nHiggs mechanism), but the paper was rejected (the editors of Physics Letters\njudged it \"of no obvious relevance to physics\").^[23] Higgs wrote an extra\nparagraph and sent his paper to Physical Review Letters, another leading\nphysics journal, which published it later in 1964. This paper predicted a new\nmassive spin-zero boson (now known as the Higgs boson).^[37]^[39] Other\nphysicists, Robert Brout and Fran\u00e7ois Englert^[40] and Gerald Guralnik, C. R.\nHagen and Tom Kibble^[41] had reached similar conclusions about the same time.\nIn the published version Higgs quotes Brout and Englert and the third paper\nquotes the previous ones. The three papers written on this boson discovery by\nHiggs, Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble, Brout, and Englert were each recognised as\nmilestone papers by Physical Review Letters 50th anniversary celebration.^[42]\nWhile each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions\nand differences between the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers are noteworthy.\nThe mechanism had been proposed in 1962 by Philip Anderson although he did not\ninclude a crucial relativistic model.^[37]^[43]\n\nOn 4 July 2012, CERN announced the ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)\nexperiments had seen strong indications for the presence of a new particle,\nwhich could be the Higgs boson, in the mass region around 126\ngigaelectronvolts (GeV).^[44] Speaking at the seminar in Geneva, Higgs\ncommented \"It's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my\nlifetime.\"^[12] Ironically, this probable confirmation of the Higgs boson was\nmade at the same place where the editor of Physics Letters rejected Higgs'\npaper.^[6]\n\n## Awards and honours[edit]\n\nHiggs has received numerous accolades including:\n\n### Civic awards[edit]\n\nEdinburgh Award handprints\n\nHiggs was the recipient of the Edinburgh Award for 2011. He is the fifth\nperson to receive the Award, which was established in 2007 by the City of\nEdinburgh Council to honour an outstanding individual who has made a positive\nimpact on the city and gained national and international recognition for\nEdinburgh.^[45]\n\nHiggs was presented with an engraved loving cup by the Rt Hon George Grubb,\nLord Provost of Edinburgh, in a ceremony held at the City Chambers on Friday\n24 February 2012. The event also marked the unveiling of his handprints in the\nCity Chambers quadrangle, where they had been engraved in Caithness stone\nalongside those of previous Edinburgh Award recipients.^[46]^[47]^[48]\n\nHiggs was awarded with the Freedom of the City of Bristol in July 2013.^[49]\nIn April 2014, he was also awarded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon\nTyne. He was also honoured with a brass plaque installed on the Newcastle\nQuayside as part of the Newcastle Gateshead Initiative Local Heroes Walk of\nFame.\n\n### Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics[edit]\n\nOn 6 July 2012, Edinburgh University announced a new centre named after\nProfessor Higgs to support future research in theoretical physics. The Higgs\nCentre for Theoretical Physics brings together scientists from around the\nworld to seek \"a deeper understanding of how the universe works\".^[50] The\ncentre is currently based within the James Clerk Maxwell Building, home of the\nUniversity's School of Physics and Astronomy and the iGEM 2015 team\n(ClassAfiED). The university has also established a chair of theoretical\nphysics in the name of Peter Higgs.^[51]^[52]\n\n### Nobel Prize in Physics[edit]\n\nOn 8 October 2013, it was announced that Higgs and Fran\u00e7ois Englert would\nshare the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the theoretical discovery of a\nmechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of\nsubatomic particles\", and which recently was confirmed through the discovery\nof the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at\nCERN's Large Hadron Collider\".^[53] Higgs admits he had gone out to avoid the\nmedia attention^[54] so he was informed he had been awarded the prize by an\nex-neighbour on his way home, since he did not have a mobile phone.^[55]^[56]\n\n### Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour[edit]\n\nHiggs turned down a knighthood in 1999, but in 2012 he accepted membership of\nthe Order of the Companions of Honour.^[57]^[58] He later said that he only\naccepted the order because he was wrongly assured that the award was the gift\nof the Queen alone. He also expressed cynicism towards the honours system, and\nthe way the system \"is used for political purposes by the government in\npower\". The order confers no title or precedence, but recipients of the order\nare entitled to use the post-nominal letters CH. In the same interview he also\nstated that when people ask what the CH after his name stands for, he replies\n\"it means I'm an honorary Swiss.\"^[59] He received the order from the Queen at\nan investiture at Holyrood House on 1 July 2014.^[60]\n\n### Honorary Degrees[edit]\n\nHiggs was awarded honorary degrees from the following institutions:\n\n  * DSc University of Bristol 1997^[61]\n  * DSc University of Edinburgh 1998^[61]\n  * DSc University of Glasgow 2002^[61]\n  * DSc Swansea University 2008^[61]\n  * DSc King's College London 2009^[61]\n  * DSc University College London 2010^[61]\n  * DSc University of Cambridge 2012^[61]\n  * DSc Heriot-Watt University 2012^[61]\n  * PhD SISSA, Trieste 2013^[61]\n  * DSc University of Durham 2013^[61]\n  * DSc University of Manchester 2013^[61]\n  * DSc University of St Andrews 2014^[61]\n  * DSc Free University of Brussels (ULB) 2014^[61]\n  * DSc University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 2015^[61]\n  * DSc Queen's University Belfast 2015^[61]\n  * ScD Trinity College Dublin 2016^[61]\n\nA portrait of Higgs was painted by Ken Currie in 2008.^[62] Commissioned by\nthe University of Edinburgh,^[63] it was unveiled on 3 April 2009^[64] and\nhangs in the entrance of the James Clerk Maxwell Building of the School of\nPhysics and Astronomy and the School of Mathematics.^[62] A large portrait by\nLucinda Mackay is in the collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery\nin Edinburgh. Another portrait of Higgs by the same artist hangs in the\nbirthplace of James Clerk Maxwell in Edinburgh, Higgs is the Honorary Patron\nof the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation. A portrait by Victoria Crowe was\ncommissioned by the Royal Society of Edinburgh and unveiled in 2013.^[65]\n\n## Personal life and political views[edit]\n\nHiggs married Jody Williamson, a fellow activist with the Campaign for Nuclear\nDisarmament (CND) in 1963. Their first son was born in August 1965.^[66]\nHiggs's family includes two sons: Chris, a computer scientist, and Jonny, a\njazz musician.^[67] He had two grandchildren. The entire family lived in\nEdinburgh.^[47]\n\nHiggs was an activist in the CND while in London and later in Edinburgh, but\nresigned his membership when the group extended its remit from campaigning\nagainst nuclear weapons to campaigning against nuclear power too.^[23]^[68] He\nwas a Greenpeace member until the group opposed genetically modified\norganisms.^[68]\n\nHiggs was awarded the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics (sharing it with Robert Brout\nand Fran\u00e7ois Englert), but he refused to fly to Jerusalem to receive the award\nbecause it was a state occasion attended by the then president of Israel,\nMoshe Katsav, and Higgs was opposed to Israel's actions in Palestine.^[69]\n\nHiggs was actively involved in the Edinburgh University branch of the\nAssociation of University Teachers, through which he agitated for greater\nstaff involvement in the management of the physics department.^[59]\n\nHiggs was an atheist.^[70] He described Richard Dawkins as having adopted a\n\"fundamentalist\" view of non-atheists.^[71] Higgs expressed displeasure with\nthe nickname the \"God particle\".^[72] Although it has been reported that he\nbelieved the term \"might offend people who are religious\",^[67] Higgs stated\nthat this is not the case, lamenting the letters he has received which claim\nthe God particle was predicted in the Torah, the Qur'an and Buddhist\nscriptures. In a 2013 interview with Decca Aitkenhead, Higgs was quoted as\nsaying:^[73]\n\n> I'm not a believer. Some people get confused between the science and the\n> theology. They claim that what happened at Cern proves the existence of God.\n> The church in Spain has also been guilty of using that name as evidence for\n> what they want to prove. [It] reinforces confused thinking in the heads of\n> people who are already thinking in a confused way. If they believe that\n> story about creation in seven days, are they being intelligent?\n>\n> \u2014 The Guardian, 6 December 2013\n\nUsually this nickname for the Higgs boson is attributed to Leon Lederman, the\nauthor of the book The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is\nthe Question?, but the name is the result of the suggestion of Lederman's\npublisher: Lederman had originally intended to refer to it as the \"goddamn\nparticle\".^[74]\n\nHiggs died after a short illness at home in Edinburgh on 8 April 2024, at the\nage of 94.^[75]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Higgs, Peter Ware (1954).
