Rum and gin were staples on-board Royal Navy\nships. Today, computerised warfare has dramatically reduced onboard liquor\nconsumption but it remains common to see brands of rum and gin labelled \"Navy\nStrength\". But what is Navy Strength? And what is the difference between this\nand \"Overproof\"?\n\nPrior to 1816, there was no accurate way to measure the strength of a spirit,\nso pursers in the British navy (then known as pussers) would test the\nalcoholic strength of their rum ration by using a rule-of-thumb method: a few\ngrains of gunpowder were added to pure rum and the mixture heated by\nconcentrating the heat of the sun's rays through a magnifying glass. If the\nmixture just ignited it was proof. Too weak and it would fail to light. If it\nwas overproof then it would go up with a bang.\n\nEnsuring the high strength of the alcohol not only protected the navy from\nbeing overcharged for watered-down rum but also ensured rum-soaked gunpowder\nremained explosive. This was crucial as casks of rum and gunpowder were stored\nin close proximity, so should stormy seas or extremes of battle cause one or\nmore of the many casks of rum on board to spill their contents and drench\nnearby gunpowder, then, so long as the rum was overproof its fire-power would\nbe unaffected.\n\n## Navy Strength and Proof (and so overproof) defined\n\nIn 1816, proof became more closely defined when Bartholomew Sikes invented an\naccurate hydrometer, which measured 100 proof at just over 57% alcohol by\nvolume (57.142857% to be exact). Sikes' new scale was adopted in law in 1818\nand it defined a 100-proof spirit as 4/7 the alcohol purity by volume. Or to\nput it another way, to convert the percentage of alcohol by volume (alc./vol.)\nto degrees proof spirit, multiply the percentage by 7/4, or 1.75.\n\nHowever, the Navy had other ideas and, after Sikes' hydrometer was invented,\nconducted its own tests to establish the strength their rum should be issued\nat. They collected 100 samples of rum diluted to proof using the old gunpowder\ntest and then measured the proof of each sample using one of the new\nhydrometers. The average was 95.5 on the Sikes scale, which equated to 54.5%\nalc./vol., thus this strength was adopted as standard Navy Strength.\n\nThis measure stayed in place until 1 January 1980, when the United Kingdom\nadopted the alc./vol. standard to measure alcohol content, as prescribed by\nthe European Union, (according to the recommendation of the International\nOrganization of Legal Metrology) measuring alcohol strength as a percentage of\nalcohol by volume at a temperature of 20\u00b0C. The law was itself essentially a\ndirect manifestation of the Gay-Lussac scale, which measures ethanol as a\npercentage - rather than in degrees - of total volume.\n\nSo the true British Navy Strength is 54.5% alc./vol. and those brands of\nspirits labelled as \"Navy Strength\" but at the higher 57% alc./vol. strength\nhave confused English Proof with Navy Strength, but at least their gun powder\nwill safely ignite.\n\nConfusingly, rum, or indeed any other spirit, can also be considered\n\"overproof\" at pretty much any strength above 50% alc./vol.. e.g. Wray &\nNephew, the best-known brand of white overproof rum is 63% alc./vol.. This is\ndue to the United States system where proof is twice the percentage of\nalc./vol. (double the percentage of alcohol contained in a solution at 60\u00b0F or\n15.6\u00b0C). Hence 50% alc./vol. equates to a 100\u00b0 proof spirit and Wray & Nephew,\nat 63% alc./vol., is 126\u00b0 proof.\n\nPure Alcohol equals: Alcohol by Volume Gay-Lussac (alc./vol.) = 100% alc./vol.\nBritish proof Sikes Scale (\u00b0) = 175 alc./vol. US Proof (\u00b0) = 200 alc./vol.\n\nAlso see Navy rum: The story of the admiralty blend and its rationing...\n\n  * Home\n  * Beer, Wine & Spirits\n  * Overproof & Navy Strength\n\nSubscribe\n\n### Join the Discussion\n\nShowing 4 of 4 comment(s) for Overproof & Navy Strength\n\nSee discussion in the Forum\n\nYou must log in to your account to make a comment.\n\n  1.

That is\nthe ABV is on Smith & Cross, which is touted as \"Navy Strenght\" on their\nbottle. So that is actually \"English Proof\"?\n\n1Reply\n\n!
