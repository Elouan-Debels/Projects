Or follow us on\nGoogle News!\n\nEveryone pretty much agrees the US electrical grid will need modernizing as\nthe demand for electrons to power EVs, green steel, data centers, and heat\npumps increases. We also know that building new transmission lines is a long\nand expensive process fraught with obstacles ranging from permitting to supply\nchains. There is an old expression that says, \u201cDon\u2019t raise the bridge, lower\nthe river.\u201d There are new technologies available that may allow the existing\ngrid to carry more electricity without all those messy policy hurdles to jump\nover.\n\nOne of them is the so-called \u201cmagic ball\u201d from Norway\u2019s Heimdall, a bowling\nball-sized device that fits around HVDC lines to measure their temperature.\nCooler wires can carry more electrons, but most transmission line operators\nhave no ability to know the actual temperature of their wires, so they guess.\nNot surprisingly when talking about infrastructure worth billions of dollars,\nthose guesses tend to be on the low side.\n\nCourtesy of Heimdall Power\n\nBy knowing the precise temperature of the transmission wires, grid operators\nknow how close a particular line is to its maximum capacity. \u201cThink about the\ntemperature on the line as being the speed limit,\u201d J\u00f8rgen Festervoll, CEO of\nHeimdall, told Inside Climate News. \u201cWithout the software and sensor, like the\nones Heimdall Power provides, you\u2019re driving without a speedometer.\u201d By\nknowing exactly how much power a line can handle, a grid operator can increase\nthe flow of power for hours or even days without exceeding the capacity of a\ntransmission line. Same line, more electricity transmitted, more revenue for\ngrid operators, and more clean electricity from renewable energy resources,\nWhat a sweet deal!\n\n### Reconductoring & The US Grid\n\nThere is another new technology available that can also dramatically increase\nthe capacity of the HVDC transmission lines that are the backbone of the\nelectrical grid. Replacing existing power lines with cables made from advanced\nmaterials could nearly double the capacity of the electric grid in many parts\nof the country, making room for much more wind and solar power. The technique\nis known as \u201cadvanced reconductoring\u201d and is widely used in other countries.\nBut many US utilities have been slow to embrace it because of their\nunfamiliarity with the technology as well as regulatory and bureaucratic\nhurdles, according to new research.\n\nToday in the US, most power lines consist of steel cores surrounded by strands\nof aluminum, a design that has been used for a century. Twenty years ago,\nseveral companies developed cables that used smaller, lighter cores such as\ncarbon fiber that could hold more aluminum. These advanced cables can carry up\nto twice as much current as older wires.\n\nImage credit: GridLab\n\nReconductoring transmission lines could add about 64 TW-miles of new inter-\nzonal transmission capacity by 2035, compared to about 16 TW-miles from only\nbuilding new transmission lines, the Berkeley research suggests. \u201cWe were\npretty astonished by how big of an increase in capacity you can get by\nreconductoring,\u201d Amol Phadke, a senior scientist at Berkeley, told the New\nYork Times. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only thing we need to do to upgrade the grid, but it\ncan be a major part of the solution.\u201d\n\nReplacing old lines with advanced conductors usually costs half as much as\nbuilding new lines, partly because it uses existing infrastructure, according\nto Utility Dive. The additional inter-zonal transmission capacity unlocked\nwith advanced conductors will provide access to lower cost clean energy,\nreducing wholesale electricity costs by 3% to 4% on average. That amounts to\n$85 billion in system cost savings by 2035 and $180 billion by 2050, compared\nto business as usual. The additional transmission capacity from reconductoring\nwould allow the United States to get 90% of its electricity from emissions-\nfree power sources by 2035, according to the report.\n\nReplacing old lines can be done relatively quickly. In 2011, AEP, a utility in\nTexas, urgently needed to deliver more power to the Lower Rio Grande Valley to\nmeet soaring population growth. It would have taken too long to acquire land\nand permits and to build towers for a new transmission line. Instead, AEP\nreplaced 240 miles of wires on an existing line with advanced conductors,\nwhich took less than three years and increased the carrying capacity of the\nlines by 40%.\n\n### Making Room For More Wind & Solar On The Grid\n\nImage credit: GridLab\n\nIf utilities began deploying advanced conductors on a nationwide scale by\nreplacing thousands of miles of wires, they could add four times as much\ntransmission capacity by 2035 as they are currently on pace to do. That, in\nturn, would allow the use of much more solar and wind power from thousands of\nprojects that have been proposed but can\u2019t move forward because local grids\nare too clogged to accommodate them.\n\nThe sluggish build-out of the electric grid is the Achilles\u2019 heel of the\ntransition to cleaner energy in the opinion of many industry professionals.\nThe Energy Department estimates that the nation\u2019s network of transmission\nlines may need to expand by two-thirds or more by 2035 to meet President\nBiden\u2019s goals to power the country with clean energy. But building new\ntransmission lines can take a decade or more for developers to site a new line\nthrough multiple counties, receive permission from a patchwork of different\nagencies, and address lawsuits about spoiled views or damage to ecosystems.\nLast year, the United States added just 251 miles of high voltage transmission\nlines to the electrical grid. That number has been declining every year for\nthe past decade.\n\nIn 2022, Congress approved the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes billions\nof dollars available for solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and\nother non-polluting technologies. But if the United States can\u2019t add new\ntransmission capacity more quickly, roughly half the emission reductions\nexpected from that law may not materialize, researchers at the Princeton-led\nREPEAT Project found.\n\n### European Countries Are Leading The Way\n\nCountries like Belgium and the Netherlands have been deploying advanced\nconductors in order to integrate more wind and solar power into their grid\ninfrastructure, said Emilia Chojkiewi, one of the authors of the Berkeley\nreport. \u201cWe talked with the transmission system planners over there and they\nall said this is a no-brainer. It\u2019s often difficult to get new rights of way\nfor lines and reconductoring is much faster.\u201d\n\nOne of the questions addressed by researchers at GridLab is, if reconductoring\nis so effective, why don\u2019t more utilities in the United States do it? The\nanswer is partially that the fragmented nature of America\u2019s electrical grid\nsystem is a huge hurdle. It is actually three grids operated by 3,200\ndifferent utilities and a complex patchwork of regional planners and\nregulators. That means new technologies \u2014 which require careful study and\nworker retraining \u2014 sometimes spread more slowly than they do in countries\nwith just a handful of grid operators.\n\nThere are also mismatched incentives. Because of how utilities are\ncompensated, they often have more financial incentive to build new lines\nrather than upgrade existing equipment. Conversely, some regulators are wary\nof the higher upfront cost of advanced conductors, even if they pay for\nthemselves over the long run. Many utilities also have little motivation to\ncooperate with one another on long term transmission planning. \u201cThe biggest\nbarrier is that the industry and regulators are still caught in a short-term,\nreactive mind set,\u201d said Casey Baker, a senior program manager at GridLab.\n\u201cBut now we\u2019re in an era where we need the grid to grow very quickly, and our\nexisting processes haven\u2019t caught up with that reality.\u201d\n\n### Change Is In The Air\n\nThings may be starting to change. In Montana, Northwestern Energy recently\nreplaced part of an aging line with advanced conductors to reduce wildfire\nrisk. The new line sagged less in the heat, making it less likely to make\ncontact with trees. Pleased with the results, Montana legislators passed a\nbill that would give utilities financial incentives to install advanced\nconductors. A bill in Virginia would require utilities to consider the\ntechnology.\n\nWith electricity demand beginning to surge for the first time in two decades\nbecause of new data centers, factories and electric vehicles, many utilities\nare getting over their wariness about new technologies. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot\nmore interest in grid-enhancing technologies, whether it\u2019s reconductoring or\nother options,\u201d said Pedro Pizarro, the president and chief of executive of\nEdison International, a California power company, and the chairman of the\nEdison Electric Institute, a utility trade organization. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of\nurgency.\u201d\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nCleanTechnica readers, who are all above average and particularly astute, will\nspot the elephant in the room here right away. The Biden administration can\npour all the billions it wants into clean energy technology and manufacturing,\nbut until utility companies and grid operators have a financial incentive to\ncooperate to make the grid in America function efficiently and at peak\ncapacity, all that lovely clean energy will never get to where it is needed.\nThis is not a technological barrier, it is an economic barrier that ultimately\nleads back to a welter of conflicting policies.\n\nIt would be wonderful if we had unlimited time to sort this all out, but we\ndon\u2019t. The destruction of the environment from extracting and burning fossil\nfuels is accelerating. We don\u2019t have time to waste on silly games and\ninternecine rivalries between those who design, build, and operate the grid.\nWe have to do better and we have to do it soon.
