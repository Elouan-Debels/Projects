But that may be what's coming.\n\nUnlike the autonomous vacuum, which uses sensors to roam around your house\nlooking for carpet dirt, Detroit\u2019s first high-tech cleaning machine \u2014 dubbed\nthe BeBot, short for beach robot \u2014 is operated by a human with a remote\ncontrol and video-game dexterity.\n\n\"This is definitely a step in the direction of continuing the notion that\nDetroit is a hub for innovation and technology,\" Konner Petz, a senior\nmobility strategist for the city, told the Free Press. \"It\u2019s not just about\nmobility in the automobile industry, and well will continue to introduce\ntechnologies similar to BeBot.\"\n\nIn the last few years, communities nationwide \u2014 from Florida to California \u2014\nhave been deploying the beachcombing BeBot and other technology, such as\nrobotic police dogs in Taylor, and artificial intelligence facial recognition,\nwith the hope of doing jobs that might be unsafe or more difficult for humans.\n\nAt the same time, the advancing tech is likely to create challenges, many of\nwhich may be unforeseen.\n\nPetz said the next generation of the BeBot \u2014 if this version is successful \u2014\ncould move entirely on its own.\n\nIn addition to the city and the Belle Isle Conservancy, the project is\nsupported by several groups, including Michigan's Department of Natural\nResources, the Council of the Great Lakes Region Foundation, the Clorox Co.,\nand Meijer.\n\n## BeBots comb beaches nationwide\n\nIn Detroit, the BeBot is set to be deployed on the beach with a mission to\nsift through sand and suck up large and small bits of litter, including\nbottles, wrappers, and cigarette butts, that may have become buried and are\npolluting the environment.\n\nThe beachcombing robot \u2014 which project leaders are considering giving its own\nname \u2014 is expected to debut to the news media on April 22, Earth Day, and then\nto the public by operating alongside cleanup volunteers in early June.\n\nIn Lake Tahoe, California, and Carolina Beach, North Carolina, where groups\nhave been using the robot, reports say the BeBot has been effective.\n\nAnd beach communities in Pinellas County, Florida, which depend on tourism,\nrolled out the BeBot two years ago. It has been working to help keep their\nsugar-white beaches pristine, an expectation of visitors seeking to escape the\nsnow an ice, and a requirement to protect sea life.\n\nThe BeBot \u2014 developed by a French company, Poralu Marne \u2014 is about the size of\na riding mower and weighs about 1,300 pounds. It is battery and solar-powered,\nusing treads \u2014 like a tank \u2014 to make its way through the spongy terrain.\n\nIt also has headlights, although, project officials say they don't anticipate\nusing it at night.\n\nIn an hour, the company said, it can clean 32,000 square feet, about the area\nof seven basketball courts.\n\nThe BeBot cost, project officials in Detroit said, is an estimated\n$80,000-$90,000, a little more than the average price of a luxury car, and the\nmoney to buy it came from a one-time $150,000 grant from Oakland, California-\nbased Clorox Co.\n\n\"Preserving and protecting our natural environment is a complex challenge that\nwe can\u2019t tackle alone,\" Niki King, Clorox\u2019s vice president of sustainability\nsaid. \"It\u2019s imperative to work with partners that share our goal of creating a\ncleaner world.\"\n\n## What the project may reveal\n\nBelle Isle, project officials said, is a good area to try out the BeBot, and\nthere's much to learn about how the technology could affect \u2014 and change \u2015 the\narea and human behavior in obvious and, perhaps, unintended ways.\n\nNot only is the beach there a tourist spot, but the Detroit River is also an\ninternational channel.\n\nMark Fisher, the president and CEO of the Council of the Great Lakes Region,\nadded that keeping the area\u2019s beaches and waterways clean benefits the area,\nand the river \"serves a vital economic and ecological corridor between the\nUnited States and Canada.\"\n\nProject officials said the BeBot has been tested on Great Lakes beaches in\nMichigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and will help collect data for researchers on\nthe trash it finds, but there is still more to learn about how well it will\nwork on the Detroit River island, which is bigger and older than New York's\nCentral Park.\n\nA recent test drive on the Belle Isle beach, Petz said, revealed some\nchallenges operating in wet sand.\n\nGenevieve Rattray, the director of sustainability and advocacy for the Belle\nIsle Conservancy, who tried her hand at operating the BeBot said the robot\nwon't replace the need for people to pick up after themselves \u2014 or help with\ncleanups, but it has a role to play\n\n\"We have an incredible community of volunteers who like to come out and take\ncare of our parks,\" she said, adding that the conservation groups will still\nneed people to survey and categorize the debris for research. \"I think what\nthis does is reach a lot of areas that are more difficult for humans to get.\"\n\n## Potential concerns, some unforeseen\n\nAt the same time, advanced technology is constantly creating new concerns and\nproblems.\n\nIn the past few years, Detroit has adopted facial recognition software to help\nfight crime, but while some have praised its benefits, others have pointed out\nits flaws. Last year, a lawsuit claimed the Detroit Police Department wrongly\naccused and arrested a pregnant woman based on a faulty match.\n\nThe arrest, the American Civil Liberties Union said at the time, was the third\nknown allegation of a wrongful arrest by the Detroit Police Department based\non reliance on a false facial recognition match in three years, and prompted\npolice police changes.\n\nMoreover, there are even broader concerns about how the Michigan State Police\nmay be using data shared on more than 100 social media and internet platforms,\nfrom Facebook to TikTok and from mega-retailer Amazon to WhatsApp.\n\nWhat problems \u2014 if any \u2014 might come from robot beachcombers is not yet known.\n\nHowever, project technology experts are optimistic any issues that arise will\nbe resolved.\n\nThere already are plans to add another robot, known as a PixieDrone, which\nalso would be remotely operated, to go beyond the shoreline. The PixieDrone\nwould float on the Detroit River and other waterways, gathering up trash and\ndebris.\n\nInformation on Belle Isle volunteer cleanups can be found at\nhttps://www.belleisleconservancy.org/cleanup.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.\n\nSMS Facebook Twitter Email\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Subscription Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Site Map\n  * Accessibility\n  * Our Ethical Principles\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024\n\n## About Your Privacy\n\nClicking on the \"Reject All\" Button retains the default setting of only\nstrictly necessary cookies.\n\nWe and our 64 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
