Putting\npeoples\u2019 lives at risk and potentially destroying complex and expensive\nvehicles paid for by the US taxpayers was a daily possibility for every\ndecision made. Sometimes the consequences were only clear in hindsight.\n\nFifteen years in the NASA Space Shuttle Flight Director\u2019s office, I supported\nmissions during the on-orbit phases which was always fun, sometimes\nfrustrating, but only rarely worrisome.\n\nPrior to launch, during the countdown, all the problems really belonged to the\nFiring Room team and the Launch Director down in Florida. They had to prep the\nvehicle and make sure every little piece was working as it should or the\nsystem would scrub for the day. I had only to think about the weather at the\nabort landing sites \u2013 an interesting problem but almost always clear cut: Go\nor No-Go.\n\nTo prepare for the flying part of a shuttle launches, my team and I practiced\nvery hard. The training team would throw problem after problem into every\nlaunch simulation. (See my earlier post \u2018Nexus of Evil\u2019\nhttps://blogs.nasa.gov/waynehalesblog/2010/02/16/post_1266353065166/). When we\ncould proficiently handle each individual problem, the trainers would throw in\ncombinations of problems, more and more and more. Until we cried \u2018uncle\u2019 and\npast that. Until we could respond almost automatically to any number of\ncombinations of multiple situations. Frequently the training days ended with\nsweat and pounding hearts as if we had been at the gym instead of sitting\ncomfortably under the air conditioning; the work was mental and sometimes\npsychological.\n\nDuring the launch phase (a bare 8 1\u20442 minutes) there was precious little time\nto think, the responses had to be conditioned in, automatic almost. In the\nend, every one of \u2018my\u2019 launches in reality was uneventful with no significant\nproblems. At the end of a real flight day, I sometimes felt that our training\nhad been wasted. But we were prepared.\n\nOn the other hand, being the Flight Director for the Entry phase of a Space\nShuttle flight was the most nerve-wracking job that I ever had. Takeoffs are\noptional, landings are mandatory. With the shuttle in flight entry and landing\nwas inevitable. Planning and evaluation of potential opportunities, starting\nbefore flight, went on the entire mission. While the three-team rotation of\non-orbit flight controllers worked to make sure that the payloads were\ndeployed, the science experiments were performed, etc., etc., the Entry team\nand its Flight director would come into MCC every day to plan, evaluate,\ndiscuss, and digest all the possibilities.\n\nEvaluate the situation if anything on the orbiter was broken \u2013 rarely. Talk\nwith the landing site folks at the primary and backup sites to gauge the\nreadiness of equipment and personnel at the runways \u2013 regularly. Spend a lot\nof time in the weather office looking at forecasts \u2013 always. Did you know that\nmeteorology is an inexact science? We had the best forecasters in the world,\nbut when the landing was more than a few days away pondering forecasts was an\nexercise in futility \u2013 they always changed.\n\nAs the day of landing grew closer, the forecasts were scrutinized to an\nincreasingly minute degree. All the senior NASA management felt that they were\namateur meteorologist and felt free to provide opinions. But only one person\nhad to make the decision. Pressure grew daily. A lot of time was spent at the\ncoffee pot in the hallway outside mission control debating the options with\nvarious astronauts, managers, schedulers, and other interested parties.\n\nAbout 3 days before landing, we had to commit to send the convoy team to one\nof the three sites in the US we guessed to be best. If Florida, we could use\nthe Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center with its single long\nrunway. If California, the Edwards AFB/Dryden Flight Research Center where\nthey similarly had a single long paved runway but many other options on\nRoger\u2019s dry lakebed. The least used option was New Mexico with the hard-as-\nconcrete gypsum dry lakebed runways at White Sands Space Harbor aka Northrop\nstrip. We only landing a shuttle at WSSH once and it was always the lowest\npriority in our thinking, fewest number of personnel, least facilities.\n\nEdwards, like the SLF, had one concrete runway that was twice as wide as any\nnormal big airport featured, twice as long as the typical airport runway, and\nspecially constructed to bear the weight of extremely heavy aircraft landings.\nBut the concrete runways were singletons: they pointed one direction. The\nproblem was that winds could come from any direction; not just straight down\nthe runway but across it. A crosswind could sometimes exceed the maximum\nallowable for the shuttle: 12 (later 15) knots (nautical miles per hour).\nWithout a runway in a different direction, well, the landing site was\nunusable. At the SLF, surrounded by the swamp, you had to have the winds just\nright.\n\nEdwards famously had Rogers Dry Lakebed. The Air Force annually scribed out a\nlarge number of \u2018runways\u2019 on the hard surface of the lakebed. They \u2018painted\u2019\nwith asphalt side stripes, threshold markings, and \u2013 for the shuttle \u2013\naimpoint markings. To be considered for a normal landing (not emergency) we\nalso required various indicator lights to be set up on a runway and, for the\nbest change at landing, microwave beam scanning landing system (MSBLS) huts\nthat gave precise angle information to an approaching shuttle. Unfortunately,\nat Edwards, there were far more runway options than we had equipment.\nGenerally, only a couple of the lakebed runways were \u2018instrumented\u2019 which put\nthem on the candidate list for places to land.\n\nOh, and just one more thing. Rogers Dry Lake sometimes was not dry. In most\nwinters the rains filled the lake, not very deep, but enough. When wet \u2013 or\neven damp \u2013 the lakebed surface was too soft to land a shuttle. The tires\nwould dig in, perhaps snap off, maybe make the vehicle tumble. So, among the\ncriterion for using runways on the lakebed, the first was they had to be dry\nand hard. The Air force provided us with the services of their geologist who\nuse various instruments to test the load bearing characteristics of the\nlakebed.\n\nWho would have thought?\n\nRunways are designated by the compass direction they point: for example,\nrunway 33/15 runs northwest to southeast. An aircraft on the runway would show\nits compass heading as 330 degrees (northwest) or if pointed the other way at\n150 degrees (southeast).\n\nSTS-37 flew in early April 1991 and Rogers Lakebed was just drying out. Since\nthe prevailing winds in California blew from west to east, the waters had been\npushed to the eastern side of the lakebed and the western side started drying\nout earlier. We had some confidence that the most western of the lakebed\nrunways 33/15 might be usable, but the geologist had to do his testing.\n\nJust as an additional consideration, the shuttle program had never used\nlakebed runway 33/15. The pilot astronauts took turns in the Shuttle Training\nAircraft \u2013 which flew the final approach like an orbiter \u2013 and spend many\nhours \u2013 days \u2013 weeks \u2013 practicing landing at the runways likely to be used.\nEdwards 33/15 was never on the list. Nobody had ever trained to land on that\nrunway. Think about that as a potential problem. It was not shown in the\nFlight Maps and Charts book that the commander on orbit could consult and\nbecome familiar with.\n\nAs the day of landing approached, it was clear that weather was going to be a\nproblem, as usual. KSC had No-Go forecasts of rain, low clouds, and wind for\nseveral days in a row. This forecast turned out to be accurate. WSSH similarly\nhad unacceptable landing weather. Edwards looked really with clear skies and\nno thunderstorms or rain of any kind in the forecast. But strong north winds\nblew almost directly across the concrete runway situated east-west (22/04),\nfar exceeding the crosswind limit. Only the lakebed runway 33/15 pointed in\nthe right direction, if it was dry and hard enough to use.\n\nThe first or normally planned landing day, when we could not consider using\nthe lakebed runways, I had to make the call to wave off for 24 hours \u2013 it was\njust too bad everywhere. This was not a hard call. Its easy when its clear;\nthe hard part comes when its marginal. Crews generally appreciated a wave off\nif it was called early \u2013 they got a day in orbit to rest from a hard paced\nmission, look out the windows and take pictures, and generally enjoy being in\nspace.\n\nThere were limits on how long the Space Shuttle could stay in orbit: oxygen,\nwater, food, and the Lithium Hydroxide canisters which removed Carbon Dioxide\nfrom the air: all were limited and being used at a substantial rate. We needed\nto land soon.\n\nOn the +1 day as we called it, the stakes were higher.\n\nDuring the wave off day, the geologist completed his evaluation and reported\nthat the 33/15 runway was hard enough to bear the weight of a shuttle landing.\nThe ground crews scrambled to move approach lights and other navigational aids\n\u2013 but not the MSBLS \u2013 to the end of the runway we might use: the southern end\nwhich would put the wind right on Atlantis\u2019 nose. They were NOT able to\nrespray the asphalt markings. Those markings, vital cues for a pilot to make a\ngood landing, had been dimmed by the winter rains. We sent a seasoned\nastronaut commander to fly the STA and evaluate \u2013 all in all the 33-runway was\ndeemed acceptable.\n\nRemember, we had never used runway 33 before. And, as it turned out, never\nwould again.\n\nNo pressure on the Flight Director. No sirree, no pressure. Never let them see\nyou sweat.\n\nOn deorbit day April 11 I ordered the crew wake up early enough to try to land\nat KSC in case the weather cleared. No such luck. An hour and a half later\nwould be the first opportunity at Edwards. I spent my time between sitting on\nthe console, pacing back and forth, getting briefings on the STA runs,\nvisiting the weather office in person for updates, and having those ad hoc\nmeetings at the coffee pot.\n\nToo much coffee was consumed.\n\nThere was only one runway in the continental United States that would be go\nfor a shuttle landing that day. The wind was right down the runway 12 gust to\n18 knots, no crosswind.\n\nBut wait. It gets more complicated.\n\nEvery hour or so a weather balloon is launched at the landing site and tracked\nit measure the winds aloft as high as 50,000 ft. On that day the upper winds\nwere ugly, high and shifting. Worse, there was a tremendous shear in windspeed\nand direction just above 10,000 ft. The measured winds aloft exceeded anything\npreviously analyzed for a shuttle landing.\n\nNo pressure, right. Don\u2019t let my cardiologist know.\n\nThe Space Shuttle Orbiter is a 100-ton glider that has only one shot at making\na successful landing. After the deorbit burn which occurs an hour before there\nwas no way to delay, no go-around possibility, no second try. Theoretically\npossible to \u2018redesignate\u2019 to another runway, there wasn\u2019t even an emergency\nrunway with acceptable conditions anywhere near Edwards. To say that the\nshuttle would be committed was an understatement.\n\nDuring shuttle landings, the autopilot is in control from the start of reentry\ndown to about 70,000 ft. At about the point the shuttle drops below the speed\nof sound, the commander takes manual control and flies the rest of the way\ndown to landing \u2013 which is only 2 1\u20442 minutes. Very shortly after taking\ncontrol, the commander starts a turn to align with the runway. An imaginary\ncone in the sky \u2013 the Heading Alignment Cone \u2013 is mathematically displayed to\nthe commander. On this approach on April 11, we planned for him to make a\nright turn of 3\u20444 of a circle \u2013 271 degrees. Commanders sit on the left of the\ncockpit so they prefer a left hand turn to see the runway as they turn; we\nplanned for a right hand turn to conserve energy. This meant the commander he\ncould only look at the instruments for flying cues.\n\nEvery time we got balloon data, the mission control team ran a simulation of\nan automated landing. We used the autopilot model because we had no way to\npredict what a real man-in-the-loop pilot would do. Use of the autopilot for\nthe final part of entry was not allowed because it had certain well-known\nlimitations, and it would not perform well without a MSBLS \u2013 which we did not\nhave installed on runway 33.\n\nBut doing a computer simulation using the autopilot all the way to landing\ngave us critical information about the affects of the upper air winds on the\none and only landing attempt that the commander could make.\n\nAfter rolling off the HAC and onto the final approach at about 12,000 feet,\nthe shuttle dives to gain speed, using one of the \u2018aimpoints\u2019 painted on the\nlakebed the commander puts the nose down to a glideslope of 19 degrees \u2013 6\ntimes steeper than commercial airlines. Gaining speed to about 290 knots until\nthe commander starts his pull up at about 2,000 feet to set up for landing.\n\nNormally the commander is diving at the \u2018nominal aimpoint\u2019 \u2013 in this case a\nlarge black triangle painted in asphalt on the lakebed surface about 7,500\nfeet from the runway threshold. Speed \u2013 which is synonymous with energy at\nthis point \u2013 is controlled by the rudder/speedbrake on the tail of the\norbiter. The automated system checks to see if there is enough energy to make\nthe landing at the criteria desired \u2013 2500 feet past the threshold at 195 kts.\nThe automated system will open the speedbrake if the energy is too high and\nclose it down if the energy is low: 15% is the minimum setting if the energy\nis low; it is desirable to approach with the \u2018boards\u2019 open to about 20 to 30%.\n\nIf the energy is evaluated to be low from the balloon data, the commander will\nchange to the \u2018close in aimpoint\u2019 which is 6,500 feet from the threshold, thus\npicking up 1000 feet of margin to touchdown. In even lower energy situations,\nthe commander can stretch the landing by going as low as 185 kts \u2013 which gains\nanother 1000 feet in equivalent touchdown distance. All this to try to get to\nour normal touchdown point 2,500 feet past the threshold.\n\nThe simulations predicted that the landing would be \u2018low energy\u2019. Using the\nforecast winds the simulation needed the close-in aimpoint and the speedbrakes\nwere full closed all the way down yielding a touchdown distance of 2380 feet\npast the threshold at 195 knots. All \u2018go\u2019 by the flight rules but with yellow\nflags indicating caution all around.\n\nThe only options left for such a low energy day would be allowing the\ntouchdown distance to go as short as 1,100 feet past the threshold \u2013\nconsidered the minimum for safety \u2013 and holding off landing for another 10\nknots of airspeed to 185 knots. Those were it. The coin of the realm in these\nsituations is distance past the threshold and our purse was almost empty.\n\nUsing the data from the first balloon \u2013 at 4 hours prior to touchdown \u2013 the\nsituation had deteriorated. Again, using close in aimpoint, closed boards, the\ntouchdown distance was predicted to be 1800 feet at 195 knots. Still \u2018go\u2019 but\ngetting a brighter shade of yellow.\n\nMy blood pressure ticked up.\n\nAt Edwards the Shuttle training aircraft was flying mimicking a shuttle\nlanding. The first approach the aircraft would not go into simulated shuttle\nmode so no touchdown data came in. The experienced shuttle commander at the\ncontrols reported that the turbulence was not an issue and it appeared to be a\ngood day to land.\n\nUsing the L-2.5-hour balloon data the touchdown prediction had deteriorated to\n1300 feet past the threshold \u2013 still \u2018go\u2019 but close to the 1100 foot minimum\nrequired by flight rules. We reported this result to the crew.\n\nOn his last dive at the runway, the STA pilot reported simulated touchdown at\n1600 feet past the threshold which gave me some very slight sense of relief.\n\nTime to decide. It always gets really quiet in Mission Control and all the\nsenior managers had stopped giving advice. It was my call.\n\nKnowing that the only runway on the continent where the shuttle could safely\nland had marginal energy conditions, I gave a \u201cGo for Deorbit\u201d to the Capcom\nto pass to the crew. I knew that we could have safely waved off for a second\nday, but tomorrow\u2019s weather forecasts were about the same.\n\nA few minutes later the crew executed the deorbit burn and we were committed.\nCOMMITTED.\n\nWhile the shuttle was on its way down, we got our last update from the L-1\nhour balloon data, touchdown 1800 feet past the threshold. Better. I began\nbreathing again.\n\nAs the shuttle approached the HAC, the commander delayed by a fraction of a\nsecond turning onto the cone, something that was not at all uncommon. However,\nflying outside the HAC increased the distance the glider would have to fly and\nthus made the energy situation even worse.\n\nUnbeknownst to us there was another phenomenon at play; the wind shear\naltitude had dropped from 13,000 feet to just under 10,000 feet. This change\nin the wind speed and direction effectively robbed the orbiter of some energy.\n\nIn the shuttle software, at 10,000 feet, there is a check of speed and\ndistance to go which, if it is good, the guidance scheme transitions to what\nis called \u2018approach and land\u2019. When the wind shear was at 13,000 feet the\nsoftware detected the energy difference and directed the commander to fly more\naggressively to make up energy and the A/L transition occurred on time. With\nthe wind shear below 10,000 feet, the A/L transition criteria was not\nacceptable and the guidance did not direct the commander to fly as\naggressively. Rolling out on final the wind shear delayed the software\ntransition which then did not indicate to the commander he should fly a more\naggressive high lift/drag profile.\n\nComing down the energy situation just got worse. The commander could see it,\nbut we in MCC could not. He pulled up at the right point, lowered the gear at\nthe right point, but it was a long way to the threshold. Too long. The\nspeedbrakes were closed and at the point the only option at that point was to\nhold off landing by holding the nose higher as the speed decreased. Touchdown\nfinally occurred at 166 knots \u2013 the second slowest in shuttle history. The\nmain gear slapped the lakebed surface some 623 feet short of the threshold of\nthe runway.\n\nDisaster?\n\nWe got lucky. Every runway the shuttle was allowed to use has a 1000-foot\nunderrun \u2013 safe space before the threshold. On the lakebed where the stripes\nwere rather arbitrary there were miles of safe landing space.\n\nIt was a safe landing.\n\nI was unaware at how bad it had been.\n\nIt was several hours later when I got the call. The first apology I made was\nto the commander for putting him in that position.\n\nWe had been lucky when they paid us to be smart.\n\nWe spent the next six weeks going painstakingly through the situation.\n\nI thought I was going to get fired for putting the crew at risk. But the\nsenior folks decided I had learned a valuable lesson. We had all learned a\nvaluable lesson.\n\nWe made many changes to the entry planning process. One was to make sure the\nSTA pilot reported if the A/L transition was delayed (it had been delayed\nduring his dives but it was not reported to MCC). Another was to steepen the\nglideslope by an additional 2 degrees to increase maximum speed before pullout\nto 300 kts to give more energy.\n\nWe trained the pilots to fly the HAC turn closer, although that had mixed\nsuccess; that is partly what you get with a human in the loop.\n\nBut most important was to re-emphasize to Entry Flight Directors to use\nextreme caution when committing the orbiter to a landing.\n\nIt is not a job for the fainthearted.\n\nThe next time we fly a winged vehicle down from orbit, I hope they don\u2019t have\nto learn that lesson again.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nSignificant ConversationsNovember 2, 2014Liked by 8 people\n\nAfter Ten Years: Flying A Mature Vehicle \u2013 Or NotNovember 6, 2012In \"After Ten\nYears\"\n\nSTS-121 The Hardest Launch Part 5: What Can We Learn?July 11, 2019Liked by 4\npeople\n\n## About waynehale\n\nWayne Hale is retired from NASA after 32 years.

I\u2019d always had the impression that the\nproblem at White Sand\u2019s was an unacceptable level of infiltration by gypsum\ndust into the payload bay after STS-3.\n\nReply\n\n     * waynehale says:\n\nMarch 11, 2024 at 3:16 pm\n\nSomewhat of a myth, gypsum intrusion post landing STS-3 was caused largely by\nnot installing protective covers right away and high winds blowing dust in the\novernight. It was an acceptable place to land but after that always 3rd\npriority. It had the difficulty of being the highest altitude of the three\nlanding sites and, as every pilot knows, air density plays a roll in landing\nconditions.\n\nReply\n\n  2. j Hammock says:\n\nMarch 11, 2024 at 9:02 am\n\nThank you Wayne, always a bright spot in my day when I see a new post from\nyou.\n\ncc.
