There\u2019s a clear English-language lineage, but there really\nare similar African proverbs and it\u2019s hard to rule out cross-pollination.\n\nWhen the world started falling apart in April, I found myself with unexpected\nfree time. I had reserved the month to do book promotion, and while I did\nplenty of that, the lack of travel and live events left a void. So I embarked\non a pointless internet odyssey: to discover the origin of the proverb: \u201cIf\nyou want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d\n\nIt is most often cited as an \u201cAfrican proverb,\u201d though it\u2019s also attributed to\nWarren Buffet, Hilary Clinton, Cory Booker, Al Gore and others. The supposed\nAfrican origin means its surfaces occasionally in international development,\nwhich is where I encountered it\u2014though not for the first time\u2014earlier this\nyear.\n\nThis kind of foggy origin is, it turns out, typical of the things we call\nproverbs, aphorisms, maxims, adages, and old saws. There is a whole field of\nstudy, paremiology, populated by linguists and folklorists who have dedicated\ntheir careers to the study of them.\n\n## The very online answer #\n\nBut before I thought to consult them, I did what anyone would do, and asked\nGoogle.\n\nThis was Google\u2019s answer even if I replaced \u201csaid,\u201d in the question, with\n\u201ccoined.\u201d Using \u201cinvented,\u201d I got a different, less-confident answer: Al\nGore.^1 That search pointed me to a 2016 Jezebel article about this proverb\nand its origins, written by Jia Tolentino.^2\n\nTolentino dismissed the African origin story. She described scanning \u201c40 pages\nof search results only to turn up nothing except a wide variety of white\npeople saying [it.]\u201d She concluded:\n\n> [A] good rule of thumb is\u2014if you hear a gripping \u201cAfrican proverb\u201d in a TED\n> Talk or an episode of 30 Rock, or even just from a person who is comfortable\n> saying \u201cAfrican proverb\u201d with a straight face, you might remember:\n>\n> \u201cThat\u2019s probably not an African proverb.\u201d \u2014 African Proverb\n\nIt was a sassy and superficial analysis\u2014though that didn\u2019t make it wrong.\nStill, Tolentino\u2019s sweeping conclusion irked me. It seemed underresearched,\nand ill-thought-out.\n\nAfrican languages must have many proverbs. Some must have crept into English.\nAnd given the fairly short history of European interest in Africa, isn\u2019t it\npossible that a proverb might have circulated in multiple African languages\nfor centuries before reaching English. Wouldn\u2019t \u201cAfrican proverb\u201d be a pretty\nfair description for such a thing?\n\n## The experts\u2019 answer #\n\nSo I decide to simply email an expert, Prof. Wolfgang Mieder, a leading\nparemiologist.^3 He replied quickly. He knew the proverb, and indeed had\npublished an article that analysed it, which he was kind enough to share with\nme.^4\n\nIt\u2019s not online, but you can see a preliminary version of the analysis, posted\nto a linguists mailing list by Mieder\u2019s coauthor Charles Doyle\u2014by coincidence\njust a few weeks before Tolentino\u2019s article in 2016. That version notes that:\n\n> The saying, which in recent years has often (though perhaps spuriously)\n> [been] identified as an African proverb, might be regarded as an anti-\n> proverb responding, to the older Anglo-American proverb \u201cHe who travels\n> fastest travels alone,\u201d a variant of \u201cHe who travels alone travels\n> fast(est).\u201d\n\nThe first usage Doyle and Mieder give is in a 1917 speech by a Cyrus\nMcCormick, published in The Harvester World.^5\n\nThe Kipling text\u2014the proverb to which this anti-proverb is a reply\u2014is a poem,\nThe Winners, the first stanza of which runs:\n\n> What the moral? Who rides may read. When the night is thick and the tracks\n> are blind A friend at a pinch is a friend, indeed,^6 But a fool to wait for\n> the laggard behind. Down to Gehenna^7 or up to the Throne, He travels the\n> fastest who travels alone.\n\nAs Mieder confirmed by email, \u201cwe do not agree with the African origin.\u201d In\nthe published article, Mieder and Doyle revised the parenthetical assessment\nof this claim from their draft\u2019s \u201cperhaps spuriously\u201d to \u201cspuriously.\u201d\nOfficially, then, the proverb is Not African.\n\nThe relevant couplet from Kipling\u2019s poem is recited by Colin Firth in last\nyear\u2019s \u201c1917.\u201d\n\n## A rejoinder from Africa #\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end, because my search turned up another thread: a \u201cWeekly\nAfrican Proverb\u201d dated December 21, 2000, on AFRIPROV.org, a website that\ncollects such things:\n\n> Alone a youth runs fast, with an elder slow, but together they go far.\n>\n> \u2014 Luo proverb.^8\n\nDecember 2000 predates the modern explosion in the use of \u201cif you want to go\nfast...\u201d And the more specific attribution to Luo, an East African language\ngroup, defeats Tolentino\u2019s skepticism about vague pan-African origins.\n\nBut is it really the same proverb, contrasting, as it does, youth and age in a\nway the Kipling-descended one does not?\n\nTo find out more, I emailed Rev. Joseph Healey, the listed moderator of\nAFRIPROV.org. Healey lives in Nairobi. He has been doing missionary work in\nEast Africa for fifty years, and, it seems, collecting African proverbs for\nseveral decades at least. Though he doesn\u2019t have Mieder\u2019s academic pedigree,\nit\u2019s fair to say he has some authority on this topic.\n\nI asked him specifically about \u201cif you want to go fast, go alone; if you want\nto go far, go together.\u201d He replied\n\n>   1. Originally this proverb [is] from Burkina Faso. So, yes, it is [an]\n> African Proverb.\n>\n>   2. Typical of important African proverbs it has equivalents in other\n> languages like the Luo (East Africa) proverb \u201cAlone a youth runs fast, with\n> an elder slow, but together they go far.\u201d\n>\n>   3. It has a universal variation as in Rudyard Kipling\u2019s line \u201che travels\n> fastest who travels alone.\u201d\n>\n>\n\nIs it possible that this proverb expresses such a universal truth, using such\nan obvious metaphor, that is has arisen independently in different places and\nat different times. Then my search for a single origin would be futile.\n\n## When and how did the standard form emerge? #\n\nSo I narrowed my objective. What was the evolution of the particular modern\nform, the one that now litters the internet, containing the exact word pattern\nfast\u2013alone\u2014far\u2013together.\n\nMieder and Doyle\u2019s article includes many variants after 1917 that do not quite\ncontain that pattern: from 1977, for example: \u201c\u2018He travels fastest who travels\nalone,\u2019 as George Washington said. But he travels farthest who has a\ncompanion.\u201d The last of these \u201cpre-modern\u201d forms of the proverb is a 1993\nessay in the New York Times Book Review by South African poet Breyten\nBreytenbach:\n\n> He who travels alone travels fastest, but in the company of friends you go\n> farther.\n\nBreytenbach\u2019s phrasing lacks the parallelism that makes the modern wording\nsticky, and shifts awkwardly from the third to second person. But at least our\nsearch has come back to Africa (albeit to an Afrikaans-speaking white South\nAfrican).\n\nIt is Mieder and Doyle\u2019s very next entry that finally gets all the words\nright. It is a 2004 book, Choose the Life, by Bill Hull, an evangelical\npastor. Hull uses the exact wording of this post\u2019s title; the same wording\nappearing in most of those images above:\n\n> So my gift of love has been to submit to that process. As the African\n> proverb tells us, \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far,\n> go together.\u201d\n\nTantalizingly, of all the references collected by Mieder and Doyle, Hull\u2019s is\nthe first to cite an African origin.\n\nBut what if Hull\u2014used to Biblical rhythms and the poetry of the sermon\u2014settled\non this wording himself, and just invented the African origin.\n\nThis worried me, so... I emailed him. He told me that he first heard it in \u201ca\nsermon or message that a person gave, don\u2019t remember who, but they were a\nmissionary and they ascribed it to the people they lived and worked with in\nSouth Africa.\u201d (Another South African connection.)\n\nThis new, more evolutionarily successful form of words\u2014with it\u2019s critical\nmutation, a claimed African origin\u2014quickly took root in the fertile soil of\nthe rhetoric of early 2000s globalist optimism. I can\u2019t prove Thomas Friedman\never used it, but... oh no wait, yes I can.\n\n## Where does that leave us? #\n\nThis is where my own odyssey ended. By the time I got to this point, the\nearly-April panic of COVID had slipped into the late-April everyday of anti-\nCOVID precautions, and ordinary life, to a point, had resumed.\n\nI can\u2019t really dispute the expert judgement, of Professors Mieder and Doyle,\nthat this proverb has a clear non-African lineage. But equally, there are\nenough African connections\u2014and to west, east and southern Africa, no less\u2014to\nraise doubt in my mind. I think the jury is still out. (And if you happen to\nfind out anything more, know Breytenbach\u2014whose email address is not public\u2014or\nspeak Luo, please let me know!)\n\nThe one thing I thing I learnt for sure is that cold-emailing random people on\nthe internet is surprisingly effective. People are really helpful, and by\nenlisting their help over a few days in April, I came much closer to an answer\nthan I would have done, had I worked alone.\n\nIf only there were a pithy phrase to capture that idea.\n\n  1. Maybe this is because Al Gore is known for inventing things. \u21a9\n\n  2. Right now, Tolentino\u2019s article is the internet\u2019s Best Answer to this question. But perhaps this post can supplant it? \u21a9\n\n  3. Though not before I wasted a lot more time with Google. Tracing proverbs, as I discovered, is a difficult search problem. Some proverbs exist in stable, fixed forms: \u201ca stitch in time saves nine,\u201d for example. (Rhymes help a lot: they stabilize the wording as the mirrored strands of DNA stabilize a genome.) Stable proverbs are easy to search for in Google, or newspaper archives, or other corpuses. But others proverbs mutate, taking varying wordings even while expressing the same idea. For these, it is not enough to search on an exact phrase\u2014you have to be creative. Sometimes these unstable proverbs eventually find a stable form, which is what seems to have happened\u2014just about\u2014with \u201cif you want to go fast...\u201d \u21a9\n\n  4. Doyle, Charles C., and Wolfgang Mieder. \u201cThe Dictionary of Modern Proverbs: A Supplement.\u201d Proverbium, 33 (2016), 85-120. \u21a9\n\n  5. This McCormick must have been Cyrus Hall McCormick III, whose namesake grandfather had invented the McCormick Reaper and founded the predecessor of the International Harvest Company. The Harvester World was, as far as I can tell, the company\u2019s trade magazine. \u21a9\n\n  6. Kipling is not afraid to boldly deploy another proverb within this stanza. \u21a9\n\n  7. From Wikipedia: \u201cGehenna or Gehinnom is thought to be a small valley in Jerusalem. In the Hebrew Bible, Gehenna was initially where some of the kings of Judah sacrificed their children by fire. Thereafter, it was deemed to be cursed. In rabbinic literature, Gehenna is also a destination of the wicked.\u201d \u21a9\n\n  8. I also found this proverb as a chapter epigraph in a 2015 book by Kate Otto Chebly, a doctor in New York, along with a transliteration from Luo: Rawera ringo matek kende owuon kod juduong\u2019 gidhi mos to kanyakla gichopo mabor. Otto Chebly told me a Luo friend suggested the quote. \u21a9\n\n## Add comment\n\nComments are moderated and will not appear immediately.\n\nPosted 2020-12-25.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
