And\nwhile there\u2019re early indications that the rules may be slightly weaker than\nthose stripped away by the Trump administration \u2014 and absolutely no indication\nthe rules could meaningfully impact telecom revenues \u2014 telecom giants have\nalready begun their whining about \u201cburdensome regulation\u201d in earnest.\n\nRevolving door poster child Michael Powell, who once led the FCC but now\nlobbies for the cable industry, was quick to once again insist that the basic\nnet neutrality rules would result in a parade of horribles:\n\n> Powell, the CEO of cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet & Television\n> Association, was the FCC chairman under President George W. Bush. Powell\n> said the FCC must \u201creverse course to avoid years of litigation and\n> uncertainty\u201d in a reference to the inevitable lawsuits that industry groups\n> will file against the agency.\n>\n> The NCTA said in another statement that the FCC \u201cis pushing unnecessary\n> regulation that will slam the brakes on Internet for all and deny\n> millions\u2014especially in rural areas\u2014the important opportunities that high-\n> speed Internet brings.\u201d\n\nAs is usually the case with net neutrality fights, none of that is actually\ntrue. The courts have already ruled that it\u2019s well within the FCC\u2019s right to\nimpose or repeal net neutrality rules provided their arguments are based in\nfactual reality. The only thing the FCC can\u2019t do is abdicate its federal\nconsumer protection authority, then try and tell states what to do (something\nthe Trump FCC tried and failed to accomplish).\n\nMeanwhile, the rules generally give ample leeway for big ISPs to engage in\ndodgy and anti-competitive behavior \u2014 if they\u2019re just slightly creative about\nit. And the FCC, regardless of party, has a very shaky track record as it\npertains to standing up to industry on any issue of substance, meaning the\nidea they\u2019d even enforce the rules with any consistent vigor is largely\nperformative.\n\nDerek Turner, a sector analyst over at consumer group Free Press, told me that\nwhile big ISPs put on a big show about being concerned about the rules via\ntheir trade groups, actual executives aren\u2019t worried about the rules in the\nslightest. To the point where they\u2019re not even mentioned in investor-facing\nstatements, because they know it\u2019s not going to impact broadband investment \u2014\nor anything else:\n\n> \u201cThe impact of FCC regulation is simply a non-factor in the minds of ISP\n> executives and investment analysts,\u201d he told me. \u201cTitle II and Net\n> Neutrality were not mentioned, or even hinted at, by a single ISP on any\n> full-year 2023 investor calls or at other investor conference appearances\n> following these calls, and no analyst asked any question about or related to\n> this proceeding.\u201d\n\nLong time telecom sector analyst Blair Levin is making similar observations:\n\n> \u201cLike its predecessors, this policy debate will generate significant\n> headlines and commentary, [but] is unlikely to generate significant changes\n> in how the ISPs operate, nor material changes in their revenues, margins, or\n> opportunities,\u201d New Street Research policy analyst Blair Levin explained in\n> a research note (subscription required) issued earlier in the week.\u201d\n\nSo why then are big ISP trade organizations constantly lying and freaking out\nabout the rules\u2019 impact?\n\nThe real worry for big providers like Comcast and AT&T is that this could\nresult in, someday in some distant theoretical future, actual efforts by the\nFCC to hold them accountable for things like exploitative market rates only\nmade possible by monopolization and corruption. You know, stuff like rate\ncaps, or real punishments for ripping subscribers off with bullshit fees and\npredatory charges.\n\nBut again, there\u2019s not much of a real worry here. The FCC at this point is\nlargely a laughable non-factor when it comes to U.S. consumer protection. It\u2019s\ngenerally staffed by some of the most politically feckless revolving door\nregulators imaginable; folks more worried about their next political post or\nthink tank gig than protecting consumers (the Gigi Sohn fiasco shows what\nhappens should you challenge this).\n\nThe kind of folks who currently staff the FCC can\u2019t even acknowledge that\nmonopoly power is a problem in public-facing statements, much less propose any\nsort of market remedy for it. Big ISPs like AT&T and Comcast are mostly just\nwhining because they very much want things to remain exactly as they are:\nunchecked monopoly power, limited competition, and feckless oversight. Same as\nit ever was.\n\nTelecom monopolies like their regulators cowed, feckless, and powerless. Even\nthe faintest pretense that they might engage in anything else makes their\nwell-funded policy groups cry like a colic baby.\n\nFiled Under: broadband, consumer protection, fcc, gigabit, high speed\ninternet, investment, michael powell, net neutrality, regulation, title ii\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * AT&T Stops Pretending It Had Nothing To Do With A Massive Data Breach Impacting 73 Million Customers.
