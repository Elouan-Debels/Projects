I have even written about the benefits of using Storybook-Driven\nDevelopment. However, after removing Storybook from our latest project, I\nbegan to feel that the costs of adopting Storybook outweigh the benefits.\n\n## An Effective Storybook Environment\n\nThe ideal Storybook environment is one in which developers, designers, and the\nclient all collaborate on the Storybook files interactively. This means\ndedicating front-end developers to developing and maintaining UI components\n(and their associated story files) and designers who use the Storybook site\nfor mockups and testing. It also requires clients who view the Storybook site\nto demo components and give additional feedback. If you\u2019re missing any of\nthese pieces or if any party has not bought in on using Storybook, then it\u2019s\nlikely to be a net drain on your team.\n\nWhile Storybook offers support for several frameworks, support for projects\nother than React feels like an afterthought. This is quite notable when\nworking on an Angular project, where some versions of Storybook would actually\npull in React as a dependency into your \u201cpackage.json\u201d. This is obviously not\nideal and creates dependency bloat.\n\n## Reconsidering Isolated Component Development\n\nOne of the main benefits of this development environment tool is being able to\nrender and develop components in isolation. While this initially seems\nhelpful, it is often unnecessary and can mask unexpected styling conflicts.\nWith hot reloading, developing a component directly in the browser in the\ncontext of the rest of the page is just as convenient as developing it in the\nStorybook screen. Sometimes the component may actually look different when\nused in the full page, due to global styling or some other interaction.\nTherefore, seeing the component in context during development is more useful\nthan developing it in isolation.\n\nFurthermore, suppose you really want that component isolated (for instance\nmaybe it is deep inside a modal, or in another hard-to-reach spot). In that\ncase, it\u2019s often simpler to create a temporary route and drop the component\nin. If you don\u2019t care about the documentation aspect, then this will be\nsufficient to provide a similar developer experience, without having to also\nmanage Storybook and the \u201c.stories\u201d files.\n\n## Maintenance Challenges\n\nStorybook also creates extra maintenance for developers (or designers) who\nmaintain the \u201c.stories\u201d files. Every time a new UI component is created, you\nwill also be creating a Storybook file for it. Any input data on this\ncomponent will need to be mocked out in the Storybook file. Whenever the API\nfor that component changes, you will also need to update the associated\nStorybook files. In this way, this development tool serves as living\ndocumentation, at the cost of maintaining all those extra files. If your\ndesigners and clients are not even viewing these stories regularly, there\u2019s\nlittle value added compared to the maintenance costs.\n\n## Is it worth it?\n\nIf you work on a project with dedicated frontend developers, designers, and\nclients who are all 100% bought in on using Storybook, then go ahead and use\nit. However, for the rest of us, you won\u2019t get enough value from adopting it.\nAfter having ripped out or just abandoning Storybook on a few projects, I will\nbe cautious about automatically reaching for it the next time.\n\nDesignstorybookcomponents\n\nZachary Johnson\n\nAll Posts \u2192\n\n### Related Posts\n\n  * Developer Tools\n\n## When to Use PUT and When to Use PATCH\n\n  * Developer Tools\n\n## 3 Features of Modern CSS You Should Know About\n\n  * Developer Tools\n\n## Leverage Go\u2019s Concurrency: Transforming API Data Fetching with Goroutines\nand Channels\n\n## Keep up with our latest posts.\n\nWe\u2019ll send our latest tips, learnings, and case studies from the Atomic\nbraintrust on a monthly basis.\n\n[mailpoet_form id=\"1\"]\n\nConversation\n\n### Join the conversation Cancel reply\n\n### Development Category\n\n  * Software Science\n  * Development Practices\n  * Developer Tools\n\nRelated Posts\n\nDeveloper Tools\n\n# When to Use PUT and When to Use PATCH\n\nDeveloper Tools\n\n# 3 Features of Modern CSS You Should Know About\n\nDeveloper Tools\n\n# Leverage Go\u2019s Concurrency: Transforming API Data Fetching with Goroutines\nand Channels\n\n### Tell Us About Your Project\n\nWe\u2019d love to talk with you about your next great software project.
