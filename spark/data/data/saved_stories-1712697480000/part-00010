Filed in the Northern District\nof California, San Francisco Division, the class-action lawsuit led by\nplaintiffs Raymond Noel and Laura Noel, represents a broader challenge against\nRoblox\u2019s business practices, particularly its treatment of minor users and\ndevelopers.\n\nPublished\n\n1 day ago\n\non\n\n8 April 2024\n\nBy\n\nLeonid Shmatenko\n\n  * Share\n  * Tweet\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## Allegations of Roblox\u2019s Child Labor and Exploitation\n\nCentral to the lawsuit is the claim that Roblox has created an ecosystem where\nchildren are not only the primary consumers but also the main content\ncreators. The platform, which boasts millions of active users, a significant\nportion of whom are minors, is accused of leveraging this young demographic to\ngenerate profit under exploitative conditions. According to the complaint,\nRoblox rewards these young developers with Robux, its digital currency, which\nwhen cashed out, is devalued, effectively minimizing the real-world\ncompensation these children receive for their work (pp. 3-5, 10-28).\n\nThe plaintiffs, whose law firm also filed a lawsuit against other gaming\ncompanies, argue that the structure of Roblox\u2019s virtual economy, coupled with\nrestrictive policies, makes it exceedingly difficult for minors to convert\ntheir Robux into real money. Requirements such as a minimum balance and a\nsubscription fee are among the barriers that young developers face,\ncontributing to what the lawsuit describes as a system of child labor\nexploitation (pp. 5-7, 16-18).\n\nIn detail:\n\n  * Parents claim that Roblox sets the bar so high for converting Robux into real money that they end up keeping the majority of the funds.\n  * The lawsuit claims that while USD 4.99 can purchase 400 Robux, converting 1,000 Robux can only get you USD 3.50.\n\n## Unsafe Platform Allegations\n\nBeyond the economic exploitation, the lawsuit raises concerns about the safety\nof the Roblox platform. Allegations of exposure to predatory behavior,\nincluding simulated violence and sexual activity, challenge Roblox\u2019s self-\nportrayal as a safe, educational space for children. Despite Roblox\u2019s\nmarketing efforts, the complaint suggests that the platform fails to\nadequately protect its users from harmful content and interactions, further\nendangering its predominantly minor audience (pp. 9-11).\n\n## Demands for Justice and Systemic Reform\n\nSeeking a jury trial, the plaintiffs demand compensatory and punitive damages,\nrestitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief, and a reevaluation of Roblox\u2019s\nbusiness practices. The lawsuit calls for immediate action to end the alleged\nexploitation and to ensure the safety and fair compensation of young\ndevelopers on the platform (p. 6).\n\nAs the lawsuit advances, it not just examines Roblox\u2019s methods but also raises\nimportant inquiries about the obligations of online platforms that depend on\ncontent created by users. The result of this legal case may establish a\nstandard, requiring increased ethical interaction with and care of young users\nthroughout the technology sector.\n\n## A Turning Point for Digital Platforms\n\nThis legal challenge against Roblox Corporation underscores the urgent need\nfor digital platforms to prioritize the welfare and rights of their youngest\ncreators. As the esports and gaming communities closely monitor the case,\nthere is hope that it will lead to a safer, more equitable online environment\nfor all users, especially children who contribute their creativity and labor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations against Roblox highlight a critical moment in the fight for\nethical standards in the digital realm, calling on the industry to protect and\nfairly compensate the young talents driving its success. As the legal battle\nunfolds, the broader implications for user-generated content platforms and\ntheir treatment of minors remain to be seen.\n\n## Previous Class Action\n\nThe new class action follows a previous one from 2021 filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco\nDivision, under case number 3:21-cv-03943-WHO. The latter seeks to address\nseveral alleged illegal practices by Roblox, focusing on claims of deception,\nunfair conduct, exploitation of children, and failure to uphold safe and fair\noperating standards on its gaming platform.\n\nRoblox Corporation was accused of exploiting its primarily child user base by\nengaging in practices that expose children to a predatory environment,\nviolating several Californian legal statutes (p. 2). The platform, while\npresenting itself as a creative and interactive universe for game development\nand social interaction, allegedly operates on a business model that\nsystematically takes advantage of children, exposing them to harmful content\nand deceptive financial practices.\n\nRoblox Corporation reached a settlement in this class action lawsuit alleging\nthat Roblox should have reimbursed users who used Robux to purchase virtual\nitems that were subsequently taken down from the Roblox platform. Roblox will\ncreate a USD 10 million settlement fund for users to receive Robux credited to\ntheir Roblox account as part of the settlement. In contrast, users who meet\nthe requirements can file a claim to get their portion of the settlement fund\nin cash if it is more than USD 10. Roblox has also agreed to continue\nautomatically crediting users for Robux spent on items that are later\nmoderated for a minimum of four additional years.\n\nMore info on the settlement can be found here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage source: DallE\n\nRaymond Noel and Laura Noel et al. v.

This resolution concludes a series of\nlegal challenges that had not only captivated the attention of the gaming\ncommunity but also set a critical precedent for copyright law\u2019s application in\nthe fast-paced world of video gaming.\n\nPublished\n\n7 days ago\n\non\n\n2 April 2024\n\nBy\n\nLeonid Shmatenko\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## The Genesis of the Dispute between Moonton and Riot Games\n\nThe legal battle began when Riot Games, the maker of League of Legends,\naccused Moonton, the creator of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. Riot Games claimed\nthat Moonton copied essential elements like character designs, game modes, and\noverall style from League of Legends, leading Riot to take legal action to\nsafeguard its creative assets and copyright.\n\n## Legal Proceedings and the Journey Towards Resolution\n\nRiot Games first took legal action in the United States but eventually had to\nto pursue the claims in China due to complex international copyright laws and\nchallenges with jurisdiction, as both companies are heavily present there.\nThis action highlights the challenges of dealing with copyright conflicts in a\nworldwide digital market, where intellectual property moves across borders\neasily and legal systems differ greatly in different regions.\n\nEver since starting in 2017, the legal dispute between Riot Games and MOONTON\nhas evolved into a convoluted narrative, highlighting the fierce competition\nand legal complexities in the gaming sector. The main reason for this extended\nconflict revolves around the top games of each company: League of Legends\n(LoL) from Riot Games, a giant in the esports industry, and Mobile Legends\nfrom MOONTON, a rising competitor gaining fast popularity, particularly in the\nSoutheast Asian mobile gaming sector.\n\nThe legal battle began when Riot Games accused MOONTON of copying key gameplay\nelements, character designs, and abilities from League of Legends for their\nmobile game Mobile Legends. The first legal case in the United States sparked\na series of legal battles, as Riot Games claimed that Mobile Legends: 5v5 MOBA\nwas not just inspired by but copied LoL.\n\nDespite the US court deferring jurisdiction to China, MOONTON was still\nrequired to reach a USD 2.9 million settlement with Riot Games for copyright\ninfringement, which also resulted in Mobile Legends being temporarily removed\nfrom app stores. However, MOONTON decided to make adjustments and relaunch the\ngame as \u201cMobile Legends: Bang Bang,\u201d in an attempt to address the\ncontroversial copyright problems.\n\nEven with these changes and the significant agreement, the conflict was still\nongoing. In May 2022, Riot Games launched another legal attack on MOONTON,\naccusing them of copying intellectual property from their mobile game, League\nof Legends: Wild Rift, including its unique promotional tactics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ongoing legal disputes between Riot Games and MOONTON have sparked\nextensive debates within the gaming community and among industry experts. Some\nbelieve MOONTON intentionally copied League of Legends to benefit from its\npopularity, while others argue that similarities in MOBA games are common and\nshouldn\u2019t lead to legal action. These disagreements emphasize the fine line\nbetween finding inspiration and blatant copying, showcasing the continual\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property in the highly competitive\ngaming sector.\n\n## The Settlement\n\nYet, the parties decided to settle the dispute. The legal communication from\nMontoon reads:\n\n> \u201cAfter several rounds of communication, the two parties recently officially\n> signed a settlement agreement, and Riot Games has decided to formally\n> withdraw the corresponding lawsuits.\u201d\n\nThe settlement not only ends a period of legal confusion but also sets the\nstage for a gaming sector that, with any luck, prioritizes cooperation,\nrespect for intellectual property, and legal honesty. It acts as a powerful\nsymbol of the fragile equilibrium between encouraging creativity and honoring\nthe legal protections for that creativity. As the gaming industry keeps\ndeveloping, the knowledge gained from this conflict will probably have a\nsignificant impact on determining its future, particularly in terms of\nintellectual property rights.\n\n## Observations on Industry and Legal Matters\n\nIndustry stakeholders and legal experts are closely monitoring the agreement\nbetween Moonton and Riot Games, as they are interested in deciphering its\nimpact on upcoming copyright disputes in the esports industry. It catalyzes\ngame developers and publishers to align their creative aspirations with the\nneed to uphold intellectual property rights, guaranteeing a dynamic industry\nfuture rooted in innovation, respect, and legal integrity.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nThe settlement between Moonton and Riot Games demonstrates the importance of\nnegotiation and highlights the value of intellectual property rights in\ntoday\u2019s digital era. It indicates a shift toward a future where businesses\nparticipate in ethical actions, protecting the ever-changing environment of\nesports and gaming by being innovative, respectful, and following legal\nguidelines. As we move ahead, the gaming industry is at a critical point, with\nthe resolution of this disagreement paving the way for a cooperative,\nrespectful, and legally sound future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Case Overview\n\nPlaintiff: Riot Games, Inc.\n\nDefendant: Shanghai Moonton Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nCourt: United States District Court for the Central District of California\n\nCase Number: 2:22-cv-3107\n\n### Counsel for Plaintiff \u2013 Riot Games, Inc.\n\nKirkland & Ellis LLP\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * Dale M.

Evil Geniuses: SumaiL Loses After Prolonged Legal Battle\n\nIn a significant legal battle within the esports community, former Dota 2 star\nSyed \u201cSumaiL\u201d Hassan\u2019s lawsuit against his old team, Evil Geniuses (EG), and\nits owner, Peak6, has reached its conclusion. After more than two years of\nintense legal proceedings, the verdict is in, and it does not favor SumaiL.\nThe presiding jury dismissed all counts of the lawsuit, including breach of\ncontract and other allegations, siding entirely with EG and Peak6.\n\nPublished\n\n3 weeks ago\n\non\n\n19 March 2024\n\nBy\n\nLeonid Shmatenko\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## Background of the Case\n\nThe lawsuit originally stemmed from disputes over contract negotiations, stock\nownership, and the player\u2019s standing within the company. SumaiL, who was once\ncelebrated as one of the brightest talents in Dota 2, accused EG of exploiting\nhis inexperience during his tenure with the team. The core of the dispute\nrevolved around the acquisition of EG by Peak6 in 2019, which allegedly\ndiluted SumaiL\u2019s ownership stake in the company through the conversion of his\nstock into mixed options.\n\nFurther, SumaiL\u2019s departure from EG was marred with contention. Allegations\narose of the organization attempting to enforce draconian conditions upon his\nexit, including a stipulation for a USD 1 million payout for his shares\ncontingent upon his retirement from competitive Dota 2\u2014a condition SumaiL\nultimately did not accept.\n\n## Allegations and Legal Proceedings\n\nSumaiL\u2019s legal team argued that EG exploited his youth and inexperience,\nengaging in practices that severely impacted his career and financial well-\nbeing. One of the focal points of the lawsuit was the conversion of SumaiL\u2019s\n400,000 shares of stock, a process he claimed was not fully understood by him.\nFurthermore, legal counsel alleged placement on the inactive roster led to a\ndrastic salary reduction and imposed restrictions on joining other teams.\n\n## Jury Verdict and Defense Arguments\n\nDespite these allegations, the jury\u2019s verdict was clear, finding no evidence\nof malicious intent or deceit from EG in their dealings with Hassan. The\ndefense painted a picture of an organization that had not only acted\ntransparently but had also advised SumaiL to seek legal counsel during his\ncontract negotiations. They contended that the organization had offered SumaiL\ngenerous financial terms and flexibility, which contradicted the claims of\nexploitation and malpractice.\n\n## Implications for Esports Legal Standards\n\nThe verdict rendered on 1 March 2024 highlights several key aspects that\nwarrant attention from legal professionals and industry stakeholders. Firstly,\nthe complexities surrounding contract negotiations and ownership stakes are\nbrought to the forefront, underscoring the vulnerability of young athletes\nnavigating the esports environment. This case exemplifies the necessity for\ntransparent and equitable negotiation practices to ensure the fair treatment\nof players, who often find themselves at a disadvantage due to inexperience\nand lack of legal knowledge.\n\nSecond, the verdict highlights the importance of implementing clear legal\nguidance (and the need to seek legal counsel) within the industry. As esports\ncontinues to burgeon, establishing a robust legal framework becomes imperative\nto address and mitigate potential disputes effectively. The protection of\nplayer rights, particularly concerning contract negotiations and ownership\ninterests, emerges as a paramount concern, necessitating the adoption of\nstandardized practices that foster fairness and transparency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## The Future of Esports Contracts\n\nThe SumaiL vs. EG verdict certainly sets a precedent with far-reaching\nimplications for the future of esports contracts. It underscores the necessity\nfor comprehensive contracts that explicitly outline the rights and obligations\nof both players and organizations.\n\nThe case also shows that enhanced legal literacy among players is utterly\nimportant to make informed decisions in contractual matters. Legal\nprofessionals specializing in esports law are thus tasked with a crucial role\nin educating players and organizations about the nuances of contract law\nwithin the esports domain.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SumaiL vs. EG case is a groundbreaking case in the esports industry,\nproviding important perspectives on the legal issues specific to this sector.\nIt requires a holistic approach to improve the legal structure for esports,\nhighlighting the importance of thorough contracts, legal understanding, and\nthe promotion of equitable negotiation methods. As the sector evolves further,\nthe insights from this case will definitely have a significant impact on the\nfuture of esports agreements, promoting a fair and equal environment for both\nplayers and organizations.\n\nSumail Syed v.

This case brings to light the intricacies of resolving\ndisputes in the esports industry, emphasizing the impact of contractual\narbitration clauses on the legal strategies of parties involved.\n\nPublished\n\n4 weeks ago\n\non\n\n14 March 2024\n\nBy\n\nLeonid Shmatenko\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## The Shift to Arbitration: A New Path for Resolution\n\nIn a notable pivot from the courtroom to the arbitration table, the lawsuit\nfiled by H3CZ and Scump seeking substantial damages from Activision Blizzard\nhas been dismissed, with the parties agreeing to arbitration and thereby\nending the litigation. This move underscores a reevaluation of legal tactics,\nlikely influenced by the arbitration clause embedded within the CDL\nagreements, demonstrating the power such clauses hold in determining the forum\nand nature of dispute resolution.\n\n### The Essence of Arbitration\n\nArbitration is a procedure in which a dispute is submitted, by agreement of\nthe parties, to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision on the\ndispute. In choosing arbitration, the parties opt for a private dispute\nresolution procedure instead of going to court.\n\nIts principal characteristics are:\n\n#### Arbitration is consensual\n\nArbitration can only take place if both parties have agreed to it. In the case\nof future disputes arising under a contract, the parties insert an arbitration\nclause in the relevant contract. An existing dispute can be referred to\narbitration by means of a submission agreement between the parties. In\ncontrast to mediation, a party cannot unilaterally withdraw from arbitration.\n\n#### The parties choose the arbitrator(s)\n\nUnder e.g. the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules, the parties can select a\nsole arbitrator or a tribunal of three arbitrators together. If they choose to\nhave a three-member arbitral tribunal, each party appoints one of the\narbitrators; those two persons then agree on the presiding arbitrator.\nAlternatively, potential arbitrators with relevant expertise can be suggested\nor directly appointed by the arbitral institutions. For example, the WIPO\nmaintains an extensive roster of arbitrators ranging from seasoned dispute-\nresolution generalists to highly specialized practitioners and experts\ncovering the entire legal and technical spectrum of intellectual property.\n\n#### Arbitration is neutral\n\nIn addition to their selection of neutrals of appropriate nationality, parties\nare able to choose such important elements as the applicable law, language and\nvenue of the arbitration. This allows them to ensure that no party enjoys a\nhome court advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Arbitration is a confidential procedure\n\nThe chosen arbitration rules usually ensure the secrecy of the arbitration\u2019s\nexistence, any information revealed during the process, and the final\ndecision. In specific scenarios, the JAMS Rules permit a party to limit the\nexposure of trade secrets or confidential data shared with the arbitration\npanel or a confidentiality consultant to the panel.\n\n#### The decision of the arbitral tribunal is final and easy to enforce\n\nAccording to the WIPO Rules, the involved parties commit to executing the\npanel\u2019s verdict promptly. Global judgments are recognized and enforced by\ndomestic courts under the New York Convention, which only allows for their\nannulment in exceptionally rare situations. Over 165 countries are signatories\nto this Convention.\n\n### The Arbitration Clause in Depth\n\nThe arbitration clause at the heart of this dispute lays out a detailed\nprocess for resolving disputes, beginning with an attempt at informal\nresolution through negotiation and consultation. It states:\n\n> . BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:\n>\n> READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS,\n> INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n>\n> These BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if\n> you are domiciled in and/or use the CDL Service in the United States.

Specifically, all claims arising out of or\n> relating to this Agreement (including its interpretation, formation,\n> performance and breach), the parties\u2019 relationship with each other and/or\n> your use of the CDL Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration\n> administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive\n> Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate,\n> excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\n> This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving\n> interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201c) shall apply\n> to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of this\n> Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in\n> this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court\n> or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising\n> out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or\n> formation of this Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all\n> or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is\n> subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever\n> relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The\n> arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a\n> judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n>\n> The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at\n> http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267.

To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration\n> exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, CDL will pay the additional cost. The\n> parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have\n> the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand\n> that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of\n> litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration\n> than in court.\n>\n> Location: If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take\n> place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for\n> you.

This clause clearly specifies\narbitration as the sole means for formal dispute resolution, highlighting its\nmandatory nature and the intention to avoid litigation costs.\n\nAdditionally, the clause contains a class action waiver, significantly\nlimiting the ability to pursue collective legal action. This aspect of the\narbitration agreement underscores the individual nature of arbitration and the\nparties\u2019 agreement to resolve disputes outside of a class or representative\naction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Implications of the Legal Strategy Shift\n\nThe movement towards arbitration after initiating a lawsuit indicates a\nreconsideration of legal tactics, possibly recognizing the enforceability of\nthe arbitration clause or aiming for a resolution that balances privacy,\nspeed, and cost-effectiveness. This strategic shift also reflects the broader\nlegal landscape in esports, where arbitration clauses are increasingly common,\nguiding how disputes are resolved within the industry.\n\n## The Role of Arbitration in Esports Disputes\n\nThe case of H3CZ and Scump versus Activision Blizzard serves as great example\nof the legal intricacies and strategic decisions underlying disputes in the\nesports arena, and the necessity to read the Terms & Conditions. The move from\ncourt to arbitration demonstrates that the Claimants might have chosen the\nwrong forum and also highlights the broader trend towards using arbitration to\nresolve disputes in the esports industry. As the sector continues to grow,\nunderstanding and navigating these legal frameworks will be crucial for\nstakeholders at all levels.\n\nCase Information for Rodriguez v.
