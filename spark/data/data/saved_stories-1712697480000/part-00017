Moreover, existing API integrations emphasize diversity\n> over the precision and error avoidance essential in real-world customer\n> service scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an LLM agent named\n> CHOPS (CHat with custOmer Profile in existing System), designed to: (1)\n> efficiently utilize existing databases or systems for accessing user\n> information or interacting with these systems following existing guidelines;\n> (2) provide accurate and reasonable responses or carry out required\n> operations in the system while avoiding harmful operations; and (3) leverage\n> a combination of small and large LLMs to achieve satisfying performance at a\n> reasonable inference cost. We introduce a practical dataset, the CPHOS-\n> dataset, which includes a database, guiding files, and QA pairs collected\n> from CPHOS, an online platform that facilitates the organization of\n> simulated Physics Olympiads for high school teachers and students. We have\n> conducted extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed\n> CHOPS architecture using the CPHOS-dataset, with the aim of demonstrating\n> how LLMs can enhance or serve as alternatives to human customer service. Our\n> code and dataset will be open-sourced soon.\n\nComments:| 14 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.01343 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.01343v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.01343arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Lei Li [view email] [v1] Sun, 31 Mar 2024 07:11:48 UTC (3,723 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled CHOPS: CHat with custOmer Profile Systems for\nCustomer Service with LLMs, by Jingzhe Shi and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
