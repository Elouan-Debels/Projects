Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nFor 40 years, I was an editor, mostly of magazines, including this one. As an\neditor and as a reader, I found the story of how creators create irresistible.\nI liked that these stories had a classic structure to them \u2014 each inherently\ndramatic, starting with nothing and ending with something. I assigned a story\non Stephen Sondheim in which he explained how he wrote a single song. I traced\nthe evolutions of buildings and novels and soap-opera arcs. Cultural\nprocedurals were especially good material.\n\nWhen I quit my magazine job, I decided to try my hand as an artist. It wasn\u2019t\nentirely abrupt: In my work, I always found it satisfying telling stories in\nphotographs and graphics and drawings, and in spare moments \u2014 a whim at first\n\u2014 I picked up a paintbrush to try making images myself. When I left my job, I\nbegan to paint more seriously. That was the beginning of my torment: I just\nwasn\u2019t very good.\n\n## The Work of Art\n\nThese three origin stories are adapted from The Work of Art: How Something\nComes From Nothing (Penguin Press, April 16), a book tracing the evolution of\n43 novels, paintings, poems, movies, jokes, and more, using the notebook\npages, doodles, and sketches that were the artists\u2019 tools.\n\nPRE-ORDER THE BOOK \u00bb\n\nDecent paintings sometimes emerged, but they seemed almost by accident. And\nthey were accidents I couldn\u2019t necessarily re-create. I was conservative \u2014 if\none part of a painting showed promise, I would protect it and put the rest of\nthe painting at risk. Sometimes I could get something going and then\ntentatively feel emboldened to try something new and then fall back, and that\nwould scare me \u2014 so I would retreat to what I knew, which meant resuming the\nbad habits. I got frustrated easily and gave up easily, never knowing when to\npersevere or surrender. You can see that these are all problems more of the\nhead than of the hand (though there were plenty of technique issues as well).\nBasically, it all seemed impossible.\n\nWhen I was at my most exasperated, I found myself asking the same question I\nhad asked as an editor: How does anybody make art? Only now, my professional\ninterest had become personal. The problems I am describing were ones of\neditorial self-scrutinyEditing is deliberating \u2014 choosing a word or thought,\ndismissing or advancing, evaluating. It\u2019s what I did for my career \u2014 and it\u2019s\nalso an essential part of artistic-decision-making, but it can be brutal.\nArtists use the phrase often to talk about a stage after the imagination has\n\u201cvomited\u201d (another phrase artists use often) and before the hard-core, skills-\nbased crafting can begin. run amok, as if I had an overeager immune system\nthat was sabotaging me. Then I came across a monograph about the figurative\nartist Eric Fischl and this passage, in which he describes the making of one\nof his more famous paintings, called Bad Boy.\n\n> I actually had no idea what I was looking for ... I started out just wanting\n> to paint a bowl of fruit. I went from painting that bowl of fruit to\n> constructing the room that the fruit could be in, to finding who might be in\n> that room and what time of day it was. Who I first thought was in the room\n> wasn\u2019t there. People came and went. The twelve-year-old boy stealing money\n> from the purse started out as an infant, lying next to the woman; then\n> became a five-year-old sitting on the edge of the bed ... He literally grew\n> up in that room ... I just kept following it, [trying] things that didn\u2019t\n> work ... I just painted things in, and painted things out.\n\nBad Boy. Photo: \u00a9 2024 Eric Fischl / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY\n\nReading this account, I felt some of my torture starting to lift. I\nappreciated Fischl\u2019s willingness to allow me into his mind as he stumbled\nthrough the work. His struggle was comforting \u2014 and illuminating. It gave me\nthe beginnings of an idea. When artists speak, they generally focus on what\ntheir work means. They think up a spiel they can repeat over and over, and I\nguess it\u2019s what most people want to hear. My curiosity is earthbound: Where do\nthey begin, and what do they do next, and when do they know they are finished?\nAnd more crucially: What do they do when they lose faith? Do they lose faith?\n\nIn other words, how do artists think? As I considered my flailing artistic\nefforts, I realized I was begging for entrance into the artist\u2019s head. If I\ncould somehow make the process legible, I might find making art myself less\nintimidating, and maybe what was true for me would also be true for a reader.\nAnd so I began talking to creators of every kindOne of my first conversations\nfor this project was with Stephen Sondheim. He told me had an idea for a\nnovella: \u201cWhat I wanted to do was to [construct] an absolute stream of\nconsciousness of how I arrive at, let\u2019s say, a given line or lyric or the\nbirth of a rhyme. I would write every single thought that came into my head,\nlike Molly Bloom\u2019s monologue in Ulysses.\u201d That became a prompt for the book.\nabout their thinking \u2014 step by step, agony by agony \u2014 as they made a work.\nCondensed and adapted, here are three of those conversations with the artists\nCheryl Pope and Kara Walker and the poet Louise Gl\u00fcck; the last took place\nshortly before Gl\u00fcck died in October.\n\nSo no meaning, no magic,The book is sort of anti-magic, though the mystical\nobviously enters into it. \u201cArt is a collaboration between God and the artist,\nand the less the artist does the better,\u201d said Andre Gide. I sought out to\nprove the opposite. Successful artists have talent, but talent for what? just\nthe work of it: the work of art.\n\n## Cheryl Pope Made the Baby She Couldn\u2019t Have\n\nIn 2021, the Chicago-based artist, who works in multiple media, had a\nmiscarriage, her third. The outcome devastated her. It also inspired this work\non textile, Mother and Child on Blue Mat, which she began soon after.\n\nMother and Child on Blue Mat.

Private Collection of Halla Shami Sher\n\n## Realizing she was suddenly doing a lot of planting.\n\n\u201cI took this picture a few days after the third miscarriage,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m\nin a really messed-up space here. One of my ways of coping, I realized later,\nwas that I started amping up my plant life at home. Like, Yes, I lost these\nbabies, but I can grow things. I was repotting everything.\u201d She took the\npictures because she thought that the planting might \u201cbe telling me\nsomething\u201cThe way an image comes forward, I don\u2019t have a map for that. I have\nmy mind just going and then all of a sudden, I start to visualize it.\nSometimes I think of myself as an employee of this,\u201d she said, pointing to her\nhead. \u201cWhoever up here comes up with the idea, I am just the laborer. It\nbecomes a blur. I don\u2019t even remember much because I\u2019m in such a neurotic\nobsessive state.\u201d In making this work, she described herself as \u201cderanged.\u201d As\nshe relayed this story, she teared up. .\u201d\n\nA photo she took just a few days after the miscarriage, repotting plants.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Cheryl Pope\n\n## Imagining what she\u2019d lost.\n\n\u201cThis was the first one I did, maybe three days after the miscarriage. I\u2019d had\nan image I\u2019d been working on when I was pregnant of me sitting on the bath. I\ntook it out, and I see she\u2019s sitting on the bath because she\u2019s washing\nsomeone; everything was composed for a child to be there. My partner had been\nvery against me drawing any images with the child until I had the child. But\nonce I\u2019d had that third miscarriage, I\u2019d imagined this so many times I wanted\nto give myself the gift of seeing what I had imagined. What I wanted to\nhappen, what I imagined would happen, what didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nShe started this image, with no child in the tub, when she was still pregnant.\nAfter the miscarriage, she added the child. Photo: Courtesy of the artist and\nMonique Meloche Gallery.\n\n## Getting the image right.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to begin what became Mother and Child on a Blue Mat, I couldn\u2019t\nfind the plant picture in my phone, but I remembered it. So I re-created the\nscene and took several pictures of it. What I liked about this version was\nthis shape with her leaning down. I\u2019m starting to make an oval.\u201d\n\nWhen she couldn\u2019t find the repotting picture on her phone, she re-created it,\nplaying with the form of her body until she got a shape she liked. Photo:\nCourtesy of the artist and Monique Meloche Gallery.\n\n## Giving herself permission.\n\nShe translated the photo composition to felt and tentatively placed a child in\nthe image, almost as an imagined witness to the mother and the plant. \u201cWhen I\nlooked at the photo, it was almost like I was talking to this baby that wasn\u2019t\nthere. Where is the child \u2014 the child was absent, but was it present in the\nplant? Do I put the child where the plant was? I\u2019m asking myself these\nquestions, and then I started to do some research. I realized that Mary\nCassatt, who is the go-to painter for mothers and children \u2014 she also didn\u2019t\nhave any children herself. She gave me the freedom to say, \u2018I can do this.\u2019\nThose miscarriages were my motherhood. So I made this drawing. I love\ncomposition, composition makes any work work \u2014 the psychology, the feeling of\na work for me, is in the composition. I was interested in this circle and this\nlarger circle. And I started to get this anxiety, like, Why is she picking up\nthe plant? I want to pick up the baby.\u201d\n\nShe then did the composition on felt, adding the form of a baby. She realized\nshe wanted to hold the baby, not the plant. Photo: Courtesy of the artist and\nMonique Meloche Gallery.\n\n## Moving the baby.\n\n\u201cAnd I was going to leave it like that, but I had a call with a friend who\nalso had a miscarriage. While I\u2019m talking to her, I\u2019m looking at the image.\nAnd I got off the phone and I just moved the baby over: Let me just draw him\nover here. But I didn\u2019t want to surrender the other drawing yet. This may be\nTMI, but I draw when I\u2019m ovulating because I\u2019m the most sensual. So my time\nwindow matters with these. And I record the image because I think I really\nlike this, too. I like this echo, I like this as a misplace.\u201d\n\nShe added a second baby and toyed with keeping both. Photo: Courtesy of the\nartist and Monique Meloche Gallery\n\nShe plays with the introduction of an illogic to the work by including a baby\nand its phantom, but eventually she decides to just have one baby in the\nimage.Though she put the picture with two babies aside, she knew she would use\nthe picture of the two babies again someday. (And \u201cactually now,\u201d she said, \u201cI\nfind I like that picture better than where I landed.\u201d ) Lesson: Never waste a\ngood idea. The plant and the baby switch places: \u201cThey still make this nice\ncircle.\u201d The circle is important because she sees the three miscarriages as a\ncycle. \u201cThat\u2019s why the composition is circular. I\u2019m circling around this, I\ncan\u2019t get out of it.\u201d The tenuous embrace between the mother and the child was\nalso important to her. \u201cIn the same way that with mothers, there\u2019s this\nongoing relationship of the child disconnecting from the mother, I\u2019m also\nthinking about connection and disconnection between the real and the imagined\nin my own situation with the child. This child did disconnect from me\nalready.\u201d\n\n## Filling it in.\n\n\u201cColor has to start to work with composition; it controls the way I move my\neye. Someone asked Kerry James Marshall once, \u201cWhy did you make that rug a\npattern?\u201d I think his answer was that otherwise it would be boring. Pattern\nkeeps the eye irritated, active. So we stay engaged longer. I\u2019m not following\ncolor theory; it\u2019s just intuition.\u201d She wrestled with decisions: \u201cShould I\nleave the floor white? Do I want to leave her hair like this?\u201d And especially:\n\u201cHow much do I keep telling and not telling in this image?\u201d\n\nAfter she settled on the position of the baby (and keeping just one), she had\nto decide how to fill in the details, especially the faces. Photo: Courtesy of\nCheryl Pope.\n\nOf particular worry was the skin color of the child. Her former partner, the\nbaby\u2019s father, is Black. She is white. \u201cMy anxiety is hyped up because I am\nworried about how people are going to read race in the picture.\u201d She tried to\nput a softer brown rather than black to make him look mixed race, but it\ndoesn\u2019t work. \u201cI\u2019m well aware that a child is born lighter and can get\ndarker,\u201d she said. But she is worried that because she\u2019s white, viewers will\nthink she doesn\u2019t know this. \u201cI have to tell everything in this one image,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for nuance in this political climate. And that\u2019s\nsuffocating.\u201d\n\n## Deciding on a face.\n\nOf all the decisions she had to make for this work, the hardest might have\nbeen the decision to give faces to the mother and baby, or not \u2014 to make the\npicture specific or to generalize, to close it, in her words, or to open it. I\nfound this particular quandary \u2014 what to make explicit and what to make the\nviewer/reader work for \u2014 ever present across media. And how to anticipate \u2014\nand manipulate \u2014 what the audience will fill in has become a front-and-center\nquestion in my own painting. \u201cFinally,\u201d she said, after much deliberation, \u201cI\ngo all the way.\u201d She gave both the mother and the child a face.\n\nThe final face of the child, which she came to regret. Photo: Courtesy of\nCheryl Pope\n\nEven after she was done, she had regrets about having included the baby\u2019s\nface: \u201cLater, when I looked at the piece, I went back to the gallery to take\nit down because it just tells everything. Everything is told here. But it was\ntoo late. Because then it became public.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you were to do the picture again, you\u2019d do it without facial features on\nthe child?\u201d I asked her. \u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d she said.\n\n## Louise Gl\u00fcck Kept Waiting\n\nAt the height of COVID isolation, the Nobel Prize\u2013winning poet was at work on\nthe volume that would become Winter Recipes From the Collection, but she\nneeded a poem that would unlock the volume. That poem was \u201cSong.\u201d\n\nRehearsing lines for \u201cSong,\u201d including the crucial \u201cnever again \u2014 that we do\nnot say,\u201d which became \u201cNever again: / that is what we do not say.\u201d Photo:\nCourtesy of Louise Gl\u00fcck\n\n## Dreaming up Leo.\n\nAdam Moss: How did this poem begin for you?\n\nLouise Gl\u00fcck: There\u2019s that piece of paper in the notebook that says, \u201cLeo Cruz\nhas white bowls, I think I must get some to you.\u201d Those lines appeared to me\nin a dream. I remember waking up and writing them down and thinking, This is a\ngold mine. If you recited it to someone, they\u2019d say, \u201cWhat?\u201d There\u2019s nothing\ndistinguished about this sentence. But to me, it was one of the most beautiful\nlines I\u2019d ever written in my life. And of course it was altered in the final\nversion. But I had a sense when I woke up that day that I had something on the\nline \u2014 some very large fish was toying with me under the water.\n\nAM: Do you know why?\n\n\u201cThe fire is alive\u201d appears in the notebook to the left as well as on this\nsticky note, which she wrote during a faculty meeting. Photo: Reprinted by\npermission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux. All Rights Reserved.\n\nLG: I think that it was partly the proper name.As she was talking to me, I\nnoticed that a line in her notebook identifies the character as Lucas Cruz,\nnot Leo. \u201cIs Leo the one that came to you in the dream? \u201c I asked. \u201cNo, I must\nhave changed it,\u201d she replied. She thought for a moment. \u201cI think I wanted\nsomething that would sound more Southwestern, or Spanish. And Lucas Cruz? The\ns and z repeated each other. And Leo doesn\u2019t sound as arbitrarily named. Not\nthat I went through that laborious thought process.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the only time\nthat the artifacts showed how the artists misremembered. The mind plays tricks\n(which was true in so many contexts of the book). I know no one by that name.\nNobody knows who Leo Cruz is. And if no one knows who he is, no one knows\nwhere to find him. So there was that sense of something \u2014 or someone \u2014 who\nexists, but you can\u2019t get to him. And obviously this is a poem written during\nCOVID with all the terror and longing of that time. But I didn\u2019t want to write\na poem that was explicit; I wanted more of a parable. And I saw something in\nthose two lines about what the last year and a half has been. The poem\ndeveloped from them. There were a lot of false leads. But you write them all\ndown because you don\u2019t know what will, despite its present clumsiness,\nactually be the most important element of the poem. So that\u2019s how it began.\nAnd early on I got the last line. It had to do with the kiln \u2014 the fire\u2019s\nstill alive. I was very excited about that line, too. So then I had two\npieces.\n\n## Gathering fragments.\n\nAM: So you had the first line and you had the last line. Did you start taking\npractical steps toward turning them into a poem?\n\nLG: I don\u2019t do it like that. I have to have a lot of points in the narrative\nline before I can sit down and try to play out the progression. And even then,\nonce I have a draft, that sequence might change. But at the very beginning,\nwhen I have only a fragment of language or even two pieces that seem related,\nI just, in a sense, ignore them. But the ignoring allows for a kind of\nhaunting. And so I was haunted by them in that period. Because I couldn\u2019t go\nto the gym and I was taking long walks every day. So strange, Jesus, what a\nyear ...\n\nI would take my walks and I would almost hum the poem in my head. I had worked\nout a different version for the opening line. I tried writing in my head\nelaborations of the bowls, what they looked like, but that was just talking.\nWhen you do that, you\u2019re sort of waiting to write a good line,\u201cFor me, the\nreally hard thing about writing is how much patience you need to have,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cI mean, you can will things, but whenever I tried to do that, the poem\njust goes to hell. If you want a discovery that will surprise you too, you\njust have to wait.\u201d and then you can actually erase all the intervening lines.\nYou\u2019re looking for momentum.\n\nSomewhere along the line, I wrote, \u201cnever again, that is what we do not say,\u201d\nand it was pivotal. The \u201cnever again\u201d absolute is balanced by \u201cthat is what we\ndo not say.\u201d The idea of \u201cnever again\u201d hovers in the air, but the refusal to\nsay it is an unwillingness to capitulate to the absolute. As long as life\ncontinues anywhere, life continues.\n\n## Curing it of \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nAM: It seems to me, looking at the notebook pages, that one of the things you\nwere working out is how explicit to be at the point where Leo Cruz explains\nthe purpose of imagination. In the notes, there\u2019s a line \u201cbecause intention is\nmore moving than effortless splendor.\u201d\n\nHere, she toggles between \u201cLeo\u201d and \u201cLucas,\u201d which is actually the first name\nthat came to her in the dream, for Cruz. Down the page, \u201cGod\u201d was eventually\nbanished. Photo: Courtesy of Louise Gl\u00fcck\n\nLG: Oh God, that\u2019s pretty bad. That became \u201cthe things man makes / are more\nbeautiful / than what exists in nature.\u201d\n\nAM: Earlier it was \u201cthe things God makes.\u201d You substituted nature for God at\nsome point.\n\nLG: The rhythm of the sentence remained. But initially the sweeping statement\n(once it was cured of God) was the poem\u2019s pronouncement. \u201cLeo thinks\u201d was\nadded later. This change showed me how to do the poem as a back-and-forth.\nSomeone is wandering across the desert with a book of grasses, and Leo is\nsomewhere making white bowls. And somehow there is a conversation between them\nthat\u2019s either remembered or invented because it is obviously not occurring\nwithin the space of the poem. I liked that the future exists in the poem \u2014 we\nmake plans to walk the hills together, or whatever I ended up saying. That was\nthe last bit I figured out. I had a lot of really bad plans. And I had the\nwhole poem. But I had that clunker in the middle.\n\nAM: But you knew its function in the poem, right?\n\nLG: I knew that in order to do the \u201cnever again,\u201d there had to be a plan. At\nsome point it was \u201cI make plans,\u201d or \u201cI plan,\u201d or \u201cI tell him I\u2019m going to\n...\u201d These were all variants. And then on your long walk \u2014 the same walk every\nday like a prisoner \u2014 you repeat these phrases, and sooner or later they get\nfixed. But you don\u2019t feel as though you fixed them; something in your head\nfixes them. And when you get the thing right, you begin to see the shape\nemerge. And the more the shape emerges, the faster you can work. This poem was\nwritten pretty rapidly but for that recalcitrant stanza.\n\n## Finding hopefulness.\n\nAM: These pages that we\u2019re looking at, when you take these walks, do you come\nback to your house and just scribble?\n\nLG: Sometimes I write things down on the walks. It\u2019s important to me not to\ncarry a notebook.She did keep a notebook. A physical trainer she had gone to\nafter a whiplash injury said, \u201cGet a notebook and write in it every day. And\nyou\u2019ll discover you\u2019re not in as much pain as you think.\u201d Which was not what\nshe discovered: \u201cThis journal ... was a long sustained wail about the body. In\nthe early days of my whiplash anguish, I wasn\u2019t writing at all. And then I\nfound that when I was up at night writing in my pain journal, I would get a\nline for a poem. But I didn\u2019t want to get mixed up in the text of the\njournal.\u201d The pain journal would begin from the front. And the poem lines\nwould start on the last page. \u201cAnd the two things met in the middle.\u201d If you\ncarry a notebook, the walk becomes too purposeful. I take this magical\nthinking very seriously.\n\nI was taken out of high school in my senior year because I was acutely\nanorexic. When I stopped starving myself, I started exercising; I walked all\nday, literally, every day. I\u2019d stop in at the bakery and borrow a pen and\npiece of paper. Well, I kept the paper. Because carrying supplies seemed to me\ndangerous. A jinx. Now I carry a pen. But no notebook. If I write something\ndown, I write on a receipt. When I was 18, I could count on remembering. Now I\nneed backup. But I still believe the really good lines will return when they\nare part of something. There\u2019s something in your head that doesn\u2019t forget.\n\nAM: Weeds out the bad and selects the good.\n\nLG: Well, we like to think so.\n\nAM: That\u2019s a very hopeful idea itself.\n\nThe final poem.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nLG: Well, I\u2019m actually very hopeful. I know most of the people who read my\npoems think I\u2019m not. I mean, I have a very tragic vision of human life, but\nI\u2019m very optimistic in the short term. And I like to have a good time. No one\nwould believe this. But it\u2019s true.\n\nMost people who have talked about this book talk about its gloom, its\ngrimness. But that to me is not what it is at all. It\u2019s a survival manual: The\nfire is still alive. It isn\u2019t about survival as in trudging up a slow incline\nhopelessly. It\u2019s about survival as a kind of triumph, which is how I see it.\n\nDespite everything in the dream, the fire is still alive. The belief in the\nfire survives all of these impossibilities: You can\u2019t see Leo Cruz again, you\ncan\u2019t have white bowls, you can\u2019t see the desert grasses. But you have a book\nand can live in imagination. And that\u2019s not nothing.\n\n## Kara Walker Asked, \u201cYou, Who Are You?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s 2013, two years since the artist\u2019s last big show and a creatively dormant\ntime, when the arts organization Creative Time approaches her to create a\nsite-specific installation in the old Domino Sugar factory. She has never made\na public sculpture before. But what to make?\n\nA Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby. Photo: Photo: Jason Wyche. Artwork \u00a9\n2014 Kara Walker\n\n## Casting about.\n\nCreative Time didn\u2019t say anything about what they were looking for. So I had a\nsketchbook, and I kept asking myself, What about this, or this, or this? I was\noverwhelmed.\u201cVisiting the refinery, she said, \u201cI was pretty floored. But I was\ntrying to think of an analogy earlier,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like flood gates\nopened, dadada, but I can\u2019t swim. It ushered in this huge flood of\npossibility. And then I was tumbling around in that, trying to conjure magical\nsort of inflatables in order to survive.\u201d For a couple of those months, I\ncouldn\u2019t figure out how to begin. I\u2019d see something on TV and be like, What\nabout that? For a while, I was thinking of some kind of conveyor, one material\ntransforming into another material. And chickens. I don\u2019t know why. And then I\nalso was thinking about waste products, the effect of the sugar on the Domino\nplant, the heavy molasses smell. And about oil and other by-products and the\noverreliance we have on things that are bad for us. And then finally I said to\nmyself, You, who are you, Kara?Though Walker is expressing general impatience\nwith herself here, I think she is also alluding to the thing that makes her\nher. At this time, she was trying to move away from the antebellum silhouettes\nthat made her famous and toward something that still felt particular to her.\nIn the course of my conversations, I noticed that artists have different\nattitudes about their signatures \u2014 whatever you want to call it: a style of\nexpression that is them as surely as is a fingerprint or the way they sign\ntheir name. Some run away from it, some toward it. In making A Subtlety, Kara\nWalker was doing both. Stop sketching stuff. The deadline for my idea was fast\napproaching.\n\nOne of the first sketches she made after seeing the Domino Sugar factory space\nfor the first time. Photo: \u00a9 Kara Walker\n\n## Making a PowerPoint.\n\nSo I put together this PowerPoint, which confused everybody at Creative Time.\nBut the PowerPoint was the only sketch I approved of. I couldn\u2019t trust my hand\nto draw the thing I was trying to articulate because it just wants to make\nthings cute.\n\nSlides from the PowerPoint she gave to Creative Time to illustrate her\nthinking. She still had no idea what she was going to make. Photo: Courtesy of\nKara Walker\n\nThe PowerPoint was a way of synthesizing material, but it also has a rhythm\nand a poetry to it. I was gathering images that included the chickens but then\nwent into voodoo and rum and sugar and the transatlantic slave trade. I\nstarted to read about the process of sugar refining and that it\u2019s not a given\nthat sugar should exist in the world. I started to think about my role as an\nartist in relation to doing a big public-art project. I got interested in men\nlike the sugar magnate Henry Osborne Havemeyer. Those are the gods of\nindustry. That\u2019s really what I have to imagine myself to be.\n\nWalker ended her PowerPoint with a pole dancer, connecting sugar to sex and\ndesire. Photo: Courtesy of Kara Walker\n\nThe last piece of the PowerPoint started with sugar and brown sugar, and then\nI added a pole dancer. And it sort of ends with ruins \u2014 a sugar-refinery\nexplosion in Savannah that was entirely caused by sugar crystals in the air.\nWhat to do with ruins? We romanticize them. We celebrate them. We go on\nvacation in them. We make them a public sort of entertainment.\n\n## Finding Sidney Mintz.\n\nThe one thing that really changed everything was Sidney Mintz\u2019s book on the\nhistory of sugar. The sexuality of sugar was already in my head. Plus the\nliquid stickiness of it just seemed really potent as a sexual symbol. But the\nMintz book put the exclamation point on the fact that sugar has been about\ndesire ever since it was refined. Before sugar, you got sweetness from fruit\nor honey. The sugar high is a real high, like gold, like a spice worth its\nweight in gold. So only the powerful had access to it. And the quest for that\nparticular sweetness, it generated my history, it generated the transatlantic\nslave trade.\n\n## Becoming the distiller.\n\nAnd so the PowerPoint is what I gave Creative Time. I said, \u201cI think I\u2019m\ngetting closer.\u201d And they were like, \u201cWhat is it, exactly? Is it going to be a\nslideshow?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, no, this isn\u2019t the piece!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how to explain the magic process \u2014 maybe it\u2019s not magic but\nsomething that switches. I thought, You know, Kara, you\u2019re an artist. You\u2019re\nkind of a distiller yourself. You have to take all of this information, those\nimpulses, and make some sort of icon, and it has to be something you have no\nchoice about. The time for playing is over. And I\u2019m feeling now I know what\nthe material is. I feel the material. It\u2019s not just an intellectual pursuit.\nIt lives in my body.\n\n## Seeing the Sphinx.\n\nI was on the Q train reading the Sidney Mintz book. And there\u2019s a section\nwhere he talks about the \u201csubtleties\u201d \u2014 these special decorative sugar\nornaments for kings, for the celebration of weddings ... And you know, we\u2019re\nso used to sugar we don\u2019t even realize how special sugar is ... And I was just\nlike, Oh, it\u2019s a sugar sculpture! And I realized the Sphinx was the perfect\nsort of ruin. And that was the big moment. From that point on, the drawings\nare drawn with molasses, stuck together.\n\nShe realized later she\u2019d been thinking about these images for a long time: Her\ngallerist Michael Jenkins found a drawing she made in the late \u201990s. Photo: \u00a9\nKara Walker\n\nOnce Walker settled on sugar as her building material, she began experimenting\nwith drawing with molasses. Photo: \u00a9 Kara Walker\n\nAnd I thought, It can\u2019t just be a Sphinx, because then it only reads on that\none note. We have to open it up to all these other sorts of desires that sugar\nexploits and represents. And our covetousness for sugar is not unlike\nsexualized covetousness. So it had to be a female, larger-than-life queen\nfigure with everything open and bare and bare-breasted.\n\nThe sugar baby in two dimensions. Photo: \u00a9 Kara Walker\n\n## Becoming a sculptor.\n\nThe Sphinx was going to be the main sculpture. And so now I had to build a\nsculpture, and that was terrible. The first iteration at my studio, I was so\nembarrassed. I don\u2019t know how to do sculpture. So let me just make a table-\nsize one of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. And the first one collapsed. That kind of thing can\nbe a big setback. I felt, I don\u2019t know how to do anything. Who do you think\nyou are? So then I made a smaller little clay Sphinx figure. And I took a\nlittle snapshot with the refinery behind it. And I had a model of the space,\nlike a little foam-core model. Creative Time helped me facilitate how it could\nget made; I just knew it should be an object, monumental, something grand.\n\nA scale model constructed in her studio. Photo: \u00a9 Kara Walker\n\n## Finding the sugar boys.\n\nI started looking stuff up, and I found these little \u201csugar boys\u201d sculptures\nonline \u2014 candy dishes. And I thought, These are appalling. I don\u2019t know how I\nfound those boys. My studio was in the Garment District for so long, so I\nalways happened to pass by shops that had tchotchkes in the window, like\nAfrican-queen kind of figurines. And I thought, These are kind of strange; why\nare these being made? Who buys them \u2014 besides me, apparently? And then I\nthought these boys could be attendant figures.\n\n## Working with sugar.\n\nI wanted them made as candy sculptures, made of sugar. I\u2019m thinking everything\nis going to be made of sugar. And basically it became, What is possible, what\nis not possible? What is achievable in the time frame? What is achievable\nfinancially? In physics? At a certain point, everything was achievable. We\njust had to say what it was. So it was this giant sugar sculpture and these\ncandy figurines at a human scale. I didn\u2019t ever have the specific notion that\nit would melt. That just sort of came with it. I knew it would be an unstable\nobject. But we didn\u2019t really know how unstable until we started making them.\n\nIt was all trial and error because nobody had ever done it. People had made\nsmaller sugar sculptures, and there were people in the candy business, of\ncourse, and bakers. But when we started asking around for how to do this, they\nsaid, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work.\u201d The first one, when we made the molds \u2014 well,\nlet me first explain that it\u2019s easy to make candy; it\u2019s sugar and water and\ntemperature. It just has to reach the hard ball stage, when you can pour it\ninto the mold and let it sit. But for us, the molds were so big and the\ntemperature was so hot it never cooled in the interior. So the first one, we\ntook it out of the mold, and at about six o\u2019clock that evening it was a\npuddle.\n\n## Compromising.\n\nEventually, we thought maybe we have to do some of these in resin, some in\nresin and some in candy. Okay, compromise. Don\u2019t love it, but maybe it will\ncreate the effect. So we made as many of these sugar boys as we could. And\nthen the day before the opening, a truck backed into one of them, maybe two of\nthem got knocked over. Oh my God, that was bad. I don\u2019t know if you remember,\nbut some of the figures have figures inside their baskets. I just picked up\nthe broken pieces of the ones that had fallen and put them in the baskets of\nthe ones who were standing.\n\n## Making it hers.\n\nThe building process, when that actually started, that was amazing. I\u2019d have\nfits of giggles because I just couldn\u2019t believe we were doing this. Just\nstepping into the space ... I don\u2019t know how to describe it really. It was\nintimidating. It was, Is this mine? I had to go back in there and figure out\nhow to make it mine. There were some things I literally couldn\u2019t do. I wasn\u2019t\nreally capable of moving giant blocks of polystyrene. So I would go over there\nregularly and talk with the team that was shaping everything. It wasn\u2019t until\nthe last phase of it, the last four weeks, that I felt I was really doing\nsomething.As Walker was describing creating A Subtlety, her preoccupation was\nwith getting the idea of it right. And she was concerned with technical\nproblems regarding its physical construction. But listening to her, you might\nhave thought it was a building project rather than an artwork: At no point did\nshe seem concerned with how to give it its visual power, which to me was such\nan important factor in its impact. This was true for many of the accounts\ngiven to me by the artists in the book, and it kept surprising me. Is it\nexperience that gives them faith that once they solve the intellectual\nproblems at hand, the expression of it \u2014 the art part \u2014 will take care of\nitself?\n\nThe work was ephemeral; it melted. \u201cWhat is the purpose of a monumental\nsculpture on a grand scale but to be destroyed?\u201d says Walker. \u201cI had my\nmoments when I thought, Well, maybe I shouldn\u2019t, but I felt ickier holding on\nto it than letting go.\u201d Photo: \u00a9 Kara Walker\n\n## Watching the response.\n\nOn May 10, it opened. My daughter went to see it a couple of days before. And\nthere\u2019s a picture of her when she first gets into the space, laughing, which\nresonated for me because it reminded me so much of my first experience when I\npresented the work. There was the not seeing of it. People walked into the\nfactory, and they were like, \u201cWow, wow, wow, look at all the sugar boys.\u201d And\nthen suddenly it was there. And they didn\u2019t know there would be a big thing\nthere. They were just like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d And I found that very satisfying. So\nmy teenage daughter walked in there and I sort of pointed to it. We were\nstanding in front of it, just looking. You walk around the sculpture, and it\nkeeps changing shape and meaning in the viewer\u2019s eye and mind \u2014 I mean\nhopefully. And maybe it sort of elicits some of those harder feelings that I\nwas thinking about as I was making it \u2014 I hope so. I was trying to materialize\nand manifest the feeling of the histories I wanted to talk about. I had\ningested that. I had done something that affected me, and I knew what it was.\nI knew the effect I wanted it to have. And that was it.\n\nI don\u2019t know about anything, really. I always feel like I\u2019m a novice and I\u2019m\njust starting out, and even if I have to make work similar to work I\u2019ve\nalready made, cut paper or something, it\u2019s a lot like starting from zero.\n\nAdapted from The Work of Art: How Something Comes From Nothing (Penguin\nPress), out April 16.\n\nThank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism.

It\u2019s what I did for my career \u2014 and it\u2019s also an essential part of\nartistic-decision-making, but it can be brutal. Artists use the phrase often\nto talk about a stage after the imagination has \u201cvomited\u201d (another phrase\nartists use often) and before the hard-core, skills-based crafting can begin.\nOne of my first conversations for this project was with Stephen Sondheim. He\ntold me had an idea for a novella: \u201cWhat I wanted to do was to [construct] an\nabsolute stream of consciousness of how I arrive at, let\u2019s say, a given line\nor lyric or the birth of a rhyme. I would write every single thought that came\ninto my head, like Molly Bloom\u2019s monologue in Ulysses.\u201d That became a prompt\nfor the book. The book is sort of anti-magic, though the mystical obviously\nenters into it. \u201cArt is a collaboration between God and the artist, and the\nless the artist does the better,\u201d said Andre Gide. I sought out to prove the\nopposite. Successful artists have talent, but talent for what? \u201cThe way an\nimage comes forward, I don\u2019t have a map for that. I have my mind just going\nand then all of a sudden, I start to visualize it. Sometimes I think of myself\nas an employee of this,\u201d she said, pointing to her head. \u201cWhoever up here\ncomes up with the idea, I am just the laborer. It becomes a blur. I don\u2019t even\nremember much because I\u2019m in such a neurotic obsessive state.\u201d In making this\nwork, she described herself as \u201cderanged.\u201d As she relayed this story, she\nteared up. Though she put the picture with two babies aside, she knew she\nwould use the picture of the two babies again someday. (And \u201cactually now,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cI find I like that picture better than where I landed.\u201d ) Lesson:\nNever waste a good idea. I found this particular quandary \u2014 what to make\nexplicit and what to make the viewer/reader work for \u2014 ever present across\nmedia. And how to anticipate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 what the audience will fill in\nhas become a front-and-center question in my own painting. As she was talking\nto me, I noticed that a line in her notebook identifies the character as Lucas\nCruz, not Leo. \u201cIs Leo the one that came to you in the dream? \u201c I asked. \u201cNo,\nI must have changed it,\u201d she replied. She thought for a moment. \u201cI think I\nwanted something that would sound more Southwestern, or Spanish. And Lucas\nCruz? The s and z repeated each other. And Leo doesn\u2019t sound as arbitrarily\nnamed. Not that I went through that laborious thought process.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the\nonly time that the artifacts showed how the artists misremembered. The mind\nplays tricks (which was true in so many contexts of the book). \u201cFor me, the\nreally hard thing about writing is how much patience you need to have,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cI mean, you can will things, but whenever I tried to do that, the poem\njust goes to hell. If you want a discovery that will surprise you too, you\njust have to wait.\u201d She did keep a notebook. A physical trainer she had gone\nto after a whiplash injury said, \u201cGet a notebook and write in it every day.\nAnd you\u2019ll discover you\u2019re not in as much pain as you think.\u201d Which was not\nwhat she discovered: \u201cThis journal ... was a long sustained wail about the\nbody. In the early days of my whiplash anguish, I wasn\u2019t writing at all. And\nthen I found that when I was up at night writing in my pain journal, I would\nget a line for a poem. But I didn\u2019t want to get mixed up in the text of the\njournal.\u201d The pain journal would begin from the front. And the poem lines\nwould start on the last page. \u201cAnd the two things met in the middle.\u201d\n\u201cVisiting the refinery, she said, \u201cI was pretty floored. But I was trying to\nthink of an analogy earlier,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like flood gates opened,\ndadada, but I can\u2019t swim. It ushered in this huge flood of possibility. And\nthen I was tumbling around in that, trying to conjure magical sort of\ninflatables in order to survive.\u201d Though Walker is expressing general\nimpatience with herself here, I think she is also alluding to the thing that\nmakes her her. At this time, she was trying to move away from the antebellum\nsilhouettes that made her famous and toward something that still felt\nparticular to her. In the course of my conversations, I noticed that artists\nhave different attitudes about their signatures \u2014 whatever you want to call\nit: a style of expression that is them as surely as is a fingerprint or the\nway they sign their name. Some run away from it, some toward it. In making A\nSubtlety, Kara Walker was doing both. As Walker was describing creating A\nSubtlety, her preoccupation was with getting the idea of it right.

This was true\nfor many of the accounts given to me by the artists in the book, and it kept\nsurprising me. Is it experience that gives them faith that once they solve the\nintellectual problems at hand, the expression of it \u2014 the art part \u2014 will take\ncare of itself?\n\n### Tags:\n\n  * remove interruptions\n  * vulture homepage lede\n  * the work of art\n  * art\n  * chapters\n  * book excerpt\n  * books\n  * new york magazine\n  * one great story\n  * More\n\nShow 10 Comments / 10 New Leave a Comment\n\nHow\u2019d You Make That?\n\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n### Most Viewed Stories\n\n  1.
