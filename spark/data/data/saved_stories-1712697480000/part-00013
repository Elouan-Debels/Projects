Alloy is a telemetry collector that is 100% OTLP compatible and\noffers native pipelines for OpenTelemetry and Prometheus telemetry formats,\nsupporting metrics, logs, traces, and profiles.\n\nSome of you may be thinking: Wait, another collector?\n\nHear us out: What makes Alloy stand out among the growing ecosystem of\ncollectors is that it\u2019s an open source tool that combines all the\nobservability signals that are vital to run combined infrastructure and\napplication monitoring workloads at scale.\n\nWe\u2019ve built Alloy on the foundation of our work with Grafana Agent, while also\nincorporating lessons learned from some of the toughest use cases we\u2019ve seen\nover the years. As a result, Alloy \u2014 which is production ready and will be\nreleased as v1.0 \u2014 is broadly compatible with the most popular open source\ntelemetry signals. Plus it includes enterprise-grade features \u2014 such as native\nclustering for production at scale and built-in Vault support for enhanced\nsecurity \u2014 all out of the box.\n\nOverall, Alloy is an extension of our \u201cbig tent\u201d philosophy at Grafana Labs,\nwhere disparate data sources, from different software providers, in different\nindustries, built for different use cases, can come together in a composable\nobservability platform. We believe that organizations should own their\nobservability strategy, choose their own tools, and have the freedom to bring\nall their data together in one view. Grafana Alloy helps you achieve just that\nas a telemetry collector that\u2019s compatible with a suite of different signals\nthat can meet a wide array of different needs.\n\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at the features offered in Grafana Alloy \u2014 and the\ncontinued innovation that you can expect from our latest OSS project.\n\n> ## From Agent to Alloy\n>\n> Grafana Agent, our existing OSS telemetry agent, and Grafana Agent Operator\n> are now deprecated and will enter into Long-Term Support (LTS) beginning\n> today (April 9, 2024). This means both Grafana Agent and Grafana Agent\n> Operator will no longer receive any new feature updates, but they will\n> receive critical bug fixes and security fixes. Commercial support will end\n> after the LTS phase, which we anticipate will extend for about 18 months\n> until October 31, 2025. End-of-Life (EOL) phase for Grafana Agent and\n> Grafana Agent Operator will begin once LTS ends. Grafana Agent and the\n> Grafana Agent Operator are expected to reach EOL on November 1, 2025.\n>\n> We recommend that you begin planning your transition towards the new Grafana\n> Alloy collector. To learn more, check out our Agent to Alloy FAQ blog post.\n\n## OpenTelemetry and Prometheus telemetry with Alloy\n\nAccording to Grafana Labs\u2019 2024 Observability Survey, an overwhelming majority\nof respondents report that they are investing in Prometheus (89%) or\nOpenTelemetry (85%). Almost 40% of respondents use both in production, and\nmore than 50% increased their usage of both projects over the past year.\n\nAnd it makes sense why. Prometheus is still the most mature ecosystem for core\ninfrastructure monitoring use cases, with more than 10,000 exporters and\nintegrations in the wild that have been built by the open source community\nover the past decade. Then there\u2019s OpenTelemetry, which has been omnipresent\nin the past year, especially when the project went GA at KubeCon last November\nand with the recent addition of profiling as an OpenTelemetry signal.\n\nWe believe that the most operationally sound observability system looks like a\nblend of these two leading open source technologies. Alloy is compatible with\nboth the OpenTelemetry Collector and Prometheus Agent, which means it can be\nused as an alternative to either of these solutions or combined into a hybrid\nsystem of multiple collectors and agents. Alloy can also accept existing\nvanilla OpenTelemetry Collector and Prometheus Agent configuration files\nnatively or convert them automatically to the Alloy configuration syntax for\nadvanced use cases.\n\nAlloy can also be used with Grafana Cloud or any compatible backend from other\nvendors. You can configure Alloy with your observability solution to fit on-\nprem, cloud only, or a mix of both. It\u2019s also flexible enough to cater to\ndifferent users, large and small, at different phases of their observability\njourney.\n\n## Alloy: More than observability signals\n\nAlloy, however, is not just about telemetry data. We created Alloy to do much\nmore:\n\n  * Production-ready pipelines: Alloy modules can distill an unwieldy, large config file into a single module that\u2019s just a few lines, which enables SREs to get started immediately.\n  * GitOps-friendly: Alloy introduces a framework that can pull configs from anywhere, such as GitHub, Amazon S3, and HTTP endpoints.\n  * Built for scale: With built-in native clustering, fleets of collectors can work together for better workload distribution and high availability against pull-based workloads. You\u2019ll be able to create horizontally scalable deployments with minimal resource and operational overhead.\n  * Security: Users can connect to a HashiCorp Vault server to retrieve secrets in order to avoid managing authentication credentials and tokens locally.\n  * Debugging utilities: Alloy allows users to easily troubleshoot issues at configuration with an embedded UI that\u2019s viewable from the Alloy HTTP server.\n\n## Alloy + Grafana Cloud\n\nAlloy can work in any self-managed use case, but it\u2019s also a natural companion\nwith Grafana Cloud.\n\nBy pairing Alloy with Grafana Cloud, users can leverage an opinionated\nobservability solution that\u2019s built on top of the very best open source\nobservability projects. Alloy makes it even easier to connect all your\ntelemetry data to Grafana Cloud to power these solutions:\n\n  1. Grafana Cloud Collector UI: The brand new home for Alloy to easily manage your connected collectors and quickly check in on their health and performance.\n  2. Application Observability: Our solution for observing and monitoring the performance of your organization\u2019s applications. Powered by Grafana Cloud, OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, and the Prometheus data model, Application Observability allows you to detect anomalies, identify root causes, and fix problems faster for a reduced MTTR. We also make it easier to instrument your applications with Alloy by directly embedding Grafana Beyla, our open source eBPF-based auto-instrumentation tool that is compatible with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus.\n  3. Kubernetes Monitoring: Our premiere solution for infrastructure monitoring that makes it easier to analyze your Kubernetes environment from the cluster level down to an individual pod. You can get started with a simple Helm chart that contains ready-to-go instructions for Alloy.\n  4. Out-of-the-box integrations: Grafana Cloud maintains a catalog of more than 100 integrations that enable monitoring instantly with prebuilt configs, dashboards, and alerts. Alloy users can mix and match between instrumenting for custom telemetry across both OpenTelemetry and Prometheus signals, combined with integrations for popular services such as Linux, AWS, Docker, and more. Expect to see full Alloy compatibility for these Grafana Cloud solutions to roll out over the coming weeks.\n\n## What\u2019s next for Grafana Alloy\n\nWe\u2019re not done yet! Following this v1.0 launch announcement, we\u2019re already\nplanning to introduce the next wave of exciting features.\n\n### Improved integration with Helm and Ansible\n\nGrafana Alloy introduces a new configuration syntax that makes it easier to\ncompose pipelines. We\u2019re actively exploring optional support for YAML-based\nsyntax to enable Alloy to better integrate with existing tooling like Helm and\nAnsible. Expect to see some news here in the coming weeks!\n\n### Fleet management\n\nFor Grafana Cloud users, expect to see a fleet management solution that\nsimplifies installation and configuration management for all your collectors.\nThe managed solution can be called via API or you can interact with it\ndirectly in a GUI. Users will then be able to create, update, and manage their\ncollector configurations centrally without having to manually edit files by\nindividual instance.\n\n### Health meta-monitoring\n\nCurrent users of Grafana Cloud may already be familiar with the Grafana Agent\nhealth integration, which makes it easy to monitor the health and performance\nof your many connected agents. We\u2019re bringing the same out-of-the-box\nexperience to Alloy within Grafana Cloud and elevating the experience beyond\njust dashboards. Expect to see a curated experience that helps you better\nunderstand the health and state of your collectors.\n\n## Get started with Grafana Alloy today\n\nWe have a series of migration guides and tools to help you easily get started\nwith Grafana Alloy.\n\n  * Migration tools and converters\n  * Migration guides, based on use case\n\nAs always, community feedback is welcome and appreciated!
