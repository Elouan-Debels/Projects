It denounces\nhow Europe is transferring hundreds of billions of taxpayers\u2019 money into the\nhands of intensive farms, which mistreat animals, pollute the environment, and\npose a potential danger for future pandemics.\n\nWith a cinematic approach for an investigative documentary, Giulia and Pablo\ntake us on an enlightening but shocking journey across Europe, where they\nconfront farmers, corporations and politicians. Their team of investigators\ninfiltrated farms in many European countries, exposing the truth behind the\nperceived excellence of European dairy and meat. In parallel, a fake agrifood\nlobbyist has infiltrated the high spheres of power at the European Parliament,\nsecretly recording MEPs and gaining shocking information.\n\n> Food for Profit not only discloses the horror of intensive farms and the\n> political corruption behind it, but with a pool of international experts, it\n> tackles and analyses the many problems related to factory farming: from\n> water pollution to exploitation of migrants and from biodiversity loss to\n> antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe film\u2019s outcry is loud and clear: we must stop this corrupt system now if\nwe want to save the planet. And ourselves, too.\n\nWatch the trailer\n\nDownload the poster\n\nDownload press book\n\nDownload assets\n\nDonate\n\n  * Documentary\n  * Screenings calendar\n  * Organise a screening\n  * Help us\n\n  * Documentary\n  * Press\n  * Our proposals\n  * Contacts\n\ninfo@foodforprofit.com \u2014 Privacy Policy \u2014 \u00a9 2024\n\nPowered by Green World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
