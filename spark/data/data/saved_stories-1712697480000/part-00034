Phone companies must pay a percentage of their revenue into the fund,\nand telcos generally pass those fees on to consumers with a \"Universal\nService\" line item on telephone bills.\n\nImposing similar assessments on broadband could increase the Universal Service\nFund's size and/or reduce the charges on phone service, spreading the burden\nmore evenly across different types of telecommunications services. Some\nconsumer advocates want the FCC to increase the fund in order to replace the\nAffordable Connectivity Program (ACP), a different government program that\ngives $30 monthly broadband discounts to people with low incomes but is about\nto run out of money because of inaction by Congress.\n\nThe Universal Service funding question is coming up now because, on April 25,\nthe FCC is scheduled to vote on reclassifying broadband as a\ntelecommunications service in order to re-impose the net neutrality rules\nscrapped during the Trump era.\n\n## Chair fears \u201cmajor upheaval\u201d\n\nImposing Universal Service charges on broadband would likely result in ISPs\nadding those costs to monthly bills and would make the net neutrality\nproceeding even more of a political minefield than it already is. FCC\nChairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's net neutrality proposal takes the same stance\nagainst requiring Universal Service contributions that the FCC took in 2015\nwhen it first imposed the net neutrality rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We conclude that forbearing from imposing new universal service contribution\nrequirements on BIAS [Broadband Internet Access Service] is in the public\ninterest,\" Rosenworcel's proposal says. \"For one thing, we agree with\ncommenters who warn that suddenly and unnecessarily imposing new fees on\nbroadband service could pose 'major upheaval in what is actually a stable and\nequitable contribution system.' Rather than risk this upheaval, we believe it\nin the public interest to proceed cautiously and incrementally.\"\n\nThe deferral of action on Universal Service funding is welcome news to cable\nlobby group NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, even though it opposes\nthe net neutrality plan overall. The NCTA has urged the FCC \"to resist calls\nfor immediate action and instead defer to Congress on the complex and\ncontroversial issues surrounding contribution reform.\" Assessments on\nbroadband \"would almost certainly result in new passed-through fees not\npreviously assessed on these services\" and \"may harm broadband adoption,\" the\nNCTA says.\n\nBroadband industry lobby group USTelecom has called for Big Tech firms to pay\ninto the Universal Service Fund, an argument that has also been made\nrepeatedly by Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr.\n\nRosenworcel may be inclined to let Congress tackle broadband contributions to\nUniversal Service. Her draft plan also raises the possibility of the FCC\naddressing the issue on its own in a separate proceeding:\n\n> Contrary to the assumption of some commenters, Commission efforts remain\n> ongoing in this area. Congress has also been actively deliberating on\n> legislative proposals to reform the USF contribution and funding mechanisms.\n> USF contribution reform is an immensely complex and delicate undertaking\n> with far-reaching consequences, and we believe that any decisions on whether\n> and how to make BIAS providers contribute to USF funding are best addressed\n> holistically in those ongoing discussions of USF contribution reform, on a\n> full record and with robust input from all interested parties, rather than\n> in this proceeding.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n35\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
