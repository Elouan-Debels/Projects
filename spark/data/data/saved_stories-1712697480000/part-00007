The two\npowers have improved their diplomatic ties since Russia launched its full-\nscale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, declaring a \"no limits\"\npartnership.\n\nThe West is \"implementing unlawful sanctions toward a number of states, Russia\nis among them of course. This policy is starting to be actively applied toward\n[China] as well,\" Lavrov said, referencing efforts by the US to restrict\nChina's access to key US-made technologies.\n\n## Plan to launch Eurasian security 'dialogue'\n\nRussia and China agreed to strengthen security cooperation across Eurasia to\ncounter US and Western influence. Lavrov said such a move had been put forward\nby Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that the two countries had agreed to\n\"start a dialogue with the involvement of our other like-minded people on this\nissue.\"\n\n\"For a long time, there was a Euro-Atlantic security structure in the form of\nNATO, of course, as well as the OSCE, but it is striking itself out from the\nlist of relevant structures within which it is possible to conduct meaningful\nnegotiations and agree on something based on a balance of interests,\" Lavrov\nsaid.\n\nMoscow and Beijing are planning on launching a \"dialogue\" on Eurasian security\nissues, but no further details were given.\n\nWang said NATO should not extend its activities in the Asia-Pacific region,\naccording to Russian news agencies.\n\nThe two countries should \"oppose hegemonism and power politics, oppose the\nmonopoly of international affairs by a few countries,\" he added.\n\n## What the West has said about China-Russia ties\n\nChina has faced increased pressure from Western nations to leverage its\ninfluence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The US has warned Beijing\nagainst providing indirect aid to Russia.\n\nIn Brussels last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters\nthat \"China continues to provide materials to support Russia's defense\nindustrial base.\"\n\nDuring a visit to China on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned\nof \"significant consequences\" for any Chinese companies supporting Russia's\nwar in Ukraine.\n\nWashington would not rule out tariffs on clean energy imports from China to\nprotect its industry, she said.\n\n## China-Russia relationship 'without borders'\n\n02:50\n\n## What the foreign ministers said about Putin and Xi\n\nLavrov and Wang both stressed their support for each other's leaders, with the\nChinese foreign minister praising \"the strong leadership of President Putin.\"\n\n\"China will support Russia's stable development under the leadership of\nPutin,\" he added.\n\nLavrov pointed out that \"Xi Jinping... was among the first ones to send\ncongratulations to the president-elect Putin\" after his reelection win last\nmonth. \"And we are overall grateful to our Chinese friends for this support.\"\n\nThe Russian minister had his turn at lavishing Chinese leader Xi Jinping when\nthe two met later on Tuesday.\n\n\"We would like to express our highest appreciation and admiration for the\nsuccesses you have achieved over the years and, above all, over the past\ndecade under your leadership,\" Lavrov told Xi, according to Reuters.\n\ntg, ab/rt (AFP, Reuters)\n\nSend us your feedback\n\nYour feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkip next section Related topics\n\n## Related topics\n\nBlack SeaBRICSDmitry MedvedevTaiwanUyghur communityRussia's partial\nmobilizationChinaRussia\n\nSkip next section DW's Top Story\n\n# DW's Top Story\n\n## Climate: ECHR judges side with Swiss group in rights ruling\n\nLaw and Justice5 hours ago5 hours ago\n\n### Why are climate activists taking 32 nations to court?\n\nNature and Environment09/27/2023September 27, 2023\n\n### 'Climate Seniors' take on Switzerland at ECHR\n\nNature and Environment03/29/2023March 29, 202301:18 min\n\n### Record hot March caps warmest 12 months on record \u2014 report\n\nClimate9 hours ago9 hours ago\n\nPage 1 of 3\n\nSkip next section More stories from DW\n\n# More stories from DW\n\n## Africa\n\n### Sudan's humanitarian crisis deepens after a year of conflict\n\n### Sudan's humanitarian crisis deepens after a year of conflict\n\nConflicts04/08/2024April 8, 2024\n\nMore from Africa\n\n## Asia\n\n### Why is China canceling US wheat shipments?\n\n### Why is China canceling US wheat shipments?\n\nBusiness5 hours ago5 hours ago\n\nMore from Asia\n\n## Germany\n\n### German Chancellor Olaf Scholz joins TikTok\n\n### German Chancellor Olaf Scholz joins TikTok\n\nSociety04/08/2024April 8, 2024\n\nMore from Germany\n\n## Europe\n\n### How postponed US aid weakens Ukraine's eastern front line\n\n### How postponed US aid weakens Ukraine's eastern front line\n\nPolitics5 hours ago5 hours ago03:10 min\n\nMore from Europe\n\n## Middle East\n\n### Little escape for Rafah residents amid plans for offensive\n\n### Little escape for Rafah residents amid plans for offensive\n\nConflicts43 minutes ago43 minutes ago\n\nMore from Middle East\n\n## North America\n\n### Millions in US, Canada and Mexico witness total solar eclipse\n\n### Millions in US, Canada and Mexico witness total solar eclipse\n\nNature and Environment15 hours ago15 hours ago5 images\n\nMore from North America\n\n## Latin America\n\n### 'Panama Papers' trial starts after years of delay\n\n### 'Panama Papers' trial starts after years of delay\n\nBusiness5 hours ago5 hours ago01:46 min\n\nMore from Latin America\n\nGo to homepage\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## About DW\n\n  * Who we are\n  * Press\n  * DW Global Media Forum\n\n## DW offers\n\n  * Learn German\n  * DW Akademie\n\n## Service\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Reception\n  * FAQ\n  * Contact\n  * Topics from A to Z\n  * Headlines\n\n## B2B\n\n  * Sales & Distribution\n  * Travel\n  * Advertising\n  * German News Service\n\n## Follow us on\n\n\u00a9 2024 Deutsche WellePrivacy PolicyLegal noticeDigital accessibilityData\nprivacy settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
