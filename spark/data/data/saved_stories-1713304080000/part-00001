BYD's manager in the region, Zhou Zou, spoke\nto Nikkei about the plans, with the plant pegged as a potential export hub to\nthe US.\n\nThe location of the new BYD plant has not been revealed at this point, but the\ncompany has reportedly started a feasibility study for the manufacturing hub.\nNegotiations with local and national officials are also reportedly underway.\n\nThe Warren Buffett-backed company paused its initial plan to sell cars in\nAmerica last year due to the Inflation Reduction Act (among other reasons),\nwhich puts a significant roadblock on vehicles imported from the People's\nRepublic, but now it seems that BYD is trying to adapt to those rules.\n\nThe race to become the world's biggest EV maker was intense in 2023, with\nTesla coming out on top with 1.81 million vehicles delivered. BYD came in\nsecond (discounting its PHEVs), with the bulk of its EVs produced and sold in\nChina.\n\nIf BYD's Mexican plant pushes through, the company will benefit from lower\ntariff costs as part of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. With assembly in North\nAmerica, a break from the Inflation Reduction Act could also be expected if\nevery battery component is sourced from within the US or one of its trade\npartners.\n\nOf course, a new company entering the market will likely offer other financial\nincentives to help get the first few examples out the door, and after that,\nthe products should speak for themselves.\n\nPlenty of candidates from the automaker's lineup could attract new buyers. The\nBYD Dolphin is one of the best-selling EVs in China, while the Seal, a Tesla\nModel S competitor, would be an interesting proposition with its sleek styling\nand impressive performance. The Dolphin and Seal are both 2024 World Car of\nthe Year finalists.\n\nThe company's luxury EV division, Yangwang, also offers exciting vehicles,\nincluding some that have features we've never seen elsewhere, like the U8\nsupercar and its novel suspension that can hop and self-level the car.\nElsewhere, the U7 launched last month has the Porsche Taycan in its sights.\n\nShare Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nShare Share Share Share\n\nCopy\n\nEmail\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * News\n  * Electric Vehicles\n  * industry news\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJacob Oliva (580 Articles Published)\n\nJacob Oliva is an automotive journalist with nearly a decade of experience\ncovering stories about anything with wheels.
