2024\n\nESP32-H4 caters to increasing demands for low-power wireless devices, boasting\nsignificant upgrades in power consumption, connectivity features, and memory\nexpansion capabilities. It represents a significant advancement for\nEspressif's Bluetooth LE chips, transitioning from Bluetooth 5.0 to Bluetooth\n5.4.\n\nEspressif Systems (SSE: 688018.SH) introduces the ESP32-H4, expanding its\n802.15.4 and Bluetooth LE portfolio. This next-generation SoC caters to\nincreasing demands for low-power wireless devices, boasting significant\nupgrades in power consumption, connectivity features, and memory expansion\ncapabilities. The ESP32-H4 represents a significant advancement for\nEspressif's Bluetooth LE chips, transitioning from Bluetooth 5.0 to Bluetooth\n5.4.\n\nThe ESP32-H4 integrates essential connectivity technologies, including IEEE\n802.15.4 and Bluetooth 5.4 (LE), crucial for low-power mesh architectures,\nsupporting Thread 1.3, Zigbee 3.0, and Bluetooth Mesh 1.1 protocols.\n\nThe ESP32-H4 is a key chip designed for the Bluetooth Low Energy market. It\nintroduces advanced features such as LE Audio, LE Isochronous Channels (BIS\nand CIS), Connection Subrating, Periodic Advertising with Responses (PAwR), as\nwell as Direction Finding using Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure\n(AoD), expanding its potential applications. LE Audio is the next generation\nof Bluetooth Audio, making audio streaming over Bluetooth Low Energy possible.\nBluetooth Direction Finding significantly enhances location accuracy compared\nto Bluetooth RSSI positioning. PAwR makes the advertising can be bidirectional\nbetween a control device (e.g. gateway) and thousands of ultra-low-power\nnodes, which is targeted for retail applications such as electronic shelf\nlabels, as well as for warehouse applications and sensor connectivity.\n\nESP32-H4 boasts a dual-core, 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller clocked up to 96\nMHz, equipped with 320KB of on-chip SRAM, 128KB of ROM, and supports external\nflash memory. Noteworthy is its support for up to 4MB of PSRAM, providing\nenhanced memory management flexibility. ESP32-H4 places a strong emphasis on\naffordable security, integrating features like secure boot, flash encryption,\nand cryptographic accelerators, ensuring the protection of private keys. The\nESP32-H4 enables the creation of low-power battery-operated devices through\nits integrated DC-DC supply, significantly optimizing power consumption of the\nSoC through efficient voltage regulation and lower supply voltage, combined\nwith selective activation of peripherals in low-power modes, enabling extended\nbattery life.\n\nThe significant enhancements in microcontroller and wireless capabilities\nposition it as an optimal solution for sophisticated wearables, healthcare\ndevices, LE Audio devices, low-power sensors and other complex IoT\napplications. The integration of IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth LE connectivity\nalong with low power consumptions facilitates the creation of devices for\nextended battery life. It is an ideal solution for battery powered Matter over\nThread devices.\n\nIt integrates up to 35 GPIOs, encompassing standard microcontroller\nperipherals like I2C, I2S, SPI, UART, LED-PWM, ADC, Timers, DMA, TWAI, USB-\nOTG, and MCPWM. Specialized peripherals include the Event Task Matrix for\nautomation-triggered tasks. The inclusion of 14 touch sensing GPIOs makes the\nESP32-H4 suitable for applications with Human Machine Interaction\nrequirements.\n\nThe ESP32-H4 will be backed by Espressif\u2019s robust IoT Development Framework\n(ESP-IDF), enabling customers to leverage their existing knowledge of the\nplatform. Furthermore, the ESP-Matter-SDK will incorporate ESP32-H4 support,\nfacilitating the creation of battery-operated Matter-enabled products.
