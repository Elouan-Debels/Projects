This is because, while words on the grid can share letters, one word\ncannot be fully contained within another.\n\nThis often means that if you find a word that's not registering, it may either\nbe contained within another word or have a word contained within it. For\nexample, if 'SOAK' isn't working, try 'OAK' (or vice-versa).\n\nWhen circled, a word\u2019s letter tiles will change color to show how close your\nguess was to the KEYWORD.\n\nBased on TRYING we know:\n\n  * The KEYWORD doesn't contain a T, I, N, or G.\n  * R is in the KEYWORD but not in the 2nd letter position.\n  * Y is in the KEYWORD and in the 3rd letter position.\n\nTip! You can change the size of the grid, enable dark mode, and more in the\ngame's settings.\n\nFeedback or questions?
