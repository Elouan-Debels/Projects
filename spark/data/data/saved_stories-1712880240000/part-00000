It is\nconsidered the first cyberpunk-genre MMORPG,^[4] and is designed to integrate\nelements of first-person shooter games.^[2] It has been called a MMO first-\nperson shooter (MMOFPS),^[5] but most consider it a hybrid of MMORPG and\nfirst-person shooter,.^[2]^[6] Although Neocron is often said to be the first\nMMOFPS, WWII Online, released in 2001, holds the Guinness World Record as the\nfirst MMOFPS.^[7]\n\nIts 2004 sequel, Neocron 2: Beyond Dome of York, was originally slated to be\nan expansion pack^[8] and released separately under a new publisher, 10tacle\nStudios AG.^[9] Following a brief transitional period where Neocron players\nwere encouraged to transfer their characters to Neocron 2, the Neocron servers\nwere closed while the Neocron 2 servers continue to run to this day.^[10]\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\nThe player character may be chosen from four distinct classes. Available are\ngenetically engineered super soldiers, (\"GenTank\"), the slight, yet dexterous\nand intelligent \"Spy\", the psionically focused and physically underpowered\n\"Psi Monk\" as well as the \"Private Eye\" (PE), commonly referred to as a Jack\nof All Trades for its ability to use aspects of all the other classes.\n\nLater the player may assign \"skill points\" (gained from experience) into\nspecific abilities, e.g. Construction, Research, Droning and Rifles. Any\ncharacter or class can use the most basic forms of these, but to master any\none of them requires a large commitment in skill points. Jobs range from the\nnotorious hacker, who dives into the alternate reality of Hacknet, technicians\nwho research or construct items and (especially) weapons, to the common grunt,\nwho fights alongside his clan for the outposts, spread around the wastelands\n(Jobs are not physically imposed: they are a generalization taken from how\nskill points are distributed to attributes.)\n\n## Storyline[edit]\n\nA \"Subway\" station in Neocron city\n\nThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic 28th century. In the mid-22nd\ncentury, tensions rose between an expanded Chinese Empire and a joint\nEuropean/North American Federation of the Free World. The unexplained apparent\ndestruction of the first Chinese interstellar colony ship resulted in China\nlaunching devastating nuclear strikes with stealth missiles. In retaliation,\nthe American president gave the command to counter strike with cold fusion\nlong-range missiles. World War III started on February 17, 2143; it lasted\nless than 6 hours.\n\nIt took over three centuries for even the most rudimentary civilization to\nreturn. By the mid-26th century two great cities had risen from the ashes,\nthanks in large part to the \"Ceres Project\u201d. Originally an MIT project in the\nearly 21st century aimed at storing every aspect of human knowledge on\nholodisk, it had been taken over by the American military in response to the\nmurder of the project leader.\n\n500 years later, both cities are now but shadows of their former selves:\nNeocron is diminished thanks to a succession of coups d'\u00e9tat as well as a mass\nexodus to Irata III, a colony 80 light years away formed by the missing\nChinese colony ship, and Dome of York suffers from losing a devastating war\nwith Neocron.\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nReception\n\nAggregate scoresAggregator| Score  \n---|---  \nGameRankings| 69%^[11]  \nMetacritic| 66/100^[12]  \nReview scoresPublication| Score  \n---|---  \nGameSpot| 6.6/10^[13]  \nGameSpy| ^[14]  \nGameTrailers| 7.4/10 (Neocron)^[15] 6.7/10 (Neocron 2)^[16]  \nIGN| 6.5/10^[17]  \nPC Zone| 8.5/10 (Neocron)^[18] 2.4/10 (Neocron 2)^[19]  \nX-Play| ^[20]  \nAdrenaline Vault| ^[21]  \nVideoGamesLife| 83/100^[22]  \nGamers Europe| 8/10^[23]  \nGameStar| 73/100 (Neocron)^[24] 67/100 (Neocron 2)^[25]  \n  \nNeocron received generally mixed reviews. While some reviewers praised the\nfirst-person shooter style interface as \"intuitive\"^[21] or \"innovative\",^[23]\nothers describe combat in Neocron as being \"dull\"^[26] or not at all\nrevolutionary.^[27]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Keeler, John (2002-09-26). \"Neocron Beta Impressions\".
