If nobody listens to you, and the disaster happens, you\u2019re a\nuseless Cassandra. If nobody listens to you and the disaster luckily doesn\u2019t\nhappen, you\u2019re viewed as a fool. If people do listen to you and they take\naction to successfully avert the disaster, a lot of people will still say that\nyour warning was wrong and the precautions were unnecessary. The only way\nyou\u2019ll ever come out looking smart is if the disaster does happen, and people\nheed your warning in time to mitigate its impact. At that point, you\u2019re\nGandalf. But the problem with being Gandalf is that it involves a disaster\nactually happening, so it\u2019s not exactly something you should hope for.\n\nDespite this, I think it\u2019s our duty to warn the world of impending disaster if\nwe think we see one coming.\n\nI\u2019ve been worried about a major war between the U.S. and China since the late\n2010s, when tensions started ratcheting up in the South China Sea. I wrote a\npost for Bloomberg in 2018 saying that the risk of war was being ignored. I\nfelt like I was shouting into the void.\n\nSince the pandemic, and especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza erupted,\nthose worries have gone mainstream. To give just one example, JP Morgan Chase\nCEO Jamie Dimon, probably the country\u2019s most important banker, believes that\nthe world is entering a period of geopolitical danger unrivaled since World\nWar 2:\n\n> The nation's most influential banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, told\n> investors Monday that he continues to expect the U.S. economy to be\n> resilient and grow this year. But he worries geopolitical events including\n> the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, as well as U.S. political\n> polarization, might be creating an environment that \"may very well be\n> creating risks that could eclipse anything since World War II.\"\n>\n> The comments came in an annual shareholder letter from Dimon...\n>\n> \"America's global leadership role is being challenged outside by other\n> nations and inside by our polarized electorate,\" Dimon said. \"We need to\n> find ways to put aside our differences and work in partnership with other\n> Western nations in the name of democracy. During this time of great crises,\n> uniting to protect our essential freedoms, including free enterprise, is\n> paramount.\"\n\nHe is, of course, completely right.\n\nBut while Dimon\u2019s letter talks about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, it leaves\nthe big one unspoken: World War 3. If China and the U.S. go to war, it\u2019ll make\nwhat\u2019s happening now in East Europe and the Middle East look like child\u2019s play\n\u2014 not just because the forces involved would be larger, but because the\nexisting wars in East Europe and the Middle East would likely expand into\nregional wars as well.\n\nYou can bet that although he doesn\u2019t talk about it, Dimon is thinking about\nWW3, as are many others. As I see it, the mere fact that not many people are\ntalking about the danger represents evidence that we\u2019re still not taking it\nseriously. And because Americans aren\u2019t talking about it, our country doesn\u2019t\nhave the urgency required to do something about it. One of our great strengths\nas a nation has always been that we start shouting about problems before they\nbecome severe, giving us time to prepare. Right now we\u2019re not shouting, so\nwe\u2019re not preparing.\n\nSo although I\u2019m just an unimportant little economics blogger, I will do my\nbest to shout about the likelihood of an onrushing catastrophe.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a scary historical parallel.\n\n####\n\nWhen did World War 2 begin?\n\nWhen Americans think of World War 2, we usually think of the roughly four\nyears of the war that we participated in, from late 1941 through 1945. Those\nyears were indeed the most climactic and destructive of the war, by far, but\nthe war actually began earlier. In fact, although the official start date is\nSeptember 1, 1939, it\u2019s easy to make an argument that the war began long\nbefore that.\n\nSome historians view WW1 and WW2 as one continuous war, but I don\u2019t think that\nreally makes sense \u2014 there was definitely a lull in global war deaths in the\n1920s. On top of that, WW1 didn\u2019t really have an East Asian theater. So let\u2019s\nset that view aside.\n\nBut throughout the 1930s, there were a number of conflicts that led into World\nWar 2, and eventually merged with that overall conflict, like tributaries\nemptying into a great river. Let\u2019s do a quick timeline of these.\n\nIn 1931-32, Japan seized Manchuria from China, an act that led inexorably to a\nwider war between the two powers. The Manchurian war and occupation also set\nJapan on a path toward militarism, bringing to power the regime that would\nultimately prosecute WW2 itself.\n\nIn 1935-36, fascist Italy invaded and conquered Ethiopia. The League of\nNations halfheartedly tried to stop the war and failed, leading to the League\nbeing discredited and the post-WW1 order being greatly weakened. That\nemboldened the fascist powers. Ethiopian resistance to Italian rule would\neventually become a minor theater of WW2.\n\nFrom 1935 through 1939, Japan and the Soviet Union fought an undeclared border\nwar, ultimately culminating in major battles in 1939, which the USSR won. That\nled to Japan seeking an alliance with Nazi Germany, and eventually led to the\nSoviets\u2019 entry into the war against Japan at the very end of WW2. (The\nrealization that Japan couldn\u2019t defeat the Soviets and conquer Siberian oil\nfields also prompted Japan to try to take Southeast Asian oil instead, when it\nneeded oil to prosecute its war against China; this led to Pearl Harbor and\nthe Pacific War.)\n\nFrom 1936 through 1939, Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, and the Soviet Union\nfought each other in a proxy war: the Spanish Civil War. Units from all three\npowers officially or unofficially engaged in the fighting. When the\nNationalists won, it emboldened the fascist powers even further.\n\nIn 1937, Japan invaded the remainder of China, in what\u2019s called the Second\nSino-Japanese War. This became a major theater of World War 2, accounting for\nalmost as many deaths as the Nazi invasion of the USSR. It also prompted Japan\nto go to war with Britain and the U.S., in order to seize the oil fields of\nIndonesia to support the invasion of China. (The fact that we don\u2019t count this\nas the start of WW2 seems like pure eurocentrism to me.)\n\nIn 1939, before the Soviet Union joined World War 2, it invaded Finland in\nwhat\u2019s known as the Winter War, seizing some territory at great cost. This war\nwould continue all the way through WW2 itself.\n\nSo there were no fewer than six wars in the 1930s that ended up feeding into\nWorld War 2 itself! But even after the war officially began with Hitler\u2019s\ninvasion of Poland in September 1939, it was several years before the\nalliances settled into their final configuration and the fighting reached its\npeak.\n\nHitler\u2019s invasion of Poland was actually a joint invasion with the Soviet\nUnion! Even as the Nazis attacked from the west, the Soviets attacked from the\neast and seized part of Poland, having agreed with the Nazis beforehand to\ndivide the country up. So at that point, until Hitler betrayed Stalin and\nattacked in 1941, the Nazis and the Soviets looked more like partners than\nenemies, despite just having fought a proxy war against each other in Spain.\n\nBritain and France declared war on Germany after it invaded Poland, but for\neight months, nothing really happened; this was called the Phoney War. That\npause ended when Hitler invaded and conquered France and started bombing\nBritain in 1940. At that point WW2 was in full swing, but the violence was\nstill fairly localized and fairly limited \u2014 only about two hundred thousand\npeople died in those campaigns, which sounds like a lot but was only about\n0.3% of the war\u2019s total death toll.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1941 that World War 2 became what we Americans remember it as.\nIt was then that the Nazis attacked the Soviets and Japan attacked the U.S.,\nbringing the world\u2019s two most powerful countries into the fray, raising\ncasualties enormously, sealing the fate of the Axis, and creating the grand\nalliance that would form the basis of the postwar world order.\n\nSo if you were living at any point in 1931 through 1940, you would already be\nwitnessing conflicts that would eventually turn into the bloodiest, most\ncataclysmic war that humanity has yet known \u2014 but you might not realize it.\nYou would be standing in the foothills of the Second World War, but unless you\nwere able to make far-sighted predictions, you wouldn\u2019t know what horrors\nlurked in the near future.\n\nIn case the parallel isn\u2019t blindingly obvious, we might be standing in the\nfoothills of World War 3 right now. If WW3 happens, future bloggers might list\nthe wars in Ukraine and Gaza in a timeline like the one I just gave.\n\nOr we might not be in the foothills of WW3. I think there\u2019s still a good\nchance that we can avert a wider, more cataclysmic war, and instead have a\nprotracted standoff \u2014 Cold War 2 \u2014 instead. But I\u2019m not going to lie \u2014 the\noutlook seems to be deteriorating. One big reason is that China appears to be\nramping up its support for Russia.\n\n####\n\nChina is now engaged in a proxy war against Europe\n\nThe Ukraine War is a proxy war. This is not because Ukraine is a U.S. or\nEuropean \u201cproxy\u201d, in the sense that we tell the Ukrainians what to do. We do\nnot. But the U.S. and Europe are contributing to Ukraine\u2019s defense in order to\nkeep Russia bogged down, because we all know that if Ukraine falls, the\nBaltics, Moldova, and eventually Poland are likely to be next on Putin\u2019s menu.\n\nIn fact, although the U.S. has done a lot to help Ukraine, Europe as a whole\nhas done even more:\n\nSource: Ukraine Support Tracker\n\nExpressed as a share of GDP, Europe has done even more, since Europe\u2019s GDP is\nsmaller than that of the U.S. And since the U.S.\u2019 aid has been mostly military\n\u2014 which is basically the U.S. paying its own defense contractors \u2014 Europe\u2019s\naid has been more of an economic sacrifice.\n\nOn top of that, Europe, not the U.S., is bearing the brunt of the Russian gas\ncutoff. Ukraine\u2019s fate is also much more important to Europe than to the U.S.\nNot only does Ukraine stand to join the EU if it survives, but if Ukraine\nfalls, Putin will probably begin dismantling Europe. The U.S.\u2019 lesser degree\nof direct interest in the outcome of the conflict is probably one reason why\nUkraine aid is now bogged down in America even as Europe\u2019s assistance ramps\nup.\n\nSo it makes sense to view the Ukraine War as a European proxy conflict against\nRussia. But what\u2019s more ominous is that it also makes an increasing amount of\nsense to view it as a Chinese proxy conflict against Europe.\n\nA little over a year ago, there were reports that China was sending lethal aid\nto Russia. Believing these reports, I concluded \u2014 perhaps prematurely \u2014 that\nChina had gone \u201call in\u201d on Russia\u2019s military effort. Some of the reports were\nlater walked back, but the fact is, it\u2019s very hard to know how much China is\ndoing to provide Russia with drones and such under the table. But now, a year\nlater, there are multiple credible reports that China is ramping up aid in\nvarious forms.\n\nFor example, the U.S. is now claiming that China is providing Russia with both\nmaterial aid and geospatial intelligence (i.e. telling Russia where Ukrainian\nunits are so Russia can hit them):\n\n> The US is warning allies that China has stepped up its support for Russia,\n> including by providing geospatial intelligence, to help Moscow in its war\n> against Ukraine.\n>\n> Amid signs of continued military integration between the two nations, China\n> has provided Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, as well as\n> microelectronics and machine tools for tanks, according to people familiar\n> with the matter.\n>\n> China\u2019s support also includes optics, propellants to be used in missiles and\n> increased space cooperation, one of the people said.\n>\n> President Joe Biden raised concerns with Xi Jinping during their call this\n> week about China\u2019s support for the Russian defense industrial base,\n> including machine tools, optics, nitrocellulose, microelectronics, and\n> turbojet engines, White House National Security Council spokesperson\n> Adrienne Watson said.\n\nThis is very similar to the aid that Europe and the U.S. are providing\nUkraine. We also provide geospatial intelligence, as well as materiel and\nproduction assistance. If reports are correct \u2014 and this time, they come from\nthe U.S. government as well as from major news organizations \u2014 then China is\nnow playing the same role for Russia that Europe and the U.S. have been\nplaying for Ukraine.\n\nIn other words, the Ukraine War now looks like a proxy war between China and\nEurope. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, definitely thinks\nthis is the case:\n\n> An \u201calliance of authoritarian powers\u201d is working more closely together\n> against Western democracies, the head of Nato has warned...Jens Stoltenberg\n> told the BBC that Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly\n> aligned...[Stoltenberg said that] the world was now \u201cmuch more dangerous,\n> much more unpredictable\u201d and \u201cmuch more violent\u201d...He said there is an\n> \u201cauthoritarian\u201d alliance giving each other practical support that is \u201cmore\n> and more aligned\u201d...The Nato chief explained: \u201cChina is propping up the\n> Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in\n> return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean that China is now engaged in a proxy war against Europe?\nSeveral things.\n\nFirst, it means U.S. influence over the conflict is a lot more limited than we\nlike to think. Americans like to believe that we\u2019re still the hegemon we were\nin 1999 \u2014 that we can just stretch out our mighty hand to stop any war, and\nthat wars therefore continue only when we want them to. This is complete\nfantasy. Even if America never sends another penny, Europe will continue to\nsupport Ukraine, because for them the conflict is existential (even if the\nGermans don\u2019t quite realize it yet). In fact, Europe may eventually fight\nRussia directly \u2014 Emmanuel Macron is already talking about this openly.\n\nAnd Vladimir Putin, emboldened by Chinese production and intelligence support,\nand having staked not only his legacy but his regime\u2019s entire reason for\nexistence on the conquest of territory in East Europe, will have little reason\nto stop fighting no matter what the U.S. says. The U.S. could push Ukraine to\ncede land for peace, and it probably wouldn\u2019t matter, because Putin wants all\nof Ukraine, and then he wants other European countries too.\n\nChina, for its part, has mostly lobbed threats and bellicose rhetoric to\nEurope through its various propaganda proxies:\n\nIn other words, the Ukraine War is now a proxy war between major powers that\nis almost totally out of America\u2019s control. That is a bad sign for global\nstability.\n\nIn fact, U.S. actions to try to deter China from backing Russia might just end\nup widening the conflict. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is threatening to\nput sanctions on Chinese banks:\n\n> The United States is prepared to sanction Chinese banks and companies, as\n> well as Beijing\u2019s leadership, if they assist Russia\u2019s armed forces with the\n> invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday...\n>\n> China is \u201centitled\u201d to have a relationship with Russia, she said, noting\n> that much of the trade between the two countries is seen by the U.S. as\n> nonproblematic. But the provision of military aid from Beijing to Moscow\n> could trigger sanctions.\n\nOf course, the election of Trump later this year could forestall that, since\nTrump has expressed conciliatory sentiments toward Russia and has made some\nrecent signs of wanting to accommodate China as well. But if Trump\u2019s America\nwithdraws into isolationism \u2014 or worse, collapses into civil conflict \u2014 it\nwill simply give a green light to the authoritarian powers to carry out more\nconquests, as the Axis was emboldened in the 1930s. The U.S. would eventually\nend up having to rush back in after the fact, like in WW2, or see itself\nrelegated to the status of a fallen, friendless middle power.\n\n####\n\nAsia is a tinderbox\n\nOf course, World War 3 will actually begin if and when the U.S. and China go\nto war. Almost everyone thinks this would happen if and when China attacks\nTaiwan, but in fact there are several other flashpoints that are just as scary\nand which many people seem to be overlooking.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the South China Sea, where China has been pressing the\nPhilippines to surrender its maritime territory with various \u201cgray zone\u201d\nbullying tactics. Ian Ellis has a good rundown of these:\n\nSource: Ian Ellis\n\nThe U.S. is a formal treaty ally of the Philippines, and has vowed to honor\nits commitments and defend its ally against potential threats.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the ever-present background threat of North Korea, which some\nexperts believe is seriously considering re-starting the Korean War. That\nwould trigger a U.S. defense of South Korea, which in turn might bring in\nChina, as it did in the 1950s.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning the China-India border. China has recently\nreiterated its claim to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, calling it\n\u201cSouth Tibet\u201d and declaring that the area was part of China since ancient\ntimes. India has vigorously rejected this notion, of course. An India-China\nborder war might not start World War 3, but the U.S. would definitely try to\nhelp India out against China, as we did in 2022.\n\nSo even as Europe and China become more deeply enmeshed in a proxy war, there\nare multiple flashpoints in Asia that could blossom into World War 3 any day\nnow. Asia is an absolute tinderbox right now.\n\n####\n\nChina is becoming better prepared for war. The U.S. is not.\n\nA few Americans like Jamie Dimon are starting to wake up to all of this, but\nmost Americans are not \u2014 they\u2019re still focused on domestic conflict. As a\nresult, America hasn\u2019t mustered the urgency necessary to resuscitate its\ndesiccated defense-industrial base. China is engaging in a massive military\nbuildup while the U.S. is lagging behind. This is from a report from the\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies:\n\n> The U.S. defense industrial base...lacks the capacity, responsiveness,\n> flexibility, and surge capability to meet the U.S. military\u2019s production\n> needs as China ramps up defense industrial production. Unless there are\n> urgent changes, the United States risks weakening deterrence and undermining\n> its warfighting capabilities against China and other competitors. A\n> significant part of the problem is that the U.S. defense ecosystem remains\n> on a peacetime footing, despite a protracted war in Ukraine, an active war\n> in the Middle East, and growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific in such areas\n> as the Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula.\n>\n> The United States faces several acute challenges.\n>\n> First, the Chinese defense industrial base is increasingly on a wartime\n> footing and, in some areas, outpacing the U.S. defense industrial\n> base...Chinese defense companies...are producing a growing quantity and\n> quality of land, maritime, air, space, and other capabilities. China...is\n> heavily investing in munitions and acquiring high-end weapons systems and\n> equipment five to six times faster than the United States...China is now the\n> world\u2019s largest shipbuilder and has a shipbuilding capacity that is roughly\n> 230 times larger than the United States. One of China\u2019s large shipyards,\n> such as Jiangnan Shipyard, has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards\n> combined, according to U.S. Navy estimates.\n>\n> Second, the U.S. defense industrial base continues to face a range of\n> production challenges, including a lack of urgency in revitalizing the\n> defense industrial ecosystem...[T]here is still a shortfall of munitions and\n> other weapons systems for a protracted war in such areas as the Indo-\n> Pacific. Supply chain challenges also remain serious, and today\u2019s workforce\n> is inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese defense industrial base is increasingly on a wartime footing.\u201d If\nthat isn\u2019t a clear enough warning, I don\u2019t know what would be. You have now\nbeen warned!\n\nA whole lot of Americans need to be shouting these warnings to anyone who will\nlisten. Instead, many Americans seem intent on covering up the problems out of\nembarrassment:\n\n> As the Navy\u2019s largest U.S. trade show gets underway on Monday, officers in\n> charge of the service\u2019s marquee shipbuilding programs won\u2019t offer the usual\n> briefings with reporters and analysts about them...That break from the\n> tradition...comes just days after the Navy announced that four of its most\n> critical shipbuilding programs are years behind schedule...\n>\n> The Navy\u2019s top admiral and civilian secretary have still not responded to\n> questions about a damning Navy report released Tuesday outlining the\n> sweeping failure of the Navy and its industrial partners to make expected\n> progress on two submarine programs, an aircraft carrier and a new class of\n> frigates...\n>\n> The delays, from one to three years each depending on the program, come as\n> the Navy and Pentagon pour billions into modernizing and upgrading shipyards\n> in an attempt to build and repair ships more quickly and keep pace with\n> China. Beijing\u2019s navy has already surpassed the U.S. in size.\n>\n> But supply chain issues caused by Covid and the Navy\u2019s insistence on\n> changing the design of its ships even as workers build them have thrown the\n> service\u2019s plans into uncertainty.\n>\n> Aware of the issues for years, the Navy is still unsure how to fix them...\n>\n> Two people familiar with the issue say Navy leaders instructed the program\n> managers not to hold their public briefings because the conference came too\n> close to the release of the shipbuilding study[.]\n\nI\u2019m sure that to someone in the Navy\u2019s public relations department thinks that\nsimply refusing to talk to reporters about these problems means that the\nproblems have been solved. This is typical of the ostrich-like mentality that\nI see among a very wide variety of Americans, from Congressional staffers to\ntech moguls to news reporters and pundits, regarding the imminent threat of\nwar with China. But refusing to talk about problems doesn\u2019t make them go away;\nit simply makes us less prepared to deal with them.\n\nChina\u2019s leaders, meanwhile, labor under no such comforting illusions. In\naddition to their massive military buildup, they are taking various other\nactions that might or might not entail purposeful preparation for war, but\ndefinitely have the effect of making China better-prepared should a war break\nout.\n\nFor example, China\u2019s dominance of the battery and electric vehicle industries\nhelps insulates them against a potential blockade of their oil supplies\nthrough the Straits of Malacca.\n\nXi has also commanded the country to improve its food self-sufficiency; since\nthe country was 94% self-sufficient in food back in 2000, this is probably not\nan impossible task. That will insulate China against any possible blockade of\nfood imports in the event of a war.\n\nAs for finance, China has been stockpiling gold and urging trading partners to\ndo more business in yuan. That should help neuter threats of financial\nsanctions, like the one Janet Yellen just issued.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t know which of these measures represent purposeful preparation\nbefore the launching of a great-power war. But they all definitely make China\nbetter-prepared. Even as the U.S. tries its best to ignore its glaring\ninability to build ships and missiles and ammunition, China is shoring up its\nkey weaknesses in fuel, food, and finance.\n\nAll of this should scare you a bit. It certainly scares me a lot. The\npossibility that revisionist great powers will launch a world war in order to\noverturn the global order is now a lot higher than it was a few years ago, and\narguably even higher than one year ago. Americans need to be screaming our\nheads off about this, so that we can start planning for this disaster today,\ninstead of allowing ourselves to wait and be blindsided by it. We need to be\nwarning our friends, and telling them to warn their friends. We need to be\ntalking about this on national TV, in the New York Times, on podcasts, and on\nwhatever social media the CCP still doesn\u2019t control.\n\nRight now, what I mostly hear is a deafening, horrible silence.\n\nShare\n\n330 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n41 Restacks\n\n330\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Americans are still not worried enough about the risk of world war\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n181\n\nShare\n\n181 Comments\n\nMikey S17 hrs agoLiked by Noah SmithI would like to see you lay out a proposal\nfor how the US should be preparing.
