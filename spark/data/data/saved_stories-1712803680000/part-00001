Like dense models, training MoEs requires answering the\n> same question: given a training budget, what is the optimal allocation on\n> the model size and number of tokens? We study the scaling law of MoE-based\n> LLMs regarding the relations between the model performance, model size,\n> dataset size, and the expert degree. Echoing previous research studying MoE\n> in different contexts, we observe the diminishing return of increasing the\n> number of experts, but this seems to suggest we should scale the number of\n> experts until saturation, as the training cost would remain constant, which\n> is problematic during inference time. We propose to amend the scaling law of\n> MoE by introducing inference efficiency as another metric besides the\n> validation loss. We find that MoEs with a few (4/8) experts are the most\n> serving efficient solution under the same performance, but costs 2.5-3.5x\n> more in training. On the other hand, training a (16/32) expert MoE much\n> smaller (70-85%) than the loss-optimal solution, but with a larger training\n> dataset is a promising setup under a training budget.\n\nComments:| 15 pages, 8 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.02852 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.02852v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.02852arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Longfei Yun [view email] [v1] Wed, 3 Apr 2024 16:33:42 UTC (1,107 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Toward Inference-optimal Mixture-of-Expert\nLarge Language Models, by Longfei Yun and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
