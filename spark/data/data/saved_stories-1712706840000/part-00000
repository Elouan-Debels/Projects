COVID-19 Virus Can Persist in the Body More Than a Year after Infection\n\n#### 08 AprCOVID-19 Virus Can Persist in the Body More Than a Year after\nInfection\n\n  * Written by Amy Proal\n  * Categorised Uncategorized\n\nLancet study solidifies evidence of long-term viral persistence after COVID;\ndemonstrates urgency of sustained research into the chronic health\nconsequences of the virus\n\nUCSF LIINC research coordinator Marin Ewing collects blood from a study\nparticipant.\n\nMedford MA, April 8, 2024 \u2013 Research published today in Lancet Infectious\nDisease and supported by PolyBio Research Foundation provides the strongest\nevidence yet that the COVID virus can persist for months or years after\ninfection. The findings, published by a UC San Francisco/Harvard Medical\nSchool team, found that proteins created by the virus were still present for\nup to 14 months in a quarter of people tested. This demonstrates SARS-CoV-2\nviral persistence as an urgent area of research underlying a breadth of\nchronic disease after COVID.\n\n\u201cThe fact that every new SARS-CoV-2 infection has the potential to become\nchronic is perhaps the single most concerning aspect of this virus\u201d says Dr.\nAmy Proal, President of PolyBio. \u201cWe have compelling data that viral\npersistence is much more common than recognized which could have major health\nimplications.\u201d\n\nSolid Evidence of Persistent Infection\n\nThe researchers analyzed blood samples from 171 people who had been infected\nwith the virus. Using a novel ultra-sensitive blood test, they found that\nproteins from the virus were still present up to one year after infection in\nup to 25% of people. These findings greatly bolster evidence that the\ncoronavirus can linger in tissue and organs, even after recovery from acute\ninfection.\n\nThe likelihood of detecting the COVID proteins indicative of persistent virus\nwas about twice as high among those who were hospitalized for COVID as it was\nfor those who were not. It was also higher for those who were not hospitalized\nbut reported being sicker.\n\nThe researchers note that viral proteins identified in the study could not\nhave been a result the COVID vaccine, since nearly all study participants had\nnot received the shots prior to the blood collection. In addition, proteins\nwere only rarely found in banked blood obtained from over 200 people before\nthe pandemic, confirming the accuracy of the blood test used in the research.\n\n\u201cFinding COVID-19 proteins floating in the bloodstream for more than a year\nfollowing initial infection was a surprise to most of us and is the product of\nnew molecular tools. This finding now firmly informs the next step in our\nresearch agenda \u2014 is persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for\ncausing people\u2019s current symptoms in Long COVID or medical events they may\nhave in the future?\u201d says Jeffrey N. Martin, Head of the Division of Clinical\nEpidemiology at University of California, San Francisco who co-led the study.\n\nMartin is part of a multi-disciplinary collaboration behind the findings. The\nblood test used to find viral proteins was created by Harvard Medical School\u2019s\nDavid Walt \u2013 founder of biotech companies that have transformed technologies\nacross biomedical research. The blood samples were provided by volunteers in\nthe UCSF Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) study.\nThe UCSF team contains experts who helped make HIV/AIDS a treatable disease\nand pivoted their infrastructure into Long COVID via LIINC in April of 2020.\n\nThe UCSF team is part of PolyBio\u2019s LongCovid Research Consortium \u2013 a privately\nfunded global collaborationof scientists working rapidly to document SARS-\nCoV-2 persistence in Long COVID, with data channeled into clinical trials. In\na seminal Nature paper, the Consortium delineated a roadmap for the study of\nSARS-CoV-2 persistence that is being executed by dozens of international\nteams.\n\nHowever, with an estimated 18 million adults and 5.8 million children\nsuffering from Long COVID, government investment is also needed. SARS-CoV-2\nhas even been found in the lymph nodes of children months after COVID,\nsuggesting persistent infection can begin early in life.\n\n\u201cCOVID persistence could contribute to Long COVID in both adults and children\u201d\nsays Michael Peluso, MD, principal investigator of LIINC and an infectious\ndisease researcher in the UCSF School of Medicine. \u201cWe must rapidly keep\nstudying that possibility.\u201d\n\nAbout PolyBio\n\nPolyBio Research Foundation is a 501(c)3 transforming how complex chronic\nconditions like Long COVID are studied, diagnosed, and treated. PolyBio\nconceptualizes research projects that identify root cause drivers of chronic\nconditions and builds collaborative teams to make the projects a reality.\nPolyBio is supported by numerous donors including Kanro \u2013 a philanthropic fund\nto support open source scientific research established by Vitalik Buterin,\ncreator of Ethereum.\n\n\u00a9 PolyBio Research Foundation.
