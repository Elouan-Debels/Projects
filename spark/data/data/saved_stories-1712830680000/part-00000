Instead, we\u2019re going to look at a bigger picture for\ndesigners.\n\nI\u2019m going to define the \"maker mindset\" as the mindset that says humans\u2019\nfundamental characteristic is that we create. Put simply, the way we identify\nour first human ancestor from our last ape ancestor is that the first human\ncreated something.\n\nFast forward a few hundred thousand years, and nearly everything you see\naround you was created by humans. Every single one of those things was once\njust in someone\u2019s head. Then they went about designing it, working together\nwith other humans, putting capital to work in order to produce it and make it\nreal.\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken about this before, and contrasted this maker mindset with the\ntaker mindset. And you can often see a clear distinction between the two in\nterms of value. For example, a handful of metals and minerals taken from the\nEarth will cost you, say, fifty bucks. But those same metals and minerals,\nconfigured in a particular way, will produce an iPhone that we\u2019ll value at a\nthousand bucks.\n\nSo far, so good. But it\u2019s not always that obvious. And there are plenty of\nsectors where we could still have a 100x impact if we replaced their current\ntaker mindset with a maker mindset.\n\nAgriculture, for example. It\u2019s obviously served humanity very well over the\npast 12,000 years or so. It\u2019s allowed humans to evolve from small, hungry\ntribes to large, abundant cities.\n\nInterestingly, we still have a taker mindset when we look at one of the\ncurrently most efficient ways for humans to consume protein: fish. The fish\nindustry is still predominantly in \"hunter-gatherer mode\", if you think about\nit: we get these really big ships to go to the ocean and hunt for fish. Then\nwe eat those fish.\n\nSo, it seems obvious that, as humanity\u2019s demands for protein increase, we will\nend up farming the oceans the way we\u2019ve been farming land. A kind of second\nagricultural revolution is underway: aquaculture. And, just as agriculture led\nto property titles on land, which eventually led to the creation of states\n(i.e. geography-bound providers and enforcers of laws) it\u2019s possible that\naquaculture would eventually lead to the creation of new, sovereign states on\nthe seas.\n\nBut, if you think about it deeper, there is still something very \"taker\" about\nfarming animals to provide humans with the protein they need. Yes, we may have\nraised and fed all those animals in our farms, but, well, we are still taking\ntheir lives to feed ourselves.\n\nOne way to see how out-of-character this is for a species focused on making\ninstead of taking, is to look at it the way we look at character development\nin a movie. In many mediocre movies, secondary characters serve no other\npurpose than to help our protagonist move forward in the story. For example,\nhow do you write a scene in a movie where a girl has some doubts about whether\nher fianc\u00e9 is the right one? Easy: put her in a bar with her three best\nfriends, who have nothing better to do with their lives than to listen to her\nproblems. They are basically \"extras\" in the girl\u2019s life. They only exist for\nthe purpose they serve in the protagonist\u2019s story.\n\nIn real life, of course, our friends are not just \"extras\" in our lives.\nThat\u2019s why you can tell mediocre movies from really good movies: there\u2019s that\nabsence of believability in the different characters\u2019 arc. They don\u2019t feel\nreal because real people don\u2019t just exist for the purpose they server in our\nstory.\n\nSimilarly, in the story of humanity, other animals we share the planet with\nare not just \"extras\" in our lives. Cows are not extras in a movie about\nhumans, created just to serve our purpose.\n\nI don\u2019t just mean this ethically, but also economically: since cows have\nevolved for purposes other than feeding protein to humans, farming a cow is\nlikely not the most efficient way to turn CO2, water and sunlight into\nprotein.\n\nTherefore, the maker mindset tells us that humans should invent more efficient\nways of producing nutrition, ways that are unlikely to have anything to do\nwith farming animals. Making nutrition, not taking nutrition.\n\nSo, the answer to humans\u2019 growing nutritional needs is to move from\nagriculture to nutriculture: approaching the problem of nutrition with a maker\nmindset, and turning basic elements into nutrition. I bet you we could\nprobably find ways to improve the way we feed humans by at least 100x.\n\n### \u2190 reTURN TO ESSAYS\n\nTop\n\nGall\u00e9 Design | Luxury brand design studio\n\n", "frontpage": false}
