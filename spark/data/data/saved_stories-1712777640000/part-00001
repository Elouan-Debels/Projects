Amazon made\nheadlines this week for rolling back its \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d checkout system,\nwhere customers could simply grab their in-store purchases and leave while a\n\u201cgenerative AI\u201d tallied up their receipt. As reported by The Information,\nhowever, the system wasn\u2019t as automated as it seemed. Amazon merely relied on\nIndian workers reviewing store surveillance camera footage to produce an\nitemized list of purchases. Instead of saving money on cashiers or training\nbetter systems, costs escalated and the promise of a fully technical solution\nwas even further away.\n\nThe promise of AI, for corporations and investors, is that companies can\nincrease profits and productivity by slashing their reliance upon a skilled\nhuman workforce. But as this story and many others show, AI is just today\u2019s\nbuzzword for \u201coutsourcing,\u201d and it comes with the same problems that have\nplagued outsourced companies and workforces for decades.\n\nAmazon\u2019s story is far from unique. Years ago, Microsoft teammates Mary Gray\nand Siddarth Suri called this \u201cghost work,\u201d blaming it on the \u201clast mile\u201d\nproblem of automation: the ever-receding horizon of what a computer is able to\naccomplish instead of a human. Meta\u2019s army of invisible content moderators\nmagically make unpleasant material vanish from your newsfeed at the expense of\ntheir mental health, according to UCLA\u2019s Sarah Roberts. In a brand-new book,\nsociologist Benjamin Shestakofsky relates life at a startup whose US-based\nengineering team was so busy interviewing recruits and scaling up to please\nits investors that it offshored its entire \u201cAI\u201d product to workers in the\nPhilippines who responded to tasks one at a time. Colleagues at Princeton and\nI have described a process we call \u201cpre-automation\u201d where companies employ\nhumans to perform the tasks promised by automated systems, extracting unpaid\nlabor and investment capital on the one hand, while deregulating a sector in\nfavor of a monopoly on the other.\n\n\u201cAI,\u201d in these cases and many others, is a shiny distraction that begs us to\n\u201cpay no attention to the man behind the curtain.\u201d But behind that curtain is\nthe familiar phenomenon of outsourcing: expensive, skilled labor in the US or\nother advanced economies traded for cheap, unskilled labor in developing\neconomies.\n\nIndeed, the job losses associated with \u201cAI\u201d are reminiscent of the losses\nassociated with industrial decline in the late twentieth century. These losses\naccumulated in a geographical location or a market sector as the workforce\nshifted offshore to emerging markets, where many more people are required to\ndo a less skilled version of the job for less pay. As investors looked to skim\never more off the top, the US transformed into a \u201cknowledge economy\u201d dominated\nby a managerial tier but hollowed out of technical expertise.\n\nThe creative accounting techniques that brought us \u201cfast fashion,\u201d off-shore\ncall centers, and even the ill-fated Boeing MAX-C are the very same ones that\ninspired Amazon to install empty checkout stands fueled by Indian workers whom\nthey expected could do the same work for less. But studies show how\noutsourcing adds inter-organizational complexity and communication challenges,\ndriving up inefficiencies and decreasing consumer quality. Meanwhile, studies\nof automation show resulting increases in labor needs and inequalities,\nrequiring both new skilled laborers to supervise the machines and more workers\nto take up lower-skill roles. As anthropologist Lilly Irani observes, labor is\nnot replaced by machines, it\u2019s merely displaced. While stocks surge upon\nrestructuring, few companies achieve this promise of savings and\nprofitability, and \u201cbullshit jobs\u201d soar.\n\nThe story of AI distracts us from these familiar unpleasant scenes. Instead,\nwe envision a glistening \u201cfuture of work\u201d in which we are all miraculously\nmore efficient, our workplaces are populated with relentlessly pleasant\nrobots, and expert automated agents fulfill our every command. Pundits talk\nloftily about the \u201cethics of AI\u201d as if it\u2019s a technical question of ironing\nout its biases or building BB-8 instead of The Terminator.\n\nBut the future of work is not a technology: it\u2019s an arrangement. An\narrangement of people, capital, and workers that moves jobs from where they\nare expensive and highly-paid, to where they can be cheap and menial. \u201cAI\u201d is\na powerful decoy, lest we start thinking about where those jobs have already\ngone \u2013 offshore \u2013 and who moved them there in the first place. Because robots\naren\u2019t \u201ctaking our jobs\u201d \u2013 people are.\n\nWe should be wise to the shiny veneer of new technologies and futuristic\npromises in pitches about \u201cAI.\u201d This is simply old wine in a new bottle. And\nas the Amazon case makes clear, it\u2019s already turned to vinegar. US\npolicymakers and workers alike would do well to heed the lessons of the last\nforty years of outsourcing and its effects upon the labor market, and move\nquickly to legally protect the skilled workforce at home and avoid\nshortchanging partners abroad. Clients of AI-embracing firms should demand\nthey maintain high-level experts on production\u2019s front lines and resist\ndownsizing or reducing complex jobs to menial tasks. And the next time a CEO\nflashes a pitch deck festooned with mentions of AI, investors should follow\nAmazon\u2019s lead and Just Walk Out.\n\n## Authors\n\nJanet Vertesi\n\nJanet Vertesi is associate professor of sociology at Princeton University,\nwhere she is an expert in the study of science, technology, and organizations.\n\n## Topics\n\nArtificial IntelligenceCompetitionTransparency\n\n#### Our content.
