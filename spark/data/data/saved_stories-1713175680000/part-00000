The rise in remote work has caused a\nslow and steady decline in commercial real-estate prices, and, as a result,\nproperty-tax revenue is falling, leaving the city facing a $1 billion tax\ndeficit over the next five years. The same issue, coupled with a persistent\ndecline in tourism, is weighing on San Francisco's finances. Across the\ncountry, from Denver and Seattle to Washington, DC, and New York, cities are\ndeciphering whether to slash their budgets. Even some states, including\nCalifornia, Maryland, and Arizona, are facing financial woes.\n\nEach place is dealing with its own set of circumstances, but at the root of\nall these woes is the struggle to figure out what the new normal is, budget-\nwise, and how to deliver the services and investments citizens depend on\nwithout breaking the bank.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that we are in a budget crisis at the state and local\ngovernment level at the moment,\" Justin Marlowe, a research professor at the\nUniversity of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and the director of its\nCenter for Municipal Finance, told me. \"Where we are, I think, is at the very\nbeginning of the probably three-to-five-year what we might call structural\nadjustment that's going to need to happen to state and local budgets in a\npost-pandemic, post-AI world.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStates and cities struggling financially is a perennial problem. Unlike the\nfederal government, local governments can't run large deficits for long\nstretches, and many places have balanced-budget amendments. States do have\nrainy-day funds \u2014 according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, a public-policy\nnonprofit, the funds hit all-time highs in 38 states at the end of fiscal\n2023. (Most states' fiscal years run from July 1 to June 30.) But even that\ncash will only get them so far, in the near term and in the long run.\n\n> \"With expiring federal funds, the fiscal outlook looks really troublesome\n> for many states and localities\"\n\nThe recent financial troubles are a bit of a turnaround from the past four\nyears. When the pandemic hit, there was widespread concern that states and\ncities would run out of money. Instead, they started to see an increase in\nrevenue. Stimulus from the federal government to individuals via unemployment\ninsurance and stimulus checks kept households afloat, and many people started\nspending, which boosted sales-tax revenue. People's paychecks increased, along\nwith their income taxes. The federal government also provided financial\nsupport to states and cities. Now those sources of cash are starting to dry\nup.\n\n\"With expiring federal funds, the fiscal outlook looks really troublesome for\nmany states and localities,\" said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate\nwith the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\n\nIn some cases, states and cities used the extra federal money to start new\nprograms and make investments they'd long wanted to make; now they need to\nfigure out permanent funding sources. In other cases, funds helped temporarily\npaper over long-standing budgetary issues, or places took advantage of their\nsurpluses to cut taxes.\n\n\"It certainly was the case in New York City that they spent one-time money on\nongoing expenditures or even new programs,\" said Carol O'Cleireacain, an\nexpert on fiscally troubled states and localities who has worked on budget and\nplanning issues in New York, New Jersey, and Detroit. \"There was a lot of\nmoney that came in from COVID. There was a lot of revenue volatility that\nhappened, so nobody knew exactly how things were going to land, and it's taken\na while for people to sort out where it's actually landing.\"\n\nOn the revenue side of the equation, some places have seen dips. Sales-tax\nrevenues have declined, primarily in downtown areas that are still suffering\nthe consequences of remote work. The same goes for lodging taxes and revenue\nrelated to the tourism economy, and it's not clear the extent to which the\ndrivers of that \u2014 trade shows, conventions \u2014 will come back. Places that\nenacted tax cuts, like Arizona, are now having those policies come back to\nbite them. It's not clear what will happen with property taxes as office\noccupancy remains low and commercial real-estate falls in value. The office\napocalypse has put cities in a doom loop that's hard to escape as they\nstruggle to reinvent themselves and attract new interest and investment.\n\nThere are issues on the spending side, too. Inflation is hitting states and\ncities as it is people's budgets. Governments, like private businesses, are\nhaving to pay more for labor, healthcare, and even construction materials.\n\n\"What you had was just rising prices for all of the basic inputs into the\nthings that local government does \u2014 into road salt, basic commodities,\"\nMarlowe said. \"That's increasing costs generally. And so you're also then\nhaving to see pay increases as a result of that. And so that's a huge chunk of\nit.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn big cities, the migrant crisis has also been a financial drain. Places such\nas Denver and New York are spending millions of dollars to provide housing and\nsocial services for immigrants coming across the southern border, and with a\nborder deal on ice in Congress, it's a problem seemingly without a solution on\nthe horizon.\n\n\"This does not come cheap, and no one can see the end of it, so you don't know\nhow much management adjustment you have to make programmatically,\"\nO'Cleireacain said.\n\n> \"Even if a state kind of feels like it's doing OK right now, the long-term\n> picture is a little bit more concerning\"\n\nBeyond more-immediate problems in specific places, broad warning signs are\nflashing. Josh Goodman, a senior officer with the Pew Charitable Trusts who\nfocuses on state fiscal health, said most states that do long-term budget\nprojections show shortfalls. And even states that don't anticipate shortfalls\nhave some fairly pessimistic outlooks.\n\n\"Even if a state kind of feels like it's doing OK right now, the long-term\npicture is a little bit more concerning,\" he said.\n\nStates and cities are facing pressure from societal issues that will weigh on\ntax revenue and increase costs for years to come. Aging populations mean a\nsmaller percentage of the population that's of working age, putting downward\npressure on tax revenue. States and cities also have to contend with paying\nfor those populations \u2014 their healthcare, their social services. Changes in\nhow Americans get around could be an issue, too.\n\n\"If you look at transportation revenue, the gas tax is a big source of that,\"\nGoodman said. \"And as vehicles become more fuel efficient or people switch to\nelectric vehicles, that is creating problems for transportation budgets.\"\n\nOften, costs that can't really be anticipated come up. Take Maryland. The\nstate has been plagued by long-term structural deficits, said Liz Farmer, an\nofficer with the Pew Charitable Trusts who focuses on states. Like many\nplaces, it did OK for a couple of years during the pandemic. But as federal\nfunds have petered out, structural problems have resurfaced. In late March the\nstate had another wrench thrown into its fiscal plans when Baltimore's Francis\nScott Key Bridge collapsed after a ship hit it. Though the federal government\nis promising to step in and help, reconstructing the bridge is likely to cost\nthe state.\n\n\"While there's a lot of hope that federal funding will cover most of that,\nit's one more thing that Maryland is looking at,\" Farmer said. \"They're\nlooking at emergency legislation for economic relief for the workers in\nMaryland who are affected by this, and it appears as if the state is going to\ndip into the rainy-day fund.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's not entirely doom and gloom on the state and local budgetary front. The\nUnited States is not in a recession, and the macroeconomy is strong \u2014 we're\nnot in a 2008-esque situation where there are mass layoffs and the bottom\nfalls out on tax revenue. States' rainy day funds are in decent shape. But\nthere are clearly some stressors; no one knows how long the migrant crisis\nwill last, and there's no obvious fix for the deterioration of in-office\nculture. Ultimately, what happens next will be a policy question. Deciding how\nto address the conflicting priorities that come with budgets is politics as\nusual \u2014 some people in government have one set of priorities, others have\nanother, and there you go.\n\n\"Every budget season, people write budget-crisis stories,\" O'Cleireacain said.\n\"Making a budget is political trouble.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about\nbusiness and the economy.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
