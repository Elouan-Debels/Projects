Ron Wyden Says Rest Of\nGov't Should Do The Same.\n\n# Misquoting Einstein Is Fast And Stupid, But Not Accurate\n\nSay That Again\n\n### from the so-here's-an-accurate-meme dept\n\nWed, Sep 29th 2021 08:04pm - Tarah Wheeler\n\nI was writing something a while ago, and had reason to quote the famous\naphorism ?Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid; humans are\nincredibly slow, inaccurate, and smart.? I?ll bet you?ve heard a variation on\nthat quote before, and probably have seen a meme or two with it. It?s usually\nattributed to Einstein.\n\n(wait, who\u2019s Tom Asacker?)\n\nBut when you\u2019re writing a research paper, and you need to add the source\ncitation into Zotero for bibliographic and reference management, you need the\nactual publication title and date, as well as the author. So I went looking.\n\nAbout 25 links and a Wiki-hole later, I stumbled over this article by Ben\nShoemate, a web architect and developer who\u2019d come across the same problem I\nhad\u2013in 2008.\n\nBen had sought this quote as well, thinking that with tens of thousands of\nsearch results pointing to Einstein as the quote\u2019s author, there must be a\nsource somewhere.\n\nEven at NASA\u2019s showcase at the conference called Supercomputing 2006, this\nquote was attributed to Einstein, and then later fact-checked. No one can find\nout who said it. The closest anyone had gotten was Ben finding a single page\n(page 691) of a screenshotted article that seemed to have it.\n\nWell, I was sitting in England, in a small room in Oxford to be precise, in\nlockdown, a short walk from the most extensive library on earth since the\nLibrary of Alexandria first smelled smoke. I had plenty of things better to do\nbut a bee in my bonnet, nonetheless. I started trying to track down the source\narticle Ben had mentioned; it was something from the Instrument Society of\nAmerica. However, while I was a short walk from the Bodleian, the lockdown\nmeant no one could go inside. Oddly, that turned out to be a boon for this\nlittle quest. Because most university libraries in the world right now are\ncooperating with each other to an extraordinary extent, I was able to talk the\nlibrarian at the Bod into calling whichever university would have the article\nI needed\u2013the one surrounding page 691.\n\nIt turned into a combination of Telephone and Who\u2019s On First.\n\n> \u201cI need the article that contains page 691 in 1969 from the ISA.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cOk, what is the author name and the title of the article?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cI have no idea; that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to find out.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cBut the webform won\u2019t let me submit a request for an article if I don\u2019t\n> know the name of the author and title.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cBut you know the page number in the article; can you request the five pages\n> before and after that page?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cNo, I can only scan and deliver one article at a time and that might be\n> more than one article. We could breach our sharing agreement.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cWhat about getting the entire paper journal issue shipped here on\n> Interlibrary Loan?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cWe don\u2019t have the budget for that and it can take months to have a paper\n> copy shipped, even if they\u2019re willing to do so with their only copy.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cCan you call the library and see if someone will walk down there and look\n> at the article?\u201d\n>\n> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, madam, they are eight hours behind us and we share no business\n> hours in common.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cAHA they\u2019re on the West Coast of the United States, AREN\u2019T THEY??\u201d\n>\n> \u201cAhem. Perhaps I can send an email asking if someone could look around.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cThat would be lovely; thank you so much for your time.\u201d\n>\n> VICTORY.\n\nSeveral weeks later, I had this article in my inbox. From the Instrument\nSociety of America\u2019s 1969 proceedings, and written by H.D. Couture and Marion\nKeyes.\n\nH.D. Couture was at Eastex Incorporated, and didn\u2019t have too many other\narticles and patents; like many of us, it\u2019s probable that much of his\ncontributions were private or under the name of his company. Marion Keyes,\nhowever, was a prolific inventor and patent holder. Keyes seems to have been\nan electrical engineer, and I say \u201cseems to be\u201d because although I am a\nreasonably intelligent person, I have no idea what most of the words in that\npatent search listing mean.\n\nSeriously: what does \u201cA load control for a system comprised of a plurality of\nenergy converters wherein the energy output of all converters is adjusted in\nparallel to maintain the total rate of energy output from the system equal to\ndemand and wherein during steady-state conditions the rate of energy\nconversion for that converter having the lowest incremental cost is increased\nand simultaneously the rate of energy conversion for that converter having the\nhighest incremental cost is decreased a like amount\u201d even mean?\n\nI like to think that after decades in electrical engineering, Marion Keyes had\nseen it all. It turns out he was raised in Bellingham, Washington, just north\nof me here in Seattle. His obituary was lovely, and says he was survived by\nhis wife, one of their three sons, and all six of his grandchildren.\n\nH.D. Couture is harder to find, but I do know now that his name was Herbert\nDaniel Couture, Jr. He was a correspondent for the Temple-Inland Employee\nNewsletter, which rarely mentioned him other than as a writer, but does have\nhim as part of the Utilities group doing work on operational improvements. He\nis buried at the Resthaven Cemetery in Silsbee, Texas.\n\nI knew by this point that I wanted to write this down somewhere. One of the\nhardest issues in disinformation is that when there are hundreds of thousands\nof results saying that something inaccurate is true, computers cannot parse\nbetween them for the credible or true result. It might seem a bit nuts to go\nto these lengths to find a citation for a research paper, but it matters when\nI find a fact that people have been misusing. When it\u2019s a simple meme on\nTumblr, it\u2019s just annoying. When it is a fact or part of history that we use\nto build technology, security, or health policy upon, it grows much more\nimportant.\n\nBut who the heck was Ben Shoemate and how could I tell him that his quest to\nfind the Grail of Quotes was at an end...and warn him that I was about to link\nhis 13 year old Medium article? Back to the Googles I rode, finding his\nprofiles on Twitter, LinkedIn, and more. I DMed him on Twitter. I connected\nwith him on LinkedIn, I messaged him on his website\u2019s contact form, and\nemailed something I found on some lookup site. Crickets. Three different times\nI tried, and finally, I tried publicly tweeting him.\n\nBen sent me a terse email of one line (as any of us would when contacted the\nfirst time by a stranger who is requesting our time without being too\nspecific), and I replied with the PDF of the article...at which point he sent\nme back a warm and happy email so we could have a chat. We spoke for a while,\nand discovered we were something of kindred spirits in our annoyance tolerance\nfor made-up facts, as well as really enjoying digging into why someone would\npursue a source citation this far. It was a wonderful chance to reward him for\na long, long ago post that put a bit of useful information out into the world\nthat gave me a place to continue, and it?s the reason I finally have the quote\nI need for my paper.\n\nSo, in thanks for Ben?s humor and point of reference, and for H.D. Couture?s\nand Marion Keyes? humor and quotability, I give you a true meme at last:\n\nTarah Wheeler is an information security researcher and social scientist, and\na cybersecurity fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nFiled Under: albert einstein, h.d. couture, marion keyes, memes, quotes\n\n45 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Tennessee Teen Sues School For Suspending Him After He Posted Memes Mocking His Principal\n  * Teslas Are A Privacy Nightmare: Staff Regularly Shared Camera Recordings, Made Memes & Jokes At Customers' Expense\n  * The Most Famous Blunder Of Content Moderation: Do NOT Quote The Princess Bride\n  * Elon Musk's Twitter Business Model Idea: Ignore Free Speech Rights And Try To The Charge Media To Quote Tweets\n  * 576 German Artists Want EU Copyright Directive Made Worse, With No Exceptions For Memes Or Mashups\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cMisquoting Einstein Is Fast And Stupid, But Not Accurate\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n45 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nCoyne Tibbets (profile) says:\n\nSeptember 29, 2021 at 8:02 pm\n\n# Futility\n\nCorrect attribution: $1,500 plus \u2014 no doubt everyone will invest that amount\nfor each detail \u2014 to get their paper correct in every detail.\n\nSo...999 of 1000 future papers will still be misattributed, because no one can\nconfirm the correct attribution in this ocean of misattribution.

They might be, for instance, power\nplants. Converting water energy, wind energy coal, natural gas, atomically\ngenerated heat, whatever into, for instance, electricity.\n\nYou have all of these working, pouring electricity into, say, a regional power\ngrid. You want the power you are putting into the grid to stay the same, but\nyou want to make it less expensive.\n\nSo what you do is find the answers to this question: for energy converter X,\nhow much more/less expensive will it be if I increase (decrease) its power\noutput. (Aside: you probably have these answers before you start, for every\nvalue from zero to maximum for that energy converter. Something like this, you\ndon\u2019t want surprises.)\n\nHaving those answers, you then (changing things in parallel) increase the\noutput of, say, your nuclear plant while decreasing the output of your hydro\nplant. The power output remains the same, and you reduce the cost-per-\nkilowatt. (Also aside: the cost isn\u2019t always money. It could be \u2018wear\u2019. It\ncould be \u2018opportunity cost\u2019. It could be practically anything you want to\ndescribe as a \"cost\".)\n\n\"Plurality\" because you may have some energy converters in the system over\nwhich you have no immediate control, and thus cannot change on the scale you\nare looking at.\n\nSay you have a coal power plant, a hydroelectric dam, and a field of solar\ncells. The coal power plant can change its generation, but it takes\nsignificant time. The dam can change its generation fairly rapidly, but if you\npush it too hard, you run out of water to generate with. And the solar cells?\nCan\u2019t do anything much with them.\n\nNight falls, people start cooking. Also, the solar cells stop producing power.\nTo meet demand, you increase hydro generation. But you don\u2019t want to do that\nfor long, because you would eventually run out of water. So, you start\nspinning up the coal plant.\n\nThe load balancing (and incremental cost business) is, while the output from\nthe coal plant increases, you decrease the hydro output so the energy output\ntotal remains constant. This increases your ability to respond to changes in\npower demand, by increasing the range you can increase hydro if needed.\n\nThe \"cost\" in that example is somewhere between literal cost-to-operate,\n\"energy converter fuel resource\" cost, and \"ability to change\" cost. In the\nreal world, it\u2019s much more complex.\n\nThe patent? For the algorithm (or, perhaps, device) that calculates what to\nincrease, what to decrease, and when to do so.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nanon says:\n\nSeptember 29, 2021 at 11:49 pm\n\n# Re: Challenge Accepted\n\nAchievement unlocked!\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nsumgai (profile) says:\n\nSeptember 30, 2021 at 1:09 am\n\n# Re: Challenge Accepted\n\nAC, you beat me to it, but it\u2019s likely that I would\u2019ve been even more verbose.\nGood job.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nBruce C. says:\n\nSeptember 30, 2021 at 4:39 am\n\n# Re: Challenge Accepted\n\ntl;dr \u2014 it\u2019s to keep the power grid up.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nmechtheist (profile) says:\n\nSeptember 30, 2021 at 5:19 am\n\n# Re: Challenge Accepted\n\nThe word \u2018plurality\u2019 kinda jars in that patent.

[article]\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-excessive-free-speech-is-a-\nbreeding-ground-for-more-trumps/\n\n  * Drew Wilson is doing a lot of excellent work at https://freezenet.ca\n  * John Roddy: \"Is It McDonald's Responsibility To Stop Nude Photos From Getting Online?\"\n  * Just noticed some of the really old articles (this one is from 2008) don't seem to render titles properly if they show up in search results.\n  * Mike Masnick: I think that's an artifact from the switchover from our system to wordpress. it's on our list to get that fixed at some oint\n  * John Roddy: I figured as much.\n  * A lot of those articles were also published in the early days of Unicode stumbling out into the default.\n  * Wouldn't surprise me if some of that got managled as well.\n  * k_rey_c: Not sure if other cities got this blast from Axios, but smartphones are to blame: https://www.axios.com/newsletter...\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-des-\nmoines-12be19be-6e01-4296-a7a9-ffd7f3f08c07.html\n\n  * tomacamot: Yeah it's gotta be the phones, not an uncaring electorate or the planet catching fire or being told expressing themselves is a mental disorder or the total destruction of free outdoor spaces or having to dodge vehicles with poorer sight than literal tanks when they go outside or being directly exposed to multiple wars of cruelty etc etc etc\n  * k_rey_c: Right. As I responded to a friend: I really hate the conflations they make in the... article??? Haidt seems to be advertising his book. While there are obviously problems, the biggest issue I take with this framing is that it more or less claims that the solution is: 1) Get rid of Social Media (especially TikTok) and 2) Get rid of smartphones 3) ??? 4) Profit (i.e. the kids will be alright and happiness will return). The danger here is ignoring that there are very real reasons why kids and americans in general are not happy.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yeah. Haidt's book is very problematic for a long list of reasons\n  * I keep debating if it's worth writing about it at all\n  * Especially since he seems to *enjoy* it when everyone points out his research methodology, including cherry picking data, ignoring alternative hypotheses, and misstating what the data actually shows, is so problematic\n  * the WaPo review of his new book is not kind. https://www.washingtonpost.com/b...\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/03/22/anxious-generation-rewiring-\nchildhood-jonathan-haidt-review/\n\n  * Samuel Abram: The Washington Post did something *not* shitty?

One of the hosts was trying but it's difficult to counter these things unless you're really familiar with them.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yeah, that interview was disappointing. Both of them gently pushed back, but weren't as deeply aware of the research in order to do so, which let Haidt tap dance around questions and make some pretty questionable claims\n  * johnharrold.: And his suggestions were just completely unworkable. Get your kid a flip phone, all parents collectively agree not to let their kids have logins to youtube.\n  * mildconcern: It's a shame because I do think he has some good points buried in there about childhood autonomy and such being important and largely impossible in today's parenting culture.\n  * but then he takes his nascent good points and piles a dumptruck of crap on top of them when there is probably evidence that actually works for *that* point if you ignore the attempt to attack \"The tech these days!\"\n  * John Roddy: Freaking Kansas\n  * mildconcern: what did they do now?\n  * ban social media if your name ends in a consonant?\n  * BentFranklin: fascbook is evil, part 329: Project Ghostbusters: Facebook Accused of Using Your Phone to Wiretap Snapchat [article]\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/project-ghostbusters-facebook-meta-wiretap-\nsnapchat-1851366093\n\n  * Facebook snooped on users\u2019 Snapchat traffic in secret project, documents reveal [article]\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/facebook-secret-project-snooped-snapchat-\nuser-traffic/\n\n  * candescence: So one guy I follow decided to look at what kinds of engagement AI \"artists\" on Deviantart were up to and found that nearly all of it is just a bunch of bots \"interacting\" with each other in a loop\n  * [video]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DoL33Dqok\n\n  * It's basically the \"dead internet theory\" but in a subsection of a specific site\n  * John Roddy: Wow.

It's... very silly\n  * mildconcern: He clearly mastered the art of sounding reasonable while being wrong in college.\n  * Lots of people do. it's a core skill taught at my alma mater.\n  * Samuel Abram: If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what *is* your Alma mater?\n  * mildconcern: I walked into this one, alas.

Skies were clear and the crowd was shouting in northern Vermont, though I could have done without the 11 hour car ride home.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yup! We're in Texas and ended up driving pretty far out to where it was predicted to be clearer and we had a great view.\n  * John Roddy: It's funny. I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Thursday  \n  \n---  \n09:31| Elon Musk's Lawyer Faces Sanctions After Deposition Meltdown, While\nEngaging In Unauthorized Practice Of Law (14)  \n05:27| Company At Center Of Sports Illustrated, Gannett 'AI' Content Scandals\nContinues To Fail Upward (15)  \n  \n## Wednesday  \n  \n19:35| Putin Orders Russian Tech Companies To Somehow Make Competitive Game\nConsole In 3 Months (30)  \n14:33| 30 States Considering 'Right To Repair' Reforms in 2024 (6)  \n12:30| Elon Claims Twitter\u2019s Traffic Is At An All-Time High Because He Can\u2019t\nBe Bothered To Understand The Misleading Data People Show Him (40)  \n10:57| Judge Tells Corrections Officers To 'Suck It Up' If They Can't Handle\nAn Endless Stream Of Executions (56)  \n10:54| Daily Deal: The Mastering Linux Development Bundle (0)  \n09:27| Hollywood Believes The Time Is Ripe To Bring Back SOPA (111)  \n05:29| Prison Telecom Monopolies & Michigan Counties Sued For Kickback Deals\nThat Banned In-Person Visits To Boost Phone And Video Revenues (22)  \n  \n## Tuesday  \n  \n19:46| How Copyright May Destroy Our Access To The World's Academic Knowledge\n(13)  \n  \n##### More\n\n\u00d7\n\n## Email This Story\n\nThis feature is only available to registered users.
