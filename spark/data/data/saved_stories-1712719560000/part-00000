Over the past 12 months, average global\ntemperatures have been 1.58C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThis, at least temporarily, exceeds the 1.5C benchmark set as a target in the\nParis climate agreement but that landmark deal will not be considered breached\nunless this trend continues on a decadal scale.\n\nThe UK Met Office previously predicted the 1.5C goal could be surpassed over\nthe period of a year and other leading climate monitoring organisations said\nthe current levels of heating remain within the bounds anticipated by computer\nmodels.\n\nHowever the sharp increase in temperatures over the past year has surprised\nmany scientists, and prompted concerns about a possible acceleration of\nheating.\n\nDiana \u00dcrge-Vorsatz, one of the vice-chairs of the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC), noted the planet has been warming at a pace of 0.3C\nper decade over the past 15 years, almost double the 0.18C per decade trend\nsince the 1970s. \u201cIs this within the range of climate variability or signal of\naccelerated warming? My concern is it might be too late if we just wait to\nsee,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nGavin Schmidt, the director of Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies,\nnoted that temperature records are being broken each month by up to 0.2C.\n\u201cIt\u2019s humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded\nclimate scientists\u2019 predictive capabilities more than 2023 has,\u201d the successor\nto Jim Hansen wrote in a recent article for Nature.\n\nSchmidt listed several plausible causes of the anomaly \u2013 the El Ni\u00f1o effect,\nreductions in cooling sulphur dioxide particles due to pollution controls,\nfallout from the January 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai volcanic eruption in\nTonga, and the ramping up of solar activity in the run-up to a predicted solar\nmaximum.\n\nBut based on preliminary analyses, he said these factors were not sufficient\nto account for the 0.2C increase: \u201cIf the anomaly does not stabilise by August\n\u2013 a reasonable expectation based on previous El Ni\u00f1o events \u2013 then the world\nwill be in uncharted territory. It could imply that a warming planet is\nalready fundamentally altering how the climate system operates, much sooner\nthan scientists had anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe core of the problem \u2013 fossil fuel emissions \u2013 is well known and largely\nuncontested in the scientific community. A survey of nearly 90,000 climate-\nrelated studies shows a 99.9% consensus that humans are altering the climate\nby burning gas, oil, coal and trees.\n\n\u201cStopping further warming requires rapid reductions in greenhouse gas\nemissions,\u201d said Samantha Burgess, the deputy director of the Copernicus\nClimate Change Service.\n\nMichael E Mann, the scientist whose 1999 \u201chockey-stick graph\u201d showed the sharp\nrise in global temperatures since the industrial age, said the current trends\nwere to be expected given the continuing rise in emissions. But he said that\nshould not be a source of comfort. \u201cThe world is warming AS FAST as we\npredicted \u2013 and that\u2019s bad enough,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nOpposition to this view comes not from science, but the fossil fuel industry \u2013\nin particular the 57 companies linked to 80% of emissions \u2013 which stands to\nlose trillions of dollars. Last month, Saudi Aramco chief executive Amin\nNasser was applauded at an oil industry conference in Houston for declaring:\n\u201cWe should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas.\u201d This was despite\nthe fact that his country and others had agreed just four months earlier to\nmove away from fossil fuels at the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Greenhouse gas emissions\n  * Climate science\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
