The new Brave Search answer engine synthesizes\ninformation from multiple sources into a single, intelligible answer to almost\nany query\u2014a significant step forward from Brave\u2019s AI Summarizer released in\n2023.\n\nBrave Search Answer with AI is unique in several respects:\n\n  * It is the first privacy-preserving answer engine available at scale, serving the almost 10 billion queries a year that Brave Search currently receives, making it, overnight, one of the largest AI solutions on the market.\n  * It produces near instant answers (with sources cited) with sources alongside traditional search results.\n  * The answers result from the only independent search index at scale outside of Big Tech, as the largest real-time answer engines rely on the Google or Bing search engines, directly or indirectly.\n\nBrave Search\u2019s Answer with AI feature is available for free to all users\nacross platforms, on both desktop and mobile. No matter which browser users\nchoose, it can be accessed on the Web at search.brave.com. The answer engine\nalso supports multiple languages besides English. Brave Search\u2019s 27 million\nqueries a day makes it the fastest growing search engine since Bing.\n\nCaption: Clicking the Answer with AI button\n\n## The need for answer engines\n\nWeb-scale search engines have undergone many iterations: directory listings,\nten blue links, query-dependent snippets, knowledge graphs and featured\nsnippets. The Brave Search Answer with AI feature evolves this paradigm. An\nanswer engine is a system that tries to answer a question, rather than point\nto websites about the question. Thanks to the proliferation and quality of\nlarge language models (LLMs), search-integrated answer engines are now a\npossibility at scale. In fact, several companies that operate search engines\nhave released similar systems (including Bing Copilot and Google Gemini).\nOther answer engines rely on API access to existing search solutions to serve\nat least some portion of their real-time results.\n\nBrave Search released an AI tool for synthesized results known as the\nSummarizer in March 2023 to help users better navigate search results. With\ntoday\u2019s release, we\u2019re taking a big step forward in delivering a next-level\nsearch experience, whether an answer or links of page results.\n\n\u201cWith the new Brave Search and its integration of Answer with AI, users get\nthe best of both worlds: one place to get generative answers as well as up-to-\ndate links, providing instant and highly relevant results,\u201d said Josep M.\nPujol, Chief of Search at Brave. \u201cBrave Search is uniquely positioned in this\nlandscape, with the only independent search index besides Bing and Google.\nUnlike many search companies that are forced to rely on results from third\nparties, or others that solely offer answer engines, Brave now combines its\nindex with AI to redefine the search experience and raise the bar on immediate\npertinence in results, while preserving users\u2019 privacy.\u201d\n\n## What the Brave Search answer engine can do\n\nThe secret ingredient of an answer engine is not the LLM that powers it, but\nthe combination of a model with up-to-date, reliable data. Such data can help\nsupply the context from which the model derives the answers it presents to the\nuser. Or, to put it another way: an effective answer engine requires both a\nmodel and access to a search engine. With API access to a search engine, even\nindividual contributors can generate a reasonable answer engine.\n\nThis is why Brave Search\u2014with its index of 20 billion pages, curated and\ncleansed of the SEO spam and junk content that plagues other indexes\u2014is\nuniquely positioned to provide such a powerful answer engine. It has the data\nneeded to generate an accurate and timely answer, and the context.\n\nCaption: Answers enriched with text and other media\n\nWith the new answer engine, Brave Search aims to provide not just answers, but\nan integrated system to satisfy the multiple intents a user might have, and to\ndo so at scale (currently Brave Search serves more than 27 million queries per\nday). Loosely speaking, these intents fall into one of a handful of\ncategories:\n\n  * Navigational: Queries for specific sites, such as \u201cFacebook\u201d or \u201cTwitter.\u201d\n  * Informational: Question-based queries, or those seeking information, which generally fall into two subcategories:\n\n    * Specific lookups: These are often served by rich user interfaces built around structured realtime information (e.g. currency conversion rates, weather, or sports results) or custom widgets with non-real time based, deterministic data (e.g. unit conversion or time and timezone conversions).\n    * Question-like queries: Queries such as \u201cHow do I find north when hiking?\u201d\n  * Commercial: Queries with the intent of finding or researching products and services.\n  * Transactional: Queries with the intent of completing an action (e.g. buying a product).\n\nGiven relevant context, most existing answer engines do well at informational,\nquestion-like queries. However, they tend not to perform as well on other\nkinds of queries. With this latest release, Brave Search will default to an\nanswer engine experience for likely informational, question-like queries.\n\nCaption: Answers for informational queries\n\nFor all other categories, users can trigger the answer engine on demand by\nsimply clicking Answer with AI. This offers a best-in-class experience of both\noptions: an answer engine that\u2019s both predictive and optional.\n\nBrave Search\u2019s generative answers are not just text. The deep integration\nbetween the index and model makes it possible for us to combine online,\ncontextual, named entities enrichments (a process that adds more context to a\nperson, place, or thing) as the answer is generated. This means that answers\ncombine generative text with other media types, including informational cards\nand images.\n\nCaption: Answer with AI results\n\nThe Brave Search answer engine can even combine data from the index and geo\nlocal results to provide rich information on points of interest. To date, the\nBrave Search index has more than 1 billion location-based schemas, from which\nwe can extract more than 100 million businesses and other points of interest.\nThese listings\u2014larger than any public dataset\u2014mean the answer engine can\nprovide rich, instant results for points of interest all over the world.\n\nCaption: Result for point of interest\n\nCaption: Summary of top stories related to a current event\n\nCaption: Summary showing cited sources\n\n## How to try Brave Search\u2019s Answer with AI feature\n\nBrave Search can be accessed by anyone on the Web at search.brave.com, and is\nalso the default search engine in the Brave browser for multiple countries.\nAnswer with AI is available for all Brave Search users for searches in\nEnglish, French, German, Italian, and Spanish (the answer engine functionality\nis available in other languages as well, but some answers may appear in\nEnglish). It\u2019s available on all platforms, on desktop and mobile.\n\nIf Brave Search is already your default search engine, simply start a search\nin the address bar of your browser. For question-like queries, the answer\nengine should produce an answer by default, which will appear at the top of\nthe search results page. Users also have the option to request answers on-\ndemand by clicking / tapping the Answer with AI icon that appears beside the\nsearch bar on any search results page.\n\nThe Brave Search answer engine is free to all users, and we hope to keep it\nthis way, as we believe this is a natural evolution of search engines. In the\nfuture, we may also add a paid option, with premium experiences such as the\nability to have an open ended chat, possibly in conjunction with the premium\noptions offered by Brave Leo, the AI assistant in the Brave browser.\n\n## The impact of answer engines on the Web\n\nThere is a clear demand from users for convenient methods of consuming\ncontent, and AI-augmented answers are a key example. On the other hand,\ndelivering on this demand can contribute to the erosion of the incentives for\npublishers to put out content on the Web, ultimately changing its very nature.\n\nThis challenge is not unique to Brave Search, but present across most AI-\npowered answer engines and chatbots, premium or open. Brave, as both a browser\nand search engine, is aware of these challenges. Consequently, we will be\nmonitoring and quantifying the impact of AI-generated content on site visits,\nand eventually will address the disruptions that could be caused by the drop\nin traffic. We hope others are working on this as well.\n\n## Related articles\n\n## Leo is now integrated with Brave Talk video conferencing, enabling private,\nAI-supported meeting summaries, task lists, and more\n\nBrave has integrated its AI assistant Leo with Brave Talk, its video\nconferencing tool, to provide real-time meeting summaries, task lists, and\nmore for a more efficient and productive meeting experience, while maintaining\nprivacy.\n\nRead this article \u2192\n\n## With Brave Leo on iOS today, the browser AI assistant is now available on\nall platforms\n\nBrave is excited to announce the release of Leo on iOS, completing the roll-\nout of our new privacy-preserving AI assistant.\n\nRead this article \u2192\n\n## Leo\u2014Brave's privacy-preserving AI assistant\u2014now available on Android\n\nToday, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo\u2014Brave's privacy-\npreserving AI assistant built right into the browser\u2014on all Android devices.\n\nRead this article \u2192\n\n## Ready for a better Internet?\n\nBrave\u2019s easy-to-use browser blocks ads by default, making the Web cleaner,\nfaster, and safer for people all over the world.\n\nGet Brave for Linux\n\nGet Brave\n\n#### Resources\n\n  * Help center\n  * Community\n  * What's new in Brave?\n  * Release notes\n  * Status\n  * FAQs\n  * Transparency report\n  * Merch store\n\n#### Privacy policy\n\n  * Brave Browser\n  * Website & email\n  * Publishers & creators\n  * Advertisers\n  * CCPA\n\n#### Browser\n\n  * Desktop\n  * Android\n  * iOS\n  * Linux\n  * Beta\n  * Nightly\n\n#### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Blog\n  * Brand assets\n  * Careers\n  * Events\n  * GitHub\n  * Research\n  * Reviews\n  * Tor Onion address\n\n#### Social media\n\n  * Reddit\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n  * Mastodon\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n\n#### Products\n\n  * Search\n  * Rewards\n  * Wallet\n  * Firewall + VPN\n  * Talk\n  * News\n  * Playlist\n  * All features\n  * Basic Attention Token\n  * YouTube ad blocker\n\n#### Contact\n\n##### Support\n\ncommunity.brave.com\n\n##### Advertising\n\nadsales@brave.com Please only use this email address if you are interested in\npurchasing advertising with Brave.
