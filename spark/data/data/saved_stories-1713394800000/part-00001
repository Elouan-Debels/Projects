Boccaccio], Pasquerella and Madonna Babetta. Two hitherto untranslated\n> stories by Giovanni Boccaccio with some unpublished sketches by Aubrey\n> Beardsley. New York, Biblion Soc., 1927; for private circulation.^1\n\nAnd beneath it, in smaller type, a peculiar note: \u201cSono operette inventate.\u201d\nThat is to say: these are invented little works, daring forgeries produced by\nsome unscrupulous agent many years after Boccaccio\u2019s death. Who was this\nagent? No translator is mentioned, but the stories were published by the\nBiblion Society. Though its name is shared with the Erotika Biblion Society of\nLondon, publisher of the pornographic novel Teleny (often attributed to Oscar\nWilde), the Biblion Society that printed these stories was an American\nventure, based in New York. And it was run by none other than that archduke of\nliterary piracy and pornography, Samuel Roth.\n\nRoth inscribed himself fatally into the history of literary modernism as the\nfirst person to publish James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses in the United States. While The\nLittle Review had previously published excerpts from the novel, many issues of\nthis journal were seized and destroyed \u2014 and its editors charged with\ndistributing obscenity by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice \u2014\ncreating an opportunity for Roth. He was able to plan an unauthorized,\nbowdlerized, and error-ridden edition of Ulysses to appear in 1928\u201329.^2 Joyce\ntried to fight the forthcoming publication with the help of an American law\nfirm, seeking an injunction in the autumn of 1927. In a typically audacious\nresponse, Roth appealed to his readers to subscribe to a fund for his defense\nin the name of \u201cthe liberty of beauty\u201d.^3\n\nRoth\u2019s editorial license was not limited to radical modernist contemporaries \u2014\nit extended even to the most canonized figures in the western tradition. In\nour case, Giovanni Boccaccio. Printed as a \u201cliterary supplement\u201d to later\nissues of Two Worlds, \u201cPasquerella\u201d and \u201cMadonna Babetta\u201d are titillating\ntales in which illicit sex begets terrible violence, accompanied with\nillustrations (supposedly) by Aubrey Beardsley. In \u201cPasquerella\u201d, the doomed\neponymous heroine marries Count Sandro Bernini when she is fifteen years old,\nand is quickly \u201cmade aware of the demands of her marriage\u201d. She gets pregnant;\nSandro grows indifferent. Thirteen years later, her son Phillip becomes\nobsessed with Bianca, the neighbor\u2019s daughter, whom Pasquerella has hired as\nlive-in help. Bianca pleads to her employer, explaining that Phillip has a key\nto her room and breaks in at night. Pasquerella doesn\u2019t believe the young\ngirl, and decides to sleep in the room herself. In the dark, Phillip mistakes\nhis mother for his would-be lover. \u201cNever before had the core of passion\ntrembled in Pasquerella of its own accord. Under the delicate considerately\ntenuous fingers of her son it shot into sudden flower.\u201d Disgusted the next\nmorning, she sends him away, under the pretense of education, and gives birth\nto a child eight months after, whom she abandons to an abbey. Many years\nlater, Phillip returns as a war hero with a new wife, Pamela, and Pasquerella\nis overcome with \u201cstrange, rapidly intensifying emotions\u201d. She recognizes the\nyoung woman: it is her child \u2014 Phillip has married his sister and daughter.\nLike an Italian Oedipa, Pasquerella sneaks into their room while they are\nsleeping, returning to the primal scene \u2014 \u201cstrange forces were working within\nher, directing her daggered hand, forcing it . . .\u201d \u2014 and ends the chain of\nincest once and for all.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nTitle page from Pasquerella and Madonna Babetta (1927) \u2014 Source.\n\nIn \u201cMadonna Babetta\u201d, a Neapolitan priest named Lorenzo befriends his\nProtestant neighbor, Cornelius, \u201ca young man of remarkable physical\nattractiveness\u201d. They take long walks, discuss religion: \u201cAh, I see, sighed\nCornelius, We burn in hell for the sin of having intercourse with pretty\nwomen.\u201d An aristocrat named Madonna Babetta captures Father Lorenzo\u2019s ear and\ntwists the sacrament of confession to her own sordid purposes, claiming that\nCornelius has been ogling her in the evenings. Upon hearing these rumors from\nLorenzo, Cornelius decides to do exactly the thing he is charged with, hiding\nin Madonna Babetta\u2019s garden, \u201choping to catch a glimpse of his evil double\u201d.\nWhen he locks eyes with his accuser, she smiles at him knowingly, and\nCornelius recognizes the ruse for what it is. They become lovers. One day,\nMadonna Babetta murders her husband Helvetius with a dagger, and asks that\nCornelius bind her to the bed, arranging the room \u201cas if a desperate struggle\nhad taken place\u201d. When Cornelius later expresses guilt for complicity in her\nscheme, Madonna Babetta embraces him, dagger in hand, and he slumps over,\ndead. Taking up the pipe and magnifying glass, Father Lorenzo enters the\nwidow\u2019s garden himself in order to ascertain how two respected men have\nreturned to God before their time. He deduces Madonna Babetta\u2019s role and\nstorms into her bedchamber, demanding a confession for double homicide.\n\u201cFather, she breathed. Would you not murder to have me now?\u201d We cut to the\nfuture:\n\n> The sainted Father Lorenzo is seen often mounting the street to the Via\n> Nilla at that hour between four and six when the sea about Naples seems to\n> swoon at the approach of the fiery sun, but it is doubtful whether he is\n> preoccupied with the state of Madonna Babetta\u2019s soul, or that the Madonna\n> has so many sins to confess, for the maid servant has never yet heard, that\n> chant beginning. . . . In Nomine Patri . . . issuing from her mistress\u2019\n> chamber.\n\nThe setting of Pasquerella and Madonna Babetta is a pastiche of premodern\nItaly \u00e0 la Boccaccio: full of villas, confessors, and passionate, murderous\nwomen.^4 The stories are rather entertaining, but there are irregularities of\nstyle and detail that would not be found in the authentic works of\nBoccaccio.^5 Though there are many transgressive women in Boccaccio\u2019s work,\ntheir depiction is in stark contrast to the lurid, extended violence of\nPasquerella and Madonna Babetta. There are also issues of a historical nature.\nTouched as we may be by the friendship between Catholic and Protestant, it is\nimportant to remember that Martin Luther was born more than a century after\nBoccaccio\u2019s death. Or take for example the colorful mishmash of names, whose\nmorphological disunity is characteristic of archaizing, foreignizing works:\nthe Italian Lorenzo and his good friend, the Latin Cornelius; Madonna Babetta\nand her husband, Helvetius.^6\n\nBut Roth was not just content to expand the canon of Boccaccio \u2014 he wanted to\ndo Aubrey Beardsley the same favor. The \u201chitherto unpublished\u201d Boccaccio\nstories discovered by the Biblion Society were to be illustrated \u201cWith Some\nHitherto Unpublished Sketches by Aubrey Beardsley\u201d. In fact, all of the\nillustrations by Beardsley had already been printed. The first, depicting a\nnaked angel, which Roth titled \u201cNew Sketch\u201d, had already been published in\n1898 under the name \u201cMirror of Love\u201d. The next four full-page illustrations,\nall featuring people looking pensive and forlorn amid vegetation, come from\nthe Dent edition of Malory\u2019s Le Morte d\u2019Arthur (1892) \u2014 the blank and white\nboxes in their top right corners were supposed to contain chapter numbers. The\nfinal full-page illustration is \u201cLysistrata Haranguing the Athenian Women\u201d,\nfrom an edition of Aristophanes printed privately in 1896.^7\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nIllustrations by Aubrey Beardsley titled \u201cNew Sketch\u201d in Pasquerella and\nMadonna Babetta (1927).

Finding the origin of these illustrations provides\na helpful context for the Boccaccio stories published by Roth. All three of\nthese drawings are in fact by the Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany, and were\npublished as illustrations to a 1926 edition of The Songs of Bilitis. Released\nin 1894 under the title Les Chansons de Bilitis, these erotic poems were\noriginally publicized as supposed translations from the Greek poet Bilitis, a\ncontemporary of Sappho. In reality, they were written by the Belgian-born poet\nPierre Lou\u00ffs who, in the 1926 edition from which Roth must have taken the\nillustrations, presents himself as the author, not the translator. Les\nChansons de Bilitis are thus pseudotranslations: works of literature that\nclaim to be translations from another language but are in fact original\ncompositions by their would-be translator. Intentional or not, lifting\nillustrations from Bilitis associates Roth\u2019s stories with contemporary\nEuropean pseudotranslations.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nIllustration by Willy Pogany for Pierre Lou\u00ffs\u2019 pseudotranslation of Bilitis,\ncredited as a work by Aubrey Beardsley in Pasquerella and Madonna Babetta\n(1927) \u2014 Source.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nSpread from Pasquerella and Madonna Babetta (1927) containing illustrations by\nWilly Pogany for a 1926 edition of Pierre Lou\u00ffs\u2019 pseudotranslation of Bilitis,\ncredited as a works by Aubrey Beardsley \u2014 Source.\n\nOne wonders why Roth would select images from a pseudotranslation for this\nvolume. Was the decision, in fact, a sort of wink toward the camera, a playful\nadmission of guilt for the inquiring contemporary reader, or, beyond the\ngrave, toward the future collator of his work? Or was the inclusion of these\nimages purely pragmatic: he saw they were effective for marketing one forgery,\nso why not for his own? Roth produces a space of unanswerable questions as his\nlegacy.\n\nAt first glance, it can be tempting to group \u201cPasquerella\u201d and \u201cMadonna\nBabetta\u201d with Pogany\u2019s Bilitis or James Macpherson\u2019s Poems of Ossian,\nrelatively poor forgeries which purported an ancient source. A simple\nexplanation for their provenance would be that \u201cPasquerella\u201d and \u201cMadonna\nBabetta\u201d were fabricated by Roth or by someone in his employ. And if this were\ntrue, the case would likely be closed . . . but two pamphlets, written in\nYiddish and published at the turn of the century by the Hebrew Publishing\nCompany, make this story all the more strange.\n\n***\n\nEven if you are a student of Yiddish literature, there is a good chance you\nhave never heard the name Dovid-Moyshe Hermalin. He, like Roth, was an\nimmigrant to America. He came from Romania in 1885, when he was twenty years\nold, and died when Roth was seventeen. One is tempted to imagine a meeting\nbetween the two, perhaps in a cafeteria on the Lower East Side, where you\ncould get stewed fruit: the Yiddish writer in the last year of his life and\nthe young correspondent for the New York Globe. But, with no record of its\noccurrence, to describe such a meeting is pure fabulation. Though Hermalin was\namong the most prolific and popular Yiddish men of letters in his day, he has\nbeen all but forgotten. This is likely because his writings would be\nclassified post facto as shund, and thus excluded from the Yiddish canon.\nLiterally, shund derives from a German term referring to the unusable remnants\nof an animal left over after slaughter and processing, but in Yiddish it\nmeans, more or less, \u201ctrash literature\u201d, or perhaps more generously \u201cpulp\nfiction\u201d.^8 Shund literature usually appeared in newspapers, and the stories\nwere often titillating, full of sex and suspense, and written to sell. Around\nthe turn of the century, vocal Yiddish intellectuals began to rail against\nshund, decrying it a poor representative of Jewish culture and deleterious for\nthe impressionable Yiddish-reading public.\n\nThis was a common critique: shund literature was too indebted to European\nmodels, too bound up in translation, to be properly Jewish. It did not conform\nto a politics of Jewish national autonomy. According to the leading Yiddish\nintellectuals at the time, Jewish literature, like the Jewish people, needed\nbe one among many, on the same plane as the peoples and literatures of Europe,\nnot dependent on or subservient to them. The Yiddish authors who have been\ncanonized, and therefore disproportionately translated, are those whose work\nconformed, mainly, to a non-shund model. Recent projects have tried to turn\nthe tide of research away from canonical Yiddish literature and toward shund,\nacknowledging its central position in the reading lives of Yiddish speakers\nand recovering its visibility.^9\n\nHermalin wrote shund novels alongside works of popular philosophy and\njournalism, but it seems his real specialty was the translation or adaptation\nof popular European authors for the Yiddish-reading public. In our database of\ntranslations into Yiddish, we have so far identified twenty-four such works.\nHe wrote \u201cadaptations\u201d of Goethe, Conan Doyle, Swift, Maupassant, Zola,\nShakespeare, Tolstoy, and, as you might have guessed, Boccaccio. He generally\nworked with the Hebrew Publishing Company of New York, one of the most\nprolific producers of Yiddish reading material during those boom times, when\nvarious Czars\u2019 censors, all but banning the Yiddish publishing within Russia,\ninadvertently turned New York into the printing press for the Yiddish world.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nIllustration by Willy Pogany for Pierre Lou\u00ffs\u2019 pseudotranslation of Bilitis,\ncredited as a work by Aubrey Beardsley in Pasquerella and Madonna Babetta\n(1927) \u2014 Source.\n\nAround the turn of the century, Hermalin produced two adaptations of\nBoccaccio: Paskarela with the press of B. Rabinovits, and Madam Babeta with\nthe Hebrew Publishing Company. In contrast to Roth\u2019s \u201chitherto untranslated\u201d,\nit is stated on the cover page of both stories that Hermalin had \u201cbaarbet\u201d\n(adapted) these works from Boccaccio. This gives him a little wiggle room,\nthough the introduction to Madam Babeta does explicitly state that it is \u201cone\nof the best stories from the Decameron\u201d.\n\nPaskarela and Madam Babeta are longer versions of those same stories that Roth\nprinted in English twenty-seven years later. Unless some proto-version of\nthese two stories surfaces, the most likely explanation seems to be that the\ntales were composed by Hermalin as pseudotranslations of Boccaccio, and that\nRoth (or someone close to him) translated these stories and passed them off\nonce more as authentic, lost stories by Boccaccio. By birth a Galician Jew,\nRoth knew Yiddish, and used Yiddish sources to produce translations of\nHeinrich Heine, since he had no German.^10 He was also an inveterate publisher\nof phony translations, with sensational titles such as 1941\u2019s I Was Hitler\u2019s\nDoctor and 1951\u2019s My Sister and I, supposedly a lost work by Nietzsche. He had\nthe means, the motivation, and the sheer brazenness necessary to take a pair\nof Yiddish fakes, translate them into English, and pass them off as genuine\ndiscoveries to an unsuspecting literary public.^11\n\nRoth was situated in a strange middle place. The free way he dealt with\nauthorship has much in common with the prior generation of Jewish-American\nliterary production. He would have done well with the Hebrew Publishing\nCompany, where, for example, Thomas Mayne Reid was falsely presented as Jules\nVerne, and German adventure novels were published as the work of Jewish\nauthors.^12\n\nOf course, if Roth were to market Hermalin\u2019s pseudo-Boccaccio to his literary,\nanglophone market, the stories would have to be adapted. The English versions\nare significantly shorter than the Yiddish (in the case of \u201cPasquerella\u201d,\nseventeen vs. eighty-three pages), and the style of the English is\nsignificantly more reserved. The Yiddish narrator delights in parables \u2014 he\nphilosophizes on the incontinence of human nature, on inexorable desire, and\nhe often addresses the reader directly. At one point, he asks us: \u201cHave you\never plucked a rose from a bush? Yes?\u201d and then uses the rest of the paragraph\nto compare Pasquerella to that rose. Roth\u2019s version, conversely, sticks to\nindirect, third-person narration, and pretends toward a sort of Anglo-Saxon\ndignity. For example, that same rose simile is retained in the English, but it\nis framed instead as \u201cWhoever has plucked a rose from its branch . . .\u201d The\nYiddish version is also significantly more explicit in its descriptions.\nHermalin describes the large bosoms, plump arms, and broad shoulders of\nPasquerella and Babetta with relish, over and over, and the blood of their\nmurdered victims is bright red and comes forth in lurid sprays. Roth,\npublishing for a public with literary pretensions, seemed to think it wise to\ntone down the extravagance.^13\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nIllustrations by Aubrey Beardsley, originally published in the 1892 Dent\nedition of Malory\u2019s Le Morte d\u2019Arthur, reproduced in Pasquerella and Madonna\nBabetta (1927) as previously unseen sketches \u2014 left, right.\n\nHad Roth wanted, he certainly could have found other famous works of\nquestionable provenance in the Yiddish press. Hermalin produced two more\nBoccaccio \u201cadaptations\u201d entitled Printsesin Tsuleyka (Princess Zuleika) and Di\nTsvey Poorlakh (The Two Couples). Printsesin Tsuleyka is actually a\nsignificantly expanded adaptation of a real story from the Decameron: the\nseventh story of the second day, about the Sultan of Babylon who sent his\ndaughter Alatiel to the King of Algarve as a wife. But under Hermalin\u2019s hand,\nAlatiel\u2019s name changes to Zuleika, which also happens to be the traditional\nname for Potiphar\u2019s wife, the Egyptian woman who tried to seduce Joseph. This\nbiblical story is referenced in both versions of Babetta, and seems to have\nexerted a special force on Hermalin. And how could it not have? Being, as it\nis, one of the shund-ier parts of the Hebrew bible.^14\n\n***\n\n\u201cMadonna Babetta\u201d and \u201cPasquerella\u201d, in Yiddish and in English, are but two of\ncountless examples of unlicensed literary appropriations. And although they\nare, in a sense, rather poor forgeries, they reveal the curious and irreverent\nways in which literature is reproduced and kept alive across the boundaries of\nclass and nation by means of adaptation. Boccaccio was an adapter himself: he\ntook material for the Decameron from the whole wealth of narratives that were\navailable to him \u2014 from French, Italian, and Latin sources \u2014 which in turn\nadapted stories of non-European origin, probably composed in Arabic and\nSanskrit.^15 Boccaccio reworked them as he saw fit, and wove them together to\ncreate his opus. The Decameron itself was an anthology of adaptations, held\ntogether by a well-wrought frame narrative.\n\nA history of translation is incomplete without a proper charting of the\nmuddied streams of unlicensed adaptation, false attribution, and\npseudotranslation. Born beside on tributary of the Dniester and buried near\nthe Hudson, Roth, like Hermalin, called this contentious space home. As did\nBoccaccio, some six-hundred years prior. But while the Decameron has been\nthoroughly canonized, the texts that Roth, Hermalin, and their comrades\nproduced by these practices have been forgotten, relegated to the dustbin of\nliterary studies as shund, marginalized as curiosities. A shame, because texts\nof this sort constituted an outsized proportion of the material that readers\nactually read. Texts like these, and not the canonized classics, were the\nbread and butter of the popular press. To understand the functions and methods\nof translation as they were and are \u2014 not as they are supposed to be \u2014 we must\nturn attention to these stories.\n\nBoccaccio, Hermalin, and Roth all belong to the same tradition. They are\ncollators, adaptors, collectors, and tellers of tales. And if we are to study\nthem, then we must be too. All the more so because Hermalin and Roth did not\nprovide frame narratives for their stories: they published no acknowledgements\nwith their texts; none of that sinew which connects the femur to the hip.\nPerhaps out of piety, that fleshy byproduct, the origin of shund, was thrown\naway. So it is up to us to produce the frame story for Hermalin and Roth \u2014 to\nbring bones together, put tendons and flesh upon them. This is done by\nproblematizing these fraught and fascinating moments of transmission: fleshing\nout the story. Or, otherwise, by fishing around in the trash.\n\nNotes\n\n  1. We want to thank the Ente Nazionale Giovanni Boccaccio for pointing us toward this source.\n  2. Whereas The Little Review had a circulation of 500 copies, estimates put Roth\u2019s journal Two Worlds at 50,000, giving him de facto control over publicity. See Jay A. Gertzman, Samuel Roth, Infamous Modernist (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2013), 90.\n  3. Joyce would get revenge in characteristic form, immortalizing Roth as \u201cRot him\u201d in Finnegans Wake. See Leo Hamalian, \u201cNobody Knows My Names: Samuel Roth and the Underside of Modern Letters,\u201d Journal of Modern Literature vol. 3, no. 4 (1974): 912\u201313. See also Jay A. Gertzman, \u201cNot Quite Honest: Samuel Roth s \u2018Unauthorized\u2019 Ulysses and the 1927 International Protest\u201d, in Joyce Studies Annual (2009): 34\u201366.\n  4. It is beyond the frame to provide a full overview of women in Boccaccio's works, but their centrality is undoubtable: it is to them and for their pleasure that the Decameron was written (so the introduction claims). Women make up not just the majority of the narrators, but also of the characters. In the Decameron, they play tricks on their husbands, or are tricked upon; they are the desired object of plots with different levels of complexity; they are capricious and capable of great mercy; they entertain lovers or remain, despite temptation, faithful wives. Boccaccio, with considerable temperance, steadily refused leaning into the misogynistic frames for women. For this reason, he remained no stranger to portraying morally ambiguous women: In his De mulieribus claris (Of famous women), the criteria for a place in the anthology was not Christian moral goodness, but simply fame of character. Women not conforming to Christian virtue were not excluded \u2013 their presence was justified by accompanying moral comment, inviting the good reader to virtue and holiness in contrast to the actions he was recounting. However, the women of the two stories under treatment here probably took things a bit too far even for Boccaccio's relatively liberal humanistic sensibility. See Vittorio Zaccaria, Boccaccio narratore, storico, moralista e mitografo (Florence: Olschki, 2001).\n  5. Out of the many contributions he offered to nascent Italian literature, Boccaccio is mostly known for his prose masterpiece, the Decameron (\u201cof ten days\u201d), to which the knowledgeable reader of Two Worlds would have been tempted to ascribe these stories, if choosing to believe Roth\u2019s title page. Written around 1350, at a time when Italian literature and language were still unfixed, this lengthy anthology proposed a model of everyday language that provided a counterbalance for Dante\u2019s sublime poetic standard, helping create the modern novel. In it, a group of seven young girls and three boys flee to the Florence countryside to escape the Black Death ravaging the city. To make the time pass more agreeably, they delight each other with praying, physical games, and storytelling. Each day a newly elected king or queen of the day is invested with the power to choose a theme, upon which every member of the brigade must elaborate. As such, over the span of ten days, one hundred stories are told by the ten narrators. Through this corpus, Boccaccio represented medieval Italian society transversally, touching on the values and idiosyncrasies of various social classes through tales of noble knights and crafty paupers. With these stories and their telling inside of the narrative frame, humanity is symbolically rebuilt into a harmonious whole, and civilization is reconstructed after the devastation of the plague. The Decameron, with its lush narrative offering, has proved essential to Italian prose, and Boccaccio has risen to the status of canonized Western genius. As such, there is a desire to treat him as a Faustian figure, bringing his stories into the world ex nihilo. But in reality, Boccaccio was a gifted collector and reteller \u2014 alike in kind to the Decameron\u2019s storytellers. His style of authorship is somewhat foreign to our own, and has much to do with premodern scribal culture; Boccaccio collated and expanded upon oral and written narrative sources available to him. While some of his \u201coriginal\u201d (i.e., previously unrecorded) stories have come to permeate the European imagination, the Boccaccio anthology has been pillaged, imitated, and expanded both inside and across its national borders.\n  6. The texts, their salaciousness and irreverence, are spiritual forerunners to the schlocky, softcore Boccaccio films produced in Italy in the 1970s, which used the medieval setting of the Decameron, with its air of permissiveness, to stage erotic adventures infused with a base sense of humor. The genre originated in 1971 with Pasolini\u2019s highly acclaimed Decameron, which reinterpreted Boccaccio\u2019s bonhomish acceptance of human error as a celebration of (primarily male) sensuality. Many movies followed, less acclaimed, more interested in bare-chested ladies and licentious clergy. Like Roth, the spielers of the so-called \u201cDecamerotico\u201d made claims of expanding the original Boccaccio canon: for example, Decameron II: The Other Novels of Boccaccio (1972) by Guerrini, Decameron III: The Most Beautiful Women of Boccaccio (1972) by Alfaro, and Decameron IV: The Beautiful Novels of Boccaccio (1972) by Blanchini. All three of these films fully captivated swaths of the Italian public. The reaction to these films was not unlike the reaction that Boccaccio\u2019s work has faced for centuries: loathed by pious critics, loved by the broader public.\n  7.

Smithers, a friend and publisher to Oscar Wilde, was in many ways a colleague of our Roth, being the founder of the \u201coriginal\u201d Erotika Biblion Society, through which he published \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cpornographic\u201d art with a very licentious approach to copyright, famously ignoring Beardsley\u2019s plea to cease distributing his drawings after his conversion to Catholicism.\n  8. This term nicely prefigures Moretti's Slaughterhouse of Literature, where the slaughterhouse is used as a metaphor to describe the process of exclusion of the vast majority of published literature from the common.\n  9. See, for example, Saul Zaritt's database of Yiddish fiction published in newspapers. Available at: shund.org\n  10. Roth was born in 1893 to a Jewish family in Nyshche, on the banks of the Strypa, a tributary of the Dniester. In those days, the town was a part of the Galicia region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and it was called by a Polish name: Nuszcze. Roth had a different name too: Mishillim (the Polish Yiddish equivalent of Hebrew Meshullam, which means \u201cbefriended\u201d, \u201cat peace with\u201d). He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1903, where he assumed the name Samuel.\n  11. It should be noted that there are two places where the chain of transmission is unclear: the movement into Yiddish, and the movement into English. The existence of a prototype for these stories \u2014 perhaps in German, perhaps not even pretending to be a story by Boccaccio, from which both the Yiddish and the English were translated \u2014 is certainly a possibility. Seeing, however, as Roth did not know German, and both the Yiddish and the English versions pretend to be translations of Boccaccio, this seems unlikely. It is also possible, however far-fetched, that the Yiddish version was translated into another language (maybe even English), and it is from this version that Roth drew. This option also seems unlikely. With the evidence that we have, the most plausible scenario is that Roth derived his English versions from Hermalin\u2019s Yiddish texts. The provenance of Hermalin\u2019s stories, the degree to which they can be considered adaptations or translations from known and unknown sources, is up for debate.\n  12. The case of Roth and Hermalin is one of those rather rare, or otherwise rarely cataloged, moments in which a Yiddish text was secretly appropriated for an English audience. English texts, on the other hand, were extensively adapted into Yiddish, with all sorts of license taken. There is, in fact, a beautiful, near-mirror image of Roth and Hermalin\u2019s case, in which an English translation, falsely attributed, was adapted into Yiddish and published with that false attribution. Between 1914 and 1919, a fifteen-volume edition of the collected works of Maupassant appeared in Yiddish. The stories were translated by Leon Kobrin, a prolific writer who also translated Zola, Turgenyev, and Artsybashev. These volumes, however, contain many stories which Maupassant never wrote. It seems that Kobrin was translating from a collected works of Maupassant in English, published in the first years of the twentieth century by an enterprising publisher named M. Walter Dunne. In these volumes, Dunne printed \u2014 alongside perfectly authentic stories, novels, and journalism \u2014 a number of short stories by Richepin (e.g., La Dette), Maizeroy (e.g., L'Accent), and Sacher-Masoch (e.g., Ein Exotischer Prinz), passing them off as authentic works by Maupassant. Here too these stories are attributed to Maupassant, and they follow the English translations published by Dunne very closely. See Kazuhiko Adachi, \u201cMaizeroy, Richepin et Sacher-Masoch: Les Oeuvres Faussement Attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 Maupassant Dans Sa Traduction Anglaise\u201d, in \u897f\u6d0b\u6587\u5b66\u7814\u7a76 (Studies in Western Literature), no. 34 (2014). Available here.\n  13. Nonetheless, certain Jewish traces remain: Father Lorenzo, the priest in Madonna Babetta, does not wear a cossack, but instead, as he does in the Yiddish, a kaftan; he does not speak of Hell, or damnation, or inferno, but instead, as he does in the Yiddish, of Gehenna.\n  14. We have not yet made careful study of Hermalin's final piece of boccaccesco, Di Tsvey Poorlakh, but it seems to be another original story.\n  15. The Decameron does not cite its sources, making it difficult to say with certainty where exactly the stories come from. Nonetheless, scholars have traced some of the stories to Arabic and Sanskrit sources. See, for example, Marcus Landau, Die Quellen des Dekameron: von Dr. Marcus Landau.
