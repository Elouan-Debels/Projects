This information can be helpful to Wikipedia\ncontributors in understanding how Wikipedia is organized.\n\nNo attempt is made to evaluate whether Wikipedia is in fact governed in the\nway it claims to be governed, nor is any attempt made to evaluate the adequacy\nof this structure to meet the ever-changing demands upon an online\nencyclopedia. This discussion is based entirely upon the English language\nWikipedia; its applicability to other language Wikipedias has not been\nexamined.\n\nFor a discussion on the various user access levels, see Wikipedia:User access\nlevels.\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\nThe contributors or editors of Wikipedia participate subject to a number of\npolicies and guidelines governing behavior and content. These rules are\nsupervised by various authorities: Jimmy Wales, nominally in a position of\nultimate authority, although he has deferred in most instances to the\nleadership of Wikipedia,^[1]^[2] the ~34^[3] present Bureaucrats or Crats, the\n~700^[4] active Administrators or Admins, and another group called the\nArbitration Committee or ArbCom with 15-18 members or Arbs, depending upon the\nrules adopted each year. In July 2012 there were 14 active arbitrators\nidentified, all of whom were administrators, although this is not a set\nrule.^[5] The Wikimedia Foundation or its designated agents also have\nauthority to impose bans against IP addresses for pages, topics, or the entire\nsite.^[6] The Arbitration Committee \"has no jurisdiction over official actions\nof the Wikimedia Foundation or its staff\".^[7]\n\nAn up-to-date count of all Wikipedia participants in each functional capacity\nis maintained at Wikipedia:Wikipedians.\n\n### Editors[edit]\n\nEditors, or Wikipedians, are any regular contributor to Wikipedia, whether\nregistered user or contributing through an IP address.\n\n### Bureaucrats[edit]\n\nBureaucrats or Crats are a category introduced in 2004, and have only a few\nlimited activities. Among these, they may remove Administrators if so\ninstructed by the Arbitration Committee, and appoint Administrators and\nBureaucrats following a selection procedure. Selection follows a discussion\nprocess, Bureaucrats decide what criteria constitute a \"consensus\" upon\nappointment, at the end of which a Bureaucrat reviews the situation to see\nwhether there is a \"consensus\". For appointment of Bureaucrats, consensus must\nexceed ~85%, but final judgment is one of Bureaucrat discretion.^[8] As a\nresult, Bureaucrats have almost complete control over appointment of new\nBureaucrats. The number of newly appointed Bureaucrats has steadily declined\nover the years, with only two successful candidacies in 2011. Bureaucrats\nserve indefinitely.\n\n### Administrators[edit]\n\nThe activities of Administrators or Admins are described in a how-to guide\ninstructing Administrators on the use of their powers. One authority is the\nability to block users' IP addresses or IP address ranges to enforce bans or\nto prevent disruption of the project.^[9] Blocks by an Administrator \"must\nsupply a clear and specific block reason that indicates why a user was\nblocked.\"^[10] Although a reason for a block must be given, there is no formal\nrequirement for advance notice. A number of templates for common explanations\nare available, and further explanation by the Admin is not required.\n\nThere is a distinction between a ban and a block. One difference is that,\nunless imposed directly by Jimmy Wales or the Wikimedia Foundation, a ban\nrequires \"consensus\",^[11] while a block can be imposed by a single\nAdministrator and prevents editing to some degree, large or small.^[12]\nAnother difference is that a ban is a formal warning outlining restrictions\nunder which a contributor may edit without sanction but, unlike a block, does\nnot impose such restrictions directly. Enforcement occurs should it happen\nthat an individual Administrator judges the ban has been violated. Upon that\nconclusion, without further consultation, that Administrator can impose\nsanctions suggested in the ban to enforce that ban.^[11] If such action\nresults in a block, \"Unblocking will almost never be acceptable when the block\nis explicitly enforcing an active Arbitration remedy and there is not ArbCom\nauthorization or 'a clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved\neditors at a community discussion noticeboard (such as\nWikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard or Wikipedia:Administrators'\nnoticeboard/Incidents)'\"^[13]\n\nNumber of Wikipedians applying for Administrator privileges on English\nWikipedia. (Data from Wikipedia.)\n\nAnother activity of Administrators is the granting of permissions to\ncontributors to augment their editing capabilities.\n\nThe nomination and selection of Administrators is supervised by Bureaucrats,\nwho decide whether, in their opinion, a candidate has garnered sufficient\nsupport in the discussion of a candidacy, a process like that for appointing\nBureaucrats. A \"consensus\" exceeding ~70% is required, but the judgement of\nBureaucrats is the deciding factor. A list of unsuccessful requests shows the\nnumber of refusals peaked at 543 in 2006 with 353 acceptances, and has\nsteadily declined since as the number of applicants has dropped off, with only\n155 refusals and 75 acceptances in 2010, and 88 refusals and 52 acceptances as\nof 2011 (about a 3.4% increase in membership).\n\nAdministrators serve indefinitely, but can have their administrative status\nremoved by Bureaucrats if the Arbitration Committee formally requests it.^[14]\n\"Throughout the history of the project, there has been a convention that\nadminship may be removed only in cases of clear abuse.\"^[15] A possible\nexception to the \"clear abuse\" criterion is the Restriction on arbitration\nenforcement activity, which appropriates to the Arbitration Committee the\npower to limit an Administrator's activities whenever the Arbitration\nCommittee deems that Administrator \"consistently make[s] questionable\nenforcement administrative actions\", and to decommission the Administrator if\nthey override another Administrator's actions without the Arbitration\nCommittee's written authorization or \"clear, substantial, and active consensus\nof uninvolved editors\".^[16]\n\nAs of 2009 there had been 47 removals during the history of WP, and following\n2009 no public record has been maintained of these actions.^[17] Of the\napproximately 1,526 Administrators empowered, 207 (or 13.5%) have declared\nthemselves open to recall under circumstances devised by themselves.^[18]^[19]\n\nThere is a provision for possible removal of inactive Administrators, but \"if\nthe user returns to Wikipedia, they may be resysopped by a bureaucrat without\nfurther discussion\".^[20]\n\nAlthough attempts have been made to implement a community-based removal of\nAdministrators,^[21] none has ever been agreed upon.\n\n### Arbitration Committee[edit]\n\nSee also: Wikipedia:Editing environment\n\nAverage number of blocks/day each month in 2012. Data from English\nWikipedia.Requests by Wikipedians for formal full arbitration cases by year on\nEnglish Wikipedia. Sanctions are imposed by other mechanisms as well. (Data\nfrom Wikipedia.)\n\nMembers of the Arbitration Committee (referred to as ArbCom), or Arbs, act in\nconcert or in sub-groups to impose binding solutions to conduct disputes the\ncommunity has been unable to resolve, mainly by defining what constitutes a\nviolation in such disputes and imposing sanctions, such as bans and blocks\nupon users.\n\nArbCom has very wide latitude in adjudication, as indicated by the following\nfreedoms: ArbCom is free to widen or to divert a case to any subject of their\nchoosing.^[22] They are empowered to rule preemptively based upon conjectures\nabout the future.^[23]^[24] Rulings need not follow guidelines and policies;\ndeliberations are not based upon the \"rule of law\".^[25]^[26] They are free to\nadopt opinion,^[27] and are not required to assess \"who said what in the\npast\".^[24]\n\nThough disputes commonly arise over content, with the exception of topic bans\nthe Arbitration Committee explicitly excludes all content issues from their\ndeliberations and focuses upon disciplinary actions.^[28]\n\n    \n\n    The difference between edit warring as disruptive behavior and as an attempt to straighten out what an article says may depend upon who is considering the issue.^[29]\n\nAlthough edit warring in principle refers to article editing, in practice it\nis considered disruptive to argue too much on the Talk page as well, and\nextended discussion may be viewed as tendentious editing, or refusal to get\nthe point, or interfering with consensus,^[30] all forms of misconduct and\ntherefore subject to discipline.\n\nAside from enforcing an end to disputes, the Arbitration Committee can expunge\nmaterial from any form of usual access, or give specific users the ability to\nremove some types of edits from the revision history, for example, material\nconsidered defamatory.^[31] These powers also can be exercised by Stewards of\nWikimedia.^[32]\n\nThe Arbitration Committee can request Bureaucrats to exercise de-Adminship\nunder the circumstances described under Administrators.\n\nArbitrators are elected annually in one-year or overlapping two-year terms,\nand also can be appointed directly by Wales or the Wikimedia Foundation. The\nelection rules are debated each year. Although nomination is subject only to\nrather broad criteria, in practice only Administrators have succeeded in being\nselected as Arbitrators.^[33]\n\n### Wikimedia Foundation[edit]\n\nWikipedia is one of a dozen projects of Wikimedia,^[34] an organization owned\nand operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.^[35] Among the functionaries of\nWikimedia are the Stewards^[36] of the Wikimedia wikis who have complete\naccess to the wiki interface on all Wikimedia wikis, including the ability to\nchange any and all user rights and groups, view user information in cases of\nabuse, and so on; and the SysOps of the Wikimedia Meta-Wiki,^[37] who manage\nand maintain the Wikimedia Foundation servers. The tools used by the Stewards\nin exercising control over the wikis of Wikimedia are described in a\nhandbook.^[38] They are guided by the Stewards policy, and are elected.^[39]\nSome indication of the control given to Stewards and System Administrators can\nbe found on the Wikimedia web pages.^[40]\n\nThe overall control is by the ten-member Wikimedia Board of Trustees of whom\nJimmy Wales is Chairman Emeritus and a member. The present membership is found\nhere and some historical data here.\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Wikipedia:Banning policy \u2013 Appeals and discussions\".
