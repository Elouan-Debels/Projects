Sufferers\noften feel as though they are observing the world from a distance,^[3] as if\nseparated by a barrier \"behind glass\".^[2] They maintain insight into the\nsubjective nature of their experience, recognizing that it pertains to their\nown perception rather than altering objective reality. This distinction\nbetween subjective experience and objective reality distinguishes\ndepersonalization from delusions, where individuals firmly believe in false\nperceptions as genuine truths. Depersonalization is also distinct from\nderealization, which involves a sense of detachment from the external world\nrather than from oneself.\n\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder refers to chronic depersonalization,\nclassified as a dissociative disorder^[4] in both the DSM-4 and the DSM-5,\nwhich underscores its association with disruptions in consciousness, memory,\nidentity, or perception.^[5] This classification is based on the findings that\ndepersonalization and derealization are prevalent in other dissociative\ndisorders including dissociative identity disorder.^[6]\n\nThough degrees of depersonalization can happen to anyone who is subject to\ntemporary anxiety or stress, chronic depersonalization is more related to\nindividuals who have experienced a severe trauma or prolonged stress/anxiety.\nDepersonalization-derealization is the single most important symptom in the\nspectrum of dissociative disorders, including dissociative identity disorder\nand \"dissociative disorder not otherwise specified\" (DD-NOS). It is also a\nprominent symptom in some other non-dissociative disorders, such as anxiety\ndisorders, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,^[7] schizoid\npersonality disorder, hypothyroidism or endocrine disorders,^[8] schizotypal\npersonality disorder, borderline personality disorder, obsessive\u2013compulsive\ndisorder, migraines, and sleep deprivation; it can also be a symptom of some\ntypes of neurological seizure, and it has been suggested that there could be\ncommon aetiology between depersonalization symptoms and panic disorder, on the\nbasis of their high co-occurrence rates.^[2]\n\nIn social psychology, and in particular self-categorization theory, the term\ndepersonalization has a different meaning and refers to \"the stereotypical\nperception of the self as an example of some defining social category\".^[9]\n\n## Description[edit]\n\nIndividuals who experience depersonalization feel divorced from their own\npersonal self by sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, behaviors,\netc. as not belonging to the same person or identity.^[10] Often a person who\nhas experienced depersonalization claims that things seem unreal or hazy.\nAlso, a recognition of a self breaks down (hence the name). Depersonalization\ncan result in very high anxiety levels, which further increase these\nperceptions.^[11]\n\nDepersonalization is a subjective experience of unreality in one's self, while\nderealization is unreality of the outside world. Although most authors\ncurrently regard depersonalization (personal/self) and derealization\n(reality/surroundings) as independent constructs, many do not want to separate\nderealization from depersonalization.^[12]\n\n## Epidemiology[edit]\n\nDespite the distressing nature of symptoms, estimating the prevalence rates of\ndepersonalization is challenging due to inconsistent definitions and variable\ntimeframes.^[2]\n\nDepersonalization is a symptom of anxiety disorders, such as panic\ndisorder.^[13]^[14] It can also accompany sleep deprivation (often occurring\nwhen experiencing jet lag), migraine, epilepsy (especially temporal lobe\nepilepsy,^[15] complex-partial seizure, both as part of the aura and during\nthe seizure^[16]), obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe stress or trauma,\nanxiety, the use of recreational drugs^[17] \u2014especially cannabis,\nhallucinogens, ketamine, and MDMA, certain types of meditation, deep hypnosis,\nextended mirror or crystal gazing, sensory deprivation, and mild-to-moderate\nhead injury with little or full loss of consciousness (less likely if\nunconscious for more than 30 minutes). Interoceptive exposure is a non-\npharmacological method that can be used to induce depersonalization.^[18]^[8]\n\nIn the general population, transient depersonalization and derealization are\ncommon, having a lifetime prevalence between 26 and 74%.^[2] A random\ncommunity-based survey of 1,000 adults in the US rural south found a 1-year\ndepersonalization prevalence rate at 19%. Standardized diagnostic interviews\nhave reported prevalence rates of 1.2% to 1.7% over one month in UK samples,\nand a rate of 2.4% in a single-point Canadian sample.^[2] In clinical\npopulations, prevalence rates range from 1% to 16%, with varying rates in\nspecific psychiatric disorders such as panic disorder and unipolar\ndepression.^[2] Co-occurrence between depersonalization/derealization and\npanic disorder is common, suggesting a possible common etiology. Co-morbidity\nwith other disorders does not influence symptom severity consistently.^[14]\n\nDepersonalization occurs 2-4 times more in women than in men,^[19] but\ndepersonalization/derealization disorder is diagnosed approximately equally\nacross men and women, with symptoms typically emerging around the age of\n16.^[14]\n\nA similar and overlapping concept called ipseity disturbance (ipse is Latin\nfor \"self\" or \"itself\"^[20]) may be part of the core process of schizophrenia\nspectrum disorders. However, specific to the schizophrenia spectrum seems to\nbe \"a dislocation of first-person perspective such that self and other or self\nand world may seem to be non-distinguishable, or in which the individual self\nor field of consciousness takes on an inordinate significance in relation to\nthe objective or intersubjective world\" (emphasis in original).^[7]\n\nFor the purposes of evaluation and measurement depersonalization can be\nconceived of as a construct and scales are now available to map its dimensions\nin time and space.^[clarification needed]^[21] A study of undergraduate\nstudents found that individuals high on the depersonalization/derealization\nsubscale of the Dissociative Experiences Scale exhibited a more pronounced\ncortisol response in stress. Individuals high on the absorption subscale,\nwhich measures a subject's experiences of concentration to the exclusion of\nawareness of other events, showed weaker cortisol responses.^[22]\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\nDepersonalization can arise from a variety of factors, of both a psychological\nand physiological nature. Common immediate precipitants include instances of\nsevere stress, depressive episodes, panic attacks, and the consumption of\npsychoactive substances such as marijuana and hallucinogens. Additionally,\nthere exists a correlation between frequent depersonalization and childhood\ninterpersonal trauma, particularly cases involving emotional\nmaltreatment.^[14]\n\nA case-control study conducted at a specialized depersonalization clinic\nincluded 164 individuals with chronic depersonalization symptoms, of which 40\nlinked their symptoms to illicit drug use. Phenomenological similarity between\ndrug-induced and non-drug groups was observed, and comparison with matched\ncontrols further supported the lack of distinction. The severity of clinical\ndepersonalization symptoms remains consistent regardless of whether they are\ntriggered by illicit drugs or psychological factors.^[23]\n\n### Pharmacological[edit]\n\nDepersonalization has been described by some as a desirable state,\nparticularly by those that have experienced it under the influence of mood-\naltering recreational drugs. It is an effect of dissociatives and\npsychedelics, as well as a possible side effect of caffeine, alcohol,\namphetamine, cannabis, and antidepressants.^[24]^[25]^[26]^[27]^[28] It is a\nclassic withdrawal symptom from many drugs.^[29]^[30]^[31]^[32]\n\nBenzodiazepine dependence, which can occur with long-term use of\nbenzodiazepines, can induce chronic depersonalization symptomatology and\nperceptual disturbances in some people, even in those who are taking a stable\ndaily dosage, and it can also become a protracted feature of the\nbenzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.^[33]^[34]\n\nLieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman, in his book On Killing, suggests that\nmilitary training artificially creates depersonalization in soldiers,\nsuppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other human\nbeings.^[35]\n\nGraham Reed (1974) claimed that depersonalization occurs in relation to the\nexperience of falling in love.^[36]\n\n### Situational[edit]\n\nExperiences of depersonalization/derealization occur on a continuum, ranging\nfrom momentary episodes in healthy individuals under conditions of stress,\nfatigue, or drug use, to severe and chronic disorders that can persist for\ndecades.^[2] Several studies found that up to 66% of individuals in life-\nthreatening accidents report at least transient depersonalization during or\nimmediately after the accidents.^[16]\n\nSeveral studies, but not all, found age to be a significant factor:\nadolescents and young adults in the normal population reported the highest\nrate. In a study, 46% of college students reported at least one significant\nepisode in the previous year. In another study, 20% of patients with minor\nhead injury experience significant depersonalization and derealization.\n\nIn general infantry and special forces soldiers, measures of depersonalization\nand derealization increased significantly after training that includes\nexperiences of uncontrollable stress, semi-starvation, sleep deprivation, as\nwell as lack of control over hygiene, movement, communications, and social\ninteractions.^[16]\n\n## Psychobiological mechanisms[edit]\n\nSee also: Symptoms of victimization\n\n### Proximate Mechanism[edit]\n\nDepersonalization involves disruptions in the integration of interoceptive and\nexteroceptive signals, particularly in response to acute anxiety or trauma-\nrelated events. Studies spanning from 1992 to 2020 have highlighted\nabnormalities in primary somatosensory cortex processing and insula activity\nas contributing factors to depersonalization experiences.^[5] Additionally,\nabnormal EEG activities, notably in the theta band, suggest potential\nbiomarkers for emotion processing, attention, and working memory, though\nspecific oscillatory signatures associated with depersonalization are yet to\nbe determined.^[5] Reduced brain activities in sensory processing units, along\nwith alterations in visceral signal processing regions, are observed,\nparticularly in the early stages of information processing.^[5]^[14]\n\nFurthermore, vestibular signal processing, crucial for balance and spatial\norientation, is increasingly recognized as a factor contributing to feelings\nof disembodiment during depersonalization experiences. Research suggests that\nabnormal activity in the left hemisphere may play a role, although\nabnormalities in right hemisphere brain activity, responsible for self-\nawareness and emotion processing, may also contribute to depersonalization\nsymptoms. Higher activity in the right parietal lobe's angular gyrus has been\nlinked to more severe depersonalisation, supporting this idea.^[5]\n\nPotential involvement of serotonergic, endogenous opioid, and glutamatergic\nNMDA pathways has also been proposed, alongside alterations in metabolic\nactivity in the sensory association cortex, prefrontal hyperactivation, and\nlimbic inhibition in response to aversive stimuli revealed by brain imaging\nstudies.^[14]\n\nIn addition to this, research suggests that individuals with depersonalization\noften exhibit autonomic blunting, characterized by reduced physiological\nresponses to stressors or emotional stimuli. This blunting may reflect a\ndiminished capacity to engage with the external world or to experience\nemotions fully, contributing to the subjective sense of detachment from\noneself.^[2] Additionally, dysregulation of the HPA axis, which governs the\nbody's stress response system, is frequently observed in individuals who\nexperience depersonalization. This dysregulation can manifest as alterations\nin cortisol levels and responsiveness to stress, potentially exacerbating\nfeelings of detachment and unreality.^[5]\n\n### Ultimate Mechanism[edit]\n\nDepersonalization is a classic response to acute trauma, and may be highly\nprevalent in individuals involved in different traumatic situations including\nmotor vehicle accident, and imprisonment.^[6]\n\nPsychologically depersonalization can, just like dissociation in general, be\nconsidered a type of coping mechanism, used to decrease the intensity of\nunpleasant experience, whether that is something as mild as stress or\nsomething as severe as chronically high anxiety and post-traumatic stress\ndisorder.^[37]\n\nThe decrease in anxiety and psychobiological hyperarousal helps preserving\nadaptive behaviors and resources under threat or danger.^[6]\n\nDepersonalization is an overgeneralized reaction in that it doesn't diminish\njust the unpleasant experience, but more or less all experience \u2013 leading to a\nfeeling of being detached from the world and experiencing it in a more bland\nway. An important distinction must be made between depersonalization as a\nmild, short-term reaction to unpleasant experience and depersonalization as a\nchronic symptom stemming from a severe mental disorder such as PTSD or\ndissociative identity disorder.^[37]\n\nChronic symptoms may represent persistence of depersonalization beyond the\nsituations under threat.^[6]\n\n## Treatment[edit]\n\nCurrently, no universally accepted treatment guidelines have been established\nfor depersonalization. Pharmacotherapy remains a primary avenue of treatment,\nwith medications such as clomipramine, fluoxetine, lamotrigine, and opioid\nantagonists being commonly prescribed. However, it is important to note that\nnone of these medications have demonstrated a potent anti-dissociative effect\nin managing symptoms.^[14]\n\nIn addition to pharmacological interventions, various psychotherapeutic\ntechniques have been employed in attempts to alleviate depersonalization\nsymptoms. Modalities such as trauma-focused therapy and cognitive-behavioral\ntechniques have been utilized, although their efficacy remains uncertain and\nnot firmly established.^[14]\n\nAn attempt at a visual representation of depersonalization\n\nTreatment is dependent on the underlying cause, whether it is organic or\npsychological in origin. If depersonalization is a symptom of neurological\ndisease, then diagnosis and treatment of the specific disease is the first\napproach. Depersonalization can be a cognitive symptom of such diseases as\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS),\nor any other neurological disease affecting the brain.^[citation needed] For\nthose with both depersonalization and migraine, tricyclic antidepressants are\noften prescribed.\n\nIf depersonalization is a symptom of psychological causes such as\ndevelopmental trauma, treatment depends on the diagnosis. In case of\ndissociative identity disorder or DD-NOS as a developmental disorder, in which\nextreme developmental trauma interferes with formation of a single cohesive\nidentity, treatment requires proper psychotherapy, and\u2014in the case of\nadditional (co-morbid) disorders such as eating disorders\u2014a team of\nspecialists treating such an individual. It can also be a symptom of\nborderline personality disorder, which can be treated in the long term with\nproper psychotherapy and psychopharmacology.^[38]\n\nThe treatment of chronic depersonalization is considered in depersonalization\ndisorder.\n\nA 2001 Russian study showed that naloxone, a drug used to reverse the\nintoxicating effects of opioid drugs, can successfully treat depersonalization\ndisorder. According to the study: \"In three of 14 patients, depersonalization\nsymptoms disappeared entirely and seven patients showed a marked improvement.\nThe therapeutic effect of naloxone provides evidence for the role of the\nendogenous opioid system in the pathogenesis of depersonalization.\"^[39] The\nanticonvulsant drug lamotrigine has shown some success in treating symptoms of\ndepersonalization, often in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitor and is the first drug of choice at the depersonalisation research\nunit at King's College London.^[38]^[40]^[41]\n\n## Research Directions[edit]\n\nInterest in DPDR has increased over the past few decades, leading to a large\naccumulation of literature on dissociative disorders. There has been a shift\ntowards the use of research studies, rather than case studies to understand\ndepersonalization.^[2] However, there remains a lack of solid consensus on its\ndefinition and scales used for assessment.^[2]^[14] Salami and colleagues\nargued that studies of electrophysiological depersonalization-derealization\nmarkers are urgently needed, and that future research should use analysis\nmethods that can account for the integration of interoceptive and\nexteroceptive signals.^[5]\n\nThe Depersonalisation Research Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry in London\nconducts research into depersonalization disorder.^[42] Researchers there use\nthe acronym DPAFU (Depersonalisation and Feelings of Unreality) as a shortened\nlabel for the disorder.\n\nIn a 2020 article in the Journal Nature, Vesuna, et al. describe experimental\nfindings which show that layer 5 of the retrosplenial cortex is likely\nresponsible for dissociative states of consciousness in mammals.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Alienation\n  * Brain fog\n  * Catatonic state\n  * Cognition\n  * Derealization\n  * Dissociation (psychology)\n  * Ego death\n  * Falling (sensation)\n  * Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder\n  * Human spirit\n  * Nina Searl\n  * Out-of-body experience\n  * Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims\n  * Post-traumatic stress disorder\n  * Psychedelic experience\n  * Psychological trauma\n  * \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101\n  * Spiritual crisis\n  * Weltschmerz\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Sierra, M.; Berrios, G.
