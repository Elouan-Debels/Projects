Every amateur codebreaker\nis certain that their solution is correct but the evidence debunks their\nclaims. The result is immediate skepticism whenever someone declares that they\nhave unlocked the secrets of a Zodiac cipher. One learns not to get too\nexcited about such claims in order to avoid the inevitable disappointment.\n\nSeveral years ago, I came to rely on David Oranchak for guidance when trying\nto understand the many complex issues surrounding the Zodiac\u2019s ciphers. A\ncomputer programmer, David\u2019s approach to the ciphers was refreshing and his\nanalysis was informative. I often receive emails from people who claim to have\nsolved the ciphers and I always refer them to David for his examination and\nconclusions. He always provides a fair assessment of proposed solutions and\nencourages people to bring new ideas to the discussion. His website\nZodiacKillerCiphers.com has been a valuable resource for anyone seeking\ninformation about the ciphers.\n\nFor these and other reasons, I was not immediately skeptical when I received a\nmessage from David on the morning of Saturday, December 5th, which read: \u201cI\nand two other programmers have a solution for the 340 cipher. No joke. I just\nsent off the solve to the FBI. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s correct.\u201d\n\nI believed that David would not make such claims if he could not back them up\nwith clear evidence, so I was instantly intrigued by the thought that such\nevidence was obviously forthcoming, and I was not disappointed. I soon learned\nthe incredible story behind the solution, a story about the pursuit of a\nseemingly random clue in a mundane search of data.\n\nThe mystery was finally solved with the collaborative efforts of three\nindividuals in different countries across the globe. From his home in\nFlanders, Belgium, computer programmer Jarl Van Eycke has worked online with\nDavid Oranchak in the United States, and Sam Blake in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nDavid Oranchak, Sam Blake, and Jarl Van Eycke.\n\nAs members of Mike Morford\u2019s forum at ZodiacKillerSite.com, the trio shared\ninformation, examined possible decryption methods, and searched for any clue\nwhich could crack the Zodiac\u2019s three unsolved ciphers. Van Eycke created\nAZdecrypt, described by David as \u201ca fast and powerful cipher solver,\u201d and a\nmodified version of this software helped Van Eycke and entrepreneur Louie Helm\nset a world record for deciphering of a bigram substitution of the shortest\ncipher length.\n\nStudying the Zodiac\u2019s 340 cipher, Sam identified and collected information\nabout variations in the cipher text, which ultimately proved to be the key to\ncracking the cipher. \u201cMy main contribution here was actually enumerating many\npossible reading directions through the cipher, in total over 650,000,\u201d Sam\nexplained. \u201cDavid and I both ran these through azdecrypt and zkdecrypto\nrespectively. Interestingly, only azdecrypt was able to find the fragments of\nthe complete solution. It was a needle in a haystack. Even finding the right\nhaystack to search in was lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust one very partial solution, in a sea of 650,000 cipher variations I was\nrunning,\u201d David added. That one partial solution was not completely correct\nbut instead suggested information about the cipher\u2019s construction. \u201cBy luck,\nwe discovered that (Zodiac) split it into three pieces and rearranged the\nmessage in a predictable diagonal pattern in the first two pieces.\u201d When the\nwords ended at the right side of the text block the diagonal message would\ncontinue in the next line at the left side. The Zodiac made an obvious effort\nto thwart attempts to decipher the message by constructing the cipher in this\nway, and the resulting block of text may have been intended to encourage the\nfalse assumption that the 340 cipher was constructed with the same methods\nused to create the killer\u2019s previous cipher, which was a simple message\nreading from left to right as normal text. By rearranging the message into\nthree parts disguised as one block of text, the Zodiac may have believed that\nmost people would never look beyond its appearance to discover the actual\nmethod used to hide the real message.\n\nDavid explained, \u201cCracking it required undoing those arrangements then trying\nto discover his substitution key. That wasn\u2019t enough because he made some\nmistakes in the second piece. Jarl discovered the mistakes and corrected them,\nwhich greatly cleared up the second piece.\u201d After Jarl\u2019s corrections were\nincluded and the proper adjustments were made, the decryption process quickly\nproduced actual results. \u201cWe had a nugget of a solution on Thursday. I took\nFriday off and worked on it all day. My teammates Sam and Jarl also worked on\nit a lot. By (Saturday) morning, Jarl had worked out the remaining bit and it\nwas finally complete enough to send off to the FBI. They responded almost\nimmediately.\u201d David said that he had received three telephone calls from the\nBureau on Saturday morning. \u201cWhen I talked to the FBI, they only needed to\nmake one change to the solution.\u201d David and his team had deciphered a section\nof six letters to read, \u201csoo her.\u201d \u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out the part that says,\n\u2018soo her,\u2019 [but] their cryptanalyst called me and she said she thinks it\u2019s\nsupposed to say, \u2018sooner\u2019\u201d instead.\n\nThe solution was also examined by Dan Olson, Cryptanalyst Forensic Examiner\nfor the FBI\u2019s Racketeering Records Analysis Unit in Washington, D.C. Oranchak\nsaid, \u201cThey are running the solution up the chain now. Dan says it looks\nsolid. I was happy to hear Dan Olson tell me personally that he thinks it\u2019s\nsolid.\u201d\n\nDuring his appearance in the 2009 History Channel series MysteryQuest, Dan\nOlson shared his theory that the text block of the Z340 may have been intended\nto be separated into two parts in order to be deciphered. The cipher was\nactually separated into three parts and the message was found in the first two\nparts.\n\nThe FBI experts were so confident that the solution was valid that the bureau\nwould essentially close the file on the 340 cipher. \u201cFBI is amending their\noriginal report to include our solution as the actual solution,\u201d David\nreported, \u201cThen they\u2019ll submit it back to the San Francisco Police Department\n(the original requestor of assistance with the cipher in 1969).\u201d\n\nThe solution revealed a message which seemed consistent with the Zodiac\u2019s\npersona and character as displayed in his previous communications, including\nthe deciphered text of the 408 symbol cipher. In that message, the killer\nwrote that he was killing people in order to collect slaves to serve him\nduring his afterlife in \u201cparadice.\u201d The Zodiac also included the same\nmisspelling in text using the words \u201cparadice\u201d and \u201cslaves\u201d to form a cross.\nIn the solution to the 340, the writer returned to this theme and declared\nthat he was not afraid of death.\n\nI HOPE YOU ARE HAVING LOTS OF FUN IN TRYING TO CATCH ME THAT WASN\u2019T ME ON THE\nTV SHOW WHICH BRINGS UP A POINT ABOUT ME I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE GAS CHAMBER\nBECAUSE IT WILL SEND ME TO PARADICE ALL THE SOONER BECAUSE I NOW HAVE ENOUGH\nSLAVES TO WORK FOR ME WHERE EVERYONE ELSE HAS NOTHING WHEN THEY REACH PARADICE\nSO THEY ARE AFRAID OF DEATH I AM NOT AFRAID BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY NEW LIFE\nWILL BE AN EASY ONE IN PARADICE DEATH\n\nDavid noted that, unlike other proposed solutions, this new solution revealed\na clear and discernible message. \u201c(We) didn\u2019t have to do too many steps, and\nyet a coherent message pops out.\u201d\n\nThe writer apparently referred to the Bay Area television talk show, The Jim\nDunbar Show, and an episode featuring famous attorney Melvin Belli. On October\n22, 1969, someone called the Oakland police station and claimed to the Zodiac.\nThe caller demanded that Belli, or Boston attorney F. Lee Bailey, appear on\nthe show with host Jim Dunbar.\n\nTV host Jim Dunbar and attorney Melvin Belli talk with the Zodiac impostor\n\u201cSam.\u201d\n\nDuring the broadcast, a man called several times but kept hanging up in an\neffort to prevent police from tracing the calls to his location. The caller\nagreed to be referred to as \u201cSam,\u201d and he complained that headaches had driven\nhim to murderous impulses. \u201cSam\u201d expressed his fears of being \u201churt,\u201d and\nBelli promised to help the caller avoid \u201cthe gas chamber.\u201d After the\nbroadcast, a recording of the caller\u2019s voice was played for the three people\nwho had spoken to the Zodiac. Surviving victim Bryan Hartnell and police\ndispatchers David Slaight and Nancy Slover all concluded that \u201cSam\u201d was not\nthe Zodiac. Police reports, FBI files and other accounts indicated that \u201cSam\u201d\nlater called Melvin Belli\u2019s home several times and that police were finally\nable to trace those calls to a patient in a mental institution. Investigators\nconcluded that the man was not the Zodiac, but the incident became an often\nmisunderstood chapter of the story and some people continued to believe that\n\u201cSam\u201d was actually the killer.\n\nThe writer of the cipher text stated, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me on the the TV show.\u201d The\nincident with Sam occurred on October 22, 1969, and the cipher was sent two\nand a half weeks later in November. On December 20, 1969, the Zodiac sent a\nletter to Belli\u2019s home in an envelope which also contained a piece of a\nvictim\u2019s bloodstained shirt to confirm the writer\u2019s identity as the real\nkiller. The tone and text of the letter\u2019s message seemed somewhat insincere,\nand the message could be interpreted as mockery of Sam\u2019s imposter version of\nthe \u201cZodiac\u201d character. [To learn more, read the ZodiacKillerFacts article\nMELVIN & SAM: The Strange Saga of a Zodiac Impostor or listen to the audio\nversion of the article ZODIAC: A TO Z \u2013 Ep# 10 \u2013 Melvin & Sam: The Strange\nSaga of a Zodiac Impostor.]\n\nDavid said that, at first, he did not expect much to come from the possible\ndecipher method, but everything changed when a message materialized before his\neyes. \u201cWhen \u2018that wasn\u2019t me on the TV show\u2019 popped out during the solve, I\njumped out of my chair and said, \u2018Holy ****!\u2019 since that show happened like a\nfew weeks before the cipher was received. That\u2019s when I knew it was on the\nright track.\u201d\n\nAfter more than fifty years, the mystery of the 340 cipher had finally been\nsolved, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of three men working together from\ndifferent parts of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. We were really lucky to come\nacross this solution,\u201d David said. \u201cIt was only a handful of words to start\nwith. Could have very easily ignored them and moved on. But \u2018gas chamber\u2019\nreally stood out.\u201d\n\nWhen David explained to me how the cipher was solved, I was reminded of his\nprevious statements in interviews for my podcast series about possible\ndecryption methods and different theories about the construction of the\nciphers. I said to him, \u201cThis really bolsters so many things you said in your\ninterviews.\u201d David replied, \u201cYeah, the statistics in the cipher text really\ndid turn out to reflect the way it was constructed.\u201d\n\nIn November, 2019, David and I were discussing the Zodiac\u2019s 340 cipher for the\npodcast ZODIAC: A TO Z \u2013 Ep. #8 \u2013 340: The Mystery. Approximately 15 minutes\ninto the show, David essentially predicted how the Z340 was actually\nconstructed when he described possible encryption techniques. \u201cRoute\ntranspositions are things like, read the message from left to right and then\nright to left and then left to right, kind of like a snake pattern, back and\nforth, a zigzag pattern. That\u2019s an example of a route transposition. Or like,\na diagonal, reading off the message diagonally. So in those situations, you\u2019d\nend up with a plain text that doesn\u2019t look like it makes any sense. And then\nthe last step there would be to encrypt it using the same kind of substitution\nused in the first cipher. So the symbols are assigned to each of the letters.\u201d\n\nFor years, I stated my belief that the Zodiac may have been somewhat\ndisappointed that his first cipher was solved so quickly and, therefore, he\nmay have intended that the next cipher was more difficult to solve. Some\npeople had speculated that amateur codebreakers Donald and Betty Harden were\nable to solve the original 408 cipher so quickly because the Zodiac was little\nmore than an amateur who possessed only a basic understanding of cryptography.\nI asked David if this new cipher solution cast doubt on those theories about\nthe Zodiac\u2019s knowledge of cryptography. \u201cYes, either he knew codes, or had a\ngood intuition about how to make them.\u201d David also agreed with my theory. \u201cHe\ndefinitely reacted to the Hardens solution and made it much harder.\u201d\n\nDavid thanked Mike Morford, owner of ZodiacKillerSite.com, and stated that\n\u201cthe site played a crucial role\u201d in the events leading up to the solution. \u201cIt\ngave us a forum to collaborate. Me and the other nerds used it extensively...\nThis could have only happened with the two other guys I worked with. Sam\n(Blake) sent me the 650,000 variations. One of them turned out to be extremely\nclose to the right answer. And Jarl built the codebreaking software, and also\nhelped fix up the solution. No way I could have done any of this without\nthem.\u201d Jarl Van Eycke said, \u201cIt is unbelievable how everything came together\nso perfectly between the three of us. And I am so happy to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDavid was concerned that media coverage about the solution could be confusing.\n\u201cIt may be hard to convey to the general public because it does require\nadditional steps\u2014 diagonal reading, splitting into three seconds, fixing the\nmistakes, and rearranging letters in the last two lines.\u201d He has produced a\nnew episode of his YouTube video series \u201cLet\u2019s Crack Zodiac\u201d with more details\nabout the new solution and the methods used to decipher the message.\n\nWhile the new solution did not provide any apparent clues to the killer\u2019s\nidentity, the deciphered message revealed another glimpse into the mind of the\nZodiac. Whether or not he actually believed that his dead victims would serve\nas his slaves in his afterlife, the repeated theme was somehow important to\nthe killer. In 1969, the Zodiac claimed that he was killing victims to become\nhis slaves, and, more than half a century later, he remains significant\nbecause those victims were sacrificed to achieve his infamy. As his story\ncontinues to unfold in the pages of the history books, we are still haunted by\nthe ghost of the Zodiac.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFBI Statement: The FBI has a team of cryptanalysis experts that decipher coded\nmessages, symbols, and records from criminals known as the Cryptanalysis and\nRacketeering Records Unit. CRRU regularly works with the cryptologic research\ncommunity to solve ciphers. On December 5, 2020, the FBI received the solution\nto a cipher popularly known as Z340 from a cryptologic researcher and\nindependently verified the decryption. Cipher Z340 is one of four ciphers\nattributed to the Zodiac Killer. This cipher was first submitted to the FBI\nLaboratory on November 13, 1969, but not successfully decrypted. Over the past\n51 years CRRU has reviewed numerous proposed solutions from the public\u2013none of\nwhich had merit. The cipher was recently solved by a team of three private\ncitizens. The Zodiac Killer case remains an ongoing investigation for the FBI\nSan Francisco division and our local law enforcement partners. The Zodiac\nKiller terrorized multiple communities across Northern California and even\nthough decades have gone by, we continue to seek justice for the victims of\nthese brutal crimes. Due to the ongoing nature of the investigation, and out\nof respect for the victims and their families, we will not be providing\nfurther comment at this time.\n\n* * *\n\nMichael Butterfield is a writer who has conducted extensive research on the\nZodiac case since the 1990s.
