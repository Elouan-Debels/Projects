Leonard says he can do this because last\nOctober the company changed its terms of service to grant it \u201cunrestricted\nrights\u201d to sell any uploaded content for the purpose of AI training.\n\n\u201cWe need to pay our bills, and this could give us the ability to continue to\nsupport free accounts,\u201d Leonard tells Reuters.\n\nLeonard says he has discussed rates of 5 cents to $1 per photo and over $1 per\nvideo with prices varying depending on the buyer and the types of imagery they\nare seeking. He declined to reveal the identity of the potential buyers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to companies that have said, \u2018we need way more,'\u201d Leonard says.\nOne buyer wanted over a billion videos, more than Photobucket has. \u201cYou\nscratch your head and say, where do you get that?\u201d\n\nThe news that Photobucket is considering selling users\u2019 content to generative\nAI comes amid reports that large tech companies like OpenAI and Google are\nrunning out of data to harvest for AI products.\n\nReuters compares the current market to a \u201cgold rush\u201d as legal certainty\nsurrounds what some companies call \u201cpublicly available\u201d data such as those\nprovided by the non-profit repository Common Crawl. Meta, Google, Amazon, and\nApple all have agreements with Shutterstock to use its vast archive with those\ndeals reported in the $25 million to $50 million range.\n\n## But is it Even Legal?\n\nDaniela Braga, CEO of Defined.ai, a company that licenses data to big tech\nfirms, tells Reuters that she avoids acquiring content from platforms such as\nPhotobucket because the licensing rights are murky.\n\n\u201cI would find it very risky,\u201d Braga says. \u201cIf there\u2019s some AI that generates\nsomething that resembles a picture of someone who never approved that, that\u2019s\na problem.\u201d\n\nIndustry, News, Technology\n\nbusiness, commerciallicensing, copyright, licensing, photobucket,\nphotolicensing, trainingdata\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPhotobucket Just Broke Billions of Photos Across the Web\n\nAll The Photo Companies That Have Struck Licensing Deals With AI Firms\n\nPhotobucket Unveils First Major Redesign in 10 Years in Order to Stay Hip\n\nTwitter to Launch Photo Sharing Feature\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nScientists Photograph 50 Never-Before-Seen Deep Sea Species\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\nMKBHD Calls Humane AI Pin the \u2018Worst Product\u2019 He\u2019s Ever Reviewed\n\n8 hours ago\n\nTourist Falls 170 Feet Off a Cliff to Her Death While Taking Selfie\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\nSmallRig Debuts New Products and Fund to Support Creators\n\nApr 14, 2024\n\nPhotographer Helps Grizzly Bear Narrowly Escape Oncoming Train\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
