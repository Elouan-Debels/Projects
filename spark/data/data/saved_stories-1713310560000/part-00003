Thirteen years, three books, and\ndozens of papers into his profession, Barry Farber, a professor at Columbia\nTeachers College and trained psychotherapist, realized he was feeling this\nway. Unfortunately, he was well acquainted with the symptoms. He was a burnout\nresearcher himself.\n\nBeing burned out on burnout\u2014now that was rich. Madame Curie died of radiation\npoisoning; Joseph Mitchell famously developed a 32-year-long case of writer\u2019s\nblock after writing a two-part New Yorker series about a blocked writer; now\nFarber was suffering the same self-referential fate. He jokes about it today\n(who wouldn\u2019t?) but hardly felt sanguine as it was happening (who would?).\nColleagues tried to persuade him to stick it out. \u201cBut for the most part, I\u2019ve\nresisted coming back,\u201d says Farber. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to find that same\nsense of satisfaction.\u201d\n\nFarber had burned out once before. Back in the late sixties and early\nseventies, he taught public school in East Harlem. He\u2019d wanted to help people,\ndo the world some good. Yet for four years he\u2019d struggled to stop his students\nfrom fighting with one another, and in spite of his best efforts he couldn\u2019t\neven teach all of them to read. His classroom became a perverse experiment in\nphysics, with energy never conserved (input always exceeded output), and he, a\nteacher in perpetual motion, always craving rest. Eventually, he began to pull\naway from his students\u2014depersonalization, as the literature now calls\nit\u2014justifying his seeming insensitivity by telling himself he wasn\u2019t making a\ndifference anyway. It was only when Farber went to graduate school at Yale\nthat he learned that this syndrome had a name: Burnout. \u201cThe concept offered a\nperfect understanding of what teachers were feeling,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t\nin fact that they were racist and mercenary and noncaring but that their level\nof caring couldn\u2019t be sustained in the absence of results.\u201d\n\nFarber was so captivated by the notion of burnout he made it the subject of\nhis dissertation. And he stayed with it for another thirteen years. Until the\nday he couldn\u2019t anymore. He still remembers the breaking point. He\u2019d just\ncompleted a book about burnout among teachers, a subject he\u2019d once considered\nexceptionally urgent. \u201cYet even as I was writing,\u201d he says, \u201cI had this sense\nthat I really wanted to finish it so that I could go on to something else. I\nfelt somewhat bored, and somewhat depleted. I\u2019d said all I wanted to say.\u201d He\nponders this point. \u201cI guess,\u201d he says, \u201cI lost the sense that it was\nimportant.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t quite say that I\u2019ve ever had the full-on Farber experience. But I\u2019ve\ncertainly had mini-versions of it. Whenever I\u2019ve finished a big project, for\ninstance, or whenever I\u2019ve found myself listening to the 10 p.m. whir of the\nvacuum cleaners in our office start up for the tenth night in a row, there\u2019s\nno one I identify with more than the Bill Murray character in Rushmore,\nparticularly as he\u2019s blankly tossing golf balls from a wire basket into his\nswimming pool. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love my work. But hold a stethoscope to\nmy brain, eavesdrop on my innermost thoughts, and at those moments, all you\u2019ll\nhear is the sound of a whistling conch shell.\n\nBurnout is not its own category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders. It\u2019s not something that can be treated pharmacologically; it\nis not considered the same thing as depression or a midlife crisis, though\nsometimes they coincide. The term was first coined by a psychotherapist named\nHerbert Freudenberger, who himself probably took it from Graham Greene\u2019s novel\nA Burnt-Out Case. (\u201cI haven\u2019t enough feeling left for human beings,\u201d the\nbook\u2019s numb protagonist, Querry, wrote in his journal, \u201cto do anything for\nthem out of pity.\u201d) While working at a free clinic for drug addicts in Haight-\nAshbury, Freudenberger noticed that the volunteers, when discouraged, would\noften push harder and harder at their jobs, only to feel as if they were\nachieving less and less. The result, in 1974, was the book Burnout: The High\nCost of High Achievement. Others soon followed. A subspecialty of psychology\nwas born.\n\nBack in the seventies, when people marched into the world with convictions\nabout changing it, burnout was considered a noble affliction. It meant that\nyou\u2019d depleted yourself while helping others. Almost all the research that\u2019d\nbeen done on the subject, and there\u2019d been quite a lot, was on the people in\nthe \u201ccaring professions\u201d\u2014nurses, public-school teachers, legal-aid workers,\nsocial workers, clergy. Because many of these people were idealists, and\nbecause they worked with the hardest-luck cases, they were highly susceptible\nto disillusionment. Those who burned out were not only physically and mentally\nexhausted; they were cynical, detached, convinced their efforts were\nworthless. They held themselves in contempt. Worse, they held their clients in\ncontempt. They began to loathe the same people they originally sought to help.\nIn her seminal book Burnout: The Cost of Caring, Christina Maslach, perhaps\nthe best-known burnout researcher working in the United States today,\ncollected plenty of vivid, unvarnished testimony. As one Florida social worker\ntold her, \u201cI recently received a call at night, and while I was getting\ndressed, I was screaming and cursing these motherfuckers for calling me with\ntheir goddamned problems.\u201d\n\nIllustration by Patrick Thomas\n\nToday, in New York City, everyone knows that the ones \u201cscreaming and cursing\nthese motherfuckers for calling me with their goddamned problems\u201d are as\nlikely to be hedge-fund managers as any species of do-gooders. Burnout is the\nillness of just about any averagely driven, obsessive New York professional.\nBankers, high-tech workers, advertisers, management consultants, lawyers\nworking in their mustard-lit honeycombed Hades\u2014all of them are as likely to\ncomplain about burnout as schoolteachers and social workers. In 21st-century\nNew York, the 60-hour week is considered normal. In some professions, it\u2019s a\nstatus symbol. But burnout, for the most part, is considered a sign of\nweakness, a career killer.\n\n\u201cMy clients are perfectionists,\u201d says Alden Cass, a therapist to both\ncorporate attorneys and men on Wall Street. He\u2019s young, about the age of a\nhungry broker, and he looks like the men he treats\u2014strong features, dark\nteased hair, Turnbull & Asser striped shirt, nice watch. \u201cThey have very rigid\nideals in terms of win-lose,\u201d he continues. \u201cTheir expectations of success are\nthrough the roof, and when their reality doesn\u2019t match up with their\nexpectations, it leads to burnout\u2014they leave no room for error or failure at\nall in their formula.\u201d\n\nCass is the opposite of a rumpled therapist or academic who might have studied\nburnout in the seventies. He\u2019s today\u2019s version, a $350-an-hour executive\ncoach, someone who accommodates busy schedules by meeting over lunch or at\nbaseball games and speaks in the idiom of Wall Street. His clients, too, are\nthe inside-out version of the burned-out altruists people were examining in\nthe seventies: Unblushingly ambitious, rich, focused as Marines. Yet ask Cass\nwhy his clients are burning out, and his answer isn\u2019t any different for a\nbanker than it would be for a public-school teacher; there\u2019s a gulf between\nwhat they expected from their jobs and what they got. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d he\nsays, \u201chow many people come into my office and ask, \u2018How come I have this\nmoney and I can\u2019t find happiness?\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo what does he tell them? \u201cThat happiness equals reality divided by\nexpectations.\u201d\n\nI look around Cass\u2019s office and realize it\u2019s the perfect hybrid of a shrink\u2019s\nsuite and a bond trader\u2019s bachelor pad: a seascape of black leather, that\nmysterious favorite fabric of rich young men, on the one hand; a menagerie of\ncurios, totems, and exotica on the other. (Though maybe there\u2019s a slight bias\ntoward the bachelor pad\u2014further inspection reveals a Wall Street movie poster\nin the corner, a bronze bull on the coffee table, and a squishy stress-ball he\nencourages his stymied clients to throw.)\n\nOur instinct, of course, is not to feel much pity for the poor bond trader. An\nepidemic of malaise among bankers and lawyers is far more likely to inspire\njokes\u2014Wouldn\u2019t it be nicer if it were terminal?\u2014than concern and rafts of\npsychological studies. (And the few studies out there are funny, if\ninadvertently. In a special \u201cburnout\u201d issue of the Journal of Clinical\nPsychology six years ago, the essay on lawyers was most notable for the\n\u201cSelect References and Recommended Reading\u201d that followed\u2014four of eight were\nabout masochism.) But that doesn\u2019t make the phenomenon any less real. In fact,\nconsider lawyers for a moment: According to the New York Bar Association,\nturnover rates among mid-level associates in this city\u2019s law firms is 36\npercent. The whole system is predicated on burnout. Why even bother treating\nassociates well?\n\nIt is possible something is the matter here. Just as there were deep flaws in\nthe work ecosystems of the caring professions, noticed by researchers in the\nseventies, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s something wrong with our professional\nenvironments\u2014and perhaps, more broadly speaking, our culture of work. Isn\u2019t\nthis worthy of examination? Work, after all, is a form of religion in a\nsecular world. Burning out in it amounts to a crisis of faith.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, the caring professions were where the issue was,\u201d says\nMaslach. \u201cBut frankly, it\u2019s also where we could do the research. Not all\nprofessions say, \u2018Sure, come on in and poke around and see what we\u2019re doing\nand who we are.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut today, says Maslach, corporate settings are cautiously, slowly, cracking\ntheir doors, letting people like her in, because they recognize that\nsomething\u2019s gone awry. \u201cLike in Silicon Valley,\u201d she says. \u201cIt used to be the\ncase that people would say, \u2018You\u2019re burned out? You don\u2019t like the job? So\nquit. I don\u2019t run a country club,\u2019 \u201d says Maslach. \u201cBut what was happening was\nthe best and the brightest wanted to opt out. They started saying, \u2018I can\u2019t do\nthis; this is not a life.\u2019 They\u2019d go to the Midwest and start a pet-food\nstore.\u201d Maslach adds that when she did interviews at nasa, she noticed similar\nproblems there. \u201cSo suddenly, these places were saying, \u2018Whoa, what do we need\nto do to get these people?\u2019 Getting the most out of people didn\u2019t actually\nmean getting the best. That\u2019s when there was a new wave of interest in\nburnout.\u201d\n\nIllustration by Patrick Thomas\n\nShe pauses for a second, searching for the right metaphor. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like\nergonomics,\u201d she finally says. \u201cIt used to be, \u2018You sit for work? Here\u2019s a\nchair.\u2019 But now we design furniture to fit and support the body. And we\u2019re\ndoing the same here. The environments themselves have to say, \u2018We want people\nto thrive and grow.\u2019 There was a shift, finally, in how people understood the\nquestion.\u201d\n\nLike the science of all emotion, attempts to quantify, analyze, and define\nburnout have a slightly stilted, unnatural quality. It\u2019s a problem that\u2019s both\nphysical and existential, an untidy agglomeration of external symptoms and\nprivate frustrations\u2014how could such stuff be plotted on a graph? (I keep\nthinking of Bill Murray and those golf balls\u2014or Bill Murray and his Suntory\nwhiskeys in Lost in Translation, for that matter. Does a culture even need a\ndefinition of burnout when it has Bill Murray?) But researchers have\nnevertheless made valiant efforts to try. In 1981, Maslach, now vice-provost\nat the University of California, Berkeley, famously co-developed a detailed\nsurvey, known as the Maslach Burnout Inventory, to measure the syndrome. Her\ntheory is that any one of the following six problems can fry us to a crisp:\nworking too much; working in an unjust environment; working with little social\nsupport; working with little agency or control; working in the service of\nvalues we loathe; working for insufficient reward (whether the currency is\nmoney, prestige, or positive feedback). \u201cI once talked to a pediatric\ndentist,\u201d she says, \u201cand he said, \u2018A good day is when there are no screamers.\u2019\nAnd I\u2019m sure half the people he was talking about were the parents.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most surprising aspect of Maslach\u2019s research is that burnout isn\u2019t\nnecessarily a result of overwork. It can be, certainly. Michael Leiter, a\nlovely Canadian fellow and frequent collaborator of Maslach\u2019s, has elegantly\ncalled burnout a \u201ccrisis in self-efficacy,\u201d which to me suggests that head-\nbanging feeling of struggling mightily for too little or (worse) nothing in\nreturn. Ayala Pines, a researcher in Israel who\u2019s looked at burnout in all\nsorts of inspired contexts (including marriage), rather heartbreakingly sums\nup the problem as \u201cthe failure of the existential quest\u201d\u2014that moment when we\nwake up one morning and realize that what we\u2019re doing has appallingly little\nvalue. She studied the insurance business, for example, a profession often\nassociated with the ultimate cubicle tedium. Yet she noticed something very\ninteresting. \u201cThe ones who had some traumatic experience related to insurance\nwhen they were children\u2014their house burned down or whatever\u2014they can work for\na long time without burning out,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause they came to the\nprofession with a calling. They feel their work is significant.\u201d\n\nAnd Farber often calls burnout \u201cthe gap between expectation and reward,\u201d which\nmay have the most relevance to New Yorkers. This has always been a city of\ninflated expectations. People with more modest aims for themselves seem less\nprone to disillusionment.\n\nLongitudinal, comprehensive data on burnout is hard to come by, in part\nbecause the United States is not especially renowned for its sensitivity to\nworkers. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics, an admirable organization with lots\nof dedicated economists, does not track worker satisfaction, for example.) One\nof the few countries that does keep comprehensive data on burnout is, not\nsurprisingly, the Netherlands, where the government is sensitive to the\nworkplace needs of its citizenry. Even there, longitudinal surveys show that\nroughly 10 percent of the workforce is burned out at any given time, with\nhigh-school teachers and primary-care health personnel ranking highest. (I\nasked Wilmar Schaufeli, perhaps the most prominent researcher of burnout in\nthe Netherlands today, whether he had any data on bankers. \u201cIn Holland,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cthese groups are not big enough to study. But I do know there have been\nsome reports in the press about stockbrokers who use cocaine and other illicit\ndrugs just to keep up. But this is another story.\u201d) Still, enough research has\nbeen done in the United States and elsewhere to reveal interesting patterns of\nburnout. Though loath to say that any one profession burns us out more than\nothers\u2014to her, it\u2019s more a question of how well we fit in our jobs\u2014Maslach\nfound in her early work that the critical burnout period for most social-\nservice agencies was between one and five years on the job. (Interestingly,\nStuart Marques, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers, notes that\n45 percent of New York City public-school teachers have left their jobs by\nyear five.) Of all her studies both in Israel and abroad, Pines found that the\nmost-burned-out people were nurses working in children\u2019s burn units\u2014\u201cIt was\ntoo painful\u201d\u2014and the least were serial entrepreneurs, those metabolic wonders\ncreating companies as if they were baking cakes.\n\nIn 2001, the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan used the\nMaslach inventory to conduct a comprehensive study of burnout among its\ngraduates from various residencies. It showed a striking rate of high\nemotional exhaustion among practicing surgeons (32 percent) and a rather low\nrate of depersonalization (13 percent), all of which seemed to utterly belie\nthe notion that surgeons were unfeeling technocrats. The conclusion also said\nthat there was no correlation between exhaustion and caseload. \u201cIt has much\nmore to do with frustrations in the changes in medicine,\u201d says Lazar J.\nGreenfield, one of the study\u2019s co-investigators and the chairman emeritus of\nMichigan\u2019s Department of Surgery. \u201cThe liability risk is higher, the patients\nare more demanding, reimbursements have progressively declined.\u201d\n\nTo me, the most beguiling data to emerge from burnout research are the\nprofiles of the people who experience it most acutely. In her early work, for\ninstance, Maslach found that younger people burn out more often than older\npeople, a finding that turns up again and again both here and abroad. (In\nfact, that study from the University of Michigan explicitly said that younger\nsurgeons burn out more quickly than older ones.) This conclusion may seem\ncounterintuitive, because we associate burning out somehow with midlife\ndisillusionment. But not if we think of burnout as the gap between\nexpectations and rewards. Older workers, as it turns out, have more\nperspective and more experience; it\u2019s the young idealists who go flying into a\nprofession, plumped full of high hopes, and run full-speed into a wall.\nMaslach also found that married people burn out less often than single people,\nas long as their marriages are good, because they don\u2019t depend as much on\ntheir jobs for fulfillment. And childless people, though unburdened by the\ndaily strains of parenting, tend to burn out far more than people with kids.\n(This, too, has been found across cultures; in the Netherlands, a recent\nsurvey by the Bureau of Statistics showed that twice as many working women\nwithout children showed symptoms of burnout as did working women with underage\nchildren.) It\u2019s much easier to disproportionately invest emotional and\nphysical capital in the office if you have nowhere else to put it. And the\noffice seldom loves you back.\n\n\u201cI did a study in the south of Israel of \u2018sandwich generation\u2019 couples\u2014people\nwho have young children and elderly parents,\u201d says Ayala Pines, the Israeli\nresearcher. \u201cThis is very stressful, but what I found is that these people\nwere not that burned out at all, because their families also provided\nemotional support.\u201d\n\nPines\u2019s work has also shown that people in fiercely individualist societies\nare more prone to burn out. \u201cI once did a study comparing Mexican college\nprofessors to American college professors,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Mexican burnout\nrate was lower. To them, the kind of lifestyle you describe in New York is\ninsane. At noon, you come home, eat, and see your family. It isn\u2019t even a\nquestion.\u201d In Israel, she adds, she consistently found lower levels of burnout\nthan in her studies in the United States, even though the lives of its\ncitizens are tangibly threatened in a way that most Americans\u2019 are not. \u201cAnd\none explanation I have,\u201d she says, \u201cis that it\u2019s because of the existential\nthreats to our daily lives. You feel your own life is more significant.\u201d\n\nOf course, Maslach also found that there are certain types\u2014depressives, people\nwith problems with anger or anxiety\u2014who are more prone to burn out. And if\nyou\u2019re inclined to look at the world through the prism of psychoanalysis,\nyou\u2019ll realize there are an almost infinite number of reasons why people\nchoose the wrong kinds of jobs for themselves. Pines says it best. \u201cI think\none of the reasons people burn out is because they take jobs that they hope,\nconsciously or unconsciously, will help them overcome unresolved childhood\nissues,\u201d she says. \u201cBut instead of healing the childhood wound, work reopens\nit.\u201d\n\nWoo hoo. Re: An appendix to the principles of Jewish Buddhism. Saying hi. Re:\nHey pal. Burnout. WHEN are we eating? Open Enrollment Info. Quick q.\nArrrrrrrrrrgh.\n\nYou are looking at nine e-mail subject lines I received in a one-hour period\nlast week. It was then that I realized I answer an e-mail once every 6.66\nminutes. The very thought of committing this fact to paper has kept me\ncrippled for several seconds. It doesn\u2019t seem like the sort of thing my boss\nshould know.\n\nOne has to wonder whether the developments of a high-speed world haven\u2019t made\nburnout worse. First, the obvious: With the advent of e-mail, cell phones,\nlaptops, BlackBerrys (or \u201cCrackBerrys\u201d\u2014the argot here seems extremely apt),\nand other bits of high-speed doodadry, it has become virtually impossible, in\nsenses both literal and metaphorical, to unplug from our jobs. As Schaufeli,\nthe Dutch researcher, notes, one of the strongest predictors of burnout isn\u2019t\njust work overload but \u201cwork-home interference\u201d\u2014a sociologist\u2019s way of saying\nwe\u2019re receiving phone calls from Tokyo during dinner and replying to clients\non our BlackBerrys while making our children brush their teeth.\n\nBut the problems wrought by technological advancement go far beyond trespasses\ninto our homes. They\u2019ve done something to how we perceive time\u2014and, by\nextension, work and leisure\u2014itself. There\u2019s a way New Yorkers often describe\nthis, actually. They say they\u2019re busy. It\u2019s hard to find New Yorkers who don\u2019t\nbelieve themselves to be really, really busy, whether they have six kids or\nnone, and whether they\u2019re trading bonds or driving cabs. \u201cBusyness\u201d\u2014a\nhomophone of business, which cannot be an accident\u2014has become the defining\nsensation of city life. If busy meant \u201cfulfilled,\u201d or \u201cengaged,\u201d that\u2019d be one\nthing, but it seems, in most cases, to mean \u201coverloaded\u201d or \u201cfrazzled.\u201d In\nFaster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, James Gleick points out\nthat doctors and sociologists even have a name for this harried sensation:\n\u201churry sickness.\u201d\n\nThe great paradox of efficiency is that the more we speed up, the more acute\nour frustrations when we\u2019re forced to slow down. Is it not possible that these\nambient frustrations function as chronic stressors, and\u2014in some subtle but\ncrucial way\u2014contribute to feeling worn out? Americans, Gleick writes, spend an\nestimated 3 billion minutes a year waiting on hold with the software industry;\nthey race to airports only to wait for hours; they start to jitter inside\nelevators if the doors take more than four seconds to close. (Elevator\nengineers even have a term for how long it takes\u2014door dwell\u2014before people\nstart jamming their fingers on the door close button, which is usually a\nplacebo, a function already disabled by litigation-conscious building\nmanagers.)\n\n\u201cGridlocked and tarmacked are metonyms of our era,\u201d Gleick writes. \u201cTo be\ngridlocked or tarmacked is to be stuck in place, our fastest engines idling\nall around us, as time passes and blood pressures rise.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s not quite the same thing, I often feel gridlocked when answering\nmy e-mail. My friends would probably be startled to learn this, because my\ne-mails ricochet back within seconds, as if attached to a rubber band. But\nit\u2019s hard to escape the sensation, as I answer each and every one, that I\u2019m\nbeing stopped at a tollbooth.\n\nIf one of the surest recipes for burnout, as Michael Leiter has said, is the\nsensation of inefficiency\u2014particularly if we\u2019re still expending energy and\nseeing little in return\u2014then there may be something about the modern office\nthat conspires to burn us out. In 2005, a psychiatrist at King\u2019s College\nLondon did a study in which one group was asked to take an IQ test while doing\nnothing, and a second group to take an IQ test while distracted by e-mails and\nringing telephones. The uninterrupted group did better by an average of ten\npoints, which wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. What was a surprise is that the\ne-mailers also did worse, by an average of six points, than a group in a\nsimilar study that had been tested while stoned.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Stoned. Those people were literally burned out, and they did\nbetter.\n\n\u201cThere is something about interruption that makes people especially\nunproductive,\u201d says Suzanne Bianchi, a sociology professor at the University\nof Maryland and co-author of the new book Changing Rhythms of American Family\nLife. \u201cAnd technology interrupts us all the time\u2014e-mails, cell phones. It\nfeeds into our sense of control\u201d\u2014another key factor in burning out, feeling a\nlack of control\u2014\u201cand highly educated workers all will talk as if they\u2019re\nterribly overworked, how they feel as if there\u2019s never enough time. Partly,\nwe\u2019re supposed to say it, but I think people also genuinely feel that way,\neven though they have the time. That\u2019s what\u2019s intrigued us. The subjective and\nthe objective don\u2019t line up.\u201d\n\nIndeed, that\u2019s her colleagues\u2019 most startling finding of all. Most Americans\nbelieve they work more today than they did 35 years ago. Yet according to the\nAmerican Time Use Survey, an ambitious project that for 41 years has been\nasking thousands of participants to keep detailed time diaries, Americans now\nhave five more hours of leisure per week (38) than they did in 1965.\nCertainly, there are academics who reject these numbers\u2014in The Overworked\nAmerican, published in 1992, the economist Juliet Schor calculated we were\nworking nearly an extra month per year, setting off a rather sharp debate\nabout her methodology\u2014but even those who agree our leisure time is increasing\nwill readily concede that Americans experience their leisure quite differently\nand therefore may feel as if they\u2019re working more. For one thing, it\u2019s non-\ncontiguous leisure time, time meted out in discrete increments. Human beings\nhave always resisted the fracturing of time. Gleick points out that Plautus\ncursed the sundial. Now, he says, we gain 90- second reprieves with our\nmicrowave ovens. But do we do anything meaningful in those 90 seconds? Or do\nthey vanish in the same particle puff?\n\nJohn Robinson, the University of Maryland sociologist who calculated those\nexpanding leisure hours for the time-use survey, argues that our obsession\nwith efficiency at work has unfortunately seeped into our attitudes toward\nleisure, with the multitasking of our downtime as the loony and paradoxical\nresult. We run on the treadmill while listening to music while watching TV. We\ncook while flipping through a magazine while yakking on the phone. All of\nwhich raises a question: If our leisure isn\u2019t restorative, aren\u2019t we more apt\nto burn out?\n\n\u201cOh, yes, I would think so,\u201d says Schaufeli. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what burnout is,\nin essence. A mismatch between effort and recovery.\u201d\n\nAlden Cass is sitting in his office, showing me his various tools for\nreigniting burned-out clients. \u201cI created this thing, bullish-versus-bearish\nthinking,\u201d he says. He hands me a worksheet with silhouettes of bulls and\nbears. \u201cI give them for homework so they can monitor their thoughts,\u201d he\ncontinues. \u201cUsually, when you\u2019re burnt out, your first thought is vicious,\nirrational. What we call bearish. So they start monitoring what goes on in\ntheir heads. And once they have evidence, they can redirect those thoughts.\nThey have ammo now.\u201d\n\n> Burnout, says Farber, is \u201cthe gap between expectation and reward,\u201dwhich may\n> have the mostrelevance to New Yorkers. Thishas always been a city of\n> inflatedexpectations.\n\nBecause Cass is an executive coach, it\u2019s his job to tell people how to assume\nresponsibility for their own distress. But Maslach has always contended that\nburnout says more about the employer than it does about the employee. \u201cImagine\ninvestigating the personality of cucumbers to discover why they had turned\ninto sour pickles,\u201d she famously wrote in 1982, \u201cwithout analyzing the vinegar\nbarrels in which they\u2019d been submerged!\u201d The trouble is that corporate America\nhas always been leery of the presence of burnout researchers. When Cass tried\nwriting his dissertation about Wall Street burnout, he was turned away from\nevery human-resources office downtown. Maslach\u2019s not surprised. \u201cAnything that\nmight suggest that something is not working well in a company or an\norganization of some kind, people then worry, This could be used for a\nlawsuit,\u201d she says. \u201cSo doing research is fraught with peril.\u201d\n\nBut today, Maslach and her colleague, Michael Leiter, are attempting\nlongitudinal studies of employees in a variety of companies and institutions,\nhoping they can find early-warning signals of distress. Some of what they\u2019ve\nfound has been pretty amazing. In a university system, for instance, Maslach\ndiscovered that a certain employee award, designed with the best of\nintentions, was making people nuts. \u201cYou could not have designed a better\naward to engender backbiting and hostility,\u201d she says.\n\nMilton Moskowitz, co-author of Fortune magazine\u2019s annual \u201c100 Best Companies\nto Work For,\u201d keeps a mini-compendium of things that companies do to prevent\nburnout. Intel, for example, allows its employees to take an eight-week\nsabbatical once every seven years. (Of course, most Europeans take this much\nvacation every year, but still.) The managers at Boston Consulting Group place\ntheir consultants in a metaphorical \u201cRed Zone\u201d if they work 60 hours a week\nand send someone to come talk to them if the trend continues. And once a\nquarter, Dow Corning has a no-meetings week.\n\nBut it\u2019s an uphill battle. Moskowitz also tells me about a conversation he\nonce had with an employee at a high-profile high-tech firm. He reached this\nyoung man during the day, but only barely, because this fellow was heading out\nto see a movie. Moskowitz marveled at how wonderful that was and how flexible\nhis employer must be. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d the employee told him. \u201cHere, I can work\nwhatever 80 hours per week I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst case of Wall Street burnout I know is of this guy who wound up\ndriving a cab,\u201d Cass tells me.\n\nA cab?\n\nHe shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s a control factor in driving a cab. You go from point A to\npoint B. On Wall Street, you start your day with no idea how it\u2019s going to\nend.\u201d\n\ndriving a taxi doesn\u2019t sound like a particularly soothing solution to burnout.\nBut there\u2019s something to the idea of changing jobs. Maybe extreme burnout\nvictims don\u2019t need a life coach or a sabbatical or a no-meetings week. Maybe\nwhat they need is a headhunter.\n\nUsually, I can\u2019t imagine taking up another career. But in the rare moments I\ndo, my fantasies tend to run in an altruistic direction: Teach high-school\nEnglish in a poor school district. Fight poverty in Africa. Donate a kidney.\nAnd I wonder how many of my contemporaries share these fantasies or have\nactually done it\u2014that is, made a change in their lives that actually relieves\nthem from the crushing burdens of thinking about themselves. How strange would\nit be if people were trying to cure their burnout today by leaping to the\nhelping professions, the same professions that led people to study burnout in\nthe first place?\n\nThis July, the Boston Globe ran a startling story that said 64 percent of all\nstudents entering mortuary college today are over 30, rather than 23, which\nthey were a generation ago. (\u201cFrequently, these students want to emulate a\nwonderful job that a funeral professional did for them,\u201d Lyn Prendergast,\nexecutive vice-president of Fine Mortuary College, told the Globe. \u201cOr they\nhad a poor experience and feel they can do a far better job for the\nbereaved.\u201d) Of the 75 law firms surveyed in New York in The American Lawyer\u2019s\nrecent survey of mid-level associates, the firms ranked No. 1 (Dickstein\nShapiro) and No. 3 (Patterson Belknap) had one thing in common: They both\nreceived perfect scores on their attitudes toward pro bono work.\n\nI phone Barbara G. Wheeler, the president of Auburn Theological Seminary. She\ntells me that the average age of female students entering divinity school is\n37.\n\nThirty-seven. My age exactly. If only I weren\u2019t a Jew and an atheist, I\u2019d be\nin business.\n\n\u201cEvery seminary can introduce you to at least some students who\u2019ve been\nlawyers, journalists, opera singers,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have a lot of tolerance\nfor the little annoyances of the job, because they want to deal with life-and-\ndeath issues\u2014the moments when people tend to be most human, as Bill Coffin\nsaid.\u201d\n\nLindley DeGarmo, the pastor and head of staff at Towson Presbyterian Church in\nMaryland, harbored such desires. It was Wheeler who put me in touch with him.\nDeGarmo enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in 1996, when he was 42 years\nold. He sometimes jokes that the decision cost him, conservatively speaking,\n$6 million, because he missed the peak of the boom. At the time, he was\npulling in nearly a million dollars annually on Wall Street and living in a\n3,000-square-foot apartment in Brooklyn Heights. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d have done more\ngood if I\u2019d worked for a few more years and then given the seminary the\nmoney,\u201d he says. Though perhaps it\u2019s just as well. Just before entering the\nseminary, DeGarmo was considering a job with an intriguing company called\nEnron.\n\nDeGarmo says he can\u2019t isolate the moment that he knew his job wasn\u2019t for him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to make the direct correlation: Hmm, I\u2019m here on Monday\nmorning, and I don\u2019t like the values\u2014wouldn\u2019t it be nice to minister?\u201d he\nsays. \u201cBut when I fantasized about what I wanted to do, it was this.\u201d\nParticularly after he reached 40 and finally married. He started devouring\ntheological texts. He started attending church in New York, where for the\nfirst time he \u201cencountered really good preaching, exegesis, grappling with the\nlarger tradition of the church.\u201d Then came the moment, just after his child\nwas born, when he was sitting in a lonely hotel on a fruitless business trip.\nHe had absolutely no clue what he was doing there.\n\n\u201cThere are times when this is much more difficult work than what I dealt with\nas an investment banker,\u201d he says. \u201cIt draws on a whole lot more parts of you.\nYou get personally invested. I did 27 funerals last year. It can be draining.\nBut by and large, the joys outweigh the sorrows.\n\n\u201cIn seminary,\u201d he suddenly says, \u201cI did a bit of depth psychology.\u201d DeGarmo\nhad never studied it before. He was assigned Memories, Dreams, Reflections,\nand found himself beguiled by Carl Jung\u2019s theories about the opposing parts of\nour personalities. \u201cI remember Jung saying that the general trajectory of your\nlife is to work to your strength in your younger life, going great guns to\nestablish yourself at whatever you\u2019re doing,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut at some point\nin midlife, the other part of your personality\u2014the feminine instead of\nmasculine, or whatever other opposing trait\u2014is looking for expression. And if\nyou don\u2019t allow it to express itself, you\u2019re not, in effect, going to become a\nwhole person. Brittle is the word he uses.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s recalling this so fondly and so lyrically that I find myself caught in\nhis same reverie. It\u2019s hard to imagine this man was once a guy in a Town Car\non Wall Street.\n\n\u201cSo it occurs to me that maybe people who are burning out are bumping up\nagainst that phenomenon that Jung talks about,\u201d concludes DeGarmo. \u201cThe\nmasculine bumping up against the feminine, or the right brain against the\nleft. Whoever you are.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely sentiment, almost fit for a sermon. The question now is how many\nWall Streeters he can convert.\n\nShow 0 Comments / 0 New Leave a Comment\n\nCan\u2019t Get No Satisfaction\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
