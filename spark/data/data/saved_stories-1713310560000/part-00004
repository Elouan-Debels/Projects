What happens when you quit?\n\nMany researchers think that Wegovy and Ozempic should be taken for life, but\nmyriad factors can force people off them.\n\nBy\n\n  * McKenzie Prillaman^0\n\n  1.

But legions of people are also quitting\nthem. About two-thirds of those in the United States who started taking a drug\nof this class, known as GLP-1 agonists, in 2021 had stopped using them within\na year, according to an industry analysis.\n\nResearchers and clinicians often view GLP-1 agonists as lifelong treatments.\nBut myriad factors can force individuals off the medications. People might\nlose the means to pay for the costly drugs, experience brutal side effects, be\naffected by continuing shortages or be offered limited-term prescriptions. The\nUK National Health Service (NHS), for instance, provides only two years of\ncoverage for people taking the drugs for weight loss.\n\nAs the number of people with obesity continues to rise \u2014 the World Health\nOrganization estimates that more than one billion people, or one-eighth of the\nglobal population, now have obesity \u2014 researchers have been answering a few\nkey questions about what happens when people stop taking these medications for\nweight management.\n\n## What happens to weight and health when people quit?\n\nOzempic and Wegovy are both brand names for the drug semaglutide, which has\nbeen prescribed for several years to treat type 2 diabetes (Ozempic) and,\nsince 2021, to those who are overweight or have obesity (Wegovy). The\ntreatment\u2019s aim is to reduce the risk of health complications posed by a large\namount of excess body fat, such as heart and liver disease and certain\ncancers. The drug curbs hunger and food intake by mimicking a hormone,\nreleased by the gut after eating, that affects brain regions involved in\nappetite and reward.\n\nResearch has shown what happens when people stop taking GLP-1 agonists. Many\nregain a substantial amount of what they lost with the help of the\nmedications. The body naturally tries to stay around its own weight point, a\npull that obesity specialist Arya Sharma likens to a taut rubber band.\n\nIf you take a medication to alter your biology, \u201cthe tension of the rubber\nband is a lot less\u201d, he explains. \u201cBut when I take away the medication, that\ntension is going to come back,\u201d says Sharma, who is based in Berlin and\nconsults part-time for several companies that have an interest in obesity.\n\nFor instance, in a trial that studied the effects of withdrawing from the\ndrug, about 800 participants were given weekly injections of semaglutide \u2014 as\nwell as making dietary changes, doing exercise and receiving counselling \u2014 and\nlost, on average, 10.6% of their body weight in about 4 months^1. Then, one-\nthird of the participants were switched to placebo injections for nearly a\nyear. Eleven months after the switch, those on the placebo had regained almost\n7% of their body weight, whereas participants who kept taking semaglutide\ncontinued to lose weight. Similarly, participants in an extended semaglutide\ntrial, who lost an average of 17.3% of their body weight after more than one\nyear of receiving the drug and making lifestyle changes, regained about two-\nthirds of that lost weight after one year without any clinical-trial\ninterventions^2.\n\nAnd an observational study posted in January found that of nearly 20,300\npeople in the United States and Lebanon who lost at least 2.3 kilograms using\nsemaglutide and who later stopped taking the drug, 44% regained at least 25%\nof their lost weight after one year (see go.nature.com/3u7nxmj). The work was\nposted by Epic Research, a journal based in Verona, Wisconsin, that uses an\nelectronic health-record database to rapidly share medical knowledge. The\nstudy has not been peer reviewed.\n\nObesity drugs have another superpower: taming inflammation\n\nBut weight wasn\u2019t the only health risk factor that rebounded. In the\nwithdrawal study^1, those taking semaglutide beyond four months continued to\nlower their waist circumferences, says physician-scientist Fatima Cody\nStanford at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in\nBoston, who consults for several companies developing anti-obesity\nmedications. But \u201cthose switched to placebo start to regain in that central\nregion, which is around the key organs where we develop issues like fatty\nliver disease\u201d, she says.\n\nOther metabolic problems, such as heart disease and insulin resistance, are\nalso linked to excess body fat in the midsection: a larger waistline usually\nmeans excess visceral fat, which wraps around organs deep in the abdominal\ncavity and is more metabolically active than fat that sits under the skin.\nThese health risks, too, can revert to previous levels once the drug is\nstopped. People who came off semaglutide in clinical trials^1^,^2 often saw a\nrebound in blood pressure and levels of blood glucose and cholesterol, which\nhad improved while on the medication. (However, some of those measures\nremained better than those of clinical-trial participants who had never\nreceived semaglutide.)\n\nSome people who have lowered their weight with the medication can maintain\ntheir new physique through diet and exercise alone, says Sharma. However,\nthese individuals are at high risk of weight rebound if they return to old\nhabits or undergo a stressful situation, he adds.\n\nStill, researchers say, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that not everyone\nresponds to GLP-1 agonists. In one clinical trial, nearly 14% of participants\ndid not lose a clinically meaningful amount of body weight \u2014 at least 5% \u2014\nafter more than one year of taking semaglutide^3. Some health guidelines\nrecommend stopping the treatment if that threshold has not been met after\ntaking the medication for a few months.\n\n## What\u2019s making people stop?\n\nIt can be hard to keep taking the medications. Some people experience side\neffects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation, that are so\nextreme that they have to quit. Almost 75% of participants taking semaglutide\nin the aforementioned clinical trial^3 experienced gastrointestinal distress,\nalthough most instances were considered mild to moderate. About 7% of\nparticipants on the drug quit the trial because of adverse events,\ngastrointestinal or otherwise.\n\nThe drug\u2019s manufacturer, Novo Nordisk in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, has also had\ntrouble keeping up with the demand for semaglutide. Since 2022, the company\nhas announced shortages of both Wegovy and Ozempic; the latter is sometimes\nprescribed off-label for weight loss.\n\nSome people lose health-insurance coverage for the drugs, leaving them the\nchoice of paying pricey premiums or stopping the treatment, says clinician-\nscientist Jamy Ard at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in\nWinston\u2013Salem, North Carolina, who consults for and receives research funding\nfrom several companies that have obesity-drug-related programmes. Some of his\npatients, who paid for the drugs through their private health insurance, could\nno longer afford them when they retired and switched to the standard US\nfederal health insurance for people aged 65 or older, which does not cover\nanti-obesity medications for weight-loss management. In the United States,\nWegovy\u2019s list price is US$1,350 for one month\u2019s supply.\n\nAnd in the United Kingdom, where Wegovy was launched last September, those\nrelying on the NHS for semaglutide treatment face a two-year time limit.\nGuidance issued last March by the National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence (NICE) states that the time constraint comes from a lack of\nevidence for long-term use and limited access to specialized weight-management\nservices.\n\nThat two-year rule \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any clinical sense\u201d, says clinician-\nresearcher Alex Miras at Ulster University\u2019s Derry\u2013Londonderry Campus, UK, who\nreceives research and financial support from several companies with an\ninterest in obesity. But he acknowledges that the NICE decision came from\ncost-effectiveness calculations and the data the decision committee had at the\ntime.\n\nSemaglutide and other anti-obesity medications are available as NHS-funded\ntreatments only at a tier of weight-care management that often requires\nhospital support and that typically lasts for only two years. Although Miras\nsuspects that most doctors will abide by the time limit on semaglutide use,\neither to adhere strictly to NICE guidance or because of health-service\ncapacity issues, some might make exceptions depending on disease severity.\n\nStill, he urges the NHS to alter the system so that these medications are\navailable at a lower tier of weight-management services, making the drugs\naccessible to community-level clinics and lowering the costs for the NHS.\n\nAs information about the use of GLP-1 agonists continues to come in, Miras\nhopes to see \u201cchanging policy and changing practice based on our learnings\u201d.\n\n## What\u2019s the best way to quit?\n\nTreatment with a GLP-1 agonist requires starting with the smallest dose and\ngradually increasing the dosage over a few months. This escalating-dose\nschedule helps to minimize side effects. And, although physicians consider\nthese drugs a lifelong treatment, there\u2019s no biological harm in suddenly\nstopping.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a withdrawal issue or anything like that, like other medications\nwhere you have to titrate off,\u201d Stanford says. She advises people to inform\ntheir health-care providers of discontinued treatment so that they can keep\nmedical records up to date.\n\nBut Ard has encountered anecdotal evidence that suggests otherwise. After\nquitting GLP-1 agonists, some people have reported higher levels of hunger\nthan before they started treatment. Slowly tapering off the medication, rather\nthan an abrupt stop, he says, \u201cmight help with decreasing that sense of\nrebound hunger\u201d.\n\nThe \u2018breakthrough\u2019 obesity drugs that have stunned researchers\n\nSharma also recommends monitoring appetite and weight regained for those who\nwillingly stop the drugs. \u201cDon\u2019t wait till you put 30 pounds back on,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cIf you stop and you regain five pounds, maybe that\u2019s when you\u2019ve got to\njump back in.\u201d Restarting the medication after time off does require working\nyour way up from the smallest dose again, he says.\n\nFor people who have to stop taking GLP-1 agonists for the foreseeable future,\ncontinued dietary changes, exercise and mental-health counselling \u2014 which\nshould already be in place while on the medication \u2014 are a must, Stanford\nsays. People can also try anti-obesity medications that work in other ways,\nsuch as orlistat, which reduces how much dietary fat gets absorbed by the\nbody.\n\nBut \u201cby the time we\u2019ve gotten to the GLPs, we\u2019ve often unfortunately tried a\nlot of those\u201d, Stanford says. Another option might be bariatric surgery.\n\nOne of the most common reasons that people stop taking their medications is\nthat their weight plateaus, Sharma says, leading them to think that the drugs\nno longer work. He says that each person will respond to a dose in a different\nway, and that the dosage might need to be increased to lose more weight.\n\nAnd many people want to stop once they have reached their goal weight, Ard\nsays. Crossing that finish line gives a sense of completion, he says,\nespecially because weight journeys celebrate milestones. But obesity is a\nchronic disease that requires lifelong maintenance, including medication, just\nlike high blood pressure or heart disease do. \u201cAll we\u2019ve done is modify their\nphysiology,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe haven\u2019t cured the disease.\u201d\n\nSo much work has gone into developing GLP-1 agonists and getting the\nmedications to people who need them, Ard says. But \u201cwe need just as much \u2014 if\nnot more \u2014 work to be done on what happens after people reach that goal in\nthat weight-reduced state for the rest of their lives\u201d\n\nNature 628, 488-490 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01091-8\n\n## References\n\n  1.
