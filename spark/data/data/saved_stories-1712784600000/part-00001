Photograph: Eric WIlliams\n\nThe ObserverRonda Rousey\n\nInterview\n\n# Ronda Rousey: \u2018I never wanted to talk about concussion. It felt like a\nweakness\u2019\n\nDonald McRae\n\nThe former MMA fighter, once described as \u2018the world\u2019s most dominant athlete\u2019,\nreveals her fears for the future after a career riddled with glory and pain\n\nShare\n\n\u2018I worry about it because we already have Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia in our\nfamily, and those family members did not get whacked on the head a whole\nbunch,\u201d Ronda Rousey says as she considers a future shrouded by the\nconsequences of concussion and a past where she broke so many barriers for\nwomen before a shattering fall.\n\nAt her peak, in 2015, Rousey was described by Sports Illustrated as \u201cthe\nworld\u2019s most dominant athlete\u201d. She had changed a brutal sport to become the\nface of the UFC, the billion-dollar juggernaut which drives the popularity of\nMixed Martial Arts.\n\nApart from being the first woman signed by the deeply conservative UFC in\n2012, Rousey had built a formidable 15-0 record in which her bouts lasted an\naverage 34 seconds. But her ferocity was built on a hidden vulnerability.\nRousey had suffered so many concussions in judo that she knew her brain could\nnot withstand multiple more blows to the head. It was vital that she brought\nher fights in the UFC to a violent conclusion before she absorbed much\npunishment.\n\nRousey can now share her secret and is moving and amusing company as she\nreflects on the consequences of so many concussions. \u201cEvery time I forget my\nkeys or lose my phone, I\u2019m like: \u2018I\u2019m DYING! It\u2019s OVER!\u201d she says as she\nshouts out those words with comic flair.\n\nShe has just turned 37 and Rousey is thoughtful again. \u201cPart of me has\ndeclined and I have moments where I\u2019ll be singing my daughter a lullaby and\nI\u2019ll get a word wrong. I\u2019ll be like: \u2018Oh my God! This is it [the onset of\ndementia]!\u2019 On the drive home this morning, after dropping off my daughter for\nher first day of pre-school, I was passing corners I\u2019d passed hundreds of\ntimes and, for a moment, I was like \u2018Where am I?\u2019 And then it\u2019s a case of \u2018Oh\nyeah\u2019.\u201d\n\nRonda Rousey launches an attack on Sarah Kaufman during the Strikeforce event\nin 2012. Photograph: Esther Lin/Forza LLC/Getty Images\n\nWe all have moments of brain-fade but, for Rousey, it carries a tangled\nundertow. Her new book, written with her sister Maria Burns Ortiz, is often\ngripping and, at its best, offers a raw personal history of concussion. She\nbegan judo at the age of 11 and, driven by the aim of winning an Olympic gold\nmedal, Rousey tried to evade the fact \u201cI\u2019d been compounding concussion after\nconcussion for so many years\u201d.\n\nShe shrugs when I ask how many concussions she might have had in a calendar\nyear as a young woman. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say because I wouldn\u2019t rest when I had a\nconcussion. I would continue to train and keep re-aggravating it. So instead\nof having symptoms for a few days, I would have them for weeks or even months.\nMost of the year I would be having concussion symptoms. There are grades of\nseverity but my worst was being thrown on the back of my head at the Pan-\nAmerican [Judo] Championships in Argentina. I completely blacked out till the\nnext morning.\u201d\n\nRousey\u2019s concerns were ignored. \u201cI\u2019d be treated like I was complaining about a\nheadache. People would say: \u2018Your head hurts? Suck it up. What if your head\nhurts during the Olympics?\u2019 That\u2019s how I was taught to deal with it from a\nvery young age. It became a way of life.\u201d\n\nHer mother, AnnMaria [Burns], had become the first American to win the world\njudo championships in 1984. She then lost her husband, and Ronda her father,\nafter Ron Rousey took his life. Ronda was eight years old. Amid such\nadversity, AnnMaria began coaching Ronda and helped her win a gold medal at\nthe 2004 World Junior Judo Championships and bronze at the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nWhen Ronda was a girl, there was little scientific knowledge about concussion\nin the public domain. \u201cMy mother just didn\u2019t understand concussion,\u201d she says.\n\u201cNobody did because research only started coming out towards the end of my\njudo career. I was afraid of it and tried to suppress it. I\u2019d had so many more\nconcussions than anybody else in a 10-year judo career and so when I started\ndoing MMA I didn\u2019t want anyone to know. They already had enough reasons to try\nand stop me going into MMA and then the UFC. I didn\u2019t want to give them any\nmore about concussion and I was lucky to have the skills to win most fights\nreally quick.\u201d Rousey is suitably scathing about the ignorant machismo that\nhaunts MMA and boxing: \u201cPeople talk about your \u2018chin\u2019 with such reverence.\nIt\u2019s thrown around like it\u2019s a personality trait or a sign of your willpower\nto absorb blows. That\u2019s another reason why I never wanted to talk about\nconcussion. It felt like it was a personal weakness and not a neurological\ndegeneration I\u2019ve been experiencing since I was a child.\u201d\n\nRonda Rousey (blue) on her way to beating Germany\u2019s Annett Boehm in their\nwomen\u2019s -70kg judo bronze medal match at the 2008 Olympic Games. Photograph:\nOlivier Morin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe pushes her glasses higher up on the bridge of her nose. \u201cIt sucks because\nyou see what happened to a lot of these fighters. Muhammad Ali is one of my\nheroes and he had the greatest chin. But look what happened. I am not judging\nanyone as I would also accept living my life in a wheelchair if that was the\nprice I had to pay to achieve all I did. I respect Ali for being willing to\nlive that life because that\u2019s something I tried to do as well.\n\n\u201cI hope I don\u2019t end up that way but you never know. It might be decades later\nwhen you understand you\u2019ve taken one hit too many. When you have kids and\nfamily, it\u2019s much harder to gamble on your future. I went from being the most\neligible bachelorette on earth to instant family, and it completely changes\nyour priorities.\u201d\n\nRousey experienced a whirlpool of fame which she has now gladly exchanged for\na serene life on a regenerative farm she runs with her husband Travis Browne,\nthe former UFC fighter, who has two teenage boys. The couple have two young\nchildren of their own and, surrounded by family and animals, Rousey has found\na way to heal herself after the catastrophic end to her UFC domination.\n\nThe most powerful pages in Rousey\u2019s book document the aftermath of her\ncrushing first defeat when the former boxer Holly Holm knocked her out in\nfront of the UFC\u2019s then largest-ever crowd of 56,000 fans in Melbourne, and\nmore than a million people who had paid to watch the broadcast in November\n2015. Holm\u2019s first punch concussed Rousey. It also split the champion\u2019s lower\nlip wide open.\n\nAt the end of the round, Rousey bit off a small chunk of distended flesh,\n\u201cripping my teeth into my own lip like you would an apple\u201d, and spat it out.\nShe still feels the missing part of her inside lip today and remembers the\ndesolation of her locker room after being knocked out in the second round.\n\nRonda Rousey is on the canvas after being knocked out by Holly Holm in their\nUFC women\u2019s bantamweight championship bout in 2015.

She was barefoot, silent and shivering. \u201cI could taste the blood in\nmy mouth, my tongue against a gaping hole of flesh and muscle where my inside\nbottom lip had once been.\u201d\n\nShe could hear people outside revelling in her devastating defeat. \u201cIt was the\nworst moment of my life. It was the most intense pain, misery, embarrassment\nand shame I had ever felt. I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to swallow a\nbottle of painkillers, close my eyes, and end it.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on\nthe weekend\u2019s action\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Travis found the words as, while she\nsobbed in his arms, he reminded her: \u201cYou are so much more than a fighter.\u201d\n\nRousey had been venerated for so long and pressured into fighting for the UFC\nso often. But after that defeat and another early stoppage loss to Amanda\nNunes in December 2016, Rousey was ridiculed relentlessly in a defining\nexample of social media\u2019s desire to destroy a famous figure as they stumble.\nShe finally found a way out of such distress. It helped that Rousey knew she\nhad to protect her brain and no longer risk being punched or kicked in the\nhead. She also tells me how, with patience and humour, Travis showed her how\nto live normally again.\n\nRonda Rousey with husband Travis Browne. Photograph: Eric Williams\n\n\u201cHe was one of the very few people who saw me as more than just Ronda Rousey,\nthe UFC champion. Here\u2019s a perfect way to sum up Travis. When we first got\ntogether I told him that there was no way I was ever going to cook for a man.\nSo for a year he cooked every single meal we had together because he loved me.\nThen one day I said: \u2018I can make really nice pancakes. I want to make you some\npancakes.\u2019\u201d\n\nRousey laughs in delight. \u201cSo I started making pancakes and then more and more\nmeals. I wanted to show I loved him by cooking for him, as he had done for me.\nAnd then he did this really smart thing. He changed the voice on the GPS so\nthat it had an Australian accent. It was because he didn\u2019t want me to have any\nbad association with my defeat in Melbourne. To this day we still hear an\nAustralian voice on our GPS.\u201d\n\nIn California they have \u201cour regenerative ranch where we started with one seed\nand we now have hundreds of acres of grassland\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring out how to\nuse our animals and natural processes to bring this ecosystem to its fullest\npotential. We now have herds of antelope coming through and roe deer and\nmigrating geese. We\u2019ve taken this land that was so neglected and abused and\nmade it a real refuge for all the wildlife in the area as well as raising our\nanimals humanely so they can exhibit all their natural behaviours.\n\n> Regenerative agriculture is one of the most scalable solutions to combat\n> climate change. I really believe in it\n\n\u201cWe could have taken the money we made from fighting and put it into property\nand just been landlords. But I don\u2019t want to leave our kids a pile of money\nthat\u2019s on fire because the world is burning. Regenerative agriculture is one\nof the most scalable solutions to combat climate change. I really believe in\nit.\u201d\n\nRousey worked for a while as a wrestler in the WWE and she quickly discovered\nthat, even in that circus, women were treated badly. But she is proud of how\nshe changed combat sport and made women fighters integral to the business of\nthe UFC. \u201cI tried to win as quickly as possible, taking zero damage and I\u2019m\nreally proud of what I was able to accomplish \u2013 especially with my\nlimitations.\u201d\n\nShe has also found peace even if she cannot be certain of the future health of\nher brain. \u201cI need to enjoy the moment and be happy where I\u2019m at,\u201d Rousey says\nafter an hour of sombre reflection and riotous laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t want my body\nto be perfect when it\u2019s buried in the ground.\n\n\u201cI have no regrets and if I get to a point where you can just park me in front\nof the ocean and all I can do is sit and watch the whales, I should be happy\nwith that. I would do it all again, but I wish I could do it with a little\nmore science and knowledge in mind.\u201d\n\nOur Fight by Ronda Rousey is published on 4 April by Century Books\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Ronda Rousey\n  * The Observer\n  * US sports\n  * MMA\n  * UFC\n  * interviews\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Football\n  * Cricket\n  * Rugby union\n  * Tennis\n  * Cycling\n  * F1\n  * Golf\n  * US sports\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
