I tried to explain how it used to be easier to find\ninformation from good-faith experts, but I don\u2019t think I really got the point\nacross. Let me try again.\n\nNowadays we take it for granted that any time you run an internet search, most\nof what you find will be Out To Get You. It\u2019s content marketing cobbled\ntogether by chatbots, or by people who might as well be chatbots. It\u2019s\nalgorithmically optimized to squat in the top search results as part of\nsomeone\u2019s marketing funnel. It\u2019s propaganda by NGO hacks, or recent news\narticles on a different topic that shares a keyword, or literal paid\nadvertisements, or something. Maybe it has a little bit of information about\nwhat you actually wanted, and maybe it\u2019s a trailhead towards a deep and\nserious source, but you don\u2019t expect to just... find what you\u2019re looking for,\npresented straightforwardly.\n\n(I know the title promised this would be about academic research. Bear with\nme, I\u2019m getting there.)\n\nMy younger readers may not believe me, but internet search wasn\u2019t always like\nthis. Back in 1999, few people had figured out how to take advantage of search\nengines that way. When you looked for information about how to tell if your\nbread is rising correctly, or about South Korean cement manufacturing, or the\nmusical influences on Igor Stravinsky, or whatever weird thing, Google would\npull up high-quality reference material, or blogs and BBS arguments among\ndisagreeable weirdos who specialized in the subject and usually knew what they\nwere talking about. The tricky part wasn\u2019t sifting through a mound of spam and\npaywalls and halfassed summaries to find something legitimate; the challenge\nwas making sense of a high-context insider discussion on a topic you were\ntrying to wrap your head around.\n\nAs we now know, this didn\u2019t last forever. A cottage industry arose of finding\nsome search term and churning out low-cost copy on the subject in order to\nserve ads to people trying to find real information. Specialists in \u201csearch\nengine optimization\u201d popularized their techniques as consultants to big\ncompanies, and before long this became standard practice. In their efforts to\nkeep these problems from getting totally out of hand, Google and other search\nengines weighted search results towards a whitelist of standard lowest-common-\ndenominator websites. The long tail of the internet could no longer be found\nfrom a simple search.\n\nThe hyperfocused specialists and weird nerds are still out there thinking and\nwriting about their special interests, of course, but it\u2019s much harder to\nfind. You have to trace back sources and citations, or sift through the\nTwitter feed of a relatively knowledgeable author who mostly likes to yell\nabout elections, or dig up the Youtube video with 86 views by a Turkish\ngrandfather who just shows you how to replace the damn part, or you need to\nknow a guy whose roommate is part of the right group chat. Maybe it\u2019s out\nthere, but you can\u2019t just find it with a search.\n\nWorse, the weirdo specialists have a harder time finding each other. The days\nare gone when the people who are really interested in South Korean cement\nmanufacturing could just Google the mailing list and start talking with each\nother. Instead they\u2019re wandering through a desert of paid industry reports and\nBloomberg articles. Productive discourse has retreated to walled gardens, and\nas a consequence there is much less of it.\n\nWhat does this have to do with academic work? Well, again, whenever you find\nan academic publication, you can\u2019t just assume it\u2019s probably in good faith.\nYou have to start from the assumption that it\u2019s Out To Get You, because nine\ntimes out of ten, it is. Maybe it\u2019s activist bullshit based around\ntendentiously redefining words, or maybe it\u2019s built on fabricated medical\ndata, or maybe it\u2019s some kind of statistical jiggery-pokery to pull\nstatistical significance out of unreplicable noise, or maybe it\u2019s just a\nwatered-down summary of better work, or maybe the author stapled together\nplagiarized excerpts of other papers which she didn\u2019t understand\u2014sorry, the\nauthor merely omitted quotation marks and citations. Or maybe it\u2019s one of a\nhundred other things.\n\nAnd again, this might be hard to believe if you haven\u2019t read much academic\nwork from before 1990 or so, but it wasn\u2019t always this way. Sure, it was never\nperfect, and you always have to read everything with skepticism. But the\naverage quality was much better. Other people have written more deeply than I\never will about the forces that make today\u2019s academic work so shoddy, about\np-hacking and publish-or-perish and ideological fads and all that. What I know\nfor sure is that when I read academic work published in 2014, I\u2019m pretty\nlikely roll my eyes and mutter about how no serious person would even bother\nwith this crap and set it aside, whereas when I read something from 1964 then\nit\u2019s much more likely to be, at the very least, a good-faith effort by a\nreasonably bright person saying something they care about.\n\nFor example, lately I\u2019ve been researching the economic history of medieval\nChina. I find that almost everything that\u2019s actually worth reading was written\nbetween about 1940 and 1990. Before that, there wasn\u2019t much English-language\nresearch that was based on a deep understanding of Chinese records. After\nthat... I dunno, man. The recent stuff I\u2019ve found is mostly shallow crap\nchurned out to pad publication counts. The best recent work is summaries and\nretreads of older giants like Mark Elvin and Chi Ch'ao-ting and Joseph\nNeedham\u2014and these retreads contain real knowledge, but it adds very little to\nwhat came before, which is kind of embarrassing considering much of the\nmidcentury stuff is absolutely terrible at big-picture theorizing even when\ntheir local scholarship is extremely good. (This is only partly because many\nof that generation of China scholars were Maoists.)\n\nThe world is a big place, and I bet that somewhere out there, someone today is\nwriting excellent work about Song dynasty merchant families which I would\ndearly love to read, but I haven\u2019t been able to find it among the sea of\nbullshit and retreads. I\u2019m mostly sticking to older work while I wait for the\nrobots to get good enough at translation that I can read Chinese-language\nscholarship and primary sources.\n\nField after field is like this. A hundred years ago, all the important\nphysicists knew each other and were in constant dialogue. During the most\nrapid advance of theoretical physics in the history of the human species, it\nwas possible to, basically, take a group photo of the entire field:\n\nThe 29 participants in the fifth Solvay Conference in 1927. Those pictured\ninclude Bohr, de Broglie, Curie, Dirac, Einstein, Heisenberg, Lorentz, Pauli,\nPlanck, and Schrodinger. The only first-rate legendary physicists absent were\nRutherford and, if I\u2019m generous, Michelson. Both had attended an earlier\nSolvay Conference, and Michelson was 75 years old.\n\nToday it would be effectively impossible for a physicist to personally know\nall the other top physicists. In the U.S., the number of physics PhDs awarded\nper year grew from under 20 in 1900, to nearly 2,000 by 2018. Imagine trying\nto get all the leading theorists together for a group photo today.\n\nPhysics is the norm, not the exception. From 1900-1999, the U.S.\u2019s production\nof academic doctorates increased a hundredfold, while its population increased\nby 3.5 times\u2014that is, almost thirty times more PhDs per capita.\n\nChart from U.S. Doctorates in the 20th Century, Thurgood, Golladay, & Hill,\n2006.\n\nOf course, after this expansion, 21st century physics has not advanced a\nhundred times faster than it did during the time of Albert Einstein and Neils\nBohr. We do not have thirty times more Einsteins and Bohrs per capita. A\ndoctorate just means much less, now, than it did. The fraction of physicists\nwho can generate genuine new knowledge and insight is fairly small. Most of\ntoday\u2019s physicists would not measure up to the standards that the field held\nfor itself when that photo was taken in 1927. To their credit, physicists have\nmaintained intellectual and educational standards better than perhaps any\nother academic field. Medicine is in notably worse shape, for example. And\noutside of the hard sciences, well. It isn\u2019t good.\n\nThe dilution of the top experts doesn\u2019t only mean that it\u2019s harder for you and\nme and the New York Times to tell the first-rate researchers apart from the\nsea of mediocrities. It\u2019s also harder for those on the cutting edge to find\neach other. The real ones can tell, when they look deeply at each other\u2019s\nwork, but that takes a ton of time and effort, so it\u2019s not always practical.\nWhen an important new theory is published, instead of being circulated and\ntorn apart by the two dozen people whose opinions matter, it\u2019s sent off to\nsome nameless apparatchik for the hollow bureaucratic ritual of peer review,\nso that the reviewer can demand bogus citations for himself and his friends.\nEvery field has some real scientists doing excellent work. But twenty-nine\nthirtieths of their peers are cargo cultists, outright fraudsters, or at best\njust aren\u2019t all that great at their jobs. Much has been made of \u201cimpostor\nsyndrome\u201d in academic research. The fundamental cause is that there aren\u2019t\nenough non-impostors to fill all the positions.\n\nThe effect is similar to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. This\nis when an attacker shuts down an internet server by sending a massive flood\nof bogus communication requests, overloading the machine\u2019s bandwidth until it\nis unable to respond to legitimate requests. Academia\u2019s minority of serious\nresearchers are also flooded with a massive, hostile flood of bogus\ncommunication requests. If most of their ostensible peers can\u2019t discover new\nknowledge, then how will they find peers to work with? If most publications\naren\u2019t worth the time it takes to read, then who will bother to read the\nminority that are actually good?\n\nIntellectual progress is held back substantially by these problems. If the\nacademics do not raise their standards\u2014and it seems like the opposite is more\nlikely\u2014then over time the real work will move gradually, and then suddenly,\ninto different channels that are able to filter out the noise. This process is\nalready underway. Because the internet commentariat\u2019s intellectual elite is\nmore attentive to an argument\u2019s substance than whether it observes the\nbureaucratic forms, these circles are much less vulnerable to getting DDoSed\nby floods of well-formatted bullshit, and are slowly picking up more and more\nof the jobs that academia is abdicating. The 21st century\u2019s most influential\nphilosopher, so far, is an uncredentialed blogger and fanfiction author who\nlacks even a high school diploma. When it comes to understanding of how\nsociety works, academia still has a lock on the lowest common denominator, but\na growing fraction of the intellectual elite are leaving behind the\ninstitutions for internet self-publishing. Even archaeology is seeing some\nefforts to work outside of the academy, with well-funded projects like the\n\u201cVesuvius Challenge\u201d to decipher the Herculaneum Papyri. Whether the\nuniversities can reverse course, and if not then how long it will take before\nthey are simply left behind, remains to be seen.\n\nSubscribe to Ben Landau-Taylor\u2019s essays\n\n23 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n23\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The DDoS Attack Of Academic Bullshit\n\nwww.benlandautaylor.com\n\n8\n\nShare\n\n8 Comments\n\nTom P19 hrs agoWho is the 21st century\u2019s most influential philosopher, so\nfar?Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies by Ben Landau-Taylor and others\n\nzan22 hrs agoIs there a particular obscure primary text you wish to see\ntranslated?
