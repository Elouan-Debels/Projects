The storage is\nbased on Tesla\u2019s Powerpack 2 battery system.\n\nTESLA\n\nDarkBlue2\n\nIt\u2019s late in the afternoon of 2 April 2023 on the island of Kauai. The sun is\nsinking over this beautiful and peaceful place, when, suddenly, at 4:25 pm,\nthere\u2019s a glitch: The largest generator on the island, a 26-megawatt oil-fired\nturbine, goes offline.\n\nThis is a more urgent problem than it might sound. The westernmost Hawaiian\nisland of significant size, Kauai is home to around 70,000 residents and\n30,000 tourists at any given time. Renewable energy accounts for 70 percent of\nthe energy produced in a typical year\u2014a proportion that\u2019s among the highest in\nthe world and that can be hard to sustain for such a small and isolated grid.\nDuring the day, the local system operator, the Kauai Island Utility\nCooperative, sometimes reaches levels of 90 percent from solar alone. But on 2\nApril, the 26-MW generator was running near its peak output, to compensate for\nthe drop in solar output as the sun set. At the moment when it failed, that\nsingle generator had been supplying 60 percent of the load for the entire\nisland, with the rest being met by a mix of smaller generators and several\nutility-scale solar-and-battery systems.\n\nNormally, such a sudden loss would spell disaster for a small, islanded grid.\nBut the Kauai grid has a feature that many larger grids lack: a technology\ncalled grid-forming inverters. An inverter converts direct-current electricity\nto grid-compatible alternating current. The island\u2019s grid-forming inverters\nare connected to those battery systems, and they are a special type\u2014in fact,\nthey had been installed with just such a contingency in mind. They improve the\ngrid\u2019s resilience and allow it to operate largely on resources like batteries,\nsolar photovoltaics, and wind turbines, all of which connect to the grid\nthrough inverters. On that April day in 2023, Kauai had over 150 megawatt-\nhours\u2019 worth of energy stored in batteries\u2014and also the grid-forming inverters\nnecessary to let those batteries respond rapidly and provide stable power to\nthe grid. They worked exactly as intended and kept the grid going without any\nblackouts.\n\nThe photovoltaic panels at the Kapaia solar-plus-storage facility, operated by\nthe Kauai Island Utility Cooperative in Hawaii, are capable of generating 13\nmegawatts under ideal conditions.TESLA\n\nA solar-plus-storage facility at the U.S. Navy\u2019s Pacific Missile Range\nFacility, in the southwestern part of Kauai, is one of two on the island\nequipped with grid-forming inverters. U.S. NAVY\n\nThat April event in Kauai offers a preview of the electrical future,\nespecially for places where utilities are now, or soon will be, relying\nheavily on solar photovoltaic or wind power. Similar inverters have operated\nfor years within smaller off-grid installations. However, using them in a\nmultimegawatt power grid, such as Kauai\u2019s, is a relatively new idea. And it\u2019s\ncatching on fast: At the time of this writing, at least eight major grid-\nforming projects are either under construction or in operation in Australia,\nalong with others in Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East.\n\nReaching net-zero-carbon emissions by 2050, as many international\norganizations now insist is necessary to stave off dire climate consequences,\nwill require a rapid and massive shift in electricity-generating\ninfrastructures. The International Energy Agency has calculated that to have\nany hope of achieving this goal would require the addition, every year, of 630\ngigawatts of solar photovoltaics and 390 GW of wind starting no later than\n2030\u2014figures that are around four times as great as than any annual tally so\nfar.\n\nThe only economical way to integrate such high levels of renewable energy into\nour grids is with grid-forming inverters, which can be implemented on any\ntechnology that uses an inverter, including wind, solar photovoltaics,\nbatteries, fuel cells, microturbines, and even high-voltage direct-current\ntransmission lines. Grid-forming inverters for utility-scale batteries are\navailable today from Tesla, GPTech, SMA, GE Vernova, EPC Power, Dynapower,\nHitachi, Enphase, CE+T, and others. Grid-forming converters for HVDC, which\nconvert high-voltage direct current to alternating current and vice versa, are\nalso commercially available, from companies including Hitachi, Siemens, and GE\nVernova. For photovoltaics and wind, grid-forming inverters are not yet\ncommercially available at the size and scale needed for large grids, but they\nare now being developed by GE Vernova, Enphase, and Solectria.\n\n## The Grid Depends on Inertia\n\nTo understand the promise of grid-forming inverters, you must first grasp how\nour present electrical grid functions, and why it\u2019s inadequate for a future\ndominated by renewable resources such as solar and wind power.\n\nConventional power plants that run on natural gas, coal, nuclear fuel, or\nhydropower produce electricity with synchronous generators\u2014large rotating\nmachines that produce AC electricity at a specified frequency and voltage.\nThese generators have some physical characteristics that make them ideal for\noperating power grids. Among other things, they have a natural tendency to\nsynchronize with one another, which helps make it possible to restart a grid\nthat\u2019s completely blacked out. Most important, a generator has a large\nrotating mass, namely its rotor. When a synchronous generator is spinning, its\nrotor, which can weigh well over 100 tonnes, cannot stop quickly.\n\nThe Kauai electric transmission grid operates at 57.1 kilovolts, an unusual\nvoltage that is a legacy from the island\u2019s sugar-plantation era. The network\nhas grid-forming inverters at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, in the\nsouthwest, and at Kapaia, in the southeast. CHRIS PHILPOT\n\nThis characteristic gives rise to a property called system inertia. It arises\nnaturally from those large generators running in synchrony with one another.\nOver many years, engineers used the inertia characteristics of the grid to\ndetermine how fast a power grid will change its frequency when a failure\noccurs, and then developed mitigation procedures based on that information.\n\nIf one or more big generators disconnect from the grid, the sudden imbalance\nof load to generation creates torque that extracts rotational energy from the\nremaining synchronous machines, slowing them down and thereby reducing the\ngrid frequency\u2014the frequency is electromechanically linked to the rotational\nspeed of the generators feeding the grid. Fortunately, the kinetic energy\nstored in all that rotating mass slows this frequency drop and typically\nallows the remaining generators enough time to ramp up their power output to\nmeet the additional load.\n\nElectricity grids are designed so that even if the network loses its largest\ngenerator, running at full output, the other generators can pick up the\nadditional load and the frequency nadir never falls below a specific\nthreshold. In the United States, where nominal grid frequency is 60 hertz, the\nthreshold is generally between 59.3 and 59.5 Hz. As long as the frequency\nremains above this point, local blackouts are unlikely to occur.\n\n## Why We Need Grid-Forming Inverters\n\nWind turbines, photovoltaics, and battery-storage systems differ from\nconventional generators because they all produce direct current (DC)\nelectricity\u2014they don\u2019t have a heartbeat like alternating current does. With\nthe exception of wind turbines, these are not rotating machines. And most\nmodern wind turbines aren\u2019t synchronously rotating machines from a grid\nstandpoint\u2014the frequency of their AC output depends on the wind speed. So that\nvariable-frequency AC is rectified to DC before being converted to an AC\nwaveform that matches the grid\u2019s.\n\nAs mentioned, inverters convert the DC electricity to grid-compatible AC. A\nconventional, or grid-following, inverter uses power transistors that\nrepeatedly and rapidly switch the polarity applied to a load. By switching at\nhigh speed, under software control, the inverter produces a high-frequency AC\nsignal that is filtered by capacitors and other components to produce a smooth\nAC current output. So in this scheme, the software shapes the output waveform.\nIn contrast, with synchronous generators the output waveform is determined by\nthe physical and electrical characteristics of the generator.\n\nGrid-following inverters operate only if they can \u201csee\u201d an existing voltage\nand frequency on the grid that they can synchronize to. They rely on controls\nthat sense the frequency of the voltage waveform and lock onto that signal,\nusually by means of a technology called a phase-locked loop. So if the grid\ngoes down, these inverters will stop injecting power because there is no\nvoltage to follow. A key point here is that grid-following inverters do not\ndeliver any inertia.\n\nPrzemyslaw Koralewicz, David Corbus, Shahil Shah, and Robb Wallen, researchers\nat the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, evaluate a grid-forming inverter\nused on Kauai at the NREL Flatirons Campus. DENNIS SCHROEDER/NREL\n\nGrid-following inverters work fine when inverter-based power sources are\nrelatively scarce. But as the levels of inverter-based resources rise above 60\nto 70 percent, things start to get challenging. That\u2019s why system operators\naround the world are beginning to put the brakes on renewable deployment and\ncurtailing the operation of existing renewable plants. For example, the\nElectric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) regularly curtails the use of\nrenewables in that state because of stability issues arising from too many\ngrid-following inverters.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. When the level of inverter-based power sources\non a grid is high, the inverters themselves could support grid-frequency\nstability. And when the level is very high, they could form the voltage and\nfrequency of the grid. In other words, they could collectively set the pulse,\nrather than follow it. That\u2019s what grid-forming inverters do.\n\n## The Difference Between Grid Forming and Grid Following\n\nGrid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverters share several key\ncharacteristics. Both can inject current into the grid during a disturbance.\nAlso, both types of inverters can support the voltage on a grid by controlling\ntheir reactive power, which is the product of the voltage and the current that\nare out of phase with each other. Both kinds of inverters can also help prop\nup the frequency on the grid, by controlling their active power, which is the\nproduct of the voltage and current that are in phase with each other.\n\nWhat makes grid-forming inverters different from grid-following inverters is\nmainly software. GFM inverters are controlled by code designed to maintain a\nstable output voltage waveform, but they also allow the magnitude and phase of\nthat waveform to change over time. What does that mean in practice? The\nunifying characteristic of all GFM inverters is that they hold a constant\nvoltage magnitude and frequency on short timescales\u2014for example, a few dozen\nmilliseconds\u2014while allowing that waveform\u2019s magnitude and frequency to change\nover several seconds to synchronize with other nearby sources, such as\ntraditional generators and other GFM inverters.\n\nA recording of the frequency responses to two different grid disruptions on\nKauai shows the advantages of grid-forming inverters. The red trace shows the\nrelatively contained response with two grid-forming inverter systems in\noperation. The blue trace shows the more extreme response to an earlier,\ncomparable disruption, at a time when there was only one grid-forming plant\nonline.NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY\n\nSome GFM inverters, called virtual synchronous machines, achieve this response\nby mimicking the physical and electrical characteristics of a synchronous\ngenerator, using control equations that describe how it operates. Other GFM\ninverters are programmed to simply hold a constant target voltage and\nfrequency, allowing that target voltage and frequency to change slowly over\ntime to synchronize with the rest of the power grid following what is called a\ndroop curve. A droop curve is a formula used by grid operators to indicate how\na generator should respond to a deviation from nominal voltage or frequency on\nits grid. There are many variations of these two basic GFM control methods,\nand other methods have been proposed as well.\n\nTo better understand this concept, imagine that a transmission line shorts to\nground or a generator trips due to a lightning strike. (Such problems\ntypically occur multiple times a week, even on the best-run grids.) The key\nadvantage of a GFM inverter in such a situation is that it does not need to\nquickly sense frequency and voltage decline on the grid to respond. Instead, a\nGFM inverter just holds its own voltage and frequency relatively constant by\ninjecting whatever current is needed to achieve that, subject to its physical\nlimits. In other words, a GFM inverter is programmed to act like an AC voltage\nsource behind some small impedance (impedance is the opposition to AC current\narising from resistance, capacitance, and inductance). In response to an\nabrupt drop in grid voltage, its digital controller increases current output\nby allowing more current to pass through its power transistors, without even\nneeding to measure the change it\u2019s responding to. In response to falling grid\nfrequency, the controller increases power.\n\nGFL controls, on the other hand, need to first measure the change in voltage\nor frequency, and then take an appropriate control action before adjusting\ntheir output current to mitigate the change. This GFL strategy works if the\nresponse does not need to be superfast (as in microseconds). But as the grid\nbecomes weaker (meaning there are fewer voltage sources nearby), GFL controls\ntend to become unstable. That\u2019s because by the time they measure the voltage\nand adjust their output, the voltage has already changed significantly, and\nfast injection of current at that point can potentially lead to a dangerous\npositive feedback loop. Adding more GFL inverters also tends to reduce\nstability because it becomes more difficult for the remaining voltage sources\nto stabilize them all.\n\nWhen a GFM inverter responds with a surge in current, it must do so within\ntightly prescribed limits. It must inject enough current to provide some\nstability but not enough to damage the power transistors that control the\ncurrent flow.\n\nIncreasing the maximum current flow is possible, but it requires increasing\nthe capacity of the power transistors and other components, which can\nsignificantly increase cost. So most inverters (both GFM and GFL) don\u2019t\nprovide current surges larger than about 10 to 30 percent above their rated\nsteady-state current. For comparison, a synchronous generator can inject\naround 500 to 700 percent more than its rated current for several AC line\ncycles (around a tenth of a second, say) without sustaining any damage. For a\nlarge generator, this can amount to thousands of amperes. Because of this\ndifference between inverters and synchronous generators, the protection\ntechnologies used in power grids will need to be adjusted to account for lower\nlevels of fault current.\n\n## What the Kauai Episode Reveals\n\nThe 2 April event on Kauai offered an unusual opportunity to study the\nperformance of GFM inverters during a disturbance. After the event, one of us\n(Andy Hoke) along with Jin Tan and Shuan Dong and some coworkers at the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, collaborated with the Kauai Island\nUtility Cooperative (KIUC) to get a clear understanding of how the remaining\nsystem generators and inverter-based resources interacted with each other\nduring the disturbance. What we determined will help power grids of the future\noperate at levels of inverter-based resources up to 100 percent.\n\nNREL researchers started by creating a model of the Kauai grid. We then used a\ntechnique called electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation, which yields\ninformation on the AC waveforms on a sub-millisecond basis. In addition, we\nconducted hardware tests at NREL\u2019s Flatirons Campus on a scaled-down replica\nof one of Kauai\u2019s solar-battery plants, to evaluate the grid-forming control\nalgorithms for inverters deployed on the island.\n\nIn sunny South Australia, solar power now routinely supplies all or nearly all\nof the power needed during the middle of the day. Shown here is the chart for\n31 December 2023, in which solar supplied slightly more power than the state\nneeded at around 1:30 p.m. AUSTRALIAN ENERGY MARKET OPERATOR (AEMO)\n\nAt 4:25 pm on 2 April, there were two large GFM solar-battery plants, one\nlarge GFL solar-battery plant, one large oil-fired turbine, one small diesel\nplant, two small hydro plants, one small biomass plant, and a handful of other\nsolar generators online. Immediately after the oil-fired turbine failed, the\nAC frequency dropped quickly from 60 Hz to just above 59 Hz during the first 3\nseconds. [Red trace in Figure 4] As the frequency dropped, the two GFM-\nequipped plants quickly ramped up power, with one plant quadrupling its output\nand the other doubling its output in less than 1/20 of a second.\n\nIn contrast, the remaining synchronous machines contributed some rapid but\nunsustained active power via their inertial responses, but took several\nseconds to produce sustained increases in their output. It is safe to say, and\nit has been confirmed through EMT simulation, that without the two GFM plants,\nthe entire grid would have experienced a blackout.\n\nCoincidentally, an almost identical generator failure had occurred a couple of\nyears earlier, on 21 November 2021. In this case, only one solar-battery plant\nhad grid-forming inverters. As in the 2023 event, the three large solar-\nbattery plants quickly ramped up power and prevented a blackout. However, the\nfrequency and voltage throughout the grid began to oscillate around 20 times\nper second (the blue trace in Figure 4), indicating a major grid stability\nproblem and causing some customers to be automatically disconnected. NREL\u2019s\nEMT simulations, hardware tests, and controls analysis all confirmed that the\nsevere oscillation was due to a combination of grid-following inverters tuned\nfor extremely fast response and a lack of sufficient grid strength to support\nthose GFL inverters.\n\nIn other words, the 2021 event illustrates how too many conventional GFL\ninverters can erode stability. Comparing the two events demonstrates the value\nof GFM inverter controls\u2014not just to provide fast yet stable responses to grid\nevents but also to stabilize nearby GFL inverters and allow the entire grid to\nmaintain operations without a blackout.\n\n## Australia Commissions Big GFM Projects\n\nThe next step for inverter-dominated power grids is to go big. Some of the\nmost important deployments are in South Australia. As in Kauai, the South\nAustralian grid now has such high levels of solar generation that it regularly\nexperiences days in which the solar generation can exceed the peak demand\nduring the middle of the day [Figure 5].\n\nThe most well-known of the GFM resources in Australia is the Hornsdale Power\nReserve in South Australia [photo, p. TK]. This 150-MW/194-MWh system, which\nuses Tesla\u2019s Powerpack 2 lithium-ion batteries, was originally installed in\n2017 and was upgraded to grid-forming capability in 2020.\n\nAustralia\u2019s largest battery (500 MW/1,000 MWh) with grid-forming inverters is\nexpected to start operating in Liddell, New South Wales, later this year. This\nbattery, from AGL Energy, will be located at the site of a decommissioned coal\nplant. This and several other larger GFM systems are expected to start working\non the South Australia grid over the next year.\n\nOne of Australia\u2019s major energy-storage facilities is the Hornsdale Power\nReserve, at 150 megawatts and 194 megawatt-hours. Hornsdale, along with\nanother facility called the Riverina Battery, are the country\u2019s two largest\ngrid-forming installations. NEOEN\n\nThe leap from power systems like Kauai\u2019s, with a peak demand of roughly 80 MW,\nto ones like South Australia\u2019s, at 3,000 MW, is a big one. But it\u2019s nothing\ncompared to what will come next: grids with peak demands of 85,000 MW (in\nTexas) and 742,000 MW (the rest of the continental United States).\n\nSeveral challenges need to be solved before we can attempt such leaps. They\ninclude creating standard GFM specifications so that inverter vendors can\ncreate products. We also need accurate models that can be used to simulate the\nperformance of GFM inverters, so we can understand their impact on the grid.\n\nSome progress in standardization is already happening. In the United States,\nfor example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)\nrecently published a recommendation that all future large-scale battery-\nstorage systems have grid-forming capability.\n\nStandards for GFM performance and validation are also starting to emerge in\nsome countries, including Australia, Finland, and Great Britain. In the United\nStates, the Department of Energy recently backed a consortium to tackle\nbuilding and integrating inverter-based resources into power grids. Led by the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, the University of Texas at Austin, and\nthe Electric Power Research Institute, the Universal Interoperability for\nGrid-Forming Inverters (UNIFI) Consortium aims to address the fundamental\nchallenges in integrating very high levels of inverter-based resources with\nsynchronous generators in power grids. The consortium now has over 30 members\nfrom industry, academia, and research laboratories.\n\nIn addition to specifications, we need computer models of GFM inverters to\nverify their performance in large-scale systems. Without such verification,\ngrid operators won\u2019t trust the performance of new GFM technologies. Using GFM\nmodels built by the UNIFI Consortium, system operators and utilities such as\nthe Western Electricity Coordinating Council, American Electric Power, and\nERCOT (the Texas\u2019s grid-reliability organization) are conducting studies to\nunderstand how GFM technology can help their grids.\n\n## Getting to a Greener Grid\n\nAs we progress toward a future grid dominated by inverter-based generation, a\nquestion naturally arises: Will all inverters need to be grid-forming? No.\nSeveral studies and simulations have indicated that we\u2019ll need just enough GFM\ninverters to strengthen each area of the grid so that nearby GFL inverters\nremain stable.\n\nHow many GFMs is that? The answer depends on the characteristics of the grid\nand other generators. Some initial studies have shown that a power system can\noperate with 100 percent inverter-based resources if around 30 percent are\ngrid-forming. More research is needed to understand how that number depends on\ndetails such as the grid topology and the control details of both the GFLs and\nthe GFMs.\n\nUltimately, though, electricity generation that is completely carbon free in\nits operation is within our grasp. Our challenge now is to make the leap from\nsmall to large to very large systems. We know what we have to do, and it will\nnot require technologies that are far more advanced than what we already have.\nIt will take testing, validation in real-world scenarios, and standardization\nso that synchronous generators and inverters can unify their operations to\ncreate a reliable and robust power grid. Manufacturers, utilities, and\nregulators will have to work together to make this happen rapidly and\nsmoothly. Only then can we begin the next stage of the grid\u2019s evolution, to\nlarge-scale systems that are truly carbon neutral.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * 800,000 Microinverters Remotely Retrofitted on Oahu\u2014in One Day \u203a\n  * How Rooftop Solar Can Stabilize the Grid \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Grid-Forming Inverters: Shaping the Future of Power Distribution \u203a\n  * How one device could help transform our power grid \u203a\n\ngrid forming invertersrenewable energyinverterssolar energywind energydirect\ncurrentgreen gridsTechnology & ComputingNews and PoliticsElectrical\nEngineeringComputingConsumer ElectronicsRoboticsNational\nNewsPoliticsWeatherDisastersInternet\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nBenjamin Kroposki\n\nBen Kroposki is the Director of the Power Systems Engineering Center at the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
