Over 1,500 developer-centric organizations used\nour product to get more context about developers, drive developer adoption, or\nsimply improve their developer experience. Through that, we gained a deep\nunderstanding of how developer ecosystems work. Naturally, open source was a\nbig part of this. On top of that, we built crowd.dev in the open ourselves,\ngaining 3k+ GitHub stars over the last few months.\n\nThe Linux Foundation is the premier organization dedicated to advancing open\nsource software and collaboration in the technology industry. For over two\ndecades, it has championed the adoption of open source technologies. The Linux\nFoundation hosts and enables over 900 of the world\u2019s most critical software\nprojects (including the Linux Kernel, Node.js, PyTorch, etc.) that power a\nsignificant share of the technology each and every one of us uses every day.\n\nOur shared story began in January 2023 when Jim Zemlin from the Linux\nFoundation reached out and asked to take a look at Crowd.dev. Because our\nproduct was open source and a tool to help the Linux Foundation serve its\ncommunities more effectively, we were naturally aligned.\n\nOver months, it became clear that our teams share the same vision: providing\nthe infrastructure for building a healthy, vibrant, and secure open source\necosystem. Therefore, it was a logical next step to join forces and keep\npursuing this vision together.\n\n## What this means for crowd.dev customers\n\nSince the former crowd.dev team will be fully focused on the Linux Foundation\ngoing forward, we will not be able to offer our SaaS product any longer. Here\nis an overview of what this means for existing customers:\n\n  * The crowd.dev SaaS will be shut down by 30 June 2024. We will be available to assist with any data migrations and other issues until that date.\n  * The code remains open source, so you can host the application yourself, for free.\n  * Customers with an annual contract will receive pro-rata refunds.\n  * Our second product Crowdlens - AI-powered social listening - will be continued by a new team and under a new brand.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about what this acquisition means for\nyou, please feel free to send me an email. I\u2019m here to help you.\n\nLast but not least, we would like to thank everyone who believed in us and\nmade this journey possible: The whole Linux Foundation team as well as our\nteam, customers, community, investors, advisors, friends, families, and\neveryone else who contributed to crowd.dev.
