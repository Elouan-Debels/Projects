In fact, it's as if there isn't an incoming call at all. Nothing is\neven shown on the display regarding an incoming call. My only clue is when\nsomeone leaves a message and for that I _am_ notified (yes, notifications\nstill make audible sounds).\n\nI've tried turning off Bluetooth: No change.\n\nI also tried turning off the WiFi connection and using my Verizon connection.\nWhen I did that the call came through. But when I turned WiFi back on, the\ncall still came through. But after a while it will revert to calls not coming\nthrough again.\n\nDetails\n\nContacts, Calls, Voicemail,Google Pixel 7 Pro,Android\n\nCommunity content may not be verified or up-to-date.

I'm on ATT and a standard Pixel 7.\n\nI've also had a few instances of people being unable to hear me even though my\nphone is NOT on mute. I have to turn mute on and then turn it back off and\nthey can hear me.\n\nOhAndroid\n\n17 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 3:16:50 AM\n\nTotally agree with Kate. Phone is now a brick. Cant even call it a \"phone\" at\nthis point. Called and b*tched out google support today and all they can do is\ntell me to \"please file a bug report\". Pfft, iPhone is my next phone for sure.\n\nJacob Schimelman\n\n45 min. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 6:42:20 PM\n\noh I have the same issue! Didn't even think it was related to the recent\nupdate.

Then they said I\nmust hardreset my phone then it's over. I said that's no solution look at\ninternet it's not fixed after hardreset if I don't do that then there iis no\nsolution.\n\nI send them a message last Friday and now it's in the googlestire in Poland\nnow waiting.\n\nDon Straight\n\n7 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 12:33:24 PM\n\nAdding my name to the list of affected users as well as my wife, both of us on\nPixel 7's via AT&T.\n\nSMS texts are delivered sporadically, sometimes a dozen of them will come in\nall at once hours after they were sent. Restarting/toggling airplane mode\ndoesn't seem to fix this, it's truly random as to when the texts are finally\ndelivered.\n\nIncoming phone calls will randomly not ring in, callers are sent straight to\nvoicemail. Restarting the phone usually fixes this, but only for a few days\nbefore it happens again. Maddening.\n\nUser 10620410386949761464\n\n6 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 1:37:18 PM\n\nSame issue. Wife uses Pixel 7 as a business phone, potential clients couldn't\nreach her last month and called her competitors. I cannot assess the financial\ndamage this bug dealt to her, but she had surprisingly little to do in March.\n\nSince Google struggles to resolve this issue, she switched the phones and is\nselling her Pixel. Couldn't imagine google being so unreliable.\n\nrdb4987\n\n6 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 1:57:12 PM\n\nSame thing - pixel 7 on AT&T service.\n\nMarc 4062\n\n6 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 2:26:32 PM\n\nSame issue with my wife and my 7P's. Rebooting alleviates the issue but it\nreturns and there's no way to know when it returns. The phone just stops\nreceiving calls and/or texts. Tried clearing cache and data from phone app on\nmy phone and it's gotten better for me. But the same results are not happening\nfor the wife's phone. Hers has been this bad for a couple months now. But got\nworse in March after the update.\n\nTli\n\n4 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 3:38:35 PM\n\nI have a google Pixel 7 and with Verizon, I am having the same issue. I will\nreboot and then it will start working, but then will go back to not receiving\ncalls again in a few days. Very frustrating, and this all started after March\nupdate to version 14.\n\nErik Molenaar\n\n3 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 5:09:27 PM\n\nSame issue here Pixel 8 Pro\n\nPieter68\n\n2 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 5:38:37 PM\n\nSamen here. Pixel 8 pro. Calls missing but does not appear in missed calls\nlist. Sms comes hours too late. Dropped calls etc etc. It is my work phone and\nit is useless now. Paid more then $1.200 for this phone. Must be fixed soon!\n\nLast edited 2 hr. ago\n\nUser 3418213589086464130\n\n2 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 5:33:53 PM\n\nSame issue on Verizon.\n\nUser 7135643221718552906\n\n2 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 6:06:13 PM\n\nGeez, history just keeps repeating itself for Google and not in a good way.\nOnce again a broken update and takes days for the issue to bubble up. I'm\nlearning of it from news articles stating that yet again Google doesn't know\nhow to QA and release a decent update AND that they don't acknowledge user\nfeedback for days until it hits major news outlets and they have too.\n\nAfter their screw ups in Oct and Jan, I stopped using the Pixel feature of\n\"timely monthly security updates\"; I'm still on January patch. I guess instead\nof feature drops, it's quarterly screw-ups that Google should be promoting\ninstead.\n\nFeel for those with issues and hope for speedy resolution, but I think I'll\nsit this one out and keep ignoring the \"it's time to update\" prompts.\n\nRichard Singh\n\n2 hr. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 6:24:03 PM\n\nNot sure if this helps or not (so far since updating my phone\ncalling/messaging has been solid) but I found that I was two Google Play\nsystem update's behind (Settings > About Phone > Android Version > Google play\nsystem update). Not sure why I was missing two updates but since updating\naround 7pm last night, calling has been solid. Hoping this might have fixed\nthe issue!\n\nDavid Hanna 5125\n\n54 min. ago\n\n4/10/2024, 6:33:52 PM\n\nSame issue for weeks. Clearing cache in phone app after every call and\ntoggling wifi seems to cure. Just bought iPhone. Done with this b.s. Been\nusing Google phones since nexus 2. Steady decline since pixel 4a\n\nRelated content\n\nGoogle Pixel Update - Mar 2024\n\nCheck your Phone settings to avoid missed calls\n\nFix mobile connectivity issues\n\nChange call settings\n\nMarch update network issues without warning ...\n\nfalse\n\n  * \u00a92024 Google\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Community Policy\n  * Community Overview\n\nEnable Dark Mode\n\nSend feedback about our Help Center\n\n14119905862739543656\n\ntrue\n\nSearch Help Center\n\ntrue\n\ntrue\n\ntrue\n\nGoogle Help\n\n  * Help Center\n  * Community\n  * Pixel Phone\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Submit feedback\n\ntrue\n\ntrue\n\n1634144\n\nSearch\n\nClear search\n\nClose search\n\nMain menu\n\nGoogle apps\n\nSend feedback on...\n\nfalse\n\n", "frontpage": false}
