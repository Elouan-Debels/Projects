He moved to Malacca years ago to\nstart a tapas restaurant with his wife. As we sat by the street, watching the\nhumid air condense on our beer glasses, we started talking about the logistics\nof running a restaurant there. He described the the difficulty of hiring and\ntraining the local staff to his foreign standard.\n\nHe struggled with the Nepalese migrant workers that made up half of his staff.\nThese boys, he explained, were dropped at the airport by their agency and left\nto fend for themselves.\n\nWhen they had problems with money or health, with loneliness or the family\nback home, they\u2019d turn to him and his wife. He was unexpectedly thrust into\nthe role of a father figure for half a dozen boys. He truly had to run the\nbusiness like a family, with all the drama it involved.\n\nMore interestingly, unlike the Nepalese, he continued, the Muslim migrant\nworkers fared much better. When they arrived in Malacca, the local mosque\nwould soften their landing. There, they could find community, a place to spend\ntime, and people to help them. They had a support network. The Nepalese\nworkers did not.\n\nI help immigrants for a living. I am keenly aware of how it feels to move\nsomewhere without a support network. Yet I was completely oblivious to the\noldest support network in the world: religion. I could talk somebody\u2019s head\noff about third places and social infrastructure, but it never occurred to me\nthat mosques could be examples to learn from.\n\nThere is value to congregating with your neighbours every day. In every\ndiscussion about the loneliness epidemic, commenters will remind people of the\nChurch\u2019s role in their community, and what is being lost with its fading\nrelevance.\n\nIt leaves me thinking about my role in my community. For the last few years, I\nhave focused on creating a resource for Berlin\u2019s immigrants, but I should also\nhave been building a community. Going forward, I\u2019d like to develop the sort of\nsocial infrastructure to binds this community together.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
