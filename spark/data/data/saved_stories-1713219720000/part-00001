Tesla employs 140,473\npeople, according to its annual report.\n\nMusk wrote that Tesla had grown rapidly in recent years and as a result there\nhad been duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas.\n\nOil price falls despite Middle East tensions; Tesla \u2018to cut 10% of staff\u2019;\nGoldman Sachs profits jump \u2013 as it happened\n\nRead more\n\nReferring to the job cuts, he wrote: \u201cThere is nothing I hate more, but it\nmust be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the\nnext growth phase cycle.\u201d\n\nThe move follows a difficult start to the year for the electric carmaker.\nTesla said it had made approximately 387,000 deliveries to customers in the\nfirst quarter of 2024, missing market expectations by about 13%. It was its\nfirst fall in deliveries in nearly four years.\n\nThe company cited production problems caused by unforeseen factors such as\nattacks on shipping in the Red Sea and an arson attack on its factory in\nBerlin, but the figures also pointed to a softening in global demand.\n\nAfter the release of the sales figures this month, Musk dismissed comments\nthat his divisive persona had caused a downturn in sales and pointed to\nsimilarly poor figures from the Chinese rival BYD, saying it was a \u201ctough\nquarter for everyone\u201d.\n\nRoss Gerber, the chief executive of the investment management firm Gerber\nKawasaki and an outspoken critic of Musk\u2019s leadership, said the jobs cuts were\n\u201cproof of the true cost of the damage to the brand as Tesla sales fall in a\nstrong economy\u201d.\n\nGerber, whose firm owns a small shareholding in Tesla, added: \u201cNo doubt the\ncombination of a lack of advertising, real competition and a toxic CEO is a\nbad mix.\u201d\n\nThe company is also aiming to shore up its margins \u2013 a measure of profit \u2013\nwhich have been hit by repeated price cuts, especially in China, where it\nfaces stiff competition from local competitors including BYD, which briefly\novertook Tesla as the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle maker in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, and the new entrant Xiaomi.\n\nTesla recorded a gross profit margin of 17.6% in the fourth quarter, its\nlowest in more than four years.\n\nMatthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst, said the job cuts reflected\n\u201cthe slowing pace of growth of an electric car market, which it appears Tesla\nisn\u2019t immune from\u201d.\n\nShares in Tesla dropped by 3.5% in early trading on Monday to $165, down from\n$171.05 on Friday night. That knocked about $19bn (\u00a315bn) off its market\ncapitalisation, which fell to $525bn, down from $544bn at the end of last\nweek. So far this year, Tesla has lost a third of its value.\n\nThe carmaker has manufacturing sites in California, Nevada, New York and Texas\nin the US as well as plants in Germany and China.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported on Monday that BP had cut more than a tenth of\nthe workforce in its electric vehicle charging business \u2013 representing more\nthan 100 jobs \u2013 and has pulled it out of several markets after a bet on rapid\ngrowth in commercial electric vehicle fleets did not pay off.\n\nBP said the changes at its Pulse unit were \u201ca step towards ensuring that we\ncan execute our goals with even greater precision and effectiveness\u201d.\n\nTesla was contacted for comment.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Tesla\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Automotive industry\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### How much is Elon Musk to blame for Tesla sales slip?\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Tesla quarterly car deliveries fall for the first time in nearly four years\n\n2 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Tesla settles with former employee over racial discrimination claims\n\n16 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Leftwing group claim responsibility for Tesla factory arson attack in Berlin\n\n5 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### German town votes against Tesla plans to expand \u2018gigafactory\u2019\n\n21 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Elon Musk\u2019s $56bn Tesla pay package is too much, judge rules\n\n30 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Three cheers for the Delaware judge who stood up to Elon Musk\n\n31 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Tesla pauses German production after Red Sea shipping attacks\n\n12 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Tesla loses legal action in Sweden as dispute with Nordic unions escalates\n\n7 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Danish union joins strike action against Tesla by Swedish workers\n\n5 Dec 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
