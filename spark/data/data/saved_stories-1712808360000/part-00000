And\nhere\u2019s the concerning part, that I still haven\u2019t quite figured out \u2014 the\nTwitter card indeed says \u201cFrom calendly . com\u201d, making the link seem 100%\nlegitimate. But, well... see next post...\n\n2h\n\nCabel Sasser @cabel\n\n3 It actually took me to calendaly dot com \u2014 close, but no cigar!\n\nThe page has a big \u201cContinue\u201d button with the X logo on it, so after picking a\ndate and time for my incredible fake interview on the incredibly fake\ncalendar, I bet you already know what I got next...\n\n2h *\n\nCabel Sasser @cabel\n\n4 Yes, in order to schedule my non-existent interview, I had to grant Calend|y \u2014yes, this time with a pipe | character instead of an l \u2014 full access to my Twitter account.\n\nWhich would then immediately be hijacked and ruined forever.\n\n(Why did the Twitter card say \u201cfrom calendly\u201d[1]? Why did Twitter approve this\nfake Calend|y app? You know this already, but wow, that site is not a safe\nplace in any way.)\n\n[1] Update, this is why: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/scammers-abusing-\ntwitter-cards-via-redirects/\n\n2h\n\nMieszko \u015alusarczyk @spitfire@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel But it\u2019s making so much money now, right? Right;)?\n\n2h\n\nIrenes (many) @irenes@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel heh, that is quite something. thanks for sharing these details, it's a\ngood one to be aware of.\n\nas you noted, there are a lot of unusual things about that from the start, if\nit weren't phishing it would likely have been some pay-for-placement thing.\n\n2h\n\nCabel Sasser @cabel\n\n@irenes I\u2018m glad y\u2019all found it interesting! And yes, it could have gone in\nmany questionable directions.\n\n2h\n\nTom Swift @tom_t_21@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel Calendly offers automatic redirect on paid plans. Maybe they used a\nlegit Calendly link, which automatically redirected you to their website and\nTwitter just got the preview from the legit Calendly.\n\n2h\n\nJoshua Hamilton @JoshuaHamilton@mastodon.cloud\n\n@tom_t_21 @cabel I don\u2019t know anything about Calendly, but another option may\nbe that the scammer\u2019s link checks the request headers and if it\u2019s a Twitter\nbot fetching metadata, it redirects to a legit URL. If it\u2019s just a normal\nbrowser request, you go to scam town. I read about that recently, anyway. Very\nsneaky\n\n2h\n\nFinn Voorhees @finnvoorhees@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel I think you can do this fairly easily by just redirecting requests from\nthe twitter bot's user agent to the real calendly, and all other traffic to\nthe phishing site.\n\n2h\n\nAlesandro Ortiz @AlesandroOrtiz@infosec.exchange\n\n@finnvoorhees @cabel This. It's common in other platforms, such as Google Ads\n(to serve malicious landing pages to users, but legitimate page to crawlers).\n\n2h\n\nConlan Spangler @conlan@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel I recall a recent story about spoofing urls on those Twitter cards. It\nseemed pretty simple, but I can\u2019t find the info now.\n\n2h\n\nConlan Spangler @conlan@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel I\u2019m not sure if this is the same exploit, but it was something like\nthis. https://medium.com/@l3x1/how-i-hijacked-the-url-displayed-on-twitter-\nlink-previews-3796904eb1cb\n\nMedium \u00b7 Oct 7, 2021How I hijacked the URL displayed on Twitter Link\nPreviewsBy Lexi\n\n2h\n\nLeon Cowle @leoncowle@hachyderm.io\n\n@cabel The url/cert was even worse it seems: it was for calindaly (with an\n\u201ci\u201d)!\n\n1h\n\nSo\u2010Called Vaughn @vaughnsc@techhub.social\n\n@leoncowle @cabel Guess all the other \u2018lookalike\u2019 domains were taken.\n\n2h\n\nGunnarsson @gunnarsson@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel It was discovered a while back that if you check the user agent and\nredirect Twitterbot to a legitimate site when it generates the card, that's\nthe host name that will be displayed on there. All other traffic can then be\nredirected wherever you want ...\n\n2h\n\nGunnarsson @gunnarsson@mastodon.social\n\n@cabel https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/scammers-abusing-twitter-cards-via-\nredirects/\n\nTerence Eden\u2019s BlogCrypto Scammers Abusing Twitter Cards via Redirects\n\n2h\n\ndogzilla @dogzilla@masto.deluma.biz\n\n@cabel @Migueldeicaza Ha!

Well, the first letters of the profile picture\u2019s\ninfo actually begin with \u201dai\u201d in lowercase, followed immediately by the rest\nof the profile text.
