But almost by\ndefinition, they are less visible.\n\n##\n\nSkilled Pragmatists\n\nSkilled pragmatists are too smart to wade into conflicts or political\nmaneuvering. They work within the system. They are under-challenged and bored\nat work but are resourceful enough to scratch those itches in other ways. They\naren't lazy\u2014doing the bare minimum and stopping\u2014but they also don't go \"above\nand beyond\" because they are inherently skeptical that it is worth it. They\nare very reliable, but to the point where they are conveniently (to them)\ninvisible. Occasionally, they show flashes of brilliance to remind people\nthey've got the chops, but not so often that it throws them into the lion's\nden.\n\nImportantly, these employees resist managerial efforts to \"engage and\nchallenge\" them. They don't need to be engaged\u2014they are fairly balanced. And\nthey'd love to be challenged if working within the existing system wasn't so\ndifficult. \"I have my projects outside of work to be challenged; thank you\nvery much.\" So, the normal playbook doesn't work. It feels condescending and\npaternalistic.\n\n(Note: Before continuing, I want to note that skilled pragmatists often have\nthe privilege of being ABLE to be somewhat detached yet still earn a living.\nMany people do not enjoy the privilege of fading into the background and are\nsubject to much more scrutiny, stress, gaslighting, and doubt.)\n\nLet's explore an example of a prototypical skilled pragmatist to make this\nreal.\n\n##\n\nMaria\u2014A Skilled Pragmatist\n\nIt is very clear to Maria that her team is spinning in circles. She watches\nwith mild amusement as managers struggle in vain to push back on reactive\nfeature requests. She's skilled and makes decent progress with the spaghetti\ncodebase the team inherited, but she knows she could be a lot more productive.\n\nAt standups, Maria doesn't waste energy calling out things beyond her (and the\nteam's) immediate control. Yes, software engineering is her passion, but she's\nnot about to burn a lot of social capital by rocking the boat\u2014she sees what\nhappens to those people. She has some co-workers who have extremely strong\ncareerist tendencies. In some cases, they game the performance management\nsystem to the Nth degree to the detriment of customer outcomes. She knows\nmoving up takes a bit longer, but she has also had good luck shifting\ncompanies every couple of years to get a raise and promotion. It's almost like\nnew hiring managers sense she has been under-utilized.\n\nMaria is a skilled pragmatist. She is not a pushover or an underperformer. She\nis a human navigating the weird sociotechnical systems we call \"Companies.\"\n\n##\n\nSo What?\n\nHere's the problem, however. Instead of figuring out how to tap into the\nincredible potential of the Maria's, companies:\n\n  * Hear the loud voices in the room, with strong opinions about what is broken. You are missing out on a whole source of information about how to fix the problem.\n\n  * Focus on the obvious \"poor performers\". This is funny because you might have ~5% of employees who are low performers. Yet have 60-80% Marias.\n\n  * Focus on rewarding 10x heroics and the cutthroat careerists\n\n  * Incorrectly see the issue as an \"engagement\" problem.\n\n  * Blame front-line managers for not engaging Maria when the issues exist elsewhere. Maria becomes a \u201cmanagement problem\u201d vs. a leadership problem.\n\n  * Diminish Maria's contributions because they are less visible and showy.\n\n  * Promote people who actively poke and prod the system OR who are politically savvy enough to navigate the system\u2014which has the byproduct of perpetuating whatever dysfunctions exist. Why change things when the people in power positions are adept at navigating things?\n\nCompanies are doing layoffs when they are sitting on a goldmine of talent,\nmotivation, and people who want to be challenged but aren't being challenged!\n\nIf you want a Part 2 here on how to solve this. Here are some closing thoughts\nfor now.\n\nI was thinking about what drew me to tech in the first place. Fun! How\nincredible is it to be paid to be a problem/puzzle solver and build/make\nthings with other similarly curious people that can impact humans? That's\nincredible. Sometimes I have to pinch myself.\n\nI've realized that one of my big triggers is incoherence, dissonance, and\nwaste. Many companies are filled with talented people who love to solve\nproblems, yet we're only scratching the surface regarding harnessing their\npotential.\n\nAnd we make it SO HARD on ourselves. It is like we sabotage ourselves. I'm not\nsure why\u2014maybe humans will be human, maybe it is power and money, maybe it is\nthe natural entropy of companies and products\u2014but many of the problems we face\nat work are very addressable. Yet, for whatever reason, it has to be\ndifficult.\n\nOr does it?\n\nAnd with that...consider the untapped Maria potential in your company.\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve written Part 2.\n\n### Subscribe to The Beautiful Mess\n\nBy John Cutler \u00b7 Launched 4 years ago\n\nThe beautiful mess of cross-functional product development\n\n149 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n8 Restacks\n\n149\n\nShare this post\n\n#### TBM 271: The Biggest Untapped Opportunity\n\ncutlefish.substack.com\n\n24\n\nShare\n\n24 Comments\n\nStepan PotapovStepan\u2019s SubstackFeb 4Liked by John CutlerI agree: there are\nmore calm and talented people than \u201cnoisy\u201d ones.
