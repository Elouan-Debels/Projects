How he got\nstarted:\n\n  * Didn\u2019t know how to get started in open source.\n  * Found some other people on the project and they helped him.\n  * He started with simple tasks like fixing typos.\n  * Moved on to presenting his code to small groups and in small lightning talks, which helped him build his confidence.\n  * Then, as his coding work became more visible, companies asked him to come to work with them.\n\nWe continued discussing collaborating in the open, making changes to a\nproject, tools, and how coding is a small part of the project - there are a\nlot of other opportunities to contribute.\n\nShare this post:\n\n##\n\nAbout\n\nWell-known in the open source and cloud native ecosystem as an expert in\nproduct-led growth strategies, developer marketing, open source marketing, and\ngrowing healthy and productive communities.\n\nWith thoughtful nurturing, your open source project and tech community can\ngrow from watchers and casual participants to contributors, and the ultimate -\nfans, advocates, and community leaders.\n\nSomewhere in this path are your future customers. Yes, future customers, and\nif you do it in a thoughtful manner you have given them the tools and\ninformation to make that decision for themselves. Which keeps them coming back\nto your community to learn, participate, and lead.\n\nMy career has been spent in open source, cloud native, and high-performance\ncomputing. Focusing on marketing and community, I have led organizations,\ncreated strategic plans and messaging, grew revenue, implemented programs, and\ndrove activities that supported the goals of the organization. I am the\n\u201cmarketer\u201d of open source and can grow healthy and productive communities.\n\nKnowing what to say, how to say it, where to share it, and bringing all\nelements together in a cohesive, yet efficient manner - that\u2019s the magic.\n\nI believe in a holistic approach to marketing; that messaging aligns with your\nstrengths, go-to-market activities interact and build upon each other, and\nunderstanding our partner's and customer\u2019s business issues and giving them\nwhat will drive their business will deliver success.\n\nWant to talk about marketing or community?
