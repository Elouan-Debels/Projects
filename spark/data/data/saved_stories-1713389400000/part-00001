The Shepherd Color Company\nlicensed YInMn blue for use in a wide range of coatings and plastics, and it\nalso inspired a new Crayola crayon color: Bluetiful.\n\nWhen YInMn blue was discovered, researchers had been experimenting with new\nmaterials that could be used in electronics applications and mixed manganese\noxide \u2013 which is black in color \u2013 with other chemicals, then heated them in a\nfurnace to nearly 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nOne of their samples turned out to be a brilliant blue, named YInMn blue after\nthe component elements yttrium, indium and manganese. It was the first blue\npigment discovery in two centuries and a huge advance in safety and durability\nas well as vividness.\n\nIn the new study, Subramanian, research associate Jun Li and graduate student\nAnjali Verma were inspired by the divalent copper that serves as a chromophore\nin Egyptian blue, which is the world\u2019s first known synthetic pigment and dates\nto more than 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers replaced the divalent copper in Egyptian blue with divalent\nchromium, leading to durable, reddish magenta pigments. To stabilize the\ndivalent chromium on Earth, researchers maintained high temperatures, almost\n2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, under high vacuum during the synthesis that started\nfrom chromium metal, chromium trioxide and other chemicals.\n\n\u201cMost of the magenta-colored pigments used today are organic chemicals and\nsuffer from stability issues when exposed to ultraviolet rays and heat from\nthe sun because they can break down organic chemical bonds,\u201d Subramanian said.\n\u201cInorganic magenta pigments are rare, and most require a significant amount of\ncobalt salts that are hazardous to both humans and the environment.\u201d\n\nThe magenta pigments developed by OSU researchers are thermally and chemically\ninert because of their high preparation temperature and remain unaltered\nstructurally and optically upon exposure to acid and alkali, the authors note.\n\nIn addition, unlike pigments that contain cobalt, the chromium-based magenta\npigments are highly reflective of heat from the sun \u2013 meaning they have a\ncooling property that would lead to energy savings for cars and structures\ncoated in them.\n\n\u201cMost pigments are discovered by chance,\u201d Subramanian said. \u201cThe reason is\nbecause the origin of the color of a material depends not only on the chemical\ncomposition but also on the intricate arrangement of atoms in the crystal\nstructure. So someone has to make the material first in a laboratory, then\nstudy its crystal structure thoroughly to explain the color.\u201d\n\nDespite recent advances in quantum mechanical theories and computational\nmethods, predicting a crystal structure that will produce an intense inorganic\npigment of a desired color is still elusive, he added.\n\n\u201cWe got lucky the first time with YInMn blue, and now we are coming up with\nsome fundamental chemical and crystal structural design principles to\nrationally create new pigments,\u201d he said. \u201cDetermining the key structural\ningredients required for making vivid colors should allow for shorter times\nbetween pigment discoveries. Science doesn't always follow a prescribed path,\nbut we\u2019re exploring pigments with divalent chromium as a chromophore in\ndiverse coordination environments in crystal structures of various inorganic\ncompounds.\u201d\n\nThe NSF funding for the just-published study was a special grant earmarked for\nhigh-risk, high-reward research. The grant is known by the acronym EAGER,\nwhich stands for Early Concepts Grants for Exploratory Research.\n\n## College of Science\n\nAbout the OSU College of Science: As one of the largest academic units at OSU,\nthe College of Science has seven departments and 12 pre-professional programs.\nIt provides the basic science courses essential to the education of every OSU\nstudent, builds future leaders in science, and its faculty are international\nleaders in scientific research.\n\nStory By:\n\nSteve Lundeberg, 541-737-4039 steve.lundeberg@oregonstate.edu\n\nSource:\n\nMas Subramanian, 541-737-8235 mas.subramanian@oregonstate.edu\n\nMultimedia:\n\nClick photos to see a full-size version.
