Rating\nsystems can be used for anything from movies and books to products and\nservices.\n\nUses cases:\n\n  * Shopping: For example, a user can rate a product on a shopping site.\n  * Movies: A user can rate a if they like a movie or how well it was made.\n  * Books: A customer can rate a book on a website.\n  * Products: A user can rate a product on an e-commerce site.\n  * Services: A user can rate a service on a website.\n\n### Let\u2019s get started\n\nThis is the structure of the project: Understanding the code:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ rating: -1 }\": This is the data that will be used to store the rating.\n  * <template x-for=\"(star, index) in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\" :key=\"index\">: This is the loop that will display the stars.\n  * `@click=\u201crating = (rating === index) ?\n  * :class=\"{ 'text-orange-500': index <= rating, 'text-gray-400': index > rating }\": This is the event listener that will update the rating when a star is clicked.\n  * <span x-text=\"(rating === -1) ? '0 stars' : rating + 1 + ' stars'\" class=\"text-gray-500\"></span>: This is the display of the current rating.\n\nClasses are removed for brevity, but I\u2019ll keep those classes relveant to the\ntutorial.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ rating: -1 }\"> <!-- Display Stars --> <div > <template x-for=\"(star, index) in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\" :key=\"index\"> <svg @click=\"rating = (rating === index) ? -1 : index\" :class=\"{ 'text-orange-500': index <= rating, 'text-gray-400': index > rating }\"> <!-- SVG Path goes here--> </svg> </template> </div> <!-- Display Current Rating --> <div class=\"mt-2\"> <span x-text=\"(rating === -1) ? '0 stars' : rating + 1 + ' stars'\" class=\"text-gray-500\" ></span> </div> </div>\n\n### Conlcusion\n\nThis is a simple rating system that can be used for any type of content, such\nas movies, books, products, or services. The code is easy to understand and\nthe structure is clear. The use of Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js makes it easy to\nstyle the rating system and add interactivity.\n\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial and have a great day!\n\n## Reviews and opinions\n\nSee them all\n\n  * \"I bought a beautiful theme from Lexington a couple weeks ago.
