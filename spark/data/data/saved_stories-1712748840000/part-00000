The Government of Canada committed an investment of $99.1 million over four years starting in 2024 to launch the new SJTF to help workers upgrade their skills or gain new skills for jobs in the low-carbon economy.\n\n  * Supporting union-led green skills training for apprentices and journeypersons in skilled trades through the new Union Training and Innovation Program sustainable jobs stream will contribute toward building a robust supply of skilled tradespeople who are better equipped with the green skills needed to succeed in Canada\u2019s low-carbon economy.\n\n  * According to Natural Resources Canada, low-carbon energy jobs are estimated to grow to 2.68 million by 2050. Supporting workers in these industries necessitates a diversification of skills to match the unique demands of low-carbon energy and decarbonization technologies.\n\n  * According to labour market data from 2021, an estimated 314,257 jobs were attributable to the environmental and clean technology products sector, up 6.5% from 2020 and accounting for 1.6% of all jobs in Canada in 2021. The utilities industry was the largest industry group in terms of employment, accounting for over one fifth (65,656) of environmental and clean technology jobs in 2021.\n\n  * It is anticipated that about 1.1 million workers across all sectors will retire over the next three years. Royal Bank of Canada estimates the net-zero transition could create up to 400,000 new jobs in Canada by the end of this decade alone.\n\n  * Through a series of national climate plans since 2016\u2014including the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, which was the first plan under the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act\u2014the Government of Canada has committed over $120 billion to climate action and low-carbon economic development.\n\n## Related products\n\n  * Backgrounder: Government of Canada launches call for proposals under the new Sustainable Jobs Training Fund\n\n## Associated links\n\n  * Sustainable Jobs Training Fund\n  * Canadian Apprenticeship Strategy\n  * Union Training and Innovation Program\n  * 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan: Clean Air, Strong Economy\n  * Sustainable Jobs Plan\n  * ESDC on Facebook\n\n## Contacts\n\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\n\nMathis Denis Press Secretary Office of the Honourable Randy Boissonnault\nMinister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages\n343-573-1846 mathis.denis@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca\n\nMedia Relations Office Employment and Social Development Canada 819-994-5559\nmedia@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca Follow us on X (Twitter)\n\nSearch for related information by keyword: Funding | Skills | Sustainable development | Education and Training | Labour | Employment and Social Development Canada | Canada | Government priorities | general public | government | job seekers | media | news releases | Hon.
