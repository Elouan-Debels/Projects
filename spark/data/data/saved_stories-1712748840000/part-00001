It uses technologies such as image layer separation of text and\nbackground/images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding, and lossy\ncompression for bitonal (monochrome) images. This allows high-quality,\nreadable images to be stored in a minimum of space, so that they can be made\navailable on the web.\n\nDjVu has been promoted as providing smaller files than PDF for most scanned\ndocuments.^[3] The DjVu developers report that color magazine pages compress\nto 40\u201370 kB, black-and-white technical papers compress to 15\u201340 kB, and\nancient manuscripts compress to around 100 kB; a satisfactory JPEG image\ntypically requires 500 kB.^[4] Like PDF, DjVu can contain an OCR text layer,\nmaking it easy to perform copy and paste and text search operations.\n\nFree creators, manipulators, converters, web browser plug-ins, and desktop\nviewers are available.^[2] DjVu is supported by a number of multi-format\ndocument viewers and e-book reader software on Linux (Okular, Evince,\nZathura), Windows (Okular, SumatraPDF), and Android (Document Viewer,^[5]\nFBReader, EBookDroid, PocketBook).\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe DjVu technology was originally developed by Yann LeCun, L\u00e9on Bottou,\nPatrick Haffner, Paul G. Howard, Patrice Simard, and Yoshua Bengio at AT&T\nLabs from 1996 to 2001.^[4]\n\nPrior to the standardization of PDF in 2008,^[6]^[7] DjVu had been considered\nsuperior due to it being an open file format in contrast to the proprietary\nnature of PDF at the time. The declared higher compression ratio (and thus\nsmaller file size), and the claimed ease of converting large volumes of text\ninto DjVu format, were other arguments for DjVu's superiority over PDF in the\ntechnology landscape of 2004. Independent technologist Brewster Kahle in a\n2004 talk on IT Conversations discussed the benefits of allowing easier access\nto DjVu files.^[8]^[9]\n\nThe DjVu library distributed as part of the open-source package DjVuLibre has\nbecome the reference implementation for the DjVu format. DjVuLibre has been\nmaintained and updated by the original developers of DjVu since 2002.^[10]\n\nThe DjVu file format specification has gone through a number of revisions, the\nmost recent being from 2005.\n\nRevision historyVersion| Release date| Notes  \n---|---|---  \nOld version, no longer maintained: 1\u201319^[citation needed]| 1996\u20131999|\nDevelopmental versions by AT&T labs preceding the sale of the format to\nLizardTech.  \nOld version, no longer maintained: Version 20^[1]| April 1999| DjVu version 3.\nDjVu changed from a single-page format to a multipage format.  \nOlder version, yet still maintained: Version 21^[1]| September 1999| Indirect\nstorage format replaced.

As that\nniche is also the primary usage for PDF, it was inevitable that the two\nformats would become competitors. It should however be observed that the two\nformats approach the problem of delivering high resolution documents in very\ndifferent ways: PDF primarily encodes graphics and text as vectorised data,\nwhereas DjVu primarily encodes them as pixmap images. This means PDF places\nthe burden of rendering the document on the reader, whereas DjVu places that\nburden on the creator.\n\nDuring a number of years, significantly overlapping with the period when DjVu\nwas being developed, there were no PDF viewers for free operating systems\u2014a\nparticular stumbling block was the rendering of vectorised fonts, which are\nessential for combining small file size with high resolution in PDF. Since\ndisplaying DjVu was a simpler problem for which free software was available,\nthere were suggestions that the free software movement should employ DjVu\ninstead of PDF for distributing documentation; rendering for creating DjVu is\nin principle not much different from rendering for a device-specific printer\ndriver, and DjVu can as a last resort be generated from scans of paper media.\nHowever when FreeType 2.0 in 2000 began provide rendering of all major\nvectorised font formats, that specific advantage of DjVu began to erode.\n\nIn the 2000s, with the growth of the World Wide Web and before widespread\nadoption of broadband, DjVu was often adopted by digital libraries as their\nformat of choice, thanks to its integration with software like Greenstone^[11]\nand the Internet Archive,^[12] browser plugins which allowed advanced online\nbrowsing, smaller file size for comparable quality of book scans and other\nimage-heavy documents^[13] and support for embedding and searching full text\nfrom OCR.^[14]^[15] Some features such as the thumbnail previews were later\nintegrated in the Internet Archive's BookReader^[16] and DjVu browsing was\ndeprecated in its favour as around 2015 some major browsers stopped supporting\nNPAPI and DjVu plugins with them.^[17]\n\nDjVu.js Viewer attempts to replace the missing plugins.\n\n## Technical overview[edit]\n\n### File structure[edit]\n\nThe DjVu file format is based on the Interchange File Format and is composed\nof hierarchically organized chunks. The IFF structure is preceded by a 4-byte\nAT&T magic number. Following is a single FORM chunk with a secondary\nidentifier of either DJVU or DJVM for a single-page or a multi-page document,\nrespectively.\n\nAll the chunks can be contained in a single file in the case of the so called\nbundled documents, or can be contained in several files: one file for every\npage plus some files with shared chunks.\n\n#### Chunk types[edit]\n\nChunk types in DjVu filesChunk identifier| Contained by| Description  \n---|---|---  \nFORM:DJVU| FORM:DJVM| Describes a single page. Can either be at the root of a\ndocument and be a single-page document or referred to from a DIRM chunk.  \nFORM:DJVM| \u2014| Describes a multi-page document. Is the document's root chunk.  \nFORM:DJVI| FORM:DJVM| Contains data shared by multiple pages.  \nFORM:THUM| FORM:DJVM| Contains thumbnails.  \nINFO| FORM:DJVU| Must be the first chunk. Describes the page width, height,\nformat version, resolution, gamma, and rotation.  \nDIRM| FORM:DJVM| Must be the first chunk. References other FORM chunks. These\nchunks can either follow this chunk inside the FORM:DJVM chunk or be contained\nin external files. These types of documents are referred to as bundled or\nindirect, respectively.  \nNAVM| FORM:DJVM| If present, must immediately follow the DIRM chunk. Contains\na BZZ-compressed outline of the document.  \nANTa, ANTz| FORM:DJVI or FORM:DJVU| Annotations.  \nTXTa, TXTz| FORM:DJVU| Unicode text and layout information.  \nINCL| FORM:DJVU| The ID of an included FORM::DJVI chunk.  \nSjbz| FORM:DJVU| BZZ compressed JB2 bitonal data used to store mask.  \nDjbz| FORM:DJVI or FORM:DJVU| Shared shape table.  \nWMRM| ?| JB2 data required to remove a watermark.  \nCIDa| FORM:DJVU| Obsolete chunk with unknown content.  \n  \n### Compression[edit]\n\nDjVu divides a single image into many different images, then compresses them\nseparately. To create a DjVu file, the initial image is first separated into\nthree images: a background image, a foreground image, and a mask image. The\nbackground and foreground images are typically lower-resolution color images\n(e.g., 100 dpi); the mask image is a high-resolution bilevel image (e.g., 300\ndpi) and is typically where the text is stored. The background and foreground\nimages are then compressed using a wavelet-based compression algorithm named\nIW44.^[4] The mask image is compressed using a method called JB2 (similar to\nJBIG2). The JB2 encoding method identifies nearly identical shapes on the\npage, such as multiple occurrences of a particular character in a given font,\nstyle, and size. It compresses the bitmap of each unique shape separately, and\nthen encodes the locations where each shape appears on the page. Thus, instead\nof compressing a letter \"e\" in a given font multiple times, it compresses the\nletter \"e\" once (as a compressed bit image) and then records every place on\nthe page it occurs.\n\nOptionally, these shapes may be mapped to UTF-8 codes (either by hand or\npotentially by a text recognition system) and stored in the DjVu file. If this\nmapping exists, it is possible to select and copy text.\n\nSince JB2 (also called DjVuBitonal) is a variation on JBIG2, working on the\nsame principles,^[18] both compression methods have the same problems when\nperforming lossy compression. In 2013 it emerged that Xerox photocopiers and\nscanners had been substituting digits for similar looking ones, for example\nreplacing a 6 with an 8.^[19] A DjVu document has been spotted in the wild\nwith character substitutions, such as an n with bleeding serifs turning into a\nu and an o with a spot inside turning into an e.^[20] Whether lossy\ncompression has occurred is not stored in the file.^[1] Thus the DjView\nviewing application can't warn the user that glyph substitutions might have\noccurred, neither when opening a lossy compressed file, nor in the Information\nor Metadata dialogue boxes.^[21]\n\n## Format licensing[edit]\n\nDjVu is an open file format with patents.^[3] The file format specification is\npublished, as well as source code for the reference library.^[3] The original\nauthors distribute an open-source implementation named \"DjVuLibre\" under the\nGNU General Public License. The rights to the commercial development of the\nencoding software have been transferred to different companies over the years,\nincluding AT&T Corporation, LizardTech,^[22] Celartem^[23] and Cuminas.^[24]\n\nCelartem acquired LizardTech and Extensis.^[25]^[26]^[23]^[27]^[28]\n\n## Support[edit]\n\nThe selection of downloadable DjVu viewers is wider on Linux distributions\nthan it is on Windows or Mac OS. Additionally, the format is rarely supported\nby proprietary scanning software.\n\nIn 2002, the DjVu file format was chosen by the Internet Archive as a format\nin which its Million Book Project provides scanned public-domain books online\n(along with TIFF and PDF).^[29] In February 2016, the Internet Archive\nannounced that DjVu would no longer be used for new uploads, among other\nreasons citing the format's declining use and the difficulty of maintaining\ntheir Java applet based viewer for the format.^[17]\n\nWikimedia Commons, a media repository used by Wikipedia among others,\nconditionally permits PDF and DjVu media files.^[30]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Comparison of e-book formats\n  * International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)\n  * JPEG 2000 Compound image file format (JPM)\n  * Mixed raster content (MRC)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i \"Lizardtech DjVu Reference\" (PDF).
