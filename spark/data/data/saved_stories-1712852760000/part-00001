Back in\n2022, we covered TrueNAS CORE 13, the new release of its FreeBSD-based turnkey\nOS for NAS servers, and in that article we mentioned its new product, the\nDebian-based TrueNAS SCALE, aimed at providing storage for Kubernetes users.\n\nNow it seems the company is betting its future on that Linux-based product,\nmeaning the end is in sight for the FreeBSD offering.\n\nTrueNAS SCALE is apparently thriving. Gartner recently handed iXsystems a gong\nfor Customers' Choice in storage. With some VMware users feeling uncomfortable\nabout Broadcom's takeover and assessing alternatives, many TrueNAS customers\ntold the company that they were considering KVM.\n\nMeanwhile, the company released version 23.10 of the Debian-based TrueNAS\nSCALE. It even found time to donate its Fast DeDup feature to the FOSS world.\n\nGood for iXsystems, and good for TrueNAS SCALE. But what about, if you'll\npardon the pun, its core offering? It's called TrueNAS CORE 13 because it's\nbased on FreeBSD 13 ... but that came out in April 2021, and earlier this\nmonth, the developers released the latest update, FreeBSD 13.3. TrueNAS CORE\n13 users \u2013 including this vulture \u2013 are still waiting for the 13.1 release,\nwhich is still shown as an \"Unstable Build\" on the company's Software Releases\npage, and with nary a hint on the status page.\n\nTrueNAS CORE evolved from the older FreeNAS. FreeNAS first appeared in 2005,\nbased on the m0n0wall firewall with a web GUI written in PHP. Under iXsystems,\nFreeNAS got a whole new UI in version 11, which is still used today. A fork of\nthe original FreeNAS, updated with current FreeBSD components, continues as\nthe XigmaNAS project.\n\nThe creator of PC-BSD, Kris Moore, is still with iXsystems, where he's now\nSenior VP of Engineering. He's also active on Reddit under the handle of\n/u/kmoore134. Back in December, he told the TrueNAS subreddit:\n\nRight now the plan for CORE is to release a 13.1 update in Q1 of 2024. This\nwill be a maintenance-only type update which includes an update to the FreeBSD\nbase, OpenZFS and Samba. No new features expected.\n\nThat's looking dated now. FreeBSD 13.1 came out in May 2022, and reached its\nend of life in July 2023, replaced by FreeBSD 13.2.\n\nMoore continued:\n\nWe have no plans for a FreeBSD 14-based TrueNAS at this time, and the 13.1\nrelease will be a longer-lived maintenance train for those who want to\ncontinue running on the BSD product before migrating to SCALE later at some\nlater date.\n\nThat sounds bad. We asked the company if this was true, and marketing veep\nMario Blandini confirmed it, telling The Reg:\n\nTrueNAS CORE is entering its sustaining engineering phase within the TrueNAS\nproject. TrueNAS SCALE within the TrueNAS project is where new features and\nupdated components are developed and tested. Some of those are eligible for\nbackporting to TrueNAS CORE, and CORE users can migrate to SCALE to take\nadvantage of new features.\n\nThere will be at least one more update to CORE:\n\nNext up for TrueNAS CORE is 13.3, which we can give you some early detail on\nbefore it is released next month, based on FreeBSD 13.3. Among TrueNAS\nfeatures, it will include updates to ZFS as well as an upgrade of Samba to\nversion 4.19, to maintain parity with the next release of SCALE.\n\nThe 13.3 wishlist contains more details of the updates to expect.\n\n  * Fresh version of Windows user-friendly Zorin OS arrives to tempt the Linux-wary\n  * Fedora 41's GNOME to go Wayland-only, says goodbye to X.org\n  * Trying out Microsoft's pre-release OS/2 2.0\n  * Linux for older phones postmarketOS changes its init system\n\nThere is an upgrade path. Because of the way TrueNAS works, the OS is kept on\nits own, dedicated drive \u2013 the company recommends a fast SSD \u2013 that is not\nshared with the network, and indeed cannot be. Thanks to ZFS snapshots, it's\npossible to do an in-place migration, although it's a one-way process. Both\nthe FreeBSD and Linux editions use the same OpenZFS file system so the new OS\ncan pick up and migrate the settings from the old one. What it can't bring\nacross is VM appliances. TrueNAS CORE plugins run in FreeBSD Jails or under\nthe bhyve hypervisor, whereas the VMs you can create in TrueNAS SCALE run\ninside the Linux kernel's KVM. These are not interchangeable.\n\nThis is significant and sad news because iXsystems grew out of the original\nBSD vendor, Berkeley Software Design, Inc., which sold BSD/386, the first\ncommercial BSD-based OS for commodity hardware. We described the early history\nof BSD when we looked at FreeBSD 13.1. The company has a long and complex\nhistory involving multiple mergers, sell-offs, and re-acquisitions, including\nWalnut Creek CD-ROM.\n\nThe Unix market has been turbulent and troubled for many decades, and under\nits various names, the company has a long history of divestments,\nacquisitions, and, indeed, shutting products down. After merging with Walnut\nCreek, it sold off its OS division to Wind River, which then sold off the\nFreeBSD part of the business as the FreeBSD Mall, which iXsystems acquired in\n2007, soon after its 2006 acquisition of PC-BSD, a desktop-focused FreeBSD\ndistro.\n\nIn 2009, the developer of FreeNAS moved on to a Linux-based system, which\ndeveloped into Open Media Vault. iXsystems stepped up and took over FreeNAS\ndevelopment. It also continued work on its desktop version, which in 2016 it\nrenamed TrueOS. In 2020, it discontinued TrueOS, and combined FreeNAS with its\nTrueNAS line.\n\nFor the company, this move doubtless makes sound commercial sense. Although\nThe Reg FOSS desk remains skeptical about whether most of its users actually\nneed Kubernetes, it remains popular and adoption continues to grow. Many\ncompanies have hitched their future to this bandwagon and got rich. For\niXsystems, it seems to us like a small fish choosing to jump into a big pond,\nand we are concerned what might happen if the wave of microservices hype\ncrests and dissipates.\n\nOne of the advantages of FreeNAS was that it was simple and frugal with\nresources. Like XigmaNAS, it installed onto a USB key, meaning that upgrading\nwas as simple as writing a new image to a new key. In our briefings with the\ncompany, we've repeatedly reminded iXsystems of this, and requested the return\nof that feature, but the company's representatives didn't seem to understand\nwhy it was desirable.\n\nEleven years ago, we wrote about how aiming for enterprise customers lost\nNovell its small business heartland. We are concerned that iXsystems risks the\nsame fate.\n\nOne of the problems with ZFS on Linux is that because it's not part of the\nkernel, its cache must remain separate from the Linux kernel's own cache,\nwhich is a key advantage for bcachefs. We have no fewer than three old HP\nMicroservers around, with a grand total of 22 GB of RAM between them. That\nmeans TrueNAS SCALE is little use to us \u2013 and, we suspect, many other small\ndeployments.\n\nThere are already mutterings about a fork, and we will be watching the area\nclosely. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Debian\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Debian\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Fedora\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * GNOME\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Richard Stallman\n  * Software\n\n#### More about\n\n95 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Debian\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Debian\n  * FOSS\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Fedora\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * GNOME\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Richard Stallman\n  * Software\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware7 days | 183\n\n#### Linux Foundation marshals support for open source alternative to Redis\n\nFollows the vendor's decision to overhaul licensing of the popular cache\ndatabase\n\nDatabases8 days | 7\n\n#### Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n\nIn happier news, Ubuntu Pro extended support now goes up to 12 years\n\nSecurity14 days | 18\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Malicious xz backdoor reveals fragility of open source\n\nAnalysis This time, we got lucky.
