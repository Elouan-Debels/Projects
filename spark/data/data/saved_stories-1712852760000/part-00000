That limits their ability to\nreason and plan reliably. It also drives their greediness with data, and even\nthe ethical choices their developers have been making. There will never be\nenough data; there will always be outliers. This is why driverless cars are\nstill just demos, and why LLMs will never be reliable.\n\nI have said this so often in so many ways, going back to 1998, that today I am\ngoing to let someone else, Chomba Bupe, a sharp-thinking tech\nentrepreneur/computer vision researcher from Zambia, take a shot.\n\nAn important new preprint that just came out on data and scaling. Bupe\nexplains it well:\n\nIn short, diminishing returns are what we can expect. (Asterisk: current\nmodels aren\u2019t literally look up tables; they can generalize to some degree,\nbut not enough. As I explained in the 1998 paper and in The Algebraic Mind\nthey can generalize within a space of training examples but face considerable\ntrouble beyond that space.)\n\nSooner or later, the exponential greed for data will exceed what is available.\n\nTo get to AGI, we need alternative approaches that can generalize better\nbeyond the data on which they have been trained. End of story.\n\nGary Marcus looks forward to watching what happens as people begin to take in\nthe implications.\n\n101 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n5 Restacks\n\n101\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Breaking news: Scaling will never get us to AGI\n\ngarymarcus.substack.com\n\n104\n\nShare\n\n104 Comments\n\nEvan CaulkedApr 9we all know that AI is still in the cave\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/18/the-ai-cave/Expand\nfull commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nbenganApr 9I know you\u2019re joking, but even in chaos there is structure.
