That is a big deal because Astera Labs is the incumbent in the\nmarket that Broadcom is trying to match in the PCIe Gen6 era. The difference\nis that Astera Labs appears to be first to silicon and sampling to customers\nto the point that it is also being publicly shown.\n\n## This is the Astera Labs Aries 6 PCIe Gen6 and CXL Retimer\n\nFirst off, a PCIe retimer one can think of, at a very high-level, as a signal\nrepeater. As PCIe generations get faster, PCIe over PCB trace lengths have\ndecreased substantially. At the same time, systems have gotten physically\nlarger. As a result, PCIe has to go further, but the actual reach is shorter,\nhence the need for retimers. Here is a great example of the Astera Labs PCIe\nretimers in an NVIDIA AI server.\n\nAstera Labs Aries PCIe Retimer On HGX Board 2\n\nThe actual retimers are not the highest power, and certainly not the most\nexpensive parts of the chassis, but there are quite a few of them. Astera Labs\nhas its own format for a retimer and as you can see the Aries 6 for the PCIe\nGen6 / CXL era looks very similar to the Aries 5 part that is shipping in\nvolume today.\n\nAstera Labs Aries 6 PCIe Retimer Next To Aries 5\n\nWe also got to see the development board. One can see the connectors on the\ntop and bottom and the Aries 6 retimer in the middle. This allows the company\nto test different combinations of endpoints in an interoperability lab but\nalso for customers to test their next-gen hardware designs.\n\nAstera Labs Aries 6 PCIe Retimer Development Board\n\nHere is a demo of the card running on the show floor.\n\nAstera Labs Aries 6 PCIe Retimer Interop Lab\n\nAt GTC 2024, the Aries 6 was linked at PCIe Gen6 x16 speeds at 10-11W of power\nconsumption. That is a big deal since it is lower than Broadcom is claiming\nwith its new retimers.\n\nAstera Labs Aries 6 PCIe Retimer Power Consumption\n\nWe also covered Astera Labs COSMOS. Here is the telemetry and we can see it\nrunning at 11W.\n\nAstera Labs COSMOS\n\nThat was the first time we have seen that running.\n\n## Bonus Astera Labs Aurora A1000 Leo CXL Card\n\nWe also saw an Aurora A1000 CXL card. If you have seen one of our recent\nvideos over the last year or so, there was an older version of the card on the\nset just as something cool. These cards take a PCIe Gen5 x16 slot, and occupy\na double-width slot, but they have a cool trick. One can add memory to this\ncard, put it into an AMD EPYC Genoa/ Bergamo server or a 5th Gen Intel Xeon\nEmerald Rapids server, and expand the amount of RAM in the system as well as\nadd additional memory bandwidth with each CXL card added.\n\nAstera Labs Leo CXL Smart Memory Controller\n\nNow, there is a version with new firmware, and we will be showing that off\nsoon.\n\n## Final Words\n\nOverall, this is a great update. The PCIe retimers may not sound the most\nexciting, but consider this, Astera Labs had its IPO a few weeks ago and has a\n~$10.5B market cap. The parts may not be as exciting as AI accelerators, but\nthey seem to be useful.\n\nSince we got a lot of requests for consulting calls on the PCIe retimer market\nafter our previous pieces, and with the company\u2019s IPO, we have an Axautik\nGroup LLC Research Short for the Astera Labs and Broadcom releases to answer\nsome of the common questions we have gotten from folks on the investing side.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * Astera Labs\n  * Broadcom\n  * GTC\n  * NVIDIA\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedin\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nCopy URL\n\nPrevious articleIntel Foundry Operating Model Shown with Path to Process\nLeadership\n\nNext articleASRock Rack MECAI-GH200 Short-Depth NVIDIA Grace Hopper Server\n\nCliff Robinson\n\nThey call me \"the STH news guy\" for a reason.\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### Gigabyte Shows Axiado BMC for NVIDIA MGX Systems\n\n### AMD Infinity Fabric AFL Scale Up Competitor to NVIDIA NVLink Coming to\nBroadcom Switches in PCIe Gen7\n\n### Broadcom Fires a Shot at Astera Labs with New PCIe and CXL Retimers\n\n#### 3 COMMENTS\n\n  1. Aaron Newsome April 4, 2024 At 1:16 pm\n\nI absolutely *love* STH and all the free content you provide. Patrick is also\na hoot to watch in the YouTube videos, as evidenced by many appearances in my\nviewing history. So don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but, how in the world does\na CXL retimer fit into the home lab storyline. I mean, is this something\npeople are doing in their home labs? If so, I need to step my game up (and get\nanother job or two).\n\n  2. Patrick Kennedy April 4, 2024 At 8:39 pm\n\nAaron \u2013 why is STH only home lab in your mind? We were doing blade system\nreviews 8 years ago and 8x GPU AI server reviews 7 years ago. It is very\nstrange to hear? It would be like asking why does the Wall Street Journal not\nonly report about a single road in NYC.\n\n  3. Aaron Newsome April 8, 2024 At 7:02 pm\n\nAll in jest Patrick. I\u2019ve been spending a lot more time on STH as I rebuild my\nhomelab, using bits and pieces us mere mortals can afford, of course. I can\ndig these reviews of drool-worthy equipment I\u2019ll never be able to afford, so\nplease keep em coming. I really do appreciate everything you all do over\nthere.\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
