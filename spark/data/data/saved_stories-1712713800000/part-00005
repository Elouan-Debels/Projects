Most of us know these\ntransmitters as the first radio systems, and from there we\u2019ll probably also\nknow that they were phased out when better circuits arrived, because of their\nwide bandwidth. So it\u2019s rare in 2024 to find anyone characterizing a spark gap\ntransmitter, as [Baltic Lab] has.\n\nThe circuit is simple enough, a high voltage passes through an RC network to a\nspark gap, the other side of which is a tuned circuit. The RC network and the\nspark gap form a simple low frequency relaxation oscillator, with the C being\ncharged until the spark gap triggers, forcing the subsequent discharge of the\ncapacitor and causing the spark to extinguish and the cycle to repeat. The\nresulting chain of high voltage pulses repeatedly energizes the tuned circuit,\nwith each pulse causing a damped oscillation at its resonant frequency. The\nresulting RF signal is a crude AM tone which can be received fairly simply.\n\nThe mathematics behind it all is pretty interesting, revealing both the cause\nof the bandwidth spread in the low Q factor of the tuned circuit, and the\npresence of a large spurious frequency spike on an interaction with the\ncapacitor in the RC circuit. It\u2019s all in the video below the break, and we\nhave to admit, it taught us something about radio we didn\u2019t know.\n\nMeanwhile spark gaps weren\u2019t the only early radio transmitter technology. How\nabout an alternator?\n\nPosted in Radio HacksTagged early radio, spark gap transmitter\n\n## 29 thoughts on \u201cA Spark Gap Transmitter, Characterized\u201d\n\n  1.

I used window glass and aluminum foil taped on both sides to make\nthe capacitor, no antenna. Spark gap was a couple of wires. Made a lot of\naudio noise and radio noise, the parents thought I\u2019d killed myself.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  2.

Spark gap transmitters are illegal. Big problems if\nyou are found using one. Harmonics even dampened harmonics are a big problem.\nModern radios has excellent receivers. They hear it all. Hence the problem.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Dan says:\n\nApril 8, 2024 at 4:40 am\n\nAre they illegal everywhere or just in certain jurisdictions?

Look up Radio\nCaroline for an example, but there are many others. The UK government couldn\u2019t\nlegally do anything to the boat or the transmission, so they made it illegal\nfor people in the UK to listen to it!\n\nReport comment\n\n          2.

Pirate radios didn\u2019t get treated with armed forces (in\nthe west atleast) because it was ultimately a civil issue, operating a jammer\nnear territorial waters might get a different response. (Some states probably\nreserve the right to arrest their citizens in international waters for\nbreaking the laws of the state as well)\n\nReport comment\n\n    2.

Sebastian says:\n\nApril 8, 2024 at 6:06 am\n\nThat international agreement, however, is not a legal basis for national\nenforcement. Neither the FCC nor our German equivalent, the BNetzA can enforce\nsuch treaties without ratification into local law. That\u2019s why the FCC\nspecifically mentiones damped wave transmitters as illegal. The BNetzA,\nhowever does not have such equivalents. Possibly indirectly due to the\nspecified spectral purity requirements. But that\u2019s fairly irrelevant for low\npower, local experiments. So assuming that it is \u201cpretty much outlawed in\nevery country on the planet\u201d, just because countries signalled in an\ninternational agreement their intention to ratify such restrictions into local\nlaw, is far from the truth. That said, even if that would be illegal, I\npersonally don\u2019t care. In Germany the harshest enforcement the BNetzA could\nlevish onto me would be the seizure of the transmitter and a fine somewhere\naround 100 \u20ac. I think I\u2019ll be fine with that.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n          1.

Laurens Visser says:\n\nApril 8, 2024 at 6:56 am\n\nModern radios have a much better selectivity and pulse noise suppression than\nthe old ones. You need very wide receivers to make the best of a spark signal.\nIf the spark signal is 45khz wide (realistic, when you operate at 500khz) and\nyour receiver is has a 1khz CW filter, you\u2019ll only receive a fraction of the\npower that\u2019s in the airwaves. You can find out information with regards to\nbandwidths in old 1920s books.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    7. cplamb says:\n\nApril 8, 2024 at 7:21 am\n\nWhat if it were operated inside of a Faraday cage?\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    8.

We are\nhackers, makers, engineers... we don\u2019t care about written statues, we want\nreasoning, there are very good reasons not to use spark gap transmitters, lead\nwith those reasons.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    9.
