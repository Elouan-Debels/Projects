It will enforce the guidelines outlined in the community\nRuby Style Guide.\n\nIt helps developers in ensuring adherence to coding style standards,\nidentifying potential code flaws, and enhancing the overall quality of the\ncodebase. In addition to identifying code problems, RuboCop also automatically\ncorrects those issues.\n\nDevelopers can adjust rules defined by Rubocop to match project coding\nstandards.\n\n# Before Rails 8.0\n\nBefore Rails 8 we had to manually integrate Rubocop gem to our project.\n\nWe can simply install it like below.\n\n    \n    \n    gem install rubocop\n\nor we can add it to the gemfile of the project.\n\n    \n    \n    gem 'rubocop', require: false\n\nThe behavior of RuboCop can be controlled via the .rubocop.yml configuration\nfile. We can create this file manually and we can put it in the root of our\nproject folder.\n\nOr we can run the below command that will automatically create the rubocop.yml\nand rubocop.todo.yml file. It is a good idea to use the command below if our\ncodebase has an overwhelming number of offenses.\n\n    \n    \n    rubocop --auto-gen-config\n\nAll the rules related to code formatting will be defined in the .rubocop.yml\nfile. The Basic structure of the file will look like below.\n\n    \n    \n    inherit_from: ../.rubocop.yml Style/Encoding: Enabled: false Layout/LineLength: Max: 99\n\nNow we can run bundle exec rubocop to check the issues with our codebase and\nbundle exec rubocop -a will automatically correct the offenses.\n\n# In Rails 8.0\n\nNow Rails 8 comes with rubocop gem by default. It enforces rules from rubocop-\nrails-omakase by default.\n\nThe rubocop-rails-omakase is an extension of RuboCop specifically tailored for\nRuby on Rails applications. It includes additional rules and configurations\nthat are relevant and specific to Rails development\n\nIf we don\u2019t want rubocop gem in our Rails application, we can skip it by\npassing --skip-rubocop flag.\n\nTo know more about this please check this PR.\n\nShare this post!\n\nNeed help on your Ruby on Rails or React project?\n\nBOOK A CALL\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might also like:\n\n#### The Ultimate Guide to Gemfile and Gemfile.lock\n\nAugust 16, 2022\n\n#### Integrate OpenAI API in Ruby applications\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\n#### Integrate Replicate in Rails Application\n\nJuly 28, 2023\n\nThanks!
