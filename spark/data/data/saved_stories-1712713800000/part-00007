The NAIA is\nthe governing body that runs college athletics' second tier, overseeing some\n83,000 athletes across 241 schools. Per the policy it adopted on Monday in the\nname of \"fair and safe competition opportunities for all student-athletes,\"\ntrans women will be banned from competition effective Aug. 1, and anyone who\nbegins hormone therapy will have to let the national NAIA office know and will\nbe allowed to practice with their team but cannot compete.\n\nThe dehumanizing language in the policy, along with its insistence on defining\nbiological sex and requirement that any transitioning athletes alert a central\noffice, gives the game away that this is a culture war rear-guard action\nrather than anything having to do with fairness in sports. Even more, it\ncontinues in the tradition of recent anti-trans legislation that provides\ncover to the TERFy notion of exclusively protecting young girls; under the\nNAIA policy, \"All eligible NAIA student-athletes may participate in NAIA-\nsponsored male sports,\" with no specific carveout for an athlete who\ntransitions to male. Nobody knows whether there are any trans athletes\ncompeting at the NAIA level, nor is the impetus for the new policy any actual\nevents taking place in any actual competitions. The NAIA formed what it called\nthe Transgender Task Force in April 2022, days after Penn swimmer Lia Thomas\nwon a gold medal at the 2022 NCAA Swimming Championships. Seventy-five percent\nof NAIA schools are private, and just over half (125 of 241) have a religious\naffiliation. Of the 20 people who voted in favor of the policy, 17 represent\nreligious institutions.\n\nAlready a user?Log in\n\n## Welcome to Defector!\n\n### Register or sign in to continue reading.\n\nOr, click here to subscribe!\n\nIf you liked this blog, please share it!
