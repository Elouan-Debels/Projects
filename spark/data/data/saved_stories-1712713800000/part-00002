If I say: \u201cGood morning\u201d, content-wise I\ncommunicate my intention to greet, but speech-act-wise I promise that I speak\nEnglish. If I say \u201cPK\u2665\u2666\u201d, I state the fact that I can be understood in the\nformal language of a zip file.\n\nAnd when I say \"Ein Milchkaffee, bitte\" here in Berlin, I imply that I will be\nable to handle a follow-up question in German. If my bluff is called and I\ncan\u2019t deliver, it\u2019s a disappointing day for all the involved parties;\ndisappointing enough that any hint of an accent or awkwardness of delivery is\nenough for many a local barista to switch immediately to English. Language\nlearners hate this, but we also try to be conscious of the fact that no one\nwants to be an unpaid language tutor.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this a little. An exchange of such messages is not completely\nfree, and the transaction costs are high enough to make failed communication\nfrustrating. The proposed language of communication is a promise to handle\nwhatever semantics the language can express; it\u2019s a bad situation when it\u2019s a\nbluff that was called.\n\nNow if I craft a complex sentence for you to handle, and you completely fail\nat understanding it, it\u2019s annoying. If you know you don\u2019t understand it, at\nleast it\u2019s something to work with. But if you grossly simplify it,\nmisunderstand it stupidly, and still pretend that you completely understood\nit, that\u2019s a communication disaster that sometimes takes a lot of patience to\nuntangle.\n\nWe could distinguish between the German language proper, and the Tourist one\n(actually, it\u2019s maybe more often expats, but \u201ctourist\u201d is the derogatory of\nchoice for us anyway). Tourist is a subset of the German language that the\nparticular tourist/expat understands; those subsets are quite similar among\ntourists (and expats) with a lot of memes enumerating the precise sets of\nphrases.\n\nSo there\u2019s a choice for both parties between trying (and perhaps bluffing) to\nuse German, or \u201csimply\u201d using English or some kind of German-like baby-talk.\nThis game has two equilibria: either the expats aspire to speak real German\n(and painfully fail at that for many years), or everyone immediately switches\nto some kind of a terrible common denominator German-English for interactions\nwith people they don\u2019t know. Now, in many cases the second outcome seems\nunpalatable: I read a story once about Quebec(?) trying to avoid it by fiat (I\ncan\u2019t find the eloquent source). In Berlin, I think it\u2019s more of a question of\netiquette, enforced by the locals being both very reluctant to speak English\nand quite demanding of one\u2019s German.\n\nThis might be the better equilibrium (thanks @berlinauslandermemes)\n\nLet\u2019s talk now about the natural language interfaces. Remember when you tried\nSiri, and you almost immediately realized it doesn\u2019t really understand\nEnglish? It guesses things with a recognizable predefined grammar, but can\u2019t\nhandle much more. Siri\u2019s is not so much a \u201cNatural Language\u201d interface, but a\n\u201cSmall Subset of English\u201d one. If one\u2019s patient enough to learn this sub-\nlanguage, one adapts to this small subset, learns the few sentences that Siri\ncan understand, and avoids the rest. The visceral aversion to further\ncommunication failures makes any incremental improvements of Siri much harder\nto adopt.\n\nChatGPT, of course, is a different beast. It does seem to understand the\nlanguage quite well, as long as you\u2019re simply chatting with it. The problem,\nhowever, is when it is integrated as an interface to another system. We see a\nlot of systems being built with a chat interface, that is supposed to be\nfluent and comfortable. But those systems can\u2019t actually handle everything\nChatGPT can figure out for them. ChatGPT parses the requests alright, but\nthere are simply not enough APIs, or a massive mismatch of the execution\nmodel, to express this formally in the system\u2019s language.\n\nNatural Language Interface is a huge promise to understand, and handle,\nwhatever can be expressed in natural language. It\u2019s often not more than a\nbluff. And if the user calls it, he knows that there\u2019s no \u201cnatural language\u201d\nat play here, and he would have to learn the actual sub-language of the system\nto be able to use it productively.\n\nIt is quite often not worth it for the user to learn this sub-language. Not\nonly it\u2019s inferior and a bit annoying to learn, but it\u2019s also most of the time\nvery badly defined. It\u2019s undefined because the developers (or rather, the\nproduct people who order them around) are often in denial about even the\nexistence of this sub-language. And because of that, the sub-language changes\na lot without any advance warning1 or, in some cases, even any control from\nthe developers themselves.\n\nAnd the worst of it is that an AI interface often can\u2019t even recognize, or is\nprogrammed to not recognize, the situation when it can\u2019t actually fully and\ncompletely \u201cunderstand\u201d, or effectively execute, a complex request. Such\nsituations make those interfaces inherently untrustworthy and hard to steer,\nbecause often you\u2019re not completely aware of the gross simplification that is\nhappening, or have no clear means to fix it. Avoiding a situation like this is\nthe reason, I believe, many people reach for a normal, traditional UI when\nthey have an important and non-trivial task.\n\nSalami\u2019s bet is that Natural Language Interfaces are all-or-nothing, and it\u2019s\nnot enough to simply throw badly done \u201cfunction-calling\u201d at an LLM to match\nthe expected semantics. We want to go against the dystopia of weak pseudo-\nnatural sub-languages and make sure the largest possible expressible space is\navailable to the users.\n\n1\n\nOnce I learned to shut up Alexa\u2019s timer using \u201cThank you\u201d and used the timer a\nlot. It was an interesting example of performativity of language. Then they\nchanged the thank-you handler to respond politely and keep the timer\nscreaming. I figured out I could just say \u201cAlexa, shut up\u201d, but I don\u2019t really\nwant to, so I ended up not using it at all anymore\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The game of semantic promises (Or, why you are not using Siri)\n\nsalamilang.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nSalami: Designing a runtime for AI-generated code\n\nThe vision for the next step in running AI-generated code, integrated with our\napps, for our users' commands.\n\nFeb 10\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Salami: Designing a runtime for AI-generated code\n\nsalamilang.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Valentin Golev\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
