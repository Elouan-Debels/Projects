Specifically, I started\nFramework to build products that last longer by making them easy to repair and\nupgrade. We're just over three years in, and making great progress!\n\n### What hardware do you use?\n\nThis is an easy one. I use hardware that we make. Usually, I'm dogfooding\nwhichever product we're going to launch next. Currently, I'm switching back\nand forth between a Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series) and a\nFramework Laptop 16.\n\nAside from laptops, I currently use an iPhone 12 that has at least one repair\nusing replacement parts from iFixit. I spent three years as an Engineer at\nApple, so I'm stuck on iPhones by habit. I started and led the hardware team\nat Oculus. Oculus Quest 2 was the last product I led the architecture of\nbefore leaving to start Framework, and that is another device I use regularly.\nMy current favorite headphones are Bushmills x Grado, made from old whisky\nbarrels.\n\nApart from gadgets, there are some hardware tools I like and use regularly.\nMitutoyo calipers, a Fluke multimeter, a dirt cheap Rigol oscilloscope, a Pace\nsoldering station, and a Prusa MK3 3D printer.\n\n### And what software?\n\nCurrently, I'm mostly using software that doesn't bring me joy. Because most\nof the engineers in Framework run Ubuntu, Fedora, or NixOS, I'm doing my\ndogfooding on Windows 11. I spend most of my time in various parts of Google\nWorkspace these days, but occasionally I get to have fun in OpenSCAD and KiCAD\nmaking open source hardware reference designs for modules.\n\n### What would be your dream setup?\n\nI'm fortunate to be in a position where it doesn't have to be a dream! We\nstarted with laptops, but our vision is to bring this mission to all of\nconsumer electronics, one category at a time. I can't share what those are\njust yet, but you can imagine some of the categories I mentioned in the second\nquestion being there.\n\nYou can keep track of new interviews by subscribing to the feed.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, everything is available via the Attribution-Share\nAlike licence.\n\nLast updated March 29, 2024.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
