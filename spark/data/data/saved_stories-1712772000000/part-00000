At the age\nof 12, he\u2019s probably the youngest photo journalist in South Vietnam. For two\nyears now he has been helping his father, a veteran freelance photographer,\ncover the dramatic and sometimes violent events of this war torn city.\n(Bettmann/CORBIS)  \n---  \n  \nWhile other youngsters flee danger, he looks for it. He is a professional\nphotographer and he has a thick stack of published pictures to prove it.\n\nNot much taller than four feet and only a smidgin over 60 pounds, bright eyed\nLo Manh Hung wears his cameras like a badge.\n\nHe has been taking pictures professionally more than two years, since his\nlocally well known father, Lo Vinh, was injured covering street rioting and\nneeded help in his work.\n\nWith the father, who is 58 years old, the pair form a team boasting Saigon\u2019s\noldest and youngest working photographers. The father, a cameraman for 44\nyears, was born in North Vietnam, studied art and literature at a French\nuniversity, but turned to his hobby of photography for income when times got\ntough.\n\nFor years he traveled, taking pictures throughout Indochina, and didn\u2019t marry\nuntil he was 43. A few months later he and his bride fled the Communists in\nthe North and came to Saigon.\n\nLo Manh Hung and his father arise everyday at 5am. To be early on the job and\nusually don\u2019t finish until after 9pm.That\u2019s 365 days a year, the father sighs.\n\nIn less hectic times, the pair scoot about the city on a motorbike to cover\nofficial government affairs, weddings, airport arrivals, parties, fires,\nwhatever may make news.\n\nLo Manh Hung helps with the film processing and printing, then turns messenger\nsalesman, pedding fresh prints to local newspapers and foreign news agencies.\n\nHis small, slim frame and child\u2019s face are both the hindrance and help in his\nwork.\n\nPolice invariably stop him as he tries to pass through official gates,\ndemanding \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d\n\nHe explains calmly he is the son of photographer Lo Vinh, produces his\ncredentials and cameras, and usually continues on his way.\n\nBut not always - and that, he says, is his biggest problem: convincing police\nhe really is a working news photographer.\n\nThe advantage of his size has been seen often by the Saigon press corps. As\nphotographers jam together, elbowing, pushing, clawing for the right picture\nangle of an arriving dignitary or a crowded news conference, who squirms\nthrough? Lo Manh Hung.\n\nHe snakes through a crowd on all fours, emerges in the front of the lot and\nclicks happily away with the best angle of all. He is so short he never blocks\nthose behind and they let him be.\n\n(The Southeast Missourian Feb 14 1968: Boy Photographer Seeks Danger as Others\nFlee - John Nance)\n\n## You might also like:\n\n17-Year-Old Eric Clapton Performing With His First Band, The Roosters in 1963\n\n25 Fascinating Vintage Portraits of Eric Clapton With His Curly Hair in 1967\n\nWonderful Photos of Yosemite National Park in the Late 1960s\n\n50 Candid Photographs From The Beatles\u2019 \u201cSgt.
