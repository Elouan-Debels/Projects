And yet, to a big extent, it\u2019s a\nmyth.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll unpack the fundamental problem of shared team ownership\nand what you might actually achieve instead.\n\n## The problem with shared team ownership\n\nIf it\u2019s everyone\u2019s, it\u2019s no one\u2019s. And you can\u2019t blame the team for that.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: if there is something you want the team to own, and say you\nhave a 10-person team, what\u2019s the actual incentive and motivation for any\nindividual to truly care about it?\n\nThere\u2019s none.\n\nInitially, this flustered me, as it does most inexperienced product managers.\n\nI was doing all I could to support shared team ownership; I tried coaching,\ngiving lessons, sharing inspiring TED Talks, and even having frequent one-on-\nones on the topic.\n\nYet it never stuck.\n\nI was quietly dreaming about the \u201cperfect team.\u201d A team that is mature enough\nto start collectively on its own problems and drive initiatives. I\nsubconsciously thought it was a people problem \u2014 that these people simply\nweren\u2019t mature enough in the industry to approach it \u201cthe right way.\u201d\n\n## Over 200k developers and product managers use LogRocket to create better\ndigital experiences\n\nLearn more \u2192\n\nBut then the team\u2019s delivery manager opened my eyes. It started with this\nsimple, yet revealing phrase:\n\n> \u201cIf it\u2019s everyone\u2019s, it\u2019s no one\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not about finding a team of A-players with a high agency over customer\nproblems, initiatives at hand, or team challenges. It\u2019s an accountability\nproblem. See, we, as product managers, have a wide range of accountabilities\nwhen it comes to delivering great products. As much as we might want to fight\nthe system and drive an organizational culture change, the fact is each\nprofessional in the team is ultimately judged by their individual\naccountabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example of your QA engineer. Imagine they have a performance\nreview talk with their domain manager.\n\nWhich statement do you think will be more impactful on their career\nprogression?\n\n  1. \u201cIn the last quarter, I managed to spot the majority of issues before greenlighting them for a release, and as a result, we had zero critical issues on production and maintained our company quality standards with each release.\u201d\n  2. \u201cAlthough the production exploded three times under my watch, thanks to my contribution we managed to find a solution for customer X\u2019s problem with low technical effort!\u201d\n\nWhether we like it or not, the first statement would probably lead to a raise,\nwhile the latter might put this QA on a performance improvement plan.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s better to take \u201cshared consequences\u201d as a team for\nnot delivering a team-owned initiative than to underperform in the area you\nare strictly accountable for.\n\n## The solution: Individual accountabilities\n\nIf team ownership doesn\u2019t exist, it doesn\u2019t mean that you must be a one-person\narmy constantly worrying about timelines, problem resolution, each\ninitiative\u2019s progress, next retrospective effectiveness, and so on.\n\nBut at the same time, you can\u2019t just \u201cgive it to the team\u201d and forget about it\njust like many product gurus tell you to.\n\n### More great articles from LogRocket:\n\n  * How to implement issue management to improve your product\n  * 8 ways to reduce cycle time and build a better product\n  * What is a PERT chart and how to make one\n  * Discover how to use behavioral analytics to create a great product experience\n  * Explore six tried and true product management frameworks you should know\n  * Advisory boards aren\u2019t just for executives.

You\u2019ll help inform the type of content we create and get access to exclusive meetups, social accreditation, and swag.\n\nWhen you need your team to handle something, you need to leave product\nmeetings knowing which individuals will be accountable for driving the\nresults.\n\nI don\u2019t mean a person that\u2019ll solve the problem alone. I mean a designated\nperson whose responsibility will be to ask for help, drive other team members,\nand escalate if something goes off track.\n\nOne person who\u2019ll have mental ownership over a particular topic. Something\nthat\u2019s simply impossible to build collectively since, as I already mentioned\ntwice, if it\u2019s everyone\u2019s, it\u2019s no one\u2019s.\n\nWork with domain managers and team leads to include this in performance\nreviews. Not to use it as a threat, but to incentivize people to contribute to\ninitiatives outside of their domain work. And if they deliver, do everything\nyou can to ensure these people are praised and rewarded for it.\n\n## Practical examples of individual accountabilities\n\nI\u2019ve been exploring various ways and approaches to build individual\naccountabilities in recent months.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nThere was simply too much on my plate to have mental ownership over everything\nand just leaving this with the team never worked.\n\nHere are three approaches that worked best so far:\n\n  * Sprint roles\n  * Feature owners\n  * Problem owners\n\n### Sprint roles\n\nRepetitive things need to be taken care of every single sprint. Examples\ninclude:\n\n  * Facilitating a retrospective and ensuring the team gets something out of it\n  * Organizing and hosting team review\n  * Facilitating the planning sessions\n  * Ensuring sprint goal achievement and reacting if it\u2019s off-track\n\nI\u2019ve seen many product managers who try to do it all themselves, often\nresulting in too little time for actual product work and quick burnout.\n\nThe solution? Sprint roles!\n\nWe\u2019ve mapped every recurring thing that needs to be taken care of and every\nsprint after the review, we collectively discuss and assign specific\naccountabilities to specific people.\n\n### Feature owners\n\nThere\u2019s a set of things that need to be taken care of for every new\ninitiative, such as\n\n  * Keeping track of the deadline\n  * Ensuring everything is documented properly\n  * Coordinating with other teams and taking care of dependencies\n\nWhenever we start a new initiative, we designate a feature owner who will be\naccountable for all initiative-related activities.\n\nAgain, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a one-man army doing everything. The beauty of\nhaving rotating feature owners for different initiatives is that team members\nhelp each other because they know they\u2019ll be feature owners at some point and\nwill need the support themselves.\n\nIt incentivizes not only the feature owner to think about the initiative and\noversee it but also incentivizes other team members to support the feature\nowner with everything.\n\n### Problem owners\n\nProblem owners work on the same principles as feature owners. What\u2019s different\nis the nature of the owned item.\n\nSay there\u2019s a repetitive problem within the team. For example, you constantly\nstruggle to cooperate with the localization team, often leading to delayed\ntranslations and releases.\n\nThe feature owner is the person who takes mental ownership of the topic. They\nproactively work towards solving the issue, engage other people, communicate\ncross-team, and also keep the product manager accountable for their part.\n\nYes, problem owners and feature owners often ping me if I slack off. I still\nhave my part to do in these things, but I don\u2019t have to \u201cmentally own\u201d\neverything. I don\u2019t have this feeling of stress \u201cif we get thing X done on\ntime\u201d because I know there\u2019s someone else already worrying about it.\n\n## Closing remarks\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure one of the main reasons why burnouts are so common in the\nproduct management world is that PMs have to own numerous initiatives,\nproblems, and processes mentally.\n\nIt\u2019s practically impossible.\n\nOn the other hand, delegating this work to a team also doesn\u2019t work.\n\nLet me be clear. The team should own initiatives, customer problems,\nprocesses, and challenges. But, it only works if a specific team member is\naccountable for driving results.\n\nDon\u2019t leave problems \u201cwith the team.\u201d Instead, make sure each issue is taken\ncare of by a specific person who\u2019s aware it\u2019s their job to take care of it.\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard, just ask the question, \u201cwho is going to take ownership of\nthis one?\u201d If it\u2019s quiet, just wait. It might take ten seconds or two minutes,\nbut someone will pick it up.\n\nOver time, the team will be more courageous to pick up topics. The team can\neffectively own problems, initiatives, and challenges. But shared ownership\ndoesn\u2019t work.\n\nFeatured image source: IconScout\n\n## LogRocket generates product insights that lead to meaningful action\n\nLogRocket identifies friction points in the user experience so you can make\ninformed decisions about product and design changes that must happen to hit\nyour goals.\n\nWith LogRocket, you can understand the scope of the issues affecting your\nproduct and prioritize the changes that need to be made.
