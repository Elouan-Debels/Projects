It is a cornerstone of the free and open source software (FOSS)\necosystem, as GNOME is home to many critical infrastructure libraries and\ntools, used by countless users and developers worldwide. GNOME provides one of\nthe most popular desktop environments used on the Linux operating system and\nincludes a cohesive desktop environment, core applications, a design system, a\nplatform to build third-party applications, and low-level Linux desktop\ncomponents. GNOME also provides developer tools used by an ecosystem of\nhundreds of third-party applications built on the platform toolkit and design\npatterns.\n\nGNOME integrates deeply with the Linux operating system, leveraging its core\ncomponents and functionalities to provide a complete desktop environment. It\ninteracts with various Linux subsystems, such as display management, input\nhandling, and system configuration, to deliver a seamless user experience.\nGNOME is included as default desktop environment included in many Linux\ndistributions.\n\n## Why is this important?\n\nThe control of platforms and operating systems is increasingly a security,\nsovereignty, and resilience concern. In this context, it's essential to have\nan operating system not controlled by a single private company, as is the case\nfor Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. GNOME is the largest and most complete\nfully-independent free desktop stack. This investment in the GNOME project\nincreases the stability and security of the FOSS ecosystem and contributes to\nthe long-term sustainability of a vital component of independent computing\ninfrastructure.\n\nIt enhances the competitiveness of an independent and community-driven\ncomputing ecosystem amidst a landscape dominated by proprietary solutions.\nSupporting the continued improvement of the GNOME desktop environment\ncontributes to maintaining diversity and choice in operating systems and\npromotes user autonomy.\n\nGNOME-based Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, Tails,\nand others are extremely common in industry, enterprise, academia, and\ngovernments around the world. Many other projects build on GNOME technology,\nincluding Linux desktop environments like Pantheon, XFCE, or Cinnamon, and an\nentire ecosystem of apps using GTK, a cross-platform widget toolkit for\ncreating graphical user interfaces. Some case studies:\n\n  * Volkswagen uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n  * The Barcelona public administration uses Ubuntu\n  * The French Gendarmerie uses Ubuntu\n\nThe GNOME project has long played a pivotal role in the free software\necosystem as a pioneer and R&D lab for foundational technologies used by the\nfree desktops in particular and Linux as a whole (for example, DBus, Flatpak,\nand Wayland). Current efforts such as the new accessibility architecture and\nhome directory encryption continue this tradition.\n\nWork on the GNOME platform directly supports Linux applications like Firefox,\nOBS Studio, and Inkscape, which have are using the platform APIs GNOME\nprovides. Accessibility improvements benefit the entire Linux desktop.\nSecurity tracking infrastructure will be usable by KDE and other projects for\ntheir own SDKs (software development kits). GLib is a fundamental C library\nwidely used outside of GNOME/GTK.\n\n## What are we funding?\n\nThe GNOME community has developed a comprehensive plan to modernize the\nplatform, enhance tooling and accessibility, and support features that are in\nthe public interest. These milestones collectively address critical areas such\nas security, accessibility, hardware support, and developer tooling,\nfortifying the GNOME ecosystem.\n\n  1. Encrypt User Home Directories Individually: Implementation of systemd-homed backend to encrypt user home directories, bolstering security measures.\n  2. Increase Range and Quality of Hardware Support: Optimization of GNOME desktop for diverse input methods and display devices, along with performance improvements.\n  3. Modernize Platform Infrastructure: Refinement of desktop notifications API and modernization of GTK CSS engine, among other platform updates.\n  4. Improve Quality Assurance and Development Tooling: Enhancement of GNOME OS and related tooling to facilitate continuous integration testing and streamline development processes.\n  5. Improve State and Compatibility of Accessibility: Overhaul of accessibility stack to ensure compatibility with modern technologies such as Wayland and Flatpak, along with advocacy for accessibility integration in software development practices.\n  6. Design a New Accessibility Stack for Linux Desktop: Creation of new accessibility protocols to replace outdated components, promoting compatibility with sandboxed applications and modern security standards.\n  7. Maintenance and Modernization of Security Components: Upgrading and maintenance of security-related components like Seahorse, Keyring, and libsecret, incorporating essential security features and enhancements.\n  8. Secure APIs for Wayland/Flatpak: Development of secure APIs for accessing resources and user data in Wayland and sandboxed applications, ensuring robust security measures for the Linux desktop environment.\n\n## More technologies\n\nAll technologies\n\n  * ### Bundler & RubyGems (2022)\n\n#### Package management for a popular programming language\n\nLearn more\n\n  * ### OpenJS Foundation\n\n#### Improving Javascript ecosystem infrastructure and security\n\nLearn more\n\n  * ### Pendulum\n\n#### Providing accurate time on millions of devices and networks fundamental\nto the internet and other critical infrastructure.\n\nLearn more\n\n  * ### Fortran\n\n#### Modernizing an established programming language to become more performant\nand user-friendly for scientific communities\n\nLearn more\n\n  * ### RubyGems & Bundler (2023)\n\n#### Package management for Ruby, a popular programming language\n\nLearn more\n\n  * ### curl\n\n#### Powering data transfers\n\nLearn more\n\ninfo@sovereigntechfund.de\n\nMastodon for STF LinkedIn for STF Twitter for STF Bsky for STF Rss for STF\n\nSupported by\n\nThe Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation\n\n", "frontpage": false}
