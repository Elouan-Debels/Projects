Yet, economic relations have always been\nstrong, with a degree of dependence of Japanese firms on China, and a Chinese\nreliance on Japan\u2019s market as well.\n\nNot so with India. Flashes of actual conflict have happened, none as\nprotracted as the triple challenge from China over Ladakh, Sikkim, and,\nindirectly, Arunachal Pradesh, since 2020. Soldiers from both sides have died\nin combat. China has built a network of bunkers, tunnels and fortified\nvillages. India has mobilized 100,000 soldiers close to the front line and\nworked on its own logistical infrastructure.\n\nEven a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Arunachal Pradesh, a region\nthat has been India\u2019s since the British drew up the McMahon line in 1914, is\nenough to incur the ire of the Chinese government. Beijing always reminds\nIndia that it claims the state as Chinese land, as successive governments in\nBeijing never accepted the 1914 delimitation.\n\nTherefore, this is at best a hot peace. India\u2019s public opinion has gone the\nway of Japan\u2019s, and New Delhi has increasingly turned westward \u2013 toward the\nUnited States, France, and others such as Israel \u2013 to supplement its aging\nRussian armament connection.\n\nYet, relations between China and India have never completely broken down.\nCertainly, India has taken steps to limit the China risk in its infrastructure\nand society \u2013 banning China from ports and rail construction, prohibiting\nChinese apps, keeping Chinese telecoms out of Indian procurement, and\nrebuffing plans for massive BYD and Great Wall Motors automobile investments.\nThis does not apply, however, to the overall trade and investment\nrelationship.\n\nBilateral trade passed $136 billion in the fiscal year ending on March 31,\n2022, with a huge and rising deficit of $100 billion for India. In fact,\nIndian exports crashed while China\u2019s sales to India continued their rise. And\ncertainly BYD is happy to sell on the Indian market the cars it cannot build\nlocally. Indian officials claim to be open to Chinese investments, hinting in\nJanuary 2024 at Davos that the openness may increase as the border becomes\nquiet.\n\nThe potential long-term gains for either China or India are not clear. China\nseems to take a line from the ancient fable where the fox, unable to reach\nattractive grapes, proclaimed that \u201cthey were too sour anyway.\u201d China\u2019s India\nexperts and the Global Times, the mouthpiece for foreign consumption, proclaim\nthat India is \u201ca graveyard for investment\u201d and hype the known complexity of\ndoing business there.\n\nSome non-Chinese analysts argue that China\u2019s belligerent behavior, on three\nborder theaters, has pushed India to further embrace a quasi-alliance with the\nUnited States, and a very strong strategic partnership with France that\nimplies less conditionality on weapon procurement. But this is a result that\nXi Jinping\u2019s China has produced all over Asia. China does not seem to take\nactual notice of such developments as the Quad, AUKUS, a rising Japanese\nmilitary budget, or the Indo-Pacific designs of Europeans that leave China\naside.\n\nXi\u2019s China believes in the slow erosion of will in democracies, and that\nfactor seems to weigh more than the present power balance. China\u2019s new defense\nbudget increase of 7.2 percent is significant. While the real economy\ncertainly is growing at less than 5 percent, with slow price deflation, it is\na banner year for Chinese military procurement. Considering its 450 ships,\nwith increased projection across the Indian Ocean, and a large base in\nDjibouti, China is becoming strategically pre-eminent against all except the\nUnited States Navy, and even there, it can hope to match it in the near\nfuture.\n\nThe situation on the border is maybe even more critical for India for several\nreasons. First, China\u2019s tactics of erosion, with fake withdrawals followed by\nconsolidation, have created facts on the ground that will be hard to erase.\n\nSecond, it can be argued that for several years after March 2020, China had\neven more room to move forward. The imbalance of power between Chinese and\nIndian ground forces is even more flagrant than those of their navies. India\u2019s\nmilitary, hampered by long and weak logistical lines, could have indeed been\ndefeated even further. A humiliation of this magnitude would have been a\ncatastrophe for a government that is dependent on popular votes, with an\nopposition ready to pounce. A patient player who calculates his risks, Xi\nJinping did not push his advantage that far.\n\nSlowly but surely, India is working to reduce its vulnerability behind the\nborder. This is the basic argument behind its own armament drive, whether it\nis Made in India or procured from the West. Modi has also had to factor in the\ncontinuing dependence, even if dwindling, on Russian weapons and munitions.\n\nAll of the above has dictated India\u2019s diplomatic response and posture to the\nchallenges from China, while paying some homage to India\u2019s history of\nneutralism. As India\u2019s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar skillfully put\nit, his concept of \u201cmulti-alignment\u201d reflects a desire to combine the benefits\nof Western support while remaining open to other partners \u2013 including Russia,\nand potentially with China should the opportunity for negotiations arise. The\nrelationship with France, also preoccupied with \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d and\nseeking to be \u201ca power for equilibrium,\u201d has been made easier by this thread\nthat the two countries have in common.\n\nMulti-alignment also preserves the chances for India to exercise influence\nover the so-called Global South. There is no shortage of countries, including\nIndia, that tend to view the Russian war on Ukraine as \u201ca conflict among\nEuropeans.\u201d But, conversely, there is not a long list of nations ready to side\nwith India over China in a conflict over the Himalayas.\n\nIn fact, India hardly requests direct diplomatic support for its position over\nthe border issue. Clearly, it wants to preserve at all costs its freedom of\nmaneuver, and prefers to rely on concrete deals with suitable partners. Yet,\non significant issues such as Gaza and the Red Sea, India has disengaged from\nvocal partners such as South Africa and made a notable contribution to\nrestoring freedom of navigation. And it has most recently diminished its\npurchases of Russian oil, reportedly refusing to switch to payments in\nrenminbi.\n\nIn a sign of its intensifying bid with Asian allies to collectively contain\nChina\u2019s aggressive attitude, the Biden administration, apparently on its own\ninitiative, has formally declared for the first time its recognition of\nArunachal Pradesh as an Indian territory, and simultaneously its opposition to\nany unilateral move or incursion beyond the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\n\nEven prone to doubts on the longevity of such statements in a volatile\nAmerican political climate, this is an achievement for India\u2019s diplomacy.\nFaced with a dire situation in the Himalayas, seeking support while\nmaintaining the appearance of a balancing diplomacy on many issues, India is\nnow pulling through these difficulties on the eve of a national election.\nBarring any strategic surprise from China, it should find itself stronger\nafter this stage.\n\nIndia\u2019s predicament of confrontation with China creates growing convergence\nwith the European Union and its member states. Economic security issues, such\nas the diversification of supply chains or the risks of economic coercion,\nclearly bring Europe and India closer. Uncertainties regarding Xi Jinping\u2019s\nChina, its use of military power, and the extent to which it will directly\nchallenge the international security order are clearly shared concerns in\nEurope and India. How to turn this shared risk assessment into real\nopportunities \u2013 the untapped potential question \u2013 is a pressing issue for EU-\nIndia relations.\n\nThis article was originally published as the introduction to China Trends 19,\nthe quarterly publication of the Asia Program at Institut Montaigne.
