Qualcomm joins MediaTek\u2019s Dimensity\n9200 and Samsung\u2019s Exynos 2200 with support for hardware-based ray tracing,\nopening the door to fancy new graphical effects in the best mobile games.\n\nWith 2023 flagship handsets almost universally supporting the feature, will it\nbe the year that mobile gaming stops playing second fiddle to console and PC\ngraphics?\n\nWell, yes, but equally no. Smartphone ray tracing is undoubtedly a nice\nfeature to have and one that will, in all likelihood, result in fancier-\nlooking graphical effects and games. However, there are several hurdles still\nto be overcome, so a ray tracing reality check is in order.\n\n## Not all ray tracing implementations are equal\n\nQualcomm\n\nThe important thing to acknowledge here is that ray tracing is a graphical\nterm encompassing a wide range of possible implementations. You could think of\nthese as \u201clevels\u201d of ray tracing, each with graphics benefits and associated\nperformance costs. Just because smartphones support ray tracing doesn\u2019t mean\ngames will look like they do on console and PC.\n\nUltimately it boils down to whether you can render an entire scene with\ncomputationally expensive ray tracing or rely on a hybrid approach that only\nuses ray tracing for some effects. Since PCs and consoles still take a hybrid\napproach, we\u2019re looking at the latter in the smartphone space. At the high\nend, caustics can map how light and reflections bounce off curved surfaces\nlike water or glass. At the same time, less demanding implementations can\nimprove the accuracy of shadows and assist with reflections on some surfaces.\nThat\u2019s still great, but keep those expectations in check in terms of what ray\ntracing can and will be used for.\n\n\"Mobile ray tracing hardware is less powerful than consoles and PCs.\"\n\nWe do know a little about the ray tracing architectures used by Qualcomm and\nArm, which gives us some insight into their capabilities. For starters, both\naccelerate the core box and triangle intersections, which are the fundamental\nbuilding blocks of ray tracing. Calculating these ray intersections in\nhardware is multiple times faster than in software.\n\n#### Latest deals on top tech\n\nSee all deals\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Book 3 (13th-Gen Core i5, 16GB, 512GB)\n\n35% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3\n\n46% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * Jabra Elite 10\n\n20% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * JBL Charge 4\n\n30% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * Amazon Fire TV 55-Inch 4-Series 4K UHD Smart TV\n\n28% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\nQualcomm notes it supports reflections, shadows, and global illumination, key\ntechniques for producing decent, if not super high-end, ray tracing effects.\nLikewise, Arm notes it uses hybrid rasterization to enhance lighting, shadows,\nand reflections. However, layering these features requires more and more\nprocessing power, and we don\u2019t yet know just how far the first smartphone\nchips can push support and at what frame rate.\n\n\"Mobile GPUs vary in their level of ray tracing feature support and\nperformance.\"\n\nHowever, only Qualcomm supports Bounding Volume Hierarchical (BVH) (we don\u2019t\nknow about Samsung\u2019s Xclipse GPU), a similar technique to that used by NVIDIA\nand AMD in their high-end GPUs. BVH acceleration is important because it\nspeeds up ray intersection math by searching through groups of polygons to\nnarrow down the intersections rather than casting every ray individually.\n\nAs such, we might expect Qualcomm\u2019s implementation to offer better frame rates\nand more ray tracing complexity, but that\u2019s assuming its ray number crunching\ncapabilities are comparable to Arm\u2019s in the first place. BVH is great but\ndoesn\u2019t automatically translate into superior performance. Furthermore,\naspects including denoise and memory management can be fine-tuned to improve\nperformance. We don\u2019t know how far either Arm or Qualcomm has gone in\noptimizing its broader GPU for these requirements.\n\n## Mobile ray tracing benchmarks\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nOur extensive ray tracing benchmarks show that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 has\nclosed the gap since some disappointing initial benchmarks, likely through a\ndriver update. It\u2019s a close run contest with the Dimensity 9200 and its\nImmortalis G715 GPU for first place, while the older Exynos 2200 comes in a\nlittle way behind, which is to be expected.\n\nRegarding sustainable performance, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is a clearer winner\nhere. It runs cooler than the competition, keeping those frame rates up for\nlonger, even while running demanding ray tracing scenarios.\n\nWe have also had our first look at real ray tracing gameplay, thanks to War\nThunder Mobile. While the graphical effects are unfortunately not as game-\nchanging as we may have hoped, frame rates give cause for optimism that the\ngraphic effect can be implemented at playable frame rates.\n\nWe tracked results in the region of 45 to 60 FPS in the most demanding maps,\nwith graphics cranked all the way up on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 inside the ASUS\nROG Phone 7. However, that does compare to a rock solid above 60 FPS, often\nhitting 120FPS, without ray tracing enabled. As expected, the Exynos 2200\nscored lower but was still playable 45fps minimum. While this is only one\ntitle with limited ray tracing graphical fidelity, current smartphone chips\nare already clearly capable of hitting playable frame rates, which bodes well\nfor future processors and handsets in 2024, as well as upcoming Android games.\n\n## Smartphone ray tracing won\u2019t scale like consoles\n\nAdamya Sharma / Android Authority\n\nWhile we\u2019ll have to wait and see what additional titles bring to the table,\nwhat we can say for certain is that a smartphone chip designed for a sub-5W\ngraphical power budget is not going to scale up to the performance levels of a\ngames console or PC graphics card.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX4080 graphics card is a 320W behemoth, for example. At the same\ntime, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consume around 200W each (including\ntheir CPUs). 4K resolutions with all the bells and whistles are simply out of\nthe question for smartphone ray tracing.\n\n\"Benchmarks show a performance disparity between chipsets, but real games are\nplayable with ray tracing on.\"\n\nThat sounds OK but clearly highlights the trade-offs mobile must make\nregarding frame rate or resolution. Not to mention that sustained performance\ncan be an issue, given the limited cooling available to the smartphone form\nfactor and throttling problems we\u2019ve seen on recent handsets, even without ray\ntracing enabled. Basemark\u2019s In Vitro suite and 3DMark\u2019s Solar Bay showcase\nvarying performance between chips we\u2019ve tested, but it only uses ray tracing\nfor reflections.\n\nDoom and gloom aside, smaller smartphone displays don\u2019t need ultra-high\nresolutions or ultra-high levels of graphical fidelity to look great. 720p\n60fps or 1080p 30fps games with fancier lighting and reflections can still\nprovide a notable uplift to mobile graphics fidelity.\n\n## Games will take a while to appear\n\nDhruv Bhutani / Android Authority\n\nWe\u2019re well into 2023 now, when MediaTek and Qualcomm noted that the first\nmobile game with ray tracing support would make its way into consumers\u2019 hands,\nand we\u2019ve got our first taste with a couple of Western titles. War Thunder\nMobile offers an introductory taste of what ray tracing can offer, and Arena\nBreakout is said to support the feature (there doesn\u2019t appear to be a setting\nfor it). However, ray tracing doesn\u2019t yet change the graphical landscape \u2014\nthey\u2019re both good-looking games with or without ray tracing enabled. It will\ntake much longer, possibly years, before ray tracing gains mainstream mobile\nappeal.\n\nThis creeping rollout will be partly down to the fact that games have to be\nprofitable, which means mass market appeal rather than building them for just\na handful of phones. While there\u2019s always free marketing in being first, ray\ntracing implementations might be an afterthought for many developers, at least\nuntil hardware reaches larger adoption. It was the same with console and PC\ngames. That said, MediaTek notes that it\u2019s working with all major Chinese game\nstudios to support ray tracing in the future. We also spotted China\u2019s Tencent\nand Netease Games on Qualcomm\u2019s list of partners, so some markets may move to\nsupport the feature sooner than others.\n\n\"Game support is starting to ramp up, but mass adoption could take years.\"\n\nImportantly, with Qualcomm onboard, ray tracing is firmly on the map due to\nits sheer sales volume. An increasing number of titles will likely gradually\nopt-in in the coming years, offering fancier reflections and lighting for\nthose phones that support it. Ray tracing via the increasingly popular Vulkan\nAPI also means that cross-platform ports are more viable than ever. So again,\nplenty to be hopeful for in the medium and longer term.\n\n## Should I buy a phone for ray tracing?\n\nQualcomm\n\nHopefully, this article has convinced you; no. You shouldn\u2019t rush out to buy a\nnew phone simply because it supports ray tracing graphics. There are only a\nfew titles supported today and even then, the feature does not yet\nrevolutionize the look of the games. Honestly, you might even be better off\nwaiting for second-generation ray tracing GPUs, such as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\nor rumored Tensor G3, to boost performance up a notch to handle more demanding\ngames heading our way in future years.\n\nStill, ray tracing is a nice feature to have. If you\u2019re in the market for a\nnew phone soon-ish and gaming is a top priority for you, it could well be\nworth grabbing one of the best gaming phones that will be that little more\nfuture-proof. The first ray tracing-capable smartphones are already on the\nmarket, including the high-end Samsung Galaxy S23 series.\n\nFeatures\n\nGamingQualcomm Snapdragon\n\n## Welcome to Android Authority\n\n# Android Authority asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 305 TCF vendor(s) and 181 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
