They said that the\nAI-generated database had been used to assist intelligence officers involved\nin the bombing campaign in Gaza, helping identify tens of thousands of\npotential human targets.\n\nIn its rebuttal, the IDF said some of the accounts were \u201cbaseless\u201d. However,\nthe accounts are consistent with the remarks by Yoav during an AI conference\nat Tel Aviv university in February last year. The video, in which Yoav can be\nheard talking but not seen, was hosted on the university\u2019s YouTube channel,\nand until recently it had fewer than 100 views.\n\nAs he took to the stage wearing a military uniform, the audience was\ninstructed not to take any photos of Yoav or record his presentation. \u201cIt\u2019s\ngood because it\u2019s a bad hair day for me,\u201d he joked.\n\nIn the 10-minute presentation \u2013 titled \u201cdigital transformation and artificial\nintelligence in the intelligence domain\u201d \u2013 the colonel offered a rare insight\ninto how opaque AI systems are being used by secretive military and\nintelligence bodies.\n\nWhen using AI to predict whether someone is a terrorist, he explained, Unit\n8200 takes information it has about people it believes are members of\nterrorist groups and aims \u201cto find the rest of the group\u201d.\n\nA get in touch embed for Harry Davies\n\nReferring to a specific example, the official said that in the IDF\u2019s May 2021\nmilitary operation in Gaza, his department applied this principle to \u201cfind\nHamas squad missile commanders and anti-tank missile terrorists in Gaza in\norder to operate against them\u201d.\n\nHe explained that using a form of machine learning \u2013 known as \u201cpositive\nunlabelled learning\u201d \u2013 \u201cwe take the original sub-group, we calculate their\nclose circles, we then calculate relevant features, and at last we rank the\nresults and determine the threshold.\u201d\n\nThe colonel said intelligence officers\u2019 feedback is used \u201cto enrich and\nimprove our algorithm\u201d and stressed that \u201cpeople of flesh and blood\u201d make\ndecisions. \u201cEthically speaking we put a lot of emphasis on this,\u201d he said,\nadding that \u201cthese tools are meant to help break their barriers\u201d.\n\nAccording to Yoav, Unit 8200 was able to break \u201cthe human barrier\u201d during the\nMay 2021 offensive when it managed to produce more than 200 new targets.\n\u201cThere were times when this amount took us almost a year,\u201d he said.\n\nContacted for comment about the video, the IDF said the colonel\u2019s\nparticipation in the conference had been approved by the military. However, a\nspokesperson denied that his remarks conflict with the IDF\u2019s recent denials\nabout its use of AI. In a subtle change of wording not used in its original\nstatement, the IDF told the Guardian its AI systems do not \u201cchoose targets\u201d\nfor attack.\n\n\u201cThe IDF never denied the existence of a database of operatives in terrorist\norganisations, that cross-checks existing information on such operatives,\u201d it\nsaid. \u201cAt the same time, the IDF fully stands by its statement that it does\nnot use AI systems that choose targets for attack, and that the database in\nquestion is not a list of operatives eligible to attack. There is no\ncontradiction.\u201d\n\nIn their testimony, the six intelligence officers who spoke out last week said\nthat the Lavender tool had been used to help identify potential targets at an\nunprecedented scale and pace. The IDF was not accused of using systems that\nautomatically select targets for attack.\n\nFour of the sources said that, at one stage early in the war, Lavender listed\nas many as 37,000 men in the enclave who had been linked by the AI system to\nHamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. None of the sources denied that humans\nwere involved in the process of authorising strikes, although some confessed\nto minimal human oversight.\n\n\u201cI would invest 20 seconds for each target at this stage, and do dozens of\nthem every day,\u201d one intelligence officer said. \u201cI had zero added-value as a\nhuman, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of time.\u201d\n\nTheir accounts were published by the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972\nmagazine, its Hebrew-language outlet Local Call and the Guardian.\n\nCol Yoav\u2019s description of the partnership between AI and intelligence\npersonnel echoes a model for targeting operations envisioned by his commander,\nthe Unit 8200 chief Yossi Sariel, who the Guardian revealed left his identity\nexposed online when he secretly authored a book published in 2021, The Human\nMachine Team.\n\nAt one stage, the colonel explained that the AI and data science department he\nruns at Unit 8200 is also known internally as \u201cthe human machine integration\ncentre\u201d.\n\nSpeaking eight months before the IDF commenced operations in Gaza after the\nHamas-led 7 October attacks, the colonel spoke optimistically about how the\nIDF is moving \u201cfrom the postcard age to the digital era\u201d where \u201csuddenly you\ncan react during battle with applied data-science driven solutions\u201d.\n\nLooking ahead, he added: \u201cI\u2019m curious with respect to how will the next\noperation look like, digitally speaking\u201d.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Israel\n  * Gaza\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Middle East and north Africa\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
