Among the available apps is \"Monolingual\", a tool to help reduce the drive footprint of Sorbet Leopard by removing localization files for unneeded languages.^[5] Some users later found that libsqlite3.0.dylib would cause some stability and performance issues in some configurations; this can be replaced with libsqlite3.dylib from WebKit for OS X Leopard.^[6] As these are not official updates, a fresh install is required each time. Migration Assistant can be used, though Carbon Copy Cloner is recommended for the process after backing up personal files.^[7]\n\n## References[]\n\n  1. \u2191 Benefits of Sorbet Leopard over Leopard or Tiger? by lepidotos, Reddit. 2023-04-01.\n  2. \u2191 Sorbet Leopard - 10.5 Reinvigorated by z970, MacRumors Forums. 2021-06-21.\n  3. \u2191 Sorbet Leopard v2 has been released!
