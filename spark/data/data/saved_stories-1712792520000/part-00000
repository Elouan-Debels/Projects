A\nGreenpeace investigation published today reveals that seven manufacturers\nproducing IKEA\u2019s all-time favourite products, like INGOLF chairs or SNIGLAR\nbaby cribs and beds for children, are linked to the destruction of high-\nconservation value forests.[1][2] At least 30 different products from these\nsuppliers were found in IKEA stores in 13 countries: Austria, Belgium,\nCzechia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Israel, Poland, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, and the UK. Greenpeace calls on IKEA to become part of the\nsolution instead of contributing to the ongoing climate and biodiversity\ncrises.\n\nRobert Cyglicki, Biodiversity Campaign Director at Greenpeace Central and\nEastern Europe, said: \u201cOur nature heritage can\u2019t be turned into pieces of\nfurniture. Old forests are vital to the planet\u2019s health and must be\nimmediately protected. IKEA must live up to its own sustainability promises\nand clean up its supply chain from old-growth forest destruction.\u201d\n\nThe report Assemble the truth: Old-growth forest destruction in the Romanian\nCarpathians was researched and written by Greenpeace Central and Eastern\nEurope. Investigation teams followed the supply chain from analysing permits\nand satellite imagery of logging sites in the forests in Romania to wood\ndepots and furniture manufacturers, to where those products end up: on the\nshelves of IKEA stores. Several manufacturers were found to be sourcing wood\nfrom high conservation value forests. Based on publicly available information,\nIKEA is the biggest customer of products manufactured by most of those\ncompanies, implying a high likelihood that the problematic wood is ending up\nin IKEA furniture. According to the report, this appears certain in the case\nof one manufacturer, Plimob, as Plimob produces virtually exclusively for\nIKEA.[3]\n\nGreenpeace CEE gave IKEA the opportunity to comment on the findings of this\ninvestigation. IKEA didn\u2019t dispute the information. Of the manufacturers, one\nacknowledged receipt of timber from a Natura 2000 area, stating that such\ndestruction is not illegal, while several did not respond.\n\nGreenpeace recognises that furniture in general is a good way of using wood,\nstoring carbon and adding value to raw materials, but this must not happen\nwhile sacrificing the planet\u2019s most biologically diverse forests. The\nCarpathians are home to brown bears, lynx and wolves and the European bison\nand are among the most important flora and fauna refuges on the European\ncontinent. The problem is that companies and authorities want to avoid\nidentifying areas as primary or old-growth forests to avoid restrictions,\nleading to the fact that only just 2.4% (1700 km2) of the Romanian Carpathian\nforests are currently protected against logging. At the same time, official\ndata suggests that around 7% of the Romanian forests are over 120 years\nold.[4] According to the EU\u2019s Biodiversity strategy, these forests should be\nstrictly protected. \u201cIKEA must become a corporate frontrunner for the needed\npolitical action to put in place legally binding and effective biodiversity\nprotection measures to fulfil Europe\u2019s biodiversity targets,\u201d concludes\nCyglicki.\n\nENDS\n\nPhotos and Videos can be accessed from the Greenpeace Media Library.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Nature Crime File \u2013 Declassified: Assemble the truth: Old-growth forest\ndestruction in the Romanian Carpathians, Greenpeace Central and Eastern\nEurope/ Romania, 2024.\n\n[2] Masifpanel SRL, Aramis Invest SRL, Taparo SA, CH Industrial Prod SRL, Iris\nService Ciuc SA, Plimob SA, Aviva SRL\n\n[3] Ikea: radiographie d\u2019une contre-offensive m\u00e9diatique \u2013 Le Temps\n\n[4] Mapping and assessment of primary and old-growth forests in Europe\n\nContacts:\n\nChristine Gebeneter, Senior communication strategist at Greenpeace CEE, +43\n664 8403807, christine.gebeneter@greenpeace.org\n\nGreenpeace International Press Desk, +31 (0)20 718 2470 (available 24 hours),\npressdesk.int@greenpeace.org\n\nFollow @greenpeacepress on Twitter for our latest international press releases\n\n#Forests\n\n  * Greenpeace International\n  * A\n\n    * Africa\n\n      * English \u2022\n      * Fran\u00e7ais\n    * Aotearoa\n    * Argentina\n    * Australia\n    * Austria\n  * B\n\n    * Belgium\n\n      * Fran\u00e7ais \u2022\n      * Nederlands\n    * Brazil\n    * Bulgaria\n  * C\n\n    * Canada\n\n      * English \u2022\n      * Fran\u00e7ais\n    * Chile\n    * Colombia\n    * Croatia\n    * Czech Republic\n  * D\n\n    * Denmark\n  * E\n\n    * East Asia\n\n      * \u4e2d\u6587\u7b80\u4f53 \u2022\n      * \u7e41\u9ad4 \u2022\n      * \u6b63\u9ad4 \u2022\n      * \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \u2022\n      * English\n    * European Union\n  * F\n\n    * Finland\n    * France\n  * G\n\n    * Germany\n    * Greece\n  * H\n\n    * Hungary\n  * I\n\n    * India\n\n      * English \u2022\n      * Hindi\n    * Indonesia\n    * Israel\n    * Italy\n  * J\n\n    * Japan\n  * L\n\n    * Luxembourg\n\n      * Deutsch \u2022\n      * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * M\n\n    * Malaysia\n    * Mexico\n    * Middle East and North Africa\n\n      * \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u2022\n      * English \u2022\n      * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * N\n\n    * Netherlands\n    * Norway\n  * P\n\n    * Peru\n    * Philippines\n    * Poland\n  * R\n\n    * Romania\n  * S\n\n    * Slovakia\n    * Slovenia\n    * South Asia\n    * Southeast Asia\n    * Spain\n\n      * Espa\u00f1ol \u2022\n      * Catal\u00e0 \u2022\n      * Euskara \u2022\n      * Galego\n    * Sweden\n    * Switzerland\n\n      * Deutsch \u2022\n      * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * T\n\n    * Thailand\n    * Turkey\n  * U\n\n    * UK\n    * USA\n\nFollow us\n\n  * Instagram\n  * Twitter\n  * TikTok\n  * Youtube\n  * Linkedin\n  * Facebook\n  * RSS\n  * Github\n\nGreenpeace International 2024 Unless otherwise stated, the copy of the website\nis licensed under a CC-BY International License\n\n#### Manage your cookies preferences\n\nPlease select which cookies you are willing to store.\n\nNecessary Cookies (required) Always enabled\n\nThese cookies are required for technical reasons so that you can visit our\nwebsite and use the functions we offer.
