This method can be used in automated environments and eliminates the\nneed to use username/password combinations or long-lived, manually generated\nAPI tokens to authenticate with PyPI when publishing.\n\nInstead, maintainers can configure PyPI to trust an identity provided by a\ngiven OpenID Connect Identity Provider (IdP). This allows allows PyPI to\nverify and delegate trust to that identity, which is then authorized to\nrequest short-lived, tightly-scoped API tokens from PyPI. These API tokens\nnever need to be stored or shared, rotate automatically by expiring quickly,\nand provide a verifiable link between a published package and its source.\n\n### Get started today\n\nTo get started with using trusted publishers on PyPI, see our documentation\nhere: https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nFunding for work implementing Google Cloud and GitLab support was provided by\nthe Google Open Source Security Team, and much of the development work was\nperformed by Trail of Bits, with special thanks to contributors William\nWoodruff and Facundo Tuesca.\n\nActiveState support was provided by ActiveState, with special thanks to\ncontributors Carey Hoffman and Pete Garcin.\n\nDustin Ingram is a maintainer of the Python Package Index.\n\nMade with Material for MkDocs\n\n", "frontpage": false}
