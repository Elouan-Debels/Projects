This led to consumers being unable to pay for goods and services\nonline. Banks and payment providers stated that they could not support\npayments because they had to recalibrate their systems to the new currency.\n\n> How Zimbabwean startups are forging ahead despite hyperinflation and\n> sanctions\n\nSome Zimbabweans expressed concern about the lack of organisation regarding\nthe new currency. \u201cBank balances have been converted to ZiG but its\ncirculation starts on 30 April and I can\u2019t use it for online payments, so how\nwill I make any payments between now and April 12?\u201d said a consumer who\npreferred anonymity.\n\nOnline transactions have been slow to garner widespread usage as Zimbabweans\nhave developed a culture of cash-based transactions in more stable currencies\nincluding the South African rand, Botswana pula, and US dollar. This stems\nfrom a fear of having money kept in bank accounts abruptly converted by the\ngovernment to unstable currencies, as has happened in the past.\n\nHowever, a sprouting of online payment solutions over the last few years has\nseen adoption gradually increase in Zimbabwe. Technologies which has gained\nprominence include Innbucks, which allows customers to receive loose change at\nrestaurants; Ecocash, a digital wallet; and O\u2019Mari, a superapp which includes\nmobile money, insurtech, and investech products.\n\nShare this article\n\n## Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n## More from this author\n\nNews\n\nSouth African used-car platform WeBuyCars sets sight on $420m valuation with\nJSE Listing\n\nEphraim Modise\n\nNews\n\nSouth Africa passes digital nomad visa law amid public concerns\n\nEphraim Modise\n\nNews\n\nBaobab Network acquires Reflector to support portfolio companies\u2019 marketing\nefforts\n\nEphraim Modise\n\n## Read Next\n\nNews\n\nBreaking: YC selects Kenyan fintech startup, Triply as its latest African pick\n\nFaith Omoniyi\n\n## Read more\n\nNews\n\nWho calls the shots at Susa Ventures-backed Okra?\n\nGaniu Oloruntade\n\nBanking\n\nBank of Uganda increases interest rates to curb inflation as shilling falls\n\nAdonijah Ndege\n\nNews\n\nBinance executive pleads not guilty to money laundering charges, to be\nremanded in prison\n\nGaniu Oloruntade\n\nNews\n\nFirst Bank Holdings to raise \u20a6300bn capital amid CBN\u2019s banking reforms\n\nJoseph Olaoluwa\n\nNews\n\nForeign investors stage comeback to Nigeria, seeking high yields over interest\nrates\n\nJoseph Olaoluwa\n\nEnterprise\n\nNigeria\u2019s stock exchange buys stake in Ethiopia\u2019s first-ever bourse\n\nAdonijah Ndege\n\nTechCabal is a future-focused publication that speaks to African innovation\nand technology in depth\n\nFollow us\n\nCopyright \u00a92024.
