These parts could, he warned, fall apart after\nthousands of flights.\n\nHe told The New York Times that the plane's fuselage comes in several large\npieces from different manufacturers that are fastened together on an assembly\nline.\n\nIn 2019, the Times spoke to other Boeing whistleblowers at the plant in\nCharleston, South Carolina, where the 787 is made. They alleged that workers\nwere pressured to work quickly on the planes and that concerns were ignored.\n\nOne of those whistleblowers \u2014 John Barnett, a former Boeing quality inspector\nwho raised safety concerns at the Charleston plant \u2014 was found dead in the\ncity in March while conducting legal action against the company. A legal\nexpert has said his lawsuit could continue posthumously.\n\nA Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner taxis after concluding its first flight at Boeing\nField in Seattle, in 2013. Stephen Brashear / Getty Images file\n\nIt appears that Salehpour had previously sent his concerns to the Senate\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who chairs the panel's investigations\nsubcommittee, said Tuesday night that he received a whistleblower's\nallegations earlier this year and had invited Salehpour to speak at a hearing\non \"Boeing's broken safety culture\" next week.\n\nBlumenthal and committee ranking member Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., wrote to Boeing\nand the FAA in March to say they had received whistleblower claims from a\nBoeing engineer about \"potentially catastrophic safety risks\" with the 787,\nwithout naming Salehpour.\n\n### Recommended\n\nIsrael-Hamas war\n\n### Israel-Hamas warHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh says 3 of his sons were killed\nin an Israeli airstrike in Gaza\n\nU.S. news\n\n### U.S. news6 Mississippi 'Goon Squad' officers sentenced to 15 to 45 years\non state charges for torture of 2 Black men\n\nLaunched after a series of delays in 2011, the 787 was the first commercial\njet with a main structure mostly made from composite materials, primarily\ncarbon-fiber reinforced plastic, which are lighter than metals such as\naluminum.\n\nBoeing said Salehpour's allegations were \"inaccurate\" and contrary to the\nfindings of comprehensive testing that had found the 787 could operate safely\nbefore needing \"conservative maintenance routines.\" A single plane could be in\nservice for 40 to 50 years, the company said.\n\nOn the specific allegation about the possibility of newer materials failing\nunder repeated stress of flight, the company said: \"Another benefit of the\n787\u2019s composite structure is the material does not fatigue or corrode like\ntraditional metals, which reduces maintenance over many decades in service.\"\n\nDebra S. Katz, a lawyer for Salehpour, told the Times that the engineer raised\nsafety concerns with the company but was ignored and sidelined. She said he\nwas transferred to work on another model, the 777, and found problems with the\nconstruction of that plane too.\n\n\"This is a culture that prioritizes production of planes and pushes them off\nthe line even when there are serious concerns about the structural integrity\nof those planes and their production process,\" Katz said.\n\nIn its statement, Boeing said: \"We continue to monitor these issues under\nestablished regulatory protocols and encourage all employees to speak up when\nissues arise. Retaliation is strictly prohibited at Boeing.\"\n\nAn FAA statement said: \u201cVoluntary reporting without fear of reprisal is a\ncritical component in aviation safety. We strongly encourage everyone in the\naviation industry to share information. We thoroughly investigate all\nreports.\"\n\nPatrick Smith\n\nPatrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWE AND OUR PARTNERS USE COOKIES ON THIS SITE TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE, PERFORM\nANALYTICS, PERSONALIZE ADVERTISING, MEASURE ADVERTISING PERFORMANCE, AND\nREMEMBER WEBSITE PREFERENCES.
