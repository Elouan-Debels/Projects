However, it is possible to place CloudFront and API Gateway in\nfront of an App Runner service which has support for Web sockets.For\nCloudFront, you can put a CloudFront distribution in front of a public App\nRunner service. For API Gateway, you have couple options\n\n  1. API Gateway in front of public App Runner service - You can use API Gateway HTTP proxy integration feature and put App Runner service behind an API Gateway. The traffic will flow from API Gateway -> public App Runner service. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-http.html\n  2. API Gateway in front of private App Runner service - Make the App Runner service private (accessible within a VPC) and use API Gateway VPCLink with HTTP proxy integration feature to put private App Runner service behind an API gateway. For VPCLink, you will have to set a NLB with targets as IP address of PrivateLink VPC endpoint. The traffic will flow from API Gateway -> NLB -> VPC endpoint -> private App Runner service. You can share the same API Gateway, NLB and VPC endpoint to access multiple private App Runner services so the cost of non App Runner infrastructure components (API Gateway, NLB and VPC endpoint) is shared as well as it is their one time setup and does not need to be repeated with every App Runner service - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-private-integration.html\n\n  \n---  \n  \namitgupta85 mentioned this issue Nov 28, 2022\n\nNeed integrated authentication of incoming requests #160\n\nOpen\n\n###\n\nhaversnail commented Nov 28, 2022 \u2022\n\n> For CloudFront, you can put a CloudFront distribution in front of a public\n> App Runner service.\n\nIIRC I did this very thing for Server-Sent Events, but to no avail.

I've just finished moving all\nmy apps to app runner, spun up a test environment and only now realise there's\nno web socket support. I moved from a more complex (to manage) ALB/EC2 setup\nthat supported it, so I expected it to be supported here.Basically, I now have\nto move off App Runner to something else after spending hours/days moving my\napps here - it's super infuriating.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nhenricook commented Mar 3, 2023\n\n@amitgupta85 All my hopes are on your post to save lots of wasted work. I've\nput a Cloudfront distribution in front of my public app runner service URL -\nbut my app still seems to be getting a 403 when trying to open a wss://\nconnection - have I missed something?  \n---  \n  \n###\n\namitgupta85 commented Mar 3, 2023\n\nWe are taking a look at the CloudFront issue and will post updates soon. In\nthe meantime, you can also try out the API Gateway option by following putting\nAPI Gateway in front of App Runner (as discussed above) and enabling web\nsockets on API Gateway -\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-\nwebsocket-api-integration-requests.html  \n---  \n  \nAuthor\n\n###\n\ngsogol commented Mar 3, 2023\n\n@amitgupta85 or you can prioritize web sockets in AppRunner and call it a day.\nCommunity over internal priorities should always take precedence \ud83e\udd14  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nhenricook commented Mar 3, 2023 \u2022\n\nIt's not actually just websockets that's failing on a cloudfront distribution\nin front of my public apprunner endpoint, it's any request. Are there any\nspecial settings required above a normal origin-using-the-public-url? Does it\nhave to be a custom domain? (I'm using my awsapprunner.com subdomain\ncurrently)  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nhenricook commented Mar 3, 2023\n\nI guessed my way through a Websockets API API Gateway setup, because your\ninstructions are pretty vague. I used a $request.body.action route selection\nexpression, and in the $default route I connected an HTTP PROXY integration to\nmy awsapprunner.com URL. I deployed to a stage called 'Prod' which gave me a\nurl like this:https://a1ykizot66.execute-api.ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/@connectionsI think that means I should expect\nhttps://a1ykizot66.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/ping to\nreturn \"Hello World\"to behave the same as https://gx6d3sumsa.ap-\nsoutheast-1.awsapprunner.com/ping which returns \"Hello World\".. which it does\nnot. Although I've almost surely missed something because API Gateway is so\ncomplicated, any idea what?  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nhenricook commented Mar 6, 2023 \u2022\n\nFor readers. I couldn't get this working with Cloudfront. Using the app runner\ndomain it returned 404s/403s, after configuring a custom domain it only\nreturned 502s.Instructions are insufficient for API Gateway and I couldn't\nfigure it out.I've had to bail to Lightsail Containers (LC) until this gets\nsorted out but with barely any signs of life from the AppRunner team it seems\nunlikely.Trade offs:\n\n  * No github integration\n  * LC lets you deploy images from your ECR but unfortunately doesn't have auto-hooks to deploy images on push, it requires a manual jiggle in the AWS UI.\n  * Also its logs don't integrate with Cloudwatch logs and are fairly cumbersome to use.\n\n  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nhaversnail commented Mar 6, 2023\n\n@henricook thanks for sharing your solution here, I appreciate the details. \ud83d\udc4f\nFWIW, I also had to find another solution for my own WS/SSE-powered\ncontainerized app and ended up having to create an entire ALB + Fargate\nService just to run it.IMO it is very disappointing that this issue has\nremained open for so long, with so many upvotes, with so little\ncommunication/guidance from the AWS team. Although I was able to navigate\naround this issue for a personal project, the lack of WS support in AppRunner\nhas caused our team at work to re-evaluate deploying our service on AWS\nentirely, as we are currently leveraging multiple cloud providers at the\nmoment. I would think it would be in the AWS team's best interest to\nprioritize this request, as without it, GCP's Cloud Run will continue to\nsiphon current and potential customers away from AWS. \ud83d\ude1e  \n---  \n  \nsnnles moved this from Researching to We are working on it in Roadmap Mar 7,\n2023\n\n###\n\npclokcer commented Mar 28, 2023\n\nI am working since 2 week.
