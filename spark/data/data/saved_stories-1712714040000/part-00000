We\nneed more data minimization and less collection. Holding data should be viewed\nas a tremendous responsibility and improper access and use of it should expose\nthe holder to liability.\n\nIf you're collecting data you shouldn't reasonably need, then you should be\ngreeted with apprehension, resistance, ad blockers and mitigation efforts.\n\nRespect your users, provide value and quit grasping at data you don't need and\naren't entitled to.\n\nTake a look at the GitHub repository for this project.
