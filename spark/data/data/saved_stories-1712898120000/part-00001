The union is exploring voluntary measures to\nreduce the need for furloughs and downgrades, he said.\n\n## Spirit Airlines to delay delivery of new Airbus planes\n\nA snag with Pratt & Whitney GTF engines has forced Spirit to ground some of\nits A320neo aircraft. It has said the number of grounded jets would climb\nsteadily to an average of about 40 in December 2024.\n\nAccording to the airline, a recent agreement with Pratt & Whitney on\ncompensation over their GTF engines would improve Spirits' liquidity by\nbetween $150 million and $200 million.\n\n\"This amendment to our agreement with Airbus is an important part of Spirit's\ncomprehensive plan to bolster profitability and strengthen our balance sheet,\"\nTed Christie, Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer said. \"Deferring\nthese aircraft gives us the opportunity to reset the business and focus on the\ncore airline while we adjust to changes in the competitive environment.\"\n\nThe deferral does not impact planes scheduled for delivery in 2027 through\n2029, Spirit said.\n\nThe ultra-low-cost airline has been facing questions about its future after\nlosing money in the past six quarters despite booming travel demand.\n\nAnalysts and industry officials say the airline will have to make drastic\nchanges, including cutting flights and exiting some markets to become\nprofitable, which is still not likely to happen this year.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nSMS Facebook Twitter Email\n\nShare your feedback to help improve our site!\n\nShare your feedback to help improve our site!\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Subscription Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Site Map\n  * Accessibility\n  * Our Ethical Principles\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024\n\n## About Your Privacy\n\nClicking on the \"Reject All\" Button retains the default setting of only\nstrictly necessary cookies.\n\nWe and our 64 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
