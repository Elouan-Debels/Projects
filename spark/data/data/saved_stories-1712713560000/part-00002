The new\nDuo plan gives secure, private email to you and a partner at a reduced price.\nFor just a little more, our Family plan includes up to six people, so you can\nupgrade your whole family.\n\nWith each plan, individual users will have separate login information,\nmailboxes, and 50 GB of storage. Additionally, users on these plans can share\ncustom domains and create private or shared calendars and address books. Keep\nthe family calendar in one easy-to-access location while still maintaining\nyour personal and work emails securely and separately. And with Fastmail,\nyou\u2019ll enjoy great features that include:\n\n  * As always, secure, private, and easy-to-access email\n  * Folders, labels, calendars, and contacts for a seamless transition\n  * Great search\u2014turning your email archive from a pile of words into a gold mine of information\n  * Pin, snooze, or mute conversations to stay in control of your inbox\n  * Masked Email addresses to keep your real email address private and stop your activity from being tracked across the web\n\n## Better billing for global customers\n\nFastmail is now available in over 20 global currencies. Rather than billing\neveryone in US dollars, we will allow almost all of our customers to pay in\ntheir local currency, giving you stable pricing and avoiding the added cost of\ncurrency conversion.\n\n## Increased storage for Business Plans\n\nOur existing Basic, Standard, and Professional plans remain as options for\nbusinesses to mix-and-match to suit their needs. To ensure your email can\ncontinue to serve as your electronic memory, we are increasing storage for\nboth Basic and Standard.\n\nOur Basic plan increases from 2 GB to 5 GB storage, and our Standard plan is\nincreasing from 30 GB to 50 GB. This is effective immediately for all users on\nthese plans.\n\nWe have introduced new prices for all three plans, now in 20 supported\ncurrencies, not just US dollars.\n\n## Information for existing customers\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled by your excitement about these new plans! We\u2019ve updated storage\nfor all existing Basic and Standard users today at no extra cost.\n\nWe\u2019ll be moving everyone to our new plans and pricing later this year, as soon\nas we\u2019re able to. This will include billing you in the local currency of your\nbilling country when supported.\n\nWe\u2019ll email you at least 30 days before your first renewal under the new plans\nto ensure you have all the details, including the price of your renewal, which\nmay change. You\u2019ll also have the option to switch to our Duo or Family plan at\nthat time.\n\nThe last update to our plans was in 2017, and since then, we have introduced\nhuge improvements to Fastmail, such as:\n\n  * Masked Email to help you protect your identity\n  * Productivity tools like Undo Send, Snooze, and Scheduled Send\n  * Customization options like Dark Mode, Labels, Themes, and Custom Swipes\n  * Most recently, Mute Conversations and our address picker for calendar invites\n\nAs for many businesses, our operating costs have also risen significantly in\nthat time. Your subscription allows us to operate an email service free from\nadvertising or data mining. It also supports our contributions to open\nstandards \u2014 where we\u2019re at the forefront of keeping email open for the future\n\u2014 and funds the development of new features. We deeply appreciate your\nsupport, and believe this change will help us to continue to deliver the best\nvalue to you now and in the future.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding how these changes will affect\nyou, please visit our help page.\n\ntwitter share link\n\nfacebook share link\n\nlinkedin share link\n\nThe Fastmail Team Read more by this author\n\nUpgrade your privacy and productivity and join the best in email.\n\nSign up for your free 30-day trial >\n\nWant more information?
