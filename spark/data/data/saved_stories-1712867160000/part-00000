Here\u2019s what to do instead.\n\nsource\n\nI can\u2019t remember how many times at Smart Bear I tried to sell our main product\nCode Reviewer with the argument that it \u201csaves you money.\u201d Some customers\ndemanded it in the form of an ROI spreadsheet. So we gave it to them.\n\nThe argument makes sense (though it\u2019s wrong). Code Reviewer is tool which\nhelps software developers review each other\u2019s work, just like an editor of a\nbook. It cuts the time of a code review in half\u2014maybe better\u2014because it\neliminates busywork. We even lead with that in our one-pager (because back in\n2004, sales calls were in person, and one-page leave-behinds were useful):\n\nThe economics are obvious: If two developers would each normally spend an\naverage of 30 minutes on a code review, once a day, that\u2019s 20 hours per month.\nAt a fully-loaded developer cost of $150/hr, that costs you $3,000/mo. Code\nReviewer cuts the time in half, which means you save $1,500 every month.\n\nCode Reviewer costs $499/developer\u2014one time^1\u2014so you make your money back with\nthe first month! After that it\u2019s gravy... all the way to the bank.\n\n> ^1 Ah, the days before SaaS, when all software was \u201clifetime,\u201d though you\u2019d\n> attempt \u201cmaintenance and upgrades\u201d sales in future years at 20% of the\n> original price. Life is better now.\n\nYou can\u2019t afford not to buy it, right?\n\nBut this argument never worked, not once, even though the reasoning is sound\nand customers requested it. The reason is that these \u201csavings\u201d aren\u2019t how\nbudgets actually work.\n\nIn a perfect world, if the software development organization really did\nproduce more, higher-quality code, that\u2019s undeniably valuable. But it\u2019s also\nessentially impossible to measure, and is in fact not measured. So the\n\u201csavings\u201d are invisible, even if real.\n\nOn top of that, budgets are siloed; the \u201cSalaries\u201d budget is separate from the\n\u201cTools\u201d budget. Never once in my seven years selling software at Smart Bear,\nwhether 10 seats or 2500 seats, did a company make a decision in which savings\nin the \u201cSalaries\u201d budget resulted in an increase to the \u201cTools\u201d budget.\n\nWith Code Reviewer, the customer buys because they genuinely believe it makes\ntheir team more productive, even though they cannot in quantify ROI.\nSpreadsheets are worthless\u2014they either believe, or they don\u2019t.\n\nAs the startup founder, what do you do about this?\n\nFirst, create so much value^2 that there\u2019s no need to \u201ccompute\u201d it. If so-\ncalled pay-back period really is less than a month, it\u2019s obvious. Change\nsomeone\u2019s workflow so drastically for the better that they can\u2019t live without\nit whether it\u2019s saving money or not. Improve your customers\u2019 marketing\ncampaigns so obviously and drastically that they don\u2019t need a spreadsheet to\nunderstand its value.\n\n> ^2 more leads, more sales, faster code, efficiency, time-savings, cost-\n> savings, delight, corporate brand, personal image, societal impact\n\nSecond, price according to ability and willingness to pay and the structure of\nyour business model, rather than as a direct function of so-called \u201cvalue.\u201d\nThe software development department has a budget for tools, and different\ncompanies have different ways of arguing internally for expanding that\nbudget\u2014you have to match those constraints. The marketing department might be\nwilling to pay for services but not for tools.\n\nIn any case, rarely is a simple \u201ccost savings\u201d equation the way you\u2019re going\nto win sales or set prices.\n\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear https://longform.asmartbear.com/roi-selling/ \u00a9\n2007-2024 Jason Cohen @asmartbear\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\n\u201cROI\u201d is the wrong way to sell your product\n\n1 of 1\n\n### Thank you for sharing this article:\n\nNo ads.
