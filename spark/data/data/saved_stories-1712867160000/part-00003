Deep inside,\nwe yearn to get rid of the natural limitations, walk deeper into the forest,\nclimb higher mountains, and challenge the unprecedented speed limits.\n\nEquipped with Hypershell Omega, you can go further, climb higher mountains,\nrun faster, and carry more along the way, or simply walk with less effort. Say\ngoodbye to sore legs after shopping, visiting museums, theme parks, and\nexhibitions. From a mountainous trek to a day at the museum, Hypershell\nprovides power and strength to those who need it, when they need it.\n\n###\n\nTHE HYPER POWER YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.\n\nWe design Hypershell to be an entirely new generation of the exoskeleton. It\npacks state-of-the-art robotics, ergonomics, and AI into an extremely compact\nform that provides uncompromising power when needed. Hypershell saves you from\ntired walking, physical work, long trips, and mileage limits so that you can\nexplore more options outside your comfort zone.\n\n### SHAPING THE NEW SPECIES.\n\nFor the first time, super-powerful, ultra-lightweight, and elevated\nflexibility has become a reality in one.\n\nThe innovative Omega\u00ae system makes Hypershell lightweight and powerful.\nPatented and created for lower limb exoskeletons, the Omega\u00ae system brings\nnumerous advantages that make Hypershell distinctive. The central motor is\ninvented in combination with eight passive joints, doubling the assist\neffectiveness and performance/weight ratio of the exoskeleton.\n\n### NO PLACE TOO FAR.\n\nFor travelers and backpackers, Hypershell can be your power bank of endurance.\nRecede fatigue, expand your radius and freedom, travel through jungles,\ndeserts, and snowy mountains, and explore the untouched depths of nature.\n\nFor professionals such as photographers, Hypershell can multiply your\nproductivity. It makes your work easier by offsetting your pack weight,\nhelping you go further, stay longer onsite, and take the closest shot.\n\nFor explorers like mountain lovers, Hypershell can be the sherpa in your\nbackpack, offsetting a massive amount of weight above the snow line while\nreducing altitude sickness and the risk of accidents when you are exhausted.\n\n### GO WILD, FOR A WHILE.\n\nLooking for more outside the zone? The Hyper Mode is designed for those who\nlove challenging their status quo. Simply hold the buttons on both sides to\ncall for Hyper Mode. Hypershell will instantly answer with an output\nequivalent to 1 horsepower, 50% torque increase, and quadrupled motion\nacceleration capability.\n\nAt the same time, the AI Motion Engine inside Hypershell will act more\naggressively, boosting reaction frequency from 10000Hz to 30000Hz. This brings\nan added max running speed of 20km/h, a 60-degree slope sprint, a steady 30kg\nweight offset, and 10kg of horizontal thrust to make a history of your own.\n\n### MONSTER IN THE SHELL.\n\nTo get the monstrous performance, we created monsters of our own. The M-One\nmotor inside Hypershell is the world's smallest high-precision Permanent\nMagnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM), capable of boasting one horsepower and 32N\u00b7m\nof torque. This power is equivalent to lifting three cars (4,400 kg) by 1\nmeter within a minute.\n\nnlike the market wearable exoskeletons with 125W motors, Hypershell demands\nstronger performance to aid you in extreme sports. The M-One motor is\nspecially developed for high-performance wearable robots. It is highly\nintegrated, ultra-lightweight, high-precision, and provides astoundingly\nstrong power.\n\n###\n\nMACHINE HEARTS, HUMAN MINDS.\n\nHypershell uses a unique sensor architecture incorporating torque, position,\nand force sensors to understand your movement. This sequence delivers\ninformation on lower limb kinematics and dynamics, and realistically models\nthe motion gait in milliseconds.\n\nThe brain of Hypershell is made with not one but two powerful processors, one\nhandling complex real-time motor control and the other acting as an external\ncerebellum, housing the proprietary motion engine. Hypershell can therefore\nmodel your body and maintain an acute awareness of your body movement.\n\n### RIGHT AS TERRAIN.\n\nAdventures are sometimes tough. With Hypershell, you can seamlessly shift\ngears between different terrain conditions and paces because it understands\nhow you move and calculates your optimal output. Easily move through the day\nwith an AI Motion Engine that adapts to over nine sports modes, including\nwalking, race walking, running, riding, climbing, up/down stairs, up/down\nhills, gravel road, and auto hold.\n\nThe MotionEngine technology utilizes AAF (Automatic Adaptive Force) algorithms\nbased on deep learning models to foreknow your next move. Simulation\ntechnology and extensive data training generated by Human-in-the-Loop allow\nthe MotionEngine to handle a variety of complex terrains intelligently.\nHypershell will actively learn and adapt to your motion habits as you spend\nmore time using it. Take the first step, and leave the rest to Hypershell.\n\n### GOING BEYOND RANGE LIMITS.\n\nHypershell integrates high-polymer lithium batteries with a kinetic energy\nrecovery system to provide an extra 35km range when you feel you can't go\nfurther. Thanks to high-density ternary lithium battery technology, we are\nable to squeeze 74Wh into an ultra-compact volume inside Hypershell. At the\nsame time, it has an ultra-high cycle life and maintains 80% capacity after\ntwo years of intense use.\n\n###\n\nENGINEERED FOR MORE.\n\nThe smart battery management system (BMS) on Hypershell supports universal\nUSB-C PD fast charging. You can use a phone charger to charge Hypershell while\ntraveling and get a 20% battery level in just 10 minutes, which provides a 5km\nfunctional range.\n\nHypershell can get you covered even in multi-day hiking or long trips. The\nhot-swappable battery design on both sides of Hypershell is compatible with a\nmixture of new and used batteries, so you can switch batteries anytime during\nuse.\n\n### A SHERPA IN YOUR BACKPACK.\n\nWe designed Hypershell with uncompromising portability in mind. When folded,\nHypershell only sits at the size of A4 paper and can be easily put in almost\nany backpack. With only 6.5 liters and 1.8kg in your bag, Hypershell can free\nyou from the edges of discomfort, so you can hike farther and more\ncomfortably, cover wider terrain and see more.\n\n### AIRY AND COMFORTABLE.\n\nEvery ounce counts. To create a lightweight, high-strength fuselage for\nHypershell, we used an integrated aluminum-magnesium alloy die-casting method,\nTogether with Omega systems, Hypershell only weighs 1/2 of the products of the\nprevious generation.\n\nThanks to hundreds of strenuous simulations and iterations, Hypershell is\nstrong enough to reach a fatigue life of over 10 million cycles, and light\nenough to maintain the lowest weight within its class.\n\n### GROUNDBREAKING,EVEN IN A RAINSTORM.\n\nWhen adventures are taken outdoors, they must withstand all conditions.\nWhether heavy rain or sandstorms \u2013 many weather conditions can damage\nelectronic parts. Water or dirt must not enter the motor. This requires a very\nspecial configuration of the connections, the electronics, the mechanical\nstructure, and the enclosure.\n\nHypershell has gone to great lengths to make weatherproof products and offers\nthese features: waterproof screw connections, specially coated circuit boards,\nweatherproof aluminum enclosures, and polyurethane coatings including UV\nprotection. This ensures optimum protection of the product at all times. The\nweatherproof-certified products of Hypershell comply with protection class\nIP54 according to IEC 529 / EN 60529.\n\n### ALWAYS ON TRACK.\n\nTake your adventurous lifestyle to higher ground with Hypershell app. Its\nmulti-parameter data insights and real-time control (speed monitoring, machine\nstatus, steps record, mileage monitoring, assistance, statistics, firmware\nupgrade) allow you to uncover your personal best along each adventure.\n\nSpecification\n\n### IN THE BOX\n\nReviews\n\n### You may also like\n\nPre-orderCompare\n\n### Extra Belt Kit(ON PREORDER)\n\n\u20ac158,95 EUR\n\nPre-orderCompare\n\n### Step Further Kit(ON PREORDER)\n\n\u20ac227,95 EUR\n\n### Support\n\n### Support\n\n  * Order Tracking\n  * Warranty Policy\n  * FAQs\n\n### Privacy & Terms\n\n### Privacy & Terms\n\n  * Shipping Policy\n  * Return&Refund Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n\n### Company\n\n### Company\n\n  * About Us\n  * Contact Us\n  * Community\n  * Blog\n\nBe the first to know latest updates and unlock exclusive offers.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Hypershell.
