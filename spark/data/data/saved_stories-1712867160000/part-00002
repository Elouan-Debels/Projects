It started by\nsaving developers from repeatedly typing the same commands and grew into an\nAPI platform used by millions. Early on, we recognized that APIs are\ninherently collaborative because they\u2019re two-sided. A client calls the API, a\nserver returns the response, and the relationship is valuable because the API\nserves a purpose for the client.\n\nBut that collaboration isn\u2019t limited to a single client and server. Teams\nbuild APIs, stakeholders review APIs, and when it comes to public APIs, there\nare millions of clients. At that scale, communities form around APIs. Members\nof these communities work together to resolve issues, give feedback, and share\ncontent to show what\u2019s possible with a given API. An API is only as strong as\nthe community around it.\n\nThat\u2019s why today, we\u2019re thrilled to announce that Postman has acquired\nOrbit\u2014the leading tool developer companies use to grow their communities.\n\nFor the last four years, Orbit has helped top developer companies manage and\ngrow their communities across platforms like Discord, Slack, and GitHub. Its\nsoftware empowers builders to connect with developers, measure the quality of\ntheir experience, and identify opportunities to improve developer experience.\n\nFor the last 10 years, Postman has built the leading API platform enabling\ndevelopers to collaborate with every other developer on Earth. Developer teams\ncan build APIs together. Stakeholder teams, like application security, can\nstay updated with API changes across their company. Product managers can build\nAPI products to share with partners and companies. And finally, individuals\nand companies can distribute their APIs to the rest of the world on the\nPostman Public API Network.\n\nAt Postman, the Orbit team will now build community features into the Postman\nPublic API Network so that publishers and consumers can actively collaborate.\nLed by Noah Schwartz, who recently joined us from AWS to lead the Public API\nNetwork, the Orbit team will enable API distributors to grow their\ncommunities, increase usage of their APIs, and get feedback directly from\nusers on the network. Developers will be able to better discover APIs that\naddress their use cases and engage with their peers to make the most of each\nAPI. The current Orbit product will sunset over the next 90 days.\n\nThe future is API-first. Creating a place where users of public APIs can work\ntogether to improve API development is critical to getting there. We\u2019re beyond\nexcited about what this means for our customers on the network!\n\nTeam Orbit, welcome to Postman!\n\nAbhinav and Noah\n\nDon\u2019t forget to register here to attend POST/CON 24, Postman\u2019s biggest API\nconference ever: April 30 to May 1, 2024 in San Francisco.\n\n+13\n\nTags: API Network API-First Collaboration Community Company News Public\nWorkspaces\n\nAbhinav Asthana\n\nAbhinav is the co-founder and CEO at Postman.
