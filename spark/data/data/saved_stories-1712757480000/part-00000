I don't know Ben Brody.\"\n\nBrody's complaint alleged that Musk boosting a post linking him to the neo-\nNazi brawl has caused permanent reputational damage and severe emotional harm.\nBankston declined Ars' request to comment on whether Brody continues to be a\ntarget for harassment and death threats.\n\n\"People are attacked all the time in the media, online media, social media,\nbut it is rare that that actually has a meaningful negative impact on their\nlife,\" Musk said.\n\nBrody has asked Musk to delete his post, but Musk claims he cannot recall ever\nbeing asked. In one of the few times when Alex Spiro, Musk's attorney, advised\nMusk not to respond, Musk gave no answer when Bankston asked, \"If you knew\nright now\u2014knowing right now Ben is really upset that this tweet is still up\nand that he wanted there to be a retraction, how do you feel about that?\"\n\nBankston also confirmed that Musk's post never got fact-checked by Community\nNotes and thus appears to still be boosting the misinformation.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n157\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
