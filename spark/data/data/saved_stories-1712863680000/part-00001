It had a large FAQ, and the regulars regularly yelled at anyone who\nasked a question that was already answered. Understandable, because no one\nlikes repeating themselves. But beginners are the ones least able to grok that\nwhole thing, and beginners are the most likely to need help. The newsgroup set\nthemselves up to be not helpful to the people who most needed help.\n\n(Incidentally, the php.net site was great for help. There was a flat\ndiscussion under each function, sorted simply by most-recent-first, and\ngoddamn if that didn\u2019t answer most of my questions.)\n\nThen Stack Overflow came, and everyone moved there. The unhelpful \u201cread the\nFAQ. plonk\u201d comments disappeared under downvotes, and helpful comments were\nupvoted.\n\nAt some point that \u201chelpful\u201d vibe changed. Stack Overflow ceased being a\nquestion and answer site, and begun calcifying into a documentation site.\nQuestions are answered with \u201csee this other answer\u201d. There\u2019s less rudeness\nthan on usenet, but it\u2019s approaching the same unhelpfullness.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the fate of all Q&A sites to eventually become documentation sites.\nIf you answer the question \u201ccorrectly\u201d once, why bother repeating yourself?\n\nBut I think repetition of answers is healthy. It lets the next generation of\nprogrammers practice their ability to write clearly and answer questions. It\nlets them collect their upvotes and badges. It\u2019s good to have a healthy funnel\nwhere beginners learn how to ask questions, veterans learn how to write\nanswers, and super-veterans learn how to moderate.\n\nRead other posts\n\nA Diverse Engineering Team Means You Stop Losing Money \u2192\n\n\u00a9 Justin McGuire :: Theme made by panr\n\n", "frontpage": true}
