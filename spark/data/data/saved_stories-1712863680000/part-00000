According to a researcher who did most of\nhis work in the 1950s through1970s, it might include limitless food (of\ncourse!), multiple levels and secluded little rodent condos. These were all\npart of John Calhoun\u2019s experiments to study the effects of population density\non behavior. But what looked like rat utopias and mouse paradises at first\nquickly spiraled into out-of-control overcrowding, eventual population\ncollapse and seemingly sinister behavior patterns.\n\nThe mice were not nice.\n\nFor io9, Esther Inglis-Arkell writes about Calhoun\u2019s twenty-fifth habitat and\nthe experiment that followed:\n\n> At the peak population, most mice spent every living second in the company\n> of hundreds of other mice. They gathered in the main squares, waiting to be\n> fed and occasionally attacking each other. Few females carried pregnancies\n> to term, and the ones that did seemed to simply forget about their babies.\n> They'd move half their litter away from danger and forget the rest.\n> Sometimes they'd drop and abandon a baby while they were carrying it.\n>\n> The few secluded spaces housed a population Calhoun called, \"the beautiful\n> ones.\" Generally guarded by one male, the females\u2014and few males\u2014inside the\n> space didn't breed or fight or do anything but eat and groom and sleep. When\n> the population started declining the beautiful ones were spared from\n> violence and death, but had completely lost touch with social behaviors,\n> including having sex or caring for their young.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s experiments, which started with rats an outdoor pen and moved on to\nmice at the National Institute of Mental Health during the early 1960s, were\ninterpreted at the time as evidence of what could happen in an overpopulated\nworld. The unusual behaviors he observed he dubbed \"behavioral sinks.\"\n\nAfter Calhoun wrote about his findings in a 1962 issue of Scientific American,\nthat term caught on in popular culture, according to a paper published in the\nJournal of Social History. The work tapped into the era\u2019s feeling of dread\nthat crowded urban areas heralded the risk of moral decay \u2014 and events like\nthe murder of Kitty Genovese (though it was misreported) only served to\nintensify the worry. A host of science fiction works \u2014 books like Soylent\nGreen, comics like 2000AD \u2014 played on Calhoun\u2019s ideas and those of his\ncontemporaries. The work also inspired the 1971 children\u2019s book Mrs. Frisby\nand the Rats of NIMH, which was also made into a 1982 film The Secret of NIMH,\nnotes the National Institutes of Health.\n\nNow, interpretations of Calhoun\u2019s work has changed. Inglis-Arkell explains\nthat the habitats he created weren\u2019t really overcrowded, but that isolation\nenabled aggressive mice to stake out territory and isolate the beautiful ones.\nShe writes, \"Instead of a population problem, one could argue that Universe 25\nhad a fair distribution problem.\"\n\nBut we can take comfort in the face that humans are not mice. The NIH Record\nspoke to medical historian Edmund Ramsden about Calhoun\u2019s work:\n\n> Ultimately, \u201c[r]ats may suffer from crowding; human beings can cope,\"\n> Ramdsen says. \"Calhoun\u2019s research was seen not only as questionable, but\n> also as dangerous.\u201d Another researcher, Jonathan Freedman, turned to\n> studying actual people \u2014 they were just high school and university students,\n> but definitely human. His work suggested a different interpretation. Moral\n> decay could arise \u201cnot from density, but from excessive social interaction,\u201d\n> Ramsden says. \u201cNot all of Calhoun\u2019s rats had gone berserk. Those who managed\n> to control space led relatively normal lives.\u201d\n\nCalhoun\u2019s work didn\u2019t give us answers, but it is rare that any single study or\nseries of studies can draw definite conclusions. Instead we have ideas and\nsome strange footage of old experiments about mouse utopias:\n\nMouse Utopia Experiment\n\nWatch on\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nMaris Fessenden | | READ MORE\n\nMaris Fessenden is a freelance science writer and artist who appreciates small\nthings and wide open spaces.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
