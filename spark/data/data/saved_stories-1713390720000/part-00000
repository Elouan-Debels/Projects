The reason given is often that these other observations\ncannot be proven.\n\n> But when the McNamara discipline is applied too literally, the first step is\n> to measure whatever can be easily measured. The second step is to disregard\n> that which can't easily be measured or given a quantitative value. The third\n> step is to presume that what can't be measured easily really isn't\n> important. The fo[u]rth step is to say that what can't be easily measured\n> really doesn't exist. This is suicide.\n>\n> \u2014 Daniel Yankelovich, \"Interpreting the New Life Styles\", Sales Management\n> (1971)^[2]\n\nThe quote originally referred to McNamara's ideology during the two months\nthat he was president of Ford Motor Company, but has since been interpreted to\nrefer to his attitudes during the Vietnam War.\n\n## Examples in warfare[edit]\n\n### Vietnam War[edit]\n\nThe McNamara fallacy is often considered in the context of the Vietnam\nWar,^[3] in which enemy body counts were taken to be a precise and objective\nmeasure of success. War was reduced to a mathematical model: By increasing\nestimated enemy deaths and minimizing one's own, victory was assured.\nCritics^[who?] note that guerrilla warfare, widespread resistance, and\ninevitable inaccuracies in estimates of enemy casualties can thwart this\nformula. McNamara's interest in quantitative figures is seen in Project\n100,000: by lowering admission standards to the military, enlistment was\nincreased. Key to this decision was the idea that one soldier is, in the\nabstract, more or less equal to another, and that with the right training and\nsuperior equipment, he would factor positively in the mathematics of warfare.\n\nUS Air Force Brigadier General Edward Lansdale reportedly told McNamara,^[4]\nwho was trying to develop a list of metrics to allow him to scientifically\nfollow the progress of the war, that he was not considering the feelings of\nthe common rural Vietnamese people. McNamara wrote it down on his list in\npencil, then erased it and told Lansdale that he could not measure it, so it\nmust not be important.\n\n### Global war on terror[edit]\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense under George W. Bush, sought to\nprosecute wars with better data, clear objectives, and achievable goals.\nWrites Jon Krakauer:\n\n> ... the sense of urgency attached to the mission came from little more than\n> a bureaucratic fixation on meeting arbitrary deadlines so missions could be\n> checked off a list and tallied as 'accomplished'. This emphasis on\n> quantification has always been a hallmark of the military, but it was\n> carried to new heights of fatuity during Donald Rumsfeld's tenure at The\n> Pentagon. Rumsfeld was obsessed with achieving positive 'metrics' that could\n> be wielded to demonstrate progress in the Global War on Terror.\n>\n> \u2014 Jon Krakauer, Where Men Win Glory.^[5]\n\n## In modern clinical trials[edit]\n\nThere has been increasing discussion of the McNamara fallacy in medical\nliterature.^[6]^[7] In particular, the McNamara fallacy is invoked to describe\nthe inadequacy of only using progression-free survival (PFS) as a primary\nendpoint in clinical trials for agents treating metastatic solid tumors simply\nbecause PFS is an endpoint which is merely measurable, while failing to\ncapture outcomes which are more meaningful, such as overall quality of life or\noverall survival.\n\n## In competitive admissions processes[edit]\n\nIn competitive admissions processes\u2014such as those used for graduate medical\neducation^[8]\u2014evaluating candidates using only numerical metrics results in\nignoring non-quantifiable factors and attributes which may ultimately be more\nrelevant to the applicant's success in the position.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Allegory of the cave \u2013 Allegory by Plato\n  * Goodhart's law \u2013 Adage about statistical measures\n  * Metric fixation \u2013 Tendency for decision-makers to place excessively large emphases on selected metrics\n  * Newton's flaming laser sword \u2013 Verificationist principle\n  * Occam's razor \u2013 Philosophical problem-solving principle\n  * Streetlight effect \u2013 Observational bias from only searching where it is easiest to look\n  * Surrogation \u2013 Psychological phenomenon; replacement of a construct with its measurement\n  * Truth \u2013 Being in accord with fact or reality\n  * Verificationism \u2013 Philosophical doctrine\n  * Verisimilitude \u2013 Resemblance to reality\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Fischer, D.
