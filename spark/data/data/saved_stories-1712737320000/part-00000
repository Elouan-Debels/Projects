WIRED is\ntracking the major developments as they unfold.\n\nUpdated an hour ago, 01:54 AM\n\nThe United States government, like its rivals in Moscow and Beijing, has\npoured untold millions of dollars into quietly turning the phones and internet\nbrowsers of its own citizens into a powerful intelligence-gathering tool.\nShadowy deals between federal agencies and commercial data brokers have helped\nthe US intelligence system to amass a \u201clarge amount\u201d of what its own experts\nterm \u201cintimate information\u201d on Americans.\n\nMost US citizens are in the dark as to the true scope and scale of the\nsurveillance they\u2019re under.\n\nHouse speaker Mike Johnson\u2014whose brief tenure as speaker has been roiled by an\nongoing debate over domestic intelligence abuses\u2014previously supported several\nprivacy measures that, now in power, he is working to defeat, including strong\nnew limits on the government\u2019s access to private data.\n\nThis week, Johnson is working to resolve the lingering issue of reauthorizing\nSection 702, a key foreign surveillance program authorized by Congress to\ntarget terrorists, cybercriminals, and narcotics traffickers overseas. The\nprogram is set to officially expire on April 19.\n\nCongressional sources tell WIRED that a vote to salvage the program could come\nas early as Thursday, following a series of scheduled briefings on Tuesday and\nWednesday between lawmakers and intelligence officials, as well as a number of\nsmaller votes that may significantly modify the terms of the program for years\nto come.\n\nThe focus of privacy advocates has turned almost entirely to an amendment that\naims to force the FBI and other agencies to apply for a warrant before\naccessing the communications of Americans incidentally captured by the US\nunder the 702 program.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote over the 702 program is at least the third scheduled by the\nspeaker since December. As Johnson has in each case waited until the final\nmoment to delay the vote, a fog of uncertainty surrounds the whole of the\nprocess. Privately, lawmakers are discussing next steps should the speaker\ndecide to simply let the program expire, avoiding new statutory limits on the\ngovernment's most-prized surveillance weapon.\n\nTo keep pace with a situation that is sure to evolve rapidly over the next 48\nhours, WIRED will update this article with the latest details as they become\navailable. See below for the latest developments.\n\nDell Cameron\n\nan hour ago\n\n## 702's Next Steps\n\nThe House Rules Committee has reported a \u201cspecial rule\u201d that will be voted on\nby the full House of Representatives on Wednesday afternoon. Assuming the rule\nis approved by the House on Wednesday, each amendment will receive its own\nstandalone vote on Thursday, before all members vote on the 702 bill, in its\nentirety, as one package.\n\nA rule determines how much debate time is allowed before a vote and which\namendments will be offered up for consideration.\n\nThe report shows that, among other amendments, the House will consider whether\nto require the FBI to obtain a warrant before conducting \u201csearches of US\nperson communications in the FISA database\u201d\u2014the stickiest point in the\nnegotiations between privacy and security hawks, which have been ongoing now\nfor more than six months.\n\nThe amendment, introduced by Republican Andy Biggs, includes several\nexceptions designed to permit the FBI to freely investigate cyberattacks and\ndelay applying for a warrant when investigators discover an imminent threat of\ndeath or bodily harm.\n\nWIRED's coverage of Section 702's future will continue on Wednesday.\n\nDell Cameron\n\n4 hours ago\n\n## House Intel Chair Fires Back at Warrant Seekers\n\n\u201cWe are here,\u201d representative Mike Turner told the House Rules Committee,\n\u201cbecause the intelligence community failed us. The FBI failed us. The\nintelligence community failed to properly police themselves, and they abused\nthe tools that we gave them under FISA.\u201d\n\nTurner, the GOP chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, testified that,\nin his opinion, the underlying text of the bill was adequate to curb future\nsurveillance abuses by the FBI; that the abuses of the past had been the\nresult of mistakes made by \u201crank-and-file\u201d employees; and that the same\nmistakes could be reasonably avoided today by merely asking higher ranking\nofficers to sign off before granting access to wiretaps of Americans\u2019 calls\nand texts.\n\nThroughout his testimony, Turner discussed the 702 program in terms that\nfocused strictly on its use against terrorist organizations, at times implying\nthat only the communications of Americans in direct contact with foreigners\nwho \u201crepresent a national security threat to the United States\u201d are swept up\nby the program.\n\nIn fact, no foreigner is required to have ties to terrorism or be suspected of\na crime against the US to be considered a legitimate 702 target. Far less\ndiscerning, one of the stated purposes of the program is to gather information\nrelevant to the \u201cconduct of foreign affairs\u201d\u2014a phrase that legal experts\ncontend is so vague as to apply to \u201calmost any activity.\u201d\n\nDell Cameron\n\n5 hours ago\n\n## What Is Section 702?\n\nIn the wake of 9/11, US president George W. Bush authorized the National\nSecurity Agency (NSA) to eavesdrop on Americans without court-approved\nwarrants as part of the hunt for evidence of terrorist activity. A federal\njudge ruled the collection unconstitutional in 2006, as part of a lawsuit\nbrought by the American Civil Liberties Union. (An appeals court later\noverturned the ruling without challenging the case's merits.)\n\nRather than end the surveillance, Congress codified the program as Section 702\nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), granting itself some\nauthority to enforce procedures ostensibly designed to limit the program's\nimpact on Americans\u2019 civil liberties.\n\nSection 702 explicitly prohibits the government from targeting Americans. The\nsurveillance must instead focus on foreigners who are physically located\noverseas. Nevertheless, Americans\u2019 communications are routinely swept up by\nthe program.\n\nWhile denying that it intentionally sets out to eavesdrop on its own citizens,\nonce it has already done so, the US government\u2019s position is that it now has a\nright to access these \u201clegally collected\u201d communications without a judge\u2019s\napproval. In 2021 alone, the FBI conducted searches of communications\nintercepted under 702 more than 3.4 million times.\n\nLast year, after acknowledging that hundreds of thousands of these searches\nwere unlawful, the FBI said it had taken steps to curtail the number of\nqueries carried out by its employees, reporting in 2022 as few as 204,000\nsearches.\n\nIt is impossible to count the number of Americans whose calls, emails, and\ntexts are subject to surveillance under 702, the government claims, arguing\nthat any attempt to reach an accurate figure would only further imperil the\nprivacy of the Americans it surveils.\n\nCongress is currently divided into two factions: Those that believe the FBI\nshould be required to get a warrant before reading or listening to the\ncommunications of Americans collected under 702. And those who say warrants\nare too burdensome a requirement to impose on investigations of national\nsecurity threats.\n\nDell Cameron\n\n6 hours ago\n\n## Judiciary Leaders Call Out FBI\u2019s History of Abuse\n\nJim Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and a\nleading advocate for stronger privacy under 702 among conservatives, drew\nattention in his testimony Tuesday to the litany of surveillance abuses first\nreported by The Washington Post one year ago.\n\nCourt documents declassified and released by the FISA court last year found\nthat the FBI had misused the 702 program more than 278,000 times, including,\nas The Post reported, against \u201ccrime victims, Jan. 6 riot suspects, people\narrested at protests after the policing killing of George Floyd in 2020 and\u2014in\none case\u201419,000 donors to a congressional candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fundamental question, still, is if the FBI wouldn't follow the procedures\nin place 278,000 times ... are new requirements going to be enough to\nsafeguard American\u2019 liberties?\u201d Jordan says. \"When you have the history we\nhave with this organization, relative to not following the rules, we think you\nneed a separate but equal branch of the government to approve a warrant before\nyou can query American citizens' information.\u201d\n\nJarrold Nadler\u2014Jordan's Democratic counterpart on the Judiciary\u2014concurred,\ncalling even more emphatically on Congress to \u201crein in abuse of FISA Section\n702 authorities by the intelligence community.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there are already laws on the books to protect Americans from\nunauthorized government surveillance,\u201d says Nadler. \u201cBut we know from our\noversight efforts and the intelligence community's own reporting that these\nlaws are often disregarded and are at the very least inadequate to keep this\npowerful surveillance tool in check.\u201d\n\nDell Cameron\n\n7 hours ago\n\nThe House Rules Committee is currently holding a hearing that will determine\nwhat the final text of the 702-reauthorization bill will look like and which\namendments will be offered up for a vote on the House floor.\n\nBoth the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees are expected to offer up\nseveral amendments, with the latter aiming to impose new warrant requirements\non the FBI prior to querying the 702 database for information on Americans.\nWatch the hearing below:\n\n#### Content\n\nTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site\nit originates from.\n\nDell Cameron\n\n7 hours ago\n\n## Top Experts Say House Speaker\u2019s Bill Significantly Expands US Surveillance\n\nFew attorneys have ever appeared before the secret surveillance court\noverseeing the Section 702 program. Three of them just released their own\nanalysis of the reauthorization bill Speaker Johnson is putting up for a vote.\n\nThe bad news, they say, is that the bill still dramatically increases the\nnumber of companies that the US government can target under Section 702. This\nis despite a few \u201cmarginal\u201d improvements to the text since it was last\nintroduced.\n\nMarc Zwillinger, one of only a handful of lawyers to ever serve as an advisor\nto the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), first wrote about the\nlanguage in December, accusing the House Intelligence Committee (or HPSCI) of\nattempting to \u201csignificantly expand the government\u2019s authority under FISA 702\u201d\nby broadening the scope of businesses whose cooperation the government can\ncompel.\n\nEmails between House staff members obtained by WIRED show that HPSCI was\nprepared to introduce the same language in February before its chairman, Mike\nTurner, took steps to ensure the vote was called off.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zwillinger and coauthors Steve Lane and Jacob Sommor described the\nlatest version of the bill as a \u201cmarginal improvement\u201d but, nevertheless,\n\u201cproblematic.\u201d The main addition to the text is a list that excludes certain\ncategories of businesses from being compelled to cooperate with 702 demands,\nincluding \"dwellings, restaurants, and community facilities.\"\n\nZwillinger notes that this change may reduce the number of businesses the\ngovernment can target, but adds the need to include such a list at all only\nserves to demonstrate how the overall breadth of the program is being greatly\nexpanded.\n\nWIRED is where tomorrow is realized.
