The latest games to fit that bill are Duke Nukem 1 + 2 as\npart of the Duke Nukem Evercade Collection 1 where an amazing feat was pulled\noff by completely rewriting the engine to support smooth scrolling on the\nEvercade widescreen handheld. If you press SELECT, you can switch between\nclassic and modern modes, neatly highlighting the improvements. Here\u2019s a video\nI recorded for the review I wrote showcasing the effect:\n\nThe original source code has been lost for decades, but the initial DOS\nrelease never played smooth anyway: early PCs were never known to handle 2D\nsprite-based games as well as Nintendo\u2019s (S)NES family.\n\nHopefully Blaze Entertainment wants to keep on pursuing the direction of\nApogee game remakes. I know I\u2019ll buy them in a heartbeat. But what games from\nmy youth are already remade/remastered? I decided to compile a non-exhaustive\nlist for my fellow 80486 comrades; in case they would be willing to play any\nof these without that yellowed mechanical keyboard and DOS prompt. For me, the\njoy of using the original hardware is part of the gameplay fun, but sometimes,\nI just want to waste a bit of time from my couch using whatever handheld\ndevice lies nearest. Besides, these remakes introduce a whole new audience to\nthe great olds of yore.\n\nLet me know if I missed big ones. Wikipedia houses a game engine re-creations\nand a remakes and remastered listing, and I found this awesome game remakes\nlist on GitHub, but I\u2019m only interested in DOS games and preferably proper\nremakes instead of source ports (emphasized in bold).\n\n## Adventure games\n\n  * Monkey Island 1 & 2: Special Editions^1 on GOG/Steam.\n  * Day of the Tentacle: Remastered edition on GOG/Steam.\n  * Alone in the Dark: Reimagining on Steam, Free In the Dark source port on GitHub.\n  * Another World: HD 20th Anniversary Edition on Steam\n  * Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded is a complete remake of the first episode.\n  * Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Ed. on GOG\n  * Simon the Sorcerer: 25th Anniversary Edition versions with some interesting additions\n  * System Shock: Nightdive\u2019s 2023 masterful remake was a critically acclaimed hit\n  * Flashback: 25th Anniversary Edition on GOG or consoles.\n\n## Shooters\n\n  * Wolfenstein 3D: ECWolf source port with a much-needed automap\n  * Blake Stone: Unofficial source port on GitHub (Win binary released)\n  * DOOM: What device doesn\u2019t run a recent DOOM engine port?\n  * Duke Nukem 3D: it\u2019s even ported to the Nintendo Switch lately.\n  * Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition on GOG/Steam/Consoles.\n  * Quake: KEX Engine remaster on any platform.\n  * Star Wars: Dark Forces: Another Nightdive super-conversion\n  * Blood: Fresh Supply, yet another KEX win.\n  * Shadow Warrior: The Classic Redux version doesn\u2019t need an explanation\n\n## Platformers\n\n  * Duke Nukem 1 & 2: Remastered Evercade cart, see above\n  * Crystal Caves: HD Edition with level editor on GOG/Steam\n  * Secret Agent: HD Edition with level editor on GOG/Steam\n  * Monster Bash: HD Edition on GOG/Steam\n  * Jazz Jackrabbit: OpenJazz source port with increased resolution on GitHub\n  * Commander Keen games: Commander Genius source port on GitLab\n  * Cosmo\u2019s Comic Adventures: announced & on the way\n  * Lode Runner: Mad Monk\u2019s Revenge/The Legend Returns, a remake of the original\n  * Karateka: The Making Of Digital Eclipse docu-remaster, all platforms\n\n## Strategy\n\n  * Command & Conquer/Red Alert series: Remastered Collection on steam and OpenRA Engine available as well\n  * Dungeon Keeper: KeeperFX open source remake\n  * The Settlers II: 10th Anniversary remake on GOG\n\n## Role-playing\n\n  * The Bard\u2019s Tale I/II/III: The Bard\u2019s Tale Trilogy remake on GOG\n  * Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny 2013 Remake of the 1992 original\n  * Wasteland: There\u2019s a Remastered version that received mixed reviews\n\n  1.
