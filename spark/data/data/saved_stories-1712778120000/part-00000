A Kenyan Story to Inspire Your Startup\nJourney\n\nby Julia Yu\n\nNo Sex For Fish \u2014 this is written on the first slide of a Pitch Deck,\naccompanied by a photo of a dark-skinned woman (appearing to be from an ID\ndocument). The startup and its founder are from Kenya. And here's her\nincredible story.\n\nIn Kenyan villages, men own boats and engage in fishing. The culture does not\nallow women to own boats. Therefore, women buy fish from men to sell in the\nmarket. Since the 70s, the fish population has been declining due to\noverfishing and environmental issues. For many years, fishermen have yet to\ncatch enough fish to supply all the women. Fishermen began offering a service\nfor a service: give me sex, and I will ensure you get fish to sell.\n\nIn 2018, our heroine quit her job to help the women in her community\u2014teaching\nthem to fish cage farming and not depend on fishermen. But then she faced\nanother problem: a lack of affordable feed for the fish. Imported feeds were\navailable, but their cost was prohibitive for the community members. Then, the\nwomen began producing their own feed using local resources such as soy,\nsunflower, cassava, and corn.\n\nToday, they have over 3,000 regular customers, $120K in revenue, and 80 women\nsaved from sex for fish.\n\nIs your startup truly meaningful to your users?\n\nPicture a world where your product already exists. Are people crying tears of\njoy? How does your solution turn their frowns upside down compared to the Dark\nAges (aka now)?\n\nExamine how your target audience currently addresses the problem your product\nsolves and how your solution will alter their behavior or their experience.\nAnd don't forget \u2014 your solution isn't just about making things better; it's\nabout revolutionizing a process or life, not just improving it.\n\nPhoto credit: npr.org\n\nJulia Yu\n\nposted to\n\nIdeas and Validation\n\non April 8, 2024\n\nSay something nice to juliayu...\n\nPost Comment\n\n  1. 1\n\nGreat idea!\n\nAnton122\n\n\u00b7\n\nan hour ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n    1. 1\n\n\ud83d\ude4c\n\njuliayu\n\n\u00b7\n\n34 minutes ago\n\n\u00b7\n\nReply\n\n  2. 1\n\nInspirational!
