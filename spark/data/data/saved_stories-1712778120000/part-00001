One of them is indeed targeting Ada:\n\u201cLearn the NEW Structured Languages of the Future\u201d! This package includes an\nAda tutorial and a toolchain for the Commodore 64, written by Volker Sasse,\npublished by Abacus and distributed by Data Backer.\n\nI remember seeing this cover page before, but I didn\u2019t know it was a course\nfor the C64 and that there was a toolchain provided with it. Even though I\nnever owned a Commodore 64, and this package was released a couple of years\nbefore I was born, I enjoy looking at the early days of home computers. With\ntheir relative simplicity and direct access to the hardware, these systems\nspeak to my embedded engineer\u2019s heart.\n\nAfter a quick look at the manual I decided to give it a try using a C64\nemulator. How hard can it be?\n\nWell it\u2019s not too hard actually, but very slow that\u2019s for sure. I used the\nDenise emulator on Linux. Here is a screen capture of me writing and compiling\na \u201cHello World\u201d Ada program for the Commodore 64.\n\nThe video is 8 minutes long, but I sped up some sections. The time to write,\ncompile and run a hello world program is around 12 minutes. Every time you see\nme click on the left hand side of the screen, I am swapping the disk in the\nvirtual drive. On an actual C64 that would have been a lot more annoying of\ncourse.\n\nA few tips if you want to try it yourself on the Denise emulator:\n\n  * The key combination to type an underscore (\u201c_\u201d) in the editor is Commodore key + P. By default the Commodore key is mapped to the left control key on your keyboard.\n\n  * When typing a double quote in the editor, an up-arrow character is displayed. You can still compile and run the code like this, so it\u2019s probably just a display error in the editor.\n\n  * Typing on the spacebar on my keyboard didn\u2019t work with Denise. I had to map the space key to the left button of my mouse.\n\nKudos to the early hackers, programming was a different experience back then\n:)\n\nPosted in #Ada\n\n### About Fabien Chouteau\n\nFabien joined AdaCore in 2010 after his engineering degree at the EPITA\n(Paris).
