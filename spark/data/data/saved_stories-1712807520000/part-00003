However, there currently are no available treatment\noptions that regenerate damaged lung tissue.\n\n\"Most drugs act by slowing the progression of disease\u2014our approach is to make\ndrugs that control cell fate to stop or reverse the disease process,\" says\nPeter G. Schultz, Ph.D., co-senior author and the President and CEO of Scripps\nResearch.\n\nTo see whether existing drug mechanisms could increase growth of lung stem\ncells, the team turned to ReFRAME, a drug repurposing library built by Calibr-\nSkaggs. ReFRAME permits researchers to rapidly sort through thousands of\nexisting FDA-approved drugs and determine whether they could treat any other\nmajor diseases. This approach is particularly useful for cellular systems that\naren't easily amenable to large-scale screening campaigns.\n\n\"ReFRAME allowed us to understand what the target was immediately, to start\nunderstanding how that biology made sense in the context of the lung, and to\ntest the concept directly in vivo,\" says Bollong.\n\nUsing ReFRAME, the team\u2014which also includes Scripps Research and Calibr-Skaggs\nresearchers Sida Shao, Nan Zhang, Sean B. Joseph, Arnab K. Chatterjee and\nJeffrey Jian Chen\u2014determined that a drug class known as DPP4 inhibitors could\npotentially help activate production of lower airway stem cells, called type 2\nalveolar epithelial cells (AEC2).\n\nAlthough DPP4 inhibitors are often used as medications for type 2 diabetes to\ncontrol blood sugar, the researchers found that the inhibitors promoted\nproduction of AEC2 in mice with damaged lungs. However, the dose required when\nusing existing inhibitors for lung repair would be too high and unsafe for\nhumans, meaning it wouldn't be possible to directly repurpose approved\ninhibitors for clinical use, especially when used in combination with other\nanti-fibrotic drugs.\n\n\"To effectively repair the lungs, the dosing would be roughly 50 to 100 times\nas much, so we needed to make a drug that inhibited DPP4 in the lung only,\"\nexplains Bollong. \"That's why we went after a lung-targeted and lung-retained\napproach.\"\n\nBollong and his team developed NZ-97, a DPP4 inhibitor that persists in the\nlungs and promotes AEC2 growth in mice with lung damage. While NZ-97 is a\nprototype drug, it's chemically similar to CMR316, Calibr-Skagg's drug that\nwill be entering a phase 1 clinical trial in a few months.\n\nUnlike preexisting DPP4 inhibitors, CMR316 will be administered once weekly\nvia a nebulizer\u2014a machine that generates a medicinal mist to inhale\u2014so it's\ndelivered directly to the lungs. The research team also chemically modified\nthese agents to remain in the lungs for long periods, such that the drug\nselectively inhibits DPP4 only in this organ.\n\n\"What that ultimately allowed us to do is have a drug that could be\nadministered at very low doses,\" Bollong says. In fact, the projected dose for\nhumans is inhaling 1 mg to 2 mg over the span of a couple of minutes once per\nweek. \"People have been making DPP4 inhibitors for more than 20 years, so we\ncould leverage that known chemical matter to make a very good version of the\ndrug that's efficacious, lung retained and safe.\"\n\nBollong, Schultz, and the rest of the research team are hopeful that CMR316\nwill also be able to assist with lung damage from a range of other pulmonary\nillnesses, including influenza, COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease, the third leading cause of death around the globe, according to the\nWorld Health Organization.\n\n\"IPF makes the most sense as the first disease to investigate because it's\ndriven by a deficiency in this stem cell population,\" Bollong explains, adding\nthat NZ-97 showed generalizable efficacy across a wide array of lung damage\nmodels. \"What we also show in this paper is that we've taken stem cells from\nIPF patient donors and replenish their capacity to grow at an ex vivo format.\"\nThat's why NZ-97 is a key component in showing how CMR316 works from a\npharmacological perspective.\n\nWith CMR316 poised to enter the clinic shortly, the research team is also\nmoving forward compounds with novel mechanisms that help heart cells\nregenerate and repair damage from heart failure, as well as using small\nmolecule drugs to replenish cells in organs ranging from the cornea to the\nkidney to the colon.\n\nIn addition to Bollong and Schultz, authors of the study are Sida Shao, Nan\nZhang, Gregory P. Specht, Shaochen You, Lirui Song, Qiangwei Fu, David Huang,\nHengyao You, Alain Domissy, Shuangwei Li, Van Nguyen-Tran, Sean B. Joseph,\nArnab K.
