What is its output, what\nis its input, what are the conditions that it is in? What is the industry\nlike? Is it a fast-moving industry? Is it bureaucratic? Is it highly\nregulated? What kind of industry is it? And what are you trying to build?\u201d\n\nJensen Huang, on the importance of first principles thinking when creating and\nrunning a company.\n\nNVIDIA is the only chip company and one of the only large public technology\ncompanies that has been continuously led by a founder-CEO for over 3 decades\nsince its founding \u2013 and Jensen Huang is one of the longest serving technology\nCEOs in Silicon Valley1. Jensen rarely speaks publicly about his management\nphilosophy but in recent months, he gave a couple of candid interviews2 about\nhis leadership style and company culture. These interviews offer a direct view\nof his leadership philosophy and shed some light onto the culture of a unique,\nfounder-led company, which is now one of only 8 publicly traded companies to\ncross a market valuation of one trillion dollars. This essay summarizes the\nkey tenets of Jensen Huang\u2019s leadership philosophy, as distilled from his\ninterviews.\n\nThe idea for NVIDIA was conceived over breakfast in 1993 in this Denny\u2019s booth\nin San Jose, California.\n\n###\n\nDevelop and Trust Your Intuition\n\n> \u201cIf you work in a very technology driven industry, it is essential that you\n> understand the underpinnings of the technology so that you have an intuition\n> for how the industry is going to change. You need to have an intuition for\n> which one of the technologies is a bit of left turn and which one is\n> fundamental to realize that may be the early work we did with generative\n> adversarial models to variational auto encoders to diffusional models \u2013 they\n> were somewhat cousins of each other and that realizing the impact of one\n> could lead to breakthroughs in another which eventually opened up the\n> horizon for diffusion models which are utterly incredible.\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\nJensen talks about the importance of intuition, especially for leaders of\nfast-moving technology companies. Having an intuition for technology allows a\nleader to better extrapolate the future, which is essential because while\ntechnology changes very fast, it takes several years to build a great solution\nbased on that technology. Striking a balance between building something that\ntakes years to do while using technology that is changing by a factor of 1000\nevery few years \u2013 Jensen argues can only be done with an innate intuition,\ncuriosity and conviction that is essential to run a technology driven company.\n\nThanks for reading Bits and Bytes!

And if they are doing the same thing, then why are we doing\n> it? You know, why am I squandering the lives of these incredibly talented\n> people to go do something that's already been done? And so, we tend not to\n> go fight people for market share, fight people for markets that that that\n> are already commoditized and so, that's one way of thinking. To go do\n> something that's never been done before. The other way to demonstrate that\n> is to walk away from businesses that that have been commoditized. Either\n> through our own initiative or otherwise, we've walked away from many\n> businesses in the past and so that demonstrates very clearly to our\n> employees that we're not going to do commodity work and so the combination\n> of choosing the right work and walking away from the wrong work, that is the\n> best way...\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\nAvoiding commodity work is a core business principle for Jensen. He\nproactively focuses the company on something that has never been done before\nand proactively walks away from businesses that have already been\ncommoditized. This is a way to \u201cnaturally attract\u201d the most amazing people to\nthe company and also to make the best use of these talented employees and keep\nthem motivated to do their life\u2019s work at NVIDIA.\n\n###\n\nFlat org \u2013 40 Direct Reports and No 1:1s\n\n> \u201cA company's architecture should not be generic. Every company in the world\n> should not be built like the US military. And in fact, if you look at every\n> company's org chart in the world, they kind of look like the US\n> military...the number of direct reports of CEOs are very few and the number\n> of direct reports of the people who are just learning how to manage, the\n> first level managers are very large. It's exactly the opposite of how it\n> should probably be architected.\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\nJensen\u2019s guiding principle at NVIDIA is to keep the company as small as\npossible. This naturally requires him to empower people, which in turn\nnecessitates having a flat org structure. Jensen has ~40 direct reports,\nhighly unusual for a public company CEO. He does not have regularly scheduled\n1:1s with any of his staff.\n\n> \u201cI wanted a company that was smaller, not larger. You want a company that's\n> as small as possible, not as large as possible. It needs to be as large as\n> necessary to do the job well but should be as small as possible. And so\n> naturally you want to empower people. Well, if you want, if you want an\n> organization that obeys command and control, then you make it like a\n> pyramid, just like the military all the way back to the Roman Empire. But if\n> you want to empower people, then you want to make it as flat as possible so\n> that information travels quickly. In order to make something as flat as\n> possible, the first layer has to be well considered. Well, the first layer\n> happens to be the most senior people and you would think that they need the\n> least amount of management. None of my management team is coming to me for\n> career advice. They made it, and they're doing great. So, I have a whole lot\n> of people reporting to me because I don't need to do one on ones. I don't\n> have to do career coaching.\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\n###\n\nNo Business Units and No Divisions\n\n> \u201cWe don't have business units; we don't have divisions. Everybody works as\n> one. And the company is shaped in a way that allows us to build accelerated\n> computing best. If you ask me to go do fried chicken, we will have a hard\n> time doing fried chicken. But accelerated computing, we do very well.\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\n###\n\nNo Status Reports\n\n> \u201cWe don't do status reports. I don't read any status reports. And the reason\n> I don't is because status reports are meta-information by the time you get\n> them. They are barely informative. They have been distilled and refined and\n> bias has been inserted, perspective has already been added and you're not\n> looking at ground truth anymore. I tend to appreciate information that that\n> anybody presents. So, any employee can send out an e-mail called \u201cTop Five\n> Things\u201d and it can be just whatever happens to be their top five things,\n> whatever they observed or whatever they did or whatever they learned. If you\n> send it out, I will read it.\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\nJensen categorically refuses to read status reports. Instead, employees are\nencouraged to send out their list of \u201cTop Five Things\u201d summarizing information\nthat they want everyone including the CEO to know. Every morning, Jensen reads\nabout one hundred \u201cTop Five Things\u201d emails that are sent to him from people\nall across the company. He uses these emails to \u201cstochastically sample the\nsystem\u201d and get a feeling for whether the company is going in the direction he\nwants it to go. For example, Jensen looks out for whether employees\u2019 \u201cTop Five\nThings\u201d reflect real actions and execution (not just words) around the company\nstrategy. Jensen deliberately doesn\u2019t broadcast his own \u201cTop Five Things\u201d\nbecause if he did, he would be \u201ccontaminating the system\u201d. He keeps his list\nto himself.\n\n\u201cTop Five Things\u201d appears to be an informal variant of the more conventional\nOKRs (Objectives and Key Results). But it allows for quicker, stochastic, and\nmore real-time checks on the state of the organization.\n\n###\n\nNo 5 Year Plan; No 1 Year Plan; No Plan!\n\n> \u201cWe don't do a periodic planning system. And the reason for that is because\n> the world is a living, breathing thing. And so, we just plan continuously,\n> there's no five year plan, there\u2019s no one year plan. There\u2019s no plan!\n> There's just...what we're doing.\u201d\n\nJensen called out \u201cgiant five-year plans\u201d as \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d for\ntechnology companies, simply because technology is always evolving at a much\nfaster pace. Instead, Jensen advocates a \u201ccontinuous planning\u201d system where\nthe company is constantly observing and adapting to a fast-changing world.\nThis requires formulating a view of the world based on first principles\nthinking, trusting your intuition and acting with conviction. Along the way,\nif he realizes he is wrong, then he calls it out and changes course right away\n\u2013 as many times as necessary \u2013 in real time \u2013 he calls this ability to change\n\u201cthe beauty of modern leadership\u201d.\n\nWhat Jensen calls \u201ccontinuous planning\u201d is analogous to the \u201cObserve, Orient,\nDecide, Act\u201d (OODA loop) approach developed by US Air Force fighter pilot John\nBoyd. So long as your OODA loop is faster than your competitor\u2019s, you are\nlikely to come out ahead.\n\n###\n\nReason Out Loud with Employees\n\n> \u201cI spend a lot of time reasoning through my decisions, which empowers\n> employees because they learn how leaders think through problems. In every\n> meeting I'm in, I'm explaining how I think through the situation; let me\n> reason through this; let me explain why I did that; how do we compare and\n> contrast these ideas. That process of management I think is really\n> empowering.\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\nWhen asked about his leadership style and how it had evolved over time, Jensen\ncalled out being direct as a key attribute. If he doesn\u2019t like the way\nsomething is going, he likes to be direct and say it. He doesn\u2019t like to\nconvey his decisions via 1:1s or by taking individual employees aside; if he\nhas a different opinion, he just says it aloud in a group setting. The idea,\naccording to him is to ensure that everyone has all the context, all the time.\nHe proactively spends a lot of time reasoning through his decisions in group\nsettings so that employees understand and appreciate his thought process\nbehind important decisions.\n\n###\n\nAllow Information to Travel as Quickly as Possible\n\n> \u201cWe don't do just vice president meetings or just director or board\n> meetings. The meetings I have, there's new college grads in there. There are\n> people from every different organization. We are just all sitting in there.\n> You want the person who is most informed, or best skilled or just has the\n> most experience. They either made the mess, or they actually confronted the\n> situation. You want ground truth and experts, the best as you can.\u201d\n>\n> Jensen Huang\n\nJensen\u2019s approach is to communicate to all stakeholders at once so that there\nare no silos formed within the organization. His rationale is that once you\nhave a formulated a strategy, it doesn\u2019t make sense to tell just a few people\nabout it, he would rather tell everybody at once. He welcomes feedback from\nanyone and is open to refining his strategy. He believes there are very few\nsecrets at NVIDIA, and this is another way to empower employees and make them\nfeel valued.\n\nThanks for reading Bits and Bytes!
