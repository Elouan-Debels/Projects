They toss around \"Ashburn\" as if it were London or Tokyo, and often in\nthe same sentence. The reason why lies behind an Embassy Suites hotel in an\nunmarked complex of buildings owned by a company called Equinix. The Internet\nworks because every network is connected, somehow, to every other. Where do\nthose connections physically happen? More than anywhere else in America, the\nanswer is \"Ashburn.\" This is the bullseye of America's Internet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the hot June day I visited, a maintenance worker wearing a surgical mask\nswept the empty sidewalk. Jetliners buzzed by low overhead. Heavy-duty power\nlines hemmed in the horizon. I saw no proper entrance to speak of and no\nsigns, only blank steel doors that looked like fire exits. But the parking lot\nwas full, and I followed a guy into the security lobby of what turned out to\nbe the wrong building. When I finally found Dave Morgan, the director of\noperations for the complex, he saw no reason to apologize. On the contrary,\nconfusion was his goal: customers are reassured by the anonymity of the place\n\"except maybe on their first visit.\" Then he shared a handy tip for the next\ntime I found myself similarly lost on the way to the Internet: look for the\ndoor with the ashtray next to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI passed through three layers of security-biometric scanner, man-trap, steel\nmesh wall-and then it was like stepping into a machine, all rush and whir. The\nhigh ceiling was painted black, like a theater, and disappeared in the\ndimness. I faced a long aisle lined with darkened cages, each with a handprint\nscanner by the door. Blue spotlights created a repeating pattern of soft\nglowing orbs. \"It's a bit like Vegas,\" my guide, a \"recovering network\nengineer\" named Eric Troyer, said, \"no day or night.\"\n\nEquinix's customers are network operators of all sizes, from Verizon to\nTelecom Malaysia, Facebook to Wikipedia. They rent space here, ranging from a\nsingle rack to an apartment-sized suite. Some will ship their equipment ahead\nand pay to have it \"racked and stacked.\" Others, affectionately known as\n\"server huggers,\" spend their days here. \"They're locals, like Norm in Cheers,\npulling up his bar stool,\" Troyer said, nodding in the direction of a large\nguy in jeans and a black T-shirt. \"But this is not a resort destination.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEquinix Ashburn isn't a warehouse for data. It's a distribution depot, mostly\noccupied by networking equipment: machines in the exclusive business of\nnegotiating with other machines. A company like Facebook, eBay, or a large\nbank will have its own data center in the boonies-somewhere electric power is\ncheap and there's fiber in the ground. Then it will tether in here, spraying\nits data out from its own cage to the cages of Internet service providers and\nbackbone networks. (This is exactly what Facebook does.) The heavy-duty\nstorage happens elsewhere; the wheeling and dealing-the actual exchange of\nbits-happens here.\n\nThe Internet doesn't make itself. It is built on connections between networks\nagreed on with a handshake and consummated with the plugging in of a yellow\nfiber-optic cable. Technically, those connections could happen across any\ndistance. But it's more efficient to do it directly, plugging my box into your\nbox, in an exponentially repeating pattern. Equinix Ashburn satisfies that\nbasic economic and technical desire: it is cheaper and easier to connect two\nnetworks directly than to rely on a third network to do it for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen two networks want to connect to each other, they'll request a \"cross-\nconnect,\" and an Equinix technician will climb a ladder and unspool a yellow\nfiber-optic cable from one cage to the other. Laying cables is something of an\nart form, with different types placed at different layers, like a data center\nmille-feuille. The oldest cables are on the bottom of the pile. \"It's almost\nlike an ice core,\" Troyer said. \"As you dig down you're going to see sediment\nfrom certain time periods.\"\n\nGiven the monthly fee Equinix charges for each \"cross-connect,\" this is the\nbread and butter of the business. The bean counters see each one as monthly\nrecurring revenue. The network engineers see vectors. The data center techs\nsee the sore back they'll get reaching up to the racks to run the cables. But\nin the most tangible way possible, these cables, and this building, are the\nInter in Internet: the space in between.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEquinix Ashburn is the extreme logical opposite of the Internet's standard\nproposition: if most days we count on the Internet to let us be anywhere, this\nis the place where the Internet connects to the earth. It is the seam between\nthe global brain and the geologic crust.\n\nMap by Geo-Tel\n\nAn exclusive excerpt from Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet by\nAndrew Blum, published today by Ecco, an imprint of HarperCollins.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
