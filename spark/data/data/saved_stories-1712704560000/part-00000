The agreement, which was first proposed in June\n2023, could see the company pay out up to $12.5 billion (\u00a310 billion) by 2036.\nThe funds will enable PFAS remediation for public water suppliers that have\ndetected such chemicals or do so in the future.\n\n\u2018The final approval of this settlement and continued progress toward exiting\nall PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 will further our efforts to reduce\nrisk and uncertainty as we move forward,\u2019 stated chief executive Mike Roman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuPont de Nemours and its spinoffs Chemours and Corteva agreed a separate $1.2\nbillion agreement in February 2024, covering PFAS contamination claims from\npublic water systems in South Carolina.\n\nRebecca Trager\n\n  * Follow\n\nRebecca became the US Correspondent for Chemistry World in September 2014,\nbased out of Washington, DC, after writing for the magazine on a freelance\nbasis since 2007.View full profile\n\n## More from Rebecca Trager\n\n  * ## Using analytical chemistry to illuminate the unlisted ingredients in tattoo inks\n\n  * ## $6.6 million settlement follows 2019 fire at Texas petrochemical facility\n\n  * ## US government scientists follow academics in unionising for better conditions\n\n## Topics\n\n  * 3M\n  * Business\n  * Contamination\n  * Environmental\n  * Fine and speciality chemicals\n  * Government\n  * Legal\n  * North America\n  * PFAS\n  * Pollution\n  * Regulation\n  * Remediation\n  * United States of America\n  * Water\n\n  * No comments\n\n  * Bookmark\n\nPlease Sign in to your account to use this feature\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * Feature\n\n### The chemists dedicated to making drinking water safer\n\n25 March 2024 14:03\n\nBy Julia Robinson\n\n  * Business\n\n### UN human rights experts condemn DuPont and Chemours\n\n1 March 2024 13:00\n\nBy Rebecca Trager\n\n  * Research\n\n### PFAS contamination in Mersey basin among highest in the world, study\nsuggests\n\n27 February 2024 09:46\n\nBy Julia Robinson\n\n  * Business\n\n### 3M pledges to exit PFAS manufacturing\n\n6 January 2023 14:43\n\nBy Rebecca Trager\n\n  * Business\n\n### $6.6 million settlement follows 2019 fire at Texas petrochemical facility\n\n8 April 2024 14:02\n\nBy Rebecca Trager\n\n  * News\n\n### US government scientists follow academics in unionising for better\nconditions\n\n5 April 2024 12:00\n\nBy Rebecca Trager\n\n### No comments yet\n\nYou're not signed in.
