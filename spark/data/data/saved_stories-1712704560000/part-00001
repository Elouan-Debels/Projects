The\ninterdisciplinary project has resulted in the successful encryption and\nsubsequent decryption of a Confucius proverb in both Unicode and Zh\u00e8ng M\u0103\nusing sequence-defined polymers.^1\n\nDNA, the most famous naturally occurring information storage polymer, stores\nvast amounts of genetic information in a comparatively small volume using four\nnucleotide bases. Inspired by the storage capacity of DNA, chemists have begun\nto examine other sequence-defined polymers for storing data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, a team led by Eric Anslyn from the University of Texas at Austin\nencoded a passage from Jane Austen\u2019s Mansfield Park in hexadecimal using\nsequence-defined oligourethanes.^2 These oligourethanes were then iteratively\ndegraded using 5-exo-trig cyclisation and read using liquid\nchromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) to retrieve the hexadecimal code,\nwhich was then translated back into the original passage.^3\n\n  * Previous\n  * Next\n\nThe team chose to encode an eight-character proverb from the Analects of\nConfucius\n\nA library of 16 different commercially available mass-separated terminal\nalkynes was used to represent the proverb in Unicode\n\nSource: \u00a9 Eric V Anslyn/University of Texas at Austin\n\nzoom inzoom out\n\nA library of 26 different commercially available terminal alkynes was used to\nrepresent the proverb in Zh\u00e8ng M\u0103\n\nSource: \u00a9 Eric V Anslyn/University of Texas at Austin\n\nzoom inzoom out\n\n1/3\n\nhide caption\n\nNow, the team has turned its attention from alphanumeric languages to\nlogographic script. \u2018[We] decided to explore other language forms and chose\nMandarin as a paradigmatic example of logographic symbology. But to do so, we\nfelt a collaboration with linguistic experts would create a thorough and\nsophisticated analysis,\u2019 says Anslyn. To evaluate a suitable method to\naccurately encode a well-known Confucian proverb, Anslyn\u2019s group teamed up\nwith Danny Law\u2019s team from the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s department of\nlinguistics. Together they translated the proverb into both Unicode (base-16)\nand Zh\u00e8ng M\u0103 (base-26); the latter being well suited to encoding the\ncomplexity of symbolic Chinese language, producing codes up to 4 letters long.\n\nWhile the Mansfield Park study relied on synthesising and purifying individual\nmonomers, the new project removed this aspect by using solid-phase synthesis\nto create a repeating oligourethane backbone containing azide groups. Using\ncopper-catalysed azide-alkyne click chemistry, the team added commercially\navailable alkynes on to the oligourethane backbone. Each alkyne molecule\nrepresents a letter, encoding the information here rather than in the\noligourethane backbone.\n\n\u2018What I really like is that this is a collaboration between linguists and\nchemists, and they\u2019ve really put their minds together,\u2019 remarks Christopher\nBarner-Kowollik, a polymer chemist from Queensland University of Technology in\nAustralia. \u2018How does the coding need to look so that, in this example, we can\ncode the content of Chinese or Japanese characters. I find that utterly\nfascinating.\u2019\n\nSource: \u00a9 Eric V Anslyn/University of Texas at Austin\n\nThe team showed how Unicode (left) and Zh\u00e8ng M\u0103 (right) could encode Chinese\ncharacters into an oligourethane\n\nzoom inzoom out\n\nAnslyn\u2019s team\u2019s method for chemically encoding information can potentially\nwork for any language. Expanding the library of monomers would accommodate\ndifferent codes with increasing numbers of bases. \u2018The biggest advance is to\nbring other disciplines into the arena of sequence-defined polymers,\u2019 Anslyn\nasserts. \u2018We feel that the tie to linguistics creates new affordances for\nsequence-defined polymers, that we are pursuing and that we hope inspires\nothers to pursue.\u2019\n\n### References\n\n1 L Zhang et al, Chem.
