That cataclysmic collapse triggered a rush of political and economic maneuvering in the U.S. (a key wood pellet producing nation), and in Europe (a primary industrial biomass energy user in converted coal plants).\n  * While Enviva publicly claims it will survive the bankruptcy, a whistleblower in touch with sources inside the company says it will continue failing to meet its wood pellet contract obligations, and that its production facilities \u2014 plagued by chronic systemic manufacturing problems \u2014 will continue underperforming.\n  * Enviva and the forestry industry appear now to be lobbying the Biden administration, hoping to tap into millions in renewable energy credits under the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 a move environmentalists are resisting. In March, federal officials made a fact-finding trip to an Enviva facility and local communities who say the firm is a major polluter.\n  * Meanwhile, some EU nations are scrambling to find new sources of wood pellets to meet their sustainable energy pledges under the Paris agreement. The UK\u2019s Drax, an Enviva pellet user (and also a major pellet producer), is positioning itself to greatly increase its pellet production in the U.S. South and maybe benefit from IRA subsidies.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing in March by Maryland-based Enviva \u2014 the world\u2019s largest\nmaker of wood pellets from forest biomass \u2014 is rattling a European Union that\nrelies heavily on biomass as a significant though contested renewable energy\nsource.\n\nThe bankruptcy is also invigorating U.S. forest advocates determined to keep\nthe Biden Administration from using new renewable energy credits to bail out\nthe flailing company. On March 21, officials from five federal agencies\nvisited North and South Carolina to see an Enviva pellet-making plant\nfirsthand and hear environmental justice complaints over the impacts it is\nhaving on low-income communities.\n\nBut the company faces immediate threats to its ongoing viability that\ntranscend its $2.6 billion debt and negative community impacts, according to a\nformer maintenance manager at two Enviva pellet-making plants in North\nCarolina and Virgina between 2020 and 2022, and an exclusive Mongabay source.\n\nAs many as eight of Enviva\u2019s 10 pellet mills in the U.S. Southeast, he said,\nare in such poor condition that they are producing fewer pellets monthly at a\nmuch higher cost due to intractable and costly maintenance issues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way Enviva is coming out of Chapter 11,\u201d the former employee told\nMongabay, referring to a court-ordered reorganization process by which the\nfirm has a set time to restructure its debt and begin paying back creditors.\n\u201cTheir manufacturing equipment is not fit for the service it\u2019s required to\ndeliver. Only two of its 10 plants (one in Florida, one in Georgia, neither\nbuilt by Enviva) are hitting their maximum achievable targets for pellet\nproduction.\u201d\n\nWood chips piled in mounds more than 6 meters (20 feet) high cover the lot of\nthe Enviva wood pellet plant in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Image by Justin\nCatanoso for Mongabay.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey also are not replacing equipment at the plants with the\nmaterials that will fix the problems. Plants keep going out of service for\ndays at a time, and Enviva keeps spending millions to patch them up. Every ton\nof pellets they produce is at a loss. The more they produce, the more money\nthey lose.\u201d\n\nThese observations are reflected in Enviva\u2019s public statements: In its March\n13 bankruptcy filing, the company said it shipped 5 million metric tons of\npellets overseas in 2023. That\u2019s down from 6.2 million metric tons shipped in\n2022, a 19.3% decrease at a time when demand for wood pellets in Europe and\nAsia was increasing.\n\nAlso, in its last quarterly filing with the US Securities and Exchange\nCommission in November, Enviva wrote that $21.1 million of its $85.2 million\nin third quarter losses, or 25%, was attributed to \u201casset impairments,\u201d which\nin accounting jargon means damaged equipment and machinery. This heavy\nexpenditure on constant maintenance continues.\n\n### Carbon versus stainless steel\n\nInterim CEO Glenn Nunziata is putting a bright face on the bankruptcy\npublicly: \u201cWe look forward to emerging from this process as a stronger company\nwith a solid financial foundation,\u201d he said recently.\n\nBut here\u2019s the crux of the problem, yet unaddressed by Enviva: Most Enviva\nproduction facilities are built with carbon steel, which is less expensive\n(though less durable) than stainless steel, explained the former employee, who\nremains in close touch with plant management inside the company.\n\nWhen it built its plants, Enviva planned to mostly use hardwood trees to make\npellets. But when the price of hardwood rose sharply, the firm to control\ncosts shifted to processing 80% pine and 20% hardwoods, instead of the\nopposite. But pine resins and added moisture quickly corroded and degraded the\ncarbon steel equipment, especially in Southampton, Virginia, a plant Enviva\nsaid it has partially shuttered. Its four plants in North Carolina must also\nnow close several times a year for maintenance, thus reducing annual\nproduction.\n\n\u201cThose plants need to be rebuilt with stainless steel, but that comes with a\nhuge cost,\u201d said the former employee, who declined to be named for reasons of\nfamily and professional privacy. \u201cThese plants are wearing down at an alarming\nrate. And the more pine they push through, the faster it wears. Maintenance\ncosts keep piling up.\u201d\n\nEnviva has been counting on two enormous new plants in the Deep South to\ncounter the lag in pellet production. But Nunziata said the company cannot\nafford to continue building in Bond, Mississippi, though it intends to restart\nconstruction in Epes, Alabama.\n\nEnviva did not respond to requests for comment on its bankruptcy or the\ncondition of its manufacturing facilities.\n\nFelled hardwood and pine cut from a dense forest and piled high on a 52-acre\nlot in Edenton, North Carolina. The trees were later ground into wood chips,\nloaded into trucks and moved to the Enviva pellet plant in Ahoskie, North\nCarolina. Enviva had planned to use mostly hardwoods to supply its Southeast\nU.S. pellet mills, but company insiders say the current mix is 80% pine and\n20% hardwood, with pine resin and moisture damaging facility machinery.

In April 2022, the public\ncompany\u2019s share price peaked at $87 a share; the firm then was valued at $3.5\nbillion.\n\nAfter a disastrous 2023, in which revenue plunged and losses totaled hundreds\nof millions, Enviva\u2019s stock price tanked again and again. It is now trading at\nunder 50 cents a share and the company is valued at just $34 million. As a\ndirect result, a class action investor lawsuit against Enviva is advancing in\nMaryland district court.\n\nForest advocates are feeling vindicated: \u201cYears of deceiving customers,\ndestroying forests and polluting communities has finally caught up to Enviva,\u201d\nsaid Danna Smith, executive director of Dogwood Alliance, a North Carolina-\nbased NGO. \u201cIn the process, millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted. Our\ngovernment must not give one more dime to this failing, dirty industry.\u201d\n\nBut that potential exists. Under President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act\n(IRA), billions in tax credits and subsidies are available to producers of\nclean energy, like wind and solar energy companies. Millions are also\navailable for forest industry innovations.\n\nTractor-trailers each loaded with 40 tons of wood chips waiting at Enviva\u2019s\npellet mill in Ahoskie, North Carolina, which opened in 2011. \u201cThere\u2019s no way\nEnviva is coming out of Chapter 11, [bankruptcy]\u201d a former Enviva employee and\nwhistleblower told Mongabay. \u201cTheir manufacturing equipment is not fit for the\nservice it\u2019s required to deliver. Only two of its 10 plants (one in Florida,\none in Georgia, neither built by Enviva) are hitting their maximum achievable\ntargets for pellet production.\u201d Image courtesy of Bobby Amoroso.\n\nBiomass industry groups, on behalf of Enviva and other domestic pellet makers,\nare now actively pushing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other\nfederal agencies to recognize wood pellets as a renewable energy source\nlargely because trees can be regrown.\n\nWood pellets enjoy that renewable-energy designation in the EU and United\nKingdom, which provide billions in subsidies for pellets which are claimed to\nproduce zero carbon emissions. However, a host of scientific studies offer\nconvincing evidence that burning forest biomass is not a climate solution, and\nproduces rather than reduces heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. Studies\nshow that wood pellets actually emit more carbon dioxide per unit of energy\nthan burning coal.\n\nAccording to environmental groups, Enviva is seeking subsidies under the IRA\nfrom the Department of Energy and Treasury Department to help pay for its new\nplant in Alabama and restart construction in Mississippi \u2014 plants with the\npotential to each make 1 million tons of pellets annually, far more than\nexisting plants.\n\nU.S. Representative Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, told Mongabay she\ndoes not want to see that happen.\n\nU.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, was one of six members of\nCongress who wrote to the Biden administration in January arguing that\nextensive scientific evidence concludes that burning forest biomass for energy\nis not a legitimate climate solution, so should not qualify for renewable\nenergy tax credits or subsidies. Image courtesy of the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives.\n\n\u201cIndustrial wood pellet production pollutes communities where plants are\nlocated and contributes to deforestation in North Carolina\u2019s prized\nwoodlands,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat a giant corporation would need public money to\nmaintain its solvency speaks to the make-or-break nature of public investments\nand incentives and underscores that public funding ought to go to proven\nclimate solutions, not half-measures.\u201d\n\nAdams was among six members of Congress who wrote to Energy Secretary Jennifer\nGranholm and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Daniel Werfel in January\nemphasizing the science that discredits the climate-friendly claims of biomass\nenergy advocates. The letter called for the rejection of all applications for\nindustry tax credits.\n\nBiomass, though, has plenty of congressional allies, especially in forested\nstates such as Maine, Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. The EPA \u2014 which has\nlong deflected pressure to designate biomass as renewable or climate friendly\n\u2014 is currently producing a study to determine the environmental and social\nimpact of the wood pellet industry in the U.S.\n\nMap showing current and proposed wood pellet plants exporting to Europe. The\nwoody biomass industry is exploding in size in the U.S. Southeast, but the\nBiden administration has so far remained silent on its policy toward the\nunregulated business. According to environmental groups, Enviva is seeking\nfederal subsidies under Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to help pay for\nits new $375 million plant in Epes, Alabama and restart construction on its\nlarge facility near Bond, Mississippi.

For years, those\nadvocates largely assisted their overseas counterparts in lobbying to change\nEU and UK bioenergy policy, though with little success.\n\n\u201cWe know these new U.S. subsidies are appealing to the biomass industry,\u201d said\nAdam Colette, a program manager with Dogwood Alliance. \u201cAs forest campaigners,\nwe\u2019re now telling officials in Washington, \u2018Let\u2019s not make the same mistake as\nEurope.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Colette was among several environmental hosts to meet with Biden\nadministration officials in North and South Carolina on March 21.\nRepresentatives from the EPA, the departments of Justice, Agriculture and\nEnergy and the president\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality toured an Enviva\nplant. Later, they met with leaders in local communities who have long argued\nthat Enviva is contributing to public health harms through air pollution,\nclearcut logging and truck traffic.\n\n\u201cA goal of the visit was to show the impact the industry has on communities\nwhere they operate,\u201d Colette said. \u201cWe commend the Biden administration for\nits support of environmental justice communities. These communities on the\nfrontlines of industrial logging have suffered the consequences for too long.\nAnd if it\u2019s not Enviva, its going to be someone else down the road.\u201d\n\nNearly all Enviva plants are located in some of the poorest counties in the\nstates in which they operate.\n\nImported wood pellets waiting to be burned at Drax, a former coal burning\npower plant converted to forest biomass in the UK; it is one of the world\u2019s\nlargest wood-burning energy facilities. Drax is also a major wood pellet\nproducer, with manufacturing plants in the U.S. Southeast and British\nColumbia. It is currently pursuing plans for two new plants in central\nCalifornia. Image by DECCgovuk via VisualHunt (CC BY-ND).\n\n### Bankruptcy\u2019s overseas impact; Drax lurking\n\nEnviva\u2019s bankruptcy is also being felt throughout the EU and UK, which\nreceives the bulk of the company\u2019s overseas exports. Officials there rely on\nburning biomass to claim alleged emission reductions against their Paris\nAgreement pledges; given a renewable energy designation, biomass smokestack\nemissions are not counted.\n\nBurning wood currently makes up 60% of the EU\u2019s renewable energy mix \u2014 though\nthe emission cuts claimed for wood exist only on paper not in reality, say\nenvironmental analysts.\n\nWith Enviva\u2019s dramatic drop in production, countries such as the Netherlands,\nDenmark and the United Kingdom, which depend heavily on Enviva pellets, are\nnow facing uncertain supplies.\n\n\u201cThis bankruptcy is very damaging to the entire biomass industry and the\ngovernments that depend on biomass,\u201d Fenna Swart, a forest advocate with the\nClean Air Committee in the Netherlands, told Mongabay. \u201cIf this changes the\nenergy market, this is a huge problem across the EU. There appear to be few\nplaces to fill any [supply] gaps left by Enviva.\u201d\n\nEU forest advocates are renewing their lobbying of policymakers, urging them\nto turn away from wood pellets, but Swart confirmed that no nation has\nindicated any intention to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, in yet another financial blow to Enviva, the company appears to\nhave lost one of its biggest customers in Europe, RWE. The Germany-based\nenergy company has long been an Enviva trading partner, importing some 2.5\nmillion tons of pellets annually primarily underwritten by billions in\nsubsidies from the Netherlands to be burned in Dutch facilities.\n\nBecause of unfulfilled contracts and the declining value of pellets on the\nopen market, RWE has canceled its long-term agreements with Enviva and is\ndemanding damages of more than $370 million. Enviva is reportedly refusing to\npay.\n\nQuestions also abound now about UK-based Drax, which operates one of the\nworld\u2019s largest wood-burning facilities and which is also an expanding wood\npellets producer. It has manufacturing plants in the U.S. Southeast and\nBritish Columbia, and is pursuing plans for two new plants in central\nCalifornia against growing opposition.\n\nDrax is a major buyer of Enviva pellets for its energy plant in North\nYorkshire, England. While Drax isn\u2019t commenting, the company is organizing a\nU.S. headquarters in Texas. Forest advocates believe it, like Enviva, will\nseek U.S. tax support to underwrite its Deep South expansion.\n\nWith so much volatility in the biomass industry today, questions are mounting\nfaster than answers. Can Enviva survive? Can Drax expand quickly enough in the\nU.S. to fill a potential 5-million-ton pellet gap and maintain UK subsidies?\nWill Russian wood pellets (banned due to its war with Ukraine), find their way\nback into the EU? Will the U.S. embrace biomass energy and subsidies like its\noverseas allies? And will the industry continue to grow, contributing\nsignificantly to climate change, or will it, like Enviva, implode?\n\n\u201cThis bankruptcy reinforces the idea that there are no answers yet regarding\nthe future viability of biomass for energy,\u201d Swart said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great\ntime to be asking these questions.\u201d\n\nBanner image: Wood pellets for biomass energy.
