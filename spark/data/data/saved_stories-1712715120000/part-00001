One New York City Audubon volunteer\nlooks to the past to find hope for the future.\n\nPalabras de Melissa Breyer\n\nContributor, Audubon magazine\n\nFotograf\u00eda por Sydney Walsh\n\nNetwork Photographer\n\nPublished Spring 2024\n\nVisita la p\u00e1gina Usted es la imagen de la esperanza\n\nUsted es la imagen de la esperanza\n\nSalve a las aves y sus h\u00e1bitats con una donaci\u00f3n a Audubon.\n\nDona\n\nOne of New York City\u2019s little-known and mostly unseen wonders is that, in the\ndark of night during spring and fall, millions of birds fly directly over\nManhattan on a migration path that their ancestors have been traveling for\nmillennia. For some, the journey stops short here: Astonishingly, the city\nsees nearly 250,000 bird deaths from collisions with glass every year.\n\nAs a bird enthusiast, I knew that the city\u2019s position on the Atlantic Flyway\nmakes it a risky place\u2014that the built environment and a preponderance of glass\ncreate a dystopian house of mirrors for migrants drawn in and disoriented by\nelectric lights. But I didn\u2019t grasp the problem\u2019s scale until, in 2020, I\nstumbled across a photo on social media of 26 birds that struck one building\nin a single morning. In an instant, the abstract idea of window collisions\nbecame concrete. I couldn\u2019t remain a passive witness.\n\nThat fall, I began volunteering to log collisions with New York City Audubon\u2019s\nProject Safe Flight. Started in 1997, the community science initiative puts\nboots on the ground during migration season to record birds injured or killed\nby window strikes. As with similar efforts around the country, trained\nvolunteers walk prescribed routes at deadly hotspots citywide to collect\ncomprehensive data about the victims they encounter. NYC Audubon uses the\ninformation to support advocacy, legislation, and research.\n\nWhen I first started leaving my house before dawn to comb the sidewalks around\na cluster of buildings in downtown Manhattan, I was optimistically naive. I\nimagined Disney princess moments of swooping in to rescue injured warblers and\nsparrows. The actual narrative was much darker.\n\nAudubon spent a day shadowing Project Safe Flight volunteers in spring 2023.\nRead more about our day behind the scenes.\n\nThough the city is barely simmering when I start, each morning is hectic: a\nrace against building staff who sweep up evidence of window strikes and an\nawakening surge of cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, as well as hungry\nsquirrels, gulls, and curious dogs. Searching sidewalks, awnings, and streets,\nI place injured birds in individual paper bags and collect dead birds in\nanother sack. When I\u2019m done, I take a 30-minute subway ride to drop off\npatients at Wild Bird Fund, the city\u2019s only wildlife rehabilitation clinic,\nbefore heading back downtown to start my workday (my office is housed in one\nof the very buildings I monitor). Unfortunately, roughly 7 out of 10 birds I\nfind are dead, and many I rescue eventually succumb to injuries.\n\nLike other collision monitors I know, I now have dozens of slow-motion scenes\netched in my memory. I see the Northern Flicker cartwheeling through the air\nto the pavement, shuddering, and then dying in my hands. I replay the giant\nlump of a Chuck-will\u2019s-widow, a near-threatened oddity I never expected to\nobserve alive in the woods, let alone dead in downtown Manhattan on a cool\nApril morning. I rewind my recollections to see a squirrel devouring a stunned\nwarbler, and the aghast face of a pedestrian as she registers that she just\nkicked a songbird down the sidewalk.\n\nYet no scene haunts me more than that of September 14, 2021. Until then, I had\ncollected at most a handful of birds along any single facade. As I exited the\nsubway that morning, I saw dark shapes in every direction from half a block\naway, as if someone had strewn sacks of birds across the sidewalks. I\u2019m not\neasily rattled, but for the first 10 minutes, all I could do was murmur, \u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d as my trembling hands scooped up carcasses. Across four World Trade\nCenter towers, over a 92-minute whirlwind, I picked up 229 dead birds\n(primarily warblers), photographed another 40 on out-of-reach awnings, and\ncollected 29 birds with injuries. Reports indicate that my tally was just a\nfraction of the citywide toll, all victims of what I learned was an\nunfortunate confluence of conditions: stormy, low-visibility weather; a heavy\nmigration pulse; and brightly lit buildings serving as lethal beacons in the\ndark.\n\nB\n\nack home, in a surreal stupor, I shared my photos and a video to social media,\nthinking local birders might see them. Instead, local, national, and\ninternational media picked them up, making my day one of the most publicized\nmass-collision events in recent New York City history. My online followers\nsurged, and the rest of September became a blur of interviews. I\u2019d\nunintentionally become a spokesperson for the issue, though I was far from an\nexpert. At some point during the commotion, a friend at the Wildlife\nConservation Society sent me an account detailing a similar event that they\u2019d\ncome across\u2014only this mass collision had occurred 135 years earlier.\n\nI was perplexed. I thought bird strikes were a modern issue, born of our love\nof glassy skyscrapers and bright cities. I wanted to know more about the\norigins and evolution of the city\u2019s collision problem, and I figured diving\ninto the past might also help me grapple with the emotional impact of the work\nand make me a better advocate.\n\nI turned to Dustin Partridge, director of conservation and science at NYC\nAudubon, to understand why birds are drawn to this urban expanse in the first\nplace. He helped me picture my lower Manhattan route as it existed centuries\nago: a thick stand of hickory and chestnut trees amid a rich mix of waterways,\nwetlands, and upland habitats. Birds stopped to rest and refuel on their\nmigratory journeys, which they navigated with the help of the planet\u2019s\nmagnetic field, as well as the moon, stars, and landscape features illuminated\nin the otherwise pitch-dark night. It\u2019s just bad luck for birds that cities\ntend to develop in biodiversity havens. \u201cThe same things that make a landmass\nor an area good for people are also usually good for birds,\u201d Partridge says.\n\u201cThese long-term routes are ingrained over millennia...they are not just going\nto stop flying along the flyway because the city is here.\u201d\n\nIn fact, because of our lights, the modern city may attract a higher density\nof migrants today than the area did centuries ago. Scientists still don\u2019t know\nexactly why artificial illumination entices and disorients birds, says Andrew\nFarnsworth, a migration ecologist and visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of\nOrnithology, but the answer is likely buried deep in evolutionary history.\nWhat has never been a mystery is that our illuminated cities coupled with man-\nmade structures make a fatal combination: Our bright skies draw in wild birds,\nand the hazards we\u2019ve erected kill them.\n\nEarly reports of avian collisions in North America date back to oil-fueled\nlighthouses in use well before the advent of electricity. But when Thomas\nEdison famously electrified lower Manhattan with incandescent bulbs in 1882,\nhe sealed a grim fate. Four years later, the Statue of Liberty opened and\nbegan operating as the country\u2019s first electric lighthouse. Her illuminated\ntorch, poised 305 feet above sea level, was a beacon for passing ships and a\nlure for passing birds. For years, reports poured in of disoriented birds that\neither collapsed from exhaustion or collided with the structure (including the\nmass-collision event my friend had sent me). However, \u201cthanks to the protests\nof bird lovers and especially half-dazzled pilots of passing vessels,\u201d as\nnaturalist William Beebe later wrote, Lady Liberty\u2019s lights were eventually\nadjusted some decades later and collisions subsided.\n\nEven as that landmark\u2019s threat diminished, many more bright lights rose to\nfill the darkness as new technologies allowed architects to design taller\nbuildings. Opened in 1931 and topped with a searchlight shortly after, the\nEmpire State Building became the site of dramatic collisions that made the\nnews with surprising frequency. Again, advocates successfully spoke out: In\nthe late 1950s, working with the National Audubon Society, the Empire State\nBuilding began turning off lights during migration.\n\nBy the time planners envisioned the original World Trade Center towers in the\n1960s, advances in air conditioning allowed buildings to use expansive glass\ndesigns without overheating. This design trend compounded the problem: more\nilluminated buildings at night and more deadly illusions of sky and vegetation\nin the day. By then, wildlife groups were taking a proactive approach.\n\nIn 1967 The New York Times quoted members of the Linnaean Society of New York,\nwho warned that the Twin Towers would \u201cdo incalculable damage to our night-\nmigrating birds.\u201d Nonetheless, the soaring structures\u2014and their 600,000 square\nfeet of glass\u2014opened in the 1970s and, as predicted, bird fatalities ensued.\n\nBut the Linnaean Society was wrong: The toll was in fact calculable; there\njust were no organized efforts to conduct the necessary surveys. At least not\nyet.\n\nF\n\nor years, Financial District worker Rebekah Creshkoff had been finding dead\nbirds near her office. She wasn\u2019t the only person to do so but was unique in\nthat she couldn\u2019t let it go. In 1997 she contacted Toronto\u2019s Fatal Light\nAwareness Program Canada, which four years earlier became the first collision-\nprevention project in North America, and told its co-founder, Michael Mesure,\nthat she wanted to get building managers to take action. \u201cHe had a good\nchuckle at my naivete,\u201d Creshkoff recalls. Nobody was going to turn out their\nlights, he advised her, without evidence of the problem.\n\nCreshkoff began surveying every morning, though she, like me, found it hard to\nencounter so much death. \u201cInitially I really had to drag myself down there. I\njust wanted to wave a magic wand and have the issue be fixed,\u201d she says.\nCreshkoff recruited a few others to help and joined forces with NYC Audubon,\nwhich has been running what became Project Safe Flight ever since.\n\nBy 2000, their data already made a dent: Surveys pinpointed 2 World Trade\nCenter\u2019s most lethal area\u2014an expanse of glass that reflected nearby trees\u2014and\nbuilding management agreed to put up barely visible fine-mesh netting along\nthe first-floor windows. The simple intervention reduced collision deaths by\nabout 65 percent, and in May 2001, more netting went up on other problem areas\nof the towers.\n\nThough the September 11 attacks destroyed the buildings months later, the\ncampaign\u2019s remarkable start, marked by collaboration and momentum, went on to\ninform a much larger local movement. Since its early days, Project Safe Flight\nhas marshaled more than 1,000 volunteers in total, says Jessica Wilson, NYC\nAudubon\u2019s executive director. In 2014 the group also launched dBird.org to\ncrowdsource collision reports, a project that has expanded across the\ncontinent.\n\nArmed with numbers, solutions, and volunteers spread across communities, NYC\nAudubon has persuaded managers and owners of a wide range of buildings and\nsites to alter or dim their lighting and mitigate their glass, often with the\nsimple addition of unobtrusive grid-pattern film. Some redesigns have gone\nmuch further: Wilson points to the 2013 bird-friendly overhaul at the\nsprawling and especially fatal Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as a\nsuccessful stand-out, one that became a model for others. As I travel around\nthe boroughs, I am heartened by a growing patchwork of bird-deterring patterns\non glass\u2014a hotel here, a condominium building there. Downtown, my data and\ndocumentation have played a role in installing window collision film on some\ntruly diabolical expanses.\n\nMeanwhile, the records collected during more than 25 years of Project Safe\nFlight\u2014 along with those from dozens of other local monitoring and advocacy\nprograms that now exist across the country\u2014have been instrumental in moving\nsolutions beyond piecemeal actions to a far larger scale. Scientists\nunderstand more than ever about what causes the greatest lethal risk. For\nexample, while skyscrapers have historically received the most attention and\nmay harm more birds per building, data make it clear that glass on lower\nlevels and on lower-rise buildings and homes\u2014especially when it reflects\nvegetation\u2014takes a greater overall toll.\n\nToday, New York City leads the nation in bird-friendly legislation. In 2019, a\ncoalition of advocates won one of the country\u2019s strongest ordinances, which\nrequires that new and significantly renovated buildings use materials that\nreduce collision risk. \u201cBeyond saving birds in New York City, Local Law 15\ninspired similar requirements across the country and helped expand the market\nfor bird-friendly glass, lowering prices and making it more accessible,\u201d\nWilson says. A pair of bills enacted in 2022 require city-owned and -managed\nbuildings to turn off nonessential outdoor lights during migration and use\nmotion sensors to minimize lights inside. A groundbreaking proposal to apply\nsimilar rules to privately owned commercial buildings was introduced by a city\ncouncil member in 2023.\n\nBeyond New York City, dozens of municipalities and states have passed a range\nof policies, while advocates are pushing for stronger actions at all levels,\nincluding in New York State and in Congress. From my perch, progress can\u2019t\ncome quickly enough.\n\nI\n\nn a landmark 2019 study, scientists estimated that North America had lost 3\nbillion birds since 1970\u2014a nearly 30 percent decline. For many of us dedicated\nto picking up broken birds from sidewalks, those losses are ever-present and\ndispiriting. Over seven monitoring seasons since 2020, I\u2019ve documented nearly\n1,800 window-struck birds on what I call my \u201csad birding\u201d roster of nearly 80\nspecies, including many considered vulnerable and near-threatened. When I\nthink of warblers still hitting windows that Creshkoff patrolled decades ago,\nI want to retire my collision backpack and move to the woods.\n\nBut to give up hope would be to give up on birds, and local advocates agree\nthat it\u2019s important to persevere. Window collisions are a severe issue and\ncontribute to the loss of avian populations across North America, Partridge\npoints out. \u201cBut I\u2019m optimistic,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it is something that we\ncan relatively easily fix.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s crucial that I not think of my monitoring in a vacuum. I\u2019m a small\nlink in a long chain going back more than 135 years. Through the efforts of\nmany, the deadliest structures are being made safer. And in recent decades\nwe\u2019ve become even more organized in a growing grassroots movement.\n\nSocial media and the press, meanwhile, play a key role in increasing general\nawareness beyond dedicated bird advocates, planting seeds for further change.\nAfter my publicity in 2021, not only was I recognized by a stranger as \u201cthe\ndead bird lady from Twitter\u201d\u2014the perfect epitaph!\u2014but it\u2019s also not unusual\nfor downtown residents walking kids to school to wave me down and hand over an\ninjured bird or for community members and building workers to lament to us\nvolunteers about dead birds they see.\n\nMaking large-scale progress may be a long game, and getting everybody on board\nis unfortunately complicated, but the idea of saving hundreds of thousands of\nbirds a year in New York alone makes the tough parts worthwhile. While\nManhattan will never revert to forest and wetlands, I know we can at least be\nbetter hosts to birds as they travel through, heeding the call of migration\nfor millennia to come.\n\nThis story originally ran in the Spring 2024 issue as \u201cReflections of a Bird\nCollision Monitor.\u201d To receive our print magazine, become a member by making a\ndonation today.\n\nAudubon\n\n\u00danete a nuestra misi\u00f3n\n\nAudubon protege las aves y las \u00e1reas naturales que necesitan hoy y necesitar\u00e1n\nma\u00f1ana.\n\nConozca nuestro trabajo\n\nMantente conectado\n\n", "frontpage": true}
