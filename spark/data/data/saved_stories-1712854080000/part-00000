Breaking down that excessive alcohol\nleads to fatty liver, which in turn increases the risk of serious diseases\nsuch as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Nieuwdorp has now received an ERC\nAdvanced grant of 2.5 million euros for a major study into the underlying\ncauses of excessive alcohol production. Ultimately, he hopes to find a way to\nprevent excess alcohol produced in the intestines, and thus the related\ndiseases.\n\nIn 2022, Nieuwdorp and his team published a study in Nature Medicine on\nalcohol production in the intestines of overweight patients. \"Our findings\nshowed that the turnover of sugars in the intestines of these patients\nreleases far too much alcohol, equivalent to almost half a litre of whisky of\nalcohol. This is because the composition of the microbiome in their small and\nlarge intestines is disrupted. It seems that a change in acidity plays a role\nin this,\" Nieuwdorp explains.\n\n### Liver has to work hard\n\nFor patients, large quantities of alcohol in the intestines can have major\nconsequences. \"The liver, as with alcohol from liquor, has to work hard to\nbreakdown the alcohol, and that is done by storing it as fat. This causes\npeople to develop a fatty liver disease that can eventually become inflamed\nand lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver and\ncardiovascular disease,\" says Nieuwdorp.\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 adults in the Netherlands are overweight and more than 80% of\nthem have fatty liver. Nieuwdorp suspects that the high quantities of sugar in\nour modern diet can lead to increased alcohol production in the intestines.\nWith the European money from the ERC Advanced grant, he will investigate this\nfurther, for example by analysing the medical data and eating patterns of\nparticipants in the long-term HELIUS study.\n\n### Bacteria in the gut\n\nNieuwdorp hopes that the discovery of the increased alcohol production due to\nthe disrupted microbiome in the intestines will create a new path in the\nsearch for a way to treat fatty liver disease and liver inflammation. For\nexample, he wants to see if it is possible to control alcohol production in\nthe intestines by equipping bacteria in the intestine with properties that\nallow them to breakdown more alcohol. \"But whether and how that actually works\nis still unknown. That's what we're going to investigate in this FATGAP-\nproject,\" Nieuwdorp adds.\n\n### ERC Advanced grant\n\nThe ERC Advanced grants offer European researchers the opportunity to pursue\nambitious, curiosity-driven projects that can lead to important scientific\nbreakthroughs. They are awarded to established, leading researchers with a\nproven track record of significant research achievements over the past decade.\n\nShare this\n\n  1. Liver has to work hard\n  2.
