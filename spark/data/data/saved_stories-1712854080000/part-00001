Providers must display the label\u2014not simply an icon or link to the\nlabel\u2014in close proximity to an associated plan's advertisement.\"\n\nThe labels are required now for providers with at least 100,000 subscribers,\nwhile ISPs with fewer customers have until October 10, 2024, to comply. \"If a\nprovider is not displaying their labels or has posted inaccurate information\nabout its fees or service plans, consumers can file a complaint with the FCC\nConsumer Complaint Center,\" an agency webpage says.\n\nThe October 10 date will also bring an additional requirement that providers\n\"make the labels machine-readable to enable third parties to more easily\ncollect and aggregate data for the purpose of creating comparison-shopping\ntools for consumers,\" the FCC said.\n\n## What to look for\n\nThe FCC issued a consumer advisory telling broadband users what to look for in\nthe labels. Labels should include the monthly price, state whether it is an\nintroductory rate, the amount of time that an introductory rate applies, and\nthe price after any introductory rate expires. The labels must include any\nadditional monthly charges, one-time fees, early termination fees, and taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeed information should include typical download speed, upload speed, and\nlatency. For data caps, the labels should state how much data is included with\nthe monthly price and how much consumers have to pay for additional usage.\n\nLabels should also include links to information on discounts and service\nbundles, network management practices, and privacy policies.\n\n## ISPs complained, but now comply\n\nThe FCC was required to implement broadband label rules in a 2021 law passed\nby Congress, and the agency approved the label rules in November 2022. The\nrules didn't take effect until now in part because they were subject to a\nfederal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under requirements in the\nUS Paperwork Reduction Act.\n\nComcast and other ISPs complained that listing every monthly fee would be too\ndifficult, but the FCC rejected the industry's petition to weaken the rules.\nBig ISPs appear to be complying with the rules so far.\n\nComcast set up a webpage where you can enter your address to find broadband\nlabels for each speed tier. You can also see the Comcast labels by adding a\nbroadband plan to your cart using the company's standard checkout process.\n\nWe confirmed today that broadband labels are being displayed by AT&T, Verizon,\nT-Mobile, and Charter Spectrum on their checkout pages. Google Fiber got\nthings rolling early by launching its labels in October 2023.\n\nIn addition to the broadband labels, the FCC is forcing TV providers to\nadvertise \"all-in\" prices instead of using hidden fees to conceal the full\ncost of video service. The FCC voted to adopt the TV price rule last month,\nbut it is subject to a Paperwork Reduction Act review before it can take\neffect.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n93\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
