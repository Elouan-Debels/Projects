It\u2019s a start.\n\nBy Riley MacLeod\n\n8:48 AM EDT on April 17, 2024\n\n  * Share on X (formerly Twitter)\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on Email\n\nHumane\n\n22Comments\n\nA recent negative review of an AI gadget\u2013not even the one Chris wrote about;\ndid you know there are more?\u2013is causing drama among the technology\u2019s\nadherents, who think we\u2019re not being appropriately enthusiastic about AI\u2019s\npotential. Lucky for all of us who don\u2019t work at AI companies (and maybe even\nif you do), we are under no obligation to believe their bullshit.\n\nA quick summary of the situation: Some people on the internet are pissed off\nat popular YouTube product reviewer Marques Brownlee, who reviewed a car\ncalled the Fisker Ocean in February. Brownlee did not like the car and said\nso. In the weeks after his review, Fisker\u2019s stock price dropped and possible\nbankruptcy entered the picture; while some blamed this on Brownlee disparaging\nthe Ocean to his large audience, the company wasn\u2019t doing so hot to begin\nwith.\n\nThree days ago, Brownlee reviewed the Humane AI pin, which he also did not\nlike. People did not like that he did not like it! (Other reviewers, it should\nbe noted, also did not like the pin.) \u201cThis clip will be the gravestone for\nHumane,\u201d tweeted one AI adherent, though Humane, like Fisker, was having\ntrouble before the review. Another wrote, \u201cI\u2019m sad to see everyone pile on\nHumane. Hard working people trying to build cool shit deserve our respect.\nOften they\u2019ll fail. Sometimes badly. But we need them to keep trying.\u201d An\nentrepreneur writer tweeted, \u201cPotentially killing someone else\u2019s nascent\nproject reeks of carelessness. First, do no harm,\u201d which I would like to point\nout is quoting the Hippocratic Oath about a YouTube review of an AI gizmo.\n\nAll of this got to the point where Brownlee released a video response\nyesterday, titled \u201cDo Bad Reviews Kill Companies?\u201d It may shock you to learn\nthat his opinion is: no! \u201cYou don\u2019t get these bad reviews without the product\nbeing bad to begin with,\u201d he says. While he agrees with some criticism that\nthe titles of his videos could have come off as \u201cclickbaity\u201d (both call their\nrespective products \u201cthe worst\u201d), he says that he tries to make \u201ca thoughtful,\nwell-considered, balanced and honest and entertaining and informative video\nthat happens to be a review.\u201d He also says that \u201cI don\u2019t have any duty to any\nof the companies whose products I cover. It is only to the people watching the\nvideos.\u201d\n\nThis, I think, is what\u2019s actually pissing the AI people off about Brownlee\u2019s\nHumane review. He is clear that he has no fealty to them or their stock prices\n(\u201cI literally don\u2019t care what the stock price is of any company, of any\nproduct I review,\u201d he says.) He even says in his video that \u201cmy reviews are\ntechnically not for\u201d these products\u2019 makers, which must be infuriating to our\nnew Gilded Age robber barons who need constant reassurances of their genius.\nBecause Brownlee isn\u2019t in the business of promoting them or even talking to\nthem, he\u2019s not required to tout AI\u2019s potential.\n\nLike the threat behind crypto\u2019s \u201chave fun staying poor\u201d slogan, AI needs the\nrest of us to believe in its unstoppable ascendancy because that belief is\nbasically all it has. AI products aren\u2019t about whether anyone wants or needs\nAI products. They\u2019re about how people could want or need those products,\neventually, if everyone stays the course and also keeps pumping money into AI\ncompanies. You can call a product bad as long as you immediately point out\nthat obviously it\u2019s going to become good (Brownlee even nods to this in his\nHumane review, saying that the pin is \u201cthe new worst product I\u2019ve ever\nreviewed in its current state\u201d), because AI products are less products and\nmore promotional tools for the future, for technological advancement, for\nwhatever other big concepts Silicon Valley goons trot out to throw a\nsmokescreen over the barely-functional, largely useless junk they need us to\nbelieve is inevitable.\n\nWhether they really believe this, or whether they\u2019ll just say anything to keep\nthe money flowing, doesn\u2019t really matter to anyone who doesn\u2019t work at or\ninvest in AI companies. But what we believe about AI matters an awful lot to\nthem: As Aftermath pal Ed Zitron tweeted in response to Humane employees\u2019\nreactions to Brownlee\u2019s review, \u201cWhy do we have to be optimistic? Why do\ncustomers have to fill in the gaps between what you've promised and what\nyou've achieved?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nLike children clapping for Tinkerbell, we have to be optimistic because the\ngrift dies if we\u2019re not. The bubbles of both NFTs and the metaverse burst, at\nleast in part, because the reality trumped the hype; these things weren\u2019t the\nfuture, they were just ugly jpegs and boring imitations of Second Life. If the\nthird time is going to be the charm, which as Zitron points out already seems\nunlikely, then we need to stay on board. This is especially true because AI\nfaces the unique complication that it needs our buy-in, and a lot of it, to\nfeed it the impossible amounts of data it requires to have any potential at\nall.\n\nBrownlee, and the rest of us, shouldn\u2019t feel bad for pointing out when AI is\nbad, when it makes our workplaces and subway stations and video games and TVs\nworse. Giving it a participation trophy only benefits the people who stand to\nmake money off it or those who want to kiss those people\u2019s asses. If they\ncan\u2019t make a good product, it\u2019s not our fault for not believing in them\nenough. The more people call it what it is, the sooner everyday people stop\ndoing life support for AI\u2019s potential, the faster this can all be over.\n\n### Recommended\n\nHow Stupid Do They Think We Are\n\nAlready a user?Log in\n\n## Thanks for reading Aftermath!\n\n### Please register to read more free articles\n\nSee all subscription options\n\nEnjoyed this article?
