This\nresearch seeks to further explore how these workers were impacted by the\nstrong labor market, barriers to employment, and their changing expectations\nof employment. Focus groups took place May 2022 to September 2022, and\nparticipants were identified and recruited through community-based workforce\ndevelopment partners. Participants between the ages of 20 and 55 discussed\nthese topics with researchers from the Federal Reserve in virtual focus groups\nacross the country.^[1]\n\n## Introduction\n\nA topic that came up repeatedly was participants\u2019 desire to work for\nthemselves. Their comments ranged from entrepreneurial aspirations to start\ntheir own business to identifying key factors on why they pursued self-\nemployment. Some conversations around the topic of self-employment were\ngenerated from the questions posed to workers, including inquiries about\nplatform-based gig work, starting their own ventures, and their aspirations\nfor the future. These conversations contributed to the overall sense of how\nthe push to self-employment and independent work occurred as a result of their\nexperiences in the labor market. Roughly one-third of Worker Voices\nparticipants commented on the topic of self-employment or independent work in\nsome form. These comments and discussions led the authors to further examine\nthe self-employment aspirations and experiences of these workers.\n\nThis brief seeks to both investigate the motivation for participants\u2019 interest\nin self-employment and describe the collective sentiment around and\nexperiences with independent work, gig work, the informal economy, \u201cside\nhustles,\u201d and other income-generating pursuits not formally attached to an\nemployer. Unique to this study, the participants in Worker Voices had less\nthan a bachelor\u2019s degree and had a high representation of unemployed\nindividuals, women, people of color, and individuals in low-wage roles. This\nbrief contributes to the literature by providing a worker-centered\nunderstanding and framework of self-employment specific to workers and job\nseekers in these focus groups.\n\nThis brief begins by discussing the context of self-employment at this moment\nin the economy and what previous research has shown regarding the reasons for\nand landscape of self-employment opportunities. Next, this brief will discuss\nworkers\u2019 motivations for engaging in or aspiring to self-employment. Third,\nthe brief will discuss the ways in which participants engaged in self-\nemployment and identify common themes, laying out a framework for their self-\nemployment experiences. After this, it will compare the motivations workers\nhad to their actual experiences of self-employment to understand the\ndisconnect between aspirations and actual experiences. Finally, the brief will\ndiscuss the importance of the framework outlined, the implications of this\nwork, and future research directions.\n\n## Context of self-employment\n\nSo if anything, COVID really just taught me that there\u2019s no limitation on what\nI can do as far as being an entrepreneur. You just really got to have the\nmindset of being able to bounce back from anything. It\u2019s definitely hard right\nnow to be an entrepreneur.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nEntrepreneurship is at the heart of the American ethos. Many social narratives\nemphasize idea creation and innovation as a path to prosperity and laud the\nagency and control of pursuing one\u2019s dream to \u201cbe your own boss.\u201d A segment of\nthe entrepreneurship and self-employment literature focuses on high-growth,\nhigh-wealth entrepreneurs because they are seen as an engine of potential\neconomic growth (Bates 1995; Coad et al. 2014; Henrekson and Johansson 2009;\nPiazza and Hill 2021). These popular narratives often reinforce that\nentrepreneurs embrace risk and look to create high-growth, high-tech\nbusinesses. In actuality, roughly 82 percent of businesses don\u2019t employ\nanyone, equating to non-employers or self-employed people (US Small Business\nAdministration 2023). Moreover, an estimated 20 percent of startups fail in\nthe first year, and roughly half fail in five years (Knaup and Piazza 2007; US\nBureau of Labor Statistics, n.d.). But many ventures, including self-\nemployment, may not look like that. And while people claim that they want to\npursue self-employment, many do not start a business in actuality\n(Blanchflower 2004). Overall, there are important differences between the\nconcepts of entrepreneurship, self-employment, and gig work.\n\nResearchers have delineated entrepreneurship as a function that \u201cdemands\nentrepreneurial ability, physical capital, and liquidity,\u201d understanding\nentrepreneurship as taking risks financially and in other ways, whereas self-\nemployment does not demand all those inputs (Lavine and Rubinstein 2018). A\nlarge number of low-income individuals lack the capital and liquidity to\nbecome entrepreneurs. Instead, they may look to self-employment or informal\nwork arrangements to create new income-generating opportunities. Moreover,\nresearch has shown that many low-income individuals engage in informal work or\na second job to supplement their income (Abraham 2019; Abraham and Houseman\n2019). These multiple jobs often help them make ends meet (Rho and Fremstad\n2020).\n\nEngagement in or aspirations to self-employment can be understood by what\ndraws the individual into self-employment. Workers can be pushed into self-\nemployment for a variety of reasons. Some are pushed or nudged into self-\nemployment because of a lack of formal employment opportunities. Others are\npulled into or attracted to self-employment for a variety of nonfinancial\nbenefits, such as schedule flexibility and agency through being your own boss.\n\nResearch indicates that because of discrimination and language barriers, wages\ncan be lower for disadvantaged groups. Members of these groups may be pushed\ninto self-employment for greater employment options (Moore 1983). Subsistence\nself-employment or firms created out of necessity are smaller and grow less\n(Poschke 2013), but they can offer income for those who are financially\ninsecure. Some literature shows that unemployment also pushes some individuals\ninto self-employment (Fairlie 2013). A recent article indicates that\nindividuals transitioning between unemployment and self-employment engage in\nnecessity income generation, which displays low levels of innovation. The\nauthor suggests that this behavior could reflect the influx of businesses\nduring the pandemic (Fossen 2021).\n\nIndividuals can be pulled into self-employment because they seek the\nnonfinancial benefits it can offer, such as flexibility or being your own boss\n(Hurst and Pugsley 2011). Moreover, women are more likely than men to pursue\nself-employment for nonfinancial motivations (Allen and Curington 2014). Some\nof those nonfinancial reasons were discussed in previous Worker Voices\nresearch around job quality, which showed that workers defined quality\nemployment experiences around compensation, job security, treatment,\nflexibility, and engagement (Dunne and Wardrip 2023). The pull of participants\ninto self-employment could be informed by an overall lack of job quality in\ntheir current roles.\n\nWe cannot discuss low-wage self-employment without mentioning gig work. The\nterm \u201cgig work\u201d has different meanings to economists, advocates, workers, and\nemployers. A study by the Workers Lab and the Aspen Institute concluded that\nthe range of terminology and definitions associated with gig work created\nconfusion and inconsistency (Haro and Steward 2024). The authors define gig\nwork as a type of self-employment in which \u201cemployees\u201d are considered\nindependent contractors, set their own schedules, and engage in \u201cincome-\nearning activity done outside of a long-term direct-hire employment\nrelationship\u201d (The Workers Lab 2023). Many types of gig work are brokered\nthrough an online intermediary, rendering workers dependent on the platform to\nschedule the work and provide wages. We refer to this as platform-based gig\nwork. Like other self-employed workers, gig workers take on the risk of\nemployment without the benefits of being an employee of a company (Muehlberger\n2007). Regardless of the type of gig work, these jobs can provide nonfinancial\nbenefits of self-employment, such as schedule flexibility, and greater agency\nthan a traditional job affords an employee.\n\n## Motivation: Why are workers looking to self-employment?\n\nWhen you own your own business, you get to decide how you want to run it. And\nthen like you get to decide how to take your business to the next level to\nmake more money. But then working for others, it\u2019s just like \u2014 it\u2019s more\n[inaudible] from working for others to own my own business. And I\u2019m currently\nworking on that and saving up for that as well.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nThe qualitative data from the Worker Voices focus groups provide additional\ncontext as to why so many individuals were interested in starting a business\nor working for themselves. Before the pandemic, roughly 3.5 million Americans\nstarted businesses each year. After the pandemic, this figure jumped 54\npercent to 5.4 million in 2021 (US Census Bureau 2023). What these numbers do\nnot show are the nuance and personal perspectives and motivations of\nindividuals who seek out independent work.\n\nWorkers in our focus groups discussed a variety of reasons they aspired to or\nengaged in self-employment. Some were pushed into self-employment through a\nlack of employment options, while others were pulled into or attracted to it\nto fulfill personal aspirations and enhance income potential. Across the focus\ngroup sessions, participants spoke of dissatisfaction with their work\nexperiences, as the main findings from the Worker Voices Project and its\nbriefs have shown. These factors included discrimination and dissatisfaction\nin the workplace, an inclination for more agency in their work life, and a\ndesire for greater employment stability. These reasons all proved especially\ntrue for participants in the three Spanish-language sessions, which recruited\nfrom organizations that serve immigrant workers.\n\n### Dissatisfaction in the workplace\n\nMany participants spoke of seeking self-employment as a means of taking agency\nover poor job quality and dissatisfaction they experienced in the workplace.\nWorker Voices participants discussed the tensions in their lives resulting\nfrom going to a job they described as dissatisfying or even dangerous during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic balanced with the need to put food on the table (Miller\net al. 2023). One participant indicated that they were studying for a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in entrepreneurship as a path to create independence and\ngenerational wealth.\n\nThis speaks to what much of the previous Worker Voices research details: that\nmany participants looked differently at work because they wanted more agency\nin their work life (Miller et al. 2023).\n\n### Discrimination and systemic barriers\n\nRespondents spoke openly about how discrimination and bias in the workplace\ncaused them to think of self-employment as an alternative (Galeano et al.\n2023). Previous research illustrates that a variety of people of color and\nimmigrant groups are pushed into self-employment because of workplace\ndiscrimination, limited work opportunities, and language barriers (Fairlie and\nMarion 2010). This also holds true for people with disabilities (Blanck 2000).\nSome participants spoke of workplace discrimination from employers and\ncustomers alike.\n\nSixty-one Worker Voices participants discussed experiences with or motivations\nfor self-employment in their responses. Of these, a majority were people of\ncolor; 50 percent of these respondents identified as Hispanic and 52 percent\nidentified as African American or Black.^[2]\n\nSo, I want to find a path to where not only am I free to be who I am, you know\n\u2014 not tied to an employer, not being afraid living paycheck to paycheck but\nalso creating an avenue to where [my child] can actually explore himself and\nnot be worried about those same things I was.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nOne woman, who self-identified as Latina, described undesirable work\nconditions and subsequently began cleaning homes and ironing clothes:\n\n> \u201cWhile I was working at the restaurant, I did all right, I won\u2019t deny it.\n> But I was mistreated, because some clients wanted to mistreat me because, at\n> least in my case, for being Latina, and they wanted to treat me poorly, and\n> that was one of the reasons I didn\u2019t want to keep looking for a job.\u201d\n\nAnother participant, who indicated that he worked in a grocery store,\ndescribed workplace inequities because of his skin color:\n\n> \u201c[Yeah, for me, I think I would love to own a business, like be the boss of\n> my own...because I\u2019m going through a lot, working for people [who] have not\n> been able to treat me nicely because of my race and color.\u201d\n\nOthers indicated self-employment was the only work option for them because of\nsystemic barriers to employment. For individuals who had been justice-\nimpacted, starting a business or working for themselves were among the options\nthat did not require a background check. As one participant noted, they had\npreviously tried app-based gig work and their criminal record was causing\nemployment challenges:\n\n> \u201cLike right now a lot of jobs, for me, yeah, they are hiring. But for me\n> though \u2014 for me with my background, honestly, I\u2019ve been a felon, so a lot of\n> times the Urban League has had to help me...I don\u2019t really want a job\n> anymore.\u201d\n\n### Job stability\n\nPrevious Worker Voices research revealed that job instability was a major\nissue for workers in this cohort, and from that, they identified job security\nas a pillar of job quality (Dunne and Wardrip 2023; Miller et al. 2023).\nRecent research has also shown that workers in low-wage roles are looking for\njob stability as a key component in their job (Kelly et al. 2023). The popular\nnarrative amplifies that self-employment and entrepreneurship are risky\nendeavors, especially for those of lower income (Auguste et al. 2023), but an\ninternational study showed that people who enter into their own ventures\nincrease their job stability because of their personal attachment to, and\npersonal investment in, the venture (Failla et al. 2017).\n\nSome participants noted that they felt slighted by employers suddenly firing\nthem or laying them off because of the pandemic. Feelings of instability\naround employment caused many participants to indicate that they prefer to\nwork independently or engage in side hustles in order to not depend on\nemployers. A focus group member noted:\n\n> \u201c[The] quarantine definitely taught me to take some of those side hustles\n> ... I keep up my side hustles seriously, because who knows if this will\n> happen again?...So, it\u2019s like, make sure if you did something you love, like\n> figure out how to make a dollar off of it, because it\u2019s just not safe to\n> have your whole \u2014 like, my whole world fell apart. So, I\u2019m like, don\u2019t ever\n> let that happen to you. If you\u2019ve got a skill, like, don\u2019t take it for\n> granted. It might seem simple today, you know, but it might actually be\n> something that you can depend on.\u201d\n\n### Immigrant communities lack of employment options\n\nIn the three focus group sessions held in Spanish, participants, many of whom\ndescribed themselves as immigrants, generally discussed self-employment both\nas an aspiration and a reality. They cited a lack of alternatives in the labor\nmarket, either because of job instability or their immigration status.\nResearch shows that many immigrants work in riskier jobs with a higher degree\nof injury (Orrenius and Zavodny 2009), and immigrants and undocumented workers\nhave a higher risk of job loss and adverse job transitions (Tamborini and\nVillarreal 2021). And for this population, informal work (Raijman 2001) and\nself-employment (Abada 2014) can play vital roles in income generation.\nUndocumented Hispanic immigrants are often pushed into self-employment because\nof a lack of employment options (Fisher and Lewin 2018).\n\nSome participants noted:\n\n> \u201cMy specific objective is to legalize my situation in the country, that\u2019s\n> the first thing. After becoming legal, I would like to keep studying and\n> then to have my own business or have a good job.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWell, when I was in Venezuela, I took many courses ... and I would like to\n> have my own business in the future, a spa, perhaps \u2014 my own business, with\n> my own income, and I would like to be independent. I would like that for the\n> future.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI was also waitressing in a restaurant when COVID started, and when the\n> quarantine began, they had to let me go, they fired me. I was job hunting,\n> and nobody wanted to hire me...I couldn\u2019t find a job and I had to clean and\n> iron clothes. Since then and until now I do that job. It\u2019s best for me to\n> work independently.\u201d Later, they continued, \u201cWell, honestly, my goal for the\n> future would be to have my own business, to have a certain number of clients\n> and more coverage, a wider area of homes and clients.\u201d\n\n### Self-employment as enhancing potential\n\nIndividuals in focus groups actively looked to change their job roles and\nresponsibilities to better reflect and incorporate their personal interests\nand abilities. Research has identified that when management gives agency to\nemployees to modify their work the best way they see fit, doing so can enhance\nthe employee\u2019s capacity to contribute to the organization \u2013 This is especially\ntrue when job duties and structures are changing, putting more responsibility\non the individual (Dutton 2023). Many Worker Voices participants felt a lack\nof agency and ability to modify their job duties to enhance the organization.\n\nSome participants expressed that working for themselves not only gave them\ngreater agency in their lives but also provided an outlet for greater personal\nand wealth potential. Because of negative workplace experiences, some\nrespondents felt that the contract between employers and employees was broken.\nIf workers were going to expend energy on employment, it would be best done in\nservice to their own entrepreneurial efforts and ideas.\n\n> \u201cSo, I think that\u2019s another reason why I wanted to be an\n> entrepreneur...there\u2019s no set limit on what I can achieve or what I can\n> accomplish working up under somebody else... I\u2019m [very] tired of pouring\n> into other people\u2019s cups. I\u2019m still young, so I really have time, and time\n> is now to just invest into myself.\u201d She also mentioned, \u201cSo if anything,\n> COVID really just taught me that there\u2019s no limitation on what I can do as\n> far as being an entrepreneur. You just really got to have the mindset of\n> being able to bounce back from anything. It\u2019s definitely hard right now to\n> be an entrepreneur.\u201d\n\n## Experiences: How are workers engaging in self-employment?\n\nI tried out some apps like [app-based gig work company], and for me it\u2019s been\nuncertain because not every day is a good day. And you have to invest in gas.\nSometimes that can cause worries, it\u2019s not like you can always work at the\ntime you wish, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to spend on gas, you drive around and\nthere\u2019s no rides. So it has its perks but also disadvantages.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nParticipants described a range of independent work experiences. These\nexperiences varied considerably, from delivering items, driving people, and\ncleaning houses to fixing engines and operating food trucks. We categorize\nthese experiences according to two themes: agency and independence in work,\nand income-generating opportunities. In this section, we will discuss these\nexperiences in self-employment using the framework that follows as a guide\n(Figure 1).\n\nTo inform this framework, we examined all references related to self-\nemployment, gig work, and independent work arrangements in Worker Voices\nsessions and transcripts.^[3] From these references, we identified themes\nacross focus groups that centered around independence and income-generating\nopportunities. The themes arose from participants\u2019 descriptions of the type of\nwork arrangements they participated in up to the time of the focus group\nsession.\n\nThe vertical axis displays the spectrum of independence of the work. It\nreflects the control an individual has over business decisions, pricing for\nservices or goods, or scheduling. Workers described varying levels of autonomy\nor independence in self-employment, including highly independent workers who\nrun their own business and have full decision-making authority over pricing,\nwages, and products and services. On the dependent end of the axis, a worker\nmay have far less autonomy. Workers may rely on a third-party intermediary,\nsuch as a platform distributing the work, for schedules, pricing, or\nemployment terms.\n\nThe framework\u2019s horizontal axis reflects the spectrum of income-generating\nopportunities. Individuals in low-income-generating opportunities described\ntheir wages as low, variable, and unpredictable. The individuals who spoke to\nlow-income-generating self-employment were often in fields that were less\nspecialized by nature or had low barriers to entry. High-income-generating\nself-employment described by participants tended to be more specialized in\nnature or might require an investment of capital to open a business or start\nan entrepreneurial endeavor.\n\nThese two axes interact to form four distinct quadrants of self-employment\nexperiences described by workers in this study. From these descriptions, there\nemerged four main categories of self-employment and independent work:\ngeneralized gig work, specialized gig work, informal businesses, and formal\nbusinesses.\n\nFigure 1. Framework for Understanding Self-Employment in Worker Voices\nResponses\n\nThis framework is useful in distinguishing different types of independent\nemployment arrangements that participants described in Worker Voices focus\ngroups. These categories reflect their actual self-employment experiences, not\naspirations, that they described in the summer of 2022. It is important to\nnote that many other types of self-employment and independent work activities\nmay exist beyond those discussed in these listening sessions. This brief\nreflects the experiences of a subset of individuals who participated in these\nconversations. That said, the framework is unique in that it is generated by\nworkers in low-wage roles or job seekers without a four-year degree and\nprovides their perspectives on self-employment.\n\n### Generalized gig work\n\nGig-based work is often highly dependent on a third party.^[4] Among\nparticipants, we found the highest number of instances of gig work were\nallocated through an online platform or other technology. For many\nparticipants in Worker Voices focus groups, opportunities for earning income\nthrough the online platform economy helped them make ends meet after the\npandemic disrupted their income. Some of these responses came in direct\nassociation with facilitators asking if participants engaged in platform-based\ngig work. Other responses came up naturally in conversations with\nparticipants. Their comments largely related to work that was general in\nnature, such as delivery or driving. These jobs had low barriers to entry and\nlittle to no training requirements. These generalized gig jobs, or online\nplatform-dependent jobs, were described as lower-paying and had less income-\nearning potential.\n\nFor some, taking on this work was necessary for survival during the pandemic\nas a way to substitute lost wages or smooth out inconsistent income:\n\n> \u201cI had to try to look for another means to have a source of income. We\n> applied for little jobs online ... those platforms that I can do pick up a\n> little thing ... that kind of helped me bring in bucks that helped me\n> survive all through the period of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nFor most participants, platform-based gig work helped fill the gaps between\nother unstable work or helped make ends meet after layoffs and challenges\nduring the pandemic. The supplemental effect of this income was particularly\nsalient for workers who saw decreases in hours or wages during the pandemic.\nMore broadly, participants referred to these jobs as side income that they\nengaged in when needed but that weren\u2019t primary sources of income:\n\n> \u201cAnd then there is also [this app where you] ... pick up when you can\n> certain shifts. They weren\u2019t the best jobs, but it was extra money.\u201d\n\n> \u201cRight now, I\u2019m currently doing [app-based gig work company], I mean, on the\n> weekend, a side, to pay, I mean, somebody got to pay bills.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI did [app-based gig work company]. It\u2019s kind of hard when you can\u2019t really\n> do it full time. I mean it is good for extra side money, but, yeah. Like say\n> I would like, okay, I would do [app-based gig work company] to shop for\n> groceries...I want to say I made probably like $25\u2013$30 ... and then most of\n> that had to go back in the gas tank, because I would have to deliver the\n> orders, and they like be farther out than where the stores were.\u201d\n\nMany participants engaged with more than one platform to make ends meet. For\nthese workers, cobbling together bits and pieces of various gigs and income\nstreams was how they covered their costs of living. Noted one:\n\n> \u201cI also work for [app-based gig work] on my own, and the delivery of these\n> two jobs has saved my life for the moment.\u201d\n\nWhile some participants reported that the supplemental income from platform-\nbased gig work provided a smoothing effect, a large majority of participants\nreported experiencing inconsistency of income and a lack of reliability or\nconsistency in pay:\n\n> \u201cSo, no matter how much [app-based gig work company], no matter how much you\n> sell that stuff or try to do little jobs in between, it just wasn\u2019t enough\n> to cover [bills].\u201d\n\n> \u201cI did that [app-based gig work] for about six months, but the pay was\n> really not worth my time. There was a lot of moments when I would sit in\n> high, you know, busy areas for three hours and I would get one, maybe two\n> deliveries.\u201d\n\nOther participants noted that many of these jobs required them to incur costs\nto earn income. This was particularly noticeable for individuals who engaged\nwith driving-based platforms. They reported having to balance the rising costs\nof gas, car repairs, and maintenance against the income they could make\ndriving.\n\nAcross this category of generalized gig work, workers indicated that they were\ndependent on third parties, such as online platforms or apps, to set prices\nand terms of their work arrangements. While they enjoy the flexibility of\nbeing self-employed, they also reported this work arrangement as generally\nunstable and not a source of upward mobility. For most, generalized gig work\nwas a patching or income-smoothing opportunity during an economically\nchallenging time.\n\n### Specialized gig work\n\nSome individuals in Worker Voices sessions did find higher-paying gig\nopportunities through more specialized forms of gig work. We refer to\nspecialized gig work as work that occurs on an irregular basis but requires a\nmore unique skill set or talent. Many participants who engaged in specialized\ngig work had participated in some training or had a unique talent, which\nallowed workers higher income generation or income potential.\n\nAs an example of specialized gig work, we spoke with workers who did mechanic\nor handyman-type work on an irregular basis to supplemental regular income or\nhelp after losing work. These individuals had a unique skill set or\nspecialization that allowed them to earn more income.\n\nParticipants noted in the listening sessions a range of experiences in\nspecialized gig work. These experiences, which varied across industries,\ninclude working in a hair-braiding salon, working as an artist, or working in\na skilled trade like auto maintenance. This gig work distinguished itself from\ngeneralized app-based gig work in that it requires a unique skill set or\ntraining. Participants described earning somewhat higher wages in these work\narrangements but remaining dependent on another entity for pricing and\nstability.\n\n[My husband is] a mechanic ... he would do side jobs to help with, you know,\nmaking ends meet and whatnot.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nIn the case of the hair-braiding salon, each individual beautician acts as an\nindependent worker, paying an overall fee to the salon. That said, the stylist\nlikely does not make decisions on their scheduling, even if she may have some\nagency over pricing depending on the salon or the arrangement.\n\n> \u201c[S]omeone reached out to me to work in a salon, and so basically since then\n> and up until now I\u2019ve really just been being an entrepreneur. But even with\n> the job search, I did try to get like another job because at the end of the\n> day, sometimes you have good days, and sometimes you have bad days when it\n> comes to being an entrepreneur, but bills still have to get paid.\u201d\n\nOne type of specialized self-employment is individuals earning income through\ncontent creation. This is more commonly understood in terms of social media\napps like TikTok and Instagram. Like the mechanic and the beautician, content\ncreators are compensated more highly because they have a unique brand, skill\nset, or talent. While less common among Worker Voices participants, a few\nindividuals in the discussions noted content creation as a means of\nsupplemental income.\n\nOne participant, for instance, engaged in content creation through a streaming\nservice. The streaming app allowed the individual to broadcast themselves\nplaying a video game, and others could subscribe to their channel. There,\nfollowers and likes earn the individual more income. They explained their\nexperience as,\n\n> \u201cI work for myself currently doing content creation for [app-based gig work\n> company]. They\u2019re supposed to put something into place to where we get an\n> actual stable income every month from them, as long as we stream seven\n> hours, but right now, you know, it\u2019s just side income.\u201d\n\nAnother participant created podcasts as a means of earning income:\n\n> \u201c...I had started messing around with an [unnamed] app...it was a hobby at\n> first. It\u2019s an app that allows you to do a podcast. And at first it was just\n> something that I did. I found it very interesting.\u201d\n\nThe success of the podcast motivated this individual to eventually start a\nmedia company that further monetized his content creation.\n\nNotably, both individuals described their earnings from content creation as\nside income rather than primary income. Both reported relative satisfaction\nwith this work, too, although they noted that the income was inconsistent in\nspite of the independence that the work afforded them.\n\nOthers participated in specialized gig work through more contract-based work.\nOne individual described their motivation to work independently in the real\nestate arena, leveraging their unique skills and assets:\n\n> \u201cI want to be more independent. Instead of signing a W2, I\u2019m filing a 1099.\n> So, I went to the real estate aspect of what I was doing, which was property\n> management.\u201d\n\nIn other well-documented types of contract work, tech companies contract out\ndifferent aspects of work needed for particular projects. This work requires a\nformal contract that often expires when the project is finished. While this\ntends to be an arrangement that exists in more high-skilled consultancy\nsituations, a small number of Worker Voices participants reported experience\nwith these independent work arrangements.\n\nAll of the individuals who engaged in specialized gig work reported having\nrelatively little control and agency over pricing and scheduling. They also\nnoted that specialized gig jobs generated more income than nonspecialized gig\njobs, with work ranging from work at hair salons to self-employment in\nproperty management to consulting for tech firms. At the same time, many\narticulated the risk they had to take on as a result of contract working\narrangements. The workers in this category were more likely to report this\nform of independent work as higher paying.\n\n### Informal business\n\nParticipants in Worker Voices listening sessions engaged in a variety of forms\nof self-employment that we heard to be highly independent in nature but which\ngenerated low wages. This included self-employment through cash businesses or\nthe informal economy. While economic analysis often differentiates between\nformal and informal businesses because of tax structures, this paper refers to\nthe ways workers themselves spoke about their businesses. One distinguishing\nfactor between formal and informal businesses was the opportunity for income\ngeneration.\n\nMany engaged in informal work that was highly independent, such as domestic\nwork where they may set their own wages and hours, but was often lower in pay\nand economically precarious. These workers in many ways operate like gig\nworkers, picking up jobs wherever there is demand. Unlike those working\nthrough an online platform or a contract, these workers have more agency over\ntheir wages, schedules, and services.\n\nInformal business can offer a low barrier to entry. During a difficult time\nfinancially, this work provided some means of income, albeit often an unstable\none. As two participants noted:\n\nI did look for a job, but I wasn\u2019t accepted because of the requirements and\nbecause I don\u2019t have a college degree. So, that was what moved me, what\nmotivated me to work from home, cleaning and ironing clothes.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\n> \u201cWhen I was in between jobs, and during the pandemic, I started doing some,\n> you can call it [handy] work, some stuff with some cars, washing them, and\n> carpet cleaning ... I was just thinking like I might be just better off\n> starting my own business for real, I controlled my own money. I controlled\n> my own hours. And I could set my prices and dictate how I move ... I was\n> thinking about maybe rigging me a van and doing me a mobile car wash.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWell, when I was fired, I needed to find a job, and I started walking dogs.\n> I earned very little money, but it was enough to buy the food for my family.\n> That was the only time I worked independently. I walked dogs.\u201d\n\nWorker Voices focus group participants reported working informally in day\nlabor arrangements in construction, landscaping, and temporary manual labor\njobs. While some of these individuals did this work on a regular basis, others\ndid it on an irregular basis for supplemental income. In some cases, doing it\non an irregular basis was not the worker\u2019s choice. One participant noted:\n\n> \u201c[T]hat did help us to get mainly temporary jobs ... a lot of landscaping,\n> and that helped out a lot. But it was always temporary jobs, not anything\n> long term.\u201d\n\nParticipants also described doing domestic work, such as babysitting,\nchildcare, and cleaning. Many female participants in Worker Voices sessions\nreported engaging in some level of domestic work as their independent work or\nself-employment. This was especially true for women in the Spanish-language\nsessions.\n\nLike other types of independent employment, many of the workers reported they\nturned to this type of work out of necessity because of losing other jobs.\nOthers reported struggles with hiring requirements, making independent\ndomestic work an option with a lower barrier to entry \u2014 or even a failsafe\noption \u2014 during the pandemic.\n\nIn several focus groups, individuals reported that while they engaged in\nindependent domestic work, they found that the income was precarious and the\nconditions challenging based on client preferences during the pandemic. While\nthe independent worker could set prices in their informal business, they felt\nthat clients were not as receptive to higher wages for services.\n\n> \u201cIn my case, I worked for some time cleaning houses, and I had the problem\n> that I told the clients how much I was charging for the service, and\n> afterwards they wouldn\u2019t pay what I was asking.\u201d\n\nThis same individual reported that their immigration status was a major\nmotivator for doing independent work. It also contributed to their challenges\nwith pricing and precarity, among other risks. In reference to the instance\nmentioned previously when clients refused to pay:\n\n> \u201cI just let it go to avoid confrontations, that\u2019s it ... it affects me\n> economically, but I choose to let it go to avoid trouble. That\u2019s because,\n> since we\u2019re immigrants, they want to call the police or they want to make\n> false accusations, so I prefer to just leave it.\u201d\n\nMany who engaged in domestic self-employment, from cleaning houses to\nbabysitting and elder care, reported that the work was accessible and\navailable during the pandemic but not necessarily reliable or economically\nstable. Like day laborers, participants noted they had some control over\nscheduling, pricing, or services offered. Overall, though, many felt the work\nwas economically precarious and did not provide a stable income.\n\n### Formal business\n\nIn the final category of self-employment, we looked at workers with higher-\nincome-earning opportunities who had higher levels of autonomy and agency over\ntheir self-employment. We classify formal businesses as individuals who are\nself-employed and work independently. The individuals who started formal\nbusinesses tended to be motivated by an entrepreneurial endeavor or a passion\nproject, and often had a specialization or asset to leverage.\n\nNotably, as we moved from gig work to formal businesses, we saw fewer\nrespondents who had relevant experiences. Of those individuals in our focus\ngroups who did start small businesses, most would be classified as non-\nemployer firms or home-based businesses. These small home-based businesses are\noften precarious, and owners are more likely to use a personal line of credit\nto finance them, according to research from the Small Business Credit Survey\n(2023).\n\nThat said, they had more agency and control of pricing and scheduling, and\nthus greater relative independence. They often leveraged a unique talent or\nskill that earned them more income, too. As one participant said succinctly,\n\u201cI\u2019m baking cakes and I\u2019m doing well.\u201d Other individuals operating small\nbusinesses out of their homes discussed challenges making ends meet:\n\n> \u201cSo, I decided to start a small jewelry company, which to date I am trying\n> to build. It has been very difficult for me ... it is very small, that is,\n> it is not that we have a large business like all the companies that I said\n> here.\u201d\n\nFew Worker Voices participants indicated that they owned or operated small\nbusinesses that employed other people. However, we did hear from participants\nwho owned businesses that were not operated out of their homes and that\nrequired upfront capital to start. Both of the businesses in the following\nquotes were started before or around the time of the pandemic. The owners of\nthe food truck and the kiosk had to adapt to the challenges and opportunities\nof the economic circumstances.\n\n> \u201cI have a food truck and when the pandemic started ... I saw myself in the\n> need to stop working for a \u2014 for a few weeks, also because of the shortage\n> of merchandise because there was no merchandise to continue operating a food\n> business ... it did benefit me, because as all the restaurants closed, I\n> continued working throughout the pandemic ... there the advantage is that as\n> the places were closed because people were looking for what to eat anyway.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI started a kiosk where I sell some snacks. That\u2019s my current job. I get\n> some amount of money that can help maybe take care of my family and other\n> things.\u201d\n\nDespite the wide variety of independent work that workers described doing in\nthe focus groups, it is notable that few individuals actually succeeded in\nstarting small businesses. While many aspired to work independently, their\nentrepreneurial endeavors were not always successful. For the few instances of\nfirms with employees or physical locations, most reported difficulty with\nhiring and other issues with keeping the business afloat during the pandemic.\nThe food truck owner mentioned:\n\n> \u201cBut now as the economy is, the truth is, very difficult because all the raw\n> material in terms of food has risen a lot and the minimum [wage] does not\n> rise and to cover the type of workers to whom one sells; that is ... if I\n> increase my prices but people continue to earn the same. So, it is more\n> difficult to access people\u2019s pockets because the economy does not give for\n> more or they pour gasoline or buy a taco.\u201d\n\nThose who were successful in launching a formal business typically leveraged a\nspecialized skill or asset, such as a property or a truck. They generated more\nincome than informal businesses and were more likely to identify as\nentrepreneurs. For these entrepreneurs who launched formal businesses, the\nindividuals still indicated concern about the longevity of their business and\nwhether this opportunity would provide them economic stability.\n\n## Disconnect: Experiences versus motivation\n\n[I]n my case, I was fired from the restaurant where I worked. From then on,\nI\u2019ve been working on my own, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing nowadays, and I think it\u2019s\nbetter than working at the restaurant because I\u2019m my own boss, and this has\nmany benefits because I can manage my time and schedule. With regard to the\nwage, it\u2019s better than the restaurant. When I worked at the restaurant, they\nwould pay $8, perhaps $10 per hour. When I do delivery, I can earn up to $20\nper hour, just to deliver something. I think it\u2019s much better this way.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nAn important finding of this paper is the increasing interest in self-\nemployment as a means of creating income, agency, and independence, and the\ndisconnect from the actual experiences of those who participated in self-\nemployment and independent work. Respondents reported varying experiences with\nself-employment. Some enjoyed the flexibility and potential of it, while\nothers found that the upfront costs (e.g., gas, a car, the schedule) precluded\nthe business from yielding the rewards participants had expected. Some\nparticipant experiences aligned with aspirational comments expressing the\ndesire for greater agency and satisfaction in the workplace. Other comments\nrevealed discontentment with the self-employment options available to them.\nAll these comments provided a nuanced view about the interaction and\nexpectation of workers in low-wage work or job seekers without a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree.\n\nThe way participants felt about their experiences with independent work or\nself-employment varied tremendously based on the economic precarity of their\nwork and the level of independence of the roles. Noted one:\n\n> \u201cI controlled my own money. I controlled my own hours. And I could set my\n> prices and dictate how I move. I made pretty good [money] with what I was\n> doing in those other jobs ... but [working for myself is] less stress on my\n> body. And like I said, I can schedule around my movements.\u201d\n\nOther independent workers indicated satisfaction with their new work\narrangements, and some even noted opportunities for higher wages. For these\nindividuals leaving low-wage, highly precarious work environments, self-\nemployment provided them an opportunity for agency and a different avenue for\neconomic opportunity.\n\nThat said, workers in highly dependent gig work, particularly work that was\nregulated by a platform or an app, reported high levels of frustration with\nboth the financial precarity of their arrangements and the quality of the work\noverall.\n\n> \u201cI wasn\u2019t making enough money to make up for how much I was hemorrhaging,\n> and also, the emotional well-being of just being [mistreated] by customers\n> kind of reached a breaking point with that. And I\u2019ve seen that with a lot of\n> folks in my community, trying to get by on gig work. It\u2019s not sustainable at\n> all, and very dangerous also, what with the whole risk factor. No one wore\n> masks, ever.\u201d\n\nA consistent theme we heard across the listening sessions was that individuals\nwho worked independently faced distinct challenges. Many were trying to find\nany opportunity to make ends meet and often taking on additional risks or\ncosts.\n\n> \u201cNot only do I do [delivery] now, but I sold pound cakes. I kept kids. I did\n> everything, you know, I could do ... sometimes they can\u2019t even afford to pay\n> you that week. So, you might kept a child all week long, and they don\u2019t even\n> have the money to pay you. So, you go back in the hole. You try to scramble\n> and think of your own bills ... so, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s been a bad cycle of\n> trying to get up out of the spiral.\u201d\n\nThe economic precarity of the situation did not deter all self-employed\nindividuals. One participant indicated they weren\u2019t interested in returning to\nthe labor market, even as they struggled to make ends meet while working\nindependently.\n\nIn considering the motivations and experiences of self-employed individuals,\nanother Worker Voices participant reflected that it is much easier to start\nsmall businesses than in previous years, and that independent work and filing\ntaxes independently has been encouraged and facilitated:\n\n> \u201cWell, entrepreneurship has kind of changed ... at one point, you felt like,\n> okay, I have to have a certain amount of money saved to become an\n> entrepreneur or to even have a business. But now, it\u2019s as simple as opening\n> up the [online platform] shop and like reselling stuff or working with one\n> of these other websites ... now they\u2019re making it very fluid where they\n> offer you the tax forms to fill out. You know, they offer you all sorts of\n> statistics into what you\u2019re doing. So you can be, actually, like a novice\n> entrepreneur as you\u2019re growing into a professional entrepreneur.\u201d\n\nOverall, self-employed individuals who felt positively about their experiences\ngenerally spoke about the independence and agency they felt working on their\nown.\n\nMany participants discussed the inconsistency of the income and the risks they\nundertook. They noted that independent work was still highly precarious and\nunpredictable. Altogether, the positives regarding independent work tended to\nbe more about scheduling and agency rather than about income and economic\nsecurity.\n\n## Framework implications\n\nAnd for me, it\u2019s kind of hard actually to even have to go back to work for\nsomebody, you know. As I said before, I had work lined up, like a lot of work,\nbut...stuff slowed up...like a lot. But the workforce is not really all it\u2019s\ncracked up to be. So yes, I will be going back into business for myself.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nAnalyzing the aspirations and experiences of Worker Voices participants\nestablished a unique framework to understand different experiences of self-\nemployment. This framework in particular reflects experiences with independent\nwork for individuals who participated in Worker Voices focus groups and, by\ndefinition, did not have a four-year college degree. We find that workers\ndiscussed independent work in a multidimensional way, thinking about tradeoffs\nbetween agency and independence and the need for generating income. This\nworker-generated framework is useful to understand the experiences of these\nworkers and to provide context as to why some of these participants aspire to\nindependent work.\n\nPrevious frameworks and typologies for categorizing and conceptualizing self-\nemployment often refer to a top-down categorization of workers. Some\nresearchers leverage tax data to understand the difference between independent\ncontractors, self-employment, and gig workers (Bernhardt et al. 2022). Others\ncategorize self-employment on motivational factors according to supplemental\nor primary income, or if workers engaged in this work as a choice or out of\nnecessity (Halvorsen and Morrow-Howell 2017; Manyika et al. 2016). Others use\na human resources-driven approach around autonomy and independence in work\ndesign (Reiche 2023).\n\nHowever, all these models were inadequate for understanding the experiences\nthis subset of workers described. While these models provide an important\ncontext to understand how different types of self-employment and independent\nwork interact, they are framed from the perspective of someone external\ndescribing the work arrangement. This paper offers a unique framework\ngenerated from an underserved portion of the population of workers without a\nbachelor\u2019s degree. This framework was derived from conversations with self-\nemployed individuals or those who aspired to work for themselves: how they\nspoke about their work experiences compared with their motivations for self-\nemployment. This framework also adds value to the literature and research on\ngig work and the informal economy as it makes visible self-employment and\nindependent work that are often invisible and difficult to track through\npublicly available data and other quantitative measures.\n\n## Conclusions and path forward\n\n...[The] quarantine definitely taught me to take some of those side\nhustles...I keep up my side hustles seriously, because who knows if this will\nhappen again?...So, it\u2019s like, make sure you did something you love, like\nfigure out how to make a dollar off of it, because it\u2019s just not safe to have\nyour whole \u2013 like, my whole world fell apart. So, I\u2019m like don\u2019t take it for\ngranted. It might seem simple today, you know, but it might actually be\nsomething you can depend on.\n\n\u2013 Worker Voices participant\n\nThe Worker Voices Project captures the perspectives of workers without a\ncollege degree and those who worked in low-wage roles at a specific point in\ntime, the spring and summer of 2022, during which many discussed an interest\nin independent work as a means of increasing agency and income in their lives.\nThis conversation is important to further understand the nuance behind the\nrecord number of small business applications following the pandemic during\n2021\u20132024, a nearly 46 percent uptick in applications from the three previous\nyears, 2017\u20132020 (US Small Business Administration 2024). These qualitative\ndata may reflect some of the reasons many are interested in starting a\nbusiness, looking for agency, flexibility, independence, and economic\nstability after a period of intense economic instability. This Worker Voices\nProject special brief provides details and distinctions about the self-\nemployment decisions these workers made during the pandemic. It also\nillustrates a discrepancy between their experiences with self-employment and\ntheir motivations for pursuing it. The paper also documents that some\nparticipants may aspire to or be engaged in these opportunities because of\nstructural barriers like immigration status or incarceration history that\nrestrict their economic mobility in the labor market.\n\nThese qualitative data from workers raise important questions around the\nfuture of self-employment: Is the increase in self-employment and independent\nwork a structural change to our economy or just a cyclical change? What do\nthese activities mean for the changing nature of work and labor market\nattachment? And these experiences open new questions around the quality of\nindependent work activities.\n\nScholars in this field also are pondering the question, to what extent is the\nincreased interest in self-employment simply a reaction to the pandemic and a\ncyclical economic trend or a structural change that may impact work and self-\nemployment for years to come (Asturias et al. 2021; Eberly et al. 2023)? Our\ndata do not empirically answer this question. What our data do is shed light\non the perspectives of those in this cohort and indicate further study is\nnecessary to fully understand these changing patterns. Many of the\nmotivational factors pushing and pulling people to self-employment reflect the\ntrends noted in a previous brief on job quality (Dunne and Wardrip 2023) and\npersonal investment (Williams and Bogue Simpson 2024). These job quality\nconsiderations may cause workers to seek self-employment rather than\nparticipate in a labor market in which they consistently find low-job-quality\nopportunities. These findings reinforce the push into income-patching self-\nemployment that many workers in low-wage roles or those without a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree expressed in this study.\n\nOther questions arise around the future of work and the implications of self-\nemployment in the role of labor market attachment. Researchers have documented\nthe changing nature of work over the past 50 years, with contingent work\nrelationships shifting the concept of who is and is not an employee (Eberhart\net al. 2022), as well as companies contracting to third-party vendors work\nthat they previously hired for in-house (Weil 2017). Knowing these larger\ntrends and concerns about technology distributing work through apps and\nplatforms, this study may provide some insight into the experience of some\nlow-wage workers who are part of these trends. That said, the concerns around\nagency, control, and job stability are not solved currently by technology and\nraise implications for the future of work.\n\nParticipants in the Worker Voices Project predominately described experiences\nwith independent work not aligning with their expectations. While some saw the\nbenefits in the increased agency and flexibility, others often took on the\nrisk of expenses (e.g., cars, gas) and demands on their schedules (including\nworking nights and weekends) to meet customer demands. Participants aspired to\nincrease both their agency and upward mobility in self-employment, but the\nreality of the experiences we catalogued often did not meet these\nexpectations. The shift to independent work and the economic calculations that\neach family must make in relation to the costs and benefits raise additional\nquestions about the frontier of self-employment for those in lower-income\nhouseholds. Questions remain surrounding the quality of independent work\nexperiences for workers without a bachelor\u2019s degree and workers in low-wage\njobs\u2014including whether and to what degree this work increases their earning\npotential and economic mobility.\n\nWe hope this paper adds nuance to our understanding of self-employment\nmotivation, actuation, and the disconnect between worker motivations and\nactual experiences. This paper speaks to how some participants in our focus\ngroups discussed the lack of agency in previous employment experiences and how\nsome saw self-employment as a way to regain agency in their lives. These\ntopics identify new discussions around the changing nature of work and how\nthese workers are rethinking the traditional employer\u2013employee relationship.\nMany participants described experiences that often did not meet their\nexpectations for job quality, even while many were optimistic and aspired to\nworking for themselves one day.\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia, the Federal Reserve System, or Fed Communities.\n\nPlease cite this work as: Piazza, Merissa and Ashley Putnam. 2024.

A convenience sample was used to identify and recruit workers and\njob seekers through more than 60 community partners across the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks. Participants were included if they were between 20 and 55 years\nold and had less than a bachelor\u2019s degree. The full project methodology for\nthe Federal Reserve System\u2019s Worker Voices Project includes detail on project\nrecruitment, sample selection, sample facilitation guides, and coding\nmethodology (Miller et al. 2023).\n\nFor this brief on self-employment, we used the initial codebook, codes, and\ntranscripts from the Worker Voices report. We used thematic, inductive\nanalysis of previously coded transcripts to identify additional instances of\nmentioning a preference for self-employment, aspirational entrepreneurship or\nself-employment, engagement as an entrepreneur, self-employment, independent\nwork, small business ownership, or if they were working in or tried a\nplatform-based gig work. From this, the authors identified additional passages\nand references to self-employment in the transcripts that were added to the\npool of references. We examined 141 references to these themes from 61\nparticipants found across focus group sessions identified in the initial and\nsubsequent coding phases.\n\n## Relevant demographics\n\nAs a part of the screening questionnaire, respondents were asked a variety of\ndemographic and employment questions. The following is a breakdown of the age,\nethnicity, race, gender, and whether the respondent identified as self-\nemployed. Counts are only for those participants who were identified to have\ncommented on any of the self-employment themes discussed in this report.\n\nAge  \n---  \nAges 20-24| 18%  \nAges 25-34| 39%  \nAges 35-44| 28%  \nAges 45-55| 13%  \nNo response| 2%  \nTotal| 100%  \nHispanic Ethnicity  \nNo| 49%  \nYes| 49%  \nNo Response| 2%  \nTotal| 100%  \nRace  \nAlaska Native or Other Indigenous| 5%  \nAmerican Indian| 6%  \nAsian or Asian American| 1.5%  \nBlack or African American| 52%  \nBrown| 1.5%  \nHispanic| 1.5%  \nLatino| 1.5%  \nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander| 1.5%  \nWhite| 28%  \nNo response| 1.5%  \nTotal| 100%  \nNote: Respondents could report more than one race  \nGender  \nFemale| 56%  \nMale| 43%  \nNo response| 1%  \nTotal| 100%  \nIdentified as Self-Employed  \nNo| 38%  \nYes| 24%  \nNo response| 38%  \nTotal| 100%  \n  \n## References\n\nAbada, Teresa, Feng Hou, and Yuqian Lu. 2014. \u201cChoice or Necessity: Do\nImmigrants and Their Children Choose Self-Employment for the Same Reasons?\u201d\nWork, Employment and Society 28(1): 78\u201394. doi.org/10.1177/0950017013511870\\\\.\n\nAbraham, Katharine G. 2019. \u201cMaking Ends Meet: The Role of Informal Work in\nSupplementing Americans\u2019 Income.\u201d RSF: Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the\nSocial Sciences 5(5): 110\u2013131. doi.org/10.7758/RSF.2019.5.5.06.\n\nAbraham, Katharine G., and Susan N.
