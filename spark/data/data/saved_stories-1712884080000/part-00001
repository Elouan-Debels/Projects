There are\ndifferent levels to this symbolism, some of which go deeper than others. This\nall gets pretty abstract in Baudrillard\u2019s text, so it\u2019s easiest to illustrate\nwith an example.\n\n  * Level 1: Listening to lots of music from My Chemical Romance because you sincerely enjoy their music. This is \u2018reality\u2019: it\u2019s not ironic, symbolic, or complicated.\n\n  * Level 2: Listening to lots of music from My Chemical Romance because you are \u2018emo\u2019. You are doing the thing because it aligns with the kind of person you see yourself as.\n\n  * Level 3: Saying you like My Chemical Romance because your friends do. It\u2019s cool to listen to them, you want to be like the cool people, you think there will be social benefit from saying this. You actually listen to them only occasionally.\n\n  * Level 4: Wearing a My Chemical Romance T-shirt and not knowing who they are.\n\nIf you pay attention to the wider world even a little bit, you\u2019ll realize how\nthis captures a lot of cultural expression. You can argue whether it\u2019s good,\nbad, or something else, but it\u2019s clearly a phenomenon that happens.\n\nThis also informs how I think about politics online.\n\n##\n\nTwo Dumb Arguments\n\nAs is often the case, in the last week I\u2019ve seen a couple of political\narguments online that made me angry. The first involved a leftist comedian\ndoing a routine about how people shouldn\u2019t vote for Joe Biden. It\u2019s worth\nquoting:\n\n> A lot of people want the Democrats to lose. A lot of people want the\n> Democrats to be punished and to suffer a historic and humiliating defeat.\n> And white liberals are very tense, right? They\u2019re like \u201cIs that what you\n> really want? You want Trump to come back? You want Trump to win?\u201d\n>\n> What I want is for you not to lecture us on how to respond to a genocide you\n> didn\u2019t try to stop, ok?\n>\n> \u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea for your community? Because it\u2019s your\n> community that\u2019s gonna suffer if Trump comes back. People like you are gonna\n> suffer, what do you think of that?\u201d\n>\n> I think that a political system that ultimately makes you choose genocidal\n> dementia and cheeseburger-powered fake tan Hitler is a system worth\n> overthrowing, okay? Maybe that is the conclusion you should be coming to,\n> instead of lecturing Black and Brown people on why they don\u2019t worship the\n> Democrats, okay?\n\nThere are a lot of things I could say here. I could say that a lot of this is\nfactually wrong - Joe Biden does not have dementia, Palestinians are being\nkilled but it\u2019s not a genocide, Biden\u2019s administration is very much trying to\nrein in Israel, etc. I could point out that the comedian\u2019s imaginary\nconversation partner raises valid points that he doesn\u2019t actually bother to\nrebut. I could point out that he sure is talking a lot about overthrowing the\nsystem while doing nothing to overthrow the system.\n\nI could point out that there are no jokes here, and that \u2018stand up comedian\nwho just lectures you without telling jokes\u2019 is the most shit-for-brains form\nof cultural commentary that exists. I could say that this guy is an Australian\ncitizen who lives in Melbourne and is performing his set in London, England,\nso why should I give a flying fuck what he thinks - if Trump is re-elected\nthis guy will be living safe and sound in an entirely different country,\nfacing zero consequences for his grandstanding.\n\nBut I\u2019m actually not going to say any of that just yet. I want to talk about a\ndifferent thing first.\n\nThere\u2019s been a round of discourse recently amongst different camps of the\nDemocratic party about whether Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor should\nretire and let Biden appoint a replacement before the election. This\n\u2018controversy\u2019 has a straightforward answer if you are a Democrat who cares\nabout achieving Democratic priorities. She absolutely should retire. The case\nis obvious and has been laid out by Matt Yglesias, Nate Silver, Josh Barro and\nothers. It\u2019s such an obvious answer that Silver calls it a \u2018political IQ\ntest\u2019. And yet:\n\nThere\u2019s a surprising amount of resistance to the obvious, clear logic that\nSotomayor should retire and allow a younger liberal justice to take her place.\nRuth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s failure to retire in a timely way cost Democrats her\nseat for at least a generation. If Sotomayor has an untimely death, Democrats\ncould realistically be facing 30-40 straight years of conservative control of\nthe Supreme Court. But you still see arguments like this one all over the\nplace saying \u201cCalls for Sonia Sotomayor to retire are \u2018ableism, pure and\nsimple\u2019\u201d.\n\nThere are a lot of things I could say about this article, if I wanted to be\nmean. I could say the entire thing is hot garbage that should never have made\nit past an editor\u2019s desk. I could say it\u2019s an op-ed pretending to be reporting\nunder the guise of \u2018advocates claim this is true and I only bothered to talk\nto the advocates\u2019 and that the author should have some courage and just write\nan op-ed. I could say worrying that a 70 year old overweight diabetic woman\nmight face a health crisis is fully rational and not \u2018ableism\u2019. The article\nsays that diabetic people are sometimes professional and Olympic athletes,\nwhich I could point out would be relevant if Sonia Sotomayor were also a 26\nyear old elite athlete in top physical condition. I could point out that the\nauthor doesn\u2019t even try to rebut the Sotomayor critics or engage with their\narguments, and instead retreats to complaints about \u2018ableism\u2019 as the Big Scary\nWord, ala Literally Violence.\n\nBut I think all of this would miss the point. Sotomayor\u2019s defenders don\u2019t\nactually want to accomplish Democratic priorities. Brave comedian system\noverthrowers don\u2019t actually want to help vulnerable people. They\u2019re operating\nat a different simulacra level.\n\n##\n\nActivism is Not a Social Club\n\nThe simulacra levels we talked about above in regards to music can also be\napplied to politics. The fights above are inside the\nDemocratic/liberal/progressive/etc camps, so I\u2019ll describe them that way (but\nthe same thing can be done on the right). I\u2019d write them out something like\nthis:\n\n  * Level 1: Trying to change the world for the better, and taking direct actions to make the world more liberal/progressive.\n\n  * Level 2: Passively supporting Democrats or liberal/progressive causes because you broadly identify as liberal or progressive.\n\n  * Level 3: Supporting various liberal/progressive causes because your in-group supports them, and there are social benefits and prestige to be gained from looking like you care a lot.\n\n  * Level 4: Wearing a Free Palestine T-shirt and not being able to locate Palestine on a map.\n\nSotomayor defenders and non-joke-telling comedians aren\u2019t operating on the\nfirst level. Their arguments aren\u2019t concrete arguments about what will really\nhelp everyday people. They\u2019re mostly operating at level three - supporting\nsomething to gain a particular kind of prestige or to be part of a group.\nLevel three contains the kind of person who wants to look like an activist,\nbut doesn\u2019t want to put in the real work and doesn\u2019t care about results at all\n(YOU ARE HERE, ONLINE POSTERS). They\u2019re very concerned that people know they\nhave the right opinions... and that\u2019s it.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber!\n\nMelbourne\u2019s least funny comedian is mostly concerned that we know he is very,\nvery outraged. Whether or not his actions improve the world is beside the\npoint. Sotomayor defenders are mostly concerned that she isn\u2019t bullied out of\nher powerful position. Whether or not her retirement is a strategically wise\nchoice is beside the point. They\u2019re defending her status because she\u2019s inside\ntheir in-group of Latina or disabled, not because it would help normal people.\n\nThis sort of thing doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes to pop culture.\nHardcore fans might call you a poser, but it\u2019s fine to be a casual fan of a TV\nseries who misses a bunch of episodes. It\u2019s fine to like a band for aesthetic\nor social reasons. There\u2019s no harm. But when it comes to politics this kind of\nengagement is absolutely poisonous.\n\nActivism is about winning. Activism is about changing the world in real,\nconcrete ways. Politics is for power.\n\nActivism is not a social club where the most important thing is to be morally\nrighteous. Activism is not about looking cool to other activists. Activism is\nnot dunking on people on social media. It is not when you ratio someone.\n\nActivism is not a participation trophy. You know what mostly doesn\u2019t matter?\nHaving a Latina woman on the Supreme Court. You know what does matter?\nImproving the lives of millions of real Latina women all over America. Any\nreal activist would trade the former for the latter in a heartbeat. Activism\nis about standing up for real, everyday people, not standing up for Sonia\nSotomayor\u2019s specific right to keep her job.\n\nActivism is not a set of boxes you check. I don\u2019t particularly care what you\ndid or what you organized if it doesn\u2019t lead to change. Activism is not about\nmedia stunts, virality or online popularity. Activism is not throwing soup.\n\nActivism is not about \u2018making a point\u2019 and it\u2019s not about \u2018being right\u2019.\nEverybody thinks they\u2019re right. Everybody thinks their preferred policies are\nthe best and morally righteous ones. It\u2019s not about making loud declarations.\nIt\u2019s not about renaming things.\n\nActivism is about winning. It is about power. It is about changing the world.\nIf what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t lead to concrete change, if it doesn\u2019t WIN, if it\nisn\u2019t about seizing real power and using it in the messy real world, it\u2019s not\nactivism. It\u2019s political masturbation. It makes you feel good but accomplishes\nnothing, and it probably makes a mess in the process.\n\nNow some well-meaning people out there will object to parts of this. They\u2019ll\nsay \u201cI\u2019m getting some great dunks online, and I\u2019m very popular and I\u2019m doing\nsocial-club-cool-kids behavior. But all of that is also helpful in winning!\nI\u2019m getting all the online clout, and will use it for actually productive\nefforts.\u201d\n\nThis can be true. If you want to make change happen, it\u2019s surely much easier\nif you have a big following, a large audience. Messaging strategy is a real\nthing. Some messages, media campaigns, and attempts to change the public\u2019s\nmind really do work. Posting can actually be useful... sometimes.\n\nBut some messaging strategies are useless, or they fail dramatically and just\nmake things worse. And what you see above is people who aren\u2019t bothering to do\nany sort of analysis of whether promoting a certain message will be good or\nbad in the long run. They\u2019re playing status games, not trying to improve\npeople\u2019s lives.\n\nShare\n\nIt\u2019s a tough pill for political activists to swallow - to realize more of you\nare doing useless or actively bad messaging than you\u2019d be comfortable\nadmitting. Are you sure you\u2019re one of the smart ones? Are you sure you\u2019re\noperating on the first level of simulacra? If you asked the people I\u2019m calling\nout above they\u2019d certain claim they care about the real impact of their words,\neven though it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t care how people live their lives in most cases - be a poser, wear the\nT-shirt of the band you\u2019ve never listened to. You do you. But if you\u2019re\nengaging in politics, for the love of God, make damn sure you stay focused on\nlevel one.\n\n### Subscribe to Infinite Scroll\n\nBy Jeremiah Johnson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThe Power of Posting\n\n15 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n15\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Activism is not a Social Club\n\nwww.infinitescroll.us\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nMatthew S.Scratchers and Smokes1 hr agoThere are a sneaky lot of folks out\nhere living level one lives and showing level four faces to the public,\nespecially online.
