Cook talks about poker hands and their\nprobabilities. In particular, he says\n\n> For a five-card hand, the probabilities of 0, 1, or 2 pair are 0.5012,\n> 0.4226, and 0.0475 respectively.\n\nUpon reading this, I assumed there\u2019d be an explanation of how these\nprobabilities were calculated. But no, he just leaves us hanging. So I sat\ndown and worked them out.\n\nThe probabilities are going to be calculated by dividing the number of ways we\ncan get a certain type of hand by the total number of possible hands. So let\u2019s\nstart by working out the denominator. There are 52 cards, so if we deal out 5\ncards, there are\n\npossible ways to do it. The symbol that looks sort of like a fraction without\nthe dividing line represents the binomial coefficient,\n\nThis is not only the coefficient of binomial expansions, it\u2019s also the number\nof ways we can choose k items out of n without regard to order, also referred\nto as the number of combinations.\n\nTo figure out the number of one-pair hands, imagine the deck laid out in 13\npiles: a pile of aces, a pile of kings, a pile of queens, and so on. We then\ndo the following:\n\n  1. Pick one of the piles. There are 13 ways to do this.\n  2. From that pile, choose 2 cards. There are\n\nways to do this.\n\n  3. Pick three other piles. There are\n\nways to do this.\n\n  4. Pick one card from each of these three piles. Since there are 4 cards in each pile, there are ways to do this.\n\nSo the total number of one-pair hands is\n\nand the probability of getting a one-pair hand is\n\nMoving on to two-pair hands, we start with the same 13 piles we had before. We\nthen do the following:\n\n  1. Pick two of the piles:\n\n  2. Pick two cards from each of these piles:\n\n  3. At this point, any of the remaining 44 cards will give us a two-pair hand.\n\nTherefore, the total is\n\nand the probability of drawing a two-pair hand is\n\nCounting the number of no-pair hands is a little trickier because we have to\nmake sure we don\u2019t mistakenly count better hands, i.e., straights and flushes.\nStarting again with our 13 piles, we do the following:\n\n  1. Pick 5 piles\n\n  2. Eliminate all the straights from this number. The number of straights is most easily done through simple enumeration:\n\nA\u20135, 2\u20136, 3\u20137, 4\u20138, 5\u20139, 6\u201310, 7\u2013J, 8\u2013Q, 9\u2013K, 10\u2013A\n\nSo 10 of our 1,287 possible pile selections will give us a straight. That\nleaves 1,277 non-straight possibilities.\n\n  3. Pick one card from each of the selected piles. That gives possibilities.\n  4. Eliminate the flushes from this set of possibilites. There are 4 flushes, leaving 1,020 possibilities.\n\nThese steps give us\n\nhands that are worse than one-pair. The probability of getting such a hand is\n\nI kept one more digit in my answers than John did, but they all match.\n\nPrevious post\n\n# Site search\n\n# Meta\n\n  * drdrang at leancrew\n  * Blog archive\n  * RSS feed\n  * JSON feed\n  * Mastodon\n  * GitHub repositories\n\n# Recent posts\n\n  * Counting poker hands\n  * My 2024 Eclipse\n  * Moment diagrams for continuous beams\n  * Moment diagrams for simply supported beams\n  * Structural continuity and the Francis Scott Key Bridge\n  * My Mac 40th anniversary draft\n  * A Typinator snippet for plotting\n  * Ladders and friction\n  * Again with man pages and BBEdit\n  * Holes in the Wolfram Knowledgebase\n  * Dates, triangles, and Python\n  * A couple of game followups\n\n# Credits\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nUnported License.\n\n\u00a9 2005\u20132023, Dr. Drang\n\n", "frontpage": false}
