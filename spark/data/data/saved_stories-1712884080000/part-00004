The test requirement takes effect immediately, which means that all\nstudents who apply to Caltech beginning in fall 2024 and would enroll in fall\n2025 are required to report test scores as part of their application.\n\nThis decision, which follows a recommendation from a faculty Advisory\nCommittee on Undergraduate Admissions Policy, reflects the judgment that\nstandardized testing provides admissions officers and faculty reviewers useful\ninformation about academic preparedness as part of a holistic consideration of\nall prospective students. In reinstating the standardized testing requirement,\nCaltech reaffirms its commitment as a community of scientists and engineers to\nusing all relevant data in its decision-making processes.\n\nThe committee found that, even with a testing moratorium in place, an\nincreasing number of applicants have been completing standardized tests each\nyear, with more than 95 percent of the most recently enrolled class having\ntaken standardized exams. But test scores have not been visible to the\nadmissions office until after final admissions decisions have been made. In\nthe coming admissions cycle, test scores will be used as an additional data\npoint in the context of a student's unique circumstances and experiences. The\nfaculty Advisory Committee noted that, \"We think it is critical that our\nadmissions office and the faculty who are reviewing applicants have available\nto them all the information that could shape their understanding of a\nprospective student's readiness for our rigorous academic programs.\"\n\nThe Institute is dedicated to attracting and educating the most talented and\npromising students in the world \u2013 students with deep interests in science,\nengineering, and mathematics who have the ability, energy, and resilience to\nflourish in the face of academic challenges, and who bring a diversity of\nexperiences and viewpoints to our community. \"We are proud of the students\nwe've enrolled over the last several years and confident in the steps we've\ntaken to enhance our ability to identify students who will succeed at \u2013 and\nbeyond \u2013 Caltech,\" says Provost David Tirrell.\n\nThe Institute paused its SAT and ACT test requirement in 2020 when it\nimplemented a moratorium in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced\naccess to standardized exams for students worldwide. The moratorium was\nextended in 2021, and then again in 2022. The Institute's decision ends the\nmoratorium, which originally was set to expire in 2025.\n\n### Subscribe\n\nThe Caltech Weekly\n\n### Share this\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Share\n\n### Tags\n\nInstitute affairs\n\nSee All News >\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\n1200 East California Boulevard\n\nPasadena, California 91125\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": true}
