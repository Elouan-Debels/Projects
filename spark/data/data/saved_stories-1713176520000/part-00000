However, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which can cause\nand/or exacerbate hypertension, is being recognized as an underdiagnosed and\nmodifiable risk factor. The most common sleep-rated breathing disorder, OSA is\ncaused by the collapse of the upper airway during sleep, which leads to\nfrequent sleep interruptions, up to 30 times an hour, all night long.\n\nMore Stories\n\nBiology\n\nBirds sing in their sleep \u2013 and now we can decipher their dreams\n\nSpace\n\nJapan to build NASA a Moon camper van you can drive without spacesuits\n\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered via a face or nasal mask\nis often used to treat OSA. An alternative treatment is a mandibular\nadvancement device or MAD. Similar to a bite guard, a MAD holds the lower jaw\n(mandible) and tongue forward, keeping the airway open. There are pros and\ncons for both. CPAP, while effective, tends to be uncomfortable, so it\u2019s\npoorly tolerated. MADs are less intrusive, but studies have shown they\u2019re\noutperformed by CPAP when it comes to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the\nnumber of times airflow fully (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) stops per hour\nduring sleep.\n\nA nasal CPAP device\n\nDepositphotos\n\nResearchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the University\nof Sydney conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness\nof MAD and CPAP in reducing hypertension in patients with moderate-to-severe\nOSA.\n\n\u201cLooking at the totality of evidence available in all the literature, it is\nstill reasonable to say that CPAP is the first-line treatment until we have\nmore data on the MAD,\u201d said Ronald Lee Chi-Hang, professor of medicine at NUS\u2019\nYong Loo Lin School of Medicine and corresponding author of the study.\n\u201cHowever, for patients who cannot truly tolerate or accept using a CPAP, we\nshould be more open-minded in looking for an alternative therapy such as a\nMAD, which, based on our study, numerically had a better blood pressure\nreduction in patients compared with a CPAP.\u201d\n\nBeing a non-inferiority trial, the study tested whether a new treatment (MAD)\nis not worse than an established one (CPAP). The researchers recruited 220\nparticipants with moderate-to-severe OSA and randomized them to either CPAP or\nMAD. Of the participants, 44.5% were overweight, and 49.5% were obese. The\nmost prevalent high cardiovascular risk factors were coronary artery disease\n(60.9%) and diabetes (59.1%), with 44.1% of participants having had\nhypertension for more than 10 years.\n\nAt baseline and six-month follow-up, both groups underwent 24-hour ambulatory\nblood pressure (BP) monitoring, completed a questionnaire on sleepiness, and\nhad blood tests for cardiovascular markers. Both devices tracked use. The\nprimary outcome was the difference in 24-hour mean BP between baseline and\nfollow-up.\n\nMADs significantly reduced 24-hour mean BP from baseline to six-month follow-\nup, which was not significant in the CPAP group. The decrease in the MAD group\nwas, on average, 1.64 mmHg larger than the CPAP group. Compared to the CPAP\ngroup, the MAD group also showed a larger between-group reduction in all\nambulatory BP measures, especially nighttime BP, and more participants\nachieved a systolic BP (the top number) below 120 mmHg. None of the\nparticipants experienced symptomatic low BP or hypotension. From these data,\nthe researchers ascertained that a MAD was non-inferior to CPAP.\n\nAn oral device like this SomnoDent Flex\u00ae is just as effective as CPAP in\nreduced sleep apnea-related high blood pressure\n\nSomnoMed AU\n\nThe researchers also looked at differences in adherence between the two\ndevices; that is, how long participants stuck with their allocated treatment.\nOver half (56.5%) assigned to the MAD used it for six or more hours each night\non average over the study period, while 23.2% of CPAP users did the same.\n\n\u201cThe MAD patients simply used the device longer,\u201d Chi-Hang said. \u201cThat also\nmight explain why the blood pressure reduction at nighttime, when the patients\nare actually using it, had a better reduction in the MAD arm.\u201d\n\nAdherence to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine\u2019s (AASM) recommendation of\nfour or more hours of use in at least 70% of nights overall was similar\nbetween groups, with 69.4% of the MAD group and 64.3% of the CPAP group\nmeeting this recommendation. Both groups had reduced daytime sleepiness, and\nthere were no between-group differences in cardiovascular biomarkers.\n\n\u201cPeople should be aware that over 400 million people globally have moderate-\nto-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and it is underdiagnosed and may be a\ncontributing factor to their high blood pressure,\u201d said Chi-Hang. \u201cEspecially\nfor patients whose blood pressure is hard to control or who have a lot of\nexcessive daytime sleepiness, go see a physician about sleep apnea and get\ntreated if necessary.\u201d\n\nThe study participants were of East Asian descent, and 85.5% were male.\nAlthough ethnic Chinese make up about 17.3% of the world\u2019s population, further\nresearch on more diverse populations is needed to determine whether the\nresults are generalizable. Further, the researchers note that adherence may\nhave been higher because the study was conducted during COVID-19 travel\nlockdowns.\n\nFurther studies are planned to examine the impacts of the devices on\ncognition.\n\nThe study, funded by the Singapore Ministry of Health, was published in the\nJournal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nSource: NUS via Scimex\n\nView gallery - 3 images\n\n## Tags\n\nMedicalSleepApneaNational University of SingaporeUniversity of Sydney\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\n5 comments\n\nPaul McClure\n\nBefore realizing his writing passion, Paul worked as an intensive care nurse\nand a criminal defense lawyer for many years.

The BEST by far is a chin strap to comfortably hold the jaw up with\ntongue forward and airway open.\n\nRusty April 12, 2024 05:50 PM\n\nMouth breather here. CPAP for almost 6 years.

They position the mandible\nand tongue in a more anterior position thereby opening the airway.\n\nTheodore G.
