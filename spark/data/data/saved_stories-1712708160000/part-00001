He holds a PhD in biostatistics from\nHarvard. Prior to Keeper, he taught statistics at a liberal arts college. He\nstill likes wearing elbow patches.\n\nUpdated\n\nNovember 2, 2023\n\nReviewed by\n\nReviewed by\n\nAI chat assistants are the subject of an arms race in the consumer tax prep\nspace, with Intuit TurboTax and H&R Block investing heavily in AI-powered chat\nassistants. But the initial reviews of these features have been poor: a recent\nWashington Post article tested the TurboTax and H&R Block chatbots and found\nthey were wrong or not helpful up to half the time.\n\nWe at Keeper have also invested a lot of energy in AI-backed live tax\nassistance. We\u2019ve learned the hard way that simply hooking ChatGPT up to your\nproduct with a few tax-related resources isn\u2019t nearly good enough. You need a\nrobust embedding system, well-calibrated evaluations, integrated human expert\nreview, contextual hooks to encourage users to try this new experience... In\nshort, not all chatbots are created equal.\n\nSo we asked the exact same questions that stumped the TurboTax and H&R Block\nbots to Keeper\u2019s AI assistant. We present a few of its responses below to\nillustrate some of the lessons we\u2019ve learned along the way.\n\nQ: I paid for my grandchild\u2019s college tuition, can I claim the education tax\ncredit?  \n---  \nKeeper's Response| TurboTax's Response| HR Block's Response  \nNo, you cannot claim the education tax credit for paying your grandchild's\ncollege tuition unless you claim them as a dependent on your tax return. The\nstudent must be listed as a dependent for you to be eligible for education tax\ncredits like the American Opportunity Credit or the Lifetime Learning Credit.|\nOkay, I searched the TurboTax Community for recommended answers and found the\nfollowing: \u201cLet me see if I understand what you said: Your employer sent about\n$1820 to the school and the school gave you about $730 in scholarship, for a\ntotal of $2550. The school doesn\u2019t realize that the $1820 is only a loan, so\nthey\u2019ve entered it in box 5 of the 1098-T as a scholarship. The easiest thing\n...| Yes, you may be able to claim the education tax credit if you paid for\nyour grandchild's college tuition. In order to claim the education credit, you\nmust meet all three of the following requirements: 1. You paid qualified\neducation expenses for an eligible student. 2. The eligible student is either\nyourself, your spouse, or a dependent for whom you claim an exemption on your\ntax return. 3. You meet the income limits and other requirements for the\nspecific education credit you are claiming. If you meet these requirements and\npaid the qualified expenses for your grandchild's college tuition, you may be\neligible to claim the education credit. However, please note that the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the exemption amount for tax years beginning\nafter December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. This means that for tax\nyears 2018 through 2025, if you would have claimed a dependency exemption for\nyour grandchild, you may still be eligible to claim the education credit. It's\nimportant to review the specific requirements and limitations of the education\ncredit you intend to claim. H&R Block Online can assist you in determining\nyour eligibility for the education credit and help you claim it correctly.  \n  \nThe incumbent bot responses exemplify two of the major challenges in\ngenerating helpful responses:\n\n  1. Retrieving the relevant tax code information, and\n  2. Synthesizing that information into an actionable, easy-to-understand response\n\nTurboTax fails at part 1: The bot pulls irrelevant information from a TurboTax\nCommunity forum thread. Keeper solves this problem by 1) curating a knowledge\nbase of tax law documents and expert-written articles, and 2) using a cutting-\nedge embedding model to retrieve only the most relevant portions of these\ndocuments before generating the response.\n\nH&R Block\u2019s bot retrieves the relevant tax code information, but fails at part\n2. Its response requires a lot of reading/parsing/synthesis on the user\u2019s\npart. It\u2019s correct but it\u2019s not *helpful*.\n\nIn other words, returning a factual answer isn\u2019t the only thing that matters.\nOur automated evaluation system employs a suite of criteria, all of which must\nbe met for a response to be satisfactory. This H&R Block response satisfies\nthe \u201cfactuality\u201d criterion, but it fails \u201csuccinctness\u201d (the user doesn\u2019t need\nto know this much!) and \u201cdelight\u201d (so much reading! taxes feel *difficult*!).\n\nKeeper\u2019s answer is conversational. It raises the concept of claiming the\ngrandparent as a dependent. If the user has questions about this, they can ask\na follow-up question. Our users do this all the time: 80% of our conversations\ninvolve multiple user messages.\n\nA good accountant doesn\u2019t just dump info on you. They meet you where you are\nand help you make the best decisions!\n\nQ: We live in California, but my daughter will go to Arizona as a freshman in\ncollege, which state should my daughter file?  \n---  \nKeeper's Response| TurboTax's Response| HR Block's Response  \nIf your daughter is a resident of California and only moves to Arizona for\ncollege, maintaining her permanent residence in California, she would\ntypically file a state tax return in California. If she earns income in\nArizona, she may also need to file a non-resident tax return there.| Okay, I\nsearched TurboTax Help for related answers and found the following: Am I\neligible for a state renter\u2019s tax credit? How do I file an extension for my\npersonal state taxes? Which tax breaks can help with education costs? How do\nyou remove the American opportunity tax credit from turbo tax?| If your\ndaughter will be attending college in Arizona as a freshman, she will need to\nfile a tax return in both California and Arizona. As a California resident,\nshe will need to file a California tax return and report all income earned\nwhile she was a resident of California. This includes any income from sources\nwithin California. Additionally, as a student in Arizona, she will also need\nto file an Arizona tax return and report any income earned while she was a\nresident of Arizona. This includes any income from sources within Arizona. ...  \n  \nAgain, the TurboTax bot fails to retrieve relevant information, instead\nreturning irrelevant search results. The H&R Block response is misleading: it\nassumes the daughter will have income in Arizona. But if she doesn\u2019t, she\nwon\u2019t need to file a return in Arizona. This illustrates another advantage of\nKeeper\u2019s conversation-oriented approach: if the bot makes an inappropriate\nassumption, the user can ask or clarify. In this case our bot handles the\nsituation with a conditional answer (\u201cif she earns income...\u201d) which\nsimplifies things further \u2013 the user doesn\u2019t need to ask a follow-up question\nat all.\n\nUnfortunately, when the H&R Block makes a mistaken assumption, there\u2019s no way\nto correct it because it doesn\u2019t have any conversational memory: it treats\neach question as the beginning of a new conversation. LLMs are designed to\nhandle conversations \u2013 why not take advantage of this capacity?\n\nIn the language of our automated evaluation system, the H&R Block response has\nfailed the \u201ccomprehensiveness\u201d criterion. By assuming the daughter has income\nin Arizona, it fails to completely address the user\u2019s more general question.\n\nQ: We installed a new air conditioner; can I get any tax credit?  \n---  \nKeeper's Response| TurboTax's Response| HR Block's Response  \nYes, if your new air conditioner is energy-efficient and meets specific\ncriteria, you might be eligible for the Residential Renewable Energy Tax\nCredit. This credit allows you to deduct a portion of the cost directly from\nyour tax bill, rather than reducing your taxable income.| Okay, I searched the\nTurboTax Community for recommended answers and found the following: \"Enter\nyour student info (including your 1098-T) at:Federal Taxes Tab (Personal for\nH&B version)Deductions & Credits-Scroll down to:--Education --Education\nExpenses BUT. you cannot claim a credit if you are, or can be, claimed as a\ndependent by someone else. Furthermore, theres a new urban myth am...| I'm\nsorry, but as an AI, I can't address that. You can ask me about H&R Block's\nworld-class tax preparation and financial products. Not sure where to begin?\nPick one of the topics below to get started.Maximize my refund Minimize what I\nowe Find my forms Which forms do I need? Find my deductions, credits, and\nadjustments  \n  \nThis time the H&R Block bot decides it can\u2019t answer the question. (If only the\nTurboTax bot had this much wisdom!) We can\u2019t know for sure why the H&R Block\nmade this determination, but it\u2019s reminiscent of another issue we\u2019ve dealt\nwith: tax code changes.\n\nRenewable energy is a rapidly changing area of the tax code. Incentives expire\nand are replaced by new ones annually, the IRS issues guidance continuously,\nand we\u2019re constantly incorporating new expert articles into our knowledge\nbase. Giving the correct answer here requires keeping your knowledge base up-\nto-date, resolving conflicts between sources of truth as they arise.\n\nWe\u2019ve discovered that a well-calibrated evaluation system is your best bet\nhere \u2013 it can easily double as a surveillance system for your knowledge base.\nEvery time we generate a response, we automatically evaluate whether the\nresources we retrieved contradict one another. If so, a human steps in to\nremove outdated information or add clarification. The result is a near-\nseamless knowledge base.\n\nBut even so, there will inevitably be gaps in the bot\u2019s knowledge. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d is not a good enough answer \u2013 the user is paying you to help them make\ndecisions. We\u2019ve solved this problem with a combination of chain-of-thought\nreasoning and old-fashioned human support. First, our bot assesses whether or\nnot it can answer the user\u2019s question. If not, it notifies a human tax expert\nto join the conversation. (In our system, humans handle about 5% of\nresponses.) After addressing the user\u2019s concern, the human provides feedback\non the bot\u2019s performance in the conversation. This feedback is incorporated\ninto the knowledge base, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement.\n\nUltimately the proof is in the pudding: our users love our live tax\nassistance. Why wouldn\u2019t they? They get instant help from a helpful, attentive\ntax expert. Our customer satisfaction has never been higher. Users can file\nmore quickly than ever. And our costs are down. That\u2019s what\u2019s possible when\nyou build a really great AI product.\n\nCompany| Contact| Country  \n---|---|---  \nAlfreds Futterkiste| Maria Anders| Germany  \nCentro comercial Moctezuma| Francisco Chang| Mexico  \nErnst Handel| Roland Mendel| Austria  \n  \nPellentesque id nibh tortor id aliquet.
