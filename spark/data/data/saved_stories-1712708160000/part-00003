In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale human\n> evaluation of faithfulness and content selection on LLM-generated summaries\n> of fictional books. Our study mitigates the issue of data contamination by\n> focusing on summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire\n> annotators who have fully read each book prior to the annotation task to\n> minimize cost and cognitive burden. We collect FABLES, a dataset of\n> annotations on 3,158 claims made in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books, at\n> a cost of $5.2K USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on\n> faithfulness: Claude-3-Opus significantly outperforms all closed-source\n> LLMs, while the open-source Mixtral is on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. An\n> analysis of the annotations reveals that most unfaithful claims relate to\n> events and character states, and they generally require indirect reasoning\n> over the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have proven\n> reliable for factuality and coherence in other settings, we implement\n> several LLM raters of faithfulness and find that none correlates strongly\n> with human annotations, especially with regard to detecting unfaithful\n> claims. Our experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an\n> important future direction not only for summarization evaluation but also as\n> a testbed for long-context understanding. Finally, we move beyond\n> faithfulness by exploring content selection errors in book-length\n> summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors related to crucial\n> narrative elements and also identify a systematic over-emphasis on events\n> occurring towards the end of the book.\n\nComments:| preprint - 39 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.01261 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.01261v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.01261arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yekyung Kim [view email] [v1] Mon, 1 Apr 2024 17:33:38 UTC (20,930 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled FABLES: Evaluating faithfulness and content\nselection in book-length summarization, by Yekyung Kim and 7 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
