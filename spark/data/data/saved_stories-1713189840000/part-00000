More on that below, and in upcoming posts.\n\nASU has been incredibly good to me. The Cronkite School\u2019s founding dean, Chris\nCallahan, hired me in 2008. He persuaded me that he and ASU\u2019s president,\nMichael Crow, intended to turn the school into the finest institution of its\nkind. I believe it did become that. I was fortunate to be there as it\nhappened, and am grateful to have worked with such outstanding people:\npractitioners, scholars, and staff \u2014 and, not least, the inspiring students.\n\nFor the past decade or so my Cronkite focus has been on media literacy. In\n2017, colleague Eric Newton and I co-founded something called the News Co/Lab.\nWe then had the immense good fortune to put the project in the hands of Kristy\nRoschke, who has a PhD in media literacy and is one of the most effective\npeople I\u2019ve ever seen in getting stuff done. Kristy spearheaded the creation\nof bachelors degree in Digital Media Literacy, and her many other\ncontributions to the Cronkite School \u2014 and the vital cause of media literacy \u2014\nare extraordinary.\n\nWhen Chris Callahan \u2014 a great dean who\u2019s now the president of the University\nof the Pacific \u2014 first approached me about coming to ASU, I asked some friends\nwho were familiar with higher education what they knew about the place. One of\nthem said that the university had a president whose goal was to blow up higher\neducation and remake it for the 21st Century. That sounded useful!\n\nASU used to be considered a \u201cparty school\u201d \u2014 but today it\u2019s a powerhouse. Crow\nand his colleagues deserve enormous credit for fostering that emergence. But I\nthink their greatest achievement lives in the way they defined university\u2019s\ncore principles. Here\u2019s ASU\u2019s mission statement:\n\n> ASU is a comprehensive public research university, measured not by whom it\n> excludes, but by whom it includes and how they succeed; advancing research\n> and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for\n> the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it\n> serves.\n\nPlease read that carefully, if you haven\u2019t seen it before. I believe the words\n\u201c...not by whom it excludes, but by whom it includes...\u201d go to the heart of\nwhat state universities, in particular, should be but far too often are not.\nASU walks the talk, and the state of Arizona will be far, far better for it as\ntime goes on \u2014 if state and national politics permit.\n\nThere\u2019s a very real possibility that right-wing extremists and grifters will\nbe in charge of the federal government after this year\u2019s elections. One of\ntheir goals is to destroy public education as we know it. Trump and his\nacolytes \u2014 now in control of one of America\u2019s two major political parties and\nmany state governments \u2014 threaten far more than public education, of course.\nThey\u2019re aiming to bring down democracy itself.\n\nWhich brings me to what\u2019s next on my personal agenda. Here\u2019s my new mission\nstatement, if you will:\n\n> I want to help people who are working to save democracy, and by extension\n> freedom of expression, in part by helping journalism perform its most\n> essential role.\n\nI am absolutely convinced that journalism\u2019s most essential role at this\ncritical moment goes far, far beyond what it\u2019s doing. The status quo in\npolitical (and related) coverage consists of sporadically noting that gosh-\nmaybe-there\u2019s-a-problem, while sticking mostly to journalistic business as\nusual. The status quo is journalistic malpractice.\n\nIt would be unfair not to note that at least a few journalists are meeting the\nchallenge (and I highlight them whenever possible). But we have to see things\nclearly: Most media outlets are not coming close.\n\nAnd even the best work, with exceedingly few exceptions, mostly falls short of\na journalistic role \u2014 albeit a discomfiting one \u2014 that feels increasingly\nnecessary: as outright activists in defense of democracy. (I believe\njournalism schools should also adopt this role as part of their own missions.)\n\nDemocracy needs more than journalists to survive, and it might fall even if\nthey do become activists in its defense. But they should understand what their\nrole will be if it does fall: They\u2019ll either be collaborators with dictators,\nor members of the resistance.\n\nWhat does my new mission statement mean in practice? I have a lot of ideas,\nand several specific plans. I\u2019ll be describing them in more detail in upcoming\nposts here and elsewhere. Meanwhile, I\u2019m having lots of conversations with\npeople who understand the dangerous situation we face.\n\nI never envisioned my \u201cretirement\u201d going this way. Nor, however, did I imagine\nthat I would stop working at things I care about; binge-watching and binge-\nreading in a recliner was never the plan, either. In the end, we do what we\ncan, when we must, and hope it makes a difference.\n\nPosted in ASU, Education, Journalism | 4 Comments\n\n## 4 thoughts on \u201cWhat\u2019s next for me...\u201d\n\n  1.
