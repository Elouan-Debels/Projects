Should I answer my cellphone in a\ncrowded place? (No.) Where do I stand on an escalator? (On the right\u2014let\npeople walk on the left.) And what are the social rules when it comes to\nrecharging my electric vehicle? Thankfully, that last question has now been\naddressed by Debrett's, a British publisher with a name now synonymous with\netiquette, in the recently published 2024 edition of \"A-Z of Modern Manners.\"\n\nDebrett's has been publishing guides on manners and etiquette since the last\ntime electric vehicles were a thing, but it first put together a list of dos\nand do-nots for EV drivers last year as a standalone guide with British car\nbrand Vauxhall. Now, it has added the advice to this year's edition of the\ngeneral etiquette guide.\n\nAlthough Debrett's is writing for a UK audience, with its ingrained ideas\nabout class structure, the advice also applies to this side of the Atlantic,\nand it's probably timely now that Tesla is opening up its Supercharger network\nto non-Tesla EVs. Here is some of the advice.\n\n## Don\u2019t cut in line\n\nAs EV adoption grows, particularly in places like California, some charging\nlocations can generate demand that outstrips the number of charging plugs\navailable. If every charger at a station is occupied, see if there's a queue\nyou're supposed to join\u2014being unaware and jumping in front of other drivers\nwho have been waiting longer than you won't make a good impression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you find yourself waiting with other EV drivers, make small talk to pass\nthe time. \"If you establish a relationship with fellow motorists, they\u2019re much\nmore likely to be accommodating when it comes to negotiating charging time,\"\nthe guide notes.\n\nDebrett's also suggests you park neatly within the lines and don't straddle\nspaces. This may be less of a problem in the US, where we make our bays big,\nbut remember that \"no electric vehicle has special priority, whether that be a\nfull EV or Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV).\"\n\n## Know something about your EV\n\nBeing aware of your car's charging needs is important. For example, PHEV\ndrivers have no need for DC fast chargers unless they are in a CHAdeMO-\nequipped Mitsubishi Outlander, so don't take your AC-only vehicle to a DC-only\nlocation.\n\nAnd for EV drivers at DC fast chargers, you should know how long it takes your\ncar to reach an 80 percent state of charge. After this point, an EV battery\nsignificantly restricts the amount of charge it draws, throttling back the\ncharger in the process. Charging from 80 to 100 percent can take as long as 10\nto 80 percent takes, so plan on leaving the public charger at that point\nunless absolutely necessary.\n\n## Be polite\n\nWhile you shouldn't jump the queue, Debrett's says it's OK to discreetly check\nhow long another car has left in its session. If you see it's almost done and\nthat a driver is with that car, you can politely ask how much longer they're\ngoing to take. For example: \"I hope you don\u2019t mind me asking, but I notice\nyou\u2019re nearly fully charged. Would it be okay if I started to plug in soon?\"\nAnd remember to be thankful if they say yes.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n84\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
