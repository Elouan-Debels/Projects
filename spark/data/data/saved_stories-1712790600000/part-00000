Waymo previewed the project in a blog post in 2022.\n\nWaymo said Tuesday that more than 50,000 people were on its waitlist to use\nthe service. The company did not say how many users it would allow to fully\nuse the app starting Wednesday. Last month, the company said it was starting\nwith a Los Angeles fleet of fewer than 50 cars covering a 63-square-mile area\nfrom Santa Monica to downtown L.A. Los Angeles County has a population of 9.7\nmillion people.\n\nThe service works similarly to other ride-hailing smartphone apps such as\nFlywheel, Lyft and Uber, except that Waymo\u2019s vehicles have no human drivers\npresent. Riders follow instructions on the app and through the vehicle\u2019s sound\nsystem, though Waymo workers can assist remotely.\n\nRobotaxis are getting more buzz as the technology advances in fits and starts.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said Friday that Tesla would reveal a robotaxi product in\nAugust, though he gave no details. Cruise, a General Motors subsidiary that\npaused its robotaxi service last year after one of its vehicles failed to\ndetect a pedestrian underneath it, said Tuesday that it would reintroduce\nhuman-driven vehicles in select cities, including Phoenix, as a step back\ntoward driverless operations.\n\nVarious China-based tech startups are also testing self-driving cars on\nCalifornia roads, drawing scrutiny from lawmakers.\n\nBut for now, Waymo\u2019s only competition is traditional, human-driven car\nservices.\n\nWaymo\u2019s expansion to Los Angeles will bring autonomous for-profit taxis to the\nnation\u2019s second-largest city \u2014 and to a city long synonymous with car travel.\nWaymo already operates commercial robotaxi services in San Francisco and\nPhoenix.\n\nChris Ludwick, Waymo\u2019s product management director, called the Los Angeles\nmove a milestone.\n\n### Recommended\n\nSports\n\n### Sports'What's up, brother?': How a rising livestreamer's celebrations made\nit to the big leagues\n\nCulture & Trends\n\n### Culture & TrendsCalifornia judge dismisses one of 'Are We Dating the Same\nGuy?' lawsuits\n\n\u201cThe reception from Angelenos so far has been exceptional, and we look forward\nto welcoming more riders into our service over time,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nWaymo said it informed its test riders about the change Monday in an email,\nwhich someone also posted to Reddit.\n\n0 seconds of 4 minutes, 17 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n04:17\n\n04:17\n\nAugust 2023: Are driverless cars ready to hit the road full time?\n\n04:18\n\nRobotaxis have faced criticism on multiple fronts, from the threat they pose\nto drivers\u2019 jobs to the mistakes they\u2019ve made blocking city buses or emergency\nvehicles. Under California law, driverless cars can\u2019t be given traffic\ntickets, and they could make traffic congestion worse.\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Transportation said the Waymo expansion was\nhappening too soon, without enough local oversight of autonomous vehicle\noperations, but in an order last month state officials said that those\nconcerns were unfounded.\n\nSupporters of robotaxis have countered that human drivers have a terrible\nsafety record, with traffic deaths topping 40,000 a year in the U.S. Waymo has\nnot reported a death or serious injury from its technology, and Waymo vehicles\nappear to be generally more observant of traffic laws than human drivers are,\naccording to journalists who have ridden in them.\n\nIn San Francisco, the futuristic nature of driverless vehicles has become a\ntourist attraction.\n\nOpponents of autonomous taxi expansions, including the Teamsters, have vowed\nto slow down the growth of companies such as Waymo. A bill pending in the\nCalifornia Senate would give cities and counties authority over robotaxi\nservices \u2014 a power that currently resides with state government agencies. A\nhearing on that bill is scheduled for next week.\n\nDavid Ingram\n\nDavid Ingram covers tech for NBC News.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWE AND OUR PARTNERS USE COOKIES ON THIS SITE TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE, PERFORM\nANALYTICS, PERSONALIZE ADVERTISING, MEASURE ADVERTISING PERFORMANCE, AND\nREMEMBER WEBSITE PREFERENCES.
