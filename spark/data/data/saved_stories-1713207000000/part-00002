So Are the Scams\n\nAfter cryptocurrency prices spiked, scammers have flooded the market with fake\ntokens that promise investors great riches, but leave them penniless. It's\nworking.\n\nILLUSTRATION: BEN HINKS; GETTY IMAGES\n\nRyan has been self-employed for 15 years. He works long hours, on two small\nmanufacturing businesses. But he finds time to daydream about getting in early\non a cryptocurrency that goes to the moon.\n\nIn 2021, the price of Dogecoin, a crypto token started as a joke, increased\n70-fold in the span of four months. The total value of the coins in\ncirculation reached $70 billion. \u201cImagine being one of the early adopters of\nDogecoin,\u201d says Ryan.\n\nThe Dogecoin format has been riffed upon by hundreds of copycat memecoins.\nThey serve no purpose and promise no innovation, yet a few have charted a\nsimilarly precipitous rise in price. Ryan, who asked to be identified by first\nname only so he could speak about financial matters, invests in new memecoins\nas a form of \u201centertainment,\u201d he says, careful never to spend more than he can\nafford to lose. But he\u2019s in it for a shot at riches, too.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThe market for memecoins\u2014predicated on the idea that anyone can become\nwealthy, if only they are quick enough off the mark\u2014has created a window of\nopportunity for scam artists. The scams come in different flavors, but lately,\nplaying on the desire among investors to get in before the crowd, scammers\nhave taken to advertising early-bird rates for those that buy in before a\ntoken is released.\n\nThe number of meme token presales increased five-fold between February and\nMarch, when the price of bitcoin surged to record heights, data provided by\ncrypto security company Blockaid shows. A third of the 369 presales in March\nalone were identified as scams by Blockaid. \u201cScammers try to feed on the\nFOMO,\u201d says Blockaid cofounder Ido Ben-Natan.\n\nEarlier this year, Ryan was casting about for a new investment. He put $750\ninto the presale of a token named Rebel Satoshi. The website was dressed with\ncharming artwork, investors could pay by credit card, and an apparent press\nrelease about it had appeared on Yahoo! Finance, all of which gave him\nconfidence in the token\u2019s legitimacy, at least at first. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long\nbefore I started having doubts,\u201d says Ryan.\n\nBefore the token was set to be released, claims Ryan, the developers behind\nRebel Satoshi changed the rules. While investors were first promised their\nfull allocation prior to launch, it would now be meted out in increments every\nMonday over a period of eight weeks. Each of those transactions had an\nassociated fee, which could now cumulatively exceed the total value of a small\ninvestor\u2019s stake. Ryan speculates that the developers had sold more tokens in\nthe presale than they intended to issue, and were therefore trying to prevent\nsome people from claiming their share. He began to investigate.\n\nWithin days of the Rebel Satoshi\u2019s March launch, its price had collapsed by 65\npercent. The Rebel Satoshi social accounts began to advertise a different\ntoken, now available for early purchase. Investors started to speculate the\nwhole thing might be a scam. On a Discord channel for the coin\u2019s investors,\nlegitimate queries were buried under a pile of spam. When Ryan started asking\npointed questions, he was banned by the moderators. In a marketing email sent\nin February, Rebel Satoshi claimed to have entered into a \u201cgroundbreaking\npartnership\u201d with crypto exchange BingX. But in an email message seen by\nWIRED, the exchange told Ryan there was no such partnership.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nRoku Breach Hits 567,000 Users\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Defended Against Iran's Drone and Missile Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nAn analysis performed on behalf of WIRED by crypto auditing company Hacken\nidentified red flags in the token\u2019s underlying code that might in some\ncircumstances betray a scam. Those included the absence of a function that\nprevents the issuer from stealing away with the pool of tokens set aside to\nmake trading on the secondary market possible, among others.\n\nSuspecting he has fallen victim to a scam, Ryan has tried to warn others away.\n\u201cWhile $750 is a lot to lose, it wouldn\u2019t be the end of me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\nfeel bad for those that really lost.\u201d\n\nWIRED did not receive a response to a request for comment sent to email\naliases listed on the Rebel Satoshi website.\n\nThe type of swindle Ryan suspects he has been caught in is known as a token\npresale scam. The format has been around for a while, but amidst the FOMO that\ncomes with skyrocketing cryptocurrency prices, people are particularly\nvulnerable. \u201cThese scams are broadly correlated to recent events,\u201d says Ben-\nNatan. \u201cThey aren\u2019t new phenomena, but they resurface.\u201d\n\nThere are variations on the theme, explains Ben-Natan, but the scams tend to\npull from the same playbook. Typically, the developers\u2014who remain\nanonymous\u2014invest in glossy social media marketing and paid-for placements in\ncrypto media outlets, advertising their token as the next hit memecoin and\npromising a discount to presale investors. In some cases, the token never\nmaterializes and the scammers make off with the funds. In others, the scammers\nabandon the project after selling off their own token holdings, or fail to\ndeliver on the promise of long-term support.\n\nIn the latter scenario, as with Rebel Satoshi, the line between a scam and an\nunsuccessful project is not always clear. And occasionally, because of the\nlarge sums of money involved, \u201csomething that wasn\u2019t a scam initially can\nlater transform into a scam,\u201d says Ben-Natan. \u201cAs time passes, the line can\nbecome blurrier.\u201d\n\nIn large part, these scams are conducted by sophisticated cybercriminal\ngroups, says Ben-Natan, not lone actors. A \u201cmicro-economy\u201d has formed around\nthem, he says, whereby separate parties might be responsible for managing\ndifferent elements of the charade, from the marketing campaign to the website\ndesign, and so on. The largest of these operations can rake in hundreds of\nmillions of dollars. \u201cThe numbers are staggering,\u201d says Ben-Natan.\n\nFor anybody willing to look for them, the warning signs are there, says Dyma\nBudorin, cofounder of Hacken. It is straightforward to check whether the\ncreators have revealed their identities, for example, or whether a system is\nin place that prevents them from dumping their holdings without warning. But\nin their eagerness to enter into new projects early, few investors bother with\ndue diligence. \u201cIt all comes from greediness,\u201d says Budorin.\n\nIn extreme cases, profit-hungry investors have taken to using \u201csniping bots\u201d\nto automatically purchase tokens as they first begin to trade on the open\nmarket, says Budorin, in a bid to get in early. Others are engaging in copy-\ntrading, a process whereby they blindly replicate someone else\u2019s trades, so\nthey don\u2019t have to do their own research. Both techniques increase the\nlikelihood someone is exposed to a scam.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nRoku Breach Hits 567,000 Users\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Defended Against Iran's Drone and Missile Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nAs bad as the memecoin-based scams have gotten, there\u2019s plenty of room still\nfor growth. \u201cThe people buying this stuff are mostly people already in the\nindustry,\u201d says Budorin. Presale events are marketed in niche circles, and\nmost new tokens aren\u2019t traded at launch on mainstream crypto platforms. But as\nnewcomers are drawn into the cryptosphere by the run-up in the price of\nmainstream tokens, like bitcoin, the pool of potential victims will expand.\n\nOne way to guard against these scams, says Budorin, would be to establish an\nindustry-wide standard for new crypto tokens, mandating features in the code\nthat prevent developers from abusing their control over large amounts of the\ntoken. In theory, provided someone were able to persuade exchanges and other\nstakeholders to adopt the new standard in unison, any tokens that diverged\ncould be readily identified and blacklisted. \u201cIt could be fixed relatively\neasily with a standard,\u201d says Budorin.\n\nBut in the meantime, investors hunting for outsized returns will continue to\nrisk buying into freshly minted memecoins. Ryan admits to partial\nresponsibility for having potentially lost his money to a scam. \u201cLooking back,\nI can barely blame them. I should have known better. There were plenty of\nflags,\u201d he says. Yet the incident has not dampened his enthusiasm for memecoin\ninvesting.\n\n\u201cThere are other tokens out there with a lot of potential, so I think I will\ncontinue putting money towards them, and stay away from the sketchy stuff,\u201d\nsays Ryan. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let it stop me.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
