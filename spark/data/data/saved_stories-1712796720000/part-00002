M. Hansteen on 2024-04-10 from the Puffy still\ndelivers dept.\n\nThe OpenSMTPD project has released its first post-OpenBSD 7.5 version,\nOpenSMTPD 7.5.0p0, with a number of notable improvements.\n\nThe announcement reads,\n\n>\n>     Subject: OpenSMTPD 7.5.0p0 Released From: Omar Polo <op () openbsd !\n> org> Date: 2024-04-10 8:38:12 OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the SMTP\n> protocol with some common extensions. It allows ordinary machines to\n> exchange e-mails with systems speaking the SMTP protocol. It implements a\n> fairly large part of RFC5321 and can already cover a large range of use-\n> cases. It runs on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Linux and OSX. The\n> archives are now available from the main site at www.OpenSMTPD.org\n\n>\n>     We would like to thank the OpenSMTPD community for their help in testing\n> the snapshots, reporting bugs, contributing code and packaging for other\n> systems. This is a major release with multiple bug fixes and new features.\n> Dependencies note: ================== This release builds with LibreSSL, or\n> OpenSSL >= 1.1. It's preferable to depend on LibreSSL as OpenSMTPD is\n> written and tested with that dependency. OpenSSL library is considered as a\n> best effort target TLS library and provided as a commodity, LibreSSL has\n> become our target TLS library. Changes in this release:\n> ======================== - Added support for RFC 7505 \"Null MX\" handling and\n> treat an MX of \"localhost\" as it were a \"Null MX\". - Allow inline tables and\n> filter listings in smtpd.conf(5) to span over multiple lines. - Enabled DSN\n> for the implicit socket too. - Added the `no-dsn' option for listen on\n> socket too. - Reject headers that start with a space or a tab. - Fixed\n> parsing of the ORCPT parameter. - Fixed table lookups of IPv6 addresses. -\n> Fixed handling of escape characters in To, From and Cc headers. - Run LMTP\n> deliveries as the recipient user again. - Disallow custom commands and file\n> reading in root's .forward file. - Do not process other users .forward files\n> when an alternate delivery user is provided in a dispatcher. - Unify the\n> table(5) parser used in smtpd(8) and makemap(8). - Allow to use table(5)\n> mappings on various match constraints. Portability fixes: - re-add\n> ASR_IPV4_BEFORE_IPV6 compile-time knob to prefer connecting to IPv6 instead\n> of IPv4. - update asr(3) and imsg with OpenBSD. - fixed rpath handling on\n> NetBSD in the configure.
