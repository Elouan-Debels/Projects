Now, two\nseparate research teams have found a way to rejuvenate these cells: make them\nmore like stem cells.\n\nBoth teams found that the bespoke immune cells called CAR T cells gain new\nvigour if engineered to have high levels of a particular protein. These\nboosted CAR T cells have gene activity similar to that of stem cells and a\nrenewed ability to fend off cancer. Both papers were published today in\nNature^1^,^2.\n\nThe papers \u201copen a new avenue for engineering therapeutic T cells for cancer\npatients\u201d, says Tuoqi Wu, an immunologist at the University of Texas\nSouthwestern in Dallas who was not involved in the research.\n\n## Reviving exhausted cells\n\nCAR T cells are made from the immune cells called T cells, which are isolated\nfrom the blood of person who is going to receive treatment for cancer or\nanother disease. The cells are genetically modified to recognize and attack\nspecific proteins \u2014 called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) \u2014 on the surface\nof disease-causing cells and reinfused into the person being treated.\n\nBut keeping the cells active for long enough to eliminate cancer has proved\nchallenging, especially in solid tumours such as those of the breast and lung.\n(CAR T cells have been more effective in treating leukaemia and other blood\ncancers.) So scientists are searching for better ways to help CAR T cells to\nmultiply more quickly and last longer in the body.\n\nCutting-edge CAR-T cancer therapy is now made in India \u2014 at one-tenth the cost\n\nWith this goal in mind, a team led by immunologist Crystal Mackall at Stanford\nUniversity in California and cell and gene therapy researcher Evan Weber at\nthe University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia compared samples of CAR T cells\nused to treat people with leukaemia^1. In some of the recipients, the cancer\nhad responded well to treatment; in others, it had not.\n\nThe researchers analysed the role of cellular proteins that regulate gene\nactivity and serve as master switches in the T cells. They found a set of 41\ngenes that were more active in the CAR T cells associated with a good response\nto treatment than in cells associated with a poor response. All 41 genes\nseemed to be regulated by a master-switch protein called FOXO1.\n\nThe researchers then altered CAR T cells to make them produce more FOXO1 than\nusual. Gene activity in these cells began to look like that of T memory stem\ncells, which recognize cancer and respond to it quickly.\n\nThe researchers then injected the engineered cells into mice with various\ntypes of cancer. Extra FOXO1 made the CAR T cells better at reducing both\nsolid tumours and blood cancers. The stem-cell-like cells shrank a mouse\u2019s\ntumour more completely and lasted longer in the body than did standard CAR T\ncells.\n\n## Master-switch molecule\n\nA separate team led by immunologists Phillip Darcy, Junyun Lai and Paul Beavis\nat Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia, reached the same\nconclusion with different methods^2. Their team was examining the effect of\nIL-15, an immune-signalling molecule that is administered alongside CAR T\ncells in some clinical trials. IL-15 helps to switch T cells to a stem-like\nstate, but the cells can get stuck there instead of maturing to fight cancer.\n\nThe team analysed gene activity in CAR T cells and found that IL-15 turned on\ngenes associated with FOXO1. The researchers engineered CAR T cells to produce\nextra-high levels of FOXO1 and showed that they became more stem-like, but\nalso reached maturity and fought cancer without becoming exhausted. \u201cIt\u2019s the\nideal situation,\u201d Darcy says.\n\nStem-cell and genetic therapies make a healthy marriage\n\nThe team also found that extra-high levels of FOXO1 improved the CAR T cells\u2019\nmetabolism, allowing them to last much longer when infused into mice. \u201cWe were\nsurprised by the magnitude of the effect,\u201d says Beavis.\n\nMackall says she was excited to see that FOXO1 worked the same way in mice and\nhumans. \u201cIt means this is pretty fundamental,\u201d she says.\n\nEngineering CAR T cells that overexpress FOXO1 might be fairly simple to test\nin people with cancer, although Mackall says researchers will need to\ndetermine which people and types of cancer are most likely to respond well to\nrejuvenated cells. Darcy says that his team is already speaking to clinical\nresearchers about testing FOXO1 in CAR T cells \u2014 trials that could start\nwithin two years.\n\nAnd Weber points to an ongoing clinical trial in which people with leukaemia\nare receiving CAR T cells genetically engineered to produce unusually high\nlevels of another master-switch protein called c-Jun, which also helps T cells\navoid exhaustion. The trial\u2019s results have not been released yet, but Mackall\nsays she suspects the same system could be applied to FOXO1 and that\noverexpressing both proteins might make the cells even more powerful.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01043-2\n\n## References\n\n  1.
