It\u2019s time for a new revolution!\n\n### Gmail turns 20, and Tuta Mail turns 10! A major milestone for two email\nproviders with very different philosophies - mass surveillance and greed,\nversus the right to privacy.\n\n2024-04-15\n\nAs Google\u2019s Gmail turns 20, Tuta Mail celebrates its 10 year milestone! Both\nemail services serve and treat their customers in very different ways. Let\u2019s\ntake a look at how Google\u2019s Gmail revolutionized the email sphere, how it\nexploded to fame and why we need a new revolution today.\n\nSIGN UP\n\n### Gmail\u2019s birth and rise to fame\n\nWhat people thought was an April Fools joke, turned out to become the world\u2019s\nmost used email platform globally. On the 1st of April 2004, Google co-\nfounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin sent out a press release \u2013 and they were\nnot kidding. While Gmail at first glance appeared to be too good to be true,\nit became in fact the most popular email service.\n\nThe release of Gmail, had people around the world in disbelief \u2013 it was free,\nand offered 1 gigabyte of storage per account. This was something unheard of\nat the time, so how could it be true? In the early 2000s Yahoo and Microsoft\nwere leading the market, and users could store around 30 to 60 emails before\nrunning out of storage (crazy to think, right?). Gmail then came along and\nallowed users to store around 13,500 emails before storage ran out. Gmail\nallowed users 250 to 500 times more mail storage for free. So fair enough, it\ndid sound too good to be true.\n\nBut the generous storage wasn\u2019t everything on offer, Gmail also revolutionized\nemail in terms of features. The new email provider had a search function\nallowing users to conveniently search for past emails, and it automatically\nthreaded email communications on the same topic, allowing users to read emails\nas a single conversation.\n\nThe launch of Google\u2019s Gmail in 2004, changed and shocked the email industry\nforever. It was the perfect next addition to second Google\u2019s search engine.\nFollowing Gmail, Google released Google Maps and Google Docs. Ever since,\nAlphabet\u2019s Google has gone on to build an empire of Google tools that all work\ntogether seamlessly.\n\nFast forward to 20 years later and Gmail has an estimated 1.8 billion active\naccounts making it the most popular email provider globally.\n\n### Don\u2019t Be Evil?\n\nWhile Gmail has reached this major milestone, one must mention that Google\nhasn\u2019t always operated ethically or in the best interests of user privacy.\nWhen Google started out with its services, its corporate conduct included the\nphrase \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d. When Google restructured to Alphabet in 2015, this\nclaim was taken out of the company\u2019s conduct and replaced with \u201cDo the right\nthing\u201d.\n\nThis demonstrates everything that is problematic with Google. While there have\nbeen many achievements and impressive products, at the same time Google has\nbecome a master manipulator at creating a privacy illusion while its business\nmodel is based on selling user data.\n\nWhile you may love Gmail and the other Google tools \u2013 the unfortunate truth is\nthat they love using you even more! Their love for your data is greater than\never.\n\nBy using their free products, you have in fact become the product.\n\n### Time for another revolution\n\nFortunately, today it is possible to stop all this data mining and tracking.\nEnter Tuta Mail, the email provider that is here to lead another revolution,\none where privacy and security are indisputable. It\u2019s time not just for\nanother revolution, but for a better web \u2013 because you deserve it!\n\nTuta(nota) was launched with a small but mighty and motivated team of four in\n2014, and has now reached a major milestone \u2013 Tuta recently turned 10!. Along\nwith reaching this impressive milestone, Tuta now has an expanding team of\naround 30 employees, and our services - Tuta Mail, Tuta Contacts and Tuta\nCalendar - are being used by 10 million people around the world.\n\nAt Tuta we are setting the gold standard, and represent what email should be \u2013\na way to communicate privately and securely.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re tired of Gmail and its unethical practices now is the perfect\ntime to ditch your Gmail account and sign up for a FREE Tuta Mail account.\n\nTuta is every thing Gmail forgot about \u2013 Privacy: Gmail does very little in\nterms of protecting the privacy of its users. Tuta Mail on the other hand,\ncomes with no ads, no tracking, it\u2019s end-to-end encrypted, and offers its\nusers maximum privacy.\n\nIn 2014, Tutanota revolutionized the level of security for email with the\nrelease of the first encrypted email client in the world. And we haven\u2019t\nstopped there. Our mission at Tutanota (now Tuta) is to create the most secure\nemail and calendar service to make sure that your data stays safe and private.\nSo as Tutanota has become Tuta, we are excited that upon our tenth birthday we\nhave launched the first post-quantum encryption protocol for email. We are\ninnovation leaders in secure communication and we are revolutionizing the\nsecurity and privacy of your emails!\n\nAs we\u2019ve released products, grown our team of freedom fighters, and shaken the\nemail world \u2013 we have stayed true to our ethics. We don\u2019t need to write \u201cDon\u2019t\nBe Evil\u201d into our code of conduct because it\u2019s in our DNA. Everyone of our\nteam feels very passionate about people\u2019s human right to privacy and works\nhard to create a better web; one where privacy is the default. Now it\u2019s ten\nyears since the launch of Tutanota, and we still don\u2019t put profits first\nbecause Tuta users and their right to privacy will forever be our priority.\n\nOver a ten year period Tuta has achieved a lot and has had many successes!\nWith the impressive launch of post-quantum encryption to mark 10 years, we\nhave a lot more in development and can\u2019t wait to see how we have\nrevolutionized email when we reach 20 years.\n\n### Features paid for with privacy\n\nWhile Tuta Mail can not match \u2013 and may never match \u2013 Gmail in terms of\nfeatures or free storage space, we have something much more valuable to offer:\nyour right to privacy.\n\nWe can easily admit that Google\u2019s empire of feature-rich apps, productivity\ntools, and services which all work so seamlessly together, make life much\neasier. And what makes it all seem so much nicer and appealing is that Google\nlets you use all these apps for free. So sure, why wouldn\u2019t you use their\nproducts? For many Gmail is their beloved go-to email provider, and they\u2019ve\nhad it for years, so why change now? But unfortunately, as Gmail gets older,\nGoogle continues to grow and their hunger to profit off their ad-based\nbusiness model continues to succeed \u2013 their success is greatly due to\nsurveillance of you \u2013 the product.\n\nGoogle, just the same as Meta and Microsoft are masters at deceiving the user.\nThey grow and rake in billions of revenue through abusing user data. This is\nthen backed by their cover up marketing campaigns and the release of \u2018privacy\u2019\nfocused features. A prime example, currently being played out in court is\nGoogle\u2019s Incognito Mode: This privacy-focused feature to browse the web\nprivately has been found to not be private at all and it has deceived millions\nof people around the world for years.\n\n#### No one is excluded\n\nThe scary thing is that when it comes to using big tech services like Gmail or\nGoogle Docs, or Facebook and Instagram, no one is protected \u2013 they do not care\nabout the age of the user. This raises major concern as children and teenager\nprivacy stands risk of being violated. A major move in the right direction was\nDenmark, Germany and the Dutch\u2019s decision to ban the use of Google services\nlike email and cloud within schools due to it being incompliant with the EU\u2019s\nGDPR data privacy regulations. While the EU has strict data protection laws,\nand actively protects its citizens, this unfortunately isn\u2019t a reality for\npeople in other parts of the world like the USA, India and China.\n\n### If it\u2019s free, you are the product\n\nEvery time you search something on Google, watch your favorite blogger on\nYouTube, or search for cafes in your area \u2013 all of this data is collected and\nsold to advertisers, and in return you are ad-targeted with unbearable amounts\nof annoying, and often invasive ads, even in your Gmail account. Alphabet\u2019s\nGoogle can afford to keep their products free because your data is worth\nbillions to them and it can harvest them easily via their search engine\ndominance. This is the current sad reality of the internet - big tech puts\nprofits first and disregards any need for users\u2019 data protection. Luckily, we\nlive in a day and age where people are becoming more aware of these wrong\ndoings and choose encrypted products like Tuta Mail and Tuta Calendar.\n\nAs they say, if it\u2019s free you are the product\n\nWhile this may sound odd coming from Tuta - a privacy focused email provider\nthat offers free email accounts, we can assure you that while we offer a free\noption along with paid subscription accounts, our Tuta Mail users are\ncertainly not our product.\n\nAt Tuta, we believe that privacy is a human right and should be a default when\nit comes to the internet and email which is why we don\u2019t and will never stop\noffering free privacy-focused products. We are able to offer these limited\nversions for free as a huge community of privacy enthusiasts chooses to\nsupport a better web by upgrading to our paid plans \u2013 which in turn also have\nmuch more to offer than the free version like more storage space, custom\ndomain support, unlimited email address for custom domains, and more.\n\nAs the quote goes, \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world\u201d this is\nexactly what we at Tuta are doing.\n\nBased in Germany, Tuta is fully open-source and GDPR compliant. But above\nthis, it has set a standard higher than what is required by the EU. With Tuta,\nthe user\u2019s privacy comes first, and unlike Gmail our users are not the\nproduct. That\u2019s why the whole mailbox is end-to-end encrypted by default. With\na dedicated team of experts thinking ahead, Tuta Mail has already launched a\nquantum-safe encryption protocol for email.\n\nJoin Tuta as we continue to fight to be the change we wish to see in the world\n\u2013 one that protects you and your right to privacy.
