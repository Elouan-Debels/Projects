Using the prisoner's dilemma from game theory, the\nJapanese team created a framework for evolving AI agents that mimics human\nbehavior by switching between selfish and cooperative actions, adapting its\nstrategies through evolutionary processes. Their findings were published in\nScientific Reports.\n\nLLM-driven Dialogue AI forms the basis for technologies such as ChatGPT. These\ntechnologies enable computers to interact with people in a manner that\nresembles person-to-person communication. The goal of the Nagoya University\nteam was to examine how LLMs could be used to evolve prompts that encourage\nmore diverse personality traits during social interactions.\n\nThe personalities of AIs were evolved to obtain virtual earnings by playing\nthe prisoner's dilemma game from game theory. The dilemma consists of each\nplayer choosing whether to cooperate with or defect from their partner. If\nboth AI systems cooperate, they each receive four virtual dollars. However, if\none defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets five dollars, while\nthe cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, they receive one dollar each.\n\n\u201cIn this study, we set out to investigate how AI agents endowed with diverse\npersonality traits interact and evolve,\u201d Arita explained. \u201cBy utilizing the\nremarkable capabilities of LLMs, we developed a framework where AI agents\nevolve based on natural language descriptions of personality traits encoded in\ntheir genes. Through this framework, we observed various types of personality\ntraits, with the evolution of AIs capable of switching between selfish and\ncooperative behaviors, mirroring human behavior.\u201d\n\nIn usual studies in evolutionary game theory, 'genes' in the models directly\ndetermine an agent\u2019s behavior. Using the LLMs, Arita and Suzuki explored genes\nthat represented more complex descriptions than previous models, such as\n\u201cbeing open to team efforts while prioritizing self-interest, leading to a\ncombination of cooperation and defection.\u201d This description was then\ntranslated into a behavioral strategy by asking the LLM whether it would\ncooperate or defect when it has such a personality trait.\n\nThe research used an evolutionary framework, in which AI agents' abilities\nwere shaped by natural selection and mutation over generations. This caused a\nwide range of personality traits to appear.\n\nAlthough some agents displayed selfish characteristics, putting their own\ninterests above those of the community or the group as a whole, other agents\ndemonstrated advanced strategies that revolved around seeking personal gain\nwhile still considering mutual and collective benefit.\n\n\u201cOur experiments provide fascinating insights into the evolutionary dynamics\nof personality traits in AI agents. We observed the emergence of both\ncooperative and selfish personality traits within AI populations, reminiscent\nof human societal dynamics,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cHowever, we also uncovered the\ninstability inherent in AI societies, with excessively cooperative groups\nbeing replaced by more \u2018egocentric\u2019 agents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis achievement underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in AI\nresearch, showing that the evolution of personality traits based on subtle\nlinguistic expressions can be represented by a computational model using\nLLMs,\u201d remarked Suzuki. \u201cOur findings provide insights into the\ncharacteristics that AI agents should possess to contribute to human society,\nas well as design guidelines for AI societies and societies with mixed AI and\nhuman populations, which are expected to arrive in the not-too-distant\nfuture.\u201d\n\nThe study, \u201cAn evolutionary model of personality traits related to cooperative\nbehavior using a large language model,\u201d was published in Scientifice Reports\non March 19, 2024, at DOI: 10.1038/s41598-024-55903-y.\n\nAuthors:\n\nReiji Suzuki, Takaya Arita\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nMatthew Coslett\n\nInternational Communications Office, Nagoya University\n\nEmail: icomm_research@t.mail.nagoya-u.ac.jp\n\nTop image: Large-scale language models enable AI agents to evolve various\ntypes of personalities in social interactions.
