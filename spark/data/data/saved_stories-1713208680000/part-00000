If one factor is 0, nothing else matters.\n\n5\u00d72\u00d7229\u00d70.2=458.05\u00d72\u00d7229\u00d70.0=0.0\n\nThis xz/liblzma incident and the public post-morten discussion is a great\nillustration of why incident post-mortens shouldn\u2019t be carried as a search for\na root cause, but as a comprehensive enumeration of all contributing factors.\n\nYou can model successful attacks as the observed occurrence of an event with\nnon-zero probability \u2014 a possible incident that occurred.^1 In that model, the\nprobability of an incident occurring is the product of all the contributing\nfactors\u2019 probabilities.\n\nThe nature of multiplication allows anyone to pick one factor and proclaim:\n\n> If the probability of this factor were 0, none of this would have happened,\n> this must be the root cause.\n\nThe contributing factor you elect as the root cause says more about you, than\nit says about the shape of the effective solution or mitigating measures.\n\nAn open-source contributor will say the root cause is contributor burnout. An\nengineer that never worked on open-source will claim that open-source itself\nis the problem. A VP at a big corporation will say the problem is hobbyists\nnot taking software maintenance seriously enough. A security researcher will\nblame the insufficient threat models that software distribution systems\nassume.\n\nGetting the chances of that root cause happening down to zero would fully\nprevent the incident from ever happening again, except that it might be\nimpossible to get it down to zero, and reducing all the contributing factors\nas much as possible can have a bigger impact on the final product than an\nimperfect attempt at reducing the chances of a single contributing factor.\nBecause a root cause really is just an arbitrarily chosen contributing factor.\n^2\n\n  1.
