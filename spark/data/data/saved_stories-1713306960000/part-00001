They also call for stricter domestic laws to ban smoking in all indoor\nspaces in line with international standards.\n\nCurrently, restaurants and bars in Japan are allowed to have smoking areas\nunder certain conditions, which could cause patrons to inhale tobacco smoke\ninvoluntarily.\n\nIn the study, published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology in February,\nresearchers analyzed the DNA sequences of 291 female nonsmokers, of whom 213\nhad been exposed to secondhand smoke, and 122 female smokers. They all\nunderwent surgery for lung adenocarcinoma at the National Cancer Center\nHospital in Tokyo between 2011 and 2017.\n\nLung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of nonsmall cell lung cancer that\naffects cells secreting substances such as mucus.\n\nThe team found that gene mutations associated with lung cancer were different\namong smokers and nonsmokers participating in the study.\n\nNonsmokers who had been exposed to tobacco smoke saw an increase in the\nexpression of the APOBEC3B gene, caused by APOBEC proteins. Such an increase\nwas not seen among smokers.\n\nSpecifically, in the genes that had mutated in nonsmokers who had been exposed\nto secondhand smoke, 15.6% of the mutations involved the accumulation of\nAPOBEC proteins in the tumor cells, as opposed to 7.32% in those who had not\nbeen exposed.\n\nThe mutations of this type were unevenly distributed in the tumor cells, the\nresearchers added, noting that this may create ways for cancer cells to\nsurvive in the body under different conditions and boost their survivability\nby making existing drugs less effective.\n\nLung cancer causes about 76,000 deaths in Japan each year, and about 1.8\nmillion deaths worldwide.\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer, an intergovernmental agency\nthat forms part of the World Health Organization, classifies involuntary or\npassive smoking as Group 1, the highest risk level, meaning that a causal\nrelationship between exposure to passive smoke and cancer has been\nestablished.\n\nAn earlier study by the National Cancer Center showed that the risk of people\nexposed to passive smoke developing lung cancer was 1.3 times higher than\nthose who weren\u2019t exposed. For lung adenocarcinoma, the risk for people with a\nhistory of passive smoking is twice the level seen for those without, the\nresearchers said.\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nlung cancer(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/lung-cancer),\ncancer(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/cancer),\nsmoking(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/smoking)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
