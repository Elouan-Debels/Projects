Judge Refuses To Fix It.\n\n## Oopsie doesn't quite cover it.\n\nBy Kathryn Rubino\n\nonApril 16, 2024 at 11:42 AMApril 16, 2024 at 11:06 AM\n\n1Shares\n\nThis sounds more like the plot to a rom-com than actual real life. The kind\nwith a legal plot twist forcing lawyers everywhere scoff and say, \u201cThat\u2019s not\nhow that works.\u201d\n\nAnd yet. Here we are.\n\nSolicitors at the London Vardags firm accidentally got a divorce for their\nclient, known only as Mrs. Williams in coverage. How, exactly, did that happen\nyou might be wondering. Well, it involves an online portal, a tricky drop down\nmenu, and a sprinkle of carelessness. From The Guardian:\n\nSponsored\n\n### Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve\n\nThe rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between\nLawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get...\n\nFrom The Team at Scale LLP\n\n> Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the family division, explained\n> lawyers had intended to apply for a divorce for another client \u201cbut\n> inadvertently opened the electronic case file in \u2018Williams v Williams\u2019 and\n> proceeded to apply for a final order in that case\u201d.\n>\n> He said solicitors at Vardags, who were representing the wife, used the\n> online portal \u201cwithout the instruction or authority of their client\u201d. He\n> said the online system operated with \u201cits now customary speed\u201d and granted\n> the order divorcing the Williamses within 21 minutes.\n\nNow surely you\u2019re guessing that when the error was realized (two days later,\nfor the record) it could be corrected. But the judge rejected that\napplication:\n\n> But McFarlane rejected the application and said: \u201cThere is a strong public\n> policy interest in respecting the certainty and finality that flows from a\n> final divorce order and maintaining the status quo that it has established.\u201d\n>\n> He added that it was necessary to correct the impression that the online\n> divorce portal would \u201cdeliver a final order of divorce where one was not\n> wanted simply by \u2018the click of a wrong button\u2019\u201d.\n>\n> \u201cLike many similar online processes, an operator may only get to the final\n> screen where the final click of the mouse is made after travelling through a\n> series of earlier screens,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a public interest involved, but I\u2019m not sure it cuts the way\nthe judge thinks it does.\n\n### Sponsored\n\nSponsored\n\n### Is The Future Of Law Distributed?

There has to be intention on the part of the person\ndivorcing, because the principle of intention underpins the justice of our\nlegal system.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhen a mistake is brought to a court\u2019s attention, and everyone\naccepts that a mistake has been made, it obviously has to be undone ... That\nmeans that, for now, our law says that you can be divorced by an error made on\nan online system.
