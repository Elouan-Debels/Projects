Slow and steady wins the race as they say.\n\nHere's how things have looked over the last year+\n\n  * January 23 - 2.91%\n  * February 23 - 2.94%\n  * March 23 - 2.85%\n  * April 23 - 2.83%\n  * May 23 - 2.7%\n  * June 23 - 3.07%\n  * July 23 - 3.12%\n  * August 23 - 3.18%\n  * September 23 - 3.02%\n  * October 23 - 2.92%\n  * November 23 - 3.22%\n  * December 23 - 3.82%\n  * January 24 - 3.77%\n  * February 24 - 4.03%\n  * March 24 - 4.05%\n\nTechnically, ChromeOS is also Linux, and while people like to debate that if\nyou do include Linux and ChromeOS together it would actually be 6.32%. A\nnumber that is getting steadily harder for developers of all kinds to ignore.\nIt terms of overall percentage, it's still relatively small but when you think\nabout how many people that actually is, it's a lot.\n\nAnother look since 2009:\n\nFor those thinking it may be due to Steam Deck with SteamOS, it's unlikely, at\nleast not directly. StatCounter gather their info from web traffic across over\n1.5 million sites globally. I doubt all that many browse the web regularly on\nDeck. However, indirectly? Possible, I've seen lots and lots of posts about\npeople enjoying Linux thanks to the Desktop Mode on the Steam Deck. There's\ngoing to be various other bigger factors at play here though, like Linux\nnowadays actually being properly good on the desktop.\n\nSee the stats on StatCounter.\n\nArticle taken from GamingOnLinux.com.\n\nTags: Editorial, Misc\n\n15 Likes\n\nShare\n\nAbout the author - Liam Dawe\n\nI am the owner of GamingOnLinux.

That\nadds pressure for developers like Adobe to release webapps and hopefully make\nthem good substitutes for native programs, but it doesn't mean anything for\nmaking Native Linux programs.\n\nWine still can't run Adobe Creative Cloud, but hey, at least you have a few\nmore options today...\n\n> Quoting: rustigsmedwith win10 support ending for home users late next year\n> combined with win11 high system requirements we could see a continued or\n> slight jump. anyone want to predict Jan 2026? will 6% or higher be possible?\n> It will be interesting and fun to watch.\n\nI'm curious how many people will pay for extended support. For business users,\nit starts at $60 per year, then $120 for the next year, and $240 for the last\nyear. Extended support for home users will likely be cheaper...\n\nBy 2025, I think Wayland will be a good experience for everyone. STF's funding\nfor GNOME runs out at the end of 2024, and hopefully the accessibility stack\nwill be up to snuff. v1 of the Color Management/HDR protocol will hopefully be\nfinalized this year. Wine 10.0 will probably have the Wayland driver exposed\nby default. Noveau + Zink + NVK will have had more time to mature. GIMP 3.0\nwill be out with so many improvements. So it'll probably be a good time to\nswitch!\n\nIn some ways, I'm glad Fedora 40 is forcibly cutting ties with X11 next week\n(although a KDE developer maintains X11 packages for Fedora, they aren't\ninstalled by default) as it will give more users more time to live on Wayland,\nwhich gives user-facing programs like Steam, Discord, and Krita (after CM...)\nmore time to switch to Wayland. I just worry about Linux Mint's Wayland\nproject.\n\n2 Likes, Who?\n\nfinaldest about 11 hours ago\n\n  * Link\n\nView PC info\n\n15 years to get to 3% and 6 months to reach 4%.

On Mac, I suspect\nopen source software is quite hard to run. And on Windows you can do it, but\nyou have to be aware of it and go searching for each individual piece. So on\nboth, there's a tendency to just go with the expensive stuff which these days\nis often crappy subscription services. For people without big budgets, you can\nactually be limited in what you can use your computer for just because you\ndon't want to buy (or bloody rent!) the software and you don't know there's\nanother way. On Linux, if I suddenly find that I need to do Z, I may look on\nthe menus and find that something for Z is already installed, but if not I go\nto the distro's software centre thingie and type in a search term and download\nand now I can do Z.\n\nSo although it's technically true that the Windows software ecosystem is still\nbigger and for some use-cases better, functionally for a lot of people it's\nprobably the other way around. That wasn't true back in the 2000s.\n\nLast edited by Purple Library Guy on 9 April 2024 at 6:23 pm UTC\n\n2 Likes, Who?\n\nHighball about 9 hours ago\n\n  * Link\n\nView PC info\n\n> Quoting: liamdI doubt all that many browse the web regularly on Deck.\n> However, indirectly?

The overlap is probably quite small.\n\nI really think all of the growth with Linux will come from the spill over.\nTech dad installs Linux, sees it works just fine. Kids computers don't support\nWin11 and require hardware upgrade. Doesn't want to replace perfectly working\nhardware for Win11 support. Installs Linux on kidos computers. For every 1\ntech dad, you get an average of 2-3 bonus Linux installs. Normally tech dad\nwould have had to stick with Windows on the kids computers so they can play\ngames or they needed Windows for school. But that's been flipped on its head.\n\nThe question I have, how long will the spill over last. Once the machines have\nto be replaced, then what happens?\n\n0 Likes\n\nelmapul about 9 hours ago\n\n  * Link\n\nView PC info\n\n> Quoting: pleasereadthemanualO\n\n> Quoting: pleasereadthemanual.
