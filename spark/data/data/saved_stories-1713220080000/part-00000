The idea\nmight seem preposterous - pitting a 40-year-old home computer against a device\npowered by 127-Qubit \u2018Eagle\u2019 quantum processing unit (QPU). However, the\nanonymous researcher(s) conclude that the \u2018Qommodore 64\u2019 performed faster, and\nmore efficiently, than IBM\u2019s pride-and-joy, while being \u201cdecently accurate on\nthis problem.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the paper, the researchers admit that their \u2018Qommodore 64\u2019\nproject is \u201ca joke,\u201d but, sadly for IBM, its proof of quantum utility was also\nbuilt upon shaky foundations, and the Qommodore 64 team came up with some\nconvincing-looking benchmarks. There was some controversy about IBM\u2019s claims\nat the time, and we are reminded it took just five days for the quantum\nexperiment to be simulated on an ordinary MacBook M1 Pro laptop. The jokey\nQuantum Disadvantage paper (PDF link, headlining section starts at page 199)\nports this experiment to a machine packing the far more humble MOS Technology\n6510 processor.\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\n(Image credit: SIGBOVIK 2024)\n\n(Image credit: SIGBOVIK 2024)\n\n(Image credit: SIGBOVIK 2024)\n\nTo get deep into the weeds with the quantum theory and math behind the quantum\nutility experiment, please follow the above PDF link. However, to summarize,\nthe C64-based experiment uses the sparse Pauli dynamics technique developed by\nBegu\u015di\u0107, Hejazi, and Chan to approximate the behavior of ferromagnetic\nmaterials. Famously, IBM claimed such calculations were \u201ctoo difficult to\nperform on a classical computer to an acceptable accuracy, using the leading\napproximation techniques,\u201d recalls the paper. Not quite, and as already\nmentioned above, an ordinary laptop can obtain similar results.\n\nThe anonymous C64 user(s) provide some interesting details of their quantum-\ndefeating feat. Their aggressively truncated and shallow depth-first search\nmodel used just 15kB of the spacious 64kB available on the iconic Commodore\nmachine. Meanwhile, the final code consisted of about 2,500 lines of 6502\nassembly, stored on a cartridge that fitted in the C64\u2019s expansion port. This\ncode was handled by the mighty 1 MHz 8-bit MOS 6510 CPU. The C64 took approx 4\nminutes per data point. (Testing the same code on a modern laptop achieved\nroughly 800\u03bcs per data point.)\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nIn conclusion, the researcher(s) asserts that the \u2018Qommodore 64\u2019 is \u201cfaster\nthan the quantum device datapoint-for-datapoint... it is much more energy\nefficient... and it is decently accurate on this problem.\u201d On the topic of how\napplicable this research is to other quantum problems, it is snarkily\nsuggested that \u201cit probably won\u2019t work on almost any other problem (but then\nagain, neither do quantum computers right now).\u201d Overall, it is difficult to\nknow whether the results are entirely genuine, though a lot of detail is\nprovided and the linked research references in the paper seem genuine.\n\nWe know many readers are retro computing enthusiasts, as well as DIYers and\nmakers. So it is good to know that the author(s) of this paper say that they\nwill provide source code to allow others to replicate their results. However,\nsource code will only be supplied in one of three formats, they say: \u201ca copy\nhandwritten on papyrus, a slide-show of blurry screenshots recorded on a VHS\ntape, or that I dictate it to you personally over the phone.\u201d So please add an\nextra pinch of salt to this story for that.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

I learned that one of the death knells for the Amiga was that they\nrefused to adopt MS office. They wanted to develop their own.\n\nAnyway. Fun article.
