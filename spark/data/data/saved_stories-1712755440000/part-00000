'lying flat') is a Chinese slang neologism that\ndescribes a personal rejection of societal pressures to overwork and over-\nachieve, such as in the 996 working hour system, which is often regarded as a\nrat race with ever diminishing returns.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4] Tang ping means\nchoosing to \"lie down flat and get over the beatings\" via a low-desire, more\nindifferent attitude towards life.\n\nNovelist Liao Zenghu described \"lying flat\" as a passive-aggressive resistance\nmovement,^[5] and The New York Times called it part of a nascent Chinese\ncounterculture.^[6] It has also been compared to the Great Resignation, a\nsurge of resignations that began in the West at roughly the same\ntime.^[7]^[8]^[9] The National Language Resources Monitoring and Research\nCenter, an institution affiliated to Education Ministry of China, listed the\nword as one of the 10 most popular memes for 2021 in the Chinese Internet.\nChinese search engine Sogou also listed the word at the top of its list of\nmost trending memes for 2021.^[10]\n\nThose who choose to \"lie flat\" may lower their professional commitment and\neconomic ambitions, simplify their goals, while still being fiscally\nproductive for their own essential needs, and prioritize psychological health\nover economic materialism.^[11]^[12]\n\nThe phrase \"quiet quitting\", meaning doing only what one's job demands and\nnothing more,^[13] which became popular in the United States in 2022, was\nthought to be inspired by the tang ping movement.^[14]^[15] Another newer\nrelated phrase is bai lan (Chinese: \u6446\u70c2; pinyin: b\u01cei l\u00e0n; lit. 'let it rot'),\nwhich means \"to actively embrace a deteriorating situation, rather than trying\nto turn it around\". Basically, it refers to a voluntary retreat from pursuing\ncertain goals because individuals realize they are simply too difficult to\nachieve.^[16]\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\nThe term first appeared around February 2020 (the beginning of the COVID-19\npandemic) on the Chinese Internet.^[17] The movement began in April 2021 with\na post by Luo Huazhong (username \"Kind-Hearted Traveler\") on the internet\nforum Baidu Tieba, in which he discussed his reasons for living a low-key,\nminimalist lifestyle. In 2016, 26-year-old Luo quit his factory job because it\nmade him feel empty. He then cycled 2,100 km (1,300 mi) from Sichuan to Tibet,\nand now back in his home town Jiande in eastern Zhejiang Province, spends his\ntime reading philosophy, and gets by doing a few odd jobs and taking US$60 a\nmonth from his savings.^[18]^[6] He only eats two meals a day.^[18]\n\nLuo's post, entitled with \"Lying Flat is Justice\", illustrates:\n\n> I can just sleep in my barrel enjoying a sunbath like Diogenes, or live in a\n> cave-like Heraclitus and think about 'Logos'. Since there has never really\n> been a trend of thought that exalts human subjectivity in this land, I can\n> create it for myself. Lying flat is my wise movement, only by lying down can\n> humans become the measure of all things.^[1]^[2]\n\nLuo's post and story quickly gained a following on social media, being\ndiscussed and soon becoming a buzzword on Sina Weibo and Douban. The idea was\npraised by many and inspired numerous memes, and has been described as a sort\nof spiritual movement.^[1] Business magazine ABC Money claimed it resonated\nwith a growing silent majority of youth disillusioned by the officially\nendorsed \"Chinese Dream\" that encourages a life of hard work and sacrifice\nwith no actual life satisfaction to show for it, spawning the catchphrase \"a\nchive lying flat is difficult to reap\" (\u8eba\u5e73\u7684\u97ed\u83dc\u4e0d\u597d\u5272, T\u01ceng p\u00edng de ji\u01d4c\u00e0i b\u00f9 h\u01ceo\ng\u0113).^[19]\n\n## Response[edit]\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) moved quickly to reject the idea. The CAC\ninternet regulator ordered online platforms to \"strictly restrict\" posts on\ntang ping and had censors remove Luo's original Tieba post^[20] while a\ndiscussion group of nearly 10,000 followers on Chinese social media site\nDouban is no longer accessible.^[21] Selling tang ping-branded merchandise\nonline is forbidden.^[6]\n\nIn May 2021, Chinese state media Xinhua published an editorial asserting that\n\"lying flat\" is shameful.^[22]^[23] In May, a video clip of CCTV news\ncommentator Bai Yansong criticizing the low-key mindset circulated on the\npopular video-sharing website Bilibili,^[11] and had attracted thousands of\nmockeries and slurs on the danmu commentaries in response.^[24]^[25] The same\nmonth, a commentary of Hubei Radio and Television Economic Channel said, \"you\ncan accept your fate, but you mustn't lie flat.\"^[26] An October article by\nCCP general secretary Xi Jinping, published in the Communist Party journal\nQiushi, called for \"avoiding 'involution' [nei juan] and 'lying\nflat'\".^[8]^[27]\n\nHowever, there were official voices offering more empathic opinions on the\ntang ping phenomenon. Beijing's party-affiliated Guangming Daily newspaper\nadded that tang ping should not be discounted without reflection\u2014if China\nwants to cultivate diligence in the young generation, it should first try to\nimprove their quality of life.^[11] Huang Ping, a literature professor who\nresearches youth culture at East China Normal University, told Sixth Tone that\nofficial media outlets may be concerned about the tang ping lifestyle because\nof its potential to threaten productivity, but \"humans aren't merely tools for\nmaking things... when you can't catch up with society's development\u2014say,\nskyrocketing home prices\u2014tang ping is actually the most rational choice.\"^[11]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Buddha-like mindset\n  * Hikikomori \u2013 the Japanese term for acute social withdrawal\n  * Sampo generation\n  * Slacker\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c \"China's new 'tang ping' trend aims to highlight pressures of work culture\".
