With the Sun\u2019s main light\nmasked, the much dimmer solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye. This\nprovides scientists a unique opportunity to study this mysterious region of\nthe Sun. The brief blocking of sunlight also allows scientists to study how\nthe Sun\u2019s light affects Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nIn the past, solar eclipses have driven numerous scientific discoveries. For\nthis solar eclipse, NASA is funding several scientific experiments \u2013 including\nthe three using the WB-57s \u2013 to make measurements during the eclipse. NASA\u2019s\nWB-57s fly much higher than commercial aircraft. This altitude allows the jets\nto fly above clouds \u2013 meaning no chance of missing the eclipse due to bad\nweather. Additionally, the height puts the jets above most of Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, which allows for the cameras to take crisper images and capture\nwavelengths, such as infrared light, that don\u2019t make it to the ground. Since\nthe planes can travel at 460 miles per hour, they\u2019re also able to extend the\ntime they spend in the Moon\u2019s shadow. While the eclipse will last no more than\nfour and a half minutes at any point on the ground, the planes will see an\neclipse that lasts about 25 percent longer, over 6 minutes and 22 seconds.\n\nThis map shows the path of the 2024 total solar eclipse. The dark path across\nthe continent is the path of totality. By flying along this path, the WB-57s\nwill extend the amount of time they spend in totality.\n\nNASA/Scientific Visualization Studio/Michala Garrison; Eclipse Calculations By\nErnie Wright, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n\u201cBy extending the duration of totality, we\u2019re increasing the duration of how\nmuch data we can acquire,\u201d said Shadia Habbal, a researcher at the University\nof Hawaii who leads of one of the WB-57 eclipse experiments.\n\nHabbal\u2019s experiment will fly spectrometers \u2013 which record specific wavelengths\nof light and cameras. The instruments will measure the temperature and\nchemical composition of the corona and coronal mass ejections, which are large\nbursts of solar material. With this data, scientists aim to better understand\nthe structure of the corona and identify the source of the solar wind, the\nconstant stream of particles emitted by the Sun.\n\nHabbal hopes the results of their study will help differentiate between\ndifferent competing models of how the corona is heated. \u201cThis light is our\nbest probe short of sticking a thermometer in the corona,\u201d Habbal said.\n\nNASA/ESA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) captured this video of a\ncoronal mass ejection on March 13, 2023.\n\nNASA/ESA/SOHO\n\nFor another team, led by Amir Caspi at the Southwest Research Institute in\nBoulder, Colorado, it\u2019s not their first time chasing eclipses by plane. Caspi\nled a previous trailblazing experiment with the WB-57s during the 2017 total\nsolar eclipse that crossed America from sea to sea. Images taken from the jet\nwere used to study the structure of the corona.\n\nThat time was the first the jets had ever been used to study an eclipse. This\ntime, an improved camera setup will allow measurements in more wavelengths\nfrom infrared to visible light that will hopefully reveal new information\nabout structures in the middle and lower corona. The observations, taken with\na high-resolution, high-speed camera, could also help study a dust ring that\ncircles the Sun and help search for asteroids that may orbit near the Sun.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of data of the Sun at some of the wavelengths we\u2019ll be\nstudying,\u201d Caspi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll find, so it\u2019s extra exciting\nto be making these measurements.\u201d\n\nA third experiment will study the effects of the Moon\u2019s shadow on the\nionosphere using an instrument called an ionosonde, which was designed at JHU\nAPL. An ionosonde functions like a simple radar. The device sends out high-\nfrequency radio signals and listens for their echoes rebounding off the\nionosphere, which allows the researchers to measure how charged the ionosphere\nis.\n\n\u201cThe eclipse basically serves as a controlled experiment,\u201d said Bharat\nKunduri, leader of the ionosphere project and a research assistant professor\nat Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. \u201cIt gives us an opportunity to\nunderstand how changes in solar radiation can impact the ionosphere, which can\nin turn impact some of these technologies like radar and GPS that we rely on\nin our daily lives.\u201d\n\nBy Mara Johnson-Groh NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\n## Share\n\n## Details\n\nLast Updated\n\nApr 03, 2024\n\nEditor\n\nAbbey Interrante\n\n## Related Terms\n\n  * 2024 Solar Eclipse\n  * Eclipses\n  * Heliophysics\n  * Heliophysics Division\n  * Ionosphere\n  * Skywatching\n  * Solar Eclipses\n  * Space Weather\n  * The Sun\n  * The Sun & Solar Physics\n  * WB-57\n\n## Explore More\n\n3 min read\n\n### Making Ultra-fast Electron Measurements in Multiple Directions to Reveal\nthe Secrets of the Aurora\n\nThe energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern lights)\nhave a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not fully\nunderstand.
