This article is\nthe second in the Sequence Models series. The next article discusses RNNs in\ngreater detail.\n\nBasically, there are a couple of main problems that come up when using\nStandard Neural Networks for language tasks:\n\n## Problems in Standard Networks\n\n  1. Inputs and outputs can have different lengths in different examples\n\nWe can take the maximum length sentence and pad every other sentence in the\ndocument with zeros up to that length, but that still doesn\u2019t seem like a good\nrepresentation.\n\nA neural network representation showing different length inputs and outputs.\n\u00a9Ashutosh Pathak 2024\n\n2\\. A naive Neural Network architecture (like the one above) does not share\nfeatures learned learned across different positions of text\n\nFor example, if a neural network has learned that the word \u201cHarry\u201d appearing\nat position 1 in the text gives a sign that it is part of a person\u2019s name,\nthen wouldn\u2019t it be nice if it could automatically figure out that the same\nword Harry appearing at another position x^<t> also might be a person\u2019s name?\n\n> This is similar to what we see in Convolutional Neural Networks, where we\n> want things learned in one part of the image to generalize quickly to other\n> parts of the image.\n\n3\\. Large number of parameters\n\nAssuming the vocabulary of 1000 words, each x^<t> will be a 1000 dimensional\none-hot encoded vector, and there are as much x^<t>\u2018s as there are maximum\nnumber of words in sentence.\n\n## Motivations\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were developed to address specific challenges\nposed by sequence data where the context and order of data points (e.g., words\nin a sentence) are crucial for understanding. Standard neural networks lack\nthe architecture to effectively handle sequential data and dependencies over\ntime or sequence.\n\n### Memory and context handing\n\nStandard neural networks process inputs independently, without the ability to\nremember previous inputs. This characteristic makes them unsuitable for tasks\nwhere the context or the sequence of data points matters.\n\n### Variable-length sequence processing\n\nLanguage tasks often involve dealing with variable-length sequences of data,\nsuch as sentences or paragraphs of different lengths. Standard neural networks\nrequire input data of a fixed size and cannot natively handle sequences of\nvarying lengths.\n\n### Temporal Dynamics\n\nLanguage understanding often depends on the temporal dynamics of elements in a\nsequence. For instance, the meaning of a word in a sentence can be influenced\nby the words that precede or follow it.\n\n### Parameter Sharing Across Different Parts of a Sequence\n\nIn standard neural networks, each input feature is processed by separate\nparameter. This is not efficient for tasks where the same type of processing\nneeds to be applied to every element of a sequence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStandard neural networks fall short in addressing language tasks due to their\ninherent limitations in processing sequential data and capturing context.\nUnlike RNNs and their advanced variants, standard models lack the memory\nfunction necessary to retain information across different points in a\nsequence. This makes them unable to understand context or the temporal\ndynamics intrinsic to language. Also, their fixed input size restricts their\nability to handle the variable-length sequences commonly found in natural\nlanguage. The limitations of standard neural networks highlight the complexity\nof language processing and the importance of continuous innovation in AI to\ndevelop models that can accurately interpret and generate human language. We\nwill see how to overcome some of these limitations using RNNs in the next\narticle.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Discover more from The Number Crunch\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts to your email.\n\nartificial intelligence machine learning nlp\n\n## Comments\n\n### Let me know what you thinkCancel reply\n\nThe Number Crunch\n\nRead.
