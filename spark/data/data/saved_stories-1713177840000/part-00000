Pool / Staff Photographer)\n\nBy Bloomberg Wire\n\n7:00 AM on Apr 14, 2024 CDT\n\nThe green energy transition has been stymied by a lack of long-haul\ntransmission lines to carry clean power from remote wind and solar farms to\ncities and power-hungry data centers where it\u2019s needed.\n\nThe most discussed option is building more transmission projects. But startup\nTS Conductor Corp. says the key to addressing the shortfall isn\u2019t just adding\nlines to the grid; it\u2019s installing better ones that can deliver more\nelectricity and potentially lower costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Huntington Beach, Calif.-based company has developed a power cable that\nweighs less and can carry more electricity than the standard wires that have\nbeen used for more than a century. While lining up permits and approvals to\nbuild new transmission projects can take years, TS Conductor contends that\nutilities can boost capacity now by replacing existing towers\u2019 wires with its\nproduct. Tests are already underway, including by the Tennessee Valley\nAuthority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nERCOT warns rising temperatures may cause power emergency next week\n\nBusiness Briefing\n\nBecome a business insider with the latest news.\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used the same conductor for the past 100 years,\u201d said Chief Executive\nOfficer Jason Huang. \u201cThis is a different kind of wire.\u201d\n\nNext-generation power lines remain a fairly niche product, but they could\nprove vital in the coming years. The world has a tall task to create grids\nthat align with net-zero emissions goals. Adapting and expanding grids to meet\nnet-zero needs by 2050 amounts to at least $21.4 trillion, according to BNEF.\nThat includes installing nearly 50 million miles of wires to transmit and\ndistribute clean energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe industry standard for long-distance conductor \u2014 the technical name for\nthis type of transmission wiring \u2014 wraps strands of aluminum that carry power\naround a steel core to provide strength and support. While the technology is\ntried and true, surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence,\nelectric vehicles and other sources will require a grid overhaul.\n\nTS Conductor\u2019s solution is to replace the steel with a carbon fiber core,\nwhich is stronger and about 80% lighter. The change means the core can be\nthinner and the product can pack more strands of aluminum in the same size\nconductor. Huang says his product can carry as much as three times more\nelectricity than today\u2019s wires.\n\nTexas\u2019 power reserve created an $8B illusion of energy shortage this summer,\nmonitor says\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this type of advanced conductor can be two to three times the cost of\nconventional wiring on a per-foot basis, the lighter weight means utilities\nneed fewer and shorter towers when installing miles and miles of it. For\nexample, one customer that TS Conductor declined to name used the company\u2019s\nproduct for an 11-mile connection to a wind farm. Using a conventional\nconductor would have required 78 towers, but this job only needed 59 of them,\nHuang said. Fewer towers translate to less steel and concrete and lower labor\ncosts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe total project is cheaper,\u201d Huang said.\n\nAdvanced conductor designs are still new to the industry, and remain expensive\nand not widely used. However, they offer numerous advantages, and will likely\nbecome more common in the near future, according to Eric Holdsworth, managing\ndirector of clean energy and environmental policy for the Edison Electric\nInstitute, a utility industry trade group.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt we need to build more transmission,\u201d said Holdsworth. \u201cBut\nif we can get more out of today\u2019s grid, that\u2019s less we need to build.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlan to link Texas ERCOT electric grid to southeastern U.S. states is in the\nworks\n\nThe West and South regions of the U.S. are where the transition is likely to\nhappen first. Wildfires and hurricanes are becoming more severe threats, and\nutilities are already trying to make their grids more resilient. Advanced\nconductor can be stronger than current cables, making it attractive to\nutilities seeking to make their systems more resistant to natural disasters.\n\nEarly results from the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s tests of TS Conductor\u2019s\ntechnology are promising. The utility strung the conductor between two towers\nat a retired coal power plant in Alabama last year to see how it performed.\n\nTVA is conducting additional lab tests, and if the results are good, it\u2019s\nlooking at five projects where it could replace about 76 miles of existing\nconductor. (That\u2019s a sliver of TVA\u2019s grid, which spans roughly 16,000 miles.)\nWorkers also said it was comparable to installing traditional wiring, which\ncould make the transition to using it easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of TVA\u2019s wiring is 75 years old, said Scott Fiedler, a spokesman for the\nauthority, which is owned by the U.S. government and serves 10 million people.\nThat means a lot of old conductor out there is ready for replacement. And it\u2019s\nnot just the TVA system that\u2019s ripe for new long-term transmission cables.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s probably needed around the nation,\u201d he said.\n\n\\- Will Wade for Bloomberg\n\nRelated Stories\n\nRead More\n\nOil magnate Herbert Hunt \u2014 famous Texas wildcatter and developer \u2014 dies at 95\n\nOil wildcatter W.
