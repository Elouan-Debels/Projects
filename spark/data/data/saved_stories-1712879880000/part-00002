I would\nagree that the general state of cache implementation leaves much to be\ndesired, both in clients and in proxies. However, I would not write off the\ntechnology wholesale.\n\nFor example, Norm claims that you can\u2019t populate a cache. Untrue; it\u2019s simple\nto populate any cache, simply by driving a workload through it. If that\u2019s too\nsimplistic, I know of at least one commercial proxy cache which allows you to\npush content into it in a efficient and secure manner, using nothing but HTTP\n(I know this because I forced them to do it, when I had the weight of a\nFortune 25 company behind me; handy thing, that ;)\n\nA stickier problem is \u201cpinning\u201d representations in the cache, so that they\ndon\u2019t get evicted by others. This is less common (most vendors will tell you\nto just buy more disk, which I don\u2019t consider acceptable in some situations),\nbut I know of one implementation that does allow this.\n\nNorm would also like the ability to override the resource\u2019s choice of\nrepresentation in a private or local scope. I think this is really just a\nfacet of his first problem; find the cache at the appropriate scope (e.g., on\nthe local machine, in the local network, etc.) and push a representation into\nit, with the appropriate metadata.\n\nBTW, many caches allow you to modify their content through the local\nfilesystem, if you know the proper incantations (and there are tools to help).\nHow RESTful.\n\nFinally, Norm would like a way to map arbitrarily specified URIs to other\nURIs, based on a ruleset. There\u2019s actually been a lot of work in this area; a\nfew IETF efforts around this space include the Contextualisation of\nLocalisation BoF (what a mouthful), OPES and CDI; my own work in this area led\nme to produce URISpace. This, by the way, isn\u2019t really a function of caching,\nbut rather one of an intermediary (where caching often happens).\n\nI\u2019m not convinced that there\u2019s need for a specialized peice of software called\nand \u201cXML Catalog,\u201d because all of the functions that Norm describes are\ngeneric and desireables for all kinds of content, not just XML.\n\nI would not debate that the functionality of current implementations is\nseriously impaired, however. The caching community has focused entirely on\nperformance, to the detriment of the functionality and granularity of\ncapability in their products. I think there are some really interesting\nopportunities in this space, and would very much like to hear people\u2019s\nthoughts.\n\nAlas, I\u2019m no longer paid to think about all things caching and intermediary,\nso my time for doing so is limited. That said, it looks like what I am paid\nfor - Web services - is veering in the direction where intermediaries are in\nthe spotlight, so I suspect interesting times may be ahead.\n\nabout blog home\n\n", "frontpage": true}
