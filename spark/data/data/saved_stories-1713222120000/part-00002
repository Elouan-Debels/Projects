That being said, it\u2019s\nthe iconic Nintendo mascot that is the topic of today\u2019s discussion.\n\nCheck out the Super Mario 3D All-Stars trailer below!\n\nLoading...\n\nAdvert\n\n10\n\nReleased in 1996, Super Mario 64 helped to break the mould of what fans\nexpected to see from everyone\u2019s favourite stereotypical Italian plumber. No\nlonger was the Super Mario Bros. series exclusively a 2D platformer, it was\nnow fully 3D and became one of the most beloved video games of all time.\n\nSuper Mario 64 would later benefit from several re-releases including a port\nfor the Nintendo DS in 2004 and most recently, as part of a collection that\nincluded Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy for the Nintendo Switch\nwith Super Mario 3D All-Stars in 2020.\n\nIt doesn't matter which port of Super Mario 64 you played, it would quickly\nbecome apparent as to why this game is considered to be a timeless classic.\nHowever, out of all the ports that we have enjoyed over the years this\ngorgeous remake looks to top the lot.\n\nAdvert\n\n10\n\nCreated by 3D artist BradleyisGone, they are recreating Super Mario 64 from\nthe ground up and judging by early impressions, it\u2019s looking gorgeous so far\nand takes us right back to our childhood. At this stage, this fan-made remake\nis in its early phase, so animations are a little rough around the edges (as\nseen via the YouTube uploads) but the potential is there to see.\n\nOf course, the elephant in the room is the likelihood of Nintendo taking down\nthis project if it picks up steam, hopefully, that won't be the case. With\nthat in mind, likely, this fan-made remake will not be made playable to the\npublic in an attempt to avoid the wrath of the Nintendo lawyers.\n\nI would say we can play Super Mario 64 as part of the Super Mario 3D All-Stars\nbut for some reason Nintendo made that release a timed exclusive. Thankfully,\nthe classic 3D platformer is at least available to Nintendo Switch Online +\nExpansion Pack subscribers.\n\nTopics: Indie Games, Nintendo, Nintendo Switch, Retro Gaming, Super Mario,\nSega\n\nRichard Lee Breslin\n\nMore like this\n\n  * Nintendo Switch adds 3 new free games you can download today\n  * Nintendo highlights 21 Switch games you can download free right now\n  * Super Mario 64, Ocarina Of Time, and more getting 4K remasters\n  * Super Mario 64 Infinite is an all-new free game you can play now\n\nAdvert\n\n10\n\nAdvert\n\n10\n\nAdvert\n\n10\n\n## Chosen for YouChosen for You\n\nThe Elder Scrolls\n\n### The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion just got a huge fan expansion you can download\nfree\n\n5 hours ago\n\nSkyrim\n\n### Skyrim player finds secret ending after 1,000 hours, no mods needed\n\n6 hours ago\n\nHalo\n\n### Halo 7 bringing back series creator, says insider\n\n9 hours ago\n\n## Most Read StoriesMost Read\n\nIndie Games\n\n### Super Mario 64 is getting a gorgeous remake that'll hit you right in the\nchildhood\n\n9 hours ago\n\nNintendo\n\n### Nintendo Switch adds 3 new free games you can download today\n\n3 days ago\n\nGTA 6\n\n### GTA 6 Online boycott started by fans following Rockstar cancellations\n\n9 hours ago\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\n### Red Dead Redemption 2 new ending discovery reminds us Rockstar is on\nanother level\n\n7 hours ago\n\n10\n\nSubmit your content\n\n  * Advertise\n  * Terms\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * LADbible Group\n  * LADbible\n  * SPORTbible\n  * Tyla\n  * UNILAD\n  * License Our Content\n  * About Us & Contact\n  * Jobs\n  * Download our app\n\n", "frontpage": false}
