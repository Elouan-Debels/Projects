Apple started letting\ndevelopers offer their apps through alternative app marketplaces in the EU in\niOS 17.4, but the website option adds a new method for acquiring apps.\n\nApp developers that want to offer iOS apps from their websites in the European\nUnion need to meet specific criteria to ensure the safety of iPhone users.\nApps must undergo Apple's Notarization process, and developers need to be a\nmember of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more.\n\nOnly apps that have had one million annual first installs or more on iOS in\nthe EU in the prior year are eligible for download from a website. Developers\nthat meet these terms will be able to use an API for web-based app downloads.\nApps downloaded through the web using the API can be backed up, restored, and\nupdated as standard apps can.\n\nWhen an iPhone user in the EU visits a website to install an app, users will\nneed to grant express permission for that developer to install apps to\nSettings. A system sheet will display the app name, developer name, app\ndescription, screenshots, and more.\n\nDevelopers are only able to offer apps from their developer account, and are\nrequired to publish transparent data collection policies so users are aware of\nhow data is collected and used. Apps distributed outside of the App Store need\nto provide customer support, refunds, and offer a way to manage apps.\n\nWhile developers do not have to pay a cut of app sales to Apple for apps\ndistributed through websites, there is a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for\neach annual install over one million in the past 12 months. The fee is waived\nfor nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and\ngovernment entities.\n\nDownloading apps outside of the App Store is limited to iPhone users who are\nlocated in the European Union, and Apple has implemented these options to\ncomply with the EU's Digital Markets Act. The functionality is not available\non the iPad, nor is it open to iPhone users in other countries.\n\nRelated Roundups: iOS 17, iPadOS 17\n\nRelated Forums: iOS 17, iPadOS 17\n\n[ 44 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nnitrobear\n\n3 hours ago at 10:02 am\n\nEvery day we're closer to being able to install whatever apps we want and I'm\nreally happy about it.\n\nScore: 16 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nHobeSoundDarryl\n\n3 hours ago at 10:12 am\n\n> Every day we're closer to being able to install whatever apps we want and\n> I'm really happy about it.\n\nBring it on... just as the world has long enjoyed with Mac apps.
