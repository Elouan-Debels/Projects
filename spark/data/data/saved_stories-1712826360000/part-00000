It seems counterintuitive both that there\ncould be a person who is causing the others to drink, or that there could be a\nperson such that all through the night that one person were always the last to\ndrink. The first objection comes from confusing formal \"if then\" statements\nwith causation (see Correlation does not imply causation or Relevance logic\nfor logics that demand relevant relationships between premise and consequent,\nunlike classical logic assumed here). The formal statement of the theorem is\ntimeless, eliminating the second objection because the person the statement\nholds true for at one instant is not necessarily the same person it holds true\nfor at any other instant.^[citation needed]\n\nThe formal statement of the theorem is\n\nwhere D is an arbitrary predicate and P is an arbitrary nonempty set.\n\n## Proofs[edit]\n\nThe proof begins by recognizing it is true that either everyone in the pub is\ndrinking, or at least one person in the pub is not drinking. Consequently,\nthere are two cases to consider:^[1]^[2]\n\n  1. Suppose everyone is drinking. For any particular person, it cannot be wrong to say that if that particular person is drinking, then everyone in the pub is drinking\u2014because everyone is drinking. Because everyone is drinking, then that one person must drink because when that person drinks everybody drinks, everybody includes that person.^[1]^[2]\n  2. Otherwise at least one person is not drinking. For any nondrinking person, the statement if that particular person is drinking, then everyone in the pub is drinking is formally true: its antecedent (\"that particular person is drinking\") is false, therefore the statement is true due to the nature of material implication in formal logic, which states that \"If P, then Q\" is always true if P is false.^[1]^[2] (These kinds of statements are said to be vacuously true.)\n\nA slightly more formal way of expressing the above is to say that, if\neverybody drinks, then anyone can be the witness for the validity of the\ntheorem. And if someone does not drink, then that particular non-drinking\nindividual can be the witness to the theorem's validity.^[3]\n\n## Explanation of paradoxicality[edit]\n\nThe paradox is ultimately based on the principle of formal logic that the\nstatement is true whenever A is false, i.e., any statement follows from a\nfalse statement^[1] (ex falso quodlibet).\n\nWhat is important to the paradox is that the conditional in classical (and\nintuitionistic) logic is the material conditional. It has the property that is\ntrue only if B is true or if A is false (in classical logic, but not\nintuitionistic logic, this is also a sufficient condition).\n\nSo as it was applied here, the statement \"if they are drinking, everyone is\ndrinking\" was taken to be correct in one case, if everyone was drinking, and\nin the other case, if they were not drinking\u2014even though their drinking may\nnot have had anything to do with anyone else's drinking.\n\n## History and variations[edit]\n\nSmullyan in his 1978 book attributes the naming of \"The Drinking Principle\" to\nhis graduate students.^[1] He also discusses variants (obtained by replacing D\nwith other, more dramatic predicates):\n\n  * \"there is a woman on earth such that if she becomes sterile, the whole human race will die out.\" Smullyan writes that this formulation emerged from a conversation he had with philosopher John Bacon.^[1]\n  * A \"dual\" version of the Principle: \"there is at least one person such that if anybody drinks, then he does.\"^[1]\n\nAs \"Smullyan's \u2018Drinkers\u2019 principle\" or just \"Drinkers' principle\" it appears\nin H.P. Barendregt's \"The quest for correctness\" (1996), accompanied by some\nmachine proofs.^[2] Since then it has made regular appearance as an example in\npublications about automated reasoning; it is sometimes used to contrast the\nexpressiveness of proof assistants.^[4]\n\n### Non-empty domain[edit]\n\nIn the setting with empty domains allowed, the drinker paradox must be\nformulated as follows:^[5]\n\nA set P satisfies\n\nif and only if it is non-empty.\n\nOr in words:\n\n    If and only if there is someone in the pub, there is someone in the pub such that, if they are drinking, then everyone in the pub is drinking.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of paradoxes\n  * Reification (linguistics)\n  * Temporal logic\n  * Relevance logic\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h Raymond Smullyan (1978).
