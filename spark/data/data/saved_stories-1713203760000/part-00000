As Head of Product &\nTechnology at edding AG, I am currently hands-on managing the\ninterdisciplinary team at easycheck. But the underlying pattern is not limited\nto direct team management but also extends to managing managers and reporting\nto C-Level colleagues.\n\n## Team Check-in (Async) \u00b6\n\nOur week kicks off with an asynchronous check-in every Monday morning. The\ngoal is for each team member to reflect on their plans for the week and share\nthem with the team. The fundamental question we answer is, \u201cWhat do you plan\non working on this week?\u201d\n\nWhy Asynchronously? Simply put, meetings early in the morning (before 10 AM)\ntend not to be taken seriously. Participants often multitask, sorting through\ntheir emails and planning their day. Studies support this observation,\nhighlighting that such meetings add unnecessary pressure to appear punctual or\nbusy (Brand Eins, 2023).\n\n## 1-on-1s \u00b6\n\nEvery Thursday, I dedicate a block of time to conduct 1-on-1 meetings with all\nteam members. Each member and I have a document to jot down topics worth\ndiscussing throughout the week. Additionally, I maintain a rough coaching plan\nfor each individual, aimed at their development. This time is also used to\ndive deeper into actual work, that I can follow up from our async check-ins.\n\n## Team Checkout (Sync) \u00b6\n\nWe maintain a rolling agenda in Confluence, accessible to all team members for\nadding items throughout the week. However, most topics are generated from my\nobservations during 1-on-1s, indicating a need for team-wide discussion or\nupdates. During the meeting, we review the rolling agenda, discuss our current\nproduct initiatives, and tidy up our boards.\n\nWhy Thursdays? By holding this meeting on Thursday, we still have time to act\non discussions before the week ends. Also, some just prefer to take Fridays\noff.\n\n## Heartbeat \u00b6\n\nOn Fridays, I send a \u201cHeartbeat\u201d update to the board member I report to (in\nthis case, the Chief Digital Officer). This recapitulates the week using a\ntemplate from James Stanier\u2019s book, \u201cEffective Software Engineering Manager\u201d,\nfocusing on Progress / Plans / Problems / People. Inputs for this update are\ngleaned from my 1-on-1 notes and our team checkout discussions, sometimes\naugmented by reviewing my external meeting calendar.\n\n## Closing the Loop \u00b6\n\nThe Heartbeat from the previous week lays the groundwork for the next week\u2019s\ncheck-in, helping me outline goals for the coming week. It\u2019s more effective to\nwait until Monday to prepare the next check-in instead of doing it the week\nbefore. Drafting it on Friday often feels too early; perspectives change over\nthe weekend, and taking a fresh look on Monday offers new insights.\n\nThis cycle highlights how crucial repetition is, not just for efficiency but\nfor consistent reflection and reassessment. Every step offers an opportunity\nto pause and consider our stance, identify priorities, decide on actions, and\nclearly outline what we should avoid doing.\n\n#### Meta\n\n  * Published On: 2024-04-05\n  * Want to leave a public comment?
