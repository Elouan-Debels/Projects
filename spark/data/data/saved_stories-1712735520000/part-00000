Our\n> opinion is that the key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between\n> specifying constraints which models must satisfy and specifying their\n> implementations. Focusing on building a such a bridge, we propose to apply\n> category theory -- precisely, the universal algebra of monads valued in a\n> 2-category of parametric maps -- as a single theory elegantly subsuming both\n> of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position, we show\n> how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning, as\n> well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse\n> landscape of neural networks, such as RNNs. We also illustrate how the\n> theory naturally encodes many standard constructs in computer science and\n> automata theory.\n\nComments:| Work in progress -- comments welcome.
