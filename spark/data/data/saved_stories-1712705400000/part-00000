Software using docker can be\ninstalled using the command line or via graphical interfaces such as\nPortainer. Software is installed with Docker by downloading an image file\ncontaining the application, then creating a copy that sets up its own\ndependencies and configuration within what is called a container. Without\ncontainers you would often need to install different versions of the same\nprogramming languages or tools to satisfy the dependencies for the software\nyou want to use which can get complicated.\n\n## Tools for Self-Hosting\n\nBack to the Top\n\n### Containers\n\nBack to the Top\n\nContainer is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its\ndependencies(including CPU, memory, file storage, and network connections) so\nthe application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to\nanother.\n\n  * Application Container Security Guide | NIST (PDF)\n\nContainer Image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software\nthat includes everything needed to run an application such as the code,\nruntime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.\n\nBest places to get Container Images:\n\n  * DockerHub Container Images\n  * LinuxServer.io Container Images\n  * Quay Container Images\n\nDocker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-\ncontainer applications.

Then Save and Apply.\n\n### Setting up WireGuard on OpenWRT\n\nBack to the Top\n\nQuick Links:\n\n  * WireGuard route all traffic through wireguard tunnel\n  * Automated WireGuard Server and Multi-client\n  * WireGuard basics\n  * WireGuard client\n  * WireGuard extras\n  * WireGuard performance\n  * WireGuard Road-Warrior Configuration\n  * WireGuard\n  * WireGuard server\n  * WireGuard peers\n  * Automated WireGuard site-to-site VPN configuration\n\nIn your router\u2019s webUI, navigate to System - Software, click Update lists:\n\nIn the Filter field, type WireGuard, locate and install the wireguard,\nwireguard-tools, kmod-wireguard, and luci-app-wireguard packages. Note: The\nwireguard package is included in version 22.02.\n\nGenerate WireGuard keypair\n\nSSH into your router as \u2018root\u2019 (OpenWrt Wiki):\n\nssh root@192.168.1.1\n\nGenerate WireGuard keys:\n\nwg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey\n\nchmod 600 privatekey\n\nNote your Private & Public keys, you will need them later:\n\ncat privatekey\n\ncat publickey\n\nCreating an Interface\n\nNavigate to Network - Interface,\n\nClick the Add new interface... button and enter the following configuration:\n\n  * Name - give it any name\n  * Protocol - WireGuard VPN\n\nCreate interface\n\nIn the General Settings tab:\n\n  * Bring up on boot - Checked\n  * Private Key - copy and paste the generated previously Private key\n  * IP Address - enter the WireGuard IP Address obtained in the Client Area ending with /32, e.g. 172.27.124.169/32\n\nAdd a Firewall zone\n\nNavigate to Network - Firewall\n\nClick the Add button and enter the following configuration:\n\n  * Name - Give it any name\n  * Input - Reject\n  * Output - Accept\n  * Forward - Reject\n  * Masquerading - Checked\n  * MSS clamping - Checked\n  * Covered networks - select the previously created VPN tunnel interface\n  * Allow forward to destination zones - Unspecified\n  * Allow forward from source zones - lan\n\nDNS\n\nNavigate to Network - Interfaces\n\nClick on the Edit button next to the WAN interface\n\nIn the Advanced Settings tab, uncheck the Use DNS servers advertised by peer\nand specify one of the following DNS servers in the Use custom DNS servers\nfield:\n\n  * 172.16.0.1 = regular DNS with no blocking\n  * 10.0.254.2 = standard AntiTracker to block advertising and malware domains\n  * 10.0.254.3 = Hardcore Mode AntiTracker to also block Google and Facebook domains\n\nClick the Save button.\n\nLast Steps\n\n  * A device reboot is not required, though it may be useful to confirm that everything behaves as expected.\n  * Run a leak test at https://www.dnsleaktest.com via one of the internal network clients attached to your OpenWRT router.\n\n### Setting up WireGuard on Home Assistant\n\nBack to the Top\n\nInstall Wireguard Add-on in Home Assistant\n\n  * Next, open up Home Assistant. Go to Supervisor > Add-on store, and search for WireGuard.\n\n  * Click the WireGuard addon, and the click Install.\n\nConfigure Wireguard Settings\n\nAfter installing WireGuard, do not start it yet. We need to configure a few\noptions first.\n\n  * Click the Configuration tab at the very top.\n\n  * There are two blocks of code here: server and peers. The server section is the WireGuard server info, and the peers section is where you\u2019d add new devices that will connect to your VPN.\n\nServer Configuration\n\n  * Host: add the subdomain you just created. (vpn.mydomain.com)\n  * Addresses: If your internal network is using the 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x range, you can leave the default IP addresses WireGuard has provided. (see note above)\n  * DNS: Set to your router\u2019s internal IP address (Open CMD > ipconfig /all > Under DNS servers) If you have Adguard or PiHole installed, you can use the IP address of those instead. This will allow you to block ads even when connected to the WireGuard VPN.\n\nPeers Configuration\n\nThis is where you\u2019ll create WireGuard configuration files for each of the\ndevices you want to connect to WireGuard with. For this example, I\u2019m using my\nphone and leaving allowed_ips and client_allowed_ips as is. If you adding\nmultiple devices, then you\u2019ll need to copy the entire block of code starting\nat name, give it a different name, and add the next available IP address (For\nexample: 172.27.66.4)\n\nClick Save once finished.\n\nThen, go back to the Info tab and click Start.\n\nPort Forward\n\nThe next step is to forward port 51820 from your Home Assistant server through\nyour router. Unfortunately, there are so many different types of routers, each\nwith different steps to port forward. The important thing to note is that\nyou\u2019ll be port forwarding 51820(wireguard port) from the internal IP of your\nHome Assistant instance (for example: 192.168.68.24) and choosing the UDP\nprotocol only.\n\nDownload Wireguard app on mobile device\n\nDownload the WireGuard app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. You\nwill need it for the next step.\n\nIf all goes well, you can click into the new tunnel connection from within the\napp. If you see data flowing under the Transfer section, that means you are\ngood to go.\n\nImproving Security\n\nOnce you have everything setup and working correctly, you should read through\nthe WireGuard Addon docs to setup up allowed_ips and client_allowed_ips to\nfurther secure your VPN instance. There\u2019s also some other helpful options you\ncan configure such as log level, but these are all optional.\n\n# Nextcloud\n\nBack to the Top\n\nNextcloud is an industry-leading, on-premises content collaboration platform\nfor file sync & share and communication server.

This generally infers that a connection is built before the data transfer (by following the procedures laid out in a protocol) and then is deconstructed at the at the end of the data transfer. \u2022 Packet: A packet is, generally speaking, the most basic unit that is transferred over a network. When communicating over a network, packets are the envelopes that carry your data (in pieces) from one end point to the other.\n\nPackets have a header portion that contains information about the packet\nincluding the source and destination, timestamps, network hops. The main\nportion of a packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is\nsometimes called the body or the payload.\n\n    \n    \n    \u2022 Network Interface: A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.\n\nA network interface may be associated with a physical device, or it may be a\nrepresentation of a virtual interface. The \"loop-back\" device, which is a\nvirtual interface to the local machine, is an example of this.\n\n    \n    \n    \u2022 LAN: LAN stands for \"local area network\". It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN. \u2022 WAN: WAN stands for \"wide area network\". It means a network that is much more extensive than a LAN. While WAN is the relevant term to use to describe large, dispersed networks in general, it is usually meant to mean the internet, as a whole.\n\nIf an interface is connected to the WAN, it is generally assumed that it is\nreachable through the internet.\n\n    \n    \n    \u2022 Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that basically define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.\n\nSome low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Some familiar examples of\napplication layer protocols, built on these lower protocols, are HTTP (for\naccessing web content), SSH, TLS/SSL, and FTP.\n\n    \n    \n    \u2022 Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application. \u2022 Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server. \u2022 NAT: Network address translation is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address to the necessary backend servers. \u2022 VPN: Virtual private network is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.\n\n## Network Layers\n\n    \n    \n    While networking is often discussed in terms of topology in a horizontal way, between hosts, its implementation is layered in a vertical fashion throughout a computer or network. This means is that there are multiple technologies and protocols that are built on top of each other in order for communication to function more easily. Each successive, higher layer abstracts the raw data a little bit more, and makes it simpler to use for applications and users. It also allows you to leverage lower layers in new ways without having to invest the time and energy to develop the protocols and applications that handle those types of traffic. As data is sent out of one machine, it begins at the top of the stack and filters downwards. At the lowest level, actual transmission to another machine takes place. At this point, the data travels back up through the layers of the other computer. Each layer has the ability to add its own \"wrapper\" around the data that it receives from the adjacent layer, which will help the layers that come after decide what to do with the data when it is passed off. One method of talking about the different layers of network communication is the OSI model. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnect.This model defines seven separate layers. The layers in this model are: \u2022 Application: The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization. \u2022 Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see. \u2022 Session: The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way. \u2022 Transport: The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection. This layer can resend information that has been dropped or corrupted and can acknowledge the receipt of data to remote computers. \u2022 Network: The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end. \u2022 Data Link: This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections. \u2022 Physical: The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).\n\nThe TCP/IP model, more commonly known as the Internet protocol suite, is\nanother layering model that is simpler and has been widely adopted.It defines\nthe four separate layers, some of which overlap with the OSI model:\n\n    \n    \n    \u2022 Application: In this model, the application layer is responsible for creating and transmitting user data between applications. The applications can be on remote systems, and should appear to operate as if locally to the end user.\n\nThe communication takes place between peers network.\n\n    \n    \n    \u2022 Transport: The transport layer is responsible for communication between processes. This level of networking utilizes ports to address different services. It can build up unreliable or reliable connections depending on the type of protocol used. \u2022 Internet: The internet layer is used to transport data from node to node in a network. This layer is aware of the endpoints of the connections, but does not worry about the actual connection needed to get from one place to another. IP addresses are defined in this layer as a way of reaching remote systems in an addressable manner. \u2022 Link: The link layer implements the actual topology of the local network that allows the internet layer to present an addressable interface. It establishes connections between neighboring nodes to send data.\n\n### Interfaces\n\nInterfaces are networking communication points for your computer. Each\ninterface is associated with a physical or virtual networking device.\nTypically, your server will have one configurable network interface for each\nEthernet or wireless internet card you have. In addition, it will define a\nvirtual network interface called the \"loopback\" or localhost interface. This\nis used as an interface to connect applications and processes on a single\ncomputer to other applications and processes. You can see this referenced as\nthe \"lo\" interface in many tools.\n\n## Network Protocols\n\nNetworking works by piggybacks on a number of different protocols on top of\neach other. In this way, one piece of data can be transmitted using multiple\nprotocols encapsulated within one another.\n\nMedia Access Control(MAC) is a communications protocol that is used to\ndistinguish specific devices. Each device is supposed to get a unique MAC\naddress during the manufacturing process that differentiates it from every\nother device on the internet. Addressing hardware by the MAC address allows\nyou to reference a device by a unique value even when the software on top may\nchange the name for that specific device during operation. Media access\ncontrol is one of the only protocols from the link layer that you are likely\nto interact with on a regular basis.\n\nThe IP protocol is one of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to\nwork. IP addresses are unique on each network and they allow machines to\naddress each other across a network. It is implemented on the internet layer\nin the IP/TCP model. Networks can be linked together, but traffic must be\nrouted when crossing network boundaries. This protocol assumes an unreliable\nnetwork and multiple paths to the same destination that it can dynamically\nchange between. There are a number of different implementations of the\nprotocol. The most common implementation today is IPv4, although IPv6 is\ngrowing in popularity as an alternative due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses\navailable and improvements in the protocols capabilities.\n\nICMP: internet control message protocol is used to send messages between\ndevices to indicate the availability or error conditions. These packets are\nused in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as ping and traceroute.\nUsually ICMP packets are transmitted when a packet of a different kind meets\nsome kind of a problem. Basically, they are used as a feedback mechanism for\nnetwork communications.\n\nTCP: Transmission control protocol is implemented in the transport layer of\nthe IP/TCP model and is used to establish reliable connections. TCP is one of\nthe protocols that encapsulates data into packets. It then transfers these to\nthe remote end of the connection using the methods available on the lower\nlayers. On the other end, it can check for errors, request certain pieces to\nbe resent, and reassemble the information into one logical piece to send to\nthe application layer. The protocol builds up a connection prior to data\ntransfer using a system called a three-way handshake. This is a way for the\ntwo ends of the communication to acknowledge the request and agree upon a\nmethod of ensuring data reliability. After the data has been sent, the\nconnection is torn down using a similar four-way handshake. TCP is the\nprotocol of choice for many of the most popular uses for the internet,\nincluding WWW, FTP, SSH, and email. It is safe to say that the internet we\nknow today would not be here without TCP.\n\nUDP: User datagram protocol is a popular companion protocol to TCP and is also\nimplemented in the transport layer. The fundamental difference between UDP and\nTCP is that UDP offers unreliable data transfer. It does not verify that data\nhas been received on the other end of the connection. This might sound like a\nbad thing, and for many purposes, it is. However, it is also extremely\nimportant for some functions. It\u2019s not required to wait for confirmation that\nthe data was received and forced to resend data, UDP is much faster than TCP.\nIt does not establish a connection with the remote host, it simply fires off\nthe data to that host and doesn't care if it is accepted or not. Since UDP is\na simple transaction, it is useful for simple communications like querying for\nnetwork resources. It also doesn't maintain a state, which makes it great for\ntransmitting data from one machine to many real-time clients. This makes it\nideal for VOIP, games, and other applications that cannot afford delays.\n\nHTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol is a protocol defined in the application\nlayer that forms the basis for communication on the web. HTTP defines a number\nof functions that tell the remote system what you are requesting. For\ninstance, GET, POST, and DELETE all interact with the requested data in a\ndifferent way.\n\nFTP: File transfer protocol is in the application layer and provides a way of\ntransferring complete files from one host to another. It is inherently\ninsecure, so it is not recommended for any externally facing network unless it\nis implemented as a public, download-only resource.\n\nDNS: Domain name system is an application layer protocol used to provide a\nhuman-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources. It is what ties a\ndomain name to an IP address and allows you to access sites by name in your\nbrowser.\n\nSSH: Secure shell is an encrypted protocol implemented in the application\nlayer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way.\nMany additional technologies are built around this protocol because of its\nend-to-end encryption and ubiquity. There are many other protocols that we\nhaven't covered that are equally important. However, this should give you a\ngood overview of some of the fundamental technologies that make the internet\nand networking possible.\n\nREST(REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to\ncommunicate with each other.\n\nJSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be\ntransferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON\nobject that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).\n\nOAuth 2.0 is an open source authorization framework that enables applications\nto obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Amazon,\nGoogle, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by\ndelegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and\nauthorizing third-party applications to access the user account.\n\n# Docker\n\nBack to the Top\n\nContainer Architecture.
