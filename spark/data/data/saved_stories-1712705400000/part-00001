From the days of fglrx, the xf86-video-avivo\neffort that preceded the official AMD open-source driver project during the\nR500 days, the short-lived xf86-video-radeonhd effort via the joint effort\nwith SUSE, and so much more since then... The open-source AMD graphics driver\njourney has been a heck of a ride over the past decade and a half and remains\ngoing strong. In more recent years it's been even better with seeing pre-\nlaunch open-source graphics driver support in the upstream kernel and Mesa and\nit's been continuing that way since with Linux all the more important these\ndays.\n\nJohn Bridgman back at FOSDEM 2008 presenting on AMD's early open-source\ngraphics driver plans.\n\nIn 2011~2012 he moved on from his formal open-source GPU driver manager role\nto begin tackling AMD HSA Linux support that he went on to do for several\nyears.\n\nBridgman spent a few years working on AMD's HSA Linux efforts.\n\nSince 2015 he's been an AMD Linux NPI SW Architect working on next-gen GPU\nenablement and related activities. Now to much surprise at the end of March he\nis officially retired after 26 years with ATI/AMD.\n\nPhoronix Forums members are likely well aware of him from his interactions\nover the years where at least for some time at the company interacting with\nthe Linux community via the Phoronix Forums were among his job\nresponsibilities. He's at 13,115 posts on the Phoronix Forums as of writing.\nHe's the third most prolific commenter in the forums.\n\nCheers to John Bridgman's retirement and the many years he has been advocating\nfor open-source/Linux software at AMD.\n\nCongratulations to Bridgman on the well-deserved retirement and thanks to his\nefforts of helping advocate for open-source Linux driver support over the\nyears.\n\n76 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nAMD Working To Release MES Documentation & Source Code\n\nAMD Says They'll Be Open-Sourcing More Of Their GPU Software Stack & Hardware\nDocs\n\nAMD Releases Orochi 2.0 With More CUDA/HIP Functions Implemented For Better\nPortability\n\nAMDVLK 2024.Q1.3 Released With Fixes\n\nMesa 24.1 Merges AMD Radeon VPE 1.1 Engine Support\n\nTiny Corp Changes Course Yet Again With Plans To Offer AMD Radeon GPUs\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
