Cohen\n\nRoman Pilipey / AFP / Getty\n\nApril 10, 2024, 6 AM ET\n\nKyiv is, as ever, a lovely city, made more so by a brisk, sunny April. The\nchurch domes gleam, the caf\u00e9s are open if not bustling, the streets are swept\nclean, the parks are trimmed, and the Dnipro flows majestically past the city\nto which it gave birth. But in the various memorials in public places,\nthousands of blue-and-yellow flags with the names of the fallen flutter. At\nTaras Shevchenko University, half of the students in the auditorium to hear a\npanel discussion I appear in about the war are cadets in uniform. Their young\nfaces are grave in a way the parents of American teenagers would not\nrecognize. Senior officials whom I have met before are drawn and on edge; when\nthey smile, they rarely do so with their eyes. And on the train, as I leave\nthe city for the long trip to Poland, hard-faced officers check and recheck\npassports to make sure that no draft-eligible men are leaving the country.\n\nAt the beginning of its third year, the war is not going well for Ukraine. The\nwar is, in fact, at one of what Winston Churchill called the \u201cclimacterics,\u201d\nor inflection points, that characterize all great conflicts. At hideous cost\nto themselves\u2014measured in tens of thousands of killed, wounded, or missing men\na month\u2014Russian armies are advancing slowly. Every night Russian drones\ndistract, expose, and deplete Ukrainian air defenses, and then the cruise and\nballistic missiles rain down. Their targets are primarily the electric grid\nand civilian buildings. Kyiv, for the time being, is well defended, but\nKharkiv, which is close to the Russian border, is taking a pummeling. On the\nfront lines, the shell shortage is acute; the Ukrainians are ceding ground not\nbecause they are unwilling to fight, but because they lack the high explosives\nnecessary to do so.\n\nGeorge Packer: \u2018We only need some metal things\u2019\n\nWorse is to come. Russia has managed, by putting its economy on a war footing,\nto restore its forces and then some. It has secured supplies of weapons and\nammunition from North Korea and Iran, and, surreptitiously, much nonlethal\ngear from China. This coalition of the malevolent is cooperating ever more\nclosely. After a groggy 18 months following the defeat of its initial invasion\nand the spectacular Ukrainian attacks that drove the Russians back from Kyiv,\nKharkiv, and Kherson, the Russian military machine is adapting. It has\nintroduced large numbers of first-person-view drones, manufactured long-range\nglide bombs of ever-increasing weight, and recovered much of its previously\nsquandered talent at electronic warfare. Having squashed dissent at home, it\nis mobilizing some 300,000 troops. A new offensive looms this summer.\n\nThere are limits to Russian achievement. Its Black Sea fleet has been defeated\nand largely driven from its Crimean bases. It has proved incapable of fielding\na new generation of tanks and other systems. The shattering losses in officers\nand senior enlisted ranks mean that its ground forces continue to depend\nheavily on brutal, and often tactically primitive, means. But it feels the\ntide of battle turning in its favor.\n\nAs it does so, Russia has upped the psychological ante. Per Dmitry Peskov, the\nKremlin spokesperson, this is no longer a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d but a\nreal war\u2014not because of the Ukrainians, but because of the West. Not just any\nwar either. The Russian Orthodox Church, a sinister tool of the Russian state,\nrecently declared that \u201cfrom a spiritual and moral point of view, the special\nmilitary operation is a Holy War.\u201d The Kremlin has made clear that it disdains\nnegotiations with Kyiv. In this respect it is brutally honest: It intends to\nextirpate the Ukrainian state, returning it to a subjugated province of a\nrestored Russian empire. Failing that, it will depopulate Ukraine\u2019s cities,\npoison its fields with land mines, and deprive its remaining citizens of\npower, light, and heat.\n\nThe Ukrainian war effort is both strengthened and weakened by the nature of\nUkrainian society. As I heard one senior official observe, \u201cDoing things\n\u2018horizontally\u2019 is our national character, our national problem, and our\nnational superpower.\u201d This remains true. Aerorozvidka, an organization created\nin 2014 by a band of enthusiasts from widely varying backgrounds to make\ndrones for Ukraine, remains a major contributor to the war. Its Delta system\nof command and control\u2014a system that has been described as Uber for artillery\nsupport, though it is much more than that\u2014has enabled Ukrainian forces to be\nfar more agile than their centralized foe. Ukrainian entrepreneurs are\nbuilding more and bigger drones, and in a uniquely anarchic way, supporting\nthe military by going around a Ministry of Defense that is still too slow for\na bunch of crowdfunded engineers, investment bankers, and enthusiasts.\n\nBut this innovative and democratic spirit, although it has yielded some\nremarkable successes, and promises to deliver more, is at odds with the\ndisciplined planning systems that modern war requires. Press Ukrainian\nofficials for a view of the war that looks more than a few months ahead, and\nyou do not get very much. Ask what the theory of victory is\u2014the sequence of\nevents that will lead to the shattering of Russian armies and the liberation\nof Ukrainian territory\u2014and there you do not get much more. Even structurally,\nthe Ukrainian military, with scores of independent brigades but very little by\nway of coherent structures like divisions or corps above them, seems too\ndecentralized to work effectively.\n\nAnne Applebaum: Is congress really going to abandon Ukraine right now?\n\nFor Ukraine, the immediate concern is procuring enough ammunition to feed the\nhungry artillery pieces that can annihilate Russia\u2019s human-wave assaults and\nsupply the anti-aircraft systems that fend off the severe nightly attacks on\nits cities and infrastructure.\n\nThe crucial question is what the U.S. House of Representatives will do, and\nwhether a purblind minority of Republicans can be outwitted by their hesitant\nleadership, so that the House can deliver aid to Ukraine. Astonishingly, the\nGOP chairmen of the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees have\nasserted that some of their colleagues have succumbed to Russian propaganda.\nThe shame and disgrace that this implies cannot be expunged. It will stain the\nholdouts against aid permanently, and justly so.\n\nBut the Biden administration has its own responsibility for this situation, a\nresponsibility that is nearly as heavy. It, too, has no theory of victory and\nhas not attempted to work with Ukraine to devise one. The administration\u2019s\npromises to be with Ukraine as long as it takes are vapid. It repeatedly\nhesitated to supply Ukraine with advanced weapons in the numbers and with the\nspeed needed, thereby frittering away the great opportunity of Ukraine\u2019s first\ncounteroffensive in the summer and fall of 2022. It has not sent a military\nmission to Kyiv to work closely with Ukrainian planners and trainers. Its\nrepresentatives have, in ways that are at best strategically illiterate,\ndeclared their tepid opposition to Ukrainian deep attacks inside Russia. At\nthe top, the president has not, after two years, summoned the rhetorical force\nto explain to the American people, in a way that Franklin Roosevelt did, and\nthat John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan would have, why this faraway war means\nso much for the American future.\n\nUkraine has reported intensifying Russian uses of chemical weapons, beginning\nwith irritants, but with the potential for the more lethal kinds of attacks\nthat characterized the Syrian war. Anxious allied governments, including\nSweden and the United Kingdom, have publicly discussed the possibility of war\nbetween a conquest-intoxicated Russia and NATO within years. They may be\nright.\n\nThis does not have to be, and it will not be if the United States acts. The\nprompt passage of aid for Ukraine is but one step. Others include sending a\nmilitary mission to Ukraine, helping that country build the training and\nrotation infrastructure that it needs to sustain itself, and accelerating the\ngrowth of Ukraine\u2019s already remarkable arms industry, which now produces\ndrones that can strike more than 1,000 kilometers into Russian territory, as\nwell as advanced cruise missiles and artillery pieces.\n\nRead: Time is running out for Ukraine\n\nAbove all, the Biden administration has to tell the American people that this\nwar threatens us because it threatens European peace, has to explain the\nvalues as well as interests in play, and has to conceive its goal not as a\nmixture of supporting Ukraine just enough and nagging it with fantastic fears\nof escalation, but as ensuring victory.\n\nThat can be achieved. Russia\u2019s own strains\u2014revealed in the abortive Prigozhin\nputsch, its shocking vulnerability to terrorist attack, and the outpouring of\ngrief for the murdered Alexei Navalny\u2014are numerous. Its supposed growth in GDP\nis an artifact of military spending that is not sustainable. Sanctions are\ntaking a toll but can be intensified. Its army, though operationally\nadaptable, remains tactically crude and susceptible to being bled out. The\nPutin regime\u2019s ferocious clampdown on dissent reveals weakness, not strength.\nThe job of the Biden administration is to judge those weaknesses correctly,\nexploit them ruthlessly, and, with its allies, help Ukraine defeat an enemy as\ncruel and malignant as any in history. Unless the administration rises to the\noccasion, a dark spring could bring much bleaker seasons to follow.\n\nEliot Cohen is a contributing writer at The Atlantic.
