At first, it\u2019s a one-\nperson show: you are the cook, the cashier, the marketer, and the janitor. But\nafter a while, business picks up and you decide to hire someone to help clean\nthe dishes. You\u2019re still busy with all the other work you had before, but at\nleast you don\u2019t have to worry about scrubbing plates.\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.

But then you get a bad review from\na customer about their utensils being dirty. You decide to observe your new\nemployee more closely, but it seems as though they are doing their job well.\nSo you relax a bit and weeks go by.\n\nThen, you get another bad review from a customer complaining that their plate\nhad not been cleaned at all. This review includes a picture, so you decide to\npolitely confront your employee and show them the evidence. But they claim the\ncustomer simply took a photo of their plate after they had eaten their meal\nand that the plate had been clean when it was served.\n\nYou decide to put off some of your other duties and work exclusively in the\nkitchen alongside your employee the next couple of days to put the matter to\nrest. You spend time inspecting plates, utensils, and cups a couple times per\nday, but all of the items you inspect are clean. Despite this, you get another\nreview from what appears to be a new and different customer about a dirty\nplate.\n\n##\n\nEven When the Work is Obvious, Measuring Performance Isn\u2019t\n\nHere we have an example of a work task that is very easy to evaluate. Most\npeople are likely to agree whether or not a plate is dirty or clean. Despite\nthis, it\u2019s unclear what to do in this situation. Your employee is punctual and\nappears to be doing their job. But you can\u2019t watch them every second of the\nday and so you can\u2019t be 100% sure that they aren\u2019t shirking their work when\nyou aren\u2019t looking. It could also be the case that your dishwasher is\npartially broken, or that some dishes have lost their enamel coating and so\nhold onto food scraps despite being washed. Finally, you could just have some\nvery picky customers who see a tiny fleck of pepper on their plate and fly off\nthe handle about it being disgustingly dirty.\n\nThe world is complicated, employers have limited time to assess performance,\nand even when the work should be easy to measure, human behavior complicates\nthe picture.\n\nNow imagine that instead of a single dishwasher working in a restaurant you\nown and operate, you employ 10 people at a digital ad agency. Two are artists,\ntwo are salespeople, two run ad campaigns, two are project managers, and two\nare software engineers. Half of the team works remotely, the other half comes\ninto the office 3 days a week. Let\u2019s assume that you have professional\nexperience in sales, but not in the other disciplines.\n\nHow would you decide who was doing well and who wasn\u2019t?\n\nLet\u2019s make it even more difficult and assume that you are running an\norganization of 500 people with many layers of management between you and the\nemployees doing the day-to-day work. How would you know if the line employees\nare performing well? Would you trust your senior leaders? Would you take the\ntime to speak with direct team managers on a regular basis?\n\n##\n\nHow to Measure Performance When You Can\u2019t\n\nThe point is that it is really, really, really hard to evaluate whether\nsomeone is doing a good job or not. As a result, most employers and managers\nuse a lot of signals to decide who to hire, who to promote, and who to fire.\nMany of those signals aren\u2019t really related to job performance. For instance,\nif you are punctual, visually healthy, outwardly polite, responsive, and\nconsistent, you\u2019re probably a top 50% employee already. Note that none of\nthose traits is \u201cproducing good work\u201d or \u201cbeing good at the thing you\u2019re hired\nto do.\u201d Just nailing the basics goes a long way towards convincing other\npeople and your boss that you are effective.\n\nThe other big category that bosses use to determine the performance of\nemployees is what other people say about them. If you have the baseline\nprofessional skills worked out (see above), there\u2019s a fair chance that the\ndifference between being promoted and being ignored comes down to how well you\ncan get other people to sing your praise. You might think that this is unfair\nwork politics - after all, shouldn\u2019t the quality of your work speak for you?\nHardly.\n\nIt takes effort to get others to speak well of you. And if you are successful\nat doing that, you\u2019ve demonstrated a very important and valuable skill:\ninfluencing other humans. Especially among knowledge workers, people who can\ndo that are more valuable to the organizations that employ them.\n\nWhat can you do with this knowledge? Nail the basics. Don\u2019t be fooled by\nincreasingly informal workplace culture: punctuality, responsiveness, and\nliterally just showing up are hard behaviors to display consistently. Invest\nin those behaviors. After you\u2019ve mastered them, invest in influencing other\npeople to recommend you to your boss.\n\nMastering basic professionalism is a huge competitive advantage and can lead\nto significant career advancement, even if you aren\u2019t the best dishwasher in\nthe world and occasionally miss a plate or two.\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.
