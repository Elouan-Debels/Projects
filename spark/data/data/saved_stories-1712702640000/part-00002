Few of them, though, have gone through as\ndramatic a renaissance in their reputation as Brussels sprouts.\n\nFor many years, they were scorned. Even Steve Bontadelli admits it, and he\nmakes his living growing them. \"A lot of people of my generation hated them,\"\nhe says. \"Their moms boiled them and made them even stinkier.\"\n\nBontadelli's farm is near Santa Cruz, Calif., where the weather is perfect for\ngrowing this vegetable. \"We actually had a Brussels sprouts festival here for\nabout 10 years,\" he says. \"And we got a lot of free press out of the deal,\nbecause people couldn't believe that you'd have a festival for Brussels\nsprouts.\"\n\nWhat's worse, they even deserved their bad reputation. \"They were just very\nbitter; a very strong bitter taste,\" Bontadelli says.\n\nThis all started to change in the 1990s, and it began in the Netherlands,\nwhere Brussels sprouts have a simpler name: spruitjes. A Dutch scientist named\nHans van Doorn, who worked at the seed and chemical company Novartis (the seed\npart is now called Syngenta), figured out exactly which chemical compounds in\nspruitjes made them bitter.\n\nAt that point, the small handful of companies that sell Brussels sprouts seeds\nstarted searching their archives, looking for old varieties that happen to\nhave low levels of the bitter chemicals.\n\nOne of the companies, also based in the Netherlands, is Bejo Zaden. \"We have a\nwhole gene bank here in our cellars, with all the possible Brussels sprouts\nvarieties that were available from the past,\" says Cees Sintenie, a plant\nbreeder at Bejo Zaden.\n\nThe company Bejo Zaden, or Bejo Seeds, discovered less-bitter Brussels sprouts\namong the packets of seeds that make up its \"gene bank\" of old varieties.

The companies grew them in test\nplots, and they did, in fact, find some that weren't as bitter. They cross-\npollinated these old varieties with modern, high-yielding ones, trying to\ncombine the best traits of old and new spruitjes. It took many years. But it\nworked. \"From then on, the taste was much better. It really improved,\"\nSintenie says.\n\nThen word spread in the professional culinary scene. It took off mainly in the\nUnited States, not in Europe.\n\nShannan Troncoso remembers hearing, about a decade ago, that celebrity chef\nDavid Chang was doing amazing things with Brussels sprouts and bacon at his\nrestaurant Momofuku, in New York. Then she encountered some crispy fried\nBrussels sprouts at a restaurant in San Francisco. \"It was so good, I was\nlike, I can figure this out! And I can introduce this back into my area,\" she\nsays.\n\nFreshly fried leaves of Brussels sprouts at Brookland's Finest Bar & Kitchen.\nCatie Dull/NPR hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nCatie Dull/NPR\n\nFreshly fried leaves of Brussels sprouts at Brookland's Finest Bar & Kitchen.\n\nCatie Dull/NPR\n\nWhen she launched her own restaurant \u2014 Brookland's Finest Bar & Kitchen, a\nneighborhood establishment in Northeast Washington, D.C. \u2014 they were on the\nmenu from very beginning.\n\n\"We peel the leaves off, each tiny little leaf. That's like a full-time job\nfor somebody,\" she says. The actual cooking takes no time at all. Troncoso\ndrops a basket of leaves into the fryer. Within seconds, they're turning\nbrown. She pulls them out, lets them drain for a bit, then tosses them with a\nbit of lemon juice and salt.\n\nTroncoso says that her customers had to be talked into ordering them at first.\n\"People are kind of like, 'ugh, Brussels sprouts,' \" she says. But now it's\none of her most popular dishes.\n\nShannan Troncoso tells skeptical customers that if they don't like her fried\nBrussels sprouts, she'll pay for them.

Because\nhe'd been in the business his whole life. His eyes would just pop out when I'd\ntell him. He couldn't believe it.\"\n\nBontadelli says that there were only about 2,500 acres in the whole country\nplanted with Brussels sprouts just a few years ago. Today, there are 10,000\nacres of Brussels sprouts in the U.S., and fields are getting planted in\nMexico, too \u2014 just so people can get their Brussels sprouts year-round.\n\n  * brussels sprouts\n  * plant breeding\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Food\n\n#### It's Pretty Easy To Level Up Your Coffee Game \u2014 Here's How\n\n##### Health\n\n#### Food Banks Get The Love, But SNAP Does More To Fight Hunger\n\n##### Food\n\n#### A step-by-step guide to planting an edible garden this spring\n\n##### Food\n\n#### 'Essential' Status Means Jobs For Farmworkers, But Greater Virus Risk\n\n##### Food\n\n#### Judge Blocks Rule That Would Have Kicked 700,000 People Off SNAP\n\n##### Science\n\n#### Why Taller Grass Can Be Bad News For Grasshoppers\n\n### Popular on NPR.org\n\n##### Culture\n\n#### Morgan Wallen arrested for throwing a chair from a rooftop bar in\nNashville\n\n##### Science\n\n#### In the womb, a brother's hormones can shape a sister's future\n\n##### News\n\n#### Trump says abortion should be left to states; Vatican takes stance on\ngender theory\n\n##### National\n\n#### 'A masterclass in how to give terrible answers': Inside that Prince\nAndrew interview\n\n##### Religion\n\n#### The Vatican says surrogacy and gender theory are 'grave threats' to human\ndignity\n\n##### Business\n\n#### Some Walmart shoppers could get up to $500 in cash from a class-action\nsettlement\n\n### NPR Editors' Picks\n\n##### National\n\n#### The Arizona Supreme Court allows a near-total abortion ban to take effect\nsoon\n\n##### National\n\n#### Norfolk Southern will pay $600 million to settle East Palestine\nderailment lawsuit\n\n##### World\n\n#### Israel's Palestinian citizens grow louder in protesting the Gaza war\n\n##### Author Interviews\n\n#### 'Magical Overthinking' author says information overload can stoke\nirrational thoughts\n\n##### Middle East\n\n#### Kamala Harris called for a cease-fire in Gaza.
