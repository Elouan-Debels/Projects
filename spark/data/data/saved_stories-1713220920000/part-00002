We were highlighting this in the context of\nElon\u2019s site disguising posted links in a manner that made it easier for\nscammers to trick people into thinking they were going to a reputable site,\nwhen they were not.\n\nIt looks like things have gotten even worse on that front. As Matt Binder\npointed out at Mashable, ExTwitter has been experimenting with forcing the\nword \u201ctwitter\u201d to change to \u201cx\u201d throughout the app. This is because, since\nMusk\u2019s hasty change of names, which it was clear the company was unable to\nprepare for, the word \u201ctwitter\u201d still remains all over the app. So, it seems\nlike Musk was getting fed up of being reminded of the old app (you know, the\none that actually worked most of the time and didn\u2019t fall over every few\ndays).\n\nScarily, this auto-change appears to happen even in the display of links in\nthe iOS app, leading to crazy situations where people post domains with\n\u2018twitter\u201d in them, and ExTwitter makes them appear like they\u2019re saying \u201cx.\u201d\n\nBut, this creates... a pretty massive security problem as the article\ndescribes:\n\n> Let\u2019s say someone owns the domain name \u201cNetfliTwitter.com.\u201d Why would they\n> own that domain name? Because if X is automatically changing anything that\n> includes \u201cTwitter.com\u201d to \u201cX.com,\u201d then that means posting\n> \u201cNetfliTwitter.com\u201d on X would make it appear in posts as \u201cNetflix.com,\u201d the\n> popular movie streaming service. And if a user clicked the linked\n> \u201cNetflix.com\u201d text that appears in that post, it would really take them to\n> \u201cNetfliTwitter.com.\u201d Because while X is changing the text that the user\n> wrote, the URL it links and directs to remains the same as the user posted.\n>\n> This is a dream scenario for someone looking to steal passwords through\n> phishing campaigns.\n\nLuckily, two of the most popular domains that include a prominent \u201cx\u201d that\ncould be used in this manner for phishing have been grabbed by good samaritans\n(not ExTwitter, of course) to prevent them from being abused:\n\n> The example I just provided isn\u2019t a hypothetical either. Some users on X\n> noticed this very problem and found that it could quickly be utilized by\n> scammers, hackers, and other bad actors. X user @yuyu0127_ quickly\n> registered the domain name \u201cNetfliTwitter.com\u201d in order to prevent it from\n> being weaponized and put up a warning page on the URL about the potential\n> issues in X\u2019s changes.\n>\n> \u201cThis domain has been acquired to prevent its use for malicious purposes,\u201d\n> reads the headline text on \u201cNetfliTwitter.com.\u201d\n>\n> Another domain name \u201cseTwitter.com\u201d was also registered due to its potential\n> to be exploited as X would then change how the URL is viewed on the platform\n> to \u201csex.com.\u201d The X user, @amasato_mochi, who registered that domain name,\n> also put up a warning page in order to put a spotlight on the issue.\n>\n> \u201cPlease be very careful not to access suspicious URLs,\u201d reads seTwitter.com.\n> \u201cI will hold onto this domain for a year to prevent any harm.\u201d\n\nBut still, this is a hugely problematic \u201cfeature,\u201d and the kind of thing that\na good trust & safety team would have recognized before the product ever\nrolled off the line and was handed to everyone to abuse.\n\nOne key job of trust & safety is to red-team new features to think about how\nthey might be abused and to prevent such abuses before they happen. But when\nyou fire all the experienced trust & safety folks, you\u2019re going to continue to\nmake these kinds of mistakes that make users way less safe, leading to\nsignificantly decreased trust.\n\nFiled Under: elon musk, links, phishing, trust & safety, urls Companies:\ntwitter, x\n\n37 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Judge Slams Ken Paxton\u2019s Attack On Media Matters\u2019 Free Speech Rights\n  * Elon Musk's Lawyer Faces Sanctions After Deposition Meltdown, While Engaging In Unauthorized Practice Of Law\n  * Elon Claims Twitter\u2019s Traffic Is At An All-Time High Because He Can\u2019t Be Bothered To Understand The Misleading Data People Show Him\n  * Elon Finally Finds A Government He\u2019s Willing To Stand Up To: When The Censorship Demands Target His Political Allies\n  * Ctrl-Alt-Speech: Are Platforms Ready For Elections?\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cOnce Again, ExTwitter Makes Links Dangerous; The Kind Of Thing\nA Trust & Safety Team Would Catch\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n37 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 9:55 am\n\nLeave it to the great innovator Elon Musk to find a way to cause an instance\nof the decades-old Scunthorpe Problem on his site.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThis comment has been deemed funny by the community.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 10:01 am\n\n# Re:\n\nTurns out he\u2019s speedrunning the content moderation learning curve in reverse.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 10:44 am\n\n# Re: Re:\n\nYou forget, this is musk.

When it became an issue was\nwhen our content filtering triggered on half a dozen or so different people\nall trying to visit the same porn site on our network: buttfront dotcom\n\nOne person getting bounced trying to visit a porn site is something that\nhappens. Maybe it was an accident, or some script on some website, or maybe\nthey even just didn\u2019t realize they were using their work computer. I don\u2019t\ncare. It happens.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got several people getting bounced trying to hit the same porn\nsite, something is very badly wrong.\n\nTurns out that something was a Scunthorpe problem in the Cloud-to-Butt plugin,\nencountering calls to Amazon cloudfront.\n\nElon has implemented a brand new Scunthorpe problem on Twitter. That problem\nwas named in 1996. Nearly 30 fucking years ago. And there was awareness of it\nbefore then within the industry.\n\nLiterally, the Scunthorpe problem is one of the first content moderation\nproblems ever. Which direction is he speedrunning the curve, exactly?\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nXxxxx Xxxxxxx says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 10:02 am\n\n# XX\n\nEx-X, you mean?\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nClockwork-Muse says:\n\nApril 12, 2024 at 10:03 am\n\n# clbuttic rears its ugly head again\n\nI guess this is just a more egregious form of the ol\u2019 \u201cclbuttic\u201d problem\nagain.\n\nAll major computer languages have utilities for rewriting specific parts of a\nsubdomain, that allows pulling out each individual subdomain, that would\nprevent exactly this problem.
