And that includes Shakespeare\nwith a capital S: Chicago Shakespeare Theater just wrapped up a critically\nacclaimed production of Richard III, while the Shakespeare Theatre Company in\nD.C. is preparing to welcome an immersive Macbeth and San Diego\u2019s Old Globe\nplans to stage all four Henry VI plays as a two-part event this summer.\n\nAnother historically ambitious multi-part Shakespeare project is taking shape\nat the Guthrie Theater. The storied Minneapolis institution is currently\nperforming the Bard\u2019s epic trilogy, Richard II, Henry IV (its parts 1 and 2\nhave been condensed into a single evening), and Henry V, in rotating\nrepertory. A company of 25 actors is bringing the story to life, swapping\ncharacters and costumes depending on the show and night.\n\nIn development for years, the project\u2019s scope first turned heads when it was\nannounced pre-pandemic in 2020. But considering the challenges that theaters\nnow face in 2024, the endeavor has reached a new level of dramatic novelty.\n\n\u201cIn this moment, with some retraction in the field\u2014and the Guthrie is not\noutside of those challenges\u2014I felt it was important that we as an organization\nplant a flag here,\u201d said Guthrie artistic director Joseph Haj, who is helming\nthe plays. \u201cWe wanted to show that we\u2019re still very much capable of work of\nscale, of ambition and of intelligence.\u201d\n\nA bit like Game of Thrones, Shakespeare\u2019s Henriad, as the four plays are often\ndubbed, explores the power and cost of seizing and wearing the British crown\nover the course of 22 epic years. Audiences watch a king become a man, a man\nbecome a king, and the king become a hero.\n\nThe Guthrie has embraced the saga\u2019s heroic scale at every turn. The costume\nmatrix alone resembles something closer to a blockbuster musical, with almost\n200 pieces. The stage, which morphs into a distinct look for each play, is\npacked with steel staircases, lifts, and not one but two turntables. In\naddition to the 25 cast members, 12 understudies dutifully stand by, ready to\ncover a dizzying array of tracks. Then there\u2019s the script itself, which, while\ncut and trimmed, still comes in at more than 300 pages.\n\nIt\u2019s a sizable undertaking, one designed to test and challenge the entire\nGuthrie operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial for organizations to find these moments periodically where we do\nthe thing that we are not certain that we know how to do,\u201d Haj told the cast\nand production team on the first day of rehearsal. \u201cWe must do the thing that\ntests us absolutely. It\u2019s why we climb mountains. It\u2019s why we run marathons.\nTo find out where our limits reside.\u201d\n\nDaniel Jos\u00e9 Molina, Stephanie Anne Bertumen, Tyler Michaels King, Lanise\nAntoine Shelley, and Jimmy Kieffer in \u201cRichard II\u201d at the Guthrie Theater.\n(Photo by Dan Norman)\n\n## A Return to Repertory\n\nHelping guide the current team through this theatrical triathlon is the\nGuthrie\u2019s own history, which has shown that it indeed knows how to do this.\nFounded in 1963 by English director Sir Tyrone Guthrie, the theatre bearing\nhis name began as a repertory theatre, presenting plays in rotation with a\nresident company for decades. In 1990, the acting company, under Garland\nWright and Charles Newell\u2019s direction, staged the Henriad to much acclaim.\n\nHaj remembers those plays fondly, as he was a member of the acting company\nthen.\n\n\u201cThe entire experience lives so richly in my being and in my memory,\u201d Haj said\nin an interview. \u201cI remember those marathon days where we played all of the\nplays on the same day, and how rich of an artistic experience that was, how\ndefining that was for me as a young artist.\u201d\n\nA photo from the 1990 production of \u201cRichard II,\u201d featuring Charles Janasz,\nhas literally been woven into a wall inside the Guthrie\u2019s new building. (Photo\nby Abraham Swee)\n\nGhosts from the 1990 production still greet Guthrie audiences to this day. The\ntrio of shows was so deeply revered that when it came time to open the\ntheatre\u2019s new building in 2006, production images from the trilogy were subtly\nwoven into the walls, literally with a special threading process. Attentive\nvisitors will spot King Richard contemplating life near guest services, Henry\nBolingbroke freshly crowned outside the thrust stage, and Harry Percy and Haj\nsword-fighting above the building\u2019s four-story escalator.\n\nBut ghosts from the past don\u2019t necessarily ensure victory on this new\ncampaign. Instead, the Guthrie is relying on a much more tangible secret\nweapon: time. Time in development. And time in the rehearsal room.\n\nHaj first reached out to the Guthrie\u2019s resident dramaturg, Carla Steen, to\nbegin whittling down the script more than five years ago. Together they\nweighed which characters would get the boot, which speeches would stay, and,\nabove all, how to best preserve the forward momentum of a nine-hour stage\nepic.\n\nAlong the way they staged two workshops and considered an array of artistic\npossibilities. There were also a lot of math problems: How quickly could one\nactor change costumes? How soon could the audience accept a featured actor\nreturning in a different role? And how could they ensure that each performer\nreceives ample breaks throughout the show?\n\n\u201cWe needed a framework to even begin to understand how to begin to populate\nthe plays,\u201d Steen said. \u201cThe math had to be done in order to enable the\nartistic input.\u201d\n\nSteen and the Guthrie\u2019s resident casting director, Jen Liestman, relied on\nstopwatches and Excel spreadsheets to develop the final casting matrix. They\nultimately landed on a company of 21 actors in about 100 roles (four extras\nare also featured).\n\nWoven into the acting tracks are deliberate easter eggs: The actor who plays\nRichard II, a king removed from power, also plays Lord Mortimer in Henry IV, a\nrebel who fights the current king. Such calculated casting choices are there\nfor the audience to revel in, though if they don\u2019t catch them that\u2019s also\nfine.\n\n\u201cThis journey was mathematical but it was also artistic\u2014we really had to think\nabout those things in concert,\u201d Liestman said.\n\n## In Service of the Story\n\nThe Guthrie welcomed their acting company in January. After years of\ndevelopment, it was now the job of living, breathing performers to bring the\nplays to life.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a test unlike any other for an actor,\u201d said Jasmine Bracey, a\nmember of the company whose acting track includes Duchess of York, Worcester,\nMontjoy, and Alice. \u201cWill your voice hold up? Will you say the right line?\nWill you even know if you\u2019re in the right play?\u201d\n\nInstead of the typical five-week rehearsal schedule, the cast was granted nine\nweeks together before their first preview in March\u2014still a lean timetable\nconsidering the breadth of work that needed to be done. Haj set a blistering\npace from the start, staging Richard II in just four days.\n\nTo achieve their task on time (and to do it well), Bracey said the company\nleft their egos at the door, focusing only on the story in front of them.\n\n\u201cEvery single beat, every single moment, we know that our job is to serve the\nstory,\u201d Bracey said. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll work in a room where people are serving\ntheir own concept, But in this space, we are all making choices to serve the\nBard\u2019s story. It\u2019s been just extraordinary.\u201d\n\nFueling the company through each line\u2014and there are a lot of them\u2014is a\npowerful, complicated tale. Shakespeare uses his trio of kings to tackle big\nthemes: ambition, pride, leadership, and the terrible cost of war. On top of\nthe running time and logistics, it\u2019s a big but gratifying load to carry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing I think I\u2019ve ever done, and it\u2019s also as good a time\nas I\u2019ve ever had in a rehearsal room,\u201d Haj said. \u201cAll of the demands of these\nvery hard plays are satisfying because the plays are just genuinely,\nlegitimately great.\u201d\n\nDirector Joseph Haj in rehearsal. (Photo by Abraham Swee)\n\nDoes every audience member need to sign up for the whole ride? Each play has\nbeen produced to stand on its own, with unique conflicts, characters, and\nthemes, so that patrons can sample the shows however they wish: individually,\ncollectively, in or out of order. For diehards, the Guthrie is offering two\nmarathon Saturdays at which audiences will be treated to the complete\nnarrative arc in a single day: You can catch Richard II at 10 a.m., have\nlunch, sit with Henry IV at 3 p.m., and then, after dinner, end your day with\nHenry V\u2019s war with the French, starting at at 8:30 p.m. Indeed the opening\nday, April 13, is one of those marathon days.\n\n\u201cThe joy of being able to set some things up early, in Richard II, then pull\nthe thread on late in Henry V\u2014that is super, super exciting,\u201d Haj said. \u201cThat\nlong-form storytelling...if we think in contemporary life of The Godfather,\nThe Crown, or Succession\u2014all of those modern iterations were built on the\narchitecture of these history plays.\u201d\n\nHaj believes the entire experience will go down as a once-in-a-generation\nendeavor for staff, artists, and audiences alike.\n\n\u201cYou might get one or two of these sorts of things in your entire career,\u201d Haj\nsaid. \u201cI think that\u2019s feeling to many of us like a real gift.\u201d\n\nAbraham Swee (he/him) is a Minneapolis-based freelance journalist.
