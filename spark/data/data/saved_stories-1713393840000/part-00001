In the United States and Europe the reduction will be about 11%, while\nin Africa and south Asia it will be 22%, with some individual countries much\nhigher than this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Leonie Wenz, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for\nClimate Impact Research and one of the authors of the study. \u201cI am used to my\nwork not having a nice societal outcome, but I was surprised by how big the\ndamages were. The inequality dimension was really shocking.\u201d\n\nThe study also looked at the second half of this century, where human actions\nnow can still make a big difference. If business as usual continues, the\nauthors projected average income losses of more than 60% by 2100. But if\nemissions fall to net zero by mid century, income declines will stabilise by\nmid century at about 20%.\n\nThe economic hit predicted by the paper is more than twice as high as any\nprevious analysis.\n\nBehind that difference is a more sophisticated methodology. While most\nprevious studies considered only damages related to rising temperatures at a\nnational level, the new paper also incorporated rainfall and extreme weather\nimpacts using 40 years of data from 1,600 subnational regions. This is\nimportant because weather is a local rather than national phenomenon. The\nstudy also considered how impacts tend to persist over months and years,\nrather than being only a short-term hit.\n\nEDF renewables\u2019 employees at the solar farm, La Fito photovoltaic park, in\nsouth-east France.

By contrast, the new paper says countries such as\nGermany (-11%), France (-13%), the US (-11%) and UK (-7%) will lose out even\nby mid century. Worst affected will be countries in already hot regions\nincluding Botswana (-25%), Mali (-25%), Iraq (-30%), Qatar (-31%), Pakistan\n(-26%) and Brazil (-21%).\n\nMaximilian Kotz, an author of the study, said: \u201cStrong income reductions are\nprojected for the majority of regions, including North America and Europe,\nwith south Asia and Africa being most strongly affected. These are caused by\nthe impact of climate change on various aspects that are relevant for economic\ngrowth such as agricultural yields, labour productivity or infrastructure.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Down to Earth\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe planet's most important stories.

There\nare many major climate impacts that have not yet been incorporated into the\nanalysis, including heatwaves, sea level rise, tropical cyclones, tipping\npoints, and damage to natural ecosystems and human health. The authors said\nthese factors would be added to future models.\n\n\u201cWe are providing a more comprehensive picture but this is not the final\npicture,\u201d Wenz said. \u201cIt is likely a lower bound.\u201d\n\nThe authors said the study showed the need for stronger adaptation strategies,\nparticularly in poorer, worst-affected countries, to cope with the changes up\nto 2050 that are already locked into the climate system.\n\nIt also found that reducing emissions was far cheaper than doing nothing and\naccepting more severe impacts. By 2050, it calculated mitigation costs \u2013 for\nexample, from phasing out fossils and replacing them with renewable energy \u2013\nto be $6tn dollars, which is less than a sixth of the median damage costs for\nthat year of $38tn.\n\nAnders Levermann, the head of complexity science at the Potsdam Institute,\nsaid: \u201cIt is on us to decide: structural change towards a renewable energy\nsystem is needed for our security and will save us money. Staying on the path\nwe are currently on will lead to catastrophic consequences. The temperature of\nthe planet can only be stabilised if we stop burning oil, gas and coal.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Climate crisis\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
