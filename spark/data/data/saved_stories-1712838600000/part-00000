As they continue to widely circulate, however, it\u2019s\nbeneficial for psychologists to study why people believe in them, what traits\nencourage such beliefs, and what we can do to curb their spread.\n\nBut while much research has been done on these aspects, relatively little has\nfocused on how a person\u2019s belief in conspiracy theories evolves over time.\n\nSpringing forth to begin to fill this gap, Matt Williams and team\u2019s latest\nstudy took a closer look at just how much, if at all, everyday people\u2019s\nbeliefs in conspiracies change over a specific six month span during which\ndeveloping them may have been particularly tempting.\n\nAdopting a longitudinal design, the team recruited 498 adult participants\nliving in Australia and New Zealand. The study took place from March to\nSeptember 2021, a period in which Covid-19 vaccinations were being rolled out,\nand many areas in Australia and New Zealand were still operating under\nlockdown conditions \u2014 according to existing theories, facing such widespread\nsocietal threat and uncertainty plausibly made this a time ripe for growth in\nconspiracy belief.\n\nThroughout these six months, participants completed a survey on seven\noccasions, responding to questions focused on widespread conspiracies, such as\nSARS-CoV-2 being a bioweapon, 9/11 being an inside job, condensation from\nplanes supposedly being harmful \u2018chemtrails\u2019, and vaccinations being a way to\nimplant a chip in people's bodies. After reading the theories, participants\nindicated how much they agreed with each of them, allowing the team to create\na general conspiracy belief score out of five for each participant.\n\nAnalyses revealed that there was very little change in participants\u2019 belief in\nconspiracy theories during the study. While some people did change their minds\nabout conspiracy theories (both adopting and abandoning them) there was far\nless variance in individuals\u2019 conspiracy beliefs than there was as a group\noverall. Across the six months, the average change in score was small, with\nmean changes of 0.16 points, or 3.2% \u2014 representing very marginal changes in\nbelief.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, considering the moment at which this research was\nconducted, there was just one conspiracy theory that bucked this trend: the\nbelief that SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon created by China, which\nincreased slightly between May and June 2021. These shifts, however, were a\nmarginal 3.8% increase, which the team argues is \u201cdifficult to reconcile\u201d with\nexplanatory theories such as the Existential Threat Model, which suggests that\ndistressing societal events lead people to embrace conspiracy theories. With\nthe Covid pandemic being one of the most distressing global events in recent\nmemory, such models might expect a greater increase.\n\nWhile these findings are somewhat reassuring, in that they suggest people\u2019s\nbelief in conspiracy theories is relatively stable, even in the face of\nwidespread societal threat, it\u2019s possible that the beliefs of this highly\neducated, young, and liberal sample might not paint the full picture. Findings\nfrom this demographic won\u2019t easily generalise to those with right-wing\npolitical beliefs \u2014 and with those at the extremes often cited as more readily\nembracing of conspiracy theories, we arguably need more studies that pursue\nparticipants who fall into this group. Conservative participants in this study\n(just 9% of the total cohort) showed higher levels of conspiracy belief, which\nsuggests cause for a replication effort with a more diverse sample.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that most participants disagreed with the theories\nthey were shown \u2014 the most popular overall was that pharmaceutical companies\nhad suppressed a cure for cancer, which still only sat at an average of 2.23\nout of 5 on the scale of belief. The fact that these participants had a\ngenerally low belief in conspiracies, therefore, may also act as a limitation,\nor at least a point for future research to address.\n\nFinally, most of the conspiracies looked at in the study were popularised much\nearlier than the study\u2019s start date. Future research could look at how those\nprone to conspiracy beliefs come to embrace new theories as they emerge and\ntake shape, which could hopefully offer further insights on how to protect\nagainst fringe beliefs.\n\nRead the paper in full.\n\n## Related articles\n\n  * Why more highly educated people are less into conspiracy theories\n\n05 April 2017\n\nPsychologists are very interested in why some people are more inclined to\nbelieve in conspiracy theories, especially since the consequences can be\nharmful.\n\n    * Cognition and perception\n    * Government and politics\n    * Social and behavioural\n\n  * Labelling something a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d does little to stop people from believing it\n\n02 March 2022\n\nThe label \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is often slapped on unsubstantiated ideas.
