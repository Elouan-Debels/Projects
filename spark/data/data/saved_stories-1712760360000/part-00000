His parents, though,\nargued that computer science, then a young field, might be more practical.\n\u201cThey said, maybe you will have an easier time finding a job after you\ngraduate,\u201d Wigderson recalls. \u201cAnd anyway, there\u2019ll be lots of math there.\u201d\n\nThat decision put him on the path to being named the 2023 ACM A.M. Turing\nAward laureate for his foundational contributions to the theory of\ncomputation, in particular by expanding understanding of the role that\nrandomness plays in computation and mathematics.\n\nWigderson, now the Herbert H. Maass Professor at the School of Mathematics at\nthe Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, has made a career of\nstudying complexity theory. He also advanced our understanding of zero-\nknowledge proofs, which allow someone to show they know some information while\nkeeping that information secret.\n\nScientists used to believe that making random choices carried an advantage\nwhen figuring out some complex problems. For example, a deterministic\nalgorithm that looked for a large prime number, divisible only by itself and\n1, would take a very long time. On the other hand, randomly picking a large\ninteger and testing it for primality could provide an answer much quicker, as\nlong as scientists were willing to accept a small amount of uncertainty.\n\nWigderson, though, showed that under natural, widely believed assumptions, any\nsuch fast probabilistic algorithm could be replaced with a fast deterministic\nalgorithm. \u201cOf course, the deterministic algorithm will be slower than the\nprobabilistic one, but only moderately slower,\u201d he says.\n\nThis is the second award Wigderson has received that has been described as the\nNobel Prize of its field. In 2021 he shared the Abel Prize, which recognizes\nachievements in mathematics, with L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in\nBudapest, in part for bringing the two fields together.\n\n[See a Q&A with Wigderson, \u201cSpecifying the Power and Limitations of\nRandomness\u201d]\n\nNeil Savage is a science and technology writer based in Lowell, MA, USA.\n\n  * Share\n\n    * Twitter\n    * Reddit\n    * Hacker News\n  * Print\n  * Join the Discussion\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Join the Discussion (0)\n\n#### Become a Member or Sign In to Post a Comment\n\nSign In Sign Up\n\n### The Latest from CACM\n\nExplore More\n\nNews Apr 10 2024\n\nWigderson Named Turing Awardee for Decisive Work on Randomness\n\nNeil Savage\n\nComputer History\n\nBLOG@CACM Apr 9 2024\n\nScreen Time: What and How Much is Too Much?\n\nSaurabh Bagchi\n\nHCI\n\nNews Apr 8 2024\n\nPerspectives on AI from Around the Globe\n\nKaren Emslie\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\n### Shape the Future of Computing\n\nACM encourages its members to take a direct hand in shaping the future of the\nassociation.
