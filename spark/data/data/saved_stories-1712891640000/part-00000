But\njust as dangerous as this rapid growth can be a bacterium\u2019s resting state,\nwhich helps the pathogen evade antibiotics and contributes to severe chronic\ninfections in the lungs and blood, within wounds, and on the surfaces of\nmedical devices.\n\nNow, Scripps Research scientists have discovered how long chains of molecules\ncalled polyphosphates (polyP) are needed for bacteria to slow down movements\nwithin cells and let them enter this resting state. The findings, published in\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on April 02, 2024, could\neventually lead to new ways of treating chronic infections in which typical\nantibiotics aren\u2019t effective.\n\n\u201cMany current antibiotics block bacterial growth, but bacteria spend a lot of\ntheir time not growing,\u201d says Lisa Racki, PhD, assistant professor in the\nDepartment of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at Scripps\nResearch and senior author of the new paper. \u201cWe really need new and creative\nstrategies for targeting bacteria\u2019s slow-growing and non-growing phases.\u201d\n\nResearchers have long known that bacteria can survive for especially long\nperiods of time when they stop growing, entering a dormant and energy-saving\nstate. They also knew that when bacteria enter this resting state, they use\nvaluable energy to produce polyP strands, which form large clumps inside their\ncells. But scientists had been historically unsure about the purpose of polyP.\n\nTo study polyP, Racki and her collaborators turned to Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\nbacteria that can cause pneumonia and blood infections in people who are\nhospitalized or have weakened immune systems. One of the reasons P. aeruginosa\ncan be so hard to treat is that it forms biofilms\u2014tightly joined, slimy\ncommunities of bacteria, many of which are in a resting state and can evade\ntypical antibiotics.\n\nWhen P. aeruginosa is starved of nitrogen\u2014one of the key nutrients it needs\nfor growth\u2014it produces lots of polyP. In the new work, Racki and her\ncollaborators at EPFL and Caltech discovered that a mutant unable to make\npolyP cannot enter its resting state. To better understand why this happens\nand the consequences, the researchers genetically engineered P. aeruginosa to\nmake small, labeled particles that let them track how molecules within the\nbacteria were moving around.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is that when you get rid of polyP, everything in the cell moves\ntoo much,\u201d says Racki. \u201cThe cells are partying when they should be taking a\nbreak.\u201d\n\nWhen starved of most nutrients, P. aeruginosa slows the movement of materials\nwithin its interior and stops dividing. But without nitrogen and polyP, the\nbacteria keep moving materials around at top-speed, become bigger, loosen\ntheir genetic material and continue dividing.\n\nRacki\u2019s team concluded that polyP is usually responsible for helping P.\naeruginosa\u2014and likely other bacterial species\u2014slow down. It also leads them to\nhypothesize that preventing cells from producing polyP could keep them active\nand make them more susceptible to some antibiotics.\n\n\u201cThis not only helps point in possible directions for treating pathogenic\nbacteria, but also reveals answers for fundamental questions about how things\ndiffuse throughout a bacterial cell,\u201d says Racki.\n\nRacki and her lab are now planning more experiments to better probe exactly\nwhy cells cannot slow their interior movements without polyP, and whether\nblocking the bacterial production of polyP could be an effective tactic to\ntreat some infections.\n\nIn addition to Racki, authors of the study, \u201cPolyphosphate affects cytoplasmic\nand chromosomal dynamics in nitrogen-starved Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u201d, are\nSofia Magkiriadou, Willi Leopold Stepp and Suliana Manley of the Swiss Federal\nInstitute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL); and Dianne Newman of Caltech.\n\nThis work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health\n(DP2-GM- 784-140918), the European Research Council (ERC CoG 819823), the\nSwiss National Science Foundation (182429), and the Donald E. and Delia B.\nBaxter Foundation Fellowship.\n\nInfectious Diseases Racki, Lisa\n\nFor more information, contact press@scripps.edu See More News\n\n### Share\n\n  * Careers\n  * Campus Resources\n  * Campus Safety\n  * International Services Office\n  * Compliance\n  * Faculty Recruitment\n  * Title IX\n  * Contact\n  * Procurement\n  * Intranet\n\n###### Address\n\n10550 North Torrey Pines Road La Jolla, CA 92037 (858) 784-1000\n\nCopyright @ 2024 The Scripps Research Institute.
