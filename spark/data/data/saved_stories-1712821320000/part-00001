The raft was primarily\ncomposed of bamboo, steel, iron piping, and rock.^[2] It was anchored on a\nshallow ocean bank with an old Ford engine block and measured 8 ft \u00d7 30 ft\n(2.4 m \u00d7 9.1 m). At the time, the area was considered international\nwaters.^[3]\n\nOn July 4, 1964, Hemingway established New Atlantis as a republic, claiming\nthe area around his raft. He wrote the constitution with a typewriter and\ncopied it almost verbatim from the Constitution of the United States.^[3] He\nargued that his raft was technically an island and based his sovereignty on\nthe Guano Islands Act of 1856. He claimed the unoccupied half of his raft was\nUnited States territory, while the other half was the nation of New\nAtlantis.^[3]\n\nBy 1965, there were six inhabitants of New Atlantis. This included the\nHemingway family of Leicester, his wife Doris, and their two daughters Anne\n(age 7) and Hilary (age 3). Joining them was public relations specialist\nEdward K. Moss and his assistant Julia Cellini. The group unanimously elected\nLeicester as president.^[2] His election saw significant press coverage, and\nmade front-page headlines in neighboring Jamaica.^[3]\n\nHemingway's goal was to experiment with democracy and to research marine life\nin the Caribbean Sea.^[4] He formed the International Marine Research Society,\nan organization headquartered on the raft with the aim of funding and\nfurthering the study of marine biology. Ultimately, Hemingway sought to build\na research aquarium in Jamaica.^[2]\n\nInitially funded through the publication of My Brother, Ernest Hemingway,\nHemingway planned to finance his operations with the sale of stamps. Although\nseveral batches of stamps had already been printed, the Universal Postal Union\nrefused to recognize their validity.^[3] Hemingway mailed a stamp featuring\nLyndon B. Johnson to the White House and claimed international recognition\nwhen the reply letter from the U.S. State Department addressed him as \"Acting\nPresident\".^[5] He also intended to mint coins, write books and scripts, and\nencourage tourism.^[6]\n\nHemingway planned to expand his domain considerably. He claimed the seafloor\n50 feet below the raft as his and intended to create his own artificial island\nby piling up rocks.^[6] However, within a few years of establishment, New\nAtlantis was destroyed by tropical storms. The wreckage was then salvaged by\nlocal fishermen.^[7]\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\nFlag of New Atlantis\n\nHemingway authorized his own currency, which he called the \"scruple\".^[3] It\nconsisted of trinkets such as fish hooks, carob beans, shark teeth, and other\nmiscellany. A flag was sewn by Doris Hemingway, which, along with other\nmemorabilia, was donated to the Harry Ransom Center in 1966.^[2]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n    1.^1 The article states 78 degrees 4 minutes longitude, 18 degrees 1 minute latitude.^[6] The geodetic datum used is unspecified.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Cross, Michaela (April 5, 2016). \"How to Claim Your Very Own Island\".
