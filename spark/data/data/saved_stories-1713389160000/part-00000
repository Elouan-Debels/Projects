In addition to announcing the\nopening of our new office, we also want to share the progress we have made as\npart of this agreement in the areas of digital government, health and\neducation:\n\n  * Digital government. We worked hand-in-hand with the government in its journey to develop simple digital ecosystems for import, export, health and sanitary registration. Next steps will be to continue supporting the government on developing platforms that allow interoperability between institutions and improve citizen services through digitization.\n  * Healthcare. As a first important step, we\u2019ve trained different government agencies on how to use cloud technologies. Now, we\u2019re supporting the government in the development of its telemedicine platform with cutting-edge technologies, like artificial intelligence, to automate processes and bring more access to health services in the country.\n  * Education. Building on a collaboration with El Salvador\u2019s Ministry of Education since 2020, we\u2019re proud to support a long-term project putting technology at the center of improving teaching and learning in the nation's public education system. The first phase began by delivering Google Workspace for Education accounts to all students in public schools and training teachers through the Ministry of Education's National Institute for Teacher Training (Instituto Nacional de Formaci\u00f3n Docente del Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n). We\u2019re supporting the acceleration of that program by delivering the most advanced Google Workspace for Education Plus tools that incorporate AI to personalize the learning experience and introducing Chromebooks, laptops running Chrome OS, an operating system manufactured by Google, for fourth grade students. The next step is to continue training pedagogical managers to multiply the digital skills of teachers and students in El Salvador.\n\nAccording to a Google-funded study from AlphaBeta, digital technologies such\nas cloud computing and AI could create a potential opportunity for up to $3.4\ntrillion per year of economic impact in the major and emerging economies in\nLatin America, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East by 2030. We see our\ncollaboration with the Government of El Salvador as a testament of this\npotential.\n\n## Boosting entrepreneurship in El Salvador\n\nIn addition to our new office presence and the current digital transformation\nefforts underway, Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, will provide a\ndonation of $200,000 USD to civil society organizations in the region to\nprovide digital skills training to local entrepreneurs to help support the\ngrowth of local businesses.\n\nBusinesses of all sizes can take advantage of digital platforms to effectively\ncommunicate their message and connect with potential customers. Growth Digital\nis helping support Salvadoran businesses by providing them with the tools and\nexperience to harness the power of Google Ads to grow their businesses.\n\nInnovation and technology have helped millions of people around the world. It\nis the coordinated action of governments, the private sector, and civil\nsociety that translates the benefits into economic growth and stability for\nall communities and people to benefit.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n###\n\nRelated stories\n\n  * Company announcements\n\n#### An expanded partnership with Reddit\n\nGoogle is expanding our partnership with Reddit, including a new Cloud\npartnership and access to Reddit's Data API.\n\nBy Rajan Patel\n\nFeb 22, 2024\n\n  * A message from our CEO\n\n#### Israel-Hamas war: $8 million in relief\n\nHow Google is supporting people in Israel, Gaza, and around the world,\nincluding through $8 million to support local nonprofits.\n\nBy Sundar Pichai\n\nOct 17, 2023\n\n  * Company announcements\n\n#### 5 things to do at the new Google Visitor Experience\n\nBy Google\n\nOct 12, 2023\n\n  * Company announcements\n\n#### Google at 25: By the numbers\n\nBy Michelle Budzyna Molly McHugh-Johnson\n\nSep 27, 2023\n\n  * Company announcements\n\n#### Thank you for 25 years of curiosity\n\nSep 27, 2023\n\n  * Company announcements\n\n#### Gracias por 25 a\u00f1os de curiosidad\n\nSep 27, 2023\n\n  * .\n\nLet\u2019s stay in touch.
