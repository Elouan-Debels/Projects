In all likelihood, you\u2019ll find three different distances. But if you\narrange the points in an equilateral triangle, then every distance is the\nsame. In a plane, this is impossible to do with four points. The smallest\nnumber of distances you can engineer is 2 \u2014 the edges and diagonals of a\nsquare.\n\nBut if you lift one of the points up off the plane to create a pyramid, each\nof whose sides is an equilateral triangle, you\u2019ll have a set of four points\nthat are separated by a single unique distance \u2014 the length of one side of the\ntriangle.\n\nIf you have lots of points, these patterns grow even more pronounced. A\nhundred randomly scattered points in a plane are likely to define 4,950\ndistinct pairwise distances. But if you arrange 100 points in a flat, square\ngrid, any pair of points will be separated by one of just 50 possible\ndistances. Lift the points into a three-dimensional grid, and you can reduce\nthat number even further.\n\nAnswering questions about the number of distances between points might sound\nlike an esoteric exercise. But in the decades-long quest to solve such\nproblems, mathematicians have developed tools that have a wide range of other\napplications, from number theory to physics.\n\n\u201cWhen people tried to solve the problem,\u201d said Pablo Shmerkin of the\nUniversity of British Columbia, \u201cthey started discovering connections that\nwere surprising and unexpected.\u201d\n\nThe latest development came late last year, when a collaboration of four\nmathematicians proved a new relationship between the geometry of sets of\npoints and the distances between them.\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\nThe list of different distances determined by a set of points is called its\ndistance set; count how many numbers are in that list, and you get the\ndistance set\u2019s size. In 1946, the prolific mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s\nconjectured that for large numbers of points, the distance set cannot be\nsmaller than what you get when you arrange the points into a grid. The\nproblem, though simple on its face, turned out to be extremely deep and\ndifficult. Even in two dimensions, it still hasn\u2019t been fully proved, though\nin 2010, two mathematicians got so close that it\u2019s now considered effectively\nsettled; it remains open in higher dimensions.\n\nMeanwhile, mathematicians also formulated new versions of the conjecture. One\nof the most important of these arose in a 1985 paper by Kenneth Falconer, a\nmathematician at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Falconer wondered\nwhat can be said about the distinct distances among an infinite number of\npoints.\n\nIf you have infinitely many points, simply counting is no longer very useful.\nBut mathematicians have other ways of defining size. Falconer\u2019s conjecture\nposits a relationship between the geometry of the set of points \u2014\ncharacterized by a number called the fractal dimension \u2014 and the size of the\ndistance set, characterized by a number called the measure.\n\nThe fractal dimension aligns with ordinary intuition about dimensions. Just as\nwith the more familiar concept of dimension, a line segment has a fractal\ndimension of 1, while a square (with its interior filled in) has a fractal\ndimension of 2. But if a collection of points forms a more complicated fractal\npattern \u2014 like a curve where microscopic twists and turns keep appearing no\nmatter how far you zoom in \u2014 its fractal dimension might not be a whole\nnumber. For example, the Koch snowflake curve shown below, which has an\nendless series of ever-smaller triangular bumps, has a dimension of about\n1.26.\n\nIn general, an infinite collection of points has a fractal dimension that\nroughly depends on how dispersed it is. If it\u2019s spread around the plane, its\nfractal dimension will be close to 2. If it looks more like a line, its\nfractal dimension will be close to 1. The same kinds of structures can be\ndefined for sets of points in three-dimensional space, or in even higher\ndimensions.\n\nOn the other side of Falconer\u2019s conjecture is the measure of the distance set.\nMeasure is a sort of mathematical generalization of the notion of length. A\nsingle number, which can be represented as a point on a number line, has zero\nmeasure. But even infinite sets can have zero measure. For example, the\nintegers are so thinly scattered among the real numbers that they have no\ncollective \u201clength,\u201d and so form a set of measure zero. On the other hand, the\nreal numbers between, say, 3/4 and 1 have measure 1/4, because that\u2019s how long\nthe interval is.\n\nAbstractions navigates promising ideas in science and mathematics. Journey\nwith us and join the conversation.\n\n#### See all Abstractions blog\n\nThe measure gives a way to characterize the size of the set of distinct\ndistances among infinitely many points. If the number of distances is \u201csmall,\u201d\nthat means the distance set will have measure zero: There are a lot of\nduplicated distances. If, on the other hand, the distance set has a measure\nthat\u2019s bigger than zero, that means there are many different distances.\n\nIn two dimensions, Falconer proved that any set of points with fractal\ndimension greater than 1.5 has a distance set with nonzero measure. But\nmathematicians quickly came to believe that this was true for all sets with a\nfractal dimension greater than 1. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to resolve this 1/2 gap,\u201d said\nYumeng Ou of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the co-authors of the new\npaper. Moreover, Falconer\u2019s conjecture extends into three or more dimensions:\nFor points scattered in a d-dimensional space, it states that if the points\u2019\nfractal dimension is more than d/2, then the measure of the distance set must\nbe greater than 0.\n\nIn 2018, Ou, together with colleagues, showed that the conjecture holds in two\ndimensions for all sets with fractal dimension greater than 5/4. Now Ou \u2014\nalong with Xiumin Du of Northwestern University, Ruixiang Zhang of the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, and Kevin Ren of Princeton University \u2014\nhave proved that in higher dimensions, the threshold for ensuring a distance\nset with nonzero measure is a little smaller than d/2 + 1/4. \u201cThe bounds in\nhigher dimensions, in this paper, for the first time ever, are better than in\ndimension 2,\u201d Shmerkin said. (In two dimensions, the threshold is precisely\nd/2 + 1/4.)\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### Merging Fields, Mathematicians Go the Distance on Old Problem\n\n  2. ### Mathematicians Cross the Line to Get to the Point\n\n  3. ### The Biggest Smallest Triangle Just Got Smaller\n\nThis latest result is just one in a wave of recent advances on Falconer\u2019s\nconjecture. The proof refined techniques in harmonic analysis \u2014 a seemingly\ndistant area of math that deals with representing arbitrarily complicated\nfunctions in terms of simple waves \u2014 to strengthen the bound. But some of\nthose techniques were first developed in order to tackle this very same\nproblem.\n\nThis question about distances between points \u201chas served as a playground for\nsome of the biggest ideas in harmonic analysis,\u201d said Alex Iosevich of the\nUniversity of Rochester.\n\nThough they\u2019ve closed only half of the gap left by Falconer in his 1985 paper,\nmathematicians see the recent spate of work as evidence that the full\nconjecture may finally be within reach. In the meantime, they\u2019ll continue to\nuse the problem as a testing ground for their most sophisticated tools.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nContributing Correspondent\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nAbstractions blogfractalsgeometrymathematicsAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Abstractions blog\n\nastronomy\n\n### How the Ancient Art of Eclipse Prediction Became an Exact Science\n\nBy Joshua Sokol\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\nneuroscience\n\n### Overexposure Distorted the Science of Mirror Neurons\n\nBy Meghan Willcoxon\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\napplied math\n\n### Topologists Tackle the Trouble With Poll Placement\n\nBy Lyndie Chiou\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
