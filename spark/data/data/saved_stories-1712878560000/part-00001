regulators who are increasingly\nblocking mergers, including the company\u2019s planned acquisition of robotic\nvacuum maker iRobot, which fell apart earlier this year amid antitrust\nconcerns.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really kind of a sad story,\u201d Jassy said in an interview with\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin on \u201cSquawk Box\u201d after the Amazon chief released his\nannual shareholder letter. The acquisition stood to give iRobot a competitive\nboost against rivals, Jassy said, but regulators blocked the deal \u201cbecause\nthey worry that we\u2019re going to feature our vacuum cleaner, the Roomba, vs.\nothers, which of course is not our model.\u201d\n\nAmazon in January walked away from its plan to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion\nafter Europe\u2019s antitrust watchdog and the Federal Trade Commission said it\nraised competition concerns. iRobot laid off 31% of its staff, and its shares\nhave plunged more than 75% so far this year.\n\nJassy said the move showed that regulators \u201ctrust these two large Chinese\ncompanies with maps of the inside of U.S. consumers\u2019 homes more than they do\nAmazon.\u201d\n\nThe robotic vacuum industry has become increasingly crowded in recent years,\nwith companies like China-based Anker, Ecovacs and Roborock, as well as\nSharkNinja, eating into iRobot\u2019s once-dominant share of the market.\n\nThe iRobot decision also comes as global regulators have been more aggressive\nin attempting to block Big Tech companies from expanding further, with the\nBiden administration making antitrust enforcement in the tech sector a top\npriority.\n\nAs megadeals have slowed to a crawl, tech companies have made a flurry of\ninvestments in artificial intelligence startups, seeking to gain a foothold in\nthe burgeoning market. Amazon last month added $2.75 billion to its stake in\nAI startup Anthropic, which also counts Google as one of its biggest backers.\nMicrosoft has invested billions in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.\n\nRegulators have zeroed in on these partnerships as well, with the FTC\nlaunching an inquiry into the deals in January.\n\n\u201cI think people don\u2019t know what they can do right now,\u201d Jassy said. He urged\nregulators to be \u201cmore reasonable\u201d in their stance on Big Tech deals.\n\nAmazon also faces an ongoing lawsuit by the FTC. The agency sued Amazon in\nSeptember, accusing it of operating an illegal monopoly that stifles\ncompetition and raised prices for consumers, while increasing costs for\nsellers.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on Amazon\u2019s sprawling third-party marketplace, which is\nthe linchpin of its e-commerce business. The marketplace now accounts for more\nthan 60% of goods sold on the platform, and includes numerous businesses that\ngenerate millions of dollars in annual revenue on the site.\n\nThrough the years, Amazon has built a well-oiled fulfillment and logistics\nmachine that enables it and third-party sellers to deliver products to\ncustomers at increasingly breakneck speeds. CNBC previously reported that a\nmassive network of groups have sought to take advantage of Amazon\u2019s scale and\nlenient returns processes by carrying out fraudulent refunds.\n\nIt\u2019s ballooned into a massive problem for retailers, costing them more than\n$101 billion last year, according to a survey by the National Retail\nFederation and Appriss Retail.\n\nWhen asked how Amazon is tackling returns fraud, Jassy said the company has\nteams charged with examining returned goods to make sure they\u2019re\n\u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt our scale, you find you get some of everything,\u201d he added.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Thursday\u2019s analyst calls: Boeing price target cut, Nvidia to rally more than 25%\n  * Citi says this \u2018high risk\u2019 but \u2018attractive\u2019 global stock has 280% upside\n  * This AI stock could fall 50% and has an \u2018exaggerated artificial intelligence narrative,\u2019 Morningstar says\n  * Morgan Stanley names 3 overlooked global tech stocks, giving one almost 100% upside\n\nTV\n\nPower LunchWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Closing Bell 03:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
