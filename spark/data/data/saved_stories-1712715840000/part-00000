That is why we took our time when designing the new Find My Device,\nwhich uses a crowdsourced device-locating network to help you find your lost\nor misplaced devices and belongings quickly \u2013 even when they\u2019re offline. We\ngave careful consideration to the potential user security and privacy\nchallenges that come with device finding services.\n\nDuring development, it was important for us to ensure the new Find My Device\nwas secure by default and private by design. To build a private, crowdsourced\ndevice-locating network, we first conducted user research and gathered\nfeedback from privacy and advocacy groups. Next, we developed multi-layered\nprotections across three main areas: data safeguards, safety-first\nprotections, and user controls. This approach provides defense-in-depth for\nFind My Device users.\n\nHow location crowdsourcing works on the Find My Device network\n\nThe Find My Device network locates devices by harnessing the Bluetooth\nproximity of surrounding Android devices. Imagine you drop your keys at a\ncafe. The keys themselves have no location capabilities, but they may have a\nBluetooth tag attached. Nearby Android devices participating in the Find My\nDevice network report the location of the Bluetooth tag. When the owner\nrealizes they have lost their keys and logs into the Find My Device mobile\napp, they will be able to see the aggregated location contributed by nearby\nAndroid devices and locate their keys.\n\nFind My Device network protections\n\nLet\u2019s dive into key details of the multi-layered protections for the Find My\nDevice network:\n\n  * Data Safeguards: We\u2019ve implemented protections that help ensure the privacy of everyone participating in the network and the crowdsourced location data that powers it.\n\n    * Location data is end-to-end encrypted. When Android devices participating in the network report the location of a Bluetooth tag, the location is end-to-end encrypted using a key that is only accessible to the Bluetooth tag owner and anyone the owner has shared the tag with in the Find My Device app. Only the Bluetooth tag owner (and those they\u2019ve chosen to share access with) can decrypt and view the tag\u2019s location. With end-to-end encrypted location data, Google cannot decrypt, see, or otherwise use the location data.\n    * Private, crowdsourced location reports. These end-to-end encrypted locations are contributed to the Find My Device network in a manner that does not allow Google to identify the owners of the nearby Android devices that provided the location data. And when the Find My Device network shows the location and timestamp to the Bluetooth tag\u2019s owner to help them find their belongings, no other information about the nearby Android devices that contributed the data is included.\n    * Minimizing network data. End-to-end encrypted location data is minimally buffered and frequently overwritten. In addition, if the network can help find a Bluetooth tag using the owner\u2019s nearby devices (e.g., if their own phone detects the tag), the network will discard crowdsourced reports for the tag.\n  * Safety-first Protections: The Find My Device network protects against risks such as use of an unknown Bluetooth tag to stalk or identify another user, including:\n\n    * Aggregation by default. This is a first-of-its-kind safety protection that makes unwanted tracking to a private location, like your home, more difficult. By default, the Find My Device network requires multiple nearby Android devices to detect a tag before reporting its location to the tag's owner. Our research found that the Find My Device network is most valuable in public settings like cafes and airports, where there are likely many devices nearby. By implementing aggregation before showing a tag\u2019s location to its owner, the network can take advantage of its biggest strength \u2013 over a billion Android devices that can participate. This helps tag owners find their lost devices in these busier locations while prioritizing safety from unwanted tracking near private locations. In less busy areas, last known location and Nest finding are reliable ways to locate items.\n    * At home protection. If a user has chosen to save their home address in their Google Account, their Android device will also ensure that it does not contribute crowdsourced location reports to the Find My Device network when it is near the user\u2019s home. This provides additional protection on top of aggregation by default against unwanted tracking near private locations.\n    * Rate limiting and throttling. The Find My Device network limits the number of times that a nearby Android device can contribute a location report for a particular Bluetooth tag. The network also throttles how frequently the owner of a Bluetooth tag can request an updated location for the tag. We've found that lost items are typically left behind in stationary spots. For example, you lose your keys at the cafe, and they stay at the table where you had your morning coffee. Meanwhile, a malicious user is often trying to engage in real-time tracking of a person. By applying rate limiting and throttling to reduce how often the location of a device is updated, the network continues to be helpful for finding items, like your lost checked baggage on a trip, while helping mitigate the risk of real-time tracking.\n    * Unknown tracker alerts. The Find My Device network is also compliant with the integration version of the joint industry standard for unwanted tracking. Being compliant with the integration version of the standard means that both Android and iOS users will receive unknown tracker alerts if the on-device algorithm detects that someone may be using a Find My Device network-compatible tag to track them without their knowledge, proactively alerting the user through a notification on their phone.\n  * User Controls: Android users always have full control over which of their devices participate in the Find My Device network and how those devices participate. Users can either stick with the default and contribute to aggregated location reporting, opt into contributing non-aggregated locations, or turn the network off altogether. Find My Device also provides the ability to secure or erase data from a lost device.\n\nIn addition to careful security architectural design, the new Find My Device\nnetwork has undergone internal Android red team testing. The Find My Device\nnetwork has also been added to the Android security vulnerability rewards\nprogram to take advantage of Android\u2019s global ecosystem of security\nresearchers. We\u2019re also engaging with select researchers through our private\ngrant program to encourage more targeted research.\n\nPrioritizing user safety on Find My Device\n\nTogether, these multi-layered user protections help mitigate potential risks\nto user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and\nrecover lost devices.\n\nAs bad actors continue to look for new ways to exploit users, our work to help\nkeep users safe on Android is never over. We have an unwavering commitment to\ncontinue to improve user protections on Find My Device and prioritize user\nsafety.\n\nFor more information about Find My Device on Android, please visit our help\ncenter.
