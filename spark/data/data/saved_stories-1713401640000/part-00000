Subscribe for free to receive new posts\nand support my work.\n\nAnd a longer overview of all features of the platform is here:\n\nControlAI was born from a simple observation- that AI Safety and Compliance is\ntoo difficult to operationalise. The ecosystem is fragmented and lacking a\nunified vision of how to achieve safer, more robust models.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard discussions between e/acc members and Pause AI activists. Both\nsides agree we want to avoid a Terminator-like future but disagree on what\nneeds to be done to prevent it. It is easy to sensationalise the topic because\nthere is actually very little agreement on the basics: what does robustness\nmeans? what model is trustworthy? how much alignment and testing do we need?\nwhat kind of tests are necessary to achieve that?\n\nControlAI is on a mission to help you get a reliable answer to these questions\nand streamline your compliance journey. We want to help you understand what\nrisks are involved in deploying LLMs before they occur and give you an easy-\nto-understand overview of what needs to be done to mitigate them. Too many\ndevelopers have been busy deploying a particular fuzzing or guardrail tool to\nfind out that it neither mitigates their business problems nor absolves them\nfrom legal responsibility.\n\nControlAI is here, uniting the fragmented ecosystem to make AI compliance\nsimple, intuitive and easy.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe platform enables you to:\n\n1\\. Create an inventory of AI assets and applicable threats\n\n2\\. Understand what is required from you to satisfy variety of regulations\nsuch as the ISO Norms, EU AI Act and GDPR\n\n3\\. Track your progress towards achieving compliance\n\n4\\. Deploy verified defenses to protect your stack and monitor incidents\n\n5\\. Showcase your AI safety solutions for other companies to use\n\nNow let\u2019s analyze each of these functionalities in detail:\n\n###\n\nCreate an inventory of AI assets and applicable threats\n\nUnderstanding what models are deployed within your organization is not an easy\ntask. So is monitoring these assets for potential risks. With each week\nbringing new jailbreaks, even seasoned academics might have a problem\nidentifying all potential vulnerabilities and incidents. Our platform empowers\nyou to stay up to date with the existing risks and apply this knowledge to\nmodels deployed within your organization. ControlAI provides a single source\nof truth for AI inventory, enabling you to track existing assets and potential\nrisks with ease.\n\n###\n\nUnderstand what is required from you to satisfy variety of regulations such as\nthe ISO Norms, EU AI Act and GDPR\n\nCompliance norms are often complicated, and adhering to them requires tracking\ndozens of requirements hidden within hundreds of pages of legal acts, often\nlocked behind paywalls. ControlAI helps you understand what is expected from\nyou to fulfil a specific act by streamlining the process. You no longer have\nto read through the detailed documentation! Just fill in a short set of\nquestionnaires and generate requirements specific for your use case quickly.\n\n###\n\nTrack your progress towards achieving compliance and security\n\nOnce you understand what needs to be done to improve your compliance, you can\ntrack the progress towards satisfying the norms through our platform. Same\ngoes for cybersecurity. You can also generate reports to track it.\n\n###\n\nDeploy verified defenses to protect your stack and monitor incidents\n\nIdentifying risks is one thing, another is mitigating them. We offer you a\ndirectory of defenses, some made by ourselves, some made by our partners or\nopen-source communities to enable you to patch the vulnerabilities you\u2019ve\nidentified.\n\n###\n\nShowcase your AI safety solutions for other companies to use\n\nWe understand that protecting LLMs is a daunting task that can only be\nfulfilled by a coordinated effort of the entire AI safety community. That is\nwhy we offer a chance to other AI auditing and defense tool makers to showcase\ntheir products on our platform. Those would appear in the \u201cVerified Tools\u201d\ndirectory. Similarly, if you are a policymaker aiming to speed the adoption of\nyour requirements, let us know and we will add them to the platform.\n\nHope that was helpful! If the current version of the platform does not answer\nyour needs, let us know too! Your feedback is critical for the further\ndevelopment of the platform.\n\nControlAI is the work of a solo founder, indie hacking my way to success.
