| CMA\n\nSkip to main content\n\nVisit us\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n# Health care crisis: What\u2019s next after Canada\u2019s new federal funding\nannouncement?\n\nOn Feb. 7, the federal government announced a $46.2-billion increase in health\nfunding to provinces and territories over the next 10 years.\n\nThis long-awaited offer \u2014 accepted by premiers across the country \u2014 is a\nnecessary step to transform Canada\u2019s health care system, which requires\nstabilization, sustainability and investment in reform.\n\nThe Canadian Medical Association (CMA) has been advocating for a long-term\nincrease to the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) as well as new accountability\nmeasures to ensure quality outcomes and value for money for both providers and\npatients.\n\n## What\u2019s in the health funding envelope?\n\nFederal funding includes three core components:\n\n  * An immediate and unconditional $2-billion top-up to the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) to address the pressure on emergency and operating rooms, as well as pediatric hospitals;\n\n  * a 10-year federal funding commitment via the Canada Health Transfer, including a 5% annual increase for the first five years; and\n\n  * bilateral agreements with each respective province or territory, a 10-year funding commitment of $25 billion.\n\nOther investments include:\n\n  * $1.7 billion over five years to support hourly wage increases for personal support workers (PSWs) and related professionals and to recruit and retain healthcare workers;\n\n  * $150 million over five years for the Territorial Health Investment Fund to strengthen service delivery; and\n\n  * $2 billion over 10 years for Indigenous health.\n\n## What about provincial accountability for federal health funds?\n\nDespite being the largest major transfer of federal funds to provinces and\nterritories, money from the CHT does not necessarily have to be spent on\nhealth care.\n\nIn order to secure the increased CHT funding outlined in the Feb. 7 agreement,\nprovinces and territories must commit to:\n\n  * Improving health care information collection and reporting;\n\n  * developing and using comparable performance indicators via the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI); and\n\n  * adopting common standards and policies on health data.\n\n## What happens now?\n\nThe federal health minister and intergovernmental affairs minister are in the\nmidst of finalizing bilateral agreements with each province and territory.\n\nThese agreements are centred on four shared health priorities, tailored to\neach jurisdiction:\n\n  * Expanding access to family health services, including in rural and remote areas;\n\n  * supporting health workers and reducing backlogs;\n\n  * improving access to quality mental health and substance use services; and\n\n  * modernizing the health care system with standardized health data and digital tools.\n\nIn addition to these shared priorities, provinces and territories must commit\nto advancing foreign credential recognition and labour mobility for health\nworkers, beginning with multi-jurisdictional credential recognition.\n\n## What do the provinces and territories want from bilateral health funding\ndeals?\n\nCollectively, the premiers have asked Ottawa for a formal review process to\nensure long-term sustainability \u2014 avoiding what they call a \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d\nwhen deals expire.\n\nThe premiers highlighted this in a recent letter to Prime Minister Justin\nTrudeau: \u201cTo achieve our shared goals, further constructive discussions are\nrequired to plan for the longer term predictability and stability that\nCanadians expect in their health care systems.\u201d\n\n## When will patients and providers see the impact of the new funding?\n\nIt will be a while.\n\nBilateral agreements are expected to be finalized by the end of March \u2014 which\nis also when the federal budget is set to be tabled \u2014 but part of those deals\nis a three-year action plan from each province and territory, which will\nlikely to take months to develop.\n\nThe CMA is advocating for bold solutions to transform health care\n\n## Why is this funding package necessary?\n\nCanada spends more than $300 billion annually on health care \u2014 about 13% of\nour GDP, or the second highest among OECD countries \u2014 and yet we lag on key\nperformance indicators.\n\nMore than 70% of the health care spending is publicly funded through tax\nrevenues: The provinces and territories spend approximately 78%, with the\nfederal government providing the rest primarily through the Canada Health\nTransfer (CHT). In return for this funding, the federal government requires\nprovinces and territories to comply with the provisions of the CHT.\n\nLearn more about health care funding in Canada\n\nProvinces and territories need long-term, stable funding to manage increased\ncosts.\n\nInvestment alone, however, isn\u2019t enough.\n\nIt will take efficiency, innovation and flexibility \u2014 as well as increased\naccountability \u2014 to improve delivery of care. The federal funding package is a\nfirst step in that direction.\n\n## Questions or Comments?\n\nContact CMA News\n\n## CMA Foundation Opens in a new window\n\nProviding impactful charitable giving to registered Canadian charities to\nfurther excellence in health care\n\n## MD Financial Management Opens in a new window\n\nThe financial services firm exclusively dedicated to the financial well-being\nof Canada's physicians and their families\n\n\u00a9 2024 Canadian Medical Association\n\nBack to top\n\nx\n\n## By browsing the Canadian Medical Association website, you consent to the\nuse of cookies.\n\nTo learn more about how we use cookies and how to disable them, please consult\nour Privacy Policy.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
