The codex is named after Thomas\nCoke, Earl of Leicester, who purchased it in 1717. The codex provides an\ninsight into the inquiring mind of the definitive Renaissance artist,\nscientist and thinker, as well as an exceptional illustration of the link\nbetween art and science and the creativity of the scientific process.^[1]\n\nWhen the manuscript was last sold\u2014to Bill Gates at Christie's auction house on\n11 November 1994 in New York for US$30,802,500 (equivalent to $63,320,092 in\n2023^[2])\u2014it was the most expensive manuscript ever sold.^[3]^[4]^[5]\n\n## Manuscript[edit]\n\nThe leather-bound notebook comprises 36 sheets, 29 \u00d7 22 cm. The manuscript is\nnot a single linear script but a mixture of Leonardo's observations and\ntheories on astronomy and the properties of water, rocks, fossils, air, and\ncelestial light. The topics addressed include:^[6]\n\n  * An explanation of why fossils of sea creatures can be found on mountains. Hundreds of years before plate tectonics became accepted scientific theory, Leonardo believed that mountains had previously formed sea beds, which were gradually lifted until they formed mountains.^[6]\n  * The movement of water. This is the main topic of the Codex Leicester. Among other things, Leonardo wrote about the flow of water in rivers and how it is affected by different obstacles put in its way. He made recommendations about bridge construction and erosion from his observations.^[6]\n  * The luminosity of the Moon. Leonardo speculated that the Moon's surface is covered by water, reflecting the Sun's light. In this model, waves on the water's surface cause the light to be reflected in many directions, explaining why the Moon is not as bright as the Sun. Leonardo explained that the pale glow on the dark portion of the crescent Moon is caused by sunlight reflected from the Earth. Thus, he described the phenomenon of planetshine one hundred years before the German astronomer Johannes Kepler proved it.^[6]\n\nThe codex consists of 18 sheets of paper, each folded in half and written on\nboth sides, forming the complete 72-page document.^[7] At one time the sheets\nwere bound together, but they are now displayed separately. It was handwritten\nin Italian by Leonardo, using his characteristic mirror writing, and supported\nby copious drawings and diagrams.^[8]\n\n## History[edit]\n\n### Historical owners[edit]\n\n  * Guglielmo della Porta, Michelangelo's student (?)\n  * Giuseppe Ghezzi (until 1719)\n  * Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (1719\u20131759)\n  * Leicester estate (1759\u20131980)\n\n### Codex Hammer[edit]\n\nThe codex was purchased at auction from the Leicester estate in 1980 by the\nwealthy industrialist and art collector Armand Hammer, for $5.1 million ($18.9\nmillion in 2023); he later renamed the notebook the Codex Hammer.^[9] Hammer\ncommissioned Leonardo da Vinci scholar Carlo Pedretti to compile the loose\npages of the codex back into its original form. Over the next seven years,\nPedretti translated each page to English, completing the project in 1987.^[10]\n\n### Bill Gates[edit]\n\nThe codex was sold to Bill Gates by Christie's auction house on 11 November\n1994 in New York for US$30,802,500.^[4] Until 2021, the codex remained the\nmost expensive book ever sold.^[11]\n\nAfter Gates acquired the codex, he had its pages scanned into digital image\nfiles, some of which were later distributed as screensaver and wallpaper files\non a CD-ROM as part of a Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 desktop theme, which\nwould later be included with Windows 98 and Windows ME. A comprehensive CD-ROM\nversion (titled Leonardo da Vinci) was released by Corbis in 1997.\n\nThe Codex Leicester has been unbound, with each page individually mounted\nbetween glass panes. It is on public display once a year in a different city\nworldwide. In 2000, it was displayed at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum.^[12] In\n2004, it was exhibited in the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, and 2005 in Tokyo. One page\nwas exhibited at the Seattle Museum of Flight's 2006 exhibit Leonardo da\nVinci: Man, Inventor, Genius. From June to August 2007, the codex was the\ncenterpiece of a two-month exhibition hosted by the Chester Beatty Library in\nDublin. The codex was on view at the Phoenix Art Museum in Phoenix, Arizona,\nfrom 24 January 2015 to 12 April 2015 for the exhibition Leonardo Da Vinci's\nCodex Leicester and the Power of Observation. Its presentation at the Phoenix\nArt Museum was the first time a work by Leonardo was displayed in\nArizona.^[13] The codex was then on view at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts\nin an exhibition Leonardo Da Vinci, the Codex Leicester, and the Creative Mind\nthat opened 21 June 2015, where it remained on display until 30 August\n2015.^[14] As part of the same tour, the Codex Leicester was also on display\nat the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, North Carolina from 31 October\n2015 to 17 January 2016.^[15]\n\nFor the 500th anniversary of da Vinci's death, the Codex Leicester was on\ndisplay from 29 October 2018 to 20 January 2019 in Florence at the Aula\nMagliabechiana of the Uffizi.^[16]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of most expensive books and manuscripts\n  * List of works by Leonardo da Vinci\n  * Codex Atlanticus\n  * Codex Arundel\n  * Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Leonardo (da Vinci), Kenneth David Keele, Jane Roberts, Leonardo Da Vinci: Anatomical Drawings from the Royal Library, Windsor Castle, New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1983\n  2. ^ \"$30,802,500 in 1994 \u2192 2022 | Inflation Calculator\".
