The classic,\nutilitarian icons from Windows 98 just look amazing.\n\n### Why are they so good?\n\nRather than some designer\u2019s flashy vision of the future, Windows 98 icons made\nthe operating system feel like a place to get real work done. They had hard\nedges, soft colors and easy-to-recognize symbols.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that the icons were meticulously crafted. Each 256-color .ico\nfile includes a pixel-perfect 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 version that looks\nequally good on the taskbar and desktop.\n\nMaybe its nostalgia, but I still prefer the classic icons of Windows 98 over\nthe shiny, drop-shadowed icons of later years. You can download the entire\nWindows 98 collection of .ico files here.\n\n### Check this out!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking an nostalgic way to scroll through the whole collection of\nWindows 98 icons (including the many icon versions embedded in each ico file),\ncheck out win98icons.alexmeub.com.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Alex Meub\n\n", "frontpage": false}
