Either bend an elbow or bow your head\n(depending on your preferred mode for giving thanks) to Andres Freund, one of\nthe army of volunteers who labor daily, unpaid and largely unrecognized, to\nkeep the world from tipping over.\n\nFreund, a software engineer, last month stumbled on to shenanigans that one\ncybersecurity expert told The New York Times could have been \u201cthe most\nwidespread and effective backdoor ever planted in any software product.\u201d That\nlanguage signals that this is not your usual cybersecurity story. While it is\nanother reminder of the importance of cybersecurity, it also highlights the\nlargely unappreciated central role that open-source software (OSS) plays in\nthe digital economy.\n\nRunning routine checks on a software system, Freund noticed an inexplicable\ndelay in SSH, a protocol that allows remote login to devices over the\ninternet. He discovered that the problem was the result of updates to XZ\nUtils, an open-source data compression utility that runs on virtually every\nLinux system and other Unix-like operating system.\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
