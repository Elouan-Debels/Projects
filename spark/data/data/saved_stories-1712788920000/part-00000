Is a popular software tool to blame?\n\nBig-time apartment owners have a secret weapon: a software that helps property\nmanagers to help them set rents and juice their profits Emrah_Oztas/ Getty\nImage, eGreg Bajor/Getty Image, Aleksey Balatskiy/Getty Image, Cici\nMorosanu/500px/Getty Image, Bus\u00e0 Photography/Getty Image, Abanti Chowdhury/BI\n\nJames Rodriguez\n\n2024-04-10T09:27:01Z\n\nFacebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link\n\nRead in app\n\nHOMEPAGE\n\nNewsletters\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\nLandlords have a lot of built-in leverage over renters. Moving is a pain, so\ntenants are more likely to accept rent hikes. Developing new apartments is\nexpensive and time-consuming, which makes it tough for competitors to enter\nthe market. Even during shaky periods for the economy, rents tend to hold\nsteady or even climb \u2014 people still need to live somewhere.\n\nOver the past few years, the playing field tilted further in favor of\nlandlords. Rents soared thanks to a shortage of apartment units, remote\nworkers' desire for more space, and a daunting for-sale market that kept many\nrenters stuck in place.\n\nBig-time apartment owners, it turns out, also had a secret weapon: a Texas\ncompany called RealPage, which sells software to property managers to help\nthem set rents and juice their profits. Its algorithm tells landlords exactly\nhow much rent they should charge for units in their buildings, based on a\npotent mix of both public and nonpublic data that property owners supply to\nthe company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRealPage openly brags about its ability to help clients \"outpace the market in\ngood times and bad.\" In a new lawsuit against the company, Kris Mayes,\nArizona's attorney general, offered a translation: \"'Outpace' is code for\ncharging higher prices than what would be charged in a market untainted by\ncollusion,\" the complaint reads. \"This is price fixing, and it is illegal.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is one of dozens that accuse RealPage of operating a vast\nconspiracy to overcharge renters via its prized algorithm. Critics say the\ncooperation between RealPage and apartment managers has emboldened landlords\nto raise prices even if it means more units are left empty when tenants are\nforced to leave. Without RealPage, the plaintiffs argue, landlords would be\nhesitant to jack up rents; instead, they'd focus on keeping their buildings\nfull.\n\nThe cases offer a revealing glimpse at how corporate apartment owners rely on\ntechnology to wring every last dollar out of tenants, who often have little\nidea how their rents are calculated or why a double-digit annual percentage\nincrease is justified. But a win for the plaintiffs is far from guaranteed.\nWithout hard evidence of shady dealings in a smoke-filled backroom, they'll\nlikely have to prove that use of the algorithm, and the cooperation it\nfacilitated among apartment-owning competitors, unfairly pushed up prices and\nultimately did more harm than good.\n\nIf the plaintiffs succeed, though, the ripple effects could extend well beyond\nrental housing. Algorithmic, or \"dynamic,\" pricing is used in a wide variety\nof industries, including hospitality, retail, transportation, and\nentertainment. These cases could provide a road map for class-action lawyers\nto target those sectors, too. In short, the lawsuits that started with\napartment rents could one day change how we pay for everything.\n\nRealPage may not be a household name, but if you live in a major US city,\nyou've probably walked past (or lived in) an apartment that had its rent price\nset by the software. Its clients, as of 2020, the last year data was publicly\navailable, included the 10 largest multifamily property-management companies\nin the US. Its suite of services is used to manage more than 24 million units\nworldwide, according to the company's website.\n\nRealPage wields the greatest power in markets with a high concentration of\ncorporate-owned apartments. About 70% of apartment units in the Phoenix\nmetropolitan area are owned or managed by companies that use RealPage for\n\"revenue management,\" the company's term for the price-recommendation software\nthat is now under scrutiny, according to estimates by Arizona's attorney\ngeneral. In Tucson, about half of listed apartments fall under that umbrella.\nThe Washington, DC, attorney general, who has also sued RealPage, said that\nmore than 30% of multifamily units in the district, and 60% of units in\nbuildings with 50 or more units, were priced using RealPage's software.\n\nRealPage and its executives aren't shy about touting the benefits of its\nalgorithm for landlords. A video on its website heralds the software, known\nsimply as \"AI Revenue Management,\" as the \"first pricing-optimization tool to\nfully employ AI and machine learning,\" helping properties \"exceed the market\nby 2% to 5%.\" In other words, the company's clients enjoy revenue increases\nfrom year to year that are greater than the market average. RealPage's\nalgorithm is fueled by troves of granular data on real-time lease\ntransactions, occupancy, and how many units are hitting the market, which\nlandlords feed the company as a condition of using its services. It's unclear\nexactly how the company massages all those numbers to spit out its price\nrecommendations, but RealPage says it aggregates and anonymizes the data from\nother apartment operators in the area and combines it with other public data\nand the property's internal rent data to arrive at a suggested dollar amount.\nIt's \"both common and expected\" that apartment managers will follow the\nsystem's pricing recommendations on roughly 80% to 95% of their decisions,\nRealPage's website says.\n\n> \"It really takes the tenant out of the equation altogether.\"\n\nBy turning over pricing to the algorithm, plaintiffs say, RealPage's clients\nare encouraged to push rents higher than if they'd left the decisions up to\nhumans. You don't have to take their word for it, though \u2014 both the company\nand its users have publicly hailed the software's ability to capture more\nrevenue. \"As a property manager, very few of us would be willing to actually\nraise rents double digits within a single month by doing it manually,\" one\nRealPage executive said in a since deleted video, according to a 2022\ninvestigation by ProPublica. Another apartment manager said in a testimonial\nvideo that the software \"pushes you to go places that you wouldn't have gone\nif you weren't using it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRental prices have shot up by 29.4% since the beginning of the pandemic,\naveraging an annual increase of 7% over the past four years, Zillow found.\nAlmost two-thirds of that increase happened in 2021 alone, the peak of the\npandemic-era housing market. Of course, there were many factors driving up\nrents back then that had nothing to do with algorithms, most notably an\nincrease in household formation \u2014 people broke up with their roommates, moved\nout of their parents' houses, or simply upgraded to more space \u2014 so it's hard\nto know exactly how much to ascribe to the algorithms. But information\nasymmetry is part of the bigger problem. Apartment owners have access to all\nkinds of market data through RealPage's algorithm, while tenants suffer from a\nlack of information \u2014 some can't even figure out who actually owns their\napartment behind a web of LLCs. The plaintiffs allege that RealPage clients\nprovide data to the company knowing that many of their competitors are doing\nthe same and that they would all benefit by participating. In fact, the\nlawsuits claim that RealPage shares \"peer lists\" with clients that tell them\nexactly who else is providing data to the company within a specific distance\nof their property.\n\nAll kinds of other issues crop up when landlords rely on algorithms instead of\nhuman expertise, the plaintiffs say. At least when renters go back and forth\nwith a real human on lease negotiations, there's a chance they could bargain\nthe price down, Marie Claire Tran-Leung, the director of the Evictions\nInitiative Project at the National Housing Law Project, told me. An algorithm\nmay not be so lenient.\n\n\"It really takes the tenant out of the equation altogether,\" Tran-Leung said.\n\nIn the 2009 movie \"The Informant!,\" Matt Damon plays a bumbling white-collar\nworker who tips off the FBI that his company and its competitors are meeting\nto fix prices. The tale is based on a real-life case from the '90s that\noffered up a classic model of collusion, in which executives meet in secret\nand make handshake deals to screw over customers.\n\nAlgorithms aren't so straightforward. There are no smoky rooms, no\nopportunities for a wire-wearing whistleblower to catch the crooks red-handed.\nIn a recent statement of interest in the lawsuits against RealPage, the\nJustice Department referred to algorithms as the \"new frontier\" of price\nfixing, arguing that they posed \"an even greater anticompetitive threat\" than\nanything that had come before. By sharing private information and surrendering\ntheir decision-making to the software, companies are engaging in price-fixing\nbehavior, the department claimed. They don't even have to hold secret\nmeetings; the algorithm does all the heavy lifting.\n\n\"Automating an anticompetitive scheme does not make it less anticompetitive,\"\nthe department's statement said. In 2017, Maureen Ohlhausen, then a\ncommissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, voiced similar concerns about\npricing algorithms.\n\n\"Everywhere the word 'algorithm' appears, please just insert the words 'a guy\nnamed Bob,'\" Ohlhausen said. \"Is it OK for a guy named Bob to collect\nconfidential price-strategy information from all the participants in a market,\nand then tell everybody how they should price? If it isn't OK for a guy named\nBob to do it, then it probably isn't OK for an algorithm to do it, either.\"\n\nThis model of collusion is what experts call a \"hub-and-spoke\" conspiracy \u2014\nthe plaintiffs will argue that RealPage is at the center, or the hub, and the\narrangements with each of its clients are the spokes. The problem for the\nplaintiffs is they also need to show that there's a rim to this wheel: an\nagreement between all the competitors to use the algorithm and pump up their\nprofits. That rim is pretty important; without it, the plaintiffs' case gets a\nlot more difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen CEOs get together and agree to push up prices, the mere act of doing so\nis illegal \u2014 it doesn't matter if they actually pull off the scheme. But with\na rimless hub-and-spoke, the plaintiffs have to prove that each of the\nagreements between RealPage and its clients stifles competition and harms\nconsumers. That's a much higher standard, Ed Rogers, a partner at the law firm\nBallard Spahr who specializes in antitrust cases, told me. To avoid this, the\nplaintiffs will try to establish that a rim does, in fact, exist \u2014 that\napartment managers either agreed with one another to use RealPage to\ncollectively raise prices, or at least used its software knowing and expecting\nthat their competitors would do the same and that they would all benefit by\nparticipating.\n\n> \"Automating an anticompetitive scheme does not make it less\n> anticompetitive.\"\n\nIt's possible to prove a conspiracy with circumstantial evidence, Jeffery\nCross, a partner at the law firm Smith Gambrell Russell, told me. For example,\na court might look at whether apartment owners had strong incentives to\ncollude, whether they knew who else was participating, whether participation\nwas enforced in some way, and whether they all took similar actions at the\nsame time, like raising prices in unison. The judge could also consider\nwhether the competitors knew that the price increases could succeed only if\neveryone did the same. But proving a rim this way is \"much more difficult,\"\nCross said.\n\nRealPage didn't respond to requests for comment, but in a rebuttal to the\nJustice Department's statement of interest, the company said it may recommend\nprice decreases and noted that apartment managers didn't always accept its\nsuggestions. It also said there wasn't enough evidence to prove that the\napartment managers had made a \"conscious commitment\" to engage in an unlawful\nscheme together. In short, no rim.\n\nOf course, RealPage is far from the only reason that rents rose during the\npandemic. And because a ton of new apartment buildings were completed in the\npast couple of years, rents around the country are stagnating or even dropping\nin some areas. But the plaintiffs in these cases still argue that the rental\nmarket would be better for tenants if RealPage didn't exist; if apartment\nowners couldn't lean on the algorithm, they might hold off on rent hikes or\ndrop prices more frequently. They might also be more open to negotiating on\nlease renewals.\n\nBut we have a long way to go before knowing whether these changes will come to\npass. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into RealPage\nand some of its customers, Politico reported, adding to the mounting pressure\non the company and its clients. The lawsuits filed by the Washington, DC, and\nArizona attorneys general will work their way through their respective\njudicial systems, while the federal antitrust cases have been consolidated\nbefore a judge in Tennessee. The first of those cases was filed in 2022, so\nthey're still in the early stages \u2014 it could be years before we even see a\ntrial.\n\nWhenever that day comes, it'll be worth watching. The RealPage cases are about\nfar more than apartment rents. If the plaintiffs can successfully argue that\nproperty managers engaged in price fixing by using RealPage's algorithm, they\ncould open the door for all kinds of industries to face similar scrutiny.\n\nAirlines, for instance, rely heavily on algorithms to price plane tickets, and\nexperts have pointed out that the industry is especially susceptible to\ncollusion because it is dominated by just a handful of major players. The\nFederal Trade Commission has accused Amazon of using a secret algorithm to see\nwhether it could raise prices and prompt other businesses to follow suit. Just\nrecently, the Justice Department and the FTC filed another statement of\ninterest in a case that accuses casino-hotel operators of propping up prices\nby using a common algorithm. The platform in question is called Rainmaker.\n\nJames Rodriguez is a senior reporter on Business Insider's Discourse team.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
