This adjustment will appear on your next\ninvoice on or after April 9th, with no immediate extra charge.\n\nIf you are paying with an alternative method via Paypal, OpenNode, or any\nother non-Stripe provider: You will be prompted to pick a sales tax region the\nnext time you go to purchase credit.\n\nIf you have any questions about this change, please feel free to contact our\nteam through Discord or at support@kagi.com. We will be building an F.A.Q.\npage to answer any questions about the migration process.\n\nTo clarify, it means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT\nwill be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in your\ncountry/state) and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have\nlegal sales tax/VAT obligation. In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively\npay for all sales tax/VAT that we did not collect in the last almost two\nyears. We have chosen to absorb this on behalf of our customers.\n\n### Improvements and bug fixes\n\n  * We made some changes to Kagi-specific bangs: you can access FastGPT through !fgpt and Discuss doc with !discussdoc\n  * LaTeX is not displaying properly #3514 @rourguic\n  * Claude 3 Opus injects random mathematical formulae #3564 @tiltowait\n  * Expert research assistant fails to process request #3566 @frin\n  * Research assistant messes up character spacing unpredictably #3184 @httpjames\n  * Duplicate bang search suggestion #3379 @Value7609\n  * Kagi Quick Answer Mismatch Between Document Number and Source Number #3549 @benoit\n  * UI Bug: Chat Assistant models card has a clipboard icon #3485 @Chris\n  * Maps keeps trying to get a location on every keystroke #3405 @tinkling6961\n  * POST /login returns HTTP 500 Internal Server Error #3526 @pdm\n  * Non-ASCII Wikipedia URL incorrectly encoded #3459 @ThreePointsShort\n  * Kagi Assistant - Text Parsing Issue #3390 @martafolf\n\n## March 12th, 2024 - Enhanced Quick Answer, New Language, and Maps\nImprovements #\n\n### Features\n\n  * We've upgraded the Quick Answer keyboard shortcut.

With this addition you will find additional relevant results about the query you are searching. This feature can be easily enabled / disabled in the Search Settings.\n\n  * We added additional sources for local businesses to our inline maps search results. Inline maps should be more responsive now when searching for specific local businesses. More improvements to come. Related issue: Local business / open hours #2477 @partlycloudy\n\n  * Find hidden treasures from the early days of the web through the new Usenet / Archive search lens\n\n  * Kagi Assistant (available as open beta for Ultimate members) now leverages GPT4-vision model to better understand and describe images. You can test this improved functionality by uploading images or providing image URLs for the Kagi Assistant to analyse.\n\nEdit: A member just emailed saying \"the example you have is wrong about 7 of\nthe 10 \"Key Points\" (only the restaurant name, VAT amount, and amount tendered\nare correct).\" Yes that can be the case with LLMs, we are not trying to\npresent this as grounbreaking, we just integrated a model and the example is\nas good as the underlying model. This is clearly demonstrating its limitations\nand it is what it is. We are currently using the best commercially available\nvision model on the market and it is our desire to emphasize that access to\nthis and other world's cutting edge LLM's are all included in the Assistant\nwith one Kagi subscription. No doubt they will get better in the future.\n\n### Outage post-mortem\n\n  * We've dissected last Thursday's events and the steps we're taking in response in a detailed post-mortem report.

This will come at no additional cost to you.\n\n  * Kagi Assistant usage stats are now on the stats page. Assistant is still in beta and currently available to Ultimate plan users. We plan to roll it out to all members in January. #2141 @Grooty\n\n  * We vastly improved Image search results. Check them here including all the powerful filters.\n\n  * Kagi Search for Safari Extension 2.0 has just launched! We've updated the extension to be cross-platform and rewrote it from scratch for improved reliability, as well as a simpler way to get your Kagi searches going across your macOS and iOS devices, with Apple\u2019s automatic extension state syncing.\n\nExisting users of the iOS Kagi Search for Safari Extension are encouraged to\ninstall the cross-platform version from the App Store to continue receiving\nupdates after the iOS-only extension is delisted (in July 2024). Until that\ntime, the iOS-only extension will continue to receive the same updates and run\nthe same underlying code as the cross-platform extension.\n\nThe migration to the Safari Web Extensions framework will require you to grant\naccess to the Extension on the search engine during your first run. See the\ninstructions in the app for details.\n\nRelease notes for extension:\n\n[Fixed] Redirects should not experience intermittent failures [Changed] You\ncan override which search engine redirects to Kagi manually. The first time\nyou install/upgrade to this version, the extension will attempt to detect your\ncurrent Safari search engine [Changed] You only need to provide extension\naccess to urls on the search engine you are overriding.\n\n### \ud83e\udeb2 Bug fixes & Improvements\n\n  * Clickable anchors in changelog for easy sharing of changelog posts\n  * Added new regional bangs !be_fr, !ca_fr, !ch_fr, !es_ca\n  * Query suggestions are too \"greedy\" #2750 @dcoates\n  * Custom CSS does not apply to the Assistant page. #2534 @Zambyte\n  * Semicolons aren't properly handled in the search results page #2365 @laiz\n  * Kagi search interface no longer works on Firefox ESR #2766 @kagi-not-working\n  * This screen needs to be available on Localazy to be localized #2714 @TheLastEnvoy\n  * !staples search is broken #2772 @sidwolf6583\n  * \"Are you finding this answer useful\" overlay hard to close #2195 @timo\n  * Opening Quick Answer links in another tab #2556 @X145678908765\n  * Paywall indicator in the news tab #2663 @Dumb\n  * Making prorating clearer on the Pricing page #2736 @GrygrFlzr\n  * Page redirects / regexes don't get applied to quick answer citations #2389 @xhat\n  * Allow Quick Bangs at end of query #1434 @macro\n  * Improved forgot password & reset password errors\n  * Fixed missing HN and Reddit comments on posts\n\n### Assistant\n\n  * Faster assistant responses (over 100 tok/sec for gpt-3.5-turbo)\n\n  * Improvements to Fast Research assistant\n\n  * Assistant on iOS and iPadOS, safari or orion, requires reload after question is posed #2776 @stoyle\n\n### Happy holidays from the Kagi team!\n\nThank you for supporting us in this amazing year.
