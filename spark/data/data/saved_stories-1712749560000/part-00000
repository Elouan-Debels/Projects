Great learning material for machine learning is licensed under a\nCreative Commons license. For starters but also people who are already more\nfamiliar with the key concepts.\n\nThis section presents an opinionated list of great machine learning learning\nresources. A lot of garbage is produced on the internet and even paid courses\nare often not that good.\n\nThis list consist of very readable references and some great hands-on courses.\nOnly resources that are real open, so resources published using a Creative\nCommons license (cc-by mostly) or other types of real open licensed material\nis included.\n\nMost learning resources include hands-on tutorials. So be ready to learn how\nto use a notebook, but most tutorials offer notebooks ready to use.\n\nEveryone in the world should have access to high-quality machine learning\nresources. This to empower Free and Open Machine Learning.\n\nThis list of open (Creative Commons licensed ) machine learning training\nresources contains resources for starters who never want to do \u2018hands-on\u2019.\nOpenness for knowledge sharing means no user registration to read or play with\nthe material is required.\n\nTip\n\nNever stop learning!\n\nDive into Deep Learning\n\nInteractive deep learning book with code, math, and discussions.
