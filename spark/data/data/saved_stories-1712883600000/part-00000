In this Perspective, we argue that the evidence that\nsupports these domain-specific theories is confounded by general information-\nprocessing differences. We argue that human uniqueness arises through genetic\nquantitative increases in the global capacity to process information and share\nit among systems such as memory, attention and learning. This change explains\nregularities across numerous subdomains of cognition, behavioural comparisons\nbetween species and phenomena in child development. This strict evolutionary\ncontinuity theory of human intelligence is consistent with comparative\nevidence about neural evolution and computational constraints of memory on the\nability to represent rules, patterns and abstract generalizations. We show how\nthese differences in the degree of information processing capacity yield\ndifferences in kind for human cognition relative to other animals.\n\nDownload PDF\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Kea show three signatures of domain-general statistical inference\n\nArticle Open access 03 March 2020\n\nAmalia P.

Deary\n\n## Introduction\n\nOne of the deepest mysteries about cognition is how human thought differs from\nthat of humanity\u2019s close primate relatives. This question targets the core of\nhuman nature itself, simultaneously pointing backwards to the evolution of\nnatural intelligence and forwards to the likely mechanisms needed to make\nartificial intelligence.\n\nThe theories that have gained the most traction in the study of human\nuniqueness tend to be \u2018silver bullet\u2019 hypotheses that posit a single, specific\nadaptation or \u2018instinct\u2019 \u2014 such as social reasoning or hierarchical syntax \u2014\nas the central catalyst of human-like thought^1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Such domain-\nspecific theories have largely dominated the field\u2019s hypothesis space. These\ntheories tend to propose domain-specific or modular adaptations that are\ninnate in humans and arose uniquely in human evolution.\n\nAlternatives to a domain-specific evolutionary story have not reached a\nconsensus on a general cognitive mechanism or biological basis for what is\nunique about humans^9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. However, several newer\ntheories of human uniqueness suggest a shift towards more general learning\nadaptations^12,13,19,20,21,22. These theories vary in how much innate\nstructure they assume, from very little to a lot^23. One class of theories\nthat sometimes emphasizes the general cognitive origins of human intelligence\nis the cultural intelligence hypothesis^13,19,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33.\nThe cultural intelligence hypothesis suggests that humans stand out among\nanimal species due to their unique social learning ability and the\naccumulation of cultural knowledge it affords. Some variations of this\nhypothesis emphasize the role of purportedly innate, domain-specific\nmechanisms such as joint attention, theory of mind, language and imitation,\nwhereas others emphasize the importance of global increases in general\ncognition such as the innovation rate^26 and flexibility^13. Even cultural\nintelligence theories that posit innate adaptations to human social learning\nagree that domain-general learning and memory do much of the heavy lifting in\nthe assimilation of new, unique human knowledge^12,31,33.\n\nHowever, all these theories are inadequate for explaining in detail how humans\nexcel at the diversity of tasks they do, and therefore fail to explain how\nunique capabilities emerge in humans. We argue that the differences between\nhuman and non-human primates are not due to one specialized cognitive\nadaptation or even a bunch of them. Instead, human uniqueness largely results\nfrom a global adaptation for increased information processing capacity, which\nalters human cognition profoundly and qualitatively. Information processing\ncapacity refers to the amount of information^34,35 per unit time that can be\nstored and transmitted between cognitive mechanisms or subsystems.\n\nIn this Perspective, we propose that global, genetic differences in learning\nand memory are sufficient to account for uniquely human capacities across\ndomains. We begin by detailing silver-bullet theories, cultural intelligence\ntheories and our information capacity theory. We then review evidence for the\ninformation capacity theory by examining three major predictions: continuity\nof ability across species; differences in capacity limitations across species;\nand qualitative changes in ability enabled by quantitative changes in\ncapacity. We discuss information capacity across human and non-human species\nand explore capacity limitations in learning models and mathematical analyses.\nWe conclude that information capacity is a key determinant of human uniqueness\nbecause it determines which rules and representations can be learned by\nspecies across a range of domains.\n\nFunctional specializations within species preclude a unitary definition of\nintelligence across species (Box 1). Differences in intelligence between\nspecies might not be driven by the same parameters as differences within a\nspecies \u2014 we make no argument about differences within a species in the\ncurrent Perspective. The definition of human intelligence specifically is also\na matter of debate, but the term \u2018intelligence\u2019 is often used to refer to\nabilities that psychologists have identified as distinctive in humans \u2014\ncapacities such as language, recursion, theory of mind, massive memory,\nlogical and relational reasoning, complex tool use and rich conceptual\nsystems.\n\n### Box 1 Biological basis of information capacity differences\n\nAddressing unique cognitive processes requires considering biological\nimplementation. Unlike alternative theories, the theory that increased\ninformation capacity caused human intelligence has a plausible biological\nmechanism underlying human cognitive abilities and satisfies key criteria for\na cause for intelligent behaviour in biological theory (such as Tinbergen\u2019s\nquestions^273). Species differences in information capacity are innate and\nrooted in their embryonic biology.\n\nFunctional specialization is a fact of species evolution^274. Species\ndifferences in sensorimotor cortices firmly establish functional\nspecializations that readily differentiate, for example, a bat from a possum\nfrom a primate. However, qualitative differences between humans and apes are\nmuch less profound^275,276. Instead, there are well-known adaptive advantages\nto generalized increases in neural tissue for cognitive plasticity that drive\nunique cognitive abilities in humans.\n\nMammal and bird species with larger brains relative to their body size are\nmore successful at surviving in novel environments than species with smaller\nbrains^30. This pattern suggests that increased brain size provides a fitness\nbenefit in vertebrates^26, and implicates a global implementation of human\nadvantages in cognition. Brain size in humans is expanded across most cortical\nregions relative to other primates^277,278. Even the prefrontal cortex, which\nwas once thought to be qualitatively distinct in humans, seems to have\nexpanded largely quantitatively relative to chimpanzees^275,276.\n\nThe number of cortical neurons is related to information processing capacity,\nand can predict general cognitive abilities across species, such as the\nability to control prepotent responses or make precise quantitative\njudgements^180,184,279,280. The number of neurons is genetically determined,\nset before birth for each species by the size of their neural progenitor pool\nand duration of cortical neurogenesis^280,281,282,283,284, and is therefore a\nlikely substrate for adaptation^285. Humans have an extended period of\ncortical neurogenesis during prenatal development compared with other\nprimates^280,281,283,284,285,286,287. Extended cortical neurogenesis probably\nincreases neural density in human cortex generally, although it might be more\nlikely to increase frontal density than posterior density because\nprolongations are more efficiently implemented there within the developmental\nschedule^281. Prior theories argued that human prefrontal cortex underwent\nspecial expansion relative to other brain regions for functionally specific\nreasons (for instance, cognitive control^14). But prefrontal expansion seems,\ninstead, a continuation of a new allometric trend, a yoked scaling between\nbrain parts, that began in a more distant ancestor shared with other apes^277,\nand might be a consequence of general selection for neural density under the\nease of embryonic rostral\u2013caudal neurogenesis rather than specific functional\nselection for a frontal cognitive process.\n\nAlthough there is growing genetic evidence in favour of species-specific\ncircuits for general learning and motivation^281, there is no parallel\nevidence for circuits supporting purported silver bullets of human uniqueness,\nincluding language, theory of mind, cheater detection or relational reasoning.\nIn fact, genetic evidence for these domain-specific theories, such as\npredicted differences between identical versus fraternal twins or predicted\ntask-specific correlations with genes, does not bear out in the data^13. More\nbroadly, there are no theories for how new genetic cognitive modules such as\nthese would arise, nor how they would have arisen in humans alone. Finally,\nexisting theories of human uniqueness cannot explain why corvids perform so\nsimilarly to non-human primates on many tasks^288. By contrast, the\ninformation capacity theory easily explains this as the result of similar\nneural densities between corvids and primates that afford similar flexibility\nand learning rates^289,290.\n\nEvolutionary theories of human intelligence that take the chimpanzee mind as a\nstarting point and factor the effects of scaling-up on cognition are grounded\nin genetic physiology. The information capacity theory proposes that increased\nneural and glial density, determined by the size of the neural progenitor pool\nat birth, qualitatively improves cognition. A plausible pathway to human\nuniqueness is one in which genetic changes in the human brain increase neural\ndensity quantitatively, which leads to exponential increases in information\nprocessing capacity, and results in conceptual learning leaps during child\ndevelopment that are unseen in other primates. This theory provides a more\nstraightforward account of cognitive evolution by natural selection and\npredicts the unmistakable biological continuity between primate and human\nbrains.\n\n## Theories of human uniqueness\n\nDomain-specific theories have dominated the theory space around human\nuniqueness for decades and are still influential in more expansive modern\ntheories of human cognitive origins^1,18. The domain-specific focus on human\norigins has generated many different silver-bullet proposals. Silver-bullet\ntheories of human cognition are often derived from sociobiological^36,37 or\nadaptationist theories of human behaviour^1,38,39 but they also stem from\ncounter-behaviourist theories about human cognition^40 and from even earlier\ntheories of biological preparedness that helped to spawn the cognitive\nrevolution^23,41. Some evolutionary frameworks propose that human behaviour is\nlargely influenced by genetically specialized cognitive functions^1,18,42,43,\nwhereas others propose much less innate structure^23,31. Many of the\nhypothetical human-specific adaptations that various researchers propose are\nin the social cognitive domain, including cheater detection^2, theory of\nmind^44,45, imitation^46 and joint attention^47, whereas others are abstract\ncomputations such as symbolic geometry^3,48,49, recursion^50,51, relational\nreasoning^52 and language grammar^39,53,54,55.\n\nSilver-bullet theories face multiple logical challenges in explaining the wide\nrange of behaviours that set humans apart from other primates. One is that the\nkey behaviours that set humans apart from other primates \u2014 behaviours such as\nlanguage, mathematics, logical reasoning, complex social structures, tools and\ntechnology \u2014 generally must be acquired. Although each behaviour undoubtedly\nrelies on some innate machinery, the specific representations that adults\npossess in any of these domains seem to be fairly unconstrained and critically\nunknown to the youngest human learners. A second problem is that the\ndistinctively human domains are remarkably diverse in the representations and\nprocesses they require: a silver bullet for language is unlikely to be a\nsilver bullet for mathematics or logic, much less for social reasoning and\ntool use. Researchers in these domains have tended to highlight their own area\nas the critical special one, while failing to account for uniquely human\nabilities in the others. Finally, each theory of human uniqueness posits that\na different cognitive representation was the silver bullet, but they cannot\nall be the unique key piece. This observation has led some theorists to\nconclude that perhaps there was no single adaptation that led to human\nuniqueness but, rather, a patchwork of multiple specific adaptations^18.\nHowever, a theory that post hoc posits evolutionary change in each domain\nlacks predictive power and parsimony because it has an unprincipled and\nunlimited attribution of unique adaptations for unique behaviours. More\nimportantly, a patchwork adaptation theory contradicts the constituent domain-\nspecific theories that form the patchwork, each of which maintains that humans\nare superior to non-human primates in one domain but ordinary in other\ndomains^56.\n\nAlthough some silver-bullet studies claim to disprove more general\nexplanations of differences between humans and non-human primates, the pattern\nthat emerges across studies is that humans differ in general ways from non-\nhuman primates, across many domains and cognitive processes. Human advantages\nextend beyond any one process or ability into basic object memory, semantic\nmemory, set and sequence memory, memory duration, cognitive control and simple\nlearning rates \u2014 differences in these general cognitive functions are not\npredicted by domain-specific theories.\n\nTheories that attribute human uniqueness to domain-general adaptations, such\nas the cultural intelligence hypothesis, tend to focus on evolutionarily new\ngeneral-purpose neural functions and structures^57, such as \u2018quantum leaps\u2019 in\nadaptive specializations^58, cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex^59,60,\nadaptations for abstraction^52 and other evolutionary discontinuities^18.\nThese theories propose an evolutionary discontinuity between humans and non-\nhuman primates. There is general agreement among cultural intelligence\ntheories that humans are unique in their social learning abilities, which\nenhance human cognition through the accumulation of knowledge in\nculture^18,19. Some cultural theories effectively propose silver bullets by\nemphasizing innate, domain-specific mechanisms such as joint attention, theory\nof mind, language and imitation as key catalysts for human\nuniqueness^18,28,31,32,33,46. Other theories emphasize expansions in general\ncognitive mechanisms such as learning, memory and executive function as the\nevolutionary foundation of human innovation, complex communication and\nflexibility^13,17,25,26,61,62,63. These latter theories show that global\nincreases in general cognition are adaptive and hypothesize that general\ncognitive processes ratchet up unique cognitive abilities that define humans\nthrough adaptations and environmental opportunities for social learning.\nHowever, none of these prior theories explain how general capacities benefit\nuniquely human cognitive abilities.\n\nBy contrast, we propose that a uniquely human genetic change in global\ninformation capacity, implemented computationally as an increased bit rate and\nbiologically as increased cortical density, is powerful enough to yield all of\nthe qualitative differences between human and non-human cognition. Thus, our\nidea differs from other domain-general theories because it is a strict\ncontinuity theory of the evolution of human uniqueness. Our theory is\nsynergistic with versions of the cultural intelligence hypothesis that propose\nevolutionary expansions in learning and memory as a key source of human\nuniqueness^13,29,30. It builds on constructivist theories of conceptual change\nin childhood^64,65,66 and complements facets of the cultural intelligence\nhypothesis that emphasize the uniqueness of learning inputs during human\ndevelopment^12,19,31. Our hypothesis expands those prior ideas by offering a\ncognitive explanation for how so many qualitatively new types of cognition\ncould emerge in humans through simple, quantitative changes in their global\ninformation capacity over evolution.\n\nWe focus on how human cognition is unique at the cognitive algorithmic level.\nHowever, information capacity constrains cognitive systems because neural\nenergy is required to represent information and transform it\ncomputationally^67,68. The key for human-like cognition is that all neural\nsystems must work together \u2014 improvements in social reasoning or tool use will\nnot help much unless information in these systems can be conveyed to systems\nfor learning, memory and inference. In turn, learned and inferred\nrepresentations guide systems for perception and interface tightly with memory\narchitecture. Increased global information capacity would not only be\nadvantageous but perhaps also essential for any expansion of cognitive\nfaculties in human evolution, ensuring that enhancements in one domain could\nbe effectively integrated and utilized across the cognitive system. This\nmutualistic, integrative view directly engages the evolutionary reality of\nhuman uniqueness in global neural density, the behavioural predictiveness of\nsuch neural measures across species, and the likely ease with which general\ninformation capacity parameters are changed genetically in evolution (Box 1).\n\nOur theory yields three concrete predictions. First, it predicts some degree\nof success for all species even in domains that are argued to reflect unique\nhuman ability. To address this prediction, we review the comparative cognitive\nand child development literature, demonstrating a continuity of success across\nhumans and non-human animals. Second, the theory predicts quantifiable\ndifferences between humans and other species on basic information processing\nmeasures. To this end, we review literature documenting predictable and\nsystematic performance gaps between species across most cognitive tasks,\nincluding simple memory and learning paradigms. Last, our account predicts\nthat small changes in information capacity could yield big, qualitative\nchanges in behaviour. We present mathematical analysis, machine learning\nmodels and cognitive models for which capacity constraints have profound\nconsequences.\n\n## Continuity of ability across species\n\nThe first prediction of the information capacity theory is that non-human\nspecies will exhibit some degree of success on cognitive tests argued to\ncapture the key to human uniqueness. Relational reasoning, social reasoning,\ncausal reasoning and tools, and symbolic thought and language have been the\nfocus of major silver-bullet theories (Table 1). We discuss each of these\ndomains in turn and show how evidence in each supports our first prediction of\npartial success by non-human primates.\n\nTable 1 Domains of human uniqueness\n\nFull size table\n\n### Social reasoning\n\nMultiple silver-bullet theories posit social reasoning as the key to human\nuniqueness, claiming that one or a few social computations that humans engage\nin are genetic adaptations^8,33,42,46,56,69,70,71. One long-standing\nhypothesis is that human intelligence was sparked by \u2018theory of mind\u2019\nabilities^56,72,73, or the capacity to predict behaviour based on knowledge\nthat another being has a mind. Some theorists even argue that theory of mind\nis an innate module^44,45. One problem with the notion of theory of mind as an\ninnate human adaptation is that its emergence in childhood depends on\nexperience and its learning trajectories are gradual and vary widely^8.\nGeneral cognitive capacities such as working memory and relational reasoning\nincrease with age and, along with the variability in the frequency of social\nlearning input, result in gradual and variable age-related development of\ntheory of mind in humans.\n\nNon-human animals can reason about the mental states of others, including\ngoals, views and actions. The difference in social reasoning between humans\nand other species lies in the breadth and depth of how it is deployed across\ncontexts and complex tasks^74,75,76. For instance, similar to young human\nchildren, non-human animals possess shallow knowledge about agents that is\nlinked to concrete features of the world rather than internal states such as\ndeception, ignorance or surprise^77.\n\nNon-human primates have demonstrated all cognitive constructs thought to be\nessential to human social intelligence and uniquely human: theory of\nmind^75,78,79,80,81, imitation^82,83, gaze following^84, joint\nattention^85,86, teaching^87,88, helping^89,90 and cooperation^91. These\nfindings demonstrate that humans and non-human primates share substantial\nsocial cognitive continuity.\n\nThe difference between humans and non-human primates is often one of\ndegree^8,80,92,93. For example, a study of imitation found that some\nchimpanzees and capuchin monkeys could socially learn one-stage and two-stage\npuzzle box behaviours but that only human children (aged 3\u20134 years) imitated\nand modelled the longer and more complex three-stage solutions to the puzzle\nbox task^94. The degree of complexity also influences social reasoning in\nchimpanzees during teaching behaviours^85. These findings indicate that the\namount of information processing demand causes species differences in social\nlearning.\n\nAlthough most theorists think that human social cognition is rooted in\ndiscontinuous cognitive \u2018traits\u2019^95, another way to see theory of mind is as a\ncontinuum from basic action prediction to complex belief attribution^96, or\nfrom shallow reasoning based on representing others\u2019 knowledge to abstract\nreasoning based on inferred beliefs^97,98. Children and non-human primates are\noften characterized as able to reason about rational action or behaviour and\nadult humans about mental states^93,96,99. Differences in complexity and\nabstractness between human and non-human social reasoning imply a bottleneck\nthat is quantitative rather than trait-based or qualitative^100.\n\nMany cultural intelligence theories emphasize social learning specifically as\na key source of human and non-human differences in social\ncognition^13,19,20,21. For instance, biological preparedness accounts focus on\nbiases in shared mechanisms as the hypothetical locus of genetic differences\nbetween humans and other species^101. These theories emphasize innate biases\nsuch as prosociality in mechanisms such as attention and motivation. There are\nclear differences in successes and failures on social learning tasks between\nhuman children and non-human primates^19. But the innate biases have a\ncomparatively small role in those differences because their function is\nprimarily to alter the frequency of encountering different learning inputs \u2014\nwhich means that the bulk of human uniqueness arises from learning.\nImportantly, non-human primates cannot acquire abilities at the level of a\nhuman child even when their environment offers higher frequencies of direct\nsocial input. This difference means that there is something critical in the\nlearning component of social learning that differs between humans and non-\nhumans beyond innate biases in sociality. Learning rates are constrained by\ninformation capacity, and because social learning occurs by observation it\nrequires the ability to learn passively and on someone else\u2019s schedule and\npace, which makes social learning more demanding than individual learning.\nAlthough learning rates for individual versus social learning conditions are\nrarely compared between species, we suggest that the time course of social\nlearning required to attain human-like characteristics is outside the learning\ncapacity for non-human primates on many tasks. Thus, information capacity\ncould have a causal role in determining the successes and failures of social\nlearning across species.\n\n### Relational reasoning\n\nOther silver-bullet theories suggest that human uniqueness rests on forms of\nnon-social reasoning such as the proposed \u2018super-module\u2019 of relational\nreasoning^52,102. Relational reasoning requires deep logical representations \u2014\nminimally, it requires comparing two relations across four entities, a\nquaternary representation. For instance, relational reasoning is involved in\ncomparing one relation with another, such as knowing that the relationship\nbetween the concept of a dog as it relates to a doghouse and a bird as it\nrelates to a birdhouse is the same.\n\nMany species form common class and category concepts but often fail at tasks\nrequiring reasoning about relations between relations^103,104,105. Both non-\nhuman primates and children younger than 5 years of age often fail at these\ntasks^68,103. Some researchers have argued that they can succeed only if given\na symbol to represent the relation (such as the word \u2018same\u2019 for children)^103.\nConsistent with this account, children younger than 4 years of age succeed at\nrelational tasks only when given relational labels, whereas children older\nthan 4 years of age spontaneously succeed \u2014 presumably because older children\nhave acquired the necessary relational labels^65,106,107.\n\nIf there is a continuity of ability across human children and non-human\nprimates, then providing similar symbols to non-human primates should enable\nthem to succeed at more complex relational reasoning. Indeed, chimpanzees\nprovided with symbols (language or shape tokens) succeed at quaternary\nrelational tasks^105,108,109,110. The pattern that only \u2018apes with symbols\u2019\nsucceed at relational reasoning tasks suggests that tokens of some sort are\nthe key to comparing relations. However, there are exceptions to this\ngeneralization^111,112,113. For instance, corvids (birds with similar neural\ndensities to monkeys) can succeed at relational matching tasks (distinguishing\nsame and different entities) involving shape, colour or size^113. However,\napes and bonobos succeed more readily than corvids on the same task, and\ncomparably with a 3-year-old child^111. These latter findings indicate that\nrelational reasoning is not uniquely human or strictly language-dependent \u2014 it\ncan be learned by non-humans and is influenced by general capacities such as a\nspecies\u2019 learning rate.\n\nOverall, a strict version of the hypothesis that the presence of relational\nreasoning in humans distinguishes them from other species is probably not\ncorrect. Instead, humans might have an easier time processing relations, in\npart, due to the power of language to package concepts into lighter-weight\nmental representations, or chunks. Another important component is likely to be\nhumans\u2019 greater general information processing capacity, which can also\ncontribute to effective management of the informational demands of quaternary\ncomparison. Humans\u2019 higher capacity for relational reasoning probably has\nbroad applications across domains, including supporting sophisticated concepts\nin social and physical settings.\n\n### Causal reasoning and tools\n\nCapacities in causal reasoning have also been posited as the silver bullet of\nhuman uniqueness. Humans\u2019 causal reasoning is linked to exceptional\nexploitation of the environment, such as tool use and novel foraging\nbehaviours such as armed hunting and farming^18. Although some non-human\nprimate species can use tools^114, identify useful tools^115 and create\ntools^116, humans have the ability to create a much higher number of novel\ntools^18,117.\n\nNon-human species that create tools \u2014 such as rooks, ravens, crows, capuchins\nand chimpanzees \u2014 often have limited repertoires of one to a few types of\ntools, whereas humans have larger repertoires by the time they are 5 years\nold^118,119,120,121,122. Chimpanzees have the largest tool repertoires among\nnon-human species and can use around 20 different tools^123. Human children\nhave large tool repertoires, which they initially learn from observing\nexperienced teachers, but by age 7\u20138 years they go further and begin creating\ntools^117.\n\nNon-human primates have limited insight, breadth and generalization of even\nsimple causal relations^115,122,124, which probably constrains their tool use.\nIn the tube-trap task, in which a target object must be removed from a tube by\nusing a probe while avoiding trap obstacles, non-human animals show a lack of\ninsight and minimal causal generalization when presented with novel but\nsimilar tubes. Rooks and chimpanzees show near-transfer to new similar tube\ntraps after learning to solve the original tube, but not far-transfer to\nvisually distinct tubes^122,125. Minor tweaks to tube-trap apparatuses can\nhelp non-human primate performance and non-humans, particularly apes and\ncorvids, solve these simple tool-use tasks similarly to children who are\nyounger than 5 years old. Specifically, young children and non-human primates\ncan make some simple causal inferences about traps but often revert to narrow\nassociative reasoning such as side biases that do not generalize to novel\ntasks^126. However, as children approach 4\u20135 years of age, they quickly\nacquire broad causal knowledge of tube-trap tasks and generalize to rotated\nand reconfigured tubes^127. Older children and adults not only learn\naction\u2013object associations during tool use but make broad causal inferences\nthat generalize to other tasks. The presence of some successful learning and\ngeneralization in non-human animals implies that causal reasoning is not\nentirely absent^126. Rather, differences in learning and generalization\nbetween humans and non-human animals could be caused by the amount of\ninformation required to solve a physical problem. The types of causal concepts\nand tool-use routines that non-human primates and other animals learn are\nprobably shorter, simpler and less enduring than those of humans.\n\nTool use in non-human species often involves a single object impacting another\nobject but rarely requires multiple objects organized into an action\nhierarchy. The integration of multiple objects and actions into a behaviour is\nrare in non-human species^11. Although some species use objects in binary\ncombinations, such as hitting a nut with a stone, non-human tool use lacks\nnested subassembly routines, which are observed frequently in human\nbehaviour^11. For example, field data show that non-human animals do not\nfrequently implement hierarchical action routines where one tool is used to\nmake another tool^11. These patterns suggest that the limitations that non-\nhuman animals face in causal reasoning are quantitative ones in the breadth\nand depth of action abstraction, and the number of nested levels of\nsubroutines. These quantitative limitations are plausibly explained by\ndifferences in information capacity.\n\n### Symbolic thought and language\n\nMany theories of human uniqueness centre on language, but the specific\nevolutionary changes responsible for this ability are debated. Some theorists\nhave suggested that recursion is the defining element of uniquely human\nlanguage^11,50,51,128. Although the most prominent recent proposal^51 does not\ndefine the term, the example given by these authors was sentential embedding,\nthe ability to take a sentence S (such as \u2018It is raining\u2019) and put it inside\nanother sentence, such as \u2018Mary thinks that S\u2019 (\u2018Mary thinks that it is\nraining\u2019)^51. This capacity presumably provides the ability to build complex,\nhierarchical expressions that are predicated on other complex expressions.\nDespite the importance of recursion, humans face a limit of two levels of\nrecursive embedding in certain constructions, struggling to understand\nsentences such as \u2018The senator the chef the mouse saw attacked\nlaughed\u2019^129,130. Additionally, not all human languages use sentential\nembedding^131,132,133, and it has been argued that relatively little daily\nlanguage use involves recursive capacity^134,135. These discrepancies\nchallenge the notion that recursion broadly is the keystone of human-like\nthought.\n\nA revised proposal is that the relevant sense of recursion for human\nuniqueness is the capacity to unboundedly put two arbitrary elements together\ninto a new unit^136,137,138,139. For example, the sentence \u2018Wendy ate\nmarshmallows\u2019 is recursive in this sense because it has three words. An\noperation that can only put two words together at a time must therefore\noperate multiple times on these words, including on its own output. For\nexample, most theories assume the verb and object are combined into a new\nunit, {ate, marshmallows}, and then that unit is combined recursively with the\nsubject to form {Wendy, {ate, marshmallows}}.\n\nThis idea critically relies on the assumption that even simple sentences\ninvolve underlying binary structures. Some theorists have argued that binary\nstructure building is the simplest computational operation^55, the key to\nhuman thought and language^53, and the result of a single mutation leading to\na rapid evolutionary change^140. However, this proposal has been critiqued\nlogically and in evolutionary models^141,142. For instance, there are\nproperties of language that cannot be explained by minimal change to enable\nrecursive structure building, including features that are useful in\ncommunication, even when only partially present^6. Communicative properties of\nhuman language tie it to animal communication systems in that they suggest\ncontinuity in the evolution of language, driven by the pressures of usage,\nrather than genetically determined discontinuity^143,144. Such communicative\nexplanations in linguistics have found empirical support across linguistic\nsubdomains^145,146,147,148,149, often showing how information-theoretic or\nusage-based constraints shape the form of linguistic systems^150.\n\nMore generally, the existence of innate grammatical constraints \u2014 recursive\nstructure building or others \u2014 is widely contested^151,152,153,154. It has\nbeen argued that, essentially, none of the key properties of language\npreviously suggested to be universal across human groups actually are^155.\n\nInstead of language-specific adaptations, the human capacity for representing\nand synthesizing large amounts of information might yield more complex,\nhierarchical patterns of thought. Humans tend to attribute tree-like\nstructures to data^156,157: people across ages and cultures generalize\nambiguous data hierarchically. In one study, Indigenous Amazonian adults,\nAmerican adults, American children and non-human primates (macaques) were\ntaught sequences of symbols^158. All humans tended to generalize to novel\ncombinations of the learned symbols hierarchically rather than using an\nordinal strategy, even though either strategy was consistent with the training\ndata. Macaques only used a hierarchical strategy with additional training,\nsuggesting that hierarchical generalization was not out of reach for them but\nwas a weaker bias. Children\u2019s use of a hierarchical strategy in this task was\npredicted by their working memory capacity, suggesting that the development of\nhierarchical reasoning is gradual and limited by information capacity.\nCorvids, a family of birds with similar neural densities to primates, perform\nat least as well as macaques on the same task, further highlighting continuity\nbetween humans and the rest of the animal kingdom in the capacity to\ngeneralize hierarchically^159. These data that show some success for non-human\nspecies on hierarchical tasks, and specifically for species with high\ninformation processing capacity, implicate a more general origin story for\nrecursion in humans that does not depend on specific adaptations for language.\n\nA general problem for language-based theories of human uniqueness is that they\nare at odds with the continuity between humans and non-human animals in many\naspects of language learning^160. Non-human animals can learn hundreds of\nwords and symbols, generate strings and comprehend basic\nsyntax^158,161,162,163,164,165. Baboons show expectations about some aspects\nof semantics in word learning tasks^166 and exhibit some capacity for\ncompositionality^167. A trained bonobo (Kanzi) could comprehend sentences and\ndifferentiate them, but had limited capacity with coordinate noun phrases and\na shorter mean utterance length than a 2-year-old human child^164. Although\nthese differences are sometimes interpreted as evidence of a unique human\ngenetic adaptation for grammar, they could also reflect quantitative\ndifferences in abilities that snowballed into qualitative ones. For instance,\ninsufficient capacity to deal with parts of a phrase can impair one\u2019s access\nto the hierarchical structure of sentences, regardless of a grammar-specific\nadaptation.\n\nGeneral computations related to language and symbolic structures have also\nbeen proposed as uniquely human. Humans show fluent learning of symbolic\nmental algorithms and procedures^3,48, including advantages over non-human\nprimates in domains such as geometry^49. However, it is unclear what class of\nalgorithms other species are capable of acquiring and whether their\nlimitations are due to memory or underlying algorithmic competence (Box 1).\nIndeed, the question of uniquely human language abilities might not even make\nsense if underlying memory capacities differ between species.\n\nInformational limits are a known constraint on language learning and might be\ncritical in how children acquire language^168. However, non-human primates\nface more drastic information limits. For instance, non-human primates\u2019\ninability to learn human-like language has been attributed to their\ndifficulties learning and remembering even lexical items^169. Similarly,\nhumans are thought to uniquely possess the ability to learn massive numbers of\narbitrary symbols; human knowledge of tens of thousands of arbitrary word\nmeanings contrasts greatly with the few dozen calls known to non-human\nprimates^170. Many accounts of human language emphasize the role of memorized\nstructures or chunks (rather than a small set of syntactic rules) in\ndetermining linguistic competence^171,172. Human learners acquire, on average,\n2,000 bits of information per day about word meanings, from birth to\nadulthood^173 \u2014 a monumental feat of memory with probably no parallel in\nanimal cognition.\n\nInformation capacity constrains the ability to learn language but language\nalso enhances information capacity once learned. The cognitive changes\nassociated with symbolic representation are believed to be profound.\nCompositionality enables new conceptual structures and information transfer\nbetween domains^174 and grammar provides an \u201cendless compacting of information\nlimited only by human memory\u201d^175 akin to hierarchical organization for memory\nor concepts^176. Words provide a handle on complex meanings^177. For instance,\nthe word \u2018hundred\u2019 does not need be broken down into \u2018ten tens\u2019^178 and the\nword \u2018aunt\u2019 need not be broken down into its component defining relations to\naccess these meanings. This synergistic relationship between symbols and\ninformation capacity is not unique to humans. For example, as described above,\nchimpanzees trained with symbols for \u2018same\u2019 and \u2018different\u2019 learned to reason\nabout relations between relations more easily than those without symbol\ntraining \u2014 showing clear benefits of symbols for complex rule learning even in\nnon-human primates^105,110,111.\n\nWe conclude that human uniqueness in symbolic thought and language lies not in\nan exclusive adaptation for grammar but, rather, in humans\u2019 extraordinary\ncapacity to manage vast quantities of information. Non-human animals have\ndemonstrated their ability to learn words, construct sequences and grasp basic\nsyntax to a certain extent, challenging the notion of exclusive grammar\nadaptations in humans. What truly sets humans apart is their unparalleled\ninformation capacity and their ability to transcend information limits in\nlanguage acquisition. Unlike any other species, humans possess remarkable\nlearning and retention of an extensive array of symbols and rules. Once\nacquired, language serves as a powerful tool for expanding information\ncapacity. This synergy between symbols and information is observed in symbol-\ntrained chimpanzees, suggesting that successfully acquired symbols benefit\nreasoning in other animals too, but the outcome of this synergy is amplified\nin humans because they store more symbols, including symbols upon symbols in\nrecursive structures.\n\n## Species differences in capacity\n\nThe second major prediction of our information capacity theory is that human\nand non-human primate species differ in their general information capacity. We\npredict that species will differ on basic, domain-general cognitive tasks\ninvolving general learning and memory.\n\nAll domains that are purported to define human uniqueness \u2014 including complex\nrelational concepts such as social relations, mind\u2013behaviour relations,\nanalogies, rule induction and grammar \u2014 are probably constrained by more\nfundamental domain-general limitations on information capacity. Human adults\nare also subject to limitations on information capacity (Box 2). Cognitive\ninformation processing capacities such as learning rate, attention, memory and\ncontrol vary greatly across species^10,14,29,58,179,180,181,182,183,184,185.\nSuch differences feed into every other cognitive process, with the consequence\nthat performance on any task requiring learning, attention, memory or\ncognitive control will differ across species because of those underlying\nconstraints. It is therefore hard to posit fundamental representational\ndifferences in any individual task without accounting for global informational\nfactors. Moreover, such differences feed into learning, which can amplify the\ndifferences: animals use informational capacities adaptively to learn new\nthings and therefore some species might end up with fundamentally different\nrepresentations because of their information capacity rather than domain-\nspecific factors. Four key domain-general capacities are particularly relevant\nto cross-species comparisons: simple learning rates, simple memory capacity,\ncognitive control, and sequence learning and memory. We review these four\ncapacities and their impacts on purported human-unique domains here.\n\n### Box 2 Capacity limits in adulthood\n\nCapacity limits are a key constraint in human adult cognition, apparent in all\nposited silver-bullet domains. In many cases, adult human abilities bump up\nagainst processing limitations, which suggests that species with different\nlimitations should not show behaviour that is qualitatively human-like. For\ninstance, adults exhibit upper limits on the number of meaningful chunks of\ninformation they can hold in mind at one time, which interacts with the\nresource demands of the task^291. Effects of capacity limits on adult\ncognition are observed in relational, causal and social reasoning and\nlanguage. For example, adults have highly limited abilities to understand\nrecursive embedding^129,130. Furthermore, adults\u2019 analogical reasoning shifts\nfrom abstract and relational to more concrete and object-based when\ninformation processing is taxed, such as with increased working memory\nload^292. Finally, human social interactions become more challenging and less\ncohesive if there are more than four people involved in the discourse, a\nphenomenon known as \u2018the dinner party problem\u2019^293. Thus, adult human\ncognition is limited by its information capacity, and there are certain rules\nand patterns that are too long or complex for humans to comprehend.\n\n\u2018Rational\u2019 accounts of cognition attempt to explain behaviour in terms of what\nwould be expected from an \u2018ideal\u2019 learner who has a perfect memory^294,295.\nHowever, models that posit that adults are efficient at solving problems have\nobvious difficulty approximating behaviour when adults\u2019 behaviour is\nsuboptimal. A growing area of computational modelling seeks to understand so-\ncalled resource rational models, which formalize optimal or efficient use of\nfinite mental resources such as memory or attention^265,266. Resource rational\nmodels posit that people are efficient relative to their resource constraints,\nbut their resource constraints prevent them from achieving normatively perfect\nbehaviour. This type of approach can be seen in theories of human\nperception^296, decision-making^297,298, encoding of subjective value^299,\ngeneralization^300, processing of centre-embedding linguistic structure^301\nand number cognition^302. Across these domains, models with limited resources\nprovide a better account of human behaviour than those that assume unlimited\nor unrestricted resources. Limited capacity is therefore a promising approach\nto understanding cognition that highlights ways in which finite informational\ncapacity shapes how humans solve problems.\n\n### Simple learning rates\n\nSome species learn novel associations, generalizations, rules and strategies\nmore quickly than others^57,182,186,187. For instance, oddity learning, in\nwhich animals must tip over the odd object between three wooden objects on a\nboard to find a food reward, has shown species differences. In one typical\nexperiment, chimpanzees and monkeys learned to decipher which object was the\nodd one above chance (60%) in 1,152 trials, whereas cats and raccoons\nperformed at chance for 4,800 trials^187. Chimpanzees reached 90% accuracy at\n2,208 trials, whereas monkeys took 3,508 trials. Human children aged 3\u20135 years\nlearned to 90% accuracy in one fifth of the trials (mean = 203 trials) and\nthose aged 6 years in one twentieth of the trials (mean = 96 trials) compared\nwith chimpanzees (mean = 2,208 trials)^188. With instruction, human children\nlearn even faster than they do by trial and error^189. Thus, humans learn\nabstract rules faster than primates from early childhood, due partly to an\ninherently higher learning rate and partly to instruction, enabling more\nabstract rule learning in humans compared with other primates. Abstract rules\nwith arbitrary stimuli such as wooden blocks are unlikely to arise from\ndomain-specific adaptations and silver-bullet representations because the\ntarget of learning is arbitrary stimuli and the rule applies to features of\nthose stimuli generally. Instead, species differences on these rule-learning\ntasks indicate varying domain-general capacities.\n\nLearning rates vary even within narrower clades of species, such as among\nprimates^10,190. In basic learning set tasks^181,191,192, animals must choose\ncorrectly between two arbitrary stimuli (such as a cylinder and a cube) to get\na food reward. Once they do so, two new objects (such as a sphere and a cone)\nare presented and they must learn which is rewarded. Attention set-shifting\ninvolves switching between stimuli on the basis of one dimension (such as\nshape) and then another (such as colour) within the same task. Animals learn\nthe overarching task rule rather than just an association between object or\nfeature and reward, as demonstrated by the fact that they learn faster with\neach new contingency^10. A meta-analysis of learning set performance with\nprimates revealed that apes exhibit faster learning than Old World monkeys,\nand Old World monkeys perform better than prosimians^10. Humans, including\nyoung children, acquire learning set rules in a fraction of the trials it\ntakes apes and monkeys to learn^193,194. As with oddity learning, species\ndifferences in this task are attributable to differences in underlying\ninformation capacity. All species we described can learn the basic associative\ntask and the task sets with arbitrary stimuli but they consistently differ in\nthe rates at which they acquire and generalize those contingencies,\nimplicating general learning differences rather than differences in domain-\nspecific adaptations.\n\nReversal learning is similar to learning set tasks but requires the exact\nopposite choice of what was just learned. During reversals, the previously\nunrewarded object becomes the rewarded one and vice versa^57,195,196. Animals\nwho learn broad task strategies are more successful on the task than those who\nrely on associations, as they learn to represent the task strategically with a\nrule (such as \u2018reverse\u2019 or \u2018win\u2013stay, lose\u2013shift\u2019) and can adapt when an item\nthat yielded a reward for many trials suddenly becomes unrewarded. Some\nspecies (including apes) show fast rates of acquisition on both initial\nlearning set and reversals, but others (including lemurs) show fast learning\nrates for sets but not reversals. Thus, some species easily learn simple\nassociations but do not learn abstract rules as easily.\n\nReversal learning shows qualitative differences in task performance between\nspecies. Species with lower learning capacities are unable to transfer their\nlearning. After learning one association (\u2018choose A, not B\u2019) they must build\nup a new association de novo (\u2018choose B, not A\u2019), so each reversal takes them\na long time to learn^182. There was substantial variability among 79 primate\nspecies who were trained to identical criteria on reversal learning^182. Some\nprimates such as apes learned a global strategy or rule whereas other species\nsuch as prosimians learned a series of associations. Some animals lack the\nflexibility to readily derive an abstract rule, perhaps in part because they\nperseverate or adhere to known successful responses.\n\nThese results suggest that general learning capacity yields qualitative\ndifferences in cognition because different species solve identical tasks in\ndifferent ways. Systematic performance gaps emerge between species even across\nsimple, domain-general tasks \u2014 which supports the second prediction of our\ntheory.\n\n### Simple memory capacity\n\nHumans have a large memory capacity, estimated at a billion bits^197, with\nlanguage alone requiring 12.5 million bits^173. With training, human memory\ncapacity can be substantially improved^198,199. Humans can learn and remember\nmore than 2,500 new, unique visual items in a simple 5-h experiment and are\nthought to be capable of maintaining more than 200,000 unique visual items in\nmemory at a time^200. Using a comparable paradigm, pigeons required 700\nsessions to learn 1,000 images and baboons required 3\u20135 years to learn\n3,500\u20135,000 images^201. The pigeons and baboons showed set size effects,\nsuggesting similar underlying mechanisms to human memory^202. Baboons\u2019 ability\nto learn four times more stimuli than pigeons suggests genetic differences in\nsimple memory capacity between primates and pigeons. Humans are estimated to\nhave 50 times the memory capacity of baboons^200 so those genetic differences\nin simple memory capacity between pigeons and non-human primates plausibly\nextend to differences between humans and non-human primates as well. Such\nmemory differences are certain to cause profound species differences in\ncognitive domains such as relational reasoning, social cognition, complex\naction and tool use, and complex rule learning that require representing many\nitems such as symbols, words and concepts.\n\n### Cognitive control\n\nFlexibility during problem-solving is a criterion for intelligent\nbehaviour^29,184. Some species are more likely to \u2018get stuck\u2019 during problem-\nsolving than others. There are a few general mechanisms relevant to\nflexibility, which might be termed control, attention, inhibition, self-\nregulation or executive function. These mechanisms have a role in tasks that\nrequire remembering the past, avoiding errors and consciousness, all task\nbehaviours that are proposed as markers of human uniqueness attributed to\nunique neural evolution of human prefrontal cortex^14. However, the role of\nthese general cognitive mechanisms in behavioural flexibility is enhanced not\njust in species with larger prefrontal regions but also in species with larger\noverall brains and relatively small prefrontal cortices.\n\nTwo self-regulation tasks include the A-not-B task, in which a prepotent\nresponse (A) is built up and then a new response (B) is prompted and\nresearchers measure the time needed to adopt the new response^203, and the\nperseveration test, in which a naturally prepotent response is unsuccessful\nand researchers measure how long it takes subjects to change course^204,205.\nSpecies vary in their ability to control prepotent responses in these tasks,\nwith larger-brained animals such as apes, elephants and dolphins exhibiting\nthe highest degree of control, and marmosets and rats showing the weakest\ncontrol^184. Overall neural densities, which are genetically determined, seem\nto influence an animal\u2019s capacity for self-regulation. Humans rank high in\ncontrol relative to other primates, starting around age 2\u20133 years^203, which\nsuggests that human advantages in cognitive control develop early. The early\ndevelopment of advantages in self-regulation suggests a genetic and general\ncause for human advantages in cognitive control. This ability is essential for\nconceptual change and complex learning \u2014 for example, substantial evidence\nshows that these general cognitive capacities are critical precursors to\nrelational reasoning in human children^206. Together, these findings implicate\na general and evolutionary basis for species differences in acquiring simple\nrules, hinging on their ability to rapidly integrate new information into new\naction.\n\n### Sequence learning and memory\n\nThe capacity to hold multiple items in mind at the same time is needed to\nsolve complex problems. For example, to recognize that a pattern such as\n\u2018ABBA\u2019 also applies to \u2018CDDC\u2019 and \u2018EFFE\u2019, one must hold the four elements of\n\u2018ABBA\u2019 in mind, extract a rule and apply it to four new elements (Box 3).\nSpecies vary in their ability to hold multiple items in mind^207. Many\nsongbirds demonstrate exquisite sequential memory, although it is species-\nspecific^208. Humans excel at learning arbitrary sequences of colours, tones\nor shapes^209. A meta-analysis of 108 experiments across 14 species^210 found\nthat humans required far fewer trials to reach a given level of performance on\nsequencing tasks than other species. For example, rats required thousands of\ntrials to discriminate between two 3-item sequences above 50%; pigeons\nrequired 300 trials to reach 95% accuracy, and then showed almost no\nimprovement for 2,000 trials; and humans reached nearly 100% accuracy in 10\ntrials. On a sequence discrimination task, humans took 30 trials to reach 90%\naccuracy whereas macaques took 400 trials^211.\n\nHuman adults might use language encoding as a tool to enhance their capacity\non sequencing tasks with verbalizable materials^207. However, non-verbal tasks\nsuch as the Corsi tapping task also show capacity differences between humans\nand non-human primates^212. Baboons performed significantly worse than humans\non this task, being only consistently above chance with three-item and four-\nitem sequences, whereas humans were above chance up to six items. Humans also\nshowed evidence of using a sequencing strategy involving encoding relative\ndistances and proximities among the sequence items, which demands more\nresources initially than rote memory of locations but could feed back into\nbetter memory in the long run. This strategy difference suggests a more\nlimited capacity in non-human animals to represent sequential relations\ncompared with humans^62,158,210,213.\n\nThe amount of time an individual can hold something in working memory\n(duration) is independent of the number of items an individual can hold in\nworking memory^214. The duration of working memory varies between species. On\na one-item delayed matching task with one distractor, memory duration is\nsimilar across non-human primates and, potentially, some birds, whereas insect\nmemory is poorer^215. The serial probe recognition task^216 tests memory\nduration per item position, without requiring animals to remember the sequence\norder. Pigeons, monkeys and humans all perform this task with high accuracy\nand show the signatures of primacy and recency in their memory\nperformance^216. However, pigeon memory decays approximately three times\nfaster than monkey memory, and monkey memory decays three times faster than\nhuman memory.\n\nChimpanzees showed impressive memory capacity on a touchscreen task in which\nnumerals between \u20181\u2019 and \u20189\u2019 are briefly flashed on a screen and subjects have\nto press the locations in a trained order^217. Chimpanzees practised this task\nover a 1-year period, 4 times per week for 50 trials per session. After\ntraining, they were given a novel testing session in which the items were\nflashed at sub-second speeds and their performance was compared with that of\nhumans. With six items, chimpanzees were less accurate than humans and\nachieved 65% accuracy, compared with 80% for humans during the two testing\nsessions, and with five items, chimpanzees\u2019 performance was generally within\nthe range of human performance. However, non-human primates typically perform\nmuch worse than humans on memory tasks. For example, chimpanzees and macaques\nstruggle to integrate information in the memory game (in which players flip\nover pairs of cards to find matching pairs), tracking items over fewer than 4\ncards^218 compared with humans tracking items over 12 cards. Thus, whereas\nchimpanzees can perform similarly to humans on some memory tasks, typically\nhumans excel in this area compared with other species^210.\n\nOther domains requiring sequence memory are tool use and language. Non-human\nanimals cannot produce complex, hierarchical sequences of behaviour in a range\nof domains from communication to tool use^11,219 but they can integrate a\nlimited number of action\u2013object relations into their tool-using routines. Most\nnon-human animal tool use involves a single object impacting another\nobject^11. However, human tool use often requires hierarchical embedding:\nusing one object to make another object and then impacting a third object (and\ndeeper levels of subroutines)^11. Hierarchical embedding is the same\nlimitation observed in ape language wherein apes did not produce multi-word\nutterances and struggled to comprehend multi-item hierarchical syntax^163,164.\nGeneral differences in hierarchical reasoning for action and language might in\nthis way distinguish humans from non-human primates^11,219. This general\nconstraint on non-human primate action and communication is a quantitative one\n\u2014 the number of levels of embedding in communication and action.\n\nDifferences in item capacity and temporal decay in sequence memory, as seen\nbetween humans and non-human primates, can substantially impact a species\u2019\nability to extract various types of rules from new information, even when\nthere are no other differences in representation. Intricate rules, such as\nanalogies, grammars and hierarchies, require the observation of patterns\nacross multiple items that unfold over time. When one\u2019s capacity to faithfully\nrepresent multiple items over an extended duration is small, it is impossible\nto extract the kinds of complex patterns or rules that only emerge in longer\nsequences and sets. Consequently, memory capacity for sets and sequences is a\ncritical bottleneck for representing relations and rules across domains,\nincluding social cognition, tool use and communication.\n\n### Box 3 Information capacity constrains rule learning\n\nA computational model can be used to evaluate how capacity influences what\nstructures a learner can acquire. Domain-general pattern learning models are\nable to find concise algorithmic descriptions of discrete data sequences^303.\nFor example, when provided with input such as \u2018abbabbabb\u2019, such a model would\nlearn an iterative or recursive representation that generalizes to longer\nsequences following this pattern, such as \u2018abbabbabbabbabb ...\u2019. When given\ninput such as \u2018aaabbbccc\u2019 the model would generalize to both shorter\n(\u2018aabbcc\u2019) and longer (\u2018aaaabbbbcccc\u2019) strings that also follow this a^nb^nc^n\npattern. This program learning model can acquire key structures in natural\nlanguage, including different kinds of recursion and hierarchy by constructing\nrepresentations of grammars out of a handful of algorithmic pieces, just as\nprogrammers build complex programs out of a few dozen built-in operations.\n\nVery similar models can be found in, for example, sequence memory^304 and\nother cognitive domains^48. All such models work by finding programs that\nprovide a concise description of the data. For example, if learners saw the\nsequence \u2018abbabbabb\u2019, they might construct a program F defined as F() : =\nrepeat(pair(\u2018a\u2019, pair(\u2018b\u2019, \u2018b\u2019)), 3). Here, F first pairs together \u2018bb\u2019 from\nits component parts (using pair(\u2018b\u2019,\u2019b\u2019)), and then pairs that structure with\nan \u2018a\u2019 to yield \u2019abb\u2019 (using pair(\u2018a\u2019, pair(\u2018b\u2019, \u2018b\u2019))). The \u2018repeat\u2019\noperation then repeats the entire \u2018abb\u2019 structure three times. Thus, this\nprogram F is one way to describe the regularities in the string \u2018abbabbabb\u2019.\nThe task of the learner is to find program F by searching over ways of\ncomposing the parts to capture the data (or an approximation to it). Such\nmodels work essentially similar to scientists who observe data and try to\ncraft formal theories to explain the data they see. The models are typically\nbiased to find short or concise programs to capture the data they observe,\nfollowing \u2018minimum description length\u2019 accounts of statistical inference^305\nas well as theories of artificial intelligence that argue that an intelligent\nagent should try to find concise programs to explain observations^306,307.\n\nThe complexity of pattern a learning model can find in a sequence is a\nfunction of the length of the data its memory system can handle. We used a\nversion of a sequential rule-learning model^303 that includes several\noperations including repetition (such as \u2018repeat\u2019), alternation, reversals,\nlist-building functions (such as \u2018pair\u2019) as well as recursive and logical\noperations^308 to demonstrate this point. This model also enables learners to\ngenerate arbitrarily long sequences, meaning that one could hypothesize that\nthe observed data were part of an infinite longer sequence. We looked at the\nlength of every possible data sequence (such as \u2018abbabbabb\u2019) versus the length\nof the shortest computing program (rule) that would produce it. The key is\nthat if there is a program that is shorter than the data sequence, this means\nthat there is a pattern present that a learner could detect. Generally, for\nshort sequences there is no program shorter than the data, meaning that even\nan ideal learner would memorize these sequences and not find any pattern, nor\nbe able to generalize a pattern to longer sequences. However, once the\nlearning model had enough memory to use more than four or five items, it\nbecame possible to detect patterns in the input and create a shorter\ngenerating program, just as in the ABAB example. Thus, idealized learners with\nmemory of fewer than four or five items would not be able to discover much\nstructure from the world, even in principle. In this way, limits on\ninformation capacity obscure competence.\n\n## Qualitative impacts from quantitative change\n\nThe third prediction of the information capacity theory is that quantitative\nchange in information capacity can underlie qualitative leaps in ability. In\nthis section we discuss these impacts across human development and in machine\ncomputation.\n\n### Developmental change in representing relations\n\nTheories of uniquely human cognitive processes are stymied by the lack of\nevidence of new neural functions or conceptual primitives that are both innate\nand unique to humans^220. However, this state is not an issue for theories of\nuniquely human information capacity. Indeed, the same developmental primitives\nare present in humans as in other primate species: associative and statistical\nlearning^221,222,223, ordinality and iteration^224,225, object\nrepresentations^220,226, spatiotemporal intuitions^126, quantitative and\nnumerical reasoning^227, categorization and generalization^228, gaze\nfollowing^229 and speech segmentation^230.\n\nIt has been argued that an ape can do anything a human child can do up until\naround the age of 3 years^175. At around 3 years of age, something changes in\nthe human child that affords deeper abstract concepts and mental operations.\nAccording to our theory, this developmental change is due to an enhanced\ninformation processing capacity, an account that has a counterpart in\nconstructivist theories of human development dating back to the 1960s. At that\ntime, it was theorized that intelligence in children emerges by way of a\ngeneralized combinatorial system: developing general resources for mentally\nwriting down combinatorial rules that are abstract and generalizable^231.\n\nExpanding on these initial ideas, many researchers have described how\nconceptual change in childhood is fuelled by increases in general\ncapacities^48,64,66,232,233,234. For instance, the speeds at which many\ncognitive processes take place, such as mental addition, mental rotation,\nmemory search and simple motor skills, follow a consistent and predictable\nexponential pattern of change throughout development^234. This observation\nindicates that there is a general constraint on global cognitive processing\nand reflects properties of the information capacity of children.\n\nMajor leaps in human conceptual development require integrating four items\ninto a logical rule or relation. There is a mathematical reason for this\nquantitative constraint on logical rule learning (Box 3). Complex patterns and\nrules only exist across four or more items organized into dimensions,\nsubgroups and hierarchies (not across one, two or three items). Logical rules\nrequiring four items are sometimes called quaternary relations^66.\nAnalogies^66, embedded and conjoint conditional rules^235, recursive\nsyntax^236, conjunctive syntax with two subjects, a verb, and an object^164,\ncentre-embedded hierarchies^158,237 and the successor function in counting^238\ncan only be extracted across sets or sequences of at least four entities. For\nexample, an analogy such as \u2018dog is to wolf as cat is to cougar\u2019 requires\nrepresenting dog, wolf, cat and cougar in an A:B::C:D rule. Furthermore, a\ncentre-embedded hierarchy is only distinct from iteration when it has at least\nfour items (for instance in an A^nB^n rule^158).\n\nThe types of rules and patterns that children can explicitly represent at\ndifferent ages vary quantitatively: unary relations at age 1 year, binary\nrelations at age 2 years, ternary relations at age 5 years and quaternary\nrelations at age 11 years^66. Unary means the child is representing one\nrelation, such as \u2018The colour of the sky is blue\u2019. The number of relations\nscales with the depth of meaning from concrete to operational \u2014 unary\nrelations compare object and feature similarity whereas quaternary relations\ncompare operations such as the similarity of \u2018similarities\u2019 between groups.\nFor example, in category similarity judgements, children\u2019s knowledge\ntransitions from the unary object-based sameness (for instance, a dog is more\nsimilar to a wolf than a parrot) to quaternary relational-sameness (for\ninstance, a dog is similar to a wolf in the same way a cat is similar to a\ncougar)^66. We suggest that between the ages of 3 and 5 years children become\ncapable of representing rules and relations across four items because they\ndevelop greater (functional) information processing capacity, enabling complex\nrules and operations.\n\nNon-human primates typically lack the ability to represent quaternary\nrelations. Even with years of language and symbol training, non-human primates\nstruggle with the combinatorial functions of language learning^50,164,239.\nThus, they remain stuck at the level of a human child aged 2\u20133 years when it\ncomes to generating and comprehending a sentence or relational phrase.\nMultiple studies have shown that even with more than 4 years of experience,\nlanguage-trained apes have an approximate mean utterance length of around 1.6\nwords, which is similar to 2-year-old children^164,240. By contrast, by 3\nyears of age human children have mean utterance lengths of three to four\nwords^241.\n\nOne longitudinal project directly compared language comprehension in a 2-year-\nold child and a 2-year-old bonobo who had similar language experiences. The\nchild and bonobo were trained from 3 months of age to produce words and\nstrings with a lexigram keyboard and to comprehend spoken language^164. Over a\ntesting period of 9 months, the child initially produced utterance lengths\naveraging 1.91 morphemes and rose to an average of 3.19, whereas the bonobo\u2019s\nutterances began at 1.15 morphemes and remained stuck at that level throughout\nthe testing period. Language comprehension was tested by presenting an array\nof real objects and asking the subject via novel spoken sentences to carry out\nactions with those objects (for example, \u2018Put the ball on the pine needles\u2019).\nComprehension of language was far easier than production for the bonobo, who\ncould carry out tasks from utterances that were longer than those he produced.\nThis pattern mirrors child language development^164 and highlights the\nimportance of memory constraints in interpreting language production. The\nbonobo also used word order to interpret the meaning of the sentences and\ncould understand syntactic reversals (such as \u2018Put some water in the coke\u2019\nversus \u2018Put some coke in the water\u2019). The specific limitation of the bonobo\ncompared with human children was with long utterances and conjunctive\nconstructions that burden memory capacity, such as \u2018Give the peas and the\nsweet potatoes to Kelly\u2019. These findings suggest that the key constraint on\nthe bonobo\u2019s language learning was the capacity for multiple simultaneous\nrepresentations.\n\n### Developmental change in domain-general capacity\n\nAlso consistent with the notion that quantitative changes yield conceptual\nchange, developmental changes in domain-general capacities are related to\nchildren\u2019s conceptual changes^64. For example, the emergence of theory of mind\naccompanies conceptual change in early childhood. Theory of mind requires\nintegrating multiple relations between minds and behaviours of oneself and\nothers^242. Infants have knowledge about the goal-directed and intentional\nacts of people and themselves but struggle to integrate that information\nacross multiple agents and events^154. Tasks such as the false belief task\nthat measure theory of mind ability show poor performance until around the age\nof 5 years, after which children typically succeed^243. Children\u2019s individual\ndifferences on this task are highly correlated with their executive function\nabilities^235,244. Furthermore, relational capacity explains 80% of age-\nrelated variance in the performance of children aged 3\u20135 years on false belief\ntasks^245. That is, children\u2019s performance on tasks such as transitive\ninference, which require high relational capacity (but not theory of mind),\npredicts their performance on tasks that do require theory of mind. The\ncapacity to integrate multiple relations develops gradually in children and\nonce present, theory of mind can develop. Although the emergence of theory of\nmind might look similar to a qualitative conceptual change, it is underlain by\nquantitative changes in information processing capacity.\n\nOver development, expansions in general information capacities increase the\nnumber of rules and relations that children can represent, compare or embed,\nwhich increases the types of rules that can be represented. Qualitative\nconceptual change requires semantic knowledge and experience but is\nfundamentally fuelled by changes in information processing capacity. Thus, the\nphylogenetic and ontogenetic causes of intelligence have a common coupling to\ninformation capacity.\n\n### Information capacity in computation\n\nCapacity differences, even minor or continuous changes, can profoundly impact\ncomputational performance. For instance, Turing machines, a standard abstract\nmodel of computation, are formalized mathematically as possessing an infinite\nmemory. However, early results in complexity theory showed that if the\ncomputer has a tight bound on memory available (as a function of its input\nsize), then the class of computations it can execute is strictly limited. If\nthe amount of memory available to process an input of size n is less than\nlog(log(n)), then the computer is provably only capable of recognizing regular\nlanguages^246 \u2014 languages that can be processed with a finite number of memory\nstates^247. Such capacity-limited computers are therefore incapable of\nprocessing the kinds of hierarchies such as context-free languages that are\nconsidered to approximate human language, much less more complex context-\nsensitive features or transformations^248. This result seems to establish a\n\u2018quantum jump\u2019 in memory requirements for regular versus non-regular\nlanguages: a small quantitative increase in memory can lead to qualitatively\ndifferent computational ability.\n\nThese formal results provide a clear demarcation between regular and non-\nregular languages that is governed by the amount of available memory:\nalgorithms or species that use comparatively little memory cannot be\ngenerating or recognizing anything other than the simplest kinds of string\npatterns. Although these results are more than 60 years old, they are strongly\nconnected to contemporary cognitive science. Several studies have examined\nwhat kinds of string patterns animals are capable of\nprocessing^160,249,250,251,252; other work has attempted to rigorously\ncharacterize the level of computational complexity in human\nlanguages^253,254,255,256,257,258. The primary distinction examined in animal\nwork is whether non-human species are capable of recognizing or generating\nstrings from languages other than regular languages, but the results are mixed\nand difficult to interpret, in part, because the sets of strings studied can\noften be processed with other heuristics.\n\nMore general findings about the linkage between memory and computational\nability can be found in the space hierarchy theorem^259, which proves that\ncomputers that are given more memory capacity (as a function of their input\nsize) are capable of solving a larger number of problems. This conclusion can\nbe contrasted with, for example, the fact that many modifications of Turing\nmachines do not increase their computational capability. For example, altering\na standard Turing machine to give it two tapes, or even two-dimensional tapes,\ndoes not fundamentally change the rules it can use or the problems it can\nsolve. But allocating it more internal memory space, as a function of input\nsize, does.\n\nWhen a learner\u2019s memory is only a few items, it will not be possible for them\nto learn classes of patterns that only become apparent after several items.\nFor example, neither the sequence AB nor ABA leads one to see the repetition\npattern in ABAB, meaning that this repetition pattern would be inaccessible\nfor learners with memories of fewer than four items. This idea can be\nformulated in the context of structured learning models, for which limited\nmemory of the input data would prevent acquisition of patterns, including\nhierarchical structure. In this case, the best a learner could do is try to\nmemorize the data. The behavioural consequence of this memory limitation would\nbe limited rule-like generalizations in relational reasoning, imitation, tool\nuse, language learning and any domain that requires representations of\nmultiple actions, agents and entities.\n\nAlthough this impact is debated, capacity constraints have also been argued to\ncritically shape machine learning capability in modern neural networks.\nMachine learning performance depends on parameters such as the amount of\ntraining data, the number of training steps and the number and arrangement of\nnodes in the network^260,261. Some models only show above-floor performance on\ntasks involving human-like intelligence when they are able to use billions of\nparameters. Indeed, although some tasks scale smoothly with model size, at\nother times changes in capacity are profound and discontinuous as the\nparameters or capacity of the models is increased^262. Such neural networks\nshow systematic scaling patterns, often power laws, between performance and\nboth the amount of data and the neural network size or capacity^263,264,265.\nThe highest performing deep learning models can memorize massive amounts of\ndata, fitting even random labels^264,265, and it is likely that this ability\nfor memorization is critical for extracting the higher-order regularities\nnecessary for high performance in domains such as language usage and image\nclassification. Indeed, modern high-capacity systems have been argued to show\nsigns of general intelligence, succeeding on a diverse array of tasks such as\nmathematics, tool use, theory of mind and programming^266, although the\nability of these systems to truly reason in a human-like way is contested^267.\n\nPart of the success of modern neural networks has been driven by the\nrealization that increasing computational power can outperform tailored\n(silver-bullet) representations^268. For domains including speech recognition,\nchess and computer vision, experts once believed that tailored representations\nwere the solution, but these efforts stalled and, arguably, even inhibited\nfuture progress^268. These problems were eventually solved using simpler\ntechniques with models that built in less knowledge of each specific domain,\ncombined with higher computing power and more general capacity^268.\n\nTogether, these results generally show that the informational limits faced by\na system are an important determinant of the range of computations it can\nperform. Moreover, the success of the best learning models does not seem to be\ndue to carefully constructed silver-bullet representations but, rather, the\ndiscovery of how to make learning scale to large data sets and numbers of\nparameters, suggesting that general scaling of informational capacity might\nhave been a route to the evolution of human-like intelligence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe propose that global, genetic differences in learning and memory are\nsufficient to account for uniquely human reasoning across domains, as an\nalternative to theories that require qualitative, domain-specific evolutionary\nchanges specifically in human cognition to explain uniquely human behaviours.\nThis theory of human uniqueness makes three concrete predictions. First, the\ntheory predicts that non-human primates will show some degree of success on\ntasks previously purported to draw on domain-specific specializations in\nhumans. Second, the theory predicts continuous, quantifiable advantages for\nhumans relative to non-human species on basic tasks, even tasks that only\nrequire representations of a few items, actions or features. Last, the theory\npredicts that subtle increases in information capacity yield qualitative\nchanges in behaviour in humans, non-human animals and computational systems\nmore broadly.\n\nNo existing theories have been able to adequately disentangle information\ncapacity from domain-specific functions, nor explain the concrete implications\nthese capacity limitations have on the ability to learn and represent\nknowledge. Theoreticians of domain-specific theories have been too eager to\nposit that specific mechanisms are unique to humans, leaving all the other\ndifferences in the information processing machinery of cognition unaddressed\nand confounding. We suspect that global information capacity tends to take a\nbackseat in theories of human uniqueness because researchers underestimate its\npotential to yield qualitative changes in cognition between species. However,\ngeneral capacity constraints have profound consequences and information\ncapacity determines which species can learn the hierarchical, abstract\npatterns and generalizations and which species, simply, cannot. We showed how\ninformation capacity gradually expands over human development and how it\nrelates to qualitative changes in human cognition. Expansions in information\ncapacity enable rule-based, compressed representations of complex phenomena\nsuch as sequences, sets and relations that are abstract and generalizable (Box\n3). The ability to think symbolically probably enriches this benefit of\ninformation capacity even further. Independently of the neural or cognitive\ninstantiation, changes to capacity have a surprising qualitative effect on the\nabilities of computational systems: differences in degree yield differences in\nkind.\n\nWe detailed how basic differences in information capacity between humans and\nother animals can lead to qualitatively unique human cognition, both\ndevelopmentally and evolutionarily, offering new research possibilities. New\ndirections include testing how variations in information capacity relate to\ncomplex rule learning and concept formation across species, how the synergy\nbetween information capacity and language expands concept and rule learning\nduring human development, and the role of sequence and set memory in rule\nextraction across different species and age groups. One key prediction is that\nthe capacity for complex rule learning (whether social, physical or abstract)\nis inherently and mathematically linked to the capacity for representing\nmultiple items simultaneously \u2014 a hypothesis that can be tested in animals,\ndeveloping children and machines. A key experimental direction will be to test\ncausal evidence for the role of information capacity on the tasks hypothesized\nto show human uniqueness. However, measuring information capacity directly\nposes a challenge (Box 4), due to the complexity of the target behaviours and\nthe limited tasks for which information can be formally characterized at\npresent. Information measures vary across inputs, abstractions and processes.\nFor instance, channel capacity for high-level vision of objects might differ\nbetween species, even if the capacity for low-level vision is the same because\nthe information processing demands of high-level versus low-level abstractions\nprobably differ. Information processing demands also can vary across content\ntypes, such as between social interactions and object use. Simulations of\ninformation capacity under different processing conditions are critical for\ndeveloping experimental predictions.\n\n\u2018How\u2019 human cognition is unique is probably intertwined with \u2018why\u2019 human\ncognition is unique. Several authors have proposed accounts of human evolution\nthat provide a compelling answer to \u2018why\u2019 new cognitive abilities might have\nemerged specifically in humans. Perhaps primitive human environments contained\nunique survival pressures to cooperate and learn socially^31 or humans\nuniquely benefited from cumulative culture, which altered the human\nenvironment so dramatically that it prompted new genetic adaptations^12,269.\nThe problem with prior \u2018why\u2019 accounts such as these is that they do not\nexplain \u2018how\u2019, cognitively, human minds and brains changed^270. In light of\nthe behavioural, neurobiological, computational and developmental evidence we\nreviewed, we propose that unique expansions in global, generic information\ncapacity are the most plausible genetically based cognitive adaptation to\nratcheting environmental pressures on learning, memory, attention, semantics\nand logical rule use arising from ever more demanding human culture.\n\nThe uniquely human adaptation for information processing capacity provides an\nopportunity to represent multiple complex behavioural alternatives, to enact\nflexibility and innovation^271 and to learn quickly, and yields a substrate\nfor \u2018cognitive gadgets\u2019, wherein humans acquire unique capacities by building\non cultural innovations^13. One cognitive gadget, writing, provides important\nclues to the pressures humans faced for information capacity. Over cultural\nevolution, the human species was so pressured for increased information\ncapacity that they invented writing, a revolutionary leap forward in the\ndevelopment of our species that enables information capacity to be\nexternalized^272, frees up internal processing and affords the development of\nmore complex concepts. In other words, writing enabled humans to think more\nabstractly and logically by increasing information capacity. Today, humans\nhave gone to even greater lengths: the Internet, computers and smartphones are\ntestaments to the substantial pressure humans currently face \u2014 and probably\nfaced in the past \u2014 to increase information capacity.\n\nDarwin claimed that humans differed from other primates in degree rather than\nkind, which has been dismissed by some as a mistaken claim^52. But if there is\none lesson from formal computer science, it is that differences in degree\nyield differences in kind. Evolution doubled the information processing\ncapacity of humans, which set in motion a cycle of advances between logic\ninnovation and developmental acquisition that snowballed over millions of\nyears of human cultural evolution. Other species could never learn human-like\nrules and structures, internalize human-like logic and relations or exhibit\nthe same complex behaviour as humans when their cognitive systems face severe\ninformation constraints. Unique information capacity magnifies human\ncognition, qualitatively alters its representations and processes, and is\nessential for understanding the evolution and development of human\nintelligence.\n\n### Box 4 Measuring information capacity\n\nThere are several methods that have been developed to measure information\nprocessing, and each targets information specific to a given behavioural task\nor setting.\n\nSpeed and bit rate\n\nOne approach to measuring information capacity is to use tasks in which\nparticipants are asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a\nstimulus. Hick\u2019s law quantifies the \u2018rate of information gain\u2019 in a simple\nchoice paradigm^309; memory tasks such as digit span and working memory\nmeasure item, sequence and channel capacity for information^210,310. Posner\ncueing tasks, flanker tasks and Stroop tasks also have been used to measure\nbit rates in humans with simple rules and stimuli^311. One study showed that\nthe speeds at which numerous diverse cognitive processes occur, including\nmental addition, mental rotation, memory search and simple motor skills,\nexhibit a consistent and predictable exponential pattern of change over\ndevelopment^233 \u2014 a global cognitive processing constraint reflecting\nchildren\u2019s information capacity. Additionally, some work has provided\nestimates of information capacity in humans for long-term memory and\nlinguistic storage^173,197,200, often by quantifying what coding capacity\nwould be required to achieve the observed performance.\n\nPredictability\n\nMachine learning models are often evaluated by computing the log probability\nthat they assign to the observed data, which is an information measure (often\nsurprisal or cross-entropy). Following the same logic, one could measure the\neffective predictability of, for example, sequential stimuli for any species\nand task, and use that to quantify information processing ability. For\ninstance, in one study people were asked to predict upcoming letters in text\nand their accuracy was used to deduce how much information they had about\nupcoming linguistic material^312. In a context in which an individual predicts\nupcoming sequential material that follows a novel pattern \u2014 for example,\nsimple formal language rules \u2014 accuracy could be used to estimate how much\ninformation about the pattern is internalized. For example, from an\nindividual\u2019s accuracy or pattern of errors in predicting the next character in\nthe sequence \u2018abbacabbacabbac ...\u2019, one can compute how much they have learned\nabout the sequence (see ref. ^313 for people\u2019s learning of similar string\npatterns and ref. ^223 for work on early language learning). Empirically\nmeasuring predictive ability in this setting is potentially powerful because\nabove-chance accuracy means that some information must be present, which can\nbe examined as a function of developmental age, amount of training exposure or\nspecies.\n\nLearning rate and lapse rate\n\nThe learning rate and the lapse rate are another pair of measures for\nestimating information capacity^314. The learning rate quantifies change in\naccuracy per unit time, and the lapse rate is the asymptote of the learning\ncurve. Both of these metrics vary across species and can be used to query\nglobal information processing across tasks. Lapse rates are especially useful\nfor measuring general motivation during a given task, which is a common\nconfound for comparing cognition between populations. Similarly, species might\nmake different speed\u2013accuracy trade-offs in any given task^315, with different\nstrategic choices potentially confounding conclusions about overall ability.\n\nRecoding\n\nEstimating and comparing information capacity between groups is difficult when\nrecoding occurs^316. Recoding is the process by which information is mentally\ncompressed during task performance. Humans are very good at recoding\ninformation using chunking, rules, heuristics or verbalization, thereby making\nspace for more information. Non-human primates also have some ability to\nrecode information^167,212. The ways that humans and non-human primates recode\nand compress information are only beginning to be understood, but it is\ncritical to understand these phenomena in order to measure information\ncapacity. For example, symbolic recoding could facilitate human learning\nduring passive or social learning tasks in ways that exceed the capabilities\nof non-human primates.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
