AWS said it\nintends to appeal the verdict, which acknowledged that the company had not\nwillfully infringed on the patents in question.\n\nThe technology at the center of the case relates to distributed hash tables, a\ndecentralized system used to store and retrieve data, with the data in this\ninstance being the location information for specific data files in a scale-out\ndata storage platform.\n\nThose patents in question are US Patent numbers 7,814,170 ('170) \"Network\nDistributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol\"; 7,103,640 ('640) \"Network\nDistributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol\"; and 7,233,978 ('978), aka\n\"Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate\nFrom the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.\"\n\nKove names Dr John Overton and Dr Stephen Bailey as the inventors of the\ntechnology involved, with Overton serving as the company's CEO.\n\nIn its complaint, Kove states that the pair \"realized that storing location\ninformation associated with data files across multiple servers would reduce\nthe processing time to find a data file.\" Likewise, it says that the inventors\n\"understood the need to efficiently identify which of the multiple location\ninformation servers stored the location information for a particular data\nfile.\"\n\nThe result was distributed hash values that point to a location information\nserver. While the server may not have the location information for the file\nthe user is requesting, it will reroute to another server that does have the\ninformation.\n\nThis system \"enabled hyper-scalable cloud storage and improved upon the\nscalability limitations of conventional storage systems,\" Kove states.\n\nIn its complaint, Kove claims that its technology \"became essential to AWS as\nthe volume of data stored on its cloud grew exponentially and its cloud\nstorage business faced limitations on the ability to store and retrieve\nmassive amounts of data.\"\n\nAWS issued a fairly hefty 56-page packet of denials and counterclaims [PDF] in\n2020, denying it had infringed the patents in question and arguing that the\npatents were actually invalid and therefore unenforceable.\n\n  * US-EAST-1 region is not the cloudy crock it's made out to be, claims AWS EC2 boss\n  * Huawei Cloud reveals the dynamic traffic allocation system it uses to cut bandwidth bills\n  * Irish power crunch could be prompting AWS to ration compute resources\n  * AWS severs connection with several hundred staff\n\nIn particular, AWS referred to a paper entitled \"Consistent Hashing and Random\nTrees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide\nWeb,\" by David Karger et al, which it cited as prior art to the '978 patent.\n\nHowever, when it came to trial, the AWS counterclaims of non\u2212infringement,\ninvalidity, unpatentability, and unenforceability of the three patents were\nall dismissed.\n\nA spokesperson for AWS told The Register: \"We disagree with today's ruling and\nintend to appeal. We thank the jury, which also acknowledged that AWS did not\nwillfully infringe on patents.\"\n\nWe also asked Kove for a statement, but the company was not immediately\navailable to respond.\n\nHowever, according to Reuters, Kove's lead attorney Courtland Reichman called\nthe verdict \"a testament to the power of innovation and the importance of\nprotecting IP rights for startup companies against tech giants.\"\n\nIt is notable that none of the Kove patents in the case were actually granted\nby the US Patent and Trademark Office before the launch of Amazon S3, the\nfirst AWS service, on March 14, 2006. However, Kove states in its complaint\nthat applications relating to these patents were filed on July 8, 1998,\nperhaps implying that Amazon should have been aware of the filings before the\nlaunch of its cloud platform.\n\nThe damages of $525 million will be a drop in the ocean to Amazon, however,\nwhich recently reported overall revenue of $170 billion for Q4 of its\nfinancial year 2023, of which $24.2 billion was contributed by AWS. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Storage\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Storage\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * Azure\n  * Backup\n  * Blu-Ray\n  * Cloud native\n  * Content delivery network\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * DRAM\n  * EC2\n  * Edge Computing\n  * FinOps\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * G Suite\n  * HDD\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * IaaS\n  * iCloud\n  * In-Memory\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Multicloud\n  * Network Attached Storage\n  * Paas\n  * Private Cloud\n  * Public Cloud\n  * S3\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Serverless\n  * Snowflake Inc.\n  * Systems Approach\n  * Virtualization\n  * vSphere\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Amazon\n  * Jeff Bezos\n\n#### More about\n\n9 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Storage\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Storage\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * Azure\n  * Backup\n  * Blu-Ray\n  * Cloud native\n  * Content delivery network\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * DRAM\n  * EC2\n  * Edge Computing\n  * FinOps\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * G Suite\n  * HDD\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * IaaS\n  * iCloud\n  * In-Memory\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Multicloud\n  * Network Attached Storage\n  * Paas\n  * Private Cloud\n  * Public Cloud\n  * S3\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Serverless\n  * Snowflake Inc.\n  * Systems Approach\n  * Virtualization\n  * vSphere\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Amazon\n  * Jeff Bezos\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### US-EAST-1 region is not the cloudy crock it's made out to be, claims AWS\nEC2 boss\n\nIt's the region where stuff gets stressed at scale first, says Dave Brown, as\nhe plots variants of Amazon's Outposts\n\nPaaS + IaaS2 days | 4\n\n#### Irish power crunch could be prompting AWS to ration compute resources\n\nExclusive Users report being pointed to other EU regions if they need more\ngrunt\n\nOn-Prem2 days | 107\n\n#### AWS severs connection with several hundred staff\n\n'Necessary,' 'focusing our efforts,' 'deliver maximum impact' ... sounds just\nlike all the other tech layoffs lately\n\nPaaS + IaaS8 days | 11\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### UK govt office admits ability to negotiate billions in cloud spending\ncurbed by vendor lock-in\n\nExclusive After slew of AWS deals signed under MoUs, CDDO says current\napproach might weaken its position\n\nPublic Sector7 days | 98\n\n#### Amazon to lure upstarts with $500K in AWS AI credits each\n\nCome on in, drill into Anthropic and Mistral \u2013 that's not the sound of a door\nslamming shut behind you\n\nAI + ML9 days | 1\n\n#### Huawei's cloud unit is its current growth vehicle\n\nBig in China \u2013 and a presence elsewhere, but not at a scale to worry global\nhyperscalers\n\nOff-Prem10 days |\n\n#### Amazon finishes pumping $4B into AI darling Anthropic\n\nAdds $2.75B to the ML sweepstakes ante and is counting on Claude\n\nAI + ML15 days | 3\n\n#### Cloud vendor lock-in is shocking, but there's a get out of jail card\n\nOpinion We've done it once, we can do it again\n\nPublic Sector4 days | 73\n\n#### Alibaba Cloud slashes prices outside China\n\nDomestic customers saw their fees cut last January\n\nSystems3 days |\n\n#### Stability AI reportedly ran out of cash to pay its bills for rented\ncloudy GPUs\n\nGenerative AI darling was on track to pay $99M on compute to generate just\n$11M in revenues\n\nAI + ML9 days | 22\n\n#### French lawmakers take a swing at cloud monopolies\n\nAction gathers steam in the EU, US and UK as anti-trust teams collate market\nfeedback\n\nPaaS + IaaS9 days | 6\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
