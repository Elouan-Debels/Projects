A second patient underwent heart xenotransplantation at\nUMSOM in 2023.\n\n\u201cEvery 80 minutes, a person on the waiting list for a new heart dies\nworldwide,\u201d said Dr. Mohiuddin, professor of surgery and program director of\nUMSOM\u2019s Cardiac Xenotransplantation Program. \u201cNot everyone is going to get a\nheart transplant.\u201d\n\nDr. Mohiuddin has implanted several hundred genetically modified pig hearts in\nanimals throughout his three-decade career, helping to prepare for the first\ngenetically modified xenotransplant in a living patient. Advances in cloning,\ngene editing, and infection control paved the way for the breakthrough in\nhuman xenotransplantation, which was performed under the US FDA\u2019s expanded\naccess program.\n\n\u201cUsing this option, we hope to eventually save millions of lives,\u201d Dr.\nMohiuddin said. \u201cGenetically modified pig hearts could expand the pool of\ndonor organs available for transplantation.\u201d\n\nPig organs are anatomically similar to humans, and pig heart valves have been\nused for decades to replace diseased human heart valves. A one-year-old\ngenetically modified pig can support a human weighing up to 200 pounds. The\npig\u2019s lifespan is 20 years.\n\nThe two human patients who received modified pig hearts at UMSOM lived\napproximately 40-60 days following their procedures.\n\n\u201cWe had the opportunity to learn a lot from our human patients,\u201d Mohiuddin\ntold attendees. \u201cWe found additional obstacles that we are hopeful we can\novercome.\u201d\n\nDuring his presentation, Mohiuddin shared a roadmap for the future of\nxenotransplantation and meeting the growing need for organs.\n\n\u201cWe want to get to the point that the same immunosuppression used in human\nheart transplants can also prolong the pig heart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advantage of\nusing genetic modification is that we can modify the donor, which, of course,\ncan\u2019t be done with a human donor heart.\u201d\n\nAbout ISHLT The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation is a\nnot-for-profit, multidisciplinary professional organization dedicated to\nimproving the care of patients with advanced heart or lung disease through\ntransplantation, mechanical support and innovative therapies. With members in\nmore than 45 countries, ISHLT is the world\u2019s largest organization dedicated to\nthe research, education and advocacy of end-stage heart and lung disease.\nISHLT members represent more than 15 different professional disciplines.
