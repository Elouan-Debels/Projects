More government welfare ....\n\nML Shaw\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Half of Irish Youth Report Low Mental Wellbeing\n\nwww.apeit.ink\n\nShare\n\nIn the emerald isles of Ireland, a storm is brewing, but it's not the kind\nthat brings rain\u2014it's a storm of youthful demands, swirling with the winds of\noptimism and a heavy downpour of entitlement.\n\nThe latest report from the National Youth Council of Ireland reveals a stark\nreality: half of the nation's young people are battling low mental wellbeing.\nBut the solution, according to the youth? More government handouts, please.\n\nThe report paints a picture of young Irish women bearing the brunt of this\nmental health crisis, with their male counterparts somehow navigating these\nchoppy waters with slightly better ease. Financial woes?\n\nOne in five young people are skipping meals. Housing crisis?\n\nNearly half are dissatisfied with their living conditions, with rent hikes\nbiting hard. But the proposed solution from the youth isn't a call for more\njobs or better economic policies.\n\nNo, they're demanding direct financial injections from the government.\n\nIt seems the younger generation has crafted an image of the government as a\nbenevolent ATM, ready to dispense cash at the push of a button.\n\nThis isn't just a cry for help; it's a demand for a financial pacifier to\nsoothe the economic and mental discomfort they face. The audacity is almost\nadmirable\u2014why solve problems when you can simply ask for more money?\n\nThis isn't just about seeking help for genuine distress; it's about\nreimagining the role of government as a perpetual caretaker, a provider of\nendless welfare.\n\nThe youth of Ireland aren't just asking for a seat at the table; they're\nasking for the table to be set, the food to be cooked, and the dishes to be\ndone, all courtesy of the state.\n\nIn a twist that would make even the most liberal economists raise an eyebrow,\nthese young activists are not content with small-scale interventions.\n\nNo, they envision a government that doesn't just support its citizens through\ncrises but serves as a constant lifeline, an ever-present guardian angel\nensuring that every aspect of life is cushioned against the harsh realities of\nthe world.\n\nAs the world watches, one can't help but wonder if this youthful \u201coptimism\u201d is\na beacon of hope or a naive march towards a nanny state. Is this the future of\nactivism\u2014demanding not just opportunities, but outcomes?\n\nOnly time will tell if these demands will forge a path to a sustainable future\nor if they'll simply add more weight to a sinking ship.\n\nsources\n\nHalf of Ireland\u2019s young people have low level of mental wellbeing, new report shows | Irish Independent\n\nhttps://www.independent.ie/irish-news/half-of-irelands-young-people-have-low-\nlevel-of-mental-wellbeing-new-report-shows/a1973091620.html\n\ngov - Statistical Spotlight #10: The Mental Health of Children and Young\nPeople in Ireland (www.gov.ie)\n\nhttps://www.gov.ie/en/publication/23b6e-statistical-spotlight-10-the-mental-\nhealth-of-children-and-young-people-in-ireland/\n\n### Subscribe to ApeIt.Ink\n\nBy ML Shaw \u00b7 Launched a month ago\n\n\"ApeIt.ink: Your Go-To Hub for Dynamic News, Insightful Opinions, and Engaging\nBlogs.
