For other uses, see\nChildren's Crusade (disambiguation).\n\nThe Children's Crusade, by Gustave Dor\u00e9\n\nThe Children's Crusade was a failed popular crusade by European Christians to\nestablish a second Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Holy Land, said to have\ntaken place in 1212. Although it is called the Children's Crusade, it never\nreceived the papal approval from Pope Innocent III to be an actual Crusade.\nThe traditional narrative is likely conflated from a mix of factual and\nmythical events, which include the preaching of visions by a French boy and a\nGerman boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to\nChristianity, bands of children marching to Italy, and children being sold\ninto slavery in Tunis. The crusaders of the real events on which the story is\nbased left areas of Germany, led by Nicholas of Cologne, and Northern France,\nled by Stephen of Cloyes.\n\n## Accounts[edit]\n\n### Traditional accounts[edit]\n\nThe variants of the long-standing story of the Children's Crusade have similar\nthemes.^[1] A boy begins to preach in either France or Germany, claiming that\nhe had been visited by Jesus, who instructed him to lead a Crusade in order to\npeacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Through a series of portents and\nmiracles, he gains a following of up to 30,000 children. He leads his\nfollowers south towards the Mediterranean Sea, in the belief that the sea\nwould part on their arrival, which would allow him and his followers to walk\nto Jerusalem. This does not happen. The children are sold to two merchants\n(Hugh the Iron and William of Posqueres), who give free passage on boats to as\nmany of the children as are willing. The pilgrims are then either taken to\nTunisia, where they are sold into slavery by the merchants or else die in a\nshipwreck on San Pietro Island off Sardinia during a gale.\n\n### Modern accounts[edit]\n\nAccording to more recent researchers, there seem to have actually been two\nmovements of people of all ages in 1212 in Germany and France.^[2]^[1] The\nsimilarities of the two allowed later chroniclers to combine and embellish.\n\n#### Nicholas of Cologne in Germany[edit]\n\nIn the first movement, Nicholas, a shepherd from the Rhineland in Germany,^[3]\ntried to lead a group across the Alps and into Italy in the early spring of\n1212. Nicholas said that the sea would open up before them just as the Lord\nhad done for the Israelites and allow his followers to cross into the Holy\nLand.^[4] Rather than intending to fight the Saracens, he said that the Muslim\nkingdoms would be defeated when their citizens converted to Christianity.^[3]\nHis disciples went off to preach the call for the \"Crusade\" across the German\nlands, and they massed in Cologne after a few weeks. Splitting into two\ngroups, the crowds took different roads through Switzerland. Two out of every\nthree people on the journey died, while many others returned to their\nhomes.^[3] About 7,000 arrived in Genoa in late August. They immediately\nmarched to the harbour, expecting the sea to divide before them; when it did\nnot many became bitterly disappointed. A few accused Nicholas of betraying\nthem, while others settled down to wait for God to change his mind, since they\nbelieved that it was unthinkable that he would not eventually do so. The\nGenoese authorities were reportedly impressed by the group, and they offered\ncitizenship to those who wished to settle in their city. Most of the would-be\nCrusaders took up this opportunity.^[3] Nicholas refused to say he was\ndefeated and travelled to Pisa, his movement continuing to break up along the\nway. In Pisa two ships directed to Palestine agreed to embark several of the\nchildren who, perhaps, managed to reach the Holy Land.^[5] Nicholas and a few\nloyal followers, instead, continued to the Papal States, where they met Pope\nInnocent III. The remaining ones departed for Germany after the Pontiff\nexhorted them to be good and to return home to their families. Nicholas did\nnot survive the second attempt across the Alps; back home his father was\narrested and hanged under pressure from angry families whose relatives had\nperished while following the children.^[3]\n\nSome of the most dedicated members of this Crusade were later reported to have\nwandered to Ancona and Brindisi; none are known to have reached the Holy\nLand.^[3]\n\n#### Stephen of Cloyes in France[edit]\n\nThe second movement was led by a twelve-year-old^[3] French shepherd boy named\nStephen (\u00c9tienne) of Cloyes, who said in June that he bore a letter for the\nking of France from Jesus who was disguised as a poor pilgrim.^[6]^[4] Large\ngangs of youths around his age were drawn to him, most of whom claimed to\npossess special gifts of God and thought themselves miracle workers.\nAttracting a following of over 30,000 adults and children, he went to Saint-\nDenis, where he was reported to cause miracles. On the orders of Philip II,\nadvised by the University of Paris, the people were implored to return home.\nPhilip himself did not appear impressed, especially since his unexpected\nvisitors were led by a mere child, and refused to take them seriously.\nStephen, however, was not dissuaded and began preaching at a nearby abbey.\nFrom Saint-Denis, Stephen travelled around France, spreading his messages as\nhe went, promising to lead charges of Christ to Jerusalem. Although the Church\nwas skeptical, many adults were impressed by his teaching.^[3] Few of those\nwho initially joined him possessed his activeness; it is estimated that there\nwere fewer than half the initial 30,000 remaining, a figure that was shrinking\nrapidly, rather than growing as perhaps anticipated.\n\nAt the end of June 1212, Stephen led his largely juvenile Crusaders from\nVend\u00f4me to Marseilles. They survived by begging for food, while the vast\nmajority seem to have been disheartened by the hardship of this journey and\nreturned to their families.^[3]\n\n## Historiography[edit]\n\n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nCrusades  \n---  \nIdeology and institutions\n\n  * Crusading movement\n\nIn the Holy Land (1095\u20131291)\n\n  * First\n  * 1101\n  * Norwegian\n  * Venetian\n  * 1129\n  * Second\n  * Third\n  * 1197\n  * Fourth\n  * Fifth\n  * Sixth\n  * Barons'\n  * Seventh\n  * 1267\n  * Catalan\n  * Eighth\n  * Lord Edward's\n  * Fall of Outremer\n\nLater Crusades (1291\u20131717)\n\n  * Crusades after Acre, 1291\u20131399\n  * Aragonese\n  * Smyrniote\n  * Alexandrian\n  * Savoyard\n  * Barbary\n    * 1390\n    * 1398\n    * 1399\n  * Nicopolis\n  * Varna\n  * Holy Leagues\n    * 1332\n    * 1495\n    * 1511\n    * 1526\n    * 1535\n    * 1538\n    * 1571\n    * 1594\n    * 1684\n    * 1717\n\nNorthern (1147\u20131410)\n\n  * Kalmar\n  * Wendish\n  * Swedish\n    * 1150\n    * 1249\n    * 1293\n  * Livonian\n  * Prussian\n  * Lithuanian\n  * Russian\n\nAgainst heretics (1209\u20131485)\n\n  * Albigensian\n  * Drenther\n  * Stedinger\n  * Bosnian\n  * Bohemian\n  * Despenser's\n  * Hussite\n\nPopular (1096\u20131320)\n\n  * People's (1096)\n  * Children's\n  * Shepherds' (1251)\n  * Crusade of the Poor\n  * Shepherds' (1320)\n\nReconquista (722\u20131492)  \n  \n### Sources[edit]\n\nAccording to Peter Raedts, professor in Medieval History at the Radboud\nUniversity Nijmegen, there are about 50 sources from the period that talk\nabout the crusade, ranging from a few sentences to half a page.^[2] Raedts\ncategorizes the sources into three types depending on when they were\nwritten:^[2]\n\n  1. Contemporary sources written by 1220;\n  2. Sources written between 1220 and 1250 (the authors could have been alive at the time of the crusade but wrote their memories down later);\n  3. Sources written after 1250 by authors who received their information second or third hand.\n\nRaedts does not consider the sources after 1250 to be authoritative, and of\nthose before 1250, he considers only about 20 to be authoritative. It is only\nin the later non-authoritative narratives that a \"children's crusade\" is\nimplied by such authors as Vincent of Beauvais, Roger Bacon, Thomas of\nCantimpr\u00e9, Matthew Paris and many others.\n\n### Historical studies[edit]\n\nPrior to Raedts's study of 1977, there had only been a few historical\npublications researching the Children's Crusade. The earliest were by the\nFrenchman G. de Janssens (1891) and the German Reinhold R\u00f6hricht (1876). They\nanalyzed the sources but did not analyze the story. American medievalist Dana\nCarleton Munro (1913\u201314), according to Raedts, provided the best analysis of\nthe sources to date and was the first to significantly provide a convincingly\nsober account of the Crusade stripped of legends.^[7] Later, J. E. Hansbery\n(1938\u20139) published a correction of Munro's work, but it has since been\ndiscredited as based on an unreliable source.^[2] German psychiatrist Justus\nHecker (1865) did give an original interpretation of the crusade, but it was a\npolemic about \"diseased religious emotionalism\" that has since been\ndiscredited.^[2]\n\nP. Alphandery (1916) first published his ideas about the crusade in 1916 in an\narticle which was later published in book form in 1959. He considered the\nstory of the crusade to be an expression of the medieval cult of the\nInnocents, as a sort of sacrificial rite in which the Innocents gave\nthemselves up for the good of Christendom; however, he based his ideas on some\nof the most untrustworthy sources.^[8]\n\nAdolf Waas (1956) saw the Children's Crusade as a manifestation of chivalric\npiety and as a protest against the glorification of the holy war.^[9] H. E.\nMayer (1960) further developed Alphandery's ideas of the Innocents, saying\nchildren were the chosen people of God because they were the poorest;\nrecognizing the cult of poverty, he said that \"the Children's Crusade marked\nboth the triumph and the failure of the idea of poverty.\"^[10] Giovanni\nMiccoli (1961) was the first to note that the contemporary sources did not\nportray the participants as children. It was this recognition that undermined\nall other interpretations,^[11] except perhaps that of Norman Cohn (1957) who\nsaw it as a chiliastic movement in which the poor tried to escape the misery\nof their everyday lives.^[12] In his book Children's Crusade: Medieval\nHistory, Modern Mythistory (2008), Gary Dickson discusses the growing number\nof \"impossibilist\" movements across Western Europe at the time. Infamous for\ntheir shunning of any form of wealth and refusing to join a monastery, they\nwould travel in groups and rely upon small donations or meals from those who\nlistened to their sermons to survive. Excommunicated by the Pope, they were\nforced to wander and likely made up a large portion of what is called the\n\"Children's Crusade\". After the crusade failed, the Pope stated that the\ndevotees of Nicholas and Stephen had shamed all of the Christian leaders.^[13]\n\nHistorians have put the crusade in the context of the role of teenage boys in\nmedieval warfare.^[14] Literary scholars have explored its role in the\nevolution of the tale of the Pied Piper.^[15]\n\n### Popular accounts[edit]\n\nBeyond the scientific studies there are many popular versions and theories\nabout the Children's Crusades. Norman Zacour in the survey A History of the\nCrusades (1962) generally follows Munro's conclusions, and adds that there was\na psychological instability of the age, concluding the Children's Crusade\n\"remains one of a series of social explosions, through which medieval men and\nwomen\u2014and children too\u2014found release\".\n\nSteven Runciman gives an account of the Children's Crusade in his A History of\nthe Crusades.^[16] Raedts notes that \"Although he cites Munro's article in his\nnotes, his narrative is so wild that even the unsophisticated reader might\nwonder if he had really understood it.\" Donald Spoto, in a 2002 book about\nSaint Francis of Assisi, said monks were motivated to call them children, and\nnot wandering poor, because being poor was considered pious and the Church was\nembarrassed by its wealth in contrast to the poor. This, according to Spoto,\nbegan a literary tradition from which the popular legend of children\noriginated. This idea closely follows H. E. Mayer.\n\n### Revisionism[edit]\n\nThe Dutch historian Peter Raedts, in a study published in 1977, was the first\nto cast doubt on the traditional narrative of these events. Many historians\ncame to believe that they were not (or not primarily) children, but multiple\nbands of \"wandering poor\" in Germany and France. This comes in large part from\nthe words \"parvuli\" or \"infantes\" found in two accounts of the event from\nWilliam of Andres and Alberic of Troisfontaines. No other accounts from the\ntime period suggest an age at all, but the connotation with the two words give\nan entirely separate meaning. Medieval writers often split up a life into four\nmajor parts with a variety of age ranges associated to them. The Church then\nco-opted this classification to a societal coding, with the expression\nreferring to wage workers or labourers who were young and had no inheritance.\nThe Chronica regia Coloniensis, written in 1213 (a year after the crusade was\nsaid to have taken place), refers to crusaders having \"left the plows or carts\nwhich they were driving, [and] the flocks which they were pasturing\", adding\nto the idea of it being not \"puerti\" the age, but \"puerti\" the societal\nmoniker. Another spelling, pueri, translates precisely into children, but\nindirectly means \"the powerless\". A number of them tried to reach the Holy\nLand but others never intended to do so. Early accounts of events, of which\nthere are many variations told over the centuries, are, according to this\ntheory, largely apocryphal.^[clarification needed]^[2]^[1]\n\nRaedts \"wandering poor\" without children account was revised in 2008 by Gary\nDickson who maintained that while it was not made up entirely of actual\nchildren, they did exist and played a key role.^[13]^[17]\n\n## In the arts[edit]\n\nThis article may contain irrelevant references to popular culture.
