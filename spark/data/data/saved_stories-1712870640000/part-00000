An algorithm\ndivides the image in a grid and creates a cut map with the NFT address encoded\nin it.\n\nThe piece of art is destroyed according to the cut map. The whole process is\nfilmed and witnessed by an art expert who certifies the authenticity of the\nartwork.\n\nThe resulting pieces are arranged on an empty canvas, which can be scanned to\nget the address of the NFT as a proof of destruction of the real artwork. We\npublish the NFT on OpenSea.\n\n# Looking forward to be part of Sublimart?\n\n## Send your data and we will get in touch shortly.\n\nSublimart\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nArt Digital Migration |\n\nArt Digital Migration |\n\nArt Digital Migration |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nArt Digital Migration |\n\nArt Digital Migration |\n\nArt Digital Migration |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\nSublimart | Sublimart |\n\n", "frontpage": false}
