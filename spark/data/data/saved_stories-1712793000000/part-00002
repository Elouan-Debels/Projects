Our maximum likelihood model leverages expert-\n> written and AI-generated reference texts to accurately and efficiently\n> examine real-world LLM-use at the corpus level. We apply this approach to a\n> case study of scientific peer review in AI conferences that took place after\n> the release of ChatGPT: ICLR 2024, NeurIPS 2023, CoRL 2023 and EMNLP 2023.\n> Our results suggest that between 6.5% and 16.9% of text submitted as peer\n> reviews to these conferences could have been substantially modified by LLMs,\n> i.e. beyond spell-checking or minor writing updates. The circumstances in\n> which generated text occurs offer insight into user behavior: the estimated\n> fraction of LLM-generated text is higher in reviews which report lower\n> confidence, were submitted close to the deadline, and from reviewers who are\n> less likely to respond to author rebuttals. We also observe corpus-level\n> trends in generated text which may be too subtle to detect at the individual\n> level, and discuss the implications of such trends on peer review. We call\n> for future interdisciplinary work to examine how LLM use is changing our\n> information and knowledge practices.\n\nComments:| 42 pages, 30 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)  \nACM classes:| I.2.7  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.07183 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2403.07183v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.07183arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yaohui Zhang [view email] [v1] Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:51:39 UTC (570 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Monitoring AI-Modified Content at Scale: A Case\nStudy on the Impact of ChatGPT on AI Conference Peer Reviews, by Weixin Liang\nand 11 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2403\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG cs.SI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
