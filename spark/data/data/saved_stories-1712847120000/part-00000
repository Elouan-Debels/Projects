Sites\nbeing de-indexed, significant drops in traffic, AI-written content being\ntargeted - it\u2019s been easy to think that this is the end of SEO.\n\nBut here's the issue; those headlines don't tell the whole story.\n\nIn fact, they're a prime example of selection bias, where the most dramatic\nstories get the most attention. To move beyond the bias and really understand\nwhat's happened in this update, we need to look at the data objectively.\n\nThat's exactly what I\u2019ve done at Byword. I\u2019ve crunched the numbers on data\nfrom over 5,000 of our users' sites to see how they've been affected, and how\nfactors like site size and topic have played into traffic changes.\n\nI\u2019ve even found a unique factor that appears to correlate strongly with the\nsites that have seen drops after the last update.\n\nSo, let's take a look and see what the numbers really say.\n\n###\n\nThe Data\n\nFor this analysis, we anonymized and aggregated top-level stats from pre-\nprepared Search Console reports in Byword.\n\nThis means we're looking at real traffic data, not just estimates like some\nother tools use.\n\nWe compared month-on-month traffic for over 5,000 sites from February to March\n2024, scaling the data to account for the extra days in March and discarding\ndata from sites with fewer than 100 monthly sessions.\n\n###\n\nThe Results\n\nSo, did traffic actually drop from February to March?\n\nPerhaps, but barely. The overall drop across all sites was just 1.5%.\n\nThe image below is a histogram of the data, i.e. a graph which places each\nsite into a bucket based on its change in traffic, and shows the number of\nsites in each bucket.\n\nThe y-axis shows the number of sites in a particular bucket, and the x-axis\nshows the bucket limits, measure in percentage change in traffic (from\nFebruary to March).\n\nLooking at the distribution of traffic changes across domains, it's clear that\nthe vast majority of sites saw no sizeable change. In fact, 78% of sites had\nless than a 20% change in traffic, which is well within the sort of\nfluctuations that most sites see on a monthly basis.\n\n###\n\nWhat About Site Size and Content Type?\n\nSome have claimed that the March update was designed to shift traffic from\nsmaller sites to larger ones.\n\nOur data doesn't support this.\n\nThe graph above breaks down February to March traffic change, split by monthly\nsite click volume. The small sites are on the left, with the big sites on the\nright.\n\nWhile sites with a million-plus monthly clicks did see a small increase,\nthere's no evidence that the smallest sites were hit the hardest. The numbers\nare so small that site size likely played no role in the update.\n\nWe also used an AI model to categorize sites by content type, based on their\nhomepages.\n\nAgain, there were no clear trends indicating that Google targeted specific\ntypes of sites or content. Some verticals like Food and Cooking fared slightly\nbetter than others like Business and Finance, but nothing conclusive.\n\n####\n\nThe Surprising Finding\n\nHere's where things get interesting.\n\nWhen we initially ran the content type analysis, we had a \"Not Applicable\"\ncategory for sites where the LLM couldn't determine a clear content focus.\n\nThese sites, which covered a broad range of topics, performed significantly\nworse than all other categories. They saw a 26.4% drop in traffic between\nFebruary and March, significantly underperforming all other categories.\n\nThis finding aligns with the advice I've given since launching Byword: focus\nyour content on specific niches.\n\nThe temptation to cover every tangentially related topic is strong with AI\nwriting tools, but it's a risky strategy. Every Byword site we've seen hit by\nprevious updates was guilty of this.\n\nRe-running the numbers without these unfocused sites, we found that overall\ntraffic was actually up 6.2% month-on-month. The remaining 82% of Byword sites\nhad a fairly positive month, despite the post-update panic on social media.\n\n###\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSo, what can we learn from this?\n\n  1. Don't believe the hype. Selection bias means you're more likely to see horror stories than success stories after an update.\n\n  2. The March update was pretty uneventful. A 1.5% drop or 6.2% rise (depending on how you slice it) is nothing to write home about.\n\n  3. Focus your content on specific niches. Trying to cover every topic under the sun is a recipe for disaster, even with AI tools.\n\nThe March update may have caused some SEOs to lose sleep, but the data tells a\nmuch less dramatic story.\n\nKeep creating focused, high-quality content, and don't let the scary headlines\ndistract you from your long-term strategy.\n\nMack\n\nShare this post\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n\nWritten by\n\nMack Grenfell\n\nMack is the founder of byword.ai, and has been writing about the intersection\nof AI & SEO since 2020.\n\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Try Byword for free\n  * Blog Home\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * RSS Feed\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 byword.ai - All Rights Reserved\n\n", "frontpage": false}
