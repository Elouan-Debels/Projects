Carril/ESA\n\naerospace european space agency space telescopes solar eclipse spacecraft\nmetrology\n\nThe European Space Agency will launch a mission late this year to demonstrate\nprecision formation flying in orbit to create artificial solar eclipses. In a\npress conference last week, the agency announced details of the mission and\nthe technology the orbiters will use to pull off its exquisitely-choreographed\nmaneuvers.\n\nESA\u2019s Proba-3 (PRoject for On-Board Autonomy) consists of a pair of\nspacecraft: a 300-kilogram Coronagraph spacecraft and a 250-kilogram Occulter.\nThe pair are now slated to launch on an Indian PSLV rocket in September and\nultimately enter a highly elliptical, 600-by-60,530-kilometer orbit. The aim,\nthe agency says, is to move the separate spacecraft to some 144 meters apart,\nwith the Occulter, as a disc, blocking out the sun.\n\nAchieving this formation will allow the Coronagraph to study our star\u2019s highly\nionized, extremely hot atmosphere\u2014but also demonstrate the technology as a\nprecursor for more ambitious, future, formation-flying endeavors.\n\nProba-3\u2019s disk-shaped Occulter spacecraft was designed to block the Sun for\nthe Coronagraph spacecraft. P. Sebirot/ESA\n\nSolar eclipses represent both spectacular alignments of celestial bodies and\nmoments of stark beauty. They are also fleeting opportunities to conduct\nscience. The element helium was first detected in the Sun\u2019s chromosphere by a\nFrench astronomer in India during a 1868 total solar eclipse in India. Fifty\nyears later, British astronomers Frank Dyson and Arthur Eddington performed\nmeasurements of the apparent shift of stars during a 1919 solar eclipse as an\nearly test of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\n\nESA has science objectives for Proba-3, using observations made in space to\nstudy solar astrophysics without any intervention of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe agency\u2019s Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging\nInvestigation of the Corona of the Sun (ASPIICS) coronagraph will help to\ndiscern why the solar corona is significantly hotter than the Sun itself. This\ncould further our understanding of the Sun and assist solar weather\npredictions.\n\nHowever, it is the precision formation flying that Proba-3 aims to demonstrate\nwhich could help unlock future breakthroughs.\n\nProba-3\u2019s Coronagraph spacecraft hosts the mission\u2019s ASPIICS instrument to\nobserve the solar corona.P. Sebirot/ESA\n\nThe two spacecraft will align to create eclipses for around six hours per\norbit, starting on approach to its farthest point from Earth (apogee). The two\nspacecraft will use radio inter-satellite links to communicate, and star\ntrackers will be used by both craft for determining their attitude.\n\nGlobal navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers will pick up GPS signals\naround perigee, or the closest point to Earth, which, when combined with a\ndedicated relative navigation algorithm, will allow regular determination of\ntheir relative positions. Optical sensors on the Occulter will view pulsing\nLEDs on the Coronagraph to provide data for finer measurements. But greater,\nmillimeter-scale precision requires more technological wizardry still.\n\n### How Proba-3 can achieve millimeter-scale orbital precision\n\nFor this, the Occulter will ping a laser at a corner cube retro-reflector\nmounted on the Coronagraph spacecraft, which will bounce the beam back. This\nact of metrology will allow precise tracking of the relative position and\norientation of the two spacecraft. Using the data gathered, the craft can, the\nESA says, control and maintain millimeter-level accuracy using 10 millinewton-\nscale cold gas thrusters aboard the Occulter.\n\n\u201cGuidance, navigation and control has undergone a lot of development and this\nis what we all want to demonstrate,\u201d Damien Galano, Proba-3 Project Manager,\nsaid during a press briefing on 3 April.\n\n\u201cWe have an actual application which is observation of the corona. So, by\nachieving really good observations of the corona, we would definitely\ndemonstrate that all these equipment are working and that the technology is\ndelivering actual science data,\u201d he said, adding that Proba-3 formation flying\ncontrol algorithms and metrology systems that could be applied to future\nmissions.\n\nPrecisely-controlled Occulter spacecraft could be used with space telescopes\nto block light from a star in order to directly detect potential orbiting\nplanets, while a constellation of spacecraft can, through interferometry,\ncreate large-scale observatories, achieving large apertures and long focal\nlengths than possible with large solo satellites.\n\nFurther applications include Earth observation, space-based gravitational wave\ndetection, and a range of missions in which two or more spacecraft need to\ninteract, such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing.\n\nBefore such complex projects can be undertaken, Proba-3 needs to prove it can\nnail the basics. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly the operational challenge,\u201d said Dietmar\nPilz, ESA Director of Technology, Engineering and Quality. \u201cTo see how far we\ncan get the formation flying, what are the distances that we can achieve. This\nneeds a lot of operational expertise and software from all the partners that\nare in this project.\u201d\n\nIf successful, Proba-3 could both surpass the work of previous space\ncoronagraphs and illuminate paths for future complex space operations.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Satellites Are Becoming the New Cellphone Towers \u203a\n  * Amazon Reports Collision Risk for Mega-Constellation of Kuiper Internet Satellites \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Satellite Constellations | IAU \u203a\n\naerospaceeuropean space agencyspace telescopessolar eclipsespacecraftmetrology\n\nAndrew Jones\n\nis a freelance journalist based near Helsinki.
