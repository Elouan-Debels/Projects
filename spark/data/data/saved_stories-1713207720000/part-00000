The internet largely resolved this problem\u2014and\nthe pandemic made it much less likely random people would get in your personal\nspace\u2014but there was a \u201cmushy middle\u201d issue that needed to be solved in the\ndays before the internet was a thing. How can everyone actually work together\non these personal computers without a mainframe? The answer was groupware, an\nearly term for collaborative software designed to work across multiple\ncomputers in a network. At first, those multiple computers were located in the\nsame office. Then, the canvas expanded from there, but in the midst of that,\nwe got Microsoft\u2019s first true attempt to embrace networking. Today\u2019s Tedium\ntalks about groupware, workgroups, and the strangest release of Windows this\nside of Me. \u2014 Ernie @ Tedium\n\nSponsored By TLDR\n\nWant a byte-sized version of Hacker News?

On top of obvious\ninnovations like the mouse, the NLS approach highlighted numerous aspects that\nwould become essential to groupware, including videoconferencing, the client-\nserver architecture, and version control.

There\u2019s just one problem: You have a bunch\nof computers, but they don\u2019t necessarily talk to one another.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s right in the name, after all: Personal computers.\n\nIn the mainframe era, it was understood that machines were so complex and\nexpensive that their resources needed to be spread among many people. But when\ncomputers were self-contained on a desk, that replicated a new kind of\nproblem.\n\nThink about this in terms of large companies vs. small: If you run a small\noffice and need to share a file, that\u2019s one thing. You can just hand a disk\noff to someone on the other side of the room. But what if you\u2019re an enterprise\ncompany, and the person you need to collaborate with is on the other side of\nthe country? That doesn\u2019t work anymore. That means you\u2019re still stuck with\nmainframes, fax machines, and TPS reports.\n\nTechnologies, simply put, needed to be more collaborative, so they could take\ninput from a large group of people inside an office, so files could be shared\nand distributed, and information could be tweaked and mashed into its final\nform, with everyone getting sign-off.\n\nEarly on, there was an understanding that collaborative working styles would\nbecome increasingly necessary over time, with no less an authority than\nDouglas \u201cThe Mother of All Demos\u201d Engelbart making some of the earliest high-\nprofile efforts on this front. In the late 1980s, at a point when the PC had\nbegun to dominate the workplace, Engelbart was less than impressed with what\nwas lost in the process. As he wrote (with Harvey Lehtman) in Byte in 1988:\n\n> The emergence of the personal computer as a major presence in the 1970s and\n> 1980s led to tremendous increases in personal productivity and creativity.\n> It also caused setbacks in the development of tools aimed at increasing\n> organizational effectiveness\u2014tools developed on the older time-sharing\n> systems.\n>\n> To some extent, the personal computer was a reaction to the overloaded and\n> frustrating time-sharing systems of the day. In emphasizing the power of the\n> individual, the personal computer revolution turned its back on those tools\n> that led to the empowering of both co-located and distributed work groups\n> collaborating simultaneously and over time on common knowledge work.\n>\n> The introduction of local- and wide-area networks into the personal computer\n> environment and the development of mail systems are leading toward some of\n> the directions explored on the earlier systems. However, some of the\n> experiences of those earlier pioneering systems should be considered anew in\n> evolving newer collaborative environments.\n\nEssentially, the PC right-sized the computer for the individual at the cost of\nthe organization, which had advantages and disadvantages. One of the biggest\nadvantages is that the interface was streamlined, so it made more sense for\nthe end user and was better tailored to their needs. But on the other hand, it\nmade little room for the team.\n\nI understand why Engelbart felt the need to speak up when he did. He had\ndeveloped some of the earliest examples of collaborative software, known early\non as \u201ccomputer-supported cooperative work\u201d (the starting point for an acronym\nonly PCMCIA fans could love), only to see the lessons lost when we effectively\nrebuilt the computer industry from scratch, so our machines were smaller than\nbread boxes.\n\nEventually, Engelbart became known as the \u201cfather of groupware,\u201d and thank\nheavens, too\u2014groupware is a much nicer term for what collaborative software\ndoes, even if academics hold more love for computer-supported cooperative\nwork.\n\nGroupware was starting to finally catch on in the late 1980s, with\ncompanies\u2014taken in by the idea of \u201corchestrating work teams,\u201d as an Infoworld\npiece put it in 1988\u2014putting a lot of resources against this trend.\n\nIt was also a great way for independent software companies to stand out, as it\nwas an area that large companies had basically ignored\u2014in particular,\nMicrosoft. The company, which was beginning to shape productivity software and\noperating systems, is known today as the 800-pound gorilla of collaboration\nthanks to its combination of Teams and Office 365. But it took them a while to\nget there.\n\nAnd a big part of the reason for that comes down to the tentative steps the\ncompany took on the networking front. Put simply, Microsoft was late to the\ncollaboration game because it was late to the networking game. And one company\nin particular was well-positioned to take advantage of the opening.\n\n### 1989\n\nThe year Lotus Development Corporation released the initial version of its\nLotus Notes software, later sold under the name IBM Notes. Notes was built\nwith a client-server setup, and relied on the Domino server package. While\nLotus was long best known for its Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, considered one of\nthe first killer applications, it is ultimately Notes that came to define the\ncompany, and the application that led to IBM buying Lotus in 1995 in a deal\nthat, at the time, was the largest of its kind. (Likewise, when Novell bought\nthe similarly positioned WordPerfect in 1994, their collaboration suite,\nGroupwise, was the only part they ultimately kept when they sold it in 1996.)\nWhile the software has faded from view, it is surprisingly active to this day,\nwith the product sold by HCLSoftware under the name HCL Domino in 2024.\n\nWhat Lotus Notes looked like upon its initial release. (via Mat Newman)\n\n### The company that caught the groupware wave at just the right time\n\nLotus did not invent the groupware concept\u2014on top of Engelbart\u2019s formative\nwork at Stanford, the term had been around since at least 1980, per\nInfoworld\u2014but it was the company that made it worth everyone\u2019s attention.\n\nAnd the person perhaps most associated with that development was Ray Ozzie.\nOzzie, who was recruited to work at Lotus after spending time working on the\nearly spreadsheet VisiCalc, essentially built out what became Notes while\nworking at Iris Associates, a direct offshoot of Lotus formed to develop the\nNotes application.\n\nIris, essentially a skunkworks operation funded by Lotus in its early years,\ndeveloped Notes in stealth mode. The product came to life fully formed in\n1989.\n\nOzzie, a graduate of the University of Illinois, was directly inspired by the\nPLATO system, an early local network system at the university that pioneered\nmany early collaboration technologies and was often considered one of the\nfirst internet-like networks. As he explained to Y Combinator co-founder\nJessica Livingston in her book Founders At Work, Notes represented his vision\nfor the \u201cmarket roadmap as to where things are headed\u201d in the mid-1980s:\n\n> In Notes, it was (and this is hard to imagine because it was a different\n> time) the concept that we\u2019d all be using computers on our desktops, and\n> therefore we might want to use them as communication tools. This was a time\n> when PCs were just emerging as spreadsheet tools and word processing\n> replacements, still available only on a subset of desks, and definitely no\n> networks. It was \u201982 when I wrote the specs for it. It had been based on a\n> system called PLATO that I\u2019d been exposed to at college, which was a large-\n> scale interactive system that people did learning and interactive gaming on,\n> and things like that. It gave us a little bit of a peek at the future\u2014what\n> it would be like if we all had access to interactive systems and technology.\n\nThe idea of building an application based on PLATO turned out to be the right\nidea at the right time, because it gave Lotus an edge in the market by the\ntime of Notes\u2019 1989 release.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThe application, as highlighted in a demo on the Computer Chronicles in the\nfall of 1989, included an obvious example of collaborative software in the\nform of email, but as Lotus Notes General Manager Brownell Chalstrom noted,\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a document distribution and management system.\u201d\n\nAs an all-in-one platform built for scale, Notes gained a strong reputation as\nan early example of what today would be called a \u201cbusiness transformation\u201d\ntool, a tool that managed many elements of collaboration. It was also\ncomplicated and required a significant investment to maintain, which means it\nwas built for scale. In a way, what Notes did that was perhaps most\ngroundbreaking from a computing standpoint was that it helped turn PCs into an\nenterprise play just as prominent as it was during the mainframe era.\n\nAs Fortune noted in 1994, the company had a massive lead in the groupware\nspace, in part because the software worked essentially the same anywhere in\nthe network, a concept we take for granted now, but back then was considered\nmagical:\n\n> Like Lotus 1-2-3, Notes is easy to customize. A sales organization, for\n> instance, might use it to set up an electronic bulletin board that lets\n> people pool information about prospective clients. If some of the info is\n> confidential, it can be restricted so not everyone can call it up.\n>\n> Notes makes such homegrown applications and the data they contain accessible\n> throughout an organization. The electronic bulletin board you consult in\n> Singapore is identical to the one your counterparts see in Sioux City, Iowa.\n> The key to this universality is a procedure called replication, by which\n> Notes copies information from computer to computer throughout the network.\n> You might say Ozzie figured out how to make the machines telepathic\u2014each\n> knows what the others are thinking.\n>\n> This hidden feature is the one that has most bedeviled programmers at\n> Microsoft and other companies as they\u2019ve sought to imitate Notes.\n\nThe article reported that around 4,000 major companies had purchased Notes.\nWhile it wasn\u2019t dominant in the way Windows was, its momentum was hard to\nignore.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nA commerical for Notes, dating to 1996, highlighting its collaboration with\nFedEx. Other commercials would use Denis Leary or be highly conceptual,\nrarely, if ever, showing the software.\n\n\u201cThe list of big Notes customers reads like a who\u2019s who of corporate America:\nChase Manhattan, Compaq Computer, Delta Air Lines, Fluor, General Motors,\nHarley Davidson, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, J.P. Morgan, Nynex,\nSybase, and 3M, just to name a few,\u201d the article stated.\n\n(At least some of those companies are still relevant and active under those\nnames. Maybe Notes helped.)\n\nThe most important company on that list turned out to be IBM, which ended up\nbuying Lotus just a year after that Fortune piece, almost entirely to get a\nhold of Notes. (Lotus was ready to sell. The switch to Windows decimated sales\nof its desktop software lineup.) While IBM eventually outgrew Notes as\ncompanies like Microsoft and Google effectively supplanted the product, it\nproved the bridge between the company IBM was before the rise of the personal\ncomputer and the one it became after.\n\nIt was common to read stories about how Notes reshaped businesses large and\nsmall. A 1996 Inc. piece, for example, highlighted how a natural foods company\nsuccessfully produced a new product in just eight months, a feat the company\ndirectly credited to Notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become our general manager,\u201d Groveland Trading Co. President Steve\nMcDonnell recalled.\n\nNotes wasn\u2019t cheap, and it was a complicated tool to manage. But results like\nthat were immensely hard to ignore. Even Microsoft eventually noticed\u2014and they\nwanted in.\n\n### \u201cSome technologies do not depend upon widespread acceptance for their\nvalue. A wonderful nonstick frying pan is useful even if you\u2019re the only\nperson who ever buys one. But for communications and other products that\ninvolve collaboration, much of the product\u2019s value comes from its widespread\ndeployment. Given a choice between a beautiful, handcrafted mailbox with an\nopening that would accommodate only one size envelope, and an old carton that\neveryone routinely dropped all mail and messages for you into, you\u2019d choose\nthe one with broader access. You would choose compatibility.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bill Gates, writing in his book The Road Ahead about how compatibility,\nparticularly in collaborative settings, shapes computing. The book highlighted\nhow Gates was seen as an innovator on all things tech, despite the fact that,\nwell, on the collaboration trend and the internet trend, Microsoft was a bit\nlate.\n\nWere you a Workgroups fanatic back in the day? (Daltrois/Flickr)\n\n### Windows for Workgroups didn\u2019t beat groupware, but became the engine on\nwhich the future of Windows was built\n\nMicrosoft had high hopes for Windows for Workgroups, the networking-focused\nvariant of its popular Windows 3.1 software suite. The company pulled out all\nthe stops. Seriously.\n\nIn the fall of 1992, Microsoft paid something like $2 million to put on a\nBroadway production with Bill Gates at the center, at New York\u2019s Gershwin\nTheater. It sounds like a wild event, and yet, somehow, there is no video of\nthis event currently online, despite some photos existing to show it happened.\n\nThere should be video of this. (via Infoworld)\n\nA 1992 Washington Post article describes the nature of the event: Put on at\nNew York\u2019s Gershwin Theater, the $2 million performance required the use of\ndozens of actors, some of whom were dressed like the Blues Brothers, and some\ncheesy set pieces. At one point, Gates did jumping jacks.\n\nThere may be a reason video doesn\u2019t exist of it online\u2014apparently everyone\nagrees it was bad! Gates himself later said, \u201cThat was so bad, I thought\nBallmer was going to retch.\u201d\n\n(The only person I know of who has a copy of this video, no longer online, is\nfittingly enough Ray Ozzie, the groupware guru and Notes inventor who later\nserved as a top executive at Microsoft, famously replacing Bill Gates as Chief\nSoftware Architect in the mid-2000s. I reached out to him for this piece, but\ndidn\u2019t hear back from him. Hopefully he likes it enough that he decides to\ngrace us with Gates on Broadway.)\n\nNo two ways about it, despite this attempt at fanfare, Windows for Workgroups\nwas not a hit. While Windows 3.1 was dominant, Microsoft had built a program\nthat didn\u2019t seem to capture the burgeoning interest in collaborative work in a\nreal way. Among other things, it didn\u2019t initially support TCP/IP, despite the\nfact that it was the networking technology that was winning the market and\nenabled the rise of the internet, an emerging technology at the time.\n\nIn its original version, it carried such a negative reputation in Microsoft\u2019s\nown headquarters that the company nicknamed it Windows for Warehouses, hinting\nat the company\u2019s largely unsold inventory, according to the company\u2019s own lore\nexpert, Raymond Chen.\n\nBut in a way, the fact that it existed in the first place hinted at\nMicrosoft\u2019s general acknowledgement that perhaps this networking thing was\ngoing to catch on with its users.\n\nLaunched in late 1992, a few months after Windows 3.1 itself, the product was\nMicrosoft\u2019s first attempt at integrated networking in a Windows package. The\nsoftware enabled file-sharing across servers, printer sharing, and email\u2014table\nstakes in the modern day, but at the time a big deal.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nA very accurate view of what it was like to use Windows in 1994.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a big deal that came a few years late. The concept was\nconsidered so lukewarm on Microsoft\u2019s part that the company had to update it\nto Windows for Workgroups 3.11, whose marquee feature wasn\u2019t network support,\nbut increased disk speed. Confusingly, the company had just released Windows\nNT by this point, a program that better matched the needs of the enterprise.\n\nMicrosoft Office saw success against WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. But the team\nin Redmond initially let the groupware trend pass them by. Notes and other\ngroupware tools had all the energy from the actual get-work-done standpoint,\nand Microsoft would have to develop other approaches to collaboration, such as\nMicrosoft Exchange, to fill the gap. That tool, released in 1996, was referred\nto as Microsoft\u2019s \u201cNotes-buster\u201d in Fortune\u2019s 1994 feature on Lotus Notes.\nWhile it didn\u2019t capture the hearts of the business world quite like Notes,\nit\u2019s hard to ignore Exchange\u2019s eventual dominance.\n\nThe workgroup terminology Microsoft introduced with Windows for Workgroups\nstuck around, and is actually used throughout Windows to this day. That said,\nthe meaning hits like a bad memory at this point. Microsoft eventually won,\nbut it took them a few tries.\n\nIt\u2019s weird how much we take collaboration for granted now. Google Docs, Teams,\nSlack? Again, table stakes.\n\nBut thinking broadly, the concepts that Notes and other groupware tools forged\nended up shaping lots of tools we use to function. For example, one can see\nthe single-source-of-truth approach to Notes in tools that look nothing like\nit\u2014for example, anything based on git. Applications like Figma have roots in\ncreative software, but also in groupware. Traditional software, like Photoshop\nand Microsoft Office, now have groupware elements tacked on, and have for\nyears. And cloud applications, in many cases, are basically groupware without\nthe on-site server or the expensive IT team orchestrating the workplace\nmusical.\n\nNow, sure, we can see groupware\u2019s beating heart in more traditional senses.\nSalesforce wouldn\u2019t exist, for example, without Notes. And enterprise\napplications as big as Notes, if not bigger, dominate that market.\n\nBut the toolkit also became absolutely pervasive in every part of computing\nlife, thanks to the internet. In just a few years, networking went from a nice\nto have, to an expectation. And not just among businesses\u2014but everyone. I\nthink we can credit the trickle-down of innovation for that.\n\nIn 2024, group-oriented software feels like the default, and single-user apps\nthe anomaly. Over time, groupware became so common, so pervasive, that we no\nlonger think of it as groupware. Now, it\u2019s just software. Groupware got us\nthrough the pandemic, even if we never used the word \u201cgroupware\u201d to describe\nit once.\n\nGroupware did its job so well that it\u2019s everywhere\u2014and we don\u2019t even think\nabout it anymore.\n\n\\--\n\nFind this one an interesting read?
