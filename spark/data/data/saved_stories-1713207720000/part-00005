Artificial Intelligence will do\nit for us. What should we do with all the free time? Paint? Play chess? Write\nmusic? Well, AI could do that for us, too. Maybe we should give our best at\nwhat AI simply cannot do in our place: we should think.\n\nFor 13 billion USD, Microsoft got hold of 49% of OpenAI.^2 Microsoft now plans\nto integrate ChatGPT into Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. Today, the\nmajority of business matters are still written in MS Office. As things stand,\nsoon, ChatGPT will make our economy\u2019s heart beat. As an employee, your job\nwill suddenly become very easy. You can automate most of it. To make sure that\neverything goes as planned, you monitor it from the sidelines, and when\nnecessary, you\u2019ll type in a couple of fuzzy commands to guide it in the right\ndirection.\n\nChatGPT can read your emails, process your documents and answer your requests\nfor you. It\u2019s only a matter of time, until ChatGPT graduates from Office to\nWindows itself, runs the whole system, and makes your apps feel like the\nprograms you used to run from cassette tapes.^1 Did Microsoft really think\nthis through? Because...\n\nSooner than later, Artificial Intelligence will get rid of Windows, too, yeah,\nforget laptops, desktops, and monitors... Artificial Intelligence will run\neverything from a phone, or a watch, or, a precious little finger ring. AI\nwill do everything for you in a galaxy of clouds far, far away, through an\nultra-light client in slightly over 12 parsecs.\n\n## It looks like the road to Heaven...^2\n\nYou\u2019ve heard it before: AI might have the power to radically change society,\nstreamlining business processes, market communication, and challenging\ntraditional hierarchies.\n\n  * The end of apps: If ChatGPT is the centerpiece of all apps, you don\u2019t need them, you just need a couple of plugins that render your processed barks.\n  * The end of business communication: If no one writes or reads emails, Slacks, or Trellos anymore, we might as well stop sending them altogether.\n  * The end of bosses: If everyone uses the same brain, we don\u2019t need anyone telling us what to do.\n\nInstead of typing boring requests in Outlook, instead of cropping stock\nimagery and power pointing the newest Lego-block business-clich\u00e9s, instead of\nbraining up Word memos that no one will read, you can give your computer a\ncouple of approximate orders and the machine processes the text for you.\nWorking on a screen has never been this easy. So... take it easy. It was all\nbullshit anyways. AI will catapult the existing business circus into a\nSpaceballs dimension.\n\nThe briefings, meetings, memos, proposals, timesheets and invoices, the\ndeliverables, code and code reviews, the marketing campaigns, and analytics...\nWork on the screen has all been a simulation of itself before AI started\nsimulating them. Time to leave the simulation of simulations to the machines.\nLet them print money while you focus on things that matter.\n\n## ...but it could be the road to hell\n\nIn a darker corner of the same future, machines simulating work,\nindividuality, and the recognition of language\u2019s limitations challenge the\nnecessity of traditional income, personal identity, and verbal communication\nas a whole.\n\n  * The end of income: What do we need work for when a machine simulates work better than yourself?\n  * The end of you: What do we need you for when a machine simulates you better than yourself?\n  * The end of language: If we all know that language is not real, we don\u2019t need to speak anymore.\n\nIf no one understands what no one thought, and no one reads what no one has\nwritten, we may as well abolish the whole circus of language and enjoy the\nsilence. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice? Jokes aside, it looks like AI devalues all\nproductivity apps, not just the Office Suite, but work on the computer is\ngetting superfluous.^3 Screen work has been hit by a Weimar scale inflation.\n\n## Time to Think and Rethink\n\nIf artificial intelligence frees us from business as usual, what will we do\nwith all our free time? Play chess? Paint in oil? Compose symphonies? Read a\nprinted book? Write on paper? Maybe we do nothing. Maybe we just take it easy.\nOr maybe it\u2019s time to get real, think, and rethink what we know, what we do,\nwhat we aim at and who we are.^4\n\n### What can we know?\n\nAI has made clear that, to a large degree, we all simulate knowledge and\nmeaning. AI is so good at simulating school and business language because a\nlot of our own understanding in both spheres is largely simulated.\n\nBut to the same degree that AI has made clear how much of our own knowledge is\nsimulated, it can also teach us by counterexample to be more real. AI makes\nperfectly clear how text sounds and feels and it is just simulated knowledge.\n\nIf you have worked with ChatGPT for some time you will recognize its patterns.\nWorking with simulated intelligence can\u2014if you\u2019re not too lazy\u2014make you better\nat being yourself, stop pretending to know what you don\u2019t know, make you take\ncare not to express what you don\u2019t feel, and only give shape to words that you\nhave felt.\n\n### What should we do?\n\nIt has become a lot easier to program, market, learn and write content. It has\nbecome a lot easier to simulate understanding.\n\nNow, you can let Artificial Intelligence do boring tasks for you. You can let\nit speak for you, when you don\u2019t care that much. Independent, of what you\nallow it to do, it can\u2019t think and feel for you. So as a guideline, you\nshouldn\u2019t let AI take decisions for you. On the contrary, using AI you need to\nthink harder, deeper, clearer. You have more time now, so use it to do what\nthe machine cannot. Use them reasonably. Know what you say. Question your\nunderstanding. Use AI as a workout to make sure that what you say is what you\nknow and mean to say.\n\nWe need to rethink ourselves\u2014and we need to observe AI. And we need to observe\nit now, as it still makes obvious mistakes and reveals through its bugs how it\nworks. Once it simulates us perfectly, we won\u2019t understand it at all anymore.\nWe won\u2019t be able to discern it from us and understand how it works.\n\nRight now, and that not something one should say lightly, AI acts a lot like\ncancer. It grows uncontrolled out of our organic knowledge, and it grows where\nthat organic knowledge already has developed some carcinogenic tissue.\nVisually, AI generated pictures often look like a form of cancer. The current\nDall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion pictures do not convey a healthy, meaningful,\nand happy world. It\u2019s one dark horror show of stuff growing out of what used\nto be organic. Soon, this will change and AI-engineers will learn to simulate\nhappy images.\n\nWhat should we do? It\u2019s always easier to say what we shouldn\u2019t do. We\ncertainly shouldn\u2019t let a machine generate random patterns and then let other\npeople use their time and energy to understand them. What, again by\ncounterexample, we should probably do is use AI for ourselves, to be more, not\nless, human, to take care that what we say makes sense. We should use our time\nwith AI to waste less of other people\u2019s time.\n\nWe can enter into dialogue with AI to test our thoughts, correct involuntary\nerrors, deepen our knowledge by investigating what we don\u2019t know, improve our\nwords, results, calculations, code, and designs. The same way we use\nspellcheckers, calculators, and design grids to improve our text, thought, and\nwork. In all we do, we need to continue to question the machines, ourselves\nand how we use them.\n\n### What can we hope?\n\nWe need to rethink how we spend our free time. AI will have eaten all our\nhobbies long before it fired us from our job. It beat Kasparov at chess 25\nyears ago. It doesn\u2019t beat Bach at composing, Picasso at painting, or\nShakespeare at writing\u2014but it already makes it easy for a hobbyist to simulate\nthem. Why resist?\n\nThe broader point is: Our life goal cannot be to finish our meaningless work\nquickly and then do something imperfect but meaningful in our free time. This\nwas always a bad take on life. Work has impact. What you do at the office\naffects others. If you let the machines do meaningless work, the effect will\nbe that meaninglessness will continue to perpetuate.\n\nIf you give up on thinking for yourself, on asking yourself, if you mean what\nyou say, feel what you thought, if you give up on understanding, you become a\nmachine. As the machines start out simulating us in almost every aspect, it is\nnot unlikely that, as it happens so often when we produce technology, that at\nsome point we start adapting to them.\n\nStill, there is hope. The hope is that through the right use of machines, we\nlearn to be different from them. If you use AI mindfully, not to fool others\nbut to question yourself, to think deeper and to better control your self-\nexpression instead of automating it, there is a chance that you will\nunderstand more and not less.\n\nThere is a chance that AI can become a gym for your mind. If you have used AI\nyourself, you have learned that the output of AI improves the more you\nunderstand what you are doing. This is perfectly clear with image generation,\nbut it\u2019s the same when it comes to text and coding. Only if you know what you\nwant and understand what you are doing, can you use your tools appropriately\nto achieve the results you desire.\n\nAI doesn\u2019t possess human understanding. It simulates it. How so? It doesn\u2019t\nhave a body. It doesn\u2019t sense what it calculates. It doesn\u2019t feel what it\nprocesses. It cannot. We also simulate more than we realize, but we can\nunderstand. We can feel that we think. We feel and know that we are.\n\nAI feeds off our understanding. It feeds off our understanding in the material\nit uses to simulate us, and it feeds off our understanding the very moment we\nuse it. We can hope that this will not lead to us being completely drained of\nany understanding, but rather, to strengthen it.\n\n### What does it mean to be human?\n\nTo not get sucked into that black hole too soon, let\u2019s shine a light on the\nidea of human language. Language connects us. Language connects one human\nbeing to another. Through space and time. Language transports meaning between\nminds, sense between bodies, it can make us understand each other and\nourselves. It can make us feel what others feel. Language is a bridge.\n\nLanguage is a bridge. If we disconnect one side of the bridge, the bridge\nfalls. If one listener or speaker, writer, or reader stops feeling what is\nsaid, the bridge crumbles. Language without a body is senseless, meaningless,\nvoid. As the machines start outdoing us technically, let\u2019s not neglect that\nunderstanding can be real and that, at its best, it can be mutual. The end of\nwriting is to understand each other through time and space, to feel what\nothers have felt and to make others feel through time and space how we feel\nnow. AI can mess this up, badly, by blurring what was written by humans and\nwhat was generated without feeling or understanding\u2014but it cannot end it.\n\nRealizing what it means to be human may not always turn out to be a pleasing\nexperience. We do not always mean well. But there is an almost unspeakable\nbeauty in the moment where two humans that do mean well, realize that they\nunderstand each other.\n\n  1. \u201cIt\u2019s so good that I have investors asking me how they pulled it off, or why OpenAI would even do this,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s $13 billion bet on OpenAI carries huge potential along with plenty of uncertainty, CNBC\n  2. iA will not let AI write your text without what or ifs. We want you to feel what you want to say, think what you want to write, and write so clearly that others will think what you think and feel what you felt. We will continue to use algorithms if they encourage you to think harder. We have been doing that for years (with Syntax Highlight and Style Check). Using AI to correct spelling errors, point out holes or check for factual or logical errors\u2014anything that makes you think more is great. But, whatever you we, we want you to think more, not less. If you\u2019d rather have ChatGPT write for you than feel, write and think for yourself, you can do that elsewhere. To use ChatGPT you don\u2019t need us. It\u2019ll be everywhere else. \u21a9\n  3. Quoting Freedom, by George Michael. The song\u2019s lyrics are about his own struggle with fame and his complicated relationship with the music industry. It was playing in the background while I wrote the article, and it shows: \u201cWell it looks like the road to Heaven ... But it feels like the road to Hell ... And everybody\u2019s got to sell ... And some mistakes were build to last ... That\u2019s what you get, for changing your mind ... And after all this time ... I just hope you understand ... Sometimes the clothes ... Do not make the man ... All we have to do now ... Is take these lies and ... Make them true somehow...\u201d\n  4. The popular argument is that those who will be using AI will win and those who do not will be left behind. As long as AI remains a tool and we stay in control, that argument is fully plausible. But we are already so much following technology in how we communicate with each other. The world is full of noise because we are not in control of our information technology but the other way around. When it comes to writing, things are not that easy. If you do not understand the foundation of what you write, it\u2019s not likely that you will end up with a text that has been felt and understood in every aspect. Writing is rewriting and rewriting until the thought becomes clear. AI may help here and there pointing you to unclear elements, but if AI writes for you, you will stop thinking. \u21a9\n  5. In the Critique of the Pure Reason (1781) Kant formulated these four questions to sketch out a framework for understanding the human experience and the nature of knowledge and morality:\n\n1\\. What can I know? 2. What do I have to do? 3. What can I hope for? 4. What\nis the human being?\u201d \u2013Kant, Critique of the Pure Reason, KrV, A 805/B 833\n\nThe four fundamental questions appeared already in 1765 in his Lectures on\nLogic (Log, AA 9, 25).\n\n  * ### iA Newsletter\n\n  * Subscribe to receive product updates, announcements, and a look behind the scenes.
