They're\nclever and simple enough that more or less anyone can install one to keep\nwatch on property when on vacation, check in on pets while at work, or to spy\non Airbnb guests. The consumer market is saturated with similar gadgets, all\nof which tend to make this writer's eye glaze over every time a press release\nlobs into the inbox.\n\nMore Stories\n\nHome Entertainment\n\nRanking Apple TV+ sci-fi shows: From 'Severance' to 'For All Mankind'\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nNot in this case. Meet PaintCam Eve \u2013 an armed home security camera with an\nitchy trigger finger.\n\nPaintCam: Face recognition & Paintball firing security system\n\nThe name is endearingly unassuming, but this smart home \"guardian\" has a far\nmore mischievous (borderline evil) side. Part supersized arcade game, part\nSquid Game, PaintCam Eve uses automatic target marking, face recognition and\nAI-based decision making to identify unfamiliar visitors to your property, day\nor night.\n\nIt then gives an ED-209 style warning to anyone it doesn't know \u2013 and if they\nfail to comply and take off within the time limit, Eve will start firing off\npaintball pellets that'll mark the intruder for later police identification,\nwhile also hurting enough to make it highly likely they'll skedaddle rather\nthan pressing the issue.\n\nIf pelting a potential intruder and splattering their clothes isn't quite\ndramatic enough for your tastes, Eve is very happy to step things up to\nanother level altogether, with the option of frickin' tear gas projectiles.\nIt's like having a trigger-happy squad of riot police on your porch.\n\nEve would be controlled through a smartphone app, but can switch to acting\nautonomously if you lose cell reception\n\nPaintCam\n\nEve's creators call it \"a vigilant guardian that doesn't sleep, blink, or miss\na beat\" and \"a proactive participant in your safety.\" They stop short of\ncalling it an insurance salesman-blaster, but that doesn't mean you or I have\nto.\n\nFun and potentially injurious games aside, Eve comes with your usual security\ncamera features. There's remote access, with Eve promising to work\n\"autonomously\" if you lose internet connection to the system (again, what\ncould possibly go wrong?).\n\nYou can also take personal responsibility for who gets peppered. For example,\nif someone unknown enters the camera's field, alongside a familiar visitor,\nthe facial recognition software will notify you for instructions on what to do\nnext. As if it wasn't already a brutal enough experience the first time you\nvisited your partner's parents.\n\nEve, when a standard home security camera wakes up one day and chooses\nviolence\n\nPaintCam\n\nSome versions of the system will also identify familiar pets, implying that\nthey'll happily open fire on the neighbor's cat or other local wildlife if you\ntick a box. That could certainly be handy for anyone that keeps chickens and\nlives near foxes.\n\nThe makers haven't provided a ton in the way of specs, but they do promise\nsome standards you'd hope for in home security: live monitoring, customizable\nalerts, night vision, object tracking, movement detection and a reasonably\nslick and unobtrusive, easy-to-set-up design. There's also video storage and\nplayback \u2013 and we can't imagine a security camera whose footage we'd me more\ninterested in watching.\n\nWe have questions: Can we trust in the behavior of fellow humans to use\ntechnology as the creators intend it? (Precedent suggests absolutely not.)\nCould you turn Eve into a grown-up's 'knock and run' paintball game between\nneighborhood friends? Are burglars particularly fearful of having their\nclothing ruined?\n\nYour home security unit with an evil streak\n\nPaintCam Eve\n\nWould it be morally unjust to teargas door-to-door salespeople, even if they'd\nso far ignored your \"thanks, but no thanks\" response on five earlier\noccasions? Should we really approach home security like modern day warfare?\n\nIf you were to test Eve's accuracy out on a late-arriving Uber food delivery\ndriver who you witnessed dump your half-spilt, cold laksa on your doorstep,\nwould that harm your star rating in a significant way? Asking for a friend.\n\nAnd of course, would you be legally liable if this thing nailed a neighborhood\nkid or runaway pooch in the eyeball and caused some serious damage?\n\nIf you're as curious about this system as clearly we are, the PaintCam team\nlaunches a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign on April 23. Pricing, and\nhopefully more technical specs and epic videos (see below), will also come\nwith this.\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy this prototype testing video, complete with slo-mo.\n\nBehind the Scenes: PaintCam Prototype Testing #2 (Jan 2024)\n\nSource: PaintCam\n\nView gallery - 5 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.
