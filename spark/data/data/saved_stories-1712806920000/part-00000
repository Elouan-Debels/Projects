Well, not really.\n\nDuolingo is an incredibly popular language learning app that can teach you a\nwide range of languages in bite sized daily lessons. The app is pretty\neffective in teaching the basics of languages, by encouraging you to maintain\nyour streak by doing a short lesson every single day. I have a four-figure\nstreak that would destroy me to break, so I happily do my lesson every day.\nItalian? Completed it, mate.\n\nDuolingo has now added two new options to the app, and for the first time,\nthey're not languages. You can now learn maths, which is unlikely to appeal to\nmany, but you can also learn music. With so many people regretting that they\nnever learned an instrument as a kid, this has the potential to be extremely\npopular.\n\nBut is it any good? I learned piano as a kid, so I tried out Duolingo Music to\nsee if it could actually teach you to learn an instrument. Here's what I\nfound.\n\n## What is Duolingo Music?\n\nDuolingo Music is a new option within the Duolingo app that allows you to\nlearn music instead of languages. It was released alongside another option,\nDuolingo Math, which teaches you some basic maths skills.\n\nDuolingo Music uses the same gamified methods you'll be familiar with if\nyou've ever used Duolingo to learn a language. By working through the lessons\non a daily basis, the intent is to teach you how to read and play music. You\nget a mix of lesson types, with some asking you to name notes, and others\ngetting you to play along with the music in a format that's a little like the\nclassic Guitar Hero games, only with a piano keyboard.\n\n## What I liked about Duolingo Music\n\nUnfortunately, this section is going to be pretty brief, as there's a lot\nwrong with Duolingo music and very little right. The one thing that Duolingo\nMusic is useful for is learning musical notation. If you want to play an\ninstrument by reading sheet music, then you're going to need to know what all\nthose little dots and lines actually mean, and this is what Duolingo Music is\nactually good at. You learn the names of the notes, the different lengths of\nnotes, you learn about rests (the gaps between notes), and all of this will\nhelp you to be able to read music, up to a point. The flaw here is that the\nfocus is exclusively on the treble clef. That's fine as a starting point, but\nif you want to learn the piano, only the music for your right hand is written\nin the treble clef, with the part for your left hand written in bass clef.\nLong story short, you're only learning one of the four main clefs that are\nused in music, and although it's by far the most common, there are still three\nothers you won't be able to read.\n\n## What I didn't like about Duolingo Music\n\nThere's a lot to get into here, as I found some serious problems with Duolingo\nMusic. Let's break it down a little.\n\n### Any instrument as long as it's piano\n\nWhen Duolingo was announced, people were excited. There are millions of people\nout there who spend a little time every day extending their language streaks,\nand the idea of being able to learn to play an instrument in just a few\nminutes a day is appealing. However, if you were thinking that you'd finally\nget to learn that dusty guitar that you bought all those years ago, you're out\nof luck.\n\nDuolingo Music only teaches you how to play music on a keyboard. If you want\nto learn to play the piano, that will be of some help (more on that later) but\nif you want to learn guitar, or flute, or drums, or cello, then Duolingo Music\ncan't help. It makes sense in practical terms, as an on-screen keyboard is the\nsimplest way for you to interact with the app, but it will still be a huge\ndisappointment to the majority of people.\n\n### You'll learn one (not very useful) skill\n\nEven if you do want to use it to learn the piano, that's not quite what you're\ngetting. Duolingo Music will teach you one skill: how to play a virtual\nkeyboard on your phone or tablet. This is not the same as learning to play the\npiano. On a phone, the keyboard is too small for you to use anything other\nthan a one-finger-stab technique, so you'll learn how to prod keys with your\nindex finger. Playing a piano is about using all ten fingers, and that's not\nsomething you're going to learn with this app. If you try to take your new\nskills to a real piano, you're going to find it a real struggle too, as\ntapping a virtual key is a lot easier than pressing down a weighted piano key.\n\nEven then, trying to find the right place to start playing on a real piano\nwill be a challenge. The first thing I was taught when I had my first piano\nlesson was where to find middle C. Duolingo teaches you where to find a C (and\neven this isn't done very well, with small sections of keyboard that make it\nhard to work out which key is which) but it doesn't teach you where this note\nis found on a piano. If you want to take your new skills to a real piano,\nyou'll just have to hope you're playing the right C.\n\n### Fiddly controls\n\nI can play the piano. Not very well, but I can play it. But very often I would\nlose all my hearts before the end of a session on Duolingo Music, not because\nI didn't know what to play, but because I pressed the wrong key on the tiny\nvirtual keyboard. It's incredibly frustrating to lose hearts when you know\nwhat you wanted to play, but you got marked down for your fumbly fingers. The\nkeys on a real piano or keyboard are much larger, so this isn't really\nteaching you anything other than how to tap more accurately.\n\n### Music choices\n\nNow you might think that you can get past all of these flaws if you end up\nbeing able to impress your friends by playing The Way It Is by Bruce Hornsby\nand the Range. Well, prepare to be disappointed. I skipped ahead to the very\nend of the Duolingo Music, and the final boss you have to face after working\nthrough 69 units of Duolingo Music? Learning how to play a pretty ropey\narrangement of Pop Goes The Weasel. Was it really worth it?\n\n## Duolingo Music conclusions\n\nIf you want to learn how to read music, then Duolingo Music is fairly useful.\nYou'll have to get through all the sections where you're forced to play, but\nyou will learn the names of the notes, about the lengths of notes and rests,\nabout time signatures, and about sharps and flats. You can then use those\nskills to go and learn a real instrument.\n\nIf you hoped that Duolingo Music would actually teach you how to play an\ninstrument, however, then you're out of luck. You won't be any closer to\nknowing how to play that guitar, and even if you always wanted to learn the\npiano, you'll only be a small fraction of the way to knowing how to play that\ntoo. At best, you'll be able to play Pop Goes The Weasel with one finger.\nMaybe Duolingo will improve the app over time, but for now, you're much better\noff just sticking to learning Swedish.
