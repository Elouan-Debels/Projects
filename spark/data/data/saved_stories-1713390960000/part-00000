It's a 20kW AM radio station broadcasting with an\narray of eight individual towers:\n\nHow does one get a single coherent signal out of an eight-tower array? Enter\nthe phasor:\n\nThat's phasor with an o, not phaser with an e, so Trekkies need not fret about\na misspelling.\n\nThe engineer at the station noticed our other tower tours, and was a friend of\nmy Dad's, so he suggested we come see this site. It has one of the more\nelaborate AM broadcast phasor setups in the area.\n\nBehind the unassuming front panel with all the cranks, there's a series of\nvery beefy variable inductors and vacuum capacitors, where you crank them\naround to change the phase, power, and reactance of each of the individual\ntowers\u2014in this case, 5 in a day pattern, and 5 in a night pattern.\n\nThe inside looks like something out of Frankenstein's lab:\n\nI'm told by the engineer that when there are issues besides a blown capacitor\nor a relay gone bad (they tend to do that sometimes, with 20 kW of power\nflowing through them 24x7), the wizards at Phasetek have him call them up to\nfigure out what to do. The phasor itself is only half the tuning equation\u2014in\naddition to all of it's knobs and relays, there are ATUs, or Antenna Tuning\nUnits, at the base of each tower. And these are also full of massive inductors\nand capacitors, matching the towers to the phasor and transmitter:\n\nWe have an entire video about the tower site, embedded below:\n\nIn the video, we get into all the equipment on the site, and talk on a high\nlevel about tower array design, transmitter room layout, grounding for the\nbuilding and towers, and more\u2014but we didn't dive too deep into the actual\nphysics of the phasor.\n\nFor that, I found this great little intro with some nice 1950's illustrations:\nAntenna Theory - Directivity. The idea of a 'phased array' of antennas was\nintroduced in 1905 by Karl Ferdinand Braun, and the phasor installed in the\nWSDZ-AM transmitter site builds on that theory, in a relatively simple way.\n\nModern beam-forming antennas are used for much more exotic applications, from\nthe flat Starlink satellite dishes to 3D radar systems deployed by the\nmilitary.\n\nI would highly recommend watching the video if you want to see more about the\napplication of this tech in AM radio, especially since we demonstrate one of\nthe interesting quirks of running an AM station with a day/night pattern. To\ncontrol the signal's directionality and reach at night\u2014when the ionosphere\nextends the reach of AM signals much further\u2014there's a series of 16+ massive\nRF relays all remotely operated and automated by switchers like this:\n\nThey make an impressive ka-chunk ka-chunk, especially in tandem with the\ntransmitter's brief power-down-power-up cycle!\n\nBut even when you split up the 20 kW among 5 towers, it's never a good idea to\ntouch an AM tower.\n\n## Further reading\n\n  * The Mighty 'MOX: 50kW AM Tower site tour\n\n  * 1 Million Watts of RF - how the FM Supertower works\n\n  * Talking Hot Dog gives new meaning to 'Ham radio'\n\nradio\n\nam\n\nwsdz\n\nsaint louis\n\nphasor\n\nrf\n\ngeerling engineering\n\nvideo\n\nyoutube\n\n  * Add new comment\n\nAll content copyright Jeff Geerling.
