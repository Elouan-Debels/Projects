Residents were told to stay\nindoors as wind speeds reached 100 kilometres per hour and visibility reduced\nto less than 90 metres. Over the weekend, people in Beijing were warned to\nshut windows and take precautions as dust approached the city after sweeping\nthrough parts of Mongolia and China's Inner Mongolia.\n\nSince the 1990s, Chinese scientists have carried out extensive research on\ndust storms and developed several forecasting systems. But challenges remain.\nScientists want to more accurately predict when and where dust is being picked\nup, how much of it is being picked up and how the dust load changes. Current\nsystems still sometimes make errors.\n\nResearchers in the region have been applying artificial intelligence (AI) and\nclimate modelling to better predict this annual phenomenon. Better prediction\ncould save tens of millions of yuan each year. In the first quarter of 2021\nalone, dust storms caused losses worth more than 30 million yuan (US$4.15\nmillion) in northern China, including damages to farms and houses.\n\n## Swirling around\n\nA dust storm occurs when strong winds sweep across dry areas, such as deserts,\npicking up dust particles from the ground and lifting them into the air,\nsometimes to as high as 1,500 metres.\n\n\u201cThe dust and wind can combine to create massive, fast-moving walls of dust\nthat travel a great distance,\u201d says Chen Siyu, an atmospheric scientist at\nLanzhou University in China.\n\nThe storms also hoover up bacteria and toxic metal particles, making them\npotentially damaging to people\u2019s health and the environment.\n\nDuring dust storms, mortality from cardiovascular diseases increases by 25%,\nand from respiratory problems by 18%. Estimates show that water and nutrient\nloss in soil, caused by these storms, could reduce crop yield by up to 24% in\nMongolia.\n\nGlobally, 334 million people are affected by sand and dust storms, with the\nSahara Desert in Africa being the largest source of dust.\n\nChen lives in Lanzhou, a city situated on the doorstep of the Gobi Desert, one\nof the main sources of dust in Asia. Her team has developed an early-warning\nsystem that uses AI to help forecast the storms.\n\n\u201cAI can learn how dust storms evolve in time and space from a large amount of\ndata,\u201d says Huang Jianping, China\u2019s leading researcher in dust dynamics and a\ndistinguished professor at Lanzhou University. \u201cAnd we already have a huge\nvolume of information about dust storms, including ground-level observational\ndata, satellite data and simulations from various models.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Chen and her team were among the first researchers in China to use AI\nto help develop forecast systems for north and East Asia. Researchers in\nIsrael have also harnessed AI to improve forecasts in the Middle East.\n\nChen\u2019s team calls its system the Dust Watcher. It can predict the timing and\nseverity of an incoming dust storm on an hourly basis up to 12 hours in\nadvance, in 13 Asian countries, including China, Pakistan and Tajikistan.\n\nIn a trial run last year^1, the Dust Watcher made 13% less errors than non-AI\nmodels did, Chen says.\n\nChen is in talks with several meteorological institutions in China that are\ninterested in the Dust Watcher, which is yet to be launched officially. Chen\u2019s\nteam is also looking to turn it into an mobile application to enable the\npublic to get dust-storm forecasts easily.\n\n## Challenges for forecasting\n\nAccording to Wang Zifa, an atmospheric physicist at the Chinese Academy of\nSciences, the effects of dust storms are particularly severe in East Asia,\nowing to the region\u2019s dense population.\n\n\u201cIn East Asia, dust storms often originate in the Gobi Desert and move across\npopulous areas, such as China\u2019s Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei urban cluster, the\nKorean Peninsula and Japan,\u201d says Wang.\n\nTo refine forecasting, Jin Jianbing, an atmospheric scientist at the Nanjing\nUniversity of Information Science and Technology in China, and his colleagues\nhave developed a 48-hour forecast, called Dust Assimilation and Prediction\nSystem (DAPS).\n\nData assimilation is a process that dynamically integrates observational data\nwith model calculations to enhance the accuracy of predictions. \u201cIt almost\nacts like an autopilot for the model,\u201d Jin says.\n\nJin\u2019s team also employed AI. \u201cWe used several deep-learning models to remove\nbias in the original observations before using them for assimilation to\nimprove the accuracy of the results.\u201d He adds that AI can be \u201cvery helpful\u201d in\noptimizing dust storm forecasts.\n\nDAPS can give detailed predictions, such as how the dust would spread in\naffected areas and how concentrated it would be, on a microgram scale. It\ncovers five countries in East Asia: China, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea\nand Japan.\n\n## Climate change and dust storms\n\nAlthough climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of many\nextreme weather events worldwide, its relationship with dust storms is more\ncomplicated.\n\nClimate change might have an unexpected mitigating effect on dust storms,\naccording to a study published last month^2. The researchers found that dust\nlevels have declined in west and South Asia over the past 20 years owing to a\nclimate phenomenon called Arctic amplification.\n\n\u201cArctic amplification leads to changes in wind circulation,\u201d says Gao Meng, an\natmospheric scientist at the Hong Kong Baptist University and co-author of the\npaper. These changes \u201creduce the amount of dust blown to the regions\u201d, he\nsays.\n\nBy contrast, in Pakistan, dust has not only worsened the air quality in\npopulous regions, such as Karachi and Lahore, but it has also \u201csignificantly\nchanged\u201d the country\u2019s rainfall patterns, says Khan Alam, an atmospheric\nscientist at the University of Peshawar in Pakistan.\n\nDust particles can increase rates of extreme rainfall. Alam and his colleagues\nare investigating whether there was a connection between dust and the\ncatastrophic floods that devastated Pakistan in 2022.\n\nAlam considers international collaboration to be important for mitigating the\neffects of dust storms. \u201cIf Asian countries share the ground dust data with\neach other, then it will be possible to accurately forecast dust\nconcentration,\u201d he says. Gao underscores the importance of stepping up anti-\ndesertification efforts, such as tree planting and irrigation management, in\nreducing dust levels. If efforts to curb global warming are successful, west\nand South Asia\u2019s dust levels could rise again, Gao adds.\n\nWang agrees: \u201cMost areas affected by desertification are remote and less\ndeveloped, with harsh living conditions. To really reduce dust storms with the\nhelp of science, what we need is solid financial support, human resources and\nthe attention of governments and the public.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01076-7\n\n## References\n\n  1.
