The Android ecosystem was\nsupposed to have its own version of Apple's AirTags by now. Google has had a\ncrowd-sourced device-tracking network sitting dormant on 3 billion Android\nphones since December 2022. Partners have been ready to go with Bluetooth tag\nhardware since May 2023! This was all supposed to launch a year ago, but\nGoogle has been in a holding pattern. The good news is we're finally seeing\nsome progress after a year of silence.\n\nThe reason for Google's lengthy delay is actually Apple. A week before\nGoogle's partners announced their Android network Bluetooth tags, Google and\nApple jointly announced a standard to detect \"unknown\" Bluetooth trackers and\nshow users alerts if their phone thinks they're being stalked. Since you can\nconstantly see an AirTag's location, they can be used for stalking by just\ncovertly slipping one into a bag or car; nobody wants that, so everyone's\nfavorite mobile duopoly is teaming up.\n\nGoogle did its half of this partnership and rolled out AirTag detection in\nJuly 2023. At the same time, Google also announced: \"We\u2019ve made the decision\nto hold the rollout of the Find My Device network until Apple has implemented\nprotections for iOS.\" Surely Apple would be burning the midnight oil to launch\niOS Android tag detection as soon as possible so that Google could start\ncompeting with AirTags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt looks like iOS 17.5 is the magic version Google is waiting for. The first\nbeta was recently released to testers, and 9to5Mac recently spotted strings\nfor detecting \"unwanted\" non-Apple tracking devices that were suddenly\nfollowing you around. This 17.5 update still needs to ship, and the\nexpectation is sometime in May. That would be 11 months after Google's\nrelease.\n\nJust like AirTags, and the Tile network before it, the goal of the project is\nto enable helpful little Bluetooth tracking tags that can tell you where your\nstuff is. These Bluetooth tags are super low-power and aim to last for a year\non a small battery, which means they don't have the power to spare for GPS.\nThey can still report their location, though, because they manage to \"borrow\"\nthe GPS chip of any compatible smartphones in range. Your phone scans for any\nBluetooth tags, even ones you don't own, then notes their approximate location\nand uploads it to the cloud. This is all done anonymously, and only the owner\nof the tag can see its location, but everyone in the network pitches in to\ncreate a crowdsourced, worldwide thing-tracking network.\n\nTile started the whole idea by having any user with the Tile app running do\nanonymous location uploads for every other Tile in earshot. Nothing can\ncompete with the scale of Apple's version, though, which runs on every iThing\nout there, and the bigger size of the network makes it a lot more reliable.\nAndroid will have an even bigger network if it ever launches. In an ideal\nworld, Android and iOS would just work together to perfectly track every\nBluetooth tracker regardless of make and model, but they're only teaming up\nfor stalking detection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Google gears up for launch\n\nWith the impending iOS release, Google seems to be getting its ducks in a row\nas well. 9to5Google has a screenshot of the new Find My Device settings page\nthat is appearing for some users, which gives them a chance to opt out of the\nanonymous tracking network. That report also mentions that some users received\nan email Thursday of an impending tracking network launch, saying: \"You\u2019ll get\na notification on your Android devices when this feature is turned on in 3\ndays. Until then, you can opt out of the network through Find My Device on the\nweb.\" The vast majority of Android users have not gotten this email, though,\nsuggesting maybe it was a mistake. It's very weird to announce a launch in\n\"days remaining\" rather than just saying what date something will launch, and\nthis email went out Thursday, which would mean a bizarre Sunday launch when\neveryone is off for the weekend.\n\nThe official announcement could come at any time, but Google said it wanted to\nwait for Apple, and that means at least a few weeks for actual functionality\nto be turned on. We also need a launch date from those poor hardware partners\nthat presumably have had tracking tags sitting around in a warehouse for a\nyear. Google's partners, Chipolo and Pebblebee, have both been taking\npreorders for Android tracking tags for the past year and don't have any\nlaunch updates.\n\nAnd speaking of hardware, Google was supposed to be building a first-party\ntracking tag once upon a time. January 2023 was when we first heard of a\ndevice codenamed \"Grogu,\" which was supposed to have a speaker, UWB\ncompatibility, and Bluetooth LE. Is that still happening? There's probably\ntime to have made a second-generation device by now. Apple's May iOS release\nwould be great timing for a Google I/O announcement, but we were also\nexpecting an announcement at the last I/O, so who knows.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n147\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
