Career questions, goals, and uncertainties\noccupy the minds of most people who haven't \"figured it out\" yet, or gotten\nwhere they think they want to go. This used to bother me a lot, not having a\nclear goal or plan for what I want to do for the next twenty or so years. But\nover time, it's bothered me less and less, as I've changed how I think about\ncareer success.\n\nIn college, I used to think that a successful career meant something that I\nloved doing and could happily do for my entire life. I also thought I had to\nfind it fast. I believed (and still do, to some degree) that retirement would\nnever be for me. I'd find the thing I want to do and keep doing that until the\nday I die. Some people work to live, while others live to work. I like to\nthink I fall into the latter bucket. I couldn't imagine spending 10-15 years\nlounging around by a pool or playing golf with all of my free time in\nretirement. There's nothing wrong with that, but I know it wouldn't suit me. I\nneed to always be doing something, always feel useful.\n\nThe problem is, I haven't found my forever-career yet. I've bounced around and\nchanged career paths quite a lot for someone who hasn't been working all that\nlong. In college, I thought I wanted to be a Registered Dietitian. Then, I\nthought about pursuing physicians assistant or medical school. After a two-\nyear stint working in an emergency room, I realized the clinical life was not\nfor me. Still, I loved science and human health. I pursued a master's degree\nin Nutrition and Metabolism, where the career track after graduating would\nhave placed me in a laboratory or a PhD program. But due to a growing interest\nin business and tech, I dropped out and took an internship with a startup\naccelerator, which helped me break into the field. I spent three years working\nwith startups, first in business development and then product management. Now,\nI'm back to looking for my next thing, still unsure of what that might be.\n\nIn the past, this would have kept me up at night. But out of a necessity for\nmore peace of mind, I've changed how I think about career success. Instead of\nneeding to hit the bullseye on my next try, landing the career I'll stay in\nfor the rest of my life, I now realize that I only need to get closer to it.\n\nThis has taken a tremendous amount of pressure off of my career decision\nmaking, and has instead made the whole endeavor a lot more fun. I've started\nthinking of my career as a dartboard, with a bullseye in the center,\nrepresenting the \"perfect\" career. Each \"throw\" of a dart is a new experiment\nin figuring out what I want to spend the majority of my time doing. I get as\nmany throws as I want--it's really up to me. The number of throw's I get is\nall dependent on how many experiments I'm willing to run, how many new\nexperiences I'm open to trying.\n\nWhat's important to realize is that a throw doesn't have to mean quitting your\njob or taking a new one. Simply starting a new hobby, taking a class, or\nmoving to a new part of the world can lead to more accurate throws.\n\nI'll give you an example. When I lived in Philadelphia, I performed my first\nopen-mic comedy set. I had no allusions of pursuing stand up comedy as a\ncareer, it was just something that I wanted to try. What I learned from that\nexperience was a few things that have since been helpful in figuring out how\nto get closer to my own personal bullseye.\n\nOne, I'm a lot better at public speaking than I thought. I got on stage, in\nfront of a room full of strangers, and told jokes that until that point only\nthe walls of my apartment had heard. And it went well. I got laughs, I didn't\nfreeze up, and I felt invigorated and excited being up on stage. Two, I\nlearned how important creativity is to my well-being. I had never considered\nmyself to be a creative person. I was never good at drawing or music, and have\nalways had pretty vanilla tastes when it came to art. But joke writing was a\nwhole new kind of creativity that I had never expressed until this experience.\nI found the whole process of thinking, writing, and telling jokes to be an\nincredible creative outlet for me, and one I enjoyed very much. I now consider\nmyself a creative person, and know that I need some form of creativity in my\nlife. Three, I'm way better at making observations and connections than I\nthought. Joke writing is all about observing yourself and the world. Jokes are\nfunny when they make connections to things that the audience wasn't expecting.\nCycling through all the possible connections, and looking for the funniest\nones, is one of the most exciting and gratifying parts of writing a good joke.\n\nThese three things--public speaking, creativity, and careful observation--are\nall components of what I now know I want out of a career. If I can do\nsomething that meets even one part of that criteria, I've gotten closer to the\nbullseye. So, that's what I'll be looking for in my next move.\n\nLooking at career success in this way has helped focus me. I don't feel like I\nneed to get my next career move 100% right. I just need to be partially right,\nalong at least one of many dimensions. And while I'm experimenting in my next\ncareer, I'll also learn new things on the job and in my free time that will\nhelp me get even closer to where I belong.\n\nAnother advantage of taking this approach to figuring out your career is that\nit becomes difficult to explain what you do. That might not sound like an\nadvantage, but it is. The more nuanced and unique you become as a professional\nin your given field, the harder you become to replace. If I end up becoming\nthe guy who gives lighthearted, witty public presentations on how technology\nis transforming our relationship to nutrition and medicine, good luck finding\nsomeone else to do that job.\n\nBy maximizing the number of throws I get in my attempt to hit my career\nbullseye, I'll not only get closer, faster, but I'll carve out a niche for\nmyself that is uniquely my own. From there, I could start my own business,\nconsult others, or become an irreplaceable piece of a larger whole. Those are\noptions worth spending time and energy to have, and they're what I now find\nmyself spending most of my time trying to get.\n\nYou don't need to have it all figured out when it comes to your career. In\nfact, I don't think that should be the end goal. Because if done right, your\ncareer will keep evolving as you learn more about yourself, what you're good\nat, and what you value. You might never hit the bullseye, but you'll get\ncloser with every throw.\n\nGetting closer is all that matters. Keep throwing.\n\n## Footer\n\n#### The Loesch Letter\n\nThoughts on life, career, health, and lots of other stuff from James Loesch\n\nHomePosts\n\nAbout Me\n\nAbout Me\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Loesch Letter.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPowered by beehiiv\n\n", "frontpage": false}
