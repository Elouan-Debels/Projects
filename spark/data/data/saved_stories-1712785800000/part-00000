(July 2021)  \n---  \n996 working hour system  \n---  \nChinese| 996\u5de5\u4f5c\u5236  \n| Transcriptions  \n---  \nStandard Mandarin  \nHanyu Pinyin| ji\u01d4ji\u01d4li\u00f9 g\u014dngzu\u00f2 zh\u00ec  \n  \nThe 996 working hour system (Chinese: 996\u5de5\u4f5c\u5236) is a work schedule practiced\nillegally by many companies in China. It derives its name from its requirement\nthat employees work from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, 6 days per week; i.e. 72 hours\nper week, 12 hours per day.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6] A number of Mainland\nChinese internet companies have adopted this system as their official work\nschedule. Critics argue that the 996 working hour system is a violation of\nChinese Labour Law and have called it \"modern slavery\".^[7]^[8]\n\nIn March 2019, an \"anti-996\" protest was launched via GitHub.^[9]^[10]^[11]\nSince then, the 996 issue has been met with growing discontent in China, but\ndespite China's official promises that the 996 working hour system will\ndisappear, it is still widespread as of 2024.^[12]^[13]^[14]\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nSee also: Labor relations in China\n\nThe culture of overtime work has a long history in Chinese IT companies,^[15]\nwhere the focus is typically on speed and cost reduction.^[16] Companies\nemploy a range of measures, such as reimbursing taxi fares for employees who\nremain working at the office late into the night, to encourage overtime\nwork.^[17]\n\nThis system of working for long hours with few breaks has been known to\nincrease the occurrence of mental and physical problems seen in workers. It is\nestimated that more than three-quarters of urban workers in big cities like\nBeijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou suffer from work-related fatigue,\nmusculoskeletal pain, sleep^[18] or eating disorders, occupational stress, and\nwork\u2013family imbalance.^[19] According to China's state-owned media People's\nDaily, a 2013 survey showed that 98.8% of Chinese IT industry workers said\nthey had health problems.^[20]^[21] Numerous overwork deaths and suicides have\noccurred during past decades due to the 996 system and other overtime working\nsystem in China.^[22]^[23]\n\nIn 2020, a study found that \"Chinese businesses are more likely to follow long\nwork hours than American ones\".^[24] Another study likened 996 culture to\n\"modern slavery\", formed through the combination of \"unrestricted global\ncapitalism and a Confucian culture of hierarchy and obedience\".^[7]\n\n## Companies involved[edit]\n\n### 58.com[edit]\n\nIn September 2016, the classified advertising website 58.com officially\ndeclared its adoption of the 996 working hour system,^[25] attracting\ncriticism from employees and social commentators. The company responded that\nthe 996 system would be an encouraged, not compulsory, practice.^[26]^[27]\n\n### ByteDance[edit]\n\nA CNBC article in May 2021 reported that workers at TikTok's parent company\nByteDance were unhappy with the 996 work culture there and that people were\nturning down job opportunities at TikTok because of it.^[28] In November 2021,\nByteDance moved away from 996 and mandated somewhat shorter working\nhours.^[29] Nevertheless, on 23 February 2022, the sudden death was reported\nof a 28-year-old employee at ByteDance, after he posted a message on Maimai, a\ncareer and social networking platform, the night before. ByteDance later\nissued a statement that was shared in an internal letter with its staff in\nChina, according to which the employee felt dizzy after an hour of exercise at\nthe company gym, before he was taken to the hospital. The incident raised\nscrutiny of the frequent overtime demands of Chinese tech companies.^[30]\n\n### JD.com[edit]\n\nAfter 58.com's 996 schedule was made known to the public, an internal email\nfrom the vice-president Gang He (Chinese: \u4f55\u525b) of JD.com was leaked online,\nwhich contained a demand for the management team of JD.com to implement the\n996 working hour system \"on a flexible basis\".^[31]\n\nOn 15 March 2019, an employee of JD.com alleged that some departments have\nbegun implementing the 995 schedule (9am-9pm, but 5 days per week), while\nother departments have already finished doing so. Following the report, the\npublic relations department of JD.com announced that overtime work was not\ncompulsory.^[32]\n\nRichard Liu, the founder of the company, referred to people complaining about\nthe work schedule as \"slackers\".^[33]\n\n### Pinduoduo[edit]\n\nIn early January 2021, the e-commerce platform Pinduoduo was accused of\nforcing its employees to do extremely intensive overtimes, which supposedly\nled to the karoshi death of a 22-year-old worker.^[34]^[35] Later, the\nofficial account of Pinduoduo posted (but deleted shortly afterwards) an\nanswer on Zhihu, saying \"Those who are at the bottom of the society earn their\nwages at the risk of losing their lives\".^[36]\n\nJust a few days after the early January accident, another employee committed\nsuicide by jumping.^[37]^[38] On 10 January, news sources reported that\nPinduoduo fired an employee who posted photos showing his colleague being\ncarried into an ambulance.^[39]^[40]\n\n### Youzan[edit]\n\nIn January 2019, an employee of Youzan stated on the social platform Maimai\nthat their supervisor had enforced the 996 schedule.^[41] Bai Ya, the CEO of\nYouzan, replied, \"it would be a good thing to look back at a few years\nlater\".^[17] Some media outlets criticized this schedule.^[42] Later that\nmonth, the Labour Supervision Group of Xihu District, Hangzhou announced that\nthe company was under investigation.^[43]\n\n### Others[edit]\n\nAt least 40 companies, including Huawei and Alibaba Group, have implemented\nthe 996 schedule or an even more intensive alternative.^[44]^[45]\n\n## Online protests[edit]\n\n### 996.ICU GitHub campaign[edit]\n\nLogo of Anti-996 GitHub project\n\nOn 26 March 2019, the 996.ICU repository and website were created. The\nrepository on GitHub states that the name \"996.icu\" refers to how developers\nwho work under the 996 system (9AM\u20139PM, 6 days per week) would risk poor\nhealth and a possible stay in an intensive care unit. The movement's slogan is\n\"developers' lives matter\".^[46]^[47]^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]\n\nTwo days later, on 28 March 2019, the repository had already received 50\nthousand stars, and 100 thousand stars on 30 March 2019, which made it the top\ntrending repository on GitHub.^[53] The repository reached 120 thousand stars\non 31 March 2019, and 200 thousand stars on 9 April 2019, making it the second\nmost starred repository on GitHub. The flurry of activity led to the \"issue\"\npage of the repository to be flooded with spam and shut down, which was hotly\ndiscussed on Zhihu, Sina Weibo, and WeChat.^[1]^[54]\n\nThe original aim of the repository was to list the companies that use the 996\nworking hour system, but it soon developed into a movement; the Anti 996\nLicence [zh] was created to explicitly prohibit companies using the 996 system\nfrom using open source^[a] code licensed under it.^[55]^[56]\n\nOn 2 April 2019, it was widely reported that Tencent's QQ browser and WeChat,\nAlibaba's UC Browser, Qihoo 360's 360 Browser, and many other Chromium-based\nMainland Chinese browsers blocked the 996.icu repository on GitHub, describing\nit as \"an illegal and fraudulent site\".^[57]^[27]\n\nOn 18 April 2019, employees at Microsoft and GitHub created a GitHub\nrepository named \"support.996.ICU\" in support of the 996.ICU campaign, which\nthey believe could be under threat of Chinese government\ncensorship.^[58]^[59]^[60]^[61]^[62]^[63]\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n### Support[edit]\n\nJack Ma stated that workers should consider 996 \"a huge blessing\" as there is\nno way to \"achieve the success [one] want[s] without paying extra effort and\ntime\",^[64]^[65]^[66]^[67]^[68]^[27]^[69] while Richard Liu, founder of\nJD.com, said that \"Slackers are not my brothers!\"^[27]^[33] Jason Calacanis,\nan entrepreneur and angel investor, describes 996 as \"the same exact work\nethic that built America\".^[70]\n\n### Criticism[edit]\n\nSeveral Chinese media outlets criticized the 996 working system. Xin Shi\nPing^[b] of the Xinhua News Agency said that the system \"violates labor law\nand overtakes health and the future. It does harm to hard-working workers and\nis a misunderstanding of the hard-working spirit\".^[71] The People's Daily\nwrote that \"advocating 'hard work' does not mean resorting to and enforcing\nthe 996 system\",^[72]^[73]^[74] while an editorial in the China News Service\nsaid that it is \"unnecessary to exchange life for money\".^[75]\n\nBeijing Daily criticized Jack Ma and Richard Liu for \"boasting\" the 996 work\nschedule, claiming that it is \"aimed at disguising reduction of salary or lay-\noff\",^[76] while Wang Xinya, a writer for Banyuetan, stated that some\nentrepreneurs disregarded the law and associate 996 with hard work, calling it\n\"poisonous\" chicken soup. Wang also stated that the system has nothing to do\nwith employee diligence, but has everything to do with company interests.^[77]\n\nPython creator Guido van Rossum described the 996 work schedule as\n\"inhumane\".^[78]^[55]^[79]^[80] In 2021, Chinese scholars stressed on policy-\nmakers that \"there is a need to reform work policies to realize the lowering\nof working time per worker in China (and also to curb excessive-work cultures\nlike 996)\".^[81] They argued, without such initiatives the dual circulation\npolicy is doomed to fail.\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\nThe 996 working hour system was deemed illegal by the Supreme People's Court\non 27 August 2021.^[82] However, it has been doubted whether this ruling will\nbe fully enforced.^[83]^[84]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Buddha-like mindset\n  * Eight-hour day\n  * Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935\n  * Kar\u014dshi\n  * Lochner v.
