A quick Google search\nwill reveal services that allow anyone to launch such attacks anonymously.\nSmall-scale attacks start from $5, and free trials are often available.\nUnsurprisingly, DDoS attacks are on the rise, which may intensify as Internet\nconnectivity improves worldwide, and more vulnerable IoT devices come online.\n\nThese attacks not only infringe on our freedom but also have a significant\nfinancial impact. Anyone with an online presence, from hobbyists to Fortune\n500 companies, can be a target. Furthermore, they pose a threat to the\ndecentralisation of the Internet, as only well-resourced companies can afford\nto operate and protect the public goods on which we all depend.\n\nFortunately, although developers and operators can\u2019t avoid DDoS attacks, they\ncan greatly minimise the impact of such attacks. Reverse proxies (aka CDNs)\nare a great starting point, but they should be part of a broader strategy.\n\n## Help wanted\n\nWe\u2019d very much appreciate any feedback from companies with vantage points on\nDDoS attacks, as well as security researchers. If we\u2019ve misrepresented\nanything, or overlooked details relevant to app developers or operators,\nplease let us know on our forum.\n\nEdit page\n\nBrought to you by\n\nTackling the most crucial and neglected communication problems.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by Relaycorp and contributors.
