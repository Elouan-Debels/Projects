It forces some teams to work with multiple\nvendors to address their specific needs, introducing performance and security\ntradeoffs. More worrisome, it draws focus more to a checklist of services than\na vendor\u2019s underlying architecture. Even the most advanced individual security\nservices or traffic on-ramps don\u2019t matter if organizations ultimately send\ntheir traffic through a fragmented, flawed network.\n\nSingle-vendor SASE is a critical trend to converge disparate security and\nnetworking technologies, yet enterprise \"any-to-any connectivity\" needs true\nnetwork modernization for SASE to work for all teams. Over the past few years,\nCloudflare has launched capabilities to help organizations modernize their\nnetworks as they navigate their short- and long-term roadmaps of SASE use\ncases. We\u2019ve helped simplify SASE implementation, regardless of the team\nleading the initiative.\n\n## Announcing (even more!) flexible on-ramps for single-vendor SASE\n\nToday, we are announcing a series of updates to our SASE platform, Cloudflare\nOne, that further the promise of a single-vendor SASE architecture. Through\nthese new capabilities, Cloudflare makes SASE networking more flexible and\naccessible for security teams, more efficient for traditional networking\nteams, and uniquely extend its reach to an underserved technical team in the\nlarger SASE connectivity conversation: DevOps.\n\nThese platform updates include:\n\n  * Flexible on-ramps for site-to-site connectivity that enable both agent/proxy-based and appliance/routing-based implementations, simplifying SASE networking for both security and networking teams.\n  * New WAN-as-a-service (WANaaS) capabilities like high availability, application awareness, a virtual machine deployment option, and enhanced visibility and analytics that boost operational efficiency while reducing network costs through a \"light branch, heavy cloud\" approach.\n  * Zero Trust connectivity for DevOps: mesh and peer-to-peer (P2P) secure networking capabilities that extend ZTNA to support service-to-service workflows and bidirectional traffic.\n\nCloudflare offers a wide range of SASE on- and off-ramps \u2014 including\nconnectors for your WAN, applications, services, systems, devices, or any\nother internal network resources \u2014 to more easily route traffic to and from\nCloudflare services. This helps organizations align with their best fit\nconnectivity paradigm, based on existing environment, technical familiarity,\nand job role.\n\nWe recently dove into the Magic WAN Connector in a separate blog post and have\nexplained how all our on-ramps fit together in our SASE reference\narchitecture, including our new WARP Connector. This blog focuses on the main\nimpact those technologies have for customers approaching SASE networking from\ndifferent angles.\n\n## More flexible and accessible for security teams\n\nThe process of implementing a SASE architecture can challenge an\norganization\u2019s status quo for internal responsibilities and collaboration\nacross IT, security, and networking. Different teams own various security or\nnetworking technologies whose replacement cycles are not necessarily aligned,\nwhich can reduce the organization's willingness to support particular\nprojects.\n\nSecurity or IT practitioners need to be able to protect resources no matter\nwhere they reside. Sometimes a small connectivity change would help them more\nefficiently protect a given resource, but the task is outside their domain of\ncontrol. Security teams don\u2019t want to feel reliant on their networking teams\nin order to do their jobs, and yet they also don\u2019t need to cause downstream\ntrouble with existing network infrastructure. They need an easier way to\nconnect subnets, for instance, without feeling held back by bureaucracy.\n\n### Agent/proxy-based site-to-site connectivity\n\nTo help push these security-led projects past the challenges associated with\ntraditional siloes, Cloudflare offers both agent/proxy-based and\nappliance/routing-based implementations for site-to-site or subnet-to-subnet\nconnectivity. This way, networking teams can pursue the traditional networking\nconcepts with which they are familiar through our appliance/routing-based\nWANaaS \u2014 a modern architecture vs. legacy SD-WAN overlays. Simultaneously,\nsecurity/IT teams can achieve connectivity through agent/proxy-based software\nconnectors (like the WARP Connector) that may be more approachable to\nimplement. This agent-based approach blurs the lines between industry norms\nfor branch connectors and app connectors, bringing WAN and ZTNA technology\ncloser together to help achieve least-privileged access everywhere.\n\nAgent/proxy-based connectivity may be a complementary fit for a subset of an\norganization's total network connectivity. These software-driven site-to-site\nuse cases could include microsites with no router or firewall, or perhaps\ncases in which teams are unable to configure IPsec or GRE tunnels like in\ntightly regulated managed networks or cloud environments like Kubernetes.\nOrganizations can mix and match traffic on-ramps to fit their needs; all\noptions can be used composably and concurrently.\n\nOur agent/proxy-based approach to site-to-site connectivity uses the same\nunderlying technology that helps security teams fully replace VPNs, supporting\nZTNA for apps with server-initiated or bidirectional traffic. These include\nservices such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Session Initiation\nProtocol (SIP) traffic, Microsoft\u2019s System Center Configuration Manager\n(SCCM), Active Directory (AD) domain replication, and as detailed later in\nthis blog, DevOps workflows.\n\nThis new Cloudflare on-ramp enables site-to-site, bidirectional, and mesh\nnetworking connectivity without requiring changes to underlying network\nrouting infrastructure, acting as a router for the subnet within the private\nnetwork to on-ramp and off-ramp traffic through Cloudflare.\n\n## More efficient for networking teams\n\nMeanwhile, for networking teams who prefer a network-layer appliance/routing-\nbased implementation for site-to-site connectivity, the industry norms still\nforce too many tradeoffs between security, performance, cost, and reliability.\nMany (if not most) large enterprises still rely on legacy forms of private\nconnectivity such as MPLS. MPLS is generally considered expensive and\ninflexible, but it is highly reliable and has features such as quality of\nservice (QoS) that are used for bandwidth management.\n\nCommodity Internet connectivity is widely available in most parts of the\ninhabited world, but has a number of challenges which make it an imperfect\nreplacement to MPLS. In many countries, high speed Internet is fast and cheap,\nbut this is not universally true. Speed and costs depend on the local\ninfrastructure and the market for regional service providers. In general,\nbroadband Internet is also not as reliable as MPLS. Outages and slowdowns are\nnot unusual, with customers having varying degrees of tolerance to the\nfrequency and duration of disrupted service. For businesses, outages and\nslowdowns are not tolerable. Disruptions to network service means lost\nbusiness, unhappy customers, lower productivity and frustrated employees.\nThus, despite the fact that a significant amount of corporate traffic flows\nhave shifted to the Internet anyway, many organizations face difficulty\nmigrating away from MPLS.\n\nSD-WAN introduced an alternative to MPLS that is transport neutral and\nimproves networking stability over conventional broadband alone. However, it\nintroduces new topology and security challenges. For example, many SD-WAN\nimplementations can increase risk if they bypass inspection between branches.\nIt also has implementation-specific challenges such as how to address scaling\nand the use/control (or more precisely, the lack of) a middle mile. Thus, the\npromise of making a full cutover to Internet connectivity and eliminating MPLS\nremains unfulfilled for many organizations. These issues are also not very\napparent to some customers at the time of purchase and require continuing\nmarket education.\n\n### Evolution of the enterprise WAN\n\nCloudflare Magic WAN follows a different paradigm built from the ground up in\nCloudflare's connectivity cloud; it takes a \"light branch, heavy cloud\"\napproach to augment and eventually replace existing network architectures\nincluding MPLS circuits and SD-WAN overlays. While Magic WAN has similar\ncloud-native routing and configuration controls to what customers would expect\nfrom traditional SD-WAN, it is easier to deploy, manage, and consume. It\nscales with changing business requirements, with security built in. Customers\nlike Solocal agree that the benefits of this architecture ultimately improve\ntheir total cost of ownership:\n\n> \"Cloudflare's Magic WAN Connector offers a centralized and automated\n> management of network and security infrastructure, in an intuitive approach.\n> As part of Cloudflare\u2019s SASE platform, it provides a consistent and\n> homogeneous single-vendor architecture, founded on market standards and best\n> practices. Control over all data flows is ensured, and risks of breaches or\n> security gaps are reduced. It is obvious to Solocal that it should provide\n> us with significant savings, by reducing all costs related to acquiring,\n> installing, maintaining, and upgrading our branch network appliances by up\n> to 40%. A high-potential connectivity solution for our IT to modernize our\n> network.\" \u2013 Maxime Lacour, Network Operations Manager, Solocal\n\nThis is quite different from other single-vendor SASE vendor approaches which\nhave been trying to reconcile acquisitions that were designed around\nfundamentally different design philosophies. These \u201cstitched together\u201d\nsolutions lead to a non-converged experience due to their fragmented\narchitectures, similar to what organizations might see if they were managing\nmultiple separate vendors anyway. Consolidating the components of SASE with a\nvendor that has built a unified, integrated solution, versus piecing together\ndifferent solutions for networking and security, significantly simplifies\ndeployment and management by reducing complexity, bypassed security, and\npotential integration or connectivity challenges.\n\nMagic WAN can automatically establish IPsec tunnels to Cloudflare via our\nConnector device, manually via Anycast IPsec or GRE Tunnels initiated on a\ncustomer\u2019s edge router or firewall, or via Cloudflare Network Interconnect\n(CNI) at private peering locations or public cloud instances. It pushes beyond\n\u201cintegration\u201d claims with SSE to truly converge security and networking\nfunctionality and help organizations more efficiently modernize their\nnetworks.\n\n### New Magic WAN Connector capabilities\n\nIn October 2023, we announced the general availability of the Magic WAN\nConnector, a lightweight device that customers can drop into existing network\nenvironments for zero-touch connectivity to Cloudflare One, and ultimately\nused to replace other networking hardware such as legacy SD-WAN devices,\nrouters, and firewalls. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce new capabilities of\nthe Magic WAN Connector including:\n\n  * High Availability (HA) configurations for critical environments: In enterprise deployments, organizations generally desire support for high availability to mitigate the risk of hardware failure. High availability uses a pair of Magic WAN Connectors (running as a VM or on a supported hardware device) that work in conjunction with one another to seamlessly resume operation if one device fails. Customers can manage HA configuration, like all other aspects of the Magic WAN Connector, from the unified Cloudflare One dashboard.\n  * Application awareness: One of the central differentiating features of SD-WAN vs. more traditional networking devices has been the ability to create traffic policies based on well-known applications, in addition to network-layer attributes like IP and port ranges. Application-aware policies provide easier management and more granularity over traffic flows. Cloudflare\u2019s implementation of application awareness leverages the intelligence of our global network, using the same categorization/classification already shared across security tools like our Secure Web Gateway, so IT and security teams can expect consistent behavior across routing and inspection decisions - a capability not available in dual-vendor or stitched-together SASE solutions.\n  * Virtual machine deployment option: The Magic WAN Connector is now available as a virtual appliance software image, that can be downloaded for immediate deployment on any supported virtualization platform / hypervisor. The virtual Magic WAN Connector has the same ultra-low-touch deployment model and centralized fleet management experience as the hardware appliance, and is offered to all Magic WAN customers at no additional cost.\n  * Enhanced visibility and analytics: The Magic WAN Connector features enhanced visibility into key metrics such as connectivity status, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and device temperature. These analytics are available via dashboard and API so operations teams can integrate the data into their NOCs.\n\n## Extending SASE\u2019s reach to DevOps\n\nComplex continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline\ninteraction is famous for being agile, so the connectivity and security\nsupporting these workflows should match. DevOps teams too often rely on\ntraditional VPNs to accomplish remote access to various development and\noperational tools. VPNs are cumbersome to manage, susceptible to exploit with\nknown or zero-day vulnerabilities, and use a legacy hub-and-spoke connectivity\nmodel that is too slow for modern workflows.\n\nOf any employee group, developers are particularly capable of finding creative\nworkarounds that decrease friction in their daily workflows, so all corporate\nsecurity measures need to \u201cjust work,\u201d without getting in their way. Ideally,\nall users and servers across build, staging, and production environments\nshould be orchestrated through centralized, Zero Trust access controls, no\nmatter what components and tools are used and no matter where they are\nlocated. Ad hoc policy changes should be accommodated, as well as temporary\nZero Trust access for contractors or even emergency responders during a\nproduction server incident.\n\n### Zero Trust connectivity for DevOps\n\nZTNA works well as an industry paradigm for secure, least-privileged user-to-\napp access, but it should extend further to secure networking use cases that\ninvolve server-initiated or bidirectional traffic. This follows an emerging\ntrend that imagines an overlay mesh connectivity model across clouds, VPCs, or\nnetwork segments without a reliance on routers. For true any-to-any\nconnectivity, customers need flexibility to cover all of their network\nconnectivity and application access use cases. Not every SASE vendor\u2019s network\non-ramps can extend beyond client-initiated traffic without requiring network\nrouting changes or making security tradeoffs, so generic \"any-to-any\nconnectivity\" claims may not be what they initially seem.\n\nCloudflare extends the reach of ZTNA to ensure all user-to-app use cases are\ncovered, plus mesh and P2P secure networking to make connectivity options as\nbroad and flexible as possible. DevOps service-to-service workflows can run\nefficiently on the same platform that accomplishes ZTNA, VPN replacement, or\nenterprise-class SASE. Cloudflare acts as the connectivity \u201cglue\u201d across all\nDevOps users and resources, regardless of the flow of traffic at each step.\nThis same technology, i.e., WARP Connector, enables admins to manage different\nprivate networks with overlapping IP ranges \u2014 VPC & RFC1918, support server-\ninitiated traffic and P2P apps (e.g., SCCM, AD, VoIP & SIP traffic)\nconnectivity over existing private networks, build P2P private networks (e.g.,\nCI/CD resource flows), and deterministically route traffic. Organizations can\nalso automate management of their SASE platform with Cloudflare\u2019s Terraform\nprovider.\n\n## The Cloudflare difference\n\nCloudflare\u2019s single-vendor SASE platform, Cloudflare One, is built on our\nconnectivity cloud \u2014 the next evolution of the public cloud, providing a\nunified, intelligent platform of programmable, composable services that enable\nconnectivity between all networks (enterprise and Internet), clouds, apps, and\nusers. Our connectivity cloud is flexible enough to make \"any-to-any\nconnectivity\" a more approachable reality for organizations implementing a\nSASE architecture, accommodating deployment preferences alongside prescriptive\nguidance. Cloudflare is built to offer the breadth and depth needed to help\norganizations regain IT control through single-vendor SASE and beyond, while\nsimplifying workflows for every team that contributes along the way.\n\nOther SASE vendors designed their data centers for egress traffic to the\nInternet. They weren\u2019t designed to handle or secure East-West traffic,\nproviding neither middle mile nor security services for traffic passing from\nbranch to HQ or branch to branch. Cloudflare\u2019s middle mile global backbone\nsupports security and networking for any-to-any connectivity, whether users\nare on-prem or remote, and whether apps are in the data center or in the\ncloud.\n\nTo learn more, read our reference architecture, \u201cEvolving to a SASE\narchitecture with Cloudflare,\u201d or talk to a Cloudflare One expert.\n\nWe protect entire corporate networks, help customers build Internet-scale\napplications efficiently, accelerate any website or Internet application, ward\noff DDoS attacks, keep hackers at bay, and can help you on your journey to\nZero Trust.\n\nVisit 1.1.1.1 from any device to get started with our free app that makes your\nInternet faster and safer.\n\nTo learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, start here.\nIf you're looking for a new career direction, check out our open positions.\n\nDiscuss on Hacker News\n\nSASEZero TrustDevOpsCloudflare OneMagic WANWARP ConnectorProduct News\n\nFollow on X\n\nCloudflare|@cloudflare\n\nRelated posts\n\nMarch 20, 2024 1:00 PM\n\n## Introducing WARP Connector: paving the path to any-to-any connectivity\n\nStarting today, Zero Trust administrators can deploy our new WARP Connector\nfor simplified any-to-any connectivity...\n\nBy\n\n  * Abe Carryl,\n\n  * Janani Rajendiran\n\nCloudflare Tunnel, Product News, WARP, Zero Trust, SASE\n\nMarch 14, 2024 12:30 PM\n\n## Mitigating a token-length side-channel attack in our AI products\n\nThe Workers AI and AI Gateway team recently collaborated closely with security\nresearchers at Ben Gurion University regarding a report submitted through our\nPublic Bug Bounty program.
