Today, a rather different flavor\nof animal crime has become ascendent \u2014 the theft of bees.\n\nEvery year, the bloom of thousands of almond trees in California spurs one of\nthe world\u2019s largest, albeit artificial, migrations of animals; as billions of\nhoneybees are loaded onto trucks and sent to deliver lucrative pollination\nfees for their human keepers. This insect odyssey ensures paydays for often\nstruggling beekeepers, the production of most of the world\u2019s almonds, and\nincreasingly, an opportunity for enterprising thieves.\n\nStanding in the way of the bee rustlers \u2014 often alone \u2014 is Rowdy Freeman, a\ndeputy at the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office in California\u2019s Central Valley.\nFreeman is a steely sort of bee detective. Angular, with a shaved head and\nfond of wearing wrap-around sunglasses, the taciturn deputy is a beekeeper\nhimself and is aghast at how hive thefts have become so ubiquitous.\n\nLast year, according to Freeman calculations, a record of more than 2,300\nhoneybee hives were stolen in the Central Valley. This year\u2019s thefts could\neasily surpass that number, with Freeman recording nearly 2,000 hives stolen\nalready. Despite the growing scale of this crime, Freeman is typically the\nonly law enforcement officer working with beekeepers to track the stolen hives\nand their thieves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get more help for this because it\u2019s become a major problem,\nit\u2019s getting out of control,\u201d Freeman said. While California has state\nbranches devoted to stamping out the theft of horses or cattle, no such task\nforce exists for bees, he notes with no small amount of envy and frustration.\nThe federal government is also uninterested in the issue, despite what Freeman\ndescribes as clear-cut evidence that stolen hives have been transported over\nstate lines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state of California has done nothing to help.\u201d\n\n## The Honeybee Era\n\nHorses and cattle may be the antecedents to bees in terms of human thievery,\nbut the scale involved here is very different. Farmers have carpeted huge\nswathes of prime Central Valley land with serried ranks of almond trees. The\nannual budding of this sought-after nut and its burgeoning pollination needs\nmeans up to roughly nine out of every 10 commercial honeybee hives must be\nsent here from all corners of the U.S.\n\nFor some time at the start of each year, the Central Valley becomes a sort of\ngiant, mechanized jamboree of honeybees, with 18-wheelers and semis bearing\nseveral million hives traversing this monoculture and depositing their cargo\nin orchards to propagate the crop. We are accustomed to aggregating sheep and\ncows and, to a lesser degree at home, our cats and dogs. But in terms of the\nsheer numbers \u2014 2.7 million hives, according to Wenger, or a lowball estimate\nof some 54 billion bees to support this year\u2019s almond crop \u2014 there is little\nto compare to the annual seething mass of bees clustered in California outside\nof enthralling wild scenes like the African migration of wildebeest.\n\n\u201cIt makes you think you\u2019re reading an old western about moving 7,000 head of\ncattle across the high plains,\u201d said Jacob Wenger, an entomologist at\nCalifornia State University, Fresno. \u201cBut even then, it wasn\u2019t 90% of all the\nbeef cattle in the United States.\u201d\n\nDespite the numbers of hives involved and the lucrative fees beekeepers can\nnow charge growers for their tiny winged contractors, security around this\nenterprise is usually fairly lax. Hives are trucked in, often by third-party\ncrews, and unloaded in orchards or holding lots that are rarely gated, fenced\nor guarded, and easily visible from the road.\n\nAmid the frenzy of this seasonal activity, semi-trucks will sometimes load or\nunload hives in the dead of night. Given Central Valley farmland\u2019s sprawling,\nhorizon-busting nature, a visitor might not even be seen at all. In such\nconditions, a truck, a smattering of local knowledge and opportunism is all\nthat\u2019s needed to spirit away tens of thousands of dollars of humming property.\n\nIn January, Victor Lazo, who has kept bees in the Houston area for the past\ndecade, sent around 4,000 colonies to the Central Valley for almond season.\nAfter the truck crew dropped off the hives in an orchard, Lazo arrived to feed\nthem and treat them for any disease; to his shock, he discovered a whole row \u2014\n168 hives in all \u2014 had vanished.\n\n\u201cWhile California has state branches devoted to stamping out the theft of\nhorses or cattle, no such task force exists for bees.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n\u201cMy first reaction was that the guys had set them down in the wrong spot,\u201d\nLazo said. His hives didn\u2019t have GPS trackers on them (a technological fix\nsome beekeepers have resorted to), but the truck did, and the GPS showed it\nhad stopped at the correct spot. The hives had vanished into the underworld of\nbee thievery and would likely reappear in a different guise when sold to a\ngrower, or to supplement another beekeeper\u2019s diminished stock.\n\n\u201cThe growers don\u2019t care where the hives come from as long as they have hives\nout there,\u201d Lazo explained. \u201cFor now, I\u2019ve just written them off. It\u2019s like\nfinding a needle in a haystack \u2014 it\u2019s hard to catch a thief unless you catch\nthem doing it. It\u2019s been a really bad year in California for theft.\u201d\n\nSometimes the bee rustling is bad enough that it wipes out a whole business.\nJames Steinbrugger, 40, a California native who has kept bees since he was a\n13-year-old, left his stash near the small town of Five Points to help a\nfellow beekeeper unload his hives last year. When he returned to his stash of\nbees, he was astonished to find every single one \u2014 some 408 colonies\ncontaining an estimated eight million honeybees \u2014 had been pilfered.\n\n\u201cIt basically put me out of the bee business,\u201d said a dejected Steinbrugger,\nwho now works on construction jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s big money. These crooks didn\u2019t have\nto do all the upkeep, the financials of it. They just get a truck, rip people\noff and get paid.\u201d\n\n## Bee Thief Gangs\n\nAs a detective working these cases, Freeman looks for clues like tire tracks\nin the mud. But most leads come through the information bouncing around the\nfraternity of mostly male beekeepers who congregate in California each year.\nThe reality is that given the specialized knowledge necessary to handle\nloading millions of buzzing flying creatures speedily and safely onto trucks\nat night, such thievery almost certainly involves an inside man \u2014 another\nmember of this beekeeping brethren.\n\nLately, the talk in beekeeping circles has been about whether the surging\nthefts are the work of the typical solo opportunists wanting to supplement a\nbad year, or a larger and more organized effort. The theft of hundreds of\nhives in one go, like in Steinbrugger\u2019s case, pointed to the latter. Such an\nefficient heist points to a level of organization that only a criminal group,\nor gang, could pull off.\n\nThe closest police have come to breaking up such a gang was after Alexa\nPavlov, a Missouri-based beekeeper, received a tip in 2017 that some of her\nstolen hives might be found in a patch of scrubby land a few miles outside\nFresno, California. Pavlov jumped on a plane and went straight to the site,\nwhich police later described as a \u201cchop shop for bees.\u201d Clouds of bees flew\naround dozens of scattered boxes belonging to different beekeepers, some of\nwhich appeared to be in the process of being split apart. Nearby, a gaunt\n51-year-old Pavel Tveretinov, was spotted tending to this Frankenstein-like\napiary. Pavlov contacted police who subsequently arrested and charged\nTveretinov along with an accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko.\n\nThe haul was extraordinary. There were more than 2,500 hives, valued at nearly\n$1 million, belonging to a dozen beekeepers, stolen over several years.\n\nPolice indicated that the duo had traversed the Central Valley selling their\nstolen goods to unsuspecting growers for the previous three years and had been\naided by the close-knit Ukrainian-Russian beekeeping community centered in\nSacramento.\n\nRead Noema in print.\n\nThe detail stoked ugly, racist suspicions among some beekeepers. Yeroshenko\nultimately pleaded no contest to receiving stolen property, and in 2021 was\nsentenced to four years probation and ordered to pay $13,000 in restitution.\nTveretinov insisted he was innocent but then died of cancer in 2020 before the\ncase against him concluded.\n\nDenise Qualls, who works as a pollination broker \u2014 a sort of middleman\nconnecting almond growers with beekeepers \u2014 noted that the ongoing organized\nthefts point to other criminal groups still at play.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s a collaborative effort,\u201d Qualls said. \u201cBack in the day it was\nsort of random, a few hives here and there. But when it\u2019s a couple of hundred\nhives in multiple locations, it\u2019s not your average agricultural crime tweaker\nlooking to resell for drugs. It\u2019s bigger than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hives had vanished into the underworld of bee thievery and would likely\nreappear in a different guise.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nQualls said she recently received a call from a beekeeper \u201cof that\nnationality\u201d who asked to inspect some bees she was overseeing at a holding\nyard in Stanislaus County. The man marched around the yard, which held around\n1,500 hives belonging to various beekeepers looking to be matched with\ngrowers, pulling out frames and demanding that Qualls provide hives with a\nbrood, or the eggs, larvae and pupae of honeybees to repopulate a colony.\n\nThis was unusual behavior, Qualls said, and she turned him away. \u201cI just had a\nbad feel about it, and I said it wasn\u2019t a good fit,\u201d she said. Qualls was\nkeenly aware of the yard\u2019s lack of security \u2014 with no fence or cameras \u2014 as\nwell as the toll taken by hive thefts. \u201cHe could just come back and take\nsome,\u201d she said. \u201cBeekeepers are getting kind of tired of it, really. It\u2019s\nyour livelihood. It\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\n## The Ideal Mobile Pollinator\n\nThe Western honeybee \u2014 or apis mellifera \u2014 is among the most successful of all\nmigrants to America. First brought over on wooden ships by European settlers\nin the 17th century, honeybees have since established themselves not only as a\ncrucial cog in the agricultural system, but they have also flourished in the\npublic imagination.\n\nConjure up thoughts of a bee and you\u2019ll likely think of a black and yellow\nstriped creature with a stinger that lives in a hive with thousands of\ncomrades making honey. But that image of a honeybee is just one of around\n20,000 species of bee, most of them solitary and wild. \u201cThere are relatively\nfew bee species that get love and care from humans,\u201d said James Nieh, a bee\nexpert at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe word \u2018bee\u2019 is boiled\ndown to honeybee.\u201d\n\nFor agricultural workers, honeybees are the only bee worth thinking about.\nApis mellifera are superb generalists, able to quickly learn how to pollinate\nmore than 130 types of fruits and vegetables, from apples to cherries to\npumpkins.\n\nThanks to the invention of the modern beehive \u2014 a usually wooden box with\nvertically hanging, removable frames into which bees build their honeycomb,\ndevised by Ohio clergyman Lorenzo Langstroth in the 19th century \u2014 they can\nalso be moved around relatively easily. These bees are the key to unlocking\nmassive yields across American farmland that have been supersized and shorn of\nits natural surroundings, including wild pollinators.\n\n\u201cThey are like the ideal mobile pollinator,\u201d Wenger, the entomologist, said.\n\u201cWe built these large artificial food systems that are reliant on bees so\nthen, yeah, honeybee ecology is going to become more and more artificial,\nfurther separated from its natural conditions.\u201d\n\nTo grow a lot of almonds you need a lot of bees. The plants need plenty of\ncross-pollination and will keep producing nuts until they start falling off\nthe tree. The global growth in demand has prompted farmers across the Central\nValley to blanket the countryside with these distinctive, white-blossomed\ntrees. Today, around 1.4 million acres, mostly in the Central Valley, is used\nto produce roughly 80% of the world\u2019s almonds.\n\n## Troubling Times For Bee Shepherds\n\nThe industrialized honeybee has replaced the bucolic image of honey-producing\nhomesteaders. Each honeybee hive can now command up to $225 in pollination\nfees, a sizable jump on what it once was.\n\nBut while there are financial rewards for beekeepers, it\u2019s harder for the\nbees. Almond pollination occurs in January and February when the hives\u2019 bees\nare at the groggiest and weakest points in their lifecycle; they must be\nspurred into shape by a procession of treatments and feeds. The bees are\nloaded onto trucks to make their prolonged journeys to the Central Valley, in\nsome cases traveling more than 1,000 miles. This forced migration, with its\nfumes and vibrations, can also harm the tiny passengers.\n\nThis is all occurring as more honeybees die over the winter months. In the\npast decade, beekeepers have lost as much as 40% of their bee populations\nduring these coldest months, as a growing list of ills assails the species.\nWildflower habitat is being torn up, depriving honeybees of nutrition beyond\nsingle monoculture crops like almonds; the hives themselves have been attacked\nby diseases, widespread crop pesticides and afflictions such as the varroa\nmite \u2014 a parasite that feeds on the bees\u2019 young, causing malformations and\nweakness and in some cases completely wiping out colonies.\n\n\u201cTo grow a lot of almonds you need a lot of bees.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n\u201cMy biggest stress is keeping my employees alive,\u201d said Jeffrey Lee, a\nbeekeeper in North Carolina who estimates that he loses 10% of his bees each\ntime he sends them to California. Lee describes himself as a \u201cbee shepherd,\u201d\nwho guides his indentured workers on a tour around the country for different\npollination demands \u2014 blueberries in Maine, almonds in California, then\ncucumbers back in North Carolina.\n\nIt\u2019s getting harder to maintain bee numbers, according to Lee, with the\nendless routine of medical treatments, supplemental feedings and occasional\nmishaps, like drunk drivers barreling into hives or tractors running them\nover, only adding to the stresses. Operating costs are already high so many\nbeekeepers don\u2019t want the added expense of security for their hives.\n\nIn addition, the insect population is also declining, and scientists warn this\ncould threaten basic ecological functions, including food production, due to\nhabitat loss, chemical use and the climate crisis. There is already evidence\nof falling blueberry crop yields in the U.S. due to a lack of pollinators,\nwhile in parts of China, workers have had to use paintbrushes daubed in pollen\nat orchards to make up for the lost bees.\n\nUnlike wild bees, honeybees have been mostly shielded from catastrophic colony\nloss by their human guardians. Meanwhile, the American bumblebee, once the\nmost commonly observed bumblebee in the U.S., has suffered an 89% drop in\nabundance and vanished from at least eight states over the past two decades,\naccording to a 2021 petition filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and\na group of Albany Law School students arguing that the American bumblebee\nshould be listed as an endangered species.\n\nHoneybees may be a good mascot for a campaign to save the bees, but they\u2019re\n\u201ckind of like the chickens of the bee world,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThey really are\nbred for human purposes. It\u2019s like saying we are protecting bird diversity by\nputting in more chicken farms.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s a bad idea to have a food system hinge on a single pollinator\nspecies. Scientists have worked on creating self-fertilizing almond trees,\nengineering so-called Frankenbees or pesticide-resistant honeybees, and\nlooking at maybe even deploying pollinating robotic bees or drones. But\nultimately, it\u2019s measures that help all insect life and ecosystems such as\ncutting carbon emissions, rewilding sterile farmland and slashing pesticides\nand other poisons that may provide a longer-term solution.\n\nIn the meantime, the wheels of Central Valley industry continue to turn. Some\nfarmers have eyed the dip in the global almond price, plus concerns over\nprolonged drought and new state rules over groundwater use that could make it\nharder to grow this thirsty nut, and started thinking about the next cash\ncrop; perhaps pistachios, since they are pollinated via the wind. That would\nleave less work for the bees, and possibly decrease the amount of beehive\ntheft. But until a more drastic change, the crimes continue to rise.\n\nFor beekeepers contemplating whether it\u2019s worth cashing in on the still\nlucrative Central Valley pollination market, Freeman frames their dilemma:\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to weigh your odds \u2014 do you want to gamble on making some money\nand hope your hives don\u2019t get stolen?\u201d\n\nEnjoy the read?
