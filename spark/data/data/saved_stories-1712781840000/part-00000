(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nListen\n\n3 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nA federal program that has helped roughly 23 million American households\nreceive free or heavily discounted high-speed internet is set to see sharp\ncuts in May, leaving many low-income families facing possible price hikes \u2014 or\nthe imminent loss of service altogether.\n\nCongress has not yet approved new money for the digital initiative, so the\nFederal Communications Commission announced Tuesday that it would have to\nreduce the maximum payment: Many will see their subsidies fall to $14 per\nmonth, less than half of what some now receive toward their broadband bills.\n\nThe looming change could mean a price hike for low-income families in the\nAffordable Connectivity Program, if the reduced federal aid isn\u2019t enough to\ncover the full cost of their service. But the exact effects ultimately depend\non internet providers, which can offer their own discounts \u2014 or simply elect\nto stop accepting federal subsidies in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAT&T, Charter, Comcast, Verizon and other companies have not fully detailed\nhow they will handle the matter if the cuts kick in \u2014 or whether they plan to\nprovide other financial relief to low-income families that could see rising\nbills. None of the four companies contacted immediately responded to requests\nfor comment on Tuesday.\n\nIn a blog post last week, AT&T pointed subscribers toward its existing low-\ncost option, which costs $30 per month. The company did not say whether would\naccept partial federal subsidies in May.\n\n\u201cWe encourage providers to take efforts to keep consumers connected at this\ncrucial time,\u201d the FCC said in a public notice.\n\nThe FCC notice arrived a day after the White House renewed its calls for\nCongress to approve new emergency funding for the Affordable Connectivity\nProgram, which lawmakers enacted as part of a sprawling 2021 bipartisan law to\nimprove the nation\u2019s infrastructure. The idea originated in the coronavirus\npandemic, as Democrats and Republicans looked to ensure that cash-strapped\nfamilies \u2014 many thrust out of jobs \u2014 could continue to work, learn and\ncommunicate online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nLawmakers this year have had multiple opportunities to address the funding\nshortfall, but they have repeatedly failed to act, even as part of a deal to\nfund the government that they adopted last month. Their next opportunity may\narrive in the coming weeks, when Congress weighs emergency legislation that\nwould provision new aid to Ukraine and reconstruction money for the collapsed\nFrancis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cWithout congressional action to extend funding for the program, those 23\nmillion households and families will lose that benefit and will see internet\ncosts go up or lose internet access,\u201d Stephen Benjamin, a senior adviser to\nthe president, said on a recent call with reporters.\n\nAnticipating a shortfall, the FCC began taking steps earlier this year to wind\ndown the Affordable Connectivity Program. It halted new sign-ups in February\nand ordered internet providers in March to begin communicating with customers\nabout the potential end of the program.\n\nPreviewing the cuts, the FCC said Tuesday that most qualified households would\nreceive $14 per month, down from the $30 they had received. For those living\non tribal lands, the maximum monthly benefit would fall to $35 beginning in\nMay, down from $75. The initiative also allows families to receive a credit\nfor eligible devices, which would be reduced to $47 from the current $100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nThis is the most important app in America\n\nOpenAI prepares to fight for its life as legal troubles mount\n\nBiden administration announces major expansion for Ariz. chip facility\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": false}
