According to this line\nof thinking, there\u2019s no such thing as a fast or slow metabolism. Rather, your\nmetabolism is determined by your height, age, weight, lean mass, exercise\nhabits, and activity levels. There are two problems with this line of\nthinking.\n\nFirst, those variables can result in huge changes in metabolic rate. For\nexample, in a study published by Science, they found that a 180-pound person\ncould burn anywhere from 1,400 to 5,700 calories per day (study).\n\nSecond, even if you account for every single one of those variables,\nmetabolisms can still vary greatly between people. Even when living totally\naverage lifestyles, naturally skinny people often have unusually fast\nmetabolisms.\n\nLet\u2019s go over the research and implications. Then we can talk about how to\ngain weight and build muscle with a fast metabolism.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  1. Metabolic Variance Calculator\n  2. Why Do Some People Burn More Calories?\n\n    1.

How to Bulk With A Fast Metabolism\n  4. Conclusion\n\n## Metabolic Variance Calculator\n\nBefore we delve into the science, I made a quick calorie calculator that\nincludes variations in metabolism. To make it, I looked at the standard\ndeviation in a few metabolism studies (study, study, study). Then I factored\nthat into the Cunningham Equation (which does a good job of accounting for\nvariances in lean mass).\n\nThe calculator measures your resting metabolic rate: how many calories you\nburn while staying completely still. It shows that our baseline metabolisms\ncan be quite different. As in, two people with the same body composition,\neating the same diets, and doing the same things can have different calorie\nneeds. Variations in diet (TEF), exercise habits (EAT), and activity levels\n(NEAT) would drive the disparity even wider.\n\n### The Metabolic Variance Wizard\n\n#### RMR Calculator\n\nPeople can have very different metabolisms, especially at the far reaches of\nthe bell curve. If you\u2019re unusually thin, as many of us are, it\u2019s not\nunreasonable to think you have an unusually fast metabolism. If you have\ntrouble gaining weight, even when trying to eat more food, as many of us do,\nthat inkling becomes all the more reasonable.\n\nNow, there\u2019s no magic going on here. The calories are going somewhere. And I\nknow where some of them are going.\n\n## Why Do Some People Burn More Calories?\n\n### Skinny People Have Greater Surface Areas\n\nThe first reason has to do with our surface area. Thinner people have more\nsurface area per unit of mass. This gives us less insulation, meaning we need\nto spend more energy keeping our bodies warm.\n\nThis can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. On the bright side, we can\nget rid of extra heat more efficiently, keeping us from overheating as we\njourney across savannas and Saharas. On the dark side, we\u2019re less equipped to\nweather the long nights of the cold north.\n\n### Skinny People Have More Expensive Lean Mass\n\nYou might have heard that muscle burns more calories than fat. That\u2019s true. A\npound of muscle burns around 6 calories per day at rest, whereas fat only\nburns around 2. If we factor in the energy it costs to carry that mass around,\nwe\u2019re looking at about 12 and 8 calories, respectively. I covered all the\nresearch on that here.\n\nWhat you may not know is that our organs burn more calories than muscle. Your\nheart, lungs, kidneys, and liver burn around 10\u201320x more calories per pound\nper day than muscle (study). If you\u2019re thin, a higher portion of your lean\nmass comes from your organs, causing you to burn more calories per pound of\nlean mass.\n\nThe best calorie calculators factor in lean mass and body-fat percentage, but\nthey don\u2019t factor in how muscular you are. Even the calculators that factor in\nheight don\u2019t do a great job of accounting for those differences (study).\n\n### Adaptive Thermogenesis\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis is when your metabolism adapts to your energy needs\n(study). For example, when people try to lose weight, they eat fewer calories,\nso their metabolism adapts, slowing down. Some people call this \u201cstarvation\nmode.\u201d It\u2019s often exaggerated, but it\u2019s real, at least in the way I\u2019m\nexplaining it here (study, study).\n\nYour metabolism can adapt to a higher calorie intake, too. If you eat more\ncalories than you need, your metabolism can speed up, burning away some of the\nsurplus. This happens more to some people than others. So-called \u201chardgainers\u201d\nhave especially adaptive metabolisms (study).\n\nThe main way that your body adjusts its metabolism is by adjusting your\nactivity levels (NEAT). People losing weight often become more sedentary,\nspending more time lounging. People gaining weight can become more energetic,\nspending more time pacing and fidgeting (study).\n\nHowever, your resting metabolism can adapt, too (study). As you get deeper\ninto a bulk, you may find you\u2019re burning more calories, even if you aren\u2019t\nmoving more. When you compare your resting metabolism to someone who\u2019s been\ntrying to lose weight, there can be a large difference.\n\n### Genetic Differences Are A Thing\n\nThese are just three factors. I\u2019m sure there are many more. Most human traits\nfall on a bell curve, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) is no exception. Just\nlike height, weight, and other physical attributes, our resting metabolic\nrates seem to exhibit a normal distribution in the population, with the\nmajority of people clustering around the mean and fewer at the extremes.\n\n## How to Bulk With A Fast Metabolism\n\nI wrote an article on Outlift about how to gain weight with a fast metabolism.\nIf you\u2019re curious about how many calories you burn, it dives even deeper,\ncovering lifestyle factors like activity levels. More importantly, it talks\nabout what you can do to bulk up.\n\nI also made a calorie calculator that adjusts for the factors discussed in\nthis article. It\u2019s a bulking calculator, so it lets you pick how quickly you\nwant to gain weight, then recommends an appropriate calorie surplus for your\ngoals. It\u2019s not perfect\u2014no calorie calculator is\u2014but it will give you a great\nstarting point.\n\nThe real trick is to weigh yourself every week and adjust your calorie intake\naccordingly. If you aren\u2019t gaining weight, you aren\u2019t in a calorie surplus, so\nyou need to eat a little more food. It\u2019s tough, I know, but it works\ntremendously well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost people burn a fairly normal number of calories at rest, explaining how\nthis \u201cyou don\u2019t have a fast metabolism\u201d myth got such a fierce stranglehold on\nthe fitness industry. But some people have much higher or lower metabolisms.\nIf you feel like your metabolism is particularly fast, you may be right.\n\nWhat\u2019s neat is that as you bulk up, your surface area and lean mass will\nbecome more normal. I used to feel like I a lot for a 130-pound guy, whereas\nnow I feel like I eat a normal amount for a 190-pound guy. I eat more now, but\nit lines up with my appetite and expectations. To my great surprise, it became\nmuch easier to eat enough food.\n\nAlright, that\u2019s it for now.
