[+] prospects.\n\nGetty Images for The New York Times\n\n## Key Facts\n\nThe odds of a goldilocks soft landing outcome for the economy are \u201ca lot\nlower\u201d than the consensus of a 70% to 80% likelihood, Dimon outlined in his\nannual letter to JPMorgan shareholders Monday.\n\nCoupled with Dimon\u2019s concerns about the potential for \u201cstagflation,\u201d a\nrecession characterized by lingering high inflation, he warned interest rates\ncould soar to \u201c8% or even more,\u201d a far cry from the already 22-year high rates\nof over 5% and going against conventional wisdom of a looming decline in rates\n(U.S. interest rates have not been 8% or higher since 1990).\n\nDimon explained there are several \u201cpersistent inflationary pressures\u201d which\ncould keep price increases sticky, including the rise in military conflict\nglobally and the lingering effects of aggressive policy from central banks\nworldwide coming out of the pandemic.\n\nThe billionaire Dimon also warned about the potential for carnage for both\nequity and debt investors should a higher-rate scenario play out, noting stock\nvaluations are already at their \u201chigh end\u201d and credit conditions are\n\u201cextremely tight.\u201d\n\n## Key Background\n\nDimon\u2019s warnings come as investor sentiment looks rosy\u2014major stock indexes sit\nat record highs as the market eagerly awaits lower interest rates. JPMorgan is\nby far the largest American bank by assets and market value, holding roughly\n$2.7 trillion in domestic assets by the end of last year. Dimon is worth about\n$2.2 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 latest estimates, owing most of his fortune\nto his stake in his bank. JPMorgan grew its already massive book by 6% last\nyear thanks in part to its May 2023 acquisition of failed regional bank First\nRepublic, a takeover Dimon characterized Monday as \u201csomething that we would\nhave done just for ourselves\u201d but rather a decision to stabilize the U.S.\nbanking system writ large.\n\n## Tangent\n\nThe tone of Dimon\u2019s wide-ranging 58-page note was not just alarmist: among\nDimon\u2019s positive observations was the impact of artificial intelligence, which\nhe likened to electricity, the printing press and the steam engine in terms of\npotential societal impact.\n\n## Crucial Quote\n\n\u201cI have a confession to make: I am a full-throated, red-blooded, patriotic,\nfree-enterprise (properly regulated, of course) and free-market capitalist,\u201d\nDimon wrote after beaming about his company\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion\n(DEI) initiatives, an apparent nod to the notion of DEI as a bogeyman among\nother billionaires and powerful figures.\n\n## What To Watch For\n\nJPMorgan will report first-quarter financial results Friday morning, kicking\noff earnings season.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
