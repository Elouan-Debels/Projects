One of these is that Substack is a time bomb. Turns out it blown\nup earlier than I imagined.\n\nIn August 2023, Substack released a weird new feature: a button to follow\npeople on its network. Why does a newsletter platform, which by definition\nemploys this feature (we \u201cfollow\u201d a newsletter when we subscribe to it), need\nto have a \u201cfollow\u201d button?\n\nAccording to the official blog post,\n\n> A follow offers a lightweight way to start a relationship with a writer or\n> reader, with the option to convert it into a subscription at any time. By\n> following them, you can stay up to date with what they\u2019re reading, liking,\n> publishing, and subscribing to\u2014through the Notes feed and on their profiles.\n\nThis is so \u201csocial media\u201d that Substack app asks for access to contacts to\nsynchronize them and discover friends who are also in the Substack.\n\nAt the end of 2023, newsletters owners on Substack noticed a change in\nbehavior on the platform, according to The Wrap: a significant increase in the\nnumber of followers on Substack and the stagnation of new subscribers to the\nnewsletters.\n\n***\n\nIt may seem just a detail, but it\u2019s in fact something very important. Signing\nup for a newsletter is the link that unites creator and followers. This link,\nalthough important, is straightforward: an e-mail address cession, an event\nthat is easy to understand and a data point easy to handle and move around.\n\nFrom the beginning, Substack has tried to differentiate itself from social\nplatforms that have turned followers into hostages \u2014 Facebook, Instagram,\nTwitter \u2014 by boasting the email portability. When someone wanted to leave \u2014 as\nmany did after the recent Nazi fiasco \u2014 it would be just a matter of taking\ntheir subscribers (their email addresses list, I mean) to another service.\n\nThe same doesn\u2019t apply to \u201cfollowers\u201d. These are Substack\u2019s. On the help page\nof the \u201cfollow\u201d feature, there is a question in this regard:\n\n> Do I get my followers\u2019 emails? If I leave Substack, can I get my follower\n> list?\n>\n> No. Following is a lighter weight action that helps potential subscribers\n> get to know you via notes before committing to a subscription.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201cembrace, extend, and extinguish\u201d playbook as crystal as it\u2019s\npossible, but in hyper speed (less than four years into making). The follow\nbutton marks the attempt to start up the extinguish phase, \u201cwhen extensions\nbecome a de facto standard because of their dominant market share, they\nmarginalize competitors who are unable to support the new extensions\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if Substack is already a de facto standard in newsletters realm,\nbut it seems they think they are.\n\n***\n\nWould the people who started or migrated their newsletters to Substack in the\nnewsletter boom from 2021 onwards make the move if they knew they were\ncommitting to another social media platform?\n\nAlso, note that this is not an isolated event. The follow button is just\nanother feature of several that, put together, turns Substack into a \u201cunique\u201d\nthing, in the sense of irreplaceable. Before it, we had an app, chat, Notes\n(their Twitter clone), direct messages (another thing that supplants the\nemail), mentions and cross-posting, videos (??), not to mention the newsletter\nrecommendation algorithm, full of dark patterns that help (or used to) inflate\nthe number of subscribers.\n\nThis prediction was an easy one. The signs were on the wall, growing, exposed\non the Substack\u2019s blog (or, should I sayi, its social profile?) in Substack\nitself.\n\nSometimes I look like a scratched record, but the truth is that it\u2019s\nincreasingly hard to trust startups backed by venture capital.\n\n\u00ab New family plans and pricing on Fastmail\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter:\n\nRodrigo Ghedin is a Brazilian journalist covering consumer tech for a small,\nindependent publication called Manual do Usu\u00e1rio.
