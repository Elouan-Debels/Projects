This week,\nthe Motion Picture Association (MPA), a group that represents six giant movie\nand TV studios, announced that it hoped we\u2019d all forgotten how dangerous this\nidea was. The MPA is wrong. We remember, and the internet remembers.\n\nWhat the MPA wants is the power to block entire websites, everywhere in the\nU.S., using the same tools as repressive regimes like China and Russia. To it,\ninstances of possible copyright infringement should be played like a trump\ncard to shut off our access to entire websites, regardless of the other legal\nspeech hosted there. It is not simply calling for the ability to take down\ninstances of infringement\u2014a power they already have, without even having to\nask a judge\u2014but for the keys to the internet. Building new architectures of\ncensorship would hurt everyone, and doesn\u2019t help artists.\n\nThe bills known as SOPA/PIPA would have created a new, rapid path for\ncopyright holders like the major studios to use court orders against sites\nthey accuse of infringing copyright. Internet service providers (ISPs)\nreceiving one of those orders would have to block all of their customers from\naccessing the identified websites. The orders would also apply to domain name\nregistries and registrars, and potentially other companies and organizations\nthat make up the internet\u2019s basic infrastructure. To comply, all of those\nwould have to build new infrastructure dedicated to site-blocking, inviting\nover-blocking and all kinds of abuse that would censor lawful and important\nspeech.\n\nIn other words, the right to choose what websites you visit would be taken\naway from you and given to giant media companies and ISPs. And the very shape\nof the internet would have to be changed to allow it.\n\nIn 2012, it seemed like SOPA/PIPA, backed by major corporations used to\ngetting what they want from Congress, was on the fast track to becoming law.\nBut a grassroots movement of diverse Internet communities came together to\nfight it. Digital rights groups like EFF, Public Knowledge, and many more\njoined with editor communities from sites like Reddit and Wikipedia to speak\nup. Newly formed grassroots groups like Demand Progress and Fight for the\nFuture added their voices to those calling out the dangers of this new form of\ncensorship. In the final days of the campaign, giant tech companies like\nGoogle and Facebook (now Meta) joined in opposition as well.\n\nWhat resulted was one of the biggest protests ever seen against a piece of\nlegislation. Congress was flooded with calls and emails from ordinary people\nconcerned about this steamroller of censorship. Members of Congress raced one\nanother to withdraw their support for the bills. The bills died, and so did\nsite blocking legislation in the US. It was, all told, a success story for the\npublic interest.\n\nEven the MPA, one of the biggest forces behind SOPA/PIPA, claimed to have\nmoved on. But we never believed it, and they proved us right time and time\nagain. The MPA backed site-blocking laws in other countries. Rightsholders\ncontinued to ask US courts for site-blocking orders, often winning them\nwithout a new law. Even the lobbying of Congress for a new law never really\nwent away. It\u2019s just that today, with MPA president Charles Rivkin openly\ncalling on Congress \u201cto enact judicial site-blocking legislation here in the\nUnited States,\u201d the MPA is taking its mask off.\n\nThings have changed since 2012. Tech platforms that were once seen as\ninnovators have become behemoths, part of the establishment rather than\nunderdogs. The Silicon Valley-based video streamer Netflix illustrated this\nwhen it joined MPA in 2019. And the entertainment companies have also tried to\npivot into being tech companies. Somehow, they are adopting each other\u2019s worst\naspects.\n\nBut it\u2019s important not to let those changes hide the fact that those hurt by\nthis proposal are not Big Tech but regular internet users. Internet platforms\nbig and small are still where ordinary users and creators find their voice,\nconnect with audiences, and participate in politics and culture, mostly in\nlegal\u2014and legally protected\u2014ways. Filmmakers who can\u2019t get a distribution deal\nfrom a giant movie house still reach audiences on YouTube. Culture critics\nstill reach audiences through zines and newsletters. The typical users of\nthese platforms don\u2019t have the giant megaphones of major studios, record\nlabels, or publishers. Site-blocking legislation, whether called SOPA/PIPA,\n\u201cno fault injunctions,\u201d or by any other name, still threatens the free\nexpression of all of these citizens and creators.\n\nNo matter what the MPA wants to claim, this does not help artists. Artists\nwant their work seen, not locked away for a tax write-off. They wanted a fair\ndeal, not nearly five months of strikes. They want studios to make more small\nand midsize films and to take a chance on new voices. They have been\nincredibly clear about what they want, and this is not it.\n\nEven if Rivkin\u2019s claim of an \u201cunflinching commitment to the First Amendment\u201d\nwas credible from a group that seems to think it has a monopoly on free\nexpression\u2014and which just tried to consign the future of its own artists to\nthe gig economy\u2014a site-blocking law would not be used only by Hollywood\nstudios. Anyone with a copyright and the means to hire a lawyer could wield\nthe hammer of site-blocking. And here\u2019s the thing: we already know that\ncopyright claims are used as tools of censorship.\n\nThe notice-and-takedown system created by the Digital Millennium Copyright\nAct, for example, is abused time and again by people who claim to be enforcing\ntheir copyrights, and also by folks who simply want to make speech they don\u2019t\nlike disappear from the Internet. Even without a site-blocking law, major\nrecord labels and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement shut down a popular\nhip hop music blog and kept it off the internet for over a year without ever\nshowing that it infringed copyright. And unscrupulous characters use\naccusations of infringement to extort money from website owners, or even force\nthem into carrying spam links.\n\nThis censorious abuse, whether intentional or accidental, is far more damaging\nwhen it targets the internet\u2019s infrastructure. Blocking entire websites or\ngroups of websites is imprecise, inevitably bringing down lawful speech along\nwith whatever was targeted. For example, suits by Microsoft intended to shut\ndown malicious botnets caused thousands of legitimate users to lose access to\nthe domain names they depended on. There is, in short, no effective safeguard\non a new censorship power that would be the internet\u2019s version of police\nseizing printing presses.\n\nEven if this didn\u2019t endanger free expression on its own, once new tools exist,\nthey can be used for more than copyright. Just as malfunctioning copyright\nfilters were adapted into the malfunctioning filters used for \u201cadult content\u201d\non tumblr, so can means of site blocking. The major companies of a single\nindustry should not get to dictate the future of free speech online.\n\nWhy the MPA is announcing this now is anyone\u2019s guess. They might think no one\ncares anymore. They\u2019re wrong. Internet users rejected site blocking in 2012\nand they reject it today.\n\n## Related Issues\n\nCreativity & Innovation\n\nSOPA/PIPA: Internet Blacklist Legislation\n\nShare It Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Copy link\n\n## Join EFF Lists\n\n## Related Updates\n\nDeeplinks Blog by Mitch Stoltz, Cara Gagliano | March 14, 2024\n\n### Making the Law Accessible in Europe and the USA\n\nSpecial thanks to EFF legal intern Alissa Johnson, who was the lead author of\nthis post.
