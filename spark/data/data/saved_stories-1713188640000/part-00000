It is the one knuckle rule. Pun\nintended. The water in the rice should be one knuckle above the surface of the\nrice.\n\nGet your rice, wash it, drain it. Add water to it till the surface. Then put\nyour favorite index finger on the top of the surface and add more water till\nthe water is one knuckle deep.\n\nCover it, add it to your heat source of choice and in 20 mins you have good\nrice. Many youtube celebs like Uncle Roger and Andy Cooks also recommend this\nmethod.\n\nBut, what if you change the rice?\n\nWell, then the rule changes. It turns of that the one-knuckle thumb rule is\nonly valid for ordinary white rice (and even Sushi rice). If you are cooking\nsome other kind of rice, the rice does not turn out to be great. As a\nreligious rice consumer, I was tired of my rice coming out bad for several\nyears until last week...\n\nI decided to sit down and decipher what these knuckle ratios can be for other\ntype of rice that I regularly eat. So, here are my recommendations and\nproposed amendments.\n\n  * Basmati Rice (Indian/Thai) : The knuckle rule more or less cuts it. But add a quarter knuckle more water does wonders to the fluffiness of the rice. Then only cumin, bay leaf, and ghee awaits.\n\n  * Parboiled rice/ Arroz Vaporizado : This is one my favourite everyday rice. It has a slightly jelly like feel to it. I use it in Kheer / Arroz con Leche. Also, with less liquidy Daals and places where I need a bit of rice. This rice needs one and a half knuckle of water.\n\n  * Integral Rice : My afternoon rice. It has a bit more fibre and does not make you sleepy due to its low glycemic index. It takes upto two knuckles if you want porridgy texture (good with liquid daals/sambars) or one three-quarters if you want slight grain integrity.\n\n  * Arborio (Risotto)/Albufera (Paella) : Please cook these rice properly in line with their traditional methods. These rice varieties tend to be starchy and I prefer to cook them as they should be to get the creamy texture of the Risotto or the Socarrat of the Paella.\n\n(Please note, this guide assumes that the rice is not pre-soaked)\n\nThere you have the water ratios for good rice. Make it so !\n\nAnother secret tip: Buy a rice cooker.\n\nSaludos, Rohit\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
