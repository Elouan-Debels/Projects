At Munich\u2019s Pinakothek\nder Moderne museum earlier this year, one technician and aspiring artist got\nto bask in the limelight for a whole eight hours.\n\nThe museum in southern Germany on Tuesday confirmed that it had fired a member\nof its technical services team after he was found to have hung one of his own\npaintings in a part of the gallery dedicated to modern and contemporary art,\nallowing him to share a space with works by pop art pioneer Warhol for an\nentire day.\n\nThe 51-year-old man had smuggled his work into the display at Munich\u2019s\nPinakothek der Moderne \u201cin the hope of achieving his artistic breakthrough\u201d,\nthe German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported, citing police sources.\n\n\u201cThe employee considers himself as an artist and most likely saw his role in\nthe museum\u2019s installation team as a day-job to support his true calling,\u201d a\nspokesperson for the Pinakothek told the Guardian.\n\nIn his role at the museum, the man had access to the gallery space outside\nopening hours and so did not raise the attention of security staff when\ninstalling his 60cm by 120cm artwork on an empty white wall in a passageway in\nthe eastern wing\u2019s first-floor gallery.\n\nThe incident on 23 February was not made public until Monday. The Pinakothek\nspokesperson said the painting had been hung in the early hours and spotted by\nstaff soon after the museum opened the same day.\n\n\u201cThe decision was made to keep the picture on display while the gallery was\nopen and take it down after its closing time at 6pm,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nThe Pinakothek said it would not comment on the painting\u2019s subject or style as\ndoing so could \u201cencourage copycat pranksters\u201d. \u201cAll I can say is that we did\nnot receive any positive feedback on the addition from visitors to the\ngallery,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe gallery said it had terminated the contract of a member of its technical\nservice team and banned him from entering its premises.\n\nPolice are investigating the aspiring modern master over a relatively minor\ninfringement: in order to hang his painting he allegedly drilled two holes\ninto the gallery wall, prompting the museum to file a criminal complaint for\nwilful damage to property.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to\neconomics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
