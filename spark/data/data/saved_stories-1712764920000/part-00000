This job is incredibly difficult.\nEverything we create always takes longer and is more complex than it would be\nif we did it without focusing on privacy, and we generally have to do it with\nfewer resources. This also makes it a path that we walk alone as few other\nteams share our commitment to privacy and community and, therefore, understand\nthe unique challenges we face day after day.\n\nBut we also know that making privacy the default online will take more than\njust us, which is why we\u2019re always very excited to meet like-minded teams that\nare purpose and community-driven. In 2022, we met the team from\nSimpleLogin(new window) and joined forces(new window), and today, we\u2019re happy\nto announce that Standard Notes will also join us to advance our shared\nmission.\n\nStandard Notes(new window), as the name suggests, is an end-to-end encrypted\nnote-taking application, available on mobile and desktop, that is used by over\n300,000 people. Our personal notes often contain some of our most intimate and\nsensitive data, and protecting them with end-to-end encryption ensures that\nthey always remain accessible only to you. This really makes Standard Notes\ncomplementary to the Proton ecosystem of services, and it is one that we have\nlong used ourselves and are excited to introduce to the Proton community.\n\n## What does this mean for Proton and Standard Notes users?\n\nBoth Proton and Standard Notes share a strong commitment to our communities,\nso Standard Notes will remain open source, freely available, and fully\nsupported. Prices are not changing, and if you have a current subscription to\nStandard Notes, it will continue to be honored. Proton aspires to do the right\nthing and be a responsible home for open-source projects, and just as we did\nwith SimpleLogin, we are committed to preserving what makes Standard Notes\nspecial and much loved.\n\nIn the coming months, we hope to find ways to make Standard Notes more easily\naccessible to the Proton community. This way, in addition to protecting your\nemail, calendar, files, passwords, and online activity, you can also protect\nyour notes.\n\n## Why Standard Notes\n\nProton has long been guided by our unique values. We\u2019ve always believed in\nputting people ahead of profits, from our start as a crowdfunded project\ncreated by scientists who met at CERN right up to the present day as we\nsafeguard the privacy of over 100 million people. It\u2019s not hard enough to run\na long-lasting and durable privacy company \u2014 even fewer have managed to do it\nwithout venture capital or other outside investors.\n\nStandard Notes has been around since 2017 and has withstood the test of time.\nStandard Notes has also grown without venture capital funding and has\ndemonstrated a commitment towards serving its community. This alignment in\nvalues is rare, and creates a natural fit to work together. We are proud to\nhave the entire Standard Notes team join us on our journey, and we look\nforward to learning from them and growing stronger together. But most of all,\nwe look forward to continuing to serve both the Proton and Standard Notes\ncommunities together in the years to come.\n\nProtect your privacy with Proton\n\nCreate a free account\n\nShare this page\n\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n  * (new window)\n\nAndy Yen(new window)\n\nAndy is the founder and CEO of Proton.
