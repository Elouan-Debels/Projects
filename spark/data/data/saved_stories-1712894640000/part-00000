Every Thursday, I drop some knowledge\nbombs on your face to help you reach your goals faster while avoiding all the\nbullshit.\n\nMost people tend to view exercise through the lens of the \u2018additive\u2019 energy\nmodel: More exercise = more calories burned.\n\nBut back in 2016, Herman Pontzer and colleagues published a study that put\nforth the \u2018constrained\u2019 energy model: Energy expenditure does increase with\nadded activity, but only to a point. 1 Pontzer et al. 2016\n\nIn other words, if you go from being sedentary to active, you\u2019ll see an\nincrease in energy expenditure. But if you\u2019re already very active and increase\nphysical activity levels further, you aren\u2019t likely to see energy expenditure\nincrease linearly because the body adjusts other processes to maintain total\nenergy expenditure within a narrow range.\n\nAdditive model (left): the more activity you do, the more calories you burn.\nThe constrained model (right): As levels of physical activity increase, the\nbody adjusts other aspects of energy expenditure to maintain TDEE within a\ncertain range\n\nFor example, a recent paper found weight loss was only half of what was\nexpected in a group burning 2000-2500 kcals/wk. The researchers explained this\nwas likely due to behavioural adaptations that reduced 24-hour energy\nexpenditure. 2 Broskey et al. 2021\n\nAt the time, this was an interesting finding that seemed to offer a tentative\nexplanation for why people don\u2019t always lose the expected amount of weight\ndespite doing a bunch of physical activity.\n\nThen, this area of research went pretty quiet, and there were questions about\nthe validity of the constrained energy model. After all, it was just one\nstudy\u2013\u2013did we jump the gun?\n\nWell, two recent studies have added to the constrained energy model.\n\nIn the first, Careau and colleagues looked at total energy expenditure in\n1,754 adults living normal lives and found energy compensation averaged 28%.\n\nIn other words, if someone increased their physical activity levels by 500\nkcals, you\u2019d assume this would mean their total energy expenditure also\nincreased by 500 kcals. However, according to this study, the actual increase\nin energy expenditure would only be 360 kcals. 3 Careau et al. 2021\n\nBut the researchers also found something else: Leaner individuals compensated\nless (29.7% compensation) than individuals with more body fat (45.7%\ncompensation).\n\nAs the researchers explain:\n\n> It appears then, that either individuals with greater fat levels are\n> predisposed to increased adiposity because they are stronger energy\n> compensators or because they become stronger compensators as they get\n> fatter. If the former, then two people can be equally active yet one puts on\n> fat mass while the other stays lean. If the latter, then such a positive\n> feedback loop may imply that using exercise as a strategy to escape high\n> adiposity becomes less and less effective.\n\nIn the second study published earlier this year, researchers found energy\nbalance influenced total energy expenditure such that when participants were\nat maintenance or a surplus, the additive model held true (to a point),\nwhereas when participants were in a deficit, the constrained model held true.\n4 Willis et al. 2022\n\n### Now, there\u2019s a lot to unpack here. But a few key points we can take away\nfrom all of this.\n\n1- Trying to \u2018out-train\u2019 your diet is a losing strategy\n\nNot just because the amount of exercise required to achieve this is impossible\nfor most people, especially when you\u2019re not paying attention to how much you\neat, but because the number of calories you think you burned during exercise\nisn\u2019t how many calories you really burned due to the compensation that takes\nplace. This compensation seems to increase as fat mass increases.\n\nThe goal of training during a fat loss phase is to maintain muscle and\nstrength. If you enjoy cardio, do it for the health benefits, not to burn more\ncalories. Of course, cardio can be implemented to increase the deficit, but be\nmindful of how much you\u2019re doing so you don\u2019t inadvertently end up in too big\na deficit, which then increases fatigue, and results in less movement the rest\nof the day.\n\n2- Your energy balance status likely impacts the degree of compensation\n\nIf you\u2019re at maintenance or a surplus, you could probably get away with a bit\nmore physical activity without experiencing the same degree of compensation\nyou would during a deficit.\n\nThis also adds to the point above: If you do more exercise in the hopes you\u2019ll\n\u2018speed\u2019 up fat loss, the more likely the compensation is to kick in. Hence why\nthe goal of a fat loss diet is to coax (not force) fat loss.\n\n3- Stop paying attention to your smartwatch.\n\nWhile this point isn\u2019t directly related to the topic, I think it\u2019s still worth\nmentioning. Or, well, mentioning again because I still get questions from\npeople on whether or not they should \u2018eat back\u2019 their exercise calories.\n\nLet\u2019s forget that smartwatches are terrible at accurately estimating energy\nexpenditure (see this and this). And even if they were accurate, they wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to account for the compensation that occurs.\n\nThat said, smartwatches seem pretty accurate for tracking step counts, and you\ncan use this to your advantage. If you know how many steps you\u2019re doing at the\nstart of a diet, you can try to maintain the number of steps throughout the\ndiet to help keep energy expenditure up.\n\n### Finally, before wrapping up, I want to emphasise that physical activity is\nimportant.\n\nI\u2019ve seen many people misinterpret the original Pontzer study to imply that\nphysical activity is pointless.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t what the constrained energy model suggests. As I mentioned\nabove, the constrained energy model states that physical activity does\nincrease energy expenditure, but only up to a point. It\u2019s when physical\nactivity becomes excessive that the increase in energy expenditure plateaus.\n\nPutting aside all of the obvious benefits of exercise, one of the biggest\nbenefits of regular exercise is its role in weight maintenance. In fact,\naccording to the latest systematic review on the subject, it\u2019s the \u201cmost\nconsistent positive correlate of weight loss maintenance.\u201d 5 Paix\u00e3o et al.\n2020\n\nSo exercise is definitely important. And contrary to what a lot of people say,\nexercise will increase your energy expenditure, just not as much as you\u2019d want\nit to, and the extent to which it does will decrease, and eventually plateau,\nas you reach higher levels of activity.\n\nIt\u2019s time we shift the focus away from using exercise as a way to burn\ncalories and put more emphasis on using physical activity as a way to improve\nour health and support our fitness goals. Any increase in energy expenditure\nshould be seen as a nice add-on, not the sole reason for exercising.\n\n## Thanks for reading.
