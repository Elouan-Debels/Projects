But the big turtle is \u201cin\nrobust condition\u201d despite her advanced age, said Mike O\u2019Neill, manager of the\nocean tank.\n\nThere\u2019s every reason to believe Myrtle will stick around for years to come,\nO\u2019Neill said.\n\n\u201cShe is iconic,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cOne of the really special things we see is\nparents with their kids who say, \u2018This is Myrtle, she has been here since when\nI was a kid.\u2019 She has this multigenerational impact, which is really special.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSalmon fishing is banned off the California coast for the second year in a row\namid low stocks\n\nRescuers search off Northern California coast for young gray whale entangled\nin gill net\n\nSerbia\u2019s only horse sanctuary has cared for dozens of tortured, old and\nneglected animals\n\nGiving the massive sea turtle a physical exam is no small feat, and it happens\nabout twice per year. First, a team of divers shepherded Myrtle into the\nunderwater crate, which was lifted from the water by a winch. The process took\nplace during open hours at the aquarium, and dozens of onlookers watched as\nMyrtle was brought to a deck for the exam.\n\nNext, a team of veterinarians, vet techs and aquarists worked together to draw\nblood from Myrtle, check her flippers for range of motion and make sure her\neyes, mouth and nose were in working order. Aquarium staff assured curious\nchildren that the turtle was in no danger \u2014 and that the veterinarians were\ntrained professionals safe from her powerful jaws.\n\nMyrtle then received an ultrasound, her weight was taken, and she returned to\nthe ocean tank, O\u2019Neill said. The turtle was back in the ocean tank munching\non lettuce and cabbage by late morning on Tuesday.\n\nMyrtle has been visited by about 50 million people over the decades and has\ngotten used to humans in that time. The aquarium\u2019s website boasts that Myrtle,\nwho arrived from another aquarium in 1970, \u201cloves having her shell scratched.\u201d\n\nGreen sea turtles are the second-largest species of sea turtle, and they live\nin tropical and subtropical oceans around the world. The International Union\nfor Conservation of Nature lists them as endangered and decreasing in\npopulation.\n\nMyrtle shares space with a pair of loggerhead sea turtles named Carolina and\nRetread who are about half her age and size. The aquatic roommates also\nreceived physicals on Tuesday and are \u201calso both doing great,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\nPATRICK WHITTLE\n\nWhittle is an Associated Press reporter based in Portland, Maine.
