When living muscle tissue is attached to posts at\nthe corners of the device, the muscle\u2019s contractions pull on the spring,\nforming an effective, natural actuator. The spring can serve as a \u201cskeleton\u201d\nfor future muscle-powered robots.\n\nCredits:\n\nImage: Felice Frankel\n\nOur muscles are nature\u2019s perfect actuators \u2014 devices that turn energy into\nmotion. For their size, muscle fibers are more powerful and precise than most\nsynthetic actuators. They can even heal from damage and grow stronger with\nexercise.\n\nFor these reasons, engineers are exploring ways to power robots with natural\nmuscles. They\u2019ve demonstrated a handful of \u201cbiohybrid\u201d robots that use muscle-\nbased actuators to power artificial skeletons that walk, swim, pump, and grip.\nBut for every bot, there\u2019s a very different build, and no general blueprint\nfor how to get the most out of muscles for any given robot design.\n\nNow, MIT engineers have developed a spring-like device that could be used as a\nbasic skeleton-like module for almost any muscle-bound bot. The new spring, or\n\u201cflexure,\u201d is designed to get the most work out of any attached muscle\ntissues. Like a leg press that\u2019s fit with just the right amount of weight, the\ndevice maximizes the amount of movement that a muscle can naturally produce.\n\nThe researchers found that when they fit a ring of muscle tissue onto the\ndevice, much like a rubber band stretched around two posts, the muscle pulled\non the spring, reliably and repeatedly, and stretched it five times more,\ncompared with other previous device designs.\n\nThe team sees the flexure design as a new building block that can be combined\nwith other flexures to build any configuration of artificial skeletons.\nEngineers can then fit the skeletons with muscle tissues to power their\nmovements.\n\n\u201cThese flexures are like a skeleton that people can now use to turn muscle\nactuation into multiple degrees of freedom of motion in a very predictable\nway,\u201d says Ritu Raman, the Brit and Alex d'Arbeloff Career Development\nProfessor in Engineering Design at MIT. \u201cWe are giving roboticists a new set\nof rules to make powerful and precise muscle-powered robots that do\ninteresting things.\u201d\n\nRaman and her colleagues report the details of the new flexure design in a\npaper appearing today in the journal Advanced Intelligent Systems. The study\u2019s\nMIT co-authors include Naomi Lynch \u201912, SM \u201923; undergraduate Tara Sheehan;\ngraduate students Nicolas Castro, Laura Rosado, and Brandon Rios; and\nprofessor of mechanical engineering Martin Culpepper.\n\nMuscle pull\n\nWhen left alone in a petri dish in favorable conditions, muscle tissue will\ncontract on its own but in directions that are not entirely predictable or of\nmuch use.\n\n\u201cIf muscle is not attached to anything, it will move a lot, but with huge\nvariability, where it\u2019s just flailing around in liquid,\u201d Raman says.\n\nTo get a muscle to work like a mechanical actuator, engineers typically attach\na band of muscle tissue between two small, flexible posts. As the muscle band\nnaturally contracts, it can bend the posts and pull them together, producing\nsome movement that would ideally power part of a robotic skeleton. But in\nthese designs, muscles have produced limited movement, mainly because the\ntissues are so variable in how they contact the posts. Depending on where the\nmuscles are placed on the posts, and how much of the muscle surface is\ntouching the post, the muscles may succeed in pulling the posts together but\nat other times may wobble around in uncontrollable ways.\n\nRaman\u2019s group looked to design a skeleton that focuses and maximizes a\nmuscle\u2019s contractions regardless of exactly where and how it is placed on a\nskeleton, to generate the most movement in a predictable, reliable way.\n\n\u201cThe question is: How do we design a skeleton that most efficiently uses the\nforce the muscle is generating?\u201d Raman says.\n\nThe researchers first considered the multiple directions that a muscle can\nnaturally move. They reasoned that if a muscle is to pull two posts together\nalong a specific direction, the posts should be connected to a spring that\nonly allows them to move in that direction when pulled.\n\n\u201cWe need a device that is very soft and flexible in one direction, and very\nstiff in all other directions, so that when a muscle contracts, all that force\ngets efficiently converted into motion in one direction,\u201d Raman says.\n\nSoft flex\n\nAs it turns out, Raman found many such devices in Professor Martin Culpepper\u2019s\nlab. Culpepper\u2019s group at MIT specializes in the design and fabrication of\nmachine elements such as miniature actuators, bearings, and other mechanisms,\nthat can be built into machines and systems to enable ultraprecise movement,\nmeasurement, and control, for a wide variety of applications. Among the\ngroup\u2019s precision machined elements are flexures \u2014 spring-like devices, often\nmade from parallel beams, that can flex and stretch with nanometer precision.\n\n\u201cDepending on how thin and far apart the beams are, you can change how stiff\nthe spring appears to be,\u201d Raman says.\n\nShe and Culpepper teamed up to design a flexure specifically tailored with a\nconfiguration and stiffness to enable muscle tissue to naturally contract and\nmaximally stretch the spring. The team designed the device\u2019s configuration and\ndimensions based on numerous calculations they carried out to relate a\nmuscle\u2019s natural forces with a flexure\u2019s stiffness and degree of movement.\n\nThe flexure they ultimately designed is 1/100 the stiffness of muscle tissue\nitself. The device resembles a miniature, accordion-like structure, the\ncorners of which are pinned to an underlying base by a small post, which sits\nnear a neighboring post that is fit directly onto the base. Raman then wrapped\na band of muscle around the two corner posts (the team molded the bands from\nlive muscle fibers that they grew from mouse cells), and measured how close\nthe posts were pulled together as the muscle band contracted.\n\nThe team found that the flexure\u2019s configuration enabled the muscle band to\ncontract mostly along the direction between the two posts. This focused\ncontraction allowed the muscle to pull the posts much closer together \u2014 five\ntimes closer \u2014 compared with previous muscle actuator designs.\n\n\u201cThe flexure is a skeleton that we designed to be very soft and flexible in\none direction, and very stiff in all other directions,\u201d Raman says. \u201cWhen the\nmuscle contracts, all the force is converted into movement in that direction.\nIt\u2019s a huge magnification.\u201d\n\nThe team found they could use the device to precisely measure muscle\nperformance and endurance. When they varied the frequency of muscle\ncontractions (for instance, stimulating the bands to contract once versus four\ntimes per second), they observed that the muscles \u201cgrew tired\u201d at higher\nfrequencies, and didn\u2019t generate as much pull.\n\n\u201cLooking at how quickly our muscles get tired, and how we can exercise them to\nhave high-endurance responses \u2014 this is what we can uncover with this\nplatform,\u201d Raman says.\n\nThe researchers are now adapting and combining flexures to build precise,\narticulated, and reliable robots, powered by natural muscles.\n\n\u201cAn example of a robot we are trying to build in the future is a surgical\nrobot that can perform minimally invasive procedures inside the body,\u201d Raman\nsays. \u201cTechnically, muscles can power robots of any size, but we are\nparticularly excited in making small robots, as this is where biological\nactuators excel in terms of strength, efficiency, and adaptability.\u201d\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Paper\n\nPaper: \u201cEnhancing and Decoding the Performance of Muscle Actuators with\nFlexures\u201d\n\n## Press Mentions\n\n### TechCrunch\n\nMIT researchers have developed a new type of spring-like device that uses a\nflexible element to help power biohybrid robots, reports Brian Heater for\nTechCrunch. \u201cThe muscle fiber/flexure system can be applied to various kinds\nof robots in different sizes,\u201d Heater writes, adding that the researchers are,\n\u201cfocused on creating extremely small robots that could one day operate inside\nthe body to perform minimally invasive procedures.\u201d\n\nFull story via TechCrunch \u2192\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * Ritu Raman\n  * Department of Mechanical Engineering\n  * School of Engineering\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Research\n  * Robots\n  * Bioengineering and biotechnology\n  * Biological engineering\n  * Biomechanics\n  * Biotechnology\n  * Mechanical engineering\n  * Medical devices\n  * Robotics\n  * School of Engineering\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Light-activated muscle grafts show promise in aiding muscle recovery post-\ntrauma\n\n### Wobbly gel mat trains muscle cells to work together\n\n### At the forefront of building with biology\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### New AI method captures uncertainty in medical images\n\nBy providing plausible label maps for one medical image, the Tyche machine-\nlearning model could help clinicians and researchers capture crucial\ninformation.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Improving drug development with a vast map of the immune system\n\nImmunai\u2019s founders were researchers at MIT when they launched their company to\nhelp predict how patients will respond to new treatments.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### MIT-Mexico Program fosters cross-border collaboration\n\nFor two decades, MIT-Mexico has funded student internships and teaching, as\nwell as faculty research collaborations.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### With inspiration from \u201cTetris,\u201d MIT researchers develop a better radiation\ndetector\n\nThe device, based on simple tetromino shapes, could determine the direction\nand distance of a radiation source, with fewer detector pixels.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### QS World University Rankings rates MIT No. 1 in 11 subjects for 2024\n\nThe Institute also ranks second in five subject areas.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Tackling cancer at the nanoscale\n\nIn MIT\u2019s 2024 Killian Lecture, chemical engineer Paula Hammond described her\ngroundbreaking work on nanoparticles designed to attack tumor cells.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
