System-assigned passwords address\nthis problem, but they can be difficult for users to memorize. While password\nmanagers can help store system-assigned passwords, there will always be\npasswords that a user needs to memorize, such as their password manager\u2019s\nmaster password. As such, there is a critical need for research into helping\nusers memorize system-assigned passwords. In this work, we compare three\ndifferent designs for password memorization aids inspired by the method of\nloci or memory palace. Design One displays a two-dimensional scene with\nobjects placed inside it in arbitrary (and randomized) positions, with Design\nTwo fixing the objects\u2019 position within the scene, and Design Three displays\nthe scene using a navigable, three-dimensional representation. In an A-B study\nof these designs, we find that, surprisingly, there is no statistically\nsignificant difference between the memorability of these three designs, nor\nthat of assigning users a passphrase to memorize, which we used as the control\nin this study. However, we find that when perfect recall failed, our designs\nhelped users remember a greater portion of the encoded system-assigned\npassword than did a passphrase, a property we refer to as durability. Our\nresults indicate that there could be room for memorization aids that\nincorporate fuzzy or error-correcting authentication. Similarly, our results\nsuggest that simple (i.e., cheap to develop) designs of this nature may be\njust as effective as more complicated, high-fidelity (i.e., expensive to\ndevelop) designs.\n\nPaper\n\n## View More Papers\n\n### Faults in Our Bus: Novel Bus Fault Attack to...\n\nNimish Mishra (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur),\nAnirban Chakraborty (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT\nKharagpur), Debdeep Mukhopadhyay (Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering, IIT Kharagpur)\n\nRead More\n\n### More Lightweight, yet Stronger: Revisiting OSCORE\u2019s Replay Protection\n\nKonrad-Felix Krentz (Uppsala University), Thiemo Voigt (Uppsala University,\nRISE Computer Science)\n\nRead More\n\n### SOK: An Evaluation of Quantum Authentication Through Systematic\nLiterature...\n\nRitajit Majumdar (Indian Statistical Institute), Sanchari Das (University of\nDenver)\n\nRead More\n\n### DRAINCLoG: Detecting Rogue Accounts with Illegally-obtained NFTs using\nClassifiers...\n\nHanna Kim (KAIST), Jian Cui (Indiana University Bloomington), Eugene Jang (S2W\nInc.), Chanhee Lee (S2W Inc.), Yongjae Lee (S2W Inc.), Jin-Woo Chung (S2W\nInc.), Seungwon Shin (KAIST)\n\nRead More\n\n### About\n\n  * About\n  * Test of Time Award\n  * Why NDSS Symposium\n  * Sponsorship\n  * News\n\n### NDSS Symposium 2023\n\n  * 2024 Symposium\n  * Program\n  * Accepted Papers\n  * Co-located Events\n  * Leadership\n\n### NDSS Symposium 2022\n\n  * 2023 Symposium\n  * Program\n  * Accepted Papers\n  * Co-located Events\n  * Leadership\n\n### Previous Events\n\n  * Previous Events\n  * Previous NDSS Symposia\n  * Previous USEC Events\n  * Previous VehicleSec Events\n\nPrivacy Policy | Terms of Use | NDSS Code of Conduct | Contact Us\n\nInternet Society \u00a9 1992-2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
