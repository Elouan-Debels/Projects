Essentially, this bias leads people to engage in\nflawed self-forecasting, by projecting their current attributes onto their\nfuture self, and thus underestimating how much their attributes will likely\nchange over time.\n\nThe projection bias can strongly influence people\u2019s thoughts, statements, and\nactions in various domains, so it\u2019s important to understand it. As such, in\nthe following article you will learn more about the projection bias, and see\nhow you can deal with it in practice.\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\n## Examples of the projection bias\n\nAn example of the projection bias is that a person who is grocery shopping\nwhile hungry will likely buy more food than they really need, because they\nassume that they will keep being as hungry in the future, even after they\u2019ve\neaten.\n\nAnother example of the projection bias, this time in the context of time\nmanagement, is that when people are tired and working feels hard, they can\nbecome unnecessarily pessimistic about their future ability to get work done.\nAlternatively, when people are well-rested and working feels easy, they can\nbecome unrealistically optimistic about their future ability to get work done.\n\nIn addition, the following are other examples of ways in which the projection\nbias can influence people:\n\n  * It can cause people who are making summer vacation plans during the winter to pick overly warm destinations, because they overestimate how much they will want to be somewhere warm during the summer, due to the current winter conditions.\n  * It can cause diners to order too much food at the beginning of their meal, because they overestimate how hungry they will be as the meal progresses, due to their current hunger.\n  * It can cause people to start engaging in an addictive habit, such as smoking cigarettes, because they underestimate how addictive it will be, due to their current lack of addiction.\n  * It can influence people\u2019s decision regarding whether to try to quit an addictive behavior, by either discouraging them from trying to quit at moments when their cravings are strong (so they overestimate their future cravings), or by encouraging them to try to quit at moments when their cravings are weak (so they underestimate their future cravings).\n\nFurthermore, the projection bias can influence people in various other ways,\nsuch as by causing them to mispredict their future gym attendance, or by\ncausing the current weather to influence their decision of which clothes, car,\nor house to buy. It can also influence their decision-making in various other\nimportant domains, such as when it comes to medical choices (e.g., what\ntreatment to get) and financial choices (e.g., which investments to pick).\n\nFinally, some entities may also take advantage of people\u2019s projection bias\nintentionally, as in the case of companies that do so to influence people\u2019s\nshopping patterns. For example:\n\n  * The projection bias can cause people to assume that they will keep experiencing the same level of satisfaction from consuming something or engaging in a certain activity, even if their satisfaction will actually decrease over time. Accordingly, companies may encourage overconsumption by encouraging people to purchase large quantities of a certain product in advance (e.g., food at an all-you-can-eat buffet), before those people realize that they don\u2019t need so much of the product or don\u2019t value the product as much as they initially thought.\n  * The projection bias can cause people to underestimate how attached they will grow to an object after they purchase it (an attachment that can occur due to the endowment effect, which causes people to value things more if they possess them). Accordingly, companies may offer generous return policies and money-back guarantees, when they know that people will have a false sense of how reversible those purchases will feel to them after they make the purchase.\n\n## The psychology and causes of the projection bias\n\nThe projection bias means that even though people generally understand the\n(qualitative) direction in which their attributes (e.g., tastes and beliefs)\nwill change over time, they systematically underestimate the (quantitative)\nmagnitude of this change, so their prediction lies between their current\nattributes and their actual future attributes. This happens because people\ngive too much weight to the anchor of their current attributes, and fail to\nproperly take into account factors that could cause their attributes to\nchange, such as maturation, social influence, change in circumstances,\nadaptation to changes, and general mood fluctuations.\n\n### Factors that influence attributes\n\nFactors that change people\u2019s attributes over time can be categorized based on\nwhether they are:\n\n  * Personal (or dispositional), as in the case of maturation or general mood fluctuation.\n  * Environmental (or situational), as in the case of influence from peers or influence from a certain physical location.\n\nThese factors can also be categorized based on whether they are short-term or\nlong-term, based on the period of time over which they influence a person. For\nexample, social influence from a salesperson is likely to be short-term,\nwhereas social influence from a parent is likely to be long-term.\n\nA notable type of factor that often strongly influences people\u2019s attributes\nare visceral factors, such as hunger, desire, and anger, which cause people to\nenter what is known as a hot (emotional) state.\n\n### Failure to learn from mispredictions\n\nPeople often fail to learn from past mispredictions of their future\nattributions, and therefore continue to repeatedly display the same type of\nprojection bias over time. This can happen due to various reasons, such as:\n\n  * A person\u2019s desire to feel that they understand themself well, which can lead them to engage in self-enhancement, by forgetting or misremembering their past mispredictions.\n  * A person\u2019s focus on confirming their current predictions, rather than on assessing them properly, which can lead them to ignore evidence that contradicts those predictions (e.g., past mispredictions).\n  * The prediction errors that a person makes can be different from each other, for example because they occur in different domains (e.g., when it comes to buying clothes and when it comes to eating), which can make it difficult to identify the connections between these errors, and consequently to notice, understand, and correct the issue with one\u2019s predictions.\n\n## How to deal with the projection bias\n\nThere are several things that you can do to reduce the projection bias:\n\n  * Understand what this bias is and what causes it.\n  * Understand when and how this bias can affect people in general.\n  * Be aware of common projection traps, such as underestimating the influence of visceral factors, overestimating the likelihood of following up on future plans, and oversensitivity to your current state when making long-term decisions.\n  * Identify specific situations where this bias can play a key role, and plan how you will deal with it. For example, if you know that the projection bias will cause you to buy too much food if you shop while hungry, then you can eat before going grocery shopping.\n  * Identify past situations where the projection bias influenced your thinking, and use that to inform your planning. For example, if you\u2019re thinking about buying a product, you can ask yourself how you felt about a similar product that you purchased in the past.\n  * Ask guiding questions, such as \u201chow likely is it that I\u2019ll feel the same way about this in a month?\u201d, or \u201cam I sure that I\u2019ll feel the same way once I\u2019ve had a chance to cool off?\u201d.\n  * Get feedback from someone you trust. For example, you can ask someone who knows you whether they think that the purchase you\u2019re planning to make is something that you\u2019ll end up regretting.\n  * Use self-distancing techniques, such as considering what advice you would give to a friend if they were in your situation.\n  * Take enough time to think things over, and especially to cool off before making important decisions. For example, if you\u2019re currently experiencing strong emotions, for example because you just received a high-pressure sales pitch, you can choose to postpone making a decision until you\u2019re away from the salesperson and had a chance to sleep.\n  * Set up decision-making rules in advance, such as counting to 10 or getting some sleep before making major decisions, or not making any major purchases on your first visit to a store.\n  * Use general debiasing techniques, such as slowing down your reasoning process and making it explicit.\n\nWith some modifications, you can also use these techniques to reduce the\nprojection bias in others. For example, if you want to reduce the projection\nbias in someone, you can explain to them what this bias is, ask them guiding\nquestions that prompt them to realize that their tastes will likely change\nover time, and encourage them to take some time to cool off before making a\ndecision.\n\nIn addition, note that even if you don\u2019t intend or aren\u2019t able to reduce the\nprojection bias, it can be useful to account for it when it comes to\nunderstanding and predicting people\u2019s behavior, including your own. For\nexample, accounting for the projection bias can help you understand why\nsomeone chose to make a certain bad purchase, or it can help you predict that\nthey will do so in the future.\n\n## Additional information\n\n### Other types of projection biases\n\nThe term \u201cprojection bias\u201d is primarily used to describe people\u2019s tendency to\noverestimate the degree to which their future attributes will resemble their\ncurrent ones. However, this term can also be used to describe other biases\nthat involve similar forms of projection. Most notably:\n\n  * It\u2019s sometimes used to refer to people\u2019s tendency to project their beliefs, values, characteristics, and behaviors unto others, and to consequently overestimate the degree to which these things are shared with others, a phenomenon that\u2019s sometimes referred to as social projection or the false-consensus effect. The type of projection bias that is outlined in this article can be considered a specific case of this, where people project current attributes onto their future self.\n  * It\u2019s sometimes used to refer to people\u2019s current state influencing their judgment and memory of past experiences.\n  * It\u2019s sometimes used to refer to people\u2019s tendency to project current events into the future, for example by extrapolating recent trends in the stock market to the future.\n\n### Origin and history of the projection bias\n\nThe projection bias is attributed to a 2003 paper titled \u201cProjection bias in\npredicting future utility\u201d, by researchers George Loewenstein, Ted O\u2019Donoghue,\nand Matthew Rabin (published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume\n118, Issue 4, pages 1209\u20131248). The associated study was also published as a\nworking paper in 2000, and mentioned in other publications around that time\nperiod. Furthermore, as the authors of this paper note, evidence of this\nphenomenon has also been presented in other papers published around that time\nand earlier.\n\n### Associated concepts\n\nThe type of perspective anchoring that\u2019s associated with the projection bias\nis also associated with a number of other biases. These include, most notably:\n\n  * The egocentric bias, which is a cognitive bias that causes people to rely too heavily on their own point of view when they examine events in their life or when they try to see things from other people\u2019s perspective.\n  * The empathy gap, which is a cognitive bias that causes people to struggle to understand mental states that are different from their present state, or to struggle to consider how such states affect people\u2019s judgment and decision-making.\n\nIn addition, the prediction bias is closely associated with the concept of\naffective forecasting, which represents people\u2019s predictions about their\nemotional reactions to future events, and with hedonic forecasting (or hedonic\nprediction), which represents people\u2019s predictions about the utility that they\nwill derive from certain outcomes (e.g. how happy a certain decision or\nproduct will make them). These phenomena, in turn, are also associated with\nvarious other prediction biases.\n\n## Summary and conclusions\n\n  * The projection bias is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate the degree to which their future attributes (e.g., tastes and beliefs) will resemble their current ones.\n  * For example, the projection bias can cause people to be unnecessarily pessimistic about their future ability to get work done if they\u2019re tired now so working feels hard, or it can cause people to be unrealistically optimistic if they\u2019re currently well-rested and working feels easy.\n  * This bias means that although people generally understand the (qualitative) direction in which their attributes will change, they systematically underestimate the (quantitative) magnitude of this change, because they give too much weight to the anchor of their current attributes, and fail to properly account for factors that could change them, such as maturation, social influence, and mood fluctuations.\n  * To reduce the projection bias, you can use various debiasing techniques, such as understanding this bias and its consequences, being aware of common projection traps (e.g., underestimating the influence of visceral factors), planning for specific situations where this bias is likely to occur, and taking time to cool off before major decisions.\n  * It can be useful to account for this bias when it comes to understanding and predicting people\u2019s behavior, including your own.\n\n### Other articles you may find interesting:\n\n  * The False-Consensus Effect: People Overestimate How Much Others Are Like Them\n  * The Spotlight Effect: How to Stop Being Self-Conscious\n  * The Empathy Gap: Why People Fail to Understand Different Perspectives\n\nCategories Mental Performance\n\nBy Itamar Shatz, PhD\n\n## Latest Articles\n\n  * Action Bias: Preferring Action Over Inaction\n  * The Platinum Rule: Treat Others the Way They Want to Be Treated\n  * Begging the Question (Petitio Principii): Fallacious Circular Reasoning\n  * The Shirky Principle: Institutions Try to Preserve the Problem to Which They Are the Solution\n  * Snuck Premise: How to Handle Fallacious Presuppositions\n\n## Topics\n\n  * Game Theory\n  * Logical Fallacies\n  * Mental Performance\n  * Optimal Learning\n  * Practical Philosophy\n  * Productivity\n  * Social Psychology\n  * Useful Skills\n\nGet a weekly article on psychology and philosophy you can use.\n\n## Key pages\n\n  * Home\n  * All articles\n  * Selected articles\n\nMore content\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter to learn about many other useful concepts in\npractical psychology and philosophy.\n\nAbout | Contact | Privacy | Terms | \u00a9 2024 Effectiviology\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
