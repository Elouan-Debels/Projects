The letter was\nwritten in November 2023 following the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas,\nprompting Israel\u2019s attack on Gaza.\n\nFellow academics have written a letter to the university in protest against\nthe ban. In it, they call the withdrawal of the invitation \u201canother attempt to\nlimit public and academic debate on Israel and Palestine by invoking\nsupposedly clear, distinct, governmentally sanctioned red lines\u201d.\n\nThey said the letter, titled Philosophy for Palestine, which was signed by\nFraser and several hundred other academics, was separate from Fraser\u2019s work as\na scholar and that her guest professorship had nothing to do with the Israel-\nPalestine conflict.\n\nCologne University said in a statement its decision to cancel the invitation\nhad been made \u201cwith great regret\u201d. It said the reason was that in the letter\nsigned by Fraser, \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to exist as an \u2018ethno-supremacist state\u2019\nsince its foundation in 1948 is called into question. The terror attacks by\nHamas on Israel of 7 October 2023 is [sic] elevated to an act of legitimate\nresistance.\u201d\n\nAward ceremony suspended after writer compares Gaza to Nazi-era Jewish ghettos\n\nRead more\n\nIt said that the signatories\u2019 demand for the academic and cultural boycott of\nIsraeli institutions was at odds with the university\u2019s close ties to Israeli\npartner institutions and the views in the letter were not in line with its own\nstatements from October 2022 on the situation in the Middle East region.\n\nIn an interview with the Frankfurter Rundschau, Fraser called herself a victim\nof \u201cphilosemitic McCarthyism\u201d alongside a number of other academics such as\nMasha Gessen who have been cancelled in Germany over their views regarding the\nMiddle East conflict amid growing criticism that a dominating pro-Israel\npolitical consensus has shut down any proper debate.\n\n\u201cAfter all, I was canceled in the name of German responsibility for the\nHolocaust. This responsibility should also apply to Jewish people. But in\nGermany it is narrowed down to the state policy of the currently ruling\nIsraeli government. Philosemitic McCarthyism sums it up quite well. A way to\nsilence people under the pretext of supposedly supporting Jews,\u201d Fraser said.\n\nIn an interview with Die Zeit addressing the issue of Germany\u2019s responsibility\nas perpetrator of the Holocaust for protecting Jewish life, Fraser said this\nduty was being wrongly applied to exclude criticism of the Israeli government.\n\n\u201cI completely agree that Germans have a special responsibility towards the\nJews in light of the Holocaust. But to equate criticism of the Israeli\ngovernment with antisemitism is simply wrong. And may I add that as a Jew I\nalso feel a special responsibility. But ... that doesn\u2019t mean giving this\ngovernment carte blanche. What is happening in Gaza should not happen \u2013 and\nespecially not in my name. I strongly reject the equation of Israel and\nJudaism. Judaism has a rich secular and, above all, universalist tradition. It\npains me when it is reduced to Israel\u2019s current hyper-ethno-nationalist\npolitics.\u201d\n\nAsked why she thought the philosopher Judith Butler had been allowed to assume\nthe same professorship in 2016, despite having been highly critical of Israel,\nFraser said: \u201cIn Germany, the panic of doing something wrong has increased. In\naddition the war in Gaza is now rekindling the feverishness.\u201d\n\nFraser has said she will continue to hold the lectures she had planned to\ndeliver in Cologne, both at the New School and at another location in Germany.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you\nwhat\u2019s happening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

She\ncommented that Magnus, the 13th-century free-thinking philosopher, scientist\nand bishop after whom the professorship is named, \u201cwould have been appalled\u201d.\n\nIn the 1930s, the New School, she pointed out, had \u201crescued intellectuals\nseeking refuge from the Nazis\u201d \u2013 including the political theorist Hannah\nArendt, the psychologist Erich Fromm and the composer Hanns Eisler.\n\n\u201cWe continued the body of critical thought that had been wiped out \u2013 promoting\nthe remarkable traditions of the German academy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Higher education\n  * Germany\n  * Academics\n  * Universities\n  * Israel-Gaza war\n  * Gaza\n  * Palestinian territories\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Bernardine Evaristo joins calls to save Goldsmiths\u2019 Black British literature MA\n\n6h ago\n\n  * ### How the dung queen of Dublin was swept from history\n\n5h ago\n\n  * ### Creative arts courses at English universities face funding cut\n\n6d ago\n\n  * ### Tory immigration policies risk over-reliance on Chinese students, ex-universities minister warns\n\n31 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Sunak\u2019s student visas clampdown continues boom-and-bust pattern\n\n31 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Sadiq Khan pledges new Erasmus-style overseas study scheme for London youngsters\n\n30 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Britain\u2019s universities are in freefall \u2013 and saving them will take more than funding\n\n29 Mar 2024\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Goldsmiths academics to strike over \u2018incomprehensible\u2019 redundancies\n\n28 Mar 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
