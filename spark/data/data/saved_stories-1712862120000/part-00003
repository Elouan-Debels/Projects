Can we figure out why?\n\nToday, the Universe has evolved into the complex, life-friendly place we know\nit to be because we were able to form neutral atoms early on in the Universe.\nYet without just the right quantum properties, the formation of stable,\nneutral atoms would have been delayed significantly, or might not have even\noccurred at all.\n\nCredit: agsandrew / Adobe Stock and remotevfx / Adobe Stock\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  * No matter how you attempt to measure or calculate certain quantum properties, there will always be some inherent uncertainty present, making complete knowledge of such a system impossible.\n  * But where does that uncertainty come from? Is it a property inherent to particles, or is there some other underlying cause that we haven't yet been able to uncover?\n  * Could it have anything to do with the quantum fields that are inherent to empty space itself? Or does that just punt the known problem into unknown territory?\n\nEthan Siegel\n\nShare The physical reason behind quantum uncertainty on Facebook\n\nShare The physical reason behind quantum uncertainty on Twitter (X)\n\nShare The physical reason behind quantum uncertainty on LinkedIn\n\nPerhaps the most bizarre property we\u2019ve discovered about the Universe is that\nour physical reality doesn\u2019t seem to be governed by purely deterministic laws.\nInstead, at a fundamental, quantum level, the laws of physics are only\nprobabilistic: you can compute the likelihood of the possible experimental\noutcomes that will occur, but only by measuring the quantity in question can\nyou truly determine what your particular system is doing at that instant in\ntime. Furthermore, the very act of measuring/observing certain quantities\nleads to an increased uncertainty in certain related properties: what\nphysicists call conjugate variables.\n\nWhile many have put forth the idea that this uncertainty and indeterminism\nmight only be apparent, and could be due to some unseen \u201chidden\u201d variables\nthat truly are deterministic, we have yet to find a mechanism that allows us\nto successfully predict any quantum outcomes. But could the quantum fields\ninherent to space be the ultimate culprit? That\u2019s this week\u2019s question from\nPaul Marinaccio, who wants to know:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering for a long time: does the quantum vacuum supply the\nwhatever for the particle wave packet vibrations. Does it act... the way\npeople thought the ether did? I know this is a vastly simplified way of asking\nthe question but I don\u2019t know how to put it in mathematical terms.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what the Universe has to say about such an idea. Here we\ngo!\n\nTrajectories of a particle in a box (also called an infinite square well) in\nclassical mechanics (A) and quantum mechanics (B-F). In (A), the particle\nmoves at constant velocity, bouncing back and forth. In (B-F), wavefunction\nsolutions to the Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation are shown for the same\ngeometry and potential. The horizontal axis is position, the vertical axis is\nthe real part (blue) or imaginary part (red) of the wavefunction. These\nstationary (B, C, D) and non-stationary (E, F) states only yield probabilities\nfor the particle, rather than definitive answers for where it will be at a\nparticular time.\n\nCredit: Steve Byrnes via Mathematica; Sbyrnes321/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn quantum physics, there are two main ways to think about uncertainty. One\nis, \u201cI created my system with these particular properties, and then when I\ncome back at some later time, what can I say about those properties?\u201d For some\nproperties \u2014 like the mass of a stable particle, the electric charge of a\nparticle, the energy level of an electron bound in its atom\u2019s ground state,\netc. \u2014 those properties will remain unchanged. As long as there are no further\ninteractions between the quantum particle and its environmental surroundings,\nthese properties will fall clearly into the realm of the known, with no\nuncertainty.\n\nBut other properties are less certain. Put down a free electron in space at a\nprecisely known position, and when you come back later, the electron\u2019s\nposition can no longer be definitively known: the wavefunction that describes\nits position spreads out over time. If you want to know whether an unstable\nparticle has decayed, you can only find out by measuring that particle\u2019s\nproperties and seeing whether it has or not. And if you ask what the mass of\nan unstable particle that radioactively decayed was, which you can reconstruct\nby measuring the energy and momentum of each of the particles it decayed into,\nyou\u2019ll get a slightly different answer from event-to-event, uncertain\ndependent on the particle\u2019s lifetime.\n\nThe inherent width, or half the width of the peak in the above image when\nyou\u2019re halfway to the crest of the peak, is measured to be 2.5 GeV: an\ninherent uncertainty of about +/- 3% of the total mass. The mass of the\nparticle in question, the Z boson, is peaked at 91.187 GeV, but that mass is\ninherently uncertain by a significant amount owing to its excessively short\nlifetime. This result is remarkably consistent with Standard Model\npredictions.\n\nCredit: J. Schieck for the ATLAS Collaboration, JINST7, 2012\n\nThat\u2019s a form of uncertainty that arises because of time-evolution: because\nthe quantum nature of reality ensures that certain properties can only ever be\nknown to a certain precision. As time goes on, that uncertainty propagates\ninto the future, leading to a physical state that cannot be arbitrarily well-\nknown.\n\nBut there\u2019s another way that uncertainty arises: because certain pairs of\nquantities \u2014 those conjugate variables \u2014 are related in ways where knowing one\nto better precision inherently reduces the knowledge you can possess about the\nother one. This arises directly from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and\nit rears its head in a wide variety of situations.\n\nThe most common example is between position and momentum. The better you\nmeasure where a particle is, the less inherently able you are to know what its\nmomentum is: how fast and in what direction its \u201cquantity of motion\u201d is. This\nmakes sense if you think about how a measurement of position is made: by\ncausing a quantum interaction between the particle you\u2019re measuring with\nanother quantum, either with or without a rest mass. Either way, the particle\ncan be assigned a wavelength, with more energetic particles having shorter\nwavelengths, and hence being able to measure a position more precisely.\n\nThe size, wavelength, and temperature/energy scales that correspond to various\nparts of the electromagnetic spectrum. You have to go to higher energies, and\nshorter wavelengths, to probe the smallest scales. Ultraviolet light is\nsufficient to ionize atoms, but as the Universe expands, light gets\nsystematically shifted to lower temperatures and longer wavelengths.\n\nCredits: NASA and Inductiveload/Wikimedia Commons\n\nBut if you stimulate a quantum particle by causing it to interact with another\nquantum particle, there\u2019s going to be an exchange of momentum between them.\nThe greater the energy of the interacting particle:\n\n  * the shorter its wavelength is,\n  * leading to a better-known position,\n  * but also leading to a greater amount of energy-and-momentum imparted to the particle,\n  * which leads to a greater uncertainty in its momentum.\n\nYou might think you can do something clever to \u201ccheat\u201d this, such as measuring\nthe momentum of the outgoing particle that you used to determine the\nparticle\u2019s position, but alas, such an attempt doesn\u2019t save you.\n\nThere\u2019s a minimum amount of uncertainty that\u2019s always preserved: the product\nof your uncertainty in each of the two quantities must always be greater than\nor equal to a specific value. No matter how well you measure the position (\u0394x)\nand/or momentum (\u0394p) of each particle involved in these interactions, the\nproduct of their uncertainty (\u0394x\u0394p) is always greater than or equal to half of\nthe reduced Planck constant, \u0127/2.\n\nThis diagram illustrates the inherent uncertainty relation between position\nand momentum. When one is known more accurately, the other is inherently less\nable to be known accurately. Every time you accurately measure one, you ensure\na greater uncertainty in the corresponding complementary quantity.\n\nCredit: Maschen/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThere are many other quantities that exhibit this uncertainty relation, not\njust position and momentum. These include:\n\n  * orientation and angular momentum,\n  * energy and time,\n  * a particle\u2019s spin in mutually perpendicular directions,\n  * electric potential and free electric charge,\n  * magnetic potential and free electric current,\n\nas well as numerous others.\n\nIt\u2019s true that we live in a quantum Universe, so it makes sense, intuitively,\nto ask whether there isn\u2019t some sort of hidden variable underpinning all of\nthis quantum \u201cweirdness.\u201d After all, many have philosophized over whether\nthese quantum notions that this uncertainty is unavoidable is inherent,\nmeaning that it\u2019s an inextricable property of nature itself, or whether\nthere\u2019s an underlying cause that we simply haven\u2019t been able to pinpoint. The\nlatter approach, favored by many great minds throughout history (including\nEinstein), is commonly known as a hidden variables assumption.\n\nThe quantum nature of the Universe tells us that certain quantities have an\ninherent uncertainty built into them, and that pairs of quantities have their\nuncertainties related to one another. There is no evidence for a more\nfundamental reality with hidden variables that underlies our observable,\nquantum Universe. This illustration shows the early Universe as consisting of\nquantum foam, where quantum fluctuations are large, varied, and important on\nthe smallest of scales.\n\nCredit: NASA/CXC/M. Weiss\n\nThe way I like to imagine hidden variables is like having the Universe, and\nall the particles in it, sitting atop a rapidly, chaotically vibrating plate\nset to the lowest amplitude setting. When you\u2019re looking at the Universe on\nlarge, macroscopic scales, you can\u2019t see the effects of this vibration at all;\nit appears as though the \u201cbackdrop\u201d of the Universe that all the particles\nexist in is stable, constant, and devoid of fluctuations.\n\nBut as you look down to smaller and smaller scales, you notice that there are\nthese quantum properties present. Quantities do fluctuate; things don\u2019t remain\nperfectly stable and unchanging over time; and the more persistently you try\nto pin down any one particular quantum property, the greater you\u2019ll find an\nuncertainty in its associated conjugate quantity.\n\nYou can easily imagine, based on the fact that there are quantum fields\npermeating all of space, even completely empty space, that these underlying\nfields themselves are the source of all of it. The uncertainty that we\u2019re\nseeing, perhaps, arises as a consequence of the quantum vacuum.\n\nVisualization of a quantum field theory calculation showing virtual particles\nin the quantum vacuum. Even in empty space, this vacuum energy is non-zero,\nbut without specific boundary conditions, individual particle properties will\nnot be constrained. In curved space, the quantum vacuum differs from flat\nspace, just as an accelerating observer experiences a different quantum vacuum\nfrom an inertial observer.\n\nCredit: Derek Leinweber\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not an idea that\u2019s easy to rule out, given that the fact of\nquantum uncertainty is \u201cbaked in\u201d to our fundamental understanding of\nparticles and fields. Every formulation (that works) of quantum mechanics and\nquantum field theory includes it, and includes it at a fundamental level, not\njust as an ad hoc addition after-the-fact. In fact, we don\u2019t even know how to\nuse quantum field theory to calculate what the overall contribution to the\nquantum vacuum is for each of the fundamental forces; we only know, through\nour measurement of dark energy, what the total contribution must be. When we\nattempt to do such a calculation, the answers we get are nonsensical,\nproviding us with no meaningful information at all.\n\nBut there are a few pieces of information that would be difficult to explain\nwith the idea that fluctuations in the underlying space itself is responsible\nfor the quantum uncertainty and wave-packet spreading that we observe. For\none, just consider what happens when you take a quantum particle that has an\ninherent (spin) angular momentum, you allow it to move through space, and you\napply a magnetic field to it.\n\nIn the Stern-Gerlach experiment, illustrated here, a quantum particle with a\nfinite spin is passed through a magnetic field, which causes the spin to\nbecome well-determined in that direction: either positive (spin up) or\nnegative (spin down). Each particle takes one path or the other, and\nthereafter has no more uncertainty in its spin along the axis of the applied\nmagnetic field; you get a set of discrete values (5), not a continuum of\nvalues (4) as you\u2019d expect were the spins randomly oriented in three-\ndimensional space.\n\nCredit: Tatoute/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThat particle will deflect by either a positive or negative amount: dependent\non the direction of the magnetic field you apply to it and on whether the spin\nof that particle happens to be oriented in the positive or negative direction.\nThe deflection occurs along the same dimension that the magnetic field is\napplied in.\n\nNow go and apply a magnetic field in a different, perpendicular direction.\nYou\u2019ve already determined what the spin was in one particular direction, so\nwhat do you think will happen if you apply that magnetic field in a different\ndirection?\n\nThe answer is that the particle will deflect again, with a 50/50 probability\nof either being aligned with the direction of the field or being anti-aligned\nwith the direction of the field.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the interesting part. The interesting part is that the act of\nmaking that measurement, of applying that extra, perpendicular field, actually\ndestroyed the information you had previously gained from applying that first\nmagnetic field. If you then apply the identical field that you applied back\nduring the first part of the experiment, those particles, even if they were\nall positively oriented previously, will have random spins once again: 50/50\naligned versus anti-aligned with the field.\n\nWhen you pass a set of particles through a single Stern-Gerlach magnet, they\nwill deflect according to their spin. If you pass them through a second,\nperpendicular magnet, they\u2019ll split again in the new direction. If you then go\nback to the first direction with a third magnet, they\u2019ll once again split,\nproving that previously determined information was randomized by the most\nrecent measurement.\n\nCredit: MJasK/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to make sense of this under the assumption that the quantum\nvacuum itself is responsible for the whole of quantum uncertainty. In this\ninstance, the particle\u2019s behavior is dependent on the external field you\napplied to it and the subsequent interactions that it experienced, not on the\nproperties of the empty space that it passed through. If you remove the second\nmagnet from the aforementioned setup \u2014 the one that was oriented perpendicular\nto the first-and-third magnets \u2014 there would be no uncertainty as to the\nparticle\u2019s spin by the time it made it to the third magnet.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how \u201cempty space\u201d itself, or \u201cthe quantum vacuum\u201d if you\nprefer, could be responsible for quantum uncertainty based on what the results\nof this experiment show. It\u2019s the interactions (or lack thereof) that a\nquantum system experiences which dictate how quantum uncertainty rears its\nhead, not any property inherent to the fields permeating all of space.\n\nLike it or not, the reality of what you observe depends on how and whether you\nobserve it; you simply get different experimental outcomes owing to the\nspecifics of your measurement apparatus.\n\nElectrons exhibit wave properties as well as particle properties, and can be\nused to construct images or probe particle sizes just as well as light can.\nHere, you can see the results of an experiment where electrons are fired one-\nat-a-time through a double-slit. Once enough electrons are fired, the\ninterference pattern can clearly be seen.\n\nCredit: Thierry Dugnolle/Wikimedia Commons\n\nTo date, there is no theory of hidden variables that has resulted in any\nexperimental or observational evidence that there is an underlying, objective\nreality that\u2019s independent of our measurements. Many people suspect that this\nis true, but this is based on intuition and philosophical reasoning: neither\nof which are admissible as scientifically valid reasons for drawing a\nconclusion of any sort.\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the\nnewsletter every Saturday. All aboard!\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean people shouldn\u2019t keep formulating such theories or\nattempting to design experiments that could reveal or rule out the presence of\nhidden variables; that\u2019s part of how science moves forward. But so far, all\nsuch formulations have only led to constraints on and invalidations of\nspecific classes of hidden variable theories. The notion that there are\n\u201chidden variables, and they\u2019re all encoded in the quantum vacuum,\u201d cannot be\nruled out.\n\nBut if I were to bet on where to look next, I\u2019d note that in the (Newtonian)\ntheory of gravity, there are also conjugate variables present: gravitational\npotential and mass density. If the analogy with electromagnetism (between\nelectric potential and free electric charge) holds, which we expect it to,\nthat means we can extract an uncertainty relation for gravity as well.\n\nIs gravitation an inherently quantum force? Someday, we might be able to\nexperimentally determine whether this quantum uncertainty exists for\ngravitation as well. If so, we\u2019ll have our answer.\n\nEthan is on medical leave until May 6th.
