(Image\ncredit: Max Space)\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Max Space wants to help humanity expand into the final\nfrontier.\n\nThe startup is developing a range of inflatable space habitats, the largest of\nwhich could provide as much internal volume as a sports stadium. These plans,\nwhich Max Space unveiled on Tuesday (April 9) here at the 39th Space\nSymposium, are designed to help our species make the difficult leap off its\nhome planet.\n\n\"The problem with space today is, there isn't enough habitable space in\nspace,\" Max Space co-founder Aaron Kemmer said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\"Unless we make usable space in space a lot less expensive, and much much\nlarger, humanity's future in space will remain limited.\"\n\nRelated: Living on the moon: What it would be like (infographic)\n\nBack in 2010, Kemmer co-founded the off-Earth manufacturing company Made In\nSpace, which has sent multiple 3D-printing devices to the International Space\nStation (ISS) over the years. (Made In Space was acquired by Redwire in 2020.)\n\nHe says that experience helped convince him that expandable habitats are the\nfuture, citing one of the machines Made In Space modified for use on the ISS.\n\n\"It's like a three-story system on Earth, and all the engineering wasn't to\nmake it work in space \u2014 it was actually to get it down to a locker [size],\njust because there wasn't enough real estate in there,\" Kemmer told Space.com\nin an interview here at the symposium on Tuesday.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nExpandable habitats, as the name suggests, launch in compressed form to fit\ninside rocket fairings but increase in size greatly when deployed in space.\nThey therefore offer much more bang for the buck volume-wise than traditional\n\"tin can\" module designs.\n\nAn expandable habitat with 100 cubic meters (3,530 cubic feet) of pressurized\nvolume, for example, would be \"at least an order of magnitude cheaper\" than a\ncomparable metallic one, Kemmer said. (For perspective: The ISS offers 388\ncubic meters, or 13,700 cubic feet, of habitable volume, not including the\nspace provided by visiting vehicles.)\n\nThis is not a sci-fi concept; three expandable module prototypes are actually\ncircling Earth right now. They are Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, which are free\nfliers that launched in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and the Bigelow Expandable\nActivity Module (BEAM), which has been attached to the ISS since 2016.\n\nAll three were built by Nevada-based company Bigelow Aerospace, which closed\nits doors in 2020. The pressure-restraining hulls for Genesis 1 and Genesis 2\nwere designed and manufactured by Thin Red Line Aerospace, a small Canadian\ncompany run by Maxim de Jong \u2014 Max Space's other co-founder.\n\nThe new startup, which has been in operation for about a year, is\ncommercializing Thin Red Line Aerospace technology, Kemmer and de Jong said.\nBut that tech isn't just a Genesis retread.\n\n\"It's a very, very, very different approach, where you're just putting fibers\nin an uncoupled scenario where they don't conflict with one another,\" de Jong\ntold Space.com on Tuesday. The result, he and Kemmer said, is a cost-effective\nmodule that expands in a predictable and reliable way, and is highly scalable\nto larger sizes.\n\nThe ground-test unit of Max Space's 20-cubic-meter (706 cubic feet) expandable\nhabitat. A flight version of this module is expected to launch to Earth orbit\nin 2026. (Image credit: Max Space)\n\nThe new tech will get its first off-Earth test just two years from now, if all\ngoes according to plan: Max Space has booked a spot on a SpaceX rideshare\nlaunch in 2026.\n\nThat mission will send a module the size of two large suitcases to orbit.\nHowever, that's the habitat's compressed configuration. Once deployed, it will\nexpand to a pressurized volume of 20 cubic meters (706 cubic feet).\n\nThis deployment will set a new record for expandable habitats. The two Genesis\nprototypes both feature 11.5 cubic meters (406 cubic feet) of internal volume,\nwhile BEAM has 16 cubic meters (565 cubic feet).\n\nMax Space has already built a full-size prototype of the first flight unit,\nwhich the company is using for ground testing, Kemmer said. It has started\nmanufacturing the flight vehicle, which will not feature life-support systems\nbut will have the same shielding and strength as human-rated versions.\n\nRelated: NASA's moon-orbiting space station will be claustrophobic, architect\nsays\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 NASA looks to private outposts to build on International Space Station's\nlegacy\n\n\u2014 NASA working to get private space stations up and running before ISS retires\nin 2030\n\n\u2014 Boom! Watch an inflatable space habitat explode during testing (video)\n\nMax Space plans to keep moving fast after this pioneering module makes it to\norbit. The startup aims to launch its first 100-cubic-meter (3,531 cubic feet)\nmodule in 2027 and to get a 1,000-cubic-meter (35,314 cubic feet) behemoth up\nby 2030. Even larger variants could potentially launch thereafter, aboard\nSpaceX's Starship megarocket or Blue Origin's New Glenn vehicle, the company\nsaid.\n\nThe goal is to provide a variety of destinations to a range of customers, from\npharmaceutical companies that want to mass-produce medicines in microgravity\nto commercial space stations that want to expand their living space all the\nway to movie studios looking to film in orbit.\n\n\"We have several space production companies that we're talking to,\" Kemmer\nsaid. The company has already secured some customer contracts, including from\nthe U.S. Space Force, he added.\n\nBut Earth orbit will be just the starting point for Max Space modules, if all\ngoes according to plan.\n\n\"My dream is to have a city on the moon before I die,\" Kemmer said. \"So I look\nat this like, this is going to be the habitat, the structures, that are going\nto go inside the lava tubes buried under the [lunar] surface.\"\n\nThe company's modules would then make their way to Mars, if all goes well, for\nMax Space wants to be a key enabler of off-Earth settlement. Indeed, that's\nwhy Kemmer and de Jong founded the company \u2014 to help humanity extend its\nfootprint out into the solar system.\n\n\"That was the entire reason,\" Kemmer said.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

Without\n> shielding, it is deadly to spend too much time there.\n\nShielding for long-term habitation on orbit is a tough one, no doubt, but\nKemmer does mention toward the end of the article:\n\n\"My dream is to have a city on the moon before I die,\" Kemmer said. \"So I look\nat this like, this is going to be the habitat, the structures, that are going\nto go inside the lava tubes buried under the surface.\"\n\nBesides burying strucutures in lunar regolith to provide the necessary\nshielding there of course have been a lot of discussions and speculation about\nutilizing sub-surface lava tubes - on Mars of course as well.\n\nExciting times!\n\nReply\n\n  * Catastrophe\n\n> building habitat modules that could expand to enormous sizes\n\nI sometimes wonder, when seeing such statements referring to enormous sizes,\nwhether the posters have thought how much energy/fuel is needed to get the\ncomponents on site. Similarly, when it is glibly suggested that you just build\na factory in space to make these structures using \"local\" raw materials, has\nit been considered how much fuel is needed to get the \"bits\" there? Some\nexamples could need more fuel than the total payload. Of course, there are\nsuggestions of solar sails, but are these in any way even close to being\npractical in such cases?\n\nCat :)\n\nReply\n\n  * Questioner\n\nI would worry about micrometeorites. I would sleep with my suit helmet nearby\nand some tough duct tape for quick repairs. Make sure the pressure alarm is\nworking. With that & radiation I would want to have it in a rock shielded\nhole. Abrasive moon glass shards don't help.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nChina moving at 'breathtaking speed' in final frontier, Space Force says\n\nBy Mike WallApril 10, 2024\n\nAstronauts' photos capture April 8 solar eclipse from Earth orbit\n\nBy Robert Z.
