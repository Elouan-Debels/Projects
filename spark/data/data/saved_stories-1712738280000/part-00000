802.1x\n\nBelieve it or not, the aging WPA-Personal protocol has seen some innovation in\nthe past few years. Several companies have developed unique PSK authentication\nprotocols with varying names, though \u201cPrivate PSK\u201d (PPSK) has emerged as the\ncommonly-accepted phrase.\n\nHere are some of the proprietary names for the same technology:\n\n  * Private PSK \u2013 Aerohive and Extreme\n  * Identity PSK \u2013 Cisco\n  * ePSK \u2013 Cambium and Mist/Juniper\n\nWhat is PPSK? It\u2019s a step up from vanilla PSK, there\u2019s no doubt. In a regular\nWPA-Personal network with pre-shared key authentication, one password is used\nto connect any number of devices to the access point (AP). PPSK is a\nconfiguration in which each device has a unique pre-shared key that it uses to\nauthenticate to the AP.\n\nDoes that sound familiar? Oh yeah, that\u2019s pretty much how 802.1x\nauthentication works. So why not just use that?\n\n## 802.1x Is a Better Alternative to Unique PSK\n\nThere\u2019s this lingering impression that 802.1x is complicated, expensive, and\nultimately not worth it...\n\nThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\n### 802.1x is Easier to Implement than Unique PSK\n\nThe belief that 802.1x and WPA2-Enterprise are difficult to implement is\noutdated. That hasn\u2019t been true for years. With the advent of cloud computing,\non-premise RADIUS is a distant memory. SecureW2 can configure a Cloud RADIUS\nserver and a managed PKI service for you in less than a day. Onboarding\nsoftware has also made it incredibly easy to setup and manage devices for\n802.1x.\n\nIt\u2019s true, however, that WPA-PSK requires little-to-nothing in the way of\nsetup, but it\u2019s less true when talking about unique PSKs. You have to generate\na new credential for each device. Most, if not all, of the implementations of\nunique PSK have a method to bulk-generate credentials, but not all vendors\nhave a key component of onboarding: credential distribution.\n\nDistributing those generated credentials and registering them to each device\nis usually called device onboarding. The ease with which you can onboard\ndevices to 802.1x is one of its great strengths \u2013 our own JoinNow software can\nautomatically configure your devices to receive credentials or certificates\nand self-enroll to your WPA2-Enterprise network.\n\nNot every vendor has a solution for distributing credentials. If you have\nhundreds or thousands of devices, it quickly becomes infeasible to enroll each\nfor a credential manually.\n\n### 802.1x is More Secure than Unique PSK\n\nNo one is really arguing about this one. It\u2019s an undeniable truth that PSK is\nintrinsically more vulnerable than the combination of a RADIUS server and a\nPKI.\n\nPre-shared key authentication only validates credentials one way. The access\npoint just needs to see the correct sequence of characters and it grants\naccess.\n\nRADIUS authentication is more robust. A device submits its credentials or\ncertificate to the access point, then the RADIUS checks against a directory\nstored in the PKI. The PKI confirms whether or not that user is valid, then\nsends the OK back to the RADIUS which authenticates the device. It can even be\nconfigured for Identity Lookup, which validates a user is active within the\norganization at the time of authentication, further increasing security.\n\nRADIUS can be even more secure if you utilize the EAP-TLS authentication\nprotocol, which allows you to use digital certificates for authentication.\nCertificates are like photo IDs for devices \u2013 they confirm who is using the\ncredential, which makes them immune to over-the-air attacks, such as the\nnotorious man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n### 802.1x is Future-Proofed\n\n... Or, as future-proofed as any cybersecurity can be.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to spend the time, effort, and money to upgrade security, why\nwould you devote those resources to a \u201cless-bad\u201d version of an ailing\nauthentication protocol?\n\nEven though WPA3 already exists, the most secure organizations are still using\nWPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS. It\u2019s the best network security solution on the\nmarket and it looks like it\u2019ll remain that way for the foreseeable future.\n\nUnique PSK is simply a stop-gap measure. If it isn\u2019t obsolete now, it will be\nsoon. Eventually, as your organization scales, you\u2019ll need to upgrade anyway.\n802.1x can scale with you \u2013 services like our Cloud RADIUS are appropriate\n(and affordable) for organizations of all sizes.\n\n### Unique PSK is Vendor-Locked\n\nNotice how every company has their own branded version of unique PSK? That\u2019s\nbecause they\u2019re all proprietary solutions that vendor-lock your device\u2019s\nsecurity.\n\nHaving your network security held hostage isn\u2019t just uncomfortable \u2013 it\u2019s\nrisky. It prevents you from choosing the safest route, forcing you to accept\nthe rest of their product ecosystem.\n\nThe most prudent option is to use a vendor-agnostic service, like SecureW2\u2019s.\nOur products can be integrated into your existing network without any forklift\nupgrades because they are compatible with every major vendor.\n\n## Use Cases for Unique PSK\n\nWe haven\u2019t been kind to unique PSK in this article, but in the interest of\nfairness, we\u2019ll admit it does have one compelling use case.\n\nUnique PSK is the best option for devices that do not support 802.1x. Whether\nthey\u2019re old devices with outdated network infrastructure or highly specialized\ndevices with an incompatible OS (such as some medical equipment), some devices\nsimply can\u2019t integrate into an 802.1x network.\n\nIn these cases, we encourage you to use unique PSK. It\u2019s certainly better than\nstandard PSK and is a solid way to compartmentalize your network resources\nwith or without dynamic VLAN.\n\nHowever, unique PSK only works for wireless devices \u2013 there\u2019s no wired\nsecurity option. Not every device is wireless-enabled, and that is especially\ntrue for devices that have stringent security requirements... which is where\nyou need network protection the most.\n\n## 802.1x is Better than Unique PSK\n\n802.1x with WPA2-Enterprise (and ideally EAP-TLS auth protocol) is more\nefficient, more secure, easier to implement, and will be relevant long after\nunique PSKs fall to the wayside.\n\nLet us show you how easy and affordable it can be to implement a robust Cloud\nRADIUS and managed PKI service for your organization.
