He founded Aravind, an organization based\nin Madurai, in the south of India, that has delivered nearly 4 million eye\nsurgeries, more than half as many eye surgeries as the entire UK National\nHealth System, at levels of quality comparable to the world\u2019s top academic\nmedical centers, for less than 1% of the cost of NHS. Many of these surgeries\nare free, or at minimal cost, and Aravind\u2019s work to preserve and restore sight\nis among the world\u2019s most effective interventions against poverty when\nmeasured in terms of the long-term impact per dollar invested. Aravind\u2019s core\noperations are self-funding; with the help of relatively small amounts of\nphilanthropic and investment capital they have also built a research\ninstitute, a consulting arm that advises governments and NGOs around the world\nabout how to achieve parallel results, and even a factory that meets FDA\nstandards producing at low costs the key inputs to the practice of ophthalmic\nsurgery.\n\nBehind Dr. V\u2019s ability to build Aravind from a single eleven-bed hospital in\n1976 into an organization of unprecedented impact, quality and scale was his\nquest to become the \u201cperfect instrument\u201d for his vision.\n\nA journal entry from the 1980s, written in a series of eclectic questions (and\nwith his trademark absence of question marks), illustrates how matters of\nservice delivery, leadership and spirituality are intertwined to Dr. V.\n\nIt opens with the magnificent obsession he is known for:\n\n> How to organize and build more hospitals like McDonalds.\n\nAnd then with no warning, it shifts to:\n\n> How was Buddha able to organize in those days a religion that millions\n> follow.\n\nThis question dramatically changes the plane of inquiry. Other searching\nquestions swiftly follow:\n\n> Who were the leaders. How were they shaped. How did the disciples of Christ\n> spread their mission around the world.\n\nAnd then the final question that we would ask in a thousand different ways:\n\n> How do I become a perfect instrument.\n\nTo care about anything in the world is to imply the question of how one\nbecomes an instrument for advancing what matters. The question of great\nachievement need not come from the self\u2019s ambition \u2013 it follows from the\nrecognition that one can be an instrument of something larger.\n\nAmong the most important choices we each make is this choice of how we regard\nthe possibility of great achievement. This choice is woven through how each of\nus crafts our individual path and how we find, help shape and enable others.\n\nWhile there are arguments for and against the impact of the individual \u2013\nCarlyle vs. Tolstoy \u2013 we all benefit from taking an optimistic view of this\nquestion and acting as if individuals can make a very big difference. The\nstructure of this is much like Pascal\u2019s wager. There\u2019s little downside from\nadopting too optimistic a stance, and a great deal of upside if that stance\nproves right.\n\nThere is certainly no recipe for great achievement, but there are patterns.\nThese patterns relate centrally to how we cultivate and overcome influence and\nto how we relate to time, in the immediate flow from moment to moment and over\nthe longer arc of years.\n\n### Image by Tiffany Franke \u2013 http://tiffanyfranke.tumblr.com\n\nPublished on Oct 02 2014 by Niko Canner\n\nNiko Canner Founder\n\nNiko Canner founded Incandescent in 2013.
