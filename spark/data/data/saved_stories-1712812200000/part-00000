While these preclinical results are in\nmice, this approach has the potential for treating atherosclerosis in humans.\n\nIn March, the company announced that it had received positive feedback from\nthe FDA regarding its pre-IND application. The company is now preparing for\nadditional discussions as it moves forward with its plans for clinical trials.\n\n## A possible solution for atherosclerosis and familial hypercholesterolemia\n\nAtherosclerosis occurs when plaque builds up in arteries, causing blockages\nthat can result in heart attacks or strokes. It is the underlying cause of\nabout 50% of all deaths in western society. Therefore, Repair Biotechnologies\nis using new technology to safely remove excess cholesterol in cells. This\nprovides a different way to treat atherosclerosis, heart disease, and other\nconditions.\n\nThe company is developing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and messenger RNA (mRNA)\nto address various diseases. Its therapy focuses on reducing harmful\ncholesterol inside cells, not just in the blood. This can help prevent health\nissues caused by high cholesterol levels.\n\nThe company\u2019s approach also shows promise in treating familial\nhypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder in which the liver is less effective\nin removing excess LDL cholesterol. This results in elevated LDL levels in the\nbloodstream, posing health risks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Preclinical results show promise\n\nResearchers tested the LNP-mRNA treatment on mouse models of atherosclerosis\nand familial hypercholesterolemia for six weeks. Both test groups of mice\nshowed a significant reduction in plaque formation. The company reported the\nfollowing exciting results:\n\n  * Atherosclerotic mice saw a 19% reduction in plaque lipids and a 23% increase in plaque collagen. This is suggestive of artery plaque having stabilized.\n  * Familial hypercholesterolemia model mice saw a 17% reduction in plaque obstruction in the aortic root. Cardiovascular performance improved as well, with increased treadmill capacity.\n\nWe had the opportunity to talk to Reason, the CEO of Repair Biotechnologies,\nabout these exciting results. He has long been an advocate for aging and\nrejuvenation research, which he has done for a long time on the blog Fight\nAging.\n\n### Could you explain how your LNP and mRNA system works and how it degrades\nharmful cholesterol and reduces plaques?\n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are what they sound like, a tiny assembly of lipid\nmolecules. Most LNPs used in therapy are in the 50 to 300 nanometer range.\nThere are an infinite number of lipid combinations one could create. Only a\nfew of these are useful, but those few are good at encapsulating materials\nsuch as small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids and then introducing\nthose materials into the cytosol of the cell.\n\nThe main thrust of LNP development in recent decades has been the production\nof safer LNPs, allowing higher and repeated dosing, and LNPs that have a\ngreater ability to selectively reach specific tissues in the body.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf one is going to be introducing material into the cell cytoplasm, messenger\nRNA (mRNA) is a good candidate, as that is where mRNA needs to be in order for\ntranslation to proteins to take place in the ribosome. In the translation\nprocess, proteins are produced from the mRNA, and one mRNA molecule leads to\nthe manufacture of many proteins before it is broken down.\n\nFollowing COVID-19, the manufacture of mRNA has grown to become a sizable\nconcern, and an entire industry is now tasked with figuring out how to make\nsynthesized mRNA ever safer, more efficient, and non-immunogenic.\n\nWe presently use this system of LNP-delivered synthetic mRNA to generate our\nproprietary Cholesterol Degrading Platform (CDP) fusion protein inside cells\nin the liver. The liver is an easy target for all forms of drug that are\ninjected intravenously, and many of the existing, better-known LNPs were\ndeveloped specifically to target the liver. CDP consists of a number of\nproteins that are not normally expressed in conjunction, but when acting\ntogether, they target only excess free cholesterol molecules for degradation.\n\nIt is important to remember that cholesterol is usually modified in the body.\nIt is either stashed in a cell membrane, esterified in droplets for storage\ninside cells, or attached to some form of lipoprotein particle for transport.\nFree cholesterol, the unmodified form, is toxic to cells. The presence of free\ncholesterol and consequent cell dysfunction and cell death contributes\nmeaningfully to atherosclerosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated\nsteatohepatitis (MASH), and a wide range of other conditions.\n\nThe options for free cholesterol clearance are limited by the points that (a)\ncholesterol is everywhere in cells and tissues and (b) our cells have no\nability to break down excess cholesterol. There is no preexisting \u201cbreak down\nexcess cholesterol\u201d process with a regulatory system that can be influenced by\nsuitably designed small molecule drugs. The alternative possibility of small\nmolecules that are designed to bind to and sequester cholesterol would kill\ncells by pulling the cholesterol from their membranes long before reaching a\ndose that is able to remove enough free cholesterol from inside cells to\nmatter. The only path forward is to craft a sophisticated and selective\nassembly of protein machinery and deliver that assembly as a gene therapy, as\nwe have done.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### You had some really interesting results from the preclinical testing. Can\nyou talk us through the findings and their implications?\n\nTo date, we have demonstrated rapid and profound reversal of disease in mouse\nmodels of (a) MASH, a progression of fatty liver towards liver failure that is\ncharacterized by fibrosis and loss of liver function, (b) atherosclerosis, the\nbuildup of fatty plaques in blood vessel walls, leading to cardiovascular\ndisease and stroke, and (c) homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH),\nan inherited condition involving loss-of-function mutations in low-density\nlipoprotein receptors (LDLR) that causes high blood cholesterol and greatly\naccelerated atherosclerosis.\n\nThese three conditions are characterized by being largely irreversible under\nthe present standards of care. While slowing the progression of disease is\nsometimes possible, few patients have been shown to achieve any meaningful\nreversal of established liver fibrosis or arterial atherosclerotic plaque, and\nthe methods used to treat those patients are not consistently effective in\nother patients.\n\nIn each case, 6 to 8 weeks of once-weekly injections of CDP therapy produced\nsizable improvements in blood chemistry, including reductions in alanine\naminotransferase (ALT), a measure of liver cell death and stress, and in\nhistological assessments of disease. In MASH model mice, a 52% reduction in\nliver fibrosis was observed versus untreated controls.\n\nIn the ApoE-knockout mouse model of atherosclerosis, plaque lipids were\nreduced by 19% while plaque collagen increased by 23% versus controls, a\ndramatic stabilization of unstable plaques at risk of rupture. In the LDLR-\nknockout mouse model of HoFH, plaque cross-sectional area decreased by 17% and\nmouse treadmill performance improved by 60% versus controls, a considerable\nimprovement in cardiovascular function.\n\nTo compare this with other present efforts, the drug, resmetirom (Madrigal\nPharmaceuticals), recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH, has\nno effect on fibrosis in mice over 8 weeks of treatment. In the MAESTRO human\ntrial in patients with comparatively mild MASH, the treated groups saw only\n25% reduction in fibrosis compared to 14% in the placebo group after 52 weeks\nof treatment.\n\nIn the case of atherosclerosis, large clinical trials have shown that long-\nterm treatment with statins or other low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering\ntechnologies such as PCSK9 inhibitors fails to produce a reduction in\natherosclerotic plaque volume of more than a few percentage points. Our CDP\ntherapy far outperforms these approaches to treatment.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting outcome is that we have demonstrated that a\nlocalized excess of free cholesterol is indeed a major factor in many\nconditions, age-related and obesity-related. It had been theorized that this\nwas the case for liver diseases such as MASH, but lacking a technology that\nselectively cleared only free cholesterol, this had to remain only a\ncompelling theory. Armed with that selective clearance technology, our results\nhave now convincingly demonstrated that free cholesterol is a major, important\ntarget for many conditions.\n\n### Let\u2019s touch upon the scalability of this technology. A concern for many\npeople interested in our field is access and affordability. Can you speak\nabout if or how your technology is or is not scalable to address these\nconcerns?\n\nLNPs are very cheap to manufacture at scale. Still, LNP-mRNA is presently a\ncomparatively expensive technology for development purposes because of the\ncost of producing synthetic mRNA. But synthetic mRNA has now had its fifteen\nminutes of fame in the context of COVID-19 vaccines, and there exist other\ntherapies that use a great deal more mRNA per dose than a vaccine requires.\n\nThe incentive to reduce manufacturing costs is there, and work progresses on\nthat front. If one looks at what has happened to the techniques and price of\nmanufacture of adeno-associated virus (AAV) in recent decades, there have been\nimprovements even in the absence of a mass-market AAV drug. Given a mRNA drug,\nsuch as ours, that can in principle be of use to most older people, the\nincentive to find ways to reduce manufacturing costs will be sizable.\n\n### Given the success of mRNA vaccines for COVID and how rapidly they were\ndeveloped and distributed, what do you think our field can learn from that?\n\nThat regulatory caution depends on contexts other than utilitarian cost-\nbenefit calculations. One can certainly look at the unmet need of\natherosclerosis (larger) versus the unmet need of COVID-19 (smaller) and ask\nwhy regulators treat these two problems with the opposite degree of enthusiasm\nfor the approval of therapies. But this misses the point about the way in\nwhich people think about the status quo versus new problems.\n\n### Your LNP/mRNA approach could have broader applications. I know some\ncompanies for example are exploring using mRNAs for senolytics and partial\nreprogramming. What other directions are you considering at Repair?\n\nLNP-mRNA therapies are the most small-molecule-like of the gene therapies.\nThey are delivered, have an effect for a few days, and then are no longer\npresent in the patient. That makes it easy for conservative organizations,\nwhether regulators or inventors, to fit them into their understanding of the\nworld of medical development.\n\nIn terms of what comes next for Repair, there are so very many potential uses\nfor CDP that it is hard to say which will rise to the top of the list after\natherosclerosis and MASH. Recall that a number of common neurodegenerative\nconditions are characterized by dysregulated lipid metabolism and lipid\ndroplets in misbehaving cells, for example. The use of CDP to treat any one of\nthose, and the development of an appropriate LNP vector, could be a company-\nsized endeavor in and of itself.\n\n### What are the next steps for Repair Bio and moving towards clinical trials?\n\nRaising and spending a great deal of funding! Once past our present point of\nconducting pre-IND meetings with the FDA, the heavily regulated path to a\nBiologic License Application (BLA) is an expensive proposition: good\nlaboratory practice (GLP) studies in mice and non-human primates; setting up a\ngood manufacturing practice (GMP) process for drug manufacture with a contract\ndevelopment and manufacturing organization (CDMO); manufacturing the GMP-grade\ndrug for animal and human studies; organizing a clinical trial and engaging a\nspecialist contract research organization (CRO) to run it; and all of the\nother necessary high-cost parts of the puzzle.\n\n### Switching tack for a moment: only a decade ago, the biggest problem for\nour field was funding for early-stage research, which seems to have improved\nin recent years. What would you say is now the greatest bottleneck in our\nfield to getting rejuvenation biotechnologies to the masses?\n\nI would say that there are two biggest problems. The first is that there\nremains too little funding for optimal progress, both for research and later\ndevelopment. Once a program makes the leap from academia to a biotech startup,\nthese companies are largely finding seed-stage funding, at least when the\noverall financial markets are in decent shape.\n\nOnce a company is at the Series A or pre-IND stage, between proof of concept\nand first clinical trial, it becomes much harder to find funding. It is too\nfar along for the early stage investors, and not far enough along for the\ninstitutional biotech investors with deep pockets.\n\nThe second biggest problem is there there is no infrastructure to bring\ngeneric drugs that we believe are likely useful (e.g. rapamycin or the\nsenolytic dasatinib and quercetin combination) or non-drug procedures that we\nbelieve are likely useful (e.g. fecal microbiota transplantation or many forms\nof stem cell transplantation still only accessible via medical tourism) into\nwidespread use.\n\nThere is no panoply of philanthropic organizations set up to run the necessary\nclinical trials to convince physicians that these interventions are in fact\ngreat. Those trials could run at a much lower cost than the sort of trial\nrequired by the FDA, lacking most of the expensive frills, but still aiming at\nresponsible, robust creation of human data.\n\nIt has been nearly a decade since the first mouse data on dasatinib and\nquercetin was published, and five years since a human trial confirmed this\ntreatment to reduce the burden of senescent cells in patients. Yet only a\nsmall number of other clinical trials are underway, and other than a few self-\nexperimenters, and the patients of a few anti-aging physicians, older people\nare not using this general, off-label drug combination.\n\nThere is no energetic effort to assess efficacy in clinical trials for more\nthan just a few of the large number of age-related conditions that clearance\nof senescent cells has been shown to improve in mice. It seems madness for\nthis situation of little data, little usage, and few attempts to produce that\ndata to continue. Yet here we are.\n\n### As a long-standing advocate for our field, how do you think things have\nchanged in the last decade and are you more optimistic or pessimistic about\nthe future?\n\nPessimistic in the short term (timescales of a decade), optimistic in the long\nterm (timescales of two decades and longer). There is a great deal of\npromising work underway now in academia and industry, far more than was the\ncase a decade past, and tackling many more of the different aspects of aging.\n\nThat said, it is taking far too long for existing low-cost, generic approaches\nto incremental, piecemeal rejuvenation, such as the aforementioned fecal\nmicrobiota transplantation and dasatinib and quercetin combination, to be\nvalidated in a way that grasps the attention of our society at large and\nthereby enables widespread use.\n\n### Anything else you would like to share with our readers?\n\nThat you can make a difference.
