Segments in Sonoma and Marin counties will be planned\nseparately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would put it in the category of the Pacific Crest Trail, the Appalachian\nTrail \u2014 these large, landscape-scale trails that provide an experience for\npeople to see areas that they just would never have access to otherwise,\u201d said\nCaryl Hart, chair of the California Coastal Commission and board member of the\nGreat Redwood Trail Agency, which is tasked with developing the path.\n\nIf realized, the project would be the longest so-called rail trail in the\ncountry, generally following the defunct track through towering redwoods and\nalong rushing rivers teeming with salmon. The relatively flat trail would\naccommodate hikers, bikers and horseback riders while potentially providing an\neconomic infusion to small towns struggling amid the decline of logging and\nrise of legal cannabis.\n\nOfficials say it\u2019s probably 20 years away from completion but will move\nforward section by section. Tribes are being consulted to guide the project,\nofficials said, but some have claimed they\u2019re being sidelined.\n\nIf fully realized, the Great Redwood Trail would stretch more than 300 miles.\n\n(Great Redwood Trail Agency)\n\nHart said there\u2019s currently no means of taking a continuous walk through vast\nstretches of coast redwoods \u2014 the tallest trees on Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is going to provide, where you can be in the forest for\nlong periods of time,\u201d she said, \u201cand it really is a magical, spiritual\nexperience.\u201d\n\nSeeds of the vision date to the 1980s, when the Northwestern Pacific Railroad\nwas struggling to stay afloat. Local advocates started thinking about turning\nthe troubled line into a trail, said Steve Madrone, board vice chair for the\nGreat Redwood Trail Agency, then a Blue Lake City Council member who was among\nthose pushing for the concept.\n\nThe state tried to prop up the railway, but in 1998 federal officials ordered\nit closed due to safety concerns. As hopes to restore it fizzled, enthusiasm\nfor developing the trail climbed. In 2018, a law passed recognizing that the\ncorridor could become a long-distance trail. About three years later, the\nGreat Redwood Trail Agency was created to shepherd the transition of the\n231-mile northern stretch.\n\nBlue Lake is one of the areas where the trail is currently open to the public.\n\n(Great Redwood Trail Agency)\n\nMost of the trail is still just a dream, but there are some strollable\nsegments in Ukiah, Eureka, Arcata and Blue Lake. The more than 500-page master\nplan identifies 40 segments across the North Coast and ranks them by\nfeasibility, impact and readiness. Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit, or SMART,\nis overseeing the southern portion of the project, where the path will mostly\nfollow a commuter rail line.\n\nGenerating particular excitement among planners is the prospect of opening up\nEel River Canyon, abutting the nearly 200-mile Eel River, which runs along the\nnorthwestern coast not far from the Pacific Ocean. While it snakes through\nsome major population centers, it\u2019s relatively unknown due to inaccessibility\nand lack of infrastructure, said Marin County Supervisor Mary Sackett, board\nchair for the Great Redwood Trail Agency.\n\nIt\u2019s likely to carry the highest cost of all the segments because it is remote\nand requires the removal of railroad debris that has washed into the river.\n\nBesides providing access to a natural gem, \u201cI think that this is the only\nchance we have to clean up that past history,\u201d Sackett said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s North Coast is known for its remote beauty.\n\n(Great Redwood Trail Agency)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvocates say it could also be an economic lifeline for remote hamlets.\nPlanning documents estimate the trail would bring in more than $102 million\nannually, with out-of towners eating, recreating and sleeping in areas that\nare currently off the beaten path.\n\nSackett said illegal cannabis \u2014 concentrated in Humboldt, Mendocino and\nTrinity counties \u2014 once brought in an influx of migrants and money, even as\nthe industry devastated the environment. Hopes of large tax payouts from legal\ngrows largely fizzled, she said.\n\n\u201cIt really brings an opportunity for great economic vitality in some of these\nsmall areas that have been really negatively impacted by the cannabis\nindustry,\u201d Sackett said.\n\nSome local agencies and community members worry the trail could increase\nwildfire risk and create safety hazards for trekkers, as well as invite\nhomeless encampments and trespassing. The master plan offers potential\nstrategies to address those issues, including coordinating with law\nenforcement, social services and other public agencies.\n\nAt least one Native American group has asked for a larger say in how the Great\nRedwood Trail gets built.\n\n(Great Redwood Trail Agency)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadrone, a supervisor for Humboldt County, said tribes of Eel River Canyon\nhave expressed significant anxiety about how the trail could affect their\ncultural resources and sacred sites. In January, the Ukiah Daily Journal\nreported that a group of Wailaki descendants and their allies, calling\nthemselves the Kinest\u2019e Community Coalition, demanded to be a given a more\nprominent seat at the table.\n\nThere are discussions about possible tribal co-management of areas of the\ntrail, Madrone said, adding that there are promising examples of successful\npartnerships in other areas the line runs through, such as Humboldt County.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern on the part of tribes, and rightfully so, about what\nit all means,\u201d Madrone said. \u201cSo we have our work ahead of us to really\ndeliver on building really strong partnerships.\u201d\n\nThe period for public comments on the master plan runs through June 3. Next\nsteps include kicking off a process to secure an environmental permit for the\nwhole master plan. Individual projects may need additional environmental\nreview, but Madrone said having the broader permit should speed things up and\nlower costs.\n\nTravel & Experiences\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### This secret hike through California\u2019s giant redwoods will take you to\nanother world\n\nTips for visiting the spellbinding Grove of Titans in Jedediah Smith Redwoods\nState Park.\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\nClimate & EnvironmentCaliforniaTravel & ExperiencesOutdoorsTransportation\n\nLila Seidman\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n\nLila Seidman is a reporter focused on California wildlife and the outdoors for\nthe Los Angeles Times.
