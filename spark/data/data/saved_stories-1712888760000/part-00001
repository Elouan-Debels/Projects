Mattel\n\nScrabble Together is marketed for those who find the classic game to be\nintimidating or for people who have ever thought \u201cword games aren\u2019t for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrabble has truly stood the test of time as one of the most popular board\ngames in history, and we want to ensure the game continues to be inclusive for\nall players,\u201d Ray Adler, vice president, global head of games for Mattel, said\nin a statement to The Post. \u201cFor anyone who\u2019s ever thought \u2018word games aren\u2019t\nfor me\u2019, or felt a little intimidated by the classic game, Scrabble Together\nmode is an ideal option.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrabble Together Mode continues to celebrate the wonder of words just as the\nClassic version does, but thanks to its exciting new co-operative and dynamic\ngameplay, it\u2019s more accessible and brings people together.\u201d\n\nHowever, some naysayers objected to the changes, calling it \u201cScrabble for\nSnowflakes\u201d and \u201cWoke Scrabble\u201d on X.\n\n6\n\nScrabble Together will include helper cards, use a simpler scoring system, be\nquicker to play and allow people to play in teams. Mattel\n\n6\n\nThe new side is a \u201cless competitive\u201d version to appeal to Gen Z. Mattel\n\n## \u2018No More Scoring!\u2019\n\nSo what\u2019s new exactly? In addition to a dual-sided board, there are helper\ncards, which provide assistance, prompts and clues and can be selected to\nmatch the player\u2019s challenge level of their choice.\n\nIn the new version, scoring is a thing of the past \u2014 now all one has to do is\nfinish a goal and collect the goal card.\n\nGoal cards include challenges such as: \u201cPlay a horizontal word,\u201d \u201cplay a\nthree-letter word\u201d or \u201cplay a word that touches the edge of the board.\u201d\n\nThe player who completes 20 challenges is the winner, while the player who\nused all their helper cards without completing a challenge is the loser.\n\nOnce 20 goal cards are completed, the game is over \u2014 that\u2019s it.\n\nMattel says the new protocols and scoring \u2014 no need to do math for each turn\u2014\nwill offer \u201cshorter games.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe game speaks to a trend in younger people who want to avoid competitive\ngames, instead favoring teamwork and collaboration working towards a fun goal\ntogether,\u201d Brett Smitheram, current UK number 1 and 2016 World Scrabble\nChampion, said in a statement.\n\n6\n\nThe helper cards \u2014 which provide help, prompts and clues \u2014 can be selected to\nmatch the player\u2019s challenge level of their choice. Mattel\n\n6\n\nScrabble Together is marketed for those who find the classic game to be\nintimidating. Mattel\n\n## \u2018Word games aren\u2019t for me\u2019\n\nA Mattel spokesperson told CNN that Scrabble Together will soon be available\nin Europe, but won\u2019t be available in the US since it doesn\u2019t hold licensing in\nAmerica. Hasbro produces Scrabble in the US and Canada.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have any plans for an update in the US, we love the idea of\ndifferent ways to play Scrabble and continue to attract new players to the\ngame around the world,\u201d a Hasbro spokesperson told The Post.\n\nScrabble, which is one of the world\u2019s best-known board games, has been around\nsince 1938 and has added hundreds of new eligible words to its dictionary as\nthe years have gone on. But, until now, the board has stayed the same all\nthese years. The change comes ahead of National Scrabble Day on April 13.\n\n\u201cScrabble is one of the world\u2019s best-known word games, bringing people\ntogether over a board for over 75 years. The way we use words is constantly\nevolving and so is Scrabble, which is why the iconic game has created a second\nside to the board that is collaborative and faster-paced to make gameplay more\naccessible,\u201d Mattel said in a press release.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nNew research found that almost half of Scrabble players have tried to make up\na new word to try to win a game, and 75% of Scrabble players aged 25-34 have\nhad to look up whether or not a word is real.\n\n\u201cWe play the original game, but change is inevitable,\u201d Brandreth said.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * board games\n  * gen z\n  * mattel\n  * 4/9/24\n\nRead Next How to take a picture of the solar eclipse with your phone\n\n#### Top Concerts\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post Get seats.
