Sure, they now carry more\nsafety tech, but the big yellow bus with the bulbous front end has endured\nsince 1939. It turns out, it\u2019s not lack of imagination or nostalgia that have\nkept school buses constant, but standardized guidelines that have proven\nincredibly effective in keeping American children safe. As a result, school\nbuses are one of the safest vehicles on the road. The standardized guidelines\nthat require school buses to be painted in their classic yellow and black\ntheme, have big flashing lights, and fold-out stop signs have made school\nbuses immediately recognizable to everyone on the road, and drivers know to\ndrive carefully around big yellow people movers.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nEPA Will Pay Schools to Ditch Diesel-Powered Buses\n\nThis Gorgeous School Bus RV Conversion Looks Nicer Than Some Houses, But Is It\nWorth $33,500?\n\nToyota Unveils The Sixth Generation 4Runner\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nToyota Unveils The Sixth Generation 4Runner\n\nPrior to 1939, there were no standardized requirements for school buses. As\ncars rapidly came into popularity, school children went from riding to school\nin horse drawn carriages called school wagons, to hitching rides on the newly\nmotorized school bus, though school bus was a generous term. These wood-bodied\ntrucks looked more apt to carry livestock than precious children. There were\nno safety standards for these buses, so some kids had to climb up into the\nback of the high riding bus, and on-road catastrophes were more frequent.\nStill, school buses were important as they allowed children in rural towns\nacross America to gain reliable access to education, though of course since\nthis is America, Black students were discriminated against and subjected to\nsegregated school transport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nEPA Will Pay Schools to Ditch Diesel-Powered Buses\n\nThis Gorgeous School Bus RV Conversion Looks Nicer Than Some Houses, But Is It\nWorth $33,500?\n\nToyota Unveils The Sixth Generation 4Runner\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nToyota Unveils The Sixth Generation 4Runner\n\nIn 1939, Frank Cyr, a rural education specialist at Columbia University, led a\nconference of transportation officials, school bus manufacturers and educators\nto establish the minimum standards for school buses. These standards included\nlength, aisle width requirements, and school buses\u2019 signature yellow color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: junkyardsparkle/ WIki Commons (Fair Use)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Modern school buses are governed by the National Congress for School\nTransportation or NCST, which sets standardized requirements for school\ntransportation services across the country. School bus safety requirements\ninclude a back-up alarm, anti-lock brakes, standardized emergency exits, and\naccommodations for wheelchair accessibility.\n\nBuses are required to be constructed to withstand an intrusion force equal to\nthe curb weight or 20,000 pounds, whichever is less. Since school buses are so\nbig and heavy especially when loaded with passengers, school buses usually\nfare very well in accidents. Despite the lack of a seat belt requirement,\nlarger school buses have been designed using an NHTSA-approved concept called\ncompartmentalization which requires the interior of buses to protect children\nwith strong closely-spaced seats with energy absorbing seatbacks. Small school\nbuses with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less must be\nequipped with seat belts since they are lighter than larger buses. Despite\ntheir antiquated looks, modern school buses are actually incredibly safe, 70\ntimes safer than a normal car according to the National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdministration or NHTSA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccident statistics show that only 71 passengers were killed in school bus\ncrashes over a nine year period between 2008 and 2017, and that figure\nincludes more than 26 million daily school bus riders across the country.\nAmerican school buses are also kept safe before an accident occurs thanks to\ntheir signature standout yellow color, flashing lights, and stop signal, all\nrequired by National School Transportation Specifications and Procedures.\nThese required features help school buses stay safe since American drivers\nknow to be extra mindful around vehicles with these immediately recognizable\nsigns. Smaller buses are required to have seat belts to keep students safe in\nthe event of an accident due to their smaller size and increased vulnerability\n\nThough modern school buses might not immediately appear much different than\nthe big yellow buses that ferried our grandparents to school houses in the old\ntimey days, important safety features and hidden engineering continue to make\nschool buses the safest form of on-road transportation. Thanks to the clear\nvisual indicators that make school buses stand out from other vehicles on the\nroad and carefully engineered safety features, school buses just haven\u2019t had\nto change much over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Ben Schumin/ WIki Commons (Fair Use)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
