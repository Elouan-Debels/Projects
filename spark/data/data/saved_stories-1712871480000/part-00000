Customize configurations for scalable and high-performance RPC\nrequests, accessing a multitude of features using a single RPC endpoint,\nstreamlining efficient blockchain interactions.\n\nThis Smart RPC Load Balancer simplifies regional load balancing for RPC-driven\napplications. Our simple and easy to use dashboard allows you to quickly add\nfault tolerance to your application in as few as 2 steps.\n\nBy directly offering reputable providers like QuickNode and your preferred\ncustom RPC providers, we streamline the distribution of RPC requests across\nnumerous nodes.\n\nOur Smart RPC Load Balancer bolsters reliability by automatically routing\nrequests to active RPC endpoints with the highest block height, ensuring\nuninterrupted service delivery. This proactive approach minimizes downtime,\nproviding you with a dependable RPC workload experience.\n\nAdditionally, our load balancer optimizes regional distribution and caching\nbased on blockchain block times, resulting in latency, efficiency and overall\nsystem performance.\n\n### Getting Started\n\n### You must login to the Backpac Dashboard to obtain a Backpac Endpoint and\nAPI Key\n\n  * Provision multiple QuickNode endpoints of the same Blockchain Network.\n\n> These endpoints will be load balanced across. Each endpoint will be added to\n> the default target group automatically.\n\n  * Login into the Backpac dashboard to get an API Key and Backpac endpoint.\n\n> For QuickNode users, Backpac automatically configures two default\n> application API Keys.\n\n  * Example Endpoint: https://ethereum-mainnet-mr.qn.backpac.xyz/{APPAPIKEY}\n\n  * Just start using the endpoint provided by Backpac for your RPC request.\n\n> The Backpac endpoint will load balance RPC request across the provisioned\n> QuickNode endpoints.\n\n  * (optional) Add additional RPC node provider endpoints.\n\n### Endpoint & API KEY\n\n##### Application API Key\n\n  * API KEY: The key to authenticate request.\n\n  * HTTPS: The protocol of the endpoint.\n\n  * HTTPS | API KEY: The application endpoint and API Key.\n\n#### eth_getTransactionByHash\n\neth_getTransactionByHash Returns the information about a transaction from a\ntransaction hash. Below is an example using a Backpac endpoint and application\nAPI Key.\n\n    \n    \n    var myHeaders = new Headers(); myHeaders.append(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\"); var raw = JSON.stringify({ \"method\": \"eth_getTransactionByHash\", \"params\": [ \"0xb1fac2cb5074a4eda8296faebe3b5a3c10b48947dd9a738b2fdf859be0e1fbaf\" ], \"id\": 1, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" }); var requestOptions = { method: 'POST', headers: myHeaders, body: raw, redirect: 'follow' }; fetch(\"https://ethereum-mainnet-mr.qn.backpac.xyz/{APP_API_KEY}\", requestOptions) .then(response => response.text()) .then(result => console.log(result)) .catch(error => console.log('error', error));\n\n#### API Key types:\n\n  1. Direct: A primary endpoint with failover to a target group of multiple RPC Endpoints. **Best for the lowest latency. When you provision multiple QuickNode endpoints. They will be added to the default target group.\n\n  2. Rules: The target group is selected based on the listener rules evaluated for the Blockchain Network. By default, only a direct rule is created.\n\n##### Select an application to view the endpoint and API Key.\n\n#### Supported Chains\n\nArbitrum\n\narbitrum\u2010mainnet, arbitrum\u2010goerli, arbitrum\u2010sepolia\n\nAvalanche\n\navalanche\u2010mainnet, avalanche\u2010testnet\n\nBase\n\nbase\u2010goerli, base\u2010mainnet, base\u2010sepolia\n\nBNB Smart Chain\n\nbsc, bsc\u2010testnet\n\nEthereum\n\nmainnet, ropsten, ethereum\u2010goerli, kovan, ethereum\u2010sepolia, rinkeby,\nethereum\u2010holesky\n\nGnosis\n\nxdai\n\nImmutable zkEVM\n\nimx\u2010testnet, imx\u2010mainnet\n\nOptimistic Ethereum\n\noptimism, optimism\u2010goerli, optimism\u2010sepolia\n\nPolygon / MATIC\n\nmatic, matic\u2010testnet\n\nSolana\n\nsolana\u2010mainnet, solana\u2010devnet\n\nPublished on Sep 15, 2023\n\nSupport Website Support Email\n\n## Plans & features\n\nRedundancy - $149/month\n\n  * Redundancy - $149/month\n\n  * Velocity - $299/month\n\n  * Throughput - $599/month\n\n  * High Throughput - $1,199/month\n\nEnterprise Sales\n\nGet Started\n\nRedundancy\n\n$149.00/month\n\nVelocity\n\n$299.00/month\n\nThroughput\n\n$599.00/month\n\nHigh Throughput\n\n$1,199.00/month\n\nEnterprise\n\nContact us\n\nRedundancy\n\n$149.00/month\n\nGet Started\n\nUS Region\n\nEfficiently distribute RPC requests across the United States to minimize\nlatency for users making RPC requests.\n\nUp to 100 Request /sec\n\nSupports of up to 100 RPC requests per second and accommodates up to 5\nBlockchain Network Application keys, offering robust performance and\nversatility for your blockchain applications.Support for up to 2 Blockchain\nNetworks across Application keys.\n\nIntelligent RPC Method Routing\n\nOur intelligent RPC method routing system automates the selection of the right\nRPC node for specific calls, simplifying user configuration and enabling a\nsingle RPC endpoint for all blockchain interactions.
