Satellite intelligence has identified a pair of guided missile\ndestroyers and their escorts 200 nm (230 miles, 379 km) away. Command orders\nan immediate missile strike.\n\nMore Stories\n\n3D Printing\n\nSmart 3D printer tunes itself to build with unfamiliar materials\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nTwo patrolling F/A-18 Super Hornets launch an AGM-158C LRASM each. Meanwhile,\na US frigate fires two ship-launched variants from its vertical launch system.\nThe moment these four are airborne, they pick up their line-of-sight data\nfeeds and then additional data feeds from satellites and other aircraft to\nprovide the semi-autonomous machines with the latest information on their\ntargets.\n\nAlong the way, the four missiles enter a zone of intense electronic warfare.\nCommunications are jammed. GPS is knocked out. No more data comes in from\nCommand. For earlier systems, this would have been the end of the mission, but\nthe LRASMs switch to autonomous mode and update one another on how to continue\nthe mission.\n\nLRASM Test\n\nUsing their onboard navigation, the missiles close with the enemy ships, but\nunexpected hostile forces suddenly appear in their path. The missiles\nautomatically compute a new course and evade the threats as they continue to\nclose on their targets.\n\nOnce in visual range, the missiles assess the destroyers' defenses and\nescorts. They select the most vulnerable spots on the ships and the weakest\narea of the air defenses to penetrate. Flying in at wave-height altitude, the\nfour missiles evade the final close-in anti-missile batteries and strike with\ntheir 1,000 lb (450 kg) warheads, destroying or crippling the hostiles.\n\nThat, essentially, is what Lockheed Martin and the US Navy were working toward\nduring the 12th Integrated Test Event (ITE-12), of which few details were\nreleased. With sensor and weapon systems becoming increasingly more\nsophisticated and lethal, direct engagements between forces, even combat\naircraft, are becoming much rarer in peer-to-peer conflicts. As a result, many\nassets like warships have become more like weapon platforms and command\ncenters for launching long-range weapons at a range of hundreds of miles.\n\nArtist's concept of an LRASM closing on target\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nCurrently serving with the US Navy, the US Air Force, and the Royal Australian\nNavy, the AGM-158C LRASM is one such weapon. Though it's been in service since\n2018, it is still undergoing development to make it much more autonomous and\ncapable of acting as part of a team instead of one of a salvo.\n\nThe idea is to produce a long-range, winged missile that can be launched from\na B-1B bomber, an F-18 Super Hornet, an F-35 Tornado 2 Joint Strike Fighter,\nor ships or submarines equipped with vertical launch systems. Though it can\nreceive information from a command and control network, it can also act on its\nown or part of a missile team in areas that a hostile force might try to deny\nentry to. It can not only acquire its target and assess how to attack it, the\nmissile also has its own countermeasures and the ability to take evasive\naction as necessary.\n\n\"We have continued to invest in the design and development of LRASM\u2019s anti-\nsurface warfare capabilities to ensure that war-fighters have the 21st century\nsecurity solutions they need to complete their missions and come home safely,\"\nsaid Lisbeth Vogelpohl, LRASM program director at Lockheed Martin Missiles and\nFire Control. \"This event was a testament to our commitment to deliver\nreliable products that work each and every time, ensuring those who serve stay\nahead of ready.\"\n\nSource: Lockheed Martin\n\nView gallery - 8 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.
