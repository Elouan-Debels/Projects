The\nofficial description for the new character reads, \"A wandering lich who seeks\nto bind the forgotten corpse. Calls up on her trusty left hand, Osty in\ncombat.\"\n\nIn addition to the trailer, Mega Crit included several gameplay screens, which\nare stylistically quite similar to the previous game. Check them out below.\n\nFirst released in 2019, Slay the Spire earned itself a large fanbase with its\ninnovative combination of roguelite mechanics, turn-based combat, and\ndeckbuilding. In our original review we wrote, \"[Slay the Spire] encourages\nexperimentation, gives you time to make mistakes, and will challenge you\nimmensely as you navigate your way through floor after floor of entertaining,\npuzzle-like fights. It\u2019s an idea so good that it\u2019s inspired a dozen games like\nit before it even left early access, but is executed so well that none of them\neven come close to matching it.\"\n\nNotably, Mega Crit was one of the developers to vocally condemn Unity's short-\nlived install fee policy, threatening to migrate to a new engine unless\nUnity's changes were \"completely reverted.\" A Mega Crit representative\nconfirmed that Slay the Spire 2 has since fully migrated off Unity and will\ninstead use Godot \u2014 a free and open-source cross-platform engine.\n\nSlay the Spire 2 is enter early access sometime in 2025. You can find all of\nthe biggest game release dates for 2024 right here.\n\nKat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.\nHave a tip?
