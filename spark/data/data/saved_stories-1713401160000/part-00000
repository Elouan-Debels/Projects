The sale comes exactly three years\nafter the digital artist Beeple sold a work of digital art through the same\nauction house for $69 million.\n\nIt\u2019s a development that would have likely caught the attention of the 20th-\ncentury philosopher and cultural critic Walter Benjamin. Benjamin was deeply\ninterested in the interplay between technology and culture, and how each\nshapes the other. In Benjamin\u2019s era, the technologies in question were\nphotography and film. Today, they\u2019re the internet and AI.\n\nThanks for reading Li's Newsletter!

Where does the value of art lie in a time when\nit can be reproduced at scale? What is the relationship between an original\nwork of art and its copy? How does mass-reproduced art intersect with and\nimpact culture\u2014specifically, politics?\n\n21st-century technologies both extend and complicate Benjamin\u2019s arguments. The\nvery act of creation can now be digital\u2014eroding the entire concept of \u201cthe\noriginal.\u201d And with the advent of generative AI technologies, the line between\noriginal and copy, author and reproducer, and between reality and fiction, has\ngrown even more amorphous.\n\nThe blockchain brings new dimensions to the discussion on art's value,\nauthenticity, and relevance\u2014and a new resonance to Walter Benjamin\u2019s work.\nThrough ownership tracked via a blockchain, crypto returns the idea of\nprovenance and originality to digital art, restoring Benjamin\u2019s concept of the\n\u201caura.\u201d At the same time, crypto renews what Benjamin calls the \u201ccult value\u201d\nof art, particularly through rituals and traditions that arise from community\nownership. And in an era of increasing cultural and political atomization,\ntokens present new pathways for fostering community cohesion and collective\naction in ways that both echo and challenge Benjamin\u2019s ideas about the\nrelationship between art and politics. The result is a redefinition of the\nrelationship between art, technology, and culture in the 21st century.\n\n##\n\nI: Aura\n\nAn enduring question is: what is it about a work of art that makes it special?\nWhy do enthusiasts flock to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa, or spend millions\nof dollars on an original artwork when they could see or own physically\nidentical reproductions?\n\nThe answer seems to have its roots in the presence of the artwork\u2014its specific\nexistence, the thing that makes it unique from any other work. Benjamin has a\nword for this quality: the \u201caura,\u201d which he defines as an artwork\u2019s \u201cunique\npresence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens\nto be.\u201d For Benjamin, the aura is intimately tied to the authority and\nauthenticity of the work; in the age of mechanical reproduction, he argues,\nboth the authority and authenticity of art are under threat.\n\nBenjamin argues that mechanical reproduction erodes the idea of the aura. The\nconcept of the aura is only further complicated by digital (re)production. Art\ncritic Douglas Davis observes in his 1995 response to Benjamin, digital\nreproduction makes it so that \u201cthe fictions of \u2018master\u2019 and \u2018copy\u2019 are now so\nentwined with each other that it is impossible to say where one begins and the\nother ends.\u201d\n\nCrypto has a unique ability to restore the concept of the aura to art, because\nit makes it possible again to talk about an \u201coriginal.\u201d By tracking an artwork\non a distributed ledger, crypto traces the provenance and ownership of a\ndigital asset. This ensures that each digital artwork is uniquely owned and\nauthenticated, able to be traced back to its creator\u2019s cryptographic\nsignature, thereby reimbuing digital work with an aura.\n\n##\n\nII: Value\n\nMany think about the value of art in economic terms. But Benjamin is equally,\nif not more, concerned with the cultural value of art, which he separates into\ntwo distinct axes: cult value and exhibition value.\n\nThe concept of exhibition value is relatively straightforward. It\u2019s the value\nof an artwork for its ability to be displayed and viewed in public spaces,\nmuseums, galleries, and exhibitions.\n\nCult value\u2014which Benjamin refers to as the \u201coriginal use value\u201d of art\u2014refers\nto something more specific and, arguably, more interesting.\n\nFor much of human history, art was intimately connected with religion and\nritual. There was something mystical and mysterious about engaging with\nartworks in sacred spaces. \u201cThe work of art in prehistoric times [...] was,\nfirst and foremost, an instrument of magic,\u201d he writes. Even in a more secular\nsense, art has served as a conduit for expressing and embodying deeply held\ncommunal beliefs, values, and narratives, whether religious, ideological, or\nphilosophical.\n\nBenjamin suggests that, like the aura, the \"cult value\" of art has waned over\ntime, giving way to the modern capitalist concept of \"exhibition value\"\u2014that\nart exists in and of itself, encapsulated by the phrase \u201cart for art\u2019s sake.\u201d\nThe digital age has accelerated that process. Artworks are often evaluated and\nappreciated solely for their ability to be seen: the more likes or views\nsomething has, the more valuable it is. At the same time, the consumption of\nart has become increasingly individualistic, with consumers engaging with art\nin isolation, rather than through communal experiences.\n\nHere again, crypto provides a counterbalance. Crypto has the potential to\nrevive the idea of cult value, albeit with a distinctly online twist. Just as\ntraditional art was once intimately connected with communal rituals and\nbeliefs, crypto projects create a sense of belonging and shared identity among\ntheir holders. NFT projects like Bored Ape and Botto (a collectively governed\nAI artist) and even memecoins\u2014which could be regarded as a form of crypto\nart\u2014have their own rituals, languages, and distinct shared spaces online. That\nset of rituals may carry an economic valence, which is one dimension of the\ncommon interests among their communities. Crypto art is deeply participatory\nin nature, allowing individuals to directly engage with, contribute to, and\nshape the cultural significance of these projects, reinforcing their cult\nvalue.\n\n##\n\nIII: Politics\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to read Benjamin in a purely pessimistic light, as bemoaning the\nloss of the aura and the ritual value of art in the face of mechanical\nreproduction. But beneath this apparent lamentation lies a more nuanced\nexploration of the transformative political potential inherent in the\ndemocratization of art.\n\nBenjamin sees mechanical reproduction as a profoundly democratizing force. He\nrefers to a \u201ctremendous shattering of tradition\u201d and a \u201ccontemporary crisis\nand renewal of mankind\u201d that is \u201cintimately connected with contemporary mass\nmovements.\u201d In a world where the aura of art has deteriorated and exhibition\nvalue has replaced cult value, Benjamin argues that the meaning of art becomes\ngrounded in something else: specifically, politics. He uses the example of a\nphotographer in Paris, photographing the streets \u201clike the scene of a crime,\nstating that photographs \u201cbecome standard evidence for historical occurrences,\nand acquire a hidden political significance.\u201d Iconic images can be politically\nsignificant, galvanizing action.\n\nBenjamin, a staunch socialist, points out that photography, \u201cthe first truly\nrevolutionary means of reproduction,\u201d arose \u201csimultaneously with the rise of\nsocialism,\u201d drawing a direct line between photography\u2019s ability to democratize\nart and socialism\u2019s promise to democratize politics. For example, photography\nin the Great Depression drew attention to the plight of workers in ways that\nbuilt momentum for projects that supported workers. The politicization of art\ncan also be profoundly dangerous\u2014as a Jewish man living in Fascist Germany,\nBenjamin was deeply concerned with the ways art could be co-opted by\ntotalitarian movements to hijack and manipulate attention and perception for\ntheir own agendas (see: Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s Triumph of the Will).\n\nThe age of digital reproduction has given us some extreme examples of art\u2019s\npolitical implications. For example, there is the proliferation of memes\nsurrounding the campaign and presidency of Donald Trump (some issued by him\ndirectly). Meanwhile, the advent of artificial intelligence and the rise of\ndisinformation and deep fakes undermine our shared sense of reality.\n\nWith regards to how crypto intersects with art in the political arena, there\nare several vectors that intersection can take. Crypto can be profoundly\nliberatory in an economic sense, as it allows for more accessible ownership\nfrom a larger set of participants, and enables financial gains from that\nownership. As I recently wrote about the attention economy in crypto, \u201cThe\ndifference [between crypto] vs. web2 is that everyone in the value chain can\nbenefit from being owners of \"attention assets\" -- whether they originated the\nmeme/media or merely paid attention early.\u201d\n\nThe censorship-resistant nature of blockchains also protects artistic\nexpression from suppression. During the COVID lockdowns in China, netizens\nuploaded videos and messages onchain that had been taken down from social\nmedia platforms by censors, using NFTs as a tool of political resistance. And\nas I\u2019ve mentioned, crypto is intensely participatory, incentivizing the\ncreation of communities around shared values and enabling novel forms of\ncapital formation that could be leveraged toward political aims. For example,\nin January 2023, Pussy Riot\u2019s Nadya Tolokonnikova and artist Shepard Fairy\nencouraged supporters to express their \u201cproof of protest\u201d through an open-\nedition NFT collection called Putin\u2019s Ashes, where the proceeds were donated\nto Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nUltimately, crypto art\u2014and crypto in general\u2014present a tool for community\ncoordination and capital formation, which has political implications. Just\nlike the web2 internet leveled information access and creation, mobilizing\nmillions of people, crypto \u2013 including crypto art \u2013 presents a tool for\neconomic coordination and community formation. Unlike in Benjamin\u2019s era, where\naudiences were largely passive consumers, they now have the opportunity to own\nand engage actively with these assets.\n\n##\n\nConclusion\n\nThe story of the intersection of art and culture is a story of evolution and\nadaptation. It encompasses the diverse ways in which artistic expression\nreflects, shapes, and responds to cultural values, societal norms, and\ntechnological advancements. As for how crypto will impact that story, that\u2019s a\nchapter that\u2019s still being written.\n\nBenjamin observes that the \u201csuperstructure\u201d\u2014the realm of art, culture,\npolitics, and society\u2014takes time to catch up to changes in the means of\nproduction (technology). Whereas painting is an artistic tradition that\nstretches back over millennia, digital means of artistic production measure\ntheir age in decades, and crypto is younger still. It will take time for the\ncultural and political implications of crypto to fully manifest.\n\nFor Benjamin, art represented a site of resistance and transformation, capable\nof challenging dominant power structures and sparking social change. The\nintegration of blockchain into the art world presents new opportunities for\nartists, collectors, and communities to engage in new ways. As these\ntechnologies continue to evolve, they have the potential to revolutionize not\nonly the art market but also the broader cultural and political landscape in\nways that, for now, we can only imagine.\n\nThanks for reading Li's Newsletter!
