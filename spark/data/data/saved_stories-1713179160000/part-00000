Within three years of the first hydropower project at\nan English inventor\u2019s home in 1878, there was an electricity plant at Niagara\nFalls, and soon many more around the world. For most of the 20th century,\nhydroelectricity was the only carbon-free power source, eventually providing\nover 90% of the electricity for a dozen smaller countries. Even into the 21st\ncentury, hydro was helping us keep ahead of our climate budgets. In 2022,\nChina\u2019s dams alone generated 1300 terawatt hours of electricity\u2014enough to\npower the entire world in 1950.\n\nBut the 1950s are now in the history books. As the world\u2019s appetite for\nelectricity has grown exponentially, hydropower\u2019s share of global energy\nproduction has slumped, amid growing concerns over their safety and\nenvironmental impact. Dams generated 20% of the world\u2019s power in 2010, but\nonly 15% today.\n\nHere we ask, can anything stop hydropower\u2019s slide?\n\n###### Source: International Energy Agency\n\n#### \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n#### Damned If We Do\n\n1\\. We\u2019re running out of mountains. According to the International Energy\nAuthority, new hydropower additions peaked in 2013, with only China, India and\nTurkey now having major projects on their roadmaps. Unlike solar and wind\nfarms that can be sited widely (and even offshore), hydropower requires very\nparticular terrain and water flow to operate. Switzerland has already dammed\n88% of its suitable rivers, with Mexico, Norway, Sweden and France close\nbehind.\n\n2\\. We\u2019re running out of snow. Severe drought conditions in Brazil, the US,\nChina and Turkey meant that global hydropower output in 2021 declined for the\nfirst time in two decades. A big part of the problem is that even if overall\nprecipitation is unchanged, a warming climate means more falls as rain than\nsnow. Over the first three months of 2023, hydro power generation in the snow-\nfed European Alps was 21% below that of the year before, and a shocking 38%\nunder the average for the previous decade, reports Reuters.\n\n###### Source: Reuters, 2023\n\n3\\. We\u2019re running out of ecosystems. According to a 2022 survey by Chinese\nscientists, nearly as much freshwater is lost to evaporation from reservoirs\nas is consumed by the world\u2019s cities. Dams also prevent the natural flow of\nmigratory species and sediment. In 2019, Stanford researchers concluded that\nbuilding out the Mekong River\u2019s hydropower potential would accelerate coastal\nerosion, risking putting the entire Mekong Delta below sea level, displacing\nmillions of people and more than 50% of Vietnam\u2019s rice production. Nor are\ndams true climate heroes\u2014methane production in the world\u2019s reservoirs\ncontributes the equivalent of roughly 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide a year, or\n1.3% of all greenhouse gasses produced by humanity.\n\n#### \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n#### Damned If We Don\u2019t\n\n1\\. We don\u2019t need rivers. Countries that have maxed out their mountain ranges\ncan benefit from a new generation of hydropower systems that use pumped\nstorage to augment or replace flowing rivers. These use cheap or surplus\nelectricity from solar and wind farms to pump water uphill, then generate\npower from it flowing back down when needed. That reduces the need for back-up\nfossil fuel power stations. Governments around the world are supporting pumped\nhydropower research and systems, with one research firm predicting it could\nbecome a $650 billion global market within ten years.\n\n2\\. We don\u2019t need more concrete. Thousands of US dams built for irrigation or\nflood control could be upgraded to generate gigawatts of electricity,\naccording to this readable in-depth report by E360 at Yale University. E360\nquotes Shannon Ames, who leads the Low Impact Hydro Institute, a nonprofit\nthat assesses the environmental impacts of hydropower: \u201cOne, there\u2019s potential\nfor more hydropower at existing dams. And two, there is no need to build a new\ndam.\u201d\n\n3\\. We don\u2019t need a new grid. Floating solar panels on reservoirs could give\nexisting dams a new lease on life, and ease powerline bottlenecks. Reservoirs\nare safe, engineered environments to deploy photovoltaics, which can also\nleverage transmission infrastructure already in place. According to scientists\nat the US Department of Energy, hybrid hydro-solar facilities around the world\ncould generate over 10,000 terawatt hours of electricity every year\u2014up to 40%\nof global electricity demand.\n\n#### \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n#### What To Keep An Eye On\n\n1\\. AI dam designers. The complexity of choosing what type of dam to build for\nthe most power and the least environmental harm is mind-boggling. Engineers\nhave to juggle everything from sediment transport and flow regulation, to fish\nbiodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions, coming together in billions of\npossible combinations. Cornell University researchers think that AI might be\nable to help. They have developed a computational model for dam design that\nthey claim can help policymakers make the optimal decision for dam\nplacement\u2014with the best trade-offs giving up to four times more power than the\nworst.\n\n2\\. Tracking dams from space. The worst thing that can happen to a dam for\npower generation, human welfare, and the environment is a catastrophic\ncollapse, such as happened in Russia last week. But new technology can help.\nResearchers can now use public radar data from European satellites to track\nmillimeter-sized changes in dams almost daily, and for years at a time. These\ncould provide valuable early warnings of dams at risk of failure, particularly\nthose in warzones or other disaster areas.\n\n3\\. Dams going down, dams going up. The majority of US dams are more than 50\nyears old, with the nation losing around 100 every year as moves to breach\naging dams and restore natural river flows increase. Meanwhile, Indian\nscientists writing for the Global Water Forum calculated that hydropower could\nreliably and economically contribute nearly twice what it does today if\ndeveloping countries can accelerate their adoption. The IEA estimates that\nAfrica and Asia have harnessed only about 5% of their potential hydropower\nresources.\n\n###### Top image \u00a9Anthropocene Magazine\n\nOur work is available free of charge and advertising.
