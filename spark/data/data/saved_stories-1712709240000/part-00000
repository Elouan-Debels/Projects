When the announcement was made, he wiped a tear from his eye, but told\njournalists: \"It's very nice to be right sometimes.\"\n\nThe head of Cern, Fabiola Gianotti, told BBC News that \"Peter was a very\nspecial person, an immensely inspiring figure for physicists across the world,\na man of rare modesty, a great teacher and someone who explained physics in a\nvery simple and yet profound way.\"\n\n\"I am very saddened, and I will miss him sorely,\" she said.\n\nAlan Barr, Professor of Physics at University of Oxford, paid tribute to the\nhuge impact Higgs had on our understanding of the Universe.\n\n\"He proposed the existence of a field that pervades the entire universe, from\nmass to particles from electrons to top quarks.\"\n\n\"He was also a true gentleman, humble and polite, always giving due credit to\nothers, and gently encouraging future generations of scientists and scholars,\"\nhe added.\n\nInside the atom-smasher\n\nPallab Ghosh goes inside the largest particle accelerator in the world - which\ndiscovered the Higgs boson.\n\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer\n\nPhysics\n\nEdinburgh\n\nNobel Prize\n\nRelated\n\n## The hunt for physics' mysterious 'ghost' particles\n\n25 Mar 2024\n\nScience & Environment\n\n## Frozen antimatter may reveal origins of Universe\n\n22 Feb 2024\n\nScience & Environment\n\n## New atom-smasher could spark physics revolution\n\n5 Feb 2024\n\nScience & Environment\n\nMore\n\n1 day ago\n\n## Father and son blowtorch murderers jailed for life\n\nIan and Dean MacLeod were given 34 years in prison, which are among the\nlongest sentences issued in Scotland .\n\n1 day ago\n\nEdinburgh, Fife & East\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Pilot makes 'extraordinary' landing in storm winds\n\nGary Wilkinson, 61, captured footage of the nail-biting Cessna approach at\nEdinburgh Airport.\n\n2 days ago\n\nEdinburgh, Fife & East\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Pilot's 'extraordinary' landing in Storm Kathleen\n\nA passenger video captures the nail-biting landing at Edinburgh Airport during\nhigh winds.\n\n2 days ago\n\nScotland\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Dad to honour late son with gruelling bike ride\n\nSimon Lambert wants to raise money in memory of his son Archie, who loved to\ncycle.\n\n3 days ago\n\nEssex\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Five-try Edinburgh ease past Bayonne into quarters\n\nEdinburgh run in five tries to see off Bayonne and reach the European\nChallenge Cup quarter-finals.\n\n3 days ago\n\nScottish Rugby\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
