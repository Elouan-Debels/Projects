A trademark protects a\ncompany or individual\u2019s unique name or design that applies to a specific\napplication. You can even trademark sounds or smells. But there are only so\nmany names and designs you can come up with, so there is the possibility of\nconsumer confusion. When a company or an individual wants to register a new\ntrademark, the USPTO needs to review the application and then search this vast\narchive to make sure the applicant\u2019s trademark doesn\u2019t conflict with another\ntrademark already in use.\n\nBut how do you search for a swoosh, a mermaid wearing a crown or a cartoon\ntiger? To solve this problem, the UPSTO devised a system of 1,400 numeric\n\u201ctrademark design codes'' that describe each trademark. A trademark might have\nseveral of these codes representing different elements of the trademark. The\nnumbering system is a clever hierarchical system to create a taxonomy for all\nthe many weird things that might be in a logo.\n\n## Rickshaws, Centaurs and Mechanical Women\n\nI downloaded some of the massive files from the USPTO\u2019s research datasets of\ntrademarks to explore how these design codes are used. These design codes\ncover an incredibly wide range of things, and many of them are delightful. You\nwill find design codes for \u201cTri-cornered hats\u201d, \u201cEmus\u201d, \u201cBall bearings\u201d,\n\u201cRickshaws\u201d, \u201cCentaurs\u201d, \u201cMechanical women\u201d, \u201cScottish men and other men\nwearing kilts\u201d and \u201cWinged human heads, feet, shoes or other parts\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s look at one example of a design code. Code number 03.21.07 is used for\n\u201cTerrapins; Tortoises; Turtles; Turtles, tortoises\". In this case, the first\ntwo digits represent the category of \u201cAnimals\u201d. The second pair of digits\nrepresents division 21 in that category which is \u201cAmphibians and reptiles,\nincluding frogs, snakes, lizards, and turtles\u201d. The last two digits \u201c07\u201d is\nfor \u201cTerrapins, Turtles, Tortoises\u201d.\n\nFor example this trademark featured an illustration of a tortoise with wings,\nso in addition to \u201cTurtles; Terrapins; Tortoises\u201d it also was tagged with\n03.17.01 - \u201cWings of birds, shown alone or as part of something other than\nassociated animal; Bird wings shown alone or as part of something other than\nassociated animal\u201d.\n\nBut the taxonomy of trademarks is a different beast than the taxonomy of\nanimals we are familiar with, and things quickly get weird. In addition to\nthat turtle code, there\u2019s also:\n\n  * 03.21.24: \u201cStylized amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, snakes, lizards, and turtles\u201d and\n  * 03.21.26: \u201cCostumed amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, snakes, lizards, and turtles, and those with human attributes\u201d.\n\nThese codes are chosen and applied manually by the USPTO staff reviewing\ntrademark applications. And because there are often many different elements of\na trademark, several different codes may be needed to correctly classify the\ncontents of the trademark.\n\nApplicants get to review the design codes assigned to their application and\nrevise them if necessary. \u201cWe've assigned these design codes to your trademark\nand the applicants themselves will have an opportunity to say, well, actually,\nit's not an elf, it's a troll or whatever it is. So could you please code that\nappropriately?\u201d explained Jason Lott, Managing Attorney for Trademarks\nCustomer Outreach at the USPTO in an interview with Beautiful Public Data.\n\n## Popular Pairs \ud83d\udc6f\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe most frequently used design codes are just descriptions of shapes. For\nexample the most often used design code is pretty broad: 26.01.21: \u201cCircles\nthat are totally or partially shaded\u201d which was applied to 280,356 trademarks\nin the files I analyzed.\n\nThe least used code I found is much more specific: 11.05.07: \"Can openers\n(electric); Can openers, electric; Electric can openers; Openers, can,\nelectric\" which was applied to three trademarks.\n\nThe average number of design codes applied to a trademark is about 3, but one\nexceptionally busy trademark has 105 design codes, and when you see the image\nyou understand why.\n\nTrademark #87321574 \u2013 The G.O.A.T. with 105 assigned trademark design codes.\n\nBrowsing the collection of trademarks through pairs of design codes is a\nparticularly interesting way to explore this dataset. When it comes to logos\nof American companies, certain pairs of design elements appear together\nfrequently. There\u2019s plenty of EAGLES and SHIELDS, AMERICAN FLAGS and RIFLES,\nand DOGS with SUNGLASSES. There are also quite a few AMERICAN INDIANS with\nARCHERY BOWS and PIGS with CHEF\u2019S HATS. (If these links don't work, view this\nstory in your browser)\n\nI built an interactive widget to let you explore some of the more whimsical\npairings of design codes. \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\n## From Paper to Databases\n\nThe current system was put in place decades ago, but has evolved over time.\n\n\"The design code system that we have right now really started to come about in\nthe 1980\u2019s when they started to transition away from paper. Back at that time\nwhen you were going through a paper stack, they would be sorted appropriately\naccording to design, sometimes by registration number,\" explained Lott. As the\nimages in trademarks began to contain more elements, this system was not up to\nthe task. \"What if you have something that has a tree and it has an elf? What\nwould you do with that?\" said Lott.\n\nBrowsing through some of the design codes, I was struck by how some of them\nsounded...a little old. For example there are references to \u201cfrankfurter\nsandwiches\u201d, \u201ctypewriter ribbons\u201d, \"hobos\" and \u201cdunce caps\u201d. Likewise it would\nbe hard to imagine any trademark in 2024 including \u201cwashboards\u201d, \u201cinkwells\u201d,\n\u201csoup tureens\u201d, \u201cflash bulbs\u201d,\u201ctelephone booths\u201d, \u201cadding machines\u201d, or\n\u201cpocket watches.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udfc6\n\nIf you like this story and want to show your support, become a member or send\na one-time pay-what-you-want tip.\n\nLott explained that sometimes a company's trademarked logo was created in\nanother era. \u201cWe have trademarks that are well over 100 years old\u201d and that\nsometimes these old sounding codes are still relevant. \u201cYou're still gonna be\nusing some of those terms because it might be that there's a Bavarian woman\n[in the trademark].\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to updates of the design code system, USPTO spokesperson\nChristina Whitaker told me in an email that the USPTO will \u201ccontinue to make\nrevisions, as well as work to make the ability to update the systems more\nstreamlined.\u201d Whitaker said that changes to the design codes system are made\nby \u201ca standing committee composed of supervisory attorneys\u201d and that suggested\nadditions or revisions come from two sources. \u201cFirst, applicants and other\nexternal stakeholders ask questions or propose changes from time to time, and\nmay be considered the first line reflecting evolving trends in the\nmarketplace. Second, Trademarks has a large corps of examining attorneys as\nwell as paralegal specialists who use the design code system on a daily\nbasis.\u201d\n\nChanges to reflect changing technology are considered as well. \u201cAdditions are\nmost needed as new products emerge and establish ubiquity: toy drones and\ntablet computers jump to mind, for example,\u201d said Whitaker.\n\nIn addition to adding or removing items from the code system, sometimes broad\ncategories are broken down to provide more specificity. Whitaker explained,\n\u201cWe recently revised some codes of animal designs to create separate groups\nfor felines, canines, equines, and bovines, where these had in some codes been\npreviously grouped together\u201d.\n\n## A Perfect Use Case for AI?\n\nThinking about this problem of describing an image with words immediately made\nme think that the new wave of AI tools might be a perfect use case for this\nsystem. When I asked Lott about the potential of AI being used to\nautomatically describe trademarks, he was cautious in his response. Lott said\n\u201cI can neither confirm nor deny any upgrades to our trademark search system.\nHowever, that sounds like a really great use of technology.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nDid you enjoy this post?
