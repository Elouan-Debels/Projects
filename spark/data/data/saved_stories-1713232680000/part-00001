The 15 fraud charges filed against\neach of the Hallfords carry potential penalties of 20 years in prison and\n$250,000 in fines, according to the indictment.\n\nThe Hallfords did not have attorneys listed yet for the federal charges.\n\nMichael Stuzynski, the attorney representing Carie Hallford on state charges\ndeclined to comment on the case over the phone. Jon Hallford\u2019s attorney for\nstate charges works for the public defenders office, which does not comment on\ncases.\n\nThe couple have not yet entered pleas to the state\u2019s abuse of corpse charges.\n\nEven before the new indictment was unsealed, public records revealed that the\nHallfords had been plagued by debt, facing evictions and lawsuits for unpaid\ncremations even as they spent lavishly.\n\nThe indictment alleges the couple used the $882,300 in pandemic relief funds\nto buy items for themselves, including cars, vacations, dinners, tuition for\ntheir child, cryptocurrency, cosmetic procedures and jewelry. They carried out\nthe fraud and obtained three loans from March 2020 to October 2021, the\nindictment alleges.\n\nAdditionally, the couple took in another $130,000 from families paying for\ncremations and burial services they never provided, the indictment says.\n\nPreviously released court documents from the abuse of corpse case reveal more\ndetails about how they spent the money.\n\nThey bought a GMC Yukon and an Infiniti that together were worth over $120,000\n\u2013 enough to cover cremation costs twice over for all of the bodies found in\ntheir business\u2019s facility last October, according to previous court testimony\nfrom the FBI agent Andrew Cohen.\n\nThey also paid for trips to California, Florida and Las Vegas, as well as\n$31,000 in cryptocurrency, laser body sculpting and shopping at luxury\nretailers such as Gucci and Tiffany & Co, according to court documents.\n\nBut they left in their wake a trail of unpaid bills, disgruntled landlords and\nunsettled business disputes.\n\nOnce, the couple claimed to a former landlord that they would settle their\nrent when they were paid for work they had done for the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency during the coronavirus pandemic. The business\u2019s website\nfeatured logos for Fema and the Department of Defense.\n\nFema has said they did not have any contracts with the funeral home. A defense\ndepartment database search also showed no contracts with the funeral home.\n\nIn 2022, the company failed to pay more than $5,000 in 2022 property taxes at\none of their locations, public records show. Then last year, the business was\nslapped with a $21,000 judgment for not paying for \u201ca couple hundred\ncremations\u201d, according to public records and Lisa Epps, attorney for the\ncrematory Wilbert Funeral Services.\n\nThe new federal charges are the latest example of the owners\u2019 alleged lies,\nmoney laundering, forgery and manipulation over the past four years,\ndevastating hundreds of grieving families.\n\nThe discovery of the 190 bodies last year, some that had languished since\n2019, left families to learn their loved ones were not in the ashes they were\ngiven by the funeral home. Instead, they were decaying in a bug-infested\nbuilding about two hours south of Denver.\n\nAn investigation by the Associated Press found that the two owners probably\nsent fake ashes and fabricated cremation records. They appear to have written\non death certificates given to families, along with ashes, that the cremations\nwere performed by Wilbert Funeral Services, which denies performing them for\nthe funeral home at that time.\n\nWhen the decomposing bodies were identified in the funeral home\u2019s facility,\nfamilies learned that the ashes they held could not have been the remains of\ntheir loves ones.\n\nAs far back as 2020, there were concerns raised about the business\u2019s improper\nstorage of bodies. But there was no follow-up by regulators, letting the\ncollection of bodies grow to nearly 200 over the following three years.\n\nColorado has some of the most lax regulations for funeral homes in the\ncountry. Those who operate them do not have to graduate high school, let alone\nget a degree in mortuary science or pass an exam. The case has pushed\nlawmakers to introduce bills bringing the rules in line with most other\nstates, even surpassing some.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Colorado\n  * US crime\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
