The $5 billion mission is\ndesigned to find out if Europa, Jupiter\u2019s fourth-largest moon, can support\nlife. But because Europa is constantly bombarded by intense radiation created\nby Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, the Clipper spacecraft can\u2019t orbit the moon\nitself. Instead, it will slide into an eccentric orbit around Jupiter and\ngather data by repeatedly swinging by Europa \u2014 53 times in total \u2014 before\nretreating from the worst of the radiation. Every time the spacecraft rounds\nJupiter, its path will be slightly different, ensuring that it can take\npictures and gather data from Europa\u2019s poles to its equator.\n\nTo plan convoluted tours like this one, trajectory planners use computer\nmodels that meticulously calculate the trajectory one step at a time. The\nplanning takes hundreds of mission requirements into account, and it\u2019s\nbolstered by decades of mathematical research into orbits and how to join them\ninto complicated tours. Mathematicians are now developing tools which they\nhope can be used to create a more systematic understanding of how orbits\nrelate to one another.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is the previous computations that we\u2019ve done, that guide us as\nwe do the current computations. But it\u2019s not a complete picture of all the\noptions that we have,\u201d said Daniel Scheeres, an aerospace engineer at the\nUniversity of Colorado, Boulder.\n\n\u201cI think that was my biggest frustration when I was a student,\u201d said Dayung\nKoh, an engineer at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \u201cI know these orbits are\nthere, but I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Given the expense and complexity of missions to\nthe moons of Jupiter and Saturn, not knowing why orbits are where they are is\na problem. What if there is a completely different orbit that could get the\njob done with fewer resources? As Koh said: \u201cDid I find them all? Are there\nmore? I can\u2019t tell that.\u201d\n\nAfter getting her doctorate from the University of Southern California in\n2016, Koh grew interested in how orbits can be cataloged into families. Jovian\norbits that are far from Europa form such a family; so do orbits close to\nEuropa. But other families are less obvious. For instance, for any two bodies,\nlike Jupiter and Europa, there is an intermediate point where the two bodies\u2019\ngravitational effects balance to create stable points. Spacecraft can orbit\nthis point, even though there is nothing at the center of the orbit. These\norbits form a family called Lyapunov orbits. Add a little energy to such an\norbit by firing a spacecraft engine, and at first you\u2019ll stay in the same\nfamily. But add enough, and you\u2019ll cross over into another family \u2014 say, one\nthat includes Jupiter inside its orbits. Some orbit families might require\nless fuel than others, remain in sunlight at all times, or have other useful\nfeatures.\n\nDayung Koh, an engineer at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is trying to come\nto a systematic understanding of how orbits in a planetary system relate to\none another.\n\nCourtesy of Dayung Koh\n\nIn 2021, Koh came across a paper that discussed how to grapple with chaotic\norbits from the perspective of symplectic geometry, an abstract field of math\nthat is generally far removed from messy real-world details. She started to\nsuspect that symplectic geometry might have the tools she needed to better\nunderstand orbits, and she got in touch with Agustin Moreno, the author of the\npaper. Moreno, then a postdoctoral fellow at Uppsala University in Sweden, was\nsurprised and pleased to hear that someone at NASA was interested in his work.\n\u201cIt was unexpected, but it was also quite interesting and sort of motivating\nat the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two began working together, seeking to apply Moreno\u2019s abstract techniques\nto the Jupiter-Europa system and to Saturn and its moon Enceladus, which, like\nEuropa, might have life in its underground ocean. In the past year, together\nwith other collaborators, they have written a series of papers that create a\nframework for cataloging orbits. In January, Moreno, now a professor at\nHeidelberg University, completed an early draft that turned his survey paper\ninto a book on the subject. With the book, he wants to make the abstract field\nof symplectic geometry useful to engineers who are trying to plan space\nmissions. If he succeeds, he will be reuniting fields of inquiry that have\ngrown apart over the centuries.\n\n## No Royal Road to Geometry\n\nSymplectic geometry has its roots in physics. To take a simple example,\nimagine a pendulum. Its motion can be described by two parameters: angle and\nspeed. If the speed is low enough, the pendulum will oscillate back and forth.\nIf the speed is higher, it will spin around in a circle. In an idealized\npendulum without friction, once you\u2019ve chosen a starting angle and speed, the\nsystem\u2019s behavior is determined for all time.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\nYou can create a graph with the angle as the x-axis and the speed as the\ny-axis. But since traveling 360 degrees brings you back to the start, you can\nsew together the vertical lines where x is zero degrees and where x is 360\ndegrees. This makes a cylinder. The cylinder doesn\u2019t directly reflect physical\nreality \u2014 it isn\u2019t showing paths that the pendulum traces \u2014 rather, each point\non it represents a particular state of the pendulum. The cylinder, along with\nthe laws that determine the paths the pendulum can follow, forms a symplectic\nspace.\n\nSince the early 17th century, when Johannes Kepler formulated his laws,\nphysicists and mathematicians have had a firm grasp on how to describe the\nmotion of two bodies subject to gravity. Depending on how fast they are\nmoving, their paths form an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola. The corresponding\nsymplectic spaces are more complicated than the one for a pendulum, but still\ntractable. But introducing a third object makes exact, analytic solutions\nimpossible to calculate. And it only gets more complicated if you add more\nbodies to the model. \u201cWithout that analytic insight, you\u2019re almost always, at\nsome level, shooting into the dark,\u201d Scheeres said.\n\nA spacecraft that can move freely in any direction \u2014 right to left, up and\ndown, and front to back \u2014 needs three coordinates to describe its position,\nand three more to describe its velocity. That makes a six-dimensional\nsymplectic space. To describe the motion of three bodies, like Jupiter, Europa\nand a spacecraft, you need 18 dimensions: six per body. The geometry of the\nspace is defined not only by the number of dimensions it has, but also by the\ncurves that show how the physical system being described evolves over time.\n\nMoreno and Koh worked on a \u201crestricted\u201d version of the three-body problem\nwhere one of the bodies (the spacecraft) is so small that it has no impact on\nthe other two (Jupiter and Europa). To simplify things further, the\nresearchers assumed the moon\u2019s orbit was perfectly circular. You can take its\ncircular orbit as a steady background against which to consider the space\nprobe\u2019s path. The symplectic space only has to account for the spacecraft\u2019s\nposition and velocity, since Jupiter and Europa\u2019s motion can be easily\ndescribed. So instead of being 18-dimensional, the corresponding symplectic\nspace is six-dimensional. When a path in this six-dimensional space forms a\nloop, it represents a periodic orbit of the spacecraft through the planet-moon\nsystem.\n\nWhen Koh contacted Moreno, she was curious about cases where adding just a\ntiny bit of energy causes a spacecraft\u2019s orbit to jump from one family to\nanother. These meeting points between families of orbits are called\nbifurcation points. Often many families will meet at a single point. This\nmakes them particularly useful to trajectory planners. \u201cUnderstanding the\nbifurcation structure gives you a roadmap as to where are there interesting\ntrajectories that you should look at,\u201d Scheeres said. Koh wanted to know how\nto identify and predict bifurcation points.\n\nAgustin Moreno, who works in the abstract field of symplectic geometry, has\nbeen turning his techniques to real-world problems.\n\nCourtesy of Dan Komoda/Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter hearing from Koh, Moreno enlisted a few other geometers: Urs\nFrauenfelder of the University of Augsburg, Cengiz Aydin of Heidelberg\nUniversity, and Otto van Koert of Seoul National University. Frauenfelder and\nvan Koert had long studied the three-body problem using symplectic geometry,\neven uncovering a potential new family of orbits. But though engineers\nplanning spacecraft missions have used a myriad of mathematical tools, in\nrecent decades they\u2019ve been daunted by the increasing abstraction of\nsymplectic geometry.\n\nThroughout the following months, the engineer and the four mathematicians\nslowly learned about one another\u2019s fields. \u201cIt takes a while when you\u2019re doing\ninterdisciplinary work to, let\u2019s say, get over the language barriers,\u201d Moreno\nsaid. \u201cBut after you\u2019ve done the patient work, it starts paying off.\u201d\n\n## The Toolkit\n\nThe team put together a number of tools which they hope will be useful to\nmission planners. One of the tools is a number called the Conley-Zehnder index\nthat can help determine when two orbits belong to the same family. To\ncalculate it, researchers examine points that are close to \u2014 but not on \u2014 the\norbit they want to study. Imagine, for instance, that a spacecraft is\nfollowing an elliptical orbit around Jupiter, influenced by gravity from\nEuropa. If you nudge it off its path, its new trajectory will imitate the\noriginal orbit, but only crudely. The new path will spiral around the original\norbit, coming back to a slightly different point after it circles Jupiter. The\nConley-Zehnder index is a measurement of just how much spiraling goes on.\n\nSurprisingly, the Conley-Zehnder index doesn\u2019t depend on the specifics of how\nyou nudge the spacecraft \u2014 it\u2019s a number associated with the entire orbit.\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s the same for all orbits in the same family. If you compute\nthe Conley-Zehnder index for two orbits, and you get two different numbers,\nyou can be sure that the orbits are from different families.\n\nAnother tool, called the Floer number, can hint at undiscovered families of\norbits. Suppose several families collide at a bifurcation point when the\nenergy hits a particular number, and several more families branch out from\nthat bifurcation point when the energy is higher. This forms a web of families\nwhose central hub is the bifurcation.\n\nYou can calculate the Floer number associated with this bifurcation point as a\nsimple function of the Conley-Zehnder indexes associated with each relevant\nfamily. You can compute this function both for all the families that have\nenergy just a bit smaller than the bifurcation point and for families whose\nenergy is larger. If the two Floer numbers differ, that\u2019s a clue that there\nare hidden families linked to your bifurcation point.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is providing tools against which engineers test their\nalgorithms,\u201d Moreno said. The new tools are primarily designed to help\nengineers understand how families of orbits fit together and to prod them to\nlook for new families where warranted; it\u2019s not meant to substitute for the\ntrajectory-finding techniques that have been honed over decades.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### In the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of Geometry, Mathematicians Redefine the Sphere\n\n  2. ### Mathematicians Transcend Geometric Theory of Motion\n\n  3. ### How Physics Found a Geometric Structure for Math to Play With\n\nIn 2023, Moreno presented the work to a conference organized by the \u201cSpace\nFlight Mechanics Committee,\u201d and he has been in contact with engineers who\nresearch space trajectories, including some at JPL and Scheeres\u2019 lab at\nBoulder. Scheeres welcomed the intermingling of fields: He had long known\nabout the symplectic approach to planetary motion, but felt out of his depth\nmathematically. \u201cIt was really exciting to see the mathematicians trying to\nbring their expertise down into the engineering side,\u201d he said. Scheeres\u2019\ngroup is now working on a more complex system involving four bodies.\n\nEd Belbruno, a trajectory planning consultant (and former JPL orbital analyst)\nwho has worked with Frauenfelder, cautions that the applications are not\ndirect. \u201cAlthough a mathematical technique such as symplectic geometry can\ncome up with trajectories which are really cool, and you get a whole slew of\nthem, it may be that very, very few, if any, satisfy the constraint\u201d that a\nreal mission might need, he said.\n\nThough the Clipper trajectories are already largely settled, Moreno is looking\nto the next planet: Saturn. He has already presented his research to mission\nplanners at JPL who hope to send a spacecraft to Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus.\nMoreno hopes that symplectic geometry will \u201cbecome part of the standard space\nmission toolkit.\u201d\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nContributing Correspondent\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\napplied mathgeometrymathematicsphysicsplanetary sciencesymplectic geometryAll\ntopics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Mathematics\n\ngeometry\n\n### Number of Distances Separating Points Has a New Bound\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n1\n\nRead Later\n\nalgebraic geometry\n\n### Merging Fields, Mathematicians Go the Distance on Old Problem\n\nBy Erica Klarreich\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\n3\n\nRead Later\n\napplied math\n\n### Topologists Tackle the Trouble With Poll Placement\n\nBy Lyndie Chiou\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
