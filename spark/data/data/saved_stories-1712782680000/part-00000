The vapour was evidence of plumes similar to the ones on Saturn\u2019s moon\nEnceladus. That, and other compelling evidence, showed that the moon has an\nocean. That led to speculation that the ocean could harbour life.\n\nBut the ocean is obscured under a thick, global layer of ice, making the\nplumes our only way of examining the ocean. The plumes are so difficult to\ndetect they haven\u2019t been confirmed.\n\nThe lead author of the paper presenting Hubble\u2019s 2013 evidence is Lorenz Roth\nof Southwest Research Institute. He said, \u201cBy far, the simplest explanation\nfor this water vapour is that it erupted from plumes on the surface of Europa.\nIf those plumes are connected with the subsurface water ocean we are confident\nexists under Europa\u2019s crust, then this means that future investigations can\ndirectly investigate the chemical makeup of Europa\u2019s potentially habitable\nenvironment without drilling through layers of ice. And that is tremendously\nexciting.\u201d\n\nIt is, but first, scientists have to find the plumes.\n\n\u201cWe pushed Hubble to its limits to see this very faint emission. These could\nbe stealth plumes because they might be tenuous and difficult to observe in\nvisible light,\u201d said Joachim Saur of the University of Cologne, co-author of\nthe 2013 paper.\n\nThis artist\u2019s illustration shows plumes erupting through Europa\u2019s icy surface.\nGigantic Jupiter lurks in the background. Image Credit: NASA/ESA/K.\nRetherford/SWRI\n\nDescribing them as tenuous stealth plumes turned out to be prophetic.\n\nRecently, a team of researchers went looking for the plumes. Their results are\nin a presentation given to the IAU Symposium 383 titled \u201cALMA Spectroscopy of\nEuropa: A Search for Active Plumes.\u201d The lead author is M.A. Cordiner from the\nSolar System Exploration Division at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\n\u201cThe subsurface ocean of Europa is a high-priority target in the search for\nextraterrestrial life, but direct investigations are hindered by the presence\nof a thick exterior ice shell,\u201d the authors write. The researchers used ALMA\nto search for molecular emissions from atmospheric plumes. They were\ninvestigating processes under the ice that could help them understand Europa\u2019s\nocean and its chemistry.\n\nThe Solar System is full of icy bodies, including comets, Kuiper Belt Objects,\ndwarf planets, and moons like Europa. Europa has a high density compared to\nother icy bodies, indicating a substantial rocky interior. Its ocean makes up\nabout 10% of the moon and is covered by an icy shell of uncertain thickness.\nIt could be several tens of kilometres thick. Scientists learned much of this\nfrom NASA\u2019s Galileo mission.\n\nIn recent years, Europa and its ocean have leapt to the top of the list of\ntargets in the search for life. The reasons aren\u2019t obscure: liquid water is an\nirresistible beacon in our search for habitable places. The plumes from\nEuropa\u2019s ocean are our only way to study the ocean and its potential\nhabitability.\n\nThis illustration shows what the interior of Europa might look like.

They\u2019ve found potential intermittent plume activity\nnear the moon\u2019s south pole. But confirmation of the plumes the Hubble spotted\nin 2013 is elusive. In 2023, the JWST examined Europa. Those observations\n\u201cfound no evidence for active plumes, indicating that any present-day activity\nmust be localized and weak; robust confirmation of the initial HST plume\nresults also remains challenging,\u201d the authors write.\n\nIn an attempt to find the plumes, the authors employed ALMA, the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array. They observed Europa on four separate days to\ncover the moon\u2019s surface. Unfortunately, they found no plumes.\n\nThese are four ALMA images of Europa. The researchers observed the moon on\nfour different days so they could image almost the entire surface. They found\nno plumes. Image Credit: Cordiner et al. 2024.\n\n\u201cDespite near-complete coverage of both Europa\u2019s leading and trailing\nhemispheres, we find no evidence for gas phase molecular absorption or\nemission in our ALMA data,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cUsing ALMA\u2019s unique\ncombination of high spectral/spatial resolution and sensitivity, our\nobservations have enabled the first dedicated search for HCN, H_2CO, SO_2 and\nCH_3OH in Europa\u2019s exosphere and plumes. No evidence was found for the\npresence of these molecules.\u201d\n\nFinding no evidence doesn\u2019t quite mean that those molecules aren\u2019t there.\nRather, it means that if they are there, their concentrations are so low\nthey\u2019re below the detection threshold. In this case, some concentrations would\nbe lower than those detected in Enceladus\u2019 plumes, which are confirmed.\n\nOne chemical in particular illustrates this point: CH_3OH (methanol.) \u201cFor the\nCH_3OH abundance, on the other hand, our ALMA upper limit of < 0.86% would not\nhave been sensitive enough to detect this molecule at the Enceladus plume\nabundance of 0.02%,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThere are some interesting relationships between Europa and other icy objects\nin the Solar System. It has to do with abundance limits. The researchers\nestablished upper limits for H_2CO (formaldehyde) on Europa. \u201cIndeed, our\nH_2CO abundance upper limit is significantly lower than measured by Cassini in\nthe Enceladus plume, implying a possible chemical difference.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that it didn\u2019t find any plumes, the observations were still\nvaluable. By setting detection limits it helps subsequent efforts to search\nfor them. And this won\u2019t be scientists\u2019 final attempt at finding plumes.\nAnything that provides clues to Europa\u2019s ocean is too tantalizing to ignore,\nand this research shows that ALMA is suited to this type of investigation.\n\n\u201cOur results show that ALMA is a powerful tool in the search for outgassing\nfrom icy bodies within the Solar System and that follow-up searches for other\nmolecules at additional epochs (on Europa and other icy bodies) are\njustified,\u201d the researchers conclude.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategoriesEuropa, Science, WaterTagsALMA Observatory, chemistry, Europa,\ngeysers, Hubble, plumes\n\n## One Reply to \u201cIf Europa has Geysers, They\u2019re Very Faint\u201d\n\n  1. James Franklin says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 5:57 AM\n\nPerhaps the water vapour detected in 2013 is the result of ionising radiation\neffects on the ice, liberating water molecules that are then trapped by the\ngravity of Europa, further, plumes that were detected could be the result of\nlocalised micrometeoritic activity or even bodies of a larger size \u2013 such as\npebbles to few meter sized boulders.\n\nJupiter captures significant material, a lot of this must impact the moons of\nthe planet, especially the Galilean worlds.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
