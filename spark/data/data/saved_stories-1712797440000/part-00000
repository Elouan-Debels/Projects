But the Fairbuds have arrived, and Fairphone\nhas made them in its phones' image. They're only available in the EU at the\nmoment, for 149 euro (or roughly $160 USD). Like the Fairphone 4, there's a\nchance interest could bring them to the US.\n\nThe highlights include:\n\n  * Seven replaceable parts from the buds and charging case, all sold by Fairphone\n  * A two-year warranty, expanded to three if you register them\n  * Batteries in both the case and buds that are replaceable\n  * IP54 sweat and water resistance\n  * Individual left or right buds and a charging case that Fairphone will sell to you\n  * Made with \"fair and recycled materials,\" in \"fair factories,\" and \"climate conscious and electronic waste neutral,\" (as explained by Fairphone).\n\nOf course, the buds also, you know, produce sound, with 11 mm titanium\ndrivers. The Fairbuds sport active noise-canceling and ambient sound modes,\nBluetooth 5.3 with \"dual point connectivity\" for quick-switching between\ndevices, and a Fairbuds app for customizing EQ and preset settings. The buds'\n45 mAh batteries carry about six hours of listening per charge, and their 500\nmAh case adds another 20 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * Fairbuds in exploded view.\n\nFairphone\n\n  * Fairbuds and their charging case, which also come in black.\n\nFairphone\n\n  * The battery removal process from a Fairbud.\n\nFairphone\n\n  * Closeup on the white Fairbuds.\n\nFairphone\n\n  * The back of the Fairbuds charging case and a battery you just... put into it. With your fingers. I'm sorry, it's weird to type that now.\n\nFairphone\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nIt's not Fairphone's first foray into fair, repairable sound devices. The firm\npreviously made the since-discontinued True Wireless Stereo Earbuds and still\noffers Fairbuds XL, which are not buds at all but full over-ear headphones\n(and also EU-only).\n\nThe best that major-brand earbuds have ever done in repairability is \"maybe\nyou can do it, if you're careful, and you don't mind losing water resistance.\"\nTaylor Dixon took apart six buds for iFixit back in 2020, and only Sony's\nWF-1000XM3 didn't require soldering, cutting and re-applying glue, and a\nsteady hand working in very small spaces.\n\nAirPods? AirPods are something else. One firm, The Swap Club, has figured out\nsome means of getting the battery out of AirPods and selling them refurbished.\nBut they only accept regular AirPods, not AirPods Pro. Alternatively, Apple\nwill send you a pre-paid label to send in your spent AirPods for recycling,\nthough with no trade-in credit. Even if Apple gets some kind of material out\nof the AirPods, a lot of them (and nearly every other wireless earbud) end up\nas waste after 18 months or however long their batteries last.\n\nFairbuds may or may not take a big chunk out of the market for AirPods, Beats,\nPixel Buds, or other use-and-toss airbuds. But at a minimum, they give people\nsomething to point to as proof this category could be a lot better.\n\nDisclosure: Kevin Purdy used to work for iFixit.
