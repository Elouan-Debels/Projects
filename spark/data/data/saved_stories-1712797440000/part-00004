Together with University of Turku\u2019s research group\nTurkuNLP and HPLT, Silo AI releases the first checkpoints of Viking, an open\nLLM for all Nordic languages, English and programming languages. Viking\nprovides models that are not only linguistically performant and inclusive, but\nalso sensitive to local values and cultures. Evaluations indicate best-in-\nclass performance in all Nordic languages, without compromising performance in\nEnglish. Viking is an enhanced model family of the previous model Poro, and is\nfurther evidence of the novel approach to train LLMs for low-resource\nlanguages, with an intent to train state-of-the-art LLMs for all official EU\nlanguages.\n\nFollowing the completion of the language model Poro, Silo AI\u2019s generative AI\narm SiloGen and TurkuNLP of University of Turku are now releasing the first\nmodel checkpoints for Viking \u2013 a family of models for the Nordic languages.\nViking relies on the same training approach as Poro, focusing on low-resource\nlanguages without compromising English, but extends to include Danish,\nEnglish, Finnish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Swedish and programming languages. And\nthe model family comes with an updated and more modern architecture and in a\nvariety of model sizes.\n\nThis effort is part of Silo AI's broader strategy to empower linguistic\ndiversity across the continent and further enhance LLM capabilities in low-\nresource languages. By utilizing the latest advancements in multilingual LLMs,\nSilo AI and TurkuNLP are working to create models that are not only\nlinguistically performant and inclusive, but also sensitive to local values\nand cultures, ensuring that the technology serves as a bridge rather than a\nbarrier in digital communication.\n\nThe completion of Poro and release of Viking function as the first steps in\nSiloGen\u2019s efforts to train state-of-the-art LLMs for all official EU\nlanguages. This indicates that the initiative tailored for a wider European\naudience is on track and resulting in performant models. It builds Europe\u2019s\ndigital infrastructure, facilitating the widespread adoption of LLM-based\nproducts and applications and allowing for innovation in a broad range of\nsectors and use cases across Europe.\n\n## Viking checkpoint performance: 50% of training and 1000B tokens\n\nAfter the first ten Viking checkpoints, covering 50% of training and 1000B\ntokens, we can observe preliminary evidence of outperformance with respect to\nother open models (e.g. Falcon, GPT-SW3, Llama, Mistral, MPT, StarCoder etc).\nResults indicate best-in-class performance in low-resource languages vis-\u00e0-vis\nother open models, without compromising performance in English and programming\nlanguages. In our latest evaluations, Viking is evaluated on a large number of\nrelevant measures, including translated tests, MMLU, Arc-C, HellaSwag etc.\nWhile translated tests are commonly used (e.g. to prove multilinguality of\nMistral Large) and provide indicative evidence, they don't fully capture the\nmultilingual reasoning capabilities of language models. Another measure,\nperplexity, further corroborates Viking\u2019s performance. Overall, Viking not\nonly showcases its adeptness at understanding and generating Nordic languages\nbut also highlights its efficiency in processing and predicting linguistic\nsequences. This dual advantage indicates the viability of the approach to\ntrain multilingual models, and Viking's technological edge in navigating the\ncomplexities of multilinguality.\n\n## Viking 7B, 13B and 33B: A modern architecture with more languages\n\nBelow is a summary of key features of the Viking model family covering\nEnglish, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic and code. For\ntransparency with respect to model architecture, data and other technical\ninformation, please refer to the official model card (Viking 7B, Viking 13B,\nViking 33B).\n\n  * Research Checkpoints: While the first release includes five checkpoints for the models, further checkpoints are released throughout the training process, providing transparency on the model training process.\n  * Model architecture: Viking uses an architecture similar to Llama 2, with flash attention, rotary embeddings, grouped query attention and supports a 4k sequence length\n  * Model sizes: 7B, 13B and 33B parameters\n  * Multilingual capabilities: The models are designed to process English and Nordic languages, and have proficiency with a variety of programming languages. Additionally, they can perform basic translation between English and Nordic languages.\n  * Dataset: The model family is trained with a dataset of 2 trillion tokens, including Danish, English, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish and a variety of programming languages represented.\n  * Open source: The model family is freely available under the Apache 2.0 License, implying applicability for both commercial and research use.\n  * Training hardware: Our models are trained using up to 1024 AMD MI250X GPUs on the LUMI supercomputer in Finland.\n\n## Considerations for Use\n\nThe intended audience for Poro Research Checkpoints is academic and industry\nresearch. These checkpoints are not suitable for deployment in a production\nuse case without further training, fine-tuning and testing.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank the operators of the LUMI/EuroHPC supercomputer for\ncomputational resources and technical support, including AMD, HPE and CSC \u2013\nthe IT Center for Science, Finland. TurkuNLP researchers have received funding\nfrom the European Union\u2019s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme\nHigh Performance Language Technologies (HPLT) under grant agreement No\n101070350.\n\n## About\n\n### Silo AI\n\nSilo AI is Europe\u2019s largest private AI lab on a mission to ensure Europe has a\nflagship AI company.
