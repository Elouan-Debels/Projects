The project was located in New York City. Thirty-seven volumes of\ntables for trigonometric functions, exponentials, logarithms, and so on were\nproduced.\n\nAfter a long search, Arnold Lowan, who taught math and physics at Yeshiva\nUniversity and Brooklyn College was identified to lead the project. Lowan was\na Romanian who immigrated to the US fleeing anti-Semitic pogroms.\n\nOne of Lowan\u2019s first recruits was Gertrude Blanch, who was a student in his\nnight course on relativity at Brooklyn College. He noticed that Blanche\u2019s\nassignments were of much higher quality than his other students. In fact, she\nalready had a PhD in mathematics. She was unable to find professional\nemployment as a mathematician and was trying to maintain her math skills. She\nwould serve as the chief mathematician on the project.\n\nNBS supported Lowan, Blanch and a small group of mathematicians to run the\nproject and provided funds for facilities and equipment. Only a small number\nof adding machines were obtained, all used, most of which had to be\nrefurbished. These were not used by the bulk of the project\u2019s \u201ccomputers,\u201d but\ninstead by the project leads for tasks such as computing initial values for\nthe computation and for verifying results.\n\nMost of the actual computations were done by human computers paid for by the\nWPA. The project grew to be the largest computing organization in the world,\nwith a staff of some 450 persons at its high point.\n\nGertrude Blanch\n\nCredit: NIST Portrait Gallery\n\nThe Planning Committee (led by Blanch) created algorithms for use of the\ncomputers who were given worksheets. The computers were largely unskilled.\nMost just did addition, fewer subtraction, fewer yet (1-digit) multiplication,\nand just 1-2 people did division. For example, the computers did not\nunderstand negative numbers, so a system of black and red pencils were used.\nSign on the wall said\n\n> Black + black = black\n>\n> Red + red = red\n>\n> Black + red or red + black: hand the sheets to Group 2\n\nEven though it continually produced high quality results, the project failed\nto gain much respect in the scientific community. The stigma associated with\nrelief work was very strong. Respect for the group increased when Cornelius\nLanczos, a Hungarian mathematician/physicist who had worked on relativity\ntheory with Einstein, became a member of the computation planning committee.\n\nLowan worked to promote the Math Tables Project as a general-purpose computing\noffice for the nation. He was moderately successful in generation additional\nwork.\n\nThe WPA terminated the project in early 1943, which led to downsizing and\nrelocation in NYC. Lowan worked hard to identify paid tasks associated with\nthe war effort to keep the project going. Some of those efforts included\nproducing additional tables of mathematical functions, such as Bessel, Struve,\nConfluent Hypergeometric Functions, but also tables for specialized\napplications such as LORAN tables (air navigation), ballistics tables, optimal\nbombing strategies to clear minefields, and even calculations for the\nManhattan Project (though participants did not know what they were computing\nfor such top-secret work).\n\nWhile the MTP remained funded by the Navy after the war, human computers were\nbeginning to lose the edge to automatic computers.\n\n### References\n\n  1.
