This enables\nbusinesses to have real-time and reliable access to data, which is of utmost\nimportance in this AI era. PeerDB\u2019s overarching vision is to become the de\nfacto standard for data movement and ETL (extract, transform and load) for\ncompanies that run their businesses on Postgres.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 April 11, 2024 \u2014PeerDB, the leading data movement platform for\nPostgreSQL, today announced it received $3.6 million in seed round funding.\nInvestors in the round include lead investor 8VC, Y Combinator, Wayfinder\nVentures, Webb Investment Network, Flex Capital, Rogue Capital, Pioneer Fund,\nOrange Collective and several angel investors.\n\nPeerDB will use the funds to continue building its engineering team,\npropelling its go-to-market and client acquisition initiatives and supporting\nits growth. PeerDB revenue is doubling every two months.\n\n\"Postgres is becoming the database of the world and the de facto primary\ndatabase for both enterprises and SMBs. Existing data movement and ETL tools\nare not built for Postgres \u2013 they often fail at scale due to painfully slow\nsyncs, lack of reliability and lack of native features. The time has come for\nsomeone to give enough care to the world's most adopted open source database.\nThanks to all our investors and customers for believing in us and sharing our\nvision,\" said PeerDB CEO and co-founder Sai Krishna Srirampur.\n\n\"At PeerDB, we're tackling inefficiencies surrounding Postgres data movement.\nWith fundamental optimizations like parallel snapshotting and handling the\nnuances around replication slots that are absent in the existing ETL tools,\nwe\u2019re focused on building a system specialized for Postgres at terabyte scale\n\u2013 our approach diverges from traditional methods that falter at scale and\nresort to resyncs. Our team of Postgres experts not only provides data\nmovement services but also becomes an essential part of client teams, offering\nadvice on database tuning and query optimization. As we brace for the influx\nof data driven by the era of LLMs, we're committed to ensuring Postgres data\nmovement remains efficient and scalable,\" said PeerDB CTO and co-founder\nKaushik Iska.\n\n## The Problem\n\nIn the current data and AI landscape, existing data movement and ETL (extract,\ntransform, and load) tools prioritize the breadth over the quality of\nconnectors and are not optimized for Postgres. Users often face issues such as\npainfully slow syncs \u2014 syncing hundreds of gigabytes of data can take days;\nunreliability, characterized by frequent crashes and loss of data precision;\nand feature limitations, including a lack of configurability and support for\nnative data types.\n\nPeerDB distinguishes itself by prioritizing the quality over the breadth of\nconnectors and tailoring its design specifically for Postgres. Through this,\nPeerDB offers 10 times faster data movement and at one-fifth the cost.\n\n## Why Now?\n\n\"8VC's investment in PeerDB is driven by our conviction in the exponential\ngrowth trajectory of Postgres. We see an exceptional team in Sai and Kaushik,\nwhose deep expertise in Postgres positions them uniquely in the marketplace.\nWe believe that a solid narrative around data movement and ETL will play a\npivotal role in the success and widespread adoption of Postgres,\" said Bhaskar\nGhosh, partner at 8VC.\n\nThe time is ripe to develop a first-class data movement tool for Postgres, as\nit is becoming the world's most popular database. Currently ranked fourth in\nthe DB-Engines Ranking of database management systems (DBMS) based on\npopularity, Postgres is the only DBMS in the top four experiencing growth. It\nalso received DB-Engines' DBMS of the Year 2023 award for gaining more\npopularity than any other of the 417 monitored systems in 2023. Enterprise\nadoption of Postgres is on the rise, with 50% of enterprise companies already\nusing it. This trend is set to significantly increase the volume of data\nstored and moved through Postgres, requiring an ETL tool that can handle this\nscale.\n\nThe introduction and funding of PeerDB is also timely due to the widespread\nfocus on artificial intelligence (AI) and hyperscale data analytics, which\noften require movement of massive datasets from primary database platforms\nsuch as Postgres to data warehouses for AI-based analytics to help provide\ninsights and inform business decisions.\n\n## PeerDB's Vision and Use cases\n\nPeerDB's vision is to become the de facto standard for data movement and ETL\nfor companies that run their businesses on Postgres, encompassing use cases\nsuch as:\n\n  * Fast and cost-effective replication to data warehouses: Replicate data from Postgres to analytical stores (OLAP) such as Snowflake, BigQuery and ClickHouse for AI-based analytics informing business decisions in use cases like fraud or anomaly detection. PeerDB has already made its mark here with a rapidly growing customer base that strongly challenges incumbents like Fivetran.\n\n  * Real-time streaming and change data capture: Low-latency replication from Postgres to queues, such as Kafka, enabling use cases like real-time alerting and micro services-based architectures. PeerDB already supports Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, and Google PubSub as targets, serving as an enterprise-grade alternative to Debezium.\n\n  * Database migrations: Migrating data from legacy databases like Oracle and SQL to Postgres to support modernization and digital transformation initiatives.\n\n  * Enterprise-grade Postgres high availability (HA) and backups: As enterprises modernize their database stack by migrating from Oracle and SQL Server to Postgres, managing HA and backups across regions and hybrid on-premises environments becomes critical. The infrastructure that PeerDB is developing can be extended to support such mission-critical use cases in the future.\n\n  * Vector ETL: Extracting unstructured data at scale, transforming it into vector embeddings with LLMs, and loading these into Postgres using pgvector. This enables semantic searches for advanced AI applications.\n\n## PeerDB is built for Postgres\n\nBelow are a few product differentiators of PeerDB:\n\n  * Faster Postgres data movement: PeerDB implements parallel snapshotting, the fastest way for moving Postgres data. This can dramatically reduce the time required to move massive datasets, often from days to hours, while ensuring consistency.\n\n  * Native Postgres data type support and replication: PeerDB specializes in natively replicating advanced data types like JSONB and geospatial, crucial for IoT apps and geospatial applications. With data available in native formats, users save the time and effort required for data transformation, since the data is already in the format necessary for their AI-based analytics and other applications.\n\n  * Cost optimizations: PeerDB can reduce data movement costs by up to five times compared to incumbent ETL tools. PeerDB published a white paper detailing the data modeling and infrastructure optimizations employed to save costs for customers.\n\n## Customers\n\nPeerDB customers include:\n\n  * Harmonic AI replaced an incumbent ETL solution with PeerDB, saving $80,000 yearly and reducing their yearly data-movement costs by five times.\n\n  * Expedock uses PeerDB to deliver real-time AI-driven supply chain automation, replicating 700 million rows monthly from Postgres to Snowflake with under one minute latency and five times cost savings compared to their previous ETL tool.\n\n  * Fiber AI uses PeerDB to replicate terabytes of data from Postgres to ClickHouse in real time, powering their real-time search use case.\n\n  * Flatiron Health used PeerDB to migrate 35,000 tables with terabytes of data from Postgres to Snowflake within a week.\n\n\"We\u2019re using PeerDB already for our Postgres to ClickHouse ETL and it\u2019s\ninsanely fast and accurate! We can\u2019t believe how well it works. The PeerDB\nteam has been super helpful in getting us set up, helping us debug, and\nadvising us on everything related to ClickHouse and Postgres. Great work,\nguys!\"**said Neel Mehta, CTO, Fiber AI.**\n\n## How to try PeerDB?\n\nYou can try PeerDB through one of three offerings: Open source, a fully\nmanaged cloud service and a self-hosted enterprise offering.\n\n## Founders\n\nThe co-founders of PeerDB, CEO Sai Krishna Srirampur and CTO Kaushik Iska,\nhave been friends since high school and were roommates in college at the\nInternational Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, where they both\nstudied computer science. Sai Krishna Srirampur was an early engineer at Citus\nData, which was acquired by Microsoft. There, he led solutions engineering for\nall Postgres services on Microsoft Azure.
