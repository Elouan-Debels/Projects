Most of what I say is based on Mortimer Adler's\nbook 'How to Read a Book', which I highly recommend to anyone who wants to get\nserious about reading. Aside from the four levels of reading, Adler's book\ngoes over the differences between reading fiction, different types of non-\nfiction (history, philosophy, etc.), and practical books.
