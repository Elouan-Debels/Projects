Watch this space, or follow us on social media (LinkedIn and Twitter) to\nstay updated.\n\nBefore we move on to all the powerful features that make the release, a quick\nnote on the supergraph architecture \u2013 a core concept in Hasura DDN.\n\n## Your data needs a supergraph!\n\n#\n\nThe modern-era enterprise data layer is increasingly diverse, polyglot, and\ncomplex. It's no longer just a database, but a collection of databases,\nservices, and APIs. This complexity has slowed productivity and innovation\nbecause, unfortunately, the API strategies have not evolved to meet this\ncomplexity.\n\nA supergraph is a powerful antidote to this data and API chaos. A supergraph\nis an architecture and operating model where all data \u2013 no matter the source \u2013\nis connected via a semantic graph, and exposed via a single composable\nendpoint.\n\nHead to supergraph.io to learn more about this architecture, see reference\narchitectures, and how it compares to other patterns like API gateways.\n\nHasura DDN brings the power of the supergraph to the masses by significantly\nlowering the effort and skills required to build and operate this powerful\narchitectural pattern.\n\nNow onto what we are dropping in Hasura DDN today!\n\n# What is Hasura DDN?\n\nHasura DDN is the next-generation Hasura API platform. Powered by a brand new\nHasura v3 engine, it delivers on many of the features the Hasura Community has\nrequested over the years, while also elevating everything you loved about the\ncurrent experience.\n\nHasura DDN makes supergraph a core concept in the product and delivers a\nworld-class product for building and operating supergraph \u2013 whether you are a\nteam of one developer or multiple domain teams.\n\nIn this first drop today, Hasura DDN delivers on this vision \u2013 starting with\nPostgreSQL!\n\n## Intuitive domain-centric supergraph modeling framework\n\n#\n\nWe believe domain modeling should be the foundation of a supergraph. We are\nintroducing a first-of-its-kind supergraph modeling framework that makes it\nintuitive to specify how multiple domains connect to form a unified semantic\ngraph. Hasura runtime engine uses the metadata to translate and execute an API\nrequest (more on that in the next section).\n\nThis domain-first approach has many advantages:\n\n  * Declarative: Strict and typed metadata contract provides a high correctness guarantee.\n  * Standardization: What you model is what you get, there\u2019s no drift between design and reality.\n  * Modularity: Each team can independently work on their part of the supergraph.\n\nSample modeling metadata and folder structure in DDN.\n\nThis metadata-driven approach is the fastest way to onboard a new domain onto\na supergraph, and it overcomes a big limitation with existing GraphQL-based\nsupergraph tooling that requires first building GraphQL servers to enable a\nsupergraph.\n\nPlus, the framework is data-source agnostic, making it easy to swap out the\nphysical data source backing a domain, without impacting the API layer. Learn\nmore here.\n\n## Unparalleled on-demand composability\n\n#\n\nIn a world where data is everywhere, developers should have APIs to access\njust the data they want, wherever that data lives.\n\nTo enable this, APIs need to become composable. Otherwise, the burden of\ncreating bespoke API endpoints for the various data \"compositions\" becomes\nuntenable.\n\nHasura\u2019s supergraph delivers unmatched on-demand composability \u2013 by simply\nmodeling your domains. Complex compositions like cross-domain joins, nested\nfiltering and sorting, etc. come for free. No resolvers, no hard-coded\naggregation, or BFFs needed. In a nutshell, your product development lifecycle\nis cut short significantly. Learn more here.\n\nSample Top N query, that you get out of the box with Hasura DDN.\n\n## Blazing-fast performance \u2013 for any query\n\n#\n\nComposability without performance is pointless.\n\nHasura DDN does multiple layers of optimization to deliver the best\nperformance in your API \u2013 for every query. The Hasura DDN query planner uses\nintelligent query sequencing, batching, and distribution techniques to\nmitigate common performance issues (like N+1) in GraphQL. The new console also\ndebuts a query plan explorer that shows you exactly how the query plan is\nexecuted.\n\nSample query plan for a deeply nested query across multiple subgraphs.\n\nThe native connectors, also new in Hasura DDN, are designed to leverage the\nnative strengths of the data source. For example, using the powerful features\nof PostgreSQL such as JSON aggregation functions and lateral joins to highly\noptimize the data fetch. The strength of the connector based model is that\nconnector authors can design and customize the query plan based on the unique\nqualities of the underlying data source.\n\nThis type of native optimization is not available in any other tool. API\ndevelopers need to (a) be experts in the database to know how to write the\nmost performant query for any operation, (b) actually code that query \u2013 a non-\ntrivial undertaking and (c)maintain and modify these queries as new client\nrequirements come in.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nThe autogenerated SQL by Hasura using PostgreSQL native JSON functions.\n\n## Rapid CI/CD with a new build system and build-time validation checks\n\n#\n\nDeveloper experience and delight have always been a core design principle for\nHasura. Hasura DDN delivers a superior developer experience across the full\nAPI build, test, and deploy lifecycle. This includes:\n\nA new build and release system, with instant API previews and rollback Every\niteration of the Hasura supergraph (changes to relations, permissions, data\nsources, etc.) is instantly available as an immutable build and testable via a\npreview API. Builds are instantly available no matter the size of the metadata\nor the committed change. This is a huge improvement over Hasura v2 where the\nbuild time was dependent on both factors.\n\nAny build can be instantly promoted to production (or rolled back) with zero\ndowntime.\n\nList of atomic builds that can be independently tested, and applied to the\nproduction environment.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nPre-commit validation Every change to the supergraph is validated before the\nbuild is started, helping users identify potential bugs, stylistic issues,\nsyntax, and type errors. This ensures an error-free build and preview API.\nBuild-time checks also ensure that changes in one part of the supergraph don't\nviolate the expected contracts with other parts of the supergraph.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nAn example of type error notification at the time of build creation.\n\nEnhanced observability and API analytics Hasura DDN brings significant\nimprovements to the observability and API analytics features, including field-\nand model-level usage dashboards and deeper end-to-end query tracing for each\nAPI call. Tracing features provide a full view of how the query traverses\nthrough the supergraph, letting you easily identify bottlenecks and debug\nfailure points.\n\nAnalytics provide insights into API consumption, providing helpful guidance\nwhen evolving the API.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nAn end-to-end API call trace traversing from the client to the engine to the\ndatabase.\n\nAll these capabilities enable rapid iteration, without fear of breaking\nchanges, and positively impact DORA metrics.\n\n## Brand new console, with better discovery and onboarding\n\n#\n\nHasura DDN unveils a brand new console with a modern look and feel. The new\nconsole debuts several new UI elements that elevate supergraph as a core\nproduct concept, and aid the discovery and onboarding onto the supergraph.\n\nSupergraph explorer A new supergraph explorer visually shows how everything\nconnects and is especially helpful as the supergraph evolves with new data and\nrelations. The console also features rich API documentation, enabling rapid\nonboarding of new API consumers onto the supergraph.\n\nSample supergraph visualizer in the Hasura console\n\nAPI Documentation: Easily navigate the complexity and diversity of your\nsupergraph with rich documentation available that provides ways to understand\nthe data models, reason about them, and see their real time usage. This\nbecomes the one place for your API collaborators and even consumers to\nunderstand the supergraph structure and apply in their applications and\nservices.\n\nShows the new model dashboard in the console with usage, field type and\nrelationships information.\n\n## Open and extensible connectors ecosystem\n\n#\n\nHasura DDN connectors are built on a new open native data connector (NDC) spec\nand are all open source! In previous iterations, non-PostgreSQL connectors\nwere only available in Hasura\u2019s paid commercial plans. In Hasura DDN, all\nconnectors are open source!\n\nWith today\u2019s launch, we introduced connectors for PostgreSQL, with more\nconnectors planned for this month. The new NDC framework and SDKs allow anyone\nto build new connectors more easily than v2, and enable us to launch new\nconnectors more rapidly!\n\nSee Connector Hub.\n\n## Global edge network for performance and reliability, at any scale\n\n#\n\nAlongside all the innovation on API authoring and consumption, Hasura DDN also\nlaunches a distributed serverless runtime infrastructure. A Hasura supergraph\nis instantly deployed on a multi-region edge network with edge routing to\nensure reliability and low latency for a global audience. A new sub-\nmillisecond cold start enables rapid autoscaling to deal with usage spikes.\n\n## Disruptive model-based pricing model\n\n#\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, Hasura DDN reveals an innovative pricing\nmodel that bills you based on the number of active models connected to your\nAPI, irrespective of how much the API is called. We believe this active model-\nbased pricing disrupts the traditional usage-based pricing paradigm by\nensuring that your costs match the value you get from your API platform.\n\nHasura DDN also includes a very generous forever free tier that enables indie\ndevelopers, and other single API developer setups, to use the product for free\nforever, irrespective of the scale of their application or their API load.\n\nYou can read more about the new pricing, and the philosophy behind it here.\n\nWith the release today, we are launching the Hasura DDN free tier, with Base\nand Advanced tiers following shortly after.\n\n## Get started today!\n\n#\n\nIt\u2019s a whole new product, and there\u2019s so much more to cover. But, like they\nsay, seeing is believing. Go experience the magic yourself.\n\n  * Try Hasura DDN\n  * Dive into the docs\n  * Give us feedback\n\nFor a limited time, we are doing hands-on supergraph consultation sessions and\njumpstarts to help businesses set up a supergraph going in just two weeks.\n\n  * Request a supergraph demo and jumpstart for your team.\n\nRahul Agarwal\n\nAsawari Samant\n\n04 Apr, 2024\n\n8 MIN READ\n\n###### Share\n\nBlog\n\n04 Apr, 2024\n\n###### Share\n\nRelated reading\n\nHasura Data Delivery Network\n\nAPI composability\n\n10 Apr, 2024\n\n17 MIN READ\n\n##### The future of API is composability\n\nThe ability to integrate and aggregate data on demand emerges as more crucial\nthan ever.
