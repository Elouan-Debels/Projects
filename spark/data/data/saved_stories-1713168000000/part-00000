MicroWriter ML 3 - The future of photolithography\n\nEdition 41 (1/2024)\n\n## MicroWriter ML 3 - The future of photolithography\n\nConventional photolithography is a process that uses a mask aligner to\ntransfer patterns from a chromium-glass mask onto a substrate coated with a\nphotoresist layer. This process has several limitations, including:\n\n  * Overlay accuracy is limited by the fixed pattern on the mask.\n  * Alignment with randomly distributed samples (often needed for research of 2D materials) is difficult because the pattern positions on the mask cannot be changed.\n  * Backside alignment is complex.\n  * Flexible or non-flat substrates are difficult to work with.\n\nThe MicroWriter ML 3 systems offer a solution to these obstacles. The system\nholds the design patterns in software and uses computer-controlled optics to\nproject the exposure patterns directly onto the photoresist. With this\nflexibility plus a simple and intuitive Windows user interface, the overlay\nprocedure (with an overlay accuracy down to +/- 0.5 \u03bcm) can be easily achieved\n(Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1: Vernier pattern and alignment marks on a 6 inch wafer, created with\nthe MicroWriter ML 3, show that the overlay accuracy can be as good as +/- 0.5\n\u03bcm.\n\nFig. 2: Exposure with \u201cVirtual Mask Aligner\u201d software: (a) A designed pattern,\nput on a sample before exposure, and (b) the exposed and developed sample.\n\nFig. 3: Real time microscope image of (a) a camera on the top and (b) a camera\non the backside of the MicroWriter ML 3.\n\nAlignment with randomly distributed samples can be performed using the\nsoftware tool \u201cVirtual Mask Aligner\u201d (Fig. 2). Users can locate their samples\nand then digitally superimpose the design pattern with their sample in real\ntime before the exposure. For the backside alignment, the MicroWriter ML 3 can\nbe equipped with a backside alignment camera, which can feed in a real-time\nmicroscope image. (Fig. 3) It can also be used to expose a variety of\ndifferent substrates, including diamond or liquid polymer. (Fig. 4)\n\nFig. 4: Exposure results of various substrates with the MicroWriter ML 3.\n\nThe MicroWriter ML 3 is a compact, powerful, and affordable direct-write\noptical lithography device that offers unprecedented value for money. It has a\nlow cost of ownership, with long-life, solid-state light sources and low\nmaintenance requirements. It also has an excellent environmental footprint:\nPower consumption of the device is comparable to that of a laptop.\n\nMore about Photolithography systems\n\nback\n\n### Contact\n\nStephane Struyve\n\nSales Manager\n\n+32 495 79 71 75  \n---  \nWrite e-mail  \n  \nStephane Struyve\n\n### Register\n\nNewsletter registration\n\nNavigation\n\n  * Service\n  * News\n  * Events\n  * About us\n\nCategories\n\n  * Magnetism\n  * Materials science\n  * Spectroscopy\n  * Imaging\n  * Electron microscopy\n  * Cryogenics\n  * Optics\n  * Light & lasers\n  * Life sciences\n\nContact\n\nQuantum Design GmbH\n\nMeerstraat 177 B-1852 Grimbergen Belgium\n\nMobil:| +32 495 797175  \n---|---  \nE-mail:| beneluxqd-europe.com  \n  \n\u00a9 2024 Quantum Design Inc.\n\nLinkedin\n\n  * Legal notice\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Cookie Settings\n\n## Our journal Spectrum\n\nfocuses on scientific and technical \"how-to\" articles and keep you up to date\nwith our latest news.\n\nClick here to register\n\nStephane StruyveSales Manager\n\n+32 495 79 71 75  \n---  \nWrite e-mail  \n  \nContact\n\n0 Bookmarks\n\nNewsletter\n\nTo top\n\n", "frontpage": false}
