Faced with the problem, the\n> field of red teaming is experiencing fast-paced growth, which highlights the\n> need for a comprehensive organization covering the entire pipeline and\n> addressing emerging topics for the community. Our extensive survey, which\n> examines over 120 papers, introduces a taxonomy of fine-grained attack\n> strategies grounded in the inherent capabilities of language models.\n> Additionally, we have developed the searcher framework that unifies various\n> automatic red teaming approaches. Moreover, our survey covers novel areas\n> including multimodal attacks and defenses, risks around multilingual models,\n> overkill of harmless queries, and safety of downstream applications. We hope\n> this survey can provide a systematic perspective on the field and unlock new\n> areas of research.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.00629 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.00629v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.00629arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Haonan Li [view email] [v1] Sun, 31 Mar 2024 09:50:39 UTC (2,109 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Against The Achilles' Heel: A Survey on Red\nTeaming for Generative Models, by Lizhi Lin and Honglin Mu and Zenan Zhai and\nMinghan Wang and Yuxia Wang and Renxi Wang and Junjie Gao and Yixuan Zhang and\nWanxiang Che and Timothy Baldwin and Xudong Han and Haonan Li\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
