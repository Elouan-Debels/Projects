For\nmodern people, this is reversed.\n\nFor primitive people, the natural world is mysterious. Sometimes it is\nbenevolent, and sometimes it is threatening. Weather can be pleasant, or it\ncan be harsh and miserable. Food can be abundant or scarce, depending on\nfactors beyond one\u2019s control. Plants can supply nourishment or be poisonous.\nOther animals can be helpful or be predators. Diseases seem to come from\nnowhere, and cures are unreliable.\n\nOur primitive explanations for natural phenomenon invoked spirits. There were\nhuman-like agents that caused rain or sickness. Today, we would say that to\nthe primitive mind, the world seems enchanted.\n\nThe enchantment went away gradually (think of the discoveries of the Greeks)\nand then suddenly, during what we call the scientific revolution. Thanks to\nour accumulated knowledge, we have been able to insulate ourselves from the\ndangers faced by our primitive ancestors. We have been able to overcome\nfamine, challenging weather, and disease.\n\nPart of our success in mastering the natural world is due to our ability to\ncooperate at large scale. This has made our social world much more complex.\n\nIn a primitive band, it is relatively easy to assess our social world. There\nis very little mystery in the psychology of those around us. Just about\neverything we need to know about other people we can learn by observing who is\ncooperative and who cheats. We can tell when someone is acting against our\ninterests. When one person is too strong and too selfish, we can readily form\na coalition against that person.\n\nIn large, modern societies, the social environment is much more complex. There\nare many ways in which a cheater may appear to be a cooperator, and vice-\nversa. We have evolved cultural institutions that are supposed to steer people\ntoward pro-social actions. But those institutions are complicated, imperfect,\nand subject to corruption and breakdown.\n\nOur thick culture is like a house that protects us from the natural world. But\nit is filled with strange gadgets and hazardous implements that can harm us,\nboth individually and collectively.\n\nI believe that when we look at our thick culture, we are like primitive people\nlooking at nature. We interpret phenomena by invoking \u201cclimate change\u201d or\n\u201cartificial intelligence\u201d or \u201csocial media\u201d or \u201cthe science,\u201d much in the way\nour ancestors invoked spirits to explain drought or sickness.\n\nEconomics, psychology, and other social sciences give us some insight into the\nworld that our culture has created. But I think that the complexity of culture\nhas far outpaced whatever understanding we have gained, and that it will\ncontinue to do so.\n\nShare\n\n20 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n20\n\nShare this post\n\n#### From Natural Mystery to Social Mystery\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n19\n\nShare\n\n19 Comments\n\njdnym6 hrs agoLiked by Arnold KlingAnd while natural world enchantment evokes\nhumility in the face of non-human forces that feel unknowable and\nuncontrollable, social world enchantment evokes hubris in the face of social\nforces that feel knowable and controllable.Expand full commentLike\n(4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies\n\nJohn Alcorn7 hrs agoLiked by Arnold KlingAn Alcorn hypothesis, inspired by\nArnold Kling's various blogposts about Dunbar's Number, evolutionary\npsychology of cooperation in early human bands, and challenges of cooperation\nwithin complex modern societies:(Dunbar's Number i= several dozen people.)a)\nIn some contexts of rivalry or competition between organizations, whose\nmembership does not exceed Dunbar's number, behaviors will tend to be\nregulated informally by an intense thicket of norms that mimic the social\npsychology of early human bands. For example, think of college sports teams\nand greek-letter orgs on campus.b) These norms will be excessively controlling\n(and so partly dysfunctional) in two ways:\\-- The norms will be overkill\nbecause the stakes are low compared to the survival stake that fostered\nintensive norms in early human bands. For example, members internalize norms\nof collective punishment of individual wrongdoing: players who are punctual\nmust run laps while the player who is tardy watches. For another example, on\nwomen's teams and in sororities, norms emerge that bar members from dating\nanyone who was previously in a relationship with a teammate.\\-- The norms are\nat odds with liberal principles of individual accountability in civil society.\nMoreover, it is questionable whether the norms improve team performance at\nall. For example, time and energy for symbolic collective punishment have\nopportunity costs, given that practice time is finite.c) The dysfunctional\nnorms emerge naturally and constitute an equilibrium because they are hard-\nwired in evolutionary psychology and are activated in Dunbar's Number contexts\nof intensive internal cooperation and rivalry versus other orgs or\nteams.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies by Arnold Kling and others\n\n17 more comments...\n\nThe Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\nWhy don't more women use it?\n\nSep 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n111\n\nI Condemn. . .But\n\nThe worst form of evil\n\nOct 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Condemn. . .But\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n80\n\nAssimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\nWe have not done it well\n\nMay 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n61\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arnold Kling\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
