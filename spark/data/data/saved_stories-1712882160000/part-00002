Mice and rats who were given GLP-1\ndrugs had higher incidence rates of developing thyroid C-cell tumors compared\nto those who weren\u2019t, a study published in Endocrinology found. There were 468\nreports of GLP-1-related thyroid cancer cases to the Food and Drug\nAdministration between 2006 and 2023, including 18 deaths.\n\n## Key Background\n\nNovo Nordisk, the makers of Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda and Victoza, list thyroid\ncancer as a potential side effect of each medicine and warn against use if a\ntype of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma runs in the family.\nHowever, it does note the existence of studies that have found each medicine\ncaused thyroid tumors in rats, though Novo states it\u2019s unclear if this also\nhappens in humans. The European Medicines Association reviewed recent research\nand said last October available evidence \u201cdoes not support a causal\nassociation\u201d between GLP-1 drugs and thyroid cancer. This came four months\nafter the EMA raised a safety signal and said it\u2019d look into whether GLP-1\ndrugs cause thyroid cancer. Researchers looked into the potential link between\nsemaglutide and all types of cancers\u2014including thyroid\u2014and couldn\u2019t find an\nincreased risk. A 2022 research review examined whether semaglutide use\nincreased the risk of thyroid cancer and other thyroid-related medical\nconditions like hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and found there wasn\u2019t an\nincreased risk. A previous study also compared GLP-1 drugs to SGLT2 inhibitors\nand found no increased risk of thyroid cancer in the study population that\ntook GLP-1 agonists, though the pool was much smaller than the BMJ study.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nNo Proven Link Between Weight Loss Drugs And Thyroid Cancer, EU Says (Forbes)\n\nWhat To Know About Ozempic: The Diabetes Drug Becomes A Viral Weight Loss Hit\n(Elon Musk Boasts Using It) Creating A Shortage (Forbes)\n\nNovo Nordisk says EMA raised safety signal on drugs including semaglutide\n(Reuters)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
