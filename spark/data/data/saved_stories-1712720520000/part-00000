If you haven\u2019t subscribed, join 222,725 smart, curious folks by\nsubscribing here:\n\nHi friends \ud83d\udc4b ,\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nEarlier this year, I wrote a piece on Techno-Industrials.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible for startups to take down large, seemingly\ninvincible incumbents, even in the hardest, most physical categories. It\u2019s\nhappened before, it will happen again, and I think Techno-Industrials will be\nthe ones to do it.\n\nThese companies have some similarities \u2014 using technology to deliver more for\nless in large existing markets \u2014 but each contender is necessarily unique.\nTrying to reshape industries as diverse as chemicals, energy, agriculture,\ndefense, and aerospace takes very different approaches.\n\nSo this year, I want to write deep dives about a number of Techno-Industrials\nand the industries they\u2019re trying to pull out of stagnation. The best way to\nunderstand the general trend, I think, is to zoom in on the specific cases.\n\nThe companies I\u2019ll write about are still very young and the odds are that each\nof them will fail, or at least fall short of their very big goal. But I hope\nthat a few will succeed, and that these deep dives will be the first thing you\nread about the companies and entrepreneurs that one day have whole books\nwritten about them. I\u2019m certainly rooting for them.\n\nToday, we\u2019re starting off with Astro Mechanica. Ian Brooke\u2019s company wants to\nride its new engine all the way to becoming The Aerospace Company, offering\nsupersonic flights anywhere in the world for about the same as a normal flight\ncosts today.\n\nBetter technology is necessary, but not sufficient, to remake an industry.\nWhen I saw Ian\u2019s engine reach escape velocity on twitter a few weeks back, I\nwanted to learn more about the business side of this new technology. This is\nwhat I learned.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\n##\n\nAstro Mechanica: The Aerospace Company\n\n(This is a long one. Click the link \ud83d\udc46 to read the full thing online.)\n\nThere\u2019s an old joke in the aerospace industry that goes like this:\n\nWhat makes airplanes fly?\n\nMoney.\n\nA modern twist may ask \u201cWhat makes airplanes fall apart?\u201d and arrive at the\nsame answer.\n\nWhichever way you tell the joke, like all great jokes, it gets at a deeper\ntruth. Technologies and business models are more deeply linked than most\npeople appreciate. New technologies can unlock new business models; old ones\ncan break even the best businesses.\n\nTo whit, in May 2014, Boeing\u2019s then-CEO Jim McNerney addressed a room full of\nWall Street analysts in Seattle\u2019s Fairmont Olympic Hotel.\n\nA departure from Boeing\u2019s engineer-CEOs of old, McNerney was financialization\npersonified. Harvard Business School, Procter & Gamble, McKinsey, General\nElectric, 3M, then, in 2005, Boeing.\n\n\u201cAll of us have gotten religion,\u201d McNerney preached, \u201cEvery 25 years a big\nmoonshot ... and then produce a 707 or a 787 \u2013 that\u2019s the wrong way to pursue\nthis business. The more-for-less world will not let you pursue moonshots.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a tragic statement from the leader of a company that made its name\npursuing moonshots, but McNerney was simply parroting the agreed-upon wisdom\nof the era.\n\nWhat he called \u201cthe more-for-less world,\u201d Clayton Christensen called the New\nChurch of Finance in a scathing 2012 essay. The New Church prioritized ratios\n\u2013 IRR, EPS, GM %, RONA, ROIC \u2013 over \u201ccash.\u201d So companies hollowed out\ndenominators in the race to go \u201casset-light.\u201d\n\nAmbitions crumbled like 737 MAXes as mechanical engineering gave way to\nfinancial engineering. Innovation moved from the drafting table and assembly\nline to the spreadsheet.\n\nA decade later, we know how that turned out.\n\nTrawling through the wreckage of a once-great company, analysts have created a\nlitany of crash reports. My favorites are David Perell\u2019s Why Did the Boeing\n737 Max Crash? and Charles Wing-Uexkull\u2019s Boeing\u2019s Uncontrolled Descent. These\npieces blame leadership, mergers, financialization, MBAs, lack of competition,\nAmerica\u2019s general decline, even wokeness. What they all miss is that this was\ninevitable.\n\nBoeing is an interchangeable actor in an ongoing story about the death and\nrebirth of technological paradigms. From Ford and GM to Tesla; from IBM to\nApple and Microsoft.\n\nThe airline industry is now in the 66th year of the Jet Age, the era that\nBoeing defined and dominated from the start.\n\nThere\u2019s simply no room left for real improvement \u2013 today\u2019s turbofan engines\ncarry planes as fast and efficiently as they physically can, airlines squeeze\nas many passengers into the same sized airframes as possible, airports squeeze\nas many planes into their gates as they can each day.\n\nFinancialization can slice up a fixed pie. Only technological progress can\ngrow the pie.\n\n###\n\nThe Turboelectric Age\n\nTo fix air travel, we need technology to lead us into the next age: The New\nJet Age. Or maybe the Turboelectric Age. That will depend on who wins.\n\nThe new Age of Air Travel will need new airframes, new business models, and\nfresh new companies. The shift that Tesla caught in automobiles, and that\nApple and Microsoft caught in computing, someone will catch in air travel.\n\nWhatever the shape, we can be fairly certain it will start with a new engine.\nThe Jet Age launched with the introduction of the 3x faster turbojet engine.\nThis New Jet Age might launch with the introduction of the 3x faster\nTurboelectric Adaptive Engine.\n\nA few weeks ago, Ian Brooke unveiled a prototype of the engine he\u2019d been\ndreaming towards practically his whole life:\n\nIan didn\u2019t think much of the video. The prototype was a year old; he and his\nteam were already deep into building the next version: the bigger, more\npowerful flight-ready engine. He prefers machining to tweeting, so he hadn\u2019t\nshared much at all about the engine or the company behind it until Christian\nKeil invited him to come on First Principles, at which point, why not share a\nlittle engineporn?\n\nThe tweet blew up: 7.9 million views, 26k likes, endless comments and quote\ntweets.\n\nAnd for good reason. That engine is special. It excites people, even people\nwho have seen a lot of exciting things.\n\nWhen Ian met Y Combinator founder Paul Graham at a February YC event, the two\nspoke for several hours, prompting this mysterious tweet from PG:\n\nLink to Tweet\n\nDuring the conversation, the legendary investor compared Ian\u2019s invention to no\nless than James Watt\u2019s steam engine, the machine that spawned the Industrial\nRevolution. Watt improved on Newcomen\u2019s engine design by separating the\ncondenser from the cylinder; Ian is improving on existing engine designs by\nseparating the compressor from the jet engine.\n\nWhat does that mean? We\u2019ll go into more detail on the how, but for now, let\u2019s\nfocus on the what:\n\n  * It\u2019s a Turboelectric Adaptive Engine, the world\u2019s first.\n\n  * Its magic is that it\u2019s efficient at every speed, from the puttering subsonic speed of today\u2019s commercial airliners to the face-melting Mach 5 of a rocket\u2019s first stage.\n\n  * The engine could unlock affordable supersonic flight anywhere in the world.\n\nIt will unlock new business models, too. Ian thinks that extreme vertical\nintegration is the right way to play this technological shift.\n\nIan\u2019s company, Astro Mechanica, wants to become The Aerospace Company, with a\n\u201cThe.\u201d\n\nIt plans to use its engine to launch satellites, then private planes, then\ncommercial planes, all of which it will manufacture, maintain, and operate.\nYou\u2019ll book flights from Astro Mechanica like you book rides from Uber, if the\nplan goes just right.\n\nThat\u2019s an insanely ambitious roadmap bursting with challenges. It\u2019s vertical\nintegration and horizontal integration with technical and engineering risk all\nrolled into one.\n\nIf Astro Mechanica nails practically everything \u2013 if it\u2019s right that aerospace\nis going Turboelectric, if it can be the company that builds the turboelectric\nadaptive engine, if it can parlay that engine into a successful small launch\nbusiness, then a successful supersonic private flight business, then a\nsuccessful supersonic airline \u2013 then it has a shot at becoming the first\ntrillion dollar aerospace company, with a \u201cT.\u201d\n\nWill it work? The odds are against it, but the opportunity is so large that\nthe expected value is worth the pursuit.\n\nAstro Mechanica\u2019s goals are so obviously moonshots, and its odds so obviously\nlong shots, that the far more interesting thing to do than dismiss them is to\ntake them seriously.\n\nBut either someone will win or our kids won\u2019t fly. Stagnation is death. Air\ntravel needs fixing, and it needs to be fixed outside of the current system.\n\nSo what would it take for Astro Mechanica to be that company? Why now? How\nwill it fund its vertical integration in a more-for-less world? Can it help\nusher back in a more-for-more world?\n\nWe\u2019ll explore those questions and more. I\u2019ll be your pilot on this flight \u2013 a\nwordcel who last took a physics class in the aughts \u2013 so fasten your\nseatbelts, ignore the turbulence, and enjoy the ride.\n\n###\n\nWhere Air Travel Went Wrong\n\nCommercial air travel feels gross \u2013 smaller seats, fees for everything,\ndelays, crumbling planes. I\u2019ve always taken a shower when I get off a flight,\nbecause of the germs. Now I feel like I need to take a shower after every\ninteraction with an airline, because of the tricks.\n\nYes of course I\u2019ve seen the Louis CK skit. Yes it is cool to partake of the\nmiracle of human flight.\n\nThe problem is, the air travel experience is moving backwards. We remember one\nthing, and we get a different, worse thing. Happiness is expectations minus\nreality, and airlines continue to squeeze every last bit of happiness out of\nthe reality of flight.\n\nThis is what air travel looked like in the 1970s:\n\nContinental Airlines Coach Lounge in the 1970s via Messy Nessy\n\nThis is what air travel looks like now:\n\nUnited Flight\n\nIt\u2019s not really Boeing\u2019s fault, or United Airlines, or even Spirit Airlines.\nIt\u2019s not one\u2019s fault really; it\u2019s just what happens when an industry stands\nstill.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t someone just fix it?\n\nFix what? The whole industry?\n\nWithout technological progress \u2013 the ability to actually do more with less in\nthe physical world \u2013 you\u2019re left rearranging the economy chairs on a Boeing,\nas it were, cutting a fixed pie into ever-thinner slices to feed more people a\nlittle taste.\n\nThe technological and commercial are intricately linked; to understand what\nwent wrong, and how someone might fix it, we need to look at both.\n\nTechnological Stagnation\n\nChristian Keil changed the way I think about Boeing. \u201cBoeing isn\u2019t crazy or\nincompetent,\u201d he argued when we were talking about this piece. \u201cThey\u2019re really\ngood at making planes. They\u2019re just at the end of their tech tree.\u201d\n\nWhen you think about the good ol\u2019 days of air travel, you think of Pan Am. Air\ntravel was so sexy in Pan Am\u2019s golden years that ABC made a TV show about the\nairline starring Margot Robbie.\n\nPan Am\n\nAir travel was so sexy in the Pan Am days because the technology that powered\nit was so new. In October 1958, when my mom was 1 month old, the Jet Age was\nborn when Pan Am flew the first Boeing 707 from New York to Paris. New is\nexciting. New is sexy.\n\nBefore the 707, propeller planes like the Lockheed Super Constellation took\n14-15 hours to travel from New York to Paris, with refueling stops on the way.\nThe jet engine cut the time in half. The jet engine made travel more luxurious\n\u2013 the \u201cJet Set\u201d made frequent trips across the Atlantic \u2013 and more accessible\n\u2013 the number of airline passengers more than quadrupled from 1955 to 1972.\n\nJet engines \u2013 first turbojets, now turbofans \u2013 go much faster than the\npropellers they succeeded. But the turbofan can\u2019t go supersonic. Christian\nexplains why in this great jet airliner explainer.\n\nAirplane manufacturers have pushed about as fast as they can go with the\nturbofan \u2013 most travel Mach 0.85 to Mach 0.9 \u2013 and most of the innovation has\nbeen in increasing bypass ratios to fly more efficiently and quietly at those\nspeeds.\n\nThe Boeing 707, released in 1958, traveled 600 mph. The Boeing Dreamliner was\nreleased 51 years later and cruises at 560 mph.\n\nTo their credit, planes have gotten incredibly efficient. As Anna-Sofia Lesiv\nhighlights in her excellent piece, The Future of Aviation, the airline\nindustry \u201chas managed to achieve impressive gains in fuel efficiency over the\npreceding decades with average fuel consumption of new commercial jet aircraft\nfalling by 50% since 1960.\u201d\n\nThe ITCC\n\nBut at this point, we\u2019ve basically reached the limits of turbofans\u2019\nperformance.\n\nWe came very close to a new era with the supersonic Concorde, but it ran into\na whole host of issues, from sound (it couldn\u2019t fly overland because the\nsupersonic boom was so noisy)1 to cost. It was designed in a time when fuel\nwas cheap in the 1960s, but by the time it took flight in the 1970s, the Oil\nCrisis had hit, and the supersonic plane\u2019s fuel consumption became a big\nissue. The Concorde was ~10x more expensive to operate than a 747, because\nfuel consumption increases with the square of velocity!\n\nStill, it was a valiant attempt, and it\u2019s worth noting that the attempt was\nwaged outside of Boeing. The leader has too much to lose, or at least too much\nto unwind. It\u2019s positioned.\n\nFor Boeing, which introduced the Jet Age, to continue to progress, it would\nneed to completely shift the paradigm in which it operates.\n\nIt would need to bet on a new type of engine, and then adapt the complex web\nof relationships and interdependencies to that core decision: new airframe\ndesigns, new supply chains, new manufacturing processes, new everything. It\nwould need to relinquish its comfortable duopoly position and convince its\ncustomers to buy something new and unproven.\n\nThat\u2019s both difficult and risky. So instead, it tries to squeeze every last\ndrop out of the existing paradigm by tweaking designs here and there,\noutsourcing everything it can, and focusing on efficiency. It stands still and\nholds on for dear life.\n\nBut the problem, as Christian reminded me, is that the quality assurance\nproblems Boeing is experiencing are exactly what happens when you stand still.\nIf you\u2019re not progressing, entropy kills you.\n\nThat\u2019s true for the airframes themselves, and it\u2019s true for the experience of\nflying. Because as airlines compete to serve more customers with basically a\nfixed set of resources, experience suffers.\n\n####\n\nSlicing Up a Fixed Pie\n\nOne of the reasons airlines were so luxurious in the 1970s was that the pie\nwas growing and airlines competed for their slices based on the quality of\nexperience they offered passengers. In fact, experience was one of the only\nthings airlines could differentiate on.\n\nAirlines were tightly regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) under the\nCivil Aeronautics Act of 1938.\n\nThe Journal of Air Law via SMU\n\nThe CAB controlled routes, fares, and market entry and exit. The CAB set fares\nbased on a \u201cfair return\u201d to the airlines, keeping prices relatively high. New\nairlines needed CAB approval to enter the market, which limited competition,\nand airline M&A was subject to CAB approval, which limited consolidation. The\nCAB promoted air travel as a premium service in order to keep fares high and\nensure airlines\u2019 financial stability, and airlines couldn\u2019t compete on price,\nso they competed on offering the best service to mostly first class customers.\n\nAmerican Airlines Piano Lounge via Messy Nessy\n\nIt looked awesome, but the pictures don\u2019t show the many people who were not\nable to fly because of the high prices.\n\nIn 1978, Senator Ted Kennedy championed the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978\nand President Jimmy Carter signed it into law.\n\nThe Act did a lot of the things we celebrate here at Not Boring; its goals\nwere to increase competition, lower fares, and improve efficiency through free\nmarket forces. And it worked.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2019, the number of annual airline passengers grew from 800\nmillion to 4.6 billion. More than half of the people on earth fly through the\nair like a bird every year. That\u2019s magnificent.\n\nIEA\n\nBut it also marked the beginning of the end of air travel as a great\nexperience as it moved the vector of competition from experience to price. As\nthe market expanded, it naturally brought in more price-sensitive consumers,\nand the industry bent itself to win their business.\n\nLow-cost carriers and price shopping via online travel agencies forced\nairlines to rip all the nice things out of the ticket price and sell them back\nto you a la carte. Jamming more low-price fliers into essentially the same\nplanes into airports that struggled to expand meant thinner seats, less\nlegroom, more delays, less room for your bags, and all of the features of\nmodern air travel you know and hate.\n\nIt\u2019s great that more people can travel, but if it feels like air travel is\ngetting shittier and shittier, that\u2019s because from the experience of each\npassenger, it is.\n\nAirlines are stuck in a competitive downward spiral, trying to steal and\nsqueeze more out of a technologically and infrastructurally fixed pie. Between\nthe technical limitations and the commercial price wars, we\u2019re stuck with a\nstagnating industry. And stagnation is death.\n\nAir travel is so obviously ripe for disruption that the only surprise is that\nno one\u2019s made a real run yet.\n\nThe challenge is, the problem isn\u2019t with any company but the whole system.\nWhich means that you have to reimagine the whole system to even have a shot.\n\nToppling the Jet Age institutions will start with a technical breakthrough as\nbig as the leap from propellers to jets. Astro Mechanica is betting that the\nTurboelectric Adaptive Engine is that breakthrough.\n\nTurboelectric Adaptive Engines for Dummies\n\nThis is a rendering of Astro Mechanica\u2019s Turboelectric Adaptive Engine:\n\nRenderings of the Turboelectric Adaptive Engine from Astro Mechanica\n\nThe engine on the left is the turbogenerator \u2013 it makes the electricity. The\nengine on the right is the propulsion unit \u2013 it makes the plane go fast.\nNormally, they\u2019re part of the same thing, but Astro Mechanica separates them.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\nAir flows in through the turbogenerator (which Astro Mechanica buys off the\nshelf) to produce electrical power. That electrical power is used to power an\nelectric motor. The electric motor can be used to adaptively control the\npropulsion unit (which Astro Mechanica makes in-house) on the left with\nprecision, making it behave like a turbofan, turbojet, or ramjet depending on\nthe speed.\n\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s important:\n\nNormally, in jet engine design, there is a trade-off \u2013 efficient and slow, or\ninefficient and fast. That trade-off is represented by the Specific Impulse\nCurve.\n\nSpecific Impulse Curve\n\nSpecific impulse, or Isp, is a measure of the efficiency of rocket and jet\nengines. Essentially, how fast can you go for how long with a given amount of\nfuel.\n\nNormal jet engines aren\u2019t adaptive \u2013 they are what they are. So they need to\noptimize for a thing.\n\nIf you\u2019re a commercial airliner, you want to optimize for efficiency at\ncruising speeds and altitudes. A turbofan engine is most efficient there, so\nthey use turbofan engines that cap out at around Mach 0.9, or 90% the speed of\nsound. Fuel efficiency is critical to operating costs, and going faster would\nmake tickets prohibitively expensive, so you prioritize efficiency at fast\nenough.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the plane for military or reconnaissance purposes, however,\nprice is no object. Performance is all that matters. So you can trade\nefficiency for speed. The fastest plane of all time, Lockheed\u2019s SR-71\nBlackbird, used the J58 Pratt and Whitney engine, which operates as both a\nnormal turbojet for speeds up to Mach 2, and switches to Turbo Ramjet for\nspeeds up to Mach 3.3. It\u2019s very expensive and inefficient, but very fast.\n\nRockets are the most extreme version of the trade-off. They have to carry all\nof their own fuel and oxidizer (essentially liquid air) to create the\ncombustion reaction that makes the exhaust that pushes out the back of the\nrocket to propel it upwards. Carrying everything it needs for the whole\njourney instead of using the earth\u2019s free air makes it super inefficient in\nearth\u2019s atmosphere at low speeds, but rockets are the only way to fly in\nspace, and the only way to go very fast, like orbital velocity at Mach 25.\nIt\u2019s super inefficient and expensive, but the only choice at those speeds and\naltitudes.\n\nThe hope for the Turboelectric Adaptive Engine is that it can eliminate the\ntrade-off between efficiency and speed.\n\nAndercot on X\n\nAstro Mechanica\u2019s Turboelectric Engine isn\u2019t the fastest way to go fast \u2013\nthat\u2019s a pure rocket \u2013 but it aims to be the most efficient way to go fast. It\ncan go supersonic without breaking the bank.\n\nOn paper, it\u2019s both more efficient and 3x faster than the modern jet engine.\n\nIf the engine does what Ian thinks it can, it can maintain maximum efficiency\nat every speed up to Mach 3.4.\n\nIt does that by behaving like different engines \u2013 turbofan, turbojet, ramjet \u2013\nas it picks up speed.\n\nAstro Mechanica Internal Deck\n\nThis sounds like something that all engine designers would simply do. Why now?\n\nThat electric motor we talked about earlier lets Astro Mechanica decouple\nthermodynamics from propulsion.\n\nIt\u2019s like having a power plant onboard that produces electricity that you can\nuse however you need, including spinning the propulsion unit\u2019s turbine at just\nthe right speed for the task at hand.\n\nIt\u2019s only now possible because electric motors can deliver enough Watts per\nkilogram to make their inclusion worth their weight.\n\nImprovement in Electric Motors From Andrew C\u00f4t\u00e9\n\nIn other words, the mass of the electric motor is finally less than the mass\nof the fuel it lets the plane save by being more efficient. Over time, these\nmotors should continue to get more efficient, making the trade even more\nfavorable.\n\nThe Turboelectric Adaptive Engine, by making 3x faster flight affordable,\nmight be the technological breakthrough needed to propel us out of the\ncrumbling Jet Age.\n\nBut new technology is necessary, not sufficient.\n\nThe engine is a platform, a starting point from which to design new airframes\nand business models that match its capabilities.\n\nHow would you design a business around supersonic planes that can be built and\noperated more cheaply than their subsonic counterparts? You\u2019d have the\nopportunity to rethink everything.\n\nWhereas Boeing ushered in the Jet Age using Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojet\nengines on planes flown and operated by Pan Am, Astro Mechanica wants to usher\nin the Turboelectric Age on Astro Mechanica planes flying Astro Mechanica\nengines operated by Astro Mechanica itself.\n\nVertical integration is back, baby!\n\nBut no one\u2019s about to hand a two year old company $10 billion or so to rebuild\nthe airline industry from scratch. (Whether maybe they should is another\ndiscussion for another essay.)\n\nSo like the engine itself, Astro Mechanica is designing its business model to\nbe efficient at all speeds and stages, too.\n\n###\n\nStaging The Aerospace Company\n\nAt some point in the future, call it twenty years from now, Astro Mechanica\nwants to be synonymous with air travel the way Apple is synonymous with phones\nor Uber is synonymous with rides.\n\nStart with the engine, build a company that owns the trillion dollar aerospace\nindustry.\n\nWhen you want to fly somewhere \u2013 a little hop from SF to LA or a globe-\nspanning trip from New York to Tokyo \u2013 you book it directly with Astro\nMechanica. You get there three times faster on planes designed and built by\nAstro Mechanica, powered by Astro Mechanica engines.\n\nThat\u2019s the big goal, the one that changes the world by shrinking it.\n\nBut building planes that will fly passengers is a very expensive endeavor,\nthanks in part to the years and many test flights it takes to get a plane\nflight certified. A new Gulfstream might take 3 years and $5-7 billion dollars\nto get to the point at which it can start carrying passengers.\n\nSo you can\u2019t start there. It would require so much venture capital that the\nfounder wouldn\u2019t end up owning anything at the end, even assuming he\u2019s able to\nraise all the money. Plus, you\u2019d want to run tests on something that you don\u2019t\nmind blowing up.\n\nSo: to build the airline of the 21st Century, begin by launching rockets. Duh.\n\nSpace launch is the Roadster in Astro\u2019s Tesla strategy: start at the highest\nend of the market and move cheaper and more mass market over time. From space\nlaunch to private planes (Model S), from private planes to commercial\nairliners (Model 3), building the airplane gigafactory along the way, until\nit\u2019s churning out planes of all sizes cheaply and reliably.\n\nBut first, space launch.\n\n####\n\nStage 1: Space Launch\n\nOne way to tell Astro Mechanica\u2019s story is that it needs to compete with\nSpaceX in the launch market to pass the first gate. That\u2019s not quite true.\nNever compete with SpaceX head-on.\n\nInstead, Astro Mechanica will sell dedicated small launchers capable of\ncarrying up to 1200kg \u2013 an order of magnitude less than Falcon 9 and two\norders of magnitude less than Starship.\n\nCompeting more directly with small launchers like Rocket Lab and Firefly,\nthey\u2019ll sell dedicated flights to satellite companies, which can launch on\ntheir own schedule to exactly where they want to go without expensive and\ntime-consuming SpaceX integration.\n\nAnd instead of launching traditional two-stage rockets that shoot straight up,\nAstro Mechanica will fly carrier planes that look like Concordes that drop\nupper stage rockets that look like Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron.\n\nThe plane will be powered by the Turboelectric Adaptive Engine, and the rocket\nwill be a rocket.\n\nChristian Keil, who works at satellite company Astranis when he\u2019s not\ninterviewing deep tech founders, told me that there\u2019s practically no demand\nrisk if they can launch. The way it works, he told me, is that small launchers\ngo around to the satellite companies and ask, \u201cIf I could give you a dedicated\nrocket at this price, would you buy it?\u201d They say yes, and then sign an LOI.\nAstro Mechanica has already signed a number of LOIs.\n\nThe challenge is actually launching \u2013 the inability to do that well is what\nkilled small launchers Astra and Virgin Orbit.\n\nThis is clearly a major risk to Astro Mechanica\u2019s master plan.\n\nLaunching things into space is hard, but according to the plan, it\u2019s the easy\npart meant to generate cash flow to fund the harder and more expensive stuff.\n\nThe bright spot in the industry has been Rocket Lab, which has been pulling\noff missions with amazing names since 2018. They\u2019ve already done four in 2024.\n\nRocket Lab Launches Since November 2022\n\nThe company, whose Electron is the only reusable small launch vehicle on the\nmarket, is worth roughly $2 billion in the public markets.\n\nWhat Rocket Lab has done is incredibly impressive. It\u2019s also taken 18 years\nsince Peter Beck founded the company in 2006, plus over $250 million in\nventure capital and more when you include SPAC proceeds, to get to this point.\n\nAstro Mechanica plans to do one launch per week within the next few years.\nThat\u2019s a big leap to make from Rocket Labs\u2019s one-per-month. Ian thinks it\u2019s\nachievable, though, because of the simplified design and inherent reusability\nadvantages of planes over rockets.\n\nIf it hits its launch targets, Astro Mechanica believes it can break even on\nprogram costs to develop the first space launch vehicle \u2013 which won\u2019t be\nreusable, at first \u2013 in 13 flights. From there, if it sells each flight for\n$10 million, or $8,400/kg, it can generate $8 million in margin on each\nflight.\n\nBy its fifth year of operations, it plans to develop a reusable version that\nit would sell for $5 million per flight, or $3,571/kg, at almost pure gross\nmargin. The $200 million expected development cost would be paid back in 42\nsuccessful flights, after which it would become a money-printing machine that\nhappens to launch satellites.\n\nHere, the carrier plane has an advantage over traditional rocket boosters,\nlike Rocket Lab\u2019s. Planes are incredibly reusable. SpaceX hopes to get 100\nflights out of a booster; a Boeing 747 can fly 35,000 flights over its\nlifetime.\n\nYou should treat all of these numbers as if they\u2019re the middle of a wide range\n\u2013 manufacturing will undoubtedly introduce unexpected challenges and costs.\n\nTo believe that Astro Mechanica can make it to the next stage, you need to\ndirectionally believe that this can become a business that does hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in revenue at positive contribution margins on the\nprogram-level, against which the company can raise and borrow loads of money.\n\nFor his part, Ian believes that space launch could become a $500 million\nannual business for Astro Mechanica relatively quickly.\n\n####\n\nStage 1a: Adaptive Business Model\n\nRockets are an important gate for the business, but when I asked Ian what\nhappens if the launch business is slower than expected, he told me they have\nother options. That they could ... adapt.\n\nThey could just sell the engine and components directly to companies that\nmight need them for drones or other defense applications. Tesla brought in\nearly meaningful revenue supplying powertrains to Toyota and Mercedes; Astro\ncould do something similar.\n\nTesla\n\nThis isn\u2019t a purity contest. Ian has no special love of rockets. The point of\nthis stage is just to build the engine, test the engine, and print cash.\nBecause it can use that cash to make planes.\n\n####\n\nStage 2: Private Supersonic Planes\n\nAstro Mechanica isn\u2019t a SpaceX competitor, but it does want to take over\nBoeing\u2019s place at the head of airplane manufacturing.\n\nYou don\u2019t beat Boeing at its own game, even in Boeing\u2019s current form. Boeing,\nand its one competitor, Airbus, benefit from scale economies, high switching\ncosts, and cornered resources in the form of contracts and congressmen.\nBuilding a 787 competitor and trying to sell it to airlines would be an\nincredibly expensive fool\u2019s errand.\n\nSo instead, Astro Mechanica plans to start at the high end of the market by\nbuilding small supersonic private planes (Supersonic Transports, in industry\nparlance, or SST) and selling them to customers for whom time is (a lot of)\nmoney.\n\nI\u2019m oversimplifying, but Astro Mechanica can essentially pull the rocket out\nof the launch system and replace it with some leather seats and a bathroom to\ncarry humans across the earth instead of satellites to outer space.\n\nAs mentioned, certifying a plane that carries passengers is time-consuming and\nexpensive, even for established players like Gulfstream, let alone for a new\nentrant with a radical new engine strapped into a new airframe.\n\nTo handle the expensive piece, Astro Mechanica plans to borrow the billions\nrequired against the cashflow from the launch business.\n\nTo handle the time-consuming piece, it plans to use flight data it\u2019s gathered\nfrom the launch flights to speed up the process with the FAA.\n\nSpaceX has shown that the best way to test spaceflight vehicles is to build\nthem, blow them up, and learn. AJ Piplica, the CEO of hypersonic aircraft\nstartup Hermeus, put it bluntly: \u201cIf we can build a vehicle for less than the\ncost of going into a wind tunnel, then if we put a hole in the desert, we\u2019re\nnot losing that much.\u201d\n\nThe way Ian sees it, \u201cCertification is easier once you\u2019ve flown for space.\nYou\u2019re getting paid to get the valuable flight test data\u201d that the FAA\nrequires. Plus, you can \u201cpush to look at certain flight dynamics with the same\nairframe and no humans onboard. What\u2019s the worst that can happen? We lose a $5\nmillion aircraft and we get data we couldn\u2019t have gotten otherwise.\u201d\n\nIf Astro Mechanica can pull that off, Ian\u2019s calculations suggest that they can\nbuild a 5-to-8-seat SST that can fly across the country for roughly $3,000\ninstead of the $60,000 it costs to make the same trip on a 14-seat Gulfstream\nG700.\n\nGulfstream G700 via Aviation International News\n\nLike the rocket launch schedule, that seems insanely ambitious, but it\u2019s\nbacked up by the Techno-Economic Analysis.\n\nThere are a few factors that drive the theoretical savings, which are\nadvantages that Astro Mechanica plans to leverage no matter the plane size it\nproduces.\n\nFirst, vertical integration done right saves money by cutting out layers of\nmargins that would go to various parties. Astro Mechanica will make part of\nits own engines, whereas Gulstream buys theirs. Astro Mechanica will operate\nits own flights, so it gets to use its planes at cost. Gulfstream sells\nairplanes, Astro Mechanica sells flights. That means that Gulfstream has to\nsell planes at a margin either to private buyers, who will use it less, or to\nprivate flight services, who will use the plane more but have to charge a\nmargin on top of Gulstream\u2019s margin. A G700 might start at around a $75\nmillion acquisition price; Astro Mechanica believes it can make its 5-to-8\nseater aircraft for $9 million.\n\nSecond, because Astro Mechanica will both manufacture and operate planes, it\u2019s\nincentivized to build planes that last. Airplane manufacturers like Boeing\nmake money selling replacement parts to airlines, so they\u2019re financially happy\nwhen things break down. Astro Mechanica would be buying replacement parts from\nitself, and taking planes out of service to maintain them, so it\u2019s\nincentivized to build things that last.\n\nThird, Astro Mechanica is designing its engines to run on liquefied natural\ngas (LNG) instead of jet fuel. LNG is about one-tenth the price of jet fuel,\nand is more energy dense than jet fuel. Energy requirements go up with the\nsquare of velocity, which kills traditional supersonic aircraft economics, but\nthe improved efficiency of its engine combined with the cheaper, more energy\ndense fuel increases Astro\u2019s range and dramatically reduces its cost. All\ntold, Ian expects to burn almost the exact same amount of fuel as a Gulfstream\nper passenger mile while going 3x faster. Because Astro uses LNG, they can\nspend roughly one-third as much per passenger on fuel as Gulfstream.\n\nFinally, less time means less money on expenses with hourly costs. If the\nplane goes three times as fast, you only need to pay pilots for one-third the\ntime.\n\nAll of these advantages exist on paper today, so an enormous milestone for\nAstro will be proving that they hold true, give or take some healthy room for\nerror, in a real plane.\n\nIf they do, Astro Mechanica should be able to dramatically undercut the cost\nof flying private while offering a superior product \u2013 speed \u2013 that allows it\nto charge high prices direct to customers and capture healthy margins. They\nplan to charge $80-100k per flight \u2013 to book the whole plane \u2013 which is more\nexpensive, but gets you there 3x faster.\n\nBusiness travelers make up just 12% of tickets, but can account for as much as\n75% of the revenue and even more of the profit on certain flights. Business\nclass travelers are the iPhone buyers of air travel \u2013 a smaller market share\nsegment that represents the vast majority of the market\u2019s profits.\n\n\u201cWe can get all of them,\u201d Ian said. \u201cWe\u2019re not charging much more per seat,\nwe\u2019re just making you buy more seats.\u201d\n\nIan expects that at this stage of the business, with less than a hundred\nairplanes, it can do $5-10 billion in annual revenue.\n\n####\n\nStage 3: Semi-Private Supersonic Planes\n\nAs Astro Mechanica begins to dominate the private flight market, it can build\na larger airframe, serve more customers on each flight, and make supersonic\ntravel more affordable.\n\nIan compares this to the European train model: build a 30-seater, separate it\ninto cabs of four, and make customers buy a 4-seat cab. The 30-seater size is\nstrategic: at 30 passengers, you\u2019re not considered an airline, and can fly out\nof smaller private airports without the hassles of the TSA, like JetSuiteX\ndoes.\n\nThe JSX Experience\n\nBecause airlines spend so much on planes \u2013 because CapEx dominates OpEx \u2013\ntheir model is built around running flights on a schedule, filling as many\nseats as possible, and flying them at low or even negative margins.\n\nBecause each of Astro Mechanica\u2019s planes will cost it less, it can both have\nmore planes and only fly them when they\u2019re full enough to be profitable. So\nunlike a train model, these flights might be unscheduled, like private\nflights. When a plane fills up, it leaves.\n\nIan calls this stage \u201csemi-attainable private travel,\u201d and if his numbers are\nright, it might be more attainable than that.\n\nIn the company\u2019s TEA, he models that each seat on a semi-private supersonic\nflight from SF to NYC would cost customers just $402 at a 50% margin to Astro\nMechanica. That\u2019s cheap enough to be competitive with a commercial plane for a\nregular customer traveling in a group of four, and the business class traveler\nin a hurry could buy out a cab of four for the same price they\u2019re used to\npaying to fly commercial.\n\nAt this stage, Astro Mechanica really begins to compete with incumbent\nairlines in a meaningful way. The biggest bottleneck to growth might not be\ndemand or planes, but small airports that could handle the volume.\n\nMaybe you vertically integrate even further, owning and operating private\nairports. Ian has his sights set on one location near SF that would be perfect\n\u2013 \u201cit\u2019s on a landfill, out of the way of traffic\u201d \u2013 but at this point, we\u2019re\nprobably getting a little ahead of ourselves.\n\n####\n\nStage 4: The Aerospace Company\n\nIf Astro Mechanica successfully builds a profitable space launch business,\nleverages that into private supersonic transport, and leverages that into\nsemi-private SST, it will have already changed air travel for the better,\nshrunk the world, and built one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nFrom there, it has some more expansion options: it can go shorter or bigger.\n\nIt could offer short haul subsonic flights between cities like SF and LA, or\nNYC and DC. Ian said that an obvious application of a hybrid engine that\ndecouples thermodynamics from propulsion is making a safer version of the V-22\nOsprey.\n\nBell Boeing V-22 Osprey, Wikipedia\n\nI\u2019m going to have to take his word on that, but one thing it would do is\ndecrease congestion at private airports. How, you ask? Well, these things\ncould take off from barges operating on the water next to major cities, of\ncourse. Book a flight, Waymo to the water, hop into a little boat, jump on the\nbarge, into the plane, and off to your destination.\n\nAnd/or it could go the other direction, building much larger planes and\noperating them like a traditional airline, schedules and all, but supersonic.\n\nBased on the same dynamics that would make Astro Mechanica\u2019s private flights\ncheaper \u2013 vertical integration, cheaper fuel, fewer hours \u2013 the company\u2019s TEA\nshows ticket prices that are half those of traditional airlines for a flight\nthat gets you there in one third of the time.\n\nThat would require some regulatory gymnastics. Thanks to the Air Mail Act of\n1934 and subsequent updates, airplane manufacturers aren\u2019t allowed to operate\ntheir own airlines. But if it makes it this far, Astro Mechanica will have the\nresources to hire some pretty great lawyers and lobbyists, and millions of\nclamoring travelers willing to write letters to their Congresspeople on the\ncompany\u2019s behalf.\n\nLarge airline or not, if it reaches this stage of the journey, Astro Mechanica\nwill offer flights anywhere in the world, at various price points and levels\nof convenience, directly through its own booking channels. It will even send\npayloads, and maybe one day, people, to space.\n\nThis is the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars per year opportunity.\n\nAt this point, it would be The Aerospace Company, feasibly worth $1 trillion.\n\nTo be fair, the plan seems impossibly hard, dependent on a perfectly\norchestrated series of technical and commercial achievements that would make\nRube Goldberg himself dizzy. It will take a very long time, and billions of\ndollars. If it starts working, competitors will strike and incumbents will\nsue.\n\nIt\u2019s a deeply complex plan, one that should beggar belief. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s\nlikely to work. But I think there is a real opportunity to rethink air travel\nright now, and this is the kind of plan it would take to do it.\n\nJust as in software, physical industries experience platform shifts \u2013 like\nfrom the propeller to the jet engine in air travel \u2013 that create the\nopportunity for generational companies.\n\nThose shifts are just an opportunity, not a guarantee. They\u2019re not even a very\ngood shot; just the little crack needed to earn the right to try to do\nsomething impossibly hard.\n\nThen, it\u2019s up to an entrepreneur with the Wright Stuff.\n\n###\n\nThe Wright Stuff\n\nIan Brooke grew up in rural California among the Redwoods, where he learned\nphysics by racing around the redwoods.\n\n\u201cIf you grow up in the city, you learn human rules. They\u2019re made up rules.\nThey\u2019re not real,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe built jumps with tractors and raced through\ntrees, and when you fall from one of those, the fall is real. Building up that\nintuition is a useful skill to have.\u201d\n\nFrom a very young age, Ian wanted to fly fighter jets, but from a very young\nage, he knew that it wouldn\u2019t be on his terms, and that he probably wouldn\u2019t\nqualify for the job anyways. If he made the fighter plane, though, no one\ncould stop him from flying it. That became the goal.\n\nThe way that Ian laid his path, intentionally or not, seems to have been to\nwork on smaller models of things and then use the intuition earned to make\nbigger and bigger things.\n\nHe built model airplanes and became a pilot, learning how planes fit together,\nand how they feel to fly. \u201cI have some pilot friends,\u201d he said, \u201cwho could\nnever explain how or why the plane does the thing, but they have a good built-\nin model for how things move through the world.\u201d\n\nIan wanted to do both \u2013 to understand and feel, to be a builder and operator.\n\u201cI want to build better things to operate.\u201d He wanted to become a full-stack\nengineer.\n\nHe also became a full-stack entrepreneur.\n\nBefore Astro Mechanica, Ian ran a successful bootstrapped motorcycle company.\nHe made things, handled sales, took customer support calls, and did the books.\nHe designed the thing, machined the thing, and sold the thing. There aren\u2019t\nmany people who do all three.\n\nProof came randomly when I was talking to Matt Parlmer, the founder of Not\nBoring Capital portfolio company General Fabrication, a couple weeks ago.\nGeneral Fabrication makes machines that can make anything, starting with 3D\nprinters that make plastic parts. As we were talking through potential\ncustomers, about companies full of strong engineers that Matt expects to land,\nI brought up Astro Mechanica.\n\n\u201cThat one\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Matt told me. \u201cIan built motorcycles by hand. That dude\ncan machine anything himself.\u201d That\u2019s absurdly high praise coming from Matt.\n\nAnyway, while Ian was making motorcycles, his mind was always on the skies.\nBack in 2019, he started to think through how you\u2019d design an engine that\nwould make flying private as cheap as airliners.\n\nHe knew it was possible. Private jets take 20-30,000 man hours to assemble,\nwhich is crazy, because a car, which is more mechanically complicated, takes\n40-50.\n\n(I like this way of thinking. Valar Atomics CEO Isaiah Taylor made a similar\npoint about nuclear reactor construction on Age of Miracles. Elon Musk has a\nrelated concept: the Idiot Index).\n\n\u201cWhat fact of engineering requires that it takes an entire human life to\nmanufacture a private jet?\u201d he asked when we first spoke.\n\nSpoiler: there isn\u2019t one. It was just really complex, and hard for anyone to\nhold everything it would take to make one in their head.\n\nIan thought he could. By starting with very small things, like model\nairplanes, and moving up to bigger things, like experimental airplanes, he had\na sixth sense for how things fit together, and for what it takes to maintain\nthem when they fall apart.\n\nOn First Principles, he told Christian, \u201cI just know that if you put this\nthing there, it\u2019s going to be miserable to assemble and expensive to fix.\nImagine you have a bunch of planes out there. How does the mechanic interact\nwith it when it comes in for maintenance? You have to think about the Mechanic\nExperience.\u201d\n\nIf that seems like skipping a few steps ahead when Astro Mechanica hasn\u2019t\nbuilt a single aircraft yet, that\u2019s the point as Ian sees it.\n\n\u201cMost engineers don\u2019t understand what\u2019s involved in actually making the thing\nthey come up with,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy secret sauce is that I\u2019ve spent my life\nbecoming the person who builds the thing. I\u2019m a pilot first and foremost, I\nknow why things are engineered the way they are, and I know the manufacturing\nprocess. There\u2019s always some trade-off, and it\u2019s faster to make it if one\nperson is holding everything in their head.\u201d\n\n####\n\nSo that Wright Stuff...\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure where to put this, but Ian has some strong Wright Brothers\nvibes.\n\nThe Wrights\u2019 flight was made possible by advances in motors from the\nautomotive industry. The Wright Brothers started as bicycle repairmen, then\nmanufacturers, which gave them the capital, shop space, and intuition needed\nto build their plane.\n\nWhen I told Ian about the connection I was trying to make, he laughed, before\nsaying, \u201cI'd like to mention an amusing coincidence, I was born on Wilbur\nWright's birthday, April 16th.\u201d\n\nIan Brooke (l) and Wilbur Wright (r)\n\nGet the fuck out of here. Come on.\n\nI could make comparisons with Lockheed Skunkworks chief Kelly Johnson, who\ndesigned the P-38 Lightning, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the U-2, and who had\nsuch an aerodynamic intuition that his boss, Hall Hibbard, once exclaimed,\n\u201cThat damned Swede can actually see air.\u201d But I\u2019ll save that.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t to hype Ian up to an impossible altitude. His results will\nspeak for themselves, or they won\u2019t.\n\nBut given the ambition of his company: to usher in a new age of air travel,\nwin aerospace, and build a $1 trillion business, Ian will have to be as good\nas the Wrights and Kelly Johnson eventually, and even better at building a\nbusiness. Few people make breakthroughs in flight. Few people build trillion\ndollar businesses. The Venn Diagram overlap of the two is exactly 0.\n\nBut Ian wants to become the first. And to do that, he needed to start by\nactually building a team and a thing.\n\n####\n\nEnter Astro Mechanica\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, he started working on that idea for a regular\nsubsonic private jet that could be at cost parity with airliners.\n\nBy 2021, thanks to time spent tinkering with that idea, he realized that a new\ntype of electric adaptive engine would finally be possible thanks to advances\nin the performance of electric motors.\n\nFrom idea to prototype took two months and $200k.\n\n\u201cYou just need to prove the thing you\u2019re trying to prove,\u201d Ian told Christian.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the art of knowing what does and doesn\u2019t matter on this particular\nthing.\u201d\n\nBy October 2022, he raised a round from LowerCarbon Capital. By March 2023,\nfunds in hand, Ian had hired his first aerospace engineers.\n\nAstro Mechanica was moving out of Ian\u2019s head and into a real company.\n\n###\n\nThe Space Mongols\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that I am not an aerospace engineer, so to\nfigure out whether an aerospace engineer like Ian is legit, I need to look for\nclues.\n\nOne clue might be a video of a working prototype, like the one we started the\npiece with.\n\nAnother might be an endorsement from someone like Matt Parlmer.\n\nAnother, more important one is the ability to recruit badass engineers. On\nthat count, Astro Mechanica is legit.\n\nAfter raising from LowerCarbon, Ian spent the next six months looking for a\nrare combination: an engineer who was experienced but not jaded. Too grounded,\nand you end up with an unwillingness to try new things. Too head-in-the-\nclouds, and you end up untethered from reality. And in engineering, reality\nalways wins.\n\nFinally, he found Matt Lehman: an OG SpaceX propulsion engineer who worked on\nOmelek Island setting up Falcon 1. Matt is a hardcore propulsion PhD with over\ntwo decades of experience building rockets at companies including Northrop,\nAstra, and Ventions, but he\u2019s also a surfer who lives in Santa Cruz and is\ndown to try to catch the next wave.\n\nFalcon 1 Lifting off From Omelek Island\n\nWith Matt onboard, the two got to work building out the Dream Team.\n\nThere\u2019s Patrick McGuire, the Lead Engineer, Propulsion, who worked under Matt\nat Astra and Ventions. \u201cYou can throw anything at Patrick and he thinks about\nit appropriately,\u201d Ian said.\n\nThen there\u2019s Tyler Sandberg, who\u2019s worked on propulsion at Blue Origin,\nSpaceX, and Astra. \u201cHe\u2019s like a younger Patrick.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Ian hired his mentor, someone he\u2019s been trying to hire for a\nlong time: Jeff Tiedeken. \u201cElon poached Jeff for Neuralink, he was one of the\nfirst 20 people there and the first person building things. Larry Page hired\nhim at (EVTOL company) KittyHawk. He helped build nuclear reactors at Kairos\nPower and led manufacturing at Astranis.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a degree,\u201d Ian said, \u201cbut everyone knows Jeff is the fucking\nman.\u201d\n\nThe team is now eight people, each of whom is an expert on one thing, but can\ndo most things.\n\nIan compared the way the team works to the Mongol Empire: \u201cEveryone is self-\nsufficient and everyone can do all the things. Everyone is just very capable.\u201d\n\nIan calls them the Space Mongols.\n\nLeft to right: Jeff, Ian, Matt, Patrick\n\nIan thinks that they can get all the way to the flight engine with just nine\npeople \u2013 fewer brains mean less opportunity for losses in communication, so\nit\u2019s better to keep the team small and excellent, for now. But at some point,\nthey will need to scale.\n\nIan pictures the team growing fractally from strong cores.\n\n\u201cApple became more Apple over time as they hired excellent people,\u201d Ian said,\n\u201cI see the same thing starting to happen here.\u201d\n\nThere are three pillars of the business: Engines, Airframes, and Operations.\n\nTo date, they\u2019ve built the core of the Engine team, because without the\nengine, nothing else matters. This core \u2013 the Space Mongols \u2013 will make the\nnext set of hires, which will make the next, and so on out from there.\n\nNext, Ian is replicating the Engine team\u2019s structure to build out the\nAirframes team, which will build the airplanes that the Engine team will bolt\nits baby onto. This team should be about 12 people to get to a working\nairframe.\n\nThen, they\u2019ll replicate the org structure again to hire an Operations team,\nwhich will work with regulators, partners, and customers to get the engines\nand airframes into the sky.\n\nEach one of these core teams will be the foundation for much bigger\norganizations along those same three lines as the company grows. If they get\nthe foundation just right, Ian thinks it should be able to scale up.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear parallel between the way Ian designs physical things and the\nway he designs teams: start with the small model, understand it inside and\nout, understand how each piece trades off with the others, and only when you\nhave a full intuition of the thing: scale it.\n\nOne of the bets on Astro Mechanica is that the same pattern holds for\norganizations, or that Ian will be able to adapt if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut that\u2019s a future problem, one that he\u2019ll have to earn the right to solve.\nFirst, they need to prove that this Turboelectric Adaptive Engine does what\nthey think it can.\n\n####\n\nBut First, the Engine\n\nWith the core team onboard, the past few months at Astro Mechanica have been\nbusy. They raised a $3 million Seed from a16z\u2019s American Dynamism practice and\njoined the YC Winter 24 batch.\n\nMost importantly, they\u2019ve been building the actual flight engine, the first of\nwhat the company hopes will be hundreds or thousands that will climb the\natmosphere like a ladder and ride the specific impulse curve up to Mach 2.7.\n\nAstro Mechanica plans to unveil progress on its engine live at YC Demo day on\nWednesday. Ian gave me a little sneak peek and told me I could show you if you\npromise not to spoil the surprise:\n\nThe company has had as smooth a path as possible to this point in the journey,\nparticularly for a company that\u2019s building a new kind of jet engine. I would\nimagine that VCs are going to be all over it after demo day (and that many are\ntrying to get ahead of that rush as we speak).\n\nVC funding isn\u2019t a goal; it\u2019s a destination. But in the case of this business,\nso much will depend on its ability to find financial partners who support its\nmore-for-more vision of aerospace that financing is as core to the business as\nthe engine itself.\n\nCash is its fuel, and whether it crashes, simply sells a better engine, builds\na nice launch business, or takes the baton from Boeing and drags aerospace\ninto the Turboelectric Age will depend in large part on how it balances its\nown speed and efficiency from here.\n\n###\n\nPursuing Moonshots\n\nFinancialization couldn\u2019t save Boeing, or the airline industry as we know it.\n\nTrying to get more-for-less without technological progress \u2013 more revenue on\nfewer assets by outsourcing, more seats in the same plane by shrinking seats \u2013\nis a one-way ticket to stagnation and decline.\n\nI\u2019ve argued that it\u2019s not Boeing\u2019s fault, or any of the airlines\u2019 fault, but a\nnatural consequence of reaching the end of a technological paradigm that\u2019s had\nso much juice squeezed out of it already. It was inevitable.\n\nAstro Mechanica wants to get more-for-less the right way: through technology.\nMore speed for less cost through adaptive engines. That engine is just the\nstart.\n\nAstro Mechanica plans to:\n\n  * Build a new kind of engine: the Turboelectric Adaptive Engine\n\n  * Use it to launch rockets\n\n  * Use the cash and data from the rockets to build small private supersonic planes\n\n  * Use the cash and data from the private planes to build commercial airliners\n\nIt wants its rockets to fly 1x per week and its private planes to fly 100x per\nweek. To have a rebuild-the-airline-industry impact, its commercial planes\nwill one day have to fly thousands of times per week.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently defensible about an engine design. The\ndefensibility in this business comes from getting to scale quickly, and from\nbuilding a unique business around the engine before anyone else does. Against\nincumbents, it\u2019s counter-positioned, which buys it time to scale, and against\npotential new entrants, it has a head start, a strong team, and the whole\nmaster plan, down to the finest detail, in Andrew\u2019s head.\n\nIn either case, it will need to get big as fast as it can. Turning out\nhundreds of aircraft orders of magnitude faster than they\u2019re assembled today\nwill require manufacturing prowess on par with a Tesla Gigafactory, and like\nTesla, it will require boatloads of cash.\n\nThat\u2019s OK. That\u2019s good. We should give our most ambitious projects the most\nmoney. We should give them more so that they can give us back more, for less.\n\nAstro Mechanica is a Techno-Industrial. It\u2019s using new technology to build\nbetter atoms-based products at a lower cost than was previously possible.\n\nInstead of simply selling cheaper products into the existing web of mediocrity\nthat is the airline industry, Astro Mechanica wants to rebuild the whole\nthing. Of course that\u2019s going to take cash.\n\nI think we\u2019re all scarred from the more-for-less era into believing that costs\ndon\u2019t shrink, that legacy industries don\u2019t get rebuilt, that change only comes\nat the margins.\n\nBut what fact of engineering requires that the way it\u2019s been done is the only\nway it can be done?\n\nBoeing won the Jet Age by harnessing a new technology to reshape an industry,\nand it improved the way billions of passengers travel in the process. That\nit\u2019s stagnating now doesn\u2019t mean that air travel is doomed to decay, but that\nit\u2019s time for a new Age.\n\nBoeing dominated through the period that Tyler Cowen calls The Great\nStagnation, a half-century on a technological plateau defined by many of the\nevils that ate at airlines.\n\nThe Great Stagnation is ending. You can feel it.\n\nSpaceX launches multiple rockets a week. Solar is getting very cheap. EVs are\novertaking gas-powered cars. Ozempic is helping millions lose weight.\n\nMaybe Astro Mechanica will bring affordable supersonic travel to humankind.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take a ton of work, time, capital, luck, skill, and\nadaptability. It will take getting the core of each piece of the business\nright, and then growing fractally out from there while maintaining fidelity\nwith the original thing. It will take becoming great at things that the\ncompany has never done.\n\nIf it really has a more-for-less engine, there are a million ways for Astro\nMechanica to make high-margin revenue in the short-term that require a lot\nless work, time, capital, luck, skill, and adaptability than this crazy plan\nto build The Aerospace Company over decades.\n\nBut if Astro Mechanica really has a more-for-less engine, it must pursue the\nmoonshot. I want to live in a world that supports that pursuit.\n\nThanks to Ian for letting me tell the Astro Mechanica story, to Christian for\ninput and feedback, and to Dan for editing!\n\nThat\u2019s all for today. We\u2019ll be back in your inbox tomorrow with a Weekly Dose.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nPacky\n\n1\n\nFor those curious as to why sound won\u2019t kill Astro, too, here\u2019s what Ian had\nto say:\n\nWe\u2019ll be able to manage the sound issue where concorde couldn\u2019t for 2 reasons.\n\n1\\. The plane is simply much smaller. Concorde was nearly 400,000 lbs. The\namount of air being displaced to generate the pressure wave is substantial\n(it\u2019s why Concorde was worse than any fighter jet). We\u2019ll be between\n50-150,000 lbs.\n\n2\\. Our engine\u2019s efficiency lets us take a hit on a higher drag lower boom\nairframe while still being economical (this is in part also just a perk of\nmodern engineering capability).\n\nAll told the goal is to have a sub 85db aircraft (I believe a reasonable\nlimit). We\u2019ll see if the FAA agrees!\n\n### Subscribe to Not Boring by Packy McCormick\n\nLaunched 5 years ago\n\nMaking the world more optimistic, one ambitious tech company at a time.\n\n66 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n66\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Astro Mechanica\n\nwww.notboring.co\n\n17\n\nShare\n\n17 Comments\n\nCharlie MuirApr 1Liked by Packy McCormickThis is incredible.
