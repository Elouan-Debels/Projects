On other days, I am discouraged by passive-aggressive negative\nreplies.\n\n(I can't blame them. Though I'm doing my best to make my cold emails fresh and\ninteresting, we are all tired of this form of sales prospecting. But I\ndigress.)\n\nThe point is: my motivation is sometimes very high, and sometimes, it is\nnowhere to be found.\n\nThe good news is that I can do my work without motivation.\n\nOver the years, I have developed discipline, and it serves me well. No matter\nhow motivated I am, I do what I'm supposed to do, day in and day out.\n\nI wasn't always this person. As a kid, it took a lot of effort from my\nparents, teachers, and coaches to get me to do what I didn't want. It's no big\ndeal; kids tend to be like that.\n\nMany of us brought this trait of character to adulthood. They postpone doing\ntheir taxes, quitting a bad habit, or checking this long-due task off their\nto-do list. I can't. It makes me feel too bad.\n\nUntil now, I've thought of it as a competitive advantage. I started working at\nseventeen and have since kept in the back of my mind that I needed to\ncompensate for my lack of formal education with hard work. Hard work, it\nseemed, meant doing the things I didn't want to do anyway.\n\nHard work and discipline were profoundly bound, and discipline often prevented\nquestioning the hard work.\n\nBack to this morning. When Joschua astutely asked, \"How's your motivation\nlevel?\" I answered with the rollercoaster emoji.\n\nBut in that very moment, I had a revelation:\n\nWhat are the collateral consequences of working without motivation?\n\nIt doesn't affect the quality of my work (well, at least nothing drastic) It's\nnot about my mood and well-being while working (who cares? No pain, no gain,\nright?)\n\nNo. What suffers from hard work without motivation is the quality of my life\n... when I'm not working!\n\nI could brute force work and treat motivation as optional. I never considered\nits impact on my life outside of work.\n\nWorking without motivation is exhausting. Half of your energy is spent\nfighting your desire to stop. And when the workday is over, all the powering\nthrough leaves you no energy for your personal life.\n\nI don't know you, but I tend to have a much shorter fuse when exhausted.\n\nIrritable, tired, and without energy left for quality time with the family.\nNot who I want to be! But mindless hard work without motivation makes it\nunavoidable.\n\nBut days when I'm motivated are easy. Instead of leaving work deflated, I'm\nstill full of energy. It's as if energy wasn't coming from a battery but\nstraight from the nuclear power plant! It could last forever.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Being disciplined is desirable, especially as an\nentrepreneur. We all ought to do things that are unpleasant but necessary.\n\nDiscipline becomes a problem when it's left unchecked.\n\nGreg Gilbert's notes \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
