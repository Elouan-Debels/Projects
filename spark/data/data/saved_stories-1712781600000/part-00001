This goes along with the\nsource code release on GitHub. Here are the changes (many of these were\ndeployed to this site quite awhile ago):\n\n\\- Used a better webpage for the following page if it's visited by a non\nlogged in user. Previously it was a blank white page with an error message.\n\n\\- Changed the logo in the site header from a castle emoji character to an\nactual image file.\n\n\\- Added a button to the settings page that allows you to reset all the\nsettings to the defaults.\n\n\\- Added responsive design (ie. mobile support) to the posts single-line\nlayout setting.\n\n\\- Changed five of the default settings: site width is now 1200 by default\ninstead of 600; posts single-line layout is used instead of double-line\nlayout; changed posts per page from 20 to 30; decreased the post vertical\nspacing from 18 to 14; and changed the light mode background color.\n\n\\- Added a dark mode. You can select it on the settings page via the theme\noption.\n\n\\- Fixed the username link in the main navigation. Previously it didn't work\nthe first time a user logged in.\n\n\\- Added a date format setting to the settings page. There are 8 different\ndate/time formats that you can use.\n\n\\- There are a handful of other changes that are too minor or technical to\nmention here.\n\nSome comments may be hidden. Show all.\n\nno comments yet\n\n", "frontpage": false}
