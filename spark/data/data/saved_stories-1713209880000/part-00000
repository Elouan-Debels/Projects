The most common reason\ncustomers exceed this limit is by pushing large files. Customers should be\nstoring large files as Git LFS instead of their repository.\n\nA push file size limit helps customers keep their repositories in the most\nperformant state and below the 4 GB size limit by keeping unwanted files\nand/or binary files out of source control.\n\n## What can I do if I run into this limit?\n\nIf you encounter the push file size limit, you have two options:\n\nOption 1 (RECOMMENDED):\n\nAny files included in the push that are over 100 MB can be converted to Git\nLFS to track them outside of the core repository. Learn more about using Git\nLFS with Bitbucket Cloud.\n\nOption 2:\n\nIf using Git LFS is not feasible, the 100 MB push file size limit can be\ndisabled by a repository admin within the Advanced settings in Repository\nsettings.\n\nWARNING: If this limit is disabled, you are at risk of exceeding the 4 GB\nrepository size limit, which will put the repository into read-only mode and\nrequire support intervention to reduce the repository size back below the\nlimit when possible or applicable. This can cause significant disruption to\nyour operations.\n\n## What if I already have files over 100 MB in my repository?\n\nThis limit only applies to pushes. Any files that are over 100 MB and are\nalready in a repository will not be affected, if they are not modified and\nincluded in any pushes. If those large files are being frequently modified, we\nrecommend converting them to LFS where practical or necessary.

There is not a self serve toggle in the UI to request a repo\nsize increase, and there are no short term plans to implement that. If you\nwould like expert advise for your specific use case, please reach out to our\nSupport team, sharing your repository URL and your needs, and our team will\nwork with you on the best possible solution.\n\nLike \u2022 2 people like this\n\n\u6c34\u8d8a \u76f4\u54c9 April 3, 2024 edited\n\n\u300cFile size limits\u300dWhen will this feature be implemented?\n\nLike\n\n### Comment\n\nLog in or Sign up to comment\n\n### Was this helpful?\n\n##### Thanks!\n\nSam Nichols\n\nAtlassian Team\n\nAtlassian Team\n\nAtlassian Team members are employees working across the company in a wide\nvariety of roles.\n\n#### About this author\n\n2 total posts\n\nView profile\n\nBitbucket\n\n###### TAGS\n\n  * bitbucket-cloud\n  * cloud\n\nRelated Community content\n\n  * ## 'unauthorized' when trying git push\n\n  * ## GIT LFS + BitBucket cloud storage space limit and ...\n\n  * ## Why git push/checkout/fetch all failing ?\n\n  * ## git push origin not working\n\n  * ## MacOS M1 - Git LFS files not uploading with push b...\n\n### Upcoming Bitbucket Events\n\n  * #### DevOps in the Box con Atlassian \u2192\n\nApr 22\n\nC\u00f3rdoba, Cordoba (AR)\n\n  * #### How to create smarter CI/CD pipelines: Forge Dev Den \u2192\n\nMay 8\n\nSydney, NSW (AU)\n\nSee all events\n\n  * FAQ\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Terms of use\n  * \u00a9 2024 Atlassian\n\nAuto-suggest helps you quickly narrow down your search results by suggesting\npossible matches as you type.\n\nThis site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience, perform analytics\nand research, and conduct advertising.
