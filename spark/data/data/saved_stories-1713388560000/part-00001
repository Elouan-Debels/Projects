M. Pasquini, Naval Research Laboratory\n\nJonathan Kwolek, Ph.D., a research physicist from the U.S. Naval Research\nLaboratory (NRL) Quantum Optics Section attaches fiber-optic cables to deliver\nlight into the compact laser-delivery system, which is carefully aligned\naround a custom vacuum cell in the NRL Atom Interferometry Lab, Nov. 2, 2023.\nThe apparatus will generate a cold, continuous atomic beam which will be\ndelivered into the larger vacuum chamber to address Navy craft inertial\nnavigation challenges.

Credit: (U.S.\nNavy / Jonathan Steffen)\n\nU.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) researchers have developed a patent-\npending Continuous 3D-Cooled Atom Beam Interferometer derived from a patented\ncold and continuous beam of atoms to explore atom-interferometry-based\ninertial measurement systems as a path to reduce drift in Naval navigation\nsystems.\n\nInertial navigation is a self-contained navigation technique in which\nmeasurements provided by accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to track the\nposition and orientation of an object relative to a known starting point,\norientation and velocity. Quantum inertial navigation is a new field of\nresearch and development that can increase inertial measurement accuracy by\norders of magnitude.\n\n\"Our interferometer operates in a different regime than most other modern\nimplementations of an atom interferometer,\" said Jonathan Kwolek, Ph.D., a\nresearch physicist from the NRL Quantum Optics Section within the Optical\nSciences Division. \"By operating with cold, continuous atoms, we have opened\nthe door to a number of advantages as well as novel measurement techniques.\nUltimately, we would like to use this technology to improve inertial\nnavigation systems, thus reducing our reliance on GPS.\"\n\nEnabled by the unique properties of the atom source, the Continuous 3D-Cooled\nAtom Beam Interferometer exhibits promising measurement characteristics like\nhigh measurement contrast, low noise, and improved handling of variations in\nthe sensor's environment. This technology wields the potential to provide Navy\nthe ability to operate in GPS-denied environments and overcome limitations to\nthe accuracy of GPS.\n\nDepending on the measurement platform, errors in the location estimation will\naccumulate and result in loss of accurate position information. Current\ncommercially available inertial navigation systems, for example, can navigate\nwith an error accumulation of roughly 1 nautical mile over 360 hours. NRL\nintends to develop new technologies to extend that time such that navigational\ndrift does not limit mission duration.\n\n\"The field of inertial navigation aims to provide navigation information\nanywhere GPS is unavailable,\" said NRL Associate Director of Research for\nSystems Dr. Gerald Borsuk. \"The advent of atom interferometry allows for a\nnovel approach in inertial sensing, which has the potential to address some of\nthe deficiencies in current state-of-the-art technologies.\"\n\nGPS has become a backbone to the functionality of both our civilian and\nmilitary world, providing high-accuracy distributed position and timing\ninformation anywhere in the world. However, there are certain battlespace\nenvironments in which GPS cannot function, such as underwater or in space, as\nwell as an increasing threat to GPS availability in the form of jamming,\nspoofing, or anti-satellite warfare.\n\n\"In an ideal world, we hedge against loss of conventional navigation by making\nthe best inertial navigators we can,\" Kwolek said. \"This is to ensure that a\nloss of GPS doesn't allow our ships to become lost in the middle of enemy\nterritory.\"\n\n## Why use atom interferometers?\n\nInterferometers are devices that extract information from interference using\ncoherent waves. This class of device is widely used for the precise\nmeasurements of displacements, refractive index changes and surface\ntopologies. Inertial navigation is used in a wide range of applications\nincluding the navigation of aircraft, tactical and strategic missiles,\nspacecraft, submarines, and ships.\n\nAtomic physics offers a unique toolkit for measuring with extreme precision.\nAtom interferometry is a method within atomic physics in which quantum\ninterference of atomic matter waves is used to measure extremely precise\nchanges in environmental conditions, such as fields or inertial forces.\n\n\"Performing atomic inertial measurements as opposed to a classical measurement\ngives different error dependencies,\" Kwolek said. \"We predict that if done\ncarefully, atomic interferometers will exhibit better long-term noise behavior\nand accuracy than current leading technologies. Translated to the world of\ninertial navigation, this means keeping your location fix for longer providing\nmore operational flexibility.\"\n\nAtom interferometers can also be used to discipline another sensor, much like\nhow clocks are disciplined to GPS. This combination of an interferometer with\na cosensor can enable interferometers to realize a benefit in a real-world\nmeasurement scenario.\n\n\"This is by no means a complete solution,\" Kwolek said. \"There are tradeoffs\nto operating an atomic interferometer, for example, the enhanced sensitivity\ncorrelates to worse dynamic range. We are exploring multiple avenues to\nsolving this problem including cosensor implementation or alternative cold-\natom techniques.\"\n\nThis quantum optics research is sponsored by the NRL Base Program and the\nOffice of Naval Research.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 states that\nquantum technology is approaching a tipping point that will determine how\nquickly it can make an impact. If the United States can stay on pace, many\nimportant outcomes for the Department of Defense (DOD) can be realized\nincluding robust position, navigation and timing for DOD freedom of operations\nwith precision strike even with contests in spectrum, space, or cyber\noperations.\n\n## A Navy less reliant on GPS\n\nNRL has delivered navigation solutions to the fleet since its inception but a\nbreakthrough occurred in the 1960s with the invention of GPS.\n\nNRL launched TIMATION I on May 31, 1967, and TIMATION II on August 30, 1969.\nTIMATION I demonstrated that a surface vessel could be positioned to within\ntwo-tenths of a nautical mile and an aircraft to within three-tenths of a\nnautical mile using range measurements from a time-synchronized satellite.\n\nWhile initially designed for use by the military, GPS has been adapted for\ncivilian navigation needs ranging from commercial aviation to portable\nhandheld and wristwatch-type devices. Today, GPS is a constellation of 32\nEarth-orbiting satellites providing precise navigation and timing data to\nmilitary and civilian end-users around the globe. Despite decades of\ndevelopment of GPS, optimized inertial navigation systems afford the Navy the\nability to mitigate risk against becoming completely reliant on GPS.\n\n\"In the modern era, NRL is one of several research organizations addressing\nnaval inertial navigation challenges,\" said Adam Black, Ph.D., NRL Quantum\nOptics Section Head. \"The lab is taking advantage of advanced atomic and\noptical techniques to invent new architectures for inertial measurement that\npromise accurate navigation of dynamic Navy platforms.\"\n\nProvided by Naval Research Laboratory\n\nCitation: Atom interferometer charters Navy's inertial navigation path to\nreduce drift (2024, April 8) retrieved 17 April 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-04-atom-interferometer-charters-navy-inertial.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
