An effective re-rank method can select the right SQL query from the\n> candidate list and improve the model's performance. Previous studies on code\n> generation automatically generate test cases and use them to re-rank\n> candidate codes. However, automatic test case generation for text-to-SQL is\n> an understudied field. We propose an automatic test case generation method\n> that first generates a database and then uses LLMs to predict the ground\n> truth, which is the expected execution results of the ground truth SQL query\n> on this database. To reduce the difficulty for LLMs to predict, we conduct\n> experiments to search for ways to generate easy databases for LLMs and\n> design easy-to-understand prompts. Based on our test case generation method,\n> we propose a re-rank method to select the right SQL query from the candidate\n> list. Given a candidate list, our method can generate test cases and re-rank\n> the candidate list according to their pass numbers on these test cases and\n> their generation probabilities. The experiment results on the validation\n> dataset of Spider show that the performance of some state-of-the-art models\n> can get a 3.6\\% improvement after applying our re-rank method.\n\nComments:| 8 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2401.02115 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2401.02115v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.02115arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zhenwen Li [view email] [v1] Thu, 4 Jan 2024 07:50:24 UTC (214 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Using LLM to select the right SQL Query from\ncandidates, by Zhenwen Li and 1 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2401\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
