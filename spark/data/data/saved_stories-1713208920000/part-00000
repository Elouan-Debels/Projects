HD Hyundai Heavy Industries will be in charge\nof integrating the hardware and software, and developing the hull.\n\nLooking forward, HD Hyundai and Palantir want to optimize their USV model for\nthe US and Korean markets, and develop an AI-powered platform to manage the\nvessels.\n\nIt was not specified whether that AI platform would make a remote operator\nredundant.\n\nHD Hyundai CEO Wonho Joo enthused that his partnership with Palantir would\n\"pioneer this field based on the achievements and trust that both companies\nhave built up so far.\"\n\nHe was alluding to previous collaborations \u2013 including a $20 million five-year\ndeal for the digital transformation of South Korean shipbuilders.\n\nPalantir does plenty of work for military agencies: it recently won a $178\nmillion US Army contract to build a mobile battlefield intelligence system.\n\nIt also offers analytics wares, such as those acquired to power the NHS\nFederated Data Platform. That deal earned criticism amidst fears Palantir\ncould gain access to sensitive data. And who can forget allegations that\nPalantir helped Cambridge Analytica to analyze its ill-gotten data? \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Palantir\n  * South Korea\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Palantir\n  * South Korea\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * NAVER\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n6 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Palantir\n  * South Korea\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Palantir\n  * South Korea\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * NAVER\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Google Cloud chief is really psyched about this AI thing\n\nCloud Next We're on a highway to ML\n\nPaaS + IaaS6 days | 6\n\n#### AI spam is winning the battle against search engine quality\n\ninterview 'Not all AI content is spam, but I think right now all spam is AI\ncontent'\n\nAI + ML2 days | 31\n\n#### Naver debuts multilingual HyperCLOVA X LLM it will use to build sovereign\nAI for Asia\n\nBecause English isn't the only language\n\nAI + ML7 days |\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Intel CEO suggests AI can help to create a one-person Unicorn\n\nIntel Vision And possibly replace entire business units too\n\nAI + ML5 days | 36\n\n#### Tech titans assemble to decide which jobs AI should cut first\n\nBut don't worry, if tech takes your job, we'll retrain you\n\nAI + ML11 days | 64\n\n#### Hailo's latest AI chip shows up integrated NPUs and sips power like fine\nwine\n\nAll your PC needs for 40 TOPS is an M.2 slot\n\nSystems5 days | 6\n\n#### Palantir and Oracle buddy up on cloud infrastructure\n\nBut do all Foundry workloads move to OCI?
