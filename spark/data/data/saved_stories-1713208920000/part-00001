Without\nmuch knowledge or awareness about posture, we might consciously or\nunconsciously sit in a bad posture for hours, putting our muscles and joints\nunder unnecessary stress. This habit can make our posture worse without us\nrealizing it until, one day, we look in the mirror and realize how bad our\nposture has become, or even worse when our health has been affected by it.\n\nHaving a good posture is not simply a cosmetic issue. It is not just a \u201cbad\nlook.\u201d There are a lot of health issues caused by a bad posture that might\naffect our working performance and our daily lives, such as back pain, neck\npain, fatigue, headache, and jaw pain, and it can cause breathing problems as\nwell. To prevent further complications from poor posture, we need to have\nsufficient knowledge about it and know how to overcome this problem.\n\n## Fixing Your Posture as a Programmer\n\n### 1\\. Postural Awareness\n\nTo maintain good posture and prevent a poor one, we need to develop a habit of\ncorrecting the way we carry our body whenever we are aware that we are sitting\nor standing incorrectly. By creating this habit, rather than waiting for back\nand neck pain as our body\u2019s alarm system to fix our stance quickly, we can fix\nit before we cure it. To do that, we must first be aware of how to bear our\nbodies correctly.\n\nA good body posture when standing is indicated by having our ears line up with\nthe middle of our shoulders, our upper and lower back should be straight, and\nour hip should be aligned with our shoulders and knees.\n\nStanding posture (Eversharp Physical Therapy)\n\nOn the other hand, a good sitting posture should be straight back, buttocks\ntouching the back of our chairs, and 3 normal back curves (cervical, thoracic,\nand lumbar curve) should be present.\n\nSitting posture (Moramarco Chiropractic)\n\nBeing conscious of our body when we are too focused on our coding is not easy.\nWhen too concentrated on work, we often lose awareness of our surroundings and\nourselves. We start to slouch or hunch on our seats, and who knows for how\nlong.\n\nTherefore, we should train ourselves to be more mindful of our bodies. We\ncould do this by having a postural check alarm every 10-15 minutes and\nadjusting our posture accordingly whenever we sense an issue. By doing this,\nwe will start developing a habit of checking and being more mindful.\n\n### 2\\. Working Space Adjustments\n\nOur working space is where we spend most of our time. Having a comfortable one\nwill not only increase our productivity but also immensely affect our posture\nfor the better or worse. Sometimes we only think about comfort but do not\nrealize that it damages our posture.\n\nA good working space should support and help our body maintain good posture.\nThe working table, chair, laptop, and computer should all be adjusted to our\nbodies. These days an adjustable working table is popular as we can adjust its\nheight to match ours. So, if you have one, try also switching between working\nwhile standing or sitting. A good working table should be able to support our\narms bent in an L shape and equipped with a chair having arm support to\nmaintain the shape. Moreover, the top of our laptop or computer screen should\nbe set up to 2 to 3 inches below eye level, while the distance between the\ndevice and our body should be about an arm\u2019s length away.\n\nTo support our back while working, we also need a working chair adjusted to\nthe body. A good working chair should have lumbar support, but if we don\u2019t\nhave one, we can buy a lumbar support pillow. Moreover, the chair should not\nbe too high to ensure that our feet are flat on the ground. However, if the\nchair is too high and the feet are hanging, we could add a footrest to support\nthem.\n\nCorrect sitting posture (Ergo-Dimensions)\n\n### 3\\. Move and Stretch\n\nAlthough we already maintain good posture while working, doing it for hours\nwithout moving at all will not be good for the body. It might be even worse\nthan when we walk with poor posture. Therefore, it is important to take\nregular small breaks. Getting yourself some water or snacks or doing anything\nelse that makes you leave your desks for a while is good so that we can move\nour bodies. It is also suggested to stretch every hour to loosen the stiffened\nmuscles. Some people also start doing yoga poses at their desks (and it\u2019s\npossible!).\n\nSome people may think that they do not have time to take short breaks and may\neven skip their lunch. Having a tight schedule or deadline and being stuck in\nthe middle of a bug or feature fixing are some common excuses that prevent\nthem from getting away from their working space. However, skipping breaks can\nlead to higher stress levels and burnout. A study at the University of\nIllinois (2011) reported that taking a break can reset our brain\u2019s ability to\nfocus and pay attention, which can improve mental focus when we return from\nour breaks. This is why to stay sharp and creative; we need to step down for a\nwhile for a needed break to launch our fullest potential when working.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMaintaining a good posture as a programmer who spends hours sitting down daily\nis not easy, especially if we are in the middle of a hectic project and our\nfocus is solely invested in our work. However, with all the health risks that\nare haunting the sedentary habit, it is something that we definitely need to\nwork on. Moreover, by changing our habits, not only will we physically benefit\nfrom them, but our mental health and productivity will improve as well. We\nalso need to remember that our health is more valuable than our work. If we\nare not physically and mentally healthy, then how are we going to do our work\nproperly? Working hard is important but being healthy should always be our\npriority.\n\n### References\n\nEversharp Physical Therapy. 2022.
