It affects\n6 million people in the United States and 50 million people worldwide.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques\n(A\u03b2), an increase in tau protein neurofibrillary tangles, and a loss of\nsynapses. Since the 1990s, removing and reducing A\u03b2 has been the focus of\nAlzheimer\u2019s treatment and prevention research. The accumulation of A\u03b2 can lead\nto oxidative stress, inflammation, neurotoxicity, and eventually apoptosis.\nThese insults impair signaling systems in the brain, potentially leading to\nmemory loss and cognitive decline. Aniracetam is a safe, effective, cognitive-\nenhancing drug that improves memory in both human and animal studies.\nAniracetam may prevent the production and accumulation of A\u03b2 by increasing\n\u03b1-secretase activity through two distinct pathways: 1) increasing brain\nderived neurotrophic factor expression and 2) positively modulating\nmetabotropic glutamate receptors. This is the first paper to propose an\nevidence-based model for aniracetam reducing the accumulation and production\nof A\u03b2.\n\nAniracetam is a known cognitive enhancer whose pharmacological mechanisms are\nnot fully understood. The main metabolites of aniracetam are N-anisoyl-\u03b3-\naminobutyric acid (N-anisoyl-GABA), 2-pyrrolidinone and anisic acid [1].\nAniracetam modulates metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and\n\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive\nglutamate receptors, and it increases cholinergic activity in the hippocampus,\nprefrontal cortex, and striatum [2]. It also protects against glutamate\nexcitotoxicity [3]. Aniracetam, in combination with AMPA, increases brain-\nderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [4], an important trophic factor in the\nbrain that supports healthy memory, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis [5]. A\nrecent study from 2023 found that aniracetam, when combined with perampanel,\nreduces inflammation, and increases BDNF [6]. Research in humans and animals\nfinds aniracetam has excellent safety, tolerability, and few drug\ninteractions, making it an ideal candidate for the prevention and treatment of\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [1, 7].\n\n## ALPHA-SECRETASE\n\nThe majority of AD drugs have attempted to treat and prevent AD by reducing A\u03b2\n[8]. Many of these drugs have attempted to inhibit \u03b2-secretase as a means of\nreducing A\u03b2 production [9]. Unfortunately, clinical trials using this approach\nhave failed. Also, because \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretases both have multiple\nsubstrates other than amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP), they are not ideal\nfor AD treatment.\n\nTargeting \u03b1-secretase activity is attractive therapeutically for AD because\nincreasing \u03b1-secretase cleavage of A\u03b2PP has multiple positive effects\nregarding AD pathology [10]. First, cleaving A\u03b2PP with \u03b1-secretase prevents A\u03b2\nliberation. Second, \u03b1-secretase cleavage of A\u03b2PP produces sA\u03b2PP\u03b1, which is\nknown to be neuroprotective [11]. Specifically, sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 plays important roles\nin neuronal plasticity and survival: 1) it protects hippocampal neurons\nagainst excitotoxicity, 2) it protects neurons from A\u03b2 toxicity, and 3) it\nprotects neurons from hypoglycemic damage [12]. Third, there may be other\nneuroprotective downstream effects of upregulating \u03b1-secretase activity. For\nexample, \u03b1-secretase is involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines [13], and increasing \u03b1-secretase may reduce inflammation.\nInflammation is a well-established risk factor for AD [14]. Because of the\nmultiple neuroprotective effects of \u03b1-secretase, enhancing \u03b1-secretase\nactivation is likely to help prevent AD [15].\n\nIt is important to note that \u03b1-secretase has multiple downstream substrates,\nand little is known about the signaling pathways that may stimulate\n\u03b1-secretase cleavage of A\u03b2PP [16].\n\nEvidence suggests that aniracetam has the potential to increase \u03b1-secretase\nactivity, thereby reducing A\u03b2 production, via two distinct pathways: first, by\nincreasing activity of BDNF, and second, by positively modulating metabotropic\nglutamate receptors (mGluRs). Both BDNF and positive modulation of mGluRs\nincrease \u03b1-secretase activity and decrease A\u03b2 [17\u201319].\n\n## AMYLOID-\u03b2 PLAQUES\n\nExcess A\u03b2 is believed to be a significant contributor to the dysfunction that\noccurs in AD [20, 21]. Accumulation of A\u03b2 damages neurons and synapses and\noften contributes to neuroinflammation [22, 23]. Specifically, A\u03b2 can lead to\noxidative stress, inflammation, neurotoxicity, and eventually apoptosis. These\ninsults impair signaling systems in the brain, potentially leading to memory\nloss and cognitive decline [24, 25]. Aniracetam, a known nootropic and\ncognitive enhancer [1, 2, 26], has the potential to reduce A\u03b2 by facilitating\nthe non-amyloidogenic processing of A\u03b2PP by elevating \u03b1-secretase activity via\nincreasing BDNF and modulating mGluRs.\n\nA\u03b2 is a 39 to 43 amino acid peptide derived from A\u03b2PP [27]. There are three\nknown proteases that cleave A\u03b2PP: \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-secretases. A\u03b2 is created when\nA\u03b2PP is cleaved by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase [23]. When A\u03b2PP is cleaved at\nthe beta, gamma, and caspase sites, the result is four peptides: sA\u03b2PP\u03b2\n(soluble A\u03b2PP cleaved at the beta site), A\u03b2, Jcasp (the juxtamembrane peptide\ncleaved at the caspase site) and C31 (the final 31 amino acids of the protein)\n[28]. When A\u03b2PP is cleaved at the alpha site by \u03b1-secretase, the result is\nsA\u03b2PP\u03b1 (soluble A\u03b2PP cleaved at the \u03b1 site) and \u03b1CTF (carboxyterminal\nfragment), an 83-amino acid chain which is subsequently cleaved by \u03b3-secretase\nproducing A\u03b2PP intracellular domain (AICD) and P3 peptides [23, 29]. sA\u03b2PP\u03b1\nhas neuroprotective properties [11, 30]. When A\u03b2PP is cleaved by \u03b1-secretase,\nthe production of A\u03b2 is prevented. Therefore, increasing \u03b1-secretase activity\nis a potential pathway for decreasing A\u03b2 production and accumulation, as well\nas increasing neuroprotective sA\u03b2PP\u03b1. Indeed, brains of AD patients are\ndeficient in \u03b1-secretase [31], a deficiency in \u03b1-secretase levels accelerates\nAD pathology [29], and increasing \u03b1-secretase activity decreases A\u03b2 production\n[32, 33].\n\nIt is important to note that simply reducing A\u03b2 is not necessarily beneficial\nto cognition or helpful in the treatment of AD. Many drugs that reduce A\u03b2 have\nfailed to benefit humans in clinical trials. Since 2018, nine drugs that\ndirectly reduced A\u03b2 have failed in Phase III trials [8]. And not all drugs\nthat elevate \u03b1-secretase activity lower A\u03b2 in vivo or show benefit in clinical\ntrials (e.g., Etazolate) [34]. There remain many unknowns in the field of AD\nresearch and A\u03b2 biochemistry.\n\n## BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR\n\nAniracetam increases BDNF [4]. Aniracetam is a well-established positive\nmodulator of AMPA receptors [35\u201339], specifically in the dentate gyrus and CA1\nregions of the hippocampus [40]. Aniracetam also slows the desensitization of\nAMPA receptors and enhances synaptic plasticity [36, 41]. Aniracetam\nadministered with AMPA increases BDNF release and enhances BDNF gene\nexpression; AMPA+aniracetam increased BDNF levels 1.5-fold, and levels\nremained elevated 6 hours later [4]. Researchers have suggested that part of\nthe efficacy of aniracetam is its ability to increase BDNF, likely through\nmGluR modulation and increased cholinergic activity [2].\n\nThere is a strong and consistent association between increased BDNF and\nreduced levels of A\u03b2 [17, 18]. A 2017 study by Mark Mattson and colleagues\nfound that BDNF reduces A\u03b2 by enhancing a pathway that involves \u03b1-secretase.\nSpecifically, researchers treated in vitro cultured cells with BDNF and found\na significant reduction in both A\u03b2_40 and A\u03b2_42, compared to control cultures.\nResearchers concluded that BDNF reduces A\u03b2 levels by increasing \u03b1-secretase\nactivity. Interestingly, and surprisingly, their research found that\nincreasing \u03b1-secretase cleavage of APP by increasing BDNF did not directly\nincrease ADAM10 [16].\n\nA 2022 study found that BDNF helps regulate A\u03b2PP processing, likely through\n\u03b1-secretase [42]. Indeed, treating cultures with BDNF decreased A\u03b2_40 by\n1.32-fold, decreased A\u03b2_42 levels by 2.15-fold, and increased sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 by\n1.50-fold [42]. Retinoic acid, a trophic metabolite of vitamin A, when\ncombined with BDNF, increases sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 production. Investigators concluded that\nthis increase was due to retinoic acid and BDNF shifting A\u03b2PP processing in\nfavor of the neuroprotective \u03b1-secretase pathway [43].\n\nConversely, low levels of BDNF are associated with an increased risk of AD.\nIndeed, those with AD have significantly lower levels of BDNF in their blood\nthan healthy controls [44]. Some researchers speculate that BDNF may also\ndecrease BACE1, which would decrease \u03b2-secretase cleavage and reduce A\u03b2\nliberation [43].\n\nBDNF has other neuroprotective properties relevant to AD outside of its\nability to elevate \u03b1-secretase activity and reduce A\u03b2. BDNF plays a crucial\nrole in supporting the function and survival of neurons that deteriorate in\nthe advanced stages of AD. BDNF protects against excitotoxicity, promotes\nregeneration of dendrites, and reduces apoptosis [45, 46]. A 2023 study found\nthat BDNF helps protect both mitochondria and neurons. Specifically, BDNF was\nfound to improve mitochondrial function, protect neurons from oxidative\nstress, and protect dendrites [47]. This is highly relevant to AD because\noxidative stress and degeneration of mitochondrial function is associated with\ncognitive decline and increased risk of AD [48\u201350].\n\nIn the human brain, BDNF exists in two forms: the BDNF precursor, proBDNF, and\nmature BDNF. Existing research has demonstrated a significant reduction in\nboth proBDNF and mature BDNF in the brain during the late stages of AD.\nSpecifically, proBDNF is reduced by 30% in AD brains, and mature BDNF is\nreduced by 62% in AD brains. This decrease in BDNF is also associated with a\ndecline in cognition [51].\n\nBy enhancing BDNF expression, aniracetam shows promise as a potential\ntreatment for AD by reducing A\u03b2 plaque, enhancing mitochondrial function, and\nsupporting the survival of neurons.\n\n## METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS\n\nL-glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous\nsystem (CNS). mGluRs, which are classified as neuromodulatory receptors, offer\na means for glutamate to regulate cell excitability and synaptic transmission\nthrough second messenger signaling pathways. Essentially, mGluRs modulate\nsynaptic transmission and neuronal excitability throughout the CNS.\n\nGlutamate and mGluRs may play an important role in AD [52]. Modulating mGluRs\nmay help with AD in the following ways: 1) increase \u03b1-secretase activity and\nreduce A\u03b2 formation, 2) protect against excitotoxicity, 3) reduce oxidative\nstress, and 4) enhance neuroplasticity [53, 54].\n\nAniracetam has the potential to reduce A\u03b2 plaques by enhancing \u03b1-secretase\nactivity by increasing mGluR activity. Aniracetam potentiates mGluR activity\n[2, 3, 55], and mGluR activation increases A\u03b2PP processing into non-\namyloidogenic A\u03b2PPs in the hippocampus in rats [19]. Though other evidence\nsuggests mGluRs stimulation may increase A\u03b2 plaques [56].\n\nThe neurochemistry of aniracetam is not well understood, and it is not known\nwhich specific mGluRs aniracetam modulates. Group I mGluRs activation\nincreases \u03b1-secretase activity [57]. Group III mGluRs activation facilitates\nnon-amyloidogenic cleavage of A\u03b2PP, may increase BDNF levels, and helps remove\nextracellular A\u03b2 via glial phagocytosis [58]. Activating group III mGluRs may\nalso increase \u03b1-secretase and inhibit \u03b2-secretase expression [59].\nInterestingly, downregulating Group 5 mGluRs may have neuroprotective effects\nand may be helpful in the treatment of AD [60].\n\nIndeed, a 2020 article in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease detailed the\ntherapeutic potential of modulating mGluRs for the treatment and prevention of\nAD [53].\n\n## SIDE EFFECTS\n\nAniracetam is well-tolerated in most clinical trials and does not increase\nliver enzymes [1]. However, it is not without side effects. The most common\nadverse events reported with aniracetam use were unrest, anxiety, uneasiness,\nand insomnia. Other unwanted side effects include urinary urgency, headache,\nvertigo, mild stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, and rash. In clinical trials\nthese effects were considered mild and did not necessitate withdrawal from the\nstudy [1].\n\nAniracetam is well-tolerated in the majority of clinical trials. One study of\n109 elderly subjects took aniracetam or placebo for six months. Researchers\nwrote, \u201cTolerability of aniracetam was excellent\u201d [61]. Another study of 115\nsubjects took aniracetam or placebo for six months. Researchers reported\nexcellent tolerability [62].\n\nDespite the high tolerability in clinical trials, healthcare practitioners are\nreporting unpleasant side effects in patients taking aniracetam. If the side\neffects of aniracetam are significantly impairing the quality of life,\nespecially if they are impairing sleep\u2014which is essential to brain health and\nmemory consolidation\u2014it is important for the patient and practitioner to\ndetermine if the cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective benefits of\naniracetam are worth enduring the side effects.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nAniracetam is a known cognitive enhancer and positive modulator of AMPA\nreceptors and mGluRs. Multiple studies indicate that aniracetam likely\nincreases \u03b1-secretase activity by increasing BDNF expression and positively\nmodulating mGluRs. No research could be found in human or animal studies\ninvestigating the impact of aniracetam on A\u03b2 accumulation or production. To\nthe author\u2019s knowledge, this paper is the first evidence-based model proposing\nthat aniracetam lowers A\u03b2 production and accumulation.\n\n## LIMITATIONS\n\nThere is much we do not know regarding AD neurobiochemistry. Researchers\ngenerally agree that cleaving A\u03b2PP with \u03b1-secretase will be neuroprotective by\nreducing A\u03b2. However, there remain multiple unknown aspects of A\u03b2PP,\n\u03b1-secretase, and A\u03b2 biology. For example, which \u03b1-secretases effectively\ncleave A\u03b2PP to produce neuroprotective sA\u03b2PP\u03b1, and which ones do not? What are\nall of the downstream substrates of \u03b1-secretase, and what are the impacts of\nchronically elevating \u03b1-secretase? To what extent does modulating \u03b1-secretase\naffect levels of inflammation (e.g., TNF)? Clinical trials lasting six months\nreport that aniracetam is well tolerated [61, 62], though this does not\nguarantee that there are no long-term negative impacts of chronically\nupregulating \u03b1-secretase.\n\nIndeed, increasing \u03b1-secretase activity may be a double-edged sword. Cleaving\nA\u03b2PP with \u03b1- and \u03b3-secretases does prevent the production of A\u03b2, and it also\ncreates the peptides sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 and P3. While sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 has neuroprotective effects,\nP3 may be neurotoxic. P3 has demonstrated neurotoxic effects in vitro,\nspecifically increasing neuronal apoptosis [63]. Recent research from 2020\nfound P3 to have amyloidogenic properties [64].\n\nThe biochemistry of aniracetam is not fully understood. Aniracetam modulates\nmGluRs, but does it modulate group I and/or group III mGluRs to the point of\nincreasing \u03b1-secretase expression and increasing A\u03b2 clearance? We do not know\nwhich \u03b1-secretase (e.g., ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM19) aniracetam upregulates, nor\nwhich \u03b1-secretases cleave A\u03b2PP. Does aniracetam as a monotherapy, or used in\ntandem with other cholinergics or BDNF agonists, significantly reduce A\u03b2 and\nslow down the progression of AD?\n\n## FUTURE RESEARCH\n\nBecause aniracetam has known cognitive and behavioral benefits in humans with\nmild cognitive impairment and early-stage AD [1, 61,65, 66], and aniracetam\nhas a high level of tolerability and safety, human clinical trials could start\nimmediately. I recommend starting with a 6-month crossover trial in adults\nwith mild cognitive impairment. Ideally, researchers would measure cognition,\nserum BDNF levels, and A\u03b2 using PET scans, at baseline and at every three\nmonths of the study. Subjects would be given 1,500 mg/day of aniracetam, taken\nwith a source of fat to increase bioavailability (e.g., coconut oil, olive\noil, or with food). To reduce potential side-effects, subjects could take a\nmethylated B-complex vitamin and 1,200 mg of Alpha GPC with their aniracetam\ndose.\n\nFurther research is required to specify which mGluRs aniracetam modulates and\nwhich specific \u03b1-secretase or secretases aniracetam activates. Future animal\nstudies could also investigate the downstream impact of chronically increasing\n\u03b1-secretase activity. I recommend starting by investigating if a daily dose of\naniracetam (50 mg/kg) in rats significantly increases BDNF expression and\nwhich specific mGluRs groups aniracetam modulates.\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nRobert William Love (Conceptualization; Writing \u2013 original draft; Writing \u2013\nreview & editing).\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI want to thank my parents, Bob and Angie, for their years of love and\nsupport.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the work of Dr. Dale Bredesen, Dr. Heather\nSandison, and all researchers and neuroscientists investigating how to prevent\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease.
