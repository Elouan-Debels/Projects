But it will not leave as easily.\n\nThere is Radical Simplicity though.\n\nOne way to simplify your stack and reduce the moving parts, speed up\ndevelopment, lower the risk and deliver more features in your startup is \u201cUse\nPostgres for everything\u201d. Postgres can replace\u2014up to millions of users\u2014many\nbackend technologies, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Mongo and Redis among them.\n\nThis makes every application easier to develop, scale and operate.\n\nLess moving parts means fewer developers for parts that don\u2019t provide value or\njust replicate existing functionality (frontend) and more developers on parts\n(like the backend) that does provide value to customers. What if you could\nincrease feature output by 50% without higher costs? For developers: What\nabout a lower cognitive load? You really deeply understand all moving parts?\nNo more imposter syndrome?\n\n## Just Use Postgres\n\n  * Use Postgres for caching instead of Redis with UNLOGGED tables and TEXT as a JSON data type. Use stored procedures or do as I do, use ChatGPT to write them for you, to add and enforce an expiry date for the data just like in Redis.\n\n  * Use Postgres as a message queue with SKIP LOCKED instead of Kafka (if you only need a message queue). Or as a job queue in Go with River\n\n  * Use Postgres with Timescale as a data warehouse.\n\n  * Use Postgres with pg_analytics as an in memory OLAP with Apache Datafusion\n\n  * Use Postgres with JSONB to store Json documents in a database, search and index them - instead of Mongo.\n\n  * Use Postgres as a cron demon to take actions at certain times, like sending mails, with pg_cron adding events to a message queue.\n\n  * Use Postgres for Geospacial queries.\n\n  * Use Postgres for Fulltext Search instead of Elastic.\n\n  * Use Postgres to generate JSON in the database, write no server side code and directly give it to the API.\n\n  * Use Postgres with auditing with pgaudit\n\n  * Use Postgres with a GraphQL adapter to deliver GraphQL if needed.\n\nThere I\u2019ve said it, just use Postgres for everything.\n\n## CTO Newsletter\n\n### Join more than 2000 CTOs and Engineering Managers\n\nBooks By Stephan Amazing CTO Book Other Articles\n\nSelfhealing Code for Startup CTOs and Solo Founders\n\nScrum is no longer fit with remote work\n\nThree Fundamentals of Software Estimation\n\nProcrastination Does Not Exist\n\nKeyboard with Display for Developers - Kwumsy K3\n\nOther Articles\n\nMisconceptions about the CPTO role\n\n\ud83e\uddb9 We see the AI Endgame for Software Engineering\n\nThe AI Manager - The End of Programming\n\nBest Books for a CTO\n\nThe Luck Formula\n\nMy CTO Book | Contact: stephan@amazingcto.com | Privacy | Impressum\n\n", "frontpage": false}
