For months, he's spent a rough total of 20 hours on the phone\nwith her, professing his love as he tries to get her to invest her millions in\na house on the Moon. But the rambling Edna has been testing his patience with\nher absurd questions and tangents.\n\nWhen the scammer insists they marry in Nigeria, a place he says he's never\nbeen, Kitboga drops the act.\n\nRelated Story: 8 simple things you can do to protect yourself from getting\nscammed\n\n\"Interesting, 'cause all of your IP addresses are there,\" Kitboga says on a\nlivestream, his voice now deeper, after switching off a voice changer. The\nna\u00efve Edna character is one of the many disguises devised by Kitboga, the\nalias of a computer software engineer-turned-Twitch streamer, to lure scammers\ninto his traps.\n\n### Americans lost a record $12.5 billion to internet crimes last year\n\nKitboga, also called Kit, is a millennial with a knack for improvisation. He's\namong the most popular of so-called scam baiters, a term used to describe\nthose who aim to waste scammers' time otherwise spent ripping off innocent\nvictims. It's a lucrative gig for some of the biggest creators in the genre\nwho, like Kit, have quit their jobs to scam bait full-time, often broadcasting\ntheir humorous schemes on YouTube and Twitch. As internet scams spike, with\nvictims losing more money than ever, scam baiters like Kitboga are trying to\nget more than just laughs.\n\nAmericans lost a record $12.5 billion to internet crimes last year, according\nto the FBI's latest annual report, marking a 22% jump from 2022. The bureau\nsays that number is likely higher because so many crimes go unreported. Law\nenforcement agencies lack the resources to investigate the majority of\ninternet-based fraud, and few victims see their money returned.\n\nBut, like others in the world of scam baiting, Kitboga figures that the longer\nhe can keep fraudsters on the line, the fewer victims fall prey to these\nscams.\n\nKitboga reveals the ridiculous lengths scammers will go to steal from the\nvulnerable. The episodes lend themselves to teaching moments for the viewers\ntuned into his streams. He breaks down the latest scams he encounters, from\nhis own investigations or tips from his subscribers, sometimes learning as he\ngoes. To his 1.2 million Twitch followers \u2014 a count he's doubled on YouTube \u2014\nhe's shed light on some of the most rampant and costliest cyber threats, from\ntech support and gift card fraud, to pig butchering scams. Pig butchering is a\ncombination of a romance and an investment scam, usually involving\ncryptocurrency, in which the scammer slowly works to gain the trust of their\nvictim before convincing them to invest money they'll never get back.\n\nRelated Story: He lost $340,000 to a crypto scam.

The bot was an early scam baiter:\nLenny wastes the time of spammers and scammers as the recorded voice of a\nforgetful old man spits out lines prompted by pauses on the other end.\n\nIt was then that Kit realized that tech support scams were a thing. He thought\nof his grandmother, whose dementia made her a more vulnerable target, and his\ngrandfather with Alzheimer's.\n\n\"I work on computers all day. If I don't know this exists, my grandparents\ndefinitely don't know,\" he said. \"And there was just this spark of maybe I\ncould do something about it.\"\n\nScammers had been taking advantage of his grandmother, he learned. She was\npaying for multiple cable and internet packages. He said \"sketchy\" people were\nshowing up at her house on her dime, doing unnecessary tasks.\n\nBut as Edna, a character modeled after his grandma, he realized he could\nmanipulate the scammers.\n\n\"The initial drive or mission was, if I spent 10 minutes on the phone, then\nthat was 10 minutes that that scammer wasn't talking to my grandma or your\ngrandma,\" he said.\n\nFriends encouraged him to stream his calls with scammers on Twitch. Since\nthen, he said he's helped several victims escape the hold of scammers and\ndisrupted large fraud operations.\n\n### Getting back stolen money is rare. But reporting scams to authorities\nincreases your chances\n\nOn a good day, Kitboga gathers enough intel from the scammer that he then\nreports to the authorities. Scammers, seeing him as an unsuspecting victim,\nwill occasionally give up bank account details, cryptocurrency wallet\naddresses and other identifying information that he said he shares in his\nreports to banking authorities, in complaints to the FBI, and in direct\ncommunications with law enforcement.\n\n\"If they think you're falling for their scams, they end up giving way too much\ninformation sometimes,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI and the Secret Service did not confirm to NPR whether it has agents\nworking with Kitboga or any other scam bait streamers, saying it doesn't\ncomment on specific activities. The bureau encourages victims to promptly\nreport online scams to its Internet Crime Complaint Center, iC3.gov. The FBI\nuses those complaints to build cases against cybercriminals. Of the small\npercentage of overall crimes it does look into, the bureau has a relatively\nhigh success rate of stopping scams. Last year, the FBI's recovery unit was\nable to freeze roughly 71% of the $758 million stolen in fraud crimes it\ninvestigated.\n\nAs to how to fight fraud, strategies differ among scam baiters. The ethics of\nhow far to take the trolling are debated in online forums. Some have\nquestioned the murky practices of Pierogi, the alias of another popular\nstreamer in the scambaiting world, who is known for having more of a vigilante\nstreak. Another has faced legal repercussions for his tactics. Thomas Dorsher,\nwho ran the YouTube channel ScammerBlaster to document his efforts in\npunishing illegal robocallers, was fined by the FCC for running his own\nillegal robocalling scheme.\n\nAmong scam baiters, Kitboga is known for toeing the line: \"I kind of treat it\nlike, well, if it's illegal for me I shouldn't do it,\" he said.\n\nEven so, Jerri Williams, a retired FBI agent, advises scam baiters to be\ncautious. As a veteran fraud investigator who has worked major telemarketing\ncases, she said, \"I wouldn't recommend this at all.\"\n\n### Scam baiters should be cautious as some scammers may do more than defraud\npeople\n\nYou don't always know who's on the other side of the phone. Although streamers\nlargely target call center scammers who have rudimentary hacking skills,\nthere's a chance it could be a con artist capable of doxing the scam baiter,\nWilliams said. Some scammers, she added, are not willingly defrauding people,\nbut are victims of human trafficking operations.\n\n\"When you're playing around with people whose job it is to be a criminal, you\nneed to really think about what are you attempting to do,\" she said. \"If it's\ntruly just to entertain followers then, no, I don't think it's the right thing\nto do at all.\"\n\nFor many people who watch Kit's content, the amusement factor was the Trojan\nHorse to real information they say helps them stay alert to scams.\n\nDylon Cai, 40, said he's a lot wiser to the various scams out there after\ncoming across Kitboga's channel. Years ago, he was ensnared in a tech support\nscam that caused him to lose all of his college work on his laptop.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" he said. \"At that time, YouTube was just starting out. I\nreally wish that somebody was actually able to share this kind of content to\nme. That would have prevented that experience I had.\"\n\nCindy, who doesn't want to use her last name due to the threat of scams, said\nscammers hounded her late parents' phone line after she became the executor of\ntheir estates. A search for answers took her to Kitboga's Twitch stream.\n\n\"I started off trying to find solutions but then I began to love the\nentertainment portion of it,\" she said. \"He's just very addictive to watch and\nI get a little schadenfreude from seeing [scammers] get their comeuppance.\"\n\nCindy, who at 64 is on the older side of the scam baiter's predominately\nmillennial viewership, has since joined Kit's team of volunteers, helping\npromote his content and keep track of his anti-scam sagas. She said her\nhusband, who doesn't watch Kit's content, now looks to her when he's\nconfronted with suspicious activity online.\n\n\"He comes to me, he's like, 'What's this?' And I'm like, 'Oh, that's a scam,'\n\" she said. \"I feel empowered, you know.\"\n\nKit has taken a more proactive approach in his latest schemes, which have\nallowed him to thwart scammers even while he's sleeping. He's set up a\n\"honeypot\" trap, created with artificial intelligence, that sends scammers\nthrough a series of unending verification steps in search of non-existent\nstolen Bitcoin accounts.\n\nRecently, he also released anti-scam software. \"I've seen how devastating they\n[scams] can be,\" Kitboga said, \"but also learned \u2014 going back to my grandma \u2014\nhow I could stop someone from ever getting on her computer in the first\nplace.\"\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
