The emulator rose\ntowards the top of the App Store charts following its release this weekend,\nbut users on social media complained that the app was a blatant ripoff\noverlaid with ads.\n\n\"So apparently Apple approved a knock-off of GBA4iOS,\" said Testut, in a\nThreads post on Saturday. \"I did not give anyone permission to do this, yet\nit's now sitting at the top of the charts (despite being filled with ads +\ntracking).\" He quipped that he was \"so glad App Review exists to protect\nconsumers from scams and rip-offs like this.\"\n\nIt is unclear if Apple removed iGBA because it felt the app ripped off\nGBA4iOS. We have asked Apple for clarification about the app's removal, and we\nwill update this article if we receive any additional information about the\ndecision.\n\niGBA lets iPhone users play Game Boy games by loading free ROMs downloaded\nfrom the web. ROMs can be found online for a wide variety of games, including\nthose from the popular Pok\u00e9mon and The Legend of Zelda franchises. The\nemulator can still be used by those who installed it on their iPhones before\nit was removed from the App Store.\n\nOn its customer support website in the U.S., Nintendo says downloading pirated\ncopies of its games is illegal. It is unclear if Nintendo sent a complaint to\nApple about iGBA, and whether that may have been a factor in the app's\nremoval.\n\nAn excerpt from section 5.2 of the App Review Guidelines, related to\nintellectual property:\n\n> Make sure your app only includes content that you created or that you have a\n> license to use. Your app may be removed if you've stepped over the line and\n> used content without permission. Of course, this also means someone else's\n> app may be removed if they've \"borrowed\" from your work.\n\niGBA appeared in the App Store just over a week after Apple updated its App\nReview Guidelines to permit \"retro game console emulators,\" but it is\ninevitably not yet certain what Apple will allow exactly following the app's\nprompt removal.\n\nAs for Testut, he went on to create another Nintendo game emulator called\nDelta, which is distributed outside of the App Store. Delta will also be\navailable through Testut's alternative app marketplace AltStore on iPhones in\nthe EU. It is not clear if he plans to make Delta available in the App Store\nfollowing the rule change.\n\nTags: App Store, Emulator\n\n[ 9 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nTigerNike23\n\n43 minutes ago at 10:01 pm\n\nEmulators are kinda sketchy to begin with on copyright infringement.\n\nIt would not surprise me if Nintendo sent something to Apple.\n\nScore: 1 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nSTOCK411\n\n41 minutes ago at 10:03 pm\n\nyup.
