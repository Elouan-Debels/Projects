Hodgell\n\n# 5-Minute Singularity Intro\n\nPosted on :September 4, 2020July 2, 2021 By : Eliezer S. Yudkowsky Posted in :\nSingularity\n\nThis is a 5-minute spoken introduction to the Singularity I wrote for a small\nconference. I had to talk fast, though, so this is probably more like a 6.5\nminute intro.\n\nThe rise of human intelligence in its modern form reshaped the Earth. Most of\nthe objects you see around you, like these chairs, are byproducts of human\nintelligence. There\u2019s a popular concept of \u201cintelligence\u201d as book smarts, like\ncalculus or chess, as opposed to say social skills. So people say that \u201cit\ntakes more than intelligence to succeed in human society\u201d. But social skills\nreside in the brain, not the kidneys. When you think of intelligence, don\u2019t\nthink of a college professor, think of human beings; as opposed to\nchimpanzees. If you don\u2019t have human intelligence, you\u2019re not even in the\ngame.\n\nSometime in the next few decades, we\u2019ll start developing technologies that\nimprove on human intelligence. We\u2019ll hack the brain, or interface the brain to\ncomputers, or finally crack the problem of Artificial Intelligence. Now, this\nis not just a pleasant futuristic speculation like soldiers with super-strong\nbionic arms. Humanity did not rise to prominence on Earth by lifting heavier\nweights than other species.\n\nIntelligence is the source of technology. If we can use technology to improve\nintelligence, that closes the loop and potentially creates a positive feedback\ncycle. Let\u2019s say we invent brain-computer interfaces that substantially\nimprove human intelligence. What might these augmented humans do with their\nimproved intelligence? Well, among other things, they\u2019ll probably design the\nnext generation of brain-computer interfaces. And then, being even smarter,\nthe next generation can do an even better job of designing the third\ngeneration. This hypothetical positive feedback cycle was pointed out in the\n1960s by I. J. Good, a famous statistician, who called it the \u201cintelligence\nexplosion\u201d. The purest case of an intelligence explosion would be an\nArtificial Intelligence rewriting its own source code.\n\nThe key idea is that if you can improve intelligence even a little, the\nprocess accelerates. It\u2019s a tipping point. Like trying to balance a pen on one\nend \u2013 as soon as it tilts even a little, it quickly falls the rest of the way.\n\nThe potential impact on our world is enormous. Intelligence is the source of\nall our technology from agriculture to nuclear weapons. All of that was\nproduced as a side effect of the last great jump in intelligence, the one that\ntook place tens of thousands of years ago with the rise of humanity.\n\nSo let\u2019s say you have an Artificial Intelligence that thinks enormously faster\nthan a human. How does that affect our world? Well, hypothetically, the AI\nsolves the protein folding problem. And then emails a DNA string to an online\nservice that sequences the DNA , synthesizes the protein, and fedexes the\nprotein back. The proteins self-assemble into a biological machine that builds\na machine that builds a machine and then a few days later the AI has full-\nblown molecular nanotechnology.\n\nSo what might an Artificial Intelligence do with nanotechnology? Feed the\nhungry? Heal the sick? Help us become smarter? Instantly wipe out the human\nspecies? Probably it depends on the specific makeup of the AI. See, human\nbeings all have the same cognitive architecture. We all have a prefrontal\ncortex and limbic system and so on. If you imagine a space of all possible\nminds, then all human beings are packed into one small dot in mind design\nspace. And then Artificial Intelligence is literally everything else. \u201cAI\u201d\njust means \u201ca mind that does not work like we do\u201d. So you can\u2019t ask \u201cWhat will\nan AI do?\u201d as if all AIs formed a natural kind. There is more than one\npossible AI.\n\nThe impact, of the intelligence explosion, on our world, depends on exactly\nwhat kind of minds go through the tipping point.\n\nI would seriously argue that we are heading for the critical point of all\nhuman history. Modifying or improving the human brain, or building strong AI,\nis huge enough on its own. When you consider the intelligence explosion\neffect, the next few decades could determine the future of intelligent life.\n\nSo this is probably the single most important issue in the world. Right now,\nalmost no one is paying serious attention. And the marginal impact of\nadditional efforts could be huge. My nonprofit, the Machine Intelligence\nResearch Institute, is trying to get things started in this area. My own work\ndeals with the stability of goals in self-modifying AI, so we can build an AI\nand have some idea of what will happen as a result. There\u2019s more to this\nissue, but I\u2019m out of time. If you\u2019re interested in any of this, please talk\nto me, this problem needs your attention.
