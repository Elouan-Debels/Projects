Asked about the request on Wednesday, as he hosted the\nJapanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, for an official visit, Biden said:\n\u201cWe\u2019re considering it.\u201d\n\nAssange has been indicted on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer\nmisuse over his website\u2019s publication of a trove of classified US documents\nalmost 15 years ago. American prosecutors allege that Assange, 52, encouraged\nand helped the US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal diplomatic\ncables and military files that WikiLeaks published, putting lives at risk.\n\nAustralia argues there is a disconnect between the US treatment of Assange and\nManning. President Barack Obama commuted Manning\u2019s 35-year sentence to seven\nyears, which allowed her release in 2017.\n\nAssange\u2019s supporters say he is a journalist protected by the first amendment\nwho exposed US military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan that was in the\npublic interest. Assange\u2019s wife, Stella Assange, has said the WikiLeaks\nfounder \u201cis being persecuted because he exposed the true cost of war in human\nlives\u201d. She has said his health continues to deteriorate in prison and she\nfears he will die behind bars.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you\nwhat\u2019s happening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
