Even the most popular meme formats are now about IQ:\n\nIQ research\u2019s increasing popularity is due to its status as a battleground, in\nthat it is often\u2014not always, but often\u2014used in an attempt to shift the needle\npolitically. The supposed logic goes that if you think that humans are all\njust \u201cblank slates\u201d then you\u2019re going to support different policies than if\nyou think that intelligence is completely genetically determined from the\nmoment of conception.\n\nAs usual with a battleground, when you see people whacking away at each other\nin the mud, it is difficult to keep in mind that both sides might be wrong.\nFor two things can be true at once. First, it can be true that there is a\nhabit of reflexively censoring and smearing people, often researchers or\nscientists, for daring to talk about IQ at all, in any context, no matter how\nbenign their intentions. Look no further than the recent controversy where The\nNew Yorker explicitly said (as a tangent in a review about Jonathan Haidt\u2019s\nwork on the rise of teenage depression) that Haidt maintaining IQ was\nheritable at all was politically charged and \u201cwidely dismissed\u201d by the\nscientific community. But while different researchers give extremely wide\nestimates of the heritability of IQ, all the way from low single-digit\npercentages to upwards of half the variance, The New Yorker\u2019s editorial stance\nthat there is nothing at all in your genes that contributes to intelligence to\nany degree whatsoever doesn\u2019t even seem like the kind of thing they themselves\ncould possibly believe. The New Yorker\u2019s editor goes home and her daughter\nbabbles her first word and the husband says \u201cOh, she\u2019s so smart, just like her\nmama!\u201d and the editor smiles. Readers, in turn, know when they\u2019re being lied\nto.\n\nYet it can also be true, at the exact same time, that such criticisms have had\na reverse psychology effect, making it seem like intelligence being\ngenetically determined from conception is some sort of golden glowing\nscientific truth being covered up by the harshest censors. Many people who\nharp on things like psychology\u2019s ongoing replication crisis will turn a blind\neye to the same issues within IQ research, simply because they feel it is\nunfairly maligned for political purposes.\n\nOne reason the debate is unavoidable is that we are a society that sorts\nteenagers into colleges via what is effectively an IQ test. For scores on\nstandardized tests like the SAT correlate to IQ scores almost as well as the\nscores on different IQ tests do to each other (in fact, the SAT grew out of an\narmy IQ test). This is what\u2019s behind the standard pro-SAT argument that GPAs\nand impressive extracurriculars are easier for the rich to game than the SATs\nare, so standardized tests provide an opportunity for smart poor kids to get\ninto colleges. We can pretend as a society we don\u2019t administer the cousins of\nIQ tests at a mass scale, but personally I think we should be honest about\nboth its downsides and upsides (I\u2019ve written before about how I likely owe my\ncareer to the SAT/GREs).\n\nWithin the academic field of psychology, IQ remains the most popular and\napplicable measure of intelligence\u2014for researchers, it is the canonical \u201cbest\nmeasure.\u201d But the problem is that when laypeople hear it\u2019s the \u201cbest measure\u201d\nthey think it therefore must be a good measure. Instead of what it really is,\nwhich is a noisy and weak signal. This makes sense within the context:\npsychology is a noisy and weak signal discipline with all sorts of problems\naround reported effect sizes. IQ being \u201cthe best\u201d by those standards means a\nlot less than what outsiders might think. If medical tests, like tests for\ncancer, had the same reliability as IQ tests, they\u2019d be throwing up false\nsignals to the point of being unusable.\n\nIQ tests are also studiable, just like the SATs, although the degree is up for\ndebate. Schooling may even increase IQ scores by a couple points each year.\nIt\u2019s likely that people with insanely high IQs, e.g., people like Chris Langan\n(a bouncer with a supposed IQ of 200, who was once described by Esquire as\n\u201cthe smartest man in the world\u201d) are simply IQ obsessives who study and\npractice IQ tests in the same way that contestants do for Jeopardy.\n\nDue to being highly variable and also studiable IQ tests and their cousins\nlike the SATs are mostly good for sorting large populations we have no other\nway to sort: they, like democracy, are the best of a bunch of bad options.\n\nPlenty of academic researchers in the field acknowledge these issues (although\ndisagree on how important they are). But places like The New Yorker treating\nIQ research as inherently dangerous has had the predictable effect. Such\ncriticisms have given rise to a countering force, a growing overly-confident\npop-understanding of the IQ literature, one that believes the underlying\nresearch is as solid as granite. For whenever I briefly wade into the IQ\ndiscourse, like when I pointed out that there\u2019s actually no good evidence that\nhistorical geniuses like Einstein or Feynman had bank-breaking IQs (in fact,\nthat the difference between merely high IQ vs. super-high IQ doesn\u2019t seem to\nhave real-world consequences at all), I am deluged by comments along the lines\nof \u201cJust look at the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth!\u201d or \u201cJust look\nat the Terman Study of the Gifted!\u201d or \u201cWhat about Anne Roes\u2019 work on Nobel\nPrize winners?\u201d\n\nWhile there is plenty of more modern IQ research being done with better\nmethodologies, these famous older studies and their results form a halo of\nmythos; not coincidently, they are usually what those using IQ research for\npolitical purposes regularly cite. They are also, as a rule, rife with\nproblems.\n\nLet\u2019s consider one of these central references in IQ lore to demonstrate that\nit is not built on granite, but clay. It\u2019s a reference that crops up\ninevitably in IQ discourse. It\u2019s fascinating in its own right as a tale of how\nresearch gets warped, as well as a tale of how gifted education actually takes\nplace. I had been aware of it for years but never investigated it: the Study\nof Mathematically Precocious Youth (its popular enough to have its own\nWikipedia page).\n\nHere are some of the main results it supposedly shows. (Quote taken from Steve\nHsu\u2019s blog, who gives the clearest summary of its common takeaways).\n\n> \u2022 Prodigies destined for eminent careers can be identified as early as age\n> 13.\n>\n> \u2022 There is no plateau of ability; even within the top 1%, variations in\n> mathematical, spatial, and verbal abilities profoundly impact educational,\n> occupational, and creative outcomes.\n\nThese are quite strong conclusions. And certainly, the study is evocative;\nit\u2019s a longitudinal study that started in the late 1960s and tracked very\nyoung students who performed at incredible levels on the SAT math section of\nthe time (they took it much earlier than the normal age, so even a middling\nscore is amazing). Some famous names you might recognize were part of it, like\nMark Zuckerberg, Terence Tao, and even Lady Gaga.\n\nThe study is currently most associated with researcher David Lubinski, a\nprofessor of psychology at Vanderbilt University who has tens of thousands of\nacademic citations. Drawing on the study\u2019s old data, he writes articles with\ntitles like \u201cWho rises to the top? Early indicators,\u201d tracking the later\nachievements of the gifted members. Here is the kind of image from his\nanalysis of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (often abbreviated as\nSMPY). The graph correlates original SAT scores to later life successes like\ndoctorates, patents, income, etc.\n\nsource\n\nPretty stark, right? It\u2019s the genre of graph that crops up regularly in IQ\ndiscourse, and I understand why\u2014those at the very tippy top of scores, like\n700, look to be radically outperforming in life achievements even the (also\nvery bright) students who were scoring 500 on the math SAT at 13. The takeaway\nis obvious: if you aren\u2019t scoring like a genius at 13, if instead you\u2019re\n\u201cmerely\u201d bright, you\u2019ve already lost and are destined to rise to, well, not\nthe top.\n\nExcept that, as is often the case, once you start looking into the details of\nthe SMPY, you realize that you can\u2019t possibly draw that conclusion. For\nLubinski is not the person who started the SMPY. He took over the longitudinal\ntracking of its members accomplishments and some other programmatic aspects\n(it has a bunch of offshoots). The founder of SMPY was actually Julian\nStanley, a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University. Here is an account of its\norigins according to Nature:\n\n> On a summer day in 1968, professor Julian Stanley met a brilliant but bored\n> 12-year-old named Joseph Bates. The Baltimore student was so far ahead of\n> his classmates in mathematics... his computer instructor introduced him to\n> Stanley, a researcher well known for his work in psychometrics\u2014the study of\n> cognitive performance. To discover more about the young prodigy\u2019s talent,\n> Stanley gave Bates a battery of tests that included the SAT college-\n> admissions exam, normally taken by university-bound 16- to 18-year-olds in\n> the United States. Bates\u2019s score was well above the threshold for admission\n> to Johns Hopkins, and prompted Stanley to search for a local high school\n> that would let the child take advanced mathematics and science classes. When\n> that plan failed, Stanley convinced a dean at Johns Hopkins to let Bates,\n> then 13, enroll as an undergraduate.\n>\n> Stanley would affectionately refer to Bates as \u201cstudent zero\u201d of his Study\n> of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), which would transform how gifted\n> children are identified and supported by the US education system.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see what is already suspiciously different than the popular\ntelling of the study, I\u2019ll direct you to the description from Stanely\u2019s own\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9, highlighting the relevant parts:\n\n> \u201cWhat Julian wanted to know was, how do you find the kids with the highest\n> potential for excellence in what we now call STEM, and how do you boost the\n> chance that they\u2019ll reach that potential,\u201d says Camilla Benbow, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of\n> Stanley\u2019s who is now dean of education and human development at Vanderbilt\n> University in Nashville, Tennessee. But Stanley wasn\u2019t interested in just\n> studying bright children; he wanted to nurture their intellect and enhance\n> the odds that they would change the world.\n\nThat is, the original purpose of the SMPY was not to track a cohort and then\nmake causal claims about who rises to the top by sheer dint of their\nintelligence. Its purpose was to interfere. It was to encourage, to promote,\nto help, in any way they could, the kids who they identified as gifted.\n\nThat\u2019s great! I have no problems with the SMPY as it actually occurred. I do\nhave a problem with the mythology of the SMPY. Because such interference was\nthe entire point. Here\u2019s from Julian Stanley, the actual founder of the SMPY,\nwho wrote an in-depth retrospective of the experience:\n\n> By June of 1972, it had become clear that we needed to do something for the\n> children identified as mathematically precocious. Thus, in haste, we decided\n> to create a special, fast-paced mathematics class for the mathematically\n> ablest young students we had found... Mr. Wolfson, a physicist by training\n> who after obtaining his Master's degree from the University of Chicago...\n> worked expertly with about 20 boys and girls, most of whom had just\n> completed the sixth grade. All were of top 1 percent ability mathematically\n> and also verbally or in nonverbal reasoning. The class was a huge success\n> and was followed by a string of successful classes.\n>\n> As we continued to conduct talent searches for ever-larger numbers in 1972,\n> 1973, 1974, 1976, 1978, and 1979, we experimented incessantly with many\n> different ways of speeding up the learning of mathematics from algebra\n> through Advanced Placement Program Level BC calculus... as well as the\n> learning of biology, chemistry, and physics. This led to refinement and\n> extension of our procedures. We also experimented with other forms of\n> acceleration, or curricular flexibility (what came to be our preferred\n> term), to develop what we called the SMPY smorgasbord of accelerative\n> opportunities.\n\nIt was, indeed, a smorgasbord. Eventually there was an entire department at\nJohns Hopkins devoted to it, which...\n\n> ... took off like a rocket in January of 1980 with an expanded talent\n> search, now including verbal and general ability. The first residential\n> program of fast-paced courses followed that summer. CTY [Center for Talented\n> Youth] has expanded ever since, now serving over 60,000 young boys and girls\n> each year in its talent searches and over 4,000 in its summer programs,\n> which offer a great variety of courses.\n\nThe efforts to help gifted students just continued and continued:\n\n> Besides the test-based systematic talent-search concept, wherein each\n> student's abilities are carefully assessed, perhaps the virtually unique\n> contribution of SMPY has been its emphasis on acceleration in its many forms\n> and on fast-paced academic courses. In the latter, students are individually\n> and quickly paced by a mentor through a standard high school subject, such\n> as first-year algebra, biology, chemistry, or physics. Appropriately gifted\n> students can master a whole year of high school subject matter in three\n> intensive summer weeks.\n\nWith this level of aid in mind, the SMPY looks a lot less like a well-\ncontrolled study of \u201cWho rises to the top?\u201d based on their early SAT scores,\nand more like what its founder described it as: a \u201csmorgasbord of accelerative\nopportunities\u201d such as summer programs and individualized tutoring to assist\ngifted kids.\n\nAfter the early scores, did all members receive exactly equal treatment?\nDefinitely not. It\u2019s likely higher scorers merited more effort by the\nresearchers, as would be natural given their aims. It\u2019s also quite likely that\nhigher scorers, by dint of sheer impressiveness, were more likely to go to the\nsummer programs and have more individualized tutoring. These were kids spread\nout across the country. Every case was unique and hugely dependent on the\nparents. As Stanley says about the early part of the process:\n\n> SMPY has sent the SAT scores directly to the examinee, who then could work\n> with his or her parents in the local school situation and community to\n> secure needed curricular adjustments and other opportunities to move ahead\n> faster and better in academic areas of his or her greatest precocity.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that parental efforts to promote education and get their kids\ninto those special SMPY courses or intervene at their local schools likely\ncorrelated in degree to their child\u2019s initial scores, either as cause or\neffect.\n\nWhat\u2019s weird is that none of the SMPY\u2019s extensive efforts in helping the kids\nis mentioned in later retrospective papers like \u201cWho rises to the top?\u201d On my\ninitial read of that paper, it seemed for all the world like the research\nmerely tracked students without interference, impartially noting their future\namazing accomplishments. Yet as far as I can tell, the SMPY\u2019s efforts at\ntutoring, courses, outreach, working with administers and local schools, all\ncontinued quite late into the program, all the way to the 90s, covering all\nthe cohorts. I had to go back to a 2001 paper by Lubinski and co-authors to\nfind this acknowledged:\n\n> Before characterizing various outcomes, a distinctive finding on the\n> educational experiences of these participants (and how they felt about them)\n> should be noted. An overwhelming majority of participants (95%) took\n> advantage of various forms of academic acceleration in high school or\n> earlier to tailor their education to create a better match with their needs.\n\nThe methodology therefore is, frankly, too heterogenous and poorly documented\nto draw straightforward causal conclusions like that there\u2019s no plateau of\nability. The real takeaways of the SMPY are instead things like:\n\n> On average, participants indicated that their acceleration made no\n> detectable difference in their social life or in their ability to get along\n> with their age peers.\n\nIf anything, the SMPY supports the importance of education for high-impact\nindividuals, arguably even what I\u2019ve called \u201caristocratic tutoring\u201d\u2014the\nextensive (and expensive) methods that European aristocrats used to educate\ntheir children via one-on-one expert teaching, which led to so many of the\ngreat historical geniuses and remains the most elite tier of accelerated\neducation.\n\nThe SMPY showcases analogous paths in our own era, like skipping grades,\nexposure to advanced placement classes, individual tutoring, and so on. Again,\naccording to Nature:\n\n> SMPY researchers say that even modest interventions\u2014for example, access to\n> challenging material such as college-level Advanced Placement courses\u2014have a\n> demonstrable effect. Among students with high ability, those who were given\n> a richer density of advanced precollegiate educational opportunities in STEM\n> went on to publish more academic papers, earn more patents and pursue\n> higher-level careers than their equally smart peers who didn\u2019t have these\n> opportunities.\n\nYet this is not the telling of it in the pop-IQ discourse. Instead it is used\nto support a determinism that imagines you can test two 13-year-olds, both\nincredibly bright already, and by dint of a marginally more exceptional SAT\nscore you can assign one significantly greater odds of achievement.\n\nThe SMPY being a bad example of stark IQ determinism is not some exception. In\npop-IQ discourse, reach almost always exceeds grasp.\n\nDespite the fact that I usually end up on the more skeptical side of\nintelligence research, I personally don\u2019t begrudge anyone who is interested in\nIQ\u2014human intelligence is fascinating, and we don\u2019t have many ways of even\nthinking about it, and IQ and its cousins like the SATs are the measurables we\ncan assess. It certainly has its uses, perhaps best showcased in the actual\nworkings of programs like the SMPY: to do initial identification of talent at\na mass scale, and then apply targeted education practices that are indeed\neffective (as the study itself shows) at raising later achievements.\n\nBut it should never be forgotten that IQ research is not physics. It is not\nchemistry. It is a soft science like psychology or sociology. More modern\npapers have lots of fancy statistics, but that does nothing to lessen its\nplushy, silky, softness. It is not based on the hardness of some known\nneuroscientific mechanism we\u2019ve pinpointed that underlies intelligence. There\nis no causal account we can give for the biological basis of IQ that has any\nserious tensile strength. Most research consists of paper tests administered\nfor an hour or two, sometimes decades ago, followed by contortion after\ncontortion to account for the complexities of the world.\n\nBuild your house atop such foundations, build your political movements atop\nsuch foundations, and be warned they may collapse with large thunder.\n\n### Subscribe to The Intrinsic Perspective\n\nBy Erik Hoel \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nBridging the two cultures of science and the humanities\n\n52 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n6 Restacks\n\n52\n\nShare this post\n\n#### IQ discourse is increasingly unhinged\n\nwww.theintrinsicperspective.com\n\n22\n\nShare\n\n22 Comments\n\nRichard HananiaRichard Hanania's Newsletter3 hrs ago\u201cBut while different\nresearchers give extremely wide estimates of the heritability of IQ, all the\nway from low single-digit percentages to upwards of half the variance,\u201dNobody\nwho is knowledgeable as far as I know puts IQ heritability at \u201clow single-\ndigits.\u201d That link is to what one can explain from specific genes, that\u2019s not\nan estimate of heredity, which needs to be derived from twin or adoption\nstudies.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n7 replies by Erik Hoel and others\n\n\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05dc \u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d43 hrs agoOK, but what really gets our goat up is the 'isolated\ndemand for rigour'.
