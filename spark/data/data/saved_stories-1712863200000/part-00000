We\u2019ve recently received a lot of questions on how we are planning\nto make our Free Tier sustainable, and what market we\u2019re after with it. (And\nread until the end to also learn about a migration tool we launched this\nweek!)\n\nIn this blog post, we uncover some of the decisions we've made \u2014 and how we\ncan deliver a generous, performant free offering that is here for good. And if\nyou're curious about the technical implementation, we've also written about\nhow we designed and built our Free Shared Tier.\n\n## Why build a SingleStore Free Tier?\n\nAt SingleStore, we already have a predictable and growing revenue engine\n($100M+ ARR) of pretty large check sizes. Some of the most critical and high-\nperforming applications at very large companies run on SingleStore. So, why\nbuild a free offering? Even PlanetScale CEO Sam Lambert appropriately tweeted\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hit $100M in revenue by charging $29 a month for databases...\u201d \u2014\nand he\u2019s right, we know that.\n\nOur Free Tier offering serves a different purpose to our business compared to\nour competitors. It\u2019s not the lifeline, the vanity metric, the VC-driven\nnumber \u2014 it\u2019s more than that. Free Tier is how we bring our loved, powerful\nand versatile database to applications and workloads for every developer and\ntheir apps. It\u2019s how we want our developer community to build more with\nSingleStore. Here are our convictions for the free tier:\n\n1\\. There is a clear market opening for SingleStore to all workloads, at every\nscale\n\nModern apps are powered by diverse workloads: analytical queries on real-time\ndata, hybrid search (vector + full-text) and transactions. Being an HTAP\nengine, SingleStore handles these workloads using a single engine with a\nsingle source of data. Forget ETL between your transactional store (MySQL,\nPostgreSQL), your vector databases (Pinecone, Milvus) and an analytical engine\n(BQ, Redshift, Snowflake); build your apps, all you need is a SingleStore\ndatabase.\n\nOur all-in-one message is especially powerful for developers at the smallest\nscale. Don\u2019t let your database choice limit what you can ship.\n\n2\\. We can deliver performance at even the smallest scale\n\nWe didn\u2019t want to lose what makes us SingleStore in our Free Tier offering.\nBuilt on our Shared Edition, Free Tier delivers fast hybrid search and\nanalytical queries alongside your point reads and writes.\n\nWe\u2019re constantly innovating and improving our Free Shared Tier, bringing\nlarger limits, tiered price points and more performance. We\u2019re really excited\nabout this, and it\u2019s just the start of our serverless vision for SingleStore.\n\n3\\. There is a massive developer swell of SingleStore users within existing\ncustomers\n\nExisting customers can build their side projects, dev tests and other\nexperiments without consuming credits. Our Free Tier empowers a culture of\ninnovation and progress within our customers. And, we\u2019ve already seen some\nreally interesting new workloads and applications driven by prototypes built\nby developers on the Free Tier.\n\nOur Free Tier isn\u2019t at war with our large enterprise deals or our GTM engine.\nIt\u2019s a propeller of our next innings of growth \u2014 driving new run-rate business\nand our expansion within existing customers.\n\n### SingleStore Free Tier: A decade in the making\n\nOver the course of the last decade, there have been some key investments we\u2019ve\nmade to ensure we can deliver a performant, cost-effective Free Tier offering.\nThe way we\u2019ve designed the Free Tier also incentivises us to scale , where the\ncost per customer goes down as we get more users. It was very important to\nalign our incentives here to encourage more adoption of our service.\n\nHere are some of the key architectural decisions we\u2019ve made:\n\n  * Complete separation of compute and storage designed for transactional and analytical workloads. We call this Workspaces. This ensures that idle Free Tier databases detach and aren\u2019t consuming compute \u2014 the main driver for our COGS.\n  * Fast attachments of databases to Workspaces. Without this, launching compute with Free Tier would be too slow and unusable.\n  * Resource pools and database-level RBAC. These features have been battle-tested in our database engine, and can now be leveraged by our Free Tier as well.\n  * Mature control plane for Helios Cloud service. Over the last few years, we've grown and matured the control plane for our cloud service. We have solid observability, internal alerts and everything else that one would expect from a developed managed service offering.\n\nIf you want to learn more, we again encourage you to read our more technical\nblog post.\n\n### Try it out!\n\nWe would love you all to try out our Free Shared Tier. If you can't find this\nfeature and would like to try it out, feel free to reach out directly through\nour Forums, or just tweet at us.\n\nFinally, this week we launched a very simple \"PlanetScale to SingleStore\nMigrator\" tool that you can try if you're looking for an alternative to their\nfree tier offering.\n\nProductEngineering\n\nShare\n\n## Related reading\n\nProduct\n\n### Correlation Statistics in SingleStore\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nRead Now\n\nProduct\n\n### Introducing Native Data Integration Services\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nRead Now\n\nProduct\n\n### SingleStoreDB Self-Managed 7.3 is Now Generally Available\n\nDecember 15, 2020\n\nRead Now\n\nProduct\n\n### SingleStore\u2019s Patented Universal Storage - Part 2\n\nJune 3, 2020\n\nRead Now\n\nProduct\n\n### Full-Text Search in SingleStore\n\nMarch 6, 2018\n\nRead Now\n\nProduct\n\n### SingleStore ships 2.0.
