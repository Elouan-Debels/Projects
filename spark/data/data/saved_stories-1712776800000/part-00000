Then the Predators Emerged\n\nJane Willenbring was the first to blow the whistle on sexual harassment and\nassault in Antarctica. Years later, women are still coming forward with tales\nof horror as a government investigation unfolds.\n\nJane Willenbring was the first to come forward with her experiences of\nharassment in Antarctica.Photograph: Helynn Ospina\n\nContent warning: This article includes scenes of physical and sexual\nharassment and assault.\n\nThe trouble in Antarctica started in Boston. It was August 1999, and Stanford\ngeologist Jane Willenbring was then a 22-year-old self-described \u201ccountry\nbumpkin.\u201d She had just arrived to start her master\u2019s in earth science at\nBoston University. As an undergrad with an oboe scholarship at North Dakota\nState University, she\u2019d studied beetle fossils found in Antarctica and learned\nhow, millions of years ago, the now frozen continent once pooled with\nfreshwater lakes. \u201cThat\u2019s not so different from the conditions we might expect\nin the future,\u201d she says. She wanted to explore this critical science. \u201cIt\nseemed really important for future global climate change,\u201d she says.\n\nWith additional reporting by Meghan Herbst.\n\nOf all the geologists, few were more renowned than the one Willenbring had\ngone to Boston to study under: 37-year-old David Marchant. Marchant, a scruffy\nprofessor at BU, was a rock star of rock study. He was part of a research\ngroup that rewrote Antarctic history by discovering evidence of volcanic ash,\nwhich showed that Antarctica had been stable for millions of years and was not\nas prone to cycles of warming and cooling as many thought. To honor his\nachievements, the US Board on Geographic Names approved the naming of a\nglacier southwest of McMurdo Station, the main research base on Antarctica,\nafter him.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nWillenbring says Marchant had insisted on picking her up at the airport, an\noffer she thought was nice but strange. It got stranger when he started making\nher feel bad for his gesture, which she hadn\u2019t asked for. \u201cI\u2019m missing a Red\nSox game,\u201d she recalls him chiding her. \u201cYou really should have picked a\nbetter time to fly.\u201d He asked whether she had a boyfriend, how often she saw\nhim, and whether she knew anyone in Boston or would be alone. In a few months,\nshe\u2019d be heading with him on a research trip to Antarctica and the region with\nhis big chunk of namesake ice. \u201cIt was almost like a pickup line,\u201d she\nrecalls, \u201c\u2018I have a glacier.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s what happened in the glacier\u2019s shadow that led Willenbring to take on\nMarchant and become the first to expose the horrors faced by women at the\nbottom of the world. A report released in August 2022 by the National Science\nFoundation, the main agency funding Antarctic research, found that 59 percent\nof women at McMurdo and other field stations run by the US Antarctic Program\nsaid they\u2019d experienced sexual harassment or assault. A central employer,\nLeidos, holds a $2.3 billion government contract to manage the workplaces on\nthe ice. One woman alleged that a supervisor had slammed her head into a metal\ncabinet and then attacked her sexually. Britt Barquist, a former fuel foreman\nat McMurdo, says she had been forced to work alongside a supervisor who had\nsexually harassed her. \u201cWhat was really traumatic was telling people, \u2018I\u2019m\nafraid of this person,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cand nobody cared.\u201d\n\nWith a congressional investigation underway, Willenbring is sharing her full\nstory for the first time with the hope of inspiring others to come forward and\nclaim the justice they\u2019ve long deserved. But even now, decades after she first\ngot into Marchant\u2019s car, she can\u2019t help asking herself how, and why, the\nnightmare happened in the first place. \u201cYou never hear a women-in-science\npanel where people are talking about stuff like I do,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause\nthey\u2019re smart enough to fucking run.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

She was heading there with Marchant and another grad student, Adam\nLewis, for her first trip to the continent. They\u2019d be collecting samples from\na plateau where glaciers had drained through the ice. This would help them\nunderstand when glaciers had eroded and would give insight into future climate\nchange scenarios. \u201cI really wanted to go to Antarctica, hike around, dig\nholes, collect samples. That kind of thing,\u201d she says.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Willenbring to notice that there might be unexpected\nchallenges ahead. The plane didn\u2019t have a private toilet. Instead, at the\nback, there was essentially a bucket partially concealed by a curtain that\ndidn\u2019t reach the floor. \u201cThis is fine for guys, because they just stand and\npee into the bucket,\u201d Willenbring says. \u201cBut I would have to hold on to my\npants, and you could see my butt.\u201d On other occasions women resorted to using\n\u201cpee funnels,\u201d she later learned, but no one had ordered one for her. Marchant\ntold her he chose not to order one, she recalls, because he thought it was\n\u201cgross having women stand up while they pee.\u201d\n\nAfter landing on the ice shelf airfield, Willenbring felt \u201ctotally\nspellbound,\u201d with her boots slipping on the icy surface and the cold crisp\nsnap of Antarctic air in her lungs. She rode in a giant bus as she got\ndebriefed, she says, on the dos and don\u2019ts of life in the delicate ecosystem\nshe\u2019d come to study: how to sort garbage, what to keep in bottles or bags.\nMcMurdo Station itself wasn\u2019t much to look at\u2014just a jumble of buildings and\nconstruction vehicles. At that time of year, the research station housed\naround 1,000 people, including scientists and crew. Many liked to go to the\nannual kegger in the helicopter hangar or to gather at Gallagher\u2019s, the\nstation\u2019s watering hole.\n\nAs a newbie \u201con the ice,\u201d as locals put it, Willenbring had to complete\nsurvival camp before heading into the field. She excelled at making a fire in\nthe snow, tying the correct knots to secure a tent, and building an igloo, in\nwhich she had to sleep for a night. There was one other newbie in the Boston\ngroup who was even less experienced than Willenbring, and certainly less\nqualified: Jeffrey Marchant. To her surprise, David Marchant had brought along\nhis older brother. Jeffrey wasn\u2019t a scientist; he was a research assistant\nprofessor at Tufts University\u2019s medical school who, Willenbring recalls, had\ntagged along for fun. It seemed outrageous to her that Marchant would disrupt\ntheir work like this. But he just laughed when she questioned him, and he told\nher to call his brother by his field nickname: Ken Tonka. The name had come up\nwhen the group was playing the \u201cporn star name\u201d game of pairing a team\nmember\u2019s middle name with their favorite childhood toy. But she recalls\nMarchant telling her that \u201cTonka\u201d was also \u201cbecause his penis was like a Tonka\ntruck.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Most field scientists flew back now and\nthen, but Marchant had told Willenbring that he believed in toughing it out in\nthe bitter cold: no showers, no bathrooms, and, as she learned, no privacy.\n\u201cHe views himself as the second coming of Ernest Shackleton,\u201d Lewis recalls,\nso much so that Marchant asked to be called by the nickname Shack.\n\nMarchant seemed to have no patience for anyone slowing him down, especially\nwomen. Lewis told Willenbring that on a previous expedition, Marchant had\nbullied a high school teacher, Hillary Tulley, who\u2019d joined them to\nparticipate in their work. On one of the group\u2019s first days there, \u201che marched\nup the side of a mountain as fast as he possibly could for no other reason\nthan to make Hillary tired,\u201d Lewis says (and Tulley confirms). \u201cHe would say\nthings to her like, \u2018You\u2019re not gonna make it. You\u2019re slowing us down,\nHillary. I don\u2019t know even know why the hell you\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d Tulley recalls\nthat \u201cit was a big clusterfuck from the jump ... It was all just not good.\u201d\n\nWhen they\u2019d pause out in the field to talk, \u201cMarchant would always stop at the\nplace where there was a big rock so he could stand on it to be the tallest,\u201d\nTulley says. \u201cOne day, I stood on the rock first, and the way he looked at me\n... I just thought it was so easy to bait this guy. To establish dominance.\u201d\n\nWillenbring had her own trouble to face. Marchant had brought three tents for\nthe four of them. He said she would be sharing with his brother. \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou stay with your brother?\u201d she asked Marchant. \u201cBecause Jeff likes you,\u201d he\ntold her, suggestively. (Jeffrey Marchant declined to comment for this\narticle.)\n\nAs they spent their days digging for volcanic ash and carefully collecting\nsamples of sediment and rocks found in glacial ice, Marchant would talk up his\nbrother to Willenbring. He said Jeffrey played oboe, just like her, and asked\nwhether she\u2019d seen his brother\u2019s penis yet. She had. She would be sleeping in\ntheir tent when sometimes she would hear him wake up, and then see him\nstanding there, peeing into a bottle with an erection.\n\nAs disgusted and nervous as this made Willenbring feel, she also felt afraid\nto challenge Marchant. Like any grad student, she needed her adviser\u2019s\napproval and support to advance in her field\u2014to get a thesis approved, receive\na recommendation, get referrals for a job. \u201cHe definitely had the power,\u201d she\nsays. Willenbring stuck it out.\n\nPersonal tents for staff at the Shackleton Glacier science camp, situated on\nthe Shackleton Glacier in the Transantarctic mountains of\nAntarctica.Photograph: Getty Images/Jeff Miller\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

On some days,\nMarchant made them hike for 13 hours while collecting samples. During the long\njourneys over the unforgiving rocks, Willenbring feared they\u2019d hit an ice\nstorm, or go so long without a snack that Lewis, who was diabetic, would go\ninto insulin shock. (Lewis says he packed an abundance of snacks to ward off\nthe risk.)\n\nMarchant tried to run them like a boot camp. \u201cHe made us all do push-ups. You\nknow, \u2018Gimme 50!\u2019\u201d Lewis says of at least one occasion. The few times Lewis\nmustered the nerve to speak up\u2014warning Marchant that he might be crossing a\nline\u2014he says Marchant laughed him off.\n\nEven if Willenbring had gathered the courage to call for help, there was only\none way to do it. The group had a radio that they used to call back to base\nand deliver a daily check-in message, alerting McMurdo personnel that they\nwere safe. But, Willenbring says, Marchant never let it out of his control.\nEvery morning, he\u2019d call back to McMurdo: \u201cFour souls in camp, and all is\nwell.\u201d\n\nWillenbring\u2019s feelings of isolation grew. Then, one day, while digging into\nthe gravelly sediment off on her own, amid the sandstone and dolerite, she\nfound a big piece of granite. \u201cIt was serendipitous,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was\nsomething new.\u201d The presence of granite suggested an unexpected twist in the\nhistorical record\u2014and in assumptions of when ice had deposited sediment at\nthat location. But when she showed Marchant the dark jagged samples, he\ndismissed her as \u201ca dumb fucking whore,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I just can\u2019t\nwin,\u2019\u201d she recalls.\n\nAs repulsed and angry as she felt, Willenbring knew her findings were\nvaluable, no matter what Marchant said. It became clear that belittling her\nhad become a sport for him, whatever the circumstance. He would chastise her\nfor carrying heavy equipment and for not carrying any at all. Sometimes it\nwould get to be too much, and she would break down. \u201cHe hated when I\u2019d cry,\u201d\nshe recalls. \u201cHe\u2019d laugh and then get mad at me for crying. It was just the\nultimate fucking with my head.\u201d\n\nOne day, Marchant asked her to look closely at a sediment sample he held in a\nsmall bent spoon, then blew the crystalline shards into her eyes. Another\ntime, she says, he grabbed her by her backpack and pushed her down a loose\ngravel hill she was struggling to climb. She resolved that she would fight\nback if she needed to. She had already told him that she was a black belt in\ntae kwon do. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put this in a way that doesn\u2019t make me sound\ntotally psycho,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut if it had gotten super bad, I would\u2019ve\njust beaten him with my hands or by smashing him in the face with a shovel.\u201d\n\nMarchant didn\u2019t relent. He pushed her down and taunted her. She fantasized\nabout punching him in the nose. Midway through the field season, he started\npelting her with rocks whenever he caught her urinating\u2014easy for him to do\nsince there were no bushes or trees. Willenbring began drinking less water so\nshe wouldn\u2019t have to go to the bathroom. She got a bladder infection. It got\nso bad that she started urinating blood. When she told Marchant, he told her\nto drink cranberry juice. Throughout it all, Marchant would radio each day and\ngive the OK message back to base. \u201cFour souls in camp,\u201d he would say, \u201cand all\nis well.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

She felt she had no choice, so\nshe did it. She recalls that he\u2019d made it clear she was not to speak of their\ntime on the ice\u2014that if she did, she\u2019d be branded a liar. In other words, she\nbelieved he would ruin her career.\n\nWhen he tried to enlist Willenbring in hazing a younger student and\ndenigrating their work, she refused. But the stress was taking a toll. \u201cI\nwould try to push it far, far down,\u201d she tells me. \u201cYou try not to think about\nit, that it\u2019s there. Otherwise it\u2019ll drive you crazy.\u201d After more than two\nyears at BU, Willenbring left with her master\u2019s degree.\n\nShe moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to work on a PhD in earth sciences at\nDalhousie University. After finishing, she landed a coveted position as an\nassistant professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at\nthe University of Pennsylvania. It was a joyous moment\u2014the great payoff after\nmany difficult years. But Willenbring says the bad behavior resumed. She says\nmale colleagues made degrading remarks\u2014about her clothing, about her nipples,\nabout her being too fat to fit behind seminar desks. (She was pregnant.)\n\nOne day, when her child was 3, Willenbring was without childcare and brought\nher daughter along to the lab. She set her up in an observation room with a\nwindow so the little girl could watch. Willenbring went into the adjacent room\nand waved as she suited up in a white coat and goggles. For the first time,\nher daughter seemed to understand that her mom was a real-life scientist. \u201cI\nwant to be a scientist just like you!\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nMeredith Nash in Neko Harbour, in West Antarctica, during her voyage with\nHomeward Bound.Photograph: Sarah Conolly\n\nWillenbring responded by bursting into tears. \u201cI was imagining her going\nthrough what I did,\u201d she tells me. When her daughter asked her why she was\ncrying, she reassured her, though it felt like a lie. \u201cSometimes mommies do\nhappy tears,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it makes me so happy that you want to be a\nscientist.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

She decided it was time to\nfinally speak out. She opened her laptop and wrote up a draft of her complaint\nagainst David Marchant. But then she got scared. She didn\u2019t have tenure. Her\nacademic career still felt insecure. She set the draft aside.\n\nA few months later, in 2016, Willenbring moved with her daughter across the\ncountry to become a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at\nthe University of California, San Diego. It had been nearly two decades since\nshe escaped her time with Marchant on the ice, but her experiences left her\nboth psychologically and physically damaged. (She has fought bladder problems\nsince her infection in the field.) She also carried an intense sense of shame\nfor not having spoken out, one way or another, despite her fear at the time.\nShe felt sick imagining Marchant harassing other students with impunity. But\nnow, in her new job, she finally had tenure.\n\nIn October of that year, Willenbring filed a Title IX complaint about\nMarchant. When Boston University officials assured her that they would look\ninto the matter, she felt hopeful. \u201cI actually thought they would be happy to\nknow about this,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause what a horrible liability, having this\nguy as a professor.\u201d\n\nDavid Marchant did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request to comment.\n\nFollowing Willenbring\u2019s complaint, two other women joined the action: \u201cDeborah\nDoe,\u201d who alleged that Marchant had called her a \u201ccunt\u201d and a \u201cbitch\u201d and had\nthreatened her PhD funding\u2014she had been so traumatized that she left higher\neducation\u2014and Hillary Tulley, the high school teacher from the earlier trip\nwith Marchant. \u201cHis taunts, degrading comments about my body, brain, and\ngeneral inadequacies, never ended,\u201d as Tulley put it.\n\nAround the time, the Me Too movement was gaining momentum. The Harvey\nWeinstein sexual abuse scandal broke, and the monstrous behavior in Antarctica\nwent viral. Samantha Bee joked about it on her show Full Frontal, saying, \u201cYou\ncan\u2019t even go to the most remote part of the planet without some dude swinging\nhis cold, shriveled dick your way.\u201d It felt cathartic for Willenbring, but it\nalso brought new challenges\u2014starting with the death threat she found written\non her office door.\n\nIn November 2017, the university concluded its investigation and determined\nthat Marchant had in fact sexually harassed Willenbring and that the case\nwarranted the start of termination proceedings. Marchant appealed, and a group\nof faculty recommended that he merely be suspended for three years without\npay. After that, he was free to return. It seemed that despite Willenbring\u2019s\neffort, more needed to be done to finally bring justice, and light, to the\nhorrors at the bottom of the earth. Three months later, that\u2019s exactly what\nhappened.\n\nIn February 2018, the environmental news site Grist published an account from\nfive women who alleged sexual harassment, sexual coercion, and bullying on the\ninaugural Homeward Bound, a leadership-development voyage to Antarctica for\nwomen in science and technology fields. One claimed to have woken up next to a\nnaked crew member with \u201cno memory of what had happened.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

What\nshe discovered on the expedition shocked her.\n\nOne night on the ship, Nash, a native Chicagoan with tattooed arms and a crest\nof blond hair on her close-shaved head, attended a group party that quickly\ndevolved into a drunken bash, with the captain wearing a dress and another\ncrew member being led around on a leash. (Nash says there\u2019s \u201ca long Antarctic\ntradition for men to cross-dress.\u201d A Homeward Bound representative noted, \u201cOn\nevery voyage at the midway point of the journey we have a costume party which\nis a celebratory experience for all the women to join and participate.\u201d)\n\nNash, as part of her study, had collected video diaries from women on the\njourney. She was going through them back in Tasmania when she found a video of\na woman crying in the ship\u2019s dining room because a crew member, she said, had\njust followed her back to her room and tried to hold the door open and enter\nwithout her permission. Nash, horrified, emailed and then called the woman to\nsee whether she was OK. \u201cShe said she\u2019d already talked to the faculty about\nwhat happened,\u201d she says, \u201cand that was that.\u201d\n\nThe woman in the video was Nicole Hellessey, a PhD student at the University\nof Tasmania who had joined the Homeward Bound program to connect with other\nwomen scientists. Recalling the incident, Hellessey says that she alerted\nmembers of the voyage\u2019s faculty while still on board, but no one followed up\nor checked in on her before or after Nash\u2019s phone call. \u201cI dealt with that\ntrauma alone,\u201d she says. (Homeward Bound says that \u201cif participants raised any\nconcerns ... this information was shared with the Homeward Bound leadership\nteam.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThis was a voyage for women to go to Antarctica and break boundaries, and\ninstead, the few men on board made this experience feel like a microcosm of\nthe real world,\u201d Hellessey adds. \u201cI felt unsafe, and what happened to me\nbrought me back to reality.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dattner, two crew members lost their jobs following the voyage.\nAfter the trip, many of the women sent the Homeward Bound organizers a list of\nrecommendations, which included developing a code of ethics and closing the\nbar by midnight. About a quarter of the women thought the list didn\u2019t go far\nenough, and sent a second letter urging the program to, among other things,\nhire an independent clinical psychologist and foster an environment free from\noffensive and intimidating language.\n\n\u201cA lot of mistakes were made on the first trip that some of us fought very,\nvery hard to remedy for future expeditions,\u201d says Sea Rotmann, who\nparticipated in the Homeward Bound trip. The program implemented some of the\nideas and dozens of others to improve safety. (In 2018, a New Zealand magazine\nhad been reporting on the allegations of abuse and harassment when lawyers\nrepresenting Homeward Bound threatened the publication with the possibility of\na lawsuit. Lacking the financial resources to deal with litigation, the\nmagazine killed the story.)\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Sixty-three percent of them reported being harassed, and about\nhalf said they\u2019d never spoken up about what had happened. The harassment\nranged from physical assault to microaggressions: \u201cPhD supervisors withholding\ndata,\u201d Nash says, \u201cor preferencing the male members of a research team over\nthe women.\u201d\n\nMeredith Nash helped reveal widespread sexual misconduct in Australia\u2019s\nAntarctic programs.Photograph: Adam Gibson\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Antarctic Division commissioned her to lead a\ngovernment-funded review of diversity, equity, and inclusion at its programs.\n\u201cWhen I first started,\u201d she tells me, \u201cone of the scariest moments I had was\nwhen one of the people I was working with said, \u2018See that guy there? He raped\nthat woman over there 10 years ago on station.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring her nearly two years working on that review, Nash learned about\nwidespread incidents of harassment and assault. The reign of male\nexpeditioners in the region and the isolation of the harsh environment made it\nall the more insidious. \u201cWomen have to work in the field with their abusers\nfor weeks at a time because they simply can\u2019t leave,\u201d as she puts it. In the\nspring of 2021, she suggested to the director of the Australian Antarctic\nDivision, Kim Ellis, that he immediately launch a more specific investigation\ninto sexual misconduct.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, but Ellis says he met with Nash monthly and implemented\nmany of her other recommendations, including hiring three women to roles\nwithin the previously all-male executive team, providing menstrual health\nproducts in all bathrooms at Antarctic division offices, and improving\ntraining on sexual misconduct.\n\nNash says there\u2019s more to be done. And it starts with more women speaking out.\n\u201cThe only reason we know about David Marchant is because Jane Willenbring had\nthe courage to talk about her experiences.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

(The university said it could not corroborate her\nclaims of physical and psychological abuse.) Marchant released a statement,\nwhich the journal Science quoted as vowing that he had \u201cnever\u201d sexually\nharassed anyone, \u201cnot in 1998 or 1999 in Antarctica or at any time since.\u201d But\nbecause of Willenbring, the word was out.\n\nReeling in the wake of this scandal, the National Science Foundation\ncommissioned an outside study on sexual assault and sexual harassment at the\nAntarctic research facilities. The lengthy report, made public in August 2022,\nhad shocking allegations of assault, stalking, and harassment. Britt Barquist,\nthe former fuel foreman, was on contract at McMurdo with a company now called\nAmentum. She oversaw a crew of about 20 who did the dangerous work of handling\nand cleaning diesel and gasoline fuel tanks. One day in late November 2017,\nshe tells me, she was sitting at a table alongside a man who held a senior\nposition at Leidos, the company managing the Antarctic research stations. He\u2019d\nbeen running a briefing for the staff when he groped her in plain view.\n\nWhen she talked about it with her supervisor, he said he\u2019d witnessed some of\nthe incident himself. His boss reported it to the human resources department\nat Amentum. \u201cI told HR that I don\u2019t want to be anywhere around him ever again.\nI am scared of this person,\u201d Barquist says, \u201cAnd they said, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut in 2020, during another stint working with the McMurdo contractor, she was\ntold she\u2019d be attending weekly virtual meetings with that same senior\nofficial. Barquist, who needed the job, downplayed it to herself. \u201cIt was just\ndisgusting and awful to have to look at his face and listen to him talk,\u201d she\nsays, \u201cjust to see him treated as a normal guy, when in my head I\u2019m like,\n\u2018This guy is a predator. Why is everyone just acting like he\u2019s some normal\nperson?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe next year, toward the end of nearly three weeks of Covid quarantine with a\ncrew in New Zealand, she\u2019d scanned the manifest for an upcoming flight to\nAntarctica and saw the senior official\u2019s name on it. When she called her HR\ndepartment over a spotty connection to complain, she says she was met with\nobstinance by two officials, one of whom had been introduced as a victim\u2019s\nadvocate.\n\n\u201cI said I still don\u2019t want to be around this guy,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut they\nsaid, \u2018So how do you suggest we deal with this?\u2019\u201d Barquist gets emotional as\nshe recalls her conversation with the two women from her employer. \u201cI thought\nthey were going to be on my side,\u201d she says. Instead, they kept pressing her\nas to how afraid she felt to be around him.\n\n\u201cI finally was like, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201c\u2018I feel unsafe being alone in a room\nwith him!\u2019\u201d Then the signal dropped, she says, and she never managed to\nreconnect with them. Barquist flew back to Antarctica, where she tried to\navoid the senior official. But as her team\u2019s safety depended on her\ncommunicating with him on a nearly daily basis, she eventually relented.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Women, she sensed, \u201cweren\u2019t going to\nnecessarily be seen as human.\u201d Sorensen fell into what locals call an \u201cice\nrelationship\u201d with a man while they were stationed together. But the day after\nChristmas, she says, her \u201cice boyfriend\u201d raped her. Two years later, she\nreported it to a communications specialist at Leidos as well as the HR\ndepartment and president of GHG, the company that employed the individual. She\nwas stunned when, following a four-day investigation, GHG told her that the\nattack was not an assault. Instead, a GHG executive told her, \u201cWe have\nconcluded that a sexual incident took place that resulted in feelings of\nhumiliation and extreme discomfort for you.\u201d\n\nThe company informed her that it was sexual harassment, which meant the most\nthat could be done was for GHG not to hire her alleged rapist back. \u201cIt just\nfelt like this bizarre game of telephone, where I was truthful,\u201d she says,\n\u201cand then they tried to repeat it back to me like, \u2018No, that\u2019s not it at\nall.\u2019\u201d (GHG ultimately did not view this incident as a violation of the NSF\u2019s\nPolar Code of Conduct.)\n\nAfter the NSF released its August 2022 report on sexual harassment and assault\nat McMurdo and the other US stations in Antarctica, Leidos submitted a\nstatement to the US Congress claiming it had received \u201czero allegations\u201d of\nsexual assault in the past five years. \u201cEither they\u2019re straight-up lying,\u201d\nBarquist says, \u201cor somehow they put what happened to me into some weird bucket\nof \u2018not sexual assault.\u2019\u201d As part of a 2023 investigation by the Associated\nPress, other women came forward, including a woman who alleged she was choked\nand assaulted by a colleague at McMurdo in November 2022. (The accused was\nlater found not guilty in a jury trial.) Women at the station formed a group,\nIce Allies, to support and educate one another.\n\nIn a statement to WIRED, the NSF says it has \u201cbeen grappling with this\nchallenge for many years\u201d and that the report prompted the agency \u201cto take\nquick and deliberate action\u201d to improve the safety and culture of Antarctica\u2019s\nresearch bases. According to a spokesperson, \u201cThese are only our initial steps\nin Antarctica. We will continue to make changes as part of an ongoing effort\nto address the community\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nPenguins around the tent site.Photograph: Sarah Conolly\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Tanya Plibersek,\nAustralia\u2019s minister for environment and water, whose office in part oversees\nthe country\u2019s Antarctic programs, said she was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by what she read.\n\u201cThere is no place for sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior in any\nworkplace,\u201d she said. Kim Ellis, the Antarctic division director, issued a\nstatement saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d and \u201caccepted all the\nrecommendations.\u201d\n\nNash\u2019s report hinted, however, at a larger problem\u2014lack of trust. Women felt\nthe program\u2019s leadership lacked the \u201cdeep knowledge\u201d required to take\nmeaningful steps, and doubted HR\u2019s ability to properly handle formal\ncomplaints. Three months later, Ellis announced his resignation.\n\nNash\u2019s work also prompted Australia\u2019s Antarctic leaders to commission a more\ncomprehensive review. Released in spring 2023, it included a survey of nearly\n250 people and found that \u201ca significant number of participants do not\nbelieve\u201d the Antarctic division \u201cis psychologically safe, and there are\nnegative consequences for speaking up.\u201d The division says that it has since\nexpanded its leadership training programs.\n\nAs in the US, however, the problem down under hasn\u2019t gone away. At the end of\n2023, a leaked survey of women in the Australian Antarctic program showed that\nnearly one-third of survey respondents reported seeing or experiencing\nbullying or harassment in the previous two months but felt afraid to speak up\nabout it. \u201cThe reason why women don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d Nash says, \u201cis because\nthey\u2019ve been gaslit this whole time, where everyone\u2019s saying, \u2018It didn\u2019t\nhappen. I don\u2019t want to hear it. I don\u2019t believe you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe NSF has since announced changes at McMurdo, including banning the sale of\nalcohol at Gallagher\u2019s and appointing a woman as special assistant to the NSF\ndirector focusing on sexual assault and harassment prevention and response.\nLeidos told a congressional committee that it would require more security\nclearances for those wielding master keys that open multiple dorm rooms and\nthat it would install peepholes so people inside can see who\u2019s at the door.\nThe company also promised to give field teams additional satellite phones\u2014the\nsort of thing Willenbring could have used when she was stuck with Marchant.\n\u201cWe take sexual harassment and assault allegations seriously,\u201d a spokesperson\nfor Leidos told WIRED in a statement. \u201cWe also strictly enforce our policies\nprohibiting retaliation against employees who raise concerns. At Leidos, we\nexpect a safe and respectful environment for everyone.\u201d Until recently,\nhowever, the individual who Barquist said harassed her had remained employed\nby the company.\n\nRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, the ranking member of the US House Committee on\nScience, Space, and Technology, which is conducting the congressional\ninvestigation into Leidos and the NSF, says that such slow-walking should\nnever take place. \u201cLeidos has maintained a willful ignorance to the situation\non the ice.\u201d\n\nWillenbring tells me she believes the response from the NSF and others has\nbeen sluggish at best. It took six years from when she filed her complaint\nwith Boston University for the NSF to come out with fixes. With two dozen\nother countries, including Russia, the UK, and Brazil, having at least one\nbase on Antarctica, it\u2019s likely only a matter of time before more stories\nemerge. Only two other countries have guidelines in place for reporting sexual\nassault and harassment in their programs. Many nations with a presence in\nAntarctica don\u2019t have workplace harassment laws at all. As Nash puts it, some\nof those other countries \u201care going to have to have their own moment of\nreckoning.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Fabian Dattner, the organizer, tells me that\nmore than 60 new rules have been put in place to ensure a safe and productive\nenvironment. In addition to a prohibition against crew mingling with\nscientists, the voyage now has a psychologist and psychiatrist on board and\nthe ship\u2019s bar closes as early as 9:30 pm.\n\nThe harassment of female scientists in Antarctica has another consequence: the\nimpediment of the work of women such as Willenbring who have devoted their\nlives and research to better understanding climate change. There will be\nplenty of work that has to be done. A report published online in October in\nthe journal Nature Climate Change documented an alarming trend. Some of the\nwaters around Antarctica glaciers are projected to warm at a pace three times\nfaster than that of the previous century. This will cause \u201cwidespread\nincreases in ice-shelf melting, including in regions crucial for ice-sheet\nstability,\u201d the study determined. This could contribute to devastating sea\nlevel rise\u2014between 1 and 3 feet\u2014by 2100.\n\nOne glacier is no longer listed on the map: the one named for David Marchant.\nTwo years after Willenbring filed her complaint, the US Board on Geographic\nNames voted unanimously to strip Marchant\u2019s name from his coveted berg.\nWillenbring posted the news on Twitter along with the hashtag #MeTooSTEM. The\n7-mile-long glacier, which drains the slopes of the Rampart Ridge, is now\ncalled Matataua, after a nearby mountain peak. It rises far beyond McMurdo\nStation\u2014a reminder of the men who claimed the ice and the women taking it back\nbefore it\u2019s gone.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.
