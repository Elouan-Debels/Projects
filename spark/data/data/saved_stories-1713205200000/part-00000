This will enable us to be\nlean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.\"\n\nA Tesla employee who had been told he was being let go told the BBC he had\nsubsequently been locked out of his emails as had all other staff being laid\noff.\n\nThe company is set to report its quarterly earnings later this month but has\nalready reported a decline in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, its\nfirst in nearly four years and also below market expectations. Some analysts\ndescribed the results as \"tumultuous.\"\n\nLast month, Tesla reduced production at the Gigafactory in Shanghai and last\nweek Tesla told employees who work on the Cybertruck that shifts will be\nshorter on the production line at the Austin.\n\nTesla has begun to feel the impact of slowing demand for electric vehicles\n(EVs).\n\nElon Musk has recently denied reports that the company has scrapped plans to\nproduce an inexpensive car, which has been one of his longstanding goals to\nmake affordable EVs for the masses.\n\nTesla shares were down 0.8% in premarket trading on Monday.\n\nThe EV maker has been slow to refresh its aging models as high interest rates\nhave sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items.\n\nThere is also the ongoing pressure from China as the rise of their inexpensive\nEVs have begun to flood the market with affordable models.\n\n## Tesla 'disaster' with fewest deliveries since 2022\n\n## Chinese smartphone giant takes on Tesla\n\n## Tesla warns of 'notably lower' sales growth in 2024\n\n## Tesla to settle over fatal Autopilot crash\n\nElon Musk\n\nTesla\n\nTransport\n\nRelated\n\n## Elon Musk to visit India for meeting with PM Modi\n\n4 days ago\n\nAsia\n\n## Tesla to settle over fatal Autopilot crash\n\n6 days ago\n\nTechnology\n\n## Brazil Supreme Court judge opens inquiry into Musk\n\n7 days ago\n\nLatin America\n\nMore\n\n20 mins ago\n\n## Railway station bridge lowered into place\n\nTwo massive cranes were involved in the operation to put the new bridge in\nplace\n\n20 mins ago\n\nScotland\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?\n\nIf you face disruption because flights are cancelled or delayed, then what can\nyou do?\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n4 hrs ago\n\n## Rail station bridge replacement lowered into place\n\nTwo massive cranes helped put the structure in place to improve passenger\naccess in Dumfries.\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nSouth Scotland\n\n8 hrs ago\n\n## Bus passengers stunned after six routes withdrawn\n\nThe local council says it is coming up with new timetables after a bus company\ncancelled services.\n\n8 hrs ago\n\nEngland\n\n3 days ago\n\n## City park and ride car park to be expanded\n\nSniperley Park and Ride in Durham will have almost 600 parking spaces, up from\nits current 326.\n\n3 days ago\n\nEngland\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
