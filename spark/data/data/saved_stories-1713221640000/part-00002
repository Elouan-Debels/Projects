See\nour ethics statement.\n\nPhoto illustration by The Verge / Photo: Dropbox\n\nToday, I\u2019m talking with Dropbox CEO Drew Houston. Drew co-founded Dropbox way\nback in 2007, and he\u2019s among the last of the founder-CEOs of that era still\nstanding. Seventeen years is a long time to be with one company, and you\u2019ll\nhear us talk a lot about all the change he\u2019s seen in the industry.\n\nDropbox seems like a simple idea: By now, cloud storage is something pretty\nmuch all of us rely on in some way. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. You\u2019ll hear\nDrew talk about the early days, when Apple tried to acquire Dropbox and Steve\nJobs pretty derisively told Drew and his co-founder that Dropbox was a\n\u201cfeature, not a product.\u201d\n\nSince then, a lot of companies have tried to build Dropbox-like features into\ntheir products: Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Apple\u2019s own iCloud Drive\nall exist. But Dropbox has managed to fend them all off \u2014 something Drew\nattributes to working well across platforms instead of trying to lock you into\none company.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014\nand other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nBut as Drew looked to the future, he decided to make a big bet on AI and turn\nDropbox\u2019s platform-agnostic approach into something that helps people stay\norganized across devices and browsers. There\u2019s a lot of AI hype out there, and\nit\u2019s clear Drew is a big AI optimist \u2014 but he has a refreshingly sober take on\nwhat AI is right now as compared to what it can or may be in a decade, and on\nhow winding the path from \u201ctoday\u201d to \u201csome nebulous future\u201d actually is. Right\nnow, Drew points out, the value from AI is definitely mostly going to\nNvidia... but he\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s going to change, and that the rest of us\nare going to come along for the ride.\n\nYou\u2019ll also hear us talk about how Dropbox \u2014 an entire company devoted to\nproducts that make our remote work life easier \u2014 reinvented its entire\nconception of virtual work after covid. The company is almost entirely remote\nnow, and Drew and I talked a lot about how he made that decision and the\nbenefits and drawbacks that he\u2019s seen from it.\n\nDrew\u2019s seen a lot in the past 17 years, and he\u2019s pretty clear-eyed about the\nindustry. I think you\u2019re going to like this one.\n\nOkay: Dropbox CEO Drew Houston. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nDrew Houston, you\u2019re the co-founder and CEO of Dropbox. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nI\u2019ve got to tell the audience: This is a very special episode, because Drew is\nin the studio with me.\n\nI am!\n\nWe\u2019re looking at each other. Usually, Decoder is done remotely because people\nare all over the place and time zones are weird, but you and I are together,\nwhich means there\u2019s going to be a lot of cross-talking about AI. You can just\nfeel it coming.\n\nAwesome.\n\nI feel like people are fairly familiar with Dropbox. It\u2019s a file syncing\nservice. It\u2019s been around for a long time. You\u2019ve been the CEO the whole time,\nwhich is unusual. That\u2019s quite a journey. I want to talk about it all, but\ngive us your view of what Dropbox is now.\n\nDecoder is in the running for a Webby Award, and we need your vote to win!\nSupport us by voting for the People\u2019s Voice business podcast category here.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Dropbox is solving the 2024 version of the problem I started\nwith back in 2007. When I started Dropbox, I started because I kept forgetting\nmy thumb drive, emailing myself files, all the things we used to have to do,\nbut that was really under this bigger problem I had of: \u201cMy stuff is\neverywhere; I can\u2019t find it.\u201d In the beginning, the solution to that looked\nlike, \u201cOh, I should sync my files to the cloud and across all these different\ndevices with different operating systems that don\u2019t talk to each other.\u201d But\nfast-forward to today, and we have a lot of the same problems. My stuff is\neverywhere. I can\u2019t find it. A lot of things are different. What used to be\n100 files on my desktop is now 100 tabs in my browser or actually both. You\nhave 100 files on your desktop and 100 tabs in your browser.\n\nA lot of that\u2019s for good reason because we have all these amazing new tools.\nBut I think there\u2019s also a sense that maybe we\u2019ve gotten too much of a good\nthing, and we have a very fragmented and cluttered environment, and then this\ncreates a bunch of problems, this kind of death by a thousand paper cuts. And\nsome really important experiences have gone backward. So, take something like\nsearch. Search was actually better 20 years ago than it was today when it\ncomes to searching your stuff for your company\u2019s stuff because you just search\nyour hard drive, maybe your email. But that was kind of it. But now,\nbizarrely, we live in this world where it\u2019s easier to search all of human\nknowledge with a Google search than your own stuff or your company\u2019s\nknowledge. When you go to work, you have 10 search boxes, not one.\n\nWe\u2019re thinking a lot about these problems. How do we evolve Dropbox beyond\nfile syncing to organize all your cloud stuff? There\u2019s a lot we\u2019re doing with\nthe core Dropbox app to do that. And we\u2019ve also been introducing new products\nlike Dropbox Dash, which is AI-powered universal search. It works not just\nwith your files, but it\u2019ll search your Google Docs, your email, your Slack,\nyour Salesforce \u2014 all of your different apps have one search bar that searches\neverything. And then, we\u2019re doing a lot with AI and really personalizing AI to\nbe able to answer a lot of the questions that ChatGPT can\u2019t. If you think\nabout questions like \u201cWhen does my lease expire?\u201d or \u201cWhere\u2019s the slide from\nlast year\u2019s product launch where we talked about that?\u201d ChatGPT can\u2019t answer\nthese questions because it\u2019s not connected to your stuff.\n\nBut that\u2019s what we do at Dropbox. We\u2019ve always been platform-agnostic and\ntrusted, and we can build a lot of that capability because Dropbox is already\nconnected to your most important information. In a lot of ways, we\u2019re back to\nthe fundamentals of, in 2024, 2027, or 2030, what\u2019s the best way to search,\norganize, and share content in a world that\u2019s fragmented, and how do we fill\nin these missing pieces like giving you search back, helping you organize your\nstuff, making it easier to share things in a mixed format? If you have a\nGoogle Doc and a 10-gig 4K video, there\u2019s not really an Airtable and iOS\nlinked to a website or something. There\u2019s not really a common container that\nholds all of that. That\u2019s a bit of a snapshot of the fundamental problems\nwe\u2019re working on just around how you organize, share, and secure your content.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot in there. I actually want to hold on to this idea of a universal\ncontainer for one second. I am kind of fascinated by people\u2019s relationship to\ninformation and how it\u2019s stored. One of my favorite stories we did years ago\nnow was about college students who didn\u2019t know how file systems work, and\ntheir STEM professors had to stop and not actually teach astronomy for a day\nand teach them how the file system on a Windows computer works so they could\nuse the radio telescope, which was generating files and putting them in a file\nsystem.\n\nPeople have a lot of feelings about that, but that\u2019s related to a generation\nof people who grew up with totally abstracted file systems on iPhones and\niPads, on Chromebooks, on whatever. And you don\u2019t even think about that\nanymore. You have this core feature, which is syncing files across multiple\nplatforms in the cloud. Now, you\u2019re saying I need to expand that to all kinds\nof things. I think about those things, and there\u2019s nothing about that that\nsays that is the same file system or information structure at all. The stuff\nin my Slack \u2014 I don\u2019t think Slack is generating files in any way, shape, or\nform. Google Docs is a file, but it\u2019s totally abstracted, versus a photo from\nmy phone, which is a file but is equally abstracted. How do you think about\nsynthesizing all of that?\n\nWell, it\u2019s going back to first principles, just recognizing it doesn\u2019t have to\nbe like this. Sometimes you can look at history, and I don\u2019t mean history,\nhistory \u2014 I\u2019m just like, it actually always wasn\u2019t like this. In the physical\nworld, you would go to sleep, and you\u2019d wake back up, and the papers on your\ndesk were still there. With your computer, when you reboot your computer, the\nfiles are still there. But when you\u2019re in the browser realm, once you get to\n100 tabs, you either nuke the whole browser and clear everything out because\nyou\u2019re declaring tab bankruptcy and you\u2019re just overwhelmed, or your operating\nsystem updates itself in a weird way where you lose everything. But I think a\nwhole generation of people is growing up without this basic idea: hey, you\nshould have your stuff, and it should be possible to organize your stuff. It\ndoesn\u2019t have to be mayhem.\n\nAnd so, there are these problems in plain sight like that. Search is one\nexample, but organizing is another. When you think about the web world, it\njust evolved without really a container concept and just bizarre because files\nhave folders, songs have playlists, links have... There\u2019s not really an answer\nto that. I think we\u2019ll look back on that and be like, \u201cThat was really weird.\u201d\nAnd then you think about \u2014 in addition to just the fundamental container \u2014 how\nyou have a universal container. There\u2019s also intelligence when you use\nNetflix, Spotify, or YouTube \u2014 even when you sign up as a new user. The\nsystem\u2019s smart. It knows what the world likes to watch or listen to, and then\nit presents you with good options. But then, when you go to work, there\u2019s\nreally no intelligence in that system. You can\u2019t even wrap your arms around\nwhere is your stuff, because it lives in 10 different places. In the consumer\nrealm, the system\u2019s always learning from you. You\u2019re not even filing things\naway. It\u2019s just curating your experience. You just watch stuff.\n\nDo you think that\u2019s good or bad? I mean that question sincerely. Dropbox\nstarted as: You will have a file system in the cloud that we express natively\non whatever device you\u2019re on. It\u2019ll look like a folder in macOS. It\u2019ll look\nlike a folder in Windows. We\u2019re just extending this concept to the cloud, and\nthat\u2019s really powerful.\n\nNow, we\u2019re at this place where people don\u2019t even know the file systems exist.\nThe most productive people that I can think of are in control of their files\nand folders. They think about it. They have naming conventions for all the\nfiles they might need to make whatever document they need to produce in the\nend. Then, there\u2019s the class of people that are just like, \u201cIt\u2019s chaos, and I\nsearch Google Drive, and I can\u2019t tell if we did a good thing, but abstracting\naway the file system.\u201d\n\nWhat was great about the file system, in the beginning, was that it was where\nall your stuff was. It was like a single source of truth. Everything worked\nout of the file system. And so, we\u2019ve created a number by solving one set of\nproblems. Files have limitations \u2014 you can\u2019t real-time collaborate. We use\nthings like Google Docs because you get all these real-time collaboration, and\nthe browser brings a lot of benefits. But then, we fractured the whole stack\nbecause the web world and filed world don\u2019t talk to each other. As we were\njust covering, the web world doesn\u2019t really have persistence or organization.\nAny way you look at it, I think about: Alright, I opened my laptop in 2027,\nand I want to get to my work stuff. What do I see? Hopefully, we can do better\nthan literally one finder window open that literally hasn\u2019t changed since 1984\nand then a browser with 100 tabs sprayed across the top to the point where you\ncan\u2019t even see text or titles anymore.\n\nI think we can do better from a UX standpoint. I think these things do get\nbetter. There are a couple examples I think about. One is TV. The way TV\nevolved, first, it was broadcast over the air, maybe 10 channels. That was\ngreat. Then, you get basic cable and then you\u2019re like 30 channels. But then,\nsomewhere along the way, from 100 to 1,000 channels, it sort of lost the plot.\nYou\u2019re like, I just want to watch the Super Bowl, but why am I paging through\nall this music for channels at a time? What is going on? And Comcast just\nthought they were giving people what they wanted. We were asking for more\nchannels, more stuff.\n\nBut it turned out what we needed wasn\u2019t the next 1,000 channels. What we\nreally needed was something like Netflix or these smart rethought systems\ndesigned to scale up to millions of things in the catalog and give you access\nto all of them, but the user interface uses primarily machine learning to\nidentify what you want and recommend things and gets rid of a lot of the\nconstraints of linear TV. So, I think we\u2019re in that 1,000 productivity tools\nera when we really need a rethought system and a rethought environment.\nThere\u2019s a lot to learn from those kinds of evolutions. TV is one example. You\ncould say the same thing about music. MP3s, you used to play them out of\nfolders, and then Apple\u2019s like, \u201cHang on, this is dumb. We should just have a\nmusic catalog and iTunes. It should be by artists and album and everything.\u201d\nAnd then Spotify\u2019s like, \u201cHang on, why should I have to buy these songs one at\na time? I should just have an infinity everything catalog.\u201d\n\nAnd then, there were new generations after that. It\u2019s like, well, anything I\nlisten to or watch should all be together. There\u2019s a whole continuum of\nintelligent experiences ranging from: You can still use Spotify as an iTunes-\nstyle catalog and manually curate everything. You can go all the way to the\nother end of the spectrum and be like, \u201cAI DJ, just press play.\u201d But then, a\nlot of stuff in between, like, oh, this artist radio, genre radio. And so,\nwhen you look at the consumer realm, there\u2019s just this whole rich ecosystem of\ndifferent ways that you can solve these problems. Then you go to your desktop\nat work or your workspace, and there\u2019s just none of that intelligence or\ndesign has made its way over. We see that as a huge opportunity for Dropbox to\nrethink this.\n\nI could spend the entire rest of the show talking about how much better my\nrelationship with music was when I was individually editing ID3 tags and MP3s.\nI will not do that, but rest assured, I could.\n\nThat\u2019s a big vision in the future. Dropbox today, the core business, is still\nselling people cloud storage. How is that split?\n\nDropbox has about 18 million subscribers, two and a half billion in revenue,\nand almost a billion in free cash flow. It is mostly people using Dropbox at\nwork. About 80 percent of people who use Dropbox use it for work or for a\nmixed personal and work use case. We certainly have a lot of folks who have\nused Dropbox over the years to share photos or for their personal lives, but\nwe really thought the problems that weren\u2019t solving themselves were in the\nwork universe. A lot of the sort of paper cuts I just described are a lot more\nacute in the working environment than at home.\n\nWe\u2019re about 2,600 people. We\u2019re 90 percent remote. We have this Virtual First\nworking model that has been awesome for us. We compete with folks like\nMicrosoft and Google. And with all the office suites, usually, you can get\nOneDrive or you can get Google Drive, but a lot of why people use Dropbox\ntoday is because it\u2019s platform-agnostic. A lot of our customers do a lot of\nexternal sharing with clients, or if you run a marketing agency or something,\nyou\u2019re interacting with dozens of different organizations. Dropbox is the best\nat doing that because it just works on every platform regardless of what your\nclients or partners are using.\n\nFor big files, video production, and the creative community, Dropbox has long\nbeen standard because we handle big file syncing and that volume of data\nbetter than anyone else. We\u2019ve built a really great trust relationship and\nreally focused on ease of use and security, privacy. We\u2019re uncomplicated in\nthat we\u2019re not trying to advertise against your data \u2014 we\u2019re just focused on\ntaking care of your stuff. That\u2019s a little bit of a snapshot of where we are\ntoday. And then, we see expanding to all your cloud stuff or all of your\ncontent as a natural extension of where we started, which is taking care of\nall your important files.\n\nThe thing you described where you\u2019re competing against OneDrive or Google\nDrive, even I imagine, to some extent, the iCloud features, there\u2019s a very\nfamous story from the beginning of Dropbox where Steve Jobs tried to acquire\nthe company. You said no. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d but just\nintegrating this \u2014\n\nGood times.\n\nDo you want to tell that story real quickly?\n\nSure!\n\nDropbox was scaling like crazy because my co-founder, Arash [Ferdowsi], and I\njust started the company, and \u2014 it wasn\u2019t literally out of a dorm room but\nlooked like one. We just had this idea; it took off, and then we were scaling\nvirally because we had this freemium model where people would spread Dropbox.\nAnd so, we got the attention of all the big platform companies, and we were\ninvited to come down and meet Steve. I remember Arash [Ferdowsi] and I jumped\nin a Zipcar from our apartment in San Francisco, and we were driving down to 1\nInfinite Loop in Cupertino. And we walk in, and we\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019re here to see\nSteve Jobs.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cHave a seat.\u201d We go into the boardroom, and\nSteve comes in, and he starts his pitch. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re like a startup\nwith infinite resources, and you should really throw in with us, and here\u2019s\nwhy.\u201d\n\nWe were having a great time building the company, and for a lot of reasons, we\nwere just like, \u201cWe admire everything that Apple\u2019s done. We\u2019d love to find any\nway to work together, but we think it\u2019s right for us... We\u2019re having a great\ntime building this company independently.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\nunderstand.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think he loved that response. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re a feature, not a\nproduct. You don\u2019t have distribution. You don\u2019t have this or that. You don\u2019t\ncontrol the operating system.\u201d I was like, \u201cAlright, agree to disagree.\u201d\nBecause every pair of companies has its issues, too. Apple controls Apple\nstuff, but they don\u2019t control Google stuff. They don\u2019t control Microsoft stuff\nand vice versa. That dynamic is exactly why Dropbox exists in the first place:\nyou need a way to go across all the platforms. But yeah, no, it was intense.\nThat was like 2009. But to see Steve onstage in 2011 at WWDC launch an iCloud,\ncalling us out by name, that was just the beginning of a whole competitive\nperiod where we\u2019re drafted up to the big leagues and fighting with not just\nApple but Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and then a raft of other\ncompanies in our space. So you get your hazing ritual as you get bigger.\n\nThat line \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re a feature, not a product.\u201d I\u2019ve heard this issued as a\ncriticism of maybe half of the startups I\u2019ve covered, and mostly, it\u2019s true.\nThey are features, and then they get Sherlocked into an operating system or\nintegrated into some other thing, and they disappear. They get acquired or\nsomething. That has not been true for Dropbox. Seventeen years now, and you\u2019re\nstill the CEO.\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nWhy do you think you\u2019ve managed to persist?\n\nFirst, the nature of our problem is that we need this platform-agnostic way of\nmanaging all of our stuff. In the \u201990s, you had the Windows / Intel\nmonoculture, but that\u2019s just not our reality anymore. The truth is we all have\naccounts on all of these things, and we\u2019ve had to get a lot clearer and more\nfocused about, \u201cWhere is the value we provide?\u201d If we\u2019re just storage, then\nyou\u2019re right; that might be a feature. That\u2019s not that strategic, or it\u2019s a\ncommodity or whatever. We\u2019d hear those criticisms, and often, I wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily disagree. I\u2019d be like, \u201cWait, but our business keeps growing, and\nour revenue per user keeps going up, not down.\u201d That\u2019s a weird commodity, for\nexample. And then, a lot of it was just talking to our customers, and often,\nthey would say things that tripped some wire in my head.\n\nFor example, they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, Dropbox doesn\u2019t just keep my files in sync \u2014\nit keeps my team in sync.\u201d Or, \u201cIt\u2019s where I go to work. It\u2019s my workplace.\u201d\nAnd over the years, comments like that would stick, where like, \u201cWait, okay,\nthat\u2019s super interesting.\u201d I guess that\u2019s maybe the thing that maybe I\nmight\u2019ve misunderstood or Steve misunderstood. It\u2019s like, wait, yeah, we\u2019re\nnot selling storage. It\u2019s really the sharing, or it\u2019s the fact that we can be\nyour digital environment. That\u2019s what people were buying.\n\nAnd then, we\u2019re just like, oh, there\u2019s just one problem. Dropbox was never\nreally purpose-built for that, but what if it were? So, we decided to really\nfocus on collaboration and lean into our advantages in terms of being\nplatform-agnostic and trust and not advertising against your content and\nthings like that. Fundamentally, we\u2019ve also really cared about keeping the\nexperience easy to use and taking care of our customers. And so, we still have\na loyal base of a double-digit million number of subscribers. We have a very\nstrong foundation we\u2019re building on.\n\nI should just ask this dumb question. Dropbox is fundamentally in the business\nof selling storage. You buy hard drives in the cloud, and then people put\ntheir files on it. Do you ever see the budget for hard drives? Does someone\nshow up in your office and is like, \u201cWe have to buy 10 more hard drives\ntoday\u201d? What is that like?\n\nOh, yeah, capacity planning. Sure.\n\nSee, you have a fancier term for it.\n\nYeah, we have a phenomenal team that manages all of our technical\ninfrastructure, including all the procurement and operation of our data\ncenters and hardware and things like that.\n\nDo you ever pick up the phone to [call] Western Digital or Seagate?\n\nTotally, yeah.\n\nSay, \u201cI need 2,000 hard drives, stat!\u201d\n\nNot like a trading floor, but totally. And we have to manage our whole supply\nand not just hard drives but computers or servers and all the networking, all\nthe elements of the stack. So, for sure, we have to go many, many levels down\nto the metal, and we are in the business of storage or hard drives the same\nway that Apple\u2019s in the business of glass and aluminum. Those are ingredients,\nbut that\u2019s not really what people are buying. People are buying \u201chaving all of\nmy stuff in one place or being able to search it, being able to share.\u201d\n\nThis is a refinement that I\u2019ve had to do over the years. Initially, I was\nlike, yeah, we sell storage, we sync your files, but then when we saw like,\n\u201cOh wait, what space do we really occupy in our customer\u2019s minds?\u201d Their\ndescription is often very different: you help me run my business, you help me\nmake my album, or you help me produce my videos or basically get a livelihood.\nAnd that always sends us thinking about things differently when we better\nunderstand how people actually feel about Dropbox and what they\u2019re really\nhiring us to do.\n\nWhen you think about your set of competitors now, I can name a bunch of weird\ncompanies. DocuSign is probably a competitor to Dropbox in some meaningful\nway. Who do you think of as your biggest competitors?\n\nIt\u2019s really the office suites because 100 percent of our customers are going\nto have either [Microsoft] Office or Google Workspace. So, certainly, file\nsyncing to share is a dominant category. The biggest competitive challenge is\none where there\u2019s something bundled with each of the suites. And then second,\nwe\u2019re 17 years in, and so the category has matured to some extent. There\u2019s not\nsome new continent of people who haven\u2019t heard of Dropbox or syncing or\nsomething. And so, on the one hand, that is true, but then you look at the\nproblems we\u2019ve been talking about. We\u2019re like, yeah, the cloud world has no\ngood solutions to these problems. It\u2019s super fragmented. The UX is flawed in\nall these ways, and there\u2019s all this opportunity to bring in a lot of the\nstuff that has proven to work on the consumer side into the productivity\nrealm. Zero customers have these problems solved. There are a billion\nknowledge workers. It\u2019s a huge opportunity in front of us.\n\nLet\u2019s do the Decoder questions, talk about how Dropbox is organized, and then\ntalk about how you\u2019re going after these problems.\n\nYou said 2,600 people. You\u2019re all remote. That was a big Dropbox moment. How\nis the company structured?\n\nDuring the pandemic or before the pandemic, we were kind of a classic tech\ncompany: huge office in San Francisco, mostly Bay Area.\n\nLike a really fancy office.\n\nIt\u2019s super nice.\n\nThere\u2019s a rumor that your cafeteria had a Michelin star.\n\nHe should have. That was always something we had hoped to do. But yeah, we had\nthis awesome space, this awesome food, just an incredibly vibrant in-person\ncommunity. Then covid happens. I think that sort of turned everybody upside\ndown. First, we were preoccupied with the challenge of all of that and this\ntrauma that everybody\u2019s going through. But then, as we thought about it, we\u2019re\nlike, \u201cHey, wait, this the nature of...\u201d Well, first of all, we all just went\nremote overnight, and this forced migration to this forced beta test of hybrid\ndistributed work. It worked a lot better than we thought. People loved not\ncommuting and the flexibility to live anywhere. For the first time since the\nconcept first arose in probably the \u201950s or \u201960s, you could actually work from\nanywhere.\n\nThe stars had aligned in a really terrible way. But one of the silver linings\nwas we can actually decouple work from our physical environment, which can\nhave a lot of benefits. And so, we\u2019re like, hey, the floorboards have been\nripped up, this is really chaotic, but we don\u2019t have to put them down the same\nway. And so, it\u2019s a huge opportunity to really be able to design the work\nexperience in ways that our parents never could. So, we thought about this,\nand then, as a practical matter, people were like, \u201cCan I move? What are we\ngoing to do after lockdown? Can I move away? Can I not? Are we going to have\nto commute?\u201d\n\nSo, we thought about it like, alright, well, there is no substitute for the\nin-person experience and meeting face-to-face. Our biological wiring isn\u2019t\ngoing to change. That said, you can get a lot done on Zoom. How do we get the\nbest of both worlds? How do we give people that flexibility but also keep the\nhuman part, the team cohesion, and build relationships and trust and all the\nthings that are hard to do on Zoom? Also, how do we avoid the worst of both\nworlds, which is this two-, three-day hybrid compromise? The problem with that\n\u2014 I mean there are many problems with that, but one is you\u2019re still on a leash\nto whatever the office space is. You can\u2019t live outside commuting distance.\nMaybe you\u2019re commuting less, but you\u2019re still spending a lot of time in a car\nor train or whatever, which is a totally dead time.\n\nAnd then, if it\u2019s the same two days a week, then that\u2019s great because\neverybody\u2019s there, but then it\u2019s super inefficient. Your CFO is like, \u201cI don\u2019t\nreally love paying for a 70 percent vacant office space.\u201d If it\u2019s\nunsynchronized, it\u2019s totally self-defeating because then you\u2019re commuting to a\nhalf-empty office. What\u2019s the point? What\u2019s happened since is even worse. It\u2019s\nlike, \u201cWell, I\u2019m commuting to a half-empty office to literally be back in the\nsame Zoom meeting, which I can come back to.\u201d\n\nThis is my personal nightmare.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s just thinking about this from first principles. For me, a lot of\nmy heroes are the tech founders that you\u2019d imagine. But then also, a lot of my\nheroes are the management thinkers \u2014 Peter Drucker, [W. Edwards] Deming,\nAlfred Sloan, Henry Ford, people like that. I think a lot of that, Drucker\nwould\u2019ve looked at this as there\u2019s a huge opportunity here to rethink this. So\nwe thought about it. We studied all the remote-first companies. We decided not\nto be 100 percent remote because you lose the in-person part. We decided to be\n90 percent. Then, 10 percent is really a more concentrated dose of human\nconnections. So, don\u2019t just do Zoom things when you\u2019re together as you would\nin-office \u2014 really think about when you think about the most memorable\nexperiences in your working career. It\u2019s usually not some windowless\nconference room or a daily stand-up. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re off in some nice\nplace or can zoom out a little bit.\n\nThat\u2019s what we basically studied from all the remote-first companies. We\nsynthesized all the findings into our own way of working called Virtual First.\nWe open-sourced it, and we\u2019ll tell you how it works. And it was a full send.\nThis is October 2020. A lot of other companies were like, \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you in\nthree months, every three months.\u201d I didn\u2019t know that was an option, but we\nreally felt like we owe it to our employees to give them clarity about their\nlives and help unblock these big decisions around where they live and how this\nis going to work.\n\nBut that also meant torching all of the stuff I talked about before where we\ncame from this super vibrant in-person culture. That meant just permanently\ntorching that for this speculative idea that we couldn\u2019t even really put into\npractice until lockdown ended. So, that was a pretty wild decision. But fast-\nforward: today, it really works. People are 90 percent remote. We used to have\n75 percent of our employees in the big tech hubs. Now, that\u2019s like 50 percent.\nThat means we\u2019ve gotten all these awesome people in these places who never\nwould\u2019ve joined Dropbox before at all levels. Places like Boston, LA, and\nChicago went from zero people working there to now all those places have 100\nor hundreds.\n\nDo they go into offices together, or are they all working from home?\n\nNope. We don\u2019t ask people to commute to any office. We will do a lot of in-\nperson programming of different kinds. We also allow people to self-organize,\nand we do have hubs where we do have some space. So, in San Francisco, we\nconverted our offices into what we call studios. We ripped out all the\nindividual workstations and things like that and turned all of our offices\ninto these convening and collaborative spaces that are really designed more\nfor that human connection piece called Studios. That said, I think\nutilization\u2019s been pretty low.\n\nI was going to ask about your CFOs. They\u2019re still pretty mad that you have a\nbunch of empty office space?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of vacant office space in San Francisco, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re\nalone in that. We have managed to sublet a lot of it. Mostly, we\u2019re just\nfollowing; we see our employees as our customers. We will support however they\nwant to gather, but we\u2019re finding that these retreats and off-sites and things\nlike that are often a lot more effective than asking people to commute.\n\nDo you think the big fancy office and the perks and the chef who should have\ngotten a Michelin star \u2014 was that just zero interest rate VC? You\u2019ve been at\nit for a long time. You\u2019re one of the few CEOs here who\u2019s been the CEO of a\ncompany through all the stages for almost two decades, and there was a\nparticular kind of excess in those early moments that is gone. Is that just a\npure zero-interest rate phenomenon? Is that something else that\u2019s changed?\n\nI think it\u2019s a zero-interest rate phenomenon combined with the pre-covid world\nwhere the reason why it was easier to get five people in an office five days a\nweek is because they didn\u2019t have an option. This whole flexibility thing\nwasn\u2019t in the cards. I think that\u2019s what a lot of CEOs today misunderstand.\nThey keep mashing the go back to 2019 button, and they see it\u2019s not working.\nThen they just push harder, and then you have this really toxic relationship.\nI don\u2019t see that coming back. I think the market will tell us eventually,\nactually, if it is really the profitable way and best way to get great talent\nto have these to go back to 2015 or something like maybe, but I don\u2019t think\nso.\n\nThat was the argument back then: \u201cWe need to have these perks in order to hire\ntalent in these places. Google has water slides, and Facebook will buy you\nPicasso. If we don\u2019t do these perks and give away the massages and the food,\nthen no one will come work here.\u201d Do you think that was true? I wonder if that\nwas actually true.\n\nIt was true. I think we experienced the biggest war for talent that I\u2019ve ever\nseen in my working lifetime over that period. Again, it\u2019s like if you have two\nequal options you\u2019re going to take, and then this one has all this cushy\nstuff, you can understand how that would resonate with people. It created a\nlot of problems, too. Even in that world, I get a sense of complacency or\nentitlement that\u2019s problematic if you want to keep scaling your company and\nreally compete. I think there were some hard lessons learned on that front\nthat a lot of it is unhealthy.\n\nBut I think now people have voted with their feet that they value flexibility\na lot more than snacks in the office. At home, you can set up your environment\nexactly how you want it and not just have snacks but your dog and something\nthat\u2019s totally purpose-built for you. So, I think forcing people back into the\noffice is sort of trying to force people back into movie theaters \u2014 maybe you\ncan do it for Top Gun once \u2014 or getting people back into malls or something.\nIt was cool. Movie theaters were great, and malls were great for their time,\nbut the world has moved on.\n\nHow is Dropbox actually structured now? You went to this fully virtual\nsituation. You gathered people together, but how is the actual company\norganized?\n\nPretty conventionally. I have a GM of my core business, a GM of Dropbox Dash,\nwhich is our universal search product, and a lot of what I was talking about\nwith organizing all your cloud stuff, all of our customer-facing functions\nlike sales and marketing, and then all of our G&A functions. So pretty typical\ntech organization where you have business units that are really around product\ndevelopment, and then these horizontal functions are not going to market\naround G&A, so like finance and legal people.\n\nBut that\u2019s a tougher metamorphosis than it sounds because of the basic scaling\nchallenge that you have. You start by building. Everybody\u2019s artisanally\ncrafting a great product together, and then, as CEO, as you\u2019re building a\ncompany, you have to do this metamorphosis from just working on a product to\nbuilding a machine that repeatedly builds products in a super competitive\nenvironment. And so, that\u2019s the journey we\u2019ve been on over the last several\nyears \u2014 really getting to that second act. There are parts where we\u2019ve done a\nlot of stuff well. There are parts where we\u2019ve had a ton of challenges, but\nwith things like AI and a lot of the new doors that are open now, it\u2019s super\nexciting, period.\n\nThis is the Decoder question: You\u2019ve made a lot of decisions. You\u2019re making\nsome decisions about what to invest in now. How do you make decisions? What\u2019s\nyour framework?\n\nCarefully and in a pretty structured way, actually. We had to think about this\na lot, especially as we moved to Virtual First and during lockdown and so on.\nWhen we studied a lot of the remote-first companies, one thing was very clear:\nit is not a good idea to just take what you\u2019re doing in person and try to\nphotocopy that or just try to do the same thing on Zoom. Otherwise, you\u2019re\njust in meetings all the time, and you just have to operate differently. And\nthen, one quote from [Jeff Bezos] that stuck with me was that when someone\nasked him what\u2019s the single best decision you\u2019ve ever made in your career at\nAmazon, his response was, \u201cThe best decision I ever made was banning\nPowerPoint in my company and shifting to this narrative-based memo culture.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s super important, both in general and especially in a\ndistributed and remote world. Well, why is that? That seems very specific.\nWhat\u2019s the difference? There are a lot of reasons. So, a PowerPoint is not as\nmuch about the ideas as much as presentation \u2014 it\u2019s a very slow method of\ncommunicating. People can read a lot faster than they can talk. We\u2019ve all been\nin those endless deck meetings where someone asks a question and that\u2019s\naddressed two slides later if we can just get there. And then, Amazon\npioneered this model of writing six-page memos. It\u2019s kind of awkward when you\nstart. They actually start the first 20 minutes of every meeting being\ncompletely silent and study hauling a document. But then, there are enormous\nbenefits of that, which are, one, writing forces a clarity of thought that a\nPowerPoint doesn\u2019t because you can smear a few bullets on a PowerPoint and be\ndone. But to really crystallize your thoughts is a very challenging process.\n\nIt\u2019s tough for the writer, but it makes it much better for the reader, and\nthere are a lot more readers than writers. So you know that after that 20\nminutes or half hour or whatever, everybody\u2019s completely on the same page.\nThey all have the same high-def picture of what is the problem we\u2019re focused\non, what is the decision we\u2019re making. The teams had to already pre-do a lot\nof the work to get alignment that results in that narrative. Just in 10\ndifferent ways, you get much higher quality and faster decisions through a\nnarrative culture or through this practice of memos and writing and\ndocumenting. When we studied the remote-first companies, most of them were\nlike, \u201cYou have to document a lot more to be efficient.\u201d\n\nAre you doing this?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAll the meetings start with 20 minutes of silence for you to read the six-page\nmemos?\n\nYeah. Amazon was really smart about how they thought about scale more broadly.\nSo memos are one example, but then how you structure your senior team \u2014 if you\ndo this memo thing, you can actually have a larger executive team because you\ndon\u2019t have as many people talking over each other. There\u2019s a great book called\nWorking Backwards by two former Amazon execs, Bill [Carr] and Colin [Bryar],\nwho actually worked with them to deploy a lot of these Amazon practices within\nDropbox. And we customize them a bit. You can\u2019t totally just photocopy stuff\ninto your company, but we adapted a lot of it, and we\u2019ve made it work really\nwell. I think it\u2019s helped us be a lot more efficient. It\u2019s not a panacea. I\nthink it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s really challenging for a lot of people to build\nthat muscle and write well. It takes a lot of time. So that\u2019s often a\nstruggle. You can lose the plot where you over-index on the document more than\nthe decision you\u2019re making. So, you have to put some guardrails in to\nconstrain how much it becomes about document writing versus just moving. But\nin aggregate, it\u2019s been a hugely helpful process for us.\n\nI do like it when a company\u2019s culture trends into memo warfare. There\u2019s a\nparticular kind of passive aggressiveness that you can see express itself,\nwhich I find very entertaining. I used to work at AOL \u2014 that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ll say about that. But give me an example of how you\nturn that into decision-making because I ask this question a lot. Amazon comes\nup a lot. They have the famous type-one, type-two decisions about one-way\ndoors and two-way doors. But the connection between, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve taken that,\nI\u2019ve taken some of this culture,\u201d and \u201cThis is how I make decisions,\u201d I find\noften to be quite fuzzy. Walk me through how you actually make decisions.\n\nI think we\u2019re the first company I can think of that really put forward a one-\nway door and strong perspective on what life\u2019s going to be like after\nlockdown. I can walk you through how that happened. We really formalized the\nAmazon memo culture in the last couple of years, but that wasn\u2019t the first\ntime we used documents for decision-making. We had a lot of discussions about\npotential futures or what\u2019s life going to be like after covid. And there was a\nperiod where we were all brainstorming and trying to figure out different\nthings and figure out a working model. I can still remember we all were on\nZoom. I was in a room above my garage in a summer place in New Hampshire in\nthis shed. I just remember all the tiles of faces as we\u2019re making this. Do we\njust torch our entire company culture and just pray that this works?\n\nDid you find in that moment that you were spending more time with more people,\nbut you felt more alone? Maybe that was a very personal experience to me, but\nI was like, \u201cI\u2019m talking to more people than I talk to all the time. We\u2019re all\non the grid all the time. Thirty people are always here now, but I\u2019m more\nlonely than I\u2019ve been in forever.\u201d\n\nThat goes back to our wiring, the sense of relief we all got when lockdown\nended and you could meet with people again. Again, remote is great, and the\nflexibility is awesome, but there\u2019s no substitute for that. If you want to\nbuild relationships with people, build trust, which is super important. You\ncan sustain relationships on Zoom; you can\u2019t build relationships on Zoom \u2014 or\nmost people can\u2019t. So, it is a very isolating and fatiguing experience. I\nthink it\u2019s a lot more than just memo culture. One or two things: There\u2019s this\nwhole set of practices that we do to make Virtual First effective. Part of it\nis the in-person gathering. Second is ways to curtail meeting load. When\npeople are in different time zones, you could end up with meetings all morning\nthrough night. So, we have this core collaboration hours concept where we try\nto bracket meetings within a common four-hour period.\n\nThere are a lot of things you have to do like that to really think about the\nwork week and how you optimize it for people. There are different modes of\nwork. Face-to-face is one mode. It\u2019s good for certain things. There\u2019s Zoom \u2014\nyou can get a lot done on Zoom. Your memos or narratives are another mode of\nworking. Then, there\u2019s Slack and the whole communication mayhem \u2014 that\u2019s\nanother mode of working. They all have different strengths and weaknesses, so\nit\u2019s how you match the tasks to the right mode and design these things, and I\nguess the rabbit hole goes pretty deep on what you have to do to operate\neffectively in a distributed world.\n\nBut with that Virtual First decision, we framed the options in a document, and\nit was like, \u201cAlright, we could do this Virtual First thing. We could go back\nto the office. We could do the \u2018two, three days a week\u2019 thing.\u201d I mean,\nhonestly, the discussion took 10 or 15 minutes for probably the most\nconsequential decision that we\u2019ve ever made, that at least I could remember\nmaking in terms of its impact on people, the company\u2019s culture, and\neverybody\u2019s lives. But it was just very clear none of these other options are\ngoing to be tenable. Going back to the office isn\u2019t going to work. This \u201ctwo\ndays a week\u201d thing isn\u2019t going to work. So this is really the only thing\nthat\u2019s left.\n\nWe went for it and never looked back. I think we also got lucky. I mean,\nsometimes you make a big one-way door decision, and you go through the wrong\nway at the wrong door. But it\u2019s really worked for us. Our employee retention\nis way up. Engagement is way up. We don\u2019t have any problems with people\ncommuting. We can get great talent from anywhere, as I was saying. The\nflexibility is like a trump card. Our offer separates are way higher. There\nare a lot of other factors with the market and everything else, but it has\nbeen phenomenally successful for us.\n\nYou made a hard decision about almost a year ago. You were growing. You\u2019ve got\na lot of happy employees. You maybe grew too fast. You laid off about 500\npeople, 16 percent of the company, and you had this quote \u2014 and it will lead\nus into talking about AI. You said part of it is because the era of AI is\nhere. Explain the decision to cut down \u2014 because a lot of tech companies, in\nparticular, have been cutting down in a way that they haven\u2019t in a long time \u2014\nand explain why AI was a catalyst for it.\n\nFirst, it was horrible and not what any CEO, not what anyone wants. There were\na few factors. Investments that made sense at the time kept growing or\neventually got out of position with the returns we were going to see. And so,\neither we had built departments that were a little too big for what we needed\nor things like that. But I think something that really forced it was the shift\nto AI where it\u2019s like, yeah, we need to invest a lot more in things like\nDropbox Dash, and that means we need a lot more AI engineers and just people\nof a different mix.\n\nActually, that was the toughest part. We needed to hire new people, but we\ncouldn\u2019t fit it, and we couldn\u2019t make the math work with the way that we were\nstructured. So we had to make a really tough decision to let go of a lot of\npeople and then make room for the investments in AI and [Dropbox] Dash and all\nthe stuff that we wanted to ultimately make the company successful. But it\u2019s\nbrutal.\n\nThat restructuring, there\u2019s a bunch of stuff we\u2019re doing. We can see the\nfuture is coming. That\u2019s right after what you might call the ChatGPT moment.\nLight bulbs went off for everyone. Walk me through that part of the decision.\nYou\u2019re like, \u201cOh, this happened. We see what\u2019s coming. I\u2019ve got to flip the\ncompany.\u201d Is that a bunch of memos? Is that a long conversation?\n\nIt was one long memo that I wrote, and that was the end of a thought process.\nBut I feel lucky. I was born into the PC era. I was in middle school and high\nschool as the internet came along. Mobile and cloud made Dropbox possible\nbecause the second you have a smartphone is the first time you have this issue\nof having two devices like a laptop and a smartphone. How do you deal with\ndata? AWS launched the year before Dropbox was founded, so our board was right\nat the center of two massive waves. There are not a lot of good things about\ngetting older, but I\u2019m 41 now, so I remember when I was 24, I was starting the\ncompany and the title wave kind of feeling. And I\u2019m like, it\u2019s happening\nagain.\n\nIt\u2019s very obvious that things are different, and it\u2019s going to shake\neverything up, make some things a lot more challenging, and open up all kinds\nof new pathways for every company. Folks that adapt quickly become the new\nwinners in the new era. Dropbox, in a lot of ways, should never have existed\nif you think about it. We didn\u2019t own an operating system. We just had every\nweakness you could imagine, yet somehow, here we are. And those are the most\nconsequential periods in tech because every 10 years or so, the ground\nunfreezes, and big changes, big sweeping changes, are possible. And then,\nthings kind of hardened up again after a few years.\n\nAnd so, it was very clear both from my lived experience and then also that I\nlove studying the history of tech and business and all kinds of things. But it\nbrought back to mind things like Andy Grove\u2019s Only the Paranoid Survive\ntalking about how Intel navigated their transition. They started out as a\nmemory business, and then they found that there was a strategic inflection\npoint where the world had changed, and they basically had these competitors\nthat were faster, better, and cheaper than they were, putting them in a really\ntough spot. And so, they decided to move to microprocessors. Andy goes through\nthe whole story of that difficulty, that transition, which sort of sounds good\nin hindsight because you\u2019re like, yeah, they lived happily ever after. But\nthat\u2019s like Google getting out of search. Intel getting out of memory is like\nGoogle... just a crazy decision.\n\nSo this is something. In those periods, those strategic inflection points that\nAndy talks about are the most important moments for our industry and in a tech\ncompany\u2019s life. So, I had some experience going through that and having to\nsurf those kinds of waves. And so, it was very obvious after using ChatGPT,\nlike, whoa, okay, we\u2019ve uncorked machine intelligence. Let\u2019s go. And so, the\nmechanism I used was writing a 3,500-page memo talking about how we need to\nshift Dropbox to being an AI-first company. We need to launch Dash. ChatGPT\nand things like that are amazing, but there are a lot of questions it can\u2019t\nanswer, as I was saying, because it\u2019s not personalized to you. There\u2019s a big\nvoid that Dropbox can fill by building personalized AI. So we got after it\nsuper quickly. And then, one of the advantages of being founder and CEO and\ncontrolling shareholders, you can pivot the company pretty quickly, and that\nended up being really important.\n\nI hear the comparison to, \u201cThis is mobile and social all over again.\u201d Half of\nit, to me, feels like it\u2019s super real. You can see it. You can see a bunch of\nnew startups, companies, and ideas, and application models are moving from one\nplace to another. And then, part of me says, \u201cThis is wishful thinking, and\neveryone just wants to get away from mobile phones because they\u2019re controlled\nby two dominant players.\u201d And boy, it would be cool if we could do something\nother than exist at the whims of the two dominant players.\n\nWhat\u2019s that mix in your head? Is it 50-50? Is it 80-20?\n\nIt\u2019s all of the above. That\u2019s what makes these things so hard to navigate: AI\nwill be the best; AI will be the worst \u2014 just like the printing press did\ngreat things, but you can write really bad things as a result.\n\nI felt the same way about crypto. Everyone wanted it, and I was just like,\n\u201cThis is stupid.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t. I was a crypto bear.\n\nBut you don\u2019t feel that way about this?\n\nNo. To me, it\u2019s clear that AI will be bigger than any of the transitions of\nPC, cloud, mobile, or the internet. It\u2019s more in the fire or electricity or\nindustrial revolution-type category. But again, this is why it\u2019s really\nimportant for founders to study because when you\u2019re starting your first\ncompany, everything is new to you. You think everything\u2019s different, but then\nyou zoom out with a historical perspective. You\u2019re like, oh, wait, no, these\nare very obvious recurrent patterns, and there are life cycles of companies. I\nthink you can learn a lot about companies from studying how empires rise and\nfall. There\u2019s actually a lot of the same dynamics, like complacency,\nentitlement, lack of hustle.\n\nYou get very big, and then you do fail.\n\nAnd we were living that honestly. But coming back to AI, it is the real deal.\nWe now have a human brain and a silicon brain that are very complementary. All\nkinds of new opportunities for automation, all the benefits that we imagine\nare going to happen. And I think a lot of the challenges that we foresee or\nthat challenges we\u2019ve had in recent eras \u2014 making sure these technologies are\na force for good on balance \u2014 we\u2019re going to live that again. But you live\nthat with every technology like cars. Cars are great. They give all kinds of\nmobility. They also are one of the leading causes of death in the world. But\nit\u2019s an awkward navigation. But we\u2019re going to go through that process.\n\nThese previous transitions \u2014 cars: you could just go build a car, and many\ncompanies have tried, many companies have failed, but they could start and\nproduce a car. Mobile: you could just build an app; you could download Xcode;\nyou build an app; you can play it. But for AI, there are a whole bunch of\ndependencies where to start an AI company. You actually almost end up starting\nan OpenAI or Google or someone who owns the H100s in a data center or Azure or\nsomething. That dependency feels different if you\u2019re trying to compete with\nthe AI companies. I will get in trouble for saying this, but so many AI\nstartups are like ChatGPT wrappers.\n\nYeah, they are.\n\nYou have a dependency on some of these models. Do you think, okay, part of the\ncurve here is breaking away from those dependencies, or that will be the\ninfrastructure that everybody uses?\n\nI think this is also why it\u2019s super important for founders to understand\nbusiness, and a lot of the curriculum you learn in business school is actually\nvery relevant. I never went to business school, so I can\u2019t really speak to\nthat, but I think it\u2019s a huge question of: where is the value going to accrue?\n\nRight now, it\u2019s to Nvidia.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Because they have the scarce resource, and I think it\u2019s also\ngoing to accrue to the people who have the relationship with the customer. So,\nthe application part of the stack. And then\u2014\n\nWait, no \u2014 I think that\u2019s a good question for you. That feels less certain.\nIt\u2019s certain that a lot of the value will accrue to Nvidia. They make the chip\nthat\u2019s in hottest demand. The customer\u2019s paying money for the applications yet\nto be seen. I don\u2019t know that that is a definite in this whole mix.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting because you have sort of these simultaneous positive and\nnegative indicators. So ChatGPT speed ran from 0 to 100 million monthlies and\nprobably a billion in revenue faster than any product, probably faster than\nthe iPhone. And yet, it\u2019s also flattened out a little bit. And then, yes, the\namount of investment that has gone into AI versus the amount of incremental\nengagement or revenue is totally upside down. The way I think about that is, I\nmean, the internet is actually a pretty comparable thing, which is as soon as\nthe internet came along, people\u2019s imaginations went wild. Even though the\nfirst experience was very primitive \u2014 this was even before the web \u2014 it was\nlike maybe you could send an email. That in and of itself was pretty cool and\nuseful. I send a postcard around the world in 100 milliseconds \u2014 this is\nunbelievable.\n\nBut then, a lot of farsighted people were like, \u201cGuys, this is going to change\neverything. We\u2019re going to get all our news on our computer. We\u2019re going to be\nable to watch any movie or music ever created. We\u2019re going to be able to have\ngroceries delivered to our door.\u201d And then, all those things turned out to be\nright, but they happened a lot later \u2014 the time constants were wrong. So, I\nthink keeping that in mind is really important. And then, specifically along\nthe way to Spotify, there had to be a Napster and then Kazaa and Limewire and\nPandora, where you had some false starts as a lot of the other stuff got\nready. Netflix started out in DVD mailing because the broadband penetration\nand the enabling conditions and distribution weren\u2019t there yet. And so, they\nhad to wait for that to catch up.\n\nWith self-driving cars, a similar thing happened. After it sort of became\ngenerally agreed that self-driving was going to be a thing, people were like,\n\u201cOh my God, in 10 minutes, no one\u2019s going to ever drive a car again.\nEverybody\u2019s going to be out of work.\u201d And, to this day, the best self-driving\nthing most of us have used \u2014 very few of us got here in a self-driving car, or\nmaybe have even been in a self-driving car, but all of us have Google Maps.\nGoogle Maps has probably had a bigger impact on driving than self-driving cars\nbecause these things kind of follow. People think that Level 5 autonomy or a\nfully autonomous car is step one when it\u2019s actually step 100. Only 10, 12\nyears after all this is this even starting to become real.\n\nI think we\u2019re going to see the same dynamics with AI. There\u2019s this, again,\nthese MBA academic things. There are a lot of different frameworks out there\nwhere these hype cycles, that trough of disillusionment because we had this\nmeteoric explosion and high expectations since the starting gun went off of\nChatGPT, yet that hasn\u2019t really translated to a lot of new products or revenue\nother than ChatGPT. So, there\u2019s going to be this big crash of disappointment.\nYou\u2019re already seeing AI companies get off the rails and implode, but these\nare very familiar rhythms and patterns in these tech cycles. We\u2019re going to\nsee all of that.\n\nThere are some very familiar criticisms. Dropbox has even faced a few of them.\nI have a Dropbox account. I put my data into your system. I have some amount\nof trust that Dropbox isn\u2019t going to do anything with it. AI is all about\ntaking action on the data. So, Dash searches. I think you have some video\nediting features that are AI-powered. Those necessarily involve other people\u2019s\nmodels and data going in different places and being manipulated. That feels\nlike a big difference in kind, and I don\u2019t think the average consumer,\nparticularly enterprise user, has a lot of trust in those controls yet.\n\nThat\u2019s the first thing on everyone\u2019s mind, every customer\u2019s mind, on our mind.\nThere are enormous privacy, security, safety concerns with AI, and there are\nalso enormous privacy, security, and safety concerns as we move our stuff in\nthe cloud to begin with. And so, this was not a new phenomenon for us.\n\nBut I\u2019ll give you an example \u2014 I think this is a very funny story in its way.\nThe House of Representatives had to instruct its staffers this week not to use\nMicrosoft Copilot because Microsoft is just rolling it out in the Office\nsuites. They all use Microsoft. We\u2019re banning this tool that is very... it\nseems fun to use, but the work of the House of Representatives has security\nclearance issues.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s just very funny. Microsoft is like, \u201cHere\u2019s this tool.\u201d And then\nthe answer is you might be sharing classified information in a way that you\nshould not be sharing.\n\nTotally. And they probably were.\n\nAI can make bullet points out of it. That problem \u2014 it seems totally\nforeseeable but also impossible to foresee. How are you thinking about that?\n\nThe same way that we were thinking about moving people\u2019s stuff to the cloud to\nbegin with. It\u2019s super important to give people transparency and control and\nto really take ownership of the full stack and experience. This happens all\nthe time, too, as we move to sending our credit card number over the internet,\na lot of well-justified concern, and so we see the same thing happening with\nAI. So, transparency: How do these things actually work? Who\u2019s going to have\naccess to the data and then give people control? Do I want to disable this\nentirely? Do I want to allow only these AI providers? Do I not want any third-\nparty AI providers at all?\n\nSo, versus the opposite of, oh, it\u2019s very opaque, or companies don\u2019t give care\nto these issues or blow themselves up on pretty predictable obstacles. We have\na lot of experience. We\u2019ve only dealt in these kinds of existential concerns,\nso I think it\u2019s pretty familiar to us, but transparency, control, and then\neducating people on what\u2019s actually happening. And then, as far as the AI\nstacks themselves, there are a lot of options \u2014 you can use OpenAI or a lot of\npublic cloud options. There have been phenomenal advances in open models and\nopen source \u2014 like the Llama models for Meta \u2014 but the whole gap between the\nclosed-source and open-source models has been rapidly closing.\n\nI think it\u2019s OpenAI that you use right now. Would you transition to running\nsome of the open-source models?\n\nWe play with everything, and we\u2019ll give the customers a choice. So it\u2019ll be\n\u201cyes and.\u201d Because we partner with Open AI, and to be clear, we give our\ncustomers very explicit visibility and control. Whenever you use any kind of\nAI feature, we only use AI for that specific purpose. We have all these\nprotections around, and then extra agreements and things with AI providers\naround, like here are the rules of the road for how customer data is used. We\nlaunched Dropbox AI principles. We make a bunch of public commitments around\nhere\u2019s what we do and don\u2019t do. I think these are table stakes things that are\npretty important.\n\nDropbox has a big advantage because we have this whole technical\ninfrastructure. We operate one of the largest cloud infrastructures in the\nworld, cloud services in the world. We were the one car going in the other\ndirection almost 10 years ago, and we shifted from the public cloud to our own\nhosted infrastructure. The reasons we did that were to be able to have more\ncontrol. It is more cost-efficient. It\u2019s a lot more performance. And then,\nit\u2019s also very favorable as the AI world has come up because a lot of that\nstuff you do to build a giant hard drive for everyone is a lot of the same\nthings you do to index the known universe of content and apps and is a lot of\nthe same stuff you do to build AI.\n\nSo, large language models \u2014 like serving, fine-tuning, inference, and things\nlike that \u2014 can build on a very similar foundation to what we already have,\nwhich is another big advantage that Dropbox has when deploying it. So, yes,\nwe\u2019ll absolutely use open-source models, but there are a lot of benefits to\ndifferent closed-source models. Your customers may have lots of different\npreferences in terms of who they want to work with and how they want to handle\ntheir data. For us, it\u2019ll be a lot of following what customers want, again,\ngiving them transparency, control, and choice.\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you talked about sorting out people\u2019s\ntabs and helping them understand all the different containers on the internet.\nThat requires you to sit a different layer in the computing stack, maybe at\nthe browser layer, maybe somewhere else. Is that something you\u2019re actively\nthinking about?\n\nWell, we\u2019re in the browser in terms of an extension. Dash \u2014 just stepping back\na little bit of what Dropbox Dash is \u2014 gives you AI-powered universal search.\nSo, what does that mean? Well, you wire up all your apps. You connect to all\nthe things that you want to be searchable. It gives you one search box, and it\nwill search everything for you instead of having to go to every place\nmanually. Then also, we\u2019ll provide you universal answers. So, you can ask\nnatural language questions like ChatGPT, and it\u2019ll give you answers. But we\u2019re\nalso in the browser, so it\u2019s not just a search box. For customers that want\nit, we will give you a start page for work.\n\nWhen you hit a new tab at work in a normal browser, what does it show you? It\nshows you politics and news and sports and tweets, and when you\u2019re not in work\nmode, that might be what you want. But when you\u2019re working, you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m\ntrying to focus on something, and this is definitely not what I want to see,\nso why don\u2019t I have a smarter start page for work?\u201d That\u2019s what we do. We help\nyou. We\u2019ll give you an overview of your day. We\u2019ll help surface the stuff\nyou\u2019ve been working on a lot or that needs your attention and give you a\nbetter cockpit for work. We certainly have the technical capability to build a\nbrowser, but that\u2019s a big customer request.\n\nThere are companies chasing \u201cWhat does a reimagined browser for AI look like?\u201d\nAnd I\u2019m just listening to you describe the vision, and it\u2019s like, why would\nyou want to have some big dependency on Google or Microsoft or Apple to run\nyour extension when there\u2019s another thing there? It\u2019s really those\ndependencies that you\u2019ve been fighting against the whole time.\n\nTotally.\n\nYou have a dependency on macOS not blocking Chromebox, right?\n\nYeah. At the end of the day, every company\u2019s going to have dependencies.\nThere\u2019s not really an option to be fully self-contained. And at the end of the\nday, you share customers with these companies, and if you\u2019re building\nsomething that millions of people want and are happy with, then it\u2019s not in\nthe platform provider\u2019s interests. They can have sharp elbows. They can\ndisenfranchise you and cause a lot of problems for sure. But we\u2019ve always\ntried to have a collaborative relationship, and as long as you\u2019re providing\ncustomer value, then it\u2019s harder \u2014 not impossible \u2014 to do flagrantly\nanticompetitive things.\n\nDo you think the regulations we\u2019re seeing in Europe and some of the antitrust\nactions here will change your relationship with the big platform companies?\n\nI think we all want a level playing field. So, yes. A lot of their recent\nattention, I think, is good in terms of forcing some level of interoperability\nand giving customers choice. I think these are all good things, or I think\nit\u2019s a bad world if there are just a few platforms and they can control the\nentire experience and own distribution and provide their own first-party\nalternatives, privilege them, and tax their competitor. It\u2019s like, choose six\nof those things, not all 15. I think it will be a good tipping or bending\nthings back and do a spot that\u2019s better for innovation, for sure, because I\nthink it\u2019d be very hard to start the next Dropbox today, given the\nenvironment.\n\nI think that\u2019s very true, and I think that\u2019s honestly one of the reasons I\u2019m\npaying attention to both the platform shift to AI and the regulatory shift.\nBecause the opportunities to create new kinds of companies \u2014 it feels more\nopen than it has in a long time.\n\nMy wish list is still pretty long, but it\u2019s important that the next great set\nof startups can be created and it\u2019s not a great world if all the value of the\ninnovation is harvested by 50-year-old companies. I think that\u2019s not a great\nbalance.\n\nWell, that\u2019s a really great place to leave it. You\u2019ve given us more time than\nwe bargained for.
