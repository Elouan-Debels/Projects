Equipped with Nordic\nSemiconductor\u2019s nRF5340 SoC and multiple advanced sensors, this portable\ndevice is advertised for both personal health tracking and data logging for\nresearch applications.\n\nThe nRF5340 SoC powering the HealthyPi Move supports Bluetooth 5.4, high-speed\nSPI, QSPI, and USB, and can operate at up to 105\u00b0C. While the SoC is capable\nof running at either 128 or 64 MHz, the exact configuration for the HealthyPi\nMove is not specified on the product page. It includes 1 MB Flash, 512 KB RAM,\nand features FPU and DSP capabilities for enhanced performance.\n\n\u2014 ADVERTISEMENT \u2014\n\nThe network processor, optimized for low power usage, operates at 64 MHz with\n256 KB Flash and 64 KB RAM, ensuring operational efficiency.\n\nnRF5340 SoC block diagram (click image to enlarge)\n\nData storage ranges from 8 to 128 MB of NOR QSPI flash memory. The firmware\nwill be based on Zephyr RTOS, and there will also be an Android-compatible\nmobile app to enhance utility and accessibility.\n\nThe HealthyPi Move includes advanced sensors like the LSM6DSO for motion\ntracking, the MAX30001 for ECG, heart rate, and respiration monitoring, and\nthe MAX32664 sensor hub with the MAX30101 for precise pulse oximetry.\n\nHealthyPi Move components (click image to enlarge)\n\nAdditional monitoring capabilities include ECG, PPG for blood flow, SpO2,\nblood pressure, EDA/GSR for stress analysis, HRV, respiration rate, and body\ntemperature. The device also features an on-board real-time clock with battery\nbackup and a 3.7V 150 mAh LiPo battery with USB charging, ensuring reliable\noperation and easy maintenance.\n\nHealthyPi Move top view (click image to enlarge)\n\nThe product page indicates that both the hardware and software will be open-\nsource. Design files will be available in Autodesk Eagle and Fusion 360\nformats, and all associated software, including the mobile app developed in\nFlutter for cross-platform compatibility, will be accessible on GitHub.\n\nFurther Information\n\nProtoCentral, the team developing the HealthyPi Move, has not yet announced an\nestimated launch date or pricing information.
