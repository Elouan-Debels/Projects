In\nit we comment on unscientific and counter-productive norms in our field. We\nalso suggest constructive reforms. Since the chapter will be buried in a book,\nI\u2019m reprinting the best bit here on my blog. You can download a PDF of the\nwhole chapter.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to examine the general conditions and\ndevelopment of the field of human behavioral ecology. We do not focus on\nparticular papers. However, there are two papers which have been published\noften enough now that they deserve special consideration. These papers\ncontribute little to cumulative science but are difficult to eradicate.\n\nThe first paper is entitled something like \u201cSocial Networks, Reproductive\nSuccess, and the Evolution of Human Sociality.\u201d After an introduction that\npromotes the banal claim that social relationships and fertility may influence\none another, the number of self-reported friends is shown to be associated\nwith past fertility. The analysis adjusts for a basket of perfunctorily\nmeasured demographic variables, and every coefficient is interpreted as a\ntotal causal effect. The paper claims that this finding demonstrates the value\nof an evolutionary approach to human behavior, mainly because economists have\nignored it. But since no evolutionary model predicted the result, the size and\ndirection of the association have no impact on any evolutionary model. Any\nevolutionarily relevant variable like relatedness or age at first birth can be\ndeployed in this paper to imitate, but not actually to perform, behavioral\necology. The paper is highly cited.\n\nThe second appears under the banner \u201cThe Evolution of Human Cooperation: A\nBayesian Phylogenetic Analysis of Kinship and Pudding Recipes.\u201d A cross-\ncultural sample of stereotyped features of human societies is fed into\nsoftware designed for the analysis of biological species. The procedure\nidentifies an association between uxorilocal residence and the prominence of\ndessert. No model predicts this association nor its size. But rejecting a null\nmodel of no association somehow illustrates the value of an evolutionary\napproach. A few fatal confounds and methodological flaws flirt with the reader\nin the twilight paragraphs. The result has implications for the origins of\nhuman society and the possibility of world peace.\n\nWe have likewise written these papers, but we are trying to stop. If we could\nall avoid producing, reviewing, and reading these papers ever again, we would\ndivert a substantial amount of talent toward productive research.\n\nThe authors of these papers could make a contribution by instead advancing an\noptimization model that resembles the models that are described in other\nchapters. Then the model\u2019s predictions could be made algorithmically and\ncontrasted with similarly precise alternatives. Data collection and analytical\nprocedures could be designed that have some hope of causal identification. But\nat least the assumptions that justify a causal interpretation would be clear.\nMaking zombies does not train us to perform any of these tasks. Our students\nand their students deserve better.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n\nOccasional text on evolutionary anthropology, statistical inference, and the\nintersection of the two.\n\nRichard McElreath Department of Human Behavior, Ecology, and Culture at MPI-\nEVA\n\n\u00a9 2024 Elements of Evolutionary Anthropology \u2022 Crawford Theme\n\n", "frontpage": false}
