Three oil\nand natural gas platforms, called the Santa Ynez Unit, have not produced\nfossil fuels since one of the pipelines carrying its oil ruptured in 2015. It\nwas the biggest spill in California since 1990. After seven years, Exxon gave\nup trying to overcome the legal hurdles required to get Santa Ynez and the\npipeline back online. Now, despite facing similar obstacles, Sable is telling\nshareholders it can restart production before October. Since Hunterbrook Media\nbegan reporting, Sable withdrew and refiled a key plan, likely increasing the\nrisk of delays.\n\n## Editorial Position:\n\nHunterbrook Media\u2019s Editorial Board believes that Sable Offshore will not\nrestart production at Santa Ynez on time, if at all. Sable listed on NYSE via\nSPAC as $SOC earlier this year. The company\u2019s auditors have since flagged\nSable\u2019s ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d Our Editorial Board agrees.\n\nExxon \u2014 a more well-capitalized and experienced company \u2014 spent seven years\ntrying (and failing) to bring Santa Ynez back online. Sable\u2019s only apparent\nnovel approach seems to be an attempt to bypass Santa Barbara County, which\nwill likely only bring more scrutiny in California, a state not known as\nfossil fuel friendly.\n\nThe CEO\u2019s most recent prior company, Sable Permian Resources, went bankrupt.\nBefore that, he flamed out from Freeport-McMoRan. Now, he and his repeat\nmanagement team seem to be relying on a highly speculative gamble at the mercy\nof California regulators, litigators, and communities.\n\nDue to this editorial opinion and with compliance review, Hunterbrook Media\nprovided the article to its investment affiliate, Hunterbrook Capital.\n\nHunterbrook Capital went short $SOC. This is not investment advice. Positions\nmay change after publication. See full disclaimer below.\n\n## ***\n\n## Hunterbrook Media:\n\nOn May 19, 2015, oil flooded the Santa Barbara coast and spilled into the\nPacific Ocean. An old pipeline carrying crude from the Santa Ynez platforms\nhad ruptured, polluting 3,700 acres of beaches and fisheries. It was the\nlargest oil spill in California since 1990. The largest spill by volume in\ngallons. In 1990, an oil tanker punctured its hull, spilling more than 400,000\ngallons in the ocean. The Refugio Beach oil spill is the largest coastal spill\nsince 1969, also in Santa Barbara County; CA Refugio Beach Oil Spill Final\nDamage Assessment; Orange County Coastkeeper Coastal Spill History; AP, Judge\napproves $230M Settlement; NBC LA, The Huntington Beach Spill Isn\u2019t\nCalifornia\u2019s First Oil Disaster\n\nOn February 14, Sable Offshore Corp. acquired the platforms and pipeline from\nExxonMobil Corp. \u2014 after the oil giant\u2019s failed seven-year effort to restart\nthe project. SOC Feb 14, 2024 8k; US CDC Order re: XOM Emergency Permit;\nOffshore Mag, Exxon faces hurdles\n\nExxon abandoned its attempts to restart Santa Ynez earlier this year amid what\nit called \u201ccontinuing challenges in the state regulatory environment,\u201d leading\nthe company to revise down the value of Santa Ynez by $2.1 billion. XOM Jan 1,\n2024 Ex. 99.1 Earnings Considerations; XOM Feb 2, 2024 Earnings 8k Faced with\nthe same roadblocks, Sable now aims to bring Santa Ynez online by October,\njust eight months after acquiring the assets.\n\nThe approval process involves multiple government bodies that all have to sign\noff on different steps of the restart plan. Exxon failed in part because,\nalthough it successfully obtained approval for the main safety design from the\nCalifornia Fire Marshal, Santa Barbara County denied related permits to carry\nout that design.\n\nSable\u2019s strategy is to sidestep the county approval process by submitting a\nnew design to the California Fire Marshal (Cal Fire) that Sable argues won\u2019t\nrequire the County\u2019s approval, according to the company\u2019s security filings.\n\nThe County was not \u201cmade aware\u201d of the company\u2019s plan, the County said in\nresponse to Hunterbrook Media\u2019s questions, adding that Cal Fire would need to\napprove any new filing from Sable \u201cbefore seeking permits from the County.\u201d\n\nSable told investors the Cal Fire review of the new design had been underway\nsince December 2023 and slated for approval by April. Sable SEC Dec Prelim\nProxy materials; Sable Dec 2023 Slide Deck But on March 8, the company\nwithdrew the alternate plan, according to an email Cal Fire sent to\nHunterbrook Media. On April 12, Sable told shareholders that it filed a new\nplan with the agency that still aims to avoid County review.\n\nSable did not respond to Hunterbrook Media\u2019s inquiry on how it intends to\ncomply with state law without receiving the County approval that prior\noperators sought.\n\nEven if Sable wins Cal Fire\u2019s approval of its new permit, it still needs\nregulatory sign-off on at least four other authorizations before it can\nrestart its operations. That includes a separate approval from Santa Barbara\nCounty of the transfer of ownership from Exxon to Sable.\n\nThis figure represents the different permits necessary to restart the\npipeline. The bubbles in the center represent individual permits and\nauthorizations. The parenthetical text reflects the length of time it took for\nExxon to obtain the respective permit. Figure made using Canva.\n\nIf Sable doesn\u2019t restart production by January 1, 2026, the Santa Ynez assets\nwill revert back to Exxon \u201cwithout any compensation to [Sable],\u201d according to\nthe terms of the deal.\n\nSable is led by Chief Executive James Flores, an oil and gas veteran who has\nhad some struggles in the oil patch over the last decade.\n\nIn 2021, Flores formed a Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicle (SPAC) in pursuit\nof his next venture and quickly zeroed in on Exxon\u2019s Santa Ynez operations.\nWhen the deal closed with Exxon earlier this year, Sable Offshore debuted on\nthe New York Stock Exchange. The Santa Ynez complex is its only asset.\n\nSable did not acknowledge receipt of Hunterbrook Media\u2019s requests for comment.\nFlores could not be reached for comment. Exxon declined to comment.\n\n## The pipeline that covered Refugio State Beach with oil\n\nThe ruptured pipeline spilled more than 120,000 gallons of oil. The largest\nspill by volume in gallons. In 1990, an oil tanker punctured its hull,\nspilling more than 400,000 gallons in the ocean. The Refugio Beach oil spill\nis the largest coastal spill since 1969, also in Santa Barbara County.

Cal Fire also has the final sign-off for approving the\npipeline restart pursuant to the conditions the government imposed on the\npipeline in 2020.\n\nBefore granting its final approval for a restart, Cal Fire is to consider a\nnumber of permits including a \u201cRisk Assessment and Implementation Plan.\u201d For\nthe risk assessment, Cal Fire\u2019s task is to assess whether the best spill-\nprevention technology for the pipeline has been identified by the operator.\n\nIn 2022, Cal Fire approved Plains\u2019 Risk Assessment, requiring the pipeline\noperator to add 16 safety valves to reduce the volume of a \u201cworst case\u201d\nscenario spill by 48%, according to security filings and the Risk Assessment\ndocument Hunterbrook Media obtained. SOC Mar 28, 24 10K; 2021 Plains CBAT\nImplementation Plan\n\nTo move forward, however, the project also needed permission from Santa\nBarbara County to access the planned construction sites for the additional\nvalves. The County denied Exxon on the grounds that the risk of another oil\nspill was too high even with the additional measures, citing the age and\ncondition of the pipeline as a primary concern.\n\nAfter an appeal, the County board last August deadlocked with a 2-2 vote on a\nmotion to decide if it should revisit its denial. The Board has not considered\nthe issue since, and \u201cSable has taken no action\u201d to reinitiate its\nconsideration, according to the County\u2019s email to Hunterbrook Media.\n\nWhile Sable says it may resume those efforts, the company is betting it can\navoid the County altogether, seeking Cal Fire\u2019s approval for a different Risk\nAssessment plan that Sable says \u201cwill not require Santa Barbara County zoning\napproval,\u201d according to security filings.\n\nCal Fire would not provide a copy of the company\u2019s filing, reasoning that the\ninformation was exempt from an open-record request submitted by Hunterbrook\nMedia.\n\n## Novel attempt hits a snag\n\nSable had said it was expecting Cal Fire to promptly approve its pending\npermit. But on March 8, Sable withdrew the application, which was originally\nfiled by Exxon, according to the agency\u2019s response to Hunterbook Media. Cal\nFire said the law requires a new risk analysis be submitted when a company is\nsold.\n\nSable refiled its alternative plan on April 11 and maintains that the plan is\nstill designed to avoid county-level zoning review.\n\nIt took Cal Fire 14 months to consider and approve the previous Risk\nAssessment plan for the project. Cal Fire Acceptance of Initial CBAT Plan\u201d;\n2021 Plains CBAT Implementation Plan; SOC Mar 28, 24 10K pg. 5 (OSFM July 13,\n2022).\n\n## Sable\u2019s ambitious timeline\n\nEven if it bypasses the County\u2019s zoning board, Sable still needs Santa Barbara\nCounty to approve Exxon\u2019s transfer of ownership of the facilities to Sable.\nCal Fire Acceptance of Initial CBAT Plan\u201d; 2021 Plains CBAT Implementation\nPlan; SOC Mar 28, 24 10K pg. 5 (OSFM July 13, 2022).\n\nSable anticipated that its transfer conditions would \u201cbe fulfilled in whole or\nin large part by the same audit information provided\u201d during Exxon\u2019s purchase\nof the assets, according to security filings. FAC Feb 9, 2024 Schedule 14A,\npg. 257\n\nHunterbrook Media asked the County if its review of Sable will differ from its\nreview of Exxon. In an email, the County said, \u201cThe County Board of\nSupervisors will review Sable\u2019s current Change of Owner/Operator applications\non their merit, independent from its previous review of Exxon\u2019s applications.\u201d\n\nSanta Barbara County received Sable\u2019s filings related to the transfer of\nownership on March 25, according to the County\u2019s response to Hunterbrook\nMedia.\n\n\u201cThis transfer from Exxon to Sable is different from the Plains to Exxon\ntransfer,\u201d Linda Krop, the chief counsel at local advocacy group the\nEnvironmental Defense Center, who has long opposed the restart of the pipeline\nand Santa Ynez platforms and was on the beach following the spill to monitor\nabatement efforts, told Hunterbrook Media.\n\n\u201cWhen Exxon filed the transfer of ownership we did raise concerns but the\nCounty approved the transfer based on Exxon\u2019s financial resources, one of the\ncomponents the County reviews,\u201d Krop said. \u201cBut now that Exxon has sold to\nSable, our concerns are much more serious and exacerbated by the fact that\nSable wants to use the corroded, old pipeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cA new company who received most of its money from Exxon through a loan \u2014 it\nraises concerns about safety and the company\u2019s ability to respond to an\nincident,\u201d Krop said. \u201cWe will definitely be engaged in the County\u2019s\nconsideration of the transfer. At a minimum, we will ask the County to\nthoroughly explore Sable\u2019s financials and safety plans.\u201d\n\nSable also needs approval from the California Public Utilities Commission\u2019s\n(CPUC) rate-setting regime, where the agency determines what the company can\ncharge its pipeline customers. Sable says in its security filings that the\noutcome of these proceedings will determine whether they can \u201cearn an adequate\nrate of return in a timely manner or at all.\u201d\n\nThere is no set timeline to a CPUC rate-setting proceeding, according to the\nagency\u2019s website. Sable has yet to file an application or advice letter with\nthe CPUC to initiate its deliberation process, according to the agency\u2019s April\n9 response to Hunterbrook Media.\n\n## CEO Flores gambles on the scraps\n\nFlores became interested in Exxon\u2019s operations when he was operating four\noffshore platforms at Point Pedernales and Point Arguello up the coast from\nSanta Ynez in the early 2000s, according to Sable\u2019s security filings. FAC Feb\n9, 2024 Schedule 14A, pg. 174.\n\nAt the time, he was running Plains Exploration & Production Co. and Plains\nResources Inc., upstream affiliates of Plains All American, the company\nresponsible for the 2015 pipeline spill.
