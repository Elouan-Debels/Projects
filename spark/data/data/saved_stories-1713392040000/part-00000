That comic strip\u2019s cultural impact\nis even more remarkable considering that it ran in newspapers for only a\ndecade, from 1985 to 1995: barely an existence at all, by the standards of the\nAmerican funny pages, where the likes of Garfield has been lazily cracking\nwise for 45 years now. Yet these two examples of the comic-strip form could\nhardly be more different from each other in not just their duration, but also\nhow they manifest in the world. While Garfield has long been a marketing\njuggernaut, Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson has famously turned down\nall licensing inquiries.\n\nThat choice set him apart from the other successful cartoonists of his time,\nnot least Charles Schulz, whose work on Peanuts had inspired him to start\ndrawing comics in the first place. Calvin and Hobbes may not have its own toys\nand lunchboxes, but it does reflect a Schulzian degree of thoughtfulness and\npersonal dedication to the work. Like Schulz, Watterson eschewed delegation,\ncreating the strip entirely by himself from beginning to end. Not only did he\nexecute every brushstroke (not a metaphor, since he actually used a brush for\nmore precise line control), every theme discussed and experienced by the\ntitular six-year-old boy and his tiger best friend was rooted in his own\nthoughts.\n\n\u201cOne of the beauties of a comic strip is that people\u2019s expectations are nil,\u201d\nWatterson said in an interview in the twenty-tens. \u201cIf you draw anything more\nsubtle than a pie in the face, you\u2019re considered a philosopher.\u201d However\nmodest the medium, he spent the whole run of Calvin and Hobbes trying to\nelevate it, verbally but even more so visually. Or perhaps the word is re-\nelevate, given how his increasingly ambitious Sunday-strip layouts evoked\nearly-twentieth-century newspaper fixtures like Little Nemo and Krazy Kat,\nwhich sprawled lavishly across entire pages. Even if there could be no\nreturning to the bygone golden age of the comic strip, he could at least draw\ninspiration from its glories.\n\nIronically, from the perspective of the twenty-twenties, Watterson\u2019s work\nlooks like an artifact of a bygone golden age itself. In the eighties and\nnineties, when even small-town newspapers could still command a robust\nreadership, the comics section had a certain cultural weight; Watterson has\nspoken of the cartoonist\u2019s practically unmatched ability to influence the\nthoughts of readers on a daily basis. In my case, the influence ran especially\ndeep, since I became a Calvin and Hobbes-loving millennial avant la lettre\nwhile first learning to read through the Sunday funnies. It took no time at\nall to master Garfield, but when I started getting Calvin and Hobbes, I knew I\nwas making progress; even when I didn\u2019t understand the words, I could still\nmarvel at the sheer exuberance and detail of the art.\n\nCalvin and Hobbes also attracted enthusiasts of other generations, not least\namong other cartoonists. Joel Allen Schroeder\u2019s documentary Dear Mr. Watterson\nfeatures more than a few of them expressing their admiration for how he raised\nthe bar, as well as for how his work continues to enrapture young readers. Its\ntimelessness owes in part to its lack of topical references (in contrast to,\nsay, Doonesbury, which I remember always being the most formidable challenge\nin my days of incomplete literacy), but also to its understanding of childhood\nitself. Like Stephen King, a creator with whom he otherwise has little in\ncommon, Watterson remembers the exotic, often bizarre textures reality can\ntake on for the very young.\n\nHe also remembers that childhood is not, as J. M. Coetzee once put it, \u201ca time\nof innocent joy, to be spent in the meadows amid buttercups and bunny-rabbits\nor at the hearthside absorbed in a storybook,\u201d but in large part \u201ca time of\ngritting the teeth and enduring.\u201d Being six years old has its pleasures, to be\nsure, but it also comes with strong doses of tedium, powerlessness, and\nfutility, which we tend not to acknowledge as adults. Calvin and Hobbes showed\nme, as it\u2019s shown so many young readers, that there\u2019s a way out: not through\nstudiousness, not through politeness, and certainly not through following the\nrules, but through the power of the imagination to re-enchant daily life. If\nit gets you sent to your room once in a while, that\u2019s a small price to pay.\n\nRelated content:\n\nHow to Make Comics: A Four-Part Series from the Museum of Modern Art\n\nGeorge Herriman\u2019s Krazy Kat, Praised as the Greatest Comic Strip of All Time,\nGets Digitized as Early Installments Enter the Public Domain\n\n17 Minutes of Charles Schulz Drawing Peanuts\n\nThe Disney Artist Who Developed Donald Duck & Remained Anonymous for Years,\nDespite Being \u201cthe Most Popular and Widely Read Artist-Writer in the World\u201d\n\nThe Comiclopedia: An Online Archive of 14,000 Comic Artists, From Stan Lee and\nJack Kirby, to M\u0153bius and Herg\u00e9\n\nBased in Seoul, Colin Marshall writes and broadcasts on cities, language, and\nculture.

From the moment I first caught the strip\nin the newspaper early 1986, I was hooked. Very rarely did I read strips that\nactually made me laugh out loud. Of course that led to collecting the books as\nthey came available, and now after 30+ years, I have all of them. I still\nenjoy reading through them from time to time. I had the pleasure of attending\nthe \u201cExploring Calvin and Hobbes\u201d exhibition when it was in Columbus Ohio\nyears ago and it did not disappoint. (I later purchased that book as well.) I\nhave always admired Mr. Watterson for ending the strip on a high point rather\nthan milk it until it lost its shine. Yes I would love more, but that\u2019s what\nmakes this strip so magical even today. Thank you Mr. Watterson. You still\nremind us what it\u2019s like to be young, have an imagination, and enjoy every day\nof adventure. Even someone like me in my 60s. May you all stay young at heart\nfolks!\n\nReply\n\n  * Dave Koschnick says:\n\nApril 15, 2024 at 1:01 pm\n\nI\u2019m of the boomer generation and read \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d as an adult. I\nalways felt it was written more for adults than kids and find it interesting\nthat kids would get so attached to it. I guess that shows how universal the\nthemes were.\n\nReply\n\n  * Brent says:\n\nApril 15, 2024 at 6:20 pm\n\nThe reason C&H is still beloved is that Waterson knew when to exit still\nleaving people wanting more. The strips you mentioned running really long\n*suck* because they\u2019re old and boring.\n\nReply\n\n  * Steve says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 6:21 am\n\nI think you mean Generation X, not Millennials. 1985\u20131995 is right when 80\u2019s\nHair Metal segued into Grunge.\n\nReply\n\n  * Chris Polliwoods says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 8:02 am\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I thought Schulz DID pass off the later Peanuts\ncomics to assistants. Or was the drop off in quality due to his own declining\ntalents?\n\nReply\n\n  * Pat Gray says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 8:26 am\n\nMy husband and I, our children, and now our grandchildren all love Calvin and\nHobbes. We give the books as gifts to friends and family. My children grew up\nlearning to read with C&H comics. I was helped by C&H strips to parent one of\nmy sons. He was hard to appreciate because of his eccentricities. When I got\nto know and laugh at Calvin, I got to know my own son! Thank you, Mr.\nWatterson. We still miss you!\n\nReply\n\n  * Eric Hamilton says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 9:56 am\n\nI don\u2019t know what I would have done without Calvin and Hobbes. Growing up in\nthe 80\u2019s I spent hours with Calvin and Hobbes...and even when I was not with\nthem in a strip, they were with me helping me to develop and sharpen my own\nimagination and sense of adventure and curiosity. Even today, many years\nlater, I still sometimes take breaks from life and go on an adventure with\nCalvin and Hobbes through one of the books or strips that I keep.\n\nEven though deep down I wish that we had more than a decade, I do appreciate\ngoing out with the audience wanting more...and it led me to create various\nadventures with them in my own mind. What a gift we have been given and we\ntreasure to this day.\n\nReply\n\n  * Jessica J says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:05 am\n\nI think there\u2019s some crossover... the strip started when Millennials were just\nbeing born, so obviously they weren\u2019t reading it then... but as they entered\nelementary school, the comic was still running, and so I think most\nMillennials had at least some exposure. There\u2019s also the \u201cborder\u201d groups such\nas myself (I prefer the term \u201cXennial\u201d because I\u2019m definitely younger than\nmost of gen X to where people want to lump me in with Millennials, yet for the\nmost part more strongly identify with X than Millennials, who were still\n\u201ckids\u201d as I was entering the workforce). We were starting to look forward to\nthe Sunday funnies just as C&H was hitting its stride, and I have (or at least\nhad \ud83d\ude22) all the C&H collection books; at least one of them has still managed to\nsurvive several moves, and resides on my shelf to this day.\n\nReply\n\n  * Vincent Saunders says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:14 am\n\nThe ingenuity of imagination. That was the genius of Calvin and Hobbs. Mr.\nWatterson portrayed Calvin as an extension of his grandest day dreams. Whether\nas Spaceman Spiff, in verbal combat with Suzie, the animation of snowmen,\nflying down the Hill with Hobbes on his toboggan or wagon or outwitting his\nparents in kid fashion, every single strip was about his super imagination\nthat coped with life no matter how it came. Sure the topics were often\n\u201cadultrified\u201d for the age of the main readers but everyone of us identified\nwith Calvin and his triangular, gleeful smile and his smart-aleck buddy\nHobbes. I have his books and no matter when I look at them, I am transported\nback in time to the good times (and sometimes the bad times) of my youth. The\nsimple times worth remembering. God Bless you Bill Watterson. Laughter truly\nis the best medicine!\n\nReply\n\n  * floydburney says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 10:18 am\n\n.... Calvin & Hobs wasn\u2019t anywhere near as good as \u201cBloom County\u201d That was the\ngreatest strip since Doonsberry.\n\nReply\n\n  * Davide says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 3:15 pm\n\nNot at all. Not even close. And it\u2019s Calvin and Hobbes.\n\nReply\n\n  * Bobby says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 3:24 pm\n\nI have no idea how 10 years is considered \u201cshort lived\u201d.\n\nReply\n\n  * Kunle Busari -Adamasingba says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 4:09 pm\n\nMy friend Like Martin was a Nigeria/ Canada half cast, our love of reading\nmakes us great friends.

Loved the comic yet\nserious nature of the strip. Many years ago my wife bought me a 3 volume set\nof the complete strip. I break it out a couple times a year and still enjoy\nevery single strip.\n\nReply\n\n  * ZankFrappa says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 11:18 pm\n\nIt\u2019s funny how millenials are fast approaching their 50s, and still haven\u2019t\nfigured out the pop culture they passively leeched off of as children and\nteens actually belongs to Gen X and Baby Boomers.\n\nReply\n\n  * Spiffman says:\n\nApril 17, 2024 at 6:18 am\n\nI think it\u2019s telling that one would say millenials leeched off things not\nbelonging to them, especially when the media itself was developed during their\nlifetime and served as a greater foundation for their lived experience than\nthe past generations due to their earlier life exposure.\n\nWhatever is created during their childhood is almost always created by older\npeople, but that doesn\u2019t mean the experiences belong to those that created it.\n\nAll generations that were around enjoyed and grew from it, albeit in different\nways. It\u2019s a shared experience that does not belong to one group of\ngenerational cohorts.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso to be pedantic, it\u2019s generation X that is reaching their 50s still.\nMillenials still have a few years and are mostly in the mid 40s to mid/late\n30s.\n\nReply\n\n  * JRD says:\n\nApril 17, 2024 at 7:27 am\n\nAs an avid newspaper reader during the 80s I was lucky to experience Calvin\nand Hobbes daily. That along with Gary Larson\u2019s The Far Side and Berkeley\nBreathed\u2019s Bloom County certainly gave us a golden age of comics during this\nera. Comics strips have never been this good since. It was a treat when Bill\nWatterson did a few guest drawings for Pearls Before Swine back in 2014. He is\nsorely missed.\n\nReply\n\n  * BA says:\n\nApril 17, 2024 at 9:05 am\n\nThank you.
