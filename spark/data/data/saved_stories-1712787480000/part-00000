So it is game-changing for our users to instantly move\ndollars in their bank to crypto in their MetaMask wallet.\n\n### Lorenzo Santos\n\nProduct Manager, Flash\n\n1\n\n2\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Is Nexa accurate?\n\nNexa is shockingly good for most use cases we support, and like a human\nanalyst, does better with more context. That said, it will make some mistakes,\nso please always check the accuracy of responses.\n\n### What can Nexa do?\n\nNexa can write SQL, create tables and charts, and is great at brainstorming.\nIt can also help you identify bad data and suggest improvements (however, it\ncan't clean the data, yet).\n\n### Is Nexa secure?\n\nNexa has read-only access to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database and CSVs are\nstored securely in DigitalOcean.\n\nWe use GPT4 under the hood, so per their guidelines, your data is never used\nto train public models. That said, we do ask OpenAI to process your data to\nrespond to each question.\n\nAll remaining infrastructure is on GCP and our SOC 2 Type 2 is pending with\nThoropass.\n\n### What datasources do you support?\n\nWe currently support PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, and CSV uploads.\n\nWe plan to add many more datasources once we're out of beta. If you have an\nurgent need for a specific datasource, please email us at founders@nexahq.com\n\n### How does pricing work?\n\nNexa is free for the first 14 days (includes 50 AI prompts). After that,\npricing starts at $85/month for 150 prompts/month and scales based on usage.\n\nAll tiers include unlimited users and dashboards.\n\n### I'm a SQL wizard. Why do I need Nexa?\n\nWe've found that some our most technical users get the most value. Here's one\nearly testimonial:\n\n\"It took my 2 hours of work down to 10 minutes. I'm good with SQL and didn't\nneed it for that, but within 1 minute of connecting my data, it figured out\nthe meaning of fields without me giving any context. I asked \"what are the\nbest possible insights\" and could create a 4 page document just by using the\ninsights it gave me.\"\n\n### I'm an Excel ninja. Why do I need Nexa?\n\nWe love Excel too (Zain, our CEO, used to teach Excel and advanced Excel).\n\nBut, a simple \"can you create a histogram?\" is 5-12x faster, 10-20x less work,\nand infinitely more enjoyable (and less error-prone) than writing nested IF\nstatements, COUNTIFS, and manually creating and formatting charts.\n\nWe know you're probably still skeptical. Just try it out. It might change your\nlife ;-)\n\n### How is Nexa better than ChatGPT?\n\nChatGPT is a great all-in-one platform, while Nexa is the best analytics\nplatform for your business.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT, Nexa connects to your database, so responses are tailored. It\nalso gets smarter as you feed it more context.\n\nAlso, to make your workflow more efficient, Nexa has a built-in Notion-like\ndashboard, where you can add tables and charts with one click and share with\nstakeholders instantly.\n\nWe're going far beyond the traditional chat interface in ChatGPT (and other\ncompetitors).\n\n# Blog\n\n## Meet Nexa, your AI business analyst\n\nNexa handles your boring, manual and error-prone work, reducing time spent on\nanalysis and reporting by 5-12x.\n\nLearn More\n\n## The end of Excel for analysis\n\nExcel is one of the most powerful tools ever built. But, could AI be the\nbeginning of the end for Excel?\n\nLearn More\n\n## Data to insights 5-12x faster\n\nNo more chasing busy engineers for data queries or wasting hours manually\nanalyzing data in sheets.\n\nStart for free\n\nfounders@nexahq.com\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
