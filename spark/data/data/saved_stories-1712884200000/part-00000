He filmed them as they moved almost\nsilently through the brush, as they waded across the Rio Grande, as Border\nPatrol agents chased them down a dirt road.\n\nThen he turned the camera on himself.

(Obtained with permission by The Washington Post)\n\nAntonio guided his first group of undocumented migrants into the United States\nwhen he was 12. He\u2019s 17 now, and one of the most prolific juvenile smugglers\nalong a section of the border that\u2019s full of them.\n\nHe\u2019s notorious among the Border Patrol agents of Brownsville, Tex., who keep a\nlist of the 10 most successful juvenile smugglers on the wall of their office.\nSome have been caught more than a hundred times. Antonio, always cautious, is\nup to 15.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cHe knew what he was doing,\u201d said one senior Border Patrol agent based in\nBrownsville. \u201cHis goal was to win.\u201d\n\nSince last October, U.S. immigration agents have made more than 1.5 million\nmigrant apprehensions along the country\u2019s southern border, the most in more\nthan two decades. The Biden administration has pledged to dismantle the\nnetworks that transport migrants, which are often described as sophisticated\ntransnational syndicates.\n\nBut the smugglers at the heart of one of the world\u2019s largest human migrations\n\u2014 including the current surge of children and families \u2014 are often children\nthemselves.\n\nThey are boys who grew up on the southern banks of the Rio Grande. They earn\nabout $100 for each migrant they get across. For many, it\u2019s a part-time job, a\nhole in the border economy that they can fill. Some have become famous for\ntheir smuggling feats. They are the subjects of rap songs. Images of their\nexploits have been shared widely on social media.\n\nVideo shows teen smugglers rushing a group of migrants into a van after\ncrossing a river on their journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Obtained with\npermission by The Washington Post)\n\nTheir success is made possible by a quirk in the U.S. immigration system.\nAntonio and the other juvenile smugglers mostly don\u2019t have to worry about\ngetting caught.\n\nIt\u2019s a long-standing practice: The U.S. Justice Department doesn\u2019t prosecute\nMexican minors for smuggling migrants. When the boys are apprehended, they\u2019re\nput in white Border Patrol vans and expelled to northern Mexico, where they\nare free to escort more migrants across the border \u2014 sometimes within hours.\n\nThat makes them valuable tools for the criminal groups that control the trade.\nA policy meant to protect the boys has instead made them targets for cartel\nrecruitment.\n\n\u201cNi\u00f1os de circuito,\u201d they\u2019re called here: children of the circuit.\n\nThe work comes with an expiration date. When the boys turn 18, they\u2019re no\nlonger insulated from prosecution. If they\u2019re caught ferrying migrants across\nthe border as adults, they can be sent to a U.S. prison for a decade.\n\nA minor who in the past has crossed immigrants to the United States poses for\na portrait in Matamoros, Mexico, on April 22. (C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez for The\nWashington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s when the cartels steer them toward a new role. As the boys approach\ntheir 18th birthdays, the groups recruit them for more dangerous work \u2014 as\ndrug traffickers, for example, or hit men.\n\nThere have been months when Antonio smuggled migrants to Texas almost every\nday. He has memorized the curves in the Rio Grande: the way it narrows near\nMonsees Road, the dense brush around Browne Park, how you can cross the river\nby leaping between rocks at Las Rusias.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe can get over the border wall in less than a minute. He has learned to use\nGoogle Maps to navigate his way between Border Patrol checkpoints. On\nFacebook, he changed his profession to \u201csmuggler.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, it was like a game. You feel the adrenaline rush,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou jump over the wall. You run away from the agents. You hide. And at the\nend of it all, you get paid.\u201d\n\nAntonio turns 18 in February.\n\nHe sees two options.\n\nThere\u2019s the first: He has already been pressured by the Gulf Cartel to move\nfrom \u201ccrossing people,\u201d as he calls it, to a riskier role. Cartel members have\nloaned Antonio an assault rifle. They\u2019ve asked him to start moving drugs.\n\nAnd the second: The local government, recognizing the number of local children\ndrawn into smuggling, has launched a program to extricate them from the\nbusiness. It offers sessions with a psychologist, a path to a high school\ndiploma and jobs to replace part of their smuggling income.\n\nThe government has even created a soccer team for the kid smugglers, their\nnames printed on the back of the uniforms.\n\nSoon Antonio will have to choose.\n\nVideo: Antonio, who lists his profession as \u201csmuggler\u201d on Facebook, leads a\ngroup of migrants through the Rio Grande to get to the U.S. border.

(Sergio Flores for The Washington Post)\n\n### Recruited after class\n\nAntonio was drawn into smuggling the same way as most of the boys in\nMatamoros.\n\nHe was walking home from sixth grade one afternoon, wearing his school uniform\nand toting an oversized backpack, when an older boy approached.\n\n\u201cHe asked if I was interested in crossing people for money,\u201d he said. \u201cI was\ninnocent at the time. I didn\u2019t even know what they were talking about.\u201d\n\nAntonio, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition that he would be\nidentified only by his middle name out of concern for his safety, was\nstruggling in school. His mom was raising him alone in the city\u2019s red-light\ndistrict. He slept on a bare mattress in the kitchen, under a poster of \u201cThe\nLast Supper.\u201d Some months, they couldn\u2019t pay the bills. His father, a veteran\nof the Mexican Marines, was rarely around; when he did appear, Antonio says,\nhe was brutally strict.\n\nFor as long as Antonio could remember, migrants passed through Matamoros,\nsometimes within sight of his apartment, on their way to Texas. He often\ndreamed of joining them, and leaving this city forever.\n\nHis first time guiding a group, he was so nervous he could barely breathe. It\nwas dark along the Rio Grande. He didn\u2019t know how to swim. He managed to wade\nacross the river and immediately got lost. Almost by chance, he wandered into\nthe white truck that was waiting to whisk them away.\n\n[Mexico has pushed hundreds of migrants expelled from the U.S. on to\nGuatemala, stranding them in a remote village far from their homes]\n\nCenter: The Rio Grande is seen from the international bridge in Brownsville,\nTex.

(Obtained with permission by The\nWashington Post)\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, I wasn\u2019t that good,\u201d he said, and laughed.\n\nBut within months, the job started to feel easier. He learned to sweep away\nhis footprints so he was harder to track. He memorized the locations of stash\nhouses on the northern bank of the river. His bosses called or texted him when\nthey had an assignment. Sometimes the messages were just two words: \u201cLet\u2019s\ngo.\u201d\n\nHe learned to dash back to Mexico if the Border Patrol arrived. He got cocky.\nHe smoked a blunt of marijuana while crossing the river. He chronicled\neverything on Snapchat.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSometimes he stayed for a few days in Texas. He hit the beach on South Padre\nIsland. He met a girl with pretty brown eyes, a U.S. citizen who was working\non the Texas side of the smuggling operation.\n\nHe lost track of how much money he made. \u201cIt flew out of my hands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe bought a closet full of new Nike shoes. He bought a car. He bought Ziploc\nbags of methamphetamines. He gave his mother and his girlfriend gifts and\npiles of cash.\n\n\u201cHe would disappear for weeks at a time,\u201d his mom said. \u201cBut when he came\nback, he always had something for me.\u201d\n\nAntonio honed a pep talk for the migrants. Sometimes they were kids his own\nage from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Sometimes they were adult men,\nwho looked at their guide in disbelief, the final leg of their long journeys\nnow in the hands of a child.\n\n\"They have the technology,\u201d he would tell the migrants, channeling Al Pacino\u2019s\ncharacter in Scarface, his favorite movie, trying to sound commanding. \u201cBut\nwe\u2019re smarter, we\u2019re faster, we\u2019re stronger.\u201d\n\nThen he delivered his instructions for getting over the border wall: \u201cHold\ntight to the tubes and push your feet out to the sides and climb.\u201d\n\nThe Border Patrol has grown used to catching the same boys over and over.\nSome, like Antonio, have become legends among the agents. One teenager in El\nPaso had a case file more than a foot long, a senior Border Patrol agent\nrecalled. When he turned 18, agents in the sector celebrated.\n\nA Border Patrol agent searches for undocumented migrants suspected of hiding\nunder a house in Brownsville, Tex., on June 3. (Sergio Flores for The\nWashington Post)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any sport or anything. You have a kid that\u2019s really good at what he\ndoes,\u201d said the agent in Brownsville, who spoke on the condition of anonymity\nbecause he was discussing minors. \u201cVery careful with the way he comes across,\nwhat he\u2019s looking at. He knows when to move, when not to move. He knows the\ncorrect route.\u201d\n\nAntonio became so confident in his skills as a smuggler \u2014 and so certain of\nhis impunity \u2014 that he began to mock the agents.\n\n\u201cHe was one of those kids who was like, \u2018Hey, I got you three days ago,\u2019\u201d the\nagent said. \u201cIt was kind of funny but annoying.\u201d\n\nBecause the Justice Department chooses not to prosecute the boys, the Border\nPatrol has few options. Sometimes the agency hires dentists to examine the\nboys\u2019 teeth to assess whether they are in fact under 18, and not lying about\ntheir age.\n\n[On the U.S.-Mexico border, President Biden faces a political crisis. Migrants\nface a fight to survive.]\n\nA few years ago, agents tried to detain the kids for months without trial as a\ndeterrent, but the approach drew concern from human rights advocates and\nlawyers. Sometimes they return the boys to different border towns, far from\ntheir homes, controlled by rival drug cartels \u2014 another improvised deterrent\nthat advocates say puts the children at risk.\n\nBut mostly the agents believe their only tool is persuasion.\n\n\u201cKind of like a teacher, you\u2019re hoping when you talk to these kids and tell\nthem, \u2018Hey man, next time this can happen. You can end up drowning. Something\nbad can happen,\u2019\u201d the agent said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re hoping that it sinks in for one\nof them.\u201d\n\n### A revolving door\n\nWhen Ivette Hern\u00e1ndez Cavazos met Antonio, he had just been caught by Border\nPatrol agents for the 11th time.\n\nHe swaggered into the shelter at the Center for Attention to Border Minors, a\nsquare, one-story building in Matamoros a few blocks south of the Rio Grande\nwhere the juvenile smugglers are deposited by Mexican immigration officers\nafter being handed over by U.S. agents.\n\nHe was a skinny 15-year-old, wearing an oversized T-shirt and a long gold\nchain. Tattoos lined his arm. He used slang to describe the migrants, calling\nthem chivos, or goats.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut the facade crumbled quickly. He called his mother on the office telephone,\nspeaking meekly into the receiver. He asked if he could take a nap.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez , a 35-year-old former Mexican immigration official, had taken a job\nat the shelter a few weeks earlier. She was a petite woman, born and raised\nless than a mile from the border, with a curly ponytail. She typed Antonio\u2019s\nname into a database and stared at the list of his apprehensions.\n\nStudents take a high school entrance exam in Matamoros on April 22. Some youth\nwho struggle in school end up falling into work as human smugglers. (C\u00e9sar\nRodr\u00edguez for The Washington Post)\n\nAlmost every day she saw boys dropped off by Mexican authorities. Usually,\nthey were still wearing the clothes they had on when they crossed the river.\nSometimes they lost their shoes in the mud; they returned in Border Patrol\nflip-flops.\n\n\u201cHow many migrants did you cross this time?\u201d she asked each boy. Then she\nwaited for their parents to pick them up, as if they had been suspended from\nschool. Sometimes their mothers arrived in shiny new SUVs. Sometimes it was\nmembers of the cartel who came for the boys.\n\nAlmost always, the teenagers would reappear days or weeks later, and the cycle\nrepeated itself.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez watched as some of the boys became involved in more serious crimes.\nSome trafficked drugs. Some started carrying weapons. Some took supervisory\nroles directing newer, younger smugglers. Local officials mostly watched\nwithout intervening, as if observing a natural phenomenon.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t offering them anything. It was a revolving door,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said.\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t reach them, organized crime would.\u201d\n\nLast year, with a local government grant, she started a program called \u201cMy\nFeet Above Our Roots,\u201d based at the center. She reserved a soccer field for\nthe boys and recruited a coach with a degree in psychology.\n\nTo some of her colleagues, it sounded absurd.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018You\u2019re going to form a soccer team of child smugglers?\u2019\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nIt would be a way to keep tabs on the kids, she explained, so they didn\u2019t\nspiral deeper into the cartel. Since 2015, government data shows, at least\n6,714 Mexican minors have been killed in acts of violence as cartels have\nincreasingly recruited juveniles. On the border, careers in organized crime\noften begin with smuggling.\n\nOne study from the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas, based on interviews\nwith 107 human smugglers, found that almost 80 percent knew colleagues who had\nbeen recruited by cartels to traffic arms or drugs, or do other work like\noperating as hitmen or kidnappers.\n\nThe ni\u00f1os de circuito already had links to the cartel. In Matamoros, it\u2019s\nnearly impossible for smugglers or migrants to cross the border without paying\nthe Gulf Cartel, described by the Justice Department as \u201cone of the most\nviolent and brutal drug trafficking organizations in the world.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez thought about Antonio. Could she convince him?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the hardest one,\u201d she said.\n\nCenter: A group of teens plays video games in Matamoros.

(Obtained with permission by The Washington Post)\n\nOn Facebook, he had begun posting photos of the Santa Muerte, the Saint of\nDeath worshiped by many Mexican criminals. He made references to his\nallegiance to the Gulf Cartel. He posted a photo of the prescription drugs he\nhad begun taking recreationally and another of himself holding an assault\nrifle.\n\nBy then, the city was at the center of a surge in migration. March was the\nbusiest month along the U.S.-Mexico border in almost two decades. More than\n172,000 migrants were taken into U.S. custody.\n\nAntonio\u2019s phone lit up with calls and Facebook messages.\n\n\u201cDo you want to cross some people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got eight if you\u2019re available.\u201d\n\nEven Antonio\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend, who worked for years as a cook at a\nMacaroni Grill in North Carolina before being deported, asked Antonio to get\nhim across.\n\nIn March, Hern\u00e1ndez persuaded Antonio to show up at a counseling session at\nthe shelter\u2019s cafeteria.\n\nHe sat there, his head resting on his hands, as the other kids described their\ndescent into smuggling, the power they derived from it. When it was his turn\nto talk, he wouldn\u2019t say how many times he had crossed the river, or how much\nhe was paid \u2014 ordinarily his favorite subjects. He talked only about his\nmother.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHern\u00e1ndez, on the other side of the table, counted Antonio\u2019s new tattoos and\nthought about all the ways boys try to disguise themselves as men.\n\nA few months later came the first soccer practice at a municipal park, and\nthere was Antonio. The boys\u2019 names were printed on the back of their uniforms.\nAntonio wore number 10.\n\nAt practice, the boys urged each other on. Run like you\u2019re fleeing the Border\nPatrol, they yelled. Jump like you\u2019re scaling the wall.\n\nBut as the team got closer to their first game, Antonio stopped showing up.\n\nWhat happened? Hern\u00e1ndez asked the other boys.\n\nNo one seemed to know.\n\n### \u2018I\u2019m trying to find you\u2019\n\nSo Hern\u00e1ndez went looking for him. She borrowed her parents\u2019 red Toyota and\ndrove through the neighborhoods tucked behind the vast industrial corridor\nthat had consumed Matamoros in the decades since NAFTA.\n\nIvette Hern\u00e1ndez Cavazos, who started a program to extricate teenage smugglers\nfrom the cartels, searches for Antonio in Matamoros. (Kevin Sieff/The\nWashington Post)\n\nThere was one of the world\u2019s largest windshield wiper factories; a plant that\nmade steering wheels; another that made gas masks. Jobs there pay a dollar an\nhour. If the kids weren\u2019t smuggling migrants, sometimes earning $1,000 a day,\nHern\u00e1ndez thought, that\u2019s where they would work.\n\nThe city had reorganized itself so that cartel violence, mass migration and\ntransnational commerce all coexist. Growing up in Matamoros often necessitates\na familiarity with all three.\n\n[A motorcycle-riding lawyer searches Guatemala\u2019s remotest corners to reunite\nfamilies separated by the U.S.]\n\nEach neighborhood seemed a little worse than the previous one, until Hern\u00e1ndez\npulled up in front of Antonio\u2019s cinder block apartment. The wire gate was\nlocked.\n\n\u201cIt looks abandoned,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. She peered through the wire gate. When\nAntonio didn\u2019t answer the door, she called his cellphone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to find you. Where are you?\u201d she said.\n\nHe directed her a few blocks away. When she pulled up, Antonio leaned through\nthe window of her car.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she asked, exasperated. \u201cThey caught me,\u201d he said, his\neyes tearing up. \u201cThey arrested my girl.\u201d\n\nWhile the soccer team had been practicing, he had gone back across the border.\nHe met his girlfriend in Brownsville.\n\nThey had opened their own stash house, and were splitting the rent. The\noperation seemed to be working. More than a dozen migrants at a time slept on\nthe floor. Antonio was climbing the ladder of the smuggling business. He felt\nuntouchable. He changed his profession on Facebook; now it said: \u201cWorks at\nUnited States Border Patrol.\u201d\n\nIt was a strange kind of domestic bliss. Then, one morning, the door burst\nopen. A whole team unit of uniformed men were suddenly in the living room,\nshouting. They pointed guns at Antonio. Within seconds, handcuffs were on his\nwrists.\n\nHis girlfriend, 18, was arrested. Antonio, being a minor, was sent back to\nMexico.\n\n\u201cMy little skinny girl,\u201d he said to Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez looked at him, unsure of what to say. Before she could answer, he\npleaded:\n\n\u201cListen, I need help. I need money.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez looked around. A few feet away, a man watched them, a cellphone in\nhis hand. She wondered if he was eavesdropping. Hern\u00e1ndez was growing nervous.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\n### Newest team in the league\n\nA few days later came the first soccer game of the season.\n\nIt was raining hard. Nine boys had shown up. Antonio wasn\u2019t among them.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez, on the sidelines in her raincoat, kept a lookout for him.\n\nAnother boy, Alexander, began a short speech.\n\nHe knew Antonio, too. They had smuggled migrants together. Alexander had\npleaded with Antonio to stop \u2014 using his own life as an example.\n\nA shoe left behind by a migrant sits in tall, thick grass in a field outside\nBrownsville, Tex., on June 3.

(Sergio Flores for The Washington\nPost)\n\nAlexander was 18 now. He had a 6-month-old son and a serious girlfriend. He\nhad landed a job at the edge of the city as a car mechanic. He had gravitated\nto the program and the soccer team the way he once had to smuggling.\n\n\u201cThese kind of activities motivate us to work for our own good, and the good\nof our families,\u201d he told the small crowd.\n\nThe whistle blew.\n\nThe boys were playing against a team of women, the Warriors, many of them\nfactory workers. It wasn\u2019t until the women arrived that they learned that they\nwould be playing against a team of child smugglers.\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d one asked.\n\nFor days, the boys had traded jokes about how much stronger and faster they\nwould be. But by halftime, the boys were down 4 to 1. Their bravado had faded.\nWet and shivering in the rain, they looked once again like children.\n\n\u201cYou need to focus,\u201d the boys\u2019 coach told them.\n\nThirty minutes later, it was over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get them next time,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez got in her car to leave. She tallied her list of the boys who\nattended, checking off their names.\n\nShe got to Antonio\u2019s name and passed over it.\n\n### A kidnapping\n\nA few days later, Antonio appeared again. This time he was stumbling up to\nAlexander\u2019s house, covered in blood, vomiting.\n\nAntonio explained what happened. He had received a call from a man he had met\nas a smuggler, who was now working more closely for the cartel. Would Antonio\nbe willing to kill a man for cash?\n\nHe didn\u2019t have to think about it. He was driven in a pickup truck nearly two\nhours to the farm town of San Fernando \u2014 territory of the Zetas, a Gulf Cartel\nrival. One of his bosses told him the target.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe fired his gun, he says, but missed. His friend was shot in the shoulder.\nThey retreated back to Matamoros.\n\nNot long after he returned, Gulf Cartel members broke into his mother\u2019s\napartment in the middle of the night and carried him out. His mother looked\non, horrified.\n\n\u201cThey told me, \u2018You\u2019re never going to see your son again,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI just\nstood here and cried.\u201d\n\nThe cartel held Antonio for three days. They handcuffed him so tightly that\nthe skin around his wrists was worn bare. They broke a table over his knee and\npunched him repeatedly in the face.\n\nWas the cartel exacting revenge because the operation had failed? It was\nunclear.
