We\u2019ve been amazed by\nwhat the community has been able to debug, create and learn using our\ngroundbreaking 1 million context window.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making Gemini 1.5 Pro available in 180+ countries via the Gemini\nAPI in public preview, with a first-ever native audio (speech) understanding\ncapability and a new File API to make it easy to handle files. We\u2019re also\nlaunching new features like system instructions and JSON mode to give\ndevelopers more control over the model\u2019s output. Lastly, we\u2019re releasing our\nnext generation text embedding model that outperforms comparable models. Go to\nGoogle AI Studio to create or access your API key, and start building.\n\n## Unlock new use cases with audio and video modalities\n\nWe\u2019re expanding the input modalities for Gemini 1.5 Pro to include audio\n(speech) understanding in both the Gemini API and Google AI Studio.\nAdditionally, Gemini 1.5 Pro is now able to reason across both image (frames)\nand audio (speech) for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio, and we look\nforward to adding API support for this soon.\n\nYou can upload a recording of a lecture, like this 117,000+ token lecture from\nJeff Dean, and Gemini 1.5 Pro can turn it into a quiz with an answer key.\n[Video sped up for demo purposes]  \n---  \n  \n## Gemini API Improvements\n\nToday, we\u2019re addressing a number of top developer requests:\n\n> 1\\. System instructions: Guide the model\u2019s responses with system\n> instructions, now available in Google AI Studio and the Gemini API. Define\n> roles, formats, goals, and rules to steer the model's behavior for your\n> specific use case.\n>\n> Set System Instructions easily in Google AI Studio  \n> ---  \n>  \n> 2\\. JSON mode: Instruct the model to only output JSON objects. This mode\n> enables structured data extraction from text or images. You can get started\n> with cURL, and Python SDK support is coming soon.\n>\n> 3\\. Improvements to function calling: You can now select modes to limit the\n> model\u2019s outputs, improving reliability. Choose text, function call, or just\n> the function itself.\n\n## A new embedding model with improved performance\n\nStarting today, developers will be able to access our next generation text\nembedding model via the Gemini API. The new model, text-embedding-004, (text-\nembedding-preview-0409 in Vertex AI), achieves a stronger retrieval\nperformance and outperforms existing models with comparable dimensions, on the\nMTEB benchmarks.\n\n'Text-embedding-004' (aka Gecko) using 256 dims output outperforms all larger\n768 dim output models on MTEB benchmarks  \n---  \n  \nThese are just the first of many improvements coming to the Gemini API and\nGoogle AI Studio in the next few weeks. We\u2019re continuing to work on making\nGoogle AI Studio and the Gemini API the easiest way to build with Gemini. Get\nstarted today in Google AI Studio with Gemini 1.5 Pro, explore code examples\nand quickstarts in our new Gemini API Cookbook, and join our community channel\non Discord.\n\nAI Announcements Explore Gemini GenerativeAI Google Cloud Next '24\n\nNext post Previous post\n\nDiese Website verwendet Cookies von Google, um Dienste anzubieten und Zugriffe\nzu analysieren.
