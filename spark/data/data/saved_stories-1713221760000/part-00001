The electric vehicle automaker had\nbeen riding high, with quarter after quarter of successive growth and plenty\nof profits in the process. But lately, that success has mostly been due to a\nseries of price cuts meant to tempt customers to buy into an aging lineup.\nThis March, the company reported its first quarterly decline since 2020.\n\nNow, it plans to lay off more than 10 percent of its workforce, according to\nan internal memo seen by Reuters.\n\n\"As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely\nimportant to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and\nincreasing productivity,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk told employees in the memo.\n\nMusk has pursued a strategy of relentless cost-cutting, but all those price\ncuts have meant Tesla's once-envied profit margins are now nothing special.\n\n\"As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization\nand made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10\n[percent] globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This\nwill enable us to be lean, innovative, and hungry for the next growth phase,\"\nMusk wrote.\n\nTesla's limited aging product portfolio is starting to become a problem in the\nface of stiff competition in China. Its newest vehicle is the Cybertruck, a\nlarge and controversial pickup with limited appeal outside of North America's\nwide roads and parking spaces. And plans for a cheap two-seat Model 2 have\nbeen axed in favor of a robotaxi.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n146\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
