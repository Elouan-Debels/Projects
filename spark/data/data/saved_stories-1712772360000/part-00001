A juvenile clown fish, specifically, in the year\n2100. You live near a coral reef. You are orange and white, which doesn\u2019t\nreally matter. What matters is that you have these little ear stones called\notoliths in your inner ear, and when sound waves pass through the water and\nthen through your body, these otoliths move and displace tiny hair cells,\nwhich trigger electrochemical signals in your auditory nerve. Nemo, you are\nhearing.\n\nBut you are not hearing well. In this version of century\u2019s end, humankind has\nmanaged to pump the climate brakes a smidge, but it has not reversed the\ntrends that were apparent a hundred years earlier. In this 2100, atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide levels have risen from 400 parts per million at the turn of the\nmillennium to 600 parts per million \u2014 a middle\u2010of\u2010the-road forecast. For you\nand your otoliths, this increase in carbon dioxide is significant, because\nyour ear stones are made of calcium carbonate, a carbon-based salt, and ocean\nacidification makes them grow larger. Your ear stones are big and clunky, and\nthe clicks and chirps of resident crustaceans and all the larger reef fish\nhave gone all screwy. Normally, you would avoid these noises, because they\nsuggest predatory danger. Instead, you swim toward them, as a person wearing\nheadphones might walk into an intersection, oblivious to the honking truck\nwith the faulty brakes. Nobody will make a movie about your life, Nemo,\nbecause nobody will find you.\n\nAuthor Clayton Page Aldern. Bonnie Cutts / Dutton\n\nIt\u2019s not a toy example. In 2011, an international team of researchers led by\nHong Young Yan at the Academia Sinica, in Taiwan, simulated these kinds of\nfuture acidic conditions in seawater tanks. A previous study had found that\nocean acidification could compromise young fishes\u2019 abilities to distinguish\nbetween odors of friends and foes, leaving them attracted to smells they\u2019d\nusually avoid. At the highest levels of acidification, the fish failed to\nrespond to olfactory signals at all. Hong and his colleagues suspected the\nsame phenomenon might apply to fish ears. Rearing dozens of clown fish in\ntanks of varying carbon dioxide concentrations, the researchers tested their\nhypothesis by placing waterproof speakers in the water, playing recordings\nfrom predator-rich reefs, and assessing whether the fish avoided the source of\nthe sounds. In all but the present-day control conditions, the fish failed to\nswim away. It was like they couldn\u2019t hear the danger.\n\nIn Hong\u2019s study, though, it\u2019s not exactly clear if the whole story is a story\nof otolith inflation. Other experiments had indeed found that high ocean\nacidity could spur growth in fish ear stones, but Hong and his colleagues\nhadn\u2019t actually noticed any in theirs. Besides, marine biologists who later\nmathematically modeled the effects of oversize otoliths concluded that bigger\nstones would likely increase the sensitivity of fish ears \u2014 which, who knows,\n\u201ccould prove to be beneficial or detrimental, depending on how a fish\nperceives this increased sensitivity.\u201d The ability to attune to distant sounds\ncould be useful for navigation. On the other hand, maybe ear stones would just\npick up more background noise from the sea, and the din of this marine\ncocktail party would drown out useful vibrations. The researchers didn\u2019t know.\n\nThe uncertainty with the otoliths led Hong and his colleagues to conclude that\nperhaps the carbon dioxide was doing something else \u2014 something more sinister\nin its subtlety. Perhaps, instead, the gas was directly interfering with the\nfishes\u2019 nervous systems: Perhaps the trouble with their hearing wasn\u2019t\nexclusively a problem of sensory organs, but rather a manifestation of\nsomething more fundamental. Perhaps the fish brains couldn\u2019t process the\nauditory signals they were receiving from their inner ears.\n\nThe following year, a colleague of Hong\u2019s, one Philip Munday at James Cook\nUniversity in Queensland, Australia, appeared to confirm this suspicion. His\ntheory had the look of a hijacking.\n\nA neuron is like a house: insulated, occasionally permeable, maybe a little\nleaky. Just as one might open a window during a stuffy party to let in a bit\nof cool air, brain cells take advantage of physical differences across their\nwalls in order to keep the neural conversation flowing. In the case of nervous\nsystems, the differentials don\u2019t come with respect to temperature, though;\nthey\u2019re electrical. Within living bodies float various ions \u2014 potassium,\nsodium, chloride, and the like \u2014 and because they\u2019ve gained or lost an\nelectron here or there, they\u2019re all electrically charged. The relative balance\nof these atoms inside and outside a given neuron induces a voltage difference\nacross the cell\u2019s membrane: Compared to the outside, the inside of most\nneurons is more negatively charged. But a brain cell\u2019s walls have windows too,\nand when you open them, ions can flow through, spurring electrical changes.\n\nIn practice, a neuron\u2019s windows are proteins spanning their membranes. Like a\nhouse\u2019s, they come in a cornucopia of shapes and sizes, and while you can\u2019t\nfit a couch through a porthole, a window is still a window when it comes to\nthose physical differentials. If it\u2019s hot inside and cold outside, opening one\nwill always cool you down.\n\nUntil it doesn\u2019t.\n\nA school of manini fish pass over a coral reef at Hanauma Bay in Honolulu.\nDonald Miralle / Getty Images\n\nHere is the clown fish neural hijacking proposed by Philip Munday. What he and\nhis colleagues hypothesized was that excess carbon dioxide in seawater leads\nto an irregular accumulation of bicarbonate molecules inside fish neurons. The\nproblem for neuronal signaling is that this bicarbonate also carries an\nelectrical charge, and too much of it inside the cells ultimately causes a\nreversal of the normal electrical conditions. At the neural house party, now\nit\u2019s colder inside than out. When you open the windows \u2014 the ion channels \u2014\natoms flow in the opposite direction.\n\nMunday\u2019s theory applied to a particular type of ion channel: one responsible\nfor inhibiting neural activity. One of the things all nervous systems do is\nbalance excitation and inhibition. Too much of the former and you get\nsomething like a seizure; too much of the latter and you get something like a\ncoma \u2014 it\u2019s in the balance we find the richness of experience. But with a\nreversal of electrical conditions, Munday\u2019s inhibitory channels become\nexcitatory. And then? All bets are off. For a brain, it would be like pressing\na bunch of random buttons in a cockpit and hoping the plane stays in the air.\nIn clown fish, if Munday is right, the acidic seawater appears to short-\ncircuit the fishes\u2019 sense of smell and hearing, and they swim toward peril. It\nis difficult to ignore the question of what the rest of us might be swimming\ntoward.\n\nFrom THE WEIGHT OF NATURE: How a Changing Climate Changes Our Brains by\nClayton Page Aldern, to be published on April 9, 2024, by Dutton, an imprint\nof Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by Clayton Page Aldern.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
