Is the climate system broken? We don't really\nunderstand yet why we have this additional heat in 23/24. We can explain most\nof it, but not all of it,\" Burgess said.\n\nWhat had transpired was \"within the envelope\" of scientific forecasts \"but it\nwas the very outer edge of the envelope, rather than the mean or the median\nwhere you'd expect it to fall\", she added.\n\n## Up and up\n\nHumanity, meanwhile, continues to pump ever-more planet-heating emissions into\nthe atmosphere even as scientists say they need to fall by almost half this\ndecade to keep the Paris goals within reach.\n\nLevels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide \u2013 the three main human-\ncaused greenhouse gases \u2013 rose for another year in 2023, scientists from the\nUS-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Friday.\n\n\"Until we get to net zero, we will continue to see temperatures rise,\" Burgess\nsaid.\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse\n\nTrending News\n\nFasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brain Health2\ndays ago\n\nThe Polar Vortex Has Shifted Into Reverse \u2013 And Is Now Spinning Backwards\nEnvironment5 days ago\n\nScientists Accidentally Made a Mouse Grow Legs in Place of Genitals Health3\ndays ago\n\n", "frontpage": true}
