The company leveraged Instagram's existing monolithic\narchitecture and quickly iterated to create a new text-first microblogging\nservice in record time.\n\nSoon after Elon Musk acquired Twitter, Meta saw an opportunity to create a\ncompeting service but had little time to launch it to attract existing Twitter\nusers, who were looking for alternatives. The company initially tested whether\nbetter support for text-based posts on Instagram would be sufficient to sway\nsome Twitter users over to Meta's products, but these efforts didn\u2019t attract\nenough new users.\n\nMeta formed a small team to devise an approach to delivering a new service\nthat would directly compete with Twitter in just a few months. Zahan Malkani,\na software engineer at Meta, shared how his team was able to reuse the\nexisting Instagram backend components, data stores, and large parts of the\nexisting infrastructure stack but customize them to offer functionality\ncomparable to what now is X.\n\nInstagram / Threads High-Level Architecture (Source: Daniel Bryant\u2019s LinkedIn\npost)\n\nTheads's technology stack is almost identical to Instagram's, consisting of a\nfew monolithic application components and dedicated data stores. The main\nbackend component is a large Python codebase using a custom version of the\nDjango Framework, named Distillery, that integrates with an older PHP\ncomponent called WWW. The data is stored in TAO, a write-though cache that\noperates on a graph data model, which in turn uses UDB, a sharded MySQL\ndeployment, that stores all the data. Additionally, the ZippyDB key-value\ncache stores transient data, and Async, a serverless function compute\nplatform, is used to execute asynchronous jobs outside of peak hours.\n\nWhile working on Threads, the team used a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) approach to\nenable a quick experimentation cycle in the early days of the project, using\nthousands of company employees for feedback.\n\nDespite the apparent advantages of reusing Instagram's platform for Threads\n(much faster delivery time), Malkani admitted the company introduced a\nsubstantial amount of technical debt that must be addressed in the future. The\nteam is working on gradually separating the data models from Instagram's as\nthe Threads service gains new functionality so that both platforms can be\nseparated, but the process will take some time.\n\nMalkani recounted the stressful period when Threads launched in July 2023,\nincluding a few mishaps, like when users in Southeast Asia and other time\nzones were able to download the mobile app before the US team was ready to\nallow traffic in, due to the time zone confusion. Engineers also had to\nimprove scalability of some processes to allow for importing followers from\nInstagram. The team has been working tirelessly to address any issues and\nensure the stability of the platform, which saw unprecedented adoption. Ten\nmillion users downloaded the app on the first day, and 100 million in the\nfirst five days.\n\nSince the launch, the team delivered new features like the \"following\" feed,\ntrending conversations, and the limited availability of API access for reading\nand writing posts. Threads team is also actively working on adopting the\nActivityPub protocol, allowing users to share their posts to other social\nnetworks that support the protocol.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Rafal Gancarz\n\nRafal is an experienced technology leader and expert.
