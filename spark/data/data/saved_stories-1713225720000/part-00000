It can ruin lives. Even with the best treatments\navailable, symptoms and suffering often continue. An article that two\ncolleagues and I just published April 6, 2019 in the medical journal\nSchizophrenia Research describes two patients with longstanding schizophrenia\nwho experienced complete remission of symptoms with the ketogenic diet, a\nwell-established, evidence-based treatment for epilepsy. Of particular\ninterest in our research, both patients were able to stop antipsychotic\nmedications and have remained in remission for years now. Though more evidence\nis certainly needed, this is extraordinarily hopeful news for those with this\ndisorder and for the mental health professionals treating them.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\n## The Psychotic Disorder Challenge\n\nSchizophrenia affects 1 percent of the population. Its close cousin, bipolar\ndisorder, affects 2 to 5 percent of the population. Tens of millions of people\nsuffer. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought\nand speech patterns. Hallucinations are when people see things or hear things\nthat aren\u2019t there, while delusions are thoughts that aren\u2019t true, such as\nparanoid beliefs. Many people describe these psychotic symptoms as \u201cbeing out\nof touch with reality.\u201d People diagnosed with schizophrenia may also ignore\nhygiene, avoid being around people, and lack motivation. The illness affects\nmost areas of life and can severely impair people at school, work, and in\nrelationships.\n\nPrevailing treatments revolve around antipsychotic medications. As useful as\nthese are for some, unfortunately, they can yield poor results for others. A\nthree-year study that tracked over 6,000 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia\nshows just how poor. All patients were treated at academic medical centers and\nwere taking antipsychotic medications. The study tracked three metrics:\nsymptom relief, quality of life, and ability to function in society. Only 4\npercent of those patients achieved full relief from the illness on all three\nmeasures. Clearly, we need new treatment ideas for schizophrenia.\n\n## What Causes Schizophrenia?\n\nNo one knows for sure what causes schizophrenia. Most clinicians and\nresearchers think it involves a chemical imbalance. This refers to\nneurotransmitters in the brain\u2014chemicals that send messages from one brain\ncell to another. This theory has largely focused on excess activity of a\nneurotransmitter called dopamine\u2014primarily because all antipsychotic\nmedications block dopamine receptors. While there is a lot of evidence to\nsupport the dopamine theory, many current treatments designed around it have\ncome up short. The treatments appear to only affect some of the symptoms, not\nall of them, and don\u2019t change the course of the illness itself.\n\nOther researchers think of schizophrenia as a neurodegenerative disorder.\nThere is evidence that the brains of people with schizophrenia are different\nthan other people\u2019s brains, and can change over time. Some of the changes\nobserved include shrinking of some brain regions, and changes in the\nconnections between different brain regions.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nHowever, emerging evidence suggests that something else might be behind\nschizophrenia. Attention has turned to bioenergetics, or energy production in\nthe brain cells. It is well known that people with schizophrenia are three\ntimes more likely to develop diabetes. A common debate in the field is whether\nthe antipsychotic medications, which are known to cause weight gain and\ndiabetes, are to blame. Recent research suggests that this is not the entire\nexplanation. Even people newly diagnosed with schizophrenia appear to already\nhave insulin resistance, even though most don\u2019t yet have diabetes. This means\nthat their brains may not be getting enough energy from glucose. Other brain\nstudies have found metabolic abnormalities, such as higher levels of oxidative\nstress and inflammation as well.\n\n## Why Would the Ketogenic Diet Help?\n\nThe medical version of the ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate,\nmoderate-protein diet proven to work for epilepsy. In my article The Ketogenic\nDiet May Help Stop Seizures, I explain the history and research demonstrating\nthat the ketogenic diet is a powerful intervention in treating epilepsy. While\nreferred to as a \u201cdiet,\u201d make no mistake: this is a powerful medical\nintervention. Studies show that over 50 percent of children with epilepsy who\ndo not respond to medications experience significant reductions in the\nfrequency and severity of their seizures, with some becoming completely\nseizure-free.\n\nUsing epilepsy treatments in psychiatry is nothing new. Anticonvulsant\nmedications are often used to treat psychiatric disorders. Depakote, Lamictal,\nTegretol, Neurontin, Topamax, and all of the benzodiazepines (medications like\nValium and Ativan, commonly prescribed for anxiety) are all examples of\nanticonvulsant medications routinely prescribed in the treatment of\npsychiatric disorders. Therefore, it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that a proven\nanticonvulsant dietary intervention might also help some people with\npsychiatric symptoms.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nInterestingly, the effects of this diet on the brain have been studied for\ndecades because neurologists have been trying to figure out how it works in\nepilepsy. This diet is known to produce ketones which are used as a fuel\nsource in place of glucose. This may help to provide fuel to insulin resistant\nbrain cells. This diet is also known to affect a number of neurotransmitters\nand ion channels in the brain, improve metabolism, and decrease inflammation.\nSo there is existing science to support why this diet might help\nschizophrenia.\n\nKetogenic Diet Essential Reads\n\nNew Study: Serious Mental Illness Improves on Ketogenic Diet\n\nThe Benefits and Risks of a Ketogenic Diet\n\n## But Does It Work?\n\nAn 82-year-old woman with chronic paranoid schizophrenia since age 17\n\nThe first patient documented in the Schizophrenia Research article is a woman\nwho spent nearly her whole life suffering chronic, treatment-resistant\nschizophrenia. For more than 50 years, she endured paranoia, disorganized\nspeech, visual and auditory hallucinations. By the time she was 70, she was\nsuicidal and had been hospitalized repeatedly for psychosis or suicide\nattempts. She had been treated with over ten different antipsychotic and mood\nstabilizing medications, including regular antipsychotic injections. None of\nthem helped her symptoms. She was unable to care for herself and had a court-\nappointed guardian and home health services.\n\nAt the age of 70, weighing 330 pounds, she went to a medical weight loss\nclinic and was started on a ketogenic diet. Within two weeks of starting the\ndiet, she reported a noticeable reduction not only in her weight but also her\npsychotic symptoms. Within several months, she started to feel so much better\nthat she was able to stop taking her psychiatric medications while remaining\non the diet. Over time, her mood stabilized, and her hallucinations and\nparanoia remitted completely. She was no longer suicidal. Her case was first\nreported in 2009.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nToday, 12 years later, she has lost a total of 150 pounds and remains on the\nketogenic diet. She takes no medications and remains symptom-free. She was\nable to regain her independence, no longer requiring the guardian and the home\nhealth care team. When I recently spoke with her, she recalled her decades of\nsuffering and hopelessness, and said that since starting the diet, she has had\na \"new life,\" and is happy to be alive.\n\nA 39-year-old woman with schizophrenia for 20 years\n\nThe second patient described in the article is a 39-year-old woman who\nsuffered from depression, anxiety, anorexia nervosa, hallucinations and\nparanoia since her teens. As patients sometimes do, she concealed her\npsychotic symptoms when she was initially treated for depression and anorexia.\nWhen she finally reported her psychotic symptoms later in her twenties, she\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia. For the next ten years, she was treated with\n7 different antipsychotic medications\u2014including clozapine (called the \u201cgold\nstandard antipsychotic medication\u201d)\u2014along with antidepressants and anti-\nanxiety medications. Nevertheless, she continued to have symptoms.\n\nShe was having chronic gastrointestinal problems, so she saw a doctor who\nrecommended the ketogenic diet. Noticing some improvement of her symptoms and\nbeing frustrated with all of her psychiatric medications, she unwisely stopped\ntaking all 14 of her medications \u201ccold turkey.\u201d This sent her into severe\npsychosis requiring an extended hospitalization. In the hospital, she was re-\nmedicated with Haldol-decanoate (an injectable medication which had not worked\nfor her previously) and she continued the ketogenic diet. Within a month on\nboth Haldol and the ketogenic diet, she reported complete remission of her\npsychotic symptoms for the first time since she was 14. Over the following\nyear, she slowly tapered off Haldol, and remained free of psychotic symptoms.\nOf note, she lost 70 pounds from the diet, which exacerbated her anorexia. She\nhas since regained 30 of those pounds and maintains a healthy weight today.\nFive years after starting the ketogenic diet, she is off all antipsychotic\nmedications, remains on the diet, and is free of all psychotic symptoms. She\nhas also finished graduate school and now works full time.\n\n## More Evidence of the Ketogenic Diet for Schizophrenia\n\nWhile inspiring, these two case reports aren't the first of their kind. They\njoin a growing body of evidence supporting the use of the ketogenic diet in\nthe treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nSchizophrenia in 1965\n\nIn 1965, ten women hospitalized with schizophrenia who were already receiving\nmedications and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT or \u201cshock therapy\u201d) were also\nplaced on the ketogenic diet for a month. The researchers reported that their\nsymptoms improved after two weeks on the diet, but then returned back to their\nbaseline level of symptoms after the diet was stopped.\n\nSchizoaffective disorder in 2017\n\nIn 2017, I reported two other cases of schizoaffective disorder improving\nsignificantly on the ketogenic diet. Schizoaffective disorder is a diagnosis\nthat includes both a mix of schizophrenia and a mood disorder, often bipolar\ndisorder. One man and one woman, both in their 30\u2019s, had suffered treatment-\nresistant schizoaffective disorder for years. On the diet, their symptoms were\ngreatly improved, and they both lost significant amounts of weight. Off the\ndiet, their symptoms returned.\n\nSchizophrenia in Ecuador\n\nIn 2018, two Ecuadorian twins, one male and one female, diagnosed with\nschizophrenia since the ages of 14 and 18 were started on a 6-week trial of\nthe ketogenic diet. This study had a psychiatrist rate each twin\u2019s symptoms\nwhile being unaware of their diet status. Interestingly, only when the\npatients were compliant with the diet did their symptoms improve. They also\nboth lost weight. When they stopped the diet at the end of the study, their\nsymptoms returned to their baseline level.\n\nSchizophrenia in mice\n\nIn 2015, researchers conducted a study of the effects of the ketogenic diet in\na mouse model of schizophrenia. Studies exactly like this are used in the\ndevelopment of new antipsychotic medications. The ketogenic diet was found to\nnormalize the mouse behaviors associated with schizophrenia, indicating an\nantipsychotic effect.\n\nIn 2018, the same researchers published another study of the ketogenic diet\nnormalizing impaired prepulse inhibition in mice\u2014yet another marker commonly\nassociated with schizophrenia. The mice on the ketogenic diet appeared normal\non this measure. Interestingly, weight loss was a factor for which they\ncontrolled in designing the study. Some of the mice were calorie restricted\nand others were not. They concluded that weight loss was not required to get\nthe benefit of the ketogenic diet\u2014the diet alone was enough.\n\n## Implications\n\nThe two women described in the Schizophrenia Research article above, who are\ncurrently in complete remission from schizophrenia, probably do not care why\nthis diet worked. The proof is in the pudding for them. But we doctors like to\nknow more about how and why things work, and better understand how many more\npeople might respond to this type of treatment. Clearly, more research is\nneeded. However, make no mistake. All of these research findings, from the\nbasic science of schizophrenia to the case reports and studies mentioned here,\nopen up a new field of inquiry\u2014one based on entirely novel mechanisms of\naction and a whole new way of understanding schizophrenia. I, for one, am\nhopeful for the millions of people suffering. The sooner we can offer more\neffective treatments, the better.\n\n## Should Someone Try This Diet on Their Own?\n\nIf you have schizophrenia or any serious disorder and are considering using\nthe ketogenic diet as a treatment, I strongly recommend that you consult with\na healthcare professional before trying this diet. Why? Because mental\nillnesses are serious disorders and sometimes dangerous. The medical version\nof the ketogenic diet has risks and side effects. You should have accurate\ninformation, help, and medical supervision to implement treatments in a safe\nand effective way. All of the patients described in all of these studies were\ntreated by physicians while attempting the ketogenic diet.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Nothing in this article is intended as medical advice. Anyone\ncontemplating the ketogenic diet as a treatment for illness of any kind is\nurged to seek medical help from a competent medical provider trained in\ntreatment of the underlying condition as well as the ketogenic diet therapy\nbefore initiating the ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet induces significant\nmetabolic changes which can impact medication metabolism, among other things.\nIndividuals seeking treatment of any illness using the ketogenic diet will\nlikely require additional support especially during the initial adaptation\nphase, and thereafter for the duration of treatment which can take years\ndepending on a variety of factors.
