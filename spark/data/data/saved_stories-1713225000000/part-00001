The forests\nwhere he frolicked were near Lake Michigan, around where Wisconsin and\nIllinois meet. The spot is striking\u2014in these woods, there are large, old trees\nthat have contorted into incredible shapes.\n\nNo more than four or five feet off the ground, these trees bend sharply into\nright angles, parallel the earth for a measure, and turn sharply up again,\ntowards the sky. These trees are now abandoned infrastructure. Like like other\nstructural relics, they were designed to be long-lasting\u2013so much so that some\nof these trees are still indicating the way. But the people they served have\nbeen forced to leave, and the marker trees themselves are in danger of\ndisappearing.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld. See Courses\n\nMany people who come across trees like these in the forest share the same\ninstinctive response: this can\u2019t be natural. And as a kid, Downes was taught\nthat they were not. The trees looked like that, he was told, because native\ntribes had purposefully shaped them to mark trails through the woods and\nacross the water. \u201cHaving the knowledge of these trail trees could mean the\ndifference between life and death, between eating and starving, between\ncrossing the river correctly or incorrectly,\u201d he says.\n\nDownes, a sculptor and painter, comes from a family of doctors and scientists,\nand he wanted to back up the stories he\u2019d been told about these markers with\nharder facts. As incredible as these trees seemed, ice, wind and other fallen\ntrees can bend young saplings into dramatic shapes that they keep for their\nwhole lives, without any intervention from humans.\n\nA marker tree with two vertical branches (Photo: Courtesy of Don Wells)\n\nDownes went in search of evidence showing that people had lifted this idea\nfrom nature and used it to create a navigational system of their own design.\nIn his early 20s, he found his first clues: reports by a scientist working\nbefore World War II, who had studied and documented these trees. \u201cI was\ndetermined to go everywhere he went,\u201d Downes says now. But that was just the\nbeginning of his research: he spent 28 years collecting information about\n\u201cmarker trees\u201d before he published what he knew.\n\nThere are still skeptics who have trouble believing marker trees were made by\nhumans. Even among the people most knowledgeable about these trees, there\u2019s\ndisagreement about how many true marker trees have been identified. But Downes\nand other researchers have found confirmation from historical accounts and\nphotos and from the elders of Native American tribes that particular trees\nwere used as navigational aides.\n\nJanssen with a marker tree (Photo: Courtesy of Dennis Downes)\n\nThere are a few features that marker tree enthusiasts say can be used to\ndistinguish them from naturally bent trees. They must, first of all, be old\nenough to have been alive when Native American tribes still lived in the area.\nThe bend can\u2019t be too far from the ground. They should indicate some sort of\nfeature of the land, whether it\u2019s a trail, a spring, or a place to ford a\nriver. Trees bent in the same way, along a particular trail, might indicate\nhuman intervention.\n\nDownes\u2019 investigation into marker trees began with Raymond E. Janssen, a\ngeologist who was working in Illinois in the 1930s and 1940s. Like Downes,\nJanssen was fascinated with bent trees. \u201cThe casual observer views them merely\nas deformed freaks; but careful observation and comparison of the nature of\nthe deformities indicate that these trees did not acquire their strange shapes\nsimply by accident,\u201d he wrote, in one of four articles he penned on the\nsubject.\n\nOne of these articles was Downes\u2019 first clue that marker trees might be taken\nseriously as cultivated artifacts. Janssen had traveled to 13 states, trying\nto learn about marker trees, and he laid out some guidelines for\ndistinguishing marker trees from trees naturally bent into weird shapes. And\nonce Downes started trying to follow in Janssen\u2019s footprints, he kept finding\nclues to follow\u2013a plaque marking the spot where one tree had stood on the\nshores of Lake Michigan; a picture from an event sponsored by the wife of\nHarold Ickes, the Depression-era Secretary of the Interior; slides from the\ncollection of a landscape architect, Richard Gloede, who designed Chicago\u2019s\nIndian Boundary Park and was also a connoisseur of strangely shaped trees.\n\nA 1880s photo of a marker tree in Illinois (Photo: Lakes Region Historical\nSociety/Wikimedia)\n\nMuch of the older work documenting marker trees happened before World War II\nand before the interstate highway system swept through the country, which\nrequired cutting down forests\u2014be they bent or not. One Native American\nhistorian told Downes that before the concrete roads came through, it was much\nmore common to find marker trees in Illinois and Wisconsin, for instance. By\nthe time Downes started rediscovering them, even more had been lost. At one\npoint, there were at least 11 bent trees along a trail that went from the\nshores of Lake Michigan to Skokie, Illinois, around a swampy area. When\nJanssen was writing, seven of those remained. Some of those seven have since\ndied.\n\nPerhaps the best evidence for man-made marker trees comes from tribal elders.\nIn one case, for example, Earl Otchingwanigan, a professor emeritus and\nSmithsonian consultant, showed Downes a marker tree that had been created in\n1933, by two men who had been 70 at the time\u2013old enough to have at least\nlearned the practice from people who might have shaped original marker trees.\n\nDownes with another classically shaped marker tree (Photo: Courtesy of Dennis\nDownes)\n\nIt\u2019s stories like these that most convince marker trail enthusiasts that at\nleast some of the bent trees in American forests were shaped that ways on\npurpose.\n\n\u201cThere are still skeptics out there, mostly in the academic community,\u201d says\nDon Wells, whose Mountain Stewards began finding marker trees in Georgia\naround 2003. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to enough elders, that I know what the truth is. I\njust ignore them.\u201d\n\nWells\u2019 group used to bore into marker trees to try to establish their ages\u2013to\nprove they\u2019re old enough to have been shaped by native people\u2013but, he says,\nhas stopped, after tribal elders asked them not to. (It\u2019s considered\ndisrespectful to the trees, and there are other ways to establish that a tree\nis old enough to qualify.) More important than the age of the tree, though, is\nany evidence of people living in the area before white settlers came through.\nThe Texas Historic Tree Coalition collects information on age, species,\nshapes, and context of trees before presenting its evidence to the Comanche\nNation and seeking official recognition of a marker tree.\n\nThere are many, many more bent trees in the world than there are trees that\nmeet these criteria. Steve Houser, the arborist who leads the Texas group\u2019s\nefforts, says that over about two decades of work, he\u2019s had around 450\npotential marker trees brought to his attention. Of those, only about 155\nmerited further investigation, and only a handful of those received official\nrecognition.\n\n(Photo: Courtesy of Don Wells)\n\nFor the marker tree enthusiasts, that level of scrutiny is necessary to combat\nskeptics who are not convinced these trees have any special purpose.\n\n\u201cI will not say every bent tree in the forest is a trail marker tree,\u201d says\nDownes. \u201cIf there are only a few hundred of these unique living artifacts\nleft, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nThe Texas tree, after it was damaged (Photo: Steve Houser)\n\nThat number is dwindling, though. These trees are not legally protected in any\nway, and, even if humans leave them in peace, age is creeping up on them. One\nof the trees that the Texas coalition had officially recognized in 1996 was\ndamaged the very next year. The tree had originally touched the ground and\ngrown upwards, but over Memorial Day in 1997, a storm broke its vertical\ntrunk. All that was left was an unusual beam of tree, arced horizontally to\nthe ground.\n\nRead next\n\n### The 19th-Century Law Behind the Oregon Standoff\n\nsignsroadstreesplants\n\nWant to see fewer ads?
