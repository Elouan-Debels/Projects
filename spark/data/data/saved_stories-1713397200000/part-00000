One day, he and\na college friend camped in a rainforest on the country\u2019s Pacific coast and\ndrifted to sleep on hammocks they brought from home, to the sounds of shouting\nmonkeys and scurrying lizards.\n\nThe next morning, Loosararian walked to a nearby public shower. While rinsing\noff, he watched a green lizard\u2014a gecko\u2014walk up the shower wall, and thought to\nhimself: That would be a good name for my future company.\n\nToday, Gecko Robotics, worth more than $600 million based on its latest\nfunding round in December, makes wall-climbing robots that inspect\ninfrastructure, like dams, power plants, and manufacturing facilities. The\nrobots find rust, corrosion, cracks, and other defects so maintenance crews\ncan fix them before they cause irreparable damage and require entirely new\nstructures to be built, which can be costly and bad for the environment.\n\nAdditionally, Gecko recently raised $100 million to expand its defense\ntechnology operations, following its work with the U.S. Navy and Air Force to\ninspect ships and flight decks. The company has more than 250 employees, 20 of\nwhom come from Peter Thiel\u2019s data mining and software company Palantir\nTechnologies.\n\nLoosararian, now CEO, thinks Gecko could help with the inspections of all\nstructures. \u201cThere\u2019s things we don\u2019t think about every day, like rust and\ncorrosion, but if someone\u2019s not taking care of that, we all pay the\nconsequence,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nIn 2021, the collapse of an apartment building in Surfside, Fla., killed 98\npeople, and an infrastructure-focused government agency is investigating the\ncause, potentially structural degradation from corrosion and water exposure.\nThat same year, an oil spill in Southern California\u2014thought not to be caused\nby weak infrastructure\u2014sparked fears that the aging oil pipeline system in the\nU.S. could produce similar leaks. In the last 20 years, pipeline incidents\ncost the U.S. $11.4 billion and caused 278 deaths, partly due to aging\ninfrastructure, according to the government agency in charge of pipelines.\n\n\u201cWhen structures fail catastrophically, the impact on our society and\nenvironment are huge,\u201d said Cornell University engineering professor Matthew\nReiter. This kind of inspection helps in \u201cdealing with the small problems\nbefore they become big problems.\u201d\n\nBut at many points while building Gecko Robotics, Loosararian said he was\nclose to giving up. He poured his savings into the startup because he didn\u2019t\nknow how to raise money, he said. He slept in power plants for three years and\ntook his now-wife on dates to the lab where he worked on building his robots.\nHe cycled through cofounders and worked without pay for three years, all while\nchasing the high of building something bigger than himself, he said. Eleven\nyears after he named his company after a reptile he saw while showering, Gecko\nstands as the half-billion-dollar company that almost never was.\n\n## Robot no. 1\n\nLoosararian began working on the robot months before his trip to Costa Rica,\nduring his fall 2012 semester at the small Christian college in western\nPennsylvania. In fact, the seeds for Gecko were planted a couple of years\nearlier.\n\nIt started in 2010 at a power plant 22 miles from the college, called\nScrubgrass Generating Plant. The facility\u2019s managers needed something to\nbetter inspect two boilers, giant chambers where coal heats water into high-\npressure steam to generate electricity. The inner walls of boilers undergo\nextreme pressure and changes in temperature, which can cause corrosion. Hot\nsand also sits in the boiler pipes and can eat away at the tubes, causing\nleaks and shutdowns if they aren\u2019t regularly inspected and repaired.\n\nAt the time, engineers examined the structures using a handheld ultrasonic\nsensor, or a device that detects cracks and corrosion using sound waves. The\nworkers either hung from ropes to do this, which can be dangerous, or built\nscaffolding to climb, which can be expensive.\n\nIn a partnership between the power plant and the college, Scrubgrass engineer\nJeff Campbell and engineering professor Vernon Ulrich created a series of\nsenior projects around this problem. The assignment: Build a robot that uses\nmagnetic wheels to climb and perform ultrasonic readings inside the boilers,\neach the size of an 18-wheeler standing on its nose. Over three years\nbeginning in 2010, three groups of students worked on prototypes, with\nScrubgrass funding the cost of materials. Loosararian participated in the\nthird group alongside three other electrical engineering students. The school\ndonated the finished robot to the plant, which used it for years after.\n\nMike Bright, a Grove City professor who advised on the project, called\nLoosararian the \u201cintellectual powerhouse of the group.\u201d Loosararian had\n\u201cbrilliant insights\u201d that turned the senior project into a company, including\nthe business model of renting out robots and refashioning the prototype to\nfunction on different surfaces, Bright told Fortune.\n\nLoosararian redesigned the hardware for the robots that became Gecko, so his\nrobots look entirely different from what the student project produced, said\nUlrich, who also advised the seniors.\n\nThe senior project team in 2013. From left: Ian Miller, Andrew Wilson, Orion\nCorrea, Jake Loosararian.\n\nCourtesy of Yvonne English\n\nLoosararian cofounded Gecko in May 2013, the same month he graduated college.\nFellow senior project member Orion Correa was the other cofounder. The other\nengineers had discussed joining the company but had jobs lined up or didn\u2019t\nwant to work at a startup, said Yvonne English, who advised the students on\nthe business model through the college\u2019s early-stage business lab. English\nalso worked as the executive director of a business incubator called the\neCenter@LindenPointe, which Loosararian would become a part of for two years.\n\nCorrea stayed on for one year before leaving. \u201cI was broke and overly\nstressed,\u201d he told Fortune in a statement. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep doing the startup\nbootstrap thing and we didn\u2019t have any immediate prospects for revenue.\u201d It\nwas the right decision for him at the time, Correa said. Loosararian bought\nCorrea\u2019s 50% stake for around $1,600, which Loosararian said was a fortune for\nhim to spend at the time.\n\nLoosararian spent the next three years emptying his bank account, more than\n$30,000, on the company and sleeping between a friend\u2019s apartment floor and\nthe very power plants he was testing the robots on. Spending time with\ncustomers (and sleeping on-site) helped him create practical, not theoretical,\nsolutions to problems at the plants, he said, because he was living them.\n\n\u201cEvery date I went on was focused on this,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery chance I got, I\nwas living in a power plant and talking to some 60-year-old about their\nfacilities.\u201d\n\nAt one point around this time, English remembers walking through the offices\nof the eCenter@LindenPointe, where Loosararian had a suite, and seeing him lay\non the concrete floor, staring at the ceiling. The lights, which are motion-\nactivated, were off. Her first thought was: I knew this was coming.\n\nHe was questioning his decision to build Gecko, she told Fortune. Now sitting\nup, Loosararian and English discussed if he still believed in the company,\nwhich he said he did.\n\nJake Loosararian with an early prototype of the robot.\n\nCourtesy of Yvonne English\n\nReflecting on the time period, Loosararian said, \u201cIt was hard to feel like I\nwas a part of something bigger than me when it was just me. That took me to\nsome really dark places. If I was doing it for any other reason than the\nmission of the company, man, I would have quit a long time ago.\u201d\n\n## Something bigger\n\nLoosararian\u2019s desire to be part of something bigger stems from an experience\nhe had years prior. In the summer of 2012, before he began working on the\nrobots, the student participated in a cross-country bike ride that sparked a\nfeeling he would continue to chase for years.\n\nHe and four other Grove City students biked from Seattle to New York to raise\nmoney for a need-based scholarship program for minority students at their\ncollege. Grove City agreed to permanently endow a scholarship if the group\nraised $25,000. The team traveled more than 70 miles per day, occasionally\nhitting more than 100 miles daily, sleeping in the backyards of alumni and\ngarnering the attention of local news outlets across the country.\n\nIt was the first time Loosararian felt like he was making a difference, and he\ncalled the feeling \u201cintoxicating.\u201d The group raised $50,000, and the\nscholarship still exists at Grove City today.\n\nThe founder, now 33, grew up in the D.C. area. His home-school education\nconsisted of building robots from kits and playing in the woods. While he\ndidn\u2019t always love home school, it allowed him to focus his learning on what\ninterested him.\n\nBy 2016, Loosararian\u2014still interested in robots\u2014brought on two top executives\nhe knew from Grove City, Troy Demmer and Ian Miller. They each held a\ncofounder title, despite joining three years after Loosararian created Gecko\nwith Correa. The reason for bringing on new cofounders, Loosararian said, was\nGecko\u2019s acceptance that same year into Y Combinator, the exclusive Silicon\nValley startup accelerator program then run by Sam Altman, now OpenAI\u2019s chief\nexecutive. Loosararian spent his honeymoon with his wife on another cross-\ncountry road trip\u2014this one taking five days\u2014to Mountain View, Calif., for the\nprogram.\n\nFor three months during Y Combinator, Loosararian, his wife, and seven\nengineers lived in a three-bedroom house with a family one of the engineers\nknew. The garage became the lab, and the team tested the climbing robots on\nthe side of the house.\n\nBy the end of the program, Gecko had $1 million in purchase orders from\ncustomers, Loosararian said. In 2017, the company became profitable, but it\nalso lost Miller as a cofounder. He had a different vision for the company,\nsaid Loosararian, who took the loss hard. Miller had been a close friend in\ncollege and had helped build the first robot for Scrubgrass.\n\n\u201cGoing through the motions of feeling\u2014What if I quit? What if I hand this\nover?\u2014those moments are helpful because it could have produced a different\noutcome, but in this case, it produced a fierce focus on what we need to do,\u201d\nLoosararian said.\n\nMiller didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The two are still friends,\nLoosararian said.\n\n## An army of robots\n\nLoosararian spent the next few years growing Gecko\u2019s workforce from just a\ndozen employees to more than 200 today after admitting to initially hiring too\nslowly.\n\nIf there was a job to do, Loosararian preferred that he or Demmer, the other\ncofounder who is still with Gecko, try to take it on before hiring anyone. The\ncompany\u2019s slow headcount growth also came from a high talent bar for\napplicants and new hires set by Loosararian.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so painful if you hire people that are not the absolute best for the\nposition,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few people in the world that can actually\nsolve these problems. I honestly just don\u2019t want to work with people who\naren\u2019t literally the best.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Gecko Robotics\n\nGecko now has 150 robots that its employees operate at customer sites. The\nmachines, about the size of a rolling suitcase, still use magnetic wheels to\nclimb steel, and for non-magnetic structures like concrete, robots climb using\nvacuum adhesion.\n\nAfter scanning a surface, Gecko builds a digital model of the structure so\ncustomers can see virtually exactly where the damage is. The company\u2019s\nsoftware products use artificial intelligence to help clients analyze the\ndamage, including determining the corrosion rate and the estimated remaining\nlife expectancy. Its AI then advises customers on necessary repairs and\npredictive maintenance, which works to reduce the risk of catastrophic\nfailures like explosions, leaks, or collapses. Customers pay for the data and\nrepair plans, though Gecko wouldn\u2019t disclose how much the service costs. It\nalso declined to comment on revenue and profit figures.\n\nCourtesy of Gecko Robotics\n\nGecko faces competition from other robot makers focused on inspecting\ninfrastructure. Latvian startup Aerones suspends robots from ropes to inspect\nand maintain wind turbines, which includes cleaning and coating the blades\nwith a solution that prevents ice buildup. ANYbotics, in Zurich, has four-\nlegged robots performing inspections across power, mining, and railway\nindustries. Meanwhile, companies like Switzerland\u2019s Flyability and\nCalifornia\u2019s Skydio make drones that inspect assets for customers.\n\nOverall, the robotics industry has hit some turbulence. Last year, Google-\nparent Alphabet shut down its \u201cEveryday Robots\u201d division, which built robots\nto help with office work, as part of a larger 12,000-person workforce\nreduction. Robotic vacuum company Neato Robotics closed last year after an\n18-year run, because it couldn\u2019t meet financial goals, according to its parent\ncompany. Once valued at $2.25 billion, pizza-making robot company Zume also\nshuttered last summer.\n\nLoosararian attributes Gecko\u2019s growth during this time to the industry\u2019s\ndemand for data and the company\u2019s foundation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sit on the toilet and\nthink, I bet a robot could clean dishes and scrub bathrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\nwent into the heart of the industrial economy to learn how things were made in\nthe real world and built robots to exist within it.\u201d\n\nRobots, especially robot crawlers, are the future for inspecting\ninfrastructure, said Reiter, the Cornell engineering professor. And inspection\nis more important than ever as buildings continue to age and new construction\npresents new problems.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that structures are becoming more complex,\u201d Reiter told\nFortune. Historically, \u201cone person would know everything from concept to\ncompletion, but now the buildings are so complex and there\u2019s so many trades,\nspecialty contractors, engineers, and architects involved that not one person\ncan understand all of it.\u201d\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s difficult for engineers to prioritize quality control from\nthe beginning of construction, he said. \u201cThings aren\u2019t performing or lasting\nas long as they could.\u201d\n\nCorrection, April 17, 2024: A previous version of this article misstated the\nbusiness incubator Loosararian participated in. It was the\neCenter@LindenPointe.\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
