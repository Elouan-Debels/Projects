He cautioned that he did not support calls to defund\nNPR.\n\nUri Berliner\n\nNPR senior business editor Uri Berliner resigned this morning, citing the\nresponse of the network's chief executive to his outside essay accusing NPR of\nlosing the public's trust.\n\n\"I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for\n25 years,\" Berliner wrote in an email to CEO Katherine Maher. \"I respect the\nintegrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important\njournalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO\nwhose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press\nessay.\"\n\nNPR and Maher declined to comment on his resignation.\n\nThe Free Press, an online site embraced by journalists who believe that the\nmainstream media has become too liberal, published Berliner's piece last\nTuesday. In it, he argued that NPR's coverage has increasingly reflected a\nrigid progressive ideology. And he argued that the network's quest for greater\ndiversity in its workforce \u2014 a priority under prior chief executive John\nLansing \u2013 has not been accompanied by a diversity of viewpoints presented in\nNPR shows, podcasts or online coverage.\n\nLater that same day, NPR pushed back against Berliner's critique.\n\n\"We're proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do\nto cover a wide range of challenging stories,\" NPR's chief news executive,\nEdith Chapin, wrote in a memo to staff . \"We believe that inclusion \u2014 among\nour staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage \u2014 is critical to\ntelling the nuanced stories of this country and our world.\"\n\nYet Berliner's commentary has been embraced by conservative and partisan\nRepublican critics of the network, including former President Donald Trump and\nthe activist Christopher Rufo.\n\nRufo is posting a parade of old social media posts from Maher, who took over\nNPR last month. In two examples, she called Trump a racist and also seemed to\nminimize the effects of rioting in 2020. Rufo is using those to rally public\npressure for Maher's ouster, as he did for former Harvard University President\nClaudine Gay.\n\nOthers have used the moment to call for the elimination of federal funding for\nNPR \u2013 less than one percent of its roughly $300 million annual budget \u2013 and\nlocal public radio stations, which derive more of their funding from the\ngovernment.\n\n### Media\n\n### NPR names tech executive Katherine Maher to lead in turbulent era\n\nBerliner reiterated in his resignation letter that he does not support such\ncalls.\n\nIn a brief interview, he condemned a statement Maher issued Friday in which\nshe suggested that he had questioned \"whether our people are serving our\nmission with integrity, based on little more than the recognition of their\nidentity.\" She called that \"profoundly disrespectful, hurtful, and demeaning.\"\n\nBerliner subsequently exchanged emails with Maher, but she did not address\nthose comments.\n\n\"It's been building up,\" Berliner said of his decision to resign, \"and it\nbecame clear it was on today.\"\n\nFor publishing his essay in The Free Press and appearing on its podcast, NPR\nhad suspended Berliner for five days without pay. Its formal rebuke noted he\nhad done work outside NPR without its permission, as is required, and shared\nproprietary information.\n\n(Disclosure: Like Berliner, I am part of NPR's Business Desk. He has edited\nmany of my past stories. But he did not see any version of this article or\nparticipate in its preparation before it was posted publicly.)\n\nEarlier in the day, Berliner forwarded to NPR editors and other colleagues a\nnote saying he had \"never questioned\" their integrity and had been trying to\nraise these issues within the newsroom for more than seven years.\n\nWhat followed was an email he had sent to newsroom leaders after Trump's 2016\nwin. He wrote then: \"Primarily for the sake of our journalism, we can't align\nourselves with a tribe. So we don't exist in a cocoon that blinds us to the\nviews and experience of tens of millions of our fellow citizens.\"\n\nBerliner's critique has inspired anger and dismay within the network. Some\ncolleagues said they could no longer trust him after he chose to publicize\nsuch concerns rather than pursue them as part of ongoing newsroom debates, as\nis customary. Many signed a letter to Maher and Edith Chapin, NPR's chief news\nexecutive. They asked for clarity on, among other things, how Berliner's essay\nand the resulting public controversy would affect news coverage.\n\nYet some colleagues privately said Berliner's critique carried some truth.\nChapin also announced monthly reviews of the network's coverage for fairness\nand diversity - including diversity of viewpoint.\n\nShe said in a text message earlier this week that that initiative had been\ndiscussed long before Berliner's essay, but \"Now seemed [the] time to deliver\nif we were going to do it.\"\n\nShe added, \"Healthy discussion is something we need more of.\"\n\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent\nDavid Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing\nEditor Gerry Holmes. Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no NPR\ncorporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted\npublicly.\n\n  * Katherine Maher\n  * uri berliner\n  * journalism\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Media\n\n#### NPR suspends veteran editor as it grapples with his public criticism\n\n##### Media\n\n#### NPR defends its journalism after senior editor says it has lost the\npublic's trust\n\n##### Asia\n\n#### Radio Free Asia closes its Hong Kong operation over safety concerns for\nits staff\n\n##### World\n\n#### U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich has now spent a whole year jailed in\nRussia\n\n##### Media\n\n#### Chevron owns this city's news site.
