I've shown them\nsomething that they expect to be true (or false) and then shown that their\nexpectations can be confounded. When I do that, a common response is \"Well,\nyou're just being stupid.\"This is common enough that I thought I'd write a\nlittle bit about it. See, in this case what they're calling \"stupid\" is\nsomething that I call \"intriguing\". What they're discovering is that so far\nthey've only met \"nice\" and \"normal\" things, and that there are things out\nthere that are not \"nice,\" not \"normal,\" and which do not behave in the way\nthey expect.So let me give you a simple example.A SeparationSo far so good.So\nif we have a set of points and there is no way we can draw a disconnection, no\nway that we can draw a line separating the points into two (or more) regions,\nthen the set of points must obviously be connected.So let's take a specific\nexample. Let's take all the points (x,y) that satisfy the equation:y=sin(1/x),\nx>0,and let's additionally take all the points (x,y) where x<=0 and -1<y<1\\.\nWhat does that look like?Well, something like this:| Not path-wise connected  \n---  \n  \nAt this point I'm not including the possibility of a \"number\" that's greater\nthan zero but smaller than every positive real. Down that path lies non-\nstandard analysis, and it's, well, non-standard. So the assertion that there\nis no disconnection relies on the fact that we're using the real numbers that\nwe know and love.\n\nWell, that we know, anyway.\n\nSo there's no disconnection, but it's not \"connected\" in the usual sense of\nthe term, because we can't walk from anywhere to anywhere.\n\nIt's at this point I usually get the response:\n\nWell now you're just being stupid.\n\n* Connected\n\n  * meaning no disconnection\n\n* Path-wise connected\n\n  * Meaning you can walk to anywhere from anywhere\n\nAnd this is what a maths degree is actually about. It's about being able to be\nprecise, and to be sceptical about things that look reasonable, but which\ndon't have a proof. It's about being able to follow a long chain of reasoning,\nand to know whether or not the argument is sound. Usually the things being\nreasoned about are abstract, and then the techniques have a value of their own\nin possibly unexpected ways, but it's really the reasoning itself that is the\nreal prize.\n\nSo when something comes up that you don't expect the best response is not\n\"Well, now you're just being stupid.\" but instead is:\n\nThat's cool:\n\n  * How can I fix it?\n  * How can I break it?\n  * How can I know for sure what's true?\n\n  \n---  \n  \nIt's hard to get this right, and it's hard to develop these skills, but\nnothing worth having comes for free, and it's those abilities that make the\nmaths degree of value no matter where you end up in your life and career.\n\n<<<< Prev <<<<There Is No Time For This| :| >>>> Next >>>>Hacker News User\nAges ...  \n---|---|---  \nYou should follow me on twitter  \n---  \n  \n## Comments\n\nI've decided no longer to include comments directly via the Disqus (or any\nother) system. Instead, I'd be more than delighted to get emails from people\nwho wish to make comments or engage in discussion. Comments will then be\nintegrated into the page as and when they are appropriate.\n\nIf the number of emails/comments gets too large to handle then I might return\nto a semi-automated system. That's looking increasingly unlikely.  \n  \n# Contents\n\n  * Poking The Dusty Corners - 2015/04/14\n    * Comments\n\n|\n\n# Links on this page\n\n  * AMatterOfConvention\n  * AnOddityInTennis\n  * BeyondTheBoundary\n  * BinarySearchReconsidered\n  * ColinsBlog\n  * ColinsBlog2007\n  * ColinsBlog2008\n  * ColinsBlog2009\n  * ColinsBlog2010\n  * ColinsBlogBefore2007\n  * DecisionTreeForTennis\n  * DecisionTreesInGames\n  * DiagrammingMathsTopics\n  * DissectingACircle\n  * DissectingASquare\n  * DissectingASquarePart2\n  * DoYouNourishOrTarnish\n  * FillInTheGaps\n  * GracefulDegradation\n  * HackerNewsUserAges\n  * Infinity\n  * IrrationalsExist\n  * LearningTimesTables\n  * Mathematics\n  * MultipleChoiceProbabilityPuzzle\n  * NASASpaceCrews\n  * OnTheRack\n  * PublicallySharingLinks\n  * RandomEratosthenes\n  * RandomWritings\n  * RevisitingTheAnt\n  * SettingUpRSS\n  * SoftwareChecklist\n  * SquareRootByLongDivision\n  * TheAntAndTheRubberBand\n  * TheBirthdayParadox\n  * TheForgivingUserInterface\n  * TheLostPropertyOffice\n  * TheTrapeziumConundrum\n  * ThereIsNoTimeForThis\n  * TwoEqualsFour\n  * WithdrawingFromHackerNews\n  * WrappingUpSquareDissection\n\n| | Site hosted by Colin and Rachel Wright:\n\n  * Maths, Design, Juggling, Computing,\n  * Embroidery, Proof-reading,\n  * and other clever stuff.\n\n  \n---  \n  \nSuggest a change ( <\\-- What does this mean?) / Send me email Front Page / All\npages by date / Site overview / Top of page\n\nQuotation from Tim Berners-Lee  \n---\n\n", "frontpage": false}
