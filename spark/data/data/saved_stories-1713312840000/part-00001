No need for any further action.\u201d No, it\u2019s NOT a\n> victory. Yes, it\u2019s a remarkable success of Israel\u2019s air defense systems, but\n> it\u2019s not a victory. When a bully tries to hit you 350 times and only\n> succeeds seven time, you\u2019ve NOT won. You don\u2019t win wars just by intercepting\n> your enemy\u2019s hits, nor do you deter it. Your enemy will just try harder with\n> more and better weapons and methods next time. How DO you deter? By exacting\n> a deeply painful price.\n\nUnless Prime Minister Netanyahu is as dense as his detractors believe, he must\nbe thinking along similar lines.\n\nBennett concludes,\n\n> We\u2019re not asking anyone to fight for us. We\u2019ll do the job. But we do expect\n> our allies to have our back, especially when it\u2019s tough\u2014and now it\u2019s tough.\n> Be on the right side and help us defeat these horrible and savage regimes.\n\nIf Israel chooses to sit back and do nothing, it gains the approval of the\n\u201cinternational community.\u201d The question is how much that is worth. The\n\u201cinternational community\u201d has been willing to tolerate Iran undertaking a\ncampaign against Israel that any sovereign state would regard as intolerable.\nIt tolerates Israel constantly being attacked by Iran\u2019s proxy Hezbollah in the\nNorth, depriving Israel of some of its territory and requiring Israel to keep\nmany men out of the economy and in the army. The American Administration and\nits allies are making Israel pay a huge price for \u201cironclad\u201d support. Iran is\npaying no price at all.\n\nIran has been at war with Israel for years. In the past, Iran used proxies,\nand it may revert to doing that. But in any case, Israel should not aim for\nmere retaliation. It should aim to decisively push back the Iranian threat.\n\nAs of this writing, Israel has not launched a military response. One option\nthat it has is to ask the \u201cinternational community\u201d to undertake meaningful\ndiplomatic action. For example, if the U.S. and its friends could force\nHezbollah to abide by UN resolutions and withdraw from the border region, that\nwould be a real achievement.\n\nIf Israel chooses military options, I do not think that a \u201cone-off\u201d is the way\nto go. Instead, it should treat this conflict as the war that it is. That\nmeans relentless attacks that serve to weaken Iran\u2019s regime. Above all, this\nwould mean attempting to destroy the regime\u2019s most loyal military and security\nforces.\n\nOne of the softest targets in Iran would be its infrastructure for pumping and\nexporting oil. That would indirectly be an attack on President Biden, because\nhigher gas prices would hurt his reelection chances. So one way to tell how\nIsrael\u2019s government really feels about President Biden\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d support is\nto see whether or not Israel attacks the oil infrastructure.\n\nI suspect that only a \u201cproportionate\u201d or \u201csymbolic\u201d response would fail to\nhave a deterrent effect. It would end up putting Israel in a worse position in\nthe long run. Iran\u2019s regime would survive, and the \u201cinternational community\u201d\nwould revert to criticizing Israel for trying to win a war.\n\nWhat should the United States seek for an outcome? I think that the\nAdministration would like the region to remain as quiet as possible. How to\nachieve that?\n\nIt seems to me that the Obama-Biden approach was to try to work with the\nIranian regime and to attempt to change Israel\u2019s regime. Perhaps that is the\nopposite of what they should have been thinking.\n\nI think that the American people, if not their leaders, are tired of playing\nWhack-a-Mole with radical Islamists. We defeat the Taliban, and they come\nback. We defeat ISIS, and it comes back. My guess is that we are afraid that\nwe cannot permanently dislodge the Mullahs from Iran. But Iranian culture is\nnot as hopeless as that in Iraq or Syria or Afghanistan. And after almost 50\nyears of theocracy, the Iranian people probably would prefer something else.\n\nShare\n\n30 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n30\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Israel's Choices\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n25\n\nShare\n\n25 Comments\n\nstu5 hrs ago\u00b7edited 3 hrs agoIt seems your analysis is missing two key\nfactors:Iran's attack was in response to an attack on their embassy.Iran's\nattack was telegraphed (I hear). It was largely symbolic.Neither factor makes\nIran the good guy but both seem critical in formulating further action.Expand\nfull commentLike (10)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies\n\nJL4 hrs agoYou can't win a war with air attacks. Not possible short of nuclear\nweapons. See Vietnam, WW2, UK blitz, Afghanistan, etc. Is Israel going to send\nground troops to attack Iran to win the war like they have done with Gaza? No\nchance. Bad idea.You can hurt a lot of people and infrastructure from the air\n- \"exact a deeply painful price\". This further entrenches the current regime\nand enables them to gain popular support and savagely attack any internal\nopposition. See Vietnam, WW2, Afghanistan, etc.Direct air attacks create a\ntit-for-tat response that can wreck both countries for decades. Israel has\nmore to lose from this since it is a highly successful country. Iran is\nalready a wreck.The big picture is that decades of low-level conflicts with\nIran and others have not prevented Israel from becoming one of the most\nsuccessful countries in the world. Escalating to a high-level conflict puts\nIsrael's success at risk. Will any US company set up factories or research\nprojects in Israel while there is a high-level conflict?There are no good or\neasy options here....The way for Israel to \"win\" is likely by continuing to do\nwhat has worked very well for decades.Expand full commentLike (4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\n23 more comments...\n\nThe Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\nWhy don't more women use it?\n\nSep 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n111\n\nI Condemn. . .But\n\nThe worst form of evil\n\nOct 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Condemn. . .But\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n80\n\nAssimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\nWe have not done it well\n\nMay 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n61\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arnold Kling\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
