Despite claims that the \u201cinternet\nwould fix this,\u201d fixing local journalism just wasn\u2019t profitable enough for the\ndipsy brunchlords that fail upward into positions of prominence at most media\ncompanies, so the internet... didn\u2019t.\n\nThose same academics will then tell you that the end result is an American\npopulace that\u2019s decidedly less informed and more divided, something that not\nonly has a measurable impact on electoral outcomes, but paves the way for more\nstate and local corruption (since fewer journalists are reporting on stuff\nlike local city council meetings or local political decisions). It also opened\nthe door to authoritarianism.\n\nEvery six months or so, a news report will emerge showing how all manner of\npolitical propagandists and bullshit artists have rushed to fill the vacuum\ncreated by longstanding policy failures and our refusal to competently fund\nlocal journalism at scale.\n\nOf particular problem has been so-called \u201cpink slime\u201d newspapers, or fake\nlocal news papers built by local partisan operatives to seed misinformation\nand propaganda in the minds of poorly educated and already misinformed local\nvoters.\n\nPri Bengani, a senior researcher at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at\nColumbia University studied the phenomenon in 2022 and found that there were\n1,200 bogus local news outlets around the country, all feeding gullible\nreaders a steady diet of misleading bullshit (on top of the bullshit they\nalready consume online).\n\nAnd, as expected, the problem is accelerating as we head into another election\nseason. The total of such fake newspapers has tripled since 2019, and now\nroughly equals the number of real journalism organizations in America. In many\ninstances, these networks are better funded and better organized than real\njournalism orgs, which find themselves relentlessly under fire by those with\nwealth and power who\u2019d prefer journalism simulacrum over hard-nosed reporting:\n\n> \u201cKathleen Carley, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon\n> University, said her research suggests that following the 2022 midterms \u201ca\n> lot more money\u201d is being poured into pink slime sites, including advertising\n> on Meta.\n>\n> \u201cA lot of these sites have had makeovers and look more realistic,\u201d she said.\n> \u201cI think we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of that moving forward.\u201d\n\nWhen the \u201cboth sides\u201d press covers this pink slime phenomenon, they sometimes\ntry to imply that this kind of stuff is happening perfectly symmetrically\namong both major parties (as this Financial Times story does). But one NPR\nreport indicates that roughly 95 percent of the fake newspapers they tracked\nwere created to aid Republican candidates.\n\nAngry at the factual reality espoused by academia, science, and journalism,\nthe ever-more-extremist U.S. right wing has engaged in a very successful 45+\nyear effort to undermine U.S. journalism, academia, and even libraries at\nevery turn, and then replace them with a vast and highly successful propaganda\nand delusion network across AM radio, broadcast TV, cable TV, and now the\ninternet.\n\nIt\u2019s a massive propaganda ecosystem that extends way beyond fake newspapers.\nIt\u2019s a self-contained participatory alternate reality where ideology is king\nand facts no longer matter. It\u2019s everything academics spent decades warning us\nabout. And, if you somehow hadn\u2019t noticed in the Trump era, it\u2019s working. Just\nask your family members who think a NYC real estate conman is pious.\n\nDemocrats tend to be feckless and often incoherent when it comes to coherent\nand forceful counter-messaging to increasingly radical right wing propaganda.\nThey also haven\u2019t understood the severity of the problem, and have generally\navoided having any kind of coherent media reform policies. If they respond to\nthe problem, it will likely involve behavior that looks similar.\n\nMeanwhile many in the academic and journalism industries still don\u2019t seem to\nhave the slightest awareness they\u2019re under systemic, existential attack, often\nblaming the implosion on ambiguous but somehow always unavoidable market\nrealities.\n\nBut the evidence is everywhere you look. Journalists are being fired by the\nthousands; folks with expertise are being replaced by incompetent brunchlords;\nand the ad-engagement based infotainment economy continues to shift from real\nreporting to controversy-churning, distraction-engagement bait.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty we could do to address the problem. We could adopt stronger\neducation and media criticism standards like Finland to prepare kids for a\nworld full of propaganda. We could staff outlets with competent leadership and\nfind new and creative ways to fund real, independent journalism. We could\nadopt media policies that rein in mindless consolidation, which tends to\nsteadily erode opinion diversity.\n\nBut we do absolutely none of that because it\u2019s simply not profitable enough.\nAnd in a country where mindlessly chasing wealth always takes top priority,\nyou ultimately get what you pay for.\n\nFiled Under: consolidation, disinformation, fake news, fake newspapers,\njournalism, misinformation, pink slime, politics, propaganda\n\n1 CommentLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * An Only Slightly Modest Proposal: If AI Companies Want More Content, They Should Fund Reporters, And Lots Of Them\n  * Company At Center Of Sports Illustrated, Gannett 'AI' Content Scandals Continues To Fail Upward\n  * Meta\u2019s Dumb Deletion Of Links To Journalism Shows Why Attempts To Tax Platforms That Link To Journalism Is Even Dumber\n  * Let Me Rewrite That For You: NY Times Misinforms Readers About RFK & Biden\n  * Cleveland Plain Dealer Editor Shows How To Cover Trump: Tell The Truth\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cFake \u2018Pink Slime\u2019 Propaganda Newspapers Surge Ahead Of Fall\nElection\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n1 Comment\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nStephen T. Stone (profile) says:\n\nApril 15, 2024 at 6:34 am\n\nGiven the religious makeup of a significant part of the primary voting base\nfor the GOP/Trump, the success of pink slime propaganda isn\u2019t all that\nsurprising. After all...\n\n> It\u2019s a self-contained participatory alternate reality where ideology is king\n> and facts no longer matter.\n\n...that sounds a lot like conservative evangelicalism. Someone without an\nounce of ethics and morals could probably fleece such people by printing their\nown pink slime with a heavily religious bent that only prints the bare minimum\nof actual facts next to comparisons of Trump and Jesus Christ.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\n## Add Your Comment Cancel reply\n\nFunniest/Most Insightful Comments Of The Week At Techdirt\n\nFake \u2018Pink Slime\u2019 Propaganda Newspapers Surge Ahead Of Fall Election\n\nFollow Techdirt\n\n### Techdirt Daily Newsletter\n\nA weekly news podcast from Mike Masnick & Ben Whitelaw\n\nSubscribe now to Ctrl-Alt-Speech \u00bb\n\nEssential Reading\n\n#### The Techdirt Greenhouse\n\nRead the latest posts:\n\n  * Winding Down Our Latest Greenhouse Panel: The Lessons Learned From SOPA/PIPA\n  * From The Revolt Against SOPA To The EU's Upload Filters\n  * Did We Miss Our Best Chance At Regulating The Internet?\n\nRead All \u00bb\n\n#### Trending Posts\n\n  * Fake 'Pink Slime' Propaganda Newspapers Surge Ahead Of Fall Election\n  * The FCC's New 'Broadband Nutrition Label' Doesn't Solve The Actual Problem: Unchecked Telecom Monopoly Power\n  * Funniest/Most Insightful Comments Of The Week At Techdirt\n\nTechdirt Deals\n\nBuy Now\n\n$150.00\n\nHushed Private Phone Line: Lifetime Virtual Number Subscription\n\nTechdirt Insider Discord\n\nThe latest chatter on the Techdirt Insider Discord channel...\n\n  * mildconcern: I think he's one of those dangerous types where 1/3rd or so of his ideas are actually based on reseearch which simply lends credibility to the other 2/3rd if you're not paying enough attentoin.\n  * \"If I really nail a couple of issues then people will trust whatever else I decide to extract from my left asscheek.\"\n  * Mike Masnick: I am against my better judgment reading his new book, as a larger publication has asked me to review it.

I went to Harvard.\n  * further proof 18 year olds shouldn't be trusted with major decisions.\n  * BentFranklin: Hah I was going to guess that\n  * Mike Masnick: and somehow you made it all this time without mentioning it. you must have trained that out of yourself.\n  * John Roddy: I went to Rice.*\n  * (I went on a tour of the campus)\n  * mildconcern: I try to avoid dropping the H bomb as much as I can.\n  * That aversion also helps explain why I didn't much enjoy going there, I think. \"Oh no. I'm surrounded by a pack of assholes.\"\n  * That said, the art of sounding right while being wrong is surely a featured curriculum at many US universities.\n  * BentFranklin: Keeping your data from Apple is harder than expected [article]\n\nhttps://www.aalto.fi/en/news/keeping-your-data-from-apple-is-harder-than-\nexpected\n\n  * mildconcern: And keeping the federal government running with the 5th Circuit around is also harder than expected.\n  * John Roddy: I'm waiting for the fifth circuit to issue a nationwide injunction on nationwide injunctions from the fifth circuit.\n  * mildconcern: If that causes the circuit to disappear in an internal contradiction, I'm all for it\n  * candescence: As usual, Elon is being a hypocrite about his whole \"well I'll follow the law\" stuff now that he's having beef with Brazil\n  * Mostly because it involves a left-wing government taking down right-wing content and banning right-wingers for breaking hate speech laws in the wake of Bolsonaro trying to stage a coup\n  * Meanwhile he's \"too busy\" to look into Twitter bowing to India and banning Modi's critics, as well as banning people connected to Alexei Navalny and voicing doubts about the Russian government's role in his death\n  * mildconcern: @Mike Masnick did you get to see totality? Skies were clear and the crowd was shouting in northern Vermont, though I could have done without the 11 hour car ride home.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yup! We're in Texas and ended up driving pretty far out to where it was predicted to be clearer and we had a great view.\n  * John Roddy: It's funny. I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * https://drive.google.com/file/d/...\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow.
