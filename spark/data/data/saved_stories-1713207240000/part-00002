In any\nparticular case, it\u2019s difficult to trace out the exact causes of the shortage\nbut health care is the US\u2019s most highly regulated, socialist industry and\nshortages are endemic under socialism so the pattern fits. The shortage of\nAdderall and other ADHD medications is a case in point. Adderall is a Schedule\nII controlled substance which means that in addition to the FDA and other\nhealth agencies the production of Adderall is also regulated, monitored and\ncontrolled by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nThe DEA aims to \u201ccombat criminal drug networks that bring harm, violence,\noverdoses, and poisonings to the United States.\u201d Its homepage displays stories\nof record drug seizures, pictures of \u201cmost wanted\u201d criminal fugitives, and\nheroic armed agents conducting drug raids. With this culture, do you think the\nDEA is the right agency to ensure that Americans are also well supplied with\nlegally prescribed amphetamines?\n\nIndeed, there is a large factory in the United States capable of producing 600\nmillion doses of Adderall annually that has been shut down by the DEA for over\na year because of trivial paperwork violations. The New York Magazine article\non the DEA created shortage has to be read to be believed.\n\n> Inside Ascent\u2019s 320,000-square-foot factory in Central Islip, a labyrinth of\n> sterile white hallways connects 105 manufacturing rooms, some of them\n> containing large, intricate machines capable of producing 400,000 tablets\n> per hour. In one of these rooms, Ascent\u2019s founder and CEO \u2014 Sudhakar\n> Vidiyala, Meghana\u2019s father \u2014 points to a hulking unit that he says is worth\n> $1.5 million. It\u2019s used to produce time-release Concerta tablets with three\n> colored layers, each dispensing the drug\u2019s active ingredient at a different\n> point in the tablet\u2019s journey through the body. \u201cAbout 25 percent of the\n> generic market would pass through this machine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t\n> make a single pill in 2023.\u201d\n>\n> ... the company has acknowledged that it committed infractions. For example,\n> orders struck from 222s must be crossed out with a line and the word cancel\n> written next to them. Investigators found two instances in which Ascent\n> employees had drawn the line but failed to write the word.\n\nThe causes of the DEA\u2019s crackdown appears to be precisely the contradiction in\nits dueling missions. Ascent also produces opioids and the DEA crackdown was\npart of what it calls Operation Bottleneck, a series of raids on a variety of\ncompanies to demand that they account for every pill produced.\n\nTo be sure, the opioid epidemic is a problem but the big, multi-national\nplants are not responsible for fentanyl on the streets and even in the early\nyears the opioid epidemic was a prescription problem (with some theft from\npharmacies) not a factory theft problem (see figure at left). Maybe you think\nAdderall is overprescribed. Could be but the DEA is supposed to be enforcing\nlaws not making drug policy. The one thing one can say for certain is that\nOperation Bottleneck has surely been a success in creating shortages of\nAdderall.\n\nThe DEA\u2019s contradictory role in both combating the illegal drug trade and\nregulating the supply of legal, prescription drugs is highlighted by the fact\nthat at the same as the DEA was raiding and shutting down Ascent, the FDA was\npleading with them to increase production!\n\n> For Ascent, one of the more frustrating parts of being told by the\n> government to stop making Adderall is that other parts of the government\n> have pleaded with the company to make more. The company says that on\n> multiple occasions, officials from the FDA asked it to increase production\n> in response to the shortage, and that Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from\n> Oregon, also pressed Ascent for help. They received responses similar to\n> those the company gave the stressed-out callers looking for pills: Ascent\n> didn\u2019t have any information. Instead, the company directed them to the DEA.\n\n  * 26 Comments\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS Feed\n\n  * print\n\n## Comments\n\n### Ted Craig\n\n2024-04-15 08:54:10\n\n3| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nOpioids are the new crack. In both cases, a boom in the use of a certain drug\ncaused serious and legitimate problems. However, the attempts to solve these\nproblems became politicized, creating new problems.\n\nRespond\n\n### OldCurmudgeon\n\n2024-04-15 09:47:40\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nYes, though I'd tend to model it as a mass hysteria phenomena* That model fits\nbetter with the bizarre response to the actual violations i.e., shutting down\nthe line, thereby harming patients(!), for mere paperwork violations?? Insane.\nSomething like that should be enforced via large fines. Or for particularly\nsevere and/or willful violations, jail time for the company executives.\n\n*I don't see any politican being \"for\" the opioid epidemic. Moreover, unlike the crack epidemic, I don't even see any politican showing sympathy for these victims. Instead, political competition is over who is tougher on the evil-doers.\n\nRespond\n\n### SB\n\n2024-04-15 08:34:13\n\n7| 10  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nEh. The adderall shortage is probably welfare enhancing for society. It\u2019s over\nproscribed and ineffective over time anyway.\n\nRespond\n\n### Ben\n\n2024-04-15 08:44:13\n\n10| 5  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nBased on Alex's worldview, this is impossible. Adderall users are all\nperfectly rational consumers optimizing their demand to maximise their\nutility.\n\nRespond\n\n### Ted Craig\n\n2024-04-15 08:47:22\n\n6| 3  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nTell that to someone who actually has ADHD.\n\nRespond\n\n### Faze\n\n2024-04-15 08:55:49\n\n6| 3  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nDoes anyone actually have ADHD? Has that been settled? Not long ago, ADHD was\nconsidered the opportunistic invention of drug makers, psychiatrists and\neducators. Now we take it for granted that it\u2019s real, life-disrupting\ncondition that millions of people need to be popping speed for. What are the\nmeasurable results?\n\nRespond\n\n### Anti-Gnostic\n\n2024-04-15 09:14:31\n\n1| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nThe measurable results appear to be more diagnoses for more medications.

In\nfact, many people likely go undiagnosed because they or their parents don\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019s a real condition.\n\nRespond\n\n### Sb\n\n2024-04-15 09:02:32\n\n2| 5  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nlol, thanks for the laugh. There is literally no one going undiagnosed. And\nany one who has it quickly grows tolerant of adder all. It\u2019s a bad medicine.\n\nRespond\n\n### jefferson\n\n2024-04-15 08:50:13\n\n3| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nAs Alex said\n\n\"Maybe you think Adderall is overprescribed.

It\u2019s not something we have to get as worked\nup about as AT. Also, is the DEA making policy here? Or just enforcing the\nrule? How about polling makers make a law that firms can violate a couple\nrules as long as they are minor?\n\nRespond\n\n### Laro Deev\n\n2024-04-15 08:50:47\n\n1| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nI would not be crying over shortages of one legal mixture of amphetamine slats\nprescribed in millions to overreacting population. Btw psilocybin shows some\npromising results as a replacement drug, but of course is not something that\nFDA would easily approve...\n\nRespond\n\n### rayward\n\n2024-04-15 08:26:08\n\n5| 19  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nTabarrok demonizes the FDA (and now the DEA) because the pharmaceutical\nindustry is full of criminals and profiteers. It's like Trump demonizing the\nFBI because Trump and many of his supporters are criminals and profiteers. The\npharmaceutical industry and Trump still have high priced lawyers who haven't\nbeen or face being disbarred. Let them do the demonizing. That's what they are\npaid for. Tabarrok is too nice a guy for the role.\n\nRespond\n\n### jayson\n\n2024-04-15 08:49:07\n\n1| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nFYI, Trump isn't the President any more.\n\nRespond\n\n### Snrad\n\n2024-04-15 07:58:58\n\n7| 31  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nSomeone who knows what he's talking about should be along shortly to blow up\nthis post\u2014that's usually how it goes.\n\nRespond\n\n### joePat\n\n2024-04-15 08:08:46\n\n9| 33  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nThere are shortage of drugs because American healthcare is too socialist (!)\nis some hot take. (\u201c... the pattern fits\u201d... don\u2019t they teach about\ncorrelation versus causation in American economics programs these days?)\n\nAlso how do you therefore explain recent shortages in everything from\nmicrochips to raw materials for foods all over the world? Is that cuz\nsocialism too?\n\nRespond\n\n### Slocum\n\n2024-04-15 08:28:08\n\n10| 7  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nMany shortages were caused by Covid-related bottlenecks (also largely\ngovernment created. When government forcibly shutters businesses, shortages\ntend to result -- shocking, I know). Food shortages, on the other hand, have\nbeen caused by wars that disrupted both production and shipping. And yes, US\ndrug production is *highly regulated* and in no way resembles laissez faire\nfree markets.\n\nRespond\n\n### blue jay\n\n2024-04-15 08:26:04\n\n5| 8  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\n\"Is that cuz socialism too?\"\n\nWho shut down the ports during covid?? Biden and Xi, right?\n\nAnd OMG on raw materials: in the US it's almost impossible to open a mine or\ncut down a tree outside of Nevada because of gov regs. A key reason shale oil\nbecame a thing is because - much to Obama's and Democrats' frustration - much\nof it was on private land outside direct government control, so they weren't\nable to crush it through the regulatory apparatus.\n\nBut hey joe, if you're a little short on cash just file for a permit to build\nan amazing indoor wind farm or a mid-ocean solar plant. The Feds are great at\nhanding out money for that kind of thing.\n\nRespond\n\n### jayson\n\n2024-04-15 07:55:24\n\n2| 29  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nBoth extensions of the Executive Branch.

It doesn\u2019t work. A\ncancer treatment brought in $500 million. That one turned out to have no\neffect on survival. A blood cancer medication made nearly $850 million before\nbeing withdrawn for two of its uses. That drug had been linked to patient\ndeaths years prior.\n\nAll of them were allowed to be sold to Americans because of the US Food and\nDrug Administration\u2019s drive to get new drugs to patients quickly \u2014 sometimes\neven before they\u2019re done testing.\"\n\nRespond\n\n### OldCurmudgeon\n\n2024-04-15 09:55:26\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nIn fairness, Big Medicine is* the real check on Big Pharma, not Big\nGovernment.\n\n*OK, you can find a licensed doctor to write an Rx for just about anything. But, if you seek that drug dealer out, that's largely on you.\n\nRespond\n\n### TMC\n\n2024-04-15 08:20:41\n\n1| 10  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nYou're suggesting Adderall doesn't work?\n\nRespond\n\n### blue jay\n\n2024-04-15 08:14:42\n\n6| 16  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\n...because many people with these diseases are begging for the drugs init?? Go\ninto any supplements store and you'll find people voluntarily paying lots of\nmoney for things that have no proof of efficacy. People have beliefs, and they\nact on them.\n\nJust ask my sisters. They're both full of ideas about what works for\neverything from weight loss to stress. One of them was promoting \"grounding\" a\nfew months back, but I guess my sciency take on that at least deterred her\nfrom talking to me about it.\n\nCompanies fill demand, they don't make it.\n\nRespond\n\n### blue jay\n\n2024-04-15 08:20:19\n\n20| 11  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nMy other sister - much overweight - was promoting the consumption of nuts, as\nper her nutritionist. Nuts may have lots of wonderful oils in them, but that's\na problem as much as it is a benefit - if you eat more than a small handful a\nday you'll be a fat cow, nutritionist be damned - they are one of the most\ncalorie-rich foods you can eat. Not surprisingly my sister isn't losing\nweight.\n\nThe FDA publishes a great book of nutritional guidelines: it's 250 pages\nlong!! Hilarious, who's going to read a PhD thesis to (supposedl) learn how to\neat? My bet is that that book is 90% bullshit and 10% fact. The FDA are at\nleast as a big of retards as any company pedalling drugs.\n\nRespond\n\n### Neurotic\n\n2024-04-15 07:43:03\n\n7| 35  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nShouldn't we be dubious about 3rd party claims about THE reason for a law\nenforcement agency's actions? It could very well be that the DEA shut down a\nmultimillion dollar factory because of two minor errors out of, say thousands.\nIt might be corruption - maybe some agents are getting compensated by black\nmarketeers. Or it could be they're 'going after this particular company\nbecause there's evidence of more serious illegal activity. Surely, AT doesn't\nexpect the to disclose what the target of their investigation is - prior to\nthe arrests. Maybe it is sheer incompetence, but maybe it's not. I'd expect\nthe owners to be enlisting the help of their congressman/woman if they're\ninnocent victims of government overreach. But who knows what the real story\nis. AT's story doesn't seem very likely, but I've not dug into the details, so\nmaybe it is.\n\nRespond\n\nRespond\n\n### Marginal Revolution University\n\nSee Courses\n\n### Learn more about Mercatus Center Fellowships\n\nLearn More\n\n### Subscribe via Email\n\n  * RSS Feed\n\n## Contact Us\n\nAlex Tabarrok Email Alex Follow @atabarrok\n\nTyler Cowen Email Tyler Follow @tylercowen\n\nWebmaster Report an issue\n\n  * Blogs We Like\n  * Interesting People & Sites\n\n## Our Web Pages\n\n  * Alex Tabarrok's Home Page\n  * Alex's TED talk, how ideas trump crises\n  * Conversations with Tyler\n  * FDAReview.org\n  * Tyler Cowen's Personal Web Page\n  * Tyler's ethnic dining guide\n  * Apply to Emergent Ventures\n\n## Books\n\n### Modern Principles of Economics\n\nTyler Cowen & Alexander Tabarrok\n\nMarginal Revolution 2024\n\n  * About Marginal Revolution\n  * Categories\n  * Date Archives\n  * Our Books\n  * Our Textbook: Modern Principles of Economics\n  * Marginal Revolution University\n  *     * Facebook\n    * Twitter\n    * RSS Feed\n  * ### Marginal Revolution University\n\nSee Courses\n\nPrivacy Policy Marginal Revolution 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
