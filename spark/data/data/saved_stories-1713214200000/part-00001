From Cinco de Mayo to National Sun Awareness Week to National\nPhotography Month, businesses have many chances to exercise their creativity\nin email channels. If you lack ideas, you may start pushing summer products,\nget connected with Star Wars fans, and show your support for Mental Health\nAwareness Month. Here are some hints on how you can do that.\n\n### Pre-Summer Campaigns\n\nSummer is approaching: its hot breath is in the air. With such good weather,\nshopping might be the last thing on a customer\u2019s mind. But who does not like\nto treat themselves with season-appropriate goods? There is a strong sense of\nanticipation of good times coming. Late May is the perfect time to capitalize\non this interest with a spot-on email marketing campaign.\n\nLow-Code Website Builders\n\nWith Startup App and Slides App you can build unlimited websites using the\nonline website editor which includes ready-made designed and coded elements,\ntemplates and themes.\n\nTry Startup App Try Slides AppOther Products\n\nRunning pre-summer email campaigns is a great way to increase the excitement\nlevels of your target audience, promote your products to match the crowd\u2019s\nmoods, attract potential customers, and reconnect with existing clients.\nHowever, it is important not to overdo it.\n\nSo, how do you play safe? Kick off your marketing strategy by launching a\nsummer product collection preview. Introduce products that resonate with\nsummer vibes to build anticipation among your customer base. You may offer an\nearly-bird discount to maximize impact and heighten excitement.\n\nAlternatively, you may use this campaign to collect some feedback from your\nclients. This real-life insight helps you define the most appealing products\nand what to push during your summer campaigns, giving you a knowledgeable base\nfor June email marketing campaigns.\n\nWhen advising marketing strategy for the end of May, following the best\npractices in the niche is crucial. Analyze customer\u2019s purchasing history to\nsegment your list accurately. Define the right time and cadence to reach your\nsubscribers with a hyper-personalized email. Do not push it with too many\nnewsletters. Start with one letter and a follow-up to see how it goes.\n\n### Star Wars Day\n\nYou might not be a big fan of George Lukas\u2019s epic space opera media franchise,\nbut 102 million U.S. citizens are. According to recent studies, the Star Wars\nfandom exceeds hundreds of millions across the Globe. Each year, it generates\na big fuss in social media, especially during the official Star Wars Day,\nwhich is the 4th of May.\n\nAs practice shows, even if your products do not relate to the franchise or\nfilm industry, there is always a way to join the cultural Zeitgeist. For\nexample, last year, Scholastic\u2019s email newsletter helped customers \u201cTurn Your\nChild Into a Reading Jedi\u201d with a range of popular books in their first May\ndigital blast. In contrast, Target generated excitement with their special\noffers presented under the email entitled \u201cStar Wars Fans: May the deals be\nwith you.\u201d\n\nSo, regardless of niche, you could use this golden opportunity to connect with\nyour target audience, drive engagement, and generate conversions.\n\nHere are some good ideas for creating forceful Star Wars emails:\n\n  * Showcase Star Wars-themed products. Even if your business is unrelated to the franchise, you may wrap your products in the corresponding decorations or work them into a saga-inspired environment.\n  * Align your products with the Star Wars brand. The latter has its own color scheme, theme, and recognizable elements. You may easily find products that perfectly complement them; for example, a pair of black boots perfectly matches Darth Vader\u2019s iconic black robe.\n  * Spread your benevolence and wisdom through helpful listicles and guides.\n  * Encourage subscribers to show off their fanboy.\n  * Let your fan side shine through mind-blowing interactive emails and gamification. Use Postcards email builder to create an engaging experience without much effort.\n\nPlan your tactic wisely to play to your strength, and may force be with you.\n\nStar Wars-themed email from MeUndies\n\n### Support Mental Health Awareness\n\nDo you know that the mental health industry will reach over $500 billion in\n2030? The market is experiencing significant growth as people are more\nconcerned about their mental well-being than ever. This trend impacts all\nindustries because customers prefer brands with social responsibilities and a\nstrong focus on providing a stress-free environment.\n\nWith Mental Health Awareness Month, which started in the 1950s and became\nrelevant to a huge population, May is a great period to try meaningful\ninitiatives in this direction.\n\nTo join the movement, you may launch a thoughtful campaign to support your\ncommunity members. But do not go to an extreme. This subject is sensitive.\nPushing too hard may make you sound cynical. Stay on the safe side and\napproach the issue sensitively and authentically. Here are some ideas to try:\n\n  * Share helpful resources\n  * Raise awareness with statistics and facts\n  * Collaborate with mental health professionals or advocates\n  * Engage subscribers in an online discussion\n  * Offer products where a portion of the revenue goes to mental health charities and organizations\n\nChoose a solution that relates to the products or services you sell. Show your\nunderstanding and promote empathy across your audience. Create a safe space,\nmaintain a respectful tone, and get the message right for your subscribers.\n\nMental Health Awareness-themed email from AllTrails\n\n## High-Converting Newsletter Ideas to Try in May\n\nMay is rich in small opportunities to engage your audience. However, if you\nwant to focus on only several occasions, you should center your strategy\naround International Labor Day, Mother\u2019s Day, and Memorial Day. Spread across\nthe month, these three provide a solid base to maintain a consistent dialogue\nand presence in the channel.\n\n### International Labor Day\n\nInternational Labor Day is celebrated annually on the first day of May and is\nrecognized by many countries worldwide. It is popular not only with European\nUnion members, where it is the date of the European spring festival of May Day\nand an official day off, but also in England, Australia, China, Japan, and\nnumerous countries in Africa and South America.\n\nAs an international event that honors working classes across the Globe, it can\nalso be a perfect excuse to connect with your customers in the United States\nand Canada, showing a united front and raising awareness of this important\ndate.\n\nThere are many tactics to try during this holiday. Perhaps one of the safest\nand most popular is celebrating your customers. The majority of them are hard\nworkers. Use an email channel to recognize their achievements. You may create\na special offer for your subscribers to encourage them to proceed with their\nwork and careers.\n\nAlternatively, you may praise your employees and send a digital newsletter\nfeaturing people who stand behind your brand, thereby humanizing your company\nand revealing its inner working culture.\n\nAnother good tactic is to raise awareness of this event. After all, it\ncommemorates the movement that has given us the 40-hour workweek, child labor\nlaws, and labor unions that fight for working-class rights till these days.\nPlus, it salutes a general strike in the United States on May 1, 1886.\nTherefore, you can reach out to your U.S. subscribers and overseas audiences\nto inform them about this important date.\n\nAmong other email marketing ideas that you can realize this day are:\n\n  * Tap into the patriotic spirit of the nation. It may give some great advantages over others. Create a patriotic theme and bring everyone into a festive mood. Make a selection of items in national flag colors or decorate email with symbols.\n  * Go for an oldie-but-goodie promo discount. Try this approach to break the ice with newcomers or lapsed customers.\n  * Kick off the summer season with a guide, helpful listicle, or recommended products. After all, the first day of May marks the opening of the beach season for some countries and U.S. states. Use this email to build anticipation for approaching sunshine-filled days created for picnics and outings.\n\nLabor Day email from Masterclass\n\n### Mother\u2019s Day\n\nMother\u2019s Day is one of the most important events in May. Celebrated on the\nsecond Sunday of the month, it honors all the love, care, and sacrifices\nmothers make for us.\n\nThe tendency shows that we have become more thoughtful about motherhood and\nwhat it means to different people. We are more sensitive to issues concerning\nrelationships with mothers and being a mom than ever before, supporting this\nholiday not just in words. Last year, Americans spent over $35 billion on\nMother\u2019s Day, proving that they take this holiday seriously and are ready to\nspend money on their beloved parent.\n\nThis opens a great opportunity for businesses across niches to connect with\nthe audience personally, humanize the brand, foster loyalty, and drive\nconversions. To make it right, it is crucial to strike the right emotional\nnote and find the balance between being helpful and promotional.\n\nHere are a few Mother\u2019s Day newsletter ideas to inspire and set you on the\nright path.\n\n#### Create personalized gift guides or recommendations.\n\nMother\u2019s Day is about showing your care and respect for mom\u2019s important place\nin your life. It is a special occasion that calls for thoughtful gifts. Help\nyour customers cut out the searching process and decision-making by\nrecommending products that make good Mother\u2019s Day presents.\n\n#### Inform about the benefits of using your product.\n\nIf you want to avoid direct selling but still promote your products, you may\ncenter your Mother\u2019s Day email around the benefits of using your service.\nExplain why your product makes a good gift for mom by showing its advantages\nand real use-case scenarios. This way, you will help your customers match a\nproduct with someone they want to honor.\n\n#### Establish an emotional connection.\n\nMother\u2019s Day is a perfect opportunity to connect with your audience personally\nand strengthen your bonds. Create a campaign to recognize their massive\ncontributions to society and celebrate them for all they do. You may share\ninspiring stories, create heartwarming congratulations, or feature\ntestimonials demonstrating how your product helps moms in your community.\nInviting your employees into discussion and asking them to share what\nmotherhood means would also be great.\n\nMother\u2019s Day email from Nanit\n\n### Memorial Day\n\nMemorial Day is a major date on every email marketing calendar. It is a\nfederal holiday celebrated by millions of U.S. citizens. It commemorates\npersonnel who served and died in the United States Armored Forces and honors\nveterans and military families.\n\nIn addition, it is considered the unofficial beginning of summer. Studies show\nthat people use this long weekend not only to place American flags on the\ngraves of military personnel but also to do some shopping, celebrate everyone\ninvolved directly and indirectly, and have quality time together outside.\n\nThat makes this event a unique opportunity to connect with customers, show\nappreciation for the brave men and women who have fought for the country, and\nunobtrusively remind the audience about your brand. With meaningful and\nthoughtful emails, you may show your loyal customers that you care about\ncommunity members more than just making a sale.\n\nHere are several good ideas for joining in on the event and ending the last\nspring month on a positive note.\n\n#### Capitalize on the spirit of American pride.\n\nAmerican heroes who served their country are the beating heart of this holiday\nweekend. Patriotism runs high. Use this feeling to market your brand\neffectively. Tap into the patriotic essence and bring everyone to the same\nmood.\n\nTurn your digital blast into a thank-you note to express gratitude for the\nsacrifices. Introduce colors and imagery that symbolize freedom and honor.\nThis will align your brand with the values associated with this holiday and\nmake your product more relatable to the target audience.\n\n#### Introduce the offer as a thank-you note.\n\nMemorial Day sees lots of promotional newsletters. Savings play in hand these\ndays. Plus, they meet customers eager to spend money on the last week of\nspring. Therefore, many companies run fully-fledged sale campaigns with\ndiscounts and special offers.\n\nHowever, to avoid sounding cynical, introduce your offer as a thank-you note.\nUse email design to assist you in this matter. For instance, stick to typical\nred, white, and blue coloring or feature the American flag and symbolism.\nAlso, remember to add some heartwarming congratulations to ring in an overall\nfestive atmosphere.\n\n#### Create a heartwarming Memorial Day message.\n\nSuppose you want to avoid promotional newsletters this day or do not intend to\nhold a sale. In that case, you can always create a heartwarming Memorial Day\nmessage and remind your subscribers of the holiday\u2019s true nature. This might\nnot generate sales or drive traffic, but it will certainly strengthen your\nbrand image and position in the market.\n\n#### Bring summer vibes.\n\nFor many people, Memorial Day is associated with the start of summer. As an\nunofficial kickoff to the beloved vacation season in the United States, it\nwitnesses people getting outdoors, firing up the barbecue, and buying season-\nrelated goods. Pick up on these habits to connect with the audience and\npromote your products unobtrusively. Tailor your email campaign along with\nsummer vibes and themes.\n\nPool parties, barbecues with family and friends, beach trips, traveling, and\nadventure\u2014choose a topic relevant to your niche and create an atmosphere of\nwarm, sunny days ahead.\n\nMemorial Day email from Simmons\n\n## Subject Line Ideas for May Newsletters\n\nAs the last month of the season, May foresees summer.

It facilitates the\nacquisition of information by providing a visual representation of the key\nmessage and mission of the campaign. It makes understanding and comprehension\nof the data seamless and unobtrusive. Plus, as customers are visual learners\nwho do not have much time for reading unless they are intrigued, it allows\ncompanies to deliver the key message.\n\nChoosing the right coloring, typeface, and graphics has numerous benefits.\nHowever, the most important advantages lie in drawing attention to critical\ndetails, driving engagement, and supporting the overall tone and language of\nthe campaign. That drastically amplifies marketing efforts. Let\u2019s consider\nwhat colors, typefaces, and themes you could use in May to facilitate your\nemail marketing campaign and boost customer dialogue.\n\n### Color\n\nMay parades blooming flowers: hawthorn, lily of the valley, and peonies.\nNature is fully awakened\u2014green trees, bushes, and grass surround us. Such a\npicturesque backdrop gives way to many gorgeous color schemes that complement\nthe natural hues.\n\nTraditional May color schemes brim with vitality and vibrancy. They are\nlavish, energizing, playful, and positive. From trivial green to ultra-modern\nbeetroot magenta, you can let your imagination run wild and make the whole\nriot of colors work for you. Pink, red, rose, yellow, orange, purple, blue,\ngreen, and lime easily work for you.\n\nIn addition, along with focusing on spring motifs and colors found in the\nlandscape, you may also get inspiration from the wedding season since it is\nabout to start. Calming blue, adorable yellow, bright pink palettes with\ntouches of orange and timeless shades of white, there is another area to\nexplore.\n\nIt is crucial to note that if you are not ready to commit to the hue alone,\nyou may always consider pairing it with other complementary colors. For\nexample, modern options like Beetroot Purple, which can be overwhelming on\nitself, play beautifully with navy blue, white, and metallics, giving designs\na powerful, trendy feeling.\n\nMay color scheme from Color-hex\n\n### Typeface\n\nMay typefaces allow you to sense the warm season in every stroke, curve, and\nline. They give off a refreshing vibe and immediately put everyone in a good\nmood. As a rule, details like refined curls, loops, and rounded edges betray\nthe season spirit.\n\nThe range is diverse. You can choose elegant, hand-written scripts that exude\nthe subtlety and beauty of young nature or adopt custom versions with cute\nspring details like flowers and butterflies inside the letters. You may even\nexploit a quirky side of the brand\u2019s personality and introduce an eccentric\ntypeface with small, intentional, yet adorable imperfections.\n\nThose who create holiday campaigns should focus on themed typefaces. For\nexample, the best font for a Mother\u2019s Day email conveys love. It could be a\nhand-written font with heart-shaped letterforms or a time-honored elegant\noption. In contrast, the best font for Memorial Day should convey seriousness,\nso you might go for typefaces with strong masculine vibes and classic or bold\nletterforms, like Roman and Vivaldi.\n\nMay typeface from Designcuts\n\n### Motifs\n\nIn May, nature invites us into its lavish kingdom to enjoy quality time\ntogether. Spring is in full swing, so popular themes for email designs often\ninclude flowers, blossoms, plants, trees, landscapes, and outdoor activities.\nIn addition, the last month of the season heralds summertime, so you are\nwelcome to add hints about the approaching vacation, family and friends\ngatherings, and school break.\n\nMay\u2019s email designs feature numerous decorations to highlight special\noccasions and put everyone in a celebratory mood. Events such as Star Wars\nDay, Cinco De Mayo, Mother\u2019s Day, and Memorial Day dramatically influence the\nvisual side of the newsletter. For instance, at the very beginning of the\nmonth, email designs are built around dark motifs to match the Star Wars\ntheme, whereas, at the end, they burst with patriotic and symbolic graphics.\n\nWith such a diversity of options, it is easy to get confused. The way out is\nto play along with customers\u2019 moods, stay true to the campaign\u2019s goal and\nmission, and be authentic in your visual message. Choose several illustrations\nor photos or adorn your email design with tiny yet eye-catching spring-infused\ngraphical elements.\n\nMay graphics and motifs\n\n## May Email Newsletter Examples\n\nEmail from JCrew\n\nMuch like May, an email from JCrew is a true spring digital newsletter that a\ncompany from any niche could adopt. It radiates the period\u2019s warmth,\nrejuvenation, and naturalness right from the doorstep. Even though it embraces\nminimalism with its compact and oversimplified layout, its visual filling is\nenough to impact the recipient and achieve marketing goals.\n\nThe key feature of this design is a powerful combination of decorative and\npromotional sides. You may see how a 30% discount perfectly incorporates into\nan overall nature-infused environment. It just could not help but grab\nattention and put a smile on the customer\u2019s face.\n\nOn the marketing side, the newsletter centers around the sale event. Every\ndetail speaks about that: discount, discount code, time limits, call-to-action\nbutton, and even a small info block. It is presented so beautifully and\nseasonally that readers unobtrusively follow the lead.\n\nMay email from JCrew is an example of a simple yet powerful solution that\ncapitalizes on nature motifs to make promotion organic and unconstrained.\n\nEmail from Headspace\n\nWhile everyone eagerly awaits Mother\u2019s Day, finding the perfect gift could be\na nightmare.

Headspace\u2019s team knows that perfectly well.\n\nThey have used email to address this issue and provide their helping hand to\ntheir beloved customers just in time. Their strategy is not something new.\nNevertheless, it works because it meets the crowd\u2019s current needs and proves\nthat the brand knows its customers well.\n\nThe email is split into two parts. As expected, the first block is dedicated\nto a huge holiday announcement and encouragement to honor our beloved moms.\nThe team effortlessly draws attention to the appeal using the inverted pyramid\nprinciple. A beautiful spring illustration that concludes the hero area\nperfectly aligns the email with the period, making the communication look\nappropriate.\n\nThe second part is more informative than the first one. It was introduced to\naddress an issue with gift-giving and cut out the decision-making process by\nproviding valid advice. It concludes with the call-to-action button and\nanother mention of a 20% discount to strengthen the key message.\n\nThe overall illustrative approach makes the email so eye-pleasing and\nbeautiful that it turns a promo into a feast for the eye that leaves a\npositive, long-lasting impression.\n\nEmail from Polaroid\n\nEmail from Polaroid is vivid proof that with a little imagination and\ncreativity, you can make any holiday work in your favor, even when your\nproduct is not aligned with the occasion.

With\ndozens of well-known and unusual-looking characters and props like light\nsabers or Darth Vader masks, companies in any industry may adopt this theme to\ntheir products and campaigns.\n\nPolaroid shows how to do this in practice. Using one of the most successful\nseries in the niche, The Mandalorian, they have managed to grab a piece of\nthis billion-dollar cake and generate conversions and leads for their brand.\n\nThe team has created a compact yet themed digital newsletter. Using an image\nof a recognizable scene and featuring the product\u2019s main mission under Star\nWars sauce, they have successfully introduced it in the movie context. Simple,\nyet ingenious.\n\nEmail from On/Go\n\nFor some people, Memorial Day is an unofficial start of summer and barbecue\nseason; however, for the majority, it is a day to honor those who served and\ncurrently serve the country. This event is a perfect excuse to connect with\nyour subscribers, promote your product, and prove that your brand is an\nintegral community member.\n\nThe On/Go company shows how to do this without sounding cynical. They have\ncreated a campaign to gather their subscribers around this holiday. Their\nappeal is to \u201csupport military families.\u201d It is simple and banal, but it works\nbecause it highlights and celebrates everyone involved by speaking to the\naudience in the same language and aligning with their emotions.\n\nThe email design is well thought out. A big image of a real family brings a\nwarm and personal approach to the discussion. The patriotic theme is\norganically introduced to add festive vibes. Everything here is about the\nholiday. Therefore, the promo code feels like a pleasant bonus and an\nappropriate finishing touch.\n\nEmail from Arc\u2019Teryx\n\nMay is an official start for adventures.

Look at the email from Arc\u2019Teryx, which managed to\ndo that.\n\nThe email is pretty standard in structure and content. It has several\nsections, lots of information, and visuals. The latter is the key feature: it\nbuilds anticipation and encourages everyone to follow the mainstream and jump\ninto outdoor adventures immediately.\n\nFrom the marketing point of view, the team has used this theme to introduce\ntheir products. Even though they might not be perfectly aligned with the\nadventure niche, they still find their place and, most importantly, meet the\ncrowd\u2019s needs and moods, making the blast look timely and appropriate.\n\nEmail Template \u2013 Affiliatoo\n\nIf you do not intend to attach an email campaign to any event during the last\nmonth of the season, here is a good example of a May email that you can use to\nstay holiday-neutral yet season-appropriate.
