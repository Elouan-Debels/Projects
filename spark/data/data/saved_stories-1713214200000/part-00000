It has five elements: three directors (to left) one reflector\n(to right) and a driven element which is a folded dipole (double rod) to match\nthe 300 \u03a9 twin lead feedline. The beam direction (direction of greatest\nsensitivity) is to the left.\n\nA Yagi\u2013Uda antenna, or simply Yagi antenna, is a directional antenna\nconsisting of two or more parallel resonant antenna elements in an end-fire\narray;^[1] these elements are most often metal rods acting as half-wave\ndipoles.^[2] Yagi\u2013Uda antennas consist of a single driven element connected to\na radio transmitter or receiver (or both) through a transmission line, and\nadditional passive radiators with no electrical connection, usually including\none so-called reflector and any number of directors.^[2]^[3]^[4] It was\ninvented in 1926 by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial University, Japan,^[5]\nwith a lesser role played by his boss Hidetsugu Yagi.^[5]^[6]\n\nReflector elements (usually only one is used) are slightly longer than the\ndriven dipole and placed behind the driven element, opposite the direction of\nintended transmission. Directors, on the other hand, are a little shorter and\nplaced in front of the driven element in the intended direction.^[4] These\nparasitic elements are typically off-tuned short-circuited dipole elements,\nthat is, instead of a break at the feedpoint (like the driven element) a solid\nrod is used. They receive and reradiate the radio waves from the driven\nelement but in a different phase determined by their exact lengths. Their\neffect is to modify the driven element's radiation pattern. The waves from the\nmultiple elements superpose and interfere to enhance radiation in a single\ndirection, increasing the antenna's gain in that direction.\n\nAlso called a beam antenna^[4] and parasitic array, the Yagi is very widely\nused as a directional antenna on the HF, VHF and UHF bands.^[3]^[4] It has\nmoderate to high gain of up to 20 dBi,^[3] depending on the number of elements\nused, and a front-to-back ratio of up to 20 dB. It radiates linearly\npolarized^[3] radio waves and is usually mounted for either horizontal or\nvertical polarization. It is relatively lightweight, inexpensive and simple to\nconstruct.^[3] The bandwidth of a Yagi antenna, the frequency range over which\nit maintains its gain and feedpoint impedance, is narrow, just a few percent\nof the center frequency, decreasing for models with higher gain,^[3]^[4]\nmaking it ideal for fixed-frequency applications. The largest and best-known\nuse is as rooftop terrestrial television antennas,^[3] but it is also used for\npoint-to-point fixed communication links,^[2] radar,^[4] and long-distance\nshortwave communication by broadcasting stations and radio amateurs.^[2]\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\nQuartet of two-dipole Yagi arrays (Hirschgeweih) of the German FuG 220 VHF-\nband radar on the nose of a late-World War II Bf 110 night fighter aircraft\n\nThe antenna was invented by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial University,\nJapan,^[5] in 1926, with a lesser role played by Hidetsugu Yagi.^[6]^[7]\n\nHowever, the name Yagi has become more familiar, while the name of Uda, who\napplied the idea in practice or established the conception through experiment,\nis often omitted. This appears to have been due to the fact that Yagi based\nhis work on Uda's pre-announcement^[5] and developed the principle of the\nabsorption phenomenon Yagi had announced earlier.^[8] Yagi filed a patent\napplication in Japan on the new idea, without Uda's name in it, and later\ntransferred the patent to the Marconi Company in the UK.^[9] Incidentally, in\nthe US, the patent was transferred to RCA Corporation.^[10]\n\nYagi antennas were first widely used during World War II in radar systems by\nJapan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.^[7] After the war,\nthey saw extensive development as home television antennas.\n\n## Description[edit]\n\nYagi\u2013Uda antenna with a reflector (left), half-wave driven element (centre),\nand director (right).

Often they are supported\non a perpendicular crossbar or \"boom\" along their centers.^[2] Usually there\nis a single dipole driven element consisting of two collinear rods each\nconnected to one side of the transmission line, and a variable number of\nparasitic elements, reflectors on one side and optionally one or more\ndirectors on the other side.^[2]^[3]^[4] The parasitic elements are not\nelectrically connected to the transmission line and serve as passive\nradiators, reradiating the radio waves to modify the radiation pattern.^[2]\nTypical spacings between elements vary from about 1\u204410 to 1\u20444 of a wavelength,\ndepending on the specific design. The directors are slightly shorter than the\ndriven element, while the reflector(s) are slightly longer.^[4] The radiation\npattern is unidirectional, with the main lobe along the axis perpendicular to\nthe elements in the plane of the elements, off the end with the directors.^[3]\n\nConveniently, the dipole parasitic elements have a node (point of zero RF\nvoltage) at their centre, so they can be attached to a conductive metal\nsupport at that point without need of insulation, without disturbing their\nelectrical operation.^[4] They are usually bolted or welded to the antenna's\ncentral support boom.^[4] The most common form of the driven element is one\nfed at its centre so its two halves must be insulated where the boom supports\nthem.\n\nThe gain increases with the number of parasitic elements used.^[4] Only one\nreflector is normally used since the improvement of gain with additional\nreflectors is small, but more reflectors may be employed for other reasons\nsuch as wider bandwidth. Yagis have been built with up to 40 directors.^[3]\n\nThe bandwidth of an antenna is, by one definition, the width of the band of\nfrequencies having a gain within 3 dB (one-half the power) of its maximum\ngain. The Yagi\u2013Uda array in its basic form has very narrow bandwidth, 2\u20133\npercent of the centre frequency.^[4] There is a tradeoff between gain and\nbandwidth, with the bandwidth narrowing as more elements are used.^[4] For\napplications that require wider bandwidths, such as terrestrial television,\nYagi\u2013Uda antennas commonly feature trigonal reflectors, and larger diameter\nconductors, in order to cover the relevant portions of the VHF and UHF\nbands.^[11] Wider bandwidth can also be achieved by the use of \"traps\", as\ndescribed below.\n\nYagi\u2013Uda antennas used for amateur radio are sometimes designed to operate on\nmultiple bands. These elaborate designs create electrical breaks along each\nelement (both sides) at which point a parallel LC (inductor and capacitor)\ncircuit is inserted. This so-called trap has the effect of truncating the\nelement at the higher frequency band, making it approximately a half\nwavelength in length. At the lower frequency, the entire element (including\nthe remaining inductance due to the trap) is close to half-wave resonance,\nimplementing a different Yagi\u2013Uda antenna. Using a second set of traps, a\n\"triband\" antenna can be resonant at three different bands. Given the\nassociated costs of erecting an antenna and rotator system above a tower, the\ncombination of antennas for three amateur bands in one unit is a very\npractical solution. The use of traps is not without disadvantages, however, as\nthey reduce the bandwidth of the antenna on the individual bands and reduce\nthe antenna's electrical efficiency and subject the antenna to additional\nmechanical considerations (wind loading, water and insect ingress).\n\n## Theory of operation[edit]\n\nA portable Yagi\u2013Uda antenna for use at 144 MHz (2 m), with segments of yellow\ntape-measure ribbon for the arms of the driven and parasitic elements.\n\nConsider a Yagi\u2013Uda consisting of a reflector, driven element and a single\ndirector as shown here. The driven element is typically a 1\u20442\u03bb dipole or\nfolded dipole and is the only member of the structure that is directly excited\n(electrically connected to the feedline). All the other elements are\nconsidered parasitic. That is, they reradiate power which they receive from\nthe driven element. They also interact with each other, but this mutual\ncoupling is neglected in the following simplified explanation, which applies\nto far-field conditions.\n\nOne way of thinking about the operation of such an antenna is to consider a\nparasitic element to be a normal dipole element of finite diameter fed at its\ncentre, with a short circuit across its feed point. The principal part of the\ncurrent in a loaded receiving antenna is distributed as in a center-driven\nantenna. It is proportional to the effective length of the antenna and is in\nphase with the incident electric field if the passive dipole is excited\nexactly at its resonance frequency.^[12] Now we imagine the current as the\nsource of a power wave at the (short-circuited) port of the antenna. As is\nwell known in transmission line theory, a short circuit reflects the incident\nvoltage 180 degrees out of phase. So one could as well model the operation of\nthe parasitic element as the superposition of a dipole element receiving power\nand sending it down a transmission line to a matched load, and a transmitter\nsending the same amount of power up the transmission line back toward the\nantenna element. If the transmitted voltage wave were 180 degrees out of phase\nwith the received wave at that point, the superposition of the two voltage\nwaves would give zero voltage, equivalent to shorting out the dipole at the\nfeedpoint (making it a solid element, as it is). However, the current of the\nbackward wave is in phase with the current of the incident wave. This current\ndrives the reradiation of the (passive) dipole element. At some distance, the\nreradiated electric field is described by the far-field component of the\nradiation field of a dipole antenna. Its phase includes the propagation delay\n(relating to the current) and an additional 90 degrees lagging phase offset.\nThus, the reradiated field may be thought as having a 90 degrees lagging phase\nwith respect to the incident field.\n\nParasitic elements involved in Yagi\u2013Uda antennas are not exactly resonant but\nare somewhat shorter (or longer) than 1\u20442\u03bb so that the phase of the element's\ncurrent is modified with respect to its excitation from the driven element.\nThe so-called reflector element, being longer than 1\u20442\u03bb, has an inductive\nreactance, which means the phase of its current lags the phase of the open-\ncircuit voltage that would be induced by the received field. The phase delay\nis thus larger than 90 degrees and, if the reflector element is made\nsufficiently long, the phase delay may be imagined to approach 180 degrees, so\nthat the incident wave and the wave reemitted by the reflector interfere\ndestructively in the forward direction (i.e. looking from the driven element\ntowards the passive element). The director element, on the other hand, being\nshorter than 1\u20442\u03bb, has a capacitive reactance with the voltage phase lagging\nthat of the current.^[13] The phase delay is thus smaller than 90 degrees and,\nif the director element is made sufficiently short, the phase delay may be\nimagined to approach zero and the incident wave and the wave reemitted by the\nreflector interfere constructively in the forward direction.\n\nInterference also occurs in the backward direction. This interference is\ninfluenced by the distance between the driven and the passive element, because\nthe propagation delays of the incident wave (from the driven element to the\npassive element) and of the reradiated wave (from the passive element back to\nthe driven element) have to be taken into account. To illustrate the effect,\nwe assume zero and 180 degrees phase delay for the reemission of director and\nreflector, respectively, and assume a distance of a quarter wavelength between\nthe driven and the passive element. Under these conditions the wave reemitted\nby the director interferes destructively with the wave emitted by the driven\nelement in the backward direction (away from the passive element), and the\nwave reemitted by the reflector interferes constructively.\n\nIn reality, the phase delay of passive dipole elements does not reach the\nextreme values of zero and 180 degrees. Thus, the elements are given the\ncorrect lengths and spacings so that the radio waves radiated by the driven\nelement and those re-radiated by the parasitic elements all arrive at the\nfront of the antenna in-phase, so they superpose and add, increasing signal\nstrength in the forward direction. In other words, the crest of the forward\nwave from the reflector element reaches the driven element just as the crest\nof the wave is emitted from that element. These waves reach the first director\nelement just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element, and so on.\nThe waves in the reverse direction interfere destructively, cancelling out, so\nthe signal strength radiated in the reverse direction is small. Thus the\nantenna radiates a unidirectional beam of radio waves from the front (director\nend) of the antenna.\n\n## Analysis[edit]\n\nWhile the above qualitative explanation is useful for understanding how\nparasitic elements can enhance the driven elements' radiation in one direction\nat the expense of the other, the assumption of an additional 90 degrees\n(leading or lagging) phase shift of the reemitted wave is not valid.\nTypically, the phase shift in the passive element is much smaller. Moreover,\nto increase the effect of the passive radiators, they should be placed close\nto the driven element, so that they can collect and reemit a significant part\nof the primary radiation.\n\n  * How the antenna works. The radio waves from each element are emitted with a phase delay, so that the individual waves emitted in the forward direction (up) are in phase, while the waves in the reverse direction are out of phase. Therefore, the forward waves add together, (constructive interference) enhancing the power in that direction, while the backward waves partially cancel each other (destructive interference), thereby reducing the power emitted in that direction.\n\n  * Illustration of forward gain of a two element Yagi\u2013Uda array using only a driven element (left) and a director (right). The wave (green) from the driven element excites a current in the passive director which reradiates a wave (blue) having a particular phase shift (see explanation in text, note that the dimensions are not to scale with the numbers in the text). The addition of these waves (bottom) is increased in the forward direction, but leads to partial cancellation in the reverse direction.\n\nA more realistic model of a Yagi\u2013Uda array using just a driven element and a\ndirector is illustrated in the accompanying diagram. The wave generated by the\ndriven element (green) propagates in both the forward and reverse directions\n(as well as other directions, not shown). The director receives that wave\nslightly delayed in time (amounting to a phase delay of about 45\u00b0 which will\nbe important for the reverse direction calculations later). Due to the\ndirector's shorter length, the current generated in the director is advanced\nin phase (by about 20\u00b0) with respect to the incident field and emits an\nelectromagnetic field, which lags (under far-field conditions) this current by\n90\u00b0. The net effect is a wave emitted by the director (blue) which is about\n70\u00b0 (20\u00b0 - 90\u00b0) retarded with respect to that from the driven element (green),\nin this particular design. These waves combine to produce the net forward wave\n(bottom, right) with an amplitude somewhat larger than the individual waves.\n\nIn the reverse direction, on the other hand, the additional delay of the wave\nfrom the director (blue) due to the spacing between the two elements (about\n45\u00b0 of phase delay traversed twice) causes it to be about 160\u00b0 (70\u00b0 + 2 \u00d7 45\u00b0)\nout of phase with the wave from the driven element (green). The net effect of\nthese two waves, when added (bottom, left), is partial cancellation. The\ncombination of the director's position and shorter length has thus obtained a\nunidirectional rather than the bidirectional response of the driven (half-wave\ndipole) element alone.\n\nMutual impedance between parallel dipoles not staggered as a function of\nspacing. Curves Re and Im are the resistive and reactive parts of the mutual\nimpedance. Note that at zero spacing we obtain the self-impedance of a half-\nwave dipole, 73 + j43 \u03a9.\n\nWhen a passive radiator is placed close (less than a quarter wavelength\ndistance) to the driven dipole, it interacts with the near field, in which the\nphase-to-distance relation is not governed by propagation delay, as would be\nthe case in the far field. Thus, the amplitude and phase relation between the\ndriven and the passive element cannot be understood with a model of successive\ncollection and reemission of a wave that has become completely disconnected\nfrom the primary radiating element. Instead, the two antenna elements form a\ncoupled system, in which, for example, the self-impedance (or radiation\nresistance) of the driven element is strongly influenced by the passive\nelement. A full analysis of such a system requires computing the mutual\nimpedances between the dipole elements^[14] which implicitly takes into\naccount the propagation delay due to the finite spacing between elements and\nnear-field coupling effects. We model element number j as having a feedpoint\nat the centre with a voltage V_j and a current I_j flowing into it. Just\nconsidering two such elements we can write the voltage at each feedpoint in\nterms of the currents using the mutual impedances Z_ij:\n\nZ_11 and Z_22 are simply the ordinary driving point impedances of a dipole,\nthus 73 + j43 ohms for a half-wave element (or purely resistive for one\nslightly shorter, as is usually desired for the driven element). Due to the\ndifferences in the elements' lengths Z_11 and Z_22 have a substantially\ndifferent reactive component. Due to reciprocity we know that Z_21 = Z_12. Now\nthe difficult computation is in determining that mutual impedance Z_21 which\nrequires a numerical solution. This has been computed for two exact half-wave\ndipole elements at various spacings in the accompanying graph.\n\nThe solution of the system then is as follows. Let the driven element be\ndesignated 1 so that V_1 and I_1 are the voltage and current supplied by the\ntransmitter. The parasitic element is designated 2, and since it is shorted at\nits \"feedpoint\" we can write that V_2 = 0. Using the above relationships,\nthen, we can solve for I_2 in terms of I_1:\n\nand so\n\n    .\n\nThis is the current induced in the parasitic element due to the current I_1 in\nthe driven element. We can also solve for the voltage V_1 at the feedpoint of\nthe driven element using the earlier equation:\n\nwhere we have substituted Z_12 = Z_21. The ratio of voltage to current at this\npoint is the driving point impedance Z_dp of the 2-element Yagi:\n\nWith only the driven element present the driving point impedance would have\nsimply been Z_11, but has now been modified by the presence of the parasitic\nelement. And now knowing the phase (and amplitude) of I_2 in relation to I_1\nas computed above allows us to determine the radiation pattern (gain as a\nfunction of direction) due to the currents flowing in these two elements.\nSolution of such an antenna with more than two elements proceeds along the\nsame lines, setting each V_j = 0 for all but the driven element, and solving\nfor the currents in each element (and the voltage V_1 at the feedpoint).^[15]\nGenerally the mutual coupling tends to lower the impedance of the primary\nradiator and thus, folded dipole antennas are frequently used because of their\nlarge radiation resistance, which is reduced to the typical 50 to 75 Ohm range\nby coupling with the passive elements.\n\nTwo Yagi\u2013Uda antennas on a single mast. The top one includes a corner\nreflector and three stacked Yagis fed in phase in order to increase gain in\nthe horizontal direction (by cancelling power radiated toward the ground or\nsky). The lower antenna is oriented for vertical polarization, with a much\nlower resonant frequency.\n\n## Design[edit]\n\nThere are no simple formulas for designing Yagi\u2013Uda antennas due to the\ncomplex relationships between physical parameters such as\n\n  * element length and spacing\n  * element diameter\n  * performance characteristics: gain and input impedance\n\nHowever using the above kinds of iterative analysis, one can calculate the\nperformance of a given a set of parameters and adjust them to optimize the\ngain (perhaps subject to some constraints). Since with an n element Yagi\u2013Uda\nantenna, there are 2n \u2212 1 parameters to adjust (the element lengths and\nrelative spacings), this iterative analysis method is not straightforward. The\nmutual impedances plotted above only apply to \u03bb/2 length elements, so these\nmight need to be recomputed to get good accuracy.\n\nThe current distribution along a real antenna element is only approximately\ngiven by the usual assumption of a classical standing wave, requiring a\nsolution of Hallen's integral equation taking into account the other\nconductors. Such a complete exact analysis, considering all of the\ninteractions mentioned, is rather overwhelming, and approximations are\ninevitable on the path to finding a usable antenna. Consequently, these\nantennas are often empirical designs using an element of trial and error,\noften starting with an existing design modified according to one's hunch. The\nresult might be checked by direct measurement or by computer simulation.\n\nA well-known reference employed in the latter approach is a report published\nby the United States National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (now the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) that provides six basic designs\nderived from measurements conducted at 400 MHz and procedures for adapting\nthese designs to other frequencies.^[16] These designs, and those derived from\nthem, are sometimes referred to as \"NBS yagis.\"\n\nBy adjusting the distance between the adjacent directors it is possible to\nreduce the back lobe of the radiation pattern.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe Yagi\u2013Uda antenna was invented in 1926 by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial\nUniversity,^[5] Sendai, Japan, with the guidance of Hidetsugu Yagi, also of\nTohoku Imperial University.^[6] Yagi and Uda published their first report on\nthe wave projector directional antenna. Yagi demonstrated a proof of concept,\nbut the engineering problems proved to be more onerous than conventional\nsystems.^[17]\n\nYagi published the first English-language reference on the antenna in a 1928\nsurvey article on short wave research in Japan and it came to be associated\nwith his name. However, Yagi who provided the conception which was originally\nvague expression to Uda, always acknowledged Uda's principal contribution\ntowards the design which will currently be recognized as the reduction to\npractice, and if the novelty is not considered, the proper name for the\nantenna is, as above, the Yagi\u2013Uda antenna (or array).\n\nA Nakajima J1N1-S night fighter with quadruple Yagi radar transceiver antennas\n\nThe Yagi was first widely used during World War II for airborne radar sets,\nbecause of its simplicity and directionality.^[17]^[18] Despite its being\ninvented in Japan, many Japanese radar engineers were unaware of the design\nuntil very late in the war, partly due to rivalry between the Army and Navy.\nThe Japanese military authorities first became aware of this technology after\nthe Battle of Singapore when they captured the notes of a British radar\ntechnician that mentioned \"yagi antenna\". Japanese intelligence officers did\nnot even recognise that Yagi was a Japanese name in this context. When\nquestioned, the technician said it was an antenna named after a Japanese\nprofessor.^[19]^[20]^[N 1]\n\nClose-up of Yagi arrays of the ASV Mark II radar fitted beneath a Bristol\nBeaufort aircraft for anti-submarine warfare\n\nA horizontally polarized array can be seen on many different types of WWII\naircraft, particularly those types engaged in maritime patrol, or night\nfighters, commonly installed on the lower surface of each wing. Two types that\noften carried such equipment are the Grumman TBF Avenger carrier-based US Navy\naircraft and the Consolidated PBY Catalina long range patrol seaplane.\nVertically polarized arrays can be seen on the cheeks of the P-61 and on the\nnose cones of many WWII aircraft, notably the Lichtenstein radar-equipped\nexamples of the German Junkers Ju 88R-1 fighter-bomber, and the British\nBristol Beaufighter night-fighter and Short Sunderland flying-boat. Indeed,\nthe latter had so many antenna elements arranged on its back \u2013 in addition to\nits formidable turreted defensive armament in the nose and tail, and atop the\nhull \u2013 it was nicknamed the fliegendes Stachelschwein, or \"Flying Porcupine\"\nby German airmen.^[21] The experimental Morgenstern German AI VHF-band radar\nantenna of 1943\u201344 used a \"double-Yagi\" structure from its 90\u00b0 angled pairs of\nYagi antennas formed from six discrete dipole elements, making it possible to\nfit the array within a conical, rubber-covered plywood radome on an aircraft's\nnose, with the extreme tips of the Morgenstern's antenna elements protruding\nfrom the radome's surface, with an NJG 4 Ju 88G-6 of the wing's staff flight\nusing it late in the war for its Lichtenstein SN-2 AI radar.^[22]\n\nA three-element Yagi\u2013Uda antenna used for long-distance (skywave)\ncommunication in the shortwave bands by an amateur radio station. The longer\nreflector element (left), the driven element (centre), and the shorter\ndirector (right) each have a so-called trap (parallel LC circuit) inserted\nalong their conductors on each side, allowing the antenna to be used on more\nthan one frequency band.\n\nAfter World War 2, the advent of television broadcasting motivated extensive\nadaptation of the Yagi\u2013Uda design for rooftop television reception in the VHF\nband (and later for UHF television) and also as an FM radio antenna in fringe\nareas. A major drawback was the Yagi's inherently narrow bandwidth, eventually\nsolved by the adoption of the very wideband log-periodic dipole array (LPDA).\nYet the Yagi's higher gain compared to the LPDA makes it still required for\nthe best fringe reception, and very complicated Yagi designs and combination\nwith other antenna technologies have been developed to permit its operation\nover the broad television bands.\n\nThe Yagi\u2013Uda antenna was named an IEEE Milestone in 1995.^[10]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Antenna (radio)\n  * Antenna array\n  * Numerical Electromagnetics Code\n  * Radio direction finder\n  * Radio direction finding\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ This story is analogous to the story of American intelligence officers interrogating German rocket scientists and finding out that Robert Goddard was the real pioneer of rocket technology even though he was not well known in the US at that time.\n\n## References[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n  1. ^ Graf, Rudolf F.
