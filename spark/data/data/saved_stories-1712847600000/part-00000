From the recordings, which were shared by an employee of the Mark\nZuckerberg-owned company that owns Facebook and Instagram, the New York Times\nfound that staff had discussed buying Simon & Schuster and some had debated\npaying $10 per book for the licensing rights to new titles.\n\nSimon & Schuster is one of the English-speaking world\u2019s major book publishing\nhouses and is part of what is referred to as the \u201cBig Five\u201d, along with\nPenguin Random House, HarperCollins, Hachette and Macmillan. Simon &\nSchuster\u2019s authors include Stephen King, Colleen Hoover and Bob Woodward.\n\nIn March 2020, Paramount Global, the parent company of Simon & Schuster,\nannounced its intention to sell the publisher. After a much-criticised planned\nmerger with Penguin Random House was blocked by US courts, Simon & Schuster\nwas eventually sold to private equity firm KKR in August 2023.\n\nAccording to the recordings, Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta\u2019s vice president of\ngenerative AI, told executives that the company had used almost every book,\npoem and essay written in English available on the internet to train models,\nso was looking for new sources of training material.\n\nEmployees said they had used these text sources without permission and talked\nabout using more, even if that would result in lawsuits. When a lawyer flagged\n\u201cethical\u201d concerns about using intellectual property, they were met with\nsilence.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Bookmarks\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.\nLiterary delights delivered direct you\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Chhabria cast doubt on the argument that the models\u2019 outputs resemble\nthe authors\u2019 works.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Books\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Meta\n  * Publishing\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
