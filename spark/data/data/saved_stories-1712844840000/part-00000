There\u2019s been a long\nhistory of harsh words, accusations, insults, shouting, slammed doors,\nresentments and aggressive silences.\n\nIt all culminated, sensibly enough, in a decision to leave. It took us four\nyears to reach this conclusion, perhaps even longer. There were hours of\nconversations with friends, therapists and a lawyer or two. We certainly\nhaven\u2019t jumped into this. We made the awkward announcement a few months ago\nand faced a long period of the partner\u2019s hurt and anger. There were some truly\nhorrible scenes. But things have calmed down; the end has turned into a quiet,\nmelancholy and well accepted fact on both sides. We\u2019re moving out imminently,\nthings are ready with the new apartment; it\u2019s the last weekend and we\u2019re\nhaving a farewell drink before supper.\n\nWhich is when we start to realise something at once deeply puzzling and not a\nlittle embarrassing too. We acknowledge that we have started to find our\nabout-to-be-ex-partner \u2013 from whom we have struggled with every sinew to\nseparate at enormous cost and inconvenience \u2013 distinctly charming. They\u2019re\nwearing a pair of shoes we like them in; there\u2019s a fascinating thing they do\nwith their eyes when they hold their head on one side and shoot a glance at\nus. We sense their inherent kindness in the way they discuss a mutual\nacquaintance; their dignity and intelligence is present in their manner of\narranging objects around the living room. They say something wry and sharp\nabout an idea they\u2019ve read in the paper; their mind is a very fine thing. They\nmention they\u2019re going for a walk later to pick up some wine, with no\nassumption that we\u2019ll want to accompany them. But we do. They\u2019re extremely\nlovely. We want to touch their hair, stay longer, unpack the bags, maybe talk\nto them once more about... We feel we\u2019re having a dramatic change of heart at\nthe last possible moment. We appear to be on the cusp of realising that we\u2019ve\nmade a terrible mistake: it\u2019s wholly bizarre and contrary to everything we\ncould have predicted but we\u2019re experiencing a powerful attraction to the\nperson we\u2019ve done everything to try to leave.\n\nWhat is going on? Is it a genuine reawakening of love and evidence that, if we\nwere to cancel our plans and move back together again, we would now truly be\nmuch happier? Or is this a devilish delusion arising from a temporary mental\nimbalance with no possible import on reality?\n\nWe might decode our feelings as follows: we are developing a last-minute crush\non the person we\u2019re leaving.\n\nA classic literary description of a crush can be found in the Russian writer\nIvan Turgenev\u2019s novel, The Torrents of Spring, published in 1872. It tells the\nstory of a man who \u2013 on the way to the station on a warm spring day \u2013 goes\ninto a bar to get a glass of mineral water. The woman who serves him has\ndelightful hair, a lovely smile and she opens the bottle with unusual grace.\nHe instantly feels he\u2019s in love with her and envisages a blissful future for\nthem together. He abandons his journey and books into a nearby hotel so he can\nbe with her all the time. After two days, he decides he must marry her. But\nafter three days, he\u2019s realised it was all a terrible mistake \u2013 and he runs\naway and never sees her again.\n\nThough crushes are almost universally associated with the very start of love,\nin reality, they can happen just as much at love\u2019s near-end point. In honour\nof Turgenev\u2019s book, we might call our experience with our departing lover an\nAutumn Crush.\n\nThe essential feature of Crushes in both their Spring and Autumn varieties is\nthat we are not, while under their sway, attempting to engage too deeply with\nthe reality of another person. We are standing outside, peering respectfully\nin. We are not in any way trying to run a household, get a person to agree\nwith our opinions on politics or family, sex or work, or asking them to love\nus in a specific way. We\u2019re not bringing any of our demands to bear on them.\nWe\u2019re merely looking \u2013 and from this unpressured vantage point, we register\nthe presence of a properly fascinating and sincerely delightful person. This\nis a fair judgement on another human, though not necessarily for that matter\non our chances of being able to maintain a happy relationship with them; there\nare \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 far more lovely people in the world than there are ones\nwe might be able to live contentedly alongside.\n\nThough they can seem like ambitious endeavours, crushes are secretly fuelled\nby the lowest of expectations. When we are thinking obsessively of a new\nperson, our hopes are running in the background at almost zero: we would be\noverjoyed simply if they answered our phone call and agreed ever to see us\nagain. We would feel blessed beyond measure if they held our hand for a\nminute. We are at an apogee of modesty. But, the more the relationship\nsucceeds, the more the criteria on which we judge its success expand. Two\nmonths in, we might consider it infuriating or tragic that the partner doesn\u2019t\nwant a certain kind of sex with us, misunderstands our family, puts forward a\ncontrary opinion on a friend or has a clashing taste in interior decoration.\nWe can end up having to finish a relationship not because the partner is awful\nper se but because they are deeply disappointing in relation to the\nexpectations for mutuality that we have brought to bear on them.\n\nAnd yet it would be unfair to these expectations automatically to dismiss them\nas pathological or overly demanding either. They might \u2013 from an objective\npoint of view \u2013 be entirely legitimate. It isn\u2019t any sign of madness to want\nto be understood deeply. It doesn\u2019t have to be a delusion to seek out\nconnection and good communication. Our partner might be accomplished in many\nways and still not be the person we should be with. During our late crush, we\nare rediscovering what\u2019s nice about someone, not \u2013 as we might get muddled\ninto thinking \u2013 rediscovering why it might be a good idea to be with them.\n\nIf we have decided to leave a partner and, without there having been any new\npsychological developments or ground-breaking conversations, we suddenly find\nwe desire them once more in the last moments, we should beware of ever\nthinking ourselves back in love. We are merely enjoying an artificial rush for\nsomeone because we have \u2013 in a deep part of our souls \u2013 finally given up hope\nof ever trying to live with, or be happy alongside, them.\n\n## Full Article Index\n\n  * 01\\.
