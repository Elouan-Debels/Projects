It shows that mainstream studies\nand official data do not support the claim that we are witnessing an increase\nin extreme weather events \u2013 hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires and all\nthe rest. It emphatically counters the claim that current temperatures and\nlevels of atmospheric CO2 are unusually and worryingly high. On the contrary,\ncompared to the last half billion years of earth\u2019s history, both current\ntemperatures and CO2 levels are extremely and unusually low. We are currently\nin an ice age. It also shows that there is no evidence that changing levels of\nCO2 (it has changed many times) has ever \u2018driven\u2019 climate change in the past.\nWhy then, are we told, again and again, that \u2018catastrophic man-made climate-\nchange\u2019 is an irrefutable fact? Why are we told that there is no evidence that\ncontradicts it? Why are we told that anyone who questions \u2018climate chaos\u2019 is a\n\u2018flat-earther\u2019 and a \u2018science-denier\u2019? The film explores the nature of the\nconsensus behind climate change. It describes the origins of the climate\nfunding bandwagon, and the rise of the trillion-dollar climate industry. It\ndescribes the hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on the climate crisis.\nIt explains the enormous pressure on scientists and others not to question the\nclimate alarm: the withdrawal of funds, rejection by science journals, social\nostracism. But the climate alarm is much more than a funding and jobs\nbandwagon. The film explores the politics of climate. From the beginning, the\nclimate scare was political. The culprit was free-market industrial\ncapitalism. The solution was higher taxes and more regulation. From the start,\nthe climate alarm appealed to, and has been adopted and promoted by, those\ngroups who favour bigger government. This is the unspoken political divide\nbehind the climate alarm. The climate scare appeals especially to all those in\nthe sprawling publicly-funded establishment. This includes the largely\npublicly-funded Western intelligentsia, for whom climate has become a moral\ncause. In these circles, to criticise or question the climate alarm has become\nis a breach of social etiquette. The film includes interviews with a number of\nvery prominent scientists, including Professor Steven Koonin (author of\n\u2018Unsettled\u2019, a former provost and vice-president of Caltech), Professor Dick\nLindzen (formerly professor of meteorology at Harvard and MIT), Professor Will\nHapper (professor of physics at Princeton), Dr John Clauser (winner of the\nNobel prize in Physics in 2022), Professor Nir Shaviv (Racah Institute of\nPhysics), professor Ross McKitrick (University of Guelph), Willie Soon and\nseveral others. The film was written and directed by the British filmmaker\nMartin Durkin and is the sequel of his excellent 2007 documentary The Great\nGlobal Warming Swindle. Tom Nelson, a podcaster who has been deeply examining\nclimate debate issues for the better part of two decades, was the producer of\nthe film. #ClimateTheMovie will be available for free at many online locations\nstarting on March 21 2024.
