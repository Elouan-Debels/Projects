Most of us don\u2019t walk around distinguishing\nbetween simple and complex multi-tasking when we talk about our day: \u201cI multi-\ntasked all afternoon and I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d \u201cYes, I multi-task when I drive.\u201d \u201cA\ngood chef has to multi-task.\u201d\n\nWere those examples of simple or complex multi-tasking? There\u2019s no way to\nknow. The differences between simple and complex multi-tasking are profound.\nSo, when I noticed that complex multi-tasking was increasingly pervasive in\nour culture, I took the liberty of giving it a new name: continuous partial\nattention. WordSpy, a fun site that tracks new words and phrases, recognizes\ncpa, and so does Wikipedia.\n\nContinuous partial attention and multi-tasking are two different attention\nstrategies, motivated by different impulses. When we multi-task, we are\nmotivated by a desire to be more productive and more efficient. Each activity\nhas the same priority \u2013 we eat lunch AND file papers. We stir the soup AND\ntalk on the phone. With simple multi-tasking, one or more activities is\nsomewhat automatic or routine, like eating lunch or stirring soup. That\nactivity is then paired with another activity that is automatic, or with an\nactivity that requires cognition, like writing an email or talking on the\nphone. At the core of simple multi-tasking is a desire to be more productive.\nWe multi-task to CREATE more opportunity for ourselves \u2013time to DO more and\ntime to RELAX more.\n\nAn image, that comes to mind for me here, is the contrast between the\norganization man (Whyte, 1956): a dutiful employee who ate lunch in a\ncafeteria or restaurant and certainly not at his desk; and the entrepreneur of\nthe late 1960\u2019s, early 1970\u2019s, who ate lunch at his/her desk or while filing\npapers, in order to get more done in a day.\n\nSimple multi-tasking made it possible to cram more into our workday, and\noften, helped create a little more free time for drinks with friends, or time\nwith family, or a favorite television show.\n\nIn the case of continuous partial attention, we\u2019re motivated by a desire not\nto miss anything. We\u2019re engaged in two activities that both demand cognition.\nWe\u2019re talking on the phone and driving. We\u2019re writing an email and\nparticipating in a conference call. We\u2019re carrying on a conversation at dinner\nand texting under the table on the Blackberry or iPhone.\n\nContinuous partial attention also describes a state in which attention is on a\npriority or primary task, while, at the same time, scanning for other people,\nactivities, or opportunities, and replacing the primary task with something\nthat seems, in this next moment, more important. When we do this, we may have\nthe feeling that our brains process multiple activities in parallel.\nResearchers say that while we can rapidly shift between activities, our brains\nprocess serially.\n\nContinuous partial attention involves a kind of vigilance that is not\ncharacteristic of multi-tasking. With cpa, we feel most alive when we\u2019re\nconnected, plugged in, and in the know. We constantly SCAN for opportunities \u2013\nactivities or people \u2013 in any given moment. With every opportunity we ask,\n\u201cWhat can I gain here?\u201d\n\nWhy care about the difference between multi-tasking and cpa?\n\nContinuous partial attention is an always on, anywhere, anytime, any place\nbehavior that creates an artificial sense of crisis. We are always in high\nalert. We are demanding multiple cognitively complex actions from ourselves.\nWe are reaching to keep a top priority in focus, while, at the same time,\nscanning the periphery to see if we are missing other opportunities. If we\nare, our very fickle attention shifts focus. What\u2019s ringing? Who is it? How\nmany emails? What\u2019s on my list? What time is it in Bangalore?\n\nIn this state of always-on crisis, our adrenalized \u201cfight or flight\u201d mechanism\nkicks in. This is great when we\u2019re being chased by tigers. How many of those\n500 emails a day is a TIGER? How many are flies? Is everything an emergency?\nOur way of using the current set of technologies would have us believe it is.\n\nOver the last twenty years, we have become expert at continuous partial\nattention and we have pushed ourselves to an extreme that I call, continuous\ncontinuous partial attention. There are times when cpa is the best attention\nstrategy for what we\u2019re doing; and, in small doses, continuous partial\nattention serves us well. There are times when cpa and ccpa compromises us.\n\nThe \u201cshadow side\u201d of cpa is over-stimulation and lack of fulfillment. The\nlatest, greatest powerful technologies are now contributing to our feeling\nincreasingly powerless. Researchers are beginning to tell us that we may\nactually be doing tasks more slowly and poorly.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. We have more attention-related and stress-related diseases\nthan ever before. Continuous continuous partial attention and the fight or\nflight response associated with it, can set off a cascade of stress hormones,\nstarting with norepinephrin and its companion, cortisol. As a hormone,\ncortisol is a universal donor. It can attach to any receptor site. As a\nresult, dopamine and seratonin \u2013the hormones that help us feel calm and happy\n\u2013 have nowhere to go because cortisol has taken up the available spaces. The\nabundance of cortisol in our systems has contributed to our turning to\npharmaceuticals to calm us down and help us sleep. Read about email apnea to\nunderstand how our relationship with screen-based activities plays a role in\nthis fight or flight response.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nZG Maps and ZG MappingDecember 2, 2009In \"attention\"\n\nScreen Apnea in the NYTimesAugust 21, 2023In \"continuous partial attention\"\n\nAspen Ideas Festival: \u201cInformation Overload\u201dJanuary 19, 2014In \"attention\"\n\nPosted byLinda StoneNovember 30, 2009March 7, 2014Posted incontinuous\ncontinuous partial attention, continuous partial attention, multi-tasking,\nstress\n\n## Published by Linda Stone\n\nI coined the phrases continuous partial attention, email apnea, and screen\napnea.

Steve Wiggins says:\n\nDecember 8, 2009 at 8:02 am\n\nGood to see your blog, Linda! I\u2019ve been using your phrase \u201ccontinuous partial\nattention\u201d ever since I learned about it from you. I think it captures the\nstate of many of today\u2019s students (especially). I see it all the time at\nRutgers and noticed it at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh before that.\nExcellent analysis!\n\nReply\n\n  2. john steppling says:\n\nSeptember 3, 2010 at 12:41 am\n\nExcellent piece. I think there is a kind of expectation going on here, too. We\nanticipate this fragmentation........interruptions. From the expectation of a\ncommercial break in watching narrative TV \u2014 we\u2019ve accelerated to cpa. Im not\nsure Im making sense here, but I noticed this with students as well, at the\npolish national film school where i taught for five years. An inability to\nfocus on any extended narrative. And films now tend to incorporate a montage\n(editing) version of cpa.\n\nReply\n\n  3. ermywormy says:\n\nFebruary 24, 2011 at 9:07 am\n\nTechnology indeed makes us have more CPA.\n\nGreat analysis.\n\nReply\n\n  4. DK says:\n\nApril 6, 2011 at 11:03 pm\n\nReally well-written article. One cause of cpa that you didn\u2019t really explore\nis commercial profit. As business continues to look for more targeted and\nfrequent ways to engage consumers, the BUSINESS is motivated to enable and\nencourage cpa. Banner ads on mobile phones, interactive and social TV, etc.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Rich Ebeh says:\n\nApril 15, 2012 at 7:12 am\n\nVery impressive theoretical piece of wrting. It has made me to wonder, as an\norganizational psychologist, if this construct have been developed into a\nmeasure. It would be really helpful being able to identify if some people are\nmore susceptible to CPA than others.\n\nReply\n\n  6. cpanel vps says:\n\nAugust 5, 2013 at 5:04 pm\n\nYour mode of describing everything in this piece of writing is truly nice, all\nbe capable of effortlessly know it, Thanks a lot.|\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nLinda Stone,\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Linda Stone\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
