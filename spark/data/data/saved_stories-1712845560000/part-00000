She was 87 years old. Here, in its original layout, is Didion\u2019s\nseminal essay \u201cSelf-respect: Its Source, Its Power,\u201d which was first published\nin Vogue in 1961, and which was republished as \u201cOn Self-Respect\u201d in the\nauthor\u2019s 1968 collection, Slouching Towards Bethlehem. Didion wrote the essay\nas the magazine was going to press, to fill the space left after another\nwriter did not produce a piece on the same subject. She wrote it not to a word\ncount or a line count, but to an exact character count.\n\nOnce, in a dry season, I wrote in large letters across two pages of a notebook\nthat innocence ends when one is stripped of the delusion that one likes\noneself. Although now, some years later, I marvel that a mind on the outs with\nitself should have nonetheless made painstaking record of its every tremor, I\nrecall with embarrassing clarity the flavor of those particular ashes. It was\na matter of misplaced self-respect.\n\nI had not been elected to Phi Beta Kappa. This failure could scarcely have\nbeen more predictable or less ambiguous (I simply did not have the grades),\nbut I was unnerved by it; I had somehow thought myself a kind of academic\nRaskolnikov, curiously exempt from the cause-effect relationships that\nhampered others. Although the situation must have had even then the\napproximate tragic stature of Scott Fitzgerald's failure to become president\nof the Princeton Triangle Club, the day that I did not make Phi Beta Kappa\nnevertheless marked the end of something, and innocence may well be the word\nfor it. I lost the conviction that lights would always turn green for me, the\npleasant certainty that those rather passive virtues which had won me approval\nas a child automatically guaranteed me not only Phi Beta Kappa keys but\nhappiness, honour, and the love of a good man (preferably a cross between\nHumphrey Bogart in Casablanca and one of the Murchisons in a proxy fight);\nlost a certain touching faith in the totem power of good manners, clean hair,\nand proven competence on the Stanford-Binet scale. To such doubtful amulets\nhad my self-respect been pinned, and I faced myself that day with the\nnonplussed wonder of someone who has come across a vampire and found no\ngarlands of garlic at hand.\n\nRelated Video\n\nGo Inside Gisele B\u00fcndchen\u2019s New Miami Home\u2014And See Her Most Prized Possessions\n\nAlthough to be driven back upon oneself is an uneasy affair at best, rather\nlike trying to cross a border with borrowed credentials, it seems to me now\nthe one condition necessary to the beginnings of real self-respect. Most of\nour platitudes notwithstanding, self-deception remains the most difficult\ndeception. The charms that work on others count for nothing in that\ndevastatingly well-lit back alley where one keeps assignations with oneself:\nno winning smiles will do here, no prettily drawn lists of good intentions.\nWith the desperate agility of a crooked faro dealer who spots Bat Masterson\nabout to cut himself into the game, one shuffles flashily but in vain through\none's marked cards\u2014the kindness done for the wrong reason, the apparent\ntriumph which had involved no real effort, the seemingly heroic act into which\none had been shamed. The dismal fact is that self-respect has nothing to do\nwith the approval of others\u2014who are, after all, deceived easily enough; has\nnothing to do with reputation\u2014which, as Rhett Butler told Scarlett O'Hara, is\nsomething that people with courage can do without.\n\nTo do without self-respect, on the other hand, is to be an unwilling audience\nof one to an interminable home movie that documents one's failings, both real\nand imagined, with fresh footage spliced in for each screening. There\u2019s the\nglass you broke in anger, there's the hurt on X's face; watch now, this next\nscene, the night Y came back from Houston, see how you muff this one. To live\nwithout self-respect is to lie awake some night, beyond the reach of warm\nmilk, phenobarbital, and the sleeping hand on the coverlet, counting up the\nsins of commission and omission, the trusts betrayed, the promises subtly\nbroken, the gifts irrevocably wasted through sloth or cowardice or\ncarelessness. However long we postpone it, we eventually lie down alone in\nthat notoriously un- comfortable bed, the one we make ourselves. Whether or\nnot we sleep in it depends, of course, on whether or not we respect ourselves.\n\nJoan Didion\n\nPhoto: Quintana Roo Dunne\n\nTo protest that some fairly improbable people, some people who could not\npossibly respect themselves, seem to sleep easily enough is to miss the point\nentirely, as surely as those people miss it who think that self-respect has\nnecessarily to do with not having safety pins in one's underwear. There is a\ncommon superstition that \"self-respect\" is a kind of charm against snakes,\nsomething that keeps those who have it locked in some unblighted Eden, out of\nstrange beds, ambivalent conversations, and trouble in general. It does not at\nall. It has nothing to do with the face of things, but concerns instead a\nseparate peace, a private reconciliation. Although the careless, suicidal\nJulian English in Appointment in Samarra and the careless, incurably dishonest\nJordan Baker in The Great Gatsby seem equally improbable candidates for self-\nrespect, Jordan Baker had it, Julian English did not. With that genius for\naccommodation more often seen in women than in men, Jordan took her own\nmeasure, made her own peace, avoided threats to that peace: \"I hate careless\npeople,\" she told Nick Carraway. \"It takes two to make an accident.\"\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Magazine\n\nZendaya Talks Challengers, Talks to Serena Williams, and Considers Her Future\n\nBy Marley Marius\n\n  * Celebrity Style\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Carries the Gen-Z \u2018It\u2019 Bag Du Jour\n\nBy Hannah Jackson\n\n  * Fashion\n\nOn the Podcast: Law Roach on Zendaya\u2019s Epic Dual May Vogue Covers\n\nBy Chelsea Daniel\n\nLike Jordan Baker, people with self-respect have the courage of their\nmistakes. They know the price of things. If they choose to commit adultery,\nthey do not then go running, in an access of bad conscience, to receive\nabsolution from the wronged parties; nor do they complain unduly of the\nunfairness, the undeserved embarrassment, of being named corespondent. If they\nchoose to forego their work\u2014say it is screenwriting\u2014in favor of sitting around\nthe Algonquin bar, they do not then wonder bitterly why the Hacketts, and not\nthey, did Anne Frank.\n\nIn brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of\nmoral nerve; they display what was once called character, a quality which,\nalthough approved in the abstract, sometimes loses ground to other, more\ninstantly negotiable virtues. The measure of its slipping prestige is that one\ntends to think of it only in connection with homely children and with United\nStates senators who have been defeated, preferably in the primary, for re-\nelection. Nonetheless, character\u2014the willingness to accept responsibility for\none's own life\u2014is the source from which self-respect springs.\n\nSelf-respect is something that our grandparents, whether or not they had it,\nknew all about. They had instilled in them, young, a certain discipline, the\nsense that one lives by doing things one does not particularly want to do, by\nputting fears and doubts to one side, by weighing immediate comforts against\nthe possibility of larger, even intangible, comforts. It seemed to the\nnineteenth century admirable, but not remarkable, that Chinese Gordon put on a\nclean white suit and held Khartoum against the Mahdi; it did not seem unjust\nthat the way to free land in California involved death and difficulty and\ndirt. In a diary kept during the winter of 1846, an emigrating twelve-year-old\nnamed Narcissa Cornwall noted coolly: \"Father was busy reading and did not\nnotice that the house was being filled with strange Indians until Mother spoke\nabout it.\" Even lacking any clue as to what Mother said, one can scarcely fail\nto be impressed by the entire incident: the father reading, the Indians filing\nin, the mother choosing the words that would not alarm, the child duly\nrecording the event and noting further that those particular Indians were not,\n\"fortunately for us,\" hostile. Indians were simply part of the donn\u00e9e.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Magazine\n\nZendaya Talks Challengers, Talks to Serena Williams, and Considers Her Future\n\nBy Marley Marius\n\n  * Celebrity Style\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Carries the Gen-Z \u2018It\u2019 Bag Du Jour\n\nBy Hannah Jackson\n\n  * Fashion\n\nOn the Podcast: Law Roach on Zendaya\u2019s Epic Dual May Vogue Covers\n\nBy Chelsea Daniel\n\nIn one guise or another, Indians always are. Again, it is a question of\nrecognizing that anything worth having has its price. People who respect\nthemselves are willing to accept the risk that the Indians will be hostile,\nthat the venture will go bankrupt, that the liaison may not turn out to be one\nin which every day is a holiday because you\u2019re married to me. They are willing\nto invest something of themselves; they may not play at all, but when they do\nplay, they know the odds.\n\nThat kind of self-respect is a discipline, a habit of mind that can never be\nfaked but can be developed, trained, coaxed forth. It was once suggested to me\nthat, as an antidote to crying, I put my head in a paper bag. As it happens,\nthere is a sound physiological reason, something to do with oxygen, for doing\nexactly that, but the psychological effect alone is incalculable: it is\ndifficult in the extreme to continue fancying oneself Cathy in Wuthering\nHeights with one's head in a Food Fair bag. There is a similar case for all\nthe small disciplines, unimportant in themselves; imagine maintaining any kind\nof swoon, commiserative or carnal, in a cold shower.\n\nBut those small disciplines are valuable only insofar as they represent larger\nones. To say that Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton is not to say\nthat Napoleon might have been saved by a crash program in cricket; to give\nformal dinners in the rain forest would be pointless did not the candlelight\nflickering on the liana call forth deeper, stronger disciplines, values\ninstilled long before. It is a kind of ritual, helping us to remember who and\nwhat we are. In order to remember it, one must have known it.\n\nTo have that sense of one's intrinsic worth which, for better or for worse,\nconstitutes self-respect, is potentially to have everything: the ability to\ndiscriminate, to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is to be locked\nwithin oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference. If we\ndo not respect ourselves, we are on the one hand forced to despise those who\nhave so few resources as to consort with us, so little perception as to remain\nblind to our fatal weaknesses. On the other, we are peculiarly in thrall to\neveryone we see, curiously determined to live out\u2014since our self-image is\nuntenable\u2014their false notions of us. We flatter ourselves by thinking this\ncompulsion to please others an attractive trait: a gift for imaginative\nempathy, evidence of our willingness to give. Of course we will play Francesca\nto Paolo, Brett Ashley to Jake, Helen Keller to anyone's Annie Sullivan: no\nexpectation is too misplaced, no r\u00f4le too ludicrous. At the mercy of those we\ncan not but hold in contempt, we play r\u00f4les doomed to failure before they are\nbegun, each defeat generating fresh despair at the necessity of divining and\nmeeting the next demand made upon us.\n\nIt is the phenomenon sometimes called alienation from self. In its advanced\nstages, we no longer answer the telephone, because someone might want\nsomething; that we could say no without drowning in self-reproach is an idea\nalien to this game. Every encounter demands too much, tears the nerves, drains\nthe will, and the spectre of something as small as an unanswered letter\narouses such disproportionate guilt that one's sanity becomes an object of\nspeculation among one's acquaintances. To assign unanswered letters their\nproper weight, to free us from the expectations of others, to give us back to\nourselves\u2014there lies the great, the singular power of self-respect. Without\nit, one eventually discovers the final turn of the screw: one runs away to\nfind oneself, and finds no one at home.\n\nTopicsJoan Didion\n\nRead More\n\n  * Celebrity Style\n\nJennifer Lawrence Perfects Transitional Dressing\n\nBy Hannah Jackson\n\n  * Magazine\n\nThe Stunning Rise of Tennis's Jannik Sinner\n\nBy Abby Aguirre\n\n  * Celebrity Style\n\nZendaya\u2019s Challengers Wardrobe Is a Mix of Custom and Vintage\n\nBy Christian Allaire\n\n  * Wellness\n\nAyan Broomfield\u2014Athlete and Girlfriend of Frances Tiafoe\u2014Blends Tennis,\nBeauty, and Travel to Give Back\n\nBy Nick Remsen\n\n  * Arts\n\nIn His First Solo Museum Exhibition, Photographer Kacey Jeffers Takes a\nKaleidoscopic View of Life in Nevis\n\nBy Olivia Horner\n\n  * Books\n\nGrace Blakeley Wants You to Forget Everything You Think You Know About\nCapitalism\n\nBy Hayley Maitland\n\nThe latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week\nupdates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
