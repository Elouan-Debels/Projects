Below\nare the three key benefits:\n\n### 1\\. Fast Onboarding\n\n> Discover and analyze your data with our user interface. Effortlessly\n> generate results without needing to code.\n\n### 2\\. Secure By Design\n\n> Your database contents will never be transmitted to the LLM. Only metadata,\n> like schemas, documentation, and queries, will be used in semantic search.\n\n### 3\\. Open-Source\n\n> Deploy WrenAI anywhere you like on your own data, LLM APIs, and environment,\n> it's free.\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 WrenAI's Architecture\n\nWrenAI is consist of three core services:\n\n  * Wren UI: An intuitive user interface for asking questions, defining data relationships, and integrating data sources within WrenAI's framework.\n\n  * Wren AI Service: Processes queries using a vector database for context retrieval, guiding LLMs to produce precise SQL outputs.\n\n  * Wren Engine: Serves as the platform's backbone, managing metadata and connecting to data sources, while preparing for future application integrations.\n\n## \ud83e\udee3 Sneak Peek\n\nData Modeling| Ask and Follow-up Questions  \n---|---  \n  \n## \ud83e\udd1e Design Philosophies\n\nWe have some core design philosophies that were used when developing WrenAI.\n\n  * Explainability: WrenAI ensures that every SQL query generated in natural language is accurate, concise, and reliable.\n  * Interoperability: WrenAI enables users to query data from multiple sources without dealing with the complexities of different data formats and dialects, providing a standard interface across different sources.\n  * Interactive Experience: WrenAI is designed to engage users in a dialogue, clarifying their queries and refining results in real time.\n  * Continuous Learning: WrenAI will proactively learn through ongoing query history, feedback, and interactions. Incorporating new patterns, information, and data structures into our LLM knowledge base.\n\n## \ud83d\udea7 Project Status\n\nWrenAI is currently in alpha version. The project team is actively working on\nprogress and aiming to release new versions at least biweekly.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Getting Started\n\nUsing WrenAI is super simple, you can setup within 3 minutes, and start to\ninteract with your own data!\n\nStart Today And Be 100X More Productive Than Yesterday\n\n  * Visit our Installation Guide of WrenAI.\n  * Visit the Usage Guides to learn more about how to use WrenAI.\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\nVisit WrenAI documentation to view the full documentation.\n\n## \u2b50\ufe0f Community\n\n  * Welcome to our Discord server to give us feedback!\n  * If there is any issues, please visit Github Issues.\n\nDo note that our Code of Conduct applies to all WrenAI community channels.\nUsers are highly encouraged to read and adhere to them to avoid repercussions.\n\n## About\n\nMake Text-to-SQL simple and accurate. \ud83d\udc26 WrenAI is your AI data assistant that\nhelps you get results and insights faster by asking questions without writing\nSQL.\n\ngetwren.ai\n\n### Topics\n\npython bigquery typescript sql ai postgresql openai text-to-sql rag duckdb llm\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nApache-2.0 license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n68 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n10 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n1 fork\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 2\n\n0.1.1 Latest\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\n\\+ 1 release\n\n## Packages 3\n\n  * wren-ai-service\n  * wren-ui\n  * wren-bootstrap\n\n## Contributors 9\n\n## Languages\n\n  * TypeScript 64.1%\n  * Python 30.2%\n  * JavaScript 2.0%\n  * Go 1.7%\n  * Less 1.2%\n  * Dockerfile 0.4%\n  * Other 0.4%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
