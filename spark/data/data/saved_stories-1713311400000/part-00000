(\u201cZayo\u201d) (NYSE: ZAYO)\nentered into a definitive agreement to acquire Spread Networks for $127\nmillion in cash.^[12]^[13]\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\nSpread Networks uses fiber optic cables along a route as close to straight as\npossible to connect the Chicago area with the New York area, specifically\nconnecting Chicago (home to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) to Carteret, New\nJersey (home to the Nasdaq data center).^[2]^[4]^[5] According to their\nwebsite, the network is monitored continuously and all parts of the network\nare driven daily to guarantee reliability and proactively fix problems. They\nalso offer colocation facilities for servers at Chicago, Carteret, and\nCleveland, all along the line. Their estimated roundtrip time along the dark\nfiber line (from Chicago to Carteret) is 13 milliseconds.^[4]^[10]^[14] Their\nwave service lines promise roundtrip times of about 14.1-14.2\nmilliseconds,^[15] down from about 14.6 milliseconds in 2011.^[16]\n\nAccording to a WIRED article, the estimated roundtrip time for an ordinary\ncable is 14.5 milliseconds, giving users of Spread Networks a slight\nadvantage. However, because glass has a higher refractive index than air\n(about 1.5 compared to about 1), the roundtrip time for fiber optic cable\ntransmission is 50% more than that for transmission through the air. Some\ncompanies, such as McKay Brothers, Metrorede and Tradeworx, are using air-\nbased transmission to offer lower estimated roundtrip times (8.2 milliseconds\nand 8.5 milliseconds respectively) that are very close to the theoretical\nminimum possible (about 7.9-8 milliseconds).^[4]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt by Michael Lewis\n  * The Hummingbird Project\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Spread Networks\".
