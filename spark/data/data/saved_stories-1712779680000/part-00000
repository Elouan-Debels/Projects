Our writing has moved to makandra cards.\n\nThe blog of , a Ruby on Rails development team\n\nKnown from Rails LTS and OpsComplete for Ruby\n\n# The greatest bug I never fixed\n\nBugs ain't fun. Except when they are. This is the story of the greatest bug I\nnever fixed.\n\nIn an earlier life I wrote addons for World of Warcraft. Aside from being\naddicted to the game at the time, it was a mindblowing experience for someone\nobsessed with plugin architectures and the evolution of public APIs. It was\nalso a great excuse to learn Lua, which is a fun language.\n\nOne of the better addons a friend and I built during that period was\nFriendNet. FriendNet helped to deal with the greatest challenge in the game:\nFinding people to play with who aren't dicks. The addon took your in-game\nfriend list and shared it with all your friends. In return, they shared their\nfriends with you. As a result the number of people you could trust weren't\ndicks increased.\n\nBecause any form of network communication was forbidden by the addon API, we\nhad to come up with a hack to distribute those friend lists. What we did was\nserialize those lists into in-game chat messages and whisper them to the\nreceiving player's avatar.\n\nYes, years before your Mom discovered Facebook we were tunnelling social\ngraphs over the chat channels of a virtual world. We should have gotten\nfunding.\n\nAnyway, FriendNet did have some quality issues. P2P applications are hard to\nget right, and you can't just make people upgrade every time you release a\nbugfix. So we had all those different versions talking with each other,\nresulting in a lot of emergent behaviour and hard to reproduce bugs.\n\nOne bug was especially hard to pin down: Once every few days FriendNet would\nencounter a corrupt message, resulting in parts of the addon GUI to be messed\nup. We received enough bug reports to believe that the issue was real, but we\ncould never reproduce the bug no matter how hard we tried. It was the bug from\nhell. Eventually we gave up, blamed it on a buggy API and moved on.\n\nThe solution came to me years after I stopped playing the game. When I\nrealized what had gone wrong, the light almost blinded me.\n\nYou know, your character can get drunk in World of Warcraft. After drinking\nenough virtual booze, your screen will start to blur and your character will\nno longer move in straight lines. Also when you type something into the chat\nlike\n\n    \n    \n    Penelope says: I'm so wasted\n\nIt will come out like this:\n\n    \n    \n    Penelope says: I'm sho washted ...hic!\n\nBecause FriendNet serialized all of its communication into chat messages, it\nsent corrupted data whenever the broadcasting player was drunk.\n\nFriendNet has long since disappeared from the addon sites you could once\ndownload it from. I doubt it would even boot up in a current version of the\ngame. But even though I never got to fix that bug, I still remember it with\nfond amusement.\n\nHenning Koch @triskweline Apr 28, 2010\n\nCheck out our e-book:\n\nGrowing Rails Applications in Practice\n\nLearn to structure large Ruby on Rails codebases with the tools you already\nknow and love.\n\nLearn more\n\n# Recent posts\n\n  * The performance impact of removing jQuery (with pictures)\n  * Introductory interview with Michael\n  * A matter of the heart\n  * Investigating slow PostgreSQL Index Only scans\n  * Introductory interview with Stefan\n  * How custom elements will change web development\n  * Introductory interview with Robin\n\nAbout makandra Feed Twitter Facebook\n\nOur address: makandra GmbH Werner-von-Siemens-Str. 6 86159 Augsburg Germany\n\nContact us: +49 821 58866 180 info@makandra.de\n\nCommercial register court: Augsburg Municipal Court\n\nRegister number: HRB 24202\n\nSales tax identification number: DE243555898\n\nChief executive officers: Henning Koch Thomas Eisenbarth\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n", "frontpage": true}
