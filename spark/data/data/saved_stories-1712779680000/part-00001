He covers topics\nranging from guaranteed income and shorter workweeks to meditation and\npsychedelics.\n\n## This story is part of a group of stories called\n\nFinding the best ways to do good.\n\nThe idea that language is a clumsy, imperfect tool for capturing the depth and\nrichness of our experiences is ancient. For centuries, a steady stream of\npoets, philosophers, and spiritual practitioners have pointed to this\nindescribability, the difficult fact that our experiences are ineffable, or\nlarger than what words can communicate.\n\nBut as a frenzy of developments across AI, neuroscience, animal studies,\npsychedelics, and meditation breathe new life into consciousness research,\nscientists are devising new ways of, maybe, pushing our descriptions of\nexperience beyond the limits of language. Part of the hope behind what\nmathematician and physicist Johannes Kleiner recently termed the \u201cstructural\nturn in consciousness science\u201d is that where words fall short, math may\nprevail.\n\n\u201cMy view is that mathematical language is a way for us to climb out of the\nboundaries that evolution has set for our cognitive systems,\u201d Kleiner told\nVox. \u201cHopefully, [mathematical] structure is like a little hack to get around\nsome of the private nature of consciousness.\u201d\n\nFor example, words could offer you a poem about the feeling of standing on a\nsidewalk when a car driving by splashes a puddle from last night\u2019s rain\ndirectly into your face. A mathematical structure, on the other hand, could\ncreate an interactive 3D model of that experience, showing how all the\ndifferent sensations \u2014 the smell of wet concrete, the maddening sound of the\ncar fleeing the scene of its crime, the viscous drip of dirty water down your\nface \u2014 relate to one another.\n\nStructural approaches could provide new and more testable predictions about\nconsciousness. That, in turn, could make a whole new range of experimental\nquestions about consciousness tractable, like predicting the level of\nconsciousness in coma patients, which structural ideas like Integrated\nInformation Theory (IIT) are already doing.\n\nBut for my money, there will always be a gap between even the best structural\nmodels of consciousness and the what-it\u2019s-like-ness of the experiences we\nhave. Mica Xu Ji, a former post-doctoral fellow at the Mila AI Institute and\nlead author of a new paper that takes a structural approach to making sense of\nthis longstanding fact of ineffability, thinks ineffability isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s\na feature that evolution baked into consciousness.\n\nFrom humans to machine learning models, information loss is a common problem.\nBut another way to look at losing information is to see it as gaining\nsimplicity, and simplicity, she explained, helps to make consciousness\ngeneralizable and more useful for navigating situations we haven\u2019t experienced\nbefore. So maybe ineffability isn\u2019t just a problem that locks away the full\nfeeling of our experiences, but is also an evolutionary feature that helped us\nsurvive through the ages.\n\n### The math of ineffability\n\nIn theory, working out the precise ineffability of an experience is pretty\nstraightforward.\n\nJi and her colleagues began with the idea that the richness of conscious\nexperience depends on the amount of information it contains. We can already\ntake real-world reads of richness by measuring the entropy, or\nunpredictability, of electrical activity in the brain.\n\nHer paper argues that to gauge ineffability, all you\u2019d need are two variables:\nthe original state and the output state. The original state could be a direct\nmeasure of brain activity, including all the neural processing that goes on\nbeneath conscious awareness. The output state could be the words you produce\nto describe it, or even the narrativized thoughts in your head about it\n(unless you have no inner monologue).\n\nThen, comparing those numbers would give you an approximation of the\nineffability. The more information lost in the conversion of experience to\nlanguage, as measured by comparing the relative entropy of the original and\noutput variables, the greater the magnitude of the ineffable, or the\ninformation that language left behind. \u201cIneffability is about how information\ngets lost as stuff goes downstream in brain processing,\u201d said Kleiner.\n\nNow, think of the long arc of human evolution. Ineffability means that\nconsciousness can produce simpler representations of the overwhelming richness\nof pure experience, what the American philosopher William James famously\ncalled the \u201cblooming, buzzing confusion\u201d of consciousness. That means\nencountering a pissed-off tiger can be generalized to the broader idea that\nall large cats with massive teeth may pose a threat, rather than constraining\nthat lesson to only that specific tiger in that specific context.\n\nIn machine learning models, as in humans, simplicity supports generalization,\nwhich makes the models useful beyond what they encounter in their training\ndata sets. \u201cLanguage has been optimized to be simple so that we can transmit\ninformation fast,\u201d Ji said. \u201cIneffability, or information loss, is a\nfundamental feature of learning systems that generalize.\u201d\n\n### Pain, health, and the mundane potential of cracking ineffability\n\nIneffability is often associated with mysticism, poetry, or heady\nconversations about the nature of the mind. Or now, the math of information\ntheory and the evolutionary purpose of consciousness.\n\nBut ineffability also plays a role in more immediate and mundane concerns.\nTake chronic pain. One of the most common approaches to understanding what\nsomeone with chronic pain is experiencing is to have them self-report the\nintensity of their pain on a scale from 0 to 10. Another, the Visual Analog\nScale, asks them to mark their pain intensity along a 10-centimeter line, zero\nbeing no pain and 10 representing the worst possible pain.\n\nThese are ... not the most detailed of measures. They also smuggle in\nassumptions that can distort how we understand the pain of others. For\nexample, a linear scale with equal spaces between each possible number\nsuggests that alleviating someone\u2019s reported pain from a four to a three is\nroughly similar to dropping someone else\u2019s from a nine to an eight. But the\nexperiential distance between an eight and a nine could be orders of magnitude\ngreater than between smaller numbers on the scale, leading us to drastically\nunderestimate how much suffering people at the high end of the spectrum are\nenduring.\n\nKleiner explained that structural approaches to representing pain can have the\nsame effect as moving from a 2D image to 3D. \u201cStructural research can\ndistinguish not only location, but different qualities of the pain. Like\nwhether it\u2019s throbbing, for example. We could easily have 20 dimensions.\u201d And\neach dimension adds more richness to our understanding of the pain. That could\nlend motivation \u2014 and funding \u2014 to treating some of the world\u2019s most\ndebilitating conditions that lack effective treatments, such as cluster\nheadaches.\n\nThe same principle applies to mental health. Many mental health indicators\nrely on self-reporting the richness of our internal experience on linear\nscales. But if structural approaches to consciousness can render 3D\nrepresentations of experience, maybe they can add some richness to how we\nmeasure, and therefore manage, mental health at large.\n\nFor example, neuroscientist Selen Atasoy has been developing the idea of\n\u201cbrain harmonics,\u201d which measures electrical activity in the brain and\ndelivers actual 3D representations of moments of experience. With those\nrepresentations, it\u2019s possible that we could learn more about their nature,\nlike the amount of pleasure or pain, by running mathematical analyses based on\nthe harmonic frequencies they contain rather than asking the person to report\nhow they feel via language.\n\nStructural approaches and math surely have their limits. Galileo kicked off\nthe scientific method by assuming that the universe is \u201cwritten in the\nlanguage of mathematics,\u201d which demotes the ineffable depths of human\nexperience to, apparently, something irrelevant to science. Reviving that idea\nwith more advanced math would be a mistake.\n\nBut language, maybe by design, will never capture the full richness of\nconsciousness. That might be to our benefit, helping us generalize our\nexperience in an ever-uncertain world. Meanwhile, more precise mathematical\nstructures to describe conscious experience could also bring welcome benefits,\nfrom grasping just how intense pain can be to conveying the most blissful of\npleasures.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.\nSign up here!\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
