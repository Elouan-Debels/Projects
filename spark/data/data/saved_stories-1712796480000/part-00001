Delivered as turnkey,\nfully managed Kubernetes clusters.\n\n### Bid from $0.001/hr\n\nGet started with Rackspace Spot\n\n### How It Works\n\nGet Started in Minutes\n\n##### Choose your preferred cloud server type\n\nChoose your preferred server class - whether General Purpose, Compute Heavy or\nMemory Heavy. Available in configurations from 1-16 vCPUs, and 1-120GB of RAM.\n\n##### Set your own price by making a bid\n\nTo make a bid, specify the highest price you are willing to pay for the\nselected configuration. Available servers are allocated in an open market\nauction, so you will have your servers for as long as the market price is\nbelow your maximum bid price.\n\n##### Consume via kubectl\n\nYour allocated servers are delivered in a Cloudspace, which includes a fully\nmanaged Kubernetes control plane. We fully manage the K8s stack, including the\ncontrol plane nodes, so you can focus on getting things done using K8s.\n\nOperate with Confidence\n\n##### Stay in control as prices and capacity change\n\nMake informed bids using our \u201cbid price insights\u201d that show you capacity\navailability at different price thresholds. You can also set alerts to be\ninformed as market conditions change. Finally, if the market price rises above\nyour max bid price, you will be notified.\n\n##### Automate with Terraform\n\nAutomate the provisioning, pre-emption handling, and reconfiguration of your\nCloudspaces using our Terraform provider. Deploy and operate Cloudspaces with\n1 simple command.\n\nGet Started in Minutes\n\n##### Choose your preferred cloud server classes\n\nChoose your preferred server class - whether General Purpose, Compute Heavy or\nMemory Heavy.

Bids\nare fulfilled by an open market auction, within minutes.\n\nThe market price for servers is determined by the final cut-off price in the\nauction. Existing bids for capacity are not pre-empted unless the market price\nexceeds the highest price in the bid.\n\nLeverage Kubernetes, without the complexity of managing all the moving parts.\nThe Kubernetes control plane is fully managed, so you don't have to worry\nabout configuring high availability, upgrades, or troubleshooting.\n\nIn addition, Spot comes out of the box with two storage classes for persistent\nstorage (ssd and sata), a network-policy capable CNI (using Calico), and load\nbalancers.\n\nBring your own favorite K8s helm charts of Operators today, while our\nengineers are hard at work to include these out-of-the-box, including:\n\n  * DBaaS operators\n  * Cluster backup\n  * Enhanced monitoring\n  * Security scanning\n  * ML/Ops tooling\n\n#### Open market auction\n\nBid for server capacity from Rackspace's large inventory of cloud capacity.\nBids are fulfilled by an open market auction, and fulfilled within minutes.\n\nThe market price for servers is determined by the final cut-off price for\ncapacity (the lowest winning bid).
