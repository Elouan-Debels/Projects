There is \u201cno safety culture\u201d at Boeing, he claimed, alleging that\nemployees who raise the alarm are \u201cignored, marginalized, threatened,\nsidelined, and worse\u201d.\n\nSalehpour, who has worked at Boeing for more than a decade, said he had\nidentified an issue with gaps between key sections of the 787 Dreamliner that\nhas affected \u201cmore than 1,000\u201d jets in service, warning it would \u201clikely to\ncause premature fatigue failure over time in two major airplane joints\u201d.\n\nAnother witness at the hearing, Ed Pierson, a former Boeing engineer who now\nleads the Foundation for Aviation Safety, alleged a \u201ccriminal cover-up\u201d in the\nwake of cabin panel blowout which sparked the manufacturing giant\u2019s latest\nsafety crisis.\n\nThe incident in January raised fresh questions about the production of\nBoeing\u2019s bestselling commercial jet, the 737 Max. But it is now facing intense\nscrutiny across its fleet.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is investigating allegations by Salehpour\nthat Boeing took shortcuts to reduce production bottlenecks while making the\n787. He also raised issues about the production of the 777, another wide-body\njet.\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Salehpour called on Boeing to ground all 787\njets for inspection. He has claimed sections of the fuselage could break apart\nafter thousands of trips.\n\nIn written testimony, Salehpour said that he contacted Richard Blumenthal, a\nUS senator, \u201cbecause I genuinely believe that the safety problems I have\nobserved at Boeing, if not addressed, could result in a catastrophic failure\nof a commercial airplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI am determined to avoid such a result, regardless of the cost to\nmy career.\u201d\n\nBoeing was contacted for comment. In recent days the company has insisted the\n787 and 777 are safe, describing Salehpour\u2019s allegations about the Dreamliner\nas \u201cinaccurate\u201d. At a briefing this week, executives described how a rigorous\nprogram of tests and inspections had left the firm confident of the jets\u2019\ndurability.\n\nSeparately, as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates\nJanuary\u2019s cabin blowout, Pierson noted the watchdog had \u201creiterated to\nCongress that Boeing has said there are no records\u201d documenting work\nassociated with the removal of a door from the jet before the incident, which\nforced the emergency landing of an Alaska Airlines flight.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion this is a criminal cover-up,\u201d Pierson said \u201cRecords do exist\ndocumenting in detail the hectic work done on the Alaska Airlines airplane and\nBoeing\u2019s corporate leaders know it too ... I know this Alaska airplane\ndocumentation exists because I personally passed it to the FBI.\u201d\n\nPierson told senators that the records were supplied to him by \u201can internal\nwhistleblower\u201d.\n\nBoeing, NTSB and Alaska were contacted for comment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

I was told,\nfrankly, to shut up.\u201d\n\nOn one occasion when he tried to discuss problems, Salehpour alleged that his\nsupervisor said to him: \u201cI would have killed anyone who said what you said if\nit was from some other group, I would tear them apart.\u201d\n\nBoeing has insisted that retaliation was \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d at the company.\n\nAfter scrambling to reassure regulators, airlines and passengers in the wake\nof January\u2019s blowout, Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, and Larry\nKellner, chairman of its board, announced plans to resign last month.\n\n\u201cI believe that Boeing can do better and that the public\u2019s trust in Boeing can\nbe restored,\u201d Salehpour said in his testimony. \u201cI hope that this committee\nwill hold Boeing accountable and demand an end to a business culture that\nprioritizes profit and speed over safety.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Boeing\n  * Airline industry\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
