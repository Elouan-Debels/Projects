However,\nCOVID-19 can also cause organ damage in individuals without symptoms, who\nwould not fall under the current definition of Long COVID. This organ damage,\nwhether symptomatic or not, can lead to various health impacts such as heart\nattacks and strokes. Given these observations, it is necessary to either\nexpand the definition of Long COVID to include organ damage or recognize\nCOVID-19-induced organ damage as a distinct condition affecting many\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 infections.\n\nIt is important to consider that many known adverse health outcomes, including\nheart conditions and cancers, can be asymptomatic until harm thresholds are\nreached. Many more medical conditions can be identified by testing than those\nthat are recognized through reported symptoms. It is therefore important to\nsimilarly recognize that while Long COVID symptoms are associated with organ\ndamage, there are many individuals that have organ damage without displaying\nrecognized symptoms and to include this harm in the characterization of\nCOVID-19 and in the monitoring of individuals after COVID-19 infections.\n\nShare\n\n  * Introduction\n  * The Heart\n  * The Brain\n  * The Endothelium and Blood Vessels\n  * The Endocrine System\n  * The Immune System\n  * Other Organs and Systems\n  * Conclusions\n  * References\n\n## Introduction\n\nSymptomatic Long COVID affects 10-30% of the COVID-19-infected population\ndepending on what symptoms are measured. (1-3) Organ damage might affect over\n50% of post-COVID-19 individuals (4-6) and perhaps more in adolescents and\nchildren. (7)\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to transmit across the world, the consequences of the\npandemic are becoming clearer. It is now known that this virus is not only\ncontagious and potentially deadly but can cause long-term damage as well.\nAcute COVID-19 is known to cause a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild\nto severe and life-threatening complications. Some do not develop symptoms in\nthe acute phase at all. Others experience sudden deaths, (8) heart attacks,\nstrokes, (9-11) debilitating systemic infections, (12-16) heart failure, new\nautoimmune disorders, (17-20) and more are being noticed. Increasing numbers\nof publications since 2020 describe the pathophysiology mechanisms behind\nthese complications, (1, 21-27) and large case-control studies (27-31)\nindicate a significant increase in them.\n\nAcross the spectrum of acute symptoms, many still develop longer-term symptoms\nknown as Long COVID. Estimates range from 10-30% of people who contract\nCOVID-19 experience symptoms that last beyond the initial illness, depending\nlargely on definition. But what is even more concerning \u2014 and less widely\nknown \u2014 is the long-term effect that COVID-19 can have on the organs of those\nwho were infected.\n\nRecent studies have shown that well over 50% of people, for some measures 70%\nor more, who have contracted SARS-COV-2 suffer damage to their organs. (4-6)\nFor example, COVID-19 has the potential to cause lasting scarring in the lungs\nof infected patients, resulting in reduced lung function. (32,33) It has been\nlinked with long-term cardiovascular damage, (10,34,35) which can cause\ndifficulties when exercising (36,37) and even increase the risk of a heart\nattack (9) or stroke. COVID-19 can cause brain damage including loss of brain\ntissue, small blood vessels, and merged brain cells. In some patients, perhaps\nmany, there is also damage to the immune system.\n\nWhile the term Long COVID refers to a set of symptoms whose exact causes are\nnot yet fully understood, the virus\u2019 underlying effects on the body are an\neven more common and insidious aspect of many COVID-19 infections. They can\nlead to a range of consequences including sudden severe events, loss of\nquality of life or a diminished lifespan (38). Some of these effects have been\nrecognized in the literature since 2020 and yet have been largely ignored.\nThere are many effects resulting from COVID-19 on bodily systems. Here we\ndiscuss evidence for five of these, the heart, brain, endothelial cells and\nblood vessels, endocrine system, and immune system (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Overview figure of effects of COVID and Long COVID on organ systems.\nCreated with Biorender.com.\n\n## The Heart\n\nAccording to work published recently (39), people infected with SARS-COV-2\nbetween March and November 2020 were shown to be at higher risk for heart\nattacks, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and deep vein thrombosis. In\nthis work, they followed over 7,500 people, both with and without pre-existing\nheart conditions. This was pre-vaccine and pre-omicron; however, data\npublished in May 2023 shows that after omicron, the risk is essentially as\nhigh as for alpha/delta, higher with delta and varied with the severity of\ninfection, but still present in those who experience a mild acute infection.\n(40)\n\nThe infected group was 40% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease when\ncompared to those uninfected. This group was also five times more likely to\ndie during the following 18 months when compared to those not reporting prior\nSARS-COV-2 infection. The risk of adverse outcomes, such as hospitalization or\ndeath, is significantly greater in cases of severe infection compared to mild\ninfection. However, it is important to note that even mild infections carry a\nhigher risk of complications and should not be taken lightly.\n\nThis was not a surprise as early work (41) on a cohort of 100 recovered German\npatients in 2020, one-third hospitalized and two-thirds recovered at home used\ncardiovascular magnetic imaging to show cardiac involvement in 78 patients\n(78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%). These were not\ndependent on preexisting conditions, disease severity and overall course of\nthe acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis.\n\nReduced blood oxygen or ischemia in the heart can cause acute myocardial\ninfarction (AMI) and stroke. This can result from disruption of underlying\nchronically inflamed atherosclerotic plaques, and this has been clearly shown\nto be a clinical complication of COVID-19 (42, 43). It has recently been\nestablished that SARS-CoV-2 infects coronary vessels, and thereby induces\ninflammation of the plaques. (44) These might trigger acute cardiovascular\ncomplications, and the chance of long-term cardiovascular risk is elevated.\nAMI and stroke can also result from other respiratory viral infections,\nincluding influenza virus. (45). It is important to note, however, that\npatients with COVID-19 are seven times more likely to have a stroke than\npatients after influenza (46) and the risk for either AMI or stroke is still\nelevated up to 1 year after infection. (9)\n\n## The Brain\n\nThere is now strong evidence that the SARS-COV-2 virus can enter the brain\nduring infection leading to damage, including loss of both gray and white\nmatter \u2013 impacting both the nerve cells and the support cells. The virus has\nbeen shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier that protects the brain. (47)\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the brain has been extensively studied, and some key\nfindings have been reviewed (48-52).\n\nSARS-COV-2 might enter via a damaged blood-brain barrier (53,54) as SARS-COV-2\ndamages endothelial cells (47,54) or it might enter from the nose via a nasal\nnanotube mechanism. (55) Peripheral inflammation has also been shown to lead\nto post-infection brain deficiency, probably via the release of cytokines.\n(56) Inflammation of the Vagus nerve has been observed to cause dysautonomia\nduring acute infection leading to disruption of the autonomic nervous system\nand affecting heartbeat, blood pressure, digestion, breathing, bladder\ncontrol, dental health, etc. (57) These all can occur during the entire\nspectrum of illness of COVID-19 from mild to severe.\n\nAcute infection can lead to direct changes in the brain resulting in losses in\nlearning/memory ability and cognition. (58,59) Significant neurologic and\npsychiatric outcomes of COVID-19 have been shown (60) including higher\nincidence of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, dementia, and\nmood/anxiety disorders. Cerebral blood flow is diminished during acute\nCOVID-19 infection. (47) The neurosymptoms of acute COVID-19 have been found\nto resolve in many patients, but magnetic resonance imaging has found that\nalterations can persist after 6 months in the amplitude of low-frequency\nfluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity in the right frontal, temporal,\nand occipital lobes of the brain. (61) Importantly, ALFF is a stable and\nreliable parameter to characterize intrinsic or spontaneous brain activity\nfound in various brain diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, posttraumatic\nstress disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. (62) There\nis evidence of dopaminergic senescence with SARS-COV-2 infection which bodes\npoorly for a number of neurodegenerative disorders. (63) Direct invasion of\nthe brain by SARS-COV-2 could lead to ORF3a expression, which has been shown\nto disrupt the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, impair sphingolipid homeostasis,\nand to drive neuropathogenesis including the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein. (64)\n\nThese acute and short-term remaining conditions are worrisome, but there are\nnow a number of studies that suggest that SARS-COV-2 is causing longer-term\ndamage via protein changes in the brain. In fact, the demarcation between\nacute COVID-19 and Long COVID is becoming blurred. The UK Biobank has\nconducted a magnetic resonance study on people aged between 51 to 81 years\nold, which revealed some concerning findings. Specifically, the study\nhighlighted a significant reduction in the thickness of gray matter in the\nbrain, as well as tissue contrast in two specific regions \u2013 the orbitofrontal\ncortex and parahippocampal gyrus. (65) They also saw a reduction in global\nbrain size in those having COVID-19 relative to controls. Post COVID-19\npatients also reported a greater cognitive decline approximately 6 months\nafter infection. A follow-up study indicates that although some patients seem\nto recover cognitively, patients with symptoms can have cognitive issues after\n2 years, suggesting an average 10-year increase in aging of the brain. (66)\n\nThe physical changes in the brain caused by SARS-COV-2 may take months or\nyears to become apparent. Evidence suggests that recovery can take years and\nmay not be complete. There is solid evidence that at least in severe\ninfections the same chemical structures found in the brains of\nneurodegenerative patients occur (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease). (67) A worrisome study has shown that Alzheimer\u2019s disease and\nCOVID-19 patients, adjusted for age and gender, show similar molecular and\ncellular changes. (68) It has been suggested that COVID-19 might well lead to\na higher predisposition of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia, (69) and those\nwith already existing dementia are more likely to see a more rapid progression\nfollowing SARS-COV-2 infection. (70) Similar circumstances have been observed\nfor Parkinson\u2019s disease. A very real possibility exists that we will see a\nmajor increase in neurodegenerative diseases in increasingly younger cohorts\nin the following decades after the pandemic. And, Long COVID incidence has not\nchanged with omicron, (71,72) indicating that the damage continues with new\nvariants and reinfections.\n\n## The Endothelium and Blood Vessels\n\nAlmost every pathological process during a COVID-19 infection and many in Long\nCOVID can be related to its effects on the endothelial cells in the\nvasculature. Endothelial cells form the barrier between blood or lymphatic\nsolution and the vessel walls controlling the flow of substances and fluid\ninto and out of a tissue. These cells are critical to all functions involving\ncirculation. SARS-COV-2 infection leads to elevated turnover of endothelial\ncells. (73) Data suggest that even for those who have had COVID-19 without\nsymptoms, there is damage to the endothelial tissues. (74-77)\n\nThe endothelium is a thin layer of cells that lines the inside of blood\nvessels, and it plays a significant role in maintaining vascular health. In\nCOVID-19 patients, the virus can invade and damage these endothelial cells.\nThis damage can lead to the rarefaction of vascular capillaries to become so\nminuscule that only a single red blood cell can pass through at a time.\nUnfortunately, this can also lead to the formation of microthrombi\u2014small blood\nclots that block or restrict blood flow in the capillaries. In severe\nCOVID-19, these microthrombi can form on a large scale which can lead to\nstroke or organ failure. In a 2021 review of 151 autopsies of those dying of\nCOVID-19 were considered, microthrombi in the lung were found in 73% (91\npatients), 11 % in the heart, 24% in the kidney, and 16 % in the liver. (76)\nHence, the observation of damage to endothelial cells in asymptomatic COVID-19\npatients (73) bodes poorly for the long-term impact of organ damage. This\ndamage is likely to go unnoticed at first but may be significant in the aging\nof organs and is likely to be increased with repeated infections.\n\n## The Endocrine System\n\nThe endocrine system is responsible for regulating hormones that control\nnumerous bodily functions, such as metabolism, immune response, stress\nresponse, and more. The endocrine system is complex, comprising hormone-\nproducing cells and organs that serve to maintain homeostasis and to modulate\nthe immune response to infections. Several studies have reported multiple\nendocrine and metabolic abnormalities following virus infections, such as\nhuman immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), (78) coxsackieviruses B, (79) and\nnow SARS-CoV-2. (80) Although many viral infections have been known to affect\nthe endocrine system, (81) the large number of infections and reinfections\nwith SARS-COV-2 makes understanding the impact of this infection on these\neffects important. COVID-19 can impact the endocrine system in several ways.\nFor example, SARS-COV-2 infection increases the possibility of incident\ndiabetes and antihyperglycemic use. (82) Endocrine diseases include adrenal\ninsufficiency, type 1 and 2 diabetes, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and thyroid disease.\n(83) The long list of effects of COVID-19 on the endocrine system includes the\nfollowing (80,84):\n\n1) Direct viral effects on endocrine tissues: ACE2 receptors, which the virus\nuses to enter human cells, are found in various endocrine organs like the\npancreas, thyroid, and adrenal glands. Infection of these tissues can\npotentially disrupt hormone production and regulation. One such outcome is\nGraves disease, (84) an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly\nattacks the thyroid gland. Reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may cause thyroid\ninflammation in some individuals. (85) This condition, known as De Quervain\u2019s\nthyroiditis, can lead to temporary thyroid dysfunction as well as thyroid\ntissue damage, which may affect individuals with or without preexisting\nautoimmune thyroid conditions like Graves\u2019 disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis.\nMore generally, COVID-19 has been associated with thyroid dysfunction,\nincluding both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, (86-88) which can have\nimportant health implications.\n\n2) Hyperinflammation including cytokine storms: During the acute phase of\ninfection COVID-19 can lead to an excessive immune response and\nhyperinflammation both short or long-term, which can negatively impact the\nfunction of several endocrine organs, such as the pituitary gland, (89)\nleading to long term hormone imbalances.\n\n3) Long-term metabolic changes: These can include glucose intolerance or a\ncompromised response to insulin in the body, potentially leading to the\ndevelopment of type 2 diabetes in adults, and in some cases insulin resistance\nleading to type 1 diabetes in children. (82) The virus may also affect the\nfunction of the pancreas, (90) where insulin is produced.\n\n4) Reproductive hormone changes: The impact of SARS on reproductive health is\nsignificant with reports indicating that the virus can temporarily disrupt\nmenstrual cycles in women (91) and impact fertility in both women and men.\n(92) But It can also lead to an increased risk of hypogonadism and erectile\ndysfunction, (93,94) negatively affecting sperm quality parameters, (95) and\ncrossing the placental barrier to infect and damage the placenta and fetus\npotentially several months following birth. (96-98) This can result in\nstillbirths, preeclampsia, fetal loss, and preterm birth. (99)\n\nIt is important to note that our understanding of how COVID-19 affects the\nendocrine system across the population is continuing to develop. However, the\nexistence of significant impacts is already apparent.\n\n## The Immune System\n\nThe immunology of COVID-19 and Long COVID have recently been reviewed. (13,21)\nImmune dysregulation is generally considered to be a manifestation of Long\nCOVID, and it occurs in patients after the full spectrum of illness from mild\nto severe COVID-19. However, Long COVID is usually defined by symptoms,\nwhereas immune dysregulation doesn\u2019t have distinctive symptoms on its own.\nHowever, it becomes apparent through recurrent infections. COVID-19 can\ndysregulate all the common aspects of the immune system. The duration of this\ndysregulation is still being investigated. The effects of COVID-19 are seen in\nT cells, (100) B cells, (101) dendritic cells, (102) monocytes, (103) and\nplatelets, (104) among others. This results in increased vulnerability to\nother infections, (105) for example a more than fourfold increase in risk for\nother viral infections. (12)\n\nCOVID-19 causes increased cellular turnover leading to aging of immune cells.\nThese cells have limitations in their proliferative capacity and have a\nlimited ability to divide and create new cells before cell division stops.\nSARS-COV-2 has been found to have detrimental effects on the length of cells\u2019\ntelomeres, which are essential for cell proliferation. With each cell\ndivision, these telomeres are effectively shortened, potentially leading to\naccelerated aging and a higher risk of developing various diseases. T cell\nproduction is dependent on telomere length and these shorten naturally with\nage. Thus, the elderly have shorter telomeres. After SARS-COV-2 infection,\nthese telomeres are also shorter. (106,107) This could explain why older\nadults appear to be more susceptible to reinfection following a SARS-COV-2\ninfection. (108)\n\nViral persistence can lead to a variety of damaging effects on the immune\nsystem. A new preprint provides good evidence that even people who are\nasymptomatic after SARS-COV-2 infection have signs of immune activation that\nlocalize in areas of the body from which one can identify the virus up to two\nyears after infection. (109) These include the brain stem, spinal cord, bone\nmarrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and\ngut wall. These data suggest that Long COVID and acute COVID-19 are not\ndifferent entities, but the same infection at different levels of severity and\nlongevity. (110)\n\nImplications of these findings are that several forms of damage lead to a\ncondition similar to accelerated aging, with telomeres, mitochondria, the\nnervous, vascular, endocrine and immune system all showing decreased capacity\nand resilience. Increases in heart and neuro-inflammation can be caused by\nthese long-lasting immune effects. In essence, this is accelerated aging of\nthe tissues. Instead of being predominantly found in the elderly, in the near\nfuture T-cell controlled illnesses might move to middle age, even more so for\nimmunocompromised individuals, dramatically reducing lifespan.\n\n## Other Organs and Systems\n\nLungs: COVID-19 often begins with respiratory symptoms, and severe cases can\nlead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. An impact on pulmonary function\ncontinues for one fourth of COVID-19 patients, who have impairment of\npulmonary function a year after illness. (33) Fibrosis and scarring of lung\ntissue can lead to chronic respiratory impairment, including but much more\nwidespread than recognized Long COVID respiratory symptoms.\n\nKidneys: Kidney damage and acute kidney injury have been observed in Long\nCOVID patients. (111) Prolonged kidney dysfunction can lead to chronic kidney\ndisease, which may require ongoing medical management or dialysis, and can\nhave severe consequences if it cannot be controlled effectively.\n\nIntestines: SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells in the intestines, and some COVID-19\npatients experience gastrointestinal symptoms. (112) There is ongoing research\ninto potential long-term gastrointestinal complications and impacts on the gut\nmicrobiome. (113)\n\nBlood: The SARS-COV-2 virus has been associated with protein changes and long-\nstanding blood changes including microclots in many patients. (114-116)\n\nCOVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 adversely affects nearly every organ in the body\nincluding also the skin, (117) the eyes, (118) the ears, (119) etc.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe importance of Long COVID symptoms impacting many millions around the world\nis gaining recognition. (120) While symptomatic Long COVID affects 10-30% of\nthose infected, and its widespread impact is great enough to affect\nmacroeconomic conditions, (121) it is only part of the long-term consequences\nof SARS-COV-2 infections. Varied levels of organ damage from COVID-19 have\nbeen shown to occur in over 50% of those infected. Organ damage leads to\nreduced functional capacity and physiological reserve of organs that is\nconsistent with reduced health, reduced life expectancy, and increased\nvulnerability to future infections and conditions. It is also manifest in\nacute events such as heart attacks, strokes, as well as recurrent infections\nof other kinds. Organ damage is an important substrate for Long COVID\nsymptoms, and the symptoms of Long COVID may be considered the tip of the\niceberg of multisystem and organ damage manifestations. What is important to\nrecognize is that even the known severe consequences of Long COVID are only\npart of the long-term consequences of COVID-19. It is crucial to acknowledge\nthat SARS-CoV-2 poses significant threats that are further exacerbated by\nreinfections, resulting in a detrimental impact on various aspects of health.\nAs we continue to study these impacts to better address them we must take\npreventive measures to avoid repeated infections.
