Slowly, the debris coalesced, cooled and\nsolidified, forming our moon. This scenario of how the Earth's moon came to be\nis the one largely agreed upon by most scientists. But the details of how\nexactly that happened are \"more of a choose-your-own-adventure novel,\"\naccording to researchers in the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary\nLaboratory who published a paper in Nature Geoscience.\n\nThe findings offer important insights into the evolution of the lunar\ninterior, and potentially for planets such as the Earth or Mars.\n\nMost of what is known about the origin of the moon comes from analyses of rock\nsamples, collected by Apollo astronauts more than 50 years ago, combined with\ntheoretical models. The samples of basaltic lava rocks brought back from the\nmoon showed surprisingly high concentrations of titanium. Later satellite\nobservations found that these titanium-rich volcanic rocks are primarily\nlocated on the moon's nearside, but how and why they got there has remained a\nmystery\u2014until now.\n\nBecause the moon formed fast and hot, it was likely covered by a global magma\nocean. As the molten rock gradually cooled and solidified, it formed the\nmoon's mantle and the bright crust we see when we look up at a full moon at\nnight. But deeper below the surface, the young moon was wildly out of\nequilibrium. Models suggest that the last dregs of the magma ocean\ncrystallized into dense minerals including ilmenite, a mineral containing\ntitanium and iron.\n\n\"Because these heavy minerals are denser than the mantle underneath, it\ncreates a gravitational instability, and you would expect this layer to sink\ndeeper into the moon's interior,\" said Weigang Liang, who led the research as\npart of his doctoral work at LPL.\n\nSomehow, in the millennia that followed, that dense material did sink into the\ninterior, mixed with the mantle, melted and returned to the surface as\ntitanium-rich lava flows that we see on the surface today.\n\n\"Our moon literally turned itself inside out,\" said co-author and LPL\nassociate professor Jeff Andrews-Hanna. \"But there has been little physical\nevidence to shed light on the exact sequence of events during this critical\nphase of lunar history, and there is a lot of disagreement in the details of\nwhat went down\u2014literally.\"\n\nDid this material sink as it formed a little at a time, or all at once after\nthe moon had fully solidified? Did it sink into the interior globally and then\nrise up on the near side, or did it migrate to the near side and then sink?\nDid it sink in one big blob, or several smaller blobs?\n\nThe lunar near side with its dark regions, or \"mare,\" covered by titanium-rich\nvolcanic flows (center) makes up the moon's familiar sight from Earth (left).\nThe mare region is surrounded by a polygonal pattern of linear gravity\nanomalies (blue in image on the right) interpreted to be the vestiges of dense\nmaterial that sank into the interior. Their presence provides the first\nphysical evidence for the nature of the global mantle overturn more than 4\nbillion years ago.

Each model holds profound\nimplications for the geologic evolution of our moon,\" said co-lead author\nAdrien Broquet of the German Aerospace Center in Berlin, who did the work\nduring his time as a postdoctoral research associate at LPL.\n\nIn a previous study, led by Nan Zhang at Peking University in Beijing, who is\nalso a co-author on the latest paper, models predicted that the dense layer of\ntitanium-rich material beneath the crust first migrated to the near side of\nthe moon, possibly triggered by a giant impact on the far side, and then sunk\ninto the interior in a network of sheetlike slabs, cascading into the lunar\ninterior almost like waterfalls. But when that material sank, it left behind a\nsmall remnant in a geometric pattern of intersecting linear bodies of dense\ntitanium-rich material beneath the crust.\n\n\"When we saw those model predictions, it was like a lightbulb went on,\" said\nAndrews-Hanna, \"because we see the exact same pattern when we look at subtle\nvariations in the moon's gravity field, revealing a network of dense material\nlurking below the crust.\"\n\nIn the new study, the authors compared simulations of a sinking ilmenite-rich\nlayer to a set of linear gravity anomalies detected by NASA's GRAIL mission,\nwhose two spacecraft orbited the moon between 2011 and 2012, measuring tiny\nvariations in its gravitational pull. These linear anomalies surround a vast\ndark region of the lunar near side covered by volcanic flows known as mare\n(Latin for \"sea\").\n\nThe authors found that the gravity signatures measured by the GRAIL mission\nare consistent with ilmenite layer simulations, and that the gravity field can\nbe used to map out the distribution of the ilmenite remnants left after the\nsinking of the majority of the dense layer.\n\n\"Our analyses show that the models and data are telling one remarkably\nconsistent story,\" Liang said. \"Ilmenite materials migrated to the near side\nand sunk into the interior in sheetlike cascades, leaving behind a vestige\nthat causes anomalies in the moon's gravity field, as seen by GRAIL.\"\n\nThe team's observations also constrain the timing of this event: The linear\ngravity anomalies are interrupted by the largest and oldest impact basins on\nthe near side and therefore must have formed earlier. Based on these cross-\ncutting relationships, the authors suggest that the ilmenite-rich layer sank\nprior to 4.22 billion years ago, which is consistent with it contributing to\nlater volcanism seen on the lunar surface.\n\n\"Analyzing these variations in the moon's gravity field allowed us to peek\nunder the moon's surface and see what lies beneath,\" said Broquet, who worked\nwith Liang to show that the anomalies in the moon's gravitational field match\nwhat would be expected for the zones of dense titanium-rich material predicted\nby computer simulation models of lunar overturn.\n\nMore than 50 years ago, Apollo astronauts brought basaltic lava rocks back\nfrom the moon with surprisingly high concentrations of titanium. Later,\nsatellite observations found that these titanium-rich volcanic rocks are\nprimarily located on the moon's nearside - but how and why they got there has\nremained a mystery \u2013 until now. Credit: NASA\n\nLopsided moon\n\nWhile the detection of lunar gravity anomalies provides evidence for the\nsinking of a dense layer in the moon's interior and allows for a more precise\nestimate of how and when this event occurred, what we see on the surface of\nthe moon adds even more intrigue to the story, according to the research team.\n\n\"The moon is fundamentally lopsided in every respect,\" Andrews-Hanna said,\nexplaining that the near side facing the Earth, and particularly the dark\nregion known as Oceanus Procellarum region, is lower in elevation, has a\nthinner crust, is largely covered in lava flows, and has high concentrations\nof typically rare elements like titanium and thorium.\n\nThe far side differs in each of these respects. Somehow, the overturn of the\nlunar mantle is thought to be related to the unique structure and history of\nthe near side Procellarum region. But the details of that overturn have been a\nmatter of considerable debate among scientists.\n\n\"Our work connects the dots between the geophysical evidence for the interior\nstructure of the moon and computer models of its evolution,\" Liang added.\n\n\"For the first time we have physical evidence showing us what was happening in\nthe moon's interior during this critical stage in its evolution, and that's\nreally exciting,\" Andrews-Hanna said. \"It turns out that the moon's earliest\nhistory is written below the surface, and it just took the right combination\nof models and data to unveil that story.\"\n\n\"The vestiges of early lunar evolution are present below the crust today,\nwhich is mesmerizing,\" Broquet said. \"Future missions, such as with a seismic\nnetwork, would allow a better investigation of the geometry of these\nstructures.\"\n\nLiang added, \"When the Artemis astronauts eventually land on the moon to begin\na new era of human exploration, we will have a very different understanding of\nour neighbor than we did when the Apollo astronauts first set foot on it.\"\n\nMore information: Adrien Broquet, Vestiges of a lunar ilmenite layer following\nmantle overturn revealed by gravity data, Nature Geoscience (2024).
