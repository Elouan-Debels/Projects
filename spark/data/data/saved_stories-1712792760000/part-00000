Vaughan-Nichols\n\nVOXPOP\n\nTry our new 5 second poll. It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nHow to Optimize AI?\n\nWhich is most important for AI workloads: computational performance, cost or\nportability?\n\nComputational performance\n\nCost\n\nPortability\n\nNo preference\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nTetrate, a company focused on simplifying Istio and Envoy for enterprise use,\nhas announced the general availability (GA) of Tetrate Enterprise Gateway for\nEnvoy (TEG). This release provides businesses with a modern and secure\nalternative to traditional Ingress controllers within Kubernetes environments.\n\nYears in the making, this commercial version of the Envoy reverse proxy open-\nsource project enables it to be used as a network gateway. This allows it to\nbe used to direct internal microservices traffic and to manage external\ntraffic coming into a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThis project is built on top of the recent Envoy community\u2019s release of Envoy\nGateway version 1.0. TEG extends its features by including cross-cluster\nservice discovery and load balancing, OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth2, Web\nApplication Firewall (WAF), and rate limiting out of the box along with\nFederal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 compliance.\n\nA standout feature of the Envoy Gateway, and by extension TEG, is its native\nsupport for the newly introduced Kubernetes Gateway API. This modern API\nsupersedes the older Ingress resource, offering a more expressive and\nextensible approach to handling ingress in Kubernetes.\n\nTEG is easy to use \u2014 in so much as anything Kubernetes-related is easy to use!\n\u2014 with a quick start path and simple operations once you\u2019re in production.\nIt\u2019s powered by a fully upstream Application Programming Interface (API) set\nfor consistency and stability.\n\nVarun Talwar, Tetrate\u2019s co-founder, underscored the significance of this\nrelease, stating, \u201cTetrate is the first to deliver a simple, standardized, and\npowerful Envoy Gateway offering for the enterprise.\u201d He highlighted the\nreadiness of Envoy Gateway 1.0 and TEG for production use within Kubernetes\nenvironments, promising a future where developers are unshackled from the\nlimitations of outdated ingress options.\n\nChris Aniszczyk, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) CTO added, \u201cThe\nwork of committed community members in bringing projects to production\nreadiness is key to open source sustainability and to delivering value for end\nusers has played an instrumental role in making Envoy Gateway production-ready\nfor Kubernetes and the wider ecosystem. We\u2019re encouraged about what the future\nholds for both the project and for Kubernetes users who will deploy it as a\nmodern standard to ingress.\u201d\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

TAYGA: Bridge an IPv6 Network Back to IPv4 using NAT64\n\nMind you, Tetrate isn\u2019t the only company embracing Gateway in its releases.\nWhile Linkerd boasts of its ability to add a \u201cgateway-less\u201d mode for cross-\ncluster communication in Linkerd 2.14, it has also adopted the Gateway API.\nLinkerd claims it\u2019s been at the forefront of adopting Kubernetes\u2019s new Gateway\nAPI as the core configuration mechanism.\n\nWhich of these and other rival companies will become the market leader? Stay\ntuned.\n\nIn the meantime, this release extends Tetrate\u2019s product line, which includes\nthe Tetrate Istio Subscription, Tetrate Service Express, and Tetrate Service\nBridge, fortifying its position as a leader in enabling Kubernetes adopters to\nmodernize their ingress systems with state-of-the-art, open-standard\nsolutions.\n\nSteven J.
