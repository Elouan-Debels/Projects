I recently decided to leave my current full-time job, and I\u2019ll be working on CCL again. This is probably an imprudent thing for me to do, but you only live once, right? I don\u2019t want to share details (funding, etc.) with the whole world, but it\u2019s looking like I\u2019ll be able to work about half-time on an ARM64 port. Please write me privately if you want to talk about supporting that ARM64 work. I've worked on CCL for quite a few years, and I did the 32-bit x86 port, so I have experience in this area. I\u2019m not as good a hacker as Gary Byers, but then again, few people are. There are lots of issues and challenges ahead, but I\u2019m not ready to have a funeral for CCL just yet.\n\n  * Previous message (by thread): [Openmcl-devel] CCL on Apple Silicon\n  * Next message (by thread): [Openmcl-devel] CCL on Apple Silicon\n  * Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]\n\nMore information about the Openmcl-devel mailing list\n\n", "frontpage": false}
