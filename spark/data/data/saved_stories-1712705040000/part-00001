OpenSSL\n3.2 focused on QUIC client support while for OpenSSL 3.3 there is more work on\nthe QUIC server-side. Details on the current QUIC HTTP/3 support in OpenSSL\ncan be found via this documentation page.\n\nAmong the changes to find with OpenSSL 3.3 are:\n\n\\- Support for qlogc for tracing QUIC connections.\n\n\\- Many new APIs around QUIC connections and working on multi-stream QUIC\nserver support.\n\n\\- AES-GCM unroll8 optimization for the Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100.\n\n\\- Optimized AES-CTR for ARM Neoverse V1 and V2 processors.\n\n\\- AES and SHA3 optimizations for the Apple Silicon M3.\n\n\\- Assembly implementation for MD5 on LoongArch64.\n\nDownloads and more details on the OpenSSL 3.3 release via GitHub.\n\n1 Comment\n\nTweet\n\nRelated News\n\nx86-64-v5?
