A second X-ray is then taken to check the\nballoon is full and sitting well in the stomach. The tube is then removed.\n\nThe treatment lasts for four months after which a valve opens and the balloon\nempties and naturally passes through the body.\n\nUnlike other gastric balloons available on the NHS, it requires no surgery,\nendoscopy or anaesthesia.\n\nTwo patients received the treatment in November last year at Musgrove Park\nhospital, part of Somerset NHS foundation trust, and a further three patients\nare due to receive the treatment in February at the same trust.\n\nAllurion, the company that manufactures the device, says it is in discussion\nwith other NHS trusts to roll out the treatment more widely.\n\nSwallowable gastric balloons have been described as an effective treatment for\nobesity, with previous studies suggesting that it could help patients to lose\naround a third of excess body weight.\n\nProf Richard Welbourn, consultant bariatric surgeon at Somerset NHS foundation\ntrust, said: \u201cWe are very pleased to be able to offer this new treatment, a\nfirst for the NHS, that offers clinically meaningful weight loss as part of a\nholistic programme involving dietary support and care.\n\n\u201cPeople with severe obesity are prone to diseases, such as type 2 diabetes,\nwhich can be reversed with weight loss.\n\n\u201cThe Allurion balloon is a 15-minute outpatient procedure, and is swallowed,\nso there\u2019s no need for an endoscopy, hospital bed, theatre time or\nanaesthetic, which is better for the NHS and a much-improved experience for\nour patients.\n\n\u201cWe expect that patients using the programme will lose 10-15% of their weight\nin four months, which improves quality of life and makes patients healthier.\u201d\n\nDr Shantanu Gaur, the founder and chief executive of Allurion, said: \u201cWe are\nthrilled to be partnering with the NHS for the first time to deliver the\nAllurion programme.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to expanding this partnership and benefiting many more\nNHS patients in the months and years to come.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * NHS\n  * Health\n  * England\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: ministers doing \u2018next to nothing\u2019 to tackle obesity\n\n10 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### More than a billion people worldwide are obese, research finds\n\n29 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Obesity drug boom pushes Novo Nordisk shares to record high\n\n31 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Cost of people being overweight in UK now \u00a398bn, study finds\n\n4 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### AstraZeneca makes big push into weight-loss market with obesity pill deal\n\n9 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### Sales soar at Danish firm behind weight-loss drug semaglutide\n\n2 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### Cap UK\u2019s sugar supply to fight obesity, say campaigners\n\n28 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk becomes Europe\u2019s most valuable firm\n\n5 Sept 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
