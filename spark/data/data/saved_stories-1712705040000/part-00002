It can become one by uplifting one university\nthat\u2019s already here\n\nExpanding UCSF into a full university with law, science and engineering\nprograms would attract talent and boost SF\u2019s economy, Evan Zimmerman says\n\nAI illustration by Jesse Rogala/The Standard\n\n## By Evan Zimmerman\n\n## Share\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Telegram\n\n  * WhatsApp\n\n  * Reddit\n\nPublished Apr. 09, 2024 \u2022 7:00am\n\nSan Francisco has been many things throughout its history, but it\u2019s never been\nknown as a college town. Now the city has an opportunity to make it happen.\n\nLast May, Mayor London Breed asked the University of California Regents to\nconsider opening a San Francisco campus to help support San Francisco\u2019s\nflagging downtown. It\u2019s a great idea, and the UC Regents look like they might\nanswer Breed\u2019s prayers. UC\u2019s plans are still up in the air, but the current\nproposals are unambitious tinkering. What San Francisco needs, and deserves,\nis a whole new university.\n\nThe solution is staring us in the face: UCSF, which today focuses only on\ngraduate-level medicine and biology, can quickly become the MIT of the West if\nit becomes a full university. UCSF is already the second-largest public\nemployer in the Bay Area and home to seven Nobel Prize winners. UC could build\non its successful brand instead of risking it all on a brand-new venture. It\nis the only way to achieve Breed\u2019s goal of 30,000 new downtown residents, and\nit would be much faster than starting from scratch. It is the only viable\napproach.\n\nGrafting new schools onto existing, successful schools works; starting from\nnothing doesn\u2019t. Take UC Irvine Law School. When UC decided to create the\nfirst new major law school in more than 40 years, officials did not create a\nstand-alone school. Instead, they recruited the esteemed Erwin Chemerinsky to\nlaunch it and placed it in an already high-performing campus. He got it\noperating in less than two years, and it was ranked #28 in the country when he\nleft.\n\nCompare that with the creation of UC Merced. The decision to start a new UC\nwas made decades ago, but the 1988 resolution did not turn into a university\nopen for business until 2006. Worse, it wasn\u2019t worth the wait. UC Merced is\nthe least prestigious UC campus and has the lowest enrollment.\n\nBy starting with a system that\u2019s already working, the new UCSF would have a\nhead start. It\u2019s already a powerhouse in biotech. The question would be what\nto do next and how to do it quickly.\n\nThe first obvious act would be to merge with the UC Law School SF, which would\nbecome UCSF Law. It is a California law and policy success story despite being\nperhaps the only prestigious law school in the country that is not connected\nto a major university. Adding it to the UCSF portfolio would be mutually\nbeneficial, helping to scale the new UCSF without the effort of creating a new\nschool while providing additional resources (and a better name) to the new\nUCSF Law.\n\nWith that strong base, the clear next step for an enlarged UCSF would be\nexpanding its graduate science programs. It is both the closest to what UCSF\ndoes now and the path of least resistance to state funding. Most importantly,\nUCSF\u2019s biology chops would lend it the credibility to recruit talent and\ninstantly lead in other fields: quantum computing, aerospace, artificial\nintelligence, semiconductors and more. UCSF would be building on its base\ninstead of chasing undergraduate humanities that are not its core competency\n(but are the province of Berkeley and Stanford).\n\nA science- and engineering-focused undergraduate program would be new for\nUCSF, which is why it should come second. To stand out, UCSF would need a\nstrong differentiator beyond merely relying on its prestigious brand. Here is\none clear way: UCSF can provide the most competitive co-op program in the\nworld, embedding students in workplaces while they\u2019re still in school. Because\nUCSF is in the world mecca of high technology, it can design programs with top\ncompanies, as is done in Asia, where companies like TSMC and Samsung work with\nlocal universities to design coursework, and place students in envy-worthy\njobs like the legendary University of Waterloo program in Canada. Imagine\nproducing elite graduates with practical experience while also creating\nworking-class jobs that support the local manufacturing sector.\n\nA new university would bring a lot of benefits to San Francisco. Colleges are\ninherently in-person and add a level of stability, regardless of the future of\nwork-from-home. There is no talk of a doom loop in Berkeley or Palo Alto.\nFurthermore, universities have a network effect: Harvard and MIT gave Boston\nthe Broad Institute and Watertown. Imagine the cluster of UC Berkeley, a newly\nfull UCSF and Stanford. It would be unbeatable.\n\nAlthough this wouldn\u2019t be cheap, it is the cheapest option. UC Irvine Law\nstarted with a $20 million donation; UC Merced spent many times that. By\nstarting with UCSF, UC can build off existing physical and intellectual\ninfrastructure and acquire empty buildings downtown. What\u2019s more, big costs\nmatter less if you can attract big dollars, and UCSF has no difficulty\nattracting huge donations thanks to its successful brand and illustrious\nalumni. Plus, by focusing on science and engineering, UCSF can partially fund\nits expansion with grants from institutions like the National Science\nFoundation and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe alternatives are non-starters. According to UC Law SF\u2019s David Faigman\n(wouldn\u2019t that sound better as \u201cUCSF Law\u2019s David Faigman\u201d?), opening a totally\nde novo university in five years would be \u201cheroic\u201d and doing it in less than a\ndecade would be \u201csurprising.\u201d Way too slow.\n\nThe other main proposals involve merely creating housing for other\nuniversities. Although those ideas would be fast, they would merely bring\nhundreds of students, not the tens of thousands San Francisco needs. Plus,\nBerkeley is across the bay and Stanford is about 45 minutes away, making mere\nhousing unappealing to students.\n\nThose limited ideas ignore the fact that San Francisco is a global city that\ndeserves a flagship university. Instead of reinventing the wheel, let\u2019s just\nscale up what we already have for the future it is destined to fulfill:\nCreating one of the greatest universities on Earth.\n\nEvan Zimmerman is based in the Bay Area and the founder of Edge, a Y\nCombinator-backed startup that uses AI to help patent practitioners write\npatents.\n\nWe\u2019d like to hear what you think about this or any of our opinion articles.\nYou can email us at opinion@sfstandard.com.
