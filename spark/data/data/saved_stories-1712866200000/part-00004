If you need help\nfinding a clinical trial or you\u2019d like to get in touch to talk more about how\nwe can make this process better please reach out to DrBStillman@gmail.com. I\u2019d\nlove to talk.\n\nMy husband Jake is dying of recurrent / metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (R\n/ M HNSCC), and he\u2019s exhausted conventional treatments, so his only chance at\nsurvival is a miracle clinical trial drug. But what clinical trial might save\nhim? How do we find it? Those are the question we\u2019ve been trying to answer\nsince learning on July 21 that he has eight new tumors in his neck and lungs.\nFinding the right clinical trial is literally a life, or more likely death,\nissue for Jake. Despite the stakes, from the patient\u2019s perspective, the\nclinical trial process is impressively broken, obtuse and confusing, and one\nthat I gather no one likes: patients don\u2019t, their families don\u2019t, hospitals\nand oncologists who run the clinical trials don\u2019t, drug companies must not,\nand the people who die while waiting to get into a trial probably don\u2019t. I\nguess the dead don\u2019t have preferences, but I\u2019m going to assume they\u2019d rather\nbe living. Per Judy Seward, head of clinical trial experience at Pfizer, only\n8% of adult cancer patients take part in trials. Given our recent experience,\nI\u2019m amazed it\u2019s that many.\n\nThe median patient with R / M HNSCC lives about twelve months after diagnosis.\nIf you count Jake\u2019s diagnosis as happening in April 2023, you can do the math\non his probable survival time. Jake\u2019s cancer, however, is uncommonly fast and\naggressive, and so, in the absence of a clinical trial drug that works, he\nmight die at any time. The path from \u201ca clinical trial drug is our only hope\u201d\nto having a drug injected into his arm has been Herculean. Although I\u2019m a\ndoctor, I\u2019ve been stymied by the clinical trial process. I love Jake, probably\nmore than it\u2019s advisable to love anyone, but love isn\u2019t a treatment for R / M\nHNSCC (If correlation were causation, my love might actually be clinically\ndeleterious).\n\nI\u2019m writing this partly as a guide for other people in our position: people\nwho want to take their best shot at prolonging their own lives, or the lives\nof their loved ones. But this guide is for a wider audience, too: policymakers\nor others who might have the power to revise the process and make it more sane\nthan it is now, doctors (especially oncologists), and anyone who wants to\nunderstand why we seem perpetually on the brink of medical breakthroughs that\nare painfully slow to actually be implemented. The FDA\u2019s invisible graveyard\nis filled with people who could be benefitting from trials and their results.\nWe should all care that the primary process for bringing new and necessary\ntreatments for serious diseases from the lab to the exam room is broken. I\nwish I could make this guide shorter, but the process is complex and doing\nwrong increases the likelihood of fatality, so I\u2019ve erred on the side of\nthoroughness.\n\nStarting the search: Canvassing Physicians\n\nThe process of finding a clinical trial started July 21, the evening we\nlearned about Jake\u2019s cancer recurrence. We sent a MyChart message to his\nsluggish Mayo oncologist, and he called us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019d hoped,\u201d he said, stating the stunningly obvious\u2014in his\ndefense, though, \u201cfatal cancer recurrence\u201d is one of these situations where\nwords are inadequate. \u201cBut you\u2019re scheduled for chemo on Monday, and so we\nhave a plan.\u201d\n\nWe knew, from reading the R / M HNSCC literature, that chemo is only\npalliative and would at best delay death by a few months.\n\nThat was a plan?\n\nHe went on: \u201cIf you want, we can discuss clinical trials at a later date. I\u2019ll\nhave my PA see what\u2019s available and get back to you.\u201d\n\nWhat a strange thing to say to someone who rapidly grew eight new tumors over\nthe course of a month: that there will be time to discuss later. When was\nlater? \u201cLater\u201d was what we didn\u2019t have. For weeks, that was the extent of the\nconversation.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t our first experience with the oncologist\u2019s lackadaisical approach\nto cancer care, so I\u2019d already been in touch via desperate Facebook messages\nto online physician communities, and I\u2019d begun sending emails to other\noncologists who had been recommended to me in those conversations. A few of\nthem had previously discussed post-surgical treatment options with us.\nAlthough the average patient doesn\u2019t have this ability, one benefit of being a\nphysician is casual access to other physicians. Most professions, including\nmine, have a kind of favor bank, and I know that one day I\u2019m going to get a\nmessage from an oncologist who needs something from an ER doc, or the ER doc\nnetwork.\n\nEven with this vast network, making progress was and is incredibly difficult.\nIf we can hardly manage it, I don\u2019t know how a regular patient does. My sense\nis that, largely, lacking outside guidance, they don\u2019t. Since the day of\nJake\u2019s initial recurrence, I\u2019ve been frantically begging for the second\nopinions that would have taken weeks to otherwise schedule, or plane flights\nto our-of-state research centers. For most people, I think they run out of\ntime and energy to pursue possible clinical trials and thus don\u2019t wind up in\ntrials, or wind up in sub-optimal ones.\n\nThe online responses from physicians in doctor groups were helpful, but often\nvague; I\u2019d hoped that a head and neck oncologist would recommend a specific\ntrial, preferably one that they could refer us to. But most docs didn\u2019t know\nof a specific trial, so they recommended large research institutions they\nthought had a good reputation for hard cases. Others took Jake\u2019s clinical\ninformation (which I\u2019d posted with his permission: this was an emergency) and\nstarted a clinical trial search on clinicaltrial.gov, and they posted the top\nfive findings. There were maybe ten such responses, and, ominously, none\nlisted the same trials.\n\nHow is it that ten doctors can put in the same basic, relevant clinical data\ninto an engine meant to list and search for all existing clinical trials, only\nfor no two to surface the same study?\n\nIf you can answer this question, then you\u2019ve interacted with\nClinicalTrials.gov. If you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s a government-based website, so\nperhaps it shouldn\u2019t be so surprising that it\u2019s clunky, inefficient, and\nfrustrating.\n\nContinuing the search: Clinicaltrials.gov\n\nAs of the writing of this essay, if you go to Clinicaltrials.gov and search\nfor Jake\u2019s condition, you\u2019ll get something like this:\n\n2,500 studies! That isn\u2019t helpful. We can narrow the results somewhat:\n\nAround 751 studies is still too hard. Shoot. And if you change the wording of\nthe search subtly, you\u2019ll get different outcomes: searches for \u201cSquamous cell\ncarcinoma of the head and neck,\u201d \u201cHead and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,\u201d\n\u201cSquamous Cell Carcinoma of the tongue,\u201d \u201cTongue Squamous Cell Cancer\u201d all\nyield different results. There\u2019s no apparent standardization.\n\nSome example \u201ccondition or disease\u201d searches and their results (with no other\nadditional search terms):\n\n  * Head and neck cancer: 6,895 studies\n\n  * Cancer of the Head and Neck: 4,283 studies\n\n  * HNSCC: 1,532 studies\n\n  * Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Tongue: 106 studies\n\n  * Tongue Cancers: 152 studies\n\n  * Oral Cavity SCC: 661 studies\n\n  * SCC of the Oral Cavity: 31 studies\n\nThere\u2019s no apparent (the word \u201capparent\u201d will appear a lot) correlation\nbetween studies that would be best for Jake and the order in which they\u2019re\nlisted. Adding more search terms will narrow the number of studies, but,\nbecause there\u2019s no standardized way for researchers to choose multiple\nkeywords for their studies, I\u2019m narrowing the field to studies where the\nperson filling in the study information online randomly decided to list\nmultiple keywords.\n\nThen, when I did select a handful of studies, how was I supposed to evaluate\nif nivolumab, RAPA-101, BCA 101 or MCLA-158 was ideal? Oh, and the name of the\ndrug and the acronym assigned to it in the trial were frequently different,\nconfounding further Google Scholar searches. For example, \u201cMCLA-158\u201d is the\nsame thing as \u201cPetosemtamab.\u201d Of course! Why wouldn\u2019t it be?\n\nI have a background in biochemistry, so I understood the difference between a\nbispecific antibody, an immunotherapy, and a targeted molecule\u2014but not what\nthose differences meant for Jake\u2019s cancer, or all the relevant up-to-date\nliterature on the matter.\n\nEach study has different eligibility criteria, and eligibility criteria\u2014like\nkeywords\u2014aren\u2019t standardized so that they can be easily searched across\nstudies. Instead, the information page for each study outlines unique\ninclusion and exclusion criteria. Many have overlapping inclusion and\nexclusion criteria, but there can be long lists of additional criteria for\neach arm of a study, and it\u2019s up to the patient or their doctor to read\nthrough them line by line to see if prior medications, current medications,\ncertain genomic sequencing findings, numbers of lines of therapy, etc. makes\nthe trial relevant.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to find a dress to my exact specifications out of thousands on\nH&M,com than it is to find a clinical trial. I can open a search bar, click\n\u201cdress,\u201d select my material from another click box (Which allows me to select\nfrom the same options the people listing the garments chose from), then click\non the boxes for my desired color, dry clean or machine wash, fabric, finish,\nclosure, and any other number of pre-selected categories before adding\nadditional search keywords. I find a handful of options all relevant to my\ndesires within a matter of minutes. And a dress isn\u2019t life or death.\n\nI quickly tested my theory: A search for \u201cdress\u201d showed 2,156 options.\n\nFilters (finally, checkboxes!) were chosen: party dress, gold, sequin, long\nsleeve, a-line cut. Here are my 2 matches fitting my exact (if somewhat weird)\nspecifications:\n\nSomeone get their web developer a government contract...\n\nThe most important decision of our lives seemed impossible to adequately\nevaluate based on the primary method we had to research options. I went back\nonline hoping that the physicians who had given us lists of potential studies\nfor Jake knew more about how to optimize the search than I did.\n\nEach study on clinicaltrials.gov has a unique \u201cNCT\u201d number, which is sometimes\ncalled the ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier. I opened an Excel spreadsheet, made\na list of 50 NCT codes offered by other doctors, and, 20 hours later, had read\nthrough each trial, compared Jake\u2019s medical data to the inclusion and\nexclusion criteria and searched google scholar and PubMed for any information\nabout the trial drug, so that I could make some basic judgments about whether\nor not the trial was a good fit for Jake. Or even a potential fit.\n\nFifty down, 700 to go. Continuing at this rate, I would complete a\ncomprehensive review of options within 108.3 days, blowing past Jake\u2019s\nestimated life expectancy. In a not-very-research-appropriate fit of pique, I\ncried at the keyboard. I imagined myself at Jake\u2019s funeral, still sifting\nthrough NCTs, the sound of his oncologist\u2019s voice in my head asking if we\nwanted to discuss options, or if we\u2019d already decided \u201cwhat we wanted to do.\u201d\n\nWhat I wanted to do was to keep having a meltdown, but there wasn\u2019t time. I\ncalled an oncologist we\u2019d seen earlier for a second opinion, hoping a real-\ntime conversation would get us somewhere. \u201cI\u2019d go to M.D. Anderson in Houston,\nbecause they do a lot of trials,\u201d he said. Which trials? He didn\u2019t know, but\nhe repeated that M.D. Anderson does a lot of trials, so they would have\noptions he didn\u2019t at Banner Hospital (a local, Arizona outpost of MD Anderson,\nwhich operates independently from the Houston mothership). Were M.D.\nAnderson\u2019s trials the right options? He told us that the oncologists at M.D.\nAnderson Houston wouldn\u2019t review the trial options with us until we had an\nofficial in-person visit, which could take weeks to schedule, and he couldn\u2019t\ntell us what was available, because he didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t have access to\nHouston\u2019s study databases.\n\nI called another doctor we\u2019d seen, named Katherine Price, who is at Mayo\nRochester. She reviewed Jake\u2019s case and was (and is) incredibly helpful\u2014one of\nthe heroes of this story. She said: \u201cI know UC\u2014San Diego Medical Center and\nMemorial-Sloan Kettering [MSK] in New York both do a lot of trials. I\u2019ll reach\nout and see what they have.\u201d She promised to call back with more information.\nShe said she\u2019d check with her contacts at M.D. Anderson and see if, among\ntheir many trials, anything looked promising. Maybe, I thought, specialists\nthere could refer us to the right trial if M.D. Anderson wasn\u2019t hosting it?\n\nOnline, more doctors chimed in with the names of hospitals known for HNSCC,\nsuggesting we see what trials they hosted. \u201cHospital first, trial second\u201d\nseemed to be the generally recommended way.\n\nWhile I appreciated the help and the referrals, how were we supposed to know\nif the right trial for Jake was hosted at any of these sites? How were we\nsupposed to know where to go if we didn\u2019t know what we were going for?\n\nI opened Excel back up and reviewed my list of 50 studies. I prepared to look\nat the next 50 and felt despair.\n\nThen I met Eileen.\n\nFind the right trial, then get into the trial (simple, right?)\n\nEileen Faucher is a biochemist with a business sideline helping patients like\nJake navigate the clinical trial process. Bingo. If one of my former\ncolleagues hadn\u2019t referred me to her, I\u2019m not sure we could have found the\nright trial. I first emailed Eileen on July 23. Her views on the trial process\nwere congruent with mine: The key is to find the right trial, and then get\ninto that trial at whatever site might be available. Trial first, hospital\nsecond.\n\nAll trials aren\u2019t equal, and a hierarchy of likely efficaciousness could be\nguessed at, if not promised\u2014they\u2019re called \u201ctrials,\u201d not guarantees. Eileen\ncharged a lot per hour but her fees were worth every penny: she was efficient,\nand without her I\u2019d have been lost. She was clear about her own limitations\nand the system\u2019s limitations: she could help identify promising trials, but a\npromising trial may not work out. Think of the \u201cpromising\u201d persons you may\nhave dated who, when you got to know them, weren\u2019t so promising.\n\nClinicalTrials.gov didn\u2019t make Eileen break out in a cold sweat or give her\ngastrointestinal distress. Having spent years consulting for the\npharmaceutical companies, and with a background in cancer research, Eileen was\nfamiliar with medication acronyms and where the money was going. She could\nevaluate a world that was, to her, familiar.\n\nIn ten hours, Eileen produced a spreadsheet of 500 studies, organized into\nviability, and preference based on drug targets, and study type. The first 150\nwere loosely organized from most to least promising based on their specificity\nto HNSCC, prior published data, study phase, and supporting research. I don\u2019t\nknow how a normal person can navigate the clinical trial landscape without\nconnections to the medical system along with someone like Eileen, but I may\nhave found my next career. Watch this space for further announcements: People\nneed this service, and it seems that drug companies, oncologists, and\nhospitals can\u2019t or won\u2019t make the process easier for patients. So maybe I\nshould.\n\nImportant categories used to rank studies include:\n\n  * Specificity to cancer type: Did the trial focus on all solid tumors, or had the drug already shown promise or a mechanism of action specific to HNSCC?\n\n  * Phase: There are three relevant clinical phases, and, while there are a bunch of nuances to actual real-world practice and FDA requirements, I\u2019m going to hit the highlights for a patient looking to get into the right trial:\n\nPhase 1: A phase 1a study brings a study drug out of the lab and into humans\nfor the first time. They are \u201csingle ascending dose\u201d studies. Usually, one to\nthree patients at a time are given a dose, then there\u2019s a waiting period, then\nthe dose is increased. This process is repeated until researchers determine\nthe maximum dose a typical person can tolerate. For the patient, a phase one\nstudy is a little like throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks:\nyou might benefit from the medication, but most trials don\u2019t advance to the\nnext phase.[1]\n\nFollowing a successful phase 1a study of dosing is, typically, a phase 1b\n\u201cexpansion\u201d study. In 1b, the dose (or doses) that will be used for future\nphase II studies are further narrowed down, and additional tolerability and\nsafety studies are performed.\n\nEarly efficacy \u201cendpoints,\u201d might also be evaluated, such as \u201cwhat was the\naverage time to response?\u201d \u201chow much did the tumors shrink?\u201d and \u201cwhat were\nthe patient\u2019s overall survival rates?\u201d Patients are also often further grouped\ninto \u201ccohorts\u201d based on their tumor type, which helps to determine if a study\ndrug behaves differently between cancer types.\n\nPhase 2: A phase 2 study has already established tolerability and dose. It\u2019s\nlooking for responses to the treatment. It\u2019s asking the question: \u201cdoes this\ndrug work?\u201d Phase 2 treatments are more appealing because their endpoint is\nefficacy, but phase 1b expansion arms are similar, much more common, and,\narguably, close to the same thing as phase 2 trials. If a phase 1b study drug\nappears more promising than a phase 2 drug, I\u2019d prefer to be a patient in the\n1b study. Drug companies, however, might not publish enough data for a\nprospective patient to know whether Joe Pharma\u2019s 1b study is better than Jane\nDrug Company\u2019s phase 2 study, or vice-versa.\n\nPhase 3: None were available. Phase 3 studies are the large-scale randomized\ntrials usually pit the standard of care against a new treatment regimen with\npublished efficacy data that may replace the previous standard of care. A\nphase 3 trial is typically your best bet, if one is available, but phase 3\nstudies often aren\u2019t available.\n\n  * Preliminary Data: Did early phase 1 trials show promising outcomes?\n\n  * Research & Development (R&D):\n\n  * Based on research history, was this drug similar to another drug type/category that had positive results? Is the drug a new iteration of a repeated failure?\n\n  * Is the drug company pouring money into the drug, which suggests unpublished positive data or insider knowledge? \u201cFollow the money\u201d is usually good advice across fields.\n\nI started reviewing each study on Eileen\u2019s list. As I mentioned, Eileen\nunderstood the oncology drug space, how to compare and evaluate different\nmolecular targets and immunotherapies, study design and pharmaceutical cash\nflow. But the second half of determining whether a study is \u201cright\u201d involves\nunderstanding the patient\u2019s clinical picture and determining if they\u2019re\nmedically eligible.\n\nEvaluating for clinical relevance is where my expertise came into play. Did\nprior surgeries, pathology results, treatments, or tests disqualify Jake? Were\nthe genetic tumor markers being targeted\u2014Jake\u2019s tumor was tested by both CARIS\nand Mayo in-house sequencing\u2014relevant for his disease? Did he meet other\nmedical requirements? Together, Eileen and I narrowed the first 150 studies\ndown to a top 50, then reviewed the data again and made a list of what we\nhoped were the 35 most promising trials.\n\nUnfortunately, even an expert search like Eileen\u2019s can be scuppered by the\npoor digital management of ClinicalTrials.com. Jake had read about a promising\nModerna study for mRNA-2752, which involves \u201can injection of the study drug\ndirectly into the tumor.\u201d Eileen reviewed the study and thought it looked\nparticularly promising, but mRNA-2752 wasn\u2019t on her list because whoever\nposted it to ClinicalTrials.gov listed it under \u201call solid tumors,\u201d instead of\nselecting each of the multiple tumor types that the study was willing to\ninclude. Because that person never chose \u201cHNSCC (or a variant)\u201d as a keyword,\nit remained invisible to Eileen. Jake had set up a bunch of Google news alerts\nrelated to mRNA cancer vaccines, immunotherapies, and other technologies, so\nhe was coming up with stuff that we weren\u2019t seeing on clinicaltrials.gov. Jake\nalso found Moderna\u2019s mRNA-4359 trial, which is an immune checkpoint inhibitor\nin solid tumors.\n\nIf just this part of the process sounds frustrating, that\u2019s because it is. But\ndon\u2019t worry, later parts will be equally\u2014if not more frustrating\u2014in unique\nways. And I will repeat that Jake\u2019s life is on the line. Your life, or the\nlife of someone you love, may be on the line too. A number of oncologists\nsuggested that we find a local clinical trial in Arizona because sifting\nthrough trials and then moving would be too hard. Wouldn\u2019t it be nicer to\nsleep in your own bed? That is an opinion but it isn\u2019t my opinion, or Jake\u2019s.\nWe are fortunate enough to be in a position to move to whichever city might\nhost the most promising trial, and we believed (and still do) that the\npotential benefits between trials was vast I need Jake to have the best\npossible shot at living.\n\nEileen found five top trials:\n\n  * NCT04815720: Pepinemab in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (KEYNOTE-B84)\n\n  * NCT03526835: A Study of Bispecific Antibody MCLA-158 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.\n\n  * NCT05743270: Study of RP3 in Combination With Nivolumab and Other Therapy in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced or Recurrent SCCHN.\u201d\n\n  * NCT03485209: Efficacy and Safety Study of Tisotumab Vedotin for Patients With Solid Tumors (innovaTV 207)\n\n  * NCT05094336: AMG 193, Methylthioadenosine (MTA) Cooperative Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) Inhibitor, Alone and in Combination With Docetaxel in Advanced Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP)-Null Solid Tumors (MTAP).\n\nPlus, the Moderna studies Jake had found. Based on the names alone, you can\nsee why it would be difficult if not impossible for someone without some\nexpertise in cancer oncology to evaluate trials. And yet it seems that many\noncologists have only a vague sense of what\u2019s happening regarding clinical\ntrials in their field! I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t more people like Eileen,\noffering to sell guidance to the clinical trial process. When I visited Spain,\nit felt like there was a guide on every corner willing to offer historical or\nwine tours, or, better still, historical wine tours (it\u2019s hard to get bad wine\nin Spain, which I learned from my extensive research on the subject). The\nclinical trial decision is much more important and yet it seems most patients\nare on our own.\n\nAI Companies: Not there yet\n\nThis section may rapidly become out of date, but a billion \u201cAI\u201d companies tout\nproducts that will match patients to trials. Jake\u2019s essays on his impending\ndeath and the FDA\u2019s complicity in letting him die led to a bunch of AI\ncompanies contacting us. Plus, we were referred to MassiveBio and XCures,\nwhich boasted both improved clinical trial matching through \u201cAI,\u201d as well as\nclinical navigators (Massive Bio) and a PhD with clinical research experience\nreviewing your data (XCures). Their algorithms interact with the same\nfrustrating ClinicalTrials.gov platform the plebs do, but I wondered if the AI\ncompanies might be able to do a more thorough job. Their systems probably\nweren\u2019t programmed to get frustrated and need to take frequent breaks to\nscream into a pillow.\n\nMassive Bio states they\u2019ll take your comprehensive medical history\u2014generated\nfrom the electronic medical records of the various hospitals and clinics\nvisited\u2014and provide a \u201ccare summary\u201d (I\u2019d written one for Jake). But I never\nreceived that summary, and as of checking their website five minutes ago,\nthere isn\u2019t one uploaded. We did, however, receive a \u201cSYNERGY-AI\u201d clinical\ntrial matching results form that listed five trials across Arizona, California\nand New Mexico. These results weren\u2019t great.\n\nOnly five trials were listed: one was for radiotherapy, which Jake wouldn\u2019t\nqualify for, since he\u2019d already had radiation and it\u2019s unwise to re-irradiate\nthe same place within such a short time. Another was only for patients who had\nnot yet received first-line therapy for their recurrence (Jake was on\nimmunotherapy and chemo), and the other was a phase 1a dose-escalation study\nthat, especially when compared to the top 35 studies that Eileen and I had\nfound, seemed only tangentially relevant to Jake. Our #12 study was in the\nlist. Our highest ranked study in Arizona, which was actively recruiting,\nwasn\u2019t listed at all.\n\nAs a side note, Massive Bio is also performing a meta-study called \u201cSYNGERGY-\nAI\u201d to evaluate if their clinical-trial matching algorithm leads to improved\noutcomes. I like this idea a lot, and think it\u2019s a valuable question to\neventually ask, but I can save them a lot of time and money with the answer\nbased on their current system: No. But call me, guys, if you want to discuss\nwhere things might have gone wrong.\n\nEdit: Massive Bio\u2019s response in the comments. It seems fair to foreground what\nthey say.\n\nThe XCures website says:\n\n> The XCures platform transforms complex unstructured medical data directly\n> from the patient\u2019s medical records into structured data suitable for\n> analysis and review. Our A.I. engine can actively cross-reference this data\n> against the vast digital library of oncology data to match patients with\n> potential treatments. This empowers patients and their oncologists to make\n> more informed and effective treatment decisions.\n\nFrom XCures, we were referred to cancercommons.com, where we were matched with\nEmma Shtivelman, PhD, who is a \u201cclinical scientist\u201d and reviewed Jake\u2019s\nrecords. She expanded the search past AZ and CA, but noted she had \u201cdoubts\nabout a number of trials in terms of eligibility.\u201d She wanted to include them\nin case they were relevant. She identified that bispecific antibodies might be\na good target, which Eileen and the literature also support, but, although\nsome supporting data was attached to the five recommendations that followed,\nmost of the studies were first-in-human phase 1a dose escalation trials. None\nof the five studies listed were on our top thirty list, though there were\nmultiple bispecific antibody studies on our top thirty list. Some\nrecommendations regarding potential off-label drug targets were rescinded in a\nlater e-mail.\n\nEdit: XCures responded on LinkedIn. It again seems fair to foreground what\nthey say.\n\nThese AI methods are slick and seem well-supported, but they may be suffering\nfrom \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d The companies have or appear to have VC money,\nand they\u2019re funneling data into larger research studies about the use of AI in\nthe trial space. I\u2019m sure they mean well and want to help patients. The ideas\nsound good. We\u2019re not the first people to observe the craziness of\nclinicaltrials.gov. Based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, however, the \u201cAI\u201d tech\nisn\u2019t there yet and the people reviewing the results also don\u2019t seem to have\nthe expertise or the time to identify that the searches aren\u2019t very useful or\ncomprehensive; a clinical liaison is also useless without some guidance on\neligibility, which wasn\u2019t really evaluated for the trials Jake was \u201cmatched\u201d\nto.\n\nPatients shouldn\u2019t be making life-or-death decisions based on these results,\nwhich missed a large number of trials for which Jake was eligible. Look, I\nunderstand that scaling companies don\u2019t have the time to do what Eileen and I\ndid for Jake. She and I have medical and research backgrounds, and she spent\n15 hours while I spent weeks on the project for one patient. One day, I hope\nthese efforts will be scalable, but as the field currently stands, the time\nconstraints needed to be thorough are prohibitive for both scalable businesses\nand for a patient\u2019s personal oncologist.\n\nWithout feeling comfortable learning to search clinicaltrials.gov themselves,\nor without having access to help like Eileen, I can see how patients would\nchoose to focus on the AI-discovered trials and go no further, simply because\nthey didn\u2019t have the resources to figure out what\u2019s really going on. In this\nway, the AI searches\u2014especially since they not only miss the optimal trials,\nbut also the best-matched trials in a patient\u2019s local area\u2014seem much less\nuseful than making appointments at the various hospital systems in your area\nand meeting with their local oncologist to ask what they happen to have\navailable in terms of trials.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019d like to see a scaleable AI solution, but as long as the\ndata the AI trains on (what\u2019s currently available on ClinicalTrials.gov) is\nincomplete and poorly structured, I don\u2019t see it happening. You can\u2019t out-\nprogram a bad initial data set. There will need to be a multi-prong approach\nbefore the AI folks can get it right and I hope they do!\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, consider the Go Fund Me that\u2019s funding Jake\u2019s\nongoing care.\n\nYou just finished part 1.

Still, first-\nin-human trials, and early phase ones\u2014unless they have a particularly\ncompelling and unique mechanism of action\u2014are very hard to compare because\nthey lack preliminary data and are therefore unlikely to be worth traveling\nfor.\n\n### Subscribe to Everything Is An Emergency\n\nBy Bess Stillman \u00b7 Launched 7 months ago\n\nI'm Bess Stillman: ER doctor, writer, and wife to Jake Seliger, who is\ncurrently dying of SCC of the tongue.

I share your\nfrustration with clinical trial matching because it can be a overwhelming\nprocess for the variety of reasons you have already articulated. That said, in\nour search tool, you can calibrate your such much more precisely than you can\nin clinicaltrials.gov. I conducted a trial search that included phase 1-3,\nrecruiting and not yet recruiting, Metastatic HNSCC (and a subset of\nontological expansions) within the United States and I obtained 224 trials\n(containing all 5 of the trials that ultimately prioritized - NCT04815720,\nNCT03526835, NCT05743270, NCT03485209, NCT05094336). I performed that search\nand downloaded a csv of trial attributes for side by side analysis and\nprospect mining. That was achieved in less than 5 minutes. I will share the\ndownload upon request. The purpose of this note is to make aware that there\nare tools that can significantly improve elements of this arduous and time\nconsuming process.
