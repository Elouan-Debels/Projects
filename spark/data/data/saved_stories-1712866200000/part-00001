When the discoveries started pouring in, astronomers\nquickly realized that few exoplanets resembled anything in the solar system.\nInstead, they found chunks of rocks orbiting dead stars, balls of evaporating\ngas, planets raining rubies, and super-puffs no denser than cotton candy.\n\nBut worlds beyond our solar system captured public imagination long before\nthen and have been the settings for science fiction (sci-fi) for more than a\ncentury.\n\n\u201cSci-fi already introduces the general public to lots of scientific\nconcepts\u2014many people probably first encounter exoplanets through science\nfiction,\u201d said Emma Puranen, a doctoral student at St Andrews Centre for\nExoplanet Science in Scotland.\n\n> As scientists discovered that real-life exoplanets rarely resembled Earth,\n> sci-fi exoplanets became less Earth-like, too.\n\nA new study led by Puranen examined how the discovery of real exoplanets has\ninfluenced portrayals of fictional ones. The researchers showed that as\nscientists discovered that real-life exoplanets rarely resembled Earth, sci-fi\nexoplanets became less Earth-like, too.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\n\u201cScience fiction and popular culture are key to engaging the general public\nand non-scientists in current scientific discoveries,\u201d said Erin Macdonald, an\nastrophysicist and science consultant for the Star Trek franchise who was not\ninvolved with the new research. \u201cSeeing an interesting planet in science\nfiction can pique curiosity and allow scientists to share the similarities and\ndifferences with actual discoveries using common ground.\u201d\n\n### Strange New Worlds\n\nScience and science fiction have long had a circular relationship, Macdonald\nsaid. \u201cMany science fiction writers may have a science background or a deep\ninterest in science which then influences their work as new discoveries are\nmade.\u201d Likewise, \u201cscientists are often inspired to become scientists because\nof what they see in media and science fiction.\u201d\n\nPuranen is a sci-fi fan herself. (\u201cHuge fan of Mr. Spock!\u201d she said, as well\nas Becky Chambers\u2019s Wayfarers series and Andy Weir\u2019s Project Hail Mary.) She\nsaid that case studies and anecdotal evidence have suggested that science and\nsci-fi influence each other, but few studies quantify how the two are linked.\n\n\u201cThe portrayal of exoplanet science in science fiction is the perfect area in\nwhich to investigate this [link] because exoplanets have long featured in sci-\nfi stories, but our scientific knowledge of them has completely changed since\nthey were first discovered,\u201d Puranen said.\n\nAs real exoplanets were revealed to be unlike Earth, fictional exoplanets also\nbecame less Earth-like. Credit: britaseifert/AdobeStock\n\nTo quantify how science may have influenced sci-fi, the researchers\ncrowdsourced examples of fictional exoplanets from social media groups, sci-fi\nconventions, and team members. Sci-fi planets originated in books, films, TV\nshows, video games, and podcasts and included stories told before and after\n1995.\n\nThe researchers categorized planets by whether they orbited a real star,\norbited in the habitable zone, were gaseous, had human-breathable air, had a\nbiosphere, had intelligent native life, or had an established colony of non-\nnative humans. The researchers used a Bayesian network analysis to explore\nconnections between these characteristics and identify trends that shifted\nwith the discovery of 51 Pegasi b.\n\nThe analysis showed that \u201cfictional exoplanets from after the real-life\ndiscovery of exoplanets were less likely to have intelligent native life and\nless likely to have established populations of non-native humans,\u201d Puranen\nsaid. Sci-fi exoplanets became less Earth-like and more likely to feature\nnonintelligent native biospheres. These results were published in the Journal\nof Science Communication in March.\n\n> \u201cI think sci-fi should be inspired by science and not beholden to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that there\u2019s a two-way influence between science\nand sci-fi, but it\u2019s really interesting to see it quantified and represented\nin this way,\u201d said Moiya McTier, an astrophysicist, folklorist, and author who\nwas not involved with the research. \u201cThese [categorizations] are exactly the\nexoplanet questions people are interested in exploring.\u201d\n\nHowever, she didn\u2019t necessarily agree that creatives were evolving with the\nscience. \u201cThe discovery of non-Earth-like planets opened the door to new\npossibilities,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a lot of sci-fi creators ended up making less\nrealistic worlds because they tend to know even less about the science of gas\ngiants than they do about physics here on Earth.\u201d In other words, sci-fi may\nhave started to depict more gas giants than they did before 1995, but those\nplanets do not approximate how exoplanets actually work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, though,\u201d McTier added, \u201cbecause I think sci-fi should be\ninspired by science and not beholden to it.\u201d\n\n### Teaching Tatooine\n\nThis research included a few long-running franchises, including Star Trek and\nStar Wars and stories that have several remakes. Macdonald said that she would\nhave liked to have seen more discussion on how exoplanet trends within\nindividual franchises have evolved, too. \u201cThe exoplanets we see in Star Trek\nin 1966 versus the ones we see in current shows [like] Star Trek: Prodigy and\nStrange New Worlds, particularly, have definitely expanded based on our\nknowledge of what is possible out there and the desire to tell unique\nstories,\u201d she said.\n\n> Star Wars familiarized folks with Tatooine decades before the 2005 discovery\n> of HD 202206 c.\n\nStories of fictional worlds can inspire scientists as they interpret obscure\nsignals from strange new worlds and communicate those discoveries to broader\naudiences. Star Wars familiarized folks with Tatooine decades before the 2005\ndiscovery of HD 202206 c, the first known exoplanet orbiting two Sun-like\nstars. Now, Tatooine is a ubiquitous reference in the science communicator\u2019s\ntoolbox.\n\nMacdonald recounted teaching an introductory astronomy class not long after\nthe discovery of the circumbinary world Kepler 16 b. Her class, which had been\nrelatively disinterested, perked up at the comparison to Tatooine.\n\n\u201cThey began asking questions like \u2018Well, could Luke live there?\u2019 \u2018Would it be\na desert planet?\u2019 \u2018Would the sunsets look like the movie?\u2019\u201d Macdonald\nrecalled. \u201cThe students were now thinking critically and asking the types of\nquestions and thinking in the way we want introductory science classes to\nlearn.\u201d\n\nPuranen said that some scientists, teachers, and science communicators still\nhesitate to use sci-fi to make new discoveries more accessible to\nnonscientists because not all sci-fi makes clear distinctions between science\nand fiction.\n\n\u201cMy hope is this study can help science communicators craft lesson plans to\ntake advantage of the huge enthusiasm people already have for sci-fi to help\npeople become more scientifically literate and engaged,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014Kimberly M.
