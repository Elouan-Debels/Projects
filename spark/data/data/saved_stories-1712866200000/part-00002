We\u2019re largely focused\non preparing companies for their on-stage presentations, but are also working\nwith them on slightly longer decks to use in follow-up conversations with\ninvestors.\n\nI\u2019ve written about pitching before, and realized that what we were missing was\na clear template for how founders should lay out their stories through slides.\nThe deck below is a template for how I think companies should build seed\ndecks. While the main target for this template is a company raising its seed\nround, the deck is not all that different from best practices for a Series A\ndeck - which we\u2019ll release next.\n\nThe key point to remember here is that founders should strive for clarity and\nconcision. This is not the right place to write a treatise on your market or\nworld philosophy. The simple truth is that there isn\u2019t very much meaningful\ndetail to explore for most seed stage companies. When founders pretend that\nthere is, their stories get muddled, and the investors get lost.\n\nFocus on narrative. The rest is commentary. (see footnote)\n\nThis is the title page. It has the name of your company, and a one line\ndescription of what you do.\n\nThis is the only place in the deck where you can only have 1 slide for what\nyou need to show. Any of the other slides in this deck should be treated as a\nfirst slide of a set. If you can keep the set to n=1, that\u2019s ideal, but if you\nneed more, that\u2019s ok. You probably don\u2019t want any set here where n > 3\\. This\nis a seed deck, remember.\n\nThis is where you clearly state the problem. Particulars of how this problem\nimpacts real world people/businesses are valuable.\n\nThis is the solution. You want to explain what you do very clearly, in as few\nwords as possible. Describe the concrete benefits you provide\n\nShow off your traction (if you have it). Make the numbers clear and\nmeaningful. It\u2019s unlikely your curve will be this smooth. That\u2019s ok.\n\nAdd some context next to the chart if you\u2019ve got some great stats you want to\nadd.\n\nGot more metrics? Awesome! Add them!\n\nTrick slide! Revenue would be better here, but this is ok.\n\nTell the investor what makes you so special, what makes this work, what your\ninsights are. This might take more than one slide.\n\nBusiness model is important. You probably don\u2019t know all the details yet, but\nyou should know a lot of them. Lay it out. If you need more space to dig into\nsomething complicated, add slides.\n\nWhat\u2019s the market here? Is it going to be big? Will you make it big? How much\nmoney are you going to make off this thing? Convince the investor that they\u2019re\ngoing to make lots of money with you\n\nTeam! So important at seed. Talk about what makes your team particularly well\nsuited to the problem. This should be about founders. Nobody cares about your\nadvisors.\n\nTell the investor how much money you need, and what it gets you. If you can\nlay out where you\u2019ll be inside of a year, which should make you Series A\nready, that\u2019s powerful\n\nfootnote: This deck is intentionally simple in design. Kevin Hale wrote a\ngreat piece about how to design decks well.\n\nThanks to Jared Friedman for suggesting that we put this together, and for\nreviewing it.\n\n## Footer\n\nY Combinator\n\n### Programs\n\n  * YC Program\n  * Startup School\n  * Work at a Startup\n  * Co-Founder Matching\n\n### Company\n\n  * YC Blog\n  * Contact\n  * Press\n  * People\n  * Careers\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Notice at Collection\n  * Security\n  * Terms of Use\n\n### Resources\n\n  * Startup Directory\n  * Startup Library\n  * Investors\n  * SAFE\n  * Hacker News\n  * Launch YC\n  * YC Deals\n\n### Make something people want.\n\nApply\n\nTwitterFacebookInstagramLinkedInYoutube\n\n\u00a9 2024 Y Combinator\n\n", "frontpage": false}
