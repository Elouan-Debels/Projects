Marthe M. Hinojales and Hongyan Zhao are senior economists with\nthe organization.\n\nThe increasingly heated struggle between the U.S. and China for dominance in\nsemiconductor technologies has been a godsend for the Malaysian island of\nPenang.\n\nThese days, Penang's industrial parks are abuzz with traffic and construction\nactivity. Thanks to its well-established electrical and electronics\nmanufacturing ecosystem, good connectivity, reliable infrastructure and its\nskilled and multilingual workforce, Penang has in recent years won new chip\nsector investments from multinationals, including Lam Research, Infineon\nTechnologies, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Bosch, Advanced\nSemiconductor Engineering (ASE) and Intel.\n\nThese investments have reinforced Malaysia's entrenched position in the late\nstages of the semiconductor supply chain, particularly chip assembly, testing\nand packaging, areas in which it holds a 13% share of the global market.\n\nThis is a lower stakes, lower profit and lower profile end of the business\nthan the design and production of semiconductor wafers, activities currently\ncentered on the U.S. and Taiwan, respectively.\n\nThus, the government of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has set its sights on\ntaking Malaysia's chip industry upstream as part of its New Industrial Master\nPlan 2030, unveiled last year.\n\nIn January, the government set up the National Semiconductor Strategic Task\nForce to focus on investment incentives and manpower issues. A key element of\nthe government's strategy is to raise the technological level of Malaysian\nmanufacturing as a way to bring up wages so that skilled workers are less\ntempted to go overseas.\n\nYet Malaysia will face heavy competition in trying to move upstream in chip\nproduction.\n\nWith the help of attractive tax incentives, Vietnam has convinced U.S.\ncompanies, including chip design software maker Synopsys and packaging and\ntesting company Amkor Technology, to expand their local operations. In\nFebruary, India approved plans by Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor\nManufacturing to launch an $11 billion joint venture chip fabrication plant\nthat will be the country's first. Singapore, which is already home to several\nfabs, is drawing new interest from companies such as Taiwan's Vanguard\nInternational Semiconductor.\n\nWafer fabrication is a challenge because of the massive costs involved in\nsetting up a foundry, especially for next-generation chips, and the scarcity\nof key talent. One Malaysian business group estimated two years ago that\nPenang faced a shortage of 50,000 engineers to meet semiconductor industry\ndemand. Meanwhile, government data shows that fewer students are pursuing\nstudies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nPolicymakers should review the strategies they used in past decades to help\nbring downstream chip production plants to Malaysia. Industrial master plans\nobliged multinationals setting up factories to transfer skills and\ntechnologies, and to work with local suppliers. Business and government,\nmeanwhile, worked together to set up the Penang Skills Development Centre to\nboost workforce talent.\n\nThanks to its well-established electrical and electronics manufacturing\necosystem, Penang has in recent years won new chip sector investments from\nmultinationals, \u00a9 Reuters\n\nThe resulting self-reinforcing ecosystem of chip packaging, testing and\nassembly companies led, in turn, to opportunities for automated equipment and\nservices, and put local companies, including Inari Amertron and Greatech\nTechnology, on a growth trajectory.\n\nAdvanced packaging techniques to enhance performance and functionality now\nrepresent a good opportunity for Malaysia to advance to the leading edge of\nsemiconductor technology. Intel has already committed to build its first\noverseas facility for advanced 3D chip packaging in Penang.\n\nChip design could be a more promising area for Malaysia than fabrication. A\nfew local companies, such as Oppstar Technology, can already provide design\nservices for advanced chips.\n\nHowever, chip design is knowledge-intensive and has high barriers to entry. To\ncreate a cluster of homegrown chip design houses, strong collaboration among\nindustry players, government and academia will be needed to foster\nentrepreneurialism, encourage innovation and develop talent.\n\nThe rapid adoption of advanced technologies and the increasing complexity of\nsemiconductor devices are driving demand for custom design services. Malaysia\nmust quickly seize opportunities in chip design to move up the semiconductor\nvalue chain as competition intensifies.\n\nIndustry players can work with tertiary institutions to set up centers of\nexcellence for chip design and develop internship programs to expose students\nto industry-standard design projects. The government could support\nuniversities and technical institutes by providing advanced electronic design\nautomation tools and offering matching grants to startups for design-related\ninvestments.\n\nIt will also be important for the government to see through plans to revamp\nthe country's Technical and Vocational Education and Training system to add\nmore high-tech courses and make the program more attractive to both\nprospective students and employers. Officials are also mulling a proposal to\nallow foreign students in engineering and technical fields to stay on to work\nin Malaysia after graduation to ease the talent shortage.\n\nMalaysia has an opportunity to make an impact in some niche areas of chip\nfabrication. Germany's Infineon, for example, is building a next-generation\nsilicon carbide power chip fabrication plant in Kulim, near Penang. This could\nposition Malaysia as a regional hub to meet the rising demand for power\nsemiconductors for electric vehicles, data centers and renewable energy\nsystems. SilTerra Malaysia, meanwhile, is producing another kind of chip for\ndata centers, known as silicon photonics, in Kulim.\n\nMalaysia's strategic diplomacy and economic foresight have shaped its\nsemiconductor landscape over the past few decades. Today, the country is\nemerging as a front-runner in the reconfiguration of the global chip supply\nchain.\n\nHowever, amid intensifying competition, the strength of Malaysia's chip\nindustry resurgence will hinge on its ability to move closer to the\ntechnological frontier and away from labor-intensive, low-value stages of\nproduction.\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * Supply Chain\n\n#### Taiwan's Advantech aims to turn Malaysia into Southeast Asia hub\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Malaysia's YTL launches Nvidia-powered AI Cloud supercomputing bid\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### AT&S to start chip substrate production in Malaysia this year\n\n  * Semiconductors\n\n#### Taiwan's Kinsus mulls setting up chip substrate plant in Malaysia\n\n  * Comment\n\n#### How Malaysia is finding its way out of the middle-income trap\n\n  * Supply Chain\n\n#### Malaysia plans to accelerate its EV and chip sectors as supply chains\nshift\n\n  * Supply Chain\n\n#### Taiwan chip industry sails overseas amid supply chain shift\n\n## Latest On Opinion\n\n  * Opinion\n\n#### Germany and France have to form a common front toward China\n\n  * Opinion\n\n#### India-U.S.-South Korea tech cooperation has strategic logic\n\n  * Opinion\n\n#### U.S. rate cut doubts are a headache for Asian central banks\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n### About Sponsored Content This content was commissioned by Nikkei's Global\nBusiness Bureau.\n\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\n\n#### Get Insights on Asia in your inbox\n\nRegister for our newsletters\n\n#### Connect With Us\n\nNikkei Inc.
