Not so fast.\n\nA new international study counters the common belief that our metabolism\ninevitably declines during our adult lives. Well, not until we\u2019re in our 60s,\nanyway.\n\nResearchers found that metabolism peaks around age 1, when babies burn\ncalories 50 percent faster than adults, and then gradually declines roughly 3\npercent a year until around age 20. From there, metabolism plateaus until\nabout age 60, when it starts to slowly decline again, by less than 1 percent\nannually, according to findings published Thursday in the journal Science.\n\nTo tease out the specific impact of age on metabolism, the researchers\nadjusted for factors such as body size (bigger bodies burn more calories\noverall than smaller ones) and fat-free muscle mass (muscles burn more\ncalories than fat).\n\n\u201cMetabolic rate is really stable all through adult life, 20 to 60 years old,\u201d\nsaid study author Herman Pontzer, an associate professor of evolutionary\nanthropology at Duke University and author of \u201cBurn,\u201d a new book about\nmetabolism. \u201cThere's no effect of menopause that we can see, for example. And\nyou know, people will say, 'Well when I hit 30 years old, my metabolism fell\napart.' We don't see any evidence for that, actually.\u201d\n\nPontzer and colleagues studied a database of more than 6,400 people, ages 8\ndays to 95 years, from 29 countries worldwide who had participated in \u201cdoubly\nlabeled water\u201d tests. With this method, individuals drink water in which some\nof the hydrogen and oxygen have been replaced with isotopes of these elements\nthat can be traced in urine samples.\n\n\u201cBy calculating how much hydrogen you lose per day, and how much oxygen you\nlose per day, we can calculate how much carbon dioxide your body produces\nevery day,\u201d Pontzer explained. \u201cAnd that's a very precise measurement of how\nmany calories you burn every day, because you can't burn calories without\nmaking carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\n### Recommended\n\nWomen's Health\n\n### Women's HealthAcetaminophen during pregnancy not associated with ADHD or\nautism risk\n\nScience News\n\n### Science NewsPrestigious cancer research institute has retracted 7 studies\nafter allegations of altered images\n\nThe researchers analyzed average total daily energy expenditures, which\ninclude the calories we burn doing everything from breathing and digesting\nfood to thinking and moving our bodies.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing sort of more fundamental and basic than how our bodies burn\nenergy, because that represents how all our cells are busy all day doing their\nvarious tasks, and we didn't have a good sense of how that changes over the\ncourse of a lifespan,\u201d Pontzer said. \u201cYou need really big data sets to be able\nto answer that question. And this was the first time that we had the ability\nto do this with a really big data set that would allow us to pull apart the\neffects of body size and age and gender and all these things on our energy\nexpenditures over the day.\u201d\n\nTake, for instance, the finding that metabolic rate declines in seniors, which\nmight have been expected.\n\n\"People thought, 'Well, maybe it's because you're less active, or maybe it's\nbecause people tend to lose muscle mass as they get into their 60s, 70s and\nolder,'\" he said. \"But we can correct for all those things. We can say, 'No,\nno, no, it's more than that.' It's that our cells are actually changing.\"\n\nResults did not show that metabolic rates spiked upward during the teen years\nor pregnancy, as commonly thought, or that there were specific differences\nbetween men and women after accounting for body size and composition.\n\n## What factors cause weight gain?\n\nRegistered dietitian Colleen Tewksbury, a senior research investigator at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and\nDietetics, said the new study is surprising.\n\n\u201cHistorical convention was really that with different life cycle changes \u2014 of\npuberty, of pregnancy, of menopause \u2014 we thought that there was some shift in\nmetabolism and it impacted nutrition status and how we approached things from\na nutrition standpoint,\u201d she said. \u201cThis high-level rigorous assessment does\nnot show that.\u201d\n\nIt's not as if the weight gain is occurring because you don't \u2018burn the same\ncalories\u2019 anymore.\n\nBut if changing metabolism is not playing a role in weight gain at certain\npoints in adult life, there could be other contributing factors, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things that impact weight status and also someone's\nnutritional status,\u201d Tewksbury said. \u201cIt's not as simple as just one food or\none lifestyle change or one change from a biological standpoint. It's more\nlikely a much more complex web of lots of different changes happening at once.\nSo that could be changes to food intake. It could be changes in activity\nlevels. It can be where they're living, what they have access to, what are\ntheir sleep changes.\u201d\n\nSteven Malin, an associate professor of kinesiology and health and director of\nthe Rutgers Applied Metabolism and Physiology Laboratory, called the study\nresults \u201cilluminating on something that we thought we know a lot about and\nrealize that there's more to be discovered.\u201d\n\nMalin said the findings, for instance, contradict the belief that adults\nexperience a decline in metabolism as they move from their 20s into their 30s\nand that this may be contributing to the obesity epidemic.\n\n\u201cIt's not as if the weight gain is occurring because you don't \u2018burn the same\ncalories\u2019 anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nPontzer said the findings in early life highlight the critical importance of\ninfant nutrition meeting the increasing energy demands of growing babies.\n\nIn addition, he said, the study results could have implications for how much\nmedicine people need at various ages, when they could be metabolizing drugs\ndifferently.\n\nIn a commentary published with the new study, Timothy Rhoads and Rozalyn\nAnderson, who work in geriatrics at the University of Wisconsin, said the\nfindings also may have implications for the study of age-related diseases.\n\n\u201cThe decline from age 60 is thought to reflect a change in tissue-specific\nmetabolism, the energy expended on maintenance,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt cannot be a\ncoincidence that the increase in incidence of noncommunicable diseases and\ndisorders begins in this same time frame.\u201d\n\nJacqueline Stenson\n\nNBC News contributor Jacqueline Stenson is a health and fitness journalist who\nhas written for the Los Angeles Times, Reuters, Health, Self and Shape, among\nothers.
