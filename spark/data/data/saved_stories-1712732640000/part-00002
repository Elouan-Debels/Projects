Cookies help websites remember you, which is often useful, particularly\nif you are logging in to a website, but they can also be used for things that\nsome users don\u2019t like, such as tracking. Tracking cookies are used by\nmarketers to target you with ads that may interest you based on your browsing\nhabits.\n\nWorking with researchers from Swiss university ETH Z\u00fcrich, the team from UvA\ncreated a machine-learning tool that allowed them to analyze 100,000 websites.\nThe main goal was to compare what information websites said they would gather\nwith what they actually did. The researchers found an enormous number of\nprivacy violations.\n\nTo make the data a bit more insightful, they discriminated between \u201cnaive\u201d\nviolations and deliberate violations.\n\nNaive violations are things like not offering a choice to reject cookies\n(affecting 57% of sites), and forgetting to ask for permission to store\ncookies (which occurred on 32% of websites visited by Europeans). Forgetting\nto ask for permission, or making it very hard to reject cookies, is very easy\nto spot, yet several major website owners have already been fined for\nviolations like this.\n\nBut then we enter the realm of deliberate privacy violations. Of the websites\nthat offered visitors a choice, 65% used tracking cookies, even if visitors\nchose to reject them. In many cases, websites created the cookies even before\nthe visitor had the chance to make their choice.\n\nMore than 77% of the websites chose to interpret closing a cookie notification\ndialog as user consent.\n\nOn top of this, many websites also used so-called \u201cdark patterns\u201d to\nmanipulate visitors into making the site\u2019s preferred choice. Dark patterns,\nalso known as deceptive design patterns, occur when a user interface has been\ncrafted to nudge or trick users into doing things they didn\u2019t set out to do.\n\nDark patterns are not subliminal messaging or visual or auditory stimuli that\nthe conscious mind cannot perceive, although advertisers have been accused of\nusing those as well. It\u2019s more like making the accept button bright and easy\nto find and the reject button dark, smaller, or harder to read.\n\nThe researchers came to the conclusion that the way the cookie consent system\nis working is far from satisfactory. Small websites don\u2019t have the technical\nand legal knowledge to comply, and some others are simply choosing to ignore\nor bend the rules.\n\nAnd warnings to website owners seem to fall on deaf ears. Since March 31,\n2021, when the deadline set for websites and mobile applications to comply\nwith the new rules on cookies expired, the French privacy watchdog Commission\nNationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (CNIL) has adopted nearly 100\ncorrective measures (orders and sanctions) related to non-compliance with the\nlegislation on cookies.\n\nWe don\u2019t just report on privacy\u2014we offer you the option to use it.\n\nPrivacy risks should never spread beyond a headline.
