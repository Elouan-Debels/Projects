A new study\nconfirmed that dietary fiber lowered blood pressure independently of\nmedication and quantified how much of it would lower high blood pressure.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mum was very fond of using the word \u2018roughage\u2019 to\ndescribe an element of what she considered the perfect diet. Roughage is just\nanother name for dietary fiber: the parts of the food we eat that the body\ncan\u2019t digest. It aids the passage of food and waste through the gut and feeds\nbeneficial gut bacteria.\n\nMore Stories\n\nOutdoors\n\nAll-terrain Exoquad gets wheelchair users into four-wheelin' action\n\nTiny Houses\n\nSherpa tiny house takes a modern approach to space-saving design\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nI consent to the use of Google Analytics and related cookies across the\nTrendMD network (widget, website, blog).

Previous studies have\nfound that people who eat a lot of dietary fiber have significantly reduced\nrisk of \u2013 and lower mortality from \u2013 heart disease and stroke. However,\nguidelines on hypertension don\u2019t specify the benefit of dietary fiber.\n\nMonash University researchers undertook a meta-analysis of studies into the\neffect of dietary fiber on hypertension, providing the quantifiable amount of\ndietary fiber that women and men need to eat to reduce their BP.\n\n\u201cDietary fiber has emerged as a crucial yet underappreciated part of\nhypertension management,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Francine Marques, from\nMonash\u2019s School of Biological Sciences. \u201cOur study emphasizes the evidence\nsupporting the effectiveness of dietary fiber in lowering blood pressure and\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular events.\u201d\n\nThe meta-analysis showed that higher dietary fiber intake was associated with\na significant reduction in BP independent of medications taken to control\nhypertension. According to the evidence they reviewed, for women with\nhypertension \u2013 a BP of 140/90 mmHg or higher, according to the WHO \u2013 the\nrecommended intake of dietary fiber should be more than 28 g per day; for men\nwith hypertension, more than 38 g per day. Each additional 5 g per day was\nestimated to reduce systolic BP (the top number) by 2.8 mmHg and diastolic BP\n(bottom number) by 2.1 mmHg.\n\nThe researchers say the benefits of dietary fiber flow from its positive\nimpact on the gut microbiome. Dietary fiber allows bacteria to produce short-\nchain fatty acids with anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions that\ncontribute to lower BP.\n\n\u201cOur study highlights the urgent need for healthcare providers to prioritize\ndietary fiber as vital for hypertension management,\u201d Marques said. \u201cBy\nincorporating dietary fiber into treatment plans and empowering patients to\nincrease their intake, we can significantly reduce the burden of hypertension\nand improve cardiovascular outcomes.\u201d\n\nWesternized diets are notoriously lacking in ample fiber. The University of\nCalifornia San Francisco (UCSF) notes that the average dietary fiber intake\namong US adults is about 15 g per day. Here are some of UCSF's tips for\nensuring more fiber in your diet:\n\n  * As a general rule, include at least one serving of whole grains (e.g., rice, corn, oats, quinoa, bulgur) in every meal\n  * Choose wholegrain bread (look for one with the highest amount of fiber per slice)\n  * Cook with brown rice instead of white\n  * Add beans to your salads \u2013 each 1\u20442 cup serving is around 7 to 8 g of fiber\n  * Two or three times a week, substitute legumes (e.g., lentils, peas, broad beans, chickpeas, peanuts) for meat in things like soups and curries\n  * Eat at least five servings of fruit and veggies a day (fresh fruit is better than canned) \u2013 adding fruit to cereal is an excellent place to start, so is having fresh fruit for dessert\n  * Swap out fruit juices for whole fruits\n\nThe study was published in the journal Hypertension.\n\nSource: Monash University via Medianet\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nI consent to the use of Google Analytics and related cookies across the\nTrendMD network (widget, website, blog).
