In response, manufacturers are developing faster, more\nuser-friendly storage options to meet the rigorous project timelines and\nextensive data requirements of creative professionals.\n\nWestern Digital has unveiled a new SD card for that market, and the SanDisk\nExtreme PRO SDUC UHS-I memory card packs a staggering 4TB of storage into the\npopular form factor. Yes, 4TB.\n\nAnnounced at the NAB Show 2024 in Las Vegas, the 4TB Extreme PRO SDUC UHS-I\nmemory card - along with the 2TB SanDisk Extreme Pro SDXC UHS-I and Extreme\nPro microSDXC UHS-I memory cards also revealed at the event - are part of the\ncompany's quest to meet the escalating requirement for the production and\nstorage of more detailed, richer content.\n\n## Twice the capacity of microSD cards\n\nThe 4TB capacity doubles that of the largest microSD cards, earning it the\ntitle for the world's largest removable memory card. It's a giant leap from\nthe 32MB of storage SD cards boasted in 1999.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\nThe new card utilizes the Secure Digital Ultra Capacity (SDUC) standard,\ncapable of supporting up to 128TB of storage. Other media card formats\navailable for creative professionals include XQD with a maximum storage\ncapacity of 2TB, and CFexpress, known for its superior speed. Announced last\nyear, the latest generation, CFexpress 4.0, supports up to four PCIe 4.0 lanes\nand 2GB/s per lane. Neither of those card formats can come close to offering\n4TB of storage, however.\n\nAttendees at this year's NAB show had a preview of the 4TB SanDisk card, which\nis slated for release in 2025. Pricing details for the new product haven't\nbeen released yet, but don\u2019t expect it to be cheap.\n\n### More from TechRadar Pro\n\n  * We've rounded up the best microSD cards around\n  * And these are the largest microSD cards\n  * Samsung's latest Pro memory cards can take your creativity to the next level\n\n## Are you a pro?
