But, we want to make sure we add some really\ninteresting notes to how we\u2019re digitizing the experience for our customers,\nbut also simplifying operations for our associates,\u201d said Walmart Canada\u2019s\nchief operations officer John Bayliss, during the grand-reopening early Friday\nmorning.\n\nOne such area where technology is enhancing the experience for both customers\nand associates is in the cracker aisle. As part of a pilot, LCD screens\nrunning the length of the shelves not only display price tags, videos and\ncustomer reviews pulled from the retailer\u2019s e-commerce site, but they can also\nbe used to guide associates stocking or reconfiguring the shelves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s operational benefits ... When an associate goes to set the shelf, the\ncomputer screens can be turned on to show where items go, so it helps in the\nefficiency of how we build our modulars in the store,\u201d explained Bayliss.\n\nThough testing is underway in the grocery department, the screens lend\nthemselves to other areas of the store, too, he said. \u201cIt brings to life\nimagery and video in a way the current [shelf tags] can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe grocery section, located on the basement-level of the store, has increased\nin response to the neighbourhood\u2019s growing population. The fresh produce, meat\nand frozen food sections are larger and the store debuts a counter serving hot\nmeals to go including signature black pepper chicken, jerk chicken and black\npepper beef ranging in price from $6.97 to $13.97.\n\n\u201cThis is really going to help us deliver on the customer needs,\u201d said Paula\nBonner, vice-president, format development, Walmart Canada. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded in\nfresh over double what we had before to make sure she can get everything \u2018she\u2019\nneeds in her grocery basket.\u201d\n\nOther features of the store include the retailer\u2019s first Walmart Health hub in\nCanada, which conveniently houses pharmacy, vision centre and a medical clinic\nwithin one specific area of the store.\n\nA digital \u201cconcierge\u201d board front and centre of the hub can help customers\nschedule pharmacy and optical appointments and find health and wellness\nproducts including a vitamin recommendation tool.\n\nAlso, customers shopping for large-scale items such as patio furniture,\nbarbecues and televisions can scan a QR code associated with the product\nthey\u2019re purchasing, pay for the item via their phone and then collect the item\ncurbside.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Tech\n  * News\n\nX\n\nThis ad will auto-close in 10 seconds\n\n## Stay Informed\n\n### Get the Newsletter\n\nGet news highlights delivered directly to your e-mail inbox.\n\nGET THE NEWSLETTER\n\n### Subscribe to the magazine\n\nStay informed on trends, products, issues and innovation.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE MAGAZINE\n\n\u00a9 2024 EnsembleIQ, All Rights Reserved\n\n", "frontpage": false}
