These storytellers, innovators, activists, advocates,\nbuilders and artists are helping make the internet more diverse, ethical,\nresponsible and inclusive.\n\nThis week, we chatted with Marek Tuszynski, an artist and curator that is the\nExecutive Director and co-founder of Tactical Tech, a program dedicated to\nsupporting initiatives focused on promoting better privacy and digital rights.\nWe talked with Marek about his travels abroad shaping his career, what sparks\nhis inspiration and future challenges we face online.\n\nSo the first question that I had that I wanted to ask you about this is very\nstraightforward, but what initially inspired you to co-found Tactical Tech?\nWhat was the first thing that made you really want to start the work that you\ndo?\n\nMarek Tuszynski: Things were not looked at the ways that I thought it\u2019s\nimportant to look at them, especially technical things that have been around\nfor over 20 years now. But the truth is, it was actually more excitement.\nExcitement that there\u2019s such a massive opportunity, such a massive chance for\nmany different people \u2014 actors, places, nations \u2014 to do things different and\noutside of the constraints that they are in, where they are at the time, and\nso on. I worked internationally at the time in sub-Saharan Africa and\nSoutheast Asia and was just thinking that a lot of tech is being damned there\nin these places \u2014 I\u2019m also from Eastern Europe, so we\u2019ve never seen the\nleading edge of the technology, we\u2019ve seen the tail if we\u2019re lucky if the\ncensorship allowed. So I just wanted to use technology as not only an\nopportunity that I have been kind of given by chance \u2014 it just happened I was\nin the right place in the right time \u2014 but also to bring it, and to co-develop\nit and do things together with people. My focus early on was with open source\nwith software, and that was the driving force behind how we think about which\ntechnology is better for society, which is a more right one, which gives you\nmore freedoms, not restrict them, and so on, etc. The story now, as we know,\nit turned kind of dark, but the inspiration was fascination with the\npossibilities of technology in terms of the tool for how we can access\nknowledge and information, the tool for how we can refine the way we see the\nworld. It\u2019s still there, and I think was there at the very beginning, and I\nthink that\u2019s a major force.\n\nYou mentioned some of the traveling that you did. I\u2019m very much of the belief\nthat traveling is one of the best ways for us to learn. How much did the\ntraveling and the places that you\u2019ve been to and that you\u2019ve seen influence or\nimpact the work that you did and give you a bigger perspective on some of the\nthings that you wanted to do?\n\nThat\u2019s interesting because I come from the art background and one of my\nfascinations was a period in history of ours where some of the makers spent\nsome of their time when they were learning on traveling. To go and visit other\nartists or studios, vendors and makers, etc., to see how they do things\nbecause there was no other way of information to travel, and for me that was\nvery important. But I think you are right. It is not cool to talk about\ntraveling these days, because travel also means burning fossil fuels and all\nthis kind of stuff \u2014 which is unfortunately true, but you can do other travel,\nI\u2019m doing a lot of sailing these days. But the initial traveling for me,\ncoming from an entirely restricted part of the world and where I was growing\nup, I actually thought, \u201cI\u2019m never going to travel\u201d in my mind. This is like\nsomething I\u2019m going to read in the books, see on films, but never experience\nbecause I can\u2019t get a passport. I couldn\u2019t get the basic rights to leave the\nborder that I was constrained with. So the moment I could do that I did it,\nand I practically never come back. I\u2019ve left the place I\u2019m from 35 years ago.\n\nThe question that you\u2019re asking is very important because travel teaches you a\nlot of things, and you become much more humble. Your eyes and brain and heart\nopens up much more. And you see that the world is unique, that people around\nyou are unique \u2014 you\u2019re not that unique yourself and there\u2019s a lot to learn\nfrom that. Initially, when you travel, you have this arrogance \u2014 I had this\narrogance at least \u2014 that I\u2019m going to go to places, learn them, understand\nthem, and turn into something, etc. And then you go, and you learn, and you\nnever stop. Learning is endless, and that\u2019s the most fascinating part. But I\nthink that the biggest privilege was to meet people and meet them on their own\nground with their own ideas about everything. And then you confront yourself\nand rip the way you frame things because you just come from a place with ideas\nthat somebody else put into your education system. So for me, yeah, it\n(traveling) worked in a way. And it\u2019s not necessarily the travel in the\nphysical space that we need. Now you can do it virtually like we have the\nconversation, and you get to know people and, you travel in some way. You may\nnot see the actual architecture of the space you are in, but you are seeing\n\u201cOkay, this is a person coming from somewhere with a certain set of ideas,\nquestions, and so on, etc.\u201d You look at them and think how we can have the\nconversation knowing that we come from very different places. Travel gives you\nthat.\n\nWhen it gets to like some of the ideation process, what sparks the inspiration\nfor the experiences you try to create? Is there any research or data that you\nlook at? Are there just trends that you look at to get inspired by? What kind\nof like starts that?\n\nThere\u2019s a mixture. I think we\u2019re probably the least analyzing organization.\nEven if it\u2019s a trend or some kind of mainstream stuff with the social media or\nall media, etc., it\u2019s too late. I think for me personally, it\u2019s always\nobserving what\u2019s being talked about. With AI, it\u2019s what aspects of AI actually\nare being totally omitted. There\u2019s a lot of focus now, for example, on\nelections and the visible impact of the AI, so how we can amplify this\ninformation, confusion and basically deteriorate trust into what we see, what\nwe hear, what we read. And it\u2019s super important. People are going to learn\nthat very quickly.\n\nI think what is happening is the invisible part, where businesses that are\ninterested in influencing political or non-political opinions around issues\nthat are critical for people will be using AI for analyzing the data. For\nhyper fast profiling of people in much more clever ways of addressing them\nwith more clever advertisements, in that it won\u2019t necessarily be paid \u2014 it\ndoesn\u2019t have to be. Or even how you design certain strategies, etc. that can\nbe augmented by how you use AI. And I think this is where I will be focusing\non rather than talking about that the deepfakes which we\u2019ve done already. But\nto the core of the question you asked about how we have topics that we focus\non, from the first day of Tactical Tech, we\u2019ve always based our work on\npartners, collaborators and people that we work with \u2014 and often that we are\ninvited to work with like a group of people or institutional organizations,\netc. And good listening is for me part of the critical research. So instead of\ncoming in a view and ideas of research questions, we listen to what questions\nare already there. Where the curiosity is, where the fears are, where the\nhopes are, and so on, and sometimes start to build backwards toward and think\nabout what you can bring from the position you occupy.\n\nIs there one collaboration or organization that you\u2019ve worked with before that\nyou felt was really impactful that you\u2019re the most proud of?\n\nThere are hundreds of those (laughs). We had this group of people from\nTajikistan \u2014 many people don\u2019t know what Tajikistan is. And they were amazing.\nThey were basically like a sponge, just sucking everything in and trying to\nengage with the culture cross between us and them and everybody else and\npeople from probably other countries and so on \u2014 it was massive. But everybody\nwas positive and trying to figure out some kind of common language that is\nbizarre English being mixed with some other languages, and so on. And that\nfirst encounter turned into a friendship and collaboration that led them to be\nthe key people that brought the whole open source tool to the school system in\nTajikistan, and so on, etc. I think that was one of these examples where it\nwas very positive, encouraging.\n\nWe do a lot of collaboration. So we have hundreds of partners now, especially\non our educational work. And I think the most successful series was with a\nnumber of groups in Brazil that we collaborated with because they really took\nthe content and the collaboration to the next level and took ownership of\nthat. And for me, the ideal scenario over the work we do is that we may be\ndeveloping something on the stage together, but there should be a moment when\nwe disappear from the stage and somebody else take that stage. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. And that\u2019s just beautiful to see. And when somebody tells you about\nthis product that is amazing, and they don\u2019t even know that you were part of\nthat, that is the best compliment you can get.\n\nMarek Tuszynski at Mozilla\u2019s Rise25 award ceremony in October 2023.\n\nWhat do you think is the biggest challenge we face in the world this year on\nand offline? How do we combat it?\n\nI think people have different challenges in different places. The first thing\nthat we are going to launch is a series of election influence situation rooms,\nwhich is just kind of a creative space that has the front of the house and\nback of the house that you would like to mount around some of the elections\nthat are happening \u2014 like U.S. or European Parliament, or many other\nelections. What we would like to showcase and kind of demystify is not only\nthe way we elect people, but how much the entire system works or doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAnd what we\u2019re trying to illustrate with this project \u201cthe situation rooms\u201d is\nto unpack it and show how important, for a lot of entities, confusion is. How\nimportant polarization is, how important the lack of trust towards specific\nformats of communication are, or how institutions fail, because in this\nenvironment it is much easier to put forward everything from conspiracy\ntheories to fake information, but it also makes people frustrated. It makes\npeople to be much more black and white and aligning themselves with things\nthat they would not align with earlier. I think this is the major thing that\nwe are focusing on this year. So the set of elections and how we can get\npeople engaged without any paranoia and any kind of dystopian way of thinking\nabout it. It helps ourselves in a way to build apparatus for recognizing this\nsituation we are in. And then let\u2019s build some methods for what we need to\nknow, to understand what is happening and then how that can be useful for\ndemocratic person elections, but how also it can be extremely harmful.\n\nWhat do you think is one action that everyone should take to make the world\nand our lives online a little bit better?\n\nTechnology is the bridge. Technologies open the channel of communications, so\non, etc. Use technology for that. Don\u2019t focus on yourself as much as you can\nfocus on the world and other people. And if technology can help you to\nunderstand where they\u2019re coming from, what the needs are and what kind of role\nyou can play from whatever level of privilege you may have, use it. And the\nfact that you may use better technologies and some people have access to it\nalready, that\u2019s a certain kind of privilege that I think we should be able to\nshare widely.\n\nYou use technology to engage other people who don\u2019t want to engage. Who lost\ntrust. Don\u2019t give up on them. Don\u2019t give up on people on the other side, those\nvoting for people you don\u2019t have any respect. They are lost. And part of the\nreason they are lost is the technology they\u2019re using.\n\nHow it is challenging the information and making them believe in things that\nthey shouldn\u2019t be believing in and that they probably wouldn\u2019t if that\ntechnology didn\u2019t happen. I think we passed this kind of libertarian way of\nusing technology for individual good that\u2019s going to turn everything into a\nbetter world. We have proven itself wrong many times by now.\n\nWe started Rise25 to celebrate Mozilla\u2019s 25th anniversary, what do you hope\npeople are celebrating in the next 25 years?\n\nI think Rise 25 was fantastic because it was nice to see all the kinds of\npeople. The 25 people who are so different in such different ways thinking\nabout tech and ideas, and so on, etc., and so diverse in many ways that you\ndon\u2019t see very often. And it gave people the space to actually vocalize what\nthey think and so on. And that was definitely unique. So I think Mozilla plays\na specific role in this kind of in-between sector thing where it\u2019s a\ncorporation in a city in San Francisco that builds tools, but it\u2019s also a\nfoundation.\n\nMozilla has unique access to people around the world that do a lot of creative\nwork around technology. And I think that should be celebrated. I don\u2019t think\nthere\u2019s enough of that. Usually people are celebrated for what they achieve\nwith technology, usually making a lot of money, and so on, etc., there\u2019s very\nlittle to talk about the technology that has positive impact on society in the\nworld. And I think Mozilla should be touching and showcasing that, and I think\nthere are plenty of things that can be celebrated.\n\nWhat gives you hope about the future of our world?\n\nYou know, it\u2019s going to be okay. Don\u2019t worry. But we are going to see people\nthat\u2019ll be happy and there will be people that separate. I think the more we\ncan do now for the next generations of people that are coming up now, the\nbetter. And if you\u2019re lucky to live long, you may feel proud for what you\u2019ve\nbeen doing \u2014 focus on that, rather than imagining or picturing some future\nmachine.\n\n### Get Firefox\n\nGet the browser that protects what\u2019s important\n\nPrevious Post\n\nRachel Hislop reflects on working for Beyonc\u00e9, creating community for Black\nwomen and the power of storytelling\n\nNext Post\n\nOpen Source in the Age of LLMs\n\n## Related Articles\n\nInternet Culture\n\n## Rachel Hislop reflects on working for Beyonc\u00e9, creating community for Black\nwomen and the power of storytelling\n\nRead More\n\nMozilla\n\n## Mozilla Announces Call for Entries for the 2nd Annual Rise25 Awards in\nDublin, Ireland\n\nRead More\n\nAI\n\n## How AI is unfairly targeting and discriminating against Black people\n\nRead More\n\n", "frontpage": false}
