He was 67.\n\nI can\u2019t remember when I first met Ross. It was well before 2008, when we\ncreated the Security and Human Behavior workshop. It was before 2001, when we\ncreated the Workshop on Economics and Information Security (okay, he created\nthat one, I just helped). It was before 1998, when we first wrote about the\ninsecurity of key escrow systems. In 1996, I was one of the people he brought\nto the Newton Institute at Cambridge University, for the six-month\ncryptography residency program he ran (I made a mistake not staying the whole\ntime)\u2014so it was before then as well.\n\nI know I was at the first Fast Software Encryption workshop in December 1993,\nthe first conference he created. There, I presented the Blowfish encryption\nalgorithm. Pulling an old first edition of Applied Cryptography (the one with\nthe blue cover) down from my shelf, I see his name in the acknowledgments.\nThis means that at either the 1992 Crypto conference in Santa Barbara or the\n1993 Eurocrypt in Lofthus, Norway, I, as an unpublished book author who had\nwritten a few cryptography articles for Dr. Dobb\u2019s Journal, asked him to read\nand comment on my book manuscript. And he said yes. Which means I mailed him a\npaper copy. And he read it, and mailed his handwritten comments back to me. In\nan envelope with stamps. Because that\u2019s how we did it back then.\n\nThis is back when \"crypto\" meant cryptography, and we would laugh when\nmilitary types said \"cyber\" or \"cybersecurity.\" We all called it \"computer\nsecurity\" and then \"Internet security.\"\n\nI have known Ross for over 30 years, both as a colleague and a friend. He was\nenthusiastic, brilliant, opinionated, articulate, curmudgeonly, and kind. Pick\nup any of his academic papers and articles\u2014there are 302 entries on his\nwebpage\u2014and odds are that you will find at least one unexpected insight that\nwill change how you think about security. He was a security engineer, but also\nvery much a generalist. He published on block cipher cryptanalysis in the\n1990s, on the security of large-language models last year, and on pretty much\neverything else in between.\n\nHis masterwork book, Security Engineering\u20141,200 pages in its third\nedition\u2014illustrates that breadth. It is as comprehensive a tome on computer\nsecurity and related topics as you could imagine. Twenty-nine chapters cover\neverything from access control to tamper resistance, from banking security to\nnuclear command and control, and from psychology to security printing. Every\npage is infused with his knowledge, expertise, wisdom, and uncanny ability to\ncut through the nonsense that too often surrounds traditional security\ndisciplines. (Also note his 15-lecture video series on that same webpage. If\nyou have never heard Ross lecture, you\u2019re in for a treat.)\n\nRoss was a pragmatic visionary. His mastery of both the technologies and the\nunderlying policy issues showed a deep command of multiple fields, and a rare\ncapability to both work within them and synthesize around them. He was also\nable to weave this knowledge into narratives that were both compelling and\ncomprehensible to the layperson. In his 1993 paper \"Why Cryptosystems Fail,\"\nhe pointed out that both cryptography and computer security got threat\nmodeling all wrong, and that we were solving the wrong problems. It\u2019s not the\nmath, he wrote; it\u2019s the implementation and the people and the procedures. In\n2001, he was the first person to recognize that security problems are often\nactually economic problems, kick-starting the academic discipline of security\neconomics.\n\nHe didn\u2019t suffer fools in either government or the corporate world, giving\nthem no quarter by disproving their security claims. As a graduate student, he\ndefended people accused of stealing from ATM machines by banks who maintained\nthat their security was foolproof. It was a pattern that repeated itself\nthroughout his career: analyze a real-world security system from all angles,\nunderstand how it fails, and then publish the results\u2014angering the powers in\ncharge of that security system.\n\nHere\u2019s one example of many. In 2014, he was hired as an expert witness to\ndefend people accused of tampering with the curfew tags used for offender\nmonitoring. He studied the physical tags and their security, and also the\neconomic, policy, and security implications of the tagging system. He even\nwent as far as to wear an ankle bracelet himself. It promptly broke, proving\nhis point. You can read the whole story in Chapter 14 of the third edition of\nhis book.\n\nThat sense of justice and confronting power infused much of his work. He\nfought against surveillance and backdoors. He and I were part of the second\nand third academic take-downs of government attempts to break encryption. His\n2022 rebuttal of child protection as a pretense to break encryption is\nparticularly scathing.\n\nRoss also fought for academic freedom, repeatedly publishing his findings in\nthe face of corporate threats. Many things we all use are more secure today\nbecause of Ross\u2019s work.\n\nHe was a blistering letter writer to those he believed deserved it. Verbally,\nhe could be a hurricane in your face if he disagreed with you, but he would\nalso engage with your points and was always willing to change his mind. And he\nenthused about, argued with, and listened to everybody: students, colleagues,\npartners of students and colleagues, random people he crossed paths with.\nEveryone was a sounding board for whatever ideas he had in is head.\n\nAnd his head was constantly filled with ideas\u2014mostly good, some not so\ngood\u2014and seemingly inexhaustible energy to implement them. He founded five\ndifferent conferences, including the Information Hiding Workshop and\nDecepticon. He co-founded the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. He founded the\nU.K.\u2019s Foundation for Information Policy Research, and wrote most of the\npapers that the organization submitted to Parliamentary Inquiries on dumb\nlegislative ideas. When the legislative center of power moved to Brussels, he\nhelped form the European Digital Rights organization to provide advice there.\n\nAll this was part of his gift of fostering community. And it\u2019s nowhere more\nevident than his legacy of graduate students at Cambridge University. His CV\nlists thirty-two of them, and seven more that he was currently advising. Many\nhave carried his legacy of pragmatic security analysis of real-world systems.\n\nRoss was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Royal\nAcademy of Engineering in 2009. In 2016, he was awarded the British Computer\nSociety\u2019s Lovelace Medal, the U.K.\u2019s top prize in computing. From 2021, he\nsplit his time as a professor between the University of Cambridge and the\nUniversity of Edinburgh and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of\nEdinburgh in 2023. He was absolutely rageful against Cambridge University for\nmaking him retire at 67\u2014and he was right.\n\nHe also played the bagpipes throughout his life. I dedicated a 1998\ncryptography paper, \"The Street Performer Protocol,\" to him because he \"spent\nsome of his youth busking on the streets of Germany with his bagpipes.\" Those\nwere good stories.\n\nHe is listed in the acknowledgments as a reader of every one of my books from\nBeyond Fear on. Recently, we\u2019d see each other a couple of times a year, at\nthis or that workshop or event. He hosted me at Security and Human Behavor at\nCambridge\u2019s Churchill College in 2022. The last time I saw him was last June\nat SHB in Pittsburgh. We were having dinner on Alessandro Acquisti\u2018s rooftop\npatio to celebrate another successful workshop. He was going to attend my\nWorkshop on Reimagining Democracy in December 2023, but had to cancel at the\nlast minute. The day before he died, we were discussing how to accommodate\neveryone who registered for this year\u2019s SHB workshop in December. I learned\nsomething from him every single time we talked. And I am not the only one.\n\nMy heart goes out to his wife Shireen, their daughter Bavani, and the rest of\ntheir family. We lost him much too soon.\n\nCategories: Computer and Information Security\n\nTags: Communications of the ACM\n\n  * Two clicks for more privacy: The Facebook Like button will be enabled once you click here.
