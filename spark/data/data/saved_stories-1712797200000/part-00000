You can, e.g, connect with your friends and choose to share\nyour private libraries with each other. So if you have a good mix of friends\nwho kept/ripped their CD/Vynil collection or bought songs from their favorite\nindie musicians, you can end up with a pretty extensive library. This makes it\na decent (and legal) alternative to sneaker-net piracy.\n\nIt also seems like a good alternative for indie labels who want to promote\ntheir artists. Set up an instance, get accounts for each artists and let them\nchoose if they want to have their catalog available to the public (or only for\npaying customers, or give an account for everyone that has bought at least one\nalbum from their artists, etc). All of that could be done, it doesn\u2019t really\ncost a lot to operate and it would make them less dependent on Spotify and/or\nBandcamp.\n\nThe most interesting thing though, it seems to me that, unlike Lemmy, Mastodon\nand Pixelfed, a music streaming instance does not depend on a \u201cboil the\noceans\u201d approach where the platform is only useful if it reaches a\nsubstantially large amount of users.\n\nThoughts? Why is it that Funkwhale is not being more talked about? Have you\ntried it? What is missing in your opinion?\n\nRaphael Lullis's Picture\n\n#### Raphael Lullis\n\nRead more posts by this author.\n\nhttps://raphael.lullis.net\n\n## Community is not enough\n\nRaphael Lullis\n\n", "frontpage": true}
