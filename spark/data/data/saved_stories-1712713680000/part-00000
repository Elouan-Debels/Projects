At the request of several fellow entrepreneurs (hi, Wade\nfrom Zapier!) I've mentioned this to, I'm sharing it publicly for the first\ntime. Hope you find it useful. -Dharmesh\n\nFor easy reference, you can access this page using FlashTags.org (it redirects\nhere).\n\nFrom HubSpot Wiki, July 19, 2017\n\nOne of the things I struggle with is clearly conveying to someone how strongly\nI feel about something. This is sometimes referred to as \"Hill Dying Status\"\n(i.e. do I feel so strongly about this that it's a hill I'm willing to die\non). By the way, not sure who originally used that phrase but I think it was\nBrian Halligan or maybe JD Sherman. Doesn't matter.\n\nSituations like the following happen for me multiple times a day (chances are,\nthey happen to you too):\n\n  1. I come across an interesting article or video (sometimes about a competitor) and send it along to someone at HubSpot. Without context, they might think that I'm saying we should be doing that or adding that feature or somehow reacting to that news. But, most of the time, it's just something that I thought was \"interesting\".\n  2. Someone asks me a question or opinion on something. Turns out, I have opinions on everything. Sometimes, those opinions are even well informed. So, I share my opinion. Might be a hallway conversation or an email or whatever. Now, based on my history with that person, they may think: \"Well, Dharmesh thinks I should do X so I'm going to do that, even though I was going to do Y.\" This is a problem because I almost always have much less information/data than the person asking the question \u2013 and I haven't really dug into the issue like they have. They're overvaluing my opinion.\n  3. Every now and then I feel super strongly about something. (Often, these are \"Solve For The Customer\" -- SFTC -- related). I \"express\" my feelings in a response to a long email thread. It gets buried in there, and then \"dies\". Nobody does anything. Not even a response. That makes me sad \u2013 but it's my fault. The person I had expected to at least respond had no idea that I felt strongly or wanted a response.\n\nSo, I now share with you my not-so-secret hack to quickly communicate\nimportant context (either in a conversation or in an email thread). I've been\nusing this for a while, and thought you mind find it useful as well.\n\nHow To Use A #FlashTag To Quickly Communicate Hill Dying Status\n\nIt's even easier than Sunday morning (which I've always found to be a poor\nbenchmark): All you have to do is include one of the flashtags below in an\nemail, Slack or even in a conversation. That's it.\n\nThe tags are in ascending order of escalation (starting with the \u201cI don\u2019t feel\nstrongly at all\u201d to the \u201cI really, really feel strongly\").\n\n#fyi -- Had this thought/idea/article/video/whatever pass through my brain. I\nhaven't spent a lot of time thinking about it. You can read it or not. Act on\nit or not. No response needed or expected.\n\nHill Dying Status (am I willing to die on this hill): I don't even see a hill.\n\n#suggestion -- Here's something I would do if I were you. But, I'm not you --\nand you own this, so your call. Just consider it and weigh it against other\nthings you're considering. I won't be offended if you go another way. A quick\nreaction/response would be appreciated (so I can learn what kinds of\nsuggestions are useful/valuable), but is not necessary.\n\nHill Dying Status: I saw the hill, but didn't feel strongly enough to commit\nthe calories to climb it.\n\n#recommendation (or #strongrecommendation)-- I've thought about this a lot.\nIt's kept me up at night. I dug in. I think I understand the tradeoffs. You\ncan choose not to take the recommendation, and go your own way, but please do\nit for good reasons. Please dig in a bit yourself and have a well-reasoned\nrationale for why you don\u2019t want to take the recommendation. Please don\u2019t\nignore or dismiss it out of hand. A response (either way) is politely\nrequested. If it's a #strongrecommendation then a response explaining why\nyou're not taking it is probably a good idea.\n\nHill Dying Status: I climbed the hill. I breathed deeply I contemplated my\nlife. I walked back down.\n\n#plea -- We don't like issuing edicts or directives at HubSpot. But...please,\nplease, please just do this. Trust works both ways, and I need you to trust me\non this. If you still feel compelled to resist, something\u2019s not right, let's\nchat. Maybe even in (gasp!) person.\n\nHill Dying Status: Dying on a hill is not on my bucket list, but if it were\nthis would be a really good candidate. --- That's it. With just a few extra\ncharacters in that email or Slack, you can quickly convey how strongly you\nfeel about something. Use it if you find it useful. It's just a #suggestion.\n\nCheers, Dharmesh\n\np.s. Why did I call it a #FlashTag? Because it's about communicating something\nin a flash (and flash rhymes with hash). And yes, I asked GrowthBot for \"words\nthat rhyme with hash\".\n\nOh, and in case you need to find this article again or tell somebody about it,\njust use FlashTags.org (it redirects to this page).\n\n#### Eoin Ryan\n\n4/2/2019, 8:26:02 PM\n\nThat's seems like it would be very, very effective, thanks for making it so\neasy to copy.\n\nIt'll be like an alien language in the firm I work at but I'm looking forward\nto trying it.\n\n## Related Posts\n\nSaaS 101: 7 Simple Lessons From Inside HubSpot\n\nstrategy July 19, 2010\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over 4 years since I officially launched my internet\nmarketing software company, HubSpot.
