However,\n> parties may disagree on how the information they need to share should be\n> used. We argue that many of these concerns reduce to 'the copy problem':\n> once a bit of information is copied and shared, the sender can no longer\n> control how the recipient uses it. From the perspective of each\n> collaborator, this presents a dilemma that can inhibit collaboration. The\n> copy problem is often amplified by three related problems which we term the\n> bundling, edit, and recursive enforcement problems. We find that while the\n> copy problem is not solvable, aspects of these amplifying problems have been\n> addressed in a variety of disconnected fields. We observe that combining\n> these efforts could improve the governability of information flows and\n> thereby incentivise collaboration. We propose a five-part framework which\n> groups these efforts into specific capabilities and offers a foundation for\n> their integration into an overarching vision we call \"structured\n> transparency\". We conclude by surveying an array of use-cases that\n> illustrate the structured transparency principles and their related\n> capabilities.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Computers and Society (cs.CY)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2012.08347 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2012.08347v2 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2012.08347arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Andrew Trask [view email] [v1] Tue, 15 Dec 2020 15:03:25 UTC (197 KB)\n[v2] Tue, 12 Mar 2024 16:09:35 UTC (397 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Beyond Privacy Trade-offs with Structured\nTransparency, by Andrew Trask and Emma Bluemke and Teddy Collins and Ben\nGarfinkel Eric Drexler and Claudia Ghezzou Cuervas-Mons and Iason Gabriel and\nAllan Dafoe and William Isaac\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2012\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CY\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### DBLP - CS Bibliography\n\nlisting | bibtex\n\nAndrew Trask Ben Garfinkel Allan Dafoe\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
