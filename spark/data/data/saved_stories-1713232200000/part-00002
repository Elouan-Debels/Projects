Ron DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature.\n\nIn its ruling last week, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach\nthrew out five felony wiretapping convictions against Michael Leroy Waite, 63,\nof Floral City. Waite has been engaged in a lengthy dispute over access to his\nproperty with the Citrus County Sheriff's Office as far back as 2018. The\nsituation escalated after wildlife officers \u2013 accompanied by deputies holding\nrifles \u2013 sprayed herbicides in a canal off the Withlacoochee River along\nWaite\u2019s property in west-central Florida.\n\n\u201cThe sheriff jumped on the airboat, trespassed onto my private property and\npointed assault rifles at me as they ripped up and stole my \u2018No Trespassing\u2019\nsigns,\u201d Waite said in an interview. He called the court\u2019s decision\ngroundbreaking: \u201cI think a lot of people are going to be citing my case in the\nfuture,\u201d he said.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies said Waite aimed a rifle at the officials spraying the\nherbicides.\n\n\u201cThe people out there doing the spraying for the herbicides for the county,\nthey were in fear that this guy was going to do something, try to shoot them,\ntry to kill them,\u201d deputy Ryan Glaze testified in the case. Glaze said Waite\nhad \u201csovereign citizen ideologies,\u201d referring to the anti-government movement\nwhose followers believe that courts have no jurisdiction over them.\n\n##### Related\n\n#### Controversial Florida bill blocking civilian review boards from\ninvestigating cops heads to DeSantis: The measure would affect at least 21\ncities with civilian review boards, including Orlando\n\nWaite disputed that he was a sovereign citizen. \u201cTotally false,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\nonly time I ever used the word \u2018sovereign\u2019 was to claim my private property is\nnot state sovereignty land.\u201d\n\nIn January 2021, Waite called 911 to report what he believed was a trespassing\nincident by the sheriff and said he wanted to have the call recorded for a\ncomplaint against the sheriff. That same day, Sergeant Edward Blair called\nWaite back \u2013 and Waite recorded the three-minute phone conversation but did\nnot inform Blair he was doing so, the court said.\n\nWaite emailed his recording of the call to the sheriff's office records\ndepartment and requested an internal investigation. A month later, Waite was\naccused of five counts of illegal wiretapping for recording the conversation\nwith the sergeant and four other calls with sheriff\u2019s employees.\n\nThe appeals court on Friday overturned the trial judge\u2019s decision and ordered\nthe judge to dismiss the wiretapping charges.\n\n\u201cUnder these circumstances, it cannot be said that any of the deputies\nexhibited a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is willing to\nrecognize,\u201d the court said.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office on Monday declined to make Citrus County Sheriff Mike\nPrendergast available to discuss the matter.\n\nIt wasn't clear whether the court\u2019s decision affects secretly recording the\ntelephone conversations of other government employees in Florida conducting\nofficial business. It said Waite\u2019s recording was allowed because there was \u201cno\ndispute that all conversations concerned matters of public business, occurred\nwhile the deputies were on duty, and involved phones utilized for work\npurposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis really broadens up the public\u2019s ability to hold police officers\naccountable for their actions,\u201d Waite said. \u201cThey have no expectation of\nprivacy when they\u2019re conducting official business and it doesn\u2019t matter where\nthey\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nThe same day as the court\u2019s ruling, DeSantis signed into law two bills\naffecting law enforcement in Florida. Two judges on the panel that issued the\nruling Friday were DeSantis appointees.\n\nOne new law makes it illegal after a person has been warned to approach first\nresponders or remain within 25 feet while they are performing a legal duty if\nthe intent is to interfere, threaten or harass them. The new law doesn\u2019t\nprevent people from recording law enforcement but can require them to move 25\nfeet back, which can make it more difficult.\n\nThe other requires that citizen review boards in Florida \u2013 intended to provide\nindependent oversight of law enforcement actions \u2013 be re-established so that\nmembers are appointed by a sheriff or police chief and that at least one\nmember be a retired law enforcement officer.\n\nWaite was separately convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer and\nresisting arrest with violence after he was accused of striking a deputy with\nhis elbow when they arrived to arrest him on the wiretapping charges. Waite\nurged the appeals court to throw out those charges, too, but the judges\ndeclined.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I grabbed his arms to put him under arrest, to put them behind his\nback, that\u2019s when I catch an elbow to my face, to my lower right jaw,\u201d said\nGlaze, the deputy who arrested Waite. He said Waite surrendered after a\ndetective shocked him with an electrical device.\n\nThe judge sentenced Waite on all the charges to two years\u2019 probation. He had\nfaced up to 25 years in prison and fines of $25,000.\n\n\u201cWaite did not demonstrate a lack of good faith and should have complied\nwithout resorting to violence,\u201d the judges said.\n\nThe court ruling Friday also was silent on the issue of whether the sheriff\ncommitted any misconduct: \u201cWe in no way suggest the CCSO committed police\nmisconduct,\u201d the ruling said. \u201cRather, this was how Waite perceived the\nsituation.\u201d\n\nWaite said his case will help the public hold law enforcement accountable and\nprevent officer misconduct.\n\n\u201cBringing these subjects to lay helps us maintain a civil society and civil\ngovernment to be accountable for their actions,\u201d Waite said. \u201cThe public, we\njust try to enjoy our property without people coming on trespassing and\ndestroying it.\u201d ___\n\nThis story was produced by Fresh Take Florida, a news service covering\nbusiness news from the University of Florida College of Journalism and\nCommunications.

Ron DeSantis Thursday quietly signed into law one of the business\nlobby\u2019s top priorities this year, preempting local governments from passing\nlaws on workplace heat safety measures to protect outdoor workers from heat\nexhaustion.\n\nThe bill, HB 433, also preempts the regulation of employer scheduling\npractices to the state, and \u2014 effective Sept. 30, 2026 \u2014 will strip local\n\u201cliving wage\u201d laws passed in some Florida cities and counties that require\ntheir contractors to pay employees a wage that\u2019s higher than the state\u2019s\nminimum. An earlier version of the bill would have preempted all local\nmandates affecting the terms and conditions of employment.\n\nDeSantis signed the bill in its final version Thursday night, after hours,\nwith no statement or fanfare.\n\nFlorida Democrats on Friday criticized the move.\n\n\"Outdoor workers are all around us \u2013 working on construction sites, repairing\nand paving roads, picking fruit and vegetables on farms and more,\" said\nFlorida Sen. Victor Torres, D-Orlando, in a statement.\n\n\"They\u2019re just trying to make a living for their families \u2013 and instead of\nputting protections in place to ensure businesses are prioritizing their\nworkers\u2019 health and well-being from record-setting temperatures, we tied the\nhands of proactive local governments to do so,\" Torres continued. \"This bill\nis an attack on our outdoor workers \u2013 the rent is too damn high and the sun is\ntoo damn hot!\u201d\n\nSponsored by Republican Tiffany Esposito, a first-term member of the Florida\nHouse, the bill was a priority of the Florida Chamber of Commerce \u2014 a deep-\npocketed business lobbying group that represents the interests of companies\nlike Publix, AT&T, restaurant chains, and U.S. Sugar, which fork over tens of\nthousands of dollars to help fund their political operations.\n\nRecords obtained by the investigative newsletter Seeking Rents show the\nChamber was also directly involved in drafting the language of the\nlegislation, along with a conservative think-tank that was behind a new law\nrolling back certain child labor protections.\n\n> The bill was a priority of the Florida Chamber of Commerce \u2014 a business\n> lobbying group that represents the interests of companies like Publix, AT&T,\n> restaurant chains, and U.S. Sugar\n>\n> tweet this\n\nEsposito herself, who argued the bill was in the best interest of taxpayers,\nis herself the president of a regional chamber of commerce in Southwest\nFlorida.\n\nThousands of working Floridians could be affected by the preemption of local\nliving wage laws alone, which have been implemented over the years in\nexpensive areas of the state, like St. Petersburg and Miami, in order to lift\nwages for workers on contracted public projects \u2014 like building and road\nconstruction \u2014 as well as airport workers.\n\nLocal governments in Florida have been barred from requiring private employers\nto pay above minimum wage for more than 20 years.\n\nThe idea of the so-called \u201cliving wage\u201d laws is that if you\u2019re an employer who\nwants to enter into a government, taxpayer-funded contract, you have to pay\nyour workers at least something closer to a living wage \u2014 which, generally,\nunder these laws is somewhere between at least $15 to $20 minimum depending on\nthe city or county.\n\nIdeally, workers covered by these contracts are locals \u2014 friends and neighbors\nof these communities who contribute to the local economy and who may not be\nable to live comfortably on less.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce has been trying to gut these living wage laws in\nFlorida for years, framing wage and benefit mandates as \u201cunnecessary\ngovernment interference.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawmakers in other parts of the country are passing job killing mandates at\nthe local level,\u201d reads a legislative agenda released by the Chamber for the\n2024 session. \u201cWe need to keep Florida, Florida by allowing employers to\nflourish free of unnecessary governmental interference and inconsistencies.\u201d\n\nFor workers who benefit from these local laws, however, the new bill could\ncreate confusion and inconsistency. It also could result in cuts to pay once\nthat portion of the bill goes into effect on Sept. 30, 2026 \u2014 the day\nFlorida\u2019s $15 minimum wage also fully goes into effect.\n\nThe statewide minimum wage is currently $12 an hour, or $7.98 for tipped\nworkers, and will rise $1 each year on Sept. 30 before reaching $15 by Sept.\n30, 2026 under a ballot initiative approved by 61% of Florida voters in 2020.\n\nRep. Esposito, the GOP House sponsor of the bill, admitted during session that\nemployers could decide to reduce pay \u2014 the income that supports Florida\u2019s\nworking families \u2014 once this is effective.\n\n\u201cCould wages go down? Maybe,\u201d she said during the bill\u2019s first committee\nhearing. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the prerogative of the employer.\u201d The chair of that\ncommittee cut the public off from providing personal testimony. Dozens had\nsigned up to speak.\n\nEsposito herself could not say how many workers across the state would be\naffected by the preemption, which broadly ties the hands of local government\nleaders. So the full scope of the preemption, while standing to affect\nthousands of airport workers and other contracted workers in South Florida\nalone, is still unclear.\n\n##### Related\n\n#### Florida Republican cuts public comment on bill that could affect wages of\nthousands of workers: The proposal would in part erase local living wage laws\nin cities like Orlando, Tampa and Miami\n\nThe preemption of heat safety mandates for working Floridians, on the other\nhand, was a direct attack on a local ordinance being considered in Miami-Dade\nCounty last year.\n\nThat ordinance sought to require construction and agriculture companies,\nspecifically, to take steps to protect their employees from heat exhaustion.\nFor instance, ensuring they have access to water and giving them 10-minute,\nshaded breaks every couple of hours when the heat index is at least 95\ndegrees.\n\nFollowing industry backlash, that ordinance was delayed for a vote last fall\nuntil mid-March \u2014 after session had already ended and House Bill 433 passed\nthe state legislature. The bill was filed for consideration by lawmakers this\nyear just a week after the vote on that local ordinance was delayed last fall.\n\nMiami-Dade County was the only municipality in Florida considering such an\nordinance, which has been proposed at the state level by Democrats but has\nfailed to garner enough interest from the Republican majority to make much\nprogress.\n\nAs it is, there is no federal or state standard in Florida for heat exposure\nprotections in the workplace. Just a few states \u2014 California, Washington, and\nOregon \u2014 have their own state laws requiring certain workplace heat safety\nmeasures.\n\nColorado also regulates heat exposure requirements for farmworkers, while\nMinnesota has heat standards for workers indoors. As any warehouse worker can\ntell you (we heard this from UPS workers here in Orlando, for instance) \u2014 it\u2019s\nnot just those laboring outside who stand to suffer from Florida\u2019s scorching\nheat.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only getting hotter in Florida. Opponents of the bill argued that\nfailing to act on workplace heat safety protections could be costly due to\nlost productivity. An agricultural worker in Apopka told us the bill is\n\u201cunjust\u201d and \u201cunfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis cruel and shameful action by Governor DeSantis, our Republican-led\nLegislature, and a small group of powerful industry lobbyists will endanger\nthe lives of our working families and cause preventable deaths,\u201d Oscar\nLondo\u00f1o, co-executive director of the immigrant advocacy group WeCount! Shared\nin an email newsletter on Friday.\n\nThe bill passed the Republican-dominated state legislature on the final day of\nFlorida\u2019s legislative session last month, largely along party lines. Four\nRepublicans joined Florida Democrats in opposing the bill in the state Senate,\nwhile four Republicans similarly crossed party lines to vote it down in the\nFlorida House.\n\nGOP House member Mike Beltran, who voted in opposition to the bill, explained\nhis vote by stating he only opposed the heat safety preemption provision.\n\n\u201cDue to Florida\u2019s unusually hot climate, the variation thereof throughout the\nstate, and the diverse economy, I believe that local regulation may be\nappropriate,\" he said.\n\nThe preemption on regulating workplace heat exposure and scheduling goes into\neffect July 1, while the preemption on wage and benefit mandates will go into\neffect Sept. 30, 2026.\n\n##### Related\n\n#### Pressure builds for Florida Gov.
