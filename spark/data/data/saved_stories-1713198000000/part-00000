To put it in mathematical terms: . To find , you can use\nthe following formula:\n\nSince we interested in length of the number, and not in its logarithm value,\nwe need to add to the result 1 count leading digit as well.\n\nPutting everything together, you can use this approach:\n\n    \n    \n    public static int numDigits(int number) { if (number == 0) return 1; return (int) (Math.log10(Math.abs(number)) + 1); }\n\n#math #productivity #ti\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
