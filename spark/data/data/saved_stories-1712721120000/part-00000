Part of languages Esperanto cs\ncommunity\n\nUpdate 2024-04-09: Minor rephrasings for better readability.\n\n## Introduction\n\nEsperanto started in 1887 with the publication of the book \u201cUnua libro\u201d. Today\nthe book \u201cFundamento de Esperanto\u201d is more important to the language project,\nbut its differences are marginal. Since the beginning of the language, the\nquestion of governance was crucial. L. L. Zamenhof wanted to learn from\nhistory and unlike Volap\u00fck did not follow the idea of a benevolent dictator.\nGovernance? Benevolent dictator? Reminds me of free open source software and\ngovernance models. Time for a discussion.\n\n## Remarks by Clemens Setz\n\nI got triggered comparing the open source movement with Esperanto by reading\nthe book \u201eDie Bienen und das Unsichtbare\u201c. At page 290 in section \u201eDie gro\u00dfe\nBefreiung: Esperanto\u201c subsection \u201eHerkunft\u201c, it says:\n\n> Open Source, das ist das wichtige Prinzip. Sprachenerfinder teilen sich in\n> zwei Kategorien: P\u00e4pste und Programmierer. Charles Bliss war 100 Prozent\n> Papst. Am Ende war er sogar ein Papst ohne Kirche, alle praktizierten die\n> von ihm verwaltete Religion falsch, ohne Synode, ohne Dogma. Er allein blieb\n> orthodox und treu, blind und gehorsam, bis zum Ende. Johann Martin Schleyer\n> war ebenfalls eine p\u00e4pstliche Erscheinung, er gab das Papstamt mit dem Tod\n> an den N\u00e4chsten weiter.\n>\n> Aber es gab auch Programmierer. Damit bezeichne ich jene Sprachenerfinder,\n> die schon fr\u00fch Testl\u00e4ufe und Beta-Versionen ihrer Sprache anzetteln und\n> ihren source code m\u00f6glichst rasch f\u00fcr die \u00d6ffentlichkeit zug\u00e4nglich machen\n> und die alle Teilnehmer zur Anreichung und Aneignung auffordern, die also\n> auf jedes geistige Besitztum \u00fcber ihre Sprache verzichten. Und Dr. Zamenhof\n> war eindeutig ein Programmierer. 1905, beim allerersten Esperanto-\n> Weltkongress, gab er mit mehreren Unterzeichnern eine 5-Punkte-Deklaration\n> ab, die unter anderem die Feststellung enth\u00e4lt: \u00bbEsperanto geh\u00f6rt niemandem.\n> Jeder Mensch kann es verwenden, wie er m\u00f6chte.\u00ab Au\u00dferdem \u00bbEsperanto ist\n> keiner rechtlichen Autorit\u00e4t unterstellt, weder einer staatlichen Beh\u00f6rde\n> noch einer Person.\u00ab Man einigt sich auf das Betriebssystem, das sprachliche\n> Fundament. Der Rest war beliebig erweiter- und erg\u00e4nzbar.\n\n\u2014 Original text from the book \u201eDie Bienen und das Unsichtbare\u201c\n\nA rough translation to English:\n\n> Open Source, that\u2019s the important principle. Language designers split into\n> two categories: Popes and programmers. Charles Bliss was a pope by 100\n> percent. In the end, he was even a pope without a church. Everyone practiced\n> his maintained religion wrongfully, without synod, without dogma. He\n> remained orthodox and faithfully, blind and obedient until the end. Johann\n> Martin Schleyer also appeared as pope. He forwarded his pontifical duties to\n> his successor when he died.\n>\n> But there were also programmers. I call those language designers that way,\n> if they initiated test runs and beta versions in an early stage of their\n> language. They published their source code quickly and asked followers for\n> enrichments and appropriation. In this sense, they abstain from their\n> intellectual property of the language. And Dr. Zamenhof was certainly a\n> programmers. In 1905 at the very first Esperanto world congress, multiple\n> signatories signed a 5-points-declaration which includes the following\n> statement: \u2018Esperanto belongs to no one. Anyone can use it for any reason\n> they like.\u2019 Furthermore \u2018Esperanto depends on no legal authority, neither a\n> governing body nor an individual.\u2019 So one agrees upon the operating system;\n> the linguistic basis. The rest is arbitrarily extensible.\n\nFor context: Charles Bliss invented Blissymbols. Johann Martin Schleyer\ninvented Volap\u00fck. L. L. Zamenhof (or Dr. Zamenhof) invented Esperanto.\n\n## Contextualization of Esperanto\n\nConstructed languages (abbr. conlang) are not rare at all. People have been\ninventing them for a long time. It just seems that during the 18th and 19th\ncentury, people saw a need to interact with other peoples more. Thus many new\nconlangs appeared.\n\nSpecifically, I opened Wikipedia\u2019s list of constructed languages, extracted\nall tables, normalized the data (e.g, assigned 1500 for \u201c16th century\u201d), and\nsorted all 128 conlangs by their appearance:\n\nUtopian (1516), Logopandecteision (1653), Ruski jezik (1666), Unnamed language\n(1668), Solresol (1827), Communicationssprache (1839), Universalglot (1868),\nVolap\u00fck (1879), Volap\u00fck (1880), Esperanto (1887), Esperanto (1887), Mundolinco\n(1888), Bolak, \"Blue Language\" (1899), Tutonish (1901), Idiom Neutral (1902),\nLatino sine Flexione (1903), Ro (1904), Ido (1907), Ido (1907), Adjuvilo\n(1910), Quenya (1910), Zaum (1913), Sindarin (1915), Eskayan (1920), Timerio\n(1921), Interlingue (1922), Interlingue (1922), Basic English (1925), Isotype\n(1925), Novial (1928), Novial (1928), Medefaidrin (1930), Sona (1935), Khuzdul\n(1935), Esperanto II (1937), Syldavian (1938), Mondial (1940), E-Prime (1940),\nTsolyani (1940), Interglossa (1943), Plain English (1948), Blissymbols (1949),\nBlissymbols (1949), Newspeak (1949), Interlingua (1951), Interlingua (1951),\nBordurian (1954), Loglan (1955), Intal (1956), Romanid (1956), Lingua\nsistemfrater (1957), Special English (1959), Lincos (1960), Neo (1961), Babm\n(1962), aUI (1962), Teonaht (1962), Spocanian (1962), Nadsat slang (1962),\nGuosa (1965), Lingua Franca Nova (1965), Unilingua (now Mirad) (1966), Vulcan\n(1966), Arcaicam Esperantom (1969), Afrihili (1970), International Sign\n(1970), Koba\u00efan (1970), Eurolengo (1972), Lapine (1972), Interlac (1973),\nPakuni (1974), Glosa (1975), Kotava (1978), Ithkuil (1978), Kotava (1978),\nKlingon (1979), Damin (1980), Gargish (1981), L\u00e1adan (1982), Simplified\nTechnical English (1983), L\u00e1adan (ldn) (1984), Uropi (1986), Lojban (1987),\nLojban (1987), Poliespo (1990), Runyakitara (1990), Rom\u00e1ni\u00e7o (1991), Palawa\nkani (1992), D\u2019ni (1993), Attempto Controlled English (1995), Verdurian and\nothers (1995), Europanto (1996), Unish (1996), Baronh (1996), Brithenig\n(1996), Goa\u2019uld (1997), Lingua Franca Nova (1998), Parallel English (1998),\nSlovio (1999), Toki Pona (2001), Atlantean (2001), Wenedyk (Venedic) (2002),\nGlobish (2004), Ku (2005), Loxian (2005), Enchanta (2005), Romance Neolatino\n(2006), Slovianski (2006), M\u00e4nti (2006), Hymmnos (2006), Sambahsa-Mundialect\n(2007), Dritok (2007), Neoslavonic (2009), Budinos (2009), K\u0113len (2009), Na\u02bcvi\n(2009), Moss (2009), Lingwa de planeta (2010), Interslavic (2011), The\nDothraki (2011), Barsoomian (2012), Trigedasleng (2014), Belter Creole (2014),\nKiliki (2015), Beama (2016), Wenja (2016), Interslavic (2019), Romulan (2019).\n\nIn conclusion, Esperanto from 1887 is really just one among many and on the\n10th position at this list. It had the opportunity to learn from nine previous\nconlangs. Did it make progress when it comes to governance?\n\nA quick web search lead to almost nothing about the nine languages. I just\nfound a lonely reddit thread with some notes by the questioner. So let us\nstick to Clemens' Setz' argument for comparing {Blissymbols, Volap\u00fck} with\n{Esperanto}.\n\n## Declaration of Boulogne (1905)\n\nThe Declaration on the Essence of Esperantism was ratified in 1905 and\nestablishes the relationship between the Esperanto movement and its founder.\nIt contains the phrases, Clemens Setz' mentioned:\n\n  1. Esperantism is a movement that supports the introduction of an international auxiliary language (IAL). No further meaning can be attached to it. It is politically, religiously, and morally neutral, and it does not seek to replace any existing languages, only to supplement them.\n\n  2. It recognizes that Esperanto is the most realistic IAL that exists, and they work to further it based on this goal.\n\n  3. Esperanto belongs to no one. Anyone can use it for any reason they like.\n\n  4. Fundamento de Esperanto is the single, perpetual obligatory authority over Esperanto, and it cannot be modified. Otherwise, Esperanto depends on no legal authority, neither a governing body nor an individual, including Zamenhof himself. If a linguistic matter is not covered in Fundamento, it is up to the individual on how to handle the matter.\n\n  5. An Esperantist is a fluent Esperanto speaker. Involvement in the Esperanto community is encouraged but not required.\n\nClearly in point number 4, Zamenhof distanced himself from dictatorship of his\nlanguage project and handed it over to the community. And point 3 establishes\nunlimited use of Esperanto for everyone everywhere. Let us compare this with\nthe idea of free open source software (FOSS).\n\n## Free software\n\nGNU defines \u2018free software\u2019 through four freedoms:\n\n  1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).\n\n  2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n\n  3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).\n\n  4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n\nWe observe that point 3 of Esperanto\u2019s declaration is very similar to freedom\n0. In the case of Esperanto, the publication of the book La unua libro (and\nsubsequently but to a lower extent, the Fundamento de Esperanto) was an\nexpensive, tiresome process. The question of redistribution of this work of\nart is left in the hands of the publisher compared to GNU, where the answer is\nclearly addressed in freedom 2 and 3.\n\n## Open Source\n\nBut GNU might have controversial or narrow views on the matter. It advocates\nthe Copyleft clause in software licensing and had a controversial leading\nfigure. So I will not dive into discussions about the GNU manifesto and Bill\nGates' Open Letter to Hobbyists.\n\nInstead, one might accept the open source initiative as authority. It defines\nthe following freedoms as \u2018Open Source\u2019:\n\n  1. Free Redistribution\n\n  2. Source Code inclusion and distribution\n\n  3. Derived works\n\n  4. Integrity of The Author\u2019s Source Code\n\n  5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups\n\n  6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor\n\n  7. Distribution of License\n\n  8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product\n\n  9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software\n\n  10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral\n\nWhat is interesting here is point number 6, which is explained in more detail\nas \u201cthe license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a\nspecific field of endeavor\u201d. Point number 4 declares \u201cthe license may restrict\nsource-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows\nthe distribution of \u2018patch files\u2019 with the source code for the purpose of\nmodifying the program at build time\u201d. In this case (unlike Esperanto), a\nmechanism is implemented which allows the original author to define whether\nmodifications are possible. In the case of Esperanto, the book Fundamento de\nEsperanto is defined as single authority and everyone is welcome to make\nchanges as long as they do not contradict the Fundamento.\n\n## License versus Governance\n\nBut licensing itself does not match the usecase Esperanto had. Esperanto\nwanted to define its governance. Licenses define policies for distribution and\nmodification rights. Instead, we need to look at governance models.\n\nAs it turns out, they are vast. The benevolent dictator is popular just like\nvery democratic approaches in the debian project. python had placed its\noriginal author in the role of a benevolent dictator for life. PHP was\nreleased by its author first, taken over by a company (Zend), introduced a\nmore democratic process (voting inside the PHP Group), and finally was put\nunder governance of the PHP Foundation. rust always (at least since the 1.0\nrelease) had working groups which voted or decided about the adoption of a\nrequest for change.\n\nIn the end, we cannot exactly clearly match Esperanto ideas from 1905 to\nmodern equivalents, but I think we got an intuition that some ideas are\nshared. And the main point remains true: Esperanto followed ideas similar to\nFOSS but many years before.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n  * Clemens Setz focused on the author. Here Esperanto - unlike Volap\u00fck and Blissymbols - do not to rely on a single authority.\n\n  * GNU (in the 1980s) defines freedoms for its software to make sure they serve the broad community just like Esperanto did in 1905.\n\n  * Esperanto and FOSS disallows restriction of their work for specific usecases.\n\nWechsle zu Deutsch.
