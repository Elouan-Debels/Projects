Lost for 300-plus years, the \u201choly\ngrail\u201d of shipwrecks has now been found, and its treasure will finally start\ncoming to the surface as a result of an effort by the Colombian government.\n\nThe Spanish-owned San Jos\u00e9 galleon was no match for the British Navy. Near\nCartagena in 1708, the ship\u2014heading home from the American continents with 200\ntons of gold coins, among other treasures\u2014was sunk by the British. Only a few\nof the 600-person crew survived after the gunpowder store on the ship\nexploded.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * Homer\u2019s \u2018The Iliad\u2019 Poem Leads to Shipwreck Finds\n\nThe 64-gun, three-mast ship lay on the ocean floor for over 300 years until\nColombia announced its discovery in 2015. Of course, there\u2019s a legal battle\naround the ship, as U.S.-based Sea Search Armada\u2014which laid claim to the wreck\nafter saying it located the San Jos\u00e9 in 1981\u2014is being largely shut out of any\ntreasure by the Colombian government. That case is now before the United\nNation\u2019s Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\nThe actual location of the shipwreck is being kept secret for obvious safety\nand security reasons.\n\nWith conservative estimates place the worth of the treasure at billions of\ndollars, the Colombian government stated that (possibly by the end of April)\nit will start hauling valuables to the surface.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in history, a model of comprehensive public management of\nthe archaeological site and property of cultural interest is being put\nforward, protected by regulations and public missionality,\u201d the Colombian\ngovernment wrote in a translated statement.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * The 30 Coolest Shipwrecks in the World\n\nThe government states that the San Jos\u00e9 galleon signifies an \u201cinvaluable\ncultural heritage\u201d site for Colombia, and will be managed as such. That\nincludes spending more than $1 million on the recovery effort.\n\nA remotely operated vehicle in 2022 showed that the treasure won\u2019t be hard to\nspot. Dipping nearly 3,000 feet into the ocean, the video from the ROV showed\ngold ingots and coins, cannons from the 1650s, and a variety of collectibles.\n\nThose remotely operated vehicles will be put back into action. The plan calls\nfor the underwater robot to bring items on the galleon that are comparably\neasy to access above water, allowing scientists to see how different pieces of\nthe ship (and the treasure it holds) react to being brought to the surface.\n\nFinally, this \u201choly grail\u201d will be recovered.\n\nTim Newcomb\n\nTim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.
