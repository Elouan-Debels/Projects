Not sure if this is the appropriate place, but how does\none get an SPD majority? I've seen people talk about it, but I've only managed\nabout 43%. I generally target: - WTB Plan - Make everything about the WTB\n(campaigning, Iron Front etc.) - Deport Hitler - End reparations\n\nWhat else should I do? Does the War Guilt Inquiry do anything?\n\nReply\n\nFinardin7 hours ago\n\nWhat do you need to do to deport Hitler?\n\nReply\n\nHarmann Muller5 hours ago\n\nInstructions on how to deport the Austrian artist back to Austria:\n\nStep 1: Take control of the justice ministry and the interior ministry. The\nSPD is of course still in government.\n\nStep 2: Increase employee loyalty of the Ministry of Internal Affairs once. So\nthat they could achieve success in their efforts to fight the extremists\n(including Hitler). Then successfully investigated the activities of far-right\nfigures 2 or 3 times. At this point, the option to expel the artist at the\nMinistry of Internal Affairs will be unlocked.\n\nStep 3: but the option will be locked because the justice department will\njudge Hitler with bias or pardon. Makes you need to control this ministry to\ncarry out at least 1 (major) judicial reform. Aims to eliminate individuals\nwho support the far right and conservatives in the judicial system.\n\nStep 4: The option will now be open but Hitler will use his SA paramilitary\nforces to block the interior ministry's deportation attempt. Forcing you to\nuse the police force and Reichsbanner to arrest Hitler.\n\nStep 5: But SA is a collection of many German veterans and is connected to the\npolice force. So you need to do these things for a successful arrest:\n\n\\+ SA may need to be banned to reduce its legitimacy and links to the police\nforce\n\n\\+ The Reichsbanner must be militarized. Especially absolutely do not cut\nspending on the Reichsbanner\n\n\\+ Must increase the loyalty of the police force at least once. They will now\nreliably join the Reichsbanner. There is also value in purging the police.\n\nStep 7: If you complete all the steps, you will be successfully arrested and a\ntrial will be held and Hitler will be deported to Austria.\n\nNote:\n\n\\- Banning SA will cause the loyalty of the police force to decline. Makes you\nneed to purge the police force or increase loyalty again\n\n\\- Reichsbanner if at \"very low\". Police officers have their loyalty increased\ntwice. Mandatory ban on SA\n\n\\- Reichsbanner if in \"Low\". Police officer's loyalty has been increased once.\nMandatory Ban SA.\n\n\\- Reichsbanner if in \"medium\". The Reichsbanner will crush SA. There is no\nneed to ban SA\n\n\\- It's unclear what impact Stahlhelm's ban will have on deportation efforts.\nBut don't let Hindenburg become Chancellor\n\nReply\n\nFinardin1 hour ago\n\nThank you! I think you have to ban the SA before the option shows up, I\ncouldn't until I had.\n\nReply\n\ngamercool22a23 hours ago (1 edit)\n\nHow do you modify the taxation rate on IOS with the code?\n\nReply\n\nJb1937481 day ago\n\nGood history stuff to read on Weimar?\n\nReply\n\nm30724427881 day ago\n\ndendryUI.dendryEngine.state.qualities.kpd_relation = 100\u8fd9\u4e32\u4ee3\u7801\u8f93\u5165\u65e0\u6548\n\nReply\n\nJb1937481 day ago\n\nYeah didn't work for me either!\n\nReply\n\nFace-Can2 days ago\n\nHow do I get the stuff on Schacht so Hilferding doesn't have to resign?

From what I've played, it's been absolutely mind-blowing\nexperience. Just the idea of a political simulator that manages to (more-or-\nless) accurately the political situation in 1930s Germany (unlike, cough-\ncough, Evil Democracy 1932, cough-cough) is absolutely amazing!\n\nMy only problem is with factions within SPD, that don't seem quite accurate at\ntimes? Like the \"Reformists\" (if I recall, those are the ones who follow\nEduard Bernstein) proposing a People's Party concept, despite G\u00f6rlitzer\nProgram (which Bernstein largerly co-authored) recognising class warfare\n(\"Klassenkampf f\u00fcr die Befreiung des Proletariats\", in Program's wording).\n\nI wouldn't mind a People's Party wing of the SPD, but it has, by that point,\nlargerly distanced itself from Bernstein who was viewed (on pair with Kautsky)\nas Party's \"Old Man\". So maybe omit mentions of Bernstein from Reformists-\nrelated actions (if I recall, he's mentioned somewhere in \"On Party's\nIdeology\")? I dunno, but, a little historical error doesn't invalidate all the\nwork you've done in any way!\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen11 hours ago\n\nThanks for the suggestion! I\u2019ll have to check on my sources again. Also that\nchoice is sort of conflating the traditional \u201creformist\u201d faction (like Otto\nBraun et al) with the neorevisionists, who were more of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Party\u201d\nwing iirc...\n\nReply\n\nStrange stuff2 days ago(+2)\n\nholy s*i* its the premise of my dissertation!\n\nawesome game, there's a real like of diplomacy style games these days, most of\nthem end up being war simulators without any real politics, this is great cant\nwait to see what comes next!\n\nReply\n\nSheevValkory2 days ago (1 edit) (+2)\n\nAgreed. So many of these \"Diplomatic\" games just end up being map painter 2.0.\n\nWe really need more games like this and Suzerain when it comes to political\ngames.\n\nAlso this game is nice since I am an IRL Member of the SPD \u2570(\u2594\u2200\u2594)\u256f\n\nReply\n\nTempestswordsman3 days ago\n\nI've played well over a dozen games so far and I am still not sure if there is\nanything we can do for the economy beyond the WTB plan. I wonder if there is\nany possible way to get the Young Plan to pass too, for example.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih2 days ago(+1)\n\nThe Young Plan did pass. And does pass in this game too. You're confusing it\nwith the referendum which was held to denounce the Young Plan. Which got 14.9%\nof the voters partaking in it.\n\nIn the game, if you have the foreign ministry, you can suspend the\nreparations. It is guaranteed if you notify the foreign powers that the right\nwing parties are attempting to remilitarize the German military. The right\nwing parties hate you for it though.\n\nReply\n\nComradeOtaku3 days ago(+1)\n\nminister-president-chancellor-president otto braun presiding over economic\nrecovery thanks to the WTB plan. now all i really want is to find out how to\npush the KPD to be willing to join a united left coalition government.\n\nReply\n\nTempestswordsman3 days ago(+1)\n\nYou have to reshuffle advisors and get Paul Levi.

If you do that twice, KPD will be open to\nbecoming allied with you. THEN, you actually need them to like you. But before\nthat they won't even improve relations if you try.\n\nReply\n\nVittorio Emanuele III3 days ago\n\nI arrived in January 1933 by preventing Hitler from becoming chancellor.\n\nI brought down the government the first time and managed to reform the Grand\nCoalition (the next elections would be held in '34) and since the Nazis only\nhad 15% of the Reichstag they were not considered the majority party and\nHindemburg was not made Hitler chancellor.\n\nReply\n\nSGTDaveVader3 days ago\n\nThe game is really good! Only time I managed to \"win\" so far is when I didn't\neven get into government during the first elections and managed to get the\npresidency allowing to have a minority government in the end.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nA bug:\n\nSometimes the Reichsbanner's militarization is: 0.19999999...8%\n\nReply\n\nKingPoisonDS3 days ago\n\nA bug:\n\nSPD only has 28% in an early election in 1929, and the game only has a grand\ncoalition as available, but the DVP and BVP don't want to coalition. Since it\nis the only coalition available, the game is not able to progress.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen3 days ago\n\nThis should be fixed in the latest version.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nA bug:\n\nOn hard, the right-parties formed a coalition, the game thinks that parliament\nis suspended and Bruning is using Hindenberg to pass edicts.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen3 days ago\n\nThe DNVP shouldn\u2019t be able to form a coalition with Z at this point; this\nshould be fixed in the latest version.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nWhat is the historical reason for that? DNVP and Zenstrum not being in\ncoalition.\n\nAnd what is YOUR favourite way to play Mr. Dev. Any tips/tricks for us?\n\nReply\n\nComradeOtaku3 days ago\n\nDNVP were hardline protestants, Zentrum was as a catholic interests party\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nA bug:\n\nAufhauser, the labour advisor, his name appears as Leipart.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen3 days ago\n\nThis should be fixed in the latest version.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nI dislike the fact that\n\nA) You cannot form a militarized paramilitary force. The Reichsbanner is an\nactivist organization, not a military one. And cannot turn into a military\none. It's training and equipment is always \"low\".\n\nB) You really cannot change the SPD. As in, it is always a parliamentarian\nliberal party, well let's call them socialists via contemporary lingo. Why\ncan't I make them \"communist\"? Or anarchist? Or even proper liberal, a\n\"bourgeoisie\" party that gets the support of the \"middle-class\", the rich, the\nmilitary, etc.\n\nI wish appointing Labour, or Left into advisory roles, \"strengthening\" them,\nactually did something. Internal factions \"strength\" really does nothing.\nNeorevivalists or whatever the neo-'s are called, do nothing. Or at least\nnothing so far. The left is composed of a guy that wants to cozy up to the KPD\nand a woman that does nothing. The KPD are braindead yes-man of Stalin in the\nUSSR.\n\nThe SPD is incapable of engaging in populism. This is my biggest gripe.\n\nGame is too realistic! Allow me to chart my own course please.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen3 days ago\n\nI would prefer to keep the game at least somewhat within the realm of\nhistorical plausibility, so the SPD is not going to change so drastically. But\nyes, there could be more distinctiveness for the different factions and\nadvisors, and that might be explored in the future.\n\nThe Reichsbanner can definitely become more militarized than \u201clow\u201d.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nHow can I make the Reichsbanner gain maximum militarization?\n\nReply\n\nJb1937482 days ago\n\nId like to know how to make the RB more militarized, I have failed many times!\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nThere was an election that happened in my game in 1932, NSDAP 47%, DNVP 4%.\n*I* was asked, \"NSDAP-DNVP coalition? Or, No Majority Government\". In this\nsituation the question is left up to the NSDAP and also to DNVP. I have no say\nin this. I feel they should have formed a coalition and formed government. I\nbelieve this is a bug.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen3 days ago\n\nThis is a mistake and has been fixed now.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nHey man, great game. I wish I could play past 1933 Jan, or even just past\nwinning the civil war, though. There is a huge randomness element to the game\nbecause you don't know which card you'll get. It is a really interesting\nstrategy game set in a very interesting time period. I love it! Bug with the\nunemployment. Shows ex: 12.00000000009% sometimes. Thought it should say 12%\ninstead. Cannot get populace's support up past 38%, majority non-coalition\ngovernment seems impossible. Is there entropy for support? As in, it\nconstantly wanes by itself? Game is easy once you know what to do. Love that\nfact, of just tinkering with it until you perfect it. I hope this becomes a\ndemo for a FULL game that will come out on Steam. I don't know how one\ndevelops games, but man I wish I could do something this great.\n\nReply\n\njohnny-zankov3 days ago\n\nAnyone have advice on how to not get kicked out of the gov?

Easiest way is\ninter-party affairs, via party cards deck. You need 1 party funding. Or use an\nadvisor, I like Braun, who can increase coalition-partners relations.\n\nReply\n\nsituationistes4 days ago\n\nreally cool game! would you consider adding a cheat mode so people could\nexplore the different outcomes?\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen3 days ago\n\nThere\u2019s already easy mode, but if you want to cheat, you can use the browser\nconsole to set variables. For example, you could set\ndendryUI.dendryEngine.state.qualities.kpd_relation = 100\n\nReply\n\nsltrmn4 days ago(+1)\n\nAn interesting bug I discovered is that you can \"win too much\" and the game\nstarts getting confused, particularly if you get Braun elected as President.\nBecause M\u00fcller was dead at this point, my only option for Chancellor was Braun\n(even though he's already busy being president) and banning the Stahlhelm\nstill weakened my relationship with \"President\" Hindenburg. (To be clear,\ngreat game! Have spent way too much time playing it)\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen4 days ago(+1)\n\nChancellor-President Braun is absolutely an intended (potential) outcome haha,\nalthough there should be more chancellor options in the Weimar coalition. The\nHindenburg thing seems like a bug though; I\u2019ll fix it soon.\n\nReply\n\nsltrmn4 days ago(+2)\n\nI believe you mean Minister-President-Chancellor-President Braun!

I'm trying to juggle things so I can\ndo the public works program, get an SPD chancellor and Thalmann for President,\nand win the civil war. Idk why but im fixated on it lol. Amazing game btw, I'm\nutterly addicted.\n\nReply\n\nJb1937485 days ago(+1)\n\nYeah id love to do that also, I have not managed yet.\n\nReply\n\npanelhazakat5 days ago (2 edits) (+2)\n\nAs long as you have warm relations and accomplish the rest of your goals that\nshould be possible. I've been able to get the KPD to cooperate with me for\nPresident (both me supporting Thalmann and them supporting Braun) but never as\npart of my coalition.\n\nClosest I've gotten was once I asked them to abstain on a vote of no\nconfidence and they demanded to be part of the coalition instead. My remaining\npartners refused to consider it, not sure if it's possible rn. Maybe if the\nunited left coalition is >50% and that event fires?\n\nMaybe you can suck up to both the KDP and the Weimar parties enough to get\nthem all to agree with it but that's a tall order.\n\nReply\n\nJohn Anon4 days ago(+2)\n\nI did get a KPD+SPD Victory but involved going for a Civil War Victory. My\nstrategy there was to focus on party stuff and keep on expanding and\nmilitarizing the Reichsbanner and trying to fix relations with the KPD. I then\ngave Thalmann the chancellorship and fought with the KPD, with the rather\namusing thing where the Reichsbanner outnumbers and outmilitarizes the other\nparamilitaries and the state's armed forces. That run ended with Thalmann\ntrying to remake Wiemar Germany in the Soviet Image.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nThere is a way to get this united-front. You need very good relations with\nKPD, and KPD & SPD need 50% of the votes in the election. You also need 3\nparty resources for bribery, if you don't have VERY good relations with KPD.\n\nReply\n\nfalaxgames5 days ago(+2)\n\nAwesome game! Great interactive history.

I managed to with WTB, but street fighting didn't work out\nfor me yet.\n\nReply\n\nhigherfriar5 days ago\n\nI have found winning with civil war much easier than through saving the\neconomy, the key is to have broad support across the political realm, through\nall parts of civil society, and a weakened hard right wing.\n\nReply\n\nJb1937485 days ago\n\nI never seem to have a strong enough reichsbanner!\n\nReply\n\ntotalen6 days ago(+2)\n\nFrankly, a great game, very good even. I really don't have anything to\npropose: maybe having the WTB be repeatable and strengthening with each report\n(although, i might have missed something). Rest of the issues are already said\nby you, so i won't repeat them. Again, great game.\n\nReply\n\ntotalen6 days ago\n\nOh, I forgot to ask; Is it possible to get Weimar in 1928?\n\nReply\n\nJb1937485 days ago(+2)\n\nThe WTB is repeatable, I did it twice\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nThe WTB is not repeatable. You do it once to come up with the plan on the\ngovernmental level, then do it again to enforce it. You do it once, it needs\ntwo \"button-presses\" to go through.\n\nReply\n\nHaruhi is Waifu6 days ago\n\nReally love this, been having a blast playing it. Alternate history is one of\nmy most favorite things, so getting to play around in the waning days of\nWeimar Germany has been extremely fun.\n\nThough, is it intentional that if you let the Center take the chancellorship,\nyou don't draw any of your ministry cards as you're categorized as opposition?\nI feel there's not really a point to doing that then besides letting the\nCenter take the brunt of the crisis, since all your ministries become useless.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen4 days ago(+1)\n\nIf you\u2019re part of the grand coalition but letting Br\u00fcning be chancellor, you\nshould still be able to pick ministries and draw cards for those ministries.\nHowever, if you\u2019re doing toleration, you don\u2019t get any ministries.\n\nIf you still don\u2019t get ministry cards and are part of the government, this\nmight be a bug...\n\nReply\n\nHaruhi is Waifu3 days ago (1 edit)\n\nYeah, I pick letting Br\u00fcning/the Center take the chancellorship with the Grand\nCoalition in the first election so I can get more ministries, but then I'm\nunable to ever actually draw those ministries since the side bar says I'm in\nopposition to the government.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen3 days ago\n\nThanks, this should be fixed in the latest version.\n\nReply\n\nStrawbreevee6 days ago(+5)\n\nHoly shit this rocks. Sterling work! I'd like to have more explanation of the\ncharacters: what party/SPD faction they're in, what they do as advisors, maybe\na short blurb about their past. Ideally this'd be like Victoria or CK3\ntooltips, but even a section in the Library or a list with a search would be\ngreat too. More visuals in general would be nice, particularly pie charts for\npopular support and whatnot. I'm not sure how possible these suggestions would\nbe in this engine.\n\nI hope you do go through with your plans for a release on Steam. This is an\nincredible starting point, and the fact you did it in a month is a miracle. I\nthink you'd need to extend the game into 1936 and the next election or the end\nof the civil war. Best of luck!\n\nPS: does contacting the SFIO/Labour do anything? I thought they'd show up in\nthe civil war ending.\n\nReply\n\nSeno9005 days ago(+1)\n\nContacting them I think it makes it easier to negotiate with the\nFrench/British for a reduction reparations.\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago\n\nThe West always allows you to pause reparations if you inform them of the\nright wing parties attempts at re-militarization of the German army.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen4 days ago(+2)\n\nThanks! Visuals would be possible but would take some work; there might be\nchoicescript-style bar graphs. I probably wouldn\u2019t want to extend the game to\n1936, since by that point the game\u2019s story would be totally fictional, and I\nwould prefer to keep the story more grounded in historical events.\n\nThere are some choices in the game that are just objectively not very useful,\nand IMO contacting SFIO/Labour is one of them lol (contacting the American\nsocialists is a 100% waste of resources).\n\nReply\n\nshark052226 days ago (1 edit)\n\nwhat does all the ministers do? also what is the wonderful song?\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen4 days ago\n\nOpening song is Fr\u00fchlingslied by Mendelssohn, from\nhttps://archive.org/details/78_fruhlingslied_columbia-orchester-\nmendelssohn_gbia0003448a\n\nReply\n\nshark052224 days ago\n\nthank you but what does all the ministers do?\n\nReply\n\ntotalen4 days ago\n\nMinisters give you a specific card in the government affairs - Finance gives\nBudget decisions, Economy gives Welfare, Interior does Interior, Foreign give\nForeign Policy, Reichswehr gives Reichswehr decisions (additionally, you can\navoid building the cruiser), Labor gives an awful card, and I never picked\nJustice. I think Finance-Economic-Interior combo is best (although Finance-\nInterior-Foreign may also be good)\n\nAvoid picking Labor at all costs, it just wastes a deck space.\n\nReply\n\ntotalen4 days ago\n\nAlthough, if you are able to get a government without the pesky DVP and have\ngood relations with Zentrum+DDP, I think you can go ahead (still won't\nrecommend)\n\nReply\n\nshark052224 days ago\n\nTY\n\nReply\n\nSultanFatih3 days ago(+1)\n\nLabour doesn't waste a deck space.

Then, via the event \"The Economic Crisis\", choose\nthe Labor faction option. Finally, once you control the Economic and/or\nFinance Ministry, use Woytinsk's Advisor ability to institute it.\n\nAlso I think you can go for a \"street-fighting\" if you focus funding on the\nReichsbanner and choosing to fund the youth organizations; supporting the Left\nfaction may also help but I'm not sure\n\nReply\n\nHaruhi is Waifu6 days ago(+1)\n\nYou don't necessarily need Leipart/Woytinsk to obtain support, you can do it\nvia the Economic Crisis card.

In fact I'd say it's one of the best text-based\ngames on here I've ever played, if not the best. I can't wait to see where\nthis goes!\n\nReply\n\nJohn Anon7 days ago(+3)\n\nReally enjoy this game you have created. A part of me wants to ask if you are\nwilling to give a guide to the thing, another part of me wants to see if I can\naccomplish my goals without guidance.\n\nReply\n\nAutumn Chen7 days ago(+1)\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t even know how to get to all the possible outcomes myself lol,\nso all I can provide are generalities.\n\nReply\n\nJohn Anon7 days ago\n\nWell any guidance is better than no guidance.\n\nAnd I don't know whether to be impressed that you made a game that complicated\nor disappointed that you don't know the ins and outs of your creation.\n\nReply\n\nAstrealix6 days ago\n\nAre all options possible?

(EDIT: DVP not DVNP)\n\nReply\n\nViewing most recent comments 1 to 40 of 42 \u00b7 Next page \u00b7 Last page\n\nitch.io\u00b7View all by Autumn Chen\u00b7Report\u00b7Embed\u00b7\n\nUpdated 1 day ago\n\nGames \u203a Interactive Fiction \u203a Free\n\n", "frontpage": false}
