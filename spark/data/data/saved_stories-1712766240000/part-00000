However,\ndespite its power to help people stay in touch with each other at the click of\na button or the touch of a finger, its limitations and harmful effects may\noutweigh its benefits. Considering, the world of social media can be presented\nin a way that it seems more attractive than the real life, it can have\ndetrimental effect on people with low esteem or disorders like depression and\nanxiety. Besides, one may connect less in real life if they get used to\nsocialising on internet, giving them a false feeling of keeping in touch. Not\nmeeting people in real life can take a toll on mental health and lead to\nloneliness, anxiety, depression and related issues.

Know from mental\nhealth experts)\n\nConsidering, the world of social media can be presented in a way that it seems\nmore attractive than the real life, it can have detrimental effect on people\nwith low esteem or disorders like depression and anxiety (Getty Images)\n\nStaying glued to social media and keeping track of constant flow of\ninformation may also negatively impact brain. In fact, tendency to surf or\nscroll through bad news, even though it is saddening, disheartening, or\ndepressing, is termed as doom scrolling or doom surfing. During Covid times,\nthis became more common when people tracked news related to virus and there\nwere frequent developments.\n\nUnlock exclusive access to the story of India's general elections, only on the\nHT App. Download Now!\n\nAanandita Vaghani, Mental Health Counsellor, Founder, UnFix Your Feelings in\nan interview with HT Digital shed light on ways social media and doomscrolling\ncan impact mental health.\n\n## NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON MENTAL HEALTH\n\n## 1\\. It\u2019s making you less body-positive\n\nThe type of social media consumed by women especially, can really impact their\nperceptions of their bodies. In a \u2018filtered\u2019 age where body \u2018perfection\u2019\nrather than body positivity or neutrality is emphasized, women may have worse\nthoughts about themselves especially if they have low self esteem and a\nhistory of an eating disorder as they compare themselves to individuals that\nmay have edited or idealized not eating.\n\n## 2\\. It\u2019s reducing your real-world connections\n\nWhen individuals have heavy social media use, studies show that this leads\nthem to feel less socially connected. In a study published by the Canadian\nJournal of Behavioral Science, passive engagement with social media that\ninvolved not posting, but only viewing people\u2019s posts was associated with\nlower efforts to seek social connection, reduced well-being, and higher\nstress.\n\n## 3\\. It\u2019s impacting you the same way that drugs do\n\nNeuroscientists that study the effects of social media on the brain find that\npositive interactions (such as someone liking your tweet) trigger the same\nkind of chemical reaction that is caused by gambling and the use of\nrecreational drugs. This is because when you get a social media notification,\nyour brain sends a chemical messenger known as dopamine along a reward\npathway, which makes you feel \u2018happy\u2019.\n\nThe release of dopamine is associated with food, exercise, love, sex,\ngambling, drugs and social media. Scrolling on social media, just like drugs\nand food provides immediate rewards \u2014 in the form of attention from your\nnetwork \u2014 for minimal effort through a quick thumb tap. Therefore, the brain\nrewires itself, making you further desire likes, retweets, and comments.\n\n## 4\\. It is increasing your sensitivity to developing an attentional\nchallenge\n\nIt is a well-researched fact that those with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD) face a need for constant stimulation and have lower self-\ncontrol. The overuse of social media and lack of moving their bodies makes\nsuch individuals reduce their inhibitive tendencies further, which leads to\neven more screen time, building a cycle that is difficult to get out of.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t yet, or don\u2019t have a diagnosis of ADHD, social media can\nstill significantly decrease attention span. This shortened life span has\nbegun to control most of our life - whether it be during a long book or movie,\nwe tend to reach out to our phones involuntarily to momentary boredom.\n\n## 5\\. It increases the risk of depression and loneliness\n\nAs we check \u2018stories\u2019 or posts, we may worry about missing an event, an inside\njoke, or something that makes you feel left out. The human need to belong is\nso strong, that continuously feeling like this can make you develop an\nincreased sense of loneliness or exclusion as we see people having a good\ntime- which might only be one second of their life\u2019s highlight reel.\n\nOscars 2024: From Nominees to Red Carpet Glam!
