I had a copy at\nuniversity and used to read it again and again. I was sane enough to know that\nmy own relationship with my body was mad, and that the things I did to it were\nharmful. Still, there was comfort in seeing that mine was a mundane madness,\none shared by countless other women, some of whom would eventually come out\nthe other side.\n\nI recently rediscovered the book and was struck by how many of the stories of\nbingeing, starvation and self-harm began with the onset of puberty. One\nparticular passage, from Michelle Blair\u2019s \u201cA Key to Happiness\u201d, stood out:\n\nOnce I was asked \u2018At what age is a woman most powerful?\u2019 I imagined it might\nbe sometime after menopause [...] But no: my friend said a girl is strongest\nat eight or nine. It is then that she is invincible: body like a boy\u2019s, tough\nas wood and attitude to follow suit. As the flower blooms, conversely her\nheyday ends and she is left to spend the next decades trying to create, not\neven from rubble, but from scratch, some kind of moving, of thinking, of being\nthat is remotely comfortable, that is hers.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is wholly true; indeed, much of me thinks the first answer\n\u2014 sometime after menopause \u2014 is a better one. Nonetheless, this sense of loss\nduring female adolescence has been noted by feminists time and again. It is\nreal and it is powerful.\n\n\u201cThe little girl,\u201d wrote Simone de Beauvoir in The Second Sex, \u201cfeels that her\nbody is escaping her, that it is no longer the clear expression of her\nindividuality\u201d:\n\n... \u201cit becomes foreign to her; and at the same moment, she is grasped by\nothers as a thing: on the street, eyes follow her, her body is subject to\ncomments; she would like to become invisible; she is afraid of becoming flesh\nand afraid to show her flesh.\u201d\n\nFemale resistance to growth \u2014 \u201c[girls] do not want to eat any more; if they\nare forced, they vomit\u201d \u2014 was linked by Beauvoir to this feeling that the body\nis no longer an expression of the self. It\u2019s hardly a subtle point, but then\nthere is nothing subtle about the enforced social transition from human\nsubject to feminine object. Who can blame some girls for holding puberty\nitself responsible? It can be less painful to think that than to acknowledge\nthe world\u2019s new-found indifference to your interior life.\n\nThis week sees the publication of Hilary Cass\u2019s review into gender identity\nservices for children. The past decade has seen a dramatic rise in the number\nof adolescent females declaring themselves to be boys \u2014 or, one might say,\nrealising that their bodies are \u201cno longer a clear expression of their\nidentities\u201d. Only in this case, we are not supposed to apply a Beauvoirian\nanalysis to the situation. According to Wikipedia, rapid-onset gender\ndysphoria is \u201ca controversial, scientifically unsupported hypothesis\u201d (unlike,\nsay, gender identity). There is apparently no obvious reason why, when\npresented with the opportunity to disidentify from femaleness entirely, many\ndesperately unhappy girls will want to take it. Despite everything we know\nabout misogyny and the trauma of female puberty, the trans activist line is\nthat it is crass and invalidating to even suggest that trans identified\nfemales are simply girls who \u2014 with much justification \u2014 hate everything that\nfemale adolescence, as it is currently constructed, brings to their door.\n\nThe people who support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and,\neventually, \u201cgender affirming\u201d surgeries for young females will tell you they\nare being kind. They are no doubt geared up to deem anything in the Cass\nreport which challenges their position to be \u201chate\u201d. They will have all of\ntheir false equivalences with 1980s homophobia at the ready. They think they\nhave the perfect answer to young, female desperation. You solve it with drugs,\nneedles, knives and slogans. If a girl doesn\u2019t fit the world into which she is\ngrowing, you don\u2019t change the world, or enable her to find a space; you help\nher to cut pieces of herself away.\n\nWhat I see in this position \u2014 and what I think we should be calling out more\nand more \u2014 is a total lack of empathy. There is no true kindness in it.\nThere\u2019s no curiosity, no compassion, no willingness to put oneself on the line\nfor the sake of, what? Just some unhappy uterus owners. Just their sadness and\ntheir lesser female bodies. The assumption seems to be that if some female\npeople are not buying into the whole femininity package, one might as well\nwrite them out of the girlhood story entirely. One has the excuse that they do\nnot wish to be part of it, either. It\u2019s not a good enough one.\n\nSet aside all the \u201cprotect trans kids\u201d slogans, and what do we have?\nTraumatised girls who are told by the world that there\u2019s nothing to be done.\nTheir pain at being female can\u2019t be resolved. Their discomfort never eases,\nand anyone who tells them otherwise simply isn\u2019t taking it seriously. True\npain, they are told, comes from within and it is fixed. Thinking that you\nmight ever overcome it \u2014 that you could one day feel at home in the body that\nyou have and are \u2014 is likened to believing one might grow out of being gay. As\nthough these two things are remotely comparable. As if despising your own\nflesh is as natural as loving the flesh of another.\n\nI think it is obscene to respond to the agony of young girls by saying, yes,\nokay. If this pain is deep and enduring enough, we will wage war on your body\non your behalf. Enough of the cutting and starving. We will drug you. We will\nremove your breasts for you. If all else fails, we might even help you to die.\nThis is absolute capitulation to the idea that if you cannot cope with where\nyour female body positions you \u2014 if you just can\u2019t take it \u2014 that body is to\nblame. It lets everyone and everything else off the hook. It tells you that\nyou are on your own.\n\nRight now, children\u2019s publishing lauds books which essentialise female body\nhatred under the guise of trans inclusion. Criticism is dismissed with glib\nclaims that \u201cyoung people\u201d or \u201cyouths\u201d (never children) \u201cknow themselves\u201d (any\nwoman who ever recalls wanting to take a knife and slice off her emerging\nbreasts or thickening thighs, take note). It is as if adults have forgotten\nwhat growing, development, time, even are. I have teenage sons. I am\nconstantly struck by how intensely they feel, but also how rapidly they are\nchanging. However much they know, they cannot know what it is like to be\nolder. They won\u2019t until they get there. The same is true for all of us. To\nobserve this is no judgement on anyone.\n\nMost of the accounts in Eating Our Hearts Out come from women who did find\nways to grow and live with themselves. The obvious response to that \u2014 from the\nself-styled \u201ckind\u201d people \u2014 will be that they can\u2019t have suffered all that\nmuch. If their pain had an end, then it can\u2019t have been comparable to gender\ndysphoria.\n\nIn truth, I don\u2019t find it hard to imagine many of the US-based contributors,\nhad they been teenagers today, binding their breasts or being offered\nmastectomies or testosterone. Nor do I find it hard to imagine them defending\nthe choice to take them later down the line: \u201cit could never have been any\nother way. It could never have been better for me\u201d. You might have to think\nthat, once the decision has been made. You were always destined to have\nbrittle bones, no sexual function, itchy scars. You have to tell yourself it\ncould never have been any better, otherwise the sense of abandonment would be\nunbearable.\n\nI do think it could be better, though. Lots of us do, not because we\nunderestimate the degree of despair, but because we don\u2019t. It is laughable to\nthink that anything is cured by the lazy rubber-stamping of female pain. \u201cLet\nthe boys have their porn and any girls who can\u2019t hack it know where the door\nout of femaleness is\u201d is not a reasonable way to treat other humans. Neither\nis \u201cif you hate your body so much, we will hate it, too\u201d.\n\nGirls \u2014 future women, whatever you call them or do to them \u2014 are worth more\nthan this. If you can\u2019t be bothered to consider this, at least stop claiming\nto be kind.\n\nShare\n\n## Enjoying The Critic online?
