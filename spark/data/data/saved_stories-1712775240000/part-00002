With Chrome Enterprise Premium, the latest\nevolution of the world\u2019s most trusted enterprise browser, hundreds of millions\nof enterprise users can be further protected.\n\n### The new endpoint\n\nBrowsers are more than just a portal to the Internet: They are the new\nendpoint where almost every high-value activity and interaction in the\nenterprise takes place. Authentication, access, communication and\ncollaboration, administration, and even coding are all browser-based\nactivities in the modern enterprise.\n\nEndpoint security is growing more challenging due to remote work, reliance on\nan extended workforce, and the proliferation of new devices that aren\u2019t part\nof an organization\u2019s managed fleet. As these trends continue to accelerate and\nconverge, it\u2019s clear that the browser is a natural enforcement point for\nendpoint security in the modern enterprise. GartnerR research predicts\n\u201centerprise browsers will be the core platform for delivering workforce\nproductivity and security software on managed and unmanaged devices for a\nseamless hybrid work experience.\u201d^1\n\n### Get advanced security with Chrome Enterprise Premium\n\nUsers around the world already use Chrome on their digital devices to access\ninformation and get work done safely across Windows, macOS, chromeOS, Android,\nand iOS. As a leader in browser security, Chrome has built features and best\npractices that have disrupted, and then established, industry norms.\n\nFor example, we introduced advanced security sandboxing and novel exploit\nmitigations, and we lead the industry in our response time to zero-day\nvulnerabilities. We also continue to advance security, and recently announced\nwork that uses AI to do privacy-preserving, real-time checks of websites to\nhelp protect users from increasingly sophisticated attacks.\n\nChrome Enterprise Premium builds on the core capabilities available in Chrome\nEnterprise, which gives organizations the secure, reliable browser their\nemployees prefer to use with management tools for IT and security teams built\nin.\n\nChrome Enterprise Premium offers additional advanced security capabilities,\nincluding:\n\n  * Enterprise controls enforce policies, manage software updates and extensions to align with enterprise policies, and support RDP, SCP, SSH and other TCP protocols;\n\n  * Security insights and reporting support event reporting, device reporting, and forensic capabilities for enterprise-wide visibility, and can integrate with other Google and third-party security solutions;\n\n  * Context-aware access controls can be scaled for web applications, can help enforce continuous Zero Trust access to SaaS and web-based apps with context-aware access control, and can mitigate data exfiltration risks for sanctioned and unsanctioned applications; and\n\n  * Threat and data protection delivers content inspection and data loss prevention, anti-malware, and anti-phishing using frontline intelligence and AI, dynamic URL filtering, and site categorization.\n\nOrganizations using Chrome Enterprise Premium benefit from Google\u2019s world-\nclass threat intelligence, security features, and Zero Trust access via\nGoogle\u2019s secure global network.\n\n\"With Chrome Enterprise Premium, we have confidence in Google\u2019s security\nexpertise, including Project Zero\u2019s cutting-edge security research and fast\nsecurity patches. We set up data loss prevention restrictions and warnings for\nsharing sensitive information in applications like Generative AI platforms and\nnoticed a noteworthy 50% reduction in content transfers,\u201d said Nick Reva, head\nof corporate security engineering, Snap Inc.\n\n\u201cWe chose Chrome and Google as Roche's secure enterprise browsing solution\nbecause it provides us with deep visibility and protections to keep our users\nand corporate data safe. Once the solution was turned on, we were able to\nidentify and stop an attempt to exfiltrate a large amount of corporate\ninformation within hours,\u201c said Tim Ehrhart, domain head, information\nsecurity, Roche.\n\n### Keep tabs on Chrome Enterprise Premium\n\nYou can learn more about Chrome Enterprise Premium here.
