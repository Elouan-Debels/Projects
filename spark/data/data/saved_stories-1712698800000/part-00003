Beeper is a universal chat\napp for Android, iOS and desktop. Our goal is to build the best chat app on\nearth.\n\nIt has a few killer features:\n\n  * One chat app to rule them all. Send and receive messages on 14 different chat networks.\n  * Stay on top of your chats with a universal inbox. One place to check and chat with all your friends.\n  * Search instantly across your entire digital history. Find a friend\u2019s address they sent you, or their spouse\u2019s name, in a snap.\n  * Plus, simple obvious features that chat apps should have had years ago, like auto-copying 2FA codes, scheduling messages, archiving, folders and a fantastic desktop experience.\n\nBeeper is built on an open source chat protocol called Matrix. Over time,\nwe\u2019ll help people migrate from proprietary, siloed chat networks to an open\nstandard for chat. If you\u2019re interested in learning about this, we\u2019ve written\nmore about our intentions.\n\nFYI: Beeper does not currently support iMessage, but there\u2019s good reason to be\ncautiously optimistic about the future. In March, the US government took up\nour fight and sued Apple for blocking Beeper Mini\u2019s access to iMessage. The\nFCC is also investigating.\n\nApple has also announced that iPhones will support RCS chat protocol in 2024.\nGood news \u2013 Beeper already supports RCS! This should fix most iPhone \u2194 Android\nchat problems, like low resolution images/videos, lack of typing indicators\nand encryption.\n\n## No more waitlist. Download now!\n\nSince we announced Beeper in 2021, over 115,000 people have helped beta test\nour app. We\u2019ve learned a lot and made a ton of tweaks. We\u2019re finally ready to\ninvite the 466,000 extraordinarily patient folks on our waitlist, and the\nentire world!\n\nBeeper is now available for everyone to download. We have apps on Android,\niPhone/iPad, ChromeOS, macOS, Windows and Linux. Head over to\nbeeper.com/download to grab it.\n\nIt\u2019s free to use, and includes access to all chat networks. At a later point,\nwe will also offer an optional paid subscription, which includes additional\nfeatures like being able to add multiple accounts per network and more.\n\n## Beeper is joining Automattic\n\nNext big piece of news \u2013 we\u2019ve been acquired by Automattic! It\u2019s a really big\ndeal. I\u2019ve known Matt, their CEO, for years. We\u2019re extremely excited to have\nthe support of an organization known for fantastic open source projects like\nWordPress, WooCommerce, Pocket Casts and Simplenote. Beeper as you know and\nlove it will continue to thrive. Our whole team is moving over to Automatic,\nand we\u2019ll continue operating as an independent team. Read more in the\nannouncement blog post.\n\n## Our new Android app is now out of beta\n\nYou may have caught our announcement from a few weeks ago \u2013 we\u2019ve built a new\nAndroid app from scratch to be fast, clean and beautiful. Thank you to our\n10,000 eager Android friends who have been beta testing the app! Today we\u2019re\nreleasing the app to everyone.\n\nThe new app features:\n\n  * Beautiful new design\n  * Instant chat opens. Instant message sends.\n  * Set up and modify chat networks in the app, no desktop required\n  * All chats are cached locally on-device\n  * Full message search\n  * Fully end-to-end encryption local Signal bridge (local WhatsApp and all e2ee network bridges coming soon)\n\nDownload now on the Google Play store. The old app won\u2019t auto-update, you must\ndownload the new one manually.\n\nRead about the rewrite and our new local end-to-end encrypted architecture on\nour tech blog.\n\n### Next up\n\nNow, we\u2019re merging with the Texts.com team (who were acquired by Automattic\nlast year) to work together on our shared mission to build the best chat app\non earth! We\u2019ve got a lot of new features and improvements in the works.\nBeeper iOS and Desktop app are being overhauled, and updated with the new\ndesign language from Beeper Android.
