Whenever I discover hidden tricks of\nLego, I make videos and share them with you. Legos are perfect for building\nwild imaginations, creating unnecessary inventions, or just relaxing and\nhaving fun. Lego had been a part of my life since I was just a toddler, and\nthe later experience of joining First Lego League events helped me digging\ndeeper into the fields of STEM. Magic happens when arts intertwine with\nmechanics, and it's truly hard to resist! You can find my new videos once a\nweek, and some shorts occasionally. I also make instruction videos for some\nMOC builds if people want tutorials.
