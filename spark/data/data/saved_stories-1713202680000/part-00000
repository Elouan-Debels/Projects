In the technology-driven world, where SaaS platforms solve\ncomplex business problems, we've innovated a new kind of service aimed\nsquarely at solving a critical internet problem, the lack of IPv6 adoption.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nJust like how SaaS solutions give you the tools you need right when you need\nthem, our version of SaaS delivers a potent dose of public \"shame\" to domains\nstill lagging in IPv6 support. Through user-submitted campaigns and data-\ndriven reports, we spotlight these slackers, providing that gentle nudge (or\npush!) to get them on the IPv6 train.\n\n### Why SaaS?\n\nBecause sometimes a bit of good-natured shaming is the most efficient way to\nspark change. Our SaaS is committed to making IPv6 adoption a reality, one\nred-faced domain at a time.\n\nPublic Accountability\n\nWith our public reports, it's harder for these domains to ignore their\nresponsibilities.\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nEngage in meaningful dialogue about the significance of IPv6, share your\ndiscoveries, and even initiate your own campaigns.\n\nUser-Led Shaming\n\nAnyone can submit a domain for shaming, and our service will take it from\nthere.\n\n### Top IPv6 Sinners\n\nThe following domains are the top offenders of the IPv6 protocol. These\ndomains are the most visited websites in the world, yet they have not embraced\nthe future, IPv6.\n\nShame on them!\n\n> \"It's a shame some people still can't deploy a protocol that could buy its\n> own beer, even in the US.\"\n\nIvan Pepelnjak - ipspace.net\n\n# Wall of Shame\n\nAs a part of this shaming-strategy, we supply all interested parties with an\nupdated list over the top 1 million websites and their corresponding (lack of)\nIPv6 support clearly stated.\n\nEach of the listed websites lack an AAAA-record. In addition the nameserver-\nsupport for IPv6 is displayed.\n\nNo domains found\n\nHosted on Native IPv6 co-location from Blix Solutions since 2008\n\n", "frontpage": true}
