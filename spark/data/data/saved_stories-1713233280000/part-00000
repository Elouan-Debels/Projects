For part of the 87-minute video, a woman lies taped up on the\nfloor, writhing, while a voice off camera hisses threats at her. The woman on\nthe floor is named V\u011bra. The one off camera is named Yarrow Hall. The video is\ndisturbing for multiple reasons. It captures suffering and vulnerability. It\npresents brutality as art. And both of the women are actually characters\ninhabited by X. The abduction is staged, performed, fabricated, whatever word\nyou prefer. But its first viewers didn\u2019t know what they were looking at, or\nwhether it was real or invented. And once they realized it was the latter,\nthey were confused by what felt like deception\u2014a reaction that seems to have\nbeen the point.\n\nI\u2019ve never actually seen An Account of My Abduction. No one has, or will. But\nyou can \u201cview\u201d it yourself in Catherine Lacey\u2019s genre-quaking new novel,\nBiography of X, which invents X, and her assumed identities, and her big,\nbrash, occasionally stunty body of work. X is a creation in the vein of David\nBowie and Kathy Acker and Cindy Sherman and Andrea Fraser\u2014a shape-shifter who\nencourages her fictional selves to metastasize until they kick her out of her\nown life, an iconoclast with many noms de plume but no answers about her own\nchildhood or upbringing. \u201cIt only seems to be a simple question\u2014Where are you\nfrom? It can never be sufficiently answered,\u201d she enigmatically tells a\nmagazine interviewer, posing the question that animates every inch of\nBiography of X.\n\nThis is Lacey\u2019s fourth novel, and she has shown a keen streak of inventiveness\nand ambition that\u2019s been rewarded with much recognition: She\u2019s won the New\nYork Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award, a Guggenheim, and a Whiting.\nBut Biography of X revels in the kind of identity theft that artists (and\nwriters) employ to build the stories of their work and themselves. Lacey\nfashioned the enigma that is X\u2014a woman known for her \u201cuncommon brutality\u201d and\nvenomous disdain\u2014out of dozens of artists and provocateurs and hucksters who\ninhabit our world, but she also made her something inimitable, a vehicle for\nexploring Lacey\u2019s favorite theme: the fungibility of identity. \u201cI think\nbecause I\u2019m an artist,\u201d X says, \u201cmy image will always come before me.\u201d In\ncreating this character made up of characters, Lacey has posed an unanswerable\nquestion about whether an artist can bury herself so far under work that it\nbecomes impossible to find the traces of an authentic self.\n\nBiography Of X - A Novel\n\nBy Catherine Lacey\n\nSitting at a downtown-Manhattan restaurant on a warm, gusty winter afternoon,\nLacey came across as more contemplative and unencumbered than enfant\nterrible\u2014she was wearing a fluffy, forest-green coat and looked at me through\nwide blue eyes; large paper-clip tattoos on each wrist appeared to secure her\nhands to her body. She looked slightly perplexed when I came at her with\nsharp-angled questions, like I was trying to pry open a shell for a pearl\nalready strung on a necklace.\n\nX hides herself so well that her own wife doesn\u2019t even know her birthplace.\nBut the Catherine Lacey who wrote Biography of X and produced its brilliant,\nvicious, capricious protagonist\u2014an unstable new element in the periodic table\nof literature\u2014doesn\u2019t believe in a unified theory of the self, so she was\nhappy to hand me remnants of her own life and let me create some Cubist\nversion of her. Under a photo of us that she posted to Instagram right after\nwe met, she wrote that she still has \u201cno idea how to properly organize past\nselves,\u201d an idea she explained to me that day: You contain multiple people,\nfrom different periods of your life, and you lose some of them along the way.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that feels really troubled by [that] separation of\nidentities,\u201d she noted. \u201cI don\u2019t know; isn\u2019t it troubling?\u201d It seems to me\nthat it is: The lifelong project of making a self is, by nature, hopeless.\nTurning Lacey into one firmly outlined person seems against the spirit of her\nproject.\n\nA few facts anyway: Lacey is 37. She was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, but\nhasn\u2019t lived in the state since she left for boarding school at age 14. She\npinballs around: Right now she\u2019s living in the Ditmas Park neighborhood of\nBrooklyn, swapping houses with a friend for the place she shares in Mexico\nCity. \u201cI don\u2019t have a region,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m not of any one place.\u201d She\u2019s\nbeen married (to a performance artist) and partnered and un-partnered and re-\npartnered again. In the past nine years, she\u2019s emerged as the rare young\nwriter who has successfully produced a true oeuvre: Her novels vary\nthematically\u2014they include a hypnotic road-trip tale (Nobody Is Ever Missing,\n2014), a speculative pseudo-satire of dating and mating (The Answers, 2017),\nand a Shirley Jackson\u2013esque race-and-gender fable (Pew, 2020)\u2014but they all\nshare Lacey\u2019s particular ability to build sturdy narratives that point to the\nflimsiness of narrative itself.\n\nLacey is an open book but a profiler\u2019s riddle, even though that\u2019s the kind of\nwriting she once hoped to produce: \u201cI wanted to be doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d\nshe said, with a look of wonder\u2014she wanted to write nonfiction and coerce\nartists into sharing their lives. Biography of X, a true magnum opus, plants\nreal lives\u2014like Bowie\u2019s and Acker\u2019s, along with figures as varied as Connie\nConverse, Frank O\u2019Hara, Richard Serra, and Susan Sontag\u2014alongside the\nfictional, Spirographing the two together. It\u2019s almost a form of profile\nwriting, but she\u2019s suitably busted up the whole thing to retrofit those \u201creal\u201d\nlives to her protagonist\u2019s purposes.\n\nRead: Understanding your past won\u2019t liberate you\n\nBiography of X serves as the title of two books, actually: Lacey\u2019s novel and\nthe biography \u201cinside\u201d that novel (\u201cpublished\u201d by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in\n2005), written by CM Lucca, a lapsed journalist. She is also X\u2019s widow\u2014the\nstory is told in retrospect by a grieving spouse using biography to make sense\nof the unknowable person she loved. CM (alternately Charlotte Marie or Cynthia\nMalone, depending) obsessively roots through paperwork and gallery slides,\ninterviews old friends and enemies, tries to fill in the broad gaps in the\npersonal history of a woman who appeared seemingly out of nowhere in New York\nin 1972 and ended up with a retrospective at MoMA two decades later. X was the\nkind of artist who provoked conversation whenever she exhibited new work\u2014less\na lightning rod than the lightning itself. She had several personas: Clyde\nHill, a cult novelist with New Directions; Martina Riggio, a feminist small-\npress founder; the aforementioned Yarrow Hall and V\u011bra, who each put out work\nof their own.\n\nLacey\u2019s power as a mimic is on full display here: Her creations are all as\nbelievable as X is, even when we know they are Cindy Sherman\u2013like roles,\npulled on as a kind of winking game. Longing rises up from every crack. X, CM\nexplains, \u201clived in a play without intermission in which she cast herself in\nevery role.\u201d But who was she? CM can gather all sorts of information on her\nwife\u2014through Vanity Fair profiles, towers of notebooks in her study, critics\u2019\ntakedowns. But she yearns to identify the precipitating event that turned her\ninto X: a name that signifies no name, a woman who claimed, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\nam a private person; I am not a person at all.\u201d CM wants to know where X came\nfrom in order to make sense of her.\n\nLacey is happy to disclose bits from her own past. As we scanned our menus,\nshe told me that she\u2019s been a vegetarian ever since she read Leviticus during\nher church-intensive childhood and decided that no matter what her mother\nsaid, she\u2019d likely spend eternity in the furnaces of hell if she mixed milk\nand meat. Her attachment to her Christianity was fierce and then suddenly\ngone: \u201cI had a total certitude about why the world was put together, the way\nthat it was put together, what happens after you die. It made all these\nanswers completely clear.\u201d She left her faith and Mississippi around the same\ntime, and wound up with a hole that those identities used to occupy.\n\nHer answerless fiction is a new way of working through those big questions;\nit\u2019s also gorgeously anti-solution\u2014those \u201cviewers\u201d who witness An Account of\nMy Abduction have been conned by the art world into believing that revelation\nis the end point of any narrative. \u201cI\u2019m constructing this whole fictional\nthing because it feels like the only way to clearly convey something that I\u2019m\nfeeling,\u201d Lacey noted with a head shake and some laughing exasperation, \u201cwhich\nis ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAs if its main conceit isn\u2019t distorting enough, Biography of X also steps\nthrough a side door to present a bizarro alternate version of American\nhistory. Just months after X\u2019s birth, in 1945, the novel\u2019s America split into\nthree big chunks: the libertarian Western Territory, the socialist Northern\nTerritory, and the theocratic Southern Territory, which covertly built a wall\nand locked itself in. The latter didn\u2019t reunite with the rest of the country\nuntil weeks after X\u2019s death, in 1996\u2014\u201cas if her very existence were tethered\nto that dangerous, doomed boundary.\u201d This lets Lacey imagine a South that\ncould physically trap X as a child, and hint that X might be so powerful as to\nbend the world, once out of her control, to her whim.\n\nLacey\u2019s characters usually don\u2019t escape the South intact. (\u201cI felt wrong\nthere,\u201d Lacey offered\u2014an idea she repeated to me over and over.) In The\nAnswers, a girl is entirely isolated on a farm in Tennessee with her radical-\nChristian father and simpering mother, fed Bible verses and kept blind to pop\nculture, that American golden calf. She wanders adulthood in search of\nexperiences that might make her a full person. Pew revolves around someone\nwith no discernible age, gender, or race, no background or history\u2014found in a\nchurch in a small, unnamed southern town, where citizens fight to decide\nwhether the vulnerable stranger should be sheltered, as Jesus commands, or\nrejected. Pew ends up \u201calone\u201d and \u201cgone\u201d and entirely unaccounted for. In\nLacey\u2019s South, the region\u2019s external pressure to conform produces irreparably\ncracked identities.\n\nRead: She never meant to write a memoir\n\nEarly on, CM learns that X was one of a very small number of people who\nescaped the Southern Territory, where, as along the Berlin Wall, armed guards\nshot down anyone caught crossing. X\u2019s birth identity, it turns out, was Carrie\nLu Walker of Byhalia, Mississippi (75 miles from Lacey\u2019s Tupelo); her\nchildhood of purged libraries, global isolation, church-house education, and\nfemale submission radicalized her into rebellion and then escape. X\u2019s\nmanifestos embrace the notion that \u201cart is an expression of the society from\nwhich it emerges.\u201d And the revelations about X\u2019s childhood give CM the feeling\nthat she is making progress toward understanding her wife\u2019s work, now \u201cmore\nfolded with meaning and complication.\u201d For X, a refugee from religious\ntyranny, the act of self-creation was about addition, not subtraction.\n\nThis alternate America is a distorted version of our own, ratcheted up just\nenough that it reads like a dream state. The result is pleasantly\ndisorienting; it gives the feeling that history is operated by a series of\nlevers, and that fiction can yank on some of them to spit out varied, unruly\nresults. If art kick-starts a \u201ctotal, ongoing delusion,\u201d as X writes, then\nLacey understands that setting her work inside a prototype of a slightly\ndifferent world\u2014with the socialist Emma Goldman as an architect of the\nAmerican economy, with Wassily Kandinsky and Jackson Pollock and Alexander\nCalder killed off so that \u201cwomen were seen as the sex to whom \u2018art\u2019 belonged,\u201d\nwith reparations paid for the descendants of the enslaved\u2014keeps the ground\njust unsteady enough that certainty floats away.\n\nJanet Malcolm has called biography \u201cthe arrogant desire to impose a narrative\non the stray bits and pieces of a life.\u201d Biography of X came from an\nexperiment designed to amplify that notion by turning it on its head: Use a\nnovel to create a fake biography, then splice in enough of those \u201cbits and\npieces of a life\u201d to make it seem real even as Lacey never loses sight of the\nartifice of it all.\n\nReaders might feel the impulse to parse CM\u2019s reporting for some base truth,\nbut they\u2019d be missing the point. Practically speaking\u2014and Lacey is a devotee\nof practicality, meticulously explaining to me how each decision in the novel\nresulted from a set of what she called \u201centicing boundaries\u201d she\u2019d set for\nherself\u2014the book is a highly stylized crossbreed of genres. A set of footnotes\ncites imaginary magazine articles, interviews, and profiles about X by real-\nlife writers such as Joshua Rivkin, Naomi Fry, Hermione Hoby, and Renata\nAdler. Some of them swirl our reality with the book\u2019s\u2014Chris Kraus\u2019s After\nKathy Acker, her biography of the punk writer, is cited, but with a\npublication date 15 years early; there\u2019s a magazine (perhaps a cousin of this\none) called The Atlantic Coast; the artist Alex Prager films a documentary\nabout a seditious librarian in the Southern Territory. The second set of\nannotations are Lacey\u2019s 13 pages of endnotes. They cite the parts of our world\nthat she\u2019s collaged into hers: a Tom Waits speech that X recites verbatim; a\ncharacter\u2019s murder that\u2019s modeled on the assassination of Kim Jong Un\u2019s\nbrother; a quote from Lacey\u2019s own first novel, Nobody Is Ever Missing, that\nshe attributes to another one of X\u2019s personas, called Angel Thornbird.\n\nThe writer David Shields, whose book Reality Hunger employed written collage\nto illustrate the power of creative borrowing, counseled Lacey to leave those\nannotations out and let the audience wonder. \u201cBut I\u2019m not really trying to get\naway with something,\u201d she said, while we ordered tea after lunch. It\u2019s vital\nto her that readers see the wires she crossed and the easy co-opting of one\nreality for another. What better material to screw with than what people\nalready believe to be indubitable? For Lacey, fiction\u2014and biography\u2014aren\u2019t\nprecious little feats to be preserved in formaldehyde. \u201cThe more you buy into\nthe idea that you are somehow the entity that\u2019s really responsible for your\nwork, the unhappier you are,\u201d she said. She wishes her own name weren\u2019t on her\nnovels, and claims she isn\u2019t the authority on them. The self can\u2019t be siphoned\noff from the work, but it needn\u2019t be the work. \u201cX believed that making fiction\nwas sacred,\u201d CM writes, \u201cand she wanted to live in that sanctity, not to be\nfooled by the flimsiness of perceived reality, which was nothing more than a\nstory that had fooled most of the world.\u201d Biography of X moves past\nautofiction: The reality of a personal history is no more reliable than the\nuncertainty of fiction.\n\nRead: Six books that will change how you look at art\n\nBy sheer luck, the artist Alex Prager, known for her staged, cinematic photos,\nand now grafted into Lacey\u2019s book, had a new multimedia show that had just\nopened, and Lacey and I took the C train up to Chelsea to catch it. Part Two:\nRun! was set in one of Prager\u2019s signature simulacrums: a movie set so luminous\nand sharp-cornered that it was obviously constructed for the camera. In a\nshort film, four aggressively wigged and costumed actors\u2014to me, all Xs in\ntheir invented selves\u2014pushed a giant pinball down the set\u2019s street; it mowed\ndown everyone in its path, but they were miraculously resurrected, standing\nback up, brushing themselves off. There was a pinball machine too, so\nobservers could implicate themselves: Neither of us was any good. And in the\ncorner, there was a sculptural installation in which a life-size \u201cbody,\u201d in a\ndemure gingham dress and sensible heels, lay crushed under the movie\u2019s mammoth\nmirrored ball. Where the head ought to have been was the ball, and the\nreflection created a continuation of the body, another body, another self.\n\nWhile we watched the film, Lacey wondered out loud how the camera wasn\u2019t\ncaptured in the ball\u2019s reflection\u2014an artist concerned with the technicality of\ncraft. Standing in front of the orb, we could easily see ourselves, made small\nbut still present, us and another version of us. For a moment, I could imagine\nthat Lacey\u2019s reflection would simply walk away without her.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
