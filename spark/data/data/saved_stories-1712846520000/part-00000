Courtesy of NIST\n\nThe National Vulnerability Database is so overwhelmed with a steadily\nincreasing number of software and hardware flaws that the National Institute\nof Standards and Technology, which maintains the common vulnerabilities and\nexposures repository, called for a slight pause to regroup and reprioritize\nits efforts.\n\nNIST scaled back the NVD program in mid-February, and is currently\nprioritizing analysis of the most significant or actively exploited\nvulnerabilities. The slowdown was precipitated by \u201can increase in software\nand, therefore, vulnerabilities, as well as a change in interagency support,\u201d\nNIST said in the announcement.\n\nThe federal agency is seeking more support from within the government and\nreassigning staff as it assembles a public-private consortium to address long-\nterm challenges and determine how to improve the NVD program. In the interim,\nthe temporary delays in CVE analysis will result in less detailed analysis of\nvulnerabilities deemed non-urgent.\n\nThe work and output of NIST\u2019s NVD program is remarkable. The agency reported\nan all-time high of 33,137 disclosures last year, a 318% increase from 2005\nwhen the NVD first came online, according to Flashpoint research.\n\nGovernment agencies, private companies, researchers and threat hunters use\nNVD\u2019s standards-based vulnerability management data to automate security\nmeasurement and compliance, and assess, mitigate and spot potential risks\nlurking in these CVEs.\n\n\u201cSo many folks have, honestly, probably been taking it for granted for years,\u201d\nsaid Caitlin Condon, director of vulnerability research at Rapid7.\n\nNVD has long been an authoritative and widely trusted source for vulnerability\ninformation, despite occasional disputes about NIST\u2019s timeliness or\ntransparency, CVSS scores, common platform enumeration (CPE), or root cause\nidentification.\n\n\u201cSecurity professionals across a variety of disciplines like research and\nvulnerability management have come to rely on NVD,\u201d said Emily Austin,\nprincipal security researcher at Censys. \u201cIt's built into vulnerability\nmanagement tools and processes across many organizations, and its importance\nreally can't be overstated.\u201d\n\n### NVD slowdown creates difficulties downstream\n\nImpacts from the NVD slowdown are expected to materialize over time, and\ncybersecurity experts anticipate a snowball effect as some vulnerabilities\nreceive less attention from NIST.\n\nSome vendors disclose very little information about vulnerabilities in their\nproducts. When NIST isn\u2019t filling that analysis gap, the responsibility\nultimately falls on threat hunters, researchers and security companies.\n\nOther vulnerability catalogs exist, such as the Mitre Corp.\u2019s CVE.org and the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s known exploited\nvulnerabilities catalog, but the former doesn\u2019t have the federal government\u2019s\nofficial backing as a trusted source of truth and the latter is limited in\nscope.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s value in being able to use a common language to discuss CVEs. That\nsaid, I also see concerns with having a single point of failure, as we\u2019re\nexperiencing now,\u201d Austin said.\n\nThe temporary delays have already made it much more difficult for\norganizations to understand what software and products in their environments\nare vulnerable to a given CVE, according to Austin.\n\n\u201cThose working in vulnerability management and the tools they rely on are at a\nmajor disadvantage as a result of the NVD issues,\u201d Austin said.\n\n### Challenges confronting the NVD\n\nThe sheer glut of vulnerabilities that NIST must analyze combined with the\nagency\u2019s resource constraints has created a backlog in the NVD.\n\n\u201cEven before the start of the NVD slowdown, NVD has been significantly behind\nin analysis of the growing number of disclosures for years, often ranging from\ntwo to six weeks to analyze a given vulnerability. Over time, this gap in\ncoverage has culminated to over 100,000 vulnerabilities missed by CVE and\nNVD,\u201d Flashpoint research found.\n\nBudget alone cannot fix NIST's constraints because people with the specialized\nskills required to analyze issues confronting AI, climate, communications,\ncybersecurity, health, infrastructure, manufacturing and quantum science are\nscarce. The agency has an expansive remit to promote U.S. innovation and\ncompetitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards and technology.\n\nThat kind of lofty mission requires resources.\n\nThe agency, which has a workforce of approximately 3,400 people and a fiscal\nyear 2023 budget of $1.6 billion, is struggling to compete for and retain\nspecialized talent in a competitive market, according to a 2023 report by the\nU.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nNIST did not answer questions about how many employees are responsible for the\nNVD or when it expects to complete the improvement process and return to\nnormal operations.\n\nA large portion of NIST\u2019s analysis resources are spent on CPE generation,\nwhich, in theory, is work best suited for the software vendor, according to\nCondon.\n\n\u201cI would wonder whether any software vendors even know that that's their\nresponsibility, or that they are in the best position to be doing it,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nThe current model isn\u2019t working and this underscores the extent to which more\nentities and experts across the cybersecurity industry need to step up and\nrely less on NIST.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what they owe us,\u201d Condon said. \u201cI would hope that a larger\nportion of our energy and brainpower and discussion goes toward understanding\nthe process as it works today, where the pain points are, what we need it to\ndo, and then where there are opportunities for scalability improvements.\u201d\n\n  * post\n  * share\n  * tweet\n  * print\n  * email\n  * license\n\nFiled Under: Vulnerability, Policy & Regulation\n\n### Cybersecurity Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n### Editors' picks\n\n  * Photo illustration by Danielle Ternes/Cybersecurity Dive; photograph by yucelyilmaz via Getty Images\n\n### CISA revises cybersecurity performance goals\n\nAfter months of feedback from stakeholders, the agency made changes to better\nalign with the NIST framework and update language on MFA.\n\nBy David Jones \u2022 March 22, 2023\n\n  * Getty via Getty Images\n\n### How 7 cybersecurity experts manage their passwords\n\nCybersecurity Dive asked CISOs and other cyber experts what they do with their\npasswords.
