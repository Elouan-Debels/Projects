AI is set to disrupt yet\nanother market: pornography. Advancements in machine learning and AI\nalgorithms for image and video production have contributed to the growth of\nwebsites for AI-generated pornography, commonly referred to as AI porn.\n\nThe mass production of AI porn has significant ethical and social\nimplications. It can offer an unprecedented quantity of customizable sexual\nstimuli tailored to users\u2019 preferences while drastically cutting down\nproduction costs.\n\nOn one hand, these new tools enable content creators to produce diverse\nerotica and allow widespread access to personalized sexual stimuli that meet\npeople\u2019s needs and desires, thereby enhancing their sex life and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, it could lead to problematic overuse of pornography, the\nspread of deepfakes, and the production of illegal content, such as child\npornography.\n\nAI porn also has labour implications, and could create copyright issues as\nwell as impact the jobs of sex workers and adult content creators.\n\nIn all likelihood, the impact of AI porn will be more nuanced: some users will\nbenefit, while others may be negatively impacted by it. However, the pace of\ntechnological developments leaves little time to plan and research how to\nharmoniously integrate this new technology into our lives. Like in many other\nsectors, we are not ready for AI porn.\n\nThe increasing applications of AI in various industries is reshaping everyday\nlife.

History and current technological trends both indicate that\nthe next stage of erotica production will be more sophisticated and involved.\n\nCurrently, there are over 50 free websites offering AI porn, and this number\nwill only increase. Websites such as Candy.ai, Lustlab.ai, and Pornify.cc\nallow users to design AI characters to their own preferences, making their\nfantasies come to life.\n\nUsers can generate images by writing text prompts or selecting specific\ncharacteristics, such as age, gender, hairstyle, ethnicity and other bodily\nattributes. They can also select clothes, positions, locations, behaviours and\nfacial expressions, as well as opt for either realistic or animated\ncharacters.\n\nThis allows for immense diversity in terms of images and characters that can\nbe generated. Unsurprisingly, however, the majority of content features women\nand female bodies.\n\n## Sophisticated AI\n\nIn addition to images, some sites now also offer the option to generate short,\nlooping videos. These clips typically feature a brief repeated sequence of a\nspecific action. Despite their humble beginnings, these clips hint at the\nfuture of AI porn: lengthy, complex and entirely customizable AI-generated\npornographic videos created by professionals, laypeople or AIs themselves.\n\nMore complex text-to-video generators already exist, however, the anticipated\nrelease of OpenAI\u2019s model Sora suggests significant progress in text-to-video\ngeneration, namely in its high level of realism, complex scene creation and\nunmatched video length.\n\nWhile Sora will restrict its use, prohibiting users from generating sexual\ncontent on the platform, this underlying technology will eventually find its\nway into AI-generated pornographic videos.\n\nBeyond images and videos, various sites also allow users to engage with a sex\nchatbot for conversation. Users can customize their own AI chatbot, specifying\npersonality traits, appearance and preferences.\n\nWhen a user creates an account, the site keeps a record of previous\nconversations to facilitate continuous interaction. Through this sustained\ndialogue, the AI can further provide personalized images or even engage in\nconfidential voice calls.\n\nThis framework is designed to offer enhanced companionship and elevate the\nexperience of a romantic or sexual partnership \u2014 hinting, once again, at the\nfuture of porn: one where it is combined with artificial companions.\n\nWith the rise of virtual and augmented reality environments, we can also\nanticipate that \u2014 like with present-day pornography \u2014 AI porn will soon\nprovide increasingly immersive experiences.\n\nAI porn has applications in sexual therapy and education.

Users may find themselves gradually drawn deeper into a world\nwhere their desires are continuously met, furthering risks of dependency or\nsocial isolation.\n\nThe recent creation and dissemination of Taylor Swift pornographic deepfakes\nhighlighted the issue of consent and AI-generated sexually explicit content.\nStudies indicate that approximately 98 per cent of deepfake videos found\nonline are of a pornographic nature, with women being the predominant targets\nin almost all cases.\n\nAI porn could also jeopardize the livelihoods of sex workers and adult content\ncreators, posing tangible risks for performers to lose traction and income as\nthey gradually compete with the flood of AI-generated content.\n\nAI porn creators could also use the technology to produce other illegal\ncontent, such as child pornography.\n\nConversely, AI porn could be used to enhance sexual pleasure. Individuals can\nmaterialize their deepest fantasies with only a few clicks.\n\nIt could also be employed in sex research to gain a deeper understanding of\nthe depth of human desires and fantasies and provide safe, standardized and\ninteractive stimuli during experiments. AI porn can be used in education to\nshowcase the diversity of bodies and preferences.\n\nAI porn has applications in therapy, where it can offer adapted stimuli to\nassess and treat fears or anxiety-based sexual dysfunctions, for instance,\nthrough exposure to progressively more intense sexual content.\n\nAI porn could also serve as a tool for individuals to learn how to navigate\nhealthy sexual and romantic relationships. Finally, AI could provide adult\ncontent creators with tools to grow their business.\n\n## The future of porn\n\nWhile evidence-based laws could be put in place to mitigate the risks\nassociated with AI-generated sexually explicit content, it would be paramount\nto educate users and creators in their sexuality and practice of consent. More\nresearch is also needed to understand the influence of this technology and\nguide its development.\n\nAI will change the adult industry, and its impact on our intimacy and\nsexuality will soon become known.\n\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Sex\n  * Pornography\n  * Ethics\n  * Augmented reality\n  * VR\n  * Adult content\n  * AI pornography\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Research Fellow \u2013 Beyond The Resource Curse\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\n  * ##### Director, Defence and Security\n\n  * ##### Opportunities with the new CIEHF\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": true}
