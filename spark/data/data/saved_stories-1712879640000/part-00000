To do so, we\nhave been using Gradio, a low-code prototyping toolkit from Hugging Face, to\nspin up experiments and experiences. Gradio has allowed us to validate\nconcepts through prototyping without large investments of time, effort, or\ninfrastructure.\n\nAlthough Gradio has made the development phase of prototyping easier, the\ndesign phase has been largely the same. Even with Gradio, designers have had\nto create components in Figma, outline expected user flows and behaviors, and\nhand off designs for developers in the same way they have always done. While\nworking on a recent exploration, we realized something was needed: a set of\nFigma components based on Gradio that enabled designers to create wireframes\nquickly.\n\nToday, we are releasing our library of design components for Gradio for others\nto use. The components are based on version 4.23.0 of Gradio and will be\navailable through our Figma profile: Mozilla Innovation Projects,\nhttps://www.figma.com/@futureatmozilla. We hope these components help teams\naccelerate their discovery and experimentation with ML and generative AI.\n\nYou can find out more about Gradio at https://www.gradio.app/ and more about\ninnovation at Mozilla at https://future.mozilla.org\n\nThanks to Amy Chiu and Anais Ron who created the components and to the Gradio\nteam for their work. Happy designing!\n\n## What\u2019s Inside Gradio UI for Figma?\n\nBecause Gradio is an ever-changing prototyping kit, current components are\nbased on version 4.23.0 of Gradio. We selected components based on their wide\narray of potential uses. Here is a list of the components inside the kit:\n\n  * Typography (e.g. headers, body fonts)\n  * Iconography (e.g. chevrons, arrows, corner expanders)\n\nSmall Components:\n\n  * Buttons\n  * Checkbox\n  * Radio\n  * Sliders\n  * Tabs\n  * Accordion\n  * Delete Button\n  * Error Message\n  * Media Type Labels\n  * Media Player Controller\n\nBig Components:\n\n  * Label + Textbox\n  * Accordion with Label + Input\n  * Video Player\n  * Label + Counter\n  * Label + Slider\n  * Accordion + Label\n  * Checkbox with Label\n  * Radio with Label\n  * Accordion with Content\n  * Accordion with Label + Input\n  * Top navigation\n\n## How to Access and Use Gradio UI for Figma\n\nTo start using the library, follow these simple steps:\n\n  1. Access the Library: Access the component library directly by visiting our public Figma profile (https://www.figma.com/@futureatmozilla) or by searching for \u201cGradio UI for Figma\u201d within the Figma Community section of your web or desktop Figma application.\n  2. Explore the Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the components and guidelines to make the most out of your design process.\n  3.
