You can specify\nthe server's IP address (default is 127.0.0.1:8000) or others. For more\ndetails, see the uvicorn documentation here.\n\n    \n    \n    $ uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n\n## How to bypass the daily request limit\n\nIf you search too many things in a short time, the above warning sign will\nappear on your screen. This is caused by Google's Bot Detector (also called\n'Recaptcha'), not what we intend. It blocks any access to google scholar until\nyou prove that \"I'm not a bot!\".\n\nThe general ways to bypass the bot checking process are:\n\n  1. Try again tomorrow! Google periodically expires the limit, so waiting a couple of hours highly resolves it.\n  2. Constantly rotate IP address or Get help from a Proxy. It certainly minimizes the risk of being flagged as a bot activity.\n\nFor the second strategy, please refer following guidelines.\n\n### Method 1: Usage of free-proxy package\n\nfree-proxy is a python package that finds out the addresses of free working\nproxies.\n\n    \n    \n    $ pip install free-proxy\n\nFirst, get a URL of available proxy.\n\n    \n    \n    >>> from fp.fp import FreeProxy >>> proxy_url = FreeProxy(rand=True).get() 'http://138.68.60.8:3128'\n\nIn main.py, find out the global variable named PROXY and change it as below.\n\n    \n    \n    # main.py PROXY = { 'http': 'http://138.68.60.8:3128' }\n\nFinally, restart the server.\n\n    \n    \n    $ uvicorn main:app --reload\n\n### Method 2: Usage of Proxy service platform\n\nProxy provider offers more reliable IP rotation service (Note that such a\nstrategy may demand a service fee).\n\nFor example, oxylabs can be an ideal choice. Make an account and get your keys\n(USERNAME and PASSWORD).\n\nUpdate the variable PROXY in main.py.\n\n    \n    \n    # main.py PROXY = { 'http': 'http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@unblock.oxylabs.io:60000', 'https': 'http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@unblock.oxylabs.io:60000', }\n\nNow, re-run the server.\n\n    \n    \n    $ uvicorn main:app --reload\n\n## About\n\nSorting Google Scholar search results based on the number of citations\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n1 star\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 1\n\nv1.0.0 Latest\n\nMar 26, 2024\n\n## Languages\n\n  * JavaScript 53.0%\n  * CSS 24.1%\n  * Python 16.2%\n  * HTML 6.7%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
