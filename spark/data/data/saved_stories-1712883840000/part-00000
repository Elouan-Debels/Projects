There were also\nplants built in Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Japan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South\nKorea, Greece and Zimbabwe.\n\nMeanwhile, a slowdown in coal plant shutdowns in the US and Europe led to more\nthan 21GW retiring last year. This resulted in a net annual increase of almost\n48.5GW for the year, the highest since 2016.\n\nThe authors of the report said coal plants needed to shut at a faster pace,\nand that China needed to adopt stricter controls on its expansion of capacity.\n\nFlora Champenois, a Global Energy Monitor analyst, said: \u201cOtherwise we can\nforget about meeting our goals in the Paris agreement and reaping the benefits\nthat a swift transition to clean energy will bring,.\u201d\n\nClimate scientists have said all coal plants should be shut by 2040 \u2013 unless\nthey are fitted with effective carbon-removal technology \u2013 if governments hope\nto limit global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels.\n\nThis would require an average of 126GW of coal plants to retire from the\ncurrent fleet of 2,130GW every year for the next 17 years, according to the\nreport, or the equivalent of about two plants a week.\n\nChampenois described last year\u2019s coal plant expansion as an \u201canomaly\u201d as more\nsigns point to it \u201creversing course\u201d. \u201cBut countries that have coal plants to\nretire need to do so more quickly, and countries that have plans for new coal\nplants must make sure these are never built.\u201d\n\nResearch by Capital Economics suggests China\u2019s appetite for coal power may\nreduce as low-carbon options accelerate.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
