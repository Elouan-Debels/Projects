We have also argued that\nthese mental health declines are driven\u2014in large part\u2014by the combination of\nrising overprotection in the real world and underprotection online. In\nresponse to researchers who are skeptical of this theory, Jean Twenge\naddressed thirteen alternative explanations\u2014including the Global Financial\nCrisis of 2008\u2014and showed why each of those alternatives was inconsistent with\nknown facts about the timing and nature of the crisis. (See also Jon\u2019s recent\nresponse to skeptics who claim that we have \u201cno evidence\u201d of causality, only\nof correlation.)\n\nHowever, there are other alternative explanations that still need to be\naddressed, specifically those based on claims that the mental health crisis is\nnot real, or has been overstated. In this post, I address three of the\nassertions that would support the \u201coverstated\u201d hypothesis:\n\n  1. The rise in self-harm rates is mostly an artifact of reduced stigma\n\n  2. The rise in self-harm rates is mostly a result of changes in reporting and screening\n\n  3. There is no international rise in teen girls\u2019 suicide rates.\n\nIn short, I will argue that there is an international crisis, that a majority\nof the rise in rates of self-harm cannot be explained by reduced stigma and\nreporting changes alone, and that the conversation around international\nsuicide rates has been muddied by two datasets that tend to underestimate\nknown rates of teen suicide since 2010. Simply put, this alternative\nexplanation (the \u201coverstated\u201d hypothesis) is unable to adequately explain the\ninternational deterioration of youth mental health since the early 2010s.\n\n(Note that Jon and I have been collecting every alternative explanation we can\nfind in an open-source Google Doc \u2013 if we are missing any, please add them\nthere. I plan to cover others in future posts. Also, note that I focus\nprimarily on girls and young women in this post because this is where the\ncentral debate is happening between social media use and mental health\noutcomes. For more on boys, see this Substack post).\n\n##\n\nChallenge #1: The girls are alright: Rates of self-harm are rising primarily\nbecause there\u2019s less stigma associated with going to the emergency room.\n\nA common claim made to explain the changes in youth mental health trends\u2014from\nanxiety to suicidal ideation\u2014is that there is simply less stigma associated\nwith talking about mental health and seeking support. Therefore, it is not\npossible to differentiate between changes in stigma and changes in actual\nmental health outcomes. Although Jon and I agree that there has been a\nreduction in mental health stigma in recent decades, we have pointed out that\nchanges in behavioral outcomes, such as emergency department visits for self-\nharm and actual suicide, are hard to explain by changes in stigma and self-\nreports alone.\n\nSome have pointed out that emergency department visits for self-harm may also\nbe influenced by changing norms and willingness to seek help, making these\ndata yet another unreliable gauge for true changes in a population's mental\nhealth. However, I believe that rates of hospitalizations can help us\ndistinguish the signal from the noise and more reliably indicate whether the\nmental health of a population is getting worse.\n\nBeing hospitalized is much rarer than visiting the emergency department, and\nit requires clearance by their medical provider (i.e., kids are not making the\nchoice themselves). Most kids who go to the emergency department are not\nhospitalized, as hospitalization is reserved for the most severe cases.\nHospitalization requires an enormous amount of time, money, and resources\n(e.g., beds)2 \u2014 and for a variety of reasons (e.g., preference for less\nrestrictive care), providers are not particularly inclined to want to\nhospitalize kids unless necessary. These resource constraints plus a general\nreticence to hospitalize would mean that even if many of the increases in\nemergency department visits were a result of reduced stigma and a higher\nwillingness to seek help, this would not explain sudden and rapid changes in\nactual hospitalizations. (Unless one is to argue that thousands of preteen\ngirls in many countries with severe symptoms were not going to the emergency\nroom in 2008, and then suddenly started to go in the early 2010s because of a\nsudden reduction in stigma).\n\nUsing CDC nonfatal self-harm data from 2001-2021, we can zoom in on trends\namong adolescents who first go to the emergency department and are\nsubsequently hospitalized. The data reveals a clear story: Since 2007-08,\nthere has been a 518% increase in hospitalizations for 10-14-year-old girls.\n(The rates for 10-14-year-old boys were unavailable).\n\nFigure 1. Hospitalization for intentional self-harm has risen by 518% since\n2007-08 among U.S. 10-14 year-old girls. Note that there are some missing data\nyears. Also, note that boys are not included as their rates are so low.\n(Source: CDC Non-Fatal Injury Reports.)\n\nThe data for 15-19-year-old girls also shows a large rise, as you can see in\nFigure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Hospitalization for intentional self-harm has risen by 91% since\n2007-09 among U.S. 15-19 year-old girls. Source: CDC Non-Fatal Injury Reports.\n(Spreadsheet).\n\nSo, while the initial reason adolescent girls are showing up at the ED at\nhigher rates could plausibly be related to decreased stigma, it does not\nexplain why they would be actually admitted more often unless they were, in\nfact, actually experiencing severe symptoms. In fact, this 518% increase in\nhospital admissions for younger teen girls is the largest increase I have seen\nin all of the hundreds of datasets I have graphed.\n\nOne last note on this: it is not clear why we would see rises in emergency\ndepartment visits and self-harm hospitalizations all across the Anglosphere at\nthe same time and concentrated among the same group of people (adolescent\ngirls) and not other age groups if this was mostly a result of\ndestigmatization. Could destigmatization have happened in so many countries\nsimultaneously and so rapidly?\n\n##\n\nChallenge #2: The girls are alright: The rise in self-harm is a result of\nchanging diagnostic criteria and screening.\n\nA second challenge that has emerged in recent months came from an important\narticle by the economists Adrianna Corredor-Williams and Janet Currie at the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, arguing that a substantial amount of the\nrise in reported self-harm episodes among adolescent girls over the last\ndecade may be explained by a variety of changes in the way that these episodes\nare screened and reported by doctors and clinicians.\n\nSpecifically, Corredor-Williams and Currie point to a series of changes in\npsychiatric healthcare between 2010 and 2015:\n\n  * In 2010, the Affordable Care Act was passed, spurring many healthcare reforms from increased mental health coverage for young adults (18-26) to mandating insurance companies to cover yearly screenings for depression among adolescents and requiring the Health and Human Services to develop new guidelines for preventive services for women (which led to recommendations for girls ages 12 and older to be screen annually for depression).\n\n  * In 2013, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (aka the DSM-5) was released. This new version updated the definitions of anxiety and depression, such as including bereavement as a form of depression and merging dysthymic disorder (low-level but chronic depression) and major depressive disorder into a new category of persistent depressive disorder. The criteria for anxiety disorders were also refined, aiming for more precise diagnostic specifications. (But note that these changes do not have any clear connection to changes in rates of hospitalizations for non-fatal self-harm).\n\n  * In 2015, the International Classification of Diseases (aka the ICD) was updated from the ICD-9 to ICD-10. This change had impacts on coding for self-harming and suicide-related behaviors. In the ICD-9, providers had to enter two codes to indicate self-harm (one being the type of injury and one being its intent). The ICD-10 only required providers to include one code for self-harm. The ICD-10 also introduced a new system of notes that was designed to make coding more precise. Specifically, it encouraged providers to include a second code to a primary mental health code. For example, in the ICD-9, if someone is coded primarily with \u201cdepression,\u201d they may not also be coded with \u201csuicidal ideation\u201d as these two often overlap. In the ICD-10, it was encouraged to put both codes in. This change may have inflated the number of additional diagnoses.\n\nTaken together, the authors argue that these changes can help explain some of\nthe rise in mental health problems and demonstrate how this appears to be the\ncase for self-harm episodes in New Jersey hospitals.\n\nThese are important factors to consider, and I don\u2019t doubt that such changes\nhad an impact on reporting and rates in the U.S. But to what extent? Can they\nexplain why youth mental health rates changed so rapidly around the United\nStates in a way that so closely aligns with international trends? I believe\nthat they cannot, as I have found four important contradictions that go\nagainst what we can call the \u201cchanging diagnostic hypothesis.\u201d\n\n###\n\nContradiction #1: The changing diagnostics hypothesis predicts that the big\nrise in self-harm hospitalizations should happen after 2015, but in fact, it\nhappened much earlier.\n\nAs you saw in Figures 1 and 2 above, the rise in hospitalizations for self-\nharm began before 2015, around 2010 (long before the ICD change).\n\nIn fact, the average estimated yearly increase of adolescent girls (ages\n10-19) admitted to hospitals from 2010 to 2015 (2,224 girls per year) was\nlarger than it was from 2016 to 2020 (an additional 614 girls per year).\n\nOther major studies on inpatient psychiatric ED and hospitalization trends\nconfirm these post-2009 increases among adolescent girls.\n\n###\n\nContradiction #2: The changing diagnostic hypothesis predicts that we should\nsee changes across all age groups, but in fact, we only see increases among\nadolescent girls.\n\nIf the sudden sharp rise in rates of self-harm were caused by a sudden change\nin diagnostic criteria, then we would see sudden rises for all age groups and\nfor males and females. But this is not what we see (as Figure 3 shows). In\nfact, among women, the only age group showing a substantial rise is girls ages\n10-19.3 Hospitalizations among women above the age of 30 have actually been\ndeclining since 2010.\n\nFigure 3. Hospitalizations for non-fatal self-harm episodes among women (ages\n10-59). Source: CDC Non-Fatal Injury Reports. (Spreadsheet).\n\n(Note: We see these same sex by age-based patterns in Australia. This is the\none additional Anglo country I have specific hospitalization data that looks\nacross age groups.)\n\n###\n\nContradiction #3: The changing diagnostics hypothesis predicts that all\ncountries will see a rise after the 2015 change in the ICD, but changes before\nthen will be scattered and not coordinated. But\u2014in reality\u2014rates have been\nrising consistently and coordinated across all five of the major Anglosphere\nnations since the early 2010\n\nFigure 4 shows the coordinated international rise in self-harm episodes among\nadolescent girls since the early 2010s.\n\n###\n\nAdolescent Self-harm Episodes in Five Anglo Nations\n\nFigure 4. Since 2010, rates of self-harm episodes have increased for\nadolescents in the Anglosphere countries, especially for girls. For data on\nall sources and larger versions of the graphs, see Rausch and Haidt (2023).\nBefore 2010, not much happened. By 2015, self-harm episodes were at record-\nhigh levels in all five countries. (Data for Canada is limited to Ontario\nprovince, which contains nearly 40% of the population of Canada.)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the rise between 2009 and 2015 in Canada, the UK,\nAustralia, and New Zealand cannot be explained by uniquely American trends,\nsuch as the ACA or American-based changes in mental health screening\nprocedures. This matters because the consistent international pattern of\nincreasing self-harm rates among adolescent girls since the early 2010s (and\nnot older adults)4 puts in doubt the claim that the American rise in self-harm\nis primarily explained by those changes as well.5\n\n(See footnote for 6 contradiction #4, which discusses changes in primary and\nsecondary coding. In short, the data from the early 2010s indicate an increase\nin hospital admissions for children where the primary reason is suicidality\nand self-harm. This suggests that the observed increase in admissions cannot\nbe solely attributed to an increase in recording these issues as secondary\ndiagnoses.)6\n\nTaking all of the contradictions together, it is clear that in the United\nStates, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, more adolescent girls are\ngoing to the emergency department for self-harm episodes and/or being\nhospitalized for self-harming behavior. The international pattern cannot be\nexplained by American changes in insurance policies or screening, nor can it\nbe explained by changes in the DSM (which were related to anxiety and\ndepression) or the shift from ICD-9 to 10 because all of this started before\nthe ICD-10 came into effect.\n\nShare\n\n##\n\nChallenge #3: Suicide rates among teen girls are not rising in most developed\ncountries.\n\nA third claim I often hear is that while teen suicide rates have been rising\nin the U.S. since 2010, they are not rising in many other countries around the\nworld. I have addressed this argument in previous posts, showing that the\nrises in poor mental health (including suicide) are missed when we combine\neveryone and everything together in our analyses.\n\nSpecifically, I show that when we combine trends for girls and boys together\n(or teens and adults), it often hides the fact that suicide rates have been\nrising for teen girls (see my post on Gen Z girls\u2019 rising suicide rates across\nthe Anglosphere).\n\nFigure 5, produced by The Economist, is a good illustration of this pattern.\nAcross 17 nations, we see a clear overall trend toward declining suicide\nrates, for males and for females, with one big exception: females in their\nteens. There\u2019s also a smaller exception: females in their 20s. When graphs\nmerge all ages together, or merge both sexes together, the large change in\nsuicide for girls and young women is masked.\n\nFigure 5. Percent changes in suicide rates in 17 nations. Source: The\nEconomist. (The data comes from the national statistical authorities and\nhealth agencies of: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, England &\nWales, Estonia, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Slovenia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States).\n\nIn my previous posts, I also show that when we combine all countries together,\nit hides the fact that suicide rates have been rising in more wealthy,\nsecular, and individualistic countries, which includes, especially, the\nhistorically Protestant countries. In this post, I want to address just one\naspect of the international suicide debate: the datasets that are being used.\nOne of the reasons for disagreement among researchers is that we are relying\non different datasets to look at international trends in suicide rates. I have\nfound that two frequently used datasets are underestimating known rates of\nyouth suicide from government death registries. I covered one of those\u2014the\nGlobal Burden of Disease Study\u2014in a previous post. But the second, the WHO\nGlobal Health Estimates also fails to present accurate suicide rate data in\ncountries where we have high-quality death registration data.\n\nFigure 6 shows youth suicide rates in the USA according to three different\nsources. The most reliable is the CDC, shown in green, which compiles actual\nnumbers of suicides per year, while the WHO GHE (in red) and the GBD (in\norange) are estimates of youth suicide. As you can see in Figure 6, both the\nWHO Global Health Estimates and the Global Burden of Disease Study\nunderestimate the actual changes in youth suicide rates since 2010.\n\nFigure 6. Comparing youth suicide rates between the Global Burden of Disease\nStudy (which estimate suicide rates), the WHO Global Health Estimates (which\nestimate suicide rates), and CDC suicide rates (which are based on actual\nreported cases). (Spreadsheet).\n\nIn fact, I have been in touch with researchers at Our World in Data (which\noften relies on both the GBD and WHO GHE estimates) to try and address this\nissue. After an initial inquiry into the discrepancies, they reported back to\nme that:\n\n> For countries with high-quality death registration, including the U.S., the\n> WHO GHE methodology says that it uses the most recent vital registration\n> (VR) data, which should be the same as the WHO MDB data [WHO Mortality\n> Database].7 However, they seem to be lower across countries that I explored\n> \u2014 United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, etc. \u2014 in the most recent\n> years. [bolding added by Zach]\n\n[NOTE: Our World in Data just addressed this issue by publishing the WHO MDB\ndata on Tuesday, which now allows us to compare countries with high quality\ndeath registration rates more accurately. But those rates are still not split\nby sex.]\n\nIn sum, it appears that both the WHO Global Health Estimates and the Global\nBurden of Disease Study have been underestimating youth suicide rates since\n2010 across many countries around the world. However, when using national\nhigh-quality death registration data, I have consistently found a pattern that\nsuicide rates have been rising for adolescent girls across the Anglosphere and\nin the more wealthy, secular, and individualistic nations since the early\n2010s.\n\nLeave a comment\n\n##\n\nWhy suicide rates are not enough\n\nThere is one last point I want to make. Even though some agree that rates of\nsuicide are rising for teen girls (and this is happening in many nations),\nthey have argued that we are creating a panic over a \u201csmall\u201d rise in suicide\nrates. And, in the process, we are missing the big picture by not looking at\ngroups who have much higher rates (such as middle-aged men).\n\nIt is true that compared to adults (and males), teen girls die by suicide at\nvery low rates. For example, teen male suicide rates are just about three\ntimes higher than teen girls, and their high and rising rates are not\ndiscussed enough, as Richard Reeves has shown. It is essential that we\nunderstand this context and its implications so that we orient resources based\non these facts.\n\n[NOTE: Even though the rates for teen girls are low, they are not negligible.\nTo put these statistics in perspective, if the suicide rate for 10-19-year-\nolds remained at its 2010 levels, there would be more than 3,000 girls and\n5,000 boys still alive today.]\n\nBut here is the broader point I want to make: Suicide is a sex- and age-\nspecific phenomenon. Young children rarely die by suicide, while adults do so\nfar more often. Men almost always die by suicide at higher rates than women.\nThis is not because the average adolescent or woman is that much happier than\nthe average adult or man. Instead, there are many cultural and biological\nforces that drive individuals from some groups to die by suicide at higher\nrates than individuals in other groups (a topic for another post).8\n\nIn other words, we cannot assume just because rates of suicide for teen girls\nare low that teen girls are not struggling in unprecedented ways. If we want\nto get a clear view of adolescent mental health, we need to look at a range of\nmeasures\u2014from depression and self-harm (which is far more common among\nadolescents) to suicide rates. If we decide to narrowly focus on only one of\nthese measures, we are sure to miss an enormous amount of important\ninformation and context about the well-being of young people.\n\nMy point is this: if we dismiss rises in teen girls' suicide rates because\nthey are \u201clow\u201d and then do not account for other\u2014more common\u2014mental health\nproblems among teen girls because the measures are imprecise, then when\nexactly should we start paying attention?\n\n##\n\nConclusion\n\nMy goal in this post was to address some counterarguments offered by some\nresearchers who are skeptical that there really has been a rise in rates of\nadolescent mental illness. They think that American and British societies are\nnow in the grip of a moral panic and that Jon and I are fomenting that panic\nwith our charts, graphs, and claims about the \u201cgreat rewiring of childhood.\u201d\nWe disagree. As I have shown here, three of the most common critiques are\nchallenged by the international trends. We think it is time to start taking\naction.\n\nOne of our reasons for starting this Substack was to draw out such criticisms\nand then address them. We invite you to check our work and draw your own\nconclusions. Let us know if you think we are wrong.\n\n1\n\nClarification of our argument: We argue that since the 1980s, children began\nto be systematically deprived of a \u201cplay-based childhood\u201d (where kids have an\nenormous amount of free play, social interaction, independence, and\nresponsibility in the real world to wire up their brains to thrive as adults).\nBetween 2010 and 2015, this \u201cplay-based childhood\u201d was fully replaced by the\n\u201cphone-based childhood\u201d (where kids spend most of their time on devices and do\nnot experience the free play, independence, and responsibility that they need\nin the real world to thrive as adults). We argue that the mechanisms of\nharm\u2014on average\u2014from the \u201cphone-based childhood\u201d are different for boys and\nfor girls, with girls being harmed most substantially from the combination of\nsmartphones and social media platforms, while boys have been harmed in a more\ndiffuse way, and most substantially from the ways that smartphones, social\nmedia, video games, and the host of other virtual activities have pushed out\nmuch of their real-world interactions, friendships, sleep, and exertion in the\nreal world.\n\n2\n\nNote that there has been a bedding crisis in psychiatric hospitals around the\ncountry where there is more demand than supply, leading many people being\nstuck in emergency departments waiting to get into hospitals for care.\n\n3\n\nSelf-harm among 20-24 year-olds is also rising, but is not visible in the\nfigure as they are merged with the 25-29 year-olds.\n\n4\n\nWe see similar age specific patterns in Australia, with rises only happening\namong girls and young women. I have not seen data for adults in Canada, the\nUK, or New Zealand.\n\n5\n\nI have found no indications that there were similar screening or insurance\nchanges in Canada, the UK, Australia, or New Zealand from 2010 to 2015. Please\nlet me know in the comments if I am missing something.\n\n6\n\nContradiction #4: The changing diagnostics hypothesis predicts that there\nshould be no increase in primary coding for suicidality or self-harm if the\nprimary driver of the rise in hospitalizations were due to increased\nincentives to use secondary mental health codes (e.g., suicidality in addition\nto a primary code like depression). But we do see a substantial increase in\nprimary coding for suicidality and self-harm.\n\nA 2023 study of pediatric (ages 3 to 17) mental health hospitalizations from\n2009 to 2019 addresses this contradiction. Using the KIDS inpatient database,\na nationally representative database of U.S. acute care hospital discharges,\nthey found that there had been an increase in total annual mental health\nhospitalizations from (an estimated) 160,499 patients in 2009 to 201,932 in\n2019. They found that these increases happened across all races, all income\nbrackets, and across all insurance types. Most notably, for this argument,\nthey found a 66% increase in primary codes of \u201csuicide or self-injury\u201d, rising\nfrom 11,889 in 2009 to 17,997 in 2019. In other words, more kids were being\nadmitted to hospitals for the primary reason of suicidality and self-harm.\nWhat this means is that kids are not just being given additional codes; they\nare going to the hospital specifically because they are presenting symptoms of\nsuicidality and self-harming behavior.\n\nAlso note that this same study found a decline in hospitalizations for\n\u201cschizophrenia,\u201d \u201cdisruptive, impulse control, conduct disorders,\u201d \u201csubstance\nabuse and addiction,\u201d \u201cADHD,\u201d and \u201cbipolar and related disorders.\u201d (Now, it is\npossible and likely that some bipolar coding was shifted to be covered by\ndepression, which grew at a very rapid rate from 2009 to 2019). But my overall\npoint is that kids are being hospitalized more for specific kinds of mental\nhealth conditions: internalizing disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, self-\nharm, suicide, and eating disorders), while not being hospitalized for other\nkinds of disorders (e.g., psychotic disorders or externalizing disorders such\nas \u201cdisruptive, impulse control, conduct disorders.\u201d Internalizing disorders\nare the exact problems we expect to worsen from the phone-based childhood.\n\n7\n\nThe WHO MDB rates map on to CDC rates.\n\n8\n\nIt is important to note that there is extensive variation among other\nsubgroups as well, including variation by race, economic class, and sexual\norientation.\n\n### Subscribe to After Babel\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\nUsing moral psychology to explain why so much is going wrong\n\n73 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n12 Restacks\n\n73\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Girls Are Not Alright: Responses to Three Claims that the Youth\nMental Health Crisis Is Exaggerated\n\nwww.afterbabel.com\n\n17\n\nShare\n\n17 Comments\n\nMark Christenson4 hrs agoThanks for continuing to patiently respond to the\nskeptics with data-driven and logic-driven responses.
