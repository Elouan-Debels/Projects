Once thought to be extinct, today\u2019s wild ferret population descends\nfrom just seven individuals, representing a severe lack of genetic diversity\nthat threatens the long-term survival of the species.\n\nNow with these two new black-masked balls of fuzz added to the mix,\nconservationists hope to begin breeding the two females later this year to\ninject some new blood into the population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cGenetic diversity is critical for resilience to environmental change,\u201d said\nMegan Owen, vice president of conservation science at the San Diego Zoo\nWildlife Alliance, one of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s partners in the cloning effort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically the raw material of adaptive evolution.\u201d\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of plants and animals at risk of extinction,\nscientists and policymakers are increasingly turning to extraordinary\ntechnological means to rescue sea stars, songbirds and other species near the\nedge of oblivion.\n\nUp to a million black-footed ferrets once romped across the mountain basins\nand grasslands of a dozen states before farming, diseases such as the plague\nand the eradication of their prey, the prairie dog, caused their numbers to\nplummet. In 1979, what was believed to be the last black-footed ferret died in\ncaptivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOr so people thought. In 1981, a Wyoming cattle rancher stumbled upon a small\ngroup of black-footed ferrets. Brought into captivity, biologists began\nbreeding them again but only had a handful of individuals with which to work.\n\n\u201cConservationists have worked very hard to bring them back,\u201d said Ben Novak,\nlead scientist at the biotechnology nonprofit Revive & Restore, which also\npartnered with Fish and Wildlife on the cloning project. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a very\ngood job. But due to that historic bottleneck in the \u201980s for black-footed\nferrets, they just have an extremely limited gene pool.\u201d\n\nOne of the female ferrets, named Willa, didn\u2019t leave any living descendants.\nSo in 1988, scientists collected some of her cells and froze them at San Diego\nZoo Wildlife Alliance, where the genetic material of some 1,200 species are\nkept on ice in its \u201cFrozen Zoo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe first of Willa\u2019s clones was born in 2020. Initially, that ferret, named\nElizabeth Ann, appeared healthy. But she never took interest in the suitors\npresented to her. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like the males, and she didn\u2019t even let them\ninto her tunnel,\u201d Novak said. \u201cShe bit one of them on the nose.\u201d\n\nWhen her handlers tried to artificially inseminate her, there was another\nproblem: part of her uterus was filled with fluid, requiring a hysterectomy.\nElizabeth Ann is still alive and kicking, but can\u2019t give birth. Agency\nofficials don\u2019t think her health problems are linked to cloning since the\ncondition can occur in naturally born ferrets, too.\n\nNow Noreen and Antonia, both born last May, represent a second attempt at\nreviving Willa\u2019s genetically distinct lineage. The cloned animals were made by\ninjecting one of Willa\u2019s cells into an egg from a domesticated ferret.\n\nNoreen was born at the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in\nColorado while Antonia lives across the country at the Smithsonian\u2019s National\nZoo & Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile officials don\u2019t plan to release the clones into the wild anytime soon,\nconservationists have reintroduced other black-footed ferrets across the Great\nPlains. But to sustain those populations, wildlife managers regularly apply\ninsecticide to kill plague-carrying fleas and take other measures to control\nthe deadly disease.\n\nRight now, Noreen and Antonia are feisty and appear healthy. As the pair near\ntheir first birthday in May, officials hope to start breeding them later this\nyear.\n\nOwen has yet to meet either one. \u201cI have not seen these two, but I can\u2019t wait\nbecause they are incredibly cute.\u201d\n\n### More on climate change\n\nUnderstanding our climate: Global warming is a real phenomenon, and weather\ndisasters are undeniably linked to it. As temperatures rise, heat waves are\nmore often sweeping the globe \u2014 and parts of the world are becoming too hot to\nsurvive.\n\nWhat can be done? The Post is tracking a variety of climate solutions, as well\nas the Biden administration\u2019s actions on environmental issues. It can feel\noverwhelming facing the impacts of climate change, but there are ways to cope\nwith climate anxiety.\n\nInventive solutions: Some people have built off-the-grid homes from trash to\nstand up to a changing climate. As seas rise, others are exploring how to\nharness marine energy.\n\nWhat about your role in climate change? Our climate coach Michael J.
