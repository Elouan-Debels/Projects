It\u2019s Sheril from Leading Sapiens. Welcome to my newsletter, where I share\nstrategies for getting savvier at the game of work.\n\nToday\u2019s edition is short; designed more for reflection than prescription. I've\nseen too many fall for these logical sounding traps, from newbies to the pros.\nIn fact, the more successful and competent you are, the more likely you\u2019ll\nfall for them. Stay alert.\n\nPrevious editions ICYMI:\n\n  * What Truly Counts Need Not Be Measured\n\n  * The Long Game\n\nBefore jumping in, here\u2019s what I recommend:\n\n  * Go through each of these assumptions.\n\n  * Note the ones you\u2019ve fallen for.\n\n  * Consider why you fall for it? What are your underlying reasons and assumptions?\n\n  * How can you change it? If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth changing, why is that so?\n\nLastly, which one would you like to learn more about? Reply and let me know.\nHere we go.\n\n##\n\nDangerous Assumptions of Unsuccessful Careers\n\n####\n\n1\\. That performance and promotions are correlated.\n\n\u2b91 Promotability is an entirely different beast compared to your KPIs.\nPerformance gets you in the conversation. But not necessarily win it.\n\n  * Related: Implicit Leadership Theories\n\n####\n\n2\\. That promotions are in fact a gauge of your career.\n\n\u2b91 There are many ways to stay engaged in the game and make an impact other\nthan simply promotions.\n\n####\n\n3\\. That all politics is wrong or bad.\n\n\u2b91 Wherever there are human beings, there will be politics. It doesn\u2019t have to\nbe dirty, but you do need to be aware.\n\n  * Related: Donkey, fox, sheep, owl\n\n####\n\n4\\. That a well-functioning workplace is the norm.\n\n\u2b91 Most places are. But they also have their fair share of \"absurdities\".\nYou\u2019re getting paid to fix it, or work in spite of it.\n\n  * Related: Paradoxes in leadership and management\n\n####\n\n5\\. That your intelligence will win the day.\n\n\u2b91 IQ is only one part of the equation. OQ \u2014 organizational quotient \u2014 is the\nother important bit.\n\n  * Related: Why most high-functioning folks probably don\u2019t need any more EQ (emotional intelligence).\n\n####\n\n6\\. That the world should be fair.\n\n\u2b91 Not always. Assuming and hoping that it is, or ranting that it is not, is a\nloser\u2019s game.\n\n  * Related: Fallacies about leadership\n\n####\n\n7\\. That relationships don\u2019t matter in the workplace.\n\n\u2b91 The workplace is made to look logical, but its backbone is human decision-\nmaking. Logic comes second.\n\n  * Related: Why performance reviews are biased\n\n####\n\n8\\. That decision making is logical.\n\n\u2b91 It mostly is, but not always. Your job is to stack as many factors in your\nfavor.\n\n  * Related: How we jump to conclusions\n\n####\n\n9\\. That you can pick and choose when and what to give your best.\n\n\u2b91 It\u2019s always showtime. Including that boring meeting you hate.\n\n####\n\n10\\. That power lies in the folks sitting further up.\n\n\u2b91 This is how we disempower ourselves. The very notion of empowerment has\ndisempowerment built into it.\n\n  * Related: Leaders as gardeners, not chess masters.\n\n####\n\n11\\. That your managers and execs know what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u2b91 They do (mostly). But they also don\u2019t know a lot. That\u2019s where you come in.\n\n  * Related: The iPhone was once a dumb idea.\n\nThat does it for this edition. If you found this valuable, please like and\nshare.
