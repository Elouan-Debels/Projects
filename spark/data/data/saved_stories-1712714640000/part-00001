That\u2019s exactly what a group of scientists did from the inside\nof a Concorde back in June of 1973. These folks were able to spend 74 minutes\nin total darkness as they raced at Mach 2 against the sun.\n\nWill Tesla finally unveil a self-driving vehicle?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nWill Tesla finally unveil a self-driving vehicle? Don't count on it\n\nWe\u2019re now getting a chance to see what they saw and experience what they\nexperienced through a YouTube video detailing what happened up in the air that\nday using 3D renderings. Neat stuff. As we know, total solar eclipses only\nlast a few minutes over a given point, However, that time in darkness can be\ngreatly extended if you \u201ccheat,\u201d according to YouTuber Primal Space.\n\nThe Longest Solar Eclipse Ever\n\nThe mission could only really be done in a Concorde, after all, the shadow was\ntraveling at over 2,200 kilometers per hour \u2013 something Concorde could just\nabout do. It all started in 1972 when French astrophysicist Pierre Lena began\npreparing for the upcoming eclipse. He was mostly interested in observing the\nsun\u2019s corona. To get as much time observing the eclipse as possible, he\nenlisted Concorde test pilot Andre Turcat to fly the mission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, this was no ordinary Concorde. Not only did they use Prototype 001, but\nthe passenger area was completely gutted, and scientific equipment was put in\nits place. They also cut holes in the roof of Concorde\u2019s fuselage and\ninstalled special observation windows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Primal Space via YouTube\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you may have imagined, this flight took a whole lot of planning. A course\nwas detailed with pinpoint accuracy, and a timer was set so that Concorde\ncould reach the path of totality at the exact right moment. If they were a\nlittle late or a little early, the whole mission would have fallen apart. They\nfigured out a course that would be able to give them up to 80 minutes of\ncompletely straight flying in the shadow, even though the shadow was moving on\na slight curve.\n\nOkay, okay. I don\u2019t want to spoil too much else about this video. You should\nreally head over to Primal Space\u2019s YouTube channel to see just how much went\ninto racing Concorde against the sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA version of this article originally appeared on Jalopnik.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
