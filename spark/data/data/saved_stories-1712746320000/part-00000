Download a ZIM archive of Wikipedia. In this example I used\nwikipedia_en_all_maxi_2023-11.zim. You can find the latest version at the\nWikipedia dumps [DUMP], but, if possible, just use this as an index to locate\nthe file name and download it over Bittorrent or google the exact file name\n[GOO] for an alternative download location in order to save Wikipedia some\ntraffic. Remember where you downloaded the file to, in my example it is\n\u201c/home/george/Downloads\u201d.\n\n2\\. Save this script somewhere as \u201crun.sh\u201d:\n\n1234567891011|\n#!/bin/bashdump_path=\"/home/george/Downloads\"dump_file=\"wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2023-11.zim\"docker\nrun -d --restart=always \\\\--volume \"$dump_path:/data\" \\\\--name kiwix \\-p\n7070:80 \\kiwix/kiwix-serve:latest \\\"/data/$dump_file\"  \n---|---  \n  \n3\\. make the script runnable: chmod u+x run.sh\n\n4\\. run the script: ./run.sh\n\n5\\. Your personal offline Wikipedia copy is now accessible at\nhttp://servername:7070\n\nYou can troubleshoot the installation by looking at the console outputs with:\n\ndocker logs -f kiwix\n\n## Resources\n\n[DUMP] https://dumps.wikimedia.org/kiwix/zim/wikipedia/\n\n[GOO] https://www.google.com/search?q=%22wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2023-11.zim%22\n\n### Related\n\n#### Running clamav in Docker under Linux\n\nUpdate 2023.10.20: there is a newer version on Github [3] I'm running ClamAV\n[1] on an Ubuntu 18.04 server in Docker and wanted to document, for\nposteriority and my own dementia, the setup process and considerations.\nThankfully there is an official (?), well-maintained ClamAV image on Docker\nhub.
