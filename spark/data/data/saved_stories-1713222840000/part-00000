Apple has since shared\nadditional details about why it removed iGBA from the App Store, and it also\nclarified its guidelines for emulators.\n\niGBA was a copycat version of developer Riley Testut's open-source GBA4iOS\napp, with the addition of ads on top. While it did not explicitly name\nGBA4iOS, Apple told us it removed iGBA from the App Store after learning that\nit was a knockoff app that copied another developer's work and attempted to\npass it off as its own.\n\nNotably, Apple confirmed to us that emulators on the App Store are permitted\nto load ROMs downloaded from the web, so long as the app is emulating retro\nconsole games only. Apple also said it had approved iGBA's functionality,\nbefore learning that it was a knockoff app, suggesting that Game Boy emulation\nis permitted on the App Store, but the company has yet to share any other\nexamples of retro game consoles.\n\nAll in all, it appears that iGBA was removed from the App Store entirely\nbecause it was a ripoff of GBA4iOS, rather than due to piracy concerns\nresulting from users being able to load any ROM downloaded from the web.\nHowever, exactly which consoles Apple considers to be retro, and if there will\nbe any other restrictions, remains to be seen.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how Nintendo reacts to Apple approving Game Boy\nemulators for distribution through the App Store on the iPhone. On its U.S.\ncustomer support website, Nintendo says downloading pirated copies of its\ngames is illegal:\n\n> Pirate copies of game files are often referred to as \"ROMs\".\n>\n> The uploading and downloading of pirate copies of Nintendo games is illegal.\n\nWe have reached out to Nintendo for comment.\n\nApple updated its App Review Guidelines to permit retro game console emulators\nearlier this month. Apple says developers of emulators are \"responsible for\nall such software\" offered in the app, including compliance with \"all\napplicable laws.\"\n\nTags: App Store, Emulator\n\n[ 54 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nLogamaniac\n\n1 hour ago at 09:51 am\n\nSo why won\u2019t Nintendo just launch a gameboy app that plays old gameboy games\nthey could sell on the AppStore?
