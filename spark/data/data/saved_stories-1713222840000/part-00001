Jacobson (@mzjacobson) April 8, 2024\n\nThis data comes via Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of civil\nand environmental engineering. Jacobson has been updating his X (formerly\nknown as Twitter) page each time the state reaches a record, which has been\npractically every day over the past month.\n\nWhile California has hit 100% renewable energy before, for brief moments on\nexceptionally sunny days, this is the first time the state has sustained that\nsuccess over an extended period.\n\nJacobson, for his part, is taking a victory lap. \"This is getting so easy,\nit's almost boring,\" he wrote on LinkedIn.\n\n\"It's wild that this isn't getting more news coverage,\" Ian Magruder of\nRewiring America wrote, responding to Jacobson's post. \"This has never\nhappened before in history. Yes, California has briefly hit this milestone\nbefore on a few very sunny days since 2022. But never so consistently over a\ntwo week stretch.\"\n\nCalifornia's milestone is a big deal \u2014 in order to curb the massive amount of\nair pollution and planet-overheating gases produced by dirty energy sources\nsuch as gas and oil, we must replace those sources with clean, renewable\nsources such as solar and wind.\n\nGood news, green hacks, and the latest cool clean tech \u2014 straight to your\ninbox every week!\n\n#### Watch now: These futuristic gas stations could completely change what\nit's like to own an EV\n\nThese futuristic gas stations could completely change what it's like to own an\nEV\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 14 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nCopied\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n01:14\n\n01:14\n\nNow, despite what misinformation from dirty energy companies might suggest,\nCalifornia has shown that can indeed be done.\n\nThough California does still rely on dirty energy as well as clean energy to\npower its grid, Jacobson predicted that the state will reach its goal of being\npermanently 100% WindWaterSolar by 2035.\n\n\"In 2009, when we first proposed 100% [WindWaterSolar], the utilities and\nnaysayers claimed the grid would go unstable with more than 20 per cent\nrenewable energy, with no evidence,\" Jacobson wrote on X, per Renew Economy.\n\"In 2017, they claimed, with no evidence, a limit of 80 per cent. In 2020,\nthey claimed 90%, then 95%.
