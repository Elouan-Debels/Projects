Your customers expect your application to be always available,\nand your developers require excellent tooling to live up to those\nexpectations. Lenticulate helps your developer focus on development by\noffloading improvements in developer tooling, process, and operational\nefficiency.\n\nAs a team of former Amazonians with decades of experience, we understand the\ntradeoffs your developer team makes daily. Shipping products to your customers\nfaster, without bugs, in a secure fashion is their priority. There is a\ntradeoff when deciding the next item to work on and often the next feature is\nprioritized more highly over improving tooling, process, or operations.\n\nOver time, technical debt will accumulate. Lenticulate can help you get back\non track to improve the developer experience (DevEx) and streamline operations\n(DevOps), so your team can improve velocity and deliver for your customers.\n\n## Contact us\n\nSchedule a meeting with Daniel (Pacific Time) or Brady (Eastern Time).\n\nOr send us an email!\n\nGet in touch\n\nMade with \u2764\ufe0f by Lenticulate, \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
