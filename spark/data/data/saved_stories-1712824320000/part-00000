Researchers found over three\ndecades that non-optimal temperatures, those above or below temperatures\nassociated with the lowest death rates, were increasingly linked to death and\ndisability due to stroke. The study does not prove that climate change causes\nstroke. It only shows an association. The study also did not examine other\nrisk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels.\nResearchers found that the majority of these strokes were due to lower than\noptimal temperatures, however they also found an increase in strokes tied to\nhigher than optimal temperatures. With lower temperatures, a person\u2019s blood\nvessels can constrict, increasing blood pressure. High blood pressure is a\nrisk factor for stroke. Higher temperatures may cause dehydration, affecting\ncholesterol levels and resulting in slower blood flow, factors that can also\nlead to stroke. \u201cDramatic temperature changes in recent years have affected\nhuman health and caused widespread concern,\u201d said study author Quan Cheng,\nPhD, of Xiangya Hospital Central South University in Changsha, China. \u201cOur\nstudy found that these changing temperatures may increase the burden of stroke\nworldwide, especially in older populations and areas with more health care\ndisparities.\u201d For the study, researchers looked at 30 years of health records\nfor more than 200 countries and territories. They examined the number of\nstroke deaths and burden of stroke-related disability due to non-optimal\ntemperatures. They then divided the data to look at different regions,\ncountries and territories. They also looked at age groups and genders. In\n2019, there were 521,031 stroke deaths linked to non-optimal temperatures.\nThere were also 9.4 million disability-adjusted life years due to stroke\nlinked to non-optimal temperatures. Disability-adjusted life years are the\nnumber of years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with\nillness. When looking at low temperatures compared to high temperatures, they\nfound that 474,002 of the total deaths were linked to low temperatures.\nResearchers found that the rate of death from stroke from temperature changes\nfor male participants was 7.7 per 100,000 compared to 5.9 per 100,000 for\nfemale participants. When looking at regions, central Asia had the highest\ndeath rate for stroke linked to non-optimal temperatures with 18 per 100,000.\nAt the national level, North Macedonia had the highest death rate with 33 per\n100,000. \u201cMore research is needed to determine the impact of temperature\nchange on stroke and to target solutions to address health inequalities,\u201d\nCheng said. \u201cFuture research should aim to reduce this threat by finding\neffective health policies that address potential causes of climate change,\nsuch as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial processes.\u201d\nThe study was supported by Hunan Youth Science and Technology Talent Project.\nLearn more about stroke at BrainandLife.org, home of the American Academy of\nNeurology\u2019s free patient and caregiver magazine focused on the intersection of\nneurologic disease and brain health.
