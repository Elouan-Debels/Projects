As a\nconsequence, the security properties have to be re-proven under a KEM-based\nsecurity notion.\n\nWe initiate the study of the LDACS key agreement protocol (Edition 01.01.00\nfrom 25.04.2023), which is soon-to-be-standardized by the International Civil\nAviation Organization. The protocol's cipher suite features Diffie-Hellman as\nwell as a KEM-based key agreement protocol to provide post-quantum security.\nWhile the former results in an instantiation of an ISO key agreement\ninheriting all security properties, the security achieved by the latter is\nambiguous. We formalize the computational security using the systematic\nnotions of de Saint Guilhem, Fischlin and Warinshi (CSF '20), and prove the\nexact security that the KEM-based variant achieves in this model; primarily\nentity authentication, key secrecy and key authentication. To further\nstrengthen our \u201cpen-and-paper\u201d findings, we model the protocol and its\nsecurity guarantees using Tamarin, providing an automated proof of the\nsecurity against a Dolev-Yao attacker.\n\n##### On the Efficiency of Generic, Quantum Cryptographic Constructions\n\nKeita Xagawa\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nOne of the central questions in cryptology is how efficient generic\nconstructions of cryptographic primitives can be. Gennaro, Gertner, Katz, and\nTrevisan [SIAM J. of Compt., 2005] studied the lower bounds of the number of\ninvocations of a (trapdoor) one-way permutation in order to construct\ncryptographic schemes, e.g., pseudorandom number generators, digital\nsignatures, and public-key and symmetric-key encryption.\n\nRecently, quantum machines have been explored to _construct_ cryptographic\nprimitives other than quantum key distribution. This paper studies the\nefficiency of _quantum_ black-box constructions of cryptographic primitives\nwhen the communications are _classical_. Following Gennaro et al., we give the\nlower bounds of the number of invocations of an underlying quantumly-\ncomputable quantum-one-way permutation when the _quantum_ construction of\npseudorandom number generator and symmetric-key encryption is weakly black-\nbox. Our results show that the quantum black-box constructions of pseudorandom\nnumber generator and symmetric-key encryption do not improve the number of\ninvocations of an underlying quantumly-computable quantum-one-way permutation.\n\n##### Secure Multi-Party Linear Algebra with Perfect Correctness\n\nJules Maire, Damien Vergnaud\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nWe present new secure multi-party computation protocols for linear algebra\nover a finite field, which improve the state-of-the-art in terms of security.\nWe look at the case of unconditional security with perfect correctness, i.e.,\ninformation-theoretic security without errors. We notably propose an expected\nconstant-round protocol for solving systems of m linear equations in n\nvariables over Fq with expected complexity O(k n^2.5 + k m) (where complexity\nis measured in terms of the number of secure multiplications required) with k\n> m(m+n)+1. The previous proposals were not error-free: known protocols can\nindeed fail and thus reveal information with probability Omega(poly(m)/q). Our\nprotocols are simple and rely on existing computer-algebra techniques, notably\nthe Preparata-Sarwate algorithm, a simple but poorly known \u201cbaby-step giant-\nstep\u201d method for computing the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, and\ntechniques due to Mulmuley for error-free linear algebra in positive\ncharacteristic.\n\n##### Preliminary Cryptanalysis of the Biscuit Signature Scheme\n\nCharles Bouillaguet, Julia Sauvage\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nBiscuit is a recent multivariate signature scheme based on the MPC-in-the-Head\nparadigm. It has been submitted to the NIST competition for additional\nsignature schemes. Signatures are derived from a zero-knowledge proof of\nknowledge of the solution of a structured polynomial system. This extra\nstructure enables efficient proofs and compact signatures. This short note\ndemonstrates that it also makes these polynomial systems easier to solve than\nrandom ones. As a consequence, the original parameters of Biscuit failed to\nmeet the required security levels and had to be upgraded.\n\n##### X-Wing The Hybrid KEM You've Been Looking For\n\nManuel Barbosa, Deirdre Connolly, Jo\u00e3o Diogo Duarte, Aaron Kaiser, Peter\nSchwabe, Karolin Varner, Bas Westerbaan\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nX-Wing is a hybrid key-encapsulation mechanism based on X25519 and ML-KEM-768.\nIt is designed to be the sensible choice for most applications. The concrete\nchoice of X25519 and ML-KEM-768 allows X-Wing to achieve improved efficiency\ncompared to using a generic KEM combiner. In this paper, we introduce the\nX-Wing hybrid KEM construction and provide a proof of security. We show (1)\nthat X-Wing is a classically IND-CCA secure KEM if the strong Diffie-Hellman\nassumption holds in the X25519 nominal group, and (2) that X-Wing is a post-\nquantum IND-CCA secure KEM if ML-KEM-768 is itself an IND-CCA secure KEM and\nSHA3-256 is secure when used as a pseudorandom function. The first result is\nproved in the ROM, whereas the second one holds in the standard model. Loosely\nspeaking, this means X-Wing is secure if either X25519 or ML-KEM-768 is\nsecure. We stress that these security guarantees and optimizations are only\npossible due to the concrete choices that were made, and it may not apply in\nthe general case.\n\n##### Simple Three-Round Multiparty Schnorr Signing with Full Simulatability\n\nYehuda Lindell\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nIn a multiparty signing protocol, also known as a threshold signature scheme,\nthe private signing key is shared amongst a set of parties and only a quorum\nof those parties can generate a signature. Research on multiparty signing has\nbeen growing in popularity recently due to its application to\ncryptocurrencies. Most work has focused on reducing the number of rounds to\ntwo, and as a result: (a) are not fully simulatable in the sense of MPC\nreal/ideal security definitions, and/or (b) are not secure under concurrent\ncomposition, and/or (c) utilize non-standard assumptions of different types in\ntheir proofs of security. In this paper, we describe a simple three-round\nmultiparty protocol for Schnorr signatures that is secure for any number of\ncorrupted parties; i.e., in the setting of a dishonest majority. The protocol\nis fully simulatable, secure under concurrent composition, and proven secure\nin the standard model or random-oracle model (depending on the instantiations\nof the commitment and zero-knowledge primitives). The protocol realizes an\nideal Schnorr signing functionality with perfect security in the ideal\ncommitment and zero-knowledge hybrid model (and thus the only assumptions\nneeded are for realizing these functionalities).\n\nIn our presentation, we do not assume that all parties begin with the message\nto be signed, the identities of the participating parties and a unique common\nsession identifier, since this is often not the case in practice. Rather, the\nparties achieve consensus on these parameters as the protocol progresses.\n\n##### A Prime-Order Group with Complete Formulas from Even-Order Elliptic\nCurves\n\nThomas Pornin\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nThis paper describes a generic methodology for obtaining unified, and then\ncomplete formulas for a prime-order group abstraction homomorphic to a\nsubgroup of an elliptic curve with even order. The method is applicable to any\ncurve with even order, in finite fields of both even and odd characteristic;\nit is most efficient on curves with order equal to 2 modulo 4, dubbed \"double-\nodd curves\". In large characteristic fields, we obtain doubling formulas with\ncost as low as 1M + 5S, and the resulting group allows building schemes such\nas signatures that outperform existing fast solutions, e.g. Ed25519. In binary\nfields, the obtained formulas are not only complete but also faster than\npreviously known incomplete formulas; we can sign and verify in as low as 18k\nand 27k cycles on x86 CPUs, respectively.\n\n##### Impossibility of Post-Quantum Shielding Black-Box Constructions of CCA\nfrom CPA\n\nLo\u00efs Huguenin-Dumittan, Serge Vaudenay\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nProving whether it is possible to build IND-CCA public-key encryption (PKE)\nfrom IND-CPA PKE in a black-box manner is a major open problem in theoretical\ncryptography. In a significant breakthrough, Gertner, Malkin and Myers showed\nin 2007 that shielding black-box reductions from IND-CCA to IND-CPA do not\nexist in the standard model. Shielding means that the decryption algorithm of\nthe IND-CCA scheme does not call the encryption algorithm of the underlying\nIND-CPA scheme. In other words, it implies that every tentative construction\nof IND-CCA from IND-CPA must have a re-encryption step when decrypting.\n\nThis result was only proven with respect to classical algorithms. In this work\nwe show that it stands in a post-quantum setting. That is, we prove that there\nis no post-quantum shielding black-box construction of IND-CCA PKE from IND-\nCPA PKE. In the type of reductions we consider, i.e. post-quantum ones, the\nconstructions are still classical in the sense that the schemes must be\ncomputable on classical computers, but the adversaries and the reduction\nalgorithm can be quantum. This suggests that considering quantum notions,\nwhich are stronger than their classical counterparts, and allowing for quantum\nreductions does not make building IND-CCA public-key encryption easier.\n\n##### On the Two-sided Permutation Inversion Problem\n\nGorjan Alagic, Chen Bai, Alexander Poremba, Kaiyan Shi\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nIn the permutation inversion problem, the task is to find the preimage of some\nchallenge value, given oracle access to the permutation. This fundamental\nproblem in query complexity appears in many contexts, particularly\ncryptography. In this work, we examine the setting in which the oracle allows\nfor quantum queries to both the forward and the inverse direction of the\npermutation\u2014except that the challenge value cannot be submitted to the latter.\nWithin that setting, we consider three options for the inversion algorithm:\nwhether it can get quantum advice about the permutation, whether the query\nalgorithm can restrict the distribution with which the challenge input is\nsampled, and whether it must produce the entire preimage (search) or only the\nfirst bit (decision). We prove several theorems connecting the hardness of the\nresulting variations of the permutation inversion problem and establish lower\nbounds for them. Our results show that, perhaps surprisingly, the permutation\ninversion problem does not become significantly easier when the adversary is\ngranted oracle access to the inverse\u2014provided it cannot query the challenge\nitself.\n\n##### Survey: Recovering cryptographic keys from partial information, by\nexample\n\nGabrielle De Micheli, Nadia Heninger\n\nSoK paper Show abstract PDF\n\nSide-channel attacks targeting cryptography may leak only partial or indirect\ninformation about the secret keys. There are a variety of techniques in the\nliterature for recovering secret keys from partial information. In this work,\nwe survey several of the main families of partial key recovery algorithms for\nRSA, (EC)DSA, and (elliptic curve) Diffie-Hellman, the classical public-key\ncryptosystems in common use today. We categorize the known techniques by the\nstructure of the information that is learned by the attacker, and give\nsimplified examples for each technique to illustrate the underlying ideas.\n\n##### Differential-Linear Cryptanalysis of GIFT family and GIFT-based Ciphers\n\nShichang Wang, Meicheng Liu, Shiqi Hou, Dongdai Lin\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nAt CHES 2017, Banik et al. proposed a lightweight block cipher GIFT consisting\nof two versions GIFT-64 and GIFT-128. Recently, there are lots of\nauthenticated encryption schemes that adopt GIFT-128 as their underlying\nprimitive, such as GIFT-COFB and HyENA. To promote a comprehensive perception\nof the soundness of the designs, we evaluate their security against\ndifferential-linear cryptanalysis.\n\nFor this, automatic tools have been developed to search differential-linear\napproximation for the ciphers based on S-boxes. With the assistance of the\nautomatic tools, we find 13-round differential-linear approximations for GIFT-\nCOFB and HyENA. Based on the distinguishers, 18-round key-recovery attacks are\ngiven for the message processing phase and initialization phase of both\nciphers. Moreover, the resistance of GIFT-64/128 against differential-linear\ncryptanalysis is also evaluated. The 12-round and 17-round differential-linear\napproximations are found for GIFT-64 and GIFT-128 respectively, which lead to\n18-round and 19-round key-recovery attacks respectively. Here, we stress that\nour attacks do not threaten the security of these ciphers.\n\n##### Fast polynomial multiplication using matrix multiplication accelerators\nwith applications to NTRU on Apple M1/M3 SoCs\n\nD\u00e9cio Luiz Gazzoni Filho, Guilherme Brand\u00e3o, Julio L\u00f3pez\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nEfficient polynomial multiplication routines are critical to the performance\nof lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC). As PQC standards only\nrecently started to emerge, CPUs still lack specialized instructions to\naccelerate such routines. Meanwhile, deep learning has grown immeasurably in\nimportance. Its workloads call for teraflops-level of processing power for\nlinear algebra operations, mainly matrix multiplication. Computer architects\nhave responded by introducing ISA extensions, coprocessors and special-purpose\ncores to accelerate such operations. In particular, Apple ships an\nundocumented matrix-multiplication coprocessor, AMX, in hundreds of millions\nof mobile phones, tablets and personal computers. Our work repurposes AMX to\nimplement polynomial multiplication and applies it to the NTRU cryptosystem,\nsetting new speed records on the Apple M1 and M3 systems-on-chip (SoCs):\npolynomial multiplication, key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation are\nsped up by \u2013, \u2013, \u2013 and \u2013, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art.\n\n##### Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing for a Dishonest Majority\n\nYi-Hsiu Chen, Yehuda Lindell\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nVerifiable secret sharing (VSS) protocols enable parties to share secrets\nwhile guaranteeing security (in particular, that all parties hold valid and\nconsistent shares) even if the dealer or some of the participants are\nmalicious. Most work on VSS focuses on the honest majority case, primarily\nsince it enables one to guarantee output delivery (e.g., a corrupted recipient\ncannot prevent an honest dealer from sharing their value). Feldman's VSS is a\nwell known and popular protocol for this task and relies on the discrete log\nhardness assumption. In this paper, we present a variant of Feldman's VSS for\nthe dishonest majority setting and formally prove its security. Beyond the\nbasic VSS protocol, we present a publicly-verifiable version, as well as show\nhow to securely add participants to the sharing and how to refresh an existing\nsharing (all secure in the presence of a dishonest majority). We prove that\nour protocols are UC secure, for appropriately defined ideal functionalities.\n\n##### Towards Practical Transciphering for FHE with Setup Independent of the\nPlaintext Space\n\nPierrick M\u00e9aux, Jeongeun Park, Hilder V. L. Pereira\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful tool to achieve non-\ninteractive privacy preserving protocols with optimal\ncomputation/communication complexity. However, the main disadvantage is that\nthe actual communication cost (bandwidth) is high due to the large size of FHE\nciphertexts. As a solution, a technique called transciphering (also known as\nHybrid Homomorphic Encryption) was introduced to achieve almost optimal\nbandwidth for such protocols. However, all existing works require clients to\nfix a precision for the messages or a mathematical structure for the message\nspace beforehand. It results in unwanted constraints on the plaintext size or\nunderlying structure of FHE based applications.\n\nIn this article, we introduce a new approach for transciphering which does not\nrequire fixed message precision decided by the client, for the first time. In\nmore detail, a client uses any kind of FHE-friendly symmetric cipher for to\nsend its input data encrypted bit-by-bit, then the server can choose a\nprecision depending on the application and homomorphically transforms the\nencrypted bits into FHE ciphertexts encrypting integers in . To illustrate our\nnew technique, we evaluate a transciphering using FiLIP cipher and adapt the\nmost practical homomorphic evaluation technique [CCS'22] to keep the practical\nlatency. As a result, our proof-of-concept implementation for from to takes\nonly from ms to ms.\n\n##### Computing isogenies between finite Drinfeld modules\n\nBenjamin Wesolowski\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nWe prove that isogenies between Drinfeld F[x]-modules over a finite field can\nbe computed in polynomial time. This breaks Drinfeld analogs of isogeny-based\ncryptosystems.\n\n##### Proximity Testing with Logarithmic Randomness\n\nBenjamin E. Diamond, Jim Posen\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nA fundamental result dating to Ligero (Des. Codes Cryptogr. '23) establishes\nthat each fixed linear block code exhibits proximity gaps with respect to the\ncollection of affine subspaces, in the sense that each given subspace either\nresides entirely close to the code, or else contains only a small portion\nwhich resides close to the code. In particular, any given subspace's failure\nto reside entirely close to the code is necessarily witnessed, with high\nprobability, by a uniformly randomly sampled element of that subspace. We\ninvestigate a variant of this phenomenon in which the witness is not sampled\nuniformly from the subspace, but rather from a much smaller subset of it. We\nshow that a logarithmic number of random field elements (in the dimension of\nthe subspace) suffice to effect an analogous proximity test, with moreover\nonly a logarithmic (multiplicative) loss in the possible prevalence of false\nwitnesses. We discuss applications to recent noninteractive proofs based on\nlinear codes, including Brakedown (CRYPTO '23).\n\n##### New SAT-based Model for Quantum Circuit Decision Problem: Searching for\nLow-Cost Quantum Implementation\n\nJingwen Chen, Qun Liu, Yanhong Fan, Lixuan Wu, Boyun Li, Meiqin Wang\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nIn recent years, quantum technology has been rapidly developed. As security\nanalyses for symmetric ciphers continue to emerge, many require an evaluation\nof the resources needed for the quantum circuit implementation of the\nencryption algorithm. In this regard, we propose the quantum circuit decision\nproblem, which requires us to determine whether there exists a quantum circuit\nfor a given permutation f using M ancilla qubits and no more than K quantum\ngates within the circuit depth D. Firstly, we investigate heuristic algorithms\nand classical SAT-based models in previous works, revealing their limitations\nin solving the problem. Hence, we innovatively propose an improved SAT-based\nmodel incorporating three metrics of quantum circuits. The model enables us to\nfind the optimal quantum circuit of an arbitrary 3 or 4-bit S-box under a\ngiven optimization goal based on SAT solvers, which has proved the optimality\nof circuits constructed by the tool, LIGHTER-R. Then, by combining different\ncriteria in the model, we find more compact quantum circuit implementations of\nS-boxes such as RECTANGLE and GIFT. For GIFT S-box, our model provides the\noptimal quantum circuit that only requires 8 gates with a depth of 31.\nFurthermore, our model can be generalized to linear layers and improve the\nprevious SAT-based model proposed by Huang et al. in ASIACRYPT 2022 by adding\nthe criteria on the number of qubits and the circuit depth.\n\n##### New Attacks on LowMC Using Partial Sets in the Single-Data Setting\n\nSubhadeep Banik, Andrea Caforio, Serge Vaudenay\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nThe LowMC family of block ciphers was proposed by Albrecht et al. in Eurocrypt\n2015, specifically targeting adoption in FHE and MPC applications due to its\nlow multiplicative complexity. The construction operates a 3-bit quadratic\nS-box as the sole non-linear transformation in the algorithm. In contrast,\nboth the linear layer and round key generation are achieved through\nmultiplications of full rank matrices over GF(2). The cipher is instantiable\nusing a diverse set of default configurations, some of which have partial non-\nlinear layers i.e., in which the S-boxes are not applied over the entire\ninternal state of the cipher.\n\nThe significance of cryptanalysing LowMC was elevated by its inclusion into\nthe NIST PQC digital signature scheme PICNIC in which a successful key\nrecovery using a single plaintext/ciphertext pair is akin to retrieving the\nsecret signing key. The current state-of-the-art attack in this setting is due\nto Dinur at Eurocrypt 2021, in which a novel way of enumerating roots of a\nBoolean system of equation is morphed into a key-recovery procedure that\nundercuts an ordinary exhaustive search in terms of time complexity for the\nvariants of the cipher up to five rounds.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate that this technique can efficiently be enriched\nwith a specific linearization strategy that reduces the algebraic degree of\nthe non-linear layer as put forward by Banik et al. at IACR ToSC 2020(4). This\namalgamation yields new attacks on certain instances of LowMC up to seven\nrounds.\n\n##### Simple Two-Message OT in the Explicit Isogeny Model\n\nEmmanuela Orsini, Riccardo Zanotto\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nIn this work we study algebraic and generic models for group actions, and\nextend them to the universal composability (UC) framework of Canetti (FOCS\n2001). We revisit the constructions of Duman et al. (PKC 2023) integrating the\ntype-safe model by Zhandry (Crypto 2022), adapted to the group action setting,\nand formally define an algebraic action model (AAM). This model restricts the\npower of the adversary in a similar fashion to the algebraic group model\n(AGM). By imposing algebraic behaviour to the adversary and environment of the\nUC framework, we construct the UC-AAM. Finally, we instantiate UC-AAM with\nisogeny-based assumptions, in particular the CSIDH action with twists,\nobtaining the explicit isogeny model, UC-EI; we observe that, under certain\nassumptions, this model is \"closer\" to standard UC than the UC-AGM, even\nthough there still exists an important separation. We demonstrate the utility\nof our definitions by proving UC-EI security for the passive-secure oblivious\ntransfer protocol described by Lai et al. (Eurocrypt 2021), hence providing\nthe first concretely efficient two-message isogeny-based OT protocol in the\nrandom oracle model against malicious adversaries.\n\n##### Bit Security as Cost to Demonstrate Advantage\n\nKeewoo Lee\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nWe revisit the question of what the definition of bit security should be,\npreviously answered by Micciancio-Walter (Eurocrypt 2018) and Watanabe-\nYasunaga (Asiacrypt 2021). Our new definition is simple, but (i) captures both\nsearch and decision primitives in a single framework like Micciancio-Walter,\nand (ii) has a firm operational meaning like Watanabe-Yasunaga. It also\nmatches intuitive expectations and can be well-formulated regarding Hellinger\ndistance. To support and justify the new definition, we prove several classic\nsecurity reductions with respect to our bit security. We also provide\npathological examples that indicate the ill-definedness of bit security\ndefined in Micciancio-Walter and Watanabe-Yasunaga.\n\n##### Computing 2-isogenies between Kummer lines\n\nDamien Robert, Nicolas Sarkis\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nWe use theta groups to study -isogenies between Kummer lines, with a\nparticular focus on the Montgomery model. This allows us to recover known\nformulas, along with more efficient forms for translated isogenies, which\nrequire only for evaluation. We leverage these translated isogenies to build a\nhybrid ladder for scalar multiplication on Montgomery curves with rational\n-torsion, which cost per bit, compared to for the standard Montgomery ladder.\n\n##### A provably masked implementation of BIKE Key Encapsulation Mechanism\n\nLo\u00efc Demange, M\u00e9lissa Rossi\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nBIKE is a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) selected for the 4th\nround of the NIST's standardization campaign. It relies on the hardness of the\nsyndrome decoding problem for quasi-cyclic codes and on the\nindistinguishability of the public key from a random element, and provides the\nmost competitive performance among round 4 candidates, which makes it relevant\nfor future real-world use cases. Analyzing its side-channel resistance has\nbeen highly encouraged by the community and several works have already\noutlined various side-channel weaknesses and proposed ad-hoc countermeasures.\nHowever, in contrast to the well-documented research line on masking lattice-\nbased algorithms, the possibility of generically protecting code-based\nalgorithms by masking has only been marginally studied in a 2016 paper by Chen\net al. in SAC 2015. At this stage of the standardization campaign, it is\nimportant to assess the possibility of fully masking BIKE scheme and the\nresulting cost in terms of performances.\n\nIn this work, we provide the first high-order masked implementation of a code-\nbased algorithm. We had to tackle many issues such as finding proper ways to\nhandle large sparse polynomials, masking the key-generation algorithm or\nkeeping the benefit of the bitslicing. In this paper, we present all the\ngadgets necessary to provide a fully masked implementation of BIKE, we discuss\nour different implementation choices and we propose a full proof of masking in\nthe Ishai Sahai and Wagner (Crypto 2003) model.\n\nMore practically, we also provide an open C-code masked implementation of the\nkey-generation, encapsulation and decapsulation algorithms with extensive\nbenchmarks. While the obtained performance is slower than existing masked\nlattice-based algorithms, we show that masking at order 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5\nimplies a performance penalty of x5.8, x14.2, x24.4, x38 and x55.6 compared to\norder 0 (unmasked and unoptimized BIKE). This scaling is encouraging and no\nBoolean to Arithmetic conversion has been used.\n\n##### Understanding binary-Goppa decoding\n\nDaniel J. Bernstein\n\nSoK paper Show abstract PDF\n\nThis paper reviews, from bottom to top, a polynomial-time algorithm to correct\nerrors in classical binary Goppa codes defined by squarefree degree-\npolynomials. The proof is factored through a proof of a simple Reed\u2013Solomon\ndecoder, and the algorithm is simpler than Patterson's algorithm. All\nalgorithm layers are expressed as Sage scripts backed by test scripts. All\ntheorems are formally verified. The paper also covers the use of decoding\ninside the Classic McEliece cryptosystem, including reliable recognition of\nvalid inputs.\n\n##### Using Predicate Extension for Predicate Encryption to Generically Obtain\nChosen-Ciphertext Security and Signatures\n\nMarloes Venema, Leon Botros\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nPredicate encryption (PE) is a type of public-key encryption that captures\nmany useful primitives such as attribute-based encryption (ABE). Although much\nprogress has been made to generically achieve security against chosen-\nplaintext attacks (CPA) efficiently, in practice, we also require security\nagainst chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA). Because achieving CCA-security on a\ncase-by-case basis is a complicated task, several generic conversion methods\nhave been proposed, which typically target different subclasses of PE such as\nciphertext-policy ABE. As is common, such conversion methods may sacrifice\nsome efficiency. Notably, for ciphertext-policy ABE, all proposed generic\ntransformations incur a significant decryption overhead. Furthermore,\ndepending on the setting in which PE is used, we may also want to require that\nmessages are signed. To do this, predicate signature schemes can be used.\nHowever, such schemes provide a strong notion of privacy for the signer, which\nmay be stronger than necessary for some practical settings at the cost of\nefficiency.\n\nIn this work, we propose the notion of predicate extension, which transforms\nthe predicate used in a PE scheme to include one additional attribute, in both\nthe keys and the ciphertexts. Using predicate extension, we can generically\nobtain CCA-security and signatures from a CPA-secure PE scheme. For the CCA-\nsecurity transform, we observe that predicate extension implies a two-step\napproach to achieving CCA-security. This insight broadens the applicability of\nexisting transforms for specific subclasses of PE to cover all PE. We also\npropose a new transform that incurs slightly less overhead than existing\ntransforms. Furthermore, we show that predicate extension allows us to create\na new type of signatures, which we call PE-based signatures. PE-based\nsignatures are weaker than typical predicate signatures in the sense that they\ndo not provide privacy for the signer. Nevertheless, such signatures may be\nmore suitable for some practical settings owing to their efficiency or reduced\ninteractivity. Lastly, to show that predicate extensions may facilitate a more\nefficient way to achieve CCA-security generically than existing methods, we\npropose a novel predicate-extension transformation for a large class of\npairing-based PE, covered by the pair and predicate encodings frameworks. In\nparticular, this yields the most efficient generic CCA-conversion for\nciphertext-policy ABE.\n\n##### CCA Security with Short AEAD Tags\n\nMustafa Khairallah\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nThe size of the authentication tag represents a significant overhead for\napplications that are limited by bandwidth or memory. Hence, some\nauthenticated encryption designs have a smaller tag than the required privacy\nlevel, which was also suggested by the NIST lightweight cryptography\nstandardization project. In the ToSC 2022, two papers have raised questions\nabout the IND-CCA security of AEAD schemes in this situation. These papers\nshow that (a) online AE cannot provide IND-CCA security beyond the tag length,\nand (b) it is possible to have IND-CCA security beyond the tag length in a\nrestricted Encode-then-Encipher framework. In this paper, we address some of\nthe remaining gaps in this area. Our main result is to show that, for a fixed\nstretch, Pseudo-Random Injection security implies IND-CCA security as long as\nthe minimum ciphertext size is at least as large as the required IND-CCA\nsecurity level. We also show that this bound is tight and that any AEAD scheme\nthat allows empty plaintexts with a fixed stretch cannot achieve IND-CCA\nsecurity beyond the tag length. Next, we look at the weaker notion of MRAE\nsecurity, and show that two-pass schemes that achieve MRAE security do not\nachieve IND-CCA security beyond the tag size. This includes SIV and rugged\nPRPs.\n\n##### Verifiable Encryption from MPC-in-the-Head\n\nAkira Takahashi, Greg Zaverucha\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nVerifiable encryption (VE) is a protocol where one can provide assurance that\nan encrypted plaintext satisfies certain properties, or relations. It is an\nimportant building block in cryptography with many useful applications, such\nas key escrow, group signatures, optimistic fair exchange, and others.\nHowever, the majority of previous VE schemes are restricted to instantiation\nwith specific public-key encryption schemes or relations. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that realizes VE protocols using zero-knowledge\nproof systems based on the MPC-in-the-head paradigm (Ishai et al. STOC 2007).\nOur generic compiler can turn a large class of zero-knowledge proofs into\nsecure VE protocols for any secure public-key encryption scheme with the\nundeniability property, a notion that essentially guarantees binding of\nencryption when used as a commitment scheme. Our framework is versatile:\nbecause the circuit proven by the MPC-in-the-head prover is decoupled from a\ncomplex encryption function, the work of the prover is focused on proving the\nencrypted data satisfies the relation, not the proof of plaintext knowledge.\nHence, our approach allows for instantiation with various combinations of\nproperties about the encrypted data and encryption functions. We then consider\nconcrete applications, to demonstrate the efficiency of our framework, by\nfirst giving a new approach and implementation to verifiably encrypt discrete\nlogarithms in any prime order group more efficiently than was previously\nknown. Then we give the first practical verifiable encryption scheme for AES\nkeys with post-quantum security, along with an implementation and benchmarks.\n\n##### Verifiable FHE via Lattice-based SNARKs\n\nShahla Atapoor, Karim Baghery, Hilder V. L. Pereira, Jannik Spiessens\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a prevalent cryptographic primitive that\nallows for computation on encrypted data. In various cryptographic protocols,\nthis enables outsourcing computation to a third party while retaining the\nprivacy of the inputs to the computation. However, these schemes make an\nhonest-but-curious assumption about the adversary. Previous work has tried to\nremove this assumption by combining FHE with Verifiable Computation (VC).\nRecent work has increased the flexibility of this approach by introducing\nintegrity checks for homomorphic computations over rings. However, efficient\nFHE for circuits of large multiplicative depth also requires non-ring\ncomputations called maintenance operations, i.e. modswitching and\nkeyswitching, which cannot be efficiently verified by existing constructions.\nWe propose the first efficiently verifiable FHE scheme that allows for\narbitrary depth homomorphic circuits by utilizing the double-CRT\nrepresentation in which FHE schemes are typically computed, and using lattice-\nbased SNARKs to prove components of this computation separately, including the\nmaintenance operations. Therefore, our construction can theoretically handle\nbootstrapping operations. We also present the first implementation of a\nverifiable computation on encrypted data for a computation that contains\nmultiple ciphertext-ciphertext multiplications. Concretely, we verify the\nhomomorphic computation of an approximate neural network containing three\nlayers and >100 ciphertexts in less than 1 second while maintaining reasonable\nprover costs.\n\n##### Broadcast Encryption using Sum-Product decomposition of Boolean\nfunctions\n\nAur\u00e9lien Dupin, Simon Abelard\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nThe problem of Broadcast Encryption (BE) consists in broadcasting an encrypted\nmessage to a large number of users or receiving devices in such a way that the\nemitter of the message can control which of the users can or cannot decrypt\nit.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the design of BE schemes has received significant\ninterest and many different concepts were proposed. A major breakthrough was\nachieved by Naor, Naor and Lotspiech (CRYPTO 2001) by partitioning cleverly\nthe set of authorized users and associating a symmetric key to each subset.\nSince then, while there have been many advances in public-key based BE\nschemes, mostly based on bilinear maps, little was made on symmetric\ncryptography.\n\nIn this paper, we design a new symmetric-based BE scheme, named BE, that\nrelies on logic optimization and consensual security assumptions. It is\ncompetitive with the work of Naor et al. and provides a different tradeoff:\nthe bandwidth requirement is significantly lowered at the cost of an increase\nin the key storage.\n\n##### How to Make Rational Arguments Practical and Extractable\n\nMatteo Campanelli, Chaya Ganesh, Rosario Gennaro\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nWe investigate proof systems where security holds against rational parties\ninstead of malicious ones. Our starting point is the notion of rational\narguments, a variant of rational proofs (Azar and Micali, STOC 2012) where\nsecurity holds against rational adversaries that are also computationally\nbounded.\n\nRational arguments are an interesting primitive because they generally allow\nfor very efficient protocols, and in particular sublinear verification (i.e.\nwhere the Verifier does not have to read the entire input). In this paper we\naim at narrowing the gap between literature on rational schemes and real world\napplications. Our contribution is two-fold.\n\nWe provide the first construction of rational arguments for the class of\npolynomial computations that is practical (i.e., it can be applied to real-\nworld computations on reasonably common hardware) and with logarithmic\ncommunication. Techniques-wise, we obtain this result through a compiler from\ninformation-theoretic protocols and rational proofs for polynomial evaluation.\nThe latter could be of independent interest.\n\nAs a second contribution, we propose a new notion of extractability for\nrational arguments. Through this notion we can obtain arguments where\nknowledge of a witness is incentivized (rather than incentivizing mere\nsoundness). We show how our aforementioned compiler can also be applied to\nobtain efficient extractable rational arguments for .\n\n##### A Survey of Two Verifiable Delay Functions Using Proof of Exponentiation\n\nDan Boneh, Benedikt B\u00fcnz, Ben Fisch\n\nSoK paper Show abstract PDF\n\nA verifiable delay function (VDF) is an important tool used for adding delay\nin decentralized applications. This paper surveys and compares two beautiful\nverifiable delay functions, one due to Pietrzak, and the other due to\nWesolowski, In addition, we provide a new computational proof of security for\none of them, present an attack on an incorrect implementation of the other,\nand compare the complexity assumptions needed for both schemes.\n\n##### Optimizations and Practicality of High-Security CSIDH\n\nFabio Campos, Jorge Ch\u00e1vez-Saab, Jes\u00fas-Javier Chi-Dom\u00ednguez, Michael Meyer,\nKrijn Reijnders, Francisco Rodr\u00edguez-Henr\u00edquez, Peter Schwabe, Thom Wiggers\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nIn this work, we assess the real-world practicality of CSIDH, an isogeny-based\nnon-interactive key exchange. We provide the first thorough assessment of the\npracticality of CSIDH in higher parameter sizes for conservative estimates of\nquantum security, and with protection against physical attacks.\n\nThis requires a three-fold analysis of CSIDH. First, we describe two\napproaches to efficient high-security CSIDH implementations, based on SQALE\nand CTIDH. Second, we optimize such high-security implementations, on a high\nlevel by improving several subroutines, and on a low level by improving the\nfinite field arithmetic. Third, we benchmark the performance of high-security\nCSIDH. As a stand-alone primitive, our implementations outperform previous\nresults by a factor up to 2.53\u00d7.\n\nAs a real-world use case considering network protocols, we use CSIDH in TLS\nvariants that allow early authentication through a NIKE. Although our\ninstantiations of CSIDH have smaller communication requirements than post-\nquantum KEM and signature schemes, even our highly-optimized implementations\nresult in too-large handshake latency (tens of seconds), showing that CSIDH is\nonly practical in niche cases.\n\n##### Towards the Impossibility of Quantum Public Key Encryption with\nClassical Keys from One-Way Functions\n\nSamuel Bouaziz\u2013Ermann, Alex B. Grilo, Damien Vergnaud, Quoc-Huy Vu\n\nResearch paper Show abstract PDF\n\nThere has been a recent interest in proposing quantum protocols whose security\nrelies on weaker computational assumptions than their classical counterparts.\nImportantly to our work, it has been recently shown that public-key encryption\n(PKE) from one-way functions (OWF) is possible if we consider quantum public\nkeys. Notice that we do not expect classical PKE from OWF given the\nimpossibility results of Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC'89).\n\nHowever, the distribution of quantum public keys is a challenging task.\nTherefore, the main question that motivates our work is if quantum PKE from\nOWF is possible if we have classical public keys. Such protocols are\nimpossible if ciphertexts are also classical, given the impossibility result\nof Austrin et al.(CRYPTO'22) of quantum enhanced key-agreement (KA) with\nclassical communication.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on black-box separation for PKE with classical public\nkey and quantum ciphertext from OWF under the polynomial compatibility\nconjecture, first introduced in Austrin et al.. More precisely, we show the\nseparation when the decryption algorithm of the PKE does not query the OWF. We\nprove our result by extending the techniques of Austrin et al. and we show an\nattack for KA in an extended classical communication model where the last\nmessage in the protocol can be a quantum state.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 by the IACR International Association for Cryptologic\nResearch \u2022 Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
