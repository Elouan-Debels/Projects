Her writing has\nappeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post Magazine,\nThe New Republic, and other publications. Her previous Atavist story,\n\u201cMasterpiece Theater,\u201d was published as Issue No. 94.\n\nEditor: Seyward Darby Art Director: Ed Johnson Copy Editor: Sean Cooper Fact\nChecker: Darya Marchenkova Illustrator: James Lee Chiahan\n\nPublished in May 2023.\n\n\u201cThe quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from\nheaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed: It blesseth him that gives\nand him that takes.\u201d\n\n\u2014William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice\n\nIt was February 2019, and Mary Price had rarely seen her office so busy. A\nwiry woman in her sixties with shoulder-length straight hair, Price is general\ncounsel at FAMM, a nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C. FAMM is an\nacronym for Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and in addition to opposing\nsevere sentencing, the group broadly advocates for the fair treatment of\npeople in prisons across the United States. FAMM had recently sent out an\nedition of its newsletter, which supporters knew as the \u201cFAMM Gram.\u201d The\nresponse from readers began as a trickle, then became overwhelming, and for\ngood reason: The newsletter outlined historic changes to the U.S. government\u2019s\ncompassionate release process.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, federal prisoners have been able to seek compassionate\nrelease for what the law deems \u201cextraordinary and compelling\nreasons\u201d\u2014including old age, terminal illness, and severe disability\u2014by\nrequesting that the Bureau of Prisons file a motion on their behalf in court.\nThe BOP, however, rejects almost every request it receives. In January 2018,\nthe Department of Justice reported that the BOP had approved less than 10\npercent of the compassionate release applications it received over the\nprevious four years, allowing just 306 people to go home. (Within the same\ntime frame, 81 prisoners died waiting for the BOP to respond at all.) The\nDOJ\u2019s Office of the Inspector General called the process \u201cpoorly managed,\u201d\nwith \u201cinconsistent and ad hoc implementation [that] has likely resulted in\npotentially eligible inmates not being considered for release.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, when the BOP denied a request, a prisoner had no recourse;\nthe bureau\u2019s decision was the final word. That changed in December 2018,\nfollowing years of advocacy by FAMM and other groups, when Congress passed the\nFirst Step Act. Among other criminal-justice reforms, the law allowed a\nprisoner to file a motion for compassionate release directly with a federal\njudge if the BOP denied their request or didn\u2019t respond to it within 30 days\nof receipt. FAMM was eager to share the news and connect eligible individuals\nwith lawyers who could help them. Price knew the organization had to move\nquickly. \u201cWe were very concerned that people who were nearing the end of their\nlives or very sick would be going before judges without any help,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t just leave these people on their own.\u201d\n\nFAMM\u2019s newsletter was delivered to 40,000 incarcerated individuals via\nCorrLinks, the federal prison system\u2019s email service. Price felt a thrill of\nanticipation\u2014\u201ca sense of stepping off into something that was unknown,\u201d as she\nput it. She knew that sometimes a recipient would print a copy of the\nnewsletter and pass it around the cellblock. Over days, then weeks, Price and\nher colleagues were inundated with hundreds of phone calls and emails from\npeople seeking compassionate release or inquiring about the process for loved\nones behind bars.\n\nAmid the deluge, one inquiry stood out: It was written by a prisoner on behalf\nof someone else. The sender did not disclose his name. \u201cI am writing this from\nthe \u2018Cancer\u2019 floor of FMC Butner,\u201d he wrote, referring to the Federal Medical\nCenter in Butner, North Carolina. The five-story facility provides health care\nto some of America\u2019s sickest male prisoners; it includes a psychiatric unit, a\nunit devoted to orthopedic surgery, and a cancer ward. \u201cThis is directed at\nthe situation of another patient,\u201d the sender wrote. \u201cHe is terminal and is\nunable to contact you directly.\u201d\n\nThe sick man, R. Smith, had lung cancer. As Price later wrote in an article\nfor the American Bar Association, he was in persistent pain and dependent on a\nfeeding tube. With a prognosis of less than 12 months to live, and a sentence\nlasting much longer for distributing drugs, Smith applied to the BOP for\ncompassionate release. But instead of going home, he was bound for FMC\nButner\u2019s hospice ward.\n\nThe anonymous person who contacted FAMM said that he had heard Smith crying to\nhis family during a call on the ward pay phone. A longtime recipient of FAMM\u2019s\nnewsletter, the man knew that Smith might now have another way to seek\ncompassionate release. With Smith\u2019s permission, he was using Smith\u2019s CorrLinks\naccount. BOP policy forbade prisoners from using one another\u2019s accounts, and\nthe sender knew he risked punishment for doing so, which is why he left the\nmessage unsigned. He asked: Would FAMM consider helping Smith?\n\nSmith\u2019s case was exactly the kind Price had in mind when she drafted FAMM\u2019s\nnewsletter. FAMM connected Smith with an attorney, who began to prepare a\nlegal motion. Meanwhile, according to Price, Smith got sicker. One of his\nlungs collapsed, and the man communicating with FAMM from inside Butner\nreported that Smith had been moved to an outside hospital better equipped to\ntreat him. Smith\u2019s lawyer couldn\u2019t get updated information about his\ncondition, but this wasn\u2019t unusual: The BOP can be especially evasive about\nmedical details near the end of a person\u2019s life. \u201cThere\u2019s no more cruel part\nof the BOP than this,\u201d said a former federal defense attorney who spoke on\ncondition of anonymity.\n\nSmith\u2019s lawyer filed an emergency motion in federal court for his release. The\ncourt then ordered the BOP to provide an account of Smith\u2019s medical condition\nby that afternoon. The BOP didn\u2019t meet the deadline, so the judge contacted\nSmith\u2019s doctor directly. Upon learning how poorly Smith was doing, the judge\nordered his release within ten days, as soon as appropriate transport could be\narranged. No one could reach Smith in the hospital to deliver the news, so\nPrice sent a message to the person at Butner working on his behalf. She hoped\nthat he would find a way to tell Smith that he didn\u2019t have to die behind bars.\n\nSmith\u2019s case was a turning point for FAMM\u2019s work on compassionate release\nbecause it offered a blueprint for helping qualifying individuals. FAMM worked\nwith the Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs and\nthe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to expand the capacity of\nthe Compassionate Release Clearinghouse, a newly created entity that\nrecruited, trained, and supported lawyers representing sick or elderly\nprisoners requesting early release. In its first year, the Clearinghouse\nscreened some 500 inquiries and placed more than 125 cases with lawyers.\n\nSmith\u2019s case also marked the start of a unique relationship. \u201cMr. Smith and\nhis family are very lucky to have you in his corner,\u201d Price wrote to the man\nwho\u2019d helped Smith. \u201cWe should all have friends like you.\u201d\n\nBy then, Price knew the man\u2019s name: Gary Settle. He was slow to tell her much\nabout himself, but he continued to send CorrLinks messages to FAMM as he\nrecruited more people at Butner for the Clearinghouse. In emails he sometimes\nused the moniker \u201cP/H,\u201d for \u201cpatient/helper,\u201d in part to protect himself from\nBOP censure, and in part because he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to himself.\nHe felt that his personal story\u2014including why he was serving 177 years in\nprison, along with his own cancer diagnosis\u2014was beside the point.\n\nGary Settle as a child\n\nSettle was born in 1966 in Hawthorne, California, a small city adjacent to\nSouth Central Los Angeles. His childhood had what he considered \u201cstorybook\u201d\nelements: loving parents, a brother to horse around with, Little League games,\nfamily camping trips. In the summer his mother, Kay, took time off her\nwaitressing job to drive the boys to the beach. Settle was bright\u2014\u201cso smart I\ncould smack him,\u201d Kay said. At age ten, he asked his mom for copies of\nShakespeare\u2019s plays, then named his cat Ophelia. \u201cWe weren\u2019t rich in money,\nbut we were happy, we had friends, there were always people over,\u201d Settle\nwrote in a document he calls his \u201clife story,\u201d which he shared with me.\n\nIn time, Settle developed a rebellious streak. If Kay told him to stay within\na few blocks of the house on his skateboard, he\u2019d ride to busy areas downtown\ninstead. When Settle was 13, his parents bought a farm in Ohio; his father\nthought the fresh air and country life would be good for the family. \u201cWe all\nhad to learn on the fly all the farming tasks\u2014feeding the cows, milking them\nand shoveling the other substances they produced by the wheelbarrow load,\u201d\nSettle wrote. \u201cIf Green Acres hadn\u2019t already been made, we would have had a\ngreat pilot.\u201d It was a major transition for Settle: the unrelenting\nresponsibility of farm work, the unfamiliarity of the local culture. His puka-\nshell necklace and faded Levi\u2019s didn\u2019t vibe with the rural Ohio style of bib\noveralls and John Deere hats.\n\nEven so, he quickly made friends. He got into the habit of enlisting his\nbuddies to help with household tasks. \u201cOnce, I told him he couldn\u2019t go to a\nbaseball game because he had to help with the chores,\u201d Kay recalled, \u201cand all\nof a sudden the whole team was weeding.\u201d The town closest to his family\u2019s farm\nhad a single traffic light, two police officers, a barber shop, and \u201cat least\nten bars,\u201d according to Settle. There was little to do, so he and his friends\ndrank. Settle recalled being a happy drunk, outgoing and enthusiastic; he\nboasted that his charm was infectious.\n\nSettle also liked to showboat\u2014driving recklessly, hood surfing, doing\nmotorcycle stunts. \u201cI was not breaking any laws other than traffic ones,\u201d he\nwrote. \u201cThose I was shattering.\u201d In fact, a juvenile court found him guilty of\nan offense when he was 17; the case records are sealed, but Settle said that\nthe conviction stemmed from a fistfight he had with a man in his twenties.\nLooking back, he wondered whether spending his teenage years in a small town\nwith few opportunities contributed to the course his life took.\n\nIn 1985, Settle got his high school sweetheart pregnant, and soon they\nmarried. At age 20, Settle had expenses and responsibilities, and he grew\nrestless. When he heard about a gig with a construction company in Florida, he\ndecided to move there with $400, two buddies, and no plan\u2014he left his family\nbehind for the time being. He and his friends arrived in time for spring break\nand blew all their money at Daytona. When Settle got a job, he had to sleep on\na picnic table behind a church for a week, until he got his first paycheck.\n\nDespite an inauspicious beginning in his new home, Settle worked hard, and he\nadvanced from laborer to finisher and then to foreman. The construction\ncompany had contracts all over the Southeast, so Settle traveled, staying in\nmotels. When the workday was over, he and his crew headed to strip clubs or\nhung out in bars.\n\nSettle found a house big enough for his family; his wife gave birth to their\nson, Nathan, back in Ohio, then moved down to join him. In time Settle\u2019s\nparents decided to relocate to Florida, too. Settle started his own\nconstruction company in Orange City, just north of Orlando. But for all that\nwas changing, Settle still liked to spend his free time drinking with friends.\n\nOne day, after a few beers, he went to the drive-through window at a bank to\ndeposit a check. He recognized the teller\u2014she was a woman he knew from the\nlocal bar scene. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked with a smile. He replied, as a\njoke, \u201cGive me all your money.\u201d The woman bent out of sight and then\nreappeared holding a plastic container full of neatly stacked bills. \u201cYou mean\nthis?\u201d she asked, laughing.\n\nA few weeks later, Settle ran into the woman at a bar, and she brought up\ntheir exchange at the bank, saying there had been $35,000 in the box. After\ntheir conversation, Settle couldn\u2019t get the number out of his head. All that\nmoney, and so close he could have grabbed it.\n\n## At 27 years old, Settle was facing life in prison. It was all so\nuncanny\u2014sitting there in a suit, knowing he would never be free again\u2014that he\nalmost felt compelled to laugh.\n\nIn October 1991, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported that a tall white man\nwith long brown hair and a mustache had walked into a bank during a Tuesday\nmorning rainstorm. He was wearing the waistband of a woman\u2019s stocking over his\nface and carrying a white bag. He vaulted the counter and pulled out a\nsemiautomatic handgun, then took a stack of cash before fleeing on foot into a\nwooded area. Heavy rainfall prevented the sheriff\u2019s helicopter from tracking\nhim, and the dogs and deputies chasing him lost his trail.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Settle\u2019s first robbery; he\u2019d begun holding up banks and stealing\ncash the year prior. Most of the time, he didn\u2019t run away\u2014he stole a car from\na bank clerk or customer. One time he approached a car with an elderly woman\nsitting behind the wheel. According to Settle, when she informed him that she\nneeded her walker if she was going to get out, he pulled it from the trunk,\ngot her to her feet, and then sped away. He could hear sirens in the distance.\n\nBy April 1992, the FBI was pursuing what it described to the West Volusia Sun-\nNews as a \u201cserial bank robber on the loose.\u201d They believed that he was\nresponsible for as many as seven bank robberies and one attempted robbery over\nan 18-month period. The criminal, the FBI said, was \u201carmed, dangerous, and\nready to strike again.\u201d\n\nThat account didn\u2019t square with how Settle saw himself. \u201cIt is embarrassing to\nadmit this, and shameful to acknowledge,\u201d he wrote later, \u201cbut in a way, I\nthought of the whole thing as a sort of prank or practical joke, with a big\ncash payoff.\u201d According to Settle, he didn\u2019t encounter any law enforcement,\nand he had no problem persuading tellers to cooperate. He was never in a bank\nfor more than a minute or two, and he never hurt anyone physically. He saw his\nplunder as \u201cfree and easy money.\u201d (A woman present during one of the robberies\nwould later testify that her encounter with Settle scared her so much that she\nquit her job, and that she would \u201cnever be able to work again or be able to be\nalone again in the future.\u201d)\n\nSettle had accomplices\u2014sometimes he had one drive a getaway car\u2014and in\nSeptember 1992,^ two of them decided to rob a bank on their own. They were\ncaught before they succeeded, and during their interrogation they fingered\nSettle as the mastermind of the operation. Shortly after, Settle, who was on a\ntrip to Boston at the time, was arrested for running a stop sign and driving\nunder the influence. When police in Massachusetts ran his name through their\ndatabases, they\u2014and Settle\u2014learned that he was wanted in Florida on federal\nbank robbery charges.\n\nSettle was indicted on March 18, 1993, on nine counts of bank robbery, one\ncount of attempted bank robbery, one count of conspiracy, and ten counts of\ncarrying a firearm while committing a violent crime. The government alleged\nthat, in total, Settle had stolen around $190,000. \u201cIf I would have done\nsomething worthwhile with the money, I don\u2019t think I would feel any better\nabout things, but I might not feel so foolish,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe only people who\nreally benefitted from the robberies would be various bartenders, waitresses,\nand strippers.\u201d By the time he was indicted, Settle had separated from his\nwife. He later described himself as being at his \u201creckless, selfish worst.\u201d\n\nSettle pleaded not guilty, and he later claimed that he rejected a plea\nbargain that would have come with a relatively scant 12-year sentence had he\ntestified against his accomplices. (The prosecutor denied making such an\noffer.) During pretrial detention, Settle twice attempted to escape from\ncounty jail. When his case finally went to trial in Orlando, he did what he\ncould to appear serious, wearing a suit and taking notes. On May 11, 1993, the\njury found him guilty of almost all the charges against him.\n\nWith his conviction on the books, Settle was subject to the Sentencing Reform\nAct of 1984, a result of congressional hand-wringing about rising crime rates\nthat was later called \u201cthe most dramatic change in sentencing law and practice\nin our nation\u2019s history\u201d by the United States Sentencing Commission. The act\nsought to address what elected officials considered \u201cundue leniency\u201d in the\ncriminal-justice system, as well as inconsistencies in sentencing around the\ncountry. Among other things, it abolished federal parole and created a system\nof mandatory penalties for certain crimes, giving judges less discretion over\nsentencing.\n\nBy the time Settle was tried, the mandatory minimum for a violent offense\ncommitted with a firearm was five years. If a person previously convicted of\nsuch a crime carried a gun during a second violent offense, the mandatory\nminimum was 20 years. How, though, should a court sentence someone found\nguilty of armed robbery for the first time, but on multiple counts in a single\nlegal proceeding? As it happened, that exact question had been addressed just\nprior to Settle\u2019s trial, in the 1993 Supreme Court case Deal v. United States.\nIn a 6\u20133 decision, the court ruled that the harsher mandatory minimum should\napply even in a single indictment.\n\nWhen Settle was sentenced on August 30, 1993, the case law was so new that\nJudge Patricia Fawsett had to review it over a lunch recess. When she retook\nthe bench, Fawsett sentenced Settle to a mandatory 2,127 months in prison, or\njust over 177 years: 12 for the robbery and conspiracy charges, and 165 for\ncarrying a gun into a bank nine separate times. She ordered that he serve them\nconsecutively.\n\nFawsett wasn\u2019t inclined to be lenient, telling the defense that Settle showed\n\u201cutter disregard for the law,\u201d \u201ca complete lack of remorse,\u201d and \u201clack of\nconcern for the terror he caused.\u201d Still, she seemed troubled by the length of\nthe sentence. \u201cI do not think this is an appropriate result,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\nfeel bound by the law as I understand and explained to you.\u201d\n\nSettle felt that Fawsett approached his sentence as if it were just a problem\nto solve; she even asked the attorneys present to check her math. At 27 years\nold, Settle was facing life in prison. It was all so uncanny\u2014sitting there in\na suit, knowing he would never be free again\u2014that he almost felt compelled to\nlaugh.\n\nAdeel Bashir, a federal public defender currently working in the Middle\nDistrict of Florida, where Settle was tried, told me that he has \u201conly ever\nseen one other person get 2,000-plus months.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of sentence that\nwould make a criminal-justice professional wonder whether the defendant had\nkilled a child or was a serial pedophile. \u201cTo date, people ask me if Gary\u2019s\nsentence is a typo,\u201d Bashir said.\n\n## When Settle was transferred to a new facility, he almost always ran into\nsomeone he knew. Butner was no different, except that many of the people he\nrecognized were dying.\n\nEarly during his time behind bars, at a prison in Atlanta, Settle tried to\nescape along with two other men\u2014one of whom was the actor Woody Harrelson\u2019s\nfather\u2014by scaling a wall using a makeshift rope. They surrendered when a guard\nfired a warning shot from a tower.\n\nSettle spent the next two decades on a tour of federal prisons. He was housed\nfor a few years at the infamous supermax facility in Florence, Colorado, where\nprisoners are kept in solitary confinement for more than 20 hours a day.\nThat\u2019s where Settle was when his father died in 1996. He had already used the\none 15-minute phone call he was allowed that month when he heard the news, so\nhe had to wait until the following month to call his mom to grieve with her.\n\nBy 2016, he had landed at U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, which sits in the\nsoutheastern corner of Texas, half an hour from the Louisiana border, in a\nplace known as the Golden Triangle because of its rich oil reserves. It\u2019s also\nsometimes called Texas\u2019s cancer belt because of its high cancer mortality\nrate. At Beaumont, routine bloodwork showed that Settle had an elevated level\nof prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which is often used as the first\nindication of a prostate cancer diagnosis. According to Settle, he was not\ninformed right away. \u201cIt takes a while in those places for the mill to grind,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nAt his next stop, USP Hazelton in West Virginia, Settle \u201cstarted to feel\nweird.\u201d He had been diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease, a thyroid disorder, and\nneeded a double knee replacement. In 2018, doctors told him that his PSA was\n50.5 nanograms per milliliter. Many physicians consider 4 ng/mL to be the\npoint at which they recommend further testing to screen for cancer. Settle\u2019s\nlevel, in other words, was astronomical.\n\nHe had a biopsy, which showed a very high likelihood of cancer. When doctors\nproposed removing his prostate, Settle declined; the surgery can have\nunpleasant side effects, including incontinence and erectile dysfunction. He\nasked for hormone therapy instead, and requested a transfer to a medical\nfacility. After an extended back and forth, which Settle described as \u201ca lot\nof gnashing of teeth and wailing of banshees,\u201d the BOP sent him to FMC Butner\nfor treatment.\n\nAfter nearly three decades in federal prison, whenever Settle was transferred\nto a new facility, he almost always ran into someone he knew. Butner was no\ndifferent, except that many of the people he recognized were dying. \u201cI was\nshocked at the appearance and bearing of the prisoners I have known and the\nones I did not,\u201d he later wrote. \u201cI was around people who looked like\nconcentration camp inmates.\u201d\n\nButner is one of seven federal facilities that serve very sick prisoners, some\nof whom wind up there because they didn\u2019t get the treatment they needed to\nstave off serious illness. The law guarantees prisoners a constitutional right\nto health care\u2014a right, ironically, afforded to no other group in the\ncountry\u2014but in reality health care resources are limited behind bars, and\npotentially life-saving procedures are not always granted, even when they\u2019re\nclinically indicated. A former federal public defender who spoke anonymously\nsaid that, in reviewing clients\u2019 medical records, it\u2019s not unusual to find\nsomeone who was told years prior by a prison doctor that they needed an\nimmediate kidney transplant but never got one, or who had a heart condition\nrequiring a visit to a specialist that the BOP never facilitated.\n\n\u201cBecause most correctional health services are designed to cut costs and\nreduce perceived litigation risks, transparency and quality of care are not\ntop priorities,\u201d Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for New York\nCity\u2019s jails, writes in his book Life and Death in Rikers Island. Prejudice\nalso erodes standards of care. According to a DOJ report, \u201cThe belief that\nthose convicted of serious crimes have somehow earned their suffering, as if\nthe pain of illness and old age in prison were a part of the inmate\u2019s just\ndeserts ... [is] widespread and intense among some custody personnel and ...\nprevalent also among health care providers.\u201d\n\nHolding the prison system accountable for this bias is difficult. In a\nlandmark 1976 case, the Supreme Court ruled that substandard medical care in\nprisons violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment only if it rises to the level of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d and not\njust \u201cmere negligence.\u201d The difference between these two concepts is the\nsubject of an ongoing debate that prisoners have little power to influence.\n(In a statement, the BOP said, \u201cWe make every effort to ensure the physical,\nmedical, and mental safety of inmates confined to our facilities through a\ncontrolled environment that is secure, humane, and in line with community\nstandards of care.\u201d)\n\nAt Butner, Settle learned that there was a saying for someone whose health\nshowed a marked or rapid decline: He\u2019s falling down. Paradoxically, this meant\ngoing up\u2014to the fifth floor, where the hospice ward is located.^ A BOP\nPowerPoint presentation about Butner describes the hospice cells as private,\nwith small nods at comfort such as flower-patterned quilts, pillows that match\nthe blue cinder block walls, or a cushioned chair next to a bed. When Settle\narrived, Butner held a monthly memorial service for the recently deceased. He\nsaid that a single service often honored as many as 30 people.\n\nAfter beginning hormone therapy and radiation, Settle was able to maintain his\nstrength and physical independence, so he considered himself lucky. In turn,\nhe did what he could to help others. He noticed that one cancer patient,\nwheelchair-bound and too weak to push himself, would lock his chair to that of\nhis cellmate, who would shuffle his feet to get them both around the halls.\nSettle offered to wheel them to meals and chemotherapy appointments, and gave\nthe same assistance to others who couldn\u2019t walk. \u201cYou\u2019re not even really\nsupposed to do that,\u201d said Richard Hodge, who was incarcerated at Butner at\nthe time. \u201cGary could have been wrote up for breaking the rules.\u201d\n\nSettle also assisted with hygiene, changing diapers on grown men. \u201cI\u2019m just\nputting myself in their perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be very humbling.\u201d\nSettle reflected that he hadn\u2019t cared for his son much when he was a baby;\nperhaps this was a way of atoning for that. (Settle was long divorced and\nhadn\u2019t been in direct contact with his son in many years.)\n\nWhen he read the FAMM newsletter about the Compassionate Release\nClearinghouse, Settle saw another way he could help people. What was more\nimportant, he reasoned, than someone living out their last days in freedom,\nideally surrounded by their loved ones? He made R. Smith his first project.\n\nCompassionate release is grounded in the idea that changes to a person\u2019s\nhealth may weaken the justification for their incarceration. What reason is\nthere for imprisoning someone with Alzheimer\u2019s when he no longer understands\nthat he is being punished? When someone with late-stage liver disease can\u2019t\nget out of bed and is no longer a threat to society? When \u201crehabilitation\u201d is\nno longer feasible because a person has advanced cancer? \u201cWe\u2019re not doing any\nsocial good, if we were in the first place, in keeping them locked up,\u201d Price\nsaid. \u201cAnd we can do a great deal of good in terms of helping people repair\nrelationships and comfort each other and say goodbye.\u201d\n\nThere is also a financial calculus that works in the BOP\u2019s favor, one noted\nprominently in a 2013 DOJ report on compassionate release: It\u2019s almost always\ncheaper to release sick people than to keep them locked up until they die. One\nstudy found that the annual cost of caring for just 21 seriously ill prisoners\nin California was almost $2 million per person, while the median per capita\ncost of nursing home care in the state was $73,000 per year.\n\nAfter a judge allowed Smith to go home, Settle noticed a shift at Butner. He\nlater wrote an email to FAMM, trying to put into words what he was witnessing.\n\u201cIn this place of death and dying, among incarcerated men who are holding on\nto life with nothing but more cells, more keys, more misery in their future,\nyour efforts are having real, tangible results. Your efforts are giving hope,\u201d\nhe wrote. \u201cYou are giving life back to people, and you are giving them the\nmost precious gift of all, time. Time to heal old wounds, to take a last\nbreath of freedom and to leave this world with peace and dignity.\u201d\n\nFAMM worked closely with Settle through the summer and fall of 2019 to help\npeople at Butner. \u201cWe didn\u2019t appoint him,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe appointed himself.\u201d\nSettle made copies of FAMM\u2019s newsletter and distributed them to his neighbors.\nHe kept an eye out for people whose health was worsening and approached those\nhe thought might qualify for compassionate release. He told them what he knew\nabout the First Step Act, which he had studied, and about the Compassionate\nRelease Clearinghouse. He spent six to eight hours a day requesting medical\nrecords, addressing envelopes, and updating his contacts on the outside about\nvarious cases. Settle read medical records, cross-referencing terms with a\ndiagnostic manual and a medical encyclopedia he\u2019d ordered, so he could send\nthe most pertinent information about sick prisoners to their lawyers. Before\nlong his cell was covered with piles of paper.\n\nSettle also relayed information from incarcerated individuals to their family\nmembers. He helped people who were too sick to make it to a computer, those\nwho had been transferred off-site for care, and others who had never learned\nto read or write. Sometimes he wrote compassionate release requests himself,\nparroting the language he had seen in other applications. The ones that went\nto the BOP were all but certain to be rejected or ignored, but that was part\nof the process: For a prisoner to file a motion directly with a judge, they\nfirst had to \u201cexhaust administrative remedies,\u201d in legal parlance.\n\nWord got around Butner about what Settle was doing. He would leave his cell\nafter a nap to find four or five guys gathered outside, some of them in\nwheelchairs with paperwork in their laps. He was willing to assist just about\nanyone\u2014he said he only refused people convicted of sex crimes. \u201cGary is able\nto form relationships with all kinds of people,\u201d said Juliana Andonian, an\nattorney who used to work at FAMM. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to make himself the center\nof the story. That was really notable, the lack of ego.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t uncommon for people in prison to help one another with legal matters.\nJailhouse lawyers\u2014some with legal training, some without\u2014review statutes in a\nprison\u2019s law library, file paperwork, and perform other tasks for fellow\nprisoners, often for a fee or some other form of compensation. \u201cSomeone less\nsincere could make a lot of money or do a lot of harm,\u201d Andonian said. Settle\nrefused payment, even to cover the cost of emails he sent and phone calls he\nmade. The mother of a man Settle helped go home remembered sending him a\nthank-you note. \u201cThat\u2019s about all he let me send him,\u201d she said.\n\nOne day a thought dawned on Price. \u201cHe is doing this job that the Bureau of\nPrisons should be doing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be moving heaven and earth to\nbe sure that people are connected to family and loved ones when they\u2019re near\nthe end of their lives.\u201d\n\nAmong the people Settle helped was a man in his thirties named Victor Webster,\nwho was originally from Montana. Webster was in treatment for Ewing\u2019s sarcoma,\na rare cancer that occurs in or around the bones. He\u2019d had the whole left side\nof his rib cage removed, followed by extensive chemo, but then a tumor\ndeveloped on his chest plate. \u201cHis mental state was poor,\u201d Settle said. \u201cHe\nassumed he was going to die in prison.\u201d When Webster didn\u2019t want to continue\ntreatment, Settle pushed him in a wheelchair to his chemo appointments. He\nalso got to work helping Webster obtain compassionate release.\n\nSettle sent increasingly urgent emails to FAMM on Webster\u2019s behalf, asking the\ngroup to move quickly. He visited Webster several times a day, until finally\nhe was able to deliver the news that a judge had granted him immediate\nrelease. \u201cI wish I had the ability to describe how the natural stoic look on\nhis face collapsed or the strength of the hug I received from a guy I had been\nhelping dress and stand up for weeks,\u201d Settle said.\n\nWebster went home in early July 2019. According to Settle, before he left he\ngave Settle a chain necklace with a cross, which he\u2019d worn every day he was at\nButner. Soon after he got home, Webster spoke with Settle and said he\u2019d spent\na wonderful Fourth of July with his family, including his nieces and nephews.\nThey bought fireworks and set them off for him. Webster died that September.\n\u201cIt was sad it was just so short,\u201d his mother, Debra Claassen, said of her\nson\u2019s time at home.\n\nThe names and stories piled up. Von Skyler Cox, who had stage IV lung cancer\nand a prognosis of less than ten months, wrote to FAMM on behalf of \u201cmyself\nand my family and the \u2018Patient/Helper\u2019 \u201d after he was granted compassionate\nrelease in August 2019. \u201cYour efforts have reminded me and many others that\nthere are Great People in the world who have not forgotten us,\u201d Cox wrote.\nAndonian printed out the email and put it on the office fridge.\n\nSettle noticed certain patterns\u2014for instance, that a lot of the men granted\nrelease had been charged with crimes in blue states, where judges were perhaps\nmore inclined toward compassion or less concerned about the political\nramifications of releasing people from prison. (Recent research indicates that\nfederal judges appointed by Democratic presidents are more likely to grant\ncompassionate release than those put on the bench by Republicans.) According\nto Settle, some of the men who went home had been convicted of violent\noffenses, but he ruefully noted that they often had shorter sentences than he\ndid.\n\nHe became swept up in the momentum. \u201cOnce I got going with it, I had to do\nit,\u201d Settle said. \u201cWhat type of person would I be if I did not assist people\nand their families at this most crucial time when I could?\u201d He went on: \u201cThere\nis nothing I can do about the past, but I get to decide how I live the rest of\nmy life.\u201d\n\n## \u201cSimply put, we are grateful for Gary, and awed by the care and compassion\nhe shows for those in distress,\u201d the FAMM letter said. \u201cWe have learned from\nhim how to do our jobs better.\u201d\n\nIn August 2019, about five months after they began corresponding, Price\ndecided to meet Settle in person. \u201cI want to make sure that he is safe doing\nthis,\u201d Andonian recalled Price telling her. According to Settle, the Butner\nstaff were increasingly aware of his efforts to help people secure\ncompassionate release, and their reactions were mixed. He had never gotten in\ntrouble for using other people\u2019s CorrLinks accounts, but some corrections\nofficers told him he was \u201cmaking them look bad.\u201d He found that Butner\nemployees with medical backgrounds tended to be more receptive, even\nexpediting his requests for medical records and quietly referring patients to\nhim. Still, to Settle they seemed jaded, like \u201chow you would be if you worked\nin a dog pound and you get to see sick animals that they put down.\u201d\n\nPrice\u2019s job doesn\u2019t put her into a lot of direct, consistent contact with\npeople in prison. Rather, her role is usually to assess a person\u2019s needs and\nconnect them with resources. On her way to North Carolina, Price\u2019s overriding\nfeeling was curiosity\u2014who was this person who had committed himself to\nadvocating on behalf of others? She and Settle spent an afternoon together in\nButner\u2019s visiting room. As the hours wore on, Price asked Settle if he wanted\nanything from the vending machine; steadfast in his policy of not accepting\nany gifts, he politely refused. Water was free, \u201cso we drank a lot of water,\u201d\nPrice said.\n\nAfter the visit, Settle gradually began corresponding with Price as a friend.\nShe told him about what she was growing in her garden and described a recent\nwhale-watching vacation. He talked about his mother, Kay, whom he worried\nabout all the time, and what he was reading. Price sent him books she thought\nhe might like, including a trilogy by Ivan Doig and two books of poetry; one,\nby Ada Lim\u00f3n, Settle saved until Christmas to read as a treat. When Price was\nsick, Settle asked his mother to send her flowers.\n\nThat December, Andonian, Price, and another FAMM employee, Debi Campbell,\nasked Settle if they could write a letter to Kay. \u201cI knew him well enough to\nknow his mom was his treasure,\u201d Andonian said. The FAMM team wanted to tell\nKay how much Settle had come to mean to them. Settle consented.\n\n\u201cGary, who calls himself the \u2018patient/helper,\u2019 impressed us immediately,\u201d the\nletter to Kay read. \u201cHe follows up conscientiously on each and every person he\nworks with. Beyond winning or losing, he cares about their spirits.\u201d The FAMM\nstaff said that, by their count, Settle had helped 19 people obtain release,\nallowing them to spend their last days with their families. \u201cSimply put, we\nare grateful for Gary, and awed by the care and compassion he shows for those\nin distress,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cWe have learned from him how to do our\njobs better.\u201d\n\nSoon Settle\u2019s assistance would become more urgent than ever.\n\nOvercrowding, unsanitary facilities, poor medical care\u2014those were just some of\nthe reasons COVID was able to tear through U.S. prisons at astonishing speed.\nWithin weeks of the virus being declared a national emergency, rates of\ninfection in prisons far outpaced those in the population at large. By the end\nof April 2020, eight of the country\u2019s ten largest COVID outbreaks were in\nprisons or jails. Still, the BOP was slow to implement masking, social-\ndistancing, and testing policies. Some incarcerated individuals were scared to\nreport symptoms because it meant being sent to solitary confinement.\n\nButner was hit particularly hard. With its medically vulnerable population,\nincluding many cancer patients, the facility was practically a showcase for\nthe comorbidities that can make people who contract COVID especially\nsusceptible to severe illness or death. By late July 2020, a remote inspection\nby the DOJ\u2019s Office of the Inspector General found that 1,020 people\nimprisoned at Butner had COVID, and that 25 of them, along with at least one\nstaff member, had died. Later, in the fall 2021, the ACLU would report that\nButner had more than twice the number of COVID fatalities as any other federal\nprison. (The ACLU and Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban\nAffairs filed a lawsuit against the BOP over its handling of COVID at Butner,\nbut a judge dismissed the case over procedural questions.)\n\nThe BOP has policies about notifying family members if a prisoner becomes\nseriously ill, but these are not always strictly followed. At the height of\nthe pandemic, loved ones often struggled to obtain updated information. One\nformer federal defender who spoke on condition of anonymity described\nreceiving calls from people who were desperate to know about their loved ones.\nI haven\u2019t heard from my son in a month, they said; or I don\u2019t know if my\nbrother is in a hospital unconscious or just in quarantine. \u201cIt created so\nmuch panic for family members,\u201d the former federal defender told me.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, passed in March 2020,\nexpanded the BOP\u2019s authority to place prisoners in home confinement for a\nportion of their sentence. Prisoners don\u2019t have to apply for this sort of\ntransfer, so Attorney General William Barr directed the BOP to identify\n\u201csuitable candidates\u201d\u2014those with COVID comorbidities, convictions for\nnonviolent crimes, and low risk of recidivism. According to data from the\nMarshall Project, the BOP placed nearly 5 percent of its incarcerated\npopulation in home confinement by October 2020. But at Butner, among other\nplaces, the bureau dragged its feet. The DOJ would later estimate that\nalthough 1,070 people at Butner may have been eligible for home confinement as\nearly as April 2020, the BOP had released only 68 by July.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Marshall Project, the BOP didn\u2019t budge from its\nusual stance on compassionate release, approving less than 1 percent of the\nmore than 31,000 requests it received in the first year of the pandemic. A\n2022 NPR analysis later found that at least one in four federal prisoners who\ndied of COVID had sought compassionate release. (In a statement, the BOP said\nthat it \u201ccarefully followed updates from the CDC, and guidance was provided to\nour facilities\u201d about protective measures. With regard to compassionate\nrelease, the bureau gave a brief summary of the request process and noted that\n\u201cthe decision on whether to grant such a motion ... lies with the sentencing\ncourt.\u201d)\n\nHoping that it could help people get home before it was too late, FAMM ramped\nup the work of the Clearinghouse, recruiting an army of attorneys and\nparalegals to get release requests before the courts. It decided to support\nappeals from prisoners with vulnerabilities to severe COVID infection, which\nunder the unprecedented circumstances might legally qualify as \u201cextraordinary\nand compelling reasons\u201d for early release. Prior to the pandemic, the\nClearinghouse had screened about 500 requests for assistance and helped some\n60 people go home. From the start of the pandemic to the end of 2021, nearly\n5,500 requests came in. People wrote about having asthma, compromised immune\nsystems, cancer. They were terrified of contracting COVID and dying. From the\nflood of communication, Clearinghouse attorneys were able to file 1,069\nmotions for compassionate release in the first year of COVID, 205 of which\nwere granted.\n\nAt Butner, Settle threw himself into helping people, including Richard Hodge,\nwho was serving 98 months for conspiracy to distribute drugs. Hodge had\nreceived two organ transplants before he arrived at Butner, and when he\ncontracted COVID, the virus hit him hard. As his body struggled to clear the\ninfection, he could barely stand up to use the bathroom. He didn\u2019t eat for ten\ndays, and he lost about 30 pounds. He later claimed that, despite having a\ncompromised immune system, he was given \u201cno treatment whatsoever.\u201d Hodge said\nthat the Butner staff was indifferent, at most checking his temperature and\nblood pressure. \u201cYou either survive or you don\u2019t, that was their mentality,\u201d\nhe told me. (In a statement, the BOP said, \u201cWe do not comment on anecdotal\nallegations or, for privacy and security reasons, discuss the conditions of\nconfinement for any inmate or group of inmates.\u201d)\n\nSettle implored Hodge to seek compassionate release, lest there be a worse\noutcome if he got COVID a second time. \u201cHe kept after me,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t think I had anything coming, but Gary kept insisting.\u201d Settle helped\nHodge file his compassionate release application with the BOP to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies and connected him with FAMM and an attorney. \u201cGary had\nall the information,\u201d Hodge said.\n\nIn March 2021, a judge granted Hodge\u2019s request; he was a free man. He went\nhome to Laurel County, Kentucky, where he could receive specialized care at a\ntransplant clinic and spend time with his kids and grandkids. \u201cIt was all\nbecause of you my friend,\u201d Hodge later wrote to Settle in an email. \u201cI owe you\nso much, and I wish there was some way I could bring you out of there bub.\u201d\n\n## \u201cI have a very small family, but I dream of an opportunity to be part of\ntheir lives,\u201d Settle wrote. \u201cI am humbly asking that you please consider\ngiving me that opportunity and you have my word, you will never have cause to\nregret it.\u201d\n\nIn July 2020, Andonian encouraged Settle to seek compassionate release. Thanks\nto hormone therapy, Settle\u2019s prostate cancer was in remission, but he had\nother medical conditions that could increase his risk of severe COVID.\nInitially, Settle was not in favor. \u201cI felt I did not qualify,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nthought that the finite amount of resources FAMM had at their disposal would\nbe better used to assist some of the very sick prisoners I knew.\u201d Andonian\nurged him to reconsider. She told him how deserving he was.\n\nAfter they spoke, Settle went back to his cell and broke down in tears. \u201cI\u2019m\nnot sure if my familiarity with the process made it more powerful,\u201d he said,\n\u201cbut it was an overwhelming sense of gratitude, happiness, and other\nemotions.\u201d\n\nWith Andonian\u2019s help, two attorneys filed a motion on Settle\u2019s behalf on\nJanuary 27, 2021. It highlighted the threat COVID posed to him, his work\nhelping people seek compassionate release, and his unusually onerous sentence.\nThe First Step Act, which had made compassionate release more accessible, also\ngave judges expanded discretion to reduce sentences, especially mandatory\nminimums. \u201cDuring his almost three decades of incarceration, Mr. Settle has\ngrown from a reckless young man into a thoughtful middle-aged man known for\nthe meaningful relationships he builds with others,\u201d the motion read. \u201cMr.\nSettle\u2019s extraordinary acts of service while in prison demonstrate his sincere\nrehabilitation and underscore that the period of incarceration imposed by the\nCourt has served its intended purpose and should be amended to time served.\u201d\n\nThe motion contained letters from people Settle had helped and from Victor\nWebster\u2019s mother. They praised Settle for being \u201cabove prison politics\u201d and\nfor helping people exercise their rights. \u201cIn a place full of hate this guy\noozed with love,\u201d one stated. \u201c[I] would love to see him in regular clothes,\nsee how fast or how slow he drives.\u201d A cancer survivor reflected on Settle\u2019s\ncompassion: \u201cWhen I was mentally down Mr. Settle would come into my cell and\nsit for hours at a time listening to me.\u201d Webster\u2019s mother said she would be\n\u201cforever grateful\u201d that Settle helped ensure that her son could die at home in\nMontana.\n\nSettle also made a direct appeal to the judge reviewing his request. He wrote\nthat while he couldn\u2019t explain the decisions he made as a young man, he had\ntried to be a better person since. What weighed on him most was being away\nfrom his family, especially his mother. \u201cMy own medical situation over the\nlast few years has exposed me to the fragile nature of life and the importance\nand lasting value of family connections,\u201d he wrote. He hoped to reconnect with\nhis son, meet his grandchildren, and care for his mother as she aged. \u201cI have\na very small family, but I dream of an opportunity to be part of their lives,\u201d\nhe wrote. \u201cI am humbly asking that you please consider giving me that\nopportunity and you have my word, you will never have cause to regret it.\u201d\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Judge Carlos Mendoza of the Middle District of Florida\ndenied Settle\u2019s motion. He ruled that Settle\u2019s health issues didn\u2019t meet the\ncriteria for compassionate release\u2014he wasn\u2019t terminal, and he could care for\nhimself. \u201cCovid-19 alone is not an extraordinary and compelling reason to\ngrant release,\u201d Mendoza said. In his view, reducing Settle\u2019s sentence would\nminimize the seriousness of his offense, and \u201cprotecting the public remains a\nparamount consideration.\u201d In other words, Mendoza considered Settle to be a\nthreat to society.\n\nThe ruling was a gut punch to Settle and his supporters. \u201cI was disappointed\u2014I\nstill am\u2014by the shortsightedness of the judicial inquiry,\u201d Andonian later\nsaid.\n\nEleven days after Settle\u2019s request was denied, his physician contacted him\nwith more bad news: The cancer was back. Mendoza had ruled on outdated\ninformation.\n\n## Settle knew of people who were granted compassionate release but, because\nthey had no family to help them, died in prison as free men.\n\nI began communicating with Settle in July 2021. I had read Price\u2019s American\nBar Association article about the work FAMM was doing on compassionate\nrelease, which referred to Settle\u2019s crucial role without mentioning him by\nname. I asked the FAMM staff if the anonymous helper was amenable to having\nhis story told. Andonian said that he was.\n\nSettle and I had just one exchange on CorrLinks and a single phone call before\nhis communication privileges were taken away. According to an incident report\nhe later shared with me, he was written up for speaking to a member of the\nmedia without following \u201cspecial mail procedures\u201d\u2014he had not obtained the\nprison\u2019s permission before speaking with a journalist. Settle said that he was\nalso placed in solitary confinement for two weeks. He eventually had his\nprivileges restored, and for the next few months he called me several times a\nweek. In chunks of no more than 15 minutes, due to the prison\u2019s time limit on\noutgoing calls, he told me about his life and the people he\u2019d helped send\nhome.\n\nThat November, Settle wrote to say that his cancer had spread. A PET scan\nshowed that it was in his lymph nodes, making it stage IV. He was starting\ntreatment: hormone therapy again, along with eight rounds of chemo and perhaps\nradiation. He wrote that he saw cancer \u201cas a challenge, as a fight I will be\nin till it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nHe reported, too, that a social worker had told him he met the criteria for\ncompassionate release\u2014a coded way, Settle knew from his work with FAMM, of\nsaying that he had less than 18 months to live. There was no guarantee he\nwould get out, but given his new prognosis, he could ask the courts to\nconsider his case a second time. Doing that would mean breaking his mother\u2019s\nheart in a new way: Settle had avoided telling Kay about his cancer\ndiagnosis\u2014she thought that he\u2019d filed his first compassionate release motion\nbecause his Graves\u2019 disease heightened his COVID risk. He lied because Kay was\na cancer survivor and because his father had died of the disease. He didn\u2019t\nwant to cause his mother anguish. Now, though, he had to tell her: If he\nrequested compassionate release, the BOP would contact Kay to vet her as a\nsuitable end-of-life caregiver. (Settle knew of people who were granted\ncompassionate release but, because they had no family to help them, died in\nprison as free men.)\n\nSettle said that telling his mom about his cancer was \u201cthe hardest thing I\nhave ever done.\u201d Kay told me she didn\u2019t \u201cscrape, rant, or rave\u201d when she heard\nthe news. She just asked \u201cwhat number\u201d the cancer was. \u201cWe\u2019re going to beat\nthis,\u201d she told her son. Settle wept.\n\nSettle found himself comparing his own situation with those of the people he\nwas helping. He observed what happened to his neighbors as their bodies broke\ndown and to the compassionate release motions of people with advanced\nmetastatic cancer. He saw people with long histories of incarceration and\nmultiple convictions, including for violent offenses, be sent home.\n\nThere were signs that his case might go the same way. Prison wardens are apt\nto deny compassionate release requests, stymieing them before they can even\nget to the BOP\u2019s Central Office for final review, but Butner\u2019s warden agreed\nthat Settle met the criteria and recommended him for release. The response\ncame as a surprise; for Settle it also confirmed just how poor his prognosis\nwas.\n\nWhile Settle waited to hear from the BOP, his legal team prepared to take his\nrequest to court if it was denied. Juliann Welch and Adeel Bashir, federal\ndefense attorneys in the Florida district where Settle was originally tried,\nagreed to helm the effort, while Price and others at FAMM would offer guidance\nand support. Settle referred to them as Team Gary. The existence of a support\nsquad strategizing about his case astonished him. \u201cUp until a few years ago, I\nwas Team Gary,\u201d he said.\n\nThe omicron variant was racing through Butner when the BOP\u2019s Central Office\noverrode the warden and denied Settle\u2019s request, noting that his release\n\u201cwould minimize the severity of his offense and pose a danger to the\ncommunity.\u201d Settle and his lawyers now had to prepare to once again go before\nJudge Mendoza, who was still on the bench with jurisdiction over the case.\nGiven Mendoza\u2019s previous ruling, Team Gary hoped to get the U.S. attorney\nassigned to the case to support Settle\u2019s release. It would be harder, they\nreasoned, for Mendoza to say no to both the defense and the state.\n\nWelch and Bashir sent a package of materials to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office,\nincluding character references and notes from medical experts who had\nevaluated Settle\u2019s health records. A doctor concluded that although Settle\nwould recover from the side effects of cancer treatment, he would require\nincreasing amounts of assistance and ultimately need around-the-clock care,\n\u201ceither in a palliative or hospice setting.\u201d A nurse at Butner who had cared\nfor Settle wrote that she thought there was essentially zero chance he would\nreoffend. Research supported her intuition: The DOJ found in 2013 that only\n3.5 percent of people granted compassionate release reoffended, compared with\n41 percent of all individuals discharged from federal prison.\n\nStill, Welch and Bashir offered concessions\u2014a period of home confinement, for\nexample, or an ankle monitor\u2014that they hoped would guard against the judge\u2019s\nconcerns that Settle might still be dangerous. \u201cThe hurdle we have to get over\nis convincing the court that he\u2019s also deserving,\u201d Welch said, \u201cbecause all of\nthis is very firmly discretionary.\u201d\n\nSettle waited to learn about his fate. As weeks and then months ticked by, our\nemail exchanges and phone conversations became less focused, more desultory. I\nhad fewer pointed questions for Settle to answer before the phone line cut\noff. He told me about what he was reading: The Economist, The Wall Street\nJournal, Neal Stephenson books. He bemoaned that his 82-year-old mother still\ninsisted on climbing a ladder to clean her gutters. He told stories, including\none about visiting his grandparents when he was a child. Settle recalled\nclambering up a cherry tree even though he\u2019d been told it was too weak to hold\nhim. When he fell, he was stunned more than hurt, but still he began to cry.\nHis grandfather gruffly told him to get up, adding, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be\nstupid, you\u2019re going to have to be tough.\u201d\n\nSettle told me he still tried to live by that way of thinking. \u201cI brought this\non myself,\u201d he said, not for the first time, about his incarceration. There\nwas no point in complaining. \u201cExcept about the sentence,\u201d he added dryly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll complain about that.\u201d\n\nSometimes Settle slipped into dark moods. He was serving a life sentence with\na life-limiting illness, and he was surrounded by people in a similar\nposition. It was a lot to bear. \u201cAnxious and impatient could be my middle\nnames,\u201d he said.\n\nHe tried to stay busy, even while undergoing cancer treatment. He worked on\ncompassionate release motions for his neighbors and spent time on his own\ncase, hoping to help Team Gary. He sent Welch a copy of his medical\nrecords\u2014even though she already had them\u2014highlighting what he considered the\nmost important parts. He kept track of side effects from his treatment,\nincluding mouth sores, debilitating fatigue, and a numb left leg, so that no\none could claim he was tolerating it well. He counted how many pills he took:\n39 on most days, 51 when he had chemo. He had never slept comfortably in\nprison, and the steroids he was now taking didn\u2019t help. He made sure to\nexercise and drink plenty of water, but eating healthy could be challenging:\nAccording to Price, the prison gave Settle only one piece of fruit\u2014a\nbanana\u2014per week, and the \u201csalad\u201d on offer was just lettuce.\n\nSettle allowed himself to consider what life outside prison would be like. He\nwanted to speak to at-risk youth, to cook the food he liked to eat, to\nsubmerge himself in water for the first time in almost 30 years\u2014\u201cpreferably\nswimming but I will settle for a good soak in a tub,\u201d he said. Kay, too,\nfantasized about the contented time she might have with her son. She had a\nroom ready for him in her home, and she looked forward to going to the beach\nand sitting on her patio together, enjoying the view. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a\nwhole new world,\u201d she said.\n\nSettle also hoped that if he was released he might get better treatment, buy\nmore time. Kay felt the same way\u2014in our conversations, she kept mentioning the\nurgency of getting her son to a \u201cgood doctor.\u201d Sometimes it felt as though\nSettle and his mother had allowed themselves to believe that the terminal\ndiagnosis only applied within prison walls. I wondered, if Settle were\nreleased, how it would feel to face the knowledge that he would still die of a\npainful disease.\n\nWhen Settle saw his oncologist, he peppered the doctor with questions: Why was\nhe having pain in his back? Could it be an indication that the cancer had\nspread to his bones? Bone metastases were notoriously painful and hard to\ntreat; developing them was one of his biggest fears. According to Settle, the\noncologist told him, \u201cYou look too good to be that sick!\u201d\n\nSettle said that he didn\u2019t keep in touch with many people when he was feeling\nlow, but he spoke to me because it made him feel \u201cmuse-like.\u201d He mentioned the\nauthor John Irving, who has said that he liked to start a new novel by writing\nthe last line first. \u201cWith that idea in mind,\u201d Gary wrote to me, \u201chow does\nsome variation of this ending sound: \u2018And Gary walked out the prison\ndoor....\u2019?\u201d\n\n## After he heard the news, Settle called me and barked a mock headline for my\nstory: \u201cNot Terminal Enough!\u201d\n\nEarly in the spring of 2022, the assistant U.S. attorney who had reviewed the\nmaterials sent by Welch and Bashir announced that she would not support\nSettle\u2019s motion for compassionate release. She believed that, even in his\ndiminished state, he posed too great a risk to society. A social worker who\nadvocates for people to be released from prison due to serious illness told me\nthat she often sees prosecutors take this approach: \u201cThey want them to be on\ndeath\u2019s door.\u201d\n\nAfter he heard the news, Settle called me and barked a mock headline for my\nstory: \u201cNot Terminal Enough!\u201d\n\nOnce again it felt as if a decision was being made based on out-of-date\ninformation. In April, a scan indicated that Settle\u2019s cancer may have spread\nto his spinal column. His wrists had become so weak, likely from arthritis,\nthat he was wearing splints that reached to his elbows. By May, he couldn\u2019t\nhold a toothbrush and barely managed to secure the large buttons on his prison\nuniform. Due to weakness in one of his legs, likely caused by metastases\npressing on his sciatic nerve, he was issued a walker. It went without saying\nthat even if he wanted to rob a bank, he couldn\u2019t easily enter one, much less\nhold a gun or get away quickly.\n\nHis deteriorating condition led to accidents: Settle burned his arm when he\nspilled hot liquid on it, and he had a couple of falls. He could no longer\npush his wheelchair-bound friends to meals. \u201cThis is a really hard time for\nhim, a really hard transformation from being the person who gives and supports\nto being the person who has to be supported,\u201d Price said after visiting Settle\nthat spring.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times a person can apply for compassionate\nrelease, but Settle\u2019s attorneys believed that he probably had one more shot.\nFor Team Gary, the question became whether to file the motion with Mendoza,\ndespite the assistant U.S. attorney\u2019s lack of support, or wait until Settle\nwas even sicker. Settle was resolute: He wanted to file and be done with the\nuncertainty.\n\nOn May 27, 2022, he tested positive for COVID. The symptoms started with\nnausea and vomiting; eventually, he developed fever, chills, and trouble\nbreathing. He was placed in isolation. He later told me that he survived for\nthree days on cough drops and water.\n\nSettle\u2019s lawyers filed his motion for compassionate release on May 31, with a\nrequest that it be expedited because of his COVID infection. They laid out\nSettle\u2019s \u201cchanged medical circumstances\u201d and the Butner warden\u2019s determination\nthat Gary met the criteria for a reduced sentence, even though his superiors\ndisagreed. They emphasized that with his \u201cimminent, continued, and significant\nphysical decline consequent to his incurable condition,\u201d along with his utter\nlack of inclination to reoffend and his demonstrated remorse and\nrehabilitation, he didn\u2019t pose a danger to the public. Releasing Gary \u201cdoes\nnot undermine respect for the law,\u201d the motion read. In an interview, Welch\nput it more bluntly: \u201cHis case is what the government had in mind when they\nwrote the compassionate release statute.\u201d\n\nIn response to the motion, Mendoza called an in-person hearing\u2014an unusual\nmove. Settle and his lawyers hoped that meant the judge was seriously\nconsidering granting his release. The hearing took place on a hot summer day\nin Orlando, and it lasted about 45 minutes. Mendoza asked questions about\nSettle\u2019s health and disciplinary record, and he raised several concerns: Why\nhad Settle never sent apology letters to the people he had terrorized during\nhis robberies? Why had he waited so long to express remorse? Welch read a\nstatement Settle had written, and Mendoza seemed receptive. \u201cIt appears as if\nhe\u2019s accepting responsibility for what he did,\u201d the judge said. Welch then\nrequested that, should Mendoza not yet deem Settle ready for release, he\nconsider abeyance\u2014hitting the pause button on the motion\u2014so that when Settle\u2019s\ncondition worsened, as it inevitably would, the motion could be considered\nagain.\n\nMendoza said that he needed time to think. \u201cThis is a very difficult decision\nI\u2019m being asked to make,\u201d he said before adjourning the hearing.\n\nA month later, Mendoza scheduled another hearing, this one by telephone.\nWithin moments of starting the call, he dashed Team Gary\u2019s hopes. The judge\ntold Bashir, who attended the hearing on Settle\u2019s behalf, that he saw no\nexamples of Settle\u2019s rehabilitation and remained concerned about his\ndisciplinary record. Moreover, Mendoza said he found Settle\u2019s statement of\nremorse disingenuous, given that he\u2019d waited until he was seeking release to\nexpress it, and had never directly asked his victims for forgiveness. For\nthose reasons, Mendoza concluded, the motion for compassionate release was\ndenied. He did not allow for comment before ending the hearing.\n\nAfterward, Price at FAMM got a call from Settle. He hadn\u2019t been able to reach\nBashir and figured Price might know how Mendoza had ruled. Price had heard the\nnews. \u201cI was deeply saddened by the denial and outraged by the form it took,\u201d\nshe wrote to me in an email. When she saw that Settle was calling, she didn\u2019t\nanswer\u2014she thought it was better that he speak to his attorneys. But when he\ncalled a second time, she answered.\n\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d Settle asked. Price, who had begun to weep, didn\u2019t know\nwhat to say, so she hesitated. \u201cOK,\u201d Settle said in response to her silence.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nSettle then called Kay to tell her that he wouldn\u2019t be coming home. \u201cI am not\ngoing to say any more, as we are both going to cry,\u201d he told his mom, though\nin truth he was already crying. Then he hung up the phone.\n\n## \u201cIt\u2019s a process I trust and believe in that failed me,\u201d Settle said. \u201cI\u2019m\nso glad the law exists even if it doesn\u2019t help me. It\u2019s my bad luck.\u201d\n\nI first requested a visit with Settle in April 2022, when Butner was still\noperating under tight restrictions because of COVID. In late summer, as case\nnumbers went down and social distancing eased, I filed another request.\nDespite persistent prodding, months went by without a response. Price wrote to\nthe BOP, reiterating that Settle had a right to speak to the press. \u201cMr.\nSettle is dying. Delay may be a denial,\u201d she noted. Finally, in December, I\nwas informed that I could have a one-hour visit with Settle. I would not be\nallowed to bring recording equipment.\n\nOn a bright, unseasonably warm January morning, I arrived in North Carolina\u2019s\nResearch Triangle. The sky was a limpid blue as I made my way to Butner, along\npine-forest-lined roads with entrances to the corporate facilities of Novo\nNordisk and Merck. When I turned onto Federal Center for Correctional Research\nRoad, I was trailing an ambulance. The complex was eerily quiet. No one was in\nthe yard, and no guards were visible.\n\nPassing through security, I noticed wood cutouts of motivational\nphrases\u2014Respect, Correctional Excellence, Integrity, Courage\u2014hanging on the\nwhite cinder block walls. A TV screen in one corner flashed the phrase\n\u201cKindness is giving hope to those who think they are all alone in the world.\u201d\nI was escorted to the visiting area by an officer wearing a bulletproof vest.\nGray chairs were tipped against tables and stacked against the wall. There was\nno one else there. I asked the officer if I could shake Settle\u2019s hand or hug\nhim when he arrived and was granted permission.\n\nSettle rolled into the room in his wheelchair wearing Timberland-style work\nboots and a jumpsuit with his name and prisoner ID number on the left breast.\nHe stood up to embrace me, then moved to a regular chair. We had spoken on the\nphone scores of times, totaling a dozen hours or more, and I felt like I knew\nhim well. But being in someone\u2019s presence always brings new knowledge of them.\nSettle\u2019s eyes were a bright golden brown, and his silver hair had been cut the\nday before, making it bristly.\n\nThe officer left us alone for the hour, and I decided to treat our meeting not\nas an interview but as a chance to be together. We talked about how angry\nSettle was when he first got to prison (\u201cI just wanted to punch someone\u2014I had\nno patience for anything\u201d) and about forgiveness, namely his difficulty\ngranting it to himself. He showed me photographs of his grandchildren and\nteared up when he talked about his mom, as he often did. He reflected on\nMendoza\u2019s denial and on the fact that he had allowed himself to hope for a\nbetter outcome.\n\nSince the visit we have remained in touch, and almost every time we speak,\nSettle talks about a new compassionate release case he\u2019s working on or another\nButner prisoner who finally made it home. He told me that his story is \u201cfairly\nwell known\u201d around Butner, and that people give him \u201cpitying looks.\u201d His\nfriends, both inside and out, are frustrated on his behalf. \u201cIt really saddens\nme to know that with all he\u2019s done for other people, and his medical condition\nnow, that he isn\u2019t at home with his family,\u201d Richard Hodge wrote in an email.\nFor her part, Price said, \u201cHe deserves better.\u201d\n\nSettle described compassionate release as \u201ca process I trust and believe in\nthat failed me.\u201d With his own path foreclosed, Settle will likely die in\nprison. His only chance for a different end to his story is clemency, about\nwhich he is understandably pessimistic: Clemency petitions move through the\nDepartment of Justice at a glacial pace\u2014it can be years before an answer\ncomes\u2014and a vanishingly small number are approved. The Trump administration\napproved only about 2 percent of the clemency requests it received, and the\nBiden administration is on track for roughly the same number. Still, Settle\nhas decided to submit a request, with the support of Price and others.\n\nLately, Settle has been wrestling with whether he should continue cancer\ntreatment. He has outlived his 18-month prognosis, and while his pain is\nconstant and his mobility compromised, a recent CT scan showed that his tumors\nhave stopped growing. His PSA has doubled, however, and doctors have\nrecommended further hormone therapy. He isn\u2019t sure he should bother. \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t come to a full decision yet on whether to fight,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore our visit at Butner, Settle sent me an essay he wrote\u2014the title, a nod\nto Viktor Frankl, was \u201cA man\u2019s search for a reason to live.\u201d In it, Settle\nreflected on his road to Butner and the toll of his cancer treatment, writing\nthat it had \u201cdevastated\u201d him physically and spiritually. \u201cMaybe the latter was\nbecause I could not rationalize why I was undergoing such debilitating\ntreatment when the effects of it were intended to extend my \u2018life,\u2019 \u201d he\nsurmised. \u201cThis is not to say that I felt like dying during that time, or now.\nBut my thoughts were simply, why? What do I have to look forward to?\u201d\n\nIn trying to answer this question, he found himself reflecting on the work\nhe\u2019d done with FAMM. By his count, he had helped 42 people secure\ncompassionate release. He wrote that he was glad to be part of an effort that\nbrought hope to people in a hopeless place, and was honored to have met Price,\nAndonian, and others. \u201cWith my life experience it is not surprising that I was\nunused to communicating and interacting with people of this caliber,\u201d Settle\nwrote. \u201cThat many of them have become dear and true friends is even more than\nsurprising, it is humbling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I hang around for a little while, who knows what impact I can have?\u201d he\nconcluded. \u201cIn testament to the love and respect I have for my friends and to\nhonor their work is reason enough for anyone to continue to live, even in\nhere.\u201d\n\n## More from The Atavist Magazine\n\n### The Devil Went Down to Georgia\n\n### Watch It Burn\n\n### Mayday\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Atavist Magazine.
