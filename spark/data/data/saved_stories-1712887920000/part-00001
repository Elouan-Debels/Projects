Let's find out if that holds\ntrue.Really there's no shortage of JS runtimes. There's already, Node. js,\nDeno, Bun and the recently covered by Iprogrammer LLRT by AWS;and that's not\nthe end of the list. So why a new runtime? What does it do differently?As a\nrefresher and to take the steam off the terminology, a runtime (WinterJS in\nthis case) is a place or environment where your code executes. It is not the\nthing running the code itself (this is the engine, SpiderMonkey in this case)\nbut rather an environment that provides access to certain parts of the outside\nworld.So WinterJS is actually the runtime of a Server that uses the\nSpiderMonkey engine to execute the JavaScript. The claim is that it's blazing\nfast; faster than Bun and Node. That stems from the fact that WinterJS is able\nto handle 150k requests/second when executed natively and 20k requests/second\nwhen compiled to Wasm using WASIX.As another refresher, WASIX is an extension\nto the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) designed to make WebAssembly (Wasm)\nmore compatible with POSIX programs, enabling the seamless execution of more\ncomplex applications in both the browser and server environments. It extends\nWASI with most of the missing POSIX features and is designed to run both in\nthe server and the browser.As such it provides full support for efficient\nmultithreading, sockets, current directory pthreads, process forking ,\nsubprocess spawning and waiting (exec, wait), TTY support, asynchronous\npolling of sockets and files, pipe and event support, etc.However, currently\nthe only runtime that supports WASIX is Wasmer, the makers of WinterJS. You\nsee the connection here. That might all sound fine but the performance drop of\nmore than 80% when deployed as WASM from that of Native, strikes me as\nsomething of importance. Can it do better?If affirmative then the time when\nyou can pack your full server into a single WASM binary and deploy it on the\ncloud would come a step closer. And provide further fuel to the Webassembly as\na replacement of Docker debate.Runtime wise, WinterJS is WinterCG complaint,\nwhich means that it can't be a drop-in replacement of Node.js, something\nobvious with just a glance at the Runtime compatibility comparison chart. If\nyou go on to check it you'll see that the supported APIs are not at par with\nNodejs's.More or less, this is something to be expected since Nodejs packs\nmore functionality than WinterCG. However as the trend wants, the newest\nruntimes being released are dedicated to a special purpose. As such to be more\nmemory savvy as well as fast, they throw a lot of functionality out. An\nexample of that we've examined in \"AWS Introduces A New JavaScript Runtime For\nLambda\" :LLRT is totally optimized for Lamda use. It really doesn't try to\ncompete with the rest; it's just made for a single purpose only, in the\ncontext of Lambda. This also means that its size is tiny, in the order of a\nfew kilobytes in contrast to the 20+MB required by its counterparts.WinterJS\nis then a library dedicated to and optimized for Web Servers.A server that\ncomes with full Cloudflare API compatibility. This was a conscious choice in\nthat this API is compatible with the most of the frontend frameworks and is\nprobably the most used out in the wild. This integration opened the door to a\nwide compatibility with Web frameworks such as :\n\n  * Next.js\n  * Next.js React Server Components\n  * Hono\n  * Astro.build\n  * Remix.run\n  * Svelte\n  * Gatsby\n  * Nuxt\n\nNow to coding. You can install WinterJS natively with:cargo install --git\nhttps://github.com/wasmerio/winterjs winterjsOnce you have WinterJS installed,\nyou can simply run the HTTP server:winterjs tests/simple. jsand then access\nthe server in https://localhost:8080/Alternatively to run it under Wasmer\n:wasmer run wasmer/winterjs --net --mapdir=tests:tests tests/simple.jsWhere\nsimple.js is:addEventListener('fetch', (req) => { req. respondWith(new\nResponse('hello')); });Your server application is now up and running!So that's\nyet another JavaScript runtime trying to attract your attention. What do you\nthink, has it managed to do so?\n\n#### More Information\n\nOfficial announcementWinterJS on Github\n\n#### Related Articles\n\nAWS Introduces A New JavaScript Runtime For LambdaTo be informed about new\narticles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the\nRSS feed and follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin.| Redis Changes\nLicense, Rival Fork Launched 03/04/2024The developers of Redis have announced\nthat they are changing the licensing model for the database.
