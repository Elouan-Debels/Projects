If you win that jackpot, you are big enough and\nrich enough to co-design hardware to work precisely for and efficiently with\nyour specific software, and vice versa.\n\nMeta is one of the giants of the metaverse \u2013 hence its name change a few years\nback from Facebook \u2013 and it is also one of the biggest innovators in and users\nof AI in the world. Both require a tremendous amount of compute. And even\nthough Meta Platforms will have spent somewhere around $15 billion for its\nfleet of 662,000 GPU accelerators \u2013 that is not the cost of systems, but just\nthe cost of the GPUs \u2013 between 2017 and 2024 to buttress its AI ambitions, the\ncompany knows that AI training and inference costs have got to come radically\ndown for the company to deploy AI at a larger scale than it currently wants\nto.\n\nAnd so the company began designing its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator\nin 2020, and after three years of work, last May the company launched the MTIA\nv1 based on a significantly enhanced RISC-V architecture. We did a deep dive\non MTIA v1, which was really aimed at AI inference workloads and particularly\non the deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) that drive the advertising\nand social networking applications in Facebook, Instagram, and other\napplications in the Meta stack.\n\nWith the MTIA v2 chip that was just revealed, Meta has built a much more\ncapable device, setting it further down the road towards its independence from\nexpensive and scarce GPU accelerators from Nvidia and AMD as well as other\nkinds of accelerators from myriad AI startups. And apparently it can be used\nfor both AI training and inference, at least for the recommendation engines\nthat drive a lot of Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nThe blog post announcing the MTIA v2 device was written by Eran Tal, Nicolaas\nViljoen, and Joel Coburn. Tal spent eight years at Nvidia in the 2000s and\neventually became a senior systems design engineer for desktop GPUs. In 2010,\nTal moved to Facebook to be a hardware engineer focusing on server design, did\na stint helping Facebook co-design a mobile phone with Taiwanese consumer\nelectronics maker HTC, was in charge of storage server designs for three years\na decade ago, and then took over the Open Compute Project\u2019s telecom hardware\nand software efforts (including OpenRAN). In April last year, Tal became\ndirector of hardware systems at Meta. Viljoen is the technical lead director\nof AI and network systems at Meta and was previously director of software\nengineering for DPU maker Netronome. Coburn has been a software engineer at\nMeta Platforms for over three years and was previously in the same position at\nGoogle for more than eight years. Suffice it to say, they know hardware and\nsoftware and the nexus where they come together \u2013 or don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThis chip\u2019s architecture is fundamentally focused on providing the right\nbalance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity for serving ranking\nand recommendation models,\u201d the three Meta techies wrote in the blog\nannouncing MTIA v2. \u201cIn inference, we need to be able to provide relatively\nhigh utilization, even when our batch sizes are relatively low. By focusing on\nproviding outsized SRAM capacity relative to typical GPUs, we can provide high\nutilization in cases where batch sizes are limited and provide enough compute\nwhen we experience larger amounts of potential concurrent work.\u201d\n\nHere is what the MTIA v2 chip looks like:\n\nAnd here is the block diagram of its various units, controllers, caches, and\ninterconnects:\n\nThe MTIA v1 chip was etched in the 7 nanometer processes from Taiwan\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Co and it had an area of 373 mm^2 (19.34 by 19.1\nmm^2); it ran at a mere 800 MHz. With the MTIA v2, the chip is etched using 5\nnanometer processes, and Meta cranked up the clock speed by 68.8 percent to\n1.35 GHz and made the chip much bigger \u2013 421 mm^2 (25.6 mm^2 by 16.4 mm^2) \u2013\nso it could jack up the SRAM on the chip. That 12.9 percent increase in area\nand 68.8 percent increase in clock speed drove up the power consumption by a\nfactor of 2.6X to 90 watts. Sparsity support was added to the PEs and in many\ncases the resulting performance was driven up by nearly 7X for matrix\noperations. On the vector cores, SIMD operation performance went up by 72.5\npercent, a tad bit better than the clock speed increase.\n\nAs with the MTIA v1, the MTIA v2 is an 8 x 8 grid of processing elements, or\nPEs. With the MTIA v1, those PEs were based on the RISC-V architecture, and\none core was designed to deal with scalar work and the other core had vector\nextensions to do operations on integer and floating point data.\n\nThe basic layout of the MTIA v2 is very similar to the MTIA v1. Both have a\ntotal of 64 PEs, which are wrapped on all sides with a crossbar fabric that\nlinks the PEs to DDR5 memory controllers, four on each side for a total of\nsixteen memory channels. Meta, like Nvidia with its \u201cGrace\u201d CG100 Arm server\nCPUs, has opted to use the LPDDR5 memory commonly used in laptops. (The LP is\nshort for low power.) With the MTIA v1, the off-chip LPDDR5 memory weighed in\nat 64 GB of capacity and 176 GB/sec of bandwidth across those sixteen\nchannels. With the MTIA v2, the capacity is doubled to 128 GB and the memory\nspeed is goosed by 16.4 percent, which boosts the bandwidth by the same amount\nto 204.8 GB/sec.\n\nMeta has not provided details on the architectural changes it has made inside\nof the PEs, but it did provide plenty of comparative stats:\n\nThe SRAM memory assigned to each PE in the MTIA v2 has been increased by 3X\ncompared to the MTIA v1, and the shared SRAM memory that spans all 64 cores\nhas been increase by a factor of 2X to 256 MB for the MTIA. Interestingly, the\nbandwidth on the local memory on each PE has been increased by a factor of\n2.5X to 1 TB/sec, and the bandwidth of that shared SRAM memory has been\nboosted by 3.4X to 2.7 TB/sec.\n\nThe MTIA v2 has a PCI-Express 5.0 x8 controller with 64 GB/sec of bandwidth to\nconnect to hosts through a PCI-Express switched fabric, and the MTIA v1 had a\nPCI-Express 4.0 x8 controller with 32 GB/sec of bandwidth. With the MTIA v1\ncards, there was one chip per card, but with the MTIA v2, there are two chips\nper card and they share a physical PCI-Express 5.0 x16 connector to attach to\na host. Like this:\n\nThe four black blocks surrounding each MTIA v2 chip are the LPDDR5 memory\nbanks, which are 32 GB each. (Meta made that image look all fuzzy at the\nedges, we did not.)\n\nMeta is putting a dozen of these cards into a single chassis, for a total of\n24 MTIA v2 chips per enclosure; three of these chasses go into a rack for a\ntotal of 72 accelerators per rack. PCI-Express 5.0 switching is used to link\nthe accelerators to each other and to hosts within a rack, and there is an\noption to have the enclosures use a network interface card with RDMA (it could\nbe InfiniBand, but it is probably Ethernet with RoCE). That is 6.5 kilowatts\nfor the accelerators per rack, for just under 50 petaflops of INT8 inference\nperformance on GEMM calculations with sparsity on. (The MTIA v2 is rated at\n708 teraops INT with sparsity.)\n\nAn Nvidia \u201cTuring\u201d T4 accelerator, weighing in at 70 watts, can do 130 INT8\nteraops or 260 INT4 teraops and probably costs around $1,500. An Nvidia\n\u201cHopper\u201d H100 can do 4 petaflops at FP8 precision, which is admittedly a lot.\nBut it takes 700 watts to do that and it costs at least $30,000 per H100. The\nH100 has lots more memory bandwidth, but not as much memory capacity.\n\nThe MTIA v2 does 5.5X more INT8 inference work than the T4 for 1.3X more power\nconsumed. The H100 does 5.7X more work, but consumes 7.8X more power and\nprobably costs anywhere from 10X to 15X as much if Meta can make the MTIA v2\ncards for somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000, as we expect.\n\nAll of this hardware brings us all the way back to the co-design with the Meta\nsoftware stack, which runs AI inference and training atop the PyTorch\nframework that it created and open sourced:\n\nIt is interesting that this software stack includes the open source Triton\nlanguage and compiler \u2013 which is not to be confused with Nvidia\u2019s Triton\ninference server that is part of its AI Enterprise stack. This Triton was\ncreated by researchers at Harvard University and IBM back in 2019 and open\nsourced by OpenAI in 2021 when it was still open for everything but business.\n\nTriton is a Python-like, C-based language for creating machine learning\nkernels that can get the kind of performance that highly tailored libraries in\nthe Nvidia CUDA stack \u2013 which take a lot more effort to create and use \u2013 can\nget on hardware. One of the important things that Meta has done with MTIA is\nto make sure it is compatible with the Triton language.\n\nWe would love to see how the MTIA v2 is being used to train models, or tune\npretrained models.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.
