To\n> accelerate research and reduce the cost of experiments, we introduce\n> training methods for CIFAR-10 which reach 94% accuracy in 3.29 seconds, 95%\n> in 10.4 seconds, and 96% in 46.3 seconds, when run on a single NVIDIA A100\n> GPU. As one factor contributing to these training speeds, we propose a\n> derandomized variant of horizontal flipping augmentation, which we show\n> improves over the standard method in every case where flipping is beneficial\n> over no flipping at all.
