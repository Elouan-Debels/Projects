In Switzerland, where Nestl\u00e9 is\nheadquartered, such products are sold with no added sugar. These are the main\nfindings of a new investigation by Public Eye and the International Baby Food\nAction Network (IBFAN), which shed light on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s hypocrisy and the\ndeceptive marketing strategies deployed by the Swiss food giant.\n\nMeagan Adonis was 23 when she became blind as a result of a serious health\ncondition. That same year she found out that she was pregnant, and was worried\nabout the challenges of being a blind mum. She has now found her motherhood\nfeet, and recently gave birth to a second child. Based in Johannesburg, South\nAfrica, the \u201cblind goddess\u201d \u2013 as she calls herself \u2013 now documents her life\nfor more than 125,000 followers on social media and chronicles her daily\nroutine with her new baby.\n\nLast year, Meagan posted several videos on TikTok promoting Cerelac infant\ncereals for babies from six months of age. \u201cAs you can see, I have a very\nactive baby\u201d, she explains in a video in December. \u201cAs a blind mum, feeding\ntime is always an adventure! [...] Now let\u2019s go and prepare his favourite meal\nof the day. Little bodies need big support with Nestl\u00e9 Cerelac being the\nperfect addition to our mealtime,\u201d she assures her audience in a cheerful tone\n\u2013 while omitting to mention that this maternal counsel comes as part of a paid\npartnership with Nestl\u00e9.\n\nThousands of kilometres away, in Guatemala, a father films his energetic\nlittle daughter. \u201cThere\u2019s no greater satisfaction than seeing a strong,\nhealthy child\u201d, says Billy Saavedra, a reggaeton artist better known as Billy\nthe Diamond. \u201cThat\u2019s why we prefer Nido 1+, which supports the development of\nher bones and muscles, as well as her immune system\u201d, he adds in a video\npromoting the brand\u2019s formulas for young children in March on his Instagram\naccount, which has more than 550,000 followers.\n\nThe use of influencers, such as Meagan or Billy (and their children), is at\nthe core of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s marketing strategy to boost sales of its baby foods. This\napproach, which has become increasingly important in many sectors, allows\ncompanies to reach a broad audience, building on a sense of identification and\nrelatability. Coming from parents with similar experiences, advertising\nmessages are regarded as benevolent advice that can be trusted.\n\n## A growing market\n\nFifty years after the \u201cbaby killers\u201d infant formula scandal, Nestl\u00e9 claims to\nhave learned from the past and proclaims its \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to the\n\u201cresponsible marketing\u201d of breast-milk substitutes.\n\nCover of the \u201cThe baby killer\u201d brochure \u00a9 War on Want / Mike Muller\n\nCover of the \u201cThe baby killer\u201d brochure \u00a9 War on Want / Mike Muller\n\nThe food giant is doing everything it can to present itself as the world\nleader in infant nutrition, meticulously targeting each stage in a child\u2019s\nfirst years of life. It currently controls 20 percent of the baby-food market,\nvalued at nearly $70 billion.\n\nCerelac and Nido are some of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s best-selling baby-food brands in low-\nand middle-income countries. According to exclusive data obtained from\nEuromonitor, a market analysis firm specializing in the food industry, their\nsales value in this category was greater than $2.5 billion in 2022.\n\nIn its own communications or via third parties, Nestl\u00e9 promotes Cerelac and\nNido as brands whose aim is to help children \u201clive healthier lives\u201d. Fortified\nwith vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, these products are,\naccording to the multinational, tailored to the needs of babies and young\nchildren and help to strengthen their growth, immune system and cognitive\ndevelopment.\n\nBut do these infant cereals and powdered milks really offer \u201cthe best\nnutrition,\u201d as Nestl\u00e9 claims? That\u2019s what Public Eye and the International\nBaby Food Action Network (IBFAN) wanted to find out, by focusing on one of the\nkey public enemies when it comes to nutrition: sugar.\n\n## An unjustifiable double standard\n\n\u00a9 Trevor Patt (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 DEED)\n\n\u00a9 Trevor Patt (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 DEED)\n\nSpoiler alert: Our investigation shows that, for Nestl\u00e9, not all babies are\nequal when it comes to added sugar. While in Switzerland, where the company is\nheadquartered, the main infant cereals and formula brands sold by the\nmultinational come without added sugar, most Cerelac and Nido products\nmarketed in lower-income countries do contain added sugar, often at high\nlevels.\n\nFor example, in Switzerland, Nestl\u00e9 promotes its biscuit-flavoured cereals for\nbabies aged from six months with the claim \u201cno added sugar\u201d, while in Senegal\nand South Africa, Cerelac cereals with the same flavour contain 6 grams of\nadded sugar per serving.\n\nIn Switzerland, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s biscuit-flavoured baby cereal contains no added\nsugar. In South Africa and Senegal, Cerelac products of the same flavour\ncontain more than one cube of sugar per serving. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\nIn Switzerland, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s biscuit-flavoured baby cereal contains no added\nsugar. In South Africa and Senegal, Cerelac products of the same flavour\ncontain more than one cube of sugar per serving. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\nSimilarly, in Germany, France and the UK \u2013 Nestl\u00e9\u2019s main European markets \u2013\nall formulas for young children aged 12-36 months sold by the company contain\nno added sugar. And while some infant cereals for young children over one year\nold contain added sugar, cereals for babies aged six months do not.\n\nCerelac wheat-based cereals for six-month-old babies sold by Nestl\u00e9 in Germany\nand the UK has no added sugar, while the same product contains over 5 grams\nper serving in Ethiopia and 6 grams in Thailand.\n\n\u201cThere is a double standard here that can\u2019t be justified,\u201d said Nigel Rollins,\nscientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), when presented with our\nfindings. For Rollins, the fact that Nestl\u00e9 does not add sugar to these\nproducts in Switzerland but is quite happy to do it in lower resources\nsettings \u201cis problematic both from a public health and ethical perspective.\u201d\nRollins says that manufacturers may try to get children accustomed to a\ncertain level of sugar at a very early age, so that they prefer products high\nin sugar. \u201cThis is totally inappropriate,\u201d he believes.\n\nCerelac baby cereals wheat are sold with no added sugar in Germany and the UK.\nIn lower income countries, but the same product comes with high levels of\nadded sugar. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\nCerelac baby cereals wheat are sold with no added sugar in Germany and the UK.\nIn lower income countries, but the same product comes with high levels of\nadded sugar. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\n## On the trail of hidden sugar\n\nThe amount of added sugar is often not even disclosed in the nutritional\ninformation available on the packaging of these kinds of products. In most\ncountries, including Switzerland and across Europe, companies are only\nrequired to indicate the amount of total sugars, which also includes those\nnaturally present in milk or whole fruit, and are not considered harmful to\nhealth.\n\nWhile Nestl\u00e9 prominently highlights the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients\ncontained in its products using idealizing imagery, it\u2019s not transparent when\nit comes to added sugar. To uncover these \u201chidden sugars,\u201d we obtained Cerelac\nand Nido products from a number of countries to examine their labels and, in\nsome cases, have them analyzed by a specialized laboratory.\n\nIn Brazil, one of the main markets, Cerelac baby cereals are sold under the\nbrand name \u201cMucilon\u201d. The added sugar content is not declared. \u00a9 Anne-Laure\nLechat\n\nIn Brazil, one of the main markets, Cerelac baby cereals are sold under the\nbrand name \u201cMucilon\u201d. The added sugar content is not declared. \u00a9 Anne-Laure\nLechat\n\nThis turned out to be more complicated than expected. Several laboratories\napproached in Switzerland refused to conduct the sugar analysis of Nestl\u00e9\nproducts. One lab even wrote that it could not take part in the project\nbecause the results \u201ccould potentially have a negative impact\u201d on its existing\ncustomers. Stonewalled, we decided to approach a lab based in Belgium. The\nresults are edifying.\n\n## One sugar cube per portion\n\nCerelac is the world\u2019s number one baby cereal brand, with sales exceeding $1\nbillion in 2022, according to Euromonitor. We examined 115 products sold in\nNestl\u00e9\u2019s main markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America. No less than 108 of\nthem (94 percent) contained added sugar.\n\nFor 67 of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added sugar.\nOn average, our analysis found almost 4 grams per serving, or about one sugar\ncube. The highest amount \u2013 7.3 grams per serving \u2013 was detected in a product\nsold in the Philippines and targeted at six-month-old babies.\n\nIn India, where sales surpassed $250 million in 2022, all Cerelac baby cereals\ncontain added sugar, on average nearly 3 grams per serving. The same situation\nprevails in South Africa, the main market on the African continent, where all\nCerelac baby cereals contain four grams or more of added sugar per serving. In\nBrazil, the world\u2019s second-largest market, with sales of around $150 million\nin 2022, three-quarters of Cerelac baby cereals (known as Mucilon in the\ncountry) contain added sugar, on average 3 grams per serving.\n\nThis product, sold in the Philippines and intended for six-month-old babies,\ncontains almost two cubes of sugar per serving. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\nThis product, sold in the Philippines and intended for six-month-old babies,\ncontains almost two cubes of sugar per serving. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\n\u201cThis is a big concern,\u201d comments Rodrigo Vianna, epidemiologist and Professor\nat the Department of Nutrition of the Federal University of Para\u00edba in Brazil.\n\u201cSugar should not be added to foods offered to babies and young children\nbecause it is unnecessary and highly addictive. Children get used to the sweet\ntaste and start looking for more sugary foods, starting a negative cycle that\nincreases the risk of nutrition-based disorders in adult life. These include\nobesity and other chronic non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes or high\nblood-pressure,\u201d laments the expert.\n\n## \u201cA form of colonization\u201d\n\nAlthough less pronounced, this trend is confirmed with the Nido brand, the\nmost popular on the growing-up milks market. In 2022, global sales of Nido\nproducts for young children aged one to three had exceeded $1 billion\naccording to Euromonitor. We examined 29 of these products sold by Nestl\u00e9 in\nsome of the main markets in low- and middle-income countries. The result: 21\nof them (72 percent) contain added sugar.\n\nFor ten of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added\nsugar. On average, our analysis found almost two grams per serving. The\nmaximum value \u2013 5.3 grams per serving \u2013 was detected in a product sold in\nPanama.\n\nHere are some of the Nido products examined in this investigation. On average,\nthey contain almost 2 grams of added sugar per serving. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\nHere are some of the Nido products examined in this investigation. On average,\nthey contain almost 2 grams of added sugar per serving. \u00a9 Anne-Laure Lechat\n\nWith sales at around $400 million in 2022, Indonesia is the world\u2019s leading\nmarket for Nido, known locally as Dancow. The two products for children aged\none and over sold in the country contain added sugar \u2013 more than 0.7 grams per\nserving.\n\nWhile the multinational is quick to highlight that these products are \u201cwithout\nadded sucrose,\u201d they do contain added sugar in the form of honey. However,\nhoney and sucrose are both considered by the WHO as sugars that should not be\nadded to baby food. Indeed, Nestl\u00e9 itself explains it very well in an\neducational quiz on Nido\u2019s website in South-Africa: replacing sucrose with\nhoney has \u201cno scientific health benefit\u201d, as both can contribute \u201cto weight\ngain and possibly obesity\u201d.\n\nIn Brazil, the world\u2019s second-largest market for Nido, Nestl\u00e9 claims not to\nadd sugar to its products out of concern for children\u2019s health and diet: \u201cIt\u2019s\nideal to avoid consuming these ingredients in childhood, as the sweet flavour\ncan influence a child\u2019s preference for this type of food in the future,\u201d warns\nthe food giant on the brand\u2019s website in Brazil.\n\nA shop covered with Nido products in Managua (Nicaragua). \u00a9 Laurent Gaberell\n\nA shop covered with Nido products in Managua (Nicaragua). \u00a9 Laurent Gaberell\n\nHowever, in most Central American countries, where Nestl\u00e9 aggressively\npromotes Nido using influencers, the formulas for children aged one year and\nabove contain over a sugar cube per serving. In Nigeria, Senegal, Bangladesh\nand South Africa \u2013 where Nido is very popular \u2013 all products for young\nchildren aged one to three contain added sugar.\n\n\u201cI do not understand why products for sale in South Africa should be different\nfrom those that are sold in high-income settings,\u201d states Karen Hofman,\nProfessor of Public Health at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg\nand a qualified paediatrician. \u201cIt is a form of colonization and should not be\ntolerated,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere is no valid reason to add sugar to baby food\nanywhere,\u201d Hofman insists.\n\n## The first two years of life\n\nThis view is shared by the WHO, which has warned for several years now about\nthe high added-sugar content in baby-food products. \u201cThis study stresses the\nneed for urgent action to reshape the food environment for children,\u201d Dr\nFrancesco Branca, Director of the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety,\ntold Public Eye and IBFAN. \u201cEliminating added sugars from food products for\nyoung children would be an important way to implement early prevention of\nobesity.\u201d\n\nThe WHO is alarmed that obesity is dramatically on the rise, particularly in\nlow- and middle-income countries, where it has now reached \u201cepidemic\nproportions\u201d and is fuelling an increase of non-communicable diseases such as\ncardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Increased consumption of ultra-\nprocessed foods, often high in sugar, is singled out as one of the main causes\nof this epidemic.\n\nYoungest children are not immune to this scourge: childhood obesity has\nincreased tenfold over the past four decades, according to the UN agency. It\u2019s\nestimated that 39 million children under the age of 5 are overweight or obese,\nthe vast majority of which live in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\u201cThe first two years of a child\u2019s life are particularly important, as optimal\nnutrition during this period lowers morbidity and mortality, reduces the risk\nof chronic disease, and fosters better development overall,\u201d explains the WHO.\nIn 2022, the UN agency called for a ban on added sugars and sweeteners in food\nproducts for babies and children under the age of three, and urged industry to\n\u201cbe proactive\u201d and \u201csupport public health goals\u201d by reformulating its baby\nfood products.\n\nBut Nestl\u00e9 seems to be turning a deaf ear to these appeals. While the\nmultinational publicly recommends avoiding baby foods containing added sugar,\nthese wise words don\u2019t seem to apply to low- and middle-income countries,\nwhere Nestl\u00e9 continues to add high levels of sugar to some of its most popular\nproducts.\n\nNestl\u00e9 did not respond to specific questions about this double standard. But\nthe company told Public Eye and IBFAN that it \u201chas reduced by 11% the total\namount of added sugars in [its] infant cereal portfolio worldwide\u201d over the\npast decade and that it will \u201cfurther reduce the level of added sugars without\ncompromising on quality, safety and taste\u201d. Nestl\u00e9 also indicated that it is\nphasing out sucrose and glucose syrup of its Nido \u201cgrowing up milks\u201d globally.\nThe company added that its products \u201cfully comply\u201d with the Codex Alimentarius\nand local laws.\n\n## Weak regulation\n\nThese baby-food products with added sugar are permitted under national\nlegislation despite the fact that they go against WHO guidelines. National\nlegislation is often based on the Codex Alimentarius, a collection of\ninternational standards developed by an intergovernmental commission based in\nRome. The stated aim is to protect consumers\u2019 health and ensure fair practices\nin the food trade. These standards, which gained importance as reference\npoints for trade disputes following the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganisation in 1995, tolerate added sugar in baby foods up to certain limits\nspecific for each type of product \u2013 up to 20 percent in infant cereals.\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission meeting in Rome. \u00a9 FAO / Alessandra Benedetti\n\nCodex Alimentarius Commission meeting in Rome. \u00a9 FAO / Alessandra Benedetti\n\nCodex standards for baby foods have been strongly criticized by the WHO, which\ndeems them \u201cinadequate\u201d, particularly concerning sugar, as children establish\ntheir food preferences early in life. The agency has called for the standards\nto be updated and brought into line with WHO guidelines, with a particular\nfocus on banning the addition of sugars. Current Codex standards are\ninsufficient to determine whether a food is appropriate for promotion for\ninfants and young children, according to the UN agency.\n\n\u201cWHO recommendations are independent of all industry influence,\u201d Nigel Rollins\ntold Public Eye and IBFAN. \u201cAt Codex, you have substantive lobbying: the sugar\nindustry, the baby-food industry, and others are all present in the rooms\nwhere the decisions are taken.\u201d Although the Codex Commission is an\nintergovernmental body, industry representatives may participate as observers,\nor even as members of national delegations. At a recent review of the standard\nfor follow-up formula, industry lobbyists accounted for over 40 percent of\nparticipants. For Rollins, this is the main reason why Codex standards \u2013 and\nby extension national laws \u2013 are less protective than WHO guidelines.\n\n## Controversial marketing practices\n\nOur investigation shows that Nestl\u00e9 uses aggressive marketing methods to\npromote Nido and Cerelac in low- and middle-income countries, despite the\nWHO\u2019s International Code which prohibits the commercial promotion of such\nproducts. The Code, originally adopted in 1981 in the wake of the \u201cbaby\nkillers\u201d scandal, and clarified and strengthened by later Resolutions, bans\nall promotion of infant formula in order to protect breastfeeding. The ban\nalso applies to formulas for young children and baby foods that, like Cerelac,\ndo not meet nutrition guidelines and contain \u201chigh levels of sugar\u201d.\n\nNestl\u00e9 responds that it \u201ccomplies with the WHO Code and subsequent WHA\nresolutions as implemented by national governments everywhere in the world.\u201d\n\u201cWhere local law is less stringent than our Policy for implementing the Code,\nwe adhere to our strict Policy,\u201d Nestl\u00e9 adds.\n\nIn practice, while 70% of countries have adopted laws based on the Code, many\ncontain loopholes and implementation is generally weak in low- and middle-\nincome countries, often as a result of pressures from the baby-food industry\nand exporting countries. Furthermore, the Nestl\u00e9 policy neither applies to\nformulas for children aged one year or more, nor to other baby foods, although\nthese are all covered by the Code.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Nestl\u00e9 promotes its Nido and Cerelac products as healthy and\nessential for children\u2019s development, although they contain added sugar and\ncarry many risks for children\u2019s health and development. \u201cOften manufacturers\u2019\nhealth claims are not supported by the science,\u201d says Rollins, in response to\nreading our report. \u201cIf you have a pharmaceutical product for which you want\nto claim that it improves brain development in babies, or improve growth in\nbabies, you would have to pass very high standards of evidence,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cBut because it\u2019s a food, you don\u2019t have to pass those standards.\u201d\n\nIn Central and West Africa, Nestl\u00e9 is active on Facebook with a page called\n\u201cNido Mums\u201d.\n\nIn Central and West Africa, Nestl\u00e9 is active on Facebook with a page called\n\u201cNido Mums\u201d.\n\nNutrition and health claims \u201cidealize the product, imply that it is better\nthan family foods, and mask the risks,\u201d the WHO explained in a recent report\nthat warns of baby-food marketing practices that compromise the progress made\nin infant and young-child nutrition. They mislead consumers as to the real\ncontent of these foods and should not be made, according to the UN agency. Yet\nNestl\u00e9 has made them a core pillar of its marketing strategy.\n\n## \u201cGrow smart\u201d\n\n\u201cGrow smart\u201d. Huge billboards in the centre of Jakarta and other main\nIndonesian cities display the slogan. It\u2019s at the heart of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s campaign\nto promote its Nido brand, known in the country as Dancow, as the \u201cparents\u2019\npartner for children\u2019s growth and development\u201d. \u201cInspired by mum\u2019s love for\nbaby nutrition, Dancow is the healthiest choice\u201d, claims Nestl\u00e9, while failing\nto disclose that its product contains added sugar.\n\n\u201cGrow smart\u201d.

The campaign managed to engage 2\nmillion mothers in sharing \u201cexciting moments\u201d with their children on social\nmedia, effectively turning them into unpaid advertisers and brand ambassadors.\n\u201cThank you @dancow for accompanying my child\u2019s growth and development,\u201d writes\none of the mothers.\n\nNestl\u00e9 deploys the same, finely honed strategy in Brazil to promote its\nCerelac (Mucilon) infant cereal brand. Its campaign is based on the concept of\n\u201cnutrition enriched by Mucilon and chosen by mothers,\u201d muses Dani Ribeiro,\ndirector of the advertising agency in charge. It plays on parents\u2019 love for\ntheir babies, and highlights \u201cthe benefits of nutrients that contribute to\nbabies\u2019 immunity and brain development,\u201d she explains. \u201cParents are nourished\nby the fact that they are making the right choice for their children,\u201d Ribeiro\nadds.\n\nIn Brazil, Nestl\u00e9 promotes Cerelac (Mucilon) baby cereals as being rich in\nnutrients which contribute to children's immunity and cerebral development.\n\nIn South Africa, Nestl\u00e9 promotes Cerelac as a source of 12 essential vitamins\nand minerals under the theme \u201clittle bodies need big support\u201d. \u201cFor over 150\nyears, generations of parents have trusted Nestl\u00e9 Cerelac to provide just what\ntheir baby needs,\u201d trumpets the multinational. Yet all Cerelac products sold\nin this country, which is facing a veritable obesity epidemic, contain high\nlevels of added sugar.\n\nFor over 150 years, generations of parents have trusted NESTL\u00c9\u00ae CERELAC\u00ae to\nprovide just what their baby needs. #LittleBodiesNeedBigSupport.\n\nIn South Africa, Nestl\u00e9 is promoting Cerelac baby cereals under the theme\n\"little bodies need big support\". All products contain a minimum of one cube\nof added sugar per serving.\n\nChris Van Tulleken, Professor at the University of London and author of the\nbest-selling book Ultra-Processed People, which explores the pervasiveness and\nimpact of ultra-processed food, is extremely concerned about the marketing\nstrategy used by Nestl\u00e9. \u201cThese are not healthy products. They are not\nnecessary. They are inferior to real food,\u201d he stated. \u201cThese types of\nproducts are part of a global nutrition transition to an ultra-processed diet\nwhich is associated with weight gain and obesity, but also many other adverse\nhealth outcomes.\"\n\n## An \u201ceducational\u201d platform\n\nNestl\u00e9 pioneered \u201cmedical marketing,\u201d involving a set of techniques that have\nbecome standard practice in the industry today, says Phillip Baker, a senior\nresearch fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia and author of\nnumerous studies on the subject. The strategy is based on strengthening links\nwith health professionals and obtaining the endorsement of leading scientific\nauthorities, while positioning the company as a partner for parents in the\nnutrition and development of their children.\n\nWhile the main goal is to increase sales on the baby-food market itself, it\nplays another key role for Nestl\u00e9: developing loyal consumers for life. Baker\ndescribes it as a \u201ccradle-to-grave marketing strategy.\u201d \u201cThe idea being to get\nconsumers from a very young age, develop that brand loyalty, develop those\ntaste preferences for their products\u201d, he explains.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has created Baby and Me, an \u201ceducational platform\u201d available in over 60\ncountries, with the stated aim of promoting healthy eating for babies and\noffering \u201cexpert-backed\u201d information. Parents looking for information on\ninfant nutrition may be directed to this platform and be exposed to content\nthat steers them towards Nestl\u00e9 products.\n\nNestl\u00e9 has created the \u201cBaby and Me\u201d educational platform, whose stated aim is\nto promote healthy eating for babies and provide information that is \u201cexpert-\nbacked\u201d.

Mexico has an allergy calculator and Brazil a guide to\nfinding the perfect name. These websites are packed with advice, tools and\nrecipes designed to attract parents. But ads for Nestl\u00e9 products and \u201cbuy now\u201d\nbuttons are never far away.\n\n## Experts in white coats\n\nNestl\u00e9 regularly organizes events on the Nido and Cerelac online channels with\nhealth professionals. Although most of the time the experts speak about child-\nnutrition related issues and do not directly promote the products, the Nido\nand Cerelac brands feature prominently, leading parents to believe that these\nproducts are endorsed by eminent scientific authorities and that Nestl\u00e9\u2019s\nhealth and nutrition claims have scientific support.\n\nOur investigation also uncovered cases of experts in white coats directly\npromoting Nestl\u00e9 products. \u201cNido\u2019s specialized nutrition system is designed to\nprotect every stage of your child\u2019s development,\u201d explains nutritionist Kenia\nLawrence in a video posted on Instagram in Panama. \u201cNido1+ helps protect and\nstrengthen the immune system, thanks to probiotics and prebiotics, and\ncontains key nutrients for child development.\u201d Not a word on the one and a\nhalf sugar cubes added to each portion of the product in question.\n\nFor Baker, it is evident that \u201cby using health professionals, the companies\npowerfully shape parents\u2019 decision making\u201d. An influence that \u201ccan very often\nbe harmful,\u201d he believes. This practice also goes against WHO guidelines,\nwhich state that manufacturers must not encourage healthcare professionals to\nsupport and recommend their brands and products.\n\nIn a recent report, the UN agency severely criticized the marketing practices\nused by the baby-food industry to promote its products online, pointing the\nfinger at the use of various strategies that are often not identifiable as\nadvertising. These include the use of baby-clubs, as well as the use of health\nprofessionals and influencers such as Meagan Adonis and Billy Saavedra. The UN\nagency called on manufacturers to put an end to their \u201cexploitative marketing\npractices\u201d.\n\nNothing can justify the double standards highlighted by the Public Eye and\nIBFAN investigation. If Nestl\u00e9 truly intends to act responsibly, it must\nfollow the recommendations and guidelines of the WHO and stop getting babies\nand young children hooked on sugar, regardless of the country in which they\nwere born.\n\nSwiss NGO Public Eye offers a critical analysis of the impact that\nSwitzerland, and its companies, has on economically disadvantaged countries.\nThrough research, advocacy and campaigning, Public Eye also demands the\nrespect of human rights and of the environment throughout the world. With a\nstrong support of some 28,000 members, Public Eye focuses on global justice.\nReports like this one are only possible thanks to the people who support us:\nwith a donation, you help us remain entirely independent.\n\n### Imprint\n\nText: Laurent Gaberell, Manuel Abebe, Patti Rundall English translation:\nManuel Abebe Editing: alphadoc Web implementation: Fabian Lang, Rebekka K\u00f6ppel\n\n### The latest Public Eye Investigations\n\n  * #### High hopes, low prices\n\nHow Nestl\u00e9 is driving Mexican coffee farmers to ruin\n\n  * #### The curse of the sapphire\n\nMadagascar sapphires: a blessing for Swiss jewellers, but a curse for miners\n\n  * #### Swiss Re in Brazil\n\nBenefitting from a public subsidy, Swiss Re profits in Brazil from insurance\non illegally deforested lands\n\n  * #### \u2018Water is sacred too\u2019\n\nHow a pesticide banned in Europe robbed a Costa Rican town of its drinking\nwater\n\n  * #### Coal mining in Indonesia\n\nThe dirty practices of a Zug-based mining group in Borneo\n\n  * #### Poisonous coal in Australia\n\nResistance to Glencore and Adani coal mines in Australia\n\n  * #### How Switzerland danced to the Nestl\u00e9 tune\n\nAgainst warning labels on junk food in Mexico\n\nTopBuilt with Shorthand\n\n", "frontpage": true}
