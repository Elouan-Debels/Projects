It started at a Burger-G restaurant in Cary, NC on May 17. It seemed\nlike such a simple thing at the time, but May 17 marked a pivotal moment in\nhuman history.\n\nBurger-G was a fast food chain that had come out of nowhere starting with its\nfirst restaurant in Cary. The Burger-G chain had an attitude and a style that\nsaid \u201chip\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d to a wide swath of the American middle class. The chain\nwas able to grow with surprising speed based on its popularity and the public\npersona of the young founder, Joe Garcia. Over time, Burger-G grew to 1,000\noutlets in the U.S. and showed no signs of slowing down. If the trend\ncontinued, Burger-G would soon be one of the \u201cTop 5\u201d fast food restaurants in\nthe U.S.\n\nThe \u201crobot\u201d installed at this first Burger-G restaurant looked nothing like\nthe robots of popular culture. It was not hominid like C-3PO or futuristic\nlike R2-D2 or industrial like an assembly line robot. Instead it was simply a\nPC sitting in the back corner of the restaurant running a piece of software.\nThe software was called \u201cManna\u201d, version 1.0^*.\n\nManna\u2019s job was to manage the store, and it did this in a most interesting\nway. Think about a normal fast food restaurant. A group of employees worked at\nthe store, typically 50 people in a normal restaurant, and they rotated in and\nout on a weekly schedule. The people did everything from making the burgers to\ntaking the orders to cleaning the tables and taking out the trash. All of\nthese employees reported to the store manager and a couple of assistant\nmanagers. The managers hired the employees, scheduled them and told them what\nto do each day. This was a completely normal arrangement. In the early twenty-\nfirst century, there were millions of businesses that operated in this way.\n\nBut the fast food industry had a problem, and Burger-G was no different. The\nproblem was the quality of the fast food experience. Some restaurants were run\nperfectly. They had courteous and thoughtful crew members, clean restrooms,\ngreat customer service and high accuracy on the orders. Other restaurants were\nchaotic and uncomfortable to customers. Since one bad experience could turn a\ncustomer off to an entire chain of restaurants, these poorly-managed stores\nwere the Achilles heel of any chain.\n\nTo solve the problem, Burger-G contracted with a software consultant and\ncommissioned a piece of software. The goal of the software was to replace the\nmanagers and tell the employees what to do in a more controllable way. Manna\nversion 1.0 was born.\n\nManna was connected to the cash registers, so it knew how many people were\nflowing through the restaurant. The software could therefore predict with\nuncanny accuracy when the trash cans would fill up, the toilets would get\ndirty and the tables needed wiping down. The software was also attached to the\ntime clock, so it knew who was working in the restaurant. Manna also had \u201chelp\nbuttons\u201d throughout the restaurant. Small signs on the buttons told customers\nto push them if they needed help or saw a problem. There was a button in the\nrestroom that a customer could press if the restroom had a problem. There was\na button on each trashcan. There was a button near each cash register, one in\nthe kiddie area and so on. These buttons let customers give Manna a heads up\nwhen something went wrong.\n\nAt any given moment Manna had a list of things that it needed to do. There\nwere orders coming in from the cash registers, so Manna directed employees to\nprepare those meals. There were also toilets to be scrubbed on a regular\nbasis, floors to mop, tables to wipe, sidewalks to sweep, buns to defrost,\ninventory to rotate, windows to wash and so on. Manna kept track of the\nhundreds of tasks that needed to get done, and assigned each task to an\nemployee one at a time.\n\nManna told employees what to do simply by talking to them. Employees each put\non a headset when they punched in. Manna had a voice synthesizer, and with its\nsynthesized voice Manna told everyone exactly what to do through their\nheadsets. Constantly. Manna micro-managed minimum wage employees to create\nperfect performance.\n\nPrefer the Kindle? \u201cManna\u201d is now available on the Kindle \u2013 Click here!  \n---  \n  \nThe software would speak to the employees individually and tell each one\nexactly what to do. For example, \u201cBob, we need to load more patties. Please\nwalk toward the freezer.\u201d\n\nOr, \u201cJane, when you are through with this customer, please close your\nregister. Then we will clean the women\u2019s restroom.\u201d\n\nAnd so on. The employees were told exactly what to do, and they did it quite\nhappily. It was a major relief actually, because the software told them\nprecisely what to do step by step.\n\nFor example, when Jane entered the restroom, Manna used a simple position\ntracking system built into her headset to know that she had arrived. Manna\nthen told her the first step.\n\nManna: \u201cPlace the \u2018wet floor\u2019 warning cone outside the door please.\u201d\n\nWhen Jane completed the task, she would speak the word \u201cOK\u201d into her headset\nand Manna moved to the next step in the restroom cleaning procedure.\n\nManna: \u201cPlease block the door open with the door stop.\u201d\n\nJane: \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nManna: \u201cPlease retrieve the bucket and mop from the supply closet.\u201d\n\nJane: \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nAnd so on.\n\nOnce the restroom was clean, Manna would direct Jane to put everything away.\nManna would make sure that she carefully washed her hands. Then Manna would\nimmediately start Jane working on a new task. Meanwhile, Manna might send Lisa\nto the restroom to inspect it and make sure that Jane had done a thorough job.\nManna would ask Lisa to check the toilets, the floor, the sink and the\nmirrors. If Jane missed anything, Lisa would report it.\n\nI grew up in Cary, NC. That was a long time ago, but when I was a kid I lived\nright in the middle of Cary with my parents. My father was a pilot for a big\nairline. My mother was a stay-at-home mom and I had a younger sister. We lived\nin a typical four bedroom suburban home in a nice neighborhood with a swimming\npool in the backyard. I was a 15 year-old teenager working at the Burger-G on\nMay 17 when the first Manna system came online.\n\nI can remember putting on the headset for the first time and the computer\ntalking to me and telling me what to do. It was creepy at first, but that\nfeeling really only lasted a day or so. Then you were used to it, and the job\nreally did get easier. Manna never pushed you around, never yelled at you. The\ngirls liked it because Manna didn\u2019t hit on them either. Manna simply asked you\nto do something, you did it, you said, \u201cOK\u201d, and Manna asked you to do the\nnext step. Each step was easy. You could go through the whole day on\nautopilot, and Manna made sure that you were constantly doing something. At\nthe end of the shift Manna always said the same thing. \u201cYou are done for\ntoday. Thank you for your help.\u201d Then you took off your headset and put it\nback on the rack to recharge. The first few minutes off the headset were\nalways disorienting \u2014 there had been this voice in your head telling you\nexactly what to do in minute detail for six or eight hours. You had to turn\nyour brain back on to get out of the restaurant.\n\nTo me, Manna was OK. The job at Burger-G was mindless, and Manna made it easy\nby telling you exactly what to do. You could even get Manna to play music\nthrough your headphones, in the background. Manna had a set of \u201cstations\u201d that\nyou could choose from. That was a bonus. And Manna kept you busy the entire\nday. Every single minute, you had something that Manna was telling you to do.\nIf you simply turned off your brain and went with the flow of Manna, the day\nwent by very fast.\n\nMy father, on the other hand, did not like Manna at all from the very first\nday he saw me wearing the headset in the restaurant. He and Mom had come in\nfor lunch and to say hi. I knew they were coming, so I had timed my break so I\ncould sit down with them for a few minutes. When I sat down, my father noticed\nthe headset.\n\n\u201cSo\u201d, he said, \u201cthey have you working the drive-thru I see. Is that a step up\nor a step down?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the drive-thru,\u201d I replied, \u201cit\u2019s a new system they\u2019ve installed\ncalled Manna. It manages the store.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tells me what to do through the headset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho, the manager?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a computer.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me for a long time, \u201cA computer is telling you what to do on the\njob? What does the manager do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe computer is the manager. Manna, manager, get it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean that a computer is telling you what to do all day?\u201d, he asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\nI gave him an example, \u201cBefore you got here, I was taking out the trash. Manna\ntold me how to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tells you exactly what to do. Like, It told me to get four new bags from\nthe rack. When I did that it told me to go to trash can #1. Once I got there\nit told me to open the cabinet and pull out the trash can. Once I did that it\ntold me to check the floor for any debris. Then it told me to tie up the bag\nand put it to the side, on the left. Then it told me to put a new bag in the\ncan. Then it told me to attach the bag to the rim. Then it told me to put the\ncan back in and close the cabinet. Then it told me to wipe down the cabinet\nand make sure it\u2019s spotless. Then it told me to push the help button on the\ncan to make sure it is working. Then it told me to move to trash can #2. Like\nthat.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me for a long time again before he said, \u201cGood Lord, you are\nnothing but a piece of a robot. What is it saying to you now?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just told me I have three minutes left on my break. And it told me to\nsmile and say hello to the guests. How\u2019s this? Hi!\u201d And I gave him a big\ntoothy grin.\n\n\u201cYesterday the people controlled the computers. Now the computers control the\npeople. You are the eyes and hands for this robot. And all so that Joe Garcia\ncan make $20 million per year. Do you know what will happen if this spreads?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And I think Mr. G makes more than $20 million a year. But right\nnow I\u2019ve got two minutes left, and Manna is telling me that I need to move\nback to station 3 to get ready for the next run. See ya.\u201d I waved at Mom. Dad\njust stared at me.\n\nThe tests in our Burger-G store were surprisingly successful. There were\nBurger-G corporate guys in the restaurant watching us, fixing bugs in the\nsoftware, making sure Manna was covering all the bases, and they were pleased.\nIt took about 3 months to work all the kinks out, and as they did the Manna\nsoftware totally changed the restaurant. Worker performance nearly doubled. So\ndid customer satisfaction. So did the consistency of the customer\u2019s\nexperience. Trash cans never overfilled. Bathrooms were remarkably clean.\nEmployees always washed their hands when they needed to. Food was ready\nfaster. The meals we handed out were nearly 100 percent accurate because Manna\nmade us check to make sure every item in the bag was exactly what the customer\nordered. The store never ran out of supplies \u2014 there were always plenty of\nnapkins in the dispenser and the ketchup container was always full. There were\nenough employees in the store for the busy times, because Manna could\naccurately track trends and staff appropriately.\n\nIn addition, Burger-G saved a ton of money. Burger-G had hundreds of stores in\nthe United States. Manna worked so well that Burger-G deployed it nationwide.\nSoon Burger-G had cut more than 3,000 of its higher-paid store employees \u2014\nmostly assistant managers and managers. That one change saved the company\nnearly $100 million per year, and all that money came straight to the bottom\nline for the restaurant chain. Shareholders were ecstatic. Mr. G gave himself\nanother big raise to celebrate. In addition, Manna had optimized store\nstaffing and had gotten a significant productivity boost out of the employees\nin the store. That saved another $150 million. $250 million made a huge\ndifference in the fast food industry.\n\nPrefer the Kindle? \u201cManna\u201d is now available on the Kindle \u2013 Click here!  \n---  \n  \nSo, the first wave of fast food robots did not replace all of the burger\nflipping employees as everyone had expected. The robots replaced middle\nmanagement and significantly improved the performance of minimum wage\nemployees. All of the other fast food chains watched the Burger-G experiment\nwith Manna closely, and they started installing Manna systems as well. Soon,\nnearly every business in America that had a significant pool of minimum-wage\nemployees was installing Manna software or something similar. They had to do\nit in order to compete.\n\nIn other words, Manna spread through the American corporate landscape like\nwildfire. And my dad was right. It was when all of these new Manna systems\nbegan talking to each other that things started to get uncomfortable.\n\nIntro | On Kindle | Go to Chapter 2 >>>\n\n# Search MarshallBrain.com\n\n# The Doomsday Book \u2013 Available Now\n\n# Marshall Brain\u2019s Blog\n\n# TEDx: Imagining Elon Musk\u2019s Million Person Mars Colony\n\nVideo Player\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n08:22\n\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\n# Marshall Brain TEDx on Getting Something Started\n\nVideo Player\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n17:55\n\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\n# We\u2019re approaching humanity\u2019s make or break period\n\nVideo Player\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n01:22:54\n\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\n# Feed from DoomsdayNow.com\n\n## The Official Site for Marshall Brain\n\n# Search MarshallBrain.com\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n# Recent Comments\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1998-2020, BYG Publishing Inc.\n\nPrivacy Policy Proudly powered by WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
