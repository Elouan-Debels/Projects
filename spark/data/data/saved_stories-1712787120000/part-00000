Depending on\nyour maturity, I would go so far as to say you should declare an incident for\nany unexpected behavior that deviates from normal operations.\n\nYou go from dreading incidents to embracing them as opportunities for\nimprovement.\n\n## Fear of declaring incidents\n\nI understand the reluctance within organizations to declare incidents.\nConcerns range from worrying about desensitizing team members to the\nseriousness of incidents, to the daunting meeting where you have to justify\nthe frequency of incidents to upper management.\n\nThis is all compounded by the fear of damaging your company\u2019s reputation.\n\u201cWhat if people perceive our many incidents as a lack of control, or much\nworse, competence?\u201d\n\nA shift to the left has already brought many advantages to other domains,\nnamely continuous delivery, security, and observability. Let\u2019s see how doing\nthe same in incident management will also bring many advantages.\n\n## More incidents, more understanding, more resilience\n\nUsing avoidance as a strategy usually doesn\u2019t pay dividends. By lowering the\nthreshold for what is considered an incident, and bringing it to the masses, I\nbelieve you\u2019ll raise your company\u2019s operational readiness and resilience. It\u2019s\nsimilar to pulling the Andon cable - anyone in a Toyota factory can pull the\nAndon cable and halt production until a solution is found.\n\nSo, what changes when you shift left on incident management?\n\n  * Increased readiness - a lower threshold for incidents creates a more prepared team. By capturing minor issues early, you prevent them from escalating into bigger problems. Your team will also be more familiar with the tooling and the processes.\n  * Improved understanding - more incidents provide you with valuable data on system (and people) behavior. This then helps pinpoint weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n  * Better overall prioritization - with a bigger and sharper view of issues, you can prioritize based on real-world impact, not just perceived severity.\n  * Fearless communication - people will adjust to being more open to failure, and discussing failure; doing so will also improve communication, both time and transparency, with your customers.\n\n## How this works in practice\n\nI had an \"aha\" moment when one of our engineers made a change to trigger\nincidents when we stopped being able to deploy to production.\n\nLisa describes in detail what happened in this lovely LinkedIn post. She broke\nthe build on our main codebase, which meant that no one could deploy it to\nproduction. Because we had hooked our CI pipeline to our HTTP alert source,\nwhich triggers an incident, and configured a workflow to escalate the incident\nto the person who merged the PR that is failing, she immediately got paged.\nWe\u2019ll save many developer hours in the long run, through this kind of fast\naction, not to speak of the learnings we\u2019ll get once we get to reviewing the\nincident.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou need to declare more incidents.\n\nLet's move beyond the fear of having too many incidents and instead learn from\nthe valuable data they provide to build stronger, and more resilient systems.\nIt requires a cultural shift away from fear and avoidance, towards openness,\ncuriosity, and learning.\n\nBy embracing a broader definition of incidents, organizations can unlock\nvaluable insights into their operations, fostering a culture of resilience and\nadaptability. In doing so, they are not merely preparing for the future; they\nare actively shaping it.\n\nI\u2019m very proud that we're here and it feels like we\u2019re living in the future.\n\nNorberto Lopes\n\nVP Engineering\n\nView more from Norberto\n\n## Email required to access this blog post\n\nLoading...\n\n## Sign up to our newsletter\n\nEnter your details to receive our monthly newsletter, filled with incident\nrelated insights to help you in your day-to-day!\n\nLoading...\n\n### See related articles\n\nEngineering\n\nWhy we chose JavaScript over CEL\n\nA look into why we chose plain Javascript over CEL expression evaluation for\nour Catalog importer tool.\n\nMacey Baker\n\nMacey Baker\n\nMarch 21, 2024\u00b73 min read\n\nEngineering\n\nRunning projects for AI features\n\nIn this article, Aaron the Technical Lead for the Post-incident team\nhighlights the differences of running projects for AI powered features\n\nAaron Sheah\n\nAaron Sheah\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\u00b76 min read\n\nEngineering\n\nFinding relationships in your data with embeddings\n\nSpotting relationships in your data can be hard especially when that data is\nfree text.
