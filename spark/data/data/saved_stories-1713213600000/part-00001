Lithium-ion batteries are in wide use at present, and\ncontinued research to improve them has been a focus of energy engineering.\nThis, in turn, has greatly increased the demand for lithium (Li) as a natural\nresource. While the primary ores of Li (pegmatite, salar brine, and volcanic-\nassociated clay) are generally well-understood, it would be desirable to\nidentify additional Li sources that could be safely and economically\nexploited. Using material from previous industrial operations (e.g., mine\ntailings or drill cuttings) as a source of additional Li would be attractive\nas it would generate little or no new waste material.\n\nOur study was carried out on 15 Devonian shale samples of varying organic\nrichness from wells drilled in the Appalachian basin (USA). Sequential\nextraction of the samples was performed to measure Li recovery from targeted\nrock-forming phases, namely the carbonates, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, pyrites, and\norganic matter. The mineralogy of the post-leaching residue was found to be\ndominated by silicates and anatase, suggesting the target phases were\nsuccessfully leached out of the whole rock.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the data shows higher whole-rock Li values are observed in\nsamples with a higher total clay content. The lowest whole-rock Li contents\ncorrespond to samples having higher contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and\npyrite. Unexpectedly, however, samples with relatively lower Li contents (22\nppm) can liberate up to 54% of the total lithium from pyrite alone.\nFurthermore, we observe a positive correlation between pyrite content and %Li\nrecovery in the pyrite leachate (r^2= 0.732). These initial findings suggest\nthat pyrite in conjunction with organic matter may play a previously\nunrecognized role in the Li distribution in organic-rich shales. The\ngeochemical processes that might cause Li enrichments associated with pyrite\nare not well-understood. However, since Li mobility is highly sensitive to\nsmall increases in temperature, the very high thermal maturation of the\nstudied shale sequence may have significantly impacted Li remobilization\nduring the smectite-to-illite clay-mineral transformation. The common Li-\nmineral that can coexist with different phases of FeS is Li_2S at temperatures\n\u2a7d 75\u00b0C \u2013 135\u00b0C. Several reaction mechanisms have been proposed, but there is\nlittle known about the rate kinetics and reaction steps involved in Li\nassociation with pyrite in shales.\n\nThis study suggests the possibility that some Li may be sequestered in pyrite\nin organic-rich shales. As pyrite is a common mineral in the Appalachian\nBasin, this has implications for exploiting shale pyrite in the Devonian\nsequence if the Li proves economically extractable. Drill cuttings from past\nand current oil and gas operations are a ready material upon which to test the\nfeasibility of this concept.\n\nHow to cite: Bhattacharya, S., Dix, M.
