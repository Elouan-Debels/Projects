In most places in the U.S., clean water is so easily\naccessible that we often take it for granted. However, 2.2 billion people,\nnearly 1 in 3 people worldwide, don\u2019t have reliable or affordable access to\nsafe drinking water \u2014 a number expected to be exacerbated by climate-change\nrelated events. In some countries, people spend anywhere between 10-50% of\ntheir income just covering water costs. Women and children carry an additional\nburden because they\u2019re often the ones spending hours collecting the water\ntheir families need. The scale, severity and human cost of this problem is one\nof the reasons teams at X have been hunting for moonshots in the clean water\nspace for many years. Today, we\u2019re sharing the journey and key findings from a\nrecent project focused on this challenge: H2E.\n\nH2E (\u201cHydration to Everyone\u201d) explored whether it would be possible to improve\naccess to safe drinking water by harvesting water from the air. The team\nrecently wrapped up their investigation, and are now sharing what they\u2019ve\nlearned in the hopes of accelerating progress in the wider atmospheric water\nharvesting (AWH) field. This includes a paper just published in the journal\nNature showing that small, solar-powered AWH devices could be used to provide\nclean drinking water to around 1 billion people who currently do not have\naccess to it. The team is also sharing geospatial analysis tools, geospatial\ndatasets, prototype designs, and a non-assertion patent pledge so that others\ncan build upon their findings so far.\n\n## Reframing the challenge of access to clean drinking water\n\nThe H2E team was a small, interdisciplinary team made up of scientists,\ndevelopment experts, engineers, geospatial analysts, user researchers and\nindustrial designers who have long been passionate about the challenge of\naccess to clean water. Drinking water access is often hindered by a range of\ncomplicated factors and structural challenges that vary from place to place,\nincluding proximity to existing water resources, local community\ninfrastructure, governance issues and more. This is partially why in many\nplaces, piped water infrastructure could still be decades away.\n\nEveryone, however, has access to the air and the sun. So the H2E team asked:\n\u201cWhat if you could put the power to generate daily drinking water into the\nhands of individuals, no matter where they live, by creating an affordable,\neasy to use device that harvests water from the air and is powered by the\nsun?\"\n\nAtmospheric water harvesters \u2014 devices which pull water from the air \u2014 have\noften been overlooked as a potential solution because of their relatively low\noutputs in comparison to other technologies, like desalination. One of their\nbenefits, however, is that they can be built to be small, modular and\nrenewably powered \u2014 decoupling them from some of the more systemic barriers to\naccess. The team knew that such devices would never be the only solution\nneeded, but their hope was that it could help fill a critical gap in places\nwhere safely managed drinking water was needed most.\n\n_A roadside drinking water source used by a family the H2E team visited while\nconducting field research in Kitui, Kenya. The team made a number of research\ntrips to East Africa and the Navajo Nation to listen to potential adopters of\nthis technology and learn what would be most useful in their lives.\n\n## Findings in Nature: the global potential of water-from-air technology\n\nAlong with field research, the team kicked off an investigation into whether\natmospheric water harvesters could work in regions where access to safely\nmanaged drinking water was low. We\u2019re making some of these findings available\nin a Nature paper today which we published together with Robert Bain, a co-\nauthor at UNICEF. The study combined global climate data, public UNICEF/WHO\ndata on people\u2019s access to safely managed drinking water, and published\nperformance data about a variety of AWH devices. Our team also developed\ngeospatial tools based on Google Earth Engine to map where AWH outputs would\nbe sufficient to meet people\u2019s daily water needs. The research findings\nillustrate that AWH devices could be used to provide drinking water to around\n1 billion people who currently don\u2019t have access to safely managed drinking\nwater. This is significant because it\u2019s the first global study to demonstrate\nsuch wide-reaching potential for AWH technology to tackle this challenge.\n\n_Map from the Nature paper by Lord. et. al. [1] shows the overlap between\nwhere people without safely managed drinking water live (red dots) and\nclimates where AWH devices have the potential to perform best (dark blue\nshaded areas).\n\n## Building an affordable, sustainable, and off-grid device\n\nHaving determined in early research that atmospheric water harvesting devices\nheld such promise, the H2E team set out to build a device that could be as\naffordably, easily and sustainably used by as many individuals without safe\ndrinking water as possible. Specifically, they aimed to build a device that:\n\n  * Could be affordable to people living on $2-8 a day\n  * Could work even in dry places (as low as 30% relative humidity)\n  * Individual households could adopt on their own, without having to rely on community infrastructure\n  * Could be entirely powered by sustainable, renewable energy\n  * Could produce water at a cost target of $.01 a litre\n  * Could become the foundation of a large, sustainable business\n\nAfter various iterations and user research studies, the team eventually built\ntheir most recent prototype model. This prototype ran on solar heat and was\nmade from vacuum-formed parts \u2014 a manufacturing technique typically used to\nmake small, disposable items, like takeaway food containers. Light and low\ncost, the team realized vacuum-forming also had the potential to form many of\nthe larger parts of their device too.\n\n_Project H2E\u2019s most recent prototype in the lab\n\nTo understand how the device worked, it\u2019s helpful to go back to how\ncondensation works in nature. When warm, humid air meets cooler air, or hits a\ncooler surface, the molecules in it slow down and cool into liquid. This is\nhow clouds are formed in the atmosphere, or beads of water collect on a cold\ncan of soda on a hot summer day. H2E\u2019s prototype basically replicated the\nnatural process of condensation, but on a much smaller scale. This was made\npossible through a variety of processes and components \u2014 namely, constantly\nrecirculating air, solar energy, and a desiccant (a material that absorbs\nmoisture, like the silica gel packets you find in a new pair of shoes). The\nbelow illustration describes the process in more detail:\n\n_Illustration demonstrating how the H2E team\u2019s most recent prototype worked\n\nThe team\u2019s most recent prototype still had a lot of room for improvement \u2014 for\nexample, the vacuum-forming process could be iterated on to lower costs and\nraise the water output of the device. Nevertheless, the prototype ended up\nachieving a water output of 150 mL/h/m^2 \u2014 enough water to keep a person\nhydrated in many dry places. This helped demonstrate the team\u2019s initial\nhypothesis that a low-cost, sustainably-powered device could be used to\nprovide a person\u2019s daily water intake.\n\n## Sharing H2E\u2019s findings with the world\n\nWhen teams are really passionate about a problem space or technological\nsolution it can be very hard to take a step back and dispassionately assess if\na given investigation is the best bet X could be making at a given time, or if\nwe're the right people to take a project through to its next phase. That\u2019s why\nat the start of every project at X we set ourselves ambitious targets as well\nas kill criteria.\n\nAfter three years of work, the team felt confident they could build a device\nthat would produce water for $.10 per liter; however, it would have taken\nsignificant development work and iteration to prove feasibility at $.01 per\nliter. Additionally, the next phase of work for the project looked to be\nheavily focused on hardware integration and mass production expertise \u2014 not\nX\u2019s sweet spot. During the course of the project, the team also saw many new\norganizations \u2014 including research groups, startups, and NGOs \u2014 springing up\nto work on ways to harvest drinking water from the air.\n\nGiven these factors, it became clear that X wasn\u2019t best suited to take the\nwork forward, and one of the best ways X could have an impact now on the\nproblem of access to safe drinking water was to share what we\u2019ve learned. We\nbelieve this technology, even at $.10 a liter, has the potential for positive\nimpact in many communities and could form the basis for many viable businesses\n\u2014 just not the size and shape of businesses we\u2019re working to produce at X.\n\nAlongside the findings in the Nature paper, the team is sharing geospatial\nanalysis tools and datasets to help guide future AWH implementation and design\nstrategies. This includes \u201cAWH-Geo\u201d which can be used to see where AWH devices\nwould be most useful and what outputs would be needed for them to perform\nbest. The team is also releasing the CAD files and hardware assembly\ndocumentation for their most recent prototype. A non-assertion patent pledge\nenables anyone to use these designs freely.\n\nWith problems as urgent as access to clean drinking water or the climate\ncrisis, no one has time to waste re-learning the old lessons. That\u2019s why, when\nX is not the best long-term fit for an idea but others could benefit from what\nwe\u2019ve learned, we share our findings \u2014 like we did with Foghorn, Loon and\nMakani.\n\nWe believe there is tremendous opportunity in atmospheric water harvesting to\nhelp improve access to clean drinking water. We hope these insights can help\naccelerate further research, investments, entrepreneurship, and progress of\nothers working in the emerging field of atmospheric water harvesting.\n\n_[1] Lord, J., Thomas, A., Treat, N. et al.
