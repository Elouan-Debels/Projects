When it was first\nintroduced in 2006, jQuery became a fundamental tool for web developers almost\nimmediately. It simplified JavaScript programming, making it easier to\nmanipulate HTML documents, handle events, perform animations, and much more.\nSince then, it has played and continues to play a major role in the evolution\nof web standards and browser capabilities.\n\nWith the rise of modern JavaScript frameworks, fewer developers may be\nchoosing to use jQuery for new projects, but worldwide usage is still\nextremely high. After analyzing the results of a survey conducted by IDC, the\nOpenJS Foundation estimated that 90% of all websites use jQuery. And about a\nthird of those use an outdated version.\n\nThe jQuery Team and OpenJS Foundation are working to fix that as part of the\nHealthy Web checkup campaign. This guide will explain why it is important to\nkeep your jQuery version up to date and walk you through the process of\nupgrading jQuery.\n\n## Why Is Upgrading jQuery Important for Security?\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities: Like any software, jQuery may contain security\nvulnerabilities in its codebase. These vulnerabilities can range from Cross-\nSite Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to more severe issues like Remote Code\nExecution (RCE). As vulnerabilities are discovered, the jQuery team releases\npatches and updates to address them. By upgrading to the latest version of\njQuery, you ensure that your application benefits from these security fixes,\nreducing the risk of exploitation by attackers.\n\nSecurity Best Practices: Newer versions of jQuery often incorporate security\nbest practices and enhancements to mitigate common security threats. These\nimprovements may include stricter input validation, improved handling of user-\ngenerated content, and better protection against XSS attacks. By upgrading,\nyou adopt these best practices and strengthen the security posture of your\napplication.\n\nCompliance Requirements: Many industries and regulatory frameworks require\norganizations to maintain up-to-date software and address known security\nvulnerabilities promptly. Failure to upgrade jQuery and address security\nissues could lead to non-compliance with these requirements.\n\n## What About Browser Support?\n\njQuery 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x each have a different list of supported browsers.\nHowever, given current browser market usage, the browsers that jQuery 3.x\nsupports, which includes IE 9+, should be sufficient in almost all cases.\njQuery 4.x will still support IE11, even though Microsoft announced it is\nofficially out of support.\n\n## How Do I Upgrade jQuery?\n\nThe jQuery Team provides the jQuery Migrate plugin to make upgrading jQuery as\neasy as possible. It is mainly meant as a development tool that generates\nwarning messages in the browser console that can be used to identify and fix\ncompatibility issues. It temporarily restores deprecated features and\nbehaviors so that older code will still run on newer versions of jQuery while\nthe compatibility issues are addressed.\n\nThere are two versions of jQuery Migrate: 1.x and 3.x (there is no Migrate\n2.x). Only one version should be used at a time, but you may need to use both\nin succession if upgrading from a jQuery version that predates jQuery 1.9.\n\nFor example, if your current jQuery version is 1.4.4, first use jQuery Migrate\n1.x to upgrade to jQuery 1.12.4 and then use jQuery Migrate 3.x to upgrade to\nthe latest jQuery (3.7.1, as of this writing). If your current version is\n2.2.4, you only need to use jQuery Migrate 3.x to upgrade to the latest\njQuery.\n\n## Using jQuery Migrate\n\nFirst, add jQuery Migrate to your page *after* loading jQuery.\n\n    \n    \n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-3.4.1.js\"></script>\n\nThen, test your website or application. As different jQuery APIs are used,\njQuery Migrate will log messages to the console warning about any deprecations\nor breaking changes. Address each warning one at a time.\n\nFinally, when no more warnings are logged to the console and all breaking\nchanges have been addressed, the jQuery Migrate can be removed and migration\nis complete!\n\nSee the jQuery Migrate README for more details.\n\n## jQuery Upgrade Guides\n\nThe jQuery Upgrade Guides can be helpful when you\u2019re looking for more details\non a breaking change, or you just want to see the full list of breaking\nchanges for each version. There are upgrade guides for jQuery 1.9, 3.0 and 3.5\nthat list all of the breaking changes that happened in those releases. Most of\nthe breaking changes listed will probably not apply to your code, but these\nguides add some context and explanation for each change.\n\n## A Note on Future jQuery Versions\n\nWith jQuery 4.0 on the horizon, you may wonder what the process will be for\nupgrading to jQuery 4.x. The answer is that it will be the same as upgrading\nto jQuery 3.x and it can still be done in one step. In other words, there will\nbe no need to upgrade to jQuery 3.x before upgrading to jQuery 4.x. You will\nbe able to upgrade straight from 1.9+ to jQuery 4.x. We will also have an\nupgrade guide ready for jQuery 4.0.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUpgrading jQuery is essential for maintaining the security, performance, and\ncompatibility of your web applications. By following the steps outlined in\nthis guide, you can safely upgrade to the latest version of jQuery and take\nadvantage of its new features and improvements while ensuring that your web\napplication remains protected against any discovered vulnerabilities. Remember\nto regularly check for updates and stay informed about new releases to keep\nyour codebase up to date.\n\nComments are closed.\n\n### Categories\n\n  * Events\n  * Foundation\n  * jQuery\n  * jQuery UI\n  * Projects\n  * Weekly News\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Upgrading jQuery: Working Towards a Healthy Web\n  * jQuery 4.0.0 BETA!\n  * jQuery 3.7.1 Released: Reliable Table Row Dimensions\n  * jQuery 3.7.0 Released: Staying in Order\n  * jQuery 3.6.4 Released: Selector Forgiveness\n  * jQuery 3.6.3 Released: A Quick Selector Fix\n  * jQuery 3.6.2 Released!\n  * jQuery 3.6.1 Maintenance Release\n  * jQuery maintainers continue modernization initiative with deprecation of jQuery Mobile\n  * jQuery maintainers update and transition jQuery UI as part of overall modernization efforts\n\n### Archives\n\n  * April 2024\n  * February 2024\n  * August 2023\n  * May 2023\n  * March 2023\n  * December 2022\n  * August 2022\n  * October 2021\n  * June 2021\n  * March 2021\n  * May 2020\n  * April 2020\n  * May 2019\n  * April 2019\n  * August 2018\n  * January 2018\n  * March 2017\n  * September 2016\n  * July 2016\n  * June 2016\n  * May 2016\n  * April 2016\n  * March 2016\n  * February 2016\n  * January 2016\n  * December 2015\n  * November 2015\n  * September 2015\n  * July 2015\n  * April 2015\n  * March 2015\n  * February 2015\n  * January 2015\n  * December 2014\n  * October 2014\n  * September 2014\n  * August 2014\n  * July 2014\n  * May 2014\n  * April 2014\n  * March 2014\n  * January 2014\n  * December 2013\n  * November 2013\n  * October 2013\n  * September 2013\n  * August 2013\n  * July 2013\n  * June 2013\n  * May 2013\n  * April 2013\n  * March 2013\n  * February 2013\n  * January 2013\n  * December 2012\n  * November 2012\n  * October 2012\n  * September 2012\n  * August 2012\n  * July 2012\n  * June 2012\n  * May 2012\n  * April 2012\n  * March 2012\n  * January 2012\n  * December 2011\n  * November 2011\n  * October 2011\n  * September 2011\n  * August 2011\n  * June 2011\n  * May 2011\n  * April 2011\n  * March 2011\n  * February 2011\n  * January 2011\n  * December 2010\n  * November 2010\n  * October 2010\n  * September 2010\n  * August 2010\n  * July 2010\n  * June 2010\n  * April 2010\n  * March 2010\n  * February 2010\n  * January 2010\n  * December 2009\n  * November 2009\n  * October 2009\n  * August 2009\n  * July 2009\n  * June 2009\n  * May 2009\n  * April 2009\n  * March 2009\n  * February 2009\n  * January 2009\n  * December 2008\n  * November 2008\n  * October 2008\n  * September 2008\n  * August 2008\n  * July 2008\n  * June 2008\n  * May 2008\n  * March 2008\n  * February 2008\n  * January 2008\n  * December 2007\n  * November 2007\n  * October 2007\n  * September 2007\n  * August 2007\n  * July 2007\n  * June 2007\n  * May 2007\n  * April 2007\n  * March 2007\n  * February 2007\n  * January 2007\n  * December 2006\n  * November 2006\n  * October 2006\n  * September 2006\n  * August 2006\n  * July 2006\n  * June 2006\n  * May 2006\n  * April 2006\n  * March 2006\n  * February 2006\n  * January 2006\n  * August 1997\n\n### Books\n\n  * Learning jQuery Fourth Edition Karl Swedberg and Jonathan Chaffer\n  * jQuery in Action Bear Bibeault, Yehuda Katz, and Aurelio De Rosa\n  * jQuery Succinctly Cody Lindley\n\n  * Learning Center\n  * Forum\n  * API\n  * Twitter\n  * IRC\n  * GitHub\n\nCopyright 2024 The jQuery Foundation. jQuery License Web hosting by Digital Ocean | CDN by StackPath\n\n", "frontpage": false}
