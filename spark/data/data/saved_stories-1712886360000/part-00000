Founders\nand investors often avoid these areas because they feel like they are more\ncapital intensive or have worse outcomes, but it turns out that\u2019s just not\ntrue.\n\nThe biggest overall misconception about deep tech companies is that they are\nnecessarily much harder and more expensive to build. That may have been very\ntrue 10-20 years ago, but it\u2019s less true now. This post will make the case\nthat building these companies is easier and more affordable than ever before.\n(Note: still not easy, but getting easier!)\n\nThere are several reasons why this is a great time to build a deep tech\ncompany:\n\n  1. Stronger startup talent\n\n  2. Improved tech infrastructure\n\n  3. Better access to venture capital and non-dilutive funding\n\n  4. Strong macro tailwinds\n\n##\n\nStartup talent\n\nTwenty years ago, companies in defense tech or advanced manufacturing or tech\nbio had a much harder time with recruiting. Back then, it was hard to find\ncandidates with domain experience and a startup mindset. For example you could\neither find a startup engineer who didn\u2019t understand how the defense sector\nworked, or an engineer from a giant defense prime who didn\u2019t know how startups\nworked. It was very hard to find someone with a foot in each world.\n\nToday, incredible alumni from companies like SpaceX, Palantir, Solugen,\nAnduril, and so on are available as co-founders, advisors, and employees. It\u2019s\nno longer impossible to recruit a team of ambitious engineers who can build\ncomplex hardware+software products at startup speeds.\n\nAdditionally, by hiring startup people with extremely relevant industry\nexperience, you can learn from recent playbooks that have worked instead of\nreinventing every wheel yourself.\n\n##\n\nTech Infrastructure\n\nBuilding a deep tech company today is easier because the \u201cprimitives\u201d in most\nareas have gotten dramatically faster/smaller/cheaper over the past few\ndecades. We talk about Moore\u2019s law for computing, but there are Moore\u2019s-law-\nlike trends for many fundamental hardware and bio primitives.\n\nThe trend looks a lot like this:\n\nExamples of technologies that have advanced a lot relative to where they were\n15-20 years ago:\n\n  * Solar panels are 10x cheaper per watt1 and 1.5x-2x more efficient.2\n\n  * Lithium-ion batteries are 10x cheaper3 and 10x more energy dense.4\n\n  * LiDAR is about 100x cheaper.5\n\n  * GPUs are 1000x cheaper per GFLOP6 and 2000x more powerful.7\n\n  * Genome sequencing is 100,000x cheaper (!!) and gene synthesis is 100x cheaper.8\n\n  * Launching a kilogram into space is 10x cheaper.9\n\n  * Industrial robots are 100x more precise than 40 years ago, 5x cheaper than 20 years ago.10\n\n  * Hard drives and RAM are each 40x cheaper and much higher capacity.11 And there are amazing options if you\u2019re space constrained (a few of these in 2004 vs one of these in 2024).\n\nAcross the board, key components for hardware/bio/etc are frequently 10x+\ncheaper, 10x+ smaller, and 10x+ faster today than in the early 2000s.\n\nAdditionally, \u201csoftware for hardware\u201d is getting better as well. Creation of\nsynthetic data for testing is better, collaboration tools are better, physics\ntools are better, design and simulation tools are better, and so on.\n\nWhat this means is that a typical deep tech company might have needed tens of\nmillions of dollars to prove out something meaningful 20 years ago, single\ndigit millions 10 years ago, and only hundreds of thousands today.\n\nFor example, I recently spoke with a company that enables biology experiments\nin space. They\u2019re less than a year old and have already launched multiple\nexperiments into orbit with a small pre-seed round (!). That would\u2019ve been\nimpossible in 2010 without lots of funding \u2014 and maybe impossible even with\nlots of funding. In general, many amazing deep tech startups today couldn\u2019t\nhave been built until the last few years, but now founders can build\ncompelling proof-of-concept hardware with a pre-seed or seed round.\n\n##\n\nVenture Capital and Non-dilutive Funding\n\nIn addition to better tech components and stronger startup talent, there\u2019s\ncurrently a lot of funding available for deep tech.\n\nOn the VC side, you have large funds like DCVC ($4b AUM), Lux ($5b AUM), and\nEclipse ($4b AUM) that by themselves have invested billions into deep tech\ncompanies over the past decade. You also have great seed stage funds like Root\nVentures, Fifty Years, and Cantos, and emerging funds like Humba Ventures (my\nfund!), Champion Hill, Julian Capital, Also Capital, and Undeterred Capital.\nAnd there are hundreds of other great funds that hopefully won\u2019t be mad at me\nfor keeping this list short, as well as deep tech demo days like Boost and\npitch forums like Deep Checks. Almost none of these funds and programs existed\nin 2010, and many didn\u2019t exist until after 2020. Thanks to recent mega-\nsuccesses like SpaceX and Palantir, the amount of well-deserved investor\nattention that deep tech is getting right now is insane.\n\nOf course, selling a piece of your company for every dollar you have to raise\nis not ideal, and that\u2019s where non-dilutive funding comes in. The last decade\nhas given rise to a lot of government programs like SBIR grants, AFWERX,\nSTRATFI/TACFI matching funding, and the DIU. Additionally, startups in areas\nlike climate and energy can benefit from generous incentives in the Inflation\nReduction Act, and from DoE grants/loans.\n\nThe cash that these government programs offer is great and helps keep dilution\nat bay. But the programs are also wonderful because you can get early access\nto your customer if you sell to government departments. Until recently, you\nhad to make it on your own for years before the DoD would talk to you, but now\nthey roll out the red carpet and engage with companies and founders within\nmonths of inception. This type of early customer development opportunity is\ninvaluable.\n\n##\n\nMacro Tailwinds\n\nTalent and funding are great, but they won\u2019t get you anywhere if customers\ndon\u2019t want to buy what you\u2019re selling. And that\u2019s where recent economic and\npolitical tailwinds come in. Tensions with China and Russia have created\npressure on our government to fund defense innovation. Strained relations with\nChina are also causing companies to rethink their material sourcing and\nmanufacturing for the first time in years or decades. Additionally, rising\nminimum wage laws and intensely seasonal hiring needs in sectors like\nagriculture are pushing many industries toward increasing automation in order\nto survive.\n\nThese global trends are an immense tailwind for startups focused on robotics,\nmanufacturing, defense, energy, and many other areas.\n\nThere are now lots of buyers that had zero desire to try anything new 5-10\nyears ago, and that are now desperately searching for alternatives to their\nstatus quo. That\u2019s an amazing opportunity for companies that listen to their\ncustomers and build quickly.\n\n##\n\nIt\u2019s time to build deep tech!\n\nThe confluence of dropping costs and improving performance of tech components,\ntons of talented deep tech startup alumni, lots of early stage capital, and\nstrong global tailwinds have created an excellent environment for building\ndeep tech companies.\n\nSoftware will continue to be a great place to build and invest, but I believe\nthe physical world will present even better near-term opportunities for\nambitious founders. Ideas that used to require 50 people, $50m, and 5 years\ncan now be tested with 5 people, $2m, and 2 years \u2014 and we\u2019re going to see a\nlot more amazing technology in the physical world as a result.\n\nYes, this does link to a cheesy AI-generated rock song about deep tech...\n\nThanks for reading Coding VC!
