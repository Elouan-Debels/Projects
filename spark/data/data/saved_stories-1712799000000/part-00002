(I was born in 1992, so I do.)\n\nIt was a wild, untamed frontier, brimming with possibility. A digital punk\nrock revolution, where ideas flowed freely, relatively unencumbered by the\nsuffocating grip of corporate control. It was beautiful, chaotic, and so\nfucking alive. (Sure, once in a while you saw things nobody should ever see,\nespecially no twelve-year-old \u2014 I vividly remember a story of two girls and\nonly one cup \u2014 but that didn\u2019t cause me any lasting harm, did it? Did it??)\n\nWe were explorers, pioneers, setting out to map uncharted territories of the\nmind. The very architecture of the internet seemed to promise a future of\nradical democracy, of communities bound together by shared passions rather\nthan geography or social class:\n\n#### The Future Once Seemed So Bright. What Happened?\n\nAntonio Melonio\n\n\u00b7\n\nNovember 1, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nJesus fucking Christ, how far we have fallen.\n\nToday\u2019s internet is a hollow shell of its former self, a once vibrant\necosystem now strip-mined by the insatiable appetite of surveillance\ncapitalism. Where we once had a thriving bazaar of ideas, we now have a never-\nending stream of staged videos, malformed AI art, and regurgitated Substack\nopinions (like this one), all packaged neatly for maximum engagement and\nminimum substance. The internet has become one giant, inescapable\nadvertisement, every click tracked, every preference cataloged, every moment\nof attention ruthlessly monetized (by the way, you should definitely become a\npaid subscriber to Beneath the Pavement).\n\nAre you not entertained?\n\nSubscribe to Beneath the Pavement so you can spend more time on the internet.\n\n###\n\nThe enshittification of the internet\n\nThis is the enshittification of the internet, ladies and gentlemen, to borrow\na term from the ever-colorful Cory Doctorow. Platform decay. It\u2019s the slow,\ninexorable process by which the delightful chaos of the early web is tamed,\nsanitized, and repackaged for mass consumption. The quirky, homespun charm of\nGeoCities pages and niche forums has been replaced by the sleek, corporate\nminimalism of Instagram and now Reddit, a style choice that reflects the\nhollowness within.\n\nRemember when YouTube was a place for genuine, unfiltered human expression?\nNow it\u2019s an endless sea of reaction videos, drama vlogs, and thinly-veiled\nproduct placements (looking at you, Kurzgesagt). The algorithm, that\nmysterious and all-powerful arbiter of attention, rewards not creativity or\noriginality, but engagement at any cost. And so we\u2019re fed a steady diet of\nmanufactured outrage, fake controversies, and vapid \u201ccontent\u201d designed to keep\nus clicking, watching, and scrolling. It works magnificently.\n\nSubscribe to Beneath the Pavement to vote on this poll\n\nOnly subscribers can vote on this poll.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It\u2019s a rather chilling\nthought, but one that\u2019s hard to dismiss entirely. After all, how much of what\nwe see online these days feels truly authentic, truly human? The uncanny\nvalley of AI-generated text and images is rapidly shrinking, and it\u2019s becoming\nharder and harder to distinguish the real from the fake.\n\nThis is not some accident of technology, but the logical endpoint of a system\nthat prioritizes profit over people at every turn. The internet was once a\ncommons, a shared space for collaboration and creativity. But as Shoshana\nZuboff warns in her work \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d it has been\nenclosed by private interests, fenced off, strip-mined for data. Our every\ninteraction, our every intimate thought and feeling, has become raw material\nfor the machine, fuel for the engines of targeted advertising and behavioral\nprediction. A corporate tragedy of the commons.\n\n###\n\nCapitalist takeover\n\nIn short: capitalism, in its endless quest for growth and profit, has\nswallowed the internet whole. The platforms that dominate our online lives \u2014\nGoogle, Meta, Amazon \u2014 are private fiefdoms, answerable only to their\nshareholders and the bottom line. And as they\u2019ve grown, they\u2019ve used their\nwealth and market dominance to gobble up potential competitors, stifle\ninnovation, and bend the very fabric of the internet to their will.\n\nEven supposed bastions of independence like Substack \u2014 despite incessant\nclaims to the contrary \u2014 are far from immune. Though pitched as a way for\nwriters to break free from the tyranny of the algorithm, it\u2019s rapidly becoming\njust another playground for the well-connected, a space where success is\ndetermined not by the quality of one\u2019s ideas, but by the size of one\u2019s\nexisting audience. (I say this not out of spite, at least not entirely.)\nUnknown writers, in general, will remain unknown no matter the quality of idea\nand skill.\n\nMeet the new boss, same as the old boss.\n\nShare this essay if you like.\n\nShare\n\n###\n\nThe inversion of internet and real life\n\nPerhaps most disturbingly, the internet is no longer a reflection of real life\n\u2014 no, real life has become a reflection of the internet. Our (boring) offline\nworld is increasingly shaped by the priorities and incentives of the online\nattention economy. Politics has become a series of viral moments and hashtag\ncampaigns, substance sacrificed for shareability and outrage. Culture is\nreduced to a never-ending series of memes and challenges, each more ephemeral\nthan the last. Even our interpersonal relationships, to a degree, are mediated\nby the logic of likes and follows, our sense of self-worth tied to digital\nclout.\n\nWe are living in the shadow of the machine, every move tracked, every desire\npredicted and packaged for sale. The internet had its golden age, and we\nforgot all about it. We took a collaborative miracle and turned it into just\nanother tool; handed over the keys to the kingdom, and now reaping the bitter\nrewards.\n\n###\n\nToward a better internet\n\nPerhaps not all is lost. Even as the internet of olden times recedes into the\nmurky shadows of ancestral memory, there remain glimmers of hope, pockets of\nresistance against the all-consuming logic of capitalism. In the rise of\ndecentralized technologies and peer-to-peer networks (I love torrents, \u201cArrgh,\nmatey!\u201d), we discover the potential for a new kind of internet, one that\nreturns power to the hands of users rather than corporations. In the growing\ndemand for data privacy and algorithmic transparency, we see perhaps the early\nstirrings of a public awakening, a recognition that our online lives have\nconsequences that extend beyond the screen.\n\nThe internet is not dead, but it is broken. To fix it, we must first recognize\nthe depth and scale of the problem. We must confront the fact that the very\nbusiness models that dominate the web \u2014 the relentless monetization of\nattention, the strip-mining of personal data, ads, so many fucking ads \u2014 are\nfundamentally incompatible with a healthy, thriving digital, and hence analog,\npublic sphere. We must demand a new deal for the internet, one that puts\npeople and communities first. Substack, in some ways, had the right ideas\nwhile almost entirely failing in execution. I cannot accept that a Google\nsearch gives you fifteen sponsored ads first.\n\nThis will not be easy. The forces of surveillance capitalism are deeply, very,\nvery deeply, entrenched, and they will not relinquish their power willingly.\nBut the stakes are really fucking high. The internet is not just a tool or a\npastime \u2014 it is, in some ways \u2014 though not to overstate its significance \u2014 the\nnervous system of the 21st century, the connective tissue that binds our world\ntogether. If we lose the battle for the internet, we risk losing something\nfundamental indeed.\n\nReimagine what online life could be \u2014 a true commons, a space for genuine\nconnection and collaboration, for creativity and community, and the free\nexchange of ideas without succumbing to the free-speech-also-means-hate-speech\nfallacy. Let us build an internet worthy of the utopian visions that birthed\nit, an internet that brings out the best in us rather than the worst. How? I\ndon\u2019t know, man.\n\nI just know that we cannot let this be our legacy. The internet may have lost\nits way, but it\u2019s not entirely too late to chart a new course. Soon,\neverything will be AI, and if we do nothing it will be so very, very boring.\n\nWell, thanks for reading. I hope this wasn\u2019t too boring.\n\nAntonio Melonio\n\n### Subscribe to Beneath the Pavement\n\nBy Antonio Melonio \u00b7 Launched a year ago\n\nBurn down the system, not yourself.
