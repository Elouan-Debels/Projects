The proliferation of these aircraft\nhas rendered all front-line troop movements, especially in vehicles,\nvulnerable to precision strikes. Many drones have thermal cameras that can\ndetect human bodies in the dark.Photographs by Maxim Dondyuk for The New\nYorker\n\nMembers of Ukraine\u2019s 1st Separate Assault Battalion describe themselves as\nfiremen. Their job is to rapidly deploy to areas along the front that are in\ndanger of collapse. Lately, their service has been in high demand: the front\nis burning. A large-scale counter-offensive last year failed to achieve\nmeaningful victories, and since then Russia has been on the attack. One of its\npriorities appears to be Kupyansk, a city in northeastern Ukraine, some twenty\nmiles from the Russian border. According to the Ukrainian military, Russia has\namassed forty thousand troops near the city, which it has been bombarding for\nmonths. In January, after Russian forces routed Ukrainian soldiers from an\nuninhabited settlement outside Kupyansk called Tabaivka, the 1st Separate\nAssault Battalion was directed to halt and, if possible, reverse the enemy\u2019s\nadvance.\n\nThis piece was supported by the Pulitzer Center.\n\nI embedded with the battalion three days later. The government had mandated an\nevacuation of Kupyansk in August, and, as my translator and I entered the\ncity, its ghostly silence was punctuated by the sound of incoming and outgoing\nmunitions. Huge craters gaped on the roadside; factories lay in ruins.\nKupyansk sits on a hill that slopes down to the Oskil River. The main bridge\nhad been destroyed, but a makeshift earthwork allowed vehicles to cross. Tank\nwreckage littered the mud, and smoke meant to thwart laser-guided missiles\nbillowed from a cannister.\n\nThe front line was less than ten miles away, and the battalion had chosen a\nvillage between there and the Oskil for its temporary headquarters. About two\nhundred members of the unit would be participating in the mission; they had\nbeen on the ground for barely seventy-two hours but had already scouted the no\nman\u2019s land, established sniper positions, and begun shelling Tabaivka with\nartillery. The officers had not yet found a suitable location in which to base\nthemselves and were working out of a box truck whose interior had been\nconverted into a mobile operations center.\n\nThe commander sat at the head of a table, studying a map. His call sign was\nPerun\u2014the name of a Zeus-like god from Slavic mythology\u2014and he looked the\npart. He was tall and trim, with a razored scalp and a traditional Cossack\nmustache that drooped to his jaw. He\u2019d served in the Army for five years in\nthe early two-thousands, and was discharged when he was twenty-five. As a\ncivilian, Perun built a lucrative business fabricating and installing doors\nwith intercom systems, which are ubiquitous in Ukraine. Many of his customers\nwere in the Donbas, the eastern region where, in 2014, Russia incited and\nbacked a separatist uprising. Perun continued to work there, regularly\ncrossing separatist checkpoints in a van loaded with doors and welding\nequipment. He sometimes transported rifles and explosives, which he used to\nassassinate Russian agents and their local proxies. Perun said that he\nperformed his guerrilla activities on his own, \u201cunofficially,\u201d without\noversight from the Ukrainian government. \u201cNo one suspected me,\u201d he recounted.\n\u201cI was wearing overalls, and I had my tools.\u201d His doors were so heavy that\nsoldiers never bothered to look underneath them.\n\nAfter Russia launched its full-scale invasion, in February, 2022, Perun joined\na reconnaissance unit and assembled a small team that ambushed and sabotaged\nRussian forces behind the lines. He named the team the Wild Fields, a\nhistorical term for the Pontic-Caspian steppe. The Wild Fields earned a\nreputation for audacity and effectiveness, and was integrated into the 1st\nSeparate Assault Battalion, which at the time was led by Dmytro Kotsiubailo, a\ntwenty-seven-year-old who went by the call sign da Vinci. Kotsiubailo was both\nthe youngest battalion commander in the Ukrainian military and among its most\ncelebrated. He was killed in March, 2023, outside Bakhmut, and subsequent\ninternal disputes culminated in about half his former subordinates\ntransferring to a different brigade. Perun was placed in charge of running the\nassault missions for those who remained.\n\nDa Vinci\u2019s death, like the fall of Bakhmut, a couple of months later,\nreflected a grim shift in the war, which has devolved into an attritional\ngrind with catastrophic losses on both sides. It is unknown how many Ukrainian\nservice members have been killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky has put the\ntoll at thirty-one thousand, but that figure is risible\u2014the real number is\nmuch higher. Perun attributed the stalemate and the soaring casualty numbers\nin part to the \u201crecklessness\u201d of Ukrainian commanders who lacked \u201cmilitary\ncunning.\u201d He criticized his country\u2019s prevailing approach as too much like\nRussia\u2019s: \u201cgenerals drawing arrows on a map\u201d and \u201cthrowing piles of people\ninto frontal attacks.\u201d He had little formal education in strategy\u2014on paper, he\nwas a lieutenant\u2014but his exploits in the Donbas and with the Wild Fields had\ntaught him the importance of guile and creativity in the face of a more\npowerful adversary. The plan that he had devised to retake Tabaivka would rely\non both.\n\nMost of the civilian population had fled the village where the battalion had\nbased itself, leaving plenty of empty homes for the soldiers to commandeer.\nThe day after I met Perun, the operations center was moved into a basement\nwith a low concrete ceiling and a dirt floor. Bricks and refuse had been\nshoved aside, fluorescent tube lights installed, salvaged chairs and tables\narrayed. Monitors showed aerial footage from surveillance drones, and various\nradios and landline telephones blinked in a corner. On the wall hung a flag\nwith the Wild Fields insignia: an angel of death playing a flute while sitting\natop three skulls, with a raven on his shoulder. \u201cThe raven represents our\naccumulated wisdom,\u201d Perun told me. \u201cThe flute symbolizes the fact that we\ntreat our work as an art. We derive a kind of joy from it\u2014not from killing\npeople but from the successful execution of our tasks.\u201d\n\nAn eighty-six-inch digital interactive panel, fixed to an easel, displayed a\nsatellite image of Tabaivka. On the southern and eastern margins of the map,\nseveral tree stands were circled in red: they belonged to the Russians. On the\nwestern margin, a series of blue triangles along an elevated ridge indicated\nUkrainian trenches. Between the two lay the zone from which Ukrainian forces\nhad retreated\u2014a wide swath of wetland and scattered brush, with a few\ndemolished farmhouses\u2014divided into forty-two numbered squares, each a couple\nof acres in size. Although a Russian platoon of up to thirty soldiers now\noccupied this zone, the squares were blue, because Perun intended to make them\nUkrainian again.\n\nA road descending from the ridge cut straight through Tabaivka, and the\nconventional thing to do would have been to send some tanks or armored\nvehicles down it. Recent technological developments have made such brute\nassaults suicidal, however. Last year, the Ukrainians began experimenting with\na new kind of drone, called an F.P.V., for \u201cfirst-person view.\u201d The name\nrefers to the video goggles that the pilots wear, which resemble virtual-\nreality headsets. Paradoxically, the key innovation of F.P.V.s is their\nrudimentary design: they are smaller and lighter than commercial drones,\nmaking them quicker and more maneuverable, and they consist of cheap\ncomponents, some of which can be 3-D-printed. Most F.P.V.s are sacrificed as\nkamikaze weapons, with payloads zip-tied to their frames. It is exceedingly\ndifficult to shell mobile targets; F.P.V.s can just crash into them.\n\nAlthough Ukraine introduced F.P.V.s to the war, Russia promptly grasped their\nutility and now mass-produces them. The proliferation of F.P.V.s has rendered\nall front-line troop movements, especially in vehicles, vulnerable to\nprecision strikes. This outcome is emblematic of a vicious cycle in which\nRussia absorbs Ukrainian ingenuity and turns it back against Ukraine, spurring\nfurther lethal ingenuity. \u201cThey learn,\u201d Perun said. \u201cAt the start of the war,\nwe were killing them easily. But everything has changed.\u201d\n\nDuring the first few days that I spent with the battalion, five men were\nwounded and hospitalized after being spotted by drones. A sniper was attacked\nby a swarm of F.P.V.s that snagged and detonated in the tree branches above\nhis foxhole, sparing him. The sniper told me that he\u2019d heard the drones\nzipping down at high speeds, which led him to suppose that their pilots were\nnovices: usually F.P.V.s descend slowly through the canopy, then accelerate at\nyou.\n\nPerun had decided that, instead of a mechanized blitz, a small number of his\nsoldiers would infiltrate Tabaivka stealthily on foot. These men would then\nskirt the contested zone of blue squares, hook behind the Russian platoon, and\ntrap it against the Ukrainians on the ridge. Because surveillance drones are\nnow typically equipped with thermal cameras that register the heat signatures\nof human bodies, the cover of darkness would be insufficient for the team to\nelude detection. The mission was therefore contingent on weather that would\nprevent both Ukrainian and Russian drones from flying. \u201cWe need to do it\nblindly,\u201d Perun explained. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to use the element of surprise to\nappear where they\u2019re not expecting us.\u201d\n\nHeavy snow was forecast for the coming days.\n\nPerun knew that the Russians could dispatch reinforcements down the road that\nbisected Tabaivka, and he wanted to deprive them of that option ahead of the\ninfiltration, by blowing up a small bridge over a creek. Such a job would\nnormally fall to sappers, but Perun had at his disposal an electric land drone\nwith all-terrain tires and a rocket launcher, as well as an F.P.V. controller\nand goggles. The device had been built in one of his company\u2019s factories. I\nlater visited the factory, which his twenty-three-year-old daughter, Yulia,\nmanaged. She showed me several rejected prototypes of the land drone, in a\nwarehouse full of lathes, planers, mills, and other metalworking tools used\nfor making intercom doors.\n\nOutside the operations center, a soldier hitched a small trailer to the back\nof the land drone, which was a bit bigger than a Radio Flyer wagon, and loaded\nit with thirty antitank mines. The soldier was code-named Chub; two decades\nearlier, he\u2019d served in the Army with Perun. Chub had gone on to become an\nelectrical engineer, honing his faculty for all things mechanical and\ncomputational. When I asked his age, he said, \u201cForty-two years, three months,\nand one day.\u201d He\u2019d joined the battalion \u201ca year and ten days ago,\u201d and had\nbeen a reconnaissance soldier until he was wounded in Bakhmut. Now he walked\nwith a limp. The land drone, which Chub had helped develop while recovering\nfrom his injury, included a flat platform on which he could ride to and from\nTabaivka. A pin in the hitch could be retracted via the controller, enabling\nChub to deposit the mine-stacked trailer remotely. Later, in an apartment that\nhe shared with Perun\u2014and where I was also staying\u2014I watched Chub rig up an\nantenna for the controller with wires, tape, and a fishing rod.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how this thing works, but it brings me an endless amount of\njoy.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Lonnie Millsap\n\nLink copied\n\nThe antenna\u2019s range was less than a mile, meaning that Chub would have to\nsneak beyond the Ukrainian-held ridge to insure a stable connection. When I\nasked whether he was nervous about venturing into the no man\u2019s land with more\nthan six hundred pounds of T.N.T., he answered in his typically logical\nfashion: \u201cThe main thing is not that you are not afraid\u2014everyone is afraid.\nThe ones who were not afraid were the first to be killed.\u201d The main thing was\nnot to \u201cbreak down because of fear.\u201d\n\nSome days later, a monitor in the operations center relayed a live aerial feed\nof the land drone travelling up the road into Tabaivka. The electric motor was\nalmost invisible on the thermal video: a faint smudge that you would not have\nnoticed unless you were looking for it. When Chub triggered a detonator lodged\nin one of the mines, an enormous cloud of flame roiled up from the now\nimpassable bridge.\n\nWhile Chub had been loading the trailer, a woman walking up the street,\npushing a bicycle, had stopped to watch. Chub had stared at her until she\u2019d\ncontinued on her way. \u201cI suspect everyone,\u201d he told me. \u201cLocals sometimes help\nthe Russians.\u201d\n\nIn February, 2022, while Ukrainian forces scrambled to defend Kyiv from an\narmored Russian column bearing south from Belarus, other Russian contingents,\napproaching from the east, encountered less resistance. After the mayor of\nKupyansk received a phone call from a Russian commander, he surrendered the\ncity without a fight. (Ukraine later charged the mayor, in absentia, with\ntreason.) Some residents of Kupyansk confronted Russian soldiers in the\nstreets, but dissent was soon quashed; later investigations revealed\nexecutions and cases of torture. In the village where 1st Battalion was based,\na small grocery store had stayed open throughout the Russian occupation. \u201cIt\nwas hell,\u201d Lyuda, a forty-five-year-old cashier, told me. She excused herself\nand went into a back room; when she returned, I saw that she\u2019d been crying.\nShe described a tyrannical regime of arbitrary abuse and detention, murders,\nand constant dread exacerbated by an \u201cinformational vacuum.\u201d Without Internet\nor cell service, the only news source had been a single Russian radio station.\n\nSix months into the occupation, the Ukrainian military stunned Russia with a\nlightning offensive in the Kharkiv region, liberating dozens of towns and\ncities, including Kupyansk. When the Russians withdrew from Lyuda\u2019s village,\nshe believed that the worst was over. Her optimism had since turned to\ndespair. The war was inching back. One night, Perun and Chub\u2019s apartment was\nshaken by a series of blasts, accompanied by bright flashes, and the next\nmorning I found neighbors repairing broken doors and nailing plywood over\nshattered windows. A kitchen had been levelled. A seventy-year-old retired\nfarmer named Volodymyr, with gold teeth and plastic-framed glasses, was\ninspecting a front gate that had been blown off its hinges. He\u2019d built the\nhouse himself, more than twenty years ago. \u201cI love this land,\u201d Volodymyr told\nme. \u201cI\u2019ll stay until they kill me.\u201d\n\nLyuda was less resolute. She\u2019d sent her daughter away, and her husband was now\nfighting on the southern front. Her bags were packed: she was prepared to\nleave the moment the Russians broke through from Tabaivka. \u201cIf they come back,\nI think it will be another Bucha,\u201d she said, referring to mass killings that\noccurred outside Kyiv in 2022.\n\nThere was more at stake than just the village. If Russian forces reached the\nOskil River, Ukrainian units to the east of Kupyansk would be imperilled.\nEliminating a platoon in Tabaivka wouldn\u2019t stop the Russians, but it was a\nstep toward putting them on the defensive. One of the tree stands circled in\nred on the map was believed to conceal hundreds of enemy troops, and the\nforthcoming assault would help interrupt their supply routes. Perun was\ndetermined to avoid a direct clash with those soldiers. In July, during the\ncounter-offensive, he had been ordered to recapture similar terrain elsewhere\non the front\u2014and to do so immediately, without conducting proper\nreconnaissance or formulating a plan. \u201cWe were just hurled straight at them,\u201d\none 1st Battalion officer recounted. \u201cLike two freight trains colliding.\u201d A\nnine-hour firefight ensued. Eighteen members of the battalion were killed and\nmany more were wounded.\n\nAccording to the officer, the higher Ukrainian command was \u201calways pushing us\nto work quicker, quicker,\u201d no matter the cost. While Perun was waiting for it\nto snow, he received daily phone calls from superiors who wanted to launch the\nmission regardless of the weather. \u201cColonels see war as an opportunity to\nbecome generals,\u201d he told me; generals were less interested in the welfare of\ntheir troops than in \u201csquabbles over military decorations.\u201d Perun had no\ncareer ambitions in the Army, affording him a degree of independence. When I\nasked how he handled pressure from superiors, he said, \u201cI smile and ignore\nthem.\u201d Of course, that was an oversimplification, and I had the sense that\npreserving the lives of his men required Perun to play two games of \u201cmilitary\ncunning\u201d simultaneously: one against the enemy, the other against his own\nhierarchy.\n\nWe\u2019d been in the village for almost a week when Perun summoned his officers\nand sergeants to the operations center. Time was running out. He was worried\nthat if they delayed much longer they might be redeployed to another hot spot,\nwasting their meticulous preparations for Tabaivka. After going over some\nadjustments to the plan, Perun turned to a thirty-five-year-old junior\nlieutenant who stood in front of the interactive panel, peering at the map\nthrough prescription ballistic glasses.\n\n\u201cDo you agree?\u201d Perun asked him.\n\nThe lieutenant, whose call sign was Sever, would lead the twelve-man team of\nshturmoviki, or \u201cstormers,\u201d spearheading the ground assault. Unlike Perun,\nnothing about Sever suggested his vocation. He was short, with a slight\npaunch, and so soft-spoken that you had to strain to hear him. A bandage was\ntaped across his brow. The previous night, he\u2019d been riding in the bed of a\ntruck that had plowed into a crater. One of his men had broken a leg.\n\nSever pointed at a tree line circled in red. A three-hundred-yard gap\nseparated it from the blue squares. \u201cIf we\u2019re forced to fight them, I\u2019ll need\nmore people,\u201d he said.\n\nPerun scoffed, \u201cYou are proposing more people so that you can attack the tree\nline? This is a stupid idea, Sever, honestly.\u201d He reminded the lieutenant that\nthe objective was to flank the Russians in the blue squares without being\nnoticed. The three-hundred-yard gap was a natural buffer that neither Russian\nnor Ukrainian forces could traverse without exposing themselves to enemy fire.\nPerun chided Sever: \u201cImagine a machine gun opens up on you\u2014what will you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cPull back a bit, and then kill the fucker.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my experience, when the machine gun opens up, everyone will shit his pants\nand fall to the ground where he\u2019s standing.\u201d\n\nSever grinned and conceded, \u201cOne hundred per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not repeat the mistake of moving big groups and getting them killed,\u201d\nanother officer said. \u201cThe smaller the group, the harder it will be to spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to keep the plan as it is,\u201d Perun told Sever. \u201cBut it\u2019s up to\nyou. If you want more guys, tell me how many and what you will do with them.\u201d\n\nSever approached the interactive panel. He\u2019d been fighting off and on for\nalmost a decade, since Russian forces had first entered the Donbas. He had no\nwife or children; he\u2019d mordantly joked to me, \u201cI\u2019m the ideal soldier.\u201d He\nwould rather have become an architect or a builder. \u201cI always dreamed of\nmaking a bridge or a house, creating something useful,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cNow I just\ndestroy bridges and houses. I guess it\u2019s my fate to leave destruction behind\nme.\u201d\n\nMost of the veterans in the battalion had been so close to death so many times\nthat they seemed to have accepted its company, and this acceptance appeared to\nhave fostered uncannily placid demeanors. Sever, though, was an extreme case.\nHis movements were sluggish, his handshake limp, and a deep ruefulness\ninformed his subdued speech. All this felt less symptomatic of inward calm\nthan of profound fatigue and, perhaps, depression. Nevertheless, according to\nPerun, Sever was the battalion\u2019s most aggressive officer, often to the point\nof heedlessness. \u201cWhen he asks for more people, I know what he wants to do,\u201d\nPerun said. \u201cSo I try to cool him down.\u201d\n\nSever turned from the map and shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s leave it as it is,\u201d he told\nPerun.\n\nIn the trench warfare of eastern Ukraine, assault units such as 1st Battalion\nmove the line forward\u2014then regular infantry units must hold and defend it. The\nsoldiers who would assume responsibility for Tabaivka if 1st Battalion\nreclaimed it belonged to a brigade in the Territorial Defense Forces, or\nT.D.F. After Russia\u2019s invasion, the T.D.F., a type of national guard, absorbed\nmore than a hundred thousand civilian volunteers and reservists. Most were\ninitially posted to checkpoints and other rearward duties in their native\nregions, but that changed as the Army hemorrhaged personnel. The T.D.F.\nbrigade assigned to Tabaivka came from Lviv, in western Ukraine, and many of\nits members had enlisted at the war\u2019s outset; presumably, few of them\nenvisaged fighting two years later, seven hundred miles from home.\n\nA few nights after the briefing in the operations center, Sever visited a\nhouse where twelve T.D.F. soldiers were lodging. During the mission, they\nwould follow behind Sever and his stormers, digging trenches and foxholes and\nremaining in the positions that the team cleared. Sever called them \u201cthe\nanchor group.\u201d When he entered the house, the men were crammed into a bedroom\nwith a foldout couch and framed photographs of the family that once lived\nthere. They had not yet unpacked, having just arrived. They were replacements\nfor a previous anchor group whose members I had met the night before. Those\nmen had told me that their commander had tricked them into volunteering for\nthe mission by assuring them that they would be guarding a base. When I\u2019d\nasked how they felt now that they knew the truth, their leader replied, \u201cI\nhave two young children and a pregnant wife\u2014how do you think I feel?\u201d Although\nthey had been deployed in eastern Ukraine for the past year, they were aghast\nat the prospect of flanking around a Russian platoon. \u201cWhat these guys are\ndoing is crazy,\u201d one of them said. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve been through is nothing\ncompared with this.\u201d Another soldier was so anxious that he had trouble\ntalking. At one point, he had to take a homeopathic sedative; a nurse had\ngiven him the medicine some months earlier, when he\u2019d vomited in a morgue\nwhile identifying a comrade. The morning after I met the men, all twelve\nreported that they were ill or otherwise unfit to go to Tabaivka.\n\nSever had the substitutes gather around him, and explained to them what their\nrole would entail. He emphasized that anyone who didn\u2019t wish to participate\nshould say so. \u201cI won\u2019t judge you,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t curse you. I don\u2019t\ndemand anything now\u2014but, when we cross the line, then I will make demands.\u201d He\nwent on, \u201cIf you hesitate, if you stumble, nothing good will happen. So we\nmust work together. On my side, I promise that I will not abandon you, and I\nexpect the same from you.\u201d\n\nNobody spoke. Before Sever left, he said, \u201cIf we\u2019re together, we have to fight\ntogether, for one another. There is no other option.\u201d\n\nSever\u2019s deputy, a sergeant called Casper, took over the meeting. Casper was\ngruffer, louder, and less stoic than Sever, as well as more ready to judge and\nto curse. He\u2019d spent four days tutoring the previous anchor group\u2014teaching\nthem how to space their foxholes, move silently, hide from F.P.V.s\u2014and his\npatience had waned. \u201cThe task will be hard, but it\u2019s doable,\u201d he told the new\ngroup. According to Casper, only a serious health ailment constituted a\nlegitimate excuse to back out.\n\nAn older man with hunched shoulders and a hangdog expression, who\u2019d been\nsitting mutely in the corner, announced that he had an eye condition. Another\nman claimed to have the flu. A third complained of a kidney disorder.\n\n\u201cI need to hear whether you can execute the mission or not,\u201d Casper barked.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t, we won\u2019t be able to execute ours. . . . So will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do such a mission,\u201d one of the men, who looked more able-bodied\nthan many in the group, said. He was a thirty-nine-year-old factory worker.\nSix months earlier, he had been picked up by conscription agents while walking\nto a bus stop. His issue was not physical, he admitted. \u201cOnce, we were ordered\nto attack,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt sick and just fell down.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Roz Chast\n\nLink copied\n\n\u201cPanic?\u201d Casper asked.\n\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s happened twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame with me,\u201d Casper told him. \u201cI\u2019ve panicked and fallen down. But then I\ngot up.\u201d He went on, \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, it\u2019s going to be tough. But, fuck,\nnot going because you\u2019re scared? Don\u2019t worry, when you get there you\u2019ll be\nswitched on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a burden to the group,\u201d the draftee persisted.\n\nYet another soldier spoke up: there was a problem with his spine.\n\n\u201cWhat fucking problem?\u201d Casper shouted. \u201cCan you walk? If you can walk, you\ncan do this. Tell me straight\u2014are you weaseling out or not?\u201d\n\nThe man appeared to be in his fifties. Whether or not he really had a problem\nwith his spine, he looked dejected and perhaps ashamed.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d he muttered.\n\nIn the end, Casper sent him back to his unit, along with the draftee. He\nshared more of Sever\u2019s tolerance than I\u2019d anticipated. He later told me,\n\u201cBefore the war, they were simple blue-collar workers, just like our guys. But\nours get good training and these ones don\u2019t.\u201d A soldier in the first anchor\ngroup had told Casper that, during the counter-offensive, \u201cour commander just\npointed where to go and then disappeared\u2014there were tanks in front of us, but\nhe didn\u2019t care.\u201d After two-thirds of the battalion had been killed or wounded,\nthe survivors were merged with another T.D.F. unit, which had suffered\ncomparable losses. The men hardly knew their new superiors, or even one\nanother. They had been sent to Casper without aid kits or proper winter\nclothing. \u201cTheir commanders don\u2019t give a shit about them,\u201d Casper said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their own, so they\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nMany members of 1st Battalion contended that leadership was the crucial factor\ndifferentiating the professionalism and esprit de corps of their unit from the\nineptitude and demoralization of others. \u201cThe soldiers aren\u2019t the problem\u2014it\u2019s\nhow they\u2019re being used,\u201d Sever said. He and Casper cited Perun\u2019s history of\nfighting alongside them as fundamental to his authority and to the trust that\nthey placed in him. Perun told me it was occasionally incumbent on him to\ndemonstrate that, \u201cjust as my guys make sacrifices, I am also willing to make\nsacrifices.\u201d During an assault this past autumn, Perun kicked a grenade away\nfrom several of his men. The explosion burst his eardrums, and he\u2019d since\nreceived an implant and undergone surgery to graft tissue from the inside of\nhis cheek onto the damaged membrane.\n\nAn exemplary command culture was not 1st Battalion\u2019s only advantage; unlike\nthe T.D.F., it was able to select its members. Sever and Casper recruited\ntheir stormers, from Ukraine\u2019s national basic-training camps. Physical\nprowess, age, education, and even skills were less important than a display of\nheart. \u201cBut you never know until they go through it if it\u2019s sincere,\u201d Sever\nsaid. When I asked Casper how he picked candidates, he answered, \u201cThe eyes\u2014if\nthey\u2019re true.\u201d\n\nPerun, the commander of the assault mission, in the operations center. He\nwatched aerial drone footage as Russian grenades, appearing onscreen as black\nsplashes, exploded around his men.\n\nThe men Sever and Casper chose were not always whom you would expect. The\nmorning of the mission, I went to the house where the stormers were staying.\nIt was a little before 3 a.m.; in the kitchen, a forty-five-year-old soldier\ncalled Noah was swathing a sprained ankle with a compression wrap. He\u2019d been a\nnarcotics detective in Odesa until 2007, when he was accused of a variety of\ncrimes, including falsifying official documents, dealing drugs, and unlawful\nimprisonment. When I first met him, he told me, \u201cIn those days, there wasn\u2019t\nmuch difference between the gangsters and the cops.\u201d His mistake had been\nantagonizing the local prosecutor\u2019s office, which, according to Noah, was as\ncorrupt as the police. He\u2019d spent two and a half years in pretrial detention,\nthen paid a bribe to be released. After another decade of\ndelinquency\u2014burglary, bank fraud, robbing cars\u2014he\u2019d joined a Catholic commune.\nHe retained a monkish aspect: a shaved head, a bushy goatee, a wooden rosary.\n\nAnother stormer, Sanjek, entered the kitchen in long underwear and heated some\nwater on the stove. He had also been in jail\u2014though he wouldn\u2019t tell me why.\nWhen I asked how long he\u2019d been in for, he quipped, \u201cWhich time?\u201d\n\nNeither man considered himself especially patriotic. For Noah, service was\nredemptive: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of bad things in my life, and now I\u2019m doing\nsomething good.\u201d Sanjek had volunteered for the Army ten months earlier, after\ncompleting his most recent stint in prison. \u201cHere and there is almost the same\nthing\u2014it\u2019s like a family,\u201d he\u2019d told me earlier. \u201cThe difference is that here\nI\u2019m sure my friends will help me if I\u2019m in trouble. There, they\u2019ll check my\npockets.\u201d\n\nTurning from the stove, he asked Noah, \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cBad.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Noah said.\n\nSanjek asked for one of Noah\u2019s \u201cpills.\u201d Some Ukrainian and Russian soldiers\nare known to consume amphetamines, but Perun enforced a strict prohibition\nagainst drugs and alcohol while the battalion was deployed. Casper had punched\na T.D.F. member in the face for getting drunk, leaving him with a swollen jaw.\nStill, when Noah handed Sanjek two white caplets, I privately wondered if he\nwas not quite as reformed as he\u2019d claimed to be.\n\nNoah explained that the pills were medication that induced constipation. The\nmission would last at least thirty-six hours, during which time there might\nnot be an opportunity to defecate safely. (Another stormer told me that he\ntook laxatives after returning from assaults, to counteract the effect.)\n\nSanjek nudged a heavyset soldier who was snoring on the couch: \u201cGet up, the\nRussians aren\u2019t going to kill themselves.\u201d\n\nThe soldier was a thirty-three-year-old railroad worker called Kamin. He\u2019d\njoined the battalion a year earlier, with four other recruits. Three of them\nhad been killed and the other medically discharged. This past fall, Kamin\nspent twenty days in the hospital after a Russian threw a grenade at him while\nhe and Noah were retrieving dead comrades following a bloody firefight in\nOctober.\n\n\u201cWho stole my fucking belt?\u201d he grumbled, stepping into camouflage pants.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with people?\u201d\n\nSoon, the rest of the stormers had congregated in the kitchen. Most of them\nwere newcomers, and this would be their first assault. Their backpacks\ncontained hundreds of rounds of ammunition, to refill the preloaded magazines\non their flak jackets. For sustenance, each man brought two litres of water, a\ncouple of Snickers bars, beef jerky, and cigarettes. They were not taking\nsleeping bags, because they would not sleep. The men would walk for miles and\nneeded to be mindful of weight. They had gas masks, compasses, maps, cell\nphones, power banks, night-vision monoculars, thermal-imaging visors, and\nmedical supplies. There would be no medevac option. If someone was wounded, he\nwould have to wait until the following night to be hauled up the ridge. Each\nstormer carried at least eight hand grenades. Strapped onto their packs were\nshovels, which were wrapped in cloth so that they wouldn\u2019t clank. Fixed-blade\nknives, attached to their vests, would help them hack open icy ground.\n\nIt was twenty-four degrees Fahrenheit outside. To reach the blue squares on\nthe map, the stormers would have to cross a swamp that had not frozen solid.\nThey had been issued knee-high rubber shells to cover their boots, but they\nwere short a pair. Sever had simply tied plastic garbage bags around his feet.\nOfficers were often the best-equipped members of other units I\u2019d observed, but\nthe lieutenant said that \u201cit should be the opposite.\u201d\n\nSanjek spritzed cologne around his neck gaiter. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your rifles,\u201d\nSever deadpanned as the team filed out of the house. A pickup truck and two\ncargo vans were waiting on the street. Their tail-lights dwindled as they\nheaded east.\n\nIt began snowing shortly after dawn. The stormers and the anchor group had\nmade it to the Ukrainian trenches on the ridge and were waiting to infiltrate\nTabaivka. In the operations center, a monitor on a table played aerial footage\nof the settlement from a surveillance drone. If Ukrainian drones could still\nfly, so could Russian ones. \u201cHow is the weather?\u201d Perun asked the pilot over a\nDiscord channel on a laptop.\n\n\u201cWorkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want it to be unworkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d\n\nThe pilot was a red-bearded bricklayer from the Carpathian Mountains called\nBoyko. He\u2019d been working in the Netherlands when the war erupted and had\nrushed home to be with his family. He had three young children, which exempted\nhim from service, but he had volunteered anyway. Drones both fascinated and\ndisconcerted him. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how fast the technology is developing\nhere,\u201d he\u2019d told me. His team had transformed an apartment into a workshop\ncluttered with wires, explosives, batteries, and circuit boards. In the living\nroom, crates and Styrofoam boxes containing artisanal F.P.V.s were stacked\nfrom floor to ceiling. Boyko foresaw a bleak future\u2014on and off the\nbattlefield\u2014in which \u201call these things being tested in this war will become\npowerful tools of oppression.\u201d When he started using F.P.V.s, last summer,\ntheir maximum range was about two miles; now it was twelve. Still, whereas\nsurveillance drones hover at high altitudes, F.P.V.s must swoop low to hit\ntheir targets, requiring tall antennas on the ground to maintain a connection\nwith the controller. Antennas are like flagsticks for enemy drones, and Boyko\nhad already been the victim of an air strike in Tabaivka that nearly killed\nhim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. Wonderful\u2019s been done.\u201d\n\nCartoon by William Haefeli\n\nLink copied\n\nAs the snow intensified, the feed on the monitor started to glitch. Boyko\nreported that it was no longer possible to fly, and Sever and the stormers\nbegan descending the ridge toward the blue squares. \u201cMaximum attention!\nMaximum caution!\u201d Perun exhorted them from the operations center. Half a dozen\nof his officers sat in chairs, staring fixedly at the monitor, which was now\nblank. Perun was too restless to sit. He paced the basement and cracked his\nknuckles, switching his attention from the radio to the Discord channel to\nSignal messages on his phone.\n\nThree Ukrainian machine gunners were spread out on the high terrain above\nTabaivka, and three snipers were hidden below them; suddenly, one of the\nsnipers spotted an enemy squad moving in the Russian-held trees to the east of\nthe three-hundred-yard gap.\n\nPerun, striding to the interactive panel, bellowed, \u201cAzimuth!\u201d He was asking\nhow many degrees to the north or south the Russians were from the sniper\u2019s\nposition. Using a compass, the sniper took the bearing and relayed the\nmeasurement to Perun. On the satellite map, Perun plotted a line along that\nangle from the sniper to the stand of trees, thereby obtaining a grid\nco\u00f6rdinate on which to call in artillery. He also plotted a line from the grid\nco\u00f6rdinate back to one of his machine gunners on the high ground. Although the\nmachine gunner couldn\u2019t see the Russians, he could aim his weapon along the\nangle that Perun gave him. The sniper, through his scope, observed where the\nrounds made impact in the snow. Perun passed the information on to the machine\ngunner, who zeroed in on the Russian squad by lowering or raising his barrel\naccordingly.\n\nIt was disorienting to watch Perun orchestrate all this remotely and without\nvideo\u2014\u201cblindly,\u201d as he\u2019d put it. The Russians, still oblivious of the stormers\ncreeping through the swamp, were pounding the Ukrainian trenches on the ridge\nwith artillery, and I knew that Tabaivka must be quaking with a ferocious\ncacophony of explosions and gunfire. In the stand of trees, wounded and\nfrightened Russians were probably crying out. It was hard for me to correlate\nthat reality with the scene in the basement, where officers were quietly\nsipping plastic cups of tea. Perun, however, acted exactly as if he were on\nthe line, stridently hollering over the din of battle. He\u2019d warned me that he\nwould be yelling and using a lot of \u201cbad words\u201d\u2014not from anger but\ndeliberately, to impress on his men the urgency of his commands. When Boyko\nflew his drone too close to the stormers, who mistook it as Russian, Perun\nroared at him, \u201cIf you do that one more fucking time, I\u2019ll send you on the\nassault, so you can feel what it\u2019s like to have some asshole over your head!\u201d;\nwhen someone accidentally left his radio on, Perun told him, \u201cI will rip open\nyour fucking mouth!\u201d; and, when a machine gunner advised that the artillery\nshould shift \u201ca bit to the right,\u201d Perun responded, \u201cGive me the azimuth,\nfucker! I\u2019m going to stick that compass up your ass!\u201d\n\nSeveral soldiers later told me that Perun\u2019s harsh manner was helpful.\nAccording to Sever, \u201cWhen you\u2019re stressed and afraid, you can go numb.\nSometimes yelling like that is the only thing that can penetrate.\u201d In the\nfield, the soldiers wore earpieces, so Perun was literally a voice in their\nheads.\n\nBy the afternoon, while the Russians remained focussed on the ridge, Sever and\nthe other stormers had navigated around the blue squares without firing a\nshot. On the way, they\u2019d taken two Russians prisoner. No sooner had the anchor\ngroup joined Sever\u2019s team on the far side of the squares than the snow\nabruptly stopped and drones were in the air again.\n\n\u201cThank God,\u201d Perun said. \u201cJust in time.\u201d\n\nNow that the stormers had successfully bypassed the Russian platoon, Perun\nwanted them to hunker down for the night. They would assault the next day, in\nthe light. \u201cDig as much as you can and cover yourselves with ponchos or\nbranches, so that you won\u2019t be seen by thermal,\u201d he radioed Sever. \u201cDig like a\nmole if you don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nThe T.D.F. soldiers were not complying. They were refusing to entrench\nthemselves, objecting that the place Sever had chosen was too exposed. \u201cSmack\nthem with the fucking shovel,\u201d Perun told Sever. But the men remained\nobstinate, and when Perun attempted to contact them they did not answer. It\nwas getting dark. Perun summoned a potbellied officer from the T.D.F. brigade\nto the operations center. \u201cYou are their commander,\u201d he told the man. \u201cWe\u2019ll\ndo our job, and then we\u2019ll leave. The question is, how will you control your\nmen?\u201d Perun\u2019s contempt was palpable. He suggested that the officer go out\nhimself, at least as far as the ridge, and offered him transportation in an\narmored vehicle. There was an element of shaming\u2014Perun\u2019s staff was watching.\nOn one of the basement walls, a couple of feet away from the officer, someone\nhad mounted a framed portrait of da Vinci, the renowned commander who had died\nin Bakhmut.\n\nThe officer declined Perun\u2019s proposal.\n\nSever found a compromise location for the anchor group. That night, he sent a\nsoldier back to Perun, with the two Russian captives. I found them the next\nmorning in a basement adjacent to the operations center, sitting on the floor\nwith their hands bound behind their backs and tape over their eyes. A member\nof 1st Battalion was asking them questions and typing their responses into his\nphone. He was a thirty-one-year-old I.T. professional called Litsey. He\u2019d\nlived in Kharkiv before the war, in the same building as Perun\u2019s daughter,\nYulia, and the two men had met while Perun was renovating Yulia\u2019s apartment.\nLitsey told me that Perun had been \u201ca completely different person\u201d during\npeacetime\u2014easygoing and affable. He added, \u201cYou would never have guessed that\nhe was rich. He was driving around an old van full of construction materials.\u201d\n\nLitsey was a signals-intelligence specialist. He had grown up in\nSeverodonetsk\u2014which Russian shelling had reduced to a wasteland, and which was\nnow under Russian occupation\u2014and he was more expressive of his hatred for\nRussians than were other members of the battalion, some of whom could be\nsurprisingly magnanimous. (\u201cThey\u2019re human like we are,\u201d Perun said. \u201cThey love\ntheir wives, their children.\u201d) Of the two prisoners, Litsey had told me, \u201cThe\nonly reason we\u2019re keeping them alive is so we can exchange them.\u201d However, in\nthe basement he betrayed none of his enmity, speaking politely to the men as\nsoon as they proved co\u00f6perative. At the end of the interrogation, he stuck\ncigarettes in their mouths and lit them.\n\nI later interviewed the men myself, after their guard agreed to remove their\nblindfolds and let them sit in chairs. Both were named Alexei. They had been\nin the military for only a couple of months and on the front for only a few\ndays. They\u2019d been sent on their own to a grid co\u00f6rdinate in Tabaivka, with a\nmandate to remain there until they were relieved. Carrying a litre and a half\nof water and two cans of smoked fish, they walked to the position using\nAlpineQuest, a Spanish navigation app designed for trekking. (Litsey later\nuploaded the AlpineQuest data from their phones onto the interactive panel,\nadding a number of enemy positions to the satellite map.) When the Alexeis\narrived at their destination, there was no dugout or trench, and they had no\nshovels. They radioed their commander, who told them to dig with their hands.\nThe first two nights, they slept on the forest floor, but when it started to\nsnow they abandoned the position, walked to a half-collapsed house, and holed\nup in the basement. That\u2019s where Sever\u2019s team discovered them.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to kill anyone, and I haven\u2019t killed anyone,\u201d the older Alexei\ninsisted. He was forty-three, with gray stubble and a buzz cut. He\u2019d joined\nthe Army for money\u2014like most of his comrades, he said. He\u2019d earned about five\nhundred dollars a month driving a taxi in his home town, outside Moscow. The\nmilitary paid him more than four times that.\n\nThe younger Alexei, who was in his thirties, also claimed to be a victim of\ncircumstance. He\u2019d spent five years in prison for counterfeiting rubles, and\nshortly after his release he was arrested for fighting in a bar. His opponent\nturned out to be a detective, and Alexei was given a choice between enlisting\nand returning to jail. He\u2019d never really considered the ethical dimensions of\nthe war, but he said that he had \u201calways been against authority\u2014against\nPutin.\u201d He\u2019d renounced Christianity and converted to paganism. \u201cI believe in\nthe old gods, like Perun,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the interviews, I stepped outside with the 1st Battalion soldier who\u2019d\nbeen guarding the prisoners. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time during this war I\u2019ve seen\na live one,\u201d he said. He looked perturbed. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking get it. If Ukraine\nwanted to invade Russia, I\u2019d rather go to jail instead.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Alexeis, there were approximately twenty more Russians\nstationed in the blue squares. The majority were sheltering in an underground\nroot cellar in the back yard of another farmhouse. Some of the men in the\ncellar were more senior fighters.\n\nBoyko piloted his drone over the small, fenced-in property where the root\ncellar was situated. What had been a house was now a heap of rubble. Snow\nblanketed the yard, but it was possible to discern the hump of a slightly\ncresting roof with a stovepipe protruding from it. Boyko zoomed in on a trail\nof boot prints near what appeared to be the cellar door.\n\n\u201cAre they going to or from it?\u201d Perun asked.\n\n\u201cLooks like he went to take a shit and came back,\u201d an officer posited.\n\nOther tracks went from the cellar door, which was open, toward the three-\nhundred-yard gap between the blue squares and the Russian-held woods. \u201cThe\nenemy is definitely inside,\u201d Perun said into the radio. Six stormers were\nalready hiding with Sever beneath some trees across a dirt road from the\nproperty. Perun told them to work in pairs: two men would make sure that the\ndestroyed house was empty, two would toss multiple grenades through the cellar\ndoor, and two more would drop additional grenades down the stovepipe. Sever\nwould remain in the trees in order to direct the action. The cellar, made of\nconcrete, was big and deep, according to the Alexeis, and the Russians had\nlikely augmented it with their own fortifications, so the stormers would need\nto use a lot of grenades\u2014at least twenty, Perun said\u2014and throw them down the\nstovepipe and through the entrance simultaneously, before the Russians could\nseal either portal or call for support. Speed was imperative, because the yard\nlacked any cover or protection from Russian artillery and F.P.V.s.\n\n\u201cI understand everyone is exhausted,\u201d Perun said. \u201cBut pull yourselves the\nfuck together. Let\u2019s do this\u2014one final push\u2014and then we can all exhale!\u201d\n\n\u201cRoger,\u201d Sever said. From where he stood, he did not have a good view of the\ncellar, and he began to probe the outskirts of the property. We could see all\nhis movements in the drone footage, which meant that he was dangerously\nvisible. Perun grew agitated. \u201cFucking do this now,\u201d he commanded. \u201cQuicker!\nYou\u2019ve already tugged fate by the balls as it is! Enough, goddammit!\u201d\n\nEarlier in the mission, Sever had been far enough away from Perun that most of\ntheir communications had been passed through a \u201crepeater\u201d stationed on the\nridge, who relayed the messages back and forth. From the root cellar, however,\nno middleman was required. Perun, not realizing this, said to the repeater,\n\u201cTell Sever he must stay in the trees. Otherwise that asshole will try to go\nwith them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis asshole can hear you,\u201d Sever replied.\n\n\u201cO.K., stay where you are, asshole.\u201d\n\nOn the monitor, we watched the six stormers approach the property, in single\nfile. Sanjek, the ex-con, went to the destroyed house with another soldier\nwhile the four others entered the yard. One of them was called Banker, because\nhe had worked for a bank for thirteen years, rising from teller to manager. He\nwas among the most experienced men on the team and had already been wounded by\na Russian drone. When Banker arrived at the rear of the cellar, he noticed a\nnarrow ventilation shaft that Perun had missed on the video feed. Banker\ntossed a single grenade through the shaft. \u201cTo the other side!\u201d Perun yelled.\n\u201cThrow grenades in the entrance, so they don\u2019t come out!\u201d\n\nCartoon by Zachary Kanin\n\nLink copied\n\nAnother pair advanced along the humped roof. On the way, one of them, a young\nsoldier called Kyivstar\u2014the name of Ukraine\u2019s main telecommunications\nnetwork\u2014dropped a grenade down the stovepipe. A dark geyser spurted up. Smoke\nwas now drifting from the ventilation shaft. Because stovepipes and\nventilation shafts typically channel air into root cellars through angled\nconduits behind interior walls, there was a decent chance that the two\ngrenades had inflicted minimal damage\u2014and now the Russians knew that they were\nunder attack.\n\n\u201cGrenades! Grenades!\u201d Perun screamed. \u201cMore! \u201d\n\nThey needed to hit the cellar entrance. Kyivstar\u2019s companion had left him\nbehind and was walking there alone. His call sign was Wolf. He was a welder\nfrom a rural village in western Ukraine who, when the war started, had been\nworking in the Czech Republic, sending money home to his wife and their young\nson and daughter. He\u2019d been with 1st Battalion for about a month, and this was\nhis first mission. Sever hadn\u2019t intended to bring him to Tabaivka, but Wolf\nwas filling in for the soldier who\u2019d broken his leg when their truck crashed\ninto the crater. At the house, Wolf had struck me as the team\u2019s most timid\nmember, sheepishly observing Sanjek and Noah\u2019s shenanigans. When the stormers\nwere leaving for the operation, Banker had scolded Wolf for guzzling a tall\ncan of energy drink, which would make him have to urinate. In the cargo van,\nright before Banker shut the door, Wolf had said, \u201cFuck, I forgot my ballistic\nglasses. Oh, well, whatever.\u201d\n\nHe was now doing something inexplicable. Instead of sneaking up to the cellar\nentrance, he was approaching it openly\u2014revealing himself to anyone who might\nbe watching from inside. \u201cHe was confused,\u201d Kyivstar later told me. \u201cI was\nyelling at him, trying to get him to come back.\u201d He added, with frustration,\n\u201cThere was no need for him to go ahead by himself like that. It was like he\nwas going there to die.\u201d\n\nIn the operations center, Perun yelled into the radio, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t cross in\nfront of the entrance!\u201d But Wolf couldn\u2019t hear him. He kept walking until he\nreached the open door. For several long seconds, everyone in the operations\ncenter watched as he stood there, motionless. Then he crumpled.\n\n\u201cThey got him,\u201d Perun said, not loudly, and not over the radio.\n\nHe tried to reach Sever. When there was no response, he contacted the repeater\non the ridge. \u201cRepeat everything I say,\u201d he told him. \u201c \u2018Climb on top of the\nfucking thing and throw grenades in from above.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe stormers, however, knew something that Perun did not. Wolf had frozen\nbecause he\u2019d been surprised to see, instead of a staircase descending straight\ninto the cellar, a room a couple of yards long and then a second door, which\nwas closed. The staircase was behind that. Wolf had been peering into the room\nwhen someone behind the second door shot him.\n\nKyivstar and Banker backed away from the entrance. Casper, the sergeant\nresponsible for training the anchor group, was in the operations center that\nmorning. Bending close to the monitor, he said of Wolf, \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s\nwounded.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why isn\u2019t he crawling?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t watch this,\u201d Casper said. He turned to leave the operations center\nbut stopped midway. Dark splashes were bursting in the white yard, around the\nentrance, where Wolf lay.\n\nPerun said, \u201cThe fuckers are throwing grenades from inside!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, someone from across the three-hundred-yard gap was firing on the\nteam. Bigger, darker splashes appeared much closer to Kyivstar and Banker.\n\u201cA.G.S.,\u201d Perun said, using the abbreviation for a Russian automatic grenade\nlauncher. \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d\n\nHe ordered the stormers to retreat, and asked Sever whether Wolf showed any\nsigns of life. If he was still alive, they would be unable to shell the area.\n\n\u201cSever can\u2019t say for sure,\u201d the repeater replied.\n\nBoyko zoomed in on the body, which appeared to be lying in a fetal position.\n\u201cGroup decision,\u201d Perun said to his staff. \u201cWhat is his status? Casper?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no movement,\u201d another soldier said.\n\nThe remaining stormers fled the property as more A.G.S. rounds exploded in it.\nPerun told them to get away and find cover. He needed to think about what to\ndo next.\n\nThere were too many Ukrainians in the vicinity to try to destroy the root\ncellar with artillery, and since it was in a defilade, at the bottom of the\nridge, Boyko couldn\u2019t reach it with an F.P.V. The cellar was also inaccessible\nto the land drone, because of the swamp. Ultimately, Perun decided to drop a\nnumber of antitank mines on the entrance with a heavy-duty six-rotor drone\ncalled a Vampire\u2014and known to the Russians as Baba Yaga, after a witchlike\ncharacter from Slavic folklore. The Alexeis had shared the radio frequencies\nand call signs used by their commanders, which Litsey had written on a\nwhiteboard next to the interactive panel. After the Vampire dropped its\npayload, intercepts on the frequencies revealed that the Russians in the\ncellar had survived both the grenades and the mines, and that their unit was\nsending reinforcements.\n\nFor the rest of the day, a steady stream of small groups of Russian\ninfantrymen\u2014between two and six soldiers each\u2014walked to Tabaivka from the\neast. Few made it across the three-hundred-yard gap. The snow had relented,\nand Boyko easily stalked the groups with the surveillance drone. Perun bounded\nbetween the panel and the radio, shouting himself hoarse, calculating\nazimuths, and correcting the aim of his stormers, snipers, and machine\ngunners. It was madness: Russians kept marching down the same paths, to the\nsame spots where their comrades had just died. One 1st Battalion machine\ngunner later told me he had fired his weapon so much that it had kept him warm\nin his frigid dugout. He couldn\u2019t see the men he was killing. But since they\nkept reappearing in certain places, he memorized different branches below\nwhich he could point his barrel to hit specific co\u00f6rdinates up to a mile away.\n\nUnlike the machine gunner, those of us in the operations center had a\nbird\u2019s-eye view of the Russians on the receiving end of the barrages: men\nrunning and stumbling as they fled the bullets and the shells, crawling after\nbeing shot or hit by shrapnel, hiding behind tree trunks and under bushes. At\none point, the monitor displayed six Russians hurrying up a road toward the\nsafety of a dense forest. Two of them were helping along a limping soldier who\nhad his arms draped over their shoulders; two others were dragging an injured\nor dead soldier across the snow on an improvised toboggan. Perun called in\ncluster munitions on them: a smoking warhead that scudded down, followed by a\ndozen impacts all around the group. Another 1st Battalion drone pilot was\nattacking Russians with F.P.V.s. Footage from one of them captured two\ninfantrymen diving away, too late, in the split second before the F.P.V.\ndetonated and its video feed cut out.\n\nAbove the monitor that showed this procession of carnage hung the flag with\nthe angel of death playing his flute. I recalled the \u201cjoy\u201d that Perun had\nmentioned. (During other conversations, he\u2019d referred to the \u201caesthetic\npleasure\u201d of his work.) The Ukrainians in the basement derived obvious\nsatisfaction from the Russian casualties, some of which elicited rapturous\ncheers. \u201cOh, look at them run!\u201d Perun exclaimed, almost giddily, after one\nstrike.\n\nWhen night fell, Boyko switched on a thermal camera, and the black figures\ndying in the white snow became white figures on black. Sever and his team\nrotated out from Tabaivka at 2 a.m., while the Russians were preoccupied with\ntheir hopeless efforts to reach their marooned comrades in the root cellar.\nThe stormers had been walking and digging and fighting for forty-eight hours.\n\nThe next morning, I went by the team\u2019s house at around nine-thirty to find\nSever in the kitchen, watching the drone feed on a TV. No one else was up.\n\u201cThey\u2019re tired as dogs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cold exhausts you more than the lack of\nsleep.\u201d While crossing the swamp during the infiltration, Sever had broken\nthrough the ice; the garbage bags around his feet had not prevented his socks\nfrom getting drenched. He\u2019d smoked all his cigarettes on the first day. By the\ntime they hiked back up the ridge, \u201ceveryone was hallucinating a little,\u201d he\nsaid. Reaching one of the Ukrainian machine gunners, Sever saw two purple\nhalos glowing around the man\u2019s head.\n\nI noticed that he was wearing a pair of rubber slippers with \u201cWOLF\u201d written\nacross each strap. They were his dead subordinate\u2019s slippers. When I asked how\nthe team was feeling about the loss, Sever said, \u201cLike shit, but it\u2019s not the\nfirst time. We know tomorrow it could be us.\u201d He planned to call Wolf\u2019s wife.\nShe would receive an official notification, but, until they recovered the\nbody, Wolf would be classified as missing in action, and Sever wanted her to\nknow the truth.\n\nOne by one, the rest of the team joined us. Banker moved stiffly, from\nlingering muscle cramps, and Sanjek\u2019s hands were swollen. He and Noah began\ngrinding up a slab of beef for meatballs. In the afternoon, Casper made them\nall review the video of the assault on the root cellar. Nobody spoke as they\nwatched Wolf collapse in front of the door. They didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d acted so\nrecklessly. \u201cMaybe he wanted to do something courageous,\u201d Sanjek speculated.\n\nDuring the next five days, the Vampire unleashed a deluge of heavy ordnance on\nthe root cellar, including twenty-pound thermobaric bombs. But the\nsubterranean structure held. According to intercepts, some of the Russians\ninside were badly injured, and they were out of food. Their unit continued to\nsend reinforcements, who continued to be killed. Three more Russians were\ntaken prisoner. Now and then, one of the men in the cellar would make a run\nfor it. Each was mowed down. When a 1st Battalion sniper shot and wounded a\nRussian near the entrance, Litsey\u2014whom Perun had left in charge of the\noperations center while he rested\u2014ordered the sniper not to finish him. He\nwanted the Russians in the cellar to hear the soldier dying slowly and\npleading for help. During a siege, Litsey told me, \u201cit\u2019s important to lower\ntheir morale.\u201d\n\nThe temperature warmed and the snow melted. The world on the monitor was\ntransfigured from a blank expanse to a colorful and variegated landscape\nteeming with detail. The room above the cellar had been razed, and the second\ndoor had been shattered; the Russians below had hung up sheets to prevent the\nUkrainian drones from seeing down the stairs. Wolf\u2019s body lay amid the rubble.\nOne afternoon, Boyko came by Perun\u2019s apartment to collect leaflets that Perun\nwanted him to drop around the entrance. The text on the leaflets guaranteed\nthe safety of the Russians if they surrendered. \u201cWe invite you to exercise\ncommon sense,\u201d it said. \u201cThere is no need for you to die in a foreign country\nfor someone else\u2019s interests.\u201d That night, several of the Russians, in a\ndesperate dash, successfully escaped. Those who remained in the cellar were\npresumed to be too gravely wounded to pose a threat.\n\nI left the village the next day. When I stopped by Sever\u2019s house to say\ngoodbye, most of the men were out getting supplies. They would soon return to\nTabaivka, to help the anchor group better fortify its trenches. Now that the\nblue squares were Ukrainian, 1st Battalion would stay with the T.D.F. members\nas long as possible, to insure that they did not retreat. That often happened,\nSever said. During the firefight in October, Noah and Kamin had told me, the\nanchor-group soldiers had fled before the battle was over. One stormer had\nshot at their feet, to try to make them hold their ground.\n\nI asked Sever whether he thought that the T.D.F. members might lose Tabaivka\nagain, nullifying 1st Battalion\u2019s hard-earned gains. He shrugged resignedly.\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nKyivstar was upstairs, smoking by a window. He\u2019d been to a market in Kupyansk\nthat morning and bought a necklace with a silver cross. \u201cFor protection,\u201d he\nsaid. He was standing over a sleeping bag unrolled on a thin foam mat. It was\nWolf\u2019s, as was a winter coat hanging from a nail. The team had pooled some\nmoney, which it planned to send to his wife and children, but Kyivstar said\nthat he was unsure what they were supposed to do with his belongings. Wolf\u2019s\ndeployment bag was unzipped; inside, there were kneepads, gloves, and, though\nI didn\u2019t see them, somewhere among the gear was a pair of ballistic glasses.\n\nIn many ways, the 1st Separate Assault Battalion is an outlier. It was by far\nthe most professional and effective unit that I have encountered in the\nUkrainian military, and, not coincidentally, it was also the best equipped.\nRepublican obstructionism in the U.S. Congress has left Ukraine critically\nshort on weapons and ammunition, but Perun was generally supplied with the\nmat\u00e9riel that he needed to do his job. Nonetheless, the unit was running low\non an indispensable resource: men. \u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder to find new\nsoldiers, because not a lot of people are willing to do this work,\u201d Perun told\nme.\n\nThe challenge went beyond replacing casualties. After two years of war, all\nthe veterans in the unit were exhausted. Perun, who neither drank nor\nsmoked\u2014and who had often spent his rare downtime in our apartment curling\nheavy dumbbells\u2014was afflicted by a chronic cough that grew distressingly\nvicious as the operation progressed. By the time I left, he\u2019d acquired a\nnebulizer machine with a mask, which he would hold to his mouth between bites\nwhile eating breakfast. Many soldiers had been wounded at least once; the\nintensity of assault missions, however, could be more psychically than\nphysically taxing. \u201cThe worst thing is not the Russians,\u201d the officer who had\nlost eighteen comrades in a single day told me. \u201cIt\u2019s when guys you trust and\nhave fought with start mentally flagging. They fade out like a candle.\u201d\n\nWith no end to the fighting in sight, and an increasingly perilous front line,\nUkrainian soldiers can sometimes feel that the only choice available to them\nis one between death and desertion. A year ago, I embedded with an infantry\nunit in the Donbas which had lost most of its men and been replenished with\nnew draftees. Among the few soldiers who had been in the unit since the start\nof the invasion were two friends, code-named Odesa and Bison. Odesa had gone\nawol after much of his squad was killed in Kherson. He had spent two months at\nhome, and then, nagged by guilt, rejoined the unit. He was killed after my\narticle was published. By the time I met Bison, he had already been wounded\nand hospitalized three times; after Odesa died, he also went awol\u2014and also\nreturned to the front. I\u2019d just arrived in Kyiv from Kupyansk when their\nformer platoon leader texted me to say that now Bison had been killed, too. I\nreplied that it seemed like all the best men were dying. The officer corrected\nme: \u201cEveryone dies here. . . . The best, the worst. We remember the bright,\nstrong personalities. Everyone else just fades into nothingness.\u201d\n\nHe likened President Zelensky to Pinocchio for claiming that only thirty-one\nthousand Ukrainian soldiers had been killed. He also reminded me that the\nfigure did not include those M.I.A., which constituted \u201ca huge part of our\nlosses.\u201d\n\nA few days later was February 24th, the second anniversary of the invasion,\nand relatives of missing soldiers had organized a demonstration in Kyiv. Given\nthe threats posed by Russian cruise missiles and long-range kamikaze drones,\npublic gatherings are avoided in the capital, but when I got there hundreds of\npeople, mostly women, lined an avenue in front of St. Sophia\u2019s Cathedral. One\ngroup held a banner that read \u201cfree 4th tank brigade.\u201d A twenty-nine-year-old\nwoman named Maryna Litovka had taken the train from Poltava, in central\nUkraine, to be there. More than a year earlier, her father had disappeared\nfrom his position north of Bakhmut, along with five other soldiers. \u201cThe Army\ndoesn\u2019t know what happened to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is told to a lot of\nfamilies.\u201d According to Litovka, a hundred and seventy men were missing from\nthe 4th Tank Brigade alone. The Red Cross had been able to confirm only that\ntwenty-three of them were in Russian captivity. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s harder,\nknowing that he died or waiting with some hope forever,\u201d Litovka said.\n\nNearby, I met another daughter of a soldier, standing by herself with a\ncardboard sign on which she\u2019d painted \u201cfight for them as they fight for us.\u201d\nHer father was in the Donbas, and she\u2019d come to the demonstration because \u201ca\nlot of people forget about the war, and we must remind them.\u201d\n\nThe cleavage between the reality on the front and the daily lives of people in\nKyiv or other cities in central and western Ukraine has grown more pronounced\nthe longer the war has gone on. While conscription agents snatch men from\nfactories, buses, and the streets of rural villages and towns, the draft is\nmuch less aggressively enforced in the capital, where the Ukrainian \u00e9lite\nlive. Bars there overflow with hipsters; caf\u00e9s are crowded with young couples;\nconcerts, art exhibits, and other cultural events lend the city a sense of\ncomfortable, cosmopolitan normalcy. It is tempting to celebrate all this as a\ntriumph of resilience, but for soldiers on the front it can be galling and\nalienating. \u201cYou feel a little sick to your stomach,\u201d Sever told me. An influx\nof foreigners in Kyiv\u2014from aid workers to entrepreneurs\u2014accentuates the\ndisconnect. In the popular neighborhood where I\u2019d rented an Airbnb, luxury\nsedans and armored S.U.V.s were often parked outside chic hotels, and high-end\nrestaurants catered to Western visitors.\n\nSever saw a parallel between contemporary Ukrainian society and the bitter\nestrangement that he and many of his comrades had experienced between 2014 and\n2022, when most of the country went about its business with little concern for\nthe simmering conflict in the Donbas. \u201cThey\u2019re building a wall between the two\nworlds again,\u201d he said.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the discourse about the conflict changes depending on your\nproximity to the front. In Kyiv, it is still largely taboo to discuss\nnegotiating with Russia, ceding parts of the Donbas, or letting go of Crimea.\nBut, as with every war, the men actually fighting are more earthbound and\ncandid. Odesa and Bison\u2019s former platoon leader told me, \u201cWe\u2019re losing. Not\nbadly, but steadily.\u201d In his view, if the West maintains its current level of\nassistance, Ukraine can hold out for a few more years; if the assistance\ndiminishes, \u201cwe\u2019re screwed in a matter of one year\u201d; if aid increases, \u201cthere\nwill be a stalemate until we run out of soldiers.\u201d\n\nPerun argued that, from a purely strategic standpoint, \u201cyou need to know when\nto stop and how to lose.\u201d Citing the Russian withdrawals from Kyiv and\nKherson, he noted, \u201cThe Russians are better at this than we are.\u201d Unlike\nRussia, he went on, Ukraine is a democracy and therefore \u201cnegotiations can\nstart only when society demands them,\u201d but the government\u2014and, specifically,\nPresident Zelensky\u2014had given Ukrainians unreasonable expectations and a\ndistorted picture of the military situation. \u201cSociety does not know our\nproblems,\u201d Perun said.\n\nEven as these two worlds move further apart, the American debate over Ukraine\ntends to homogenize Ukrainians. Many Republicans have adopted Donald Trump\u2019s\nhostility toward the country, regurgitating Russian propaganda that vilifies\nand dehumanizes Ukrainian citizens. Liberals who consider themselves \u201cpro-\nUkrainian,\u201d meanwhile, tend to equate that stance with unconditionally\npromoting Zelensky\u2019s hard-line ambitions. The latter is perhaps inevitable,\nbecause most of the Ukrainians that Americans see and hear\u2014on social media, on\nTV, at forums and conferences\u2014also espouse those ambitions. In January,\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, appeared on ABC News and declared,\nin impeccable English, \u201cEven if we run out of weapons, we will fight with\nshovels.\u201d Of course, the collective pronoun was figurative: he will not have\nto fight with a shovel\u2014nor with a rifle, for that matter. For the Ukrainians\nwho are fighting (overwhelmingly, lower-class manual laborers), the war is not\nonly terrifying and brutal, it is lonely. Many have lost confidence in their\npoliticians, in their commanders, in their fellow-citizens, and now in their\nAmerican allies.\n\nAnd yet there remain units like the 1st Separate Assault Battalion. When I\nasked Sever how he felt about his countrymen who have avoided military\nservice, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care about them. I\u2019m fighting for my own principles\nand my own guys. People are coming here, killing children, raping women\u2014for\nme, I can\u2019t imagine not resisting.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the Tabaivka mission, the stormers retrieved Wolf\u2019s remains.\nAccording to Noah, who helped carry the body up the ridge, the root cellar had\nfully collapsed and was surrounded by dead Russians. Two days later, Noah was\nhit by artillery and hospitalized with shrapnel wounds. Kyivstar and Banker\nwere also injured by shrapnel before they left the village; they are now\nrecovering. The rest of 1st Battalion is waiting for the next fire that they\nwill be sent to put out.\n\nTo date, half the blue squares in Tabaivka have been lost again.\n\nWolf\u2019s death means that Sever and Casper will have to recruit another\nreplacement\u2014a task that neither man relishes. \u201cIt makes you want to cry,\u201d\nSever told me. The night before the apprehensive anchor-group members set off\nfor Tabaivka, Casper had noted that two stormers in their fifties had\nparticipated in a number of dangerous 1st Battalion missions. \u201cIf they can do\nthis, anyone can,\u201d he\u2019d insisted. I later told Casper that I couldn\u2019t agree\nwith him: most people could not do what he and Sever did. Casper reflected,\nthen responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated question\u2014can you or can\u2019t you? Because if\nyou answer honestly, no one can. But, if no one can, the Russians will come\nand put their dicks on our foreheads.\u201d\n\nThe stormers in their fifties were no longer with the battalion. One had been\nwounded and the other had been killed. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the April 15, 2024, issue, with the headline\n\u201cThe Assault.\u201d\n\n## More on the War in Ukraine\n\n  * How Ukrainians saved their capital.\n\n  * A historian envisions a settlement among Russia, Ukraine, and the West.\n\n  * How Russia\u2019s latest commander in Ukraine could change the war.\n\n  * The profound defiance of daily life in Kyiv.\n\n  * The Ukraine crackup in the G.O.P.\n\n  * A filmmaker\u2019s journey to the heart of the war.\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nLuke Mogelson, a staff writer, won a National Magazine Award and the inaugural\nSydney H.
