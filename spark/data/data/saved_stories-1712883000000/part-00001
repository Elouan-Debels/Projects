They are micron-scale tetrahedrons with\nthe tips lopped off.\u201dIn the paper, Gu and her co-authors describe how they\nnanoprinted tens of thousands of these challenging nanoparticles, stirred them\ninto a solution, and then watched as they self-assembled into various\npromising crystal structures. More critically, these materials can shift\nbetween states in minutes simply by rearranging the particles into new\ngeometric patterns.This ability to change \u201cphases,\u201d as materials engineers\nrefer to the shapeshifting quality, is similar to the atomic rearrangement\nthat turns iron into tempered steel, or in materials that allow computers to\nstore terabytes of valuable data in digital form.\u201cIf we can learn to control\nthese phase shifts in materials made of these Archimedean truncated\ntetrahedrons it could lead in many promising engineering directions,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\n## Elusive prey\n\nArchimedean truncated tetrahedrons (ATTs) have long been theorized to be among\nthe most desirable of geometries for producing materials that can easily\nchange phase, but until recently were challenging to fabricate \u2013 predicted in\ncomputer simulations yet difficult to reproduce in the real world.Gu is quick\nto point out that her team is not the first to produce nanoscale Archimedean\ntruncated tetrahedrons in quantity, but they are among the first, if not the\nfirst, to use 3D nanoprinting to do it.\u201cWith 3D nanoprinting, we can make\nalmost any shape we want. We can control the particle shape very carefully,\u201d\nGu explained. \u201cThis particular shape has been predicted by simulations to form\nvery interesting structures. When you can pack them together in various ways\nthey produce valuable physical properties.\u201dATTs form at least two highly\ndesirable geometric structures. The first is a hexagonal pattern in which the\ntetrahedrons rest flat on the substrate with their truncated tips pointing\nupward like a nanoscale mountain range. The second is perhaps even more\npromising, Gu said. It is a crystalline quasi-diamond structure in which the\ntetrahedrons alternate in upward- and downward-facing orientations, like eggs\nresting in an egg carton. The diamond arrangement is considered a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d\nin the photonics community and could lead in many new and interesting\nscientific directions.Most importantly, however, when properly engineered,\nfuture materials made of 3D printed particles can be rearranged rapidly,\nswitching easily back and forth between phases with the application of a\nmagnetic field, electric current, heat, or other engineering method.Gu said\nshe can imagine coatings for solar panels that change throughout the day to\nmaximize energy efficiency, new-age hydrophobic films for airplane wings and\nwindows that mean they never fog or ice up, or new types of computer memory.\nThe list goes on and on.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re working on making these particles\nmagnetic to control how they behave,\u201d Gu said of her latest research already\nunderway using Archimedean truncated tetrahedron nanoparticles in new ways.\n\u201cThe possibilities are only beginning to be explored.\u201dAdditional co-authors of\nthe work are PhD students David Doan and John Kulikowski.
