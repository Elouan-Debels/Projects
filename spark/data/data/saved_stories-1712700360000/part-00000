The effect size is absolutely mind-boggling, and a damning brand\nof indictment against the entire modern education system.\n\nThe problem is that this stuff clearly doesn\u2019t scale, for two reasons; first\nof all there isn\u2019t enough experts to go around, as it would require a large\nchunk of the adult population to be experts dedicated to tutoring, and second\nof all, even if this was the case, having a dozen or more teachers per student\nwould trivially be something like 300x more expensive than having 20-30\nstudents per teacher.\n\nAs realizing this would be a boon for humanity on par with antibiotics, it is\ntantalizing to ask if GPTs could fill the role of a tutor in some capacity.\nUnlikely in their current iteration, as their training data is too noisy and\nthey are entirely too passive; but sometime in the future, with modifications\nmade, it doesn\u2019t seem obviously impossible.\n\nmarginalia.nu \u00a9 2024 Viktor Lofgren <kontakt@marginalia.nu>\n\nConsider donating to support the development effort of Marginalia Search and\nthe other services!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
