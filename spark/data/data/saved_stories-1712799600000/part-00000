The MPA will \"work with\nmembers of Congress\" to require Internet service providers to block piracy\nwebsites, he said during a \"state of the industry\" address at CinemaCon 2024\nin Las Vegas, a convention for movie theater owners.\n\n\"This danger [of piracy] continues to evolve, and so must our strategy to\ndefeat it,\" Rivkin said. \"So today, here with you at CinemaCon, I'm announcing\nthe next major phase of this effort: the MPA is going to work with members of\nCongress to enact judicial site-blocking legislation here in the United\nStates.\"\n\nA site-blocking law would let copyright owners \"request, in court, that\nInternet service providers block access to websites dedicated to sharing\nillegal, stolen content,\" he said. Rivkin claimed that in the US, piracy\n\"steals hundreds of thousands of jobs from workers and tens of billions of\ndollars from our economy, including more than one billion in theatrical ticket\nsales.\"\n\nHe also told the audience that pirate-site operators \"aren't teenagers playing\nan elaborate prank. The perpetrators are real-life mobsters, organized crime\nsyndicates\u2014many of whom engage in child pornography, prostitution, drug\ntrafficking, and other societal ills. They operate websites that draw in\nmillions of unsuspecting viewers whose personal data can then fall prey to\nmalware and hackers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRivkin said the industry is already \"collaborating with local law enforcement\nauthorities and global cybersecurity experts to identify and investigate\nillegal piracy operations,\" but that this alone isn't enough\u2014a site-blocking\nlaw is also needed, in the MPA's view.\n\n## Lawful content would be blocked, group warns\n\nConsumer advocacy group Public Knowledge urged Congress to reject the MPA\npush, saying that a site-blocking law would threaten the open Internet. \"With\ntoday's announcement, the MPA has made its intentions crystal clear: It wants\nto give itself and its members the power to force any Internet infrastructure\nprovider, up to and including the broadband providers that service your home,\nto cut off access to websites on their say-so alone,\" said Meredith Rose, the\ngroup's senior policy counsel.\n\nThe MPA's latest push for a site-blocking law comes about two weeks before a\nFederal Communications Commission vote to restore net neutrality rules that\nprohibit ISPs from blocking and throttling websites. The proposed net\nneutrality rules apply only to lawful content, but opponents of site-blocking\nlegislation fear a blocking law would undermine the goals of net neutrality by\ncompelling ISPs to block both lawful and unlawful content.\n\nRose said the MPA's requested law would be similar to the proposed Stop Online\nPiracy Act (SOPA) that was shelved after major protests over a decade ago.\n\n\"Nothing has changed since then\u2014not the infrastructure of the Internet that\nmade this unworkable, not the lack of consultation with technologists, and not\nthe back-room dealmaking\u2014except for the brazenness of the industries seeking\nit. And contrary to MPA's stance, site-blocking does not 'work'\u2014it results in\nsignificant over-blocking of lawful content,\" Rose said.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n110\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
