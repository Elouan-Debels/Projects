Mimicking\nhuman-made videos such as a podcast or YouTube video, and eventually movies\nand TV shows. Which is what this project serves to be.\n\nBelow is a simple showcase of a couple of different videos generated by a\npreliminary text-to-movie system, satisfying the following constraints:\n\n  * Uncapped video duration\n  * Human & nonhuman characters\n  * Visual animations\n  * Visual character consistency (a single image reference)\n  * Music & SFX\n  * Character auditory consistency (many samples of speech references)\n\nIf you are interesting in working with us, you can reach us at guy@nuraml.com\n\n# Showcase\n\n## Educational video\n\n### Input\n\n#### Prompt\n\n10 interesting facts about the ocean\n\n#### Actor(s)\n\n  * Lex Fridman\n\n### Output\n\n## Podcast\n\n### Input\n\n#### Prompt\n\nBrief Lex Fridman podcast with old present-day Steve Jobs about AI.\n\n#### Actor(s)\n\n  * Lex Fridman\n  * Steve Jobs\n\n### Output\n\n## Commercial\n\n### Input\n\n#### Prompt\n\nFunny commercial selling helpful but deadly robots\n\n#### Actor(s)\n\n  * Tom Cruise\n\n### Output\n\n", "frontpage": false}
