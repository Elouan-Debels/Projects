Cultures from each age\ngroup were then either mock infected or infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe researchers found that, after three days, the NECs of children responded\nquickly to SARS-CoV-2 by increasing interferon (the body\u2019s first line of anti-\nviral defence) - restricting viral replication. However, this early anti-viral\neffect became less pronounced with age.\n\nThe researchers also found that NECs from elderly individuals not only\nproduced more infectious virus particles, but also experienced increased cell\nshedding and damage.\n\nThe strong antiviral response in the NECs of children could explain why\nyounger people typically experience milder symptoms. In contrast, the\nincreased damage and higher viral replication found in NECs from elderly\nindividuals could be linked to the greater severity of disease observed in\nolder adults.\n\nProject lead, Dr Claire Smith (Associate Professor at UCL Great Ormond Street\nInstitute of Child Health), said: \u201cOur research reveals how the type of cells\nwe have in our nose changes with age, and how this affects our ability to\ncombat SARS-CoV-2 infection. This could be crucial in developing effective\nanti-viral treatments tailored to different age groups, especially for the\nelderly who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19.\u201d\n\nCo-Senior author, Dr Kerstin Meyer (Wellcome Sanger Institute), said: \u201cBy\ncarrying out SARS-CoV-2 infections of epithelial cells in vitro and studying\nthe responses with single cell sequencing, we get a much more detailed\nunderstanding of the viral infection kinetics and see big differences in the\ninnate immune response between cell types.\u201d\n\nChildren infected with SARS-CoV-2 rarely progress to respiratory failure, but\nthe risk of mortality in infected people over the age of 85 remains high,\ndespite vaccination and improving treatment options.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of considering age as a critical\nfactor in both research and treatment of infectious diseases.\n\nCo-senior author, Dr Marko Nikolic (UCL Division of Medicine), said: \u201cIt is\nfascinating that when we take away immune cells from nasal samples, and are\nonly left with nasal epithelial cells grown in a dish, we are still able to\nidentify age-specific differences in our body\u2019s response to the SARS-CoV-2\nbetween the young and elderly to explain why children are generally protected\nfrom severe COVID-19.\u201d\n\nDr Smith added: \u201cUnderstanding the cellular differences at the initiation of\ninfection is just the beginning. We now hope to investigate the long-term\nimplications of these cellular changes and test therapeutic interventions\nusing our unique cell culture model. This \u2018gold-standard\u2019 system is only\npossible with the support of our funders and the willingness of participants\nto provide their samples.\u201d\n\nThe team suggest that future research should consider how ageing impacts the\nbody\u2019s response to other viral infections.\n\nThis study was funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), and the National\nInstitute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Great Ormond Street Hospital\nBiomedical Research Centre, Wellcome and the Chan Zuckerberg Foundation.\n\n## Links\n\n  * Research in Nature Microbiology\n  * Dr Claire Smith's academic profile\n  * Dr Marko Nikolic's academic profile\n  * UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health\n  * UCL Population Health Sciences\n  * UCL Divison of Medicine\n  * UCL Medical Sciences\n\n## Images\n\n  * Legend of Fig2g: This 3D microscopy image shows nasal cells from older adults infected the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
