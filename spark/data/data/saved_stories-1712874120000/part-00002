The nuclear-powered\nsubmarine INS Arihant was flooded with saltwater, necessitating nearly a\nyear\u2019s worth of repairs. The submarine is designed to function as a floating\narsenal of nuclear weapons, guaranteeing a retaliatory strike in case of\nsurprise attack.\n\nThe incident was first reported by The Hindu. According to an Indian Navy\nsource, a hatch was left open on the rear left side of the ship, allowing\nseawater to rush into the propulsion area while the Arihant was in harbor.\nArihant was out of action for ten months as water was pumped out and pipes\nwere cut out and replaced. Indian authorities likely felt that pipes exposed\nto corrosive seawater couldn't be trusted again, particularly pipes that carry\npressurized water coolant to and from the ship\u2019s 83 megawatt nuclear reactor.\nFailing pipes could not only endanger the ship\u2019s crew but the entire\nsubmarine... and her nuclear weapons.\n\nIndia\u2019s first ballistic missile submarine is the result of a $2.9 billion\nsubmarine technology program. Construction on Arihant began in 2009, and the\nship was commissioned into the Indian Navy seven years later in October 2016.\nThe modified Russian Akula-1 class nuclear attack submarine was lengthened to\naccommodate twelve K-15 short-range nuclear missiles or four K-4 intermediate\nrange nuclear missiles. K-15 missiles, with their 434-mile range, primarily\ntarget Pakistan, while K-4 missiles, with their 2,174-mile range can reach all\nof Pakistan and as far as the capital of India\u2019s other neighborhood rival,\nBeijing. A second missile submarine, INS Arighant, was launched in December,\nand at least three submarines are planned.\n\nIndia has a \u201cNo First Use\u201d policy with regard to nuclear weapons, promising\nthat it would only use nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack. The\nnation is only the sixth country in the world to put ballistic nuclear weapons\nat sea, a strategy designed to render at least part of the country\u2019s nuclear\narsenal invulnerable to surprise attack. The strategy, known as Continuous At\nSea Deterrence, is employed by several countries including the United States\nand requires at least one nuclear-missile armed submarine at sea at all times.\n\nHow in the world could a $2.9 billion submarine be sidelined by a simple\nmistake? Not leaving hatches open that could potentially sink a ship,\nparticularly a submarine, is basic common sense. Why were the propulsion\nsection and nuclear reactor on the 364-foot long submarine unattended so the\nflooding went unnoticed as long as it did? As the star of the Indian Navy,\nArihant should have attracted the best submariners India had to offer, which\nmakes this accident all the more baffling.\n\nKyle Mizokami\n\nKyle Mizokami is a writer on defense and security issues and has been at\nPopular Mechanics since 2015.
