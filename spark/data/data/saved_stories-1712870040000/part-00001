With a free option, money is no longer a barrier (though time is).\n  * Software has zero marginal cost; once you put the effort in to build the first copy, you can create 1M copies for essentially the same cost.\n\nHowever, supporting a free software product sure isn\u2019t free. This post covers\nwhat you need to think about in terms of investing in a free product.\n\nIf FusionAuth were a public company, this is where there\u2019d be lawyerese\ntalking about forward looking statements and safe harbors and whatnot. Suffice\nit to say that this entire post is my personal opinion.\n\nSide note: a free product is often but not always open source. Free can mean a\ntier of a SaaS, an open source project, or a downloadable product. Open source\nhas additional complexities, so I\u2019m going to focus on products that are \u201cfree\nas in beer\u201d in this post. FusionAuth has a downloadable product that devs can\nrun for free, within constraints.\n\nWe have internal discussions about tweaking the free version of the product.\nOptions include:\n\n  * Keeping the product as-is, but making investments in the community version. This includes bug fixes and feature improvements. Since our free product is production ready and feature rich, this is a solid choice.\n  * Improving the free product. There are multiple dimensions to doing so, including:\n\n    * Improving discoverability of the free option, such as highlighting it more on the website, advertising it, or investing in additional documentation around its features and usage.\n    * Changing the license to make it usable across a greater number of use cases or with different limits.\n    * Move features currently restricted to paid plans to the free product.\n  * Degrading or limiting the free product. These are basically the flip side of improving it:\n\n    * Increasing friction to find or use it.\n    * Modifying the license to prohibit currently allowed use cases.\n    * Clawing back features from the free plan, focusing on features useful to businesses who are likely to pay. For example, the free plan currently allows unlimited SAML connections, which many competitors throttle.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, we are following the first path, improving the\nfree product. The free product is usable and robust, and we get substantial\nbenefits from the community\u2019s usage.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into these benefits.\n\n### The value of the free users\n\nFirst, if developers are using our free software to solve their authentication\nneeds, they aren\u2019t using someone else\u2019s. While you can\u2019t pay a mortgage with\ndeveloper attention, that doesn\u2019t mean it has no value. Such attention expands\nour mindshare and market share. More mindshare means that people are learning\nabout our solution. Gaining market share means they aren\u2019t using someone\nelse\u2019s solution. Therefore they are neither paying a competitor money nor\ngetting more familiar with their solution.\n\nSecond, such users spread the word about our solution. Sometimes they talk\nabout it on social channels and sometimes on a review site. But often it is\nprompted by us; here is an example of one of my favorite set of blog posts,\nentirely drawn from community experiences. Talking to community members has\nopened up my eyes to the wide variety of ways our product is used. Community\nstories are not, however, useful as case studies for the sales process. They\naren\u2019t detailed enough. But they are still helpful to spread the word about\nthe product, highlight our community members and catch long tail keywords.\n\nThird, free users improve FusionAuth. They do this by:\n\n  * Finding flaws in FusionAuth, such as bugs or regressions. Here\u2019s an example issue, including workarounds.\n  * Requesting new features. We leverage the community further by asking users to upvote such requests so we know what the community wants from the product.\n  * Exercising the software by performing integrations that we would never have done. This is a variant on finding bugs. For example, a free user reported we aren\u2019t to spec with regards to the SAML relay state; that\u2019s never been an issue for the existing SAML integrations.\n\nFinally, free users also offer each other support. While not all community\nmembers are active all the time (our community is more of a Google than a\nFacebook), a few have a presence on our forum, slack and GitHub issues.\n\n### The conversion of free users to paid users\n\nFree users may purchase the software in the future. Once someone needs paid\nfeatures, they may stop using the free plan and buy. We\u2019ve built up trust as a\nsolid solution in their mind and they have already integrated us. So a free\nuser will consider paying you when they are looking to purchase.\n\nOf course, you need a product worth paying for above and beyond your free\noffering. At FusionAuth, we accomplish this in three dimensions:\n\n  * Operating the product. Many of our customers are fine with the features of the free plan but don\u2019t mind paying us to run it. This can include service level agreements (SLAs) as well, which are like catnip for enterprises.\n  * Paid features. These are either features good when you are at a certain size (like SCIM) or enhancements of features available in the free tier, such as a more customizable registration form or MFA policy. Choosing the features to charge for is critical, but is really hard to get good data for since it is very business specific.\n  * Support. Knowing you can ask questions of the engineers behind the product is valuable, especially for larger businesses.\n\nThere are two ways for free users to convert.\n\nThey can do it directly, where they use the free version to evaluate or run a\n\u201cproof of concept\u201d to ensure that our product meets their needs before they\never engage with us. We have plenty of customers who say \u201cwe\u2019re already a few\nmonths into integrating with you\u201d on our purchase kickoff call, and that\nability to \u201cget going\u201d with the product without talking to a sales rep or\npulling out a credit card makes the decision easier. Again, they trust the\nsolution will solve their problem. They can also see how the company treats\nthe free users and the community in general too.\n\nThere are also people who \u201ckick the tires\u201d with the free product and discover\nthat it doesn\u2019t meet their needs. We don\u2019t hear about as many of those, but I\nhave talked to a few. In this case, both parties win; getting to a quick no is\nnot as good as a \u201cyes\u201d but is still pretty good. There are also people who do\na self-led POC and incorrectly determine it isn\u2019t a fit. They might miss\nfeatures through lack of docs or a conceptual mismatch. We keep trying to\nimprove our docs, education and product, but you can\u2019t win them all!\n\nThere\u2019s also an indirect conversion path, alluded to in the above mindshare\npoint. Free users may use our software on a side project or to learn about\nauthentication and OAuth in general. This lets them add FusionAuth to their\ntoolkit. Then, later, perhaps years later, they can bring us into a project as\nan option to evaluate or to recommend us for purchase.\n\nIn general, free products let you build trust and de-risk purchases.\n\n### Keeping up with the Joneses, err the competition\n\nFinally, competition matters. Lots of our competitors have a free offering.\nAgain, this is due to the nature of software. Yay to zero marginal cost!\n\nThis is also compounded by the nature of developer tools. Devs are looking for\ntools to solve a problem, but once they\u2019ve integrated one, it sticks around.\nOne time I picked a bug tracking system in a few days (phpbt, what what!) and\nit was used at our company for years. This means if you have a friction free\nevaluation process, you stand a good chance of being embedded.\n\nOffering a free product matters for our market positioning.\n\nNothing sells quite like free.\n\n### In conclusion\n\nWhen you make a free product available, you are offering users something of\nvalue. Resources are scarce, and supporting the free product isn\u2019t free.\n\nDetermining how much time and effort to expend supporting it depends on the\nvalue your company gains. You won\u2019t always be able to calculate it in dollars\nand cents, but it exists nonetheless.\n\nBusiness Devrel FusionAuth | moore | October 7, 2023\n\n* Advice for startup founders\n* 20
