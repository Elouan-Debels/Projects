The Electric Egg) was a futuristic prototype concept\nelectric cyclecar designed in 1938, and built in 1942 by industrial designer\nPaul Arzens (1903-1990). It was acquired by the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in\nParis in 1993, and is currently at the Cit\u00e9 de l'Automobile in Mulhouse in\nAlsace.^[1]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nArzens, a Parisian, and graduate of \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts\nde Paris, designed this futuristic, economical, lightweight electric car\nprototype in 1938 (along with his concept car La Baleine), then built it in\n1942, during World War II.^[2]\n\n### Car[edit]\n\nThe spherical bodywork, with a fastback rear, is inspired by interwar\ncyclecars, and the bionic shapes of an egg, a bubble, or a drop of water. The\nbody is aluminum, over a chassis formed from a Duralinox [ca] tube. The\nwindscreen is made of curved Plexiglass, as are the doors. Batteries account\nfor most of the car's 350-kilogram (770 lb) weight.^[3]\n\n  * Near La Baleine\n\n  * Face view\n\n  * Side view\n\n### Motorisation[edit]\n\nTo circumvent fuel rationing during the German military administration in\noccupied France during World War II, Arzens used an electric motor, which was\npowered by five 12-volt batteries located under the bench seat. Each battery\nhad a capacity of 250 ampere hours, and weighed 60 kilograms (130 lb). The car\nhad a top speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph), and a range of 100\nkilometres (62 mi).^[3]\n\nAfter the war, Arzens replaced the electric motor with a 125 cc (7.6 cu in)\nPeugeot single-cylinder petrol engine, which produced 5.5 horsepower (4.1 kW).\nThis resulted in an increase in the car's top speed, to 80 kilometres per hour\n(50 mph).^[4]\n\nLe Carrosse, variant of 1951, in the mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris\n\n## Museum[edit]\n\nArzens used L'\u0152uf \u00e9lectrique as his personal car until his death in 1990, at\nwhich point it was donated to the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris, which\nhouses the collection of the Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers. As of\n2022, the car is at the Cit\u00e9 de l'Automobile in Mulhouse, together with La\nBaleine.^[1]^[3]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b \"L'\u0153uf \u00e9lectrique de Paul Arzens\". www.arts-et-metiers.net (in French).
