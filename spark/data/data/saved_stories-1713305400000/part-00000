His\nfamily's net worth is less than $2,000. And his parents are neither supportive\nnor involved in his life.\n\nWhen researchers assessed his home and family life, they determined he was in\na fairly risky environment.\n\nOver the next 25 years, researchers will continue interviewing Alex regularly.\nHe'll be bullied at school. He'll be held back a few grades. He won't go to\ncollege.\n\nAs an adult, he'll often live in poverty while struggling with his physical\nand mental health.\n\nBut, right now, Alex is a teenager. And there's only so much control he has\nover his life.\n\nHe thinks his teachers are pretty good. He'll soon go on his first date with a\ngirl. And he's pretty optimistic about the future. In other words, he's like\nmost other teenagers.\n\nLet's meet everyone else.\n\nIn this story, we'll follow hundreds of teenagers for the next 24 years, when\nthey\u2019ll be in their late-30s.\n\nThey're among the thousands of kids who are part of the National Longitudinal\nSurvey of Youth. This means researchers have followed them since their teenage\nyears to the present day \u2013 and beyond.\n\n(Click a kid to see details)\n\nA notable portion of kids, including Alex, have parents who are uninvolved and\n\"show less warmth.\"\n\nA lot of kids are in high-risk environments.\n\nResearchers determined risk by asking lots of questions. For example, they\nasked whether the kid has basic necessities, like electricity or a quiet place\nto study.\n\nThey also asked about factors that could destabilize the home environment \u2013\nchaotic routines, parents who have disabilities, or relatives struggling with\nsubstance abuse.\n\nAnd a lot of kids are growing up extremely poor \u2013 which, in and of itself, can\nbe traumatic.\n\nA year from now, in 1998, a researcher named Vincent Felitti will publish a\npaper that drastically changes the way we think about these kids \u2013 and their\nchildhood.\n\nThe research will show that these childhood stressors and traumas \u2013 called\nAdverse Childhood Experiences \u2013 have a lifelong effect on our health,\nrelationships, happiness, financial security, and pretty much everything else\nthat we value. It will kickstart decades of research that shows that our\nchildhood experiences shape our adulthood far more than we ever thought.\n\nWhile we can't track everything about these kids' lives, we can track how many\nof the following adverse experiences each kid experiences:\n\n  * Having uninvolved parents\n  * Held back in school\n  * School suspensions\n  * Being bullied\n  * Seeing someone shot with a gun\n\nIn addition, I'll add in the home/family environment risk score to calculate\nthe total adverse experience number.\n\nTo make this easier to see, let's split the kids up into three groups \u2013 kids\nwho experience...\n\nNo adverse experiences (0) Some adverse experiences (1-4) Many adverse\nexperiences (5+)\n\nLet's go forward in time. I'll check in at the end of high school.\n\nKeep scrolling \u2193\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\nIt's 2001 \u2013 senior year of high school for a lot of these kids.\n\nLet's check in on the types of adverse experiences they've endured.\n\nHere are the kids who grew up in a high-risk home and family environment,\nbased on their latest interviews.\n\nSome kids were held back in school. A few were held back multiple years.\n\nSome kids were suspended from school, a few were suspended multiple times.\n\nMany kids were bullied.\n\nAnd these are the kids who witnessed gun violence.\n\nGrowing up around violence can lower a kid's attention, impulse control, and\nearly academic skills.\n\nWhen we look at their high school GPA, we see that kids who experienced\nadverse events are more likely to struggle in school.\n\nWooo! High school is over! Partayyyyy!!!\n\n## Let's look at who is going to college\n\nIt's now 2002.\n\nMost kids are done with high school and figuring out what's next.\n\nKids who experienced adverse events were less likely to go directly to\ncollege. They were more likely to jump straight into the workforce or get\nstuck in the purgatory between high school and some version of adulthood.\n\nCollege isn't just a place that teaches you how to do a job; it's also a safe,\nstructured, and productive environment for people to continue growing up \u2013 and\nto fend off adulthood for a bit. In the last few decades, more people have\ntaken this path:\n\n### Percentage of people 25 to 29 years old with a bachelor's degree\n\nSource: National Center for Education Statistics\n\nSure, these kids are now 18 \u2013 technically adults. But psychologist Jeffrey\nArnett argues that, in developed countries, there is an era between ages 18\nand 25 when we collectively agree to let people explore the world and figure\nout what role they want to have in it. He calls it \"emerging adulthood\". And\ncollege is an environment built for emerging adults \u2013 a place where kids can\nleave their family environment and finally have a chance to independently\nshape their futures.\n\nIt's 2003.\n\nMore kids will eventually go to college \u2013 but it'll be uncommon for kids who\nexperienced many adverse events.\n\nIt's a cruel irony. Research has shown that even one year of college or\ntechnical school can mitigate some of the effects of adverse childhood\nexperiences.\n\n2004\n\nLet's check in on Alex.\n\nHe's 20 now. The last few years were tough. He was held back in high school,\ngraduated with a 2.9 GPA, and didn't go to college.\n\nBut he moved out of his parents' house and he briefly had a job as a grounds\nmaintenance worker. He's not employed now.\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\nIt's now 2010. About half of each group is now working.\n\nBut the type of jobs they work largely depends on their education.\n\n## Let's look at educational attainment\n\nSome of them have college degrees and are working jobs that pay them\naccordingly.\n\nNot surprisingly, the people with bachelor's degrees tend to be people who\nexperienced fewer adverse events as kids.\n\nBachelor's degrees have become essential for well-paid jobs in the US.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, people with four-year college degrees started earning\nmore and more, while everyone else earned less.\n\n### Median income for people ages 25 to 34, by educational attainment\n\nSource: National Center for Education Statistics, College Board, US Census\n\nMeanwhile, for the last several decades, people with four-year college degrees\nhave reported being happier than people without.\n\n### Happiness, by educational attainment\n\nSource: General Social Survey\n\nBut in 2022, the average cost for first-time college students living in campus\nwas $36,000 \u2013 nearly $10,000 higher than a decade prior. It's made college\ninaccessible for kids who need it most.\n\n2011\n\n## Let's look at annual income\n\nIt's 2013.\n\nBy their late-20s, we can already see the income gaps among these groups.\nNotice who is earning less than $15,000 each year and less than $30,000 each\nyear.\n\nThe US poverty line is about $15,000 for an individual in 2024 \u2013 low enough\nthat the government offers healthcare benefits for people who earn up to 4x\nthe poverty line.\n\nIt's 2015.\n\nIn one year, the US will elect Donald Trump as president \u2013 a man who\nconstantly insults poor people and calls them \"morons.\"\n\nThis generation grew up hearing presidents say similar things. Ronald Reagan\nsaid people go hungry because of \"a lack of knowledge,\" and that people are\nhomeless \"by choice.\" Bill Clinton said \"personal responsibility\" is the way\nto overcome poverty. We grew up in a country where most people believed the\ntop reason for poverty was drug abuse, and half of Americans blamed poor\npeople for being poor.\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\nIt's 2021.\n\nThe research participants are in their late-30s now, which means they've had\nplenty of time to shape their own destinies. But we can clearly see that the\nexperiences of their childhood had a huge effect on their financial situation\nas adults.\n\nIt also has an effect on virtually everything else in their lives.\n\nThis is how many times each person was a victim of a violent crime.\n\nThis is how many parents, siblings, or partners have died thus far\n\nRemember, these people are only in their late-30s.\n\nThis is the most recent answer each person gave about how often they were\nhappy in the past month.\n\nAll of this affects Black and Hispanic people significantly more \u2013 something\nFelitti found in his initial study.\n\nUltimately, our childhood experiences affect our lifespan.\n\nPeople who endure adverse experiences report more health problems. Research\nhas found that adverse childhood experiences increase the likelihood of being\ndiagnosed with cancer, heart disease, mental illness \u2013 and all of this can\nlead to premature death.\n\nThe survey only asks each person about their health every few years, so this\nvisualization shows their most recent response.\n\nSo, how is Alex doing?\n\nHe's 37 now, living with his partner and two kids.\n\nAfter decades of working as a cook, he recently moved to a retail job. Over\nthe last few years, his annual income was around $20,000. He has struggled\nwith his weight for much of his adult life, and it affects his overall health.\nThe last time he was asked about his mental health, he said he was depressed\nsome of the time.\n\nThe world has a lot of compassion for kids.\n\nWhen we're young, we have so little control over their lives. We play around,\nmess up, and get into trouble. We also endure dysfunctional homes, family\nchaos, violence, bullies, and whatever else comes our way. But we tell\nourselves that, eventually, we'll get to shape our own lives.\n\nThen we turn 18 and we're expected to be \"adults\" and figure things out.\n\nIf we fail, we are punished.\n\nWe are blamed for not going to college, for being unhealthy, for being poor,\nfor not being able to afford healthcare and food and housing.\n\nBut it's not Alex\u2019s fault.\n\nThis is the same person we met 24 years ago. The world we've built has shaped\nhis life.\n\nSo he is our collective responsibility. They all are.\n\n## Explore the data\n\nSelect other factors to sort these people using the pulldown option on the\ntop.\n\nDon't feel like scrolling?
