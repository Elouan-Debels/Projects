He founded Nervana Systems (acquired by\nIntel) and MosaicML (acquired by Databricks), and now serves as vice president\nof generative AI at Databricks. From chips to models, there are few people\nwith a better pulse on how enterprises are using AI.\n\nIn this inaugural episode of the AI + a16z podcast, Rao joins a16z partner\nMatt Bornstein and a16z enterprise editor Derrick Harris to discuss where\nwe\u2019re at in terms of large language model (LLM) adoption, as well as how LLMs\nwill influence chip design and software refresh cycles. He also shares some of\nhis personal story of watching AI technology \u2014 and awareness \u2014 grow from\nfringe movement to mainstream phenomenon.\n\nHere are just a few of the many highlights from Rao:\n\n[6:21] \u201cI think the transformer being a standard paradigm is a good thing for\nhardware vendors, for sure, because it gives them an opportunity to actually\ncome into the game. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see this year. And that\u2019s\nwhy I think this year is where we\u2019ll actually see some competition [for\nNvidia].\n\n\u201cIs it [good] for the industry? I think it\u2019s a bit of an over over rotation on\nthe architecture \u2014 for now \u2014but that\u2019s just how these things go. We\u2019ve got\nsomething that works [and] we keep chasing it. I think whatever [is next],\nit\u2019ll have to be some sort of a modification of that paradigm to move\nforward.\u201d\n\n[8:26] \u201cIn Nervana, for instance, we were very focused on a particular set of\nprimitives, like multilayer perceptrons and convolutional nets. But then we\nhad things like resnets, which are convolutional nets, but have a different\nflow of information. That presented some issues. We changed the way we\npotentially will do convolutions: Can we do them in the frequency domain\ninstead of the time domain? That actually changes the motifs again.\n\n\u201cA lot of that kind of worked in favor of something like a GPU that was a\nlittle bit more flexible. But now that we have something that\u2019s more\nstereotyped, like with the transformer, it gives us an opportunity to go build\nsomething a little bit less flexible, but more performant.\u201d\n\n[18:35] \u201cNow, everywhere, we\u2019re seeing undergrads who come out of schools like\nStanford or Berkeley or whatever, who understand a lot about an LLM and how to\ntune in and make it do what they want. They know IFT, SFT, RLHF \u2014 they know\nall this stuff now, at least conceptually. So I think the talent is getting to\na point where it\u2019s proliferating into many enterprises. It\u2019s just, you\u2019re not\ngoing to see the density [as inside a large AI research lab]. You\u2019re not going\nto see a hundred-person infra team in these lines of business; you\u2019re going to\nsee a five-person infra team. So they need tools that abstract stuff.\u201d\n\n[26:37] \u201c[T]hat\u2019s the paradigm that shifted in my mind . . . pure supervised\nlearning required you to go and build a very high-quality data set that was\ncompletely supervised. That was hard and expensive, and you had to do a bunch\nof ML engineering. So that didn\u2019t quite take off, it was just too hard.\n\n\u201cBut now we can get this sort of smooth gradation of performance, where I say,\n\u2018Well, I have this base model that\u2019s pretty good \u2014 understands language,\nunderstands concepts. Then I can start to layer in the things that I do know.\n. . And if I don\u2019t have a ton of information, that\u2019s OK. I can still get to\nsomething which is useful.'\u201d\n\n[39:08] \u201c[I] went back to get a Ph.D. in neuroscience for the reason of: Can\nwe actually bring intelligence to machines and do it in a way that\u2019s\neconomically feasible? And that last part is actually very important, because\nif something is not economically feasible, it won\u2019t take off. It won\u2019t\nproliferate. It won\u2019t change the world.\n\n\u201cSo I love building technologies into products, because when someone pays you\nfor something, It means something very important. They saw something that adds\nvalue to them. They are solving a problem that they care about. They\u2019re\nimproving their business meaningfully \u2014 something. They\u2019re willing to part\nways with their money and give it to you for their product. That means\nsomething.\u201d\n\nIf you liked this episode, you can also listen to the other episode we\npublished this week: Making the Most of Open Source AI.
