Hundreds of thousands of ironwood trees flowed out of the Peruvian\nAmazon between 2000 and 2020, many of them illegally logged and extracted from\nthis region, Madre de Dios. A few miles from the port, a narrow line of trees\ntowers over a deforested landscape\u2014a grim portent of what could happen to the\nrest of the forest.\n\nOne morning in May, 2023, a lone truck, piled high with wooden beams, did\nsomething curious: it carried its cargo into Puerto Lucerna, against the usual\nflow of timber. The beams were headed for a remote pair of intertwined trees\nthat measured a hundred and thirty feet tall. There, a group of\nconservationists from Tamandua Expeditions planned to erect the highest tree\nhouse in the Amazon.\n\nOn the banks of the river, laborers loaded the wood onto small motorized\ncanoes called peque peques. One boat sank before it even pushed off, but\nworkers managed to recover the wood, and they successfully ferried it forty\nminutes upriver. Rollin Yvana, an accountant by training who had struggled to\nfind well-paid work in Puerto Maldonado, the regional capital, helped to load\nit onto a cart. \u201cThe path was disastrous,\u201d he recalled. Pushing it through the\nmud made him want to quit and go back to the city. But he also wanted to see\nthe great tree house finished.\n\nWhen Yvana and his colleagues reached the intertwined trees, they greeted a\nglobal collective of carpenters, arborists, and tree-house builders, known as\nthe Tree House Community. Philipp Klingspies, the group\u2019s founder, was\norchestrating the ascent of eighty massive wooden beams, which would support a\nspiral staircase attached to the trees. Sweaty workers used a pulley to lift\nthe beams one by one. Often, butterflies and wasps hitched a ride to the top;\non some days, crew members were stung a dozen times.\n\nWhen the structure reached about thirty feet, less than a third of its\neventual height, it swayed dangerously and needed to be tied to the trees with\na thick steel cable, cushioned against the bark with wood blocks and recycled\nrubber tires. Finally, the staircase was finished. Connected with some eight\nhundred bolts, it disappeared into the center of the treetop. Now the main\nplatform of the house could be built.\n\nKlingspies and Sava Burow, an expert arborist from Berlin, spent a day in the\ntrees, slicing away branches to offset part of the weight that the house would\nadd. Burow, who once built sets for night clubs, told me that his job was to\nmake \u201cnecessary cuts to achieve a stable coexistence of tree house and tree.\u201d\nSap spilled out of the stumps, like blood clotting to heal a wound.\n\nKlingspies and Burow had identified a problem with a colossal limb that was\nsupposed to be a main support for the tree house: almost a third of the wood\nwas hollow and soft with fungus. \u201cWe knew it was serious,\u201d Klingspies said. He\ntold the leaders of Tamandua that, in theory, they could stick to the original\ndesign. \u201cIt would definitely be good for maybe five, ten years,\u201d he reasoned,\nbut \u201cthat branch doesn\u2019t seem to want to accept so much for that much longer.\u201d\nIn the worst case, the fungus could hollow out the crucial branch until it\ncracked.\n\nThe destruction of the Amazon is already disrupting water cycles, warming the\nplanet, and threatening to drive thousands of species to extinction.\nProtecting the rain forest is one of the best ways that humans can avert a\nclimate catastrophe: its slow-growth trees can either sequester huge amounts\nof carbon dioxide or, if logged, spew the greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.\nBut there is more than one way to shield the Amazon from destruction. One\napproach, embodied by Tamandua Expeditions, is to \u201ccreate ecotourism that gets\npeople to appreciate how finite the things that they get to see are,\u201d Mohsin\nKazmi, one of the company\u2019s co-owners, told me. In the best case, tourists\nbecome ongoing supporters of conservation.\n\nAnother approach is embodied by the Junglekeepers, a nonprofit conservation\ngroup, which shares most of its leadership with Tamandua and works closely\nwith it. One of the co-founders of the Junglekeepers, Juan Julio Durand, grew\nup in a community of the Indigenous Ese\u2019Eja people; as a young man, Durand\nmined gold, felled trees, and served in the Army, fighting insurgent groups in\nthe Amazon. But, in 2005, he and his then partner acquired a plot of land from\na government concession, and he started to think about what it would take to\nprotect the forest. He eventually created the Junglekeepers with Paul Rosolie,\nan author and conservationist from New York. They believed that by attaining\nthe rights to a growing swath of land, they could train locals to patrol and\nprotect it. In their view, they could multiply their impact by focussing on\nthe Las Piedras River, because it was the extraction route for so many\nprotected lands.\n\nAfter the Junglekeepers started to patrol the forest, Tamandua started to hire\nthe nonprofit\u2019s rangers to help lead its for-profit expeditions. Then, in\n2019, Rosolie posted an Instagram video of himself standing in front of\nburning trees, during that year\u2019s widespread Amazon fires. \u201cWelcome to the\nfucking Anthropocene,\u201d he said. The video went viral, a nonprofit pledged more\nthan four million dollars to the Junglekeepers, and the organization expanded\nto patrol fifty thousand acres. Meanwhile, Stephane Thomas, a Bay Area\nsoftware-development manager who moonlights as a conservationist, joined as a\nco-director of both organizations.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nCrashes and Community in \u201cDemolition\u201d\n\nA pandemic pause in Amazon trips left Tamandua in bad shape. By the spring of\n2022, trails were overgrown, running water was nonexistent, and there were\nholes in the roof of Tamandua\u2019s operations center. Starting trips again would\nbe so difficult that Rosolie suggested a pivot. \u201cWe should build something\nthat has international recognition, like the world\u2019s tallest tree house,\u201d he\ntold his colleagues. He knew nothing about building tree houses.\n\n\u201cLet me take care of a few details,\u201d Thomas told Rosolie. The idea sounded\nfar-fetched, but Thomas drew up a budget; he proposed to cover it with his\nsavings, and to manage the construction from start to finish. \u201cHe was the one\nwho willed the tree house into being,\u201d Kazmi told me.\n\nDurand was skeptical at first, but he liked the idea of drawing new attention\nto the Amazon. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to show people there are things happening,\u201d he\nsaid, in part so that locals will join the effort. Soon, the group began\nplanning the tree house on land he owned. With luxury accommodations such as\nsolar panels and a full bathroom, it would cost more than a hundred thousand\ndollars to build; Tamandua planned to rent it out for up to two thousand\ndollars a night, attracting wealthy tourists\u2014and potential funders of\nconservation\u2014to a vulnerable, defendable part of the Amazon.\n\nThat summer, Tamandua asked the Tree House Community to join the project as\ntheir builder, and Klingspies, as the organization\u2019s founder, travelled to the\nLas Piedras basin. He and Rosolie climbed a tree and looked out over the\ncanopy; a towering ceiba, also known as a silk-cotton tree, caught their\nattention. But Klingspies worried that its height might attract lightning, and\nhe knew that ceibas heal slowly.\n\nThen they saw a curious pair of trees: a white quinilla that had been engulfed\nby a parasitic ficus tree, known as a strangler fig. The strangler fig looked\nas if it were part cooled lava, part web; the quinilla was still alive inside,\nits branches reaching out for sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s like a composite material\u2014you\nhave this hardwood core and a much softer, more flexible outer layer,\u201d\nKlingspies told me. \u201cTwo perfect trees fused together.\u201d\n\nWhen Victor Quio Trigoso, then a boat driver for the Junglekeepers, first\nheard about the tree house, he and his wife laughed at the \u201ccrazy gringos\u201d and\ntheir plan. He had profound respect for his organization\u2019s work, however. Quio\nhad once cut down trees for a living, until Durand persuaded him to join the\nconservation effort. \u201cHe gives us the option of being able to work in a\ndifferent way. . . . to see our forest in a different way,\u201d Quio told me. And\nso when Durand sent him a text, asking him to start working on the tree house,\nhe agreed.\n\nAt first, Quio helped salvage wood for the tree house, but soon Durand called\noff the search and sourced stacks of newly cut wood from a sustainable\nlumberyard. These arrived so far ahead of construction that, by the time eight\nbuilders from the Tree House Community got there, the wood was covered in a\nthick layer of slime. \u201cMost carpenters around the world would give anything to\njust get one of these beams,\u201d Klingspies told me. His team had hundreds of\npieces, but the wet wood kept gumming up power sanders and slipping out of\npeople\u2019s hands. In the end, it had to be exchanged for clean wood.\n\nKlingspies, who lives in a multilevel tree house in an intentional community\ncalled Auroville, in India, discovered more issues during his first days on-\nsite. When he climbed the tree to take measurements for the first time, he\nrealized that he\u2019d have to make adjustments to his meticulous design. \u201cEvery\nday is a big decision,\u201d he told me. He also noticed rotten fallen chunks of\nquinilla near the strangler\u2019s base; the host tree was slowly dying, and the\nstrangler fig was already sending roots into part of the quinilla\u2019s hollowed-\nout center. Klingspies and Burow, the arborist, trimmed strategically around\nthe host tree\u2019s living branches, helping it to get more light. All they could\ndo was hope that it would continue to grow for a while longer.\n\nWhen Klingspies discovered the extent of the fungus in the load-bearing\nbranch, he initially thought, This is going to be a terror. He came up with\nyet another design change: the tree house would be split in two so that the\nload could be distributed on both sides of the tree.\n\nOne day last summer, Yvana, whose muddy journey through the forest had made\nhim consider quitting, climbed the tree house\u2019s skeletal staircase. He stood\nat its highest point, about a hundred and ten feet up. A strong wind blew and\nthe tree swayed, pulling the structure along with it. Yvana was scared, but\nhis resolve was renewed. \u201cThe hardest was over,\u201d he told me. \u201cAfter that, it\ngot easier.\u201d In the weeks that followed, the construction work started to feel\na bit like summer camp. With the staircase out of the way, the rest of the\nstructure came together smoothly.\n\nLast July, I flew into Puerto Maldonado and hopped in a van alongside Durand\nand his colleagues. Together, we drove down the Interoceanic Highway toward\nthe heart of the rain forest. In between naps, Durand told me about the ups\nand downs of the build. As we turned down a winding red-dirt road, I thought\nabout how this beautiful route helped the Junglekeepers do their work, but\nalso enabled deforestation. At one point, we pulled over so that a flatbed\ntrailer, piled high with wood, could drive past us.\n\nThe first time I saw the tree house, it reminded me of an optical illusion. It\nwas hard to tell whether the staircase was leaning on the tree, or vice versa.\nI heard a buzz of machines up above; fine sawdust fell to the forest floor.\nI\u2019d seen a strangler fig before, but never juxtaposed against the straight,\ngeometric lines of a hundred-and-ten-foot structure.\n\nIn parts of Latin America, strangler figs are known as matapalos, or tree\nkillers. A matapalo spreads when its seeds land on the branches of a host\ntree, then sprout and attach roots in moist areas. As the host tree grows, the\nmatapalo\u2019s roots slowly stretch downward, multiplying and spreading until they\nreach the ground. The trees live together for a time. Then, assuming that the\nmatapalo doesn\u2019t grow so fast that it topples over, the host tree loses access\nto sunshine and nutrients and dies where it stands. I thought about the way\nthat humans treat the Amazon rain forest. At best, our relationship could be\nsymbiotic; at worst, parasitic.\n\nOne afternoon, I climbed the stairs with Durand. We walked around the tree\nhouse\u2019s deck and took in the view. Gazing out into a thick forest, it was\ndifficult to fathom that we were there because everything around us could one\nday disappear, or be irrevocably altered. It was too vast, too lush, too\nalive. The tree house is a tool for conservation because it\u2019s in the middle of\nsomething that we\u2019re losing, but still have the power to save.\n\nThat week, I witnessed the final days of the main construction. A window was\nbrought in from Puerto Lucerna, plumbing was installed alongside the tree, and\nsolar panels rode up the pulley system to the roof of the bathroom, where\nthey\u2019d get the most sun. The wasps were still circling, but Klingspies and his\nteam figured that most would disappear once the sweaty workers did.\n\nAs builders finished up and started to depart, nostalgia set in. On a cool\nevening in mid-July, Klingspies joined the remaining team members and burned\nincense at a gratitude ceremony. \u201cWe just want to make a small moment of\npeace,\u201d he said, \u201cto breathe the oxygen the trees are giving us to use, and\nmove, and to do things in life.\u201d A few days later, all but a few of us were on\nour way out, crossing the river on our different ways home. Yvana, however,\nhad decided to stay on full time. He waved goodbye from the riverbank in\nPuerto Lucerna.\n\nThe tree house, now called Alta Sanctuary, soon started to accept reservations\non its Web site, helped in part by Rosolie\u2019s appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s\npodcast. Before guests arrived, though, Yvana wanted to experience it for\nhimself. One day last fall, he set out for the strangler fig. On the trail, he\nfelt the eyes of the rain forest on him, and he started to walk faster. But at\nthe base of the tree house he looked up and felt calm. People can really\nachieve incredible things, he thought. He climbed into the tree, set down his\nthings in the space that he had helped to build, and lay down in the bed. In\nthe profound silence, he could hear his thoughts in a way that he never had\nbefore. He fell asleep quickly.\n\nWhen Yvana woke up, the sun was slowly burning away the mist in the trees. He\nstepped out onto the deck and gazed into the green forest. In the distance, he\nheard a howler monkey, roaring like a tiger to keep predators and competitors\nat bay. He stood there for a while, admiring the Amazon\u2019s unbroken canopy.\nThen he packed up. It was time to get back to work. \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nAllison Keeley is a writer based in Mexico and the U.S.\n\nMore:AmazonPeruRain ForestsTree HousesConservation\n\n### Daily\n\nOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top\nstories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.\n\nRead More\n\nFiction\n\n\u201cLate Love\u201d\n\nThe wife had to wonder if the marriage had been a mistake.\n\nBy Joyce Carol Oates\n\nDept. of Medicine\n\nHow to Die in Good Health\n\nThe average American celebrates just one healthy birthday after the age of\nsixty-five.
