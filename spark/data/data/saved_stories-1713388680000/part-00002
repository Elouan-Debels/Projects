However, the two\ncompanies soon proved to be culturally incompatible, the writer notes.(photo\ncredit: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nAnti-Israel activists protesting Google contracts with the Israeli government\nby occupying the technology giant\u2019s office in New York City and Sunnyvale for\nseveral hours on Tuesday, were arrested and put on administrative leave,\naccording to a Google spokesperson.\n\nProtesters were arrested by police officers after refusing to leave Google\nCloud CEO Thomas Kurian\u2019s Sunnyvale office or New York City Chelsea workspace\nfor almost 10 hours. The sit-in protests were live-streamed by the No Tech for\nApartheid activist movement, which claims to represent technology company\nemployees against business with the State of Israel.\n\n\u201cPhysically impeding other employees\u2019 work and preventing them from accessing\nour facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and we will investigate\nand take action,\u201d a Google spokesperson said. \u201cThese employees were put on\nadministrative leave and their access to our systems was cut. After refusing\nmultiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove\nthem to ensure office safety.\u201d\n\nThe occupations of Google workspaces were joined by demonstrations outside the\npremises and in Seattle. The chief demand of No Tech for Apartheid, a project\nby Jewish Voice for Peace and Linda Sarsour\u2019s MPower Change, was the\ncancellation of the Project Nimbus contract and cessation of business with the\nIsraeli government. No Tech For Apartheid claimed that Google\u2019s technology was\nbeing used to support occupation and a so-called genocide in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe cannot stand against Google\u2019s power unless we hit them where their\nprinciples are \u2013 that principle is maximum profit and all we have against it\nis our labor,\u201d said an activist in Party for Socialism and Liberation Bay Area\nTuesday social media video of a protest.\n\nProtestors take part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration, amid the ongoing\nconflict between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Berlin,\nGermany, April 6, 2024. (credit: Lisi Niesner/Reuters)\n\nAnother activist said \u201cAs tech workers we\u2019re in a unique position to put\ninternal pressure on our employers and throughout the industry.\u201d\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\n### Who were the protesters?\n\nThe Google spokesperson said that only a few of the activists were actually\nemployees.\n\n\u201cThese protests were part of a longstanding campaign by a group of\norganizations and people who largely don\u2019t work at Google,\u201d said the Google\nspokesperson. \u201cA small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a\ncouple of our locations.\u201d\n\nNo Tech For Apartheid has long been rallying against business between Israel\nand Google, and in particular against Project Nimbus, which was awarded to\nGoogle and Amazon in 2021, beating out bids on the project from Microsoft,\nOracle, and IBM.\n\nSoon after, Google and Amazon workers published an open letter condemning the\nprogram to provide a comprehensive cloud service for the government, the\nnational defense system, and other bodies in the Israeli economy. As part of\nthe project, the tech giants were tasked with establishing cloud-based data\ncenters in a plan to move a majority of the government\u2019s IT infrastructure to\ncloud-based servers. The anti-Israel activists also began a petition against\nthe project, which had amassed 94,305 signatures by Wednesday.\n\nAlphabet stockholders voted at a 2022 annual stockholders meeting against a\nproposal presented by Google employee and No Tech for Apartheid leader Gabriel\nSchubiner to assess the company\u2019s role in Project Nimbus. The Alphabet board\nof directors had also recommended voting against the proposal.\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid said in its Tuesday demands that Google was harassing,\nintimidating, and censoring Palestinian, Arab, Muslim Googlers, and that they\naddress what they said was a \u201cmajor health & safety workplace conditions\nissue\u201d created by the project.\n\n\u201cMultiple workers have quit citing the serious mental health consequences of\nworking at a company that is using their labor to enable a genocide,\u201d No Tech\nfor Apartheid said its website manifesto. \u201cWe demand that Google stop the\nretaliation against and doxxing of workers speaking out, and create a safe\nworking environment for all workers.\u201d\n\nAriel Koren, another Google employee and No Tech for Apartheid leader, quit\nthe company alleging that other Jewish employees had created a toxic work\nenvironment against her views and that Google had retaliated against her by\nrelocating her position to Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nRecommended byWhat is Outbrain\n\nEddie Hatfield, who according to No Tech for Apartheid addressed protesters\noutside the Chelsea Google office, was fired in March after interrupting\nGoogle Israel CEO Barak Regev at an Israeli tech industry conference in New\nYork City.\n\nHe was escorted out of the conference to boos and jeers while making a speech\nagainst Google\u2019s collaboration in Project Nimbus. A JVP (Jewish Voice for\nPeace) activist was also removed from the hall for interruptions, according to\nthe anti-Zionist organization.\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid\u2019s opposition has only intensified with an April 12 New\nYork Times report that in March Google drafted a contract for consulting on\nallowing multiple units access to automation technologies. The report also\nindicated that the Defense Ministry had a secure entry point into Google Cloud\nto store and process data and access artificial intelligence services.\n\nBenzi Gad contributed to this report.\n\nRelated TagsprotestsPro-Palestinian groupsgoogleapartheid\n\nTake Israel home with the new Jerusalem Post Store\n\nShop now >>\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nHot Opinion\n\n### In its response to Iran, Israel must weigh new regional cooperation\n\nBy JPOST EDITORIAL\n\n### Following Iran's attack, more US aid is needed for Israel\n\nBy MARTIN OLINER\n\n### To the American Jews: Its time to stop apologizing\n\nBy GIL TROY\n\n### Israel needs to fight its legal battles in the multi-front war\n\nBy YISRAEL MEDAD\n\n### Passover is an expression of Jewish indigeneity in the Land of Israel\n\nBy BEN M.
