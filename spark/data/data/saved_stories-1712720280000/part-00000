Inside: Two new datasets liberated, hazmat transportation incident\ndata improved, new FOIAs, FOIA updates, and DLP in the news.\n\n## Liberated: National Water Use Inventory records\n\nIn March 2023, the Data Liberation Project filed a FOIA request to the US\nGeological Survey (USGS) for the most detailed data records the agency\nmaintains in its Congressionally-mandated \u201ccomprehensive national water use\ninventory.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, 2024, USGS provided a set of responsive records:\n\n  * 50 state/territory-specific spreadsheets, containing site-level water conveyance data, covering 49 states (minus New Jersey) and Puerto Rico\n  * 1 spreadsheet containing conveyance data for \u201cmultiple states for which there is only withdrawal information but no delivery information\u201d\n  * 1 data dictionary spreadsheet\n\nThe conveyance spreadsheets contain 823,000+ rows, each representing a\nmeasured or estimated volume of water conveyed between two \u201csites\u201d in a given\nyear.\n\nUnfortunately, USGS has redacted the majority of site identifiers (as well as\nmany other details) under FOIA exemption 7. The DLP\u2019s research also has also\nidentified issues with incompleteness and duplication in the records.\n\nEven so, we believe that the records are of substantial public value. This\nappears to be the first time that national, site-level conveyance data has\nbeen publicly available.\n\nTo get started with the records, please consult the DLP\u2019s introductory\ndocumentation.\n\nThank you to DLP volunteers Kate Miller and Joerg Rings for their\ncontributions to the documentation, and to Maddy Varner for co-filing the\nrequest.\n\n## Liberated: National Organic Program investigations\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Organic Program launched a new,\ncompliance-focused database in early 2019, allowing the organization \u201cto\nbetter track case progress and more quickly identify patterns and\nrelationships across complaints.\u201d\n\nIn December 2023, we filed a FOIA request seeking a comprehensive set of\ncomplaint, investigation, and outcome records from this database, as well as\ndocumentation concerning the database\u2019s structure and interpretation.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, the agency sent its first interim response, providing a\nspreadsheet that appears to list all closed investigations in the database.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,501 entries. Its twelve columns indicate the\nfollowing information for each case:\n\n  * Case number\n  * NOP case number\n  * Subject/title\n  * Regulatory citations\n  * Account/company name\n  * Complaint type (\u201cUncertified Operation\u201d being the most common, followed by \u201cFraud\u201d, \u201cPesticide Residue\u201d, \u201cLabeling Error\u201d, and several others)\n  * Complaint subtype\n  * Inquiry received date/time\n  * Case opened date/time\n  * Case closed date/time\n  * Outcomes (e.g., \u201cCompliance\u201d, \u201cNo Violation\u201d, \u201cNo Investigation\u201d, \u201cCivil Penalty\u201d, etc.)\n  * Collected amount (for civil penalty outcomes)\n\n\u201d[The USDA\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service] will continue to process the\nremainder of your request and will forward any responsive records promptly\nupon completion of review,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s letter.\n\nThank you to DLP volunteer Molly Longman, who collaborated on the request and\nexamined the responsive records.\n\n## Improved: Hazmat transportation incident data\n\nSince last February, the DLP has been running a data pipeline to improve the\naccessibility of data on transportation incidents involving hazardous\nmaterials. As we wrote in DLP Dispatch #6:\n\n> Federal law requires the reporting of spills, explosions, and other safety-\n> endangering incidents involving hazardous materials to the Department of\n> Transportation\u2019s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration\n> (PHMSA).\n>\n> The reports include details about the location of the incident, mode of\n> transportation, parties involved, hazardous materials involved, causes of\n> failure, fatalities, injuries, financial cost, and more.\n>\n> PHSMA publishes the submitted reports through an online portal. But the\n> portal is brittle and doesn\u2019t provide a straightforward way to download the\n> full set of submitted reports.\n>\n> So our repository automates the downloading \u2014 and updating \u2014 of all data\n> available through the portal.\n\nWe have a few major improvements to share, thanks to contributions from DLP\nvolunteers:\n\n  * Kate Miller added substantial, helpful documentation explaining the data\u2019s context and nitty-gritty details. Kate has also contributed Python code demonstrating ways to explore and use the data.\n\n  * Madeline Everett developed a filtered version of the dataset, which focuses just on incidents deemed to have \u201cserious\u201d effects. (Thanks to that contribution, you can also now keep tabs on those serious incidents via RSS.)\n\n## New FOIAs\n\nSince the latest dispatch, we\u2019ve filed three new requests. They seek:\n\n  * Data on all Medicare \u201cLevel 2\u201d appeals, co-requested with Mike Gartner.\n  * Documentation of CMS\u2019s Medicare Appeals System, co-requested with Mike Gartner.\n  * Airline disclosures to the Dept. of Transportation regarding credit they\u2019ve extended to federal political candidates, co-requested with Urvashi Uberoy.\n\n## FOIA updates\n\n  * Thanks to a follow-up FOIA request, we have updated the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) dataset and interfaces, which now cover RMP submissions through late March 2024.\n  * USPS partly granted our appeal seeking records from/about its Rural Route Evaluated Compensation System (RRECS), requiring the FOIA office to conduct a search for (only) the documentation records we sought.\n  * CBP denied our request for documentation of its Automated Targeting System.\n  * The DEA partly granted our appeal in our request for records from/about its Theft Loss Reporting system, remanding a search, which was then swiftly denied.\n\n## DLP in the news\n\nIt\u2019s always nice to see folks using DLP-sourced data and citing us. Some\nrecent examples:\n\n  * FedScoop\u2019s Rebecca Heilweil reported on the TSA complaint counts we liberated, and quoted us about the problems with TSA publishing the records as PDFs.\n\n  * The Connecticut Post\u2019s Richard Chumney credited the Data Liberation Project for flagging an inspection report about problems at Connecticut\u2019s Beardsley Zoo, which we identified through our APHIS inspection data pipeline.\n\n  * Corin Faife wrote about his experience collaborating with the Data Liberation Project, and what he learned about FOIA\u2019ing for data along the way.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now! Thank you for reading, and don\u2019t hesitate to reply.\nAlternatively, fill out the volunteer form and/or suggestion form.\n\n\u2014 Jeremy\n\nDon't miss what's next.
