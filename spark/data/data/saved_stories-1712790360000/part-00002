GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini Pro 1.5 are \u201cmultimodal\u201d systems, able to\naccept more than just text. Each can take image input, while Gemini can also\naccept audio and video.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning in France, Mistral, an AI startup founded by\na number of Clegg\u2019s former colleagues in Meta\u2019s AI team, released its frontier\nmodel, Mixtral 8x22B. Unlike its two American competitors, Mixtral was\nreleased through a simple download link to a 281GB file: the company, like\nMeta, takes an \u201copen source\u201d approach, and publishes its AI systems free for\nanyone to download and build upon.\n\nThat approach has been criticised as potentially dangerous, since it leaves\nthe developer unable to intervene and stop its systems being used for harmful\nends, nor to pull models offline if vulnerabilities or biases are discovered\nand need to be fixed. Others, including Meta, defend it as ultimately leading\nto better outcomes than systems \u201ckept in the clammy hands of a small number of\nvery, very large, well-heeled companies in California\u201d.\n\nMeta\u2019s Llama 3 is expected to be released initially in its smaller, less\npowerful versions, according to a report from The Information, building up to\na release of the company\u2019s most advanced frontier model this summer. However,\nit may face stiff competition: OpenAI is believed to be planning a similar\ntimeframe for its next GPT model, GPT-5, with the company\u2019s chief operating\nofficer, Brad Lightcap, telling the Financial Times it would be coming \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nHowever, experts have queried whether the \u201clarge language model\u201d approach\nshared by all frontier AI systems might be hitting its limits. \u201cWe hear a lot\nof people saying: \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re going to get [artificial general\nintelligence] within the next year,\u201d said Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist, Yann\nLeCun, responding to a claim from the xAI founder, Elon Musk. \u201cIt\u2019s just not\nhappening. We have AI systems that can pass the bar exam, but they can\u2019t clear\nup your dinner table and fill up the dishwasher. We have systems that\nmanipulate language, and fool us into thinking that they are smart, but cannot\nunderstand the world.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

That \u201cis more of a vision than anything else\u201d, he added, \u201cbut it\u2019s\nmaking exponential progress, so I\u2019m pretty confident that we\u2019ll get there\u201d.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Technology sector\n  * OpenAI\n  * Google\n  * Meta\n  * Nick Clegg\n  * France\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Meta\u2019s Nick Clegg plays down AI\u2019s threat to global democracy\n\n1d ago\n\n  * ### Why I wrote an AI transparency statement for my book, and think other authors should too\n\n6d ago\n\n  * ### \u2018Time is running out\u2019: can a future of undetectable deepfakes be avoided?\n\n2d ago\n\n  * ### Chinese mourners turn to AI to remember and \u2018revive\u2019 loved ones\n\n7d ago\n\n  * ### Google fined \u20ac250m in France for breaching intellectual property deal\n\n20 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Two OpenAI book lawsuits partially dismissed by California court\n\n14 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Many-shot jailbreak\u2019: lab reveals how AI safety features can be easily bypassed\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Nvidia: what\u2019s so good about the tech firm\u2019s new AI superchip?\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
