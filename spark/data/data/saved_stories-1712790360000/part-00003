The legislation adds to a growing number of\nattempts from lawmakers, news outlets and artists to establish how AI firms\nuse creative works like songs, visual art, books and movies to train their\nsoftware\u2013and whether those companies are illegally building their tools off\ncopyrighted content.\n\nThe California Democratic congressman Adam Schiff introduced the bill, the\nGenerative AI Copyright Disclosure Act, which would require that AI companies\nsubmit any copyrighted works in their training datasets to the Register of\nCopyrights before releasing new generative AI systems, which create text,\nimages, music or video in response to users\u2019 prompts. The bill would need\ncompanies to file such documents at least 30 days before publicly debuting\ntheir AI tools, or face a financial penalty. Such datasets encompass billions\nof lines of text and images or millions of hours of music and movies.\n\n\u201cAI has the disruptive potential of changing our economy, our political\nsystem, and our day-to-day lives. We must balance the immense potential of AI\nwith the crucial need for ethical guidelines and protections,\u201d Schiff said in\na statement.\n\nWhether major artificial intelligence companies worth billions have made\nillegal use of copyrighted works is increasingly the source of litigation and\ngovernment investigation. Schiff\u2019s bill would not ban AI from training on\ncopyrighted material, but would put a sizable onus on companies to list the\nmassive swath of works that they use to build tools like ChatGPT \u2013 data that\nis usually kept private.\n\nSchiff\u2019s bill, which was first reported by Billboard, has received the support\nof numerous entertainment industry organizations and unions, including the\nRecording Industry Association of America, Professional Photographers of\nAmerica, Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild-American\nFederation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\n\u201cEverything generated by AI ultimately originates from a human creative\nsource. That\u2019s why human creative content\u2013intellectual property\u2013must be\nprotected,\u201d said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA\u2019s national executive\ndirector and chief negotiator.\n\nProminent artificial intelligence companies such as OpenAI are facing lawsuits\nover their alleged use of copyrighted works to build tools like ChatGPT. Both\nSarah Silverman and the New York Times have filed copyright infringement\nclaims against the startup. OpenAI has hired a raft of top lawyers in the past\nyear, according to the Washington Post, as it gears up to face over a dozen\nmajor lawsuits.\n\nOpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies have denied wrongdoing and\nclaimed that their use of copyrighted material falls under fair use, a legal\ndoctrine that allows for some unlicensed use of copyrighted materials under\ncertain conditions. The legal strategy poses a major test for copyright law,\nand the result may wreck artists\u2019 livelihoods or OpenAI\u2019s bottom line. In a\nsubmission to a UK government committee earlier this year, lawyers for OpenAI\ncontended that \u201clegally, copyright law does not forbid training.\u201d OpenAI also\nstated in that submission that, without access to copyrighted works, its tools\nwould cease to function.\n\nAs generative AI companies have expanded their tools\u2019 capabilities,\nentertainment industry workers have also pushed back against the technology\nand its potential threat to artists\u2019 rights. Last week, a group of over 200\nhigh-profile musical artists released an open letter calling for increased\nprotections against AI and demanding that companies not develop tools that\ncould undermine or replace musicians and songwriters.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * OpenAI\n  * ChatGPT\n  * Democrats\n  * US politics\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
