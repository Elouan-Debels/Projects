For Now.\u201d\n\nThe 25-minute-long review is an in-depth look at the revolutionary device \u2014\nthe first part looks at what the product was designed to do, and the second\npart explores what it actually delivers in real life usage. Brownlee says the\npin is \u201cbad at almost everything it does basically all the time.\u201d\n\nHumane has raised over $230 million in funding to develop and launch the $699\nAI Pin.\n\n## The Review Has Sparked Controversy\n\nSome people online have taken exception to Brownlee\u2019s review and video title,\ncalling both \u201cunethical\u201d and saying that the review effectively destroys any\nchance Humane AI has to survive in the hyper-competitive world of consumer\nelectronics.\n\n\u201cI find it distasteful, almost unethical, to say this when you have 18 million\nsubscribers,\u201d writes Daniel Vassallo on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\u201cHard to explain why, but with great reach comes great responsibility.\nPotentially killing someone else\u2019s nascent project reeks of carelessness.\nFirst, do no harm.\u201d\n\nTo which Brownlee replied: \u201cWe disagree on what my job is.\u201d\n\n> MKBHD bankrupted a company in 41 seconds\n>\n> A slight criticism from a big Youtuber, let alone calling the product\n> HORRENDOUS, is enough to make a company go bust\n>\n> Creators are so much more powerful in 2024 than you think\n>\n> This clip will be the gravestone for Humane pic.twitter.com/UbVtEHbN1g\n>\n> \u2014 Alex Finn (@AlexFinnX) April 15, 2024\n\nAnother X user, Stanley Ezinna, also questions whether Brownlee\u2019s review was\nethical.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the line between review and defamation,\u201d he writes. \u201cMarques Brownlee\nis massively influential, his reviews mean so much.\u201d\n\nOthers drew comparisons with Brownlee\u2019s review of the EV Fisker which he\ncalled \u201cthe worst car I\u2019ve ever reviewed.\u201d\n\n> Marques Brownlee singlehandedly destroying startups\n> pic.twitter.com/MIaCkDbCc3\n>\n> \u2014 Wordsmith (@OlePundit) April 16, 2024\n\n> If I had money, I would create start-ups to invent increasingly stupid tech\n> products and send them to Marques Brownlee for review so I can bait him into\n> titling a video \"OK, this is seriously now the worst product I've reviewed,\n> it can't get worse\" and I send him something worse\n>\n> \u2014 derek guy (@dieworkwear) April 15, 2024\n\nHowever, many on X defended Brownlee. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuinely terrible product,\u201d\nwrites a user called Stuart. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s early tech. He praised it\nfor build quality but that doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a bad product. In the end,\nwe need honest reviews.\u201d\n\n## Brownlee Was Not the Only Reviewer Who Gave the AI Pin a Bad Rating\n\nThe Verge describes the AI Pin as an \u201cinteresting idea that is so thoroughly\nunfinished and so totally broken is so many unacceptable ways.\u201d\n\nThe main complaints from reviewers are that the device simply doesn\u2019t work.\nRobbed of a screen, the pin is mostly used via voice (it also has a laser\nprojection system), and as anyone who has ever had a frustrating conversation\nwith Siri or Alexa knows, they often don\u2019t cooperate.\n\nWriters bemoan that the Pin took too long to reply when asked to do something.\nThe Pin has a camera with a Vision feature meaning the lens can analyze what\nis in front of it but the reviewers reported that most of the time the Pin\ndidn\u2019t respond or said the wrong answer.\n\nImage credits: Header image by Marques Brownlee.\n\nCulture, News\n\naipin, humane, humaneai, marquesbrownlee, review, youtuber\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThe \u2018Ai Pin\u2019 is the Name of Humane\u2019s Camera-Equipped, Intelligent Wearable\n\nMarques Brownlee Tries Out OpenAI\u2019s Video Generator Sora and Shares His\nThoughts\n\nHumane\u2019s Wearable $699 AI Pin Has a Camera But No Screen\n\nMarques Brownlee on iPhone 12 Pro Max Camera: \u2018The Differences are Mostly\nImperceptible\u2019\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nScientists Photograph 50 Never-Before-Seen Deep Sea Species\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\nMKBHD Calls Humane AI Pin the \u2018Worst Product\u2019 He\u2019s Ever Reviewed\n\n9 hours ago\n\nTourist Falls 170 Feet Off a Cliff to Her Death While Taking Selfie\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\nPhotographer Helps Grizzly Bear Narrowly Escape Oncoming Train\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nSmallRig Debuts New Products and Fund to Support Creators\n\nApr 14, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
