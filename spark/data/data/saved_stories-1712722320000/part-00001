Its goal was to create\na multilingual keyword-based naming system for the Internet that would\ntranslate keywords typed into the address bar of Microsoft's Internet Explorer\nweb browser to Uniform Resource Identifiers, based on the existing Domain Name\nSystem, that would access the page registered by the owner of the RealNames\nkeyword.\n\nIn effect, to users of Internet Explorer, RealNames became a domain registry\nwhich was capable of registering names that worked without needing to belong\nto a top-level domain such as \".com\" or \".net\". RealNames and its backers\nexpected this to be a lucrative source of income, and it raised more than $130\nmillion of funding.\n\nRealNames depended on its partnership with Microsoft, which offered the\nRealNames service on Internet Explorer. RealNames shut down operations in 2002\nfollowing a decision by Microsoft to redirect the 1 billion page views per\ncalendar quarter that RealNames was resolving from the browser address bar\ninto the MSN search engine.\n\nIn 2014, Tucows purchased RealNames.com. The domain now hosts a customized\ne-mail service, made possible by its acquisition of Mailbank and its long list\nof surname domain names.^[1]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Alternative DNS root\n  * AOL keyword\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Blast from the past: Tucows relaunches RealNames (and it's very different) - Domain Name Wire | Domain Name News & Website Stuff\".
