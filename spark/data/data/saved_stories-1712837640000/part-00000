Among the familiar locals are sparrows, chickadees, juncos, finches,\ntowhees, nuthatches, titmice, goldfinches, cardinals, blue jays, catbirds,\nmourning doves, wrens, downy, red-bellied, and pileated woodpeckers, flickers,\nrobins, crows, starlings, blackbirds, red-winged blackbirds, cowbirds, and\nhummingbirds. This spring alone, I\u2019ve already seen several Eastern Bluebirds \u2013\nNew York State\u2019s bird emblem, previously seldom in our area. Then there are\nperiodic visits from owls, buzzards, ducks, geese, hawks, eagles, kites,\nherons, and orioles. While owls remain elusive sightings, their nightly calls\nweave beauty into our evenings sitting in the dusk after watching the sunset.\nWe know it is mostly the large Great Horned Owl that we have sighted because\nof the Merlin Bird ID App, which has also allowed us to identify new species\nmore easily in our area and appreciate the full symphony of our community.\n\nSince I was a child, I have been captivated by birds. They are exquisite\ncreatures, each with their own story to tell. To accommodate our feathered\nfriends, we maintain various bird feeders, though these often require\nreplacement due to the persistent efforts of squirrels, raccoons, and\noccasionally, bears. Additionally, designated ground feeding areas, bird\nbaths, and water bowls contribute to the bird\u2019s diverse needs.\n\nEven a custom-built freestanding wood pedestal birdfeeder, procured from\nSwitzerland, proved unable to thwart the resourcefulness of squirrels, though\nit did amuse us before we retired it, as they could get inside it but couldn\u2019t\nget out.\n\nThe native plants that grow naturally, and that I have planted make a big\ndifference further deepening my appreciation for the intricate web of life.\nThe oak tree, as entomologist Doug Tallamy has said, is a keystone plant of\nthe local foodweb and supports over 500 species of caterpillars. The mangles\nof wild grape (Picea species) seem to be loved by almost all of the birds. The\nfruit of Serviceberries (Amelanchier), Dogwood (Cornus florida), Eastern red\ncedar (Juniperus virginiana), and Spicebush (Lindera benzoin), also provide\nabundantly for them. The large Spruces fruit in the fall and last through\nwinter and on our property functions as the Grand Central Station for the bird\ncommunity. The pines too feed them year-round.\n\nNative plant landscaping is a powerful way to support biodiversity and I have\nchosen to plant some bird-friendly natives such as goldenrods, echinacea,\nasters, butterfly weed, field thistle, rue, fleabane, milkweed, verbena,\nelderberry, inkberry, sumac, and more.\n\nWhen dividing your flowering native plants, I suggest giving them to neighbors\nto enhance your local greenbelt.\n\nAmidst gardening endeavors and daily routines, the presence of birds enriches\nour lives, fostering a profound connection to the natural world. Observing\nthem both in their natural habitat and the nature of our backyard instills a\nsense of peace and harmony, offering moments of tranquility and even\nmeditative reflection. Through the years, I\u2019ve amassed a wealth of knowledge\nabout different species, their behaviors, and migration patterns,\n\nIdentifying new bird species and understanding their behaviors can be\nintellectually satisfying and it helps me pull together a better understanding\nof how climate change is shifting the environment. Capturing photographs of\nbirds and documenting diverse avian visitors has been something I have done\nover the years that has helped me to become more aware of my property as an\necosystem and increase my conservation efforts for the well-being of local\nbird populations.\n\nI would encourage you to read Amy Tan\u2019s latest literary offering, \u201cThe\nBackyard Bird Chronicles,\u201d which unveils a treasure trove of anecdotes,\nobservations, and drawings based on years of nature journaling by her avian\nbackyard encounters in Sausalito, California. This delightful book serves as a\ntestament to the joys of nature journaling, offering intimate glimpses into\nthe lives of backyard birds and igniting a newfound appreciation for their\nunique beauty, behaviors, and resilience.\n\nIf you want to learn about birds and what nature journaling can be, this is\nyour book. Her beautiful writing and drawings are a guide to a local bird\ncommunity, and it will touch your heart and help you see birds differently.\n\nBirdwatching transcends age and background, offering a shared pursuit that\nfosters bonds with loved ones and kindred spirits. While I\u2019ve yet to join\nlocal birdwatching groups, the ever-changing rhythms of bird behavior\u2014nesting,\nfeeding, migration\u2014underscore the cyclical nature of existence, enriching our\nunderstanding of the world around us.\n\nBy cultivating a bird-friendly environment, we not only nurture local\npopulations but also cultivate a deeper awareness of our interconnectedness\nwith the natural world. Through mindful observation and conservation efforts,\nwe play a vital role in safeguarding these delicate ecosystems for future\ngenerations. In essence, backyard birdwatching is a source of boundless joy\nand enrichment, blending elements of nature, education, and community.\n\nGayil Nalls, Ph.D., is the creator of World Sensorium and founder of the World\nSensorium/ Conservancy.\n\nEarth Day is April 22. If you can this year, plant, and care for an oak tree.\n\nFor more information about The Backyard Bird Chronicles, visit www.amytan.net.\n\n## Plantings\n\nIssue 30 \u2013 December 2023\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nViriditas: Musings on Magical Plants: Portulaca oleracea By Margaux Crump\n\nProboscis, Pollen, and the Rapture of Interspecies Intimacy By Jake Eshelman\n\nThe Greening of Milan: Porta Nuova and Vertical Forest By Gayil Nalls\n\nOvershooting Earth\u2019s Boundaries: An Interview with Bill Rees By Rachel Donald\n\nThe Garden of the Five Senses By Gayil Nalls\n\nEat More Plants Recipes: Le Botaniste\u2019s Fennel, Tomato, and Red Pepper Pasta\nSauce\n\nNature Sketching with WS/C\n\nNature Sketching with WS/C\n\nOctober: Capturing Landscapes in Light, Shade, and Color By Gayil Nalls, Liz\nMacklin, and Karen Bauer\n\n## Plantings Print Annual 2023\n\nDo you have the 2023 Plantings print annual?\n\nPlantings cultivates innovative ideas and fresh perspectives, nurturing the\nglobal conservation community.
