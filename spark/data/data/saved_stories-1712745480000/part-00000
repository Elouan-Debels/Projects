In an interview with Blocks & Files, the\ncompany gave more insight into this choice.\n\n> \u201cWe had a huge chunk of our engineering staff spending time improving\n> FreeBSD as opposed to working on features and functionalities.

The fact that TrueNAS\nwas a FreeBSD-based product for this long was amazing, and I would definitely\nhave preferred if it stayed that way for many, many more years to come.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think the people of TrueNAS are saying anything wrong or\noutrageous here. They\u2019ve got employees to feed, and the money is in Linux, not\nFreeBSD. If they spend more money, time, and resources on getting FreeBSD on\npar with features Linux has had for ages than on actually developing their own\nproduct \u2013 TrueNAS \u2013 then they\u2019re fighting a losing battle. Honestly, I\u2019m\nsurprised it\u2019s taken them this long to take this controversial step.\n\nAll we can hope for is that the things they work on, the features they\ndevelop, will make it to FreeBSD regardless.\n\n#### About The Author\n\n##### Thom Holwerda\n\nFollow me on Mastodon @thomholwerda@social.tchncs.de\n\n#### 2 Comments\n\n  1. 2024-04-09 7:25 pm\n\nAlfman verbose=1\n\nYears ago I made the exact same decision myself for the same reasons. But I\nstill find it sad that alternatives always seem to get crushed as dominant\nsolution keep becoming more dominant. In the old unix world interoperability\nwas king. But for better or worse a lot of linux development promotes linux\nonly interfaces without regards for the broader unix ecosystem.\n\nI hope FOSS doesn\u2019t become a linux only mono-culture, but being the best\nsupported FOSS platform gives it a large advantage and its easy to why most\nFOSS users are turning to linux at the exclusion of others. It\u2019s not that they\ndon\u2019t have merit. In some ways the BSDs have more merit, but when you exist in\nthe long tail the network effects are constantly working against you\nunfortunately.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n  2. 2024-04-09 7:38 pm\n\nunix_joe\n\nTwenty years ago, Kris Moore and the rest of their team put tremendous effort\nin lowering the barrier to entry for FreeBSD on the desktop, and irrationally\nstuck with the project as a base during the down years. This while FreeBSD\ndeveloped a reputation as being a side project by people enamored with Apple\nwho only ran it in a VM on their Macbooks while basic things like Intel\ngraphics and wifi were broken for years on baremetal installs. This is about\nthe time that I stopped using FreeBSD.\n\nIn other words, PC-BSD and iXsystems ate their own dog food long after it\nexpired, and somehow managed to squeak a living out of it. That\u2019s dedication\nand deserves kudos.\n\nUpstream is Linux. OpenZFS is Linux. Hardware drivers are in Linux first. The\npragmatic choice is to rebase on Linux. Why waste resources duplicating work\non FreeBSD at a small company when trillion dollar companies aren\u2019t doing the\nwork either?\n\nDebian is a fine platform; I\u2019ve standardized on it both professionally and on\nthe home network.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n### Search OSNEWS\n\n### OSnews Accounts\n\n    * Create Account\n    * Login\n\n### Support OSnews\n\n    * OSnews Patreon\n    * Support OSnews\n\n### Featured articles\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n    * Setting up a YubiKey on Linux is a mess, and it really shouldn\u2019t be\n    * Fedora change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release to KDE Plasma\n\n### Topics\n\n### Related Posts\n\n    * FreeBSD Foundation Newsletter December\n\nDecember 27, 2006 \u2022 20 Comments\n\n    * FreeBSD 8.0 Beta 1 Released\n\nJuly 10, 2009 \u2022 12 Comments\n\n    * Fundraiser for FreeBSD Security Development\n\nMarch 30, 2006 \u2022 44 Comments\n\n    * FreeBSD 7.0 Beta 1 Released\n\nOctober 23, 2007 \u2022 25 Comments\n\n    * The Depenguinator Version 2.0\n\nJanuary 29, 2008 \u2022 30 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts\n\n    * Some personal news\n\nMarch 23, 2024 \u2022 69 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n\nApril 8, 2024 \u2022 46 Comments\n\n    * Hackintosh is (almost) dead\n\nMarch 17, 2024 \u2022 28 Comments\n\n    * Secure by design: Google\u2019s perspective on memory safety\n\nMarch 15, 2024 \u2022 34 Comments\n\n    * A deep dive into email deliverability in 2024\n\nApril 1, 2024 \u2022 34 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts (Last 3 Years)\n\n    * Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights\n\nOctober 18, 2021\n\n    * Microsoft is testing a desktop watermark for unsupported Windows 11 PCs\n\nFebruary 27, 2022\n\n    * Rant: year of Linux on the desktop\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\n    * A few thoughts on Fuchsia security\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\n    * Apple intentionally kills web applications for EU users in iOS 17.4 onward to spite its EU users\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\n### About OSnews\n\nOSnews Privacy Statement \u00a9 OSnews Inc.
