Human employees at\ncompanies like Sports Illustrated were fired by the barrelful by an\nincompetent extraction class. But AdVon Commerce appears to have faced\n\u201caccountability\u201d in the form of... a lucrative new cloud partnership with\nGoogle.\n\nGoogle, which has come under increased fire for doing an increasingly shitty\njob maintaining quality control in both search and Google news results,\napparently doesn\u2019t much want to talk about the partnership:\n\n> \u201cAdditionally, Google declined to dispute the accuracy of the release. The\n> search giant had been eager to talk to us when it announced the crackdown on\n> AI content in March, but when we reached out multiple times asking if the\n> partnership with AdVon was legit, we received nothing but silence.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s not clear how meaningful this partnership actually is. AdVon\u2019s press\nrelease says the deal involves AdVon\u2019s \u201cretail-focused AI tool,\u201d AdVonAI,\nbeing more tightly woven into Google Cloud Marketplace, using automation to\n\u201chelp customers quickly deploy, manage, and grow the solution on Google\nCloud.\u201d\n\nBut it remains curious all the same that a company at the heart of two major\njournalism AI scandals appears to be seeing no meaningful reputational impact\nfrom it. Including from one of the top companies responsible for maintaining\nquality control of our collective shared online reality.\n\nModerating these massive systems at scale is no easy feat. But it\u2019s confounded\nby the fact that companies like Google would much rather be spending time and\nresources on things that make them more money, instead of ensuring that\nexisting programs and systems actually work as advertised. When you\u2019re\nendlessly chasing impossible scale and growth, the financial incentives\ninherently de-prioritize quality.\n\nGoogle\u2019s failures here have been multi-fold. One, sloppy moderation of Google\nNews and search only helps contribute to an increasingly lopsided signal to\nnoise ratio as a dwindling number of under-funded actual journalists try to\nout-compete automated bullshit and well-funded propaganda mills across a\nbroken infotainment and engagement economy.\n\n404 Media, a promising new tech news venture built on the back of the Vice\ncollapse, can\u2019t even get its news stories indexed by Google. At the same time,\nthey\u2019ve been documenting in great detail the absolute flood of garbage\npolluting search and news and books results, redirecting revenues away from\noutlets and individuals doing quality research, reporting, and work.\n\nEd Zitron wisely put it this way in one of his recent newsletter posts:\n\n> \u201cGenerative AI also naturally aligns with the toxic incentives created by\n> the largest platforms. Google\u2019s algorithmic catering to the Search Engine\n> Optimization industry naturally benefits those who can spin up large amounts\n> of \u201crelevant\u201d content rather than content created by humans....because these\n> platforms were built to reward scale and volume far more often than quality,\n> AI naturally rewards those who can find the spammiest ways to manipulate the\n> algorithm.\u201d\n\nAs a telecom beat reporter I keep thinking back to AT&T\u2019s incentive to turn\nthe other cheek to scams, bullshit, and fraud that populated its networks and\nharmed its customers for decades. AT&T was paid whether the usage was\ncriminals ripping off the hearing impaired or legitimate, everyday use, so it\nwas never really incentivized to meaningfully engage in user protection and\nquality control.\n\nIn search, the impact has been a surge in AI obituary spam, automated SEO\nengagement garbage, propaganda, and assorted other gibberish. At the same\ntime, U.S. academia, journalism, and even library infrastructure finds itself\nunder relentless attack and defunding. Surely that won\u2019t result in broad,\nobvious, and completely avoidable (but none-the-less hugely problematic)\ncultural outcomes, right?\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of Google executive turnover of late, especially in search.\nYou\u2019d like to think that at least some of these hires realize the scope of the\ninformation quality crisis we\u2019re facing; and are capable of bucking at least\nsome of the twisted financial incentives pointing them in all the wrong\ndirections.\n\nFiled Under: ai, automation, brunchlords, fake journalists, journalism,\npropaganda, quality control, search Companies: advon commerce, google\n\n6 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * AI-Powered Fake Copyright Trolling Threat Letters Really Just An SEO Scam\n  * Meta\u2019s Dumb Deletion Of Links To Journalism Shows Why Attempts To Tax Platforms That Link To Journalism Is Even Dumber\n  * NYC Officials Are Mad Because Journalists Pointed Out The City's New 'AI' Chatbot Tells People To Break The Law\n  * Let Me Rewrite That For You: NY Times Misinforms Readers About RFK & Biden\n  * Cleveland Plain Dealer Editor Shows How To Cover Trump: Tell The Truth\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cCompany At Center Of Sports Illustrated, Gannett \u2018AI\u2019 Content\nScandals Continues To Fail Upward\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n6 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 11, 2024 at 5:58 am\n\n# \"Don't be evil\" is in the rear-view mirror\n\nGoogle Groups is such an enormous source of spam that most Usenet sites are\ndropping all articles from it.\n\nGmail has consistently been in the top 10 spam sources worldwide for the past\nfew years. Simultaneously, Gmail is discarding non-spam inbound traffic based\non whatever AI algorithm they have in place.\n\nGoogle\u2019s cloud is a constant, massive source of probes and attacks against\nservices like HTTP, FTP, POP, IMAP, SSH, RSYNC, etc.\n\nGoogle\u2019s cloud also hosts all kinds of abusive and criminal operations.\nThey\u2019re not as bad as the Nazi-lovers at Cloudflare, but that really isn\u2019t\nsaying much.\n\nGoogle staff don\u2019t read, don\u2019t respond to, and don\u2019t act on abuse\nreports...even though this is Operations 101, something that every system and\nnetwork admin learns in their first week of training. The quality of Google\nstaff continues to decline \u2013 they think they\u2019re the smartest people in the\nroom, but they\u2019re very definitely not. Not even close.\n\nThe bottom line is that Google doesn\u2019t care how much damage it does to the\nInternet or to society as long it profits. Google pretending to be concerned\nabout ethics is like (as I read elsewhere) ACME pretending to be concerned\nabout the coyote\u2019s wellbeing. It\u2019s a lie, and anyone at Google who claims\notherwise should be called on it.\n\nGoogle has no ethics. Not any more.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 11, 2024 at 6:00 am\n\n# Google changed their ways\n\nEarly on, Google ranked their listings by what they called \u201clink popularity\u201d.\n\nThe more sites linked to you, the higher they ranked you, because it was\nprobably a better site.\n\nThat made them the best search engine, and it fueled their immense growth.\n\nWant more traffic?

As I responded to a friend: I really hate the conflations they make in the... article??? Haidt seems to be advertising his book. While there are obviously problems, the biggest issue I take with this framing is that it more or less claims that the solution is: 1) Get rid of Social Media (especially TikTok) and 2) Get rid of smartphones 3) ??? 4) Profit (i.e. the kids will be alright and happiness will return). The danger here is ignoring that there are very real reasons why kids and americans in general are not happy.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yeah.

Skies were clear and the crowd was shouting in northern Vermont, though I could have done without the 11 hour car ride home.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yup! We're in Texas and ended up driving pretty far out to where it was predicted to be clearer and we had a great view.\n  * John Roddy: It's funny. I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Thursday  \n  \n---  \n05:27| Company At Center Of Sports Illustrated, Gannett 'AI' Content Scandals\nContinues To Fail Upward (6)  \n  \n## Wednesday  \n  \n19:35| Putin Orders Russian Tech Companies To Somehow Make Competitive Game\nConsole In 3 Months (24)  \n14:33| 30 States Considering 'Right To Repair' Reforms in 2024 (5)  \n12:30| Elon Claims Twitter\u2019s Traffic Is At An All-Time High Because He Can\u2019t\nBe Bothered To Understand The Misleading Data People Show Him (38)  \n10:57| Judge Tells Corrections Officers To 'Suck It Up' If They Can't Handle\nAn Endless Stream Of Executions (53)  \n10:54| Daily Deal: The Mastering Linux Development Bundle (0)  \n09:27| Hollywood Believes The Time Is Ripe To Bring Back SOPA (107)  \n05:29| Prison Telecom Monopolies & Michigan Counties Sued For Kickback Deals\nThat Banned In-Person Visits To Boost Phone And Video Revenues (22)  \n  \n## Tuesday  \n  \n19:46| How Copyright May Destroy Our Access To The World's Academic Knowledge\n(10)  \n15:41| Fifth Circuit: Never Mind Your Lying Eyes, These Cops Who Killed A\nWoman Deserve Immunity (38)  \n  \n##### More\n\n\u00d7\n\n## Email This Story\n\nThis feature is only available to registered users.
