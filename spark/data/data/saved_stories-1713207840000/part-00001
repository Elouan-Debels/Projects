down 1.20% in premarket deals at roughly 7:30 a.m. ET.\n  * \u201cAs we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,\u201d Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an internal memo obtained by CNBC.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * TSLA-5.65 (-3.30%)\n\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla, speaks with CNBC on May 16th, 2023.\n\nDavid A. Grogan | CNBC\n\nTesla will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce, according to a memo\nsent to employees by CEO Elon Musk.\n\nShares were down about 2% on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely\nimportant to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and\nincreasing productivity,\u201d Musk said in the memo obtained by CNBC.\n\n\u201cAs part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization\nand made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10%\nglobally,\u201d the memo said.\n\nTesla had 140,473 employees as of December 2023.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO5:0105:01\n\nTesla is going through a \u2018code red situation\u2019 right now, says Wedbush\u2019s Dan\nIves\n\nSquawk Box\n\nThe memo was first reported by tech publication Electrek.\n\nTesla shares have taken a bruising in recent months, down 31% year-to-date\namid waning demand for electric vehicles and stiffening competition from\nChinese automakers, which benefit from Beijing subsidies. One of these rivals,\nBYD, last year wrested Tesla\u2019s mantle to become the world\u2019s largest seller of\nEVs \u2014 and Musk has previously recognized that China, which is home to a large\nTesla plant, may also house the company\u2019s strongest competition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who are out there who think that the top 10 car\ncompanies are going to be Tesla followed by nine Chinese car companies. I\nthink they might not be wrong,\u201d Musk said in November.\n\nThe U.S. company earlier this month reported its first annual decline in\nvehicle deliveries since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted production\nextraneous of demand \u2014 first-quarter deliveries fell by 8.5% on the year to\n386,810 in the first quarter, with output down 1.7% from a year earlier and\n12.5% sequentially.\n\nSince then, the firm has also resorted to trimming the subscription price of\nits premium driver assistance system, the Full Self-Driving package, for U.S.\ncustomers \u2014 in a move sharply at odds with Musk\u2019s previous pledges that the\nFSD fee would only bulk up as Tesla bolsters the system\u2019s features and\nfunctionality.\n\nBut the squeeze on the company\u2019s operating margin \u2014 which came in at 8.2% in\nthe fourth quarter, down from the 16% for last year \u2014 remains, and Tesla has\nwarned investors to brace that vehicle volume growth this year \u201cmay be notably\nlower\u201d than the rate logged in 2023, noting it is \u201ccurrently between two major\ngrowth waves.\u201d\n\nLogistical challenges exacerbated Tesla\u2019s problems this year. The company\u2019s\ncomponent supply was a casualty of disruptions caused by Yemeni Houthi\nmaritime attacks in the Red Sea, while the automaker\u2019s gigafactory near\nBerlin, Germany, was forced to briefly suspend production due to a suspected\narson at a nearby electricity substation.\n\nTesla will post its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, April 23.\n\nHere\u2019s the full memo from Musk:\n\nOver the years, we have grown rapidly with multiple factories scaling around\nthe globe. With this rapid growth there has been duplication of roles and job\nfunctions in certain areas. As we prepare the company for our next phase of\ngrowth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for\ncost reductions and increasing productivity.\n\nAs part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and\nmade the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally.\nThere is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be\nlean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.\n\nI would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work over\nthe years. I\u2019m deeply grateful for your many contributions to our mission and\nwe wish you well in your future opportunities. It is very difficult to say\ngoodbye.\n\nFor those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult\njob that remains ahead. We are developing some of the most revolutionary\ntechnologies in auto, energy and artifiical intelligence. As we prepare the\ncompany for the next phase of growth, your resolve will make a huge difference\nin getting us there.\n\nThanks, Elon\n\nTV\n\nSquawk on the StreetWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Money Movers 11:00 am ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
