Actually, cow\nmagnets are very popular with farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians since they\nare a well-known method of preventing hardware disease in cattle. So what\u2019s\nhardware disease?\n\nCow Magnets\n\n## About Hardware Disease\n\nHardware disease is a common term for bovine traumatic reticulopericarditis.\nIt is usually caused by the ingestion of a sharp, metallic object. These\npieces of metal settle in the reticulum and can irritate or penetrate the\nlining. It is most common in dairy cattle but is occasionally seen in beef\ncattle. It is very rarely reported in any other ruminants. It can be difficult\nto conclusively diagnose but can be prevented by the oral administration of a\nmagnet around the time that the animal reaches the age of one year.\n\n## Causes of Hardware Disease\n\nCattle commonly swallow foreign objects, because they do not use their lips to\ndiscriminate between materials and they do not completely chew their feed\nbefore swallowing. Sharp metal objects (such as nails or iron wires) are a\ncommon cause of hardware diseases. The object travels into the rumen and is\nthen pushed into the reticulum along with the rest of the feed. In some cases,\ncontractions of the reticulum can push the object through part of the\nreticulum wall into the peritoneal cavity, where it causes severe\ninflammation. In rare cases, the metal object penetrates the entire wall of\nthe reticulum and can pierce the heart sac, causing pericarditis. Compression\nby the uterus in late pregnancy, straining during parturition, and mounting\nduring estrus can increase the likelihood of the object penetrating the\nabdominal wall or the heart sac.\n\n## How to prevent the hardware disease?\n\nA cow magnet is a kind of veterinary medical equipment used to treat or\nprevent hardware diseases of cattle. Traditionally, the cow magnets are strong\nAlnico magnets, in the shape of a smooth rod, about 1 cm by 8 cm (0.4 by 3.1\ninches). However, today they are more commonly several ring-shaped ferrite\nmagnets attached to a stainless-steel or plastic core, in the same shape as\nthe single-piece original.\n\nNewer designs to help increase effectiveness include a cage design, in which\nthe magnet holds metal objects inside a protective plastic framework. Even\nnewer designs include a stronger array of rare-earth magnets inside a\nstainless steel body that resembles the original Alnico design.\n\nA rancher or dairy farmer feeds a magnet to each calf at branding time; the\nmagnet settles in the rumen or reticulum and remains there for the life of the\nanimal. The magnet is administered after fasting the cow for 18\u201324 hours. This\nis most effective if done to the entire herd before the age of one.\n\nThe cow magnet attracts such objects and prevents them from becoming lodged in\nthe animal\u2019s tissue. While the resultant mass of iron remains in the cow\u2019s\nrumen as a pseudobezoar (an intentionally introduced bezoar), it does not\ncause the severe problems of hardware disease. Cow magnets cannot be passed\nthrough a cow\u2019s 4th bonivial meta-colon.\n\nCow magnets are widely available from veterinary, feed supply, and scientific\nsupply sources.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for reading our article and we hope it can help you to have a better\nunderstanding of the cow magnets.
