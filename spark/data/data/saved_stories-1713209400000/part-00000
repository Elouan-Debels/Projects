The right set of\ninformation enables us to show the right messages to the right people at the\nright time.\n\nIt\u2019s 2024, and we have multiple tools at our disposal to bring our visions to\nlife, and secure quick leads, conversions, and sales. Google has built a\nlucrative playground for digital marketers after decades of carefully\nconstructing a system of extracting valuable information from its widespread\nusers on one hand and monetizing it through digital marketers on the other\nhand.\n\nFor a long time, us digital marketers haven\u2019t had to do a lot of heavy lifting\nto reach that set of right people at the right time \u2013\u2013 we have indeed been\nspoiled.\n\nTechnology is our biggest hand-holder in making highly personalized levels of\ndigital marketing possible. When you see a highly personalized or retargeted\nad chasing you across multiple web pages and devices \u2013\u2013 probably from a shoe\nyou left behind in a shopping cart \u2013\u2013 it is the result of a vast system of\nobserving, tracking, and information passing. And it is all made possible with\nsomething called the third-party cookies.\n\nHowever, there are a ton of issues with these third-party cookies which have\nbeen operating at the price of privacy and the world has been reacting since a\nlong time. After being taken down by other browsers like Firefox and Safari,\nthey are now being phased out by marketers\u2019 favorite \u2013 Google Chrome.\n\nChrome stands for ~65% of the global browser traffic and, in January 2024, it\nstopped using third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users completely. This\nportion is expected to grow to 100% throughout the rest of the year.\n\nThis signals towards information loss (loss of audience context), requiring\ndigital marketers to look at newer ways of advertising and marketing. The\nmountains of information \u2013\u2013 sourced through Google \u2013\u2013 that\u2019s been the digital\nmarketer\u2019s dearest asset is slowly taking a hit, and it\u2019s the right time to\nrespond and adjust. Let\u2019s explore.\n\n  1. What are third-party cookies?\n\n    1. How Google\u2019s services fit into all this?\n  2. Why is Google phasing out third-party cookies?\n  3.

What to do as digital marketers?\n\n    1. Plan your journey from three to zero\n\n      1. First-party data\n      2. Zero-party data\n    2. Diversify advertising platforms\n\n      1. Social media platforms\n      2. Search engines\n      3. Programmatic advertising enabled platforms\n      4. Contextual advertising\n    3. Improve your content game\n    4. Directly engage with your customers\n    5. Embrace privacy-first analytics tools\n  6. Conclusion\n\n## What are third-party cookies?\n\nWhen you visit a website that uses third-party advertising or tracking\nservices (like Google Analytics) or has a third-party embed (like a YouTube\nvideo), they set a cookie (bits of tracking code) on your browser with a\nunique tracking ID.\n\nAs opposed to first-party cookies that track user interactions within the\nscope of the website domain itself and also provide a good user experience by\nremembering their sessions or their carts, third-party cookies have a much\nbroader scope.\n\nThird-party cookies uniquely attach themselves to each user, stay on their\nbrowser (Google Chrome, for example), and track them through other web pages\nthey visit. Whenever the user visits a new website that also employs code\nsnippets from the same advertising or analytics services, the cookie notes it\nand updates the user\u2019s \u2018profile\u2019.\n\nEventually, the said services are able to put pieces together and map a user\u2019s\nentire journey, understand their behaviors, and predict their future behaviors\nas well.\n\n### How Google\u2019s services fit into all this?\n\nConsider this: most of the domains on the web are tracked by Google, the most\nused web analytics platform belongs to Google, the sponsored ads are run by\nGoogle, and it all extends to other devices because of the vast network of\nAndroid, and Google\u2019s irreplaceable mobile apps.\n\nThis means that Google does a terrific job at tracking every single digital\nfootprint we make. It is almost impossible to not have interacted with either\nof these tools, whether directly or indirectly, and have had a third-party\ncookie implanted on our browser or device. This, in turn, enables \u201cuser\nprofiling\u201d, and a deep understanding and prediction of their behaviors.\n\nBy the way, Google is even trying to acquire Hubspot now. Guess the intent?\n\nSo this is how Google\u2019s tools for digital marketers \u2013\u2013 like Google Ads and\nGoogle Analytics \u2013\u2013 are so robust in nature. They even have a pretty accurate\nprediction of clickthrough rates on Google Ads, which is an important metric\nfor advertisers \u2013\u2013 something made possible with behavioral prediction. Because\nof such a robust infrastructure, digital marketers are able to run hyper-\ntargeted ads, improve content personalization, and get deep behavioral\ninsights for their audiences.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\n## Why is Google phasing out third-party cookies?\n\nShort answer: It\u2019s because of the privacy concerns arising around the web, and\nGoogle platforms receiving constant pressure from regulatory bodies to adopt\nmore privacy-friendly practices.\n\nRegulatory bodies like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA\n(California Consumer Privacy Act) work to protect individual privacy by\nregulating the collection, processing, and usage of personal information by\nonline businesses.\n\nLong answer: In 2020, Google announced that it\u2019s working towards making third-\nparty cookies obsolete. In late 2023, it announced that the phase-out has\nbegun with it testing the new changes with 1% of Chrome users. They\u2019re on\ntrack to phase it all out by the second half of 2024.\n\nSome quick background: This radical shift is the result of a larger movement\nagainst \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d. It is a concept that talks about incursive\nand unconsented tracking of people\u2019s personal experiences to be used as raw\nmaterials in creating behavioral data. This data gives an understanding of how\na certain set of people behave, and gives a fair prediction of their future\nbehaviors as well.\n\nThis insight is used to predict business outcomes better. In other words,\nGoogle has repeatedly proved to be monitoring and profiling users without\ntheir explicit knowledge and consent, and using the collected behavioral data\nto improve its advertising and other services for marketers \u2013\u2013 the only place,\namongst their suite of products, that they charge for their services.\n\nGoogle\u2019s extensive usage of third-party cookies has been one of the biggest\nenablers of surveillance capitalism. And the governments, regulatory bodies,\nas well as digital privacy advocates are demanding a safer internet space for\nall. Here\u2019s a quote from Google itself:\n\n> We\u2019re developing techniques to detect and mitigate covert tracking and\n> workarounds by launching new anti-fingerprinting measures to discourage\n> these kinds > of deceptive and intrusive techniques.\n>\n> ~ Said Google itself.\n\nHence, Google Chrome is pulling up its socks in an attempt to emerge as a more\nprivacy-friendly browsing space for everyone. Therefore, digital marketers are\nleft with no choice but to pull up their socks as well. And it has to be done\nnow.\n\n## What does this mean for digital marketers?\n\nIt means that it\u2019s time to change up the usual approach and step out of our\nset ways. Here are some quick pointers to note:\n\n### Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is not going anywhere\n\nYou\u2019ll only have to adjust to a more privacy-friendly approach. If you still\nwish to stick to Google, check out their Privacy Sandbox APIs for private\nadvertising.\n\n### The quality bar is rising higher\n\nLower dependance on hyper targeted and remarketing campaigns means a higher\npressure on standing out as a brand, and building stronger and sustainable\nrelationships with customers.\n\n### Reliance on inbound marketing is increasing\n\nWe\u2019ll need to lean more towards inbound marketing as it becomes crucial to\nattract customers through content they find valuable and brand values they\nfind relatable.\n\n## How to tackle this as digital marketers?\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that exponentially more and more users\nare becoming privacy-sensitive and aware and may not be very merry about any\nsorts of privacy-invasive techniques that a brand associates itself with.\n\nIn order to embrace and adjust according to the current paradigm shift, while\nkeeping a long-term and sustainable brand\u2019s perspective, there are a couple of\napproaches that are important to discuss.\n\n### Replacing potential evasion with customer-centricity\n\nAs privacy-invasive systems are being torn down, there\u2019s been a very clever\nshift to privacy-evasive systems. Take the examples of these initiatives:\n\n  * Unified ID 2.0: This initiative masks the personally identifiable information of browser-users and still claims to meet a marketer\u2019s audience targeting and remarketing needs, without much compromise.\n  * Federal Learning of Cohorts (FLoC): This initiative by Google aims to replace individual tracking with cohort based tracking. So individuals get blended with larger groups of thousands of people, and don\u2019t feel the pressure of having personally identifiable information tracked. We still don\u2019t know how this would be pulled off behind the scenes though.\n\nAs marketers, it could be tempting to simply adopt such initiatives because\nthey let us keep our existing advertising methods as is, but they still miss\nthe point of consumers wanting to not be tracked at all, and not shown\nincursive (creepy) advertisements at all.\n\nHaving said that, there may be some merit to such systems but it\u2019s yet to be\ndiscovered (or proved) \u2013\u2013 and that can only happen with time. Hence, our best\nsuggestion here would be to observe and learn the intricacies of such privacy-\nevasive systems first and apply them to your advertising requirements\nmindfully, if at all.\n\n### Replacing reaction with proaction\n\nEmbrace privacy by design. This is an approach that proactively and carefully\nintegrates privacy-friendly measures in all the marketing initiatives we\nundertake, and even the IT infrastructure our teams build to support a cloud\nproduct.\n\nBy actively integrating data protection measures, we can reduce the risk of\ndata breaches, and build stronger trust with customers, while automatically\nstaying compliant with regulations like the GDPR and CCPA.\n\nEnsure that customer data is handled with the utmost care and security while\nplanning for analytics, campaigns, targeting strategies, and other data\ncollection methods.\n\nPrioritize consent-based marketing practices, utilize first-party data more\neffectively, and transparently communicate how customer information is\ncollected, used, and protected.\n\nSuch proactive measures not only enhance customer trust and brand perceptions,\nbut also improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\n\n### Replacing KPI-prediction with visionary marketing\n\nBack to basics: Prediction arises from the need to know everything beforehand\nand to be able to choose the most ideal actions in order to guarantee success.\nWhereas, vision is about defining how one thinks things should be and taking\nthe most ideal actions in order to make it happen.\n\nThe overdependence on hyper targeted advertising stems from a structure of\nsurveillance capitalism that was created in the first place to ensure\npredictions and guarantees of certain business/marketing outcomes. The issue\nis, this is not sustainable at all because it comes at the price of humanity\u2019s\nprivacy; and when humanity notices, it doesn\u2019t let it thrive.\n\nSo actively rejecting such systems is more than a question of ethics \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s\npurely logical. The only other thing left to replace this inherent need of\npredicting outcomes is vision based marketing. In a nutshell, visionary\nmarketing is the type of marketing that serves as a careful extension of a\ncompany\u2019s mission and purpose, and embodies the vision that the company\nimagines for its customers.\n\nVisionary marketing doesn\u2019t end at competing for impressions and clicks on the\nweb, and generally takes the form of brand differentiation. The ideal\naspiration is to cultivate the company\u2019s vision so strongly that it can build\na devoted community\u2013\u2013a cult\u2013\u2013on the back of its marketing. If done right,\nvision not only guarantees success too, but also guarantees a timeless one.\n\n### Replacing privacy-invasion with psychographic-analysis\n\nPrivacy invasion means getting your hands on the facts that you wouldn\u2019t (and\nshouldn\u2019t) normally know, and psychoanalysis is observing facts that are\nopenly available but also looking underneath them and understanding the why\u2019s\nand how\u2019s of them.\n\nBoth of these approaches offer a fair prediction of how things would turn out,\nand both require a decent amount of hard work. But psychoanalysis is not only\nmore ethical, it also makes more sense because it helps us understand a\npeople\u2019s incentives, mindsets, motivations, values, dreams, likes, hopes,\nissues, fears, etc. This is much more powerful than demographic-based audience\nsegmentation.\n\nTry applying this framework to your target audience by applying simple methods\nlike observing their behaviors, surveying, or studying similar communities and\nhistorical patterns if any. This will help you draw some psychographics and\ncreate much deeper and valuable buyer personas and come up with much more\neffective marketing strategies.\n\nThis is highly capable of not only outshining intrusive marketing and\nadvertising tactics, but also outshining the generally understood online\nmarketing: a means of competing for maximum impressions and clicks.\n\n## What to do as digital marketers?\n\nThere are some things that we can actively do to ensure a smooth transition\nfrom reliance on third-party cookies to staying relevant within a cookieless\nweb.\n\n### Plan your journey from three to zero\n\nAs third-party cookies bid us goodbye, it\u2019s time to utilize more of first-\nparty and zero-party data.\n\n#### First-party data\n\nFirst-party data is data that is passively observed as users interact with the\nplatforms that only you control, like your website. If configured right, it\ndoesn\u2019t collect personally identifiable information from your web visitors.\n\nThis stays within the domain of your website, and does not follow the visitor\naround on Chrome, as and when they leave the website. It respects visitor\u2019s\nboundaries, and collects only the type of data that can be used to improve\nyour own website experience.\n\nSome examples of such first-party data are \u201cpageviews\u201d, \u201cscrolls\u201d, \u201coutbound\nclicks\u201d, \u201cbounce rates\u201d, \u201cvisit duration\u201d, \u201ctraffic sources\u201d, etc. that can be\ncollected via privacy-friendly website analytics tools.\n\n#### Zero-party data\n\nZero-party data is information that customers proactively and explicitly share\nwith a brand, such as email addresses, purchase intentions, communication\npreferences, content preferences, customization requests, product or service\nfeedback, etc.\n\nThis can come from carefully implementing information capture tools like\nforms, quizzes, surveys, polls, and through direct customer interactions with\nchatbots or demo and sales calls.\n\n### Diversify advertising platforms\n\nThe death of third-party cookies doesn\u2019t imply the death of online tracking \u2013\u2013\nit just makes it more restricted and ethical. Any advertising platform that\noperates within the purview of respecting user privacy is here to stay. Here\nare some of the platforms that you can utilize for advertising:\n\n#### Social media platforms\n\nThe social media platforms collect data directly from their users, making it\nfirst-party to the platforms. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,\nLinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, etc have vast amounts of first-party data, thanks\nto their logged-in user bases. This makes it effective for advertising, if you\nare looking to reach specific demographics or interest groups through your\nads.\n\n#### Search engines\n\nRegular search engine marketing and advertising, like Google Ads or Bing Ads,\ncontinue to stay functional. The fundamental aspects of search engine\nadvertising, like matching keyword types and bidding processes, remain core to\nthe platforms, and are not directly affected by Chrome\u2019s third-party phase\nout.\n\n#### Programmatic advertising enabled platforms\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the job that used to be done by third-party cookies is\ngetting replaced by research emerging identity solutions like the Unified ID\n2.0 and Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox initiatives. These initiatives are doing a\ngood job in staying compliant with regulations and are well-positioned for the\nnear future.\n\nYou should evaluate these alternatives, but tread carefully for they continue\nto be privacy-evasive and non-customer-friendly in nature. Unless there are\nsome fair-to-the-intent-of-privacy values for them, they are doomed to meet\nthe same end as that of third-party cookies as and when governments and\nprivacy advocates take notice of them.\n\n#### Contextual advertising\n\nThe good old contextual advertising is making a comeback. It primarily focuses\non the environment where the ad is placed, rather than the individual who is\nviewing the ad. With this strategy, you can target ads based on the content a\nuser is viewing. So invest in understanding your audience\u2019s interests and the\ncontent platforms they regularly visit.\n\nYou can find multiple platforms that help advertisers run ads based on\nkeywords, website themes, and the type of content users are currently viewing.\nThis strategy not only complies with privacy regulations but also ensures that\nads are relevant and engaging to the audience.\n\n### Improve your content game\n\nClaim expertise in the subject matter of the industry you are operating in, by\nemploying a content team to make high quality content. Also consider\nexperimenting with non-written content formats to reach your audiences in\neasily consumable ways.\n\nIn order to distribute your content, consider building your own, highly\ncontextual and customized, distribution channel. For example, you could create\nyour own community on Discord where you can bring together your customers and\nother stakeholders for highly relevant discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, strengthen your search engine optimization and search generative\nexperience efforts, to rely more on inbound marketing and building a solid\nbrand.\n\n### Directly engage with your customers\n\nYour customers are the one set of people that matters the most, whether they\nare the current ones or potential ones. Invest more time and resources in\nposting valuable content on social media, or creating email marketing or SMS\ncampaigns that nurture your relationship with existing subscribers.\n\n### Embrace privacy-first analytics tools\n\nChoose open-source and privacy-first analytics tools for understanding your\nwebsite traffic and engagement patterns. These tools, designed with privacy at\ntheir core, ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, and also\nmakes you future-proof and ready for other regulations that are expected to\ncome from other nations.\n\nThis ensures we can gather insights into user behavior and website performance\nwithout infringing on individual privacy rights.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBeing data-oriented and customer-centric as a marketer is extremely important.\nBut being able to do well with relatively limited amounts (fair amounts) of\ndata is even more important for staying customer-centric in the first place.\n\nAs marketers, we must ask better questions about what would create a\nsustainable brand, and build and protect customer trust like anything. We must\nrely more on relationships with customers and less on technology that offers\nshortcuts to short-term success.\n\nThis article was written by Hricha Shandily, an experienced digital marketer\nand founding marketer at a Y Combinator startup.\n\nWritten by Marko Saric\n\nHi!
