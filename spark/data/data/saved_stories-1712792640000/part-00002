This, the EU feared, kept users\nfrom switching to defaults that offered superior or more private web browsing\nexperiences.\n\nReuters collected data from six companies, confirming that, when presented\nwith a choice screen, many EU users will swap out default browsers like Chrome\nor Safari for more privacy-focused options. And because iPhones have a larger\nmarket share than Google-branded phones in the EU, Apple is emerging as the\nbiggest loser, Reuters reported, noting that under the DMA, \"the growth for\nsmaller browsers is currently coming at the cost of Safari.\"\n\nSome indie browsers are benefiting more than others from users shifting away\nfrom Safari. In the month since the DMA took effect on March 7, the Cyprus-\nbased Aloha Browser told Reuters that its total users in the EU spiked by 250\npercent in March. In Belgium, Aloha users increased threefold, Aloha said in a\npress release.\n\nAloha attracts about 10 million monthly average users globally by promising\n\"total privacy.\" The company profits from paid subscriptions to premium\nfeatures like \"advanced VPN and privacy-oriented AI,\" instead of from tracking\nusers for invasive ad-targeting, the press release said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAloha does not and has \"never collected, stored or monetized any user data of\nany kind, making Aloha the only major browser that does not receive any money\nfor user data,\" Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in the press release, adding\nthat \"we were not surprised to see this increase.\"\n\n\"By enacting these regulations, the EU has done two things: They've cut down\non some of big tech's monopolistic practices, and they've made consumers more\naware of their choices in the tools they can use online,\" Frost Moroz said.\n\"And many of those consumers are clearly saying they want to take back control\nof their digital privacy and personal data.\"\n\nAt least five other browsers have also benefited, Reuters reported, confirming\nthat Norway's Vivaldi and Opera, Germany's Ecosia, and US-based Brave and\nDuckDuckGo all reported increased users after the DMA took effect. Jan\nStandal, Opera's vice president, did not share specific numbers but said that\nOpera is experiencing \"record user numbers in the EU right now.\"\n\nWhile these numbers are encouraging for smaller browsers hoping to gain a\nlarger market share in the EU, some browser companies have criticized Apple\nand Google for \"slowing the migration of mobile users to new browser choices\"\nby rolling out \"slow and clunky\" updates, Reuters reported.\n\nVivaldi CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner directly criticized Apple's process\nfor swapping default browsers as \"just so convoluted that it's easiest for\n(users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name.\" The CEO told\nReuters that Apple only displayed the required choice screen\u2014currently\n\"curated for each of the 27 countries in the EU\" and \"showing up to 11\nbrowsers in addition to Safari\"\u2014when users clicked on Safari and said Apple\nfailed to provide useful information about alternative choices.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n55\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
