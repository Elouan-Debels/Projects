I've attempted this several times over her life, but this was\nthe first time it took, and the reason it took is because of AI.\n\nMany years ago I wrote a post about how I learned to code on the TRS-80, and\nhow much more accessible that introduction to coding was than what kids have\ntoday:\n\n> I\u2019ve been thinking about this stuff lately since we just celebrated our\n> daughter\u2019s first birthday. I\u2019d very much like to pass on the gift that my\n> parents gave to me, but can\u2019t help but feel sad at how much harder it is to\n> learn to program today.\n\nI cannot overstate how different the learn-to-code experience is because of\nthe AI assistance that's become available over the last 12 months.\n\nWe are using Cursor. Cursor is a VS Code fork that adds a bunch of different\nAI-assisted features. I'm just scratching the surface, but they include:\n\n  * integrated chat with GPT-4 so you don't have to tab over to a web-browser\n  * the chat has access to your entire code base as context\n  * fancy-autocomplete of code via Copilot++\n  * Press cmd-k from your code, describe in plain english for the code or refactoring you want to write, and it will take a swing at it with great accuracy\n  * \"Debug with AI\" - click a button from the integrated terminal to paste the stacktrace into the chat. You'll often get back things like, \"change line 63 to this....\"\n\nAll of these features drastically reduce friction and frustration and greatly\nincrease the instant gratification of learning to code.\n\nFor starters: no syntax errors. My friend Rob Spectre says of programming\nthat, \"the distance between looking/feeling like an idiot or genius is one\ncharacter wide.\" Many novice developers are scared away by the sheer amount of\nhead-banging-against-the wall that occurs when you lack the\nintuition/experience to get the characters to line up juuuuuust right.\n\nFancy autocomplete, chat, syntax highlighting and extensions like error lens\ncatch 95% of those errors before you run your code. It's so much more common\nfor the thing to just work the first time.\n\nEmma and I are building with the Claude API.\n\nIt's funny, she's actually spent a lot of time using the web-based versions of\nChatGPT and Claude. Specifically, she's using them to help her write a book,\nwhich now clocks in at ~180 pages. The app we're building lets her chat with\none of the characters \u2013 Lillis \u2013 from her book and go on adventures together\nthrough the world she's created. This actually was an app that I built about a\nyear ago, and last week Emma asked if we could recreate it on her computer.\n\nWhen we set out to build this app, I instinctively reached for OpenAI APIs\nbecause that's what I've used the most, and she quickly said, \"No, I want to\nuse Claude \u2013 it's better at writing.\"\n\n\"Oh... so you have opinions about LLM APIs already?\"\n\nLLM APIs are about the highest juice-to-squeeze ratio you'll ever get in\ncoding. It's an absolutely magical first-time-coding experience. The first\ntime I ever wrote code, back in 1986, I got back \"HELLO WORLD\" \u2013 and that was\nenough to hook me for life. Emma's getting back a passably human conversation\nwith a character crafted from her imagination.\n\nWe built simple Python script: a while loop takes an an input() from the user,\nfeeds it to Claude, prints the result. It's basically the Hello World with\nChatCompletion which I documented on this blog over a year ago, but with\nClaude swapped in for OpenAI. It's about 20 lines of code.\n\nCrucially, Emma's hands were on the keyboard 90% of the time (I did some setup\nlike the virtual environment and API keys). I sit next to her and tell her\nwhat to type, and fancy autocomplete takes care of all the spellings,\nindentations, punctuation, etc. Within ten minutes, we had our simple app up\nand running in the terminal.\n\nThis worked really well, but the conversation started over every time the\nprogram stopped. Lillis had no memory. I tell Emma to ask chat how she can\nsave the messages. It gives her a few sentences of strategy, and writes a few\nlines to save and load the messages to a JSON file.\n\nBoom, she just learned about file handling.\n\nNow the Python script is working, but she wants to make her app prettier than\ntyping in a terminal. Streamlit seems like the right choice to quickly move an\nLLM app to a web-based interface, but I haven't used it before and I struggle\nfor five minutes trying to steer from over her shoulder.\n\nThen I give up and say, \"just ask chat to change your app into a streamlit\napp.\"\n\nHer Streamlit app runs on the first try.\n\nWe've now gone from Hello World in the terminal to a well-styled web app with\npersistent memory in under an hour. My wife, Rachel, walks by.\n\n\"Mom, look, I made this. I MADE IT!\"\n\nI have no words to describe the joy and sense of accomplishment and\npossibility on her face, but if you're reading this, you probably have felt it\nyourself. She just discovered a new superpower that she didn't have an hour\nago. She can make anything she wants. The world looks different now.\n\nOf course, as soon as that app ran for the first time, Emma came up with a\npunchlist. \"Okay, I don't want it to say 'Chat with AI' at the top...\", etc.\nUnfortunately, it's time to put her younger sister to bed, so I tell Emma,\n\"I'll be back in a bit, just ask chat the questions you'd ask me.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, I exit the dark room, and find Emma waiting for me at\nthe door.\n\n\"DAD! I changed the font! I got it to work! It took six tries.\"\n\nThen, trying to come up with the words to express this experience that she's\nhad for the first time, of struggling and iterating against code solo and then\nfinally getting it to work, \"... it's not that I enjoyed doing it six times,\nbut the feeling I got after it worked was.... AMAZING!\"\n\nThere has never been a better time to learn how to code.\n\n#### Greg Baugues\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nHaiHai Labs \u00a9 2024.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
