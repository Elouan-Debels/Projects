Try firsthand experience. The author\nundergoes the controversial drowning technique, at the hands of men who once\ntrained American soldiers to resist\u2014not inflict\u2014it.\n\nBy Christopher Hitchens\n\nPhotography by Gasper Tringale\n\nJuly 2, 2008\n\nThe author catches his breath after undergoing his first waterboarding\nsession.\n\nHere is the most chilling way I can find of stating the matter. Until\nrecently, \u201cwaterboarding\u201d was something that Americans did to other Americans.\nIt was inflicted, and endured, by those members of the Special Forces who\nunderwent the advanced form of training known as SERE (Survival, Evasion,\nResistance, Escape). In these harsh exercises, brave men and women were\nintroduced to the sorts of barbarism that they might expect to meet at the\nhands of a lawless foe who disregarded the Geneva Conventions. But it was\nsomething that Americans were being trained to resist, not to inflict.\n\nExploring this narrow but deep distinction, on a gorgeous day last May I found\nmyself deep in the hill country of western North Carolina, preparing to be\nsurprised by a team of extremely hardened veterans who had confronted their\ncountry\u2019s enemies in highly arduous terrain all over the world. They knew\nabout everything from unarmed combat to enhanced interrogation and, in\nexchange for anonymity, were going to show me as nearly as possible what real\nwaterboarding might be like.\n\n### Hive\n\nWhere Wall Street, Washington, and Silicon Valley meet.\n\nIt goes without saying that I knew I could stop the process at any time, and\nthat when it was all over I would be released into happy daylight rather than\nreturned to a darkened cell. But it\u2019s been well said that cowards die many\ntimes before their deaths, and it was difficult for me to completely forget\nthe clause in the contract of indemnification that I had signed. This document\n(written by one who knew) stated revealingly:\n\n> \u201cWater boarding\u201d is a potentially dangerous activity in which the\n> participant can receive serious and permanent (physical, emotional and\n> psychological) injuries and even death, including injuries and death due to\n> the respiratory and neurological systems of the body.\n\nAs the agreement went on to say, there would be safeguards provided \u201cduring\nthe \u2018water boarding\u2019 process, however, these measures may fail and even if\nthey work properly they may not prevent Hitchens from experiencing serious\ninjury or death.\u201d\n\nOn the night before the encounter I got to sleep with what I thought was\ncreditable ease, but woke early and knew at once that I wasn\u2019t going back to\nany sort of doze or snooze. The first specialist I had approached with the\nscheme had asked my age on the telephone and when told what it was (I am 59)\nhad laughed out loud and told me to forget it. Waterboarding is for Green\nBerets in training, or wiry young jihadists whose teeth can bite through the\ngristle of an old goat. It\u2019s not for wheezing, paunchy scribblers. For my\ncurrent \u201chandlers\u201d I had had to produce a doctor\u2019s certificate assuring them\nthat I did not have asthma, but I wondered whether I should tell them about\nthe 15,000 cigarettes I had inhaled every year for the last several decades. I\nwas feeling apprehensive, in other words, and beginning to wish I hadn\u2019t given\nmyself so long to think about it.\n\nI have to be opaque about exactly where I was later that day, but there came a\nmoment when, sitting on a porch outside a remote house at the end of a winding\ncountry road, I was very gently yet firmly grabbed from behind, pulled to my\nfeet, pinioned by my wrists (which were then cuffed to a belt), and cut off\nfrom the sunlight by having a black hood pulled over my face. I was then\nturned around a few times, I presume to assist in disorienting me, and led\nover some crunchy gravel into a darkened room. Well, mainly darkened: there\nwere some oddly spaced bright lights that came as pinpoints through my hood.\nAnd some weird music assaulted my ears. (I\u2019m no judge of these things, but I\nwouldn\u2019t have expected former Special Forces types to be so fond of New Age\ntechno-disco.) The outside world seemed very suddenly very distant indeed.\n\nVideo: Watch Christopher Hitchens Get Waterboarded\n\nArms already lost to me, I wasn\u2019t able to flail as I was pushed onto a sloping\nboard and positioned with my head lower than my heart. (That\u2019s the main point:\nthe angle can be slight or steep.) Then my legs were lashed together so that\nthe board and I were one single and trussed unit. Not to bore you with my\nphobias, but if I don\u2019t have at least two pillows I wake up with acid reflux\nand mild sleep apnea, so even a merely supine position makes me uneasy. And,\nto tell you something I had been keeping from myself as well as from my new\nexperimental friends, I do have a fear of drowning that comes from a bad\nchildhood moment on the Isle of Wight, when I got out of my depth. As a boy\nreading the climactic torture scene of 1984, where what is in Room 101 is the\nworst thing in the world, I realize that somewhere in my version of that\nhideous chamber comes the moment when the wave washes over me. Not that that\nmakes me special: I don\u2019t know anyone who likes the idea of drowning. As\nmammals we may have originated in the ocean, but water has many ways of\nreminding us that when we are in it we are out of our element. In brief, when\nit comes to breathing, give me good old air every time.\n\nYou may have read by now the official lie about this treatment, which is that\nit \u201csimulates\u201d the feeling of drowning. This is not the case. You feel that\nyou are drowning because you are drowning\u2014or, rather, being drowned, albeit\nslowly and under controlled conditions and at the mercy (or otherwise) of\nthose who are applying the pressure. The \u201cboard\u201d is the instrument, not the\nmethod. You are not being boarded. You are being watered. This was very\nrapidly brought home to me when, on top of the hood, which still admitted a\nfew flashes of random and worrying strobe light to my vision, three layers of\nenveloping towel were added. In this pregnant darkness, head downward, I\nwaited for a while until I abruptly felt a slow cascade of water going up my\nnose. Determined to resist if only for the honor of my navy ancestors who had\nso often been in peril on the sea, I held my breath for a while and then had\nto exhale and\u2014as you might expect\u2014inhale in turn. The inhalation brought the\ndamp cloths tight against my nostrils, as if a huge, wet paw had been suddenly\nand annihilatingly clamped over my face. Unable to determine whether I was\nbreathing in or out, and flooded more with sheer panic than with mere water, I\ntriggered the pre-arranged signal and felt the unbelievable relief of being\npulled upright and having the soaking and stifling layers pulled off me. I\nfind I don\u2019t want to tell you how little time I lasted.\n\nThis is because I had read that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, invariably referred to\nas the \u201cmastermind\u201d of the atrocities of September 11, 2001, had impressed his\ninterrogators by holding out for upwards of two minutes before cracking. (By\nthe way, this story is not confirmed. My North Carolina friends jeered at it.\n\u201cHell,\u201d said one, \u201cfrom what I heard they only washed his damn face before he\nbabbled.\u201d) But, hell, I thought in my turn, no Hitchens is going to do worse\nthan that. Well, O.K., I admit I didn\u2019t outdo him. And so then I said, with\nslightly more bravado than was justified, that I\u2019d like to try it one more\ntime. There was a paramedic present who checked my racing pulse and warned me\nabout adrenaline rush. An interval was ordered, and then I felt the mask come\ndown again. Steeling myself to remember what it had been like last time, and\nto learn from the previous panic attack, I fought down the first, and some of\nthe second, wave of nausea and terror but soon found that I was an abject\nprisoner of my gag reflex. The interrogators would hardly have had time to ask\nme any questions, and I knew that I would quite readily have agreed to supply\nany answer. I still feel ashamed when I think about it. Also, in case it\u2019s of\ninterest, I have since woken up trying to push the bedcovers off my face, and\nif I do anything that makes me short of breath I find myself clawing at the\nair with a horrible sensation of smothering and claustrophobia. No doubt this\nwill pass. As if detecting my misery and shame, one of my interrogators\ncomfortingly said, \u201cAny time is a long time when you\u2019re breathing water.\u201d I\ncould have hugged him for saying so, and just then I was hit with a ghastly\nsense of the sadomasochistic dimension that underlies the relationship between\nthe torturer and the tortured. I apply the Abraham Lincoln test for moral\ncasuistry: \u201cIf slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\u201d Well, then, if\nwaterboarding does not constitute torture, then there is no such thing as\ntorture.\n\nHitchens is helped up after signaling for the waterboarding to stop.\n\nI am somewhat proud of my ability to \u201ckeep my head,\u201d as the saying goes, and\nto maintain presence of mind under trying circumstances. I was completely\nconvinced that, when the water pressure had become intolerable, I had firmly\nuttered the pre-determined code word that would cause it to cease. But my\ninterrogator told me that, rather to his surprise, I had not spoken a word. I\nhad activated the \u201cdead man\u2019s handle\u201d that signaled the onset of\nunconsciousness. So now I have to wonder about the role of false memory and\ndelusion. What I do recall clearly, though, is a hard finger feeling for my\nsolar plexus as the water was being poured. What was that for? \u201cThat\u2019s to find\nout if you are trying to cheat, and timing your breathing to the doses. If you\ntry that, we can outsmart you. We have all kinds of enhancements.\u201d I was\nbriefly embarrassed that I hadn\u2019t earned or warranted these refinements, but\nit hit me yet again that this is certainly the language of torture.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * J.K.

Among the veterans there are\nat least two views on all this, which means in practice that there are two\nopinions on whether or not \u201cwaterboarding\u201d constitutes torture. I have had\nsome extremely serious conversations on the topic, with two groups of highly\ndecent and serious men, and I think that both cases have to be stated at their\nstrongest.\n\nThe team who agreed to give me a hard time in the woods of North Carolina\nbelong to a highly honorable group. This group regards itself as out on the\nfront line in defense of a society that is too spoiled and too ungrateful to\nappreciate those solid, underpaid volunteers who guard us while we sleep.\nThese heroes stay on the ramparts at all hours and in all weather, and if they\nmake a mistake they may be arraigned in order to scratch some domestic\npolitical itch. Faced with appalling enemies who make horror videos of torture\nand beheadings, they feel that they are the ones who confront denunciation in\nour press, and possible prosecution. As they have just tried to demonstrate to\nme, a man who has been waterboarded may well emerge from the experience a bit\nshaky, but he is in a mood to surrender the relevant information and is\nunmarked and undamaged and indeed ready for another bout in quite a short\ntime. When contrasted to actual torture, waterboarding is more like foreplay.\nNo thumbscrew, no pincers, no electrodes, no rack. Can one say this of those\nwho have been captured by the tormentors and murderers of (say) Daniel Pearl?\nOn this analysis, any call to indict the United States for torture is\ntherefore a lame and diseased attempt to arrive at a moral equivalence between\nthose who defend civilization and those who exploit its freedoms to hollow it\nout, and ultimately to bring it down. I myself do not trust anybody who does\nnot clearly understand this viewpoint.\n\nAgainst it, however, I call as my main witness Mr. Malcolm Nance. Mr. Nance is\nnot what you call a bleeding heart. In fact, speaking of the coronary area, he\nhas said that, in battlefield conditions, he \u201cwould personally cut bin Laden\u2019s\nheart out with a plastic M.R.E. spoon.\u201d He was to the fore on September 11,\n2001, dealing with the burning nightmare in the debris of the Pentagon. He has\nbeen involved with the sere program since 1997. He speaks Arabic and has been\non al-Qaeda\u2019s tail since the early 1990s. His most recent book, The Terrorists\nof Iraq, is a highly potent analysis both of the jihadist threat in\nMesopotamia and of the ways in which we have made its life easier. I passed\none of the most dramatic evenings of my life listening to his cold but enraged\ndenunciation of the adoption of waterboarding by the United States. The\nargument goes like this:\n\n  1. Waterboarding is a deliberate torture technique and has been prosecuted as such by our judicial arm when perpetrated by others.\n\n  2. If we allow it and justify it, we cannot complain if it is employed in the future by other regimes on captive U.S. citizens. It is a method of putting American prisoners in harm\u2019s way.\n\n  3. It may be a means of extracting information, but it is also a means of extracting junk information. (Mr. Nance told me that he had heard of someone\u2019s being compelled to confess that he was a hermaphrodite. I later had an awful twinge while wondering if I myself could have been \u201cdunked\u201d this far.) To put it briefly, even the C.I.A. sources for the Washington Post story on waterboarding conceded that the information they got out of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was \u201cnot all of it reliable.\u201d Just put a pencil line under that last phrase, or commit it to memory.\n\n  4. It opens a door that cannot be closed. Once you have posed the notorious \u201cticking bomb\u201d question, and once you assume that you are in the right, what will you not do? Waterboarding not getting results fast enough? The terrorist\u2019s clock still ticking? Well, then, bring on the thumbscrews and the pincers and the electrodes and the rack.\n\nMasked by these arguments, there lurks another very penetrating point. Nance\ndoubts very much that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed lasted that long under the water\ntreatment (and I am pathetically pleased to hear it). It\u2019s also quite\nthinkable, if he did, that he was trying to attain martyrdom at our hands. But\neven if he endured so long, and since the United States has in any case\nbragged that in fact he did, one of our worst enemies has now become one of\nthe founders of something that will someday disturb your sleep as well as\nmine. To quote Nance:\n\n> Torture advocates hide behind the argument that an open discussion about\n> specific American interrogation techniques will aid the enemy. Yet,\n> convicted Al Qaeda members and innocent captives who were released to their\n> host nations have already debriefed the world through hundreds of\n> interviews, movies and documentaries on exactly what methods they were\n> subjected to and how they endured. Our own missteps have created a cadre of\n> highly experienced lecturers for Al Qaeda\u2019s own virtual SERE school for\n> terrorists.\n\nWhich returns us to my starting point, about the distinction between training\nfor something and training to resist it. One used to be told\u2014and surely with\ntruth\u2014that the lethal fanatics of al-Qaeda were schooled to lie, and\ninstructed to claim that they had been tortured and maltreated whether they\nhad been tortured and maltreated or not. Did we notice what a frontier we had\ncrossed when we admitted and even proclaimed that their stories might in fact\nbe true? I had only a very slight encounter on that frontier, but I still wish\nthat my experience were the only way in which the words \u201cwaterboard\u201d and\n\u201cAmerican\u201d could be mentioned in the same (gasping and sobbing) breath.\n\n## Photos: Remembering Christopher Hitchens, 1949\u20132011\n\n1 / 17\n\nHitchens joined Vanity Fair as a contributing editor in 1992. \u201cMy bet with\nGraydon [Carter, editor of V.F.] was essentially a simple one,\u201d he wrote in\nHitch-22. \u201cIn exchange for all this salary and all this freedom and all this\nexposure, he was to be able to ask me to write about, or to undergo, anything.\n...
