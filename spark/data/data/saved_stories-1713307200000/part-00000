I\nlike Tildes, and the discussions here are much more constructive than any\nother place I've seen, however I've seen it to be true even here. When one\ndoesn't curate their feed, and use the default home page, the negative topics\nseems to dominate. I'm talking about the topics that talk about problems and\nwhat's wrong with something, often with titles implying the awfulness or\nemergency of such a problem. I think I don't need to elaborate on how this is\nmuch more prevalent and extreme on other sites. But nevertheless, it's a\nrecurring pattern even here.\n\nI know the argument that goes that humans are problem-fixing machines, and\nthat there are psychological incentives to focus on problems. However, this\nseems overly reductive and lacking in explanatory power to me. Outside of\ninternet, this is not a phenomenon I've experienced with people, unless they\nwere mentally going through something very rough. Otherwise, people generally\nseem to talk about neutral or positive issues. And even while talking about\nnegative issues, the tone often isn't grim, and doesn't leave a depressive\naftertaste.\n\nEven on the internet, in smaller spaces and more closed spaces, like chatting\nservers, this doesn't seem to hold true. Sure, there are politically-oriented,\nand therefore problem-oriented spaces even there, but most spaces don't seem\nto be that way. Back when I used Facebook too, while the posts were vain, most\nof my friends and acquaintances were just interested in sharing and commenting\non social lives.\n\nSo I think this is a problem that is more endemic to \"open\" social media\nsites, with easily accessible and open-to-public spaces, rather than applying\nto the whole humanity or even every internet space. Its one of my biggest head\nscratchers about social media sites. So far I couldn't find a satisfactory\nexplanation in the literature either. Doesn't mean there isn't, but I haven't\nstumbled upon such.\n\nSo, I'm interested in your opinions: Why do negative topics dominate on open\nsocial media sites, even here, unless curated against? Why is this such a\nstrong recurring pattern for sites structured like this, while it's not in\nother online and physical spaces and interections I mentioned?\n\n## 51 comments\n\n  1.

It's much harder to offer a\nsolution that doesn't have its own problems and consequences.\n\nSo its easier to hold a default position of pessimism and just need to be able\nto maintain the position that bad things are happening than it is to hold a\nposition of optimism and have to justify that.\n\nI think the ubiquitous critique of Capitalism is an example of this. Most\nthings in society are in some way linked to the economy, and thus are linked\nin some way to Capitalism. So you can kind of go into any conversation where a\nproblem exists and point out that it is a product of Capitalism, and bam,\nsuddenly you've made a relevant and insightful contribution to the\nconversation that makes you seem clever.\n\nIt doesn't matter if I don't know anything about how farming works, I can\nstill say that there are problems with farming that are the fault of\nbillionaires and people on social media will probably agree with me without\nfurther explanation. Its a safe reliable way to always have something to say\nwithout really needing to be particularly knowledgeable any given topic.\n\n50 votes\n\n    1.

She hated all forms of it in stories, books, and media at\nthat age. As soon as two or more characters were in opposition, even to their\nenvironment, she would shut it off.\n\nSo we wrote the book Yesif. It is set six hundred years in the future, when a\ngirl wakes up and tells her family who live in a sea cave deep under the\nPacific Ocean that she is going to go visit her friend. So she rises up,\nriding the back of a sperm whale, making friends on land and in the clouds,\nbefore she is launched into space on a lightning bolt and sent to an orbital\naround Saturn.\n\nThe characters she meets along the way are so interesting in their own right\nand the journey is so grand that there is never the need for conflict to hold\nthe reader's attention or move the story along. Writing stories without\nconflict can easily be more than just 'a list of facts.'

Sometimes I feel stories are bland and unengaging\nprecisely because it feels like a paint by numbers narrative construction.\n\nLike, have you ever seen a show where there is some obvious romantic tension\nearly on, but then there is some very contrived misunderstanding that prevents\nthem from acknowledging their feelings until close to the end of the story? Do\nyou ever get frustrated because the conflict and tension feels arbitrary, so\nthere's not really much tension because you already know exactly how it's\ngoing to resolve in the end?\n\nI think there's a difference between having drama because you have written a\nstory about a scenario where people have an inherent conflict of values or\nopinion vs having drama because a story needs drama.\n\nPersonally I have really been enjoying slice of life stuff where there isn't\nmuch conflict, contrived or otherwise.\n\n5 votes\n\n      1. skybrian\n\nApril 8\n\nLink Parent\n\nYes, a story can be unsatisfying because you see the obvious solution and the\ncharacters don't see it, for what feel like contrived reasons.

Real life conversations are usually with the intent of setting\na good friendly atmosphere and we talk about things we can closely relate to.\n\nI am interested in hearing about my coworkers vacations, fun stories about\ntheir kids, and so on. With total strangers on the internet, such topics lack\na common reference point you can relate to. And while I don't mind such topics\nonline, we even have some casual threads dedocated to such things here on\nTildes, it will hardly be something that can spark long online discussions.\n\nIn online forums like this everyone writes several long paragraphs of text\nthey have usually thought a bit about. That is very different from casual real\nlife conversations with short sentences back and forth. A chat room is better\nat replicating the positive friendly vibe of real life conversations, whereas\nlong form online discussions is often about intellectual topics.\n\nStill there is plenty of opportunity for non pessimistic discussions.

The answer to what I'm talking about is not\nignoring any critical topic or conversation. That's why I framed the topic in\nterms of domination, rather than the mere existence of such topics. This kind\nof solution also puts the entire responsibility on the shoulders of the\ncritic, which is a very convenient way to dismiss such issues. It also reduces\nit to a simple issue of personal responsibility, which is never a solution to\ncommunal problems.\n\nI also think the framing of critical issues is also very important in terms of\nits emotional impact on people. Criticism is a tough issue, and I definitely\nagree that there can be overly destructive critical inclinations in some\ncommunities. But simply questioning things, asking people for feedback, trying\nto understand\u2014these are not an overly grim framing.

They have some wonderful things to say about how polite and\n> lovely the traffic, street and sidewalk, has been today. Jane?\n\nSo no, the news, life itself, doesn't appear to work that way.\n\nBut my comment is on your mention of fandom. That's not a source of positivity\neither. Star Wars and Marvel, for example, bring haters and doubters and\ndownplayers and outright assholes tumbling out of the woodwork to comment on\nit. And by comment I mean hate on. A new project, a new casting, a new script,\na new series, a rerelease ... whatever it is, you can almost set your watch by\nhow the thread will start to fill with \"yeah, but it sucks\" and \"sigh who\nasked for this\" and so on.\n\nSo even in fandom, people aren't willing to leave it alone if it's not their\ncup of happy. They just have to crowd in and shit on it, and usually take the\nnext obvious but obnoxious step of shitting on anyone who dares disagree with\ntheir shit and shitting. You never see Star Wars threads that look like this,\nfor example:\n\n> Star Wars isn't exactly my cup of happy, but I'm happy you Star Wars fans\n> fucking love it! Go you, and I hope you enjoy the new series/movie/release.\n> May the Force Be With You fans!\n\nNo, no one ever posts that. Why would they, when they can be negative instead.\nAnd not just negative, dismissive and insulting towards those who aren't also\nthose things.\n\nIs it attention seeking? Sometimes. Is it spreading their misery? Probably\nsometimes. Do they despise that someone else doesn't agree with their dislike?\nI think more often than not that's mixed in there somewhere.\n\nI said there's not a lot of research into negativity, but that's maybe not\nentirely accurate. Media, for example, has been running metrics and ratings\nfor many decades now. And since the Information Age hit, all that data has\ngotten both more plentiful and far more granular. Any digital feed of any\nkind, for example, can give data down to the second or the individual click.\nWebsites can track where your cursor is sometimes, how long before you clicked\naway, and more.\n\nThey use all this to figure out that the negative stuff is more engaging. So\nthey managed to validate their old maxims about shocking and enraging content\nbeing the most likely to grab and keep attention. Now it wasn't just\n\"conventional wisdom\" from the \"old hands\", but bespectacled data specialists\nspreading out reports and charts and graphs to prove it.\n\nSo ultimately, there's a human nature thing at play here. People ignore things\nwhen they're not pissed off. No one stops and says \"oh my God, I forgot to\npraise them, tell them good job, wow what a wonderful thing they're doing.\"\nBut few people forget to chime in with \"please fucking stop now, I hope you\ndie, you're wrong and evil and should suffer.\" Plenty of people will rearrange\ntheir attention span to shovel out negativity in all sorts of forms, where\nthey at best just kind of chuckle silently for a moment if things are\npositive.\n\nOne thing I'm reasonably sure of. Human nature is ... unlikely to change.\nPeople get pissed off if they have to move, or find new shoes, or when their\nfavorite restaurant closes and they have to take a chance on a new joint.\nTelling the entire planet \"hey, quit being negative or we'll ... keep\nreminding you until you remember\" doesn't seem likely to work out well.\n\nProbably there'd just be whole new movements of \"fuck the knock it off\nassholes; let us rage.\"\n\n8 votes\n\n      4.

I was fascinated by animals returning to a burning building they had just escaped to help free the other animals they could hear in distress. It was a while ago so I hope my memory is accurate.\n       * Something that helps me understand the world better, eg learning many years ago that in some cases imprisonment of convicts is actually a net negative to them and society.\n\nThese can be short form articles with simple language, just like the rage bait\nthat is so successful currently.\n\n5 votes\n\n  7.

The kind of sites I'm talking\nabout emotionally rewards people for getting clicks, and negatively framed\ntopics have a lower entry barrier. If I combine it with this comment's input,\nI think we can speculate that the mode of socialization is very different from\nday-to-day conversations, or online chatting spaces that are closer to more\n\"natural\" conversations. As a result, this kind of setting, unless\nspecifically curated or moderated, tends to get dominated by such issues.\n\nI think this tracks with some of the things I read in literature about\ncommunication on social media. A lot of them emphasized that the communication\nquality is poorer because of multiple reasons that make it different from\n\"natural\" communication modes. From what I gather, it's basically because the\nimpersonal and distant structure makes it hard for the brain to approach\nconversations as if they are made with real people, even though it's true, and\nthis leads to a lot of poor behavior. I think it's likely that this affects\nwhat we talk about too, maybe even dehumanizing us in the process.\n\nYour comment, and other comments, made me think more on the structure of such\nsites and its effects on communication. Some things are clearer now. Thanks\nfor the insight :)\n\n  8. lou\n\nApril 6 (edited April 6)\n\nLink\n\nSome communities are driven by debate.

There is often an attempt to\ndemonstrate that our points of view are the most truthful and correct. That is\ntrue about Tildes as well, even if most people make an attempt to defend their\nviews with civility and kindness.\n\nEven when entirely respectful, simply stating a fact may be interpreted as an\nattempt to debate. Because stating A is the same as stating some not B whether\nyou know it or not.\n\nOverwhelmingly positive content rarely leads to debate.

In negative experiences there are always things to dissect: I\ncould have done something differently, external forces could have been\ndifferent, someone else had a really negative impact on me. You can think\nabout and talk about all the things you could have or should have changed\nabout the senario. It's made for rehashing.\n\nExample: Positive - I went for a swim today and it was really nice. The water\nwas colder than normal but there weren't many waves and the visibility was\ngood. We swam to a mid distance spot, highfived, and returned to shore. It put\nme in a better mood and then I jumped into work. No real reason to think about\nit even though it'll have a lasting impact on my day. I probably won't even\nthink about or talk about it again.\n\nNegative - I went to the bank this afternoon and there was a huge line. I\ntried to get there at 11am but ended up hitting the lunch rush because I was\ndelayed by really bad traffic cause by road construction on the one roadway\nout of our small town. So now I have to wait 45 minutes to deposit a check,\nwhich if my landlord just used direct deposit or paypal or venmo I wouldn't\nhave to even do. But he's 92 so that won't happen. And when I got to the front\nof the line the bank teller was really short with me, probably because he was\ndealing with 8 other delayed, annoyed patrons. I've thought about everything I\ncould have changed - from when I left, to doing it yesterday - about the\nexternal factors - traffic on the main drag, other folks needing to be seen\nduring their lunch break - and things I'd like other to change - the attitude\nof my landlord towards tech, or the behavior of the teller. That's a lot to\ntalk about!!! And this is actually a real example. One of our neighbors even\nmade a salty instagram post about how annoying it was that there was\nconstruction on the main street out of town. Talk about engagement!\n\nOn an ideas front there is more to engage with in disagreement too. If I'm\ntalking about biking and the person I talk to says \"Oh, bikes are awesome!\"\nThen I'll get excited and we'll probably share a little about what we like,\nmaybe even high five, and at most make some plans to bike together! But likely\nwe'll just be like \"yeah, bikes are freakin sweet!\" But if they say \"Ug, I\nhate bikers. The get in the way and think they own the road.\" Well, now not\nonly do I feel personally attacked (though I probably shouldn't) but I think\nthey probably also advocate against things that I want. Here in our little\ntown we're trying to get new bike lanes painted in, but there is a lot of\npushback. So that statement isn't just a \"I disagree with you\", it becomes a\n\"I'm going to make sure you don't get what you want\". So I find myself trying\nto appeal to how difficult it is to feel safe when driving amongst cars, or\nhow fun biking is and how it's great for kids, or how good infrastructure can\nsolve their issues as well as mine so please still vote for the proposition\nfor an expanded bike path network. And then I get home and talk to my equally\nbike obsessed partner. If it's positive I'd probably just say \"I spoke with\nKathy and she's stoked on bikes too. She ride a sweet Surly Ogre, it's\nawesome!\" But if I've had a negative experience often I'll look for\nvalidation: \"I spoke with Kathy and she said some fucked up shit about\ncyclists! Man, here we are in little town that is perfect for cycling but\nnooooo... Kathy just needs her Bro-dozer to go get groceries! I mean what\nwe're advocating for would benefit her too, even if she isn't the one using\nthe lanes! I mean she says that cyclists are entitled but have you seen the\ndrivers?!?! I almost got hit twice on my ride home by people not looking\nturning right on red. And WE'RE the problem...\" continuing for an eternity...\n\nAnyway, that's my 2 cents.\n\nLog in\n\n## Topic info\n\nShort link\n\nComments\n\n    51 comments (15 threads)\nLast comment posted\n\n    April 8\n\n  * Docs\n  * Blog\n  * Contact\n  * Source code\n  * Planned features / All issues\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Terms of use\n\n", "frontpage": false}
