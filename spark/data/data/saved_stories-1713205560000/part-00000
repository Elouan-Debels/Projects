In this video compilation, the director talks\nabout how poor mental health inhibits art & creativity.\n\n> It stands to reason: the more you suffer, the less you want to create. If\n> you\u2019re truly depressed, they say you can\u2019t even get out of bed, let alone\n> create. It occupies the whole brain, poisons the artist, poisons the\n> environment; little room for creativity.\n\nOpen Culture has more on how Lynch uses transcendental meditation to improve\nhis mental health...and a great anecdote about the one time Lynch tried\ntherapy:\n\n> In one Charlie Rose interview, a clip from which appears in the video, he\n> even tells of the time he went to therapy. The beginning of this story makes\n> it in, but not the end: Lynch asked his new therapist \u201cstraight out, right\n> up front, \u2018Could this process that we\u2019re going to go through affect\n> creativity?\u2019 And he said, \u2018David, I have to be honest with you, it could\u201d \u2014\n> whereupon Lynch shook the man\u2019s hand and walked right back out the door.\n\n  * David Lynch\n  * video\n\nShare\n\n### Discussion\n\n\u00d7\n\nHello!
