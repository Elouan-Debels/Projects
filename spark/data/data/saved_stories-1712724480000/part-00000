We\u2019ve been delighted with the response that we\u2019ve seen from\nprospective participants, too: a record 135 proposals!\n\nAt the time of writing this blog post, I have reviewed and ranked every\nproposal. It seems very unlikely that we\u2019ll get as many slots as we want, but\neven two or three smart and talented GSoC participants will help us further\nour mission.\n\nHaving now completed my first year as a mentor and admin for a participating\norganization in this phase of GSoC, I wanted to offer some advice to students\nhoping to have their GSoC proposals accepted by our organization or any other\nparticipant. Hopefully my advice will help you stand out from the crowd!\n\n## Ask thoughtful questions\n\nBefore asking a question, spend a few minutes checking the project\u2019s website,\nsearch Slack, review GitHub/GitLab issues, and maybe even do a quick Find in\nFiles across the relevant codebase first, and tell the mentor up front what\nsteps you\u2019ve already taken before asking them for help. You don\u2019t need to\nspend hours on this process, but you should be able to demonstrate that you\nput in a good faith effort to answer the question for yourself. For instance:\n\n> Hi Aaron - I\u2019m trying to understand more about how Feature X should work so\n> that I can better prepare my proposal. I read the open issues on GitHub that\n> seem to relate to this, and learned about the previous attempts to build\n> this feature. However, I\u2019m still not clear on {ARCANE TECHNICAL ASPECT} of\n> the feature. Can you help me understand how this should work? Also, with\n> your permission, I\u2019ll add your description to the relevant issue on GitHub\n> so others know how this should work, too.\n\nRemember: the potential mentor you\u2019re conversing with is constantly asking\nthemselves: \u201cdo I want to spend 12 weeks answering this person\u2019s questions?\u201d\nMake sure that the answer is always \u201cyes!\u201d\n\n## Consider the organization\u2019s strategic priorities\n\nAsk yourself: what are the strategic priorities of the project that I want to\nwork on? What are the features I can add or bugs that I can fix that most\nalign with those priorities? If you can\u2019t come up with an answer, ask your\nprospective mentor to help answer this question for you. (Remember:\ndemonstrate you\u2019ve done the research before asking!) The GSoC mentor\norganization undoubtedly has more prospective participants than open slots, so\nmake sure the work you propose doing is maximally valuable.\n\n## Focus on projects that are getting less attention\n\nLook through the GSoC channel (or channels) on your mentor organization\u2019s\nSlack: which projects are getting the most attention? Ignore those! Your odds\nof being picked for a project with one or two other applicants are much better\nthan a project with ten or fifteen other applicants.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know which projects might qualify, feel free to ask! As a mentor,\nI would have been delighted if a student had asked me:\n\n> Aaron, I want to maximize my chances of getting accepted into GSoC, and so I\n> wanted to ask you which projects are most important to you, and which of\n> those are getting the least attention by prospective GSoC students right\n> now?\n\nYou can combine this with the last two points, too:\n\n> Aaron, I\u2019ve reviewed the example projects for OTSF and looked at the\n> relevant issue trackers for inspiration. I think projects X, Y, and Z are\n> the most important projects that I can work on, given my skillset. Which\n> project do you think is getting the least attention right now, and where\n> would I be most likely to get accepted?\n\n## Demonstrate your abilities\n\nThis year, I reviewed several proposals that were very detailed and sounded\nquite impressive, but they were ranked lower than other less impressive\nproject proposals because I couldn\u2019t find any evidence that the author could\nfulfill the expectations they set forth in their proposal. For example, if you\nwant to work on an Android project, demonstrate that you know something about\nAndroid: include links to GitHub projects in the target environment, and\nenough context in your proposal to suggest that you stand a good chance of\nbeing successful.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a project to point to, then consider volunteering on the\nproject that you want to work on for GSoC. In fact, you should do this anyway,\nas a good pull request will go a long way towards demonstrating your skills to\na potential mentor. Just remember that when you open a pull request, you are\n\u2018auditioning\u2019 for the role you want to have. Your prospective mentor will get\na very clear picture of whether they want to work with you for 12 weeks based\non what they see.\n\n## Ask for feedback on your proposal\n\nBefore submitting your proposal, be sure to reach out to your desired mentor\nto ask them to review the proposal. Take their feedback seriously, too. If\nyour desired mentor tells you that they won\u2019t support your proposal as\nwritten, then you should believe them and rework it. Furthermore, please take\nyour mentor\u2019s constructive criticism with good cheer. They\u2019re spending a lot\nof time on this process, too, and want your proposal to be as strong as it\npossibly can be.\n\n\u00a9 Aaron Brethorst\n\n", "frontpage": false}
