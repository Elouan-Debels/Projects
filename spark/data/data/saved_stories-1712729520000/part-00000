Also, booting without\nmounting the compressed boot volume launches the DriveSpace volume manager in\nthe same environment.

The first, which can run from the setup floppies and/or CD-ROM, uses a DOS program (DOSSETUP.BIN) to set up disk partitions, run various checks etc.:\n\nThis phases finishes by copying a minimal version of Windows 3.1 to the target\ninstallation drive, in a temporary directory (normally WININST0.400),\ncontaining DOSX.EXE, USER.EXE, GDI.EXE, KRNL386.EXE, LZEXPAND.DLL etc. (see\nMINI.CAB).\n\n  2. The second uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a Windows 3 program, W98SETUP.BIN (specified as the \u201cshell\u201d in SYSTEM.INI):\n\nThis starts by copying more files to support all the information-gathering\nduring setup, and various other niceties including the 3D look shown in your\nscreenshot (the contents of the PRECOPY CABs); it ends by copying most of\nWindows 98, setting the system up so that it will boot Windows 98 from the\ntarget drive, and rebooting.\n\n  3. The third runs after the first boot into Windows 98, from Windows 98:\n\nMany PCs with Windows 98 pre-installed were shipped in a variant of the state\nleft at the end of the second phase above; the third phase starts with a\n\u201cStarting Windows 98 for the first time\u201d message, and follows that up by\nasking the user for their name and company name. Thus PC buyers got a system\npre-installed, but ready to be personalised.\n\nYou can interrupt setup at any point, or inspect the image during installation\nin an emulator, to see what\u2019s present on the disk and thus determine the\nruntime environment.\n\nIt is also possible to initiate the setup process from any of the above\nenvironments, which is how Windows 98 handles upgrades (from MS-DOS, or\nWindows 3, or Windows 95).\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Aug 11, 2021 at 11:40\n\nanswered May 24, 2020 at 16:54\n\nStephen KittStephen Kitt\n\n122k1717 gold badges505505 silver badges463463 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been moved to chat.\n\n\u2013 Chenmunka \u2666\n\nMay 26, 2020 at 16:59\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n8\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nI haven't double-checked, but here's my understanding of how it works.\n\nThe first half of the installer is a DOS application, with all the limitations\ntherein and then, once it's installed a base Windows system, it boots into\nWindows to complete the process.\n\nThe DOS portion doesn't have access to Windows video drivers, so, judging by\nthe color scheme and resolution, it's faking a Windows UI via the same\nstandardized 640x480 16-color VGA mode that Windows 3.1's default video driver\nuses in order to look friendly and familiar.\n\nBasically the same approach Windows 3.1 and 3.11 used, except that they used\ntext mode for the DOS portion of their installers.\n\nEDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently it's a three-stage process with a minimal\nWindows 3.x system in between the text-mode and Windows 9x stages.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited May 27, 2020 at 18:06\n\nanswered May 24, 2020 at 14:46\n\nssokolowssokolow\n\n6,76622 gold badges2525 silver badges4242 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * I always assumed it was about the video drivers, but never had any knowledge about it\n\n\u2013 Quasi_Stomach\n\nMay 26, 2020 at 19:16\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n-4\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nBecause the setup doesn't contain either. These dialogues are just make to\nlook it alike regular ones. Keep in mind, it's a setup program, not a full\nfigured system. At that time, no (floppy) disk would hold a whole OS plus\nsetup plus whatever data.\n\nLets be serious, it was already a great step toward a more user friendly and\nconsistent experience than previous setup versions.
