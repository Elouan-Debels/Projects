Printed\ntowards the heel is a message that reads \"404 Error. The requested upper was\nnot found. Try again.\" The shoe also comes with an inverted tag on the tongue,\nwhite shoelaces with a matching white midsole, and is capped off with an icy\nblue outsole.\n\n.Swoosh members who sign up at Swoosh.Nike prior to April 19 will receive\nexclusive access to the \"404\" Air Force 1 release via SNKRS on the\naforementioned date for $150.
