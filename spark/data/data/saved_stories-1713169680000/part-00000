They met at the Trumpet tavern in London and\nat Water Oakley in the Berkshire countryside.\n\nThe first meetings were held at a tavern in Shire Lane (parallel with Bell\nYard and now covered by the Royal Courts of Justice) run by an innkeeper\ncalled Christopher Catt. He gave his name to the mutton pies known as \"Kit\nCats\" from which the name of the club is derived.\n\nThe club later moved to the Fountain Tavern on The Strand (now the site of\nSimpson's-in-the-Strand), and latterly into a room specially built for the\npurpose at Barn Elms, the home of the secretary Jacob Tonson.^[2] In summer,\nthe club met at the Upper Flask, Hampstead Heath.\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\nThe Trumpet, Shire Lane, Temple Bar, in 1778\n\nThe origin of the name \"Kit-Cat Club\" is unclear. In 1705 Thomas Hearne wrote:\n\"The Kit Cat Club got its name from Christopher Catling. [Note, a Pudding Pye\nman.]\" Other sources give his surname as Catt (or some variant such as Cat or\nKatt): John Timbs (\"Club Life of London\"), Ophelia Field (\"The Kit-Kat Club\"),\nJohn Macky (\"A Journey Through England\").\n\nA nickname for Christopher is \"Kit\". Christopher Catt was the keeper of a pie-\nhouse in Shire Lane, by Temple Bar, where the club originally met. His famous\nmutton pies (\"Kit-Kats\") were named after him, and formed a standing dish at\nmeetings of the club; the pie is thus itself sometimes regarded (e.g., by\nAddison in the Spectator) as the origin of the club's name.\n\nIt is possible that the club began at the end of the 17th century as the so-\ncalled \"Order of the Toast\". Indeed, a famous characteristic of the Kit-Kat\nwas its toasting glasses, used for drinking the health of the reigning\nbeauties of the day; verses in their praise were engraved on the glasses. If\nso, one can place the date before 1699, when Elkanah Settle wrote a poem \"To\nthe most renowned the President and the rest of the Knights of the most Noble\nOrder of the Toast.\" It was this very habit of \"toasting\" that led Dr.\nArbuthnot to produce the following epigram, which hints at yet another\npossible origin of the Club's name:^[3]\n\n> Whence deathless Kit-Kat took his name Few critics can unriddle Some say\n> from pastrycook it came And some from Cat and Fiddle. From no trim beaus its\n> name it boasts Grey statesmen or green wits But from the pell-mell pack of\n> toasts Of old Cats and young Kits.^[3]\n\n## Possible earlier objectives[edit]\n\nJohn Vanbrugh's modern biographer Kerry Downes suggests that the club's\norigins go back to before the Glorious Revolution of 1688; and that its\npolitical importance for the promotion of Whig objectives was greater before\nit became known. Those objectives were a strong Parliament, a limited\nmonarchy, resistance to France, and the Protestant succession to the throne.\nDownes cites John Oldmixon, who knew many of those involved, and who wrote in\n1735 of how some club members \"before the Revolution [of 1688] met frequently\nin the Evening at a Tavern, near Temple Bar, to unbend themselves after\nBusiness, and have a little free and cheerful Conversation in those dangerous\nTimes\". Horace Walpole, son of Kit-Cat Robert Walpole, refers to the\nrespectable middle-aged 18th-century Kit-Cat club as \"generally mentioned as a\nset of wits, in reality the patriots that saved Britain\".\n\n## Prominent members[edit]\n\nAmongst the club's membership were writers such as William Congreve, John\nLocke, Sir John Vanbrugh, and Joseph Addison, and politicians including Duke\nof Somerset, the Earl of Burlington, Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, The Earl of\nStanhope, Viscount Cobham, Abraham Stanyan and Sir Robert Walpole.\n\nOther notables included Samuel Garth, Charles Dartiquenave, Count Saint\nGermain, Richard Steele, and the Dukes of Grafton, Devonshire, Kingston,\nRichmond, Manchester, Dorset, and Lords Sunderland and Wharton. Of some\nnotoriety were Lord Mohun and the Earl of Berkeley. The artist Sir Godfrey\nKneller was also a member, his 48 portraits in a standard \"kit-cat\" format of\n36 by 28 inches, painted over more than twenty years, form the most complete\nknown members list of the club. Many of these portraits currently hang in\ngalleries created in a partnership between the National Portrait Gallery and\nthe National Trust at Beningbrough Hall in North Yorkshire.^[4]\n\n## Toasts[edit]\n\nThe toasts of the Kit-Kat Club were famous at the time, and were drunk to the\nhonour of a reigning beauty, or lady to whom the Club wished to do particular\nhonour. We know by name some of those who were toasted: Lady Mary Wortley\nMontagu; Lady Godolphin, Lady Sunderland, Lady Bridgewater, and Lady\nMonthermer, all daughters of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, except\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu who was the daughter of Evelyn Pierrepont, 5th Earl\nof Kingston-upon-Hull and only 7 years old when toasted;^[5] the Duchess of\nBolton, the Duchess of Beaufort, the Duchess of St Albans; Anne Long, a\ndaughter of Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet and friend of Jonathan Swift;\nCatherine Barton, Newton's niece and Charles Montagu's mistress; Mrs.\nBrudenell and Lady Wharton, Lady Carlisle and Mrs. Kirk and Mademoiselle\nSpanheim, among them. Those toasted had their names engraved on a glass\ngoblet.^[5]\n\n## Notable members[edit]\n\n  * Joseph Addison\n  * James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley\n  * Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington\n  * Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham\n  * William Congreve\n  * Charles Dartiquenave\n  * William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire\n  * Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset\n  * Samuel Garth\n  * Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton\n  * Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull\n  * Godfrey Kneller\n  * Charles Montagu, 1st Duke of Manchester\n  * Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun of Okehampton\n  * Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle\n  * Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond\n  * Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset\n  * Count of St. Germain\n  * James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope\n  * Abraham Stanyan\n  * Richard Steele\n  * Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland\n  * John Vanbrugh\n  * Robert Walpole\n  * Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * The Scriblerian and the Kit-Cats\n\n## References and sources[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n  1. ^ Timbs, John (1872), \"The Kit-Kat Club\", Clubs and club life in London, London: John Camden Hotten, pp. 47\u201353\n  2. ^ Greater London.
