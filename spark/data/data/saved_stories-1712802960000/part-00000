Have you ever found yourself stuck, not knowing\nthe right bash command to use? With Chai, you can simply run chai [your query\nin English], and it will respond with the appropriate bash command to help you\nout.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe command-line interface can be intimidating, especially for beginners.\nRemembering the syntax of various bash commands and knowing which command to\nuse in a specific situation can be challenging. Searching through\ndocumentation or forums for the right command can be time-consuming and\nfrustrating. Chai aims to solve this problem by providing an intuitive\ninterface where you can ask for help in plain English and get the correct bash\ncommand instantly.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Natural Language Interface: Communicate with Chai in plain English, just like asking a question.\n  * Instant Responses: Receive the correct bash command immediately after asking your query.\n  * Saves Time: Eliminates the need to search through documentation or forums for the right command.\n  * Easy to Use: Intuitive and straightforward interface, suitable for both beginners and experienced users.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use Chai, simply run the following command in your terminal:\n\n    \n    \n    chai [your query in English]\n\nChai will process your query and respond with the appropriate bash command.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install Chai via pip:\n\n    \n    \n    pip install chai-cli\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some examples of queries you can ask Chai:\n\n  * \"list all files starting with a\"\n  * \"grep emails.txt for yahoo addresses\"\n  * \"list users who are logged in\"\n\nChai will provide you with the corresponding bash commands for each query.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to Chai are welcome!
