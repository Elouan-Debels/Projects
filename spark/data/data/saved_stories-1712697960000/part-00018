Lockheed Martin, which is profiting directly from Israel\u2019s genocide,\nreceived $249 from the average taxpayer, more than the typical weekly food\nexpenses for an American household, the report found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that the average taxpayer is giving the equivalent of a\nmonth\u2019s rent to Pentagon contractors,\u201d said National Priorities Project\nProgram Director Lindsay Koshgarian. \u201cThese big corporations are already not\npaying their fair share in taxes. Instead, ordinary people are subsidizing\nthose corporations\u2019 profits and multi-million dollar CEO pay packages.\u201d\n\nThe report found that the average taxpayer shelled out more for militarism\nthan Medicare, public education, food stamps and other programs like renewable\nenergy projects combined, the report found. Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 which\nprovide health care coverage for tens of millions of people in the U.S. \u2014 saw\n$4,308 in the average taxpayer\u2019s contribution in 2023, while education saw\nonly $346, food stamps saw $516, the child tax credit saw $110 and renewable\nenergy and energy efficiency programs only got $10.84.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nWar & Peace\n\n## Report: US Has Secretly Sent Israel Over 100 Weapons Shipments in Last 150\nDays\n\nThis amounts to one arms shipment every 1.5 days.\n\nBy\n\n    Sharon Zhang ,\n    Truthout\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nBy contrast, the average taxpayer paid more to fund Israel\u2019s military than\nthey did energy efficiency programs in 2023, costing $14.58 on average \u2014 more\nthan double the federal minimum wage. Even Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, which has\ncontracts with NASA and the Pentagon, received more than such climate programs\ndid, pocketing $12 of the average Americans\u2019 taxes.\n\nAs affordability has plummeted and Americans struggle to afford basics like\nshelter, food, utilities and emergencies, hundreds of billions of dollars that\nlawmakers have dedicated to U.S. militarism went toward increasing\nsurveillance and police repression of Americans. It also went toward fueling\neconomic, environmental and political instability across the world, helping to\ncreate one of the most volatile moments for the Middle East in modern times.\n\nThis includes funding and support for Israel\u2019s genocide of Gaza, in which over\n33,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including over 13,000 children,\nwith over a million people on the brink of or already experiencing famine due\nto Israel\u2019s starvation campaign.\n\nTaxpayers have been helping to fund the genocide despite the majority of\nAmericans disapproving of Israel\u2019s military actions and the U.S.\u2019s support of\nIsraeli forces, as well as the use of taxpayer money for Israel\u2019s military\nincursions likely being against U.S. law, experts have said.\n\n\u201cThe average taxpayer contributed $112 to foreign militaries in 2023,\nincluding $14 for the Israeli military. Those tax dollars have directly\nsupported the Israeli military\u2019s destruction of Gaza,\u201d Koshgarian said in a\nstatement to Truthout. \u201cThere are clear actions the administration can take to\nmake sure that our tax dollars stop supporting genocidal actions in Gaza.\nThose include immediately stopping the flow of U.S. weapons to Israel, and\nreinstating aid to UNRWA.\u201d\n\nDespite declining affordability for the average American, however, the U.S.\ncontinues to increase its already sky-high budget for the Pentagon and\nmilitarization year over year. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.1 trillion\nin funding for militarism programs for the 2025 fiscal year, including $850\nbillion for the Pentagon.\n\n##### Tired of reading the same old news from the same old sources?\n\nSo are we!
