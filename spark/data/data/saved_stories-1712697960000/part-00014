His work started as a\ngraduate student when the team he was on inserted a firefly gene into a\ntobacco plant.\n\nIt was a small plant and couldn't sustain light without the addition of a\nsubstrate. It wasn't something a consumer would buy, but it was good for\nunderstanding pathways within an organism.\n\nNow, about 40 years after that first plant, Wood and his company in Ketchum,\nLight Bio, are marketing a garden petunia with a twist: it glows in the dark.\n\n\"People don't think about science as just bringing joy to our lives,\" Wood\nsaid, \"We thought we could do something really special here. We could create a\nkind of decorative plant that was really just enjoyment, just bringing a kind\nof magic into our lives.\"\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nScientist Keith Wood stands in his Ketchum home with a photo of a tobacco\nplant modified with a firefly gene Sasa Woodruff/Boise State Public Radio hide\ncaption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nSasa Woodruff/Boise State Public Radio\n\nScientist Keith Wood stands in his Ketchum home with a photo of a tobacco\nplant modified with a firefly gene\n\nSasa Woodruff/Boise State Public Radio\n\nThe petunia with bright, white flowers looks like something you'd buy in\nspring at a garden nursery. But, when the lights are turned out, the petals\nslowly start lighting up with a greenish, white glow. The plant is always\nglowing, it's just our eyes that need to adjust to see the light. The newest\nbuds are the brightest and punctuate the glowing flowers.\n\n\"That's why we call it the Firefly Petunia. Because these bright buds resemble\nfireflies sitting on top of the plant.,\" Wood explained.\n\nAnd despite its name, this plant doesn't have any firefly genes, rather four\ngenes from a bioluminescent mushroom and a fifth from a fungi.\n\n\"The first gene takes a metabolite and turns it into an intermediate,\" Wood\nexplained, \"The second gene takes the intermediate and turns it into the\nactual fuel for the bioluminescence. The third gene is what actually makes the\nlight. And then the last gene takes the product from the light reaction and\nrecycles it back to the starting point.\"\n\nThis cycle is self-sustaining, which means it shines brightly and doesn't need\nan extra chemical like the tobacco plant did to light up.\n\n\"The [firefly] gene was functional, but it didn't connect seamlessly into the\nnatural metabolic processes,\" Wood said.\n\n\"You've got glow, but it was a weak glow. Not satisfying at all.\"\n\n### Petunia approval paperwork\n\nIt took about 10 years to go from development to approval from the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture last fall.\n\nThe plants went on sale online in February and the first ones were shipped out\nthis week.\n\nDiane Blazek, the executive director of the National Garden Bureau, an\neducational nonprofit, says customers are always looking for the next new\nplant and petunias are a guaranteed bestseller.\n\n\"Grandma grew petunias, but oh, look, now I've got a petunia that glows in the\ndark. So, this is really cool,\" Blazek said.\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nThe Firefly Petunia emanates light because it's been modified with genes from\na bioluminescent mushroom Sasa Woodruff/Boise State Public Radio hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nSasa Woodruff/Boise State Public Radio\n\nThe Firefly Petunia emanates light because it's been modified with genes from\na bioluminescent mushroom\n\nSasa Woodruff/Boise State Public Radio\n\nShe doesn't think that the fact that it's genetically modified will affect\ncustomers buying it because there's a precedent.\n\nSeven years ago, an orange petunia modified with a maize gene showed up in\ngardens and nurseries in Europe and the U.S. The plant was never supposed to\nleave a closed lab but somehow ended up in lots of gardens. Regulators\neventually asked people to destroy the plants and seeds.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly, the response was, wait a minute, it's a petunia. We're not\neating it. The orange gene came from maize. Why? Why can't we plant this?\"\nBlazek remembered.\n\nEventually, regulators approved the plants in the U.S.\n\nChris Beytes, at Ball Publishing, who oversees several horticulture\npublications, said the Firefly Petunia could open up gardening to new\ncustomers.\n\n\"If you buy your first plant because it glows in the dark or it's dyed pink,\nyour second and third and 100th plant may be the traditional stuff. You never\nknow,\" Beytes said. \"Anything that creates excitement around flowers and\nplants. I'm all for it.\"\n\nThe Firefly Petunia may not have practical implications for things like drug\nadvances or crop production, but for Wood this petunia is transcendent.\n\n\"There's something magical about seeing this living presence, this glowing\nvitality coming from a living plant that in person gives a kind of magical\nexperience that you just can't see in a photograph.\n\nAnd this summer, that magic could be sitting on the patio watching your garden\nglow from the light of a petunia.\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 157 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
