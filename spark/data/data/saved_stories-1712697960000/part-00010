They serve multiple functions, enhancing user experience by\nenabling features like personalised settings, shopping carts, and analytics\ntracking. Cookies play a critical role in modern web architecture by\nfacilitating a more dynamic, responsive, and user-centric web experience.\n\nCookies track user behaviour and preferences by storing unique identifiers or\ntokens that can be accessed by the web server upon subsequent visits. This\nmechanism allows websites to recognise repeat users, gather analytics data,\nand offer a personalised user experience. The tracking is designed to enhance\nwebsite functionality and provide valuable insights for continuous\nimprovement, all while maintaining a high standard of data privacy and\nsecurity.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation\naimed at protecting the privacy and personal data of EU citizens. It applies\nto any website or organisation that processes data of individuals within the\nEU, regardless of where the organisation is based.\n\nUsing our tool to scan cookies on a website offers several advantages. It\nprovides a comprehensive inventory of all cookies and tracking technologies\ndeployed on the site, helping you maintain compliance with privacy regulations\nlike the GDPR. The scan identifies both first-party and third-party cookies,\nrevealing any potential data privacy risks. This enables a more transparent\nuser experience by allowing you to inform visitors accurately about the data\nbeing collected. Additionally, periodic scans can aid in auditing and updating\nyour cookie policy, ensuring it remains up-to-date with evolving privacy\nnorms.\n\nChecking cookies on your website is crucial for several reasons. Primarily, it\nhelps you remain compliant with privacy regulations like the GDPR, which\nmandates clear disclosure and user consent for non-essential cookies.\nUnderstanding the cookies deployed allows you to provide accurate information\nto visitors, building trust and transparency. It also enables you to identify\nany third-party cookies that might present data security or privacy risks.\nRegular audits of your cookies can help you optimise website performance and\nenhance the user experience by removing redundant or outdated cookies.\n\nThe tool will identify all cookies and instances of local storage and attempt\nto categorise cookies and trackers into three key groups. These groups are\nanalytics, advertising and functional.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward.
