In 2004, it began with a startling truth; only 2%\nof women globally considered themselves beautiful. Since then, Dove has been\ndedicated to taking action to make a positive experience with beauty\naccessible to everyone by challenging society, media and the beauty industry\nitself to widen its representation, be transparent about digital distortion,\nand face-up to the harmful impact unrealistic beauty standards have on women\nand girls.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nDOVE MARKS 20 YEARS OF REAL BEAUTY WITH A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO 'REAL' AND\nPLEDGE TO NEVER USE AI TO REPRESENT REAL WOMEN IN ITS ADVERTISING (CNW\nGroup/Dove Canada)\n\nTo mark 20 years of championing real beauty, Dove conducted a new sweeping\nstudy to understand the state of beauty around the world today. While there\nhas been some positive change, the state of beauty in 2024 isn't pretty.\n\nThe outsized value society places on appearance has intensified the pressure\nto be a certain type of beautiful. In its 2024 The Real State of Beauty: a\nglobal report, Dove found that 4 in 10 women (42%) in Canada would give up at\nleast a year of their life to achieve their beauty ideals. The study shows\nthat in Canada, while beauty ideals have evolved over the years to be more\ninclusive across race, orientation, gender and size, the checklist of\nappearance ideals is growing and impossible to meet \u2013 from looking healthy\n(81%) to also being slim (74%) and having a small waist (71%) while also being\ncurvy (57%).\n\nIn fact, 2 in 3 women (64%) in Canada believe that women today are expected to\nbe more physically attractive than their mother's generation was. As society\nand technology progresses, pressures to look a certain way are coming from all\nfronts.\n\nToday, almost 8 in 10 Canadian women (84%) and girls (87%) say they have been\nexposed to harmful beauty content on social media. One of the biggest threats\nto the representation of real beauty is Artificial Intelligence. With 90% of\nthe content online expected to be AI-generated by 2025, the rise of AI is a\nthreat to women's wellbeing, with 2 in 5 women (43%) and girls (43%) feeling\npressure to alter their appearance because of what they see online, even when\nthey know it's fake or AI generated.\n\nWhile AI has the potential to foster creativity and access to beauty, almost\nhalf of women (48%) and girls (51%) feel they can create different versions of\nthemselves using AI and avatars in video games/VR but believe it can have a\nnegative impact on how they view themselves. Demonstrating that , there is\nstill an urgent need for greater representation and transparency in content\ncreated by AI.\n\n\"Despite 20 years of work to broaden definitions of beauty, women feel less\nconfident in their own beauty than they did a decade ago,\" explains Dr.\nPhillippa Diedrichs, Research Psychologist at the Centre of Appearance\nResearch at the University of West England and body image expert.\n\"Representation is more important than ever. As AI technology continues to\nevolve, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between what is\nreal beauty and what is manufactured by AI.\"\n\nToday, women and girls overwhelmingly agree that real beauty means being\nauthentic, who you are, and embracing our differences.\n\nIn line with the last two decades, Dove will continue taking action to\ndismantle toxic beauty standards until beauty is a source of happiness and\nconfidence, not anxiety, for everyone. Dove will continue to stand for \"real,\"\nand champion transparency and diversity in beauty by becoming the first beauty\nbrand to commit to never using AI in place of real people in its advertising.\n\nTo help set new digital standards of representation, Dove has created the Real\nBeauty Prompt Guidelines - easy to use guidance on how to create images that\nare more representative of Real Beauty on the most popular generative AI\nprograms, for anyone that chooses to explore this new technology.\n\n\"At Dove, we seek a future in which women get to decide and declare what real\nbeauty looks like \u2013 not algorithms. As we navigate the opportunities and\nchallenges that come with new and emerging technology, we remain committed to\nprotect, celebrate, and champion Real Beauty. Pledging to never use AI in our\ncommunications is just one step. We will not stop until beauty is a source of\nhappiness, not anxiety, for every woman and girl,\" explains Alessandro\nManfredi, Chief Marketing Officer, Dove\n\nNew Dove campaign, The Code, reflects the impact of AI on beauty and sheds\nlight on the importance of women having the power to see real beauty reflected\nin new and emerging media.\n\nThe campaign will also be supported by an inspiring cast of empowering women\nacross generations - musician and actor Reba McEntire, actor and TV host Drew\nBarrymore, actor Beanie Feldstwin Feldstein and actor Marsai Martin, to name a\nfew - who will lend their voices and stories to raise awareness and celebrate\nreal beauty.\n\nThe work Dove began in 2004 is far from over. Dove will never stop championing\nbetter representation, taking action to break beauty stereotypes, and standing\nup for power of Real Beauty. We can't drive change alone. Together, let's\nchange beauty.\n\nLearn more and join us to #KeepBeautyReal at Dove.com/keepbeautyreal or on\nsocial @Dove.\n\nAbout the new research: 2024 The Real State of Beauty: a global report\n\nOnline survey conducted by Edelman DXI (Data x Intelligence), a global,\nmultidisciplinary research, analytics, and data consultancy, in November /\nDecember 2023.
