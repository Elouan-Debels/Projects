The\nContribute feature allowed users to click a button to \u201cimprove this\ntranslation\u201d, and write an alternative translation.\n\nWhen the feature launched in 2014, Google said that Contribute would help to\n\u201cincorporate your corrections and over time learn your language a little\nbetter.\u201d\n\nGoogle acknowledged the importance of Contribute to the development of\nTranslate, saying \u201cwith your help, we\u2019ve been able to add new languages and\nimprovements over the years. Since then, our systems have significantly\nevolved, allowing us to phase out Contribute.\u201d\n\nHowever, users can still send feedback to Google, by rating the translation\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d, and selecting why a translation may be poor from a select\nlist of options.\n\nAdam Bittlingmayer, CEO of ModelFront and former Google Translate engineer,\ntold Slator that while \u201csearch, ads, videos or social feeds [have]\nsuccessfully used human feedback loops at scale since the 2000s, [...] so far,\nin translation, we\u2019ve failed to use human feedback despite leading on model\narchitecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best feedback is incidental and just built into how every user uses the\nproduct\u201d, he added.\n\n## Slator Pro Guide: Translation AI\n\nThe Slator Pro Guide presents 10 new and impactful ways that LLMs can be used\nto enhance translation workflows.\n\n$290 BUY NOWIncluded in our Pro and Enterprise plan.

One volunteer, who contributed to improving Fulfulde \u2014 a\nSenegambian language spoken by approximately 36.8 million people \u2014 questioned\nif their efforts had gone to waste alongside other under-represented or long-\ntail languages in the tool:\n\n\u201cAs of 23rd March 2024, the language has reached a total of 52,600\ncontributions. This shows that the language has many dedicated people who are\nwilling to promote and revive it; they don\u2019t want their language to instinct\u201d,\nadded the user.\n\nGoogle has recently touted its commitment to low-resource language translation\nin a different setting. Google\u2019s AI Chief highlighted Gemini 1.5 Pro\u2019s success\nin \u201clearning\u201d Kalamang, described as having \u201cfewer than 200 speakers and\ntherefore virtually no presence on the web.\u201d\n\nHat tip to the Search Engine Journal for first covering the story.\n\n##### Tags\n\nAI Google Google Translate machine translation\n\n##### Share\n\n#### By Alex Edwards\n\nSenior Research Analyst at Slator.
