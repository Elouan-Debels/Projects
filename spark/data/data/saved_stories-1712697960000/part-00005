Photograph:\nJim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nNBA\n\n# \u2018Fear is the basis of human psychology\u2019: how self-doubt haunts the NBA\n\nPlayers such as Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz have been accused of suffering\nfrom the yips. But every player has to confront fear at some point\n\nJacob Uitti\n\nShare\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers basketball fans know one sentence above all else: Trust the\nprocess. It was used often when the team was struggling in the 2010s as the\nteam appeared to tank for the sake of high draft picks and long-term team\nbuilding. But two of the franchise\u2019s ensuing No 1 selections \u2013 Ben Simmons and\nMarkel Fultz, both of whom are no longer on the team, despite being dubbed\nsaviors \u2013 seemed to lose sight of the maxim when it came to their own on-court\ngames. Both players came into the NBA with sky-high potential. But they both\ncame under unwelcome scrutiny: Fultz for a hitch in his shooting technique,\nand Simmons for a reluctance to shoot at all. The pair were inevitably accused\nof succumbing to the \u201cthe dreaded yips.\u201d\n\nThroughout the history of pro sports, there have been many high profile cases\nof players losing the ability to conduct the most basic of on-field tasks. In\nbaseball, New York Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch somehow could not\nthrow to first base. Similarly, catcher Mackey Sasser found himself unable to\nsend the ball from home plate to the pitcher, double clutching his throws, as\nif he was thinking too much about the task. Pitcher Rick Ankiel, who lost his\nability to pitch and later became an outfielder, said of his issues, \u201cThrowing\nthe baseball, it felt like my wrist wouldn\u2019t work. I couldn\u2019t feel the ball.\u201d\n\nHoop Dreams at 30: Arthur Agee, William Gates and the ties that bind\n\nRead more\n\nIn football, kicker Mike Vanderjagt wasn\u2019t the same after missing a game-tying\nfield goal in 2005. It\u2019s also happens to golfers who miss easy putts and\ntennis players who start to double-fault regularly. But the ailment is rarer\nin basketball, though no less pronounced. Over the years, only a few hoopers\nhave suffered from the condition. But some have done so quite publicly. Not\nlong after missing four crucial free-throws in the 1995 NBA finals, the\nOrlando Magic\u2019s Nick Anderson went from a career 70% free-throw shooter to a\n57% one for years, even shooting 40% in 1996-97. And John Starks, who shot\n2-18 and 0-11 from three-point range in Game 7 of the 1994 NBA finals, which\nhis New York Knicks team lost, seemingly went through a meltdown on live\ntelevision despite usually being a knock-down, big-game scorer.\n\nSo, what happens along the way? For players like Fultz and Simmons, who seemed\nto lose all confidence as jump shooters, so much so that they had to leave the\n76ers for new teams and new starts \u2013 not to mention the Washington Wizards\u2019\nJordan Poole, who was punched by then-teammate Draymond Green and has never\nbeen the same since \u2013 there must be an answer. With each player, the\nunraveling didn\u2019t happen overnight. Fultz was a highly touted rookie. Simmons\nwas an All-NBA player. And Poole was a big-time contributor to the Golden\nState Warriors 2022 championship team. But along the way, something happened.\n\nTo be clear \u2013 a loss of confidence or a case of the yips is not a joke, nor is\nit funny. To be a pro athlete, no matter the salary, is difficult. Your\nprofessional (and often personal) life is on public display. Any mistake can\nbe magnified by the press and angry fans. Today, too, the stress put on\nplayers due to social media and gambling is at an all-time high. Which is why\nhighlighting the issues that happen between the ears is just as important as\ndoing so with those between the lines. Players like Kevin Love and DeMar\nDeRozan have come out and talked about their struggles with mental health.\nFultz has talked about quieting outside noises and acknowledging internal\ndoubt and sadness (it should be noted that his struggles weren\u2019t solely due to\na loss of confidence: he says he was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome,\nwhich contributed to problems with his shooting technique). Several books have\nbeen written about mental health issues in sports, too. It\u2019s an important\ntopic and one that\u2019s not going away.\n\n\u201cFear is the basis of all human psychology for so many different reasons,\u201d\nsays mental performance consultant Drew Petersen, who has worked with athletes\nin the WNBA, NBA, Olympics and college basketball. \u201cWe all have to accept\nwhatever fear we have and breathe through it. That\u2019s part of being competitive\non a daily basis. Fear becomes such a big entity for [professional athletes]\nbecause of what it will do with [their] mental identification of self.\nThinking about the result as opposed to being in process.\u201d\n\nPetersen focuses on two things when he works with pro athletes: being present\nand self-compassion. It can be easy for players, he says, to focus on the\nresults of their work \u2013 the gold medal, the championship. But those things\nshould be thought of almost as side effects, not the end goal. He also\nrecommends meditation and for players to work to slow down, not speed up or be\nhyper-reactive. \u201cIf you create more awareness,\u201d he says, \u201cyou also create more\noptions.\u201d\n\nA former basketball scout, Petersen says he used to watch if a player was\n\u201cquiet, still and at peace,\u201d he explains. \u201cBecause when they\u2019re not, they\u2019re\nnot performing at a very high level.\u201d The moment a player thinks about what he\nor she is doing, they\u2019re lost. As soon as a player forgets, say, to shoot in\nthe way they\u2019ve always known, ever since childhood, they\u2019re done for. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat happened with Ben Simmons and Nick Anderson, in my estimation,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThey\u2019re so focused on the results that they\u2019re not feeling what they\u2019ve done\ntheir entire life.\u201d\n\nWhen a player like Knoblauch, Vanderjagt, Fultz or Simmons makes a mistake, it\nbecomes much easier for them to worry about doing so again. The thing that has\ngiven them their identity their whole lives \u2013 success at sports \u2013 starts to\nhang in the balance. Some, like Michael Jordan or Derek Jeter, are seemingly\nable to push that fear out of their minds, standing on past successes or an\noutsized sense of confidence. Others, Petersen says, aren\u2019t so lucky. \u201cCourage\nis not the absence of fear,\u201d he notes. \u201cCourage is accepting the fear and\nmoving through it anyway.\u201d Petersen cites Kobe Bryant talking about Steph\nCurry and his sense of calm.\n\nGiven the pressure, it makes sense to wonder why more athletes don\u2019t suffer\nfrom the yips, or other mental hitches. \u201cMy suspicion,\u201d Petersen offers, \u201cis\nit happens a lot more than we\u2019re aware of. [But] it has never been \u2018OK\u2019 in\nathletics to be weak.\u201d While some fans can be supportive, it can also be easy\nto wilt under expectation and for players then not to trust the on-field\nprocess. So, they worry about the result rather than whether their approach is\ncorrect. But, as Petersen says, that\u2019s a backwards strategy. The mind is\nfragile. That\u2019s true for everyone, though some are able to navigate the\nfragility in more adept ways than others. But how?\n\nDr Scott Goldman, who has worked with NFL, NBA and NCAA teams for decades,\ntalks about facing one\u2019s fears. For instance, if someone is bitten by a dog,\nhe says, it can seem natural to avoid dogs. But if that person continues to\navoid dogs for the rest of their lives, when confronted with one later on,\nthey may seize up, incapable of action. And in that moment of hesitation,\nfailure can be imminent. Similarly, if someone misses a big shot, they may\nnever want to take one again. The fear can even be visible, as in Fultz\u2019s\njump-shot, Poole\u2019s miscues or Simmons\u2019 inability to simply shoot (or even\nplay). Bodies hiccup, caught between natural movements and the learned, feared\noutcomes.\n\nGoldman says he tries to work with players on a number of levels. \u201cBut the\nfirst thing I do,\u201d he says, \u201cis I listen and try to really understand what\u2019s\ngoing on for this person.\u201d Fans see athletes and coaches as immune from stress\nand fear because they\u2019re well paid and famous. But Goldman recounts a story.\nWhen he was working for the Detroit Lions, the team\u2019s then-coach told him\nabout a meme his six-year-old son found online. The coach was portrayed with\nguns surrounding his face, pointed directly at him. \u201cBecause he lost a couple\nfootball games?\u201d Goldman says. \u201cWhat are we doing here? We love our heroes in\nAmerica. But we love to shoot them down.\u201d\n\nIn a recent article on The Ringer, Fultz talked about his journey and finally\nfinding some inner-peace. Though for half a decade his struggles were NBA news\nand fodder for criticism, he says he\u2019s since put that behind him as much as\npossible. Instead, Fultz says he trusts the process \u2013 this time, however, it\u2019s\nhis own process. \u201cThe results,\u201d he says, \u201cwill come eventually, but the work\nis more important.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * NBA\n  * Basketball\n  * US sports\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Soccer\n  * NFL\n  * Tennis\n  * MLB\n  * MLS\n  * NBA\n  * NHL\n  * F1\n  * Golf\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
