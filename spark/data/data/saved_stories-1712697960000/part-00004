Focusing on the most expensive gates in fault-tolerant\n> quantum computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count\n> optimization, i.e., minimizing the number of T gates that are needed to\n> implement a given circuit. To achieve this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum,\n> a method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship\n> between optimizing T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods\n> for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-\n> specific knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which\n> significantly reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-\n> Quantum outperforms the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set\n> of arithmetic benchmarks (even when compared without making use of gadgets).\n> Remarkably, it discovers an efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method\n> for multiplication in finite fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best\n> human-designed solutions for relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor's\n> algorithm and for quantum chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating it can\n> save hundreds of hours of research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits\n> in a fully automated way.\n\nComments:| 25 pages main paper + 19 pages appendix  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2402.14396 [quant-ph]  \n(or arXiv:2402.14396v2 [quant-ph] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.14396arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Francisco Ruiz [view email] [v1] Thu, 22 Feb 2024 09:20:54 UTC (1,751\nKB) [v2] Tue, 5 Mar 2024 13:39:58 UTC (1,752 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Quantum Circuit Optimization with AlphaTensor,\nby Francisco J.
