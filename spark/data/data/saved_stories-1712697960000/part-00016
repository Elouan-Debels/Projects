Elections held in\nIndonesia and Pakistan in February, among other countries, offer an early\nglimpse of what\u2019s in store as artificial intelligence (AI) technologies\nsteadily intrude into the electoral arena. The emerging picture is deeply\nworrying, and the concerns are much broader than just misinformation or the\nproliferation of fake news.\n\nAs the former director of the Machine Learning, Ethics, Transparency and\nAccountability (META) team at Twitter (before it became X), I can attest to\nthe massive ongoing efforts to identify and halt election-related\ndisinformation enabled by generative AI (GAI). But uses of AI by politicians\nand political parties for purposes that are not overtly malicious also raise\ndeep ethical concerns.\n\nGAI is ushering in an era of \u2018softfakes\u2019. These are images, videos or audio\nclips that are doctored to make a political candidate seem more appealing.\nWhereas deepfakes (digitally altered visual media) and cheap fakes (low-\nquality altered media) are associated with malicious actors, softfakes are\noften made by the candidate\u2019s campaign team itself.\n\nHow to stop AI deepfakes from sinking society \u2014 and science\n\nIn Indonesia\u2019s presidential election, for example, winning candidate Prabowo\nSubianto relied heavily on GAI, creating and promoting cartoonish avatars to\nrebrand himself as gemoy, which means \u2018cute and cuddly\u2019. This AI-powered\nmakeover was part of a broader attempt to appeal to younger voters and\ndisplace allegations linking him to human-rights abuses during his stint as a\nhigh-ranking army officer. The BBC dubbed him \u201cIndonesia\u2019s \u2018cuddly grandpa\u2019\nwith a bloody past\u201d. Furthermore, clever use of deepfakes, including an AI\n\u2018get out the vote\u2019 virtual resurrection of Indonesia\u2019s deceased former\npresident Suharto by a group backing Subianto, is thought by some to have\ncontributed to his surprising win.\n\nNighat Dad, the founder of the research and advocacy organization Digital\nRights Foundation, based in Lahore, Pakistan, documented how candidates in\nBangladesh and Pakistan used GAI in their campaigns, including AI-written\narticles penned under the candidate\u2019s name. South and southeast Asian\nelections have been flooded with deepfake videos of candidates speaking in\nnumerous languages, singing nostalgic songs and more \u2014 humanizing them in a\nway that the candidates themselves couldn\u2019t do in reality.\n\nWhat should be done? Global guidelines might be considered around the\nappropriate use of GAI in elections, but what should they be? There have\nalready been some attempts. The US Federal Communications Commission, for\ninstance, banned the use of AI-generated voices in phone calls, known as\nrobocalls. Businesses such as Meta have launched watermarks \u2014 a label or\nembedded code added to an image or video \u2014 to flag manipulated media.\n\nBut these are blunt and often voluntary measures. Rules need to be put in\nplace all along the communications pipeline \u2014 from the companies that generate\nAI content to the social-media platforms that distribute them.\n\nWhat the EU\u2019s tough AI law means for research and ChatGPT\n\nContent-generation companies should take a closer look at defining how\nwatermarks should be used. Watermarking can be as obvious as a stamp, or as\ncomplex as embedded metadata to be picked up by content distributors.\n\nCompanies that distribute content should put in place systems and resources to\nmonitor not just misinformation, but also election-destabilizing softfakes\nthat are released through official, candidate-endorsed channels. When\ncandidates don\u2019t adhere to watermarking \u2014 none of these practices are yet\nmandatory \u2014 social-media companies can flag and provide appropriate alerts to\nviewers. Media outlets can and should have clear policies on softfakes. They\nmight, for example, allow a deepfake in which a victory speech is translated\nto multiple languages, but disallow deepfakes of deceased politicians\nsupporting candidates.\n\nElection regulatory and government bodies should closely examine the rise of\ncompanies that are engaging in the development of fake media. Text-to-speech\nand voice-emulation software from Eleven Labs, an AI company based in New York\nCity, was deployed to generate robocalls that tried to dissuade voters from\nvoting for US President Joe Biden in the New Hampshire primary elections in\nJanuary, and to create the softfakes of former Pakistani prime minister Imran\nKhan during his 2024 campaign outreach from a prison cell. Rather than pass\nsoftfake regulation on companies, which could stifle allowable uses such as\nparody, I instead suggest establishing election standards on GAI use. There is\na long history of laws that limit when, how and where candidates can campaign,\nand what they are allowed to say.\n\nCitizens have a part to play as well. We all know that you cannot trust what\nyou read on the Internet. Now, we must develop the reflexes to not only spot\naltered media, but also to avoid the emotional urge to think that candidates\u2019\nsoftfakes are \u2018funny\u2019 or \u2018cute\u2019. The intent of these isn\u2019t to lie to you \u2014\nthey are often obviously AI generated. The goal is to make the candidate\nlikeable.\n\nSoftfakes are already swaying elections in some of the largest democracies in\nthe world. We would be wise to learn and adapt as the ongoing year of\ndemocracy, with some 70 elections, unfolds over the next few months.\n\nNature 628, 237 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00995-9\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n### Competing Interests\n\nThe author declares no competing interests.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * What the EU\u2019s tough AI law means for research and ChatGPT\n\n  * Generative AI\u2019s environmental costs are soaring \u2014 and mostly secret\n\n  * Why open-source generative AI models are an ethical way forward for science\n\n  * How to stop AI deepfakes from sinking society \u2014 and science\n\n  * Stop talking about tomorrow\u2019s AI doomsday when AI poses risks today\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Ethics\n  * Government\n  * Policy\n  * Politics\n  * Society\n\n## Latest on:\n\nHow papers with doctored images can affect scientific reviews\n\nNews 28 MAR 24\n\nSuperconductivity case shows the need for zero tolerance of toxic lab culture\n\nCorrespondence 26 MAR 24\n\nMeaningfulness in a scientific career is about more than tangible outputs\n\nCorrespondence 19 MAR 24\n\nThe EU\u2019s ominous emphasis on \u2018open strategic autonomy\u2019 in research\n\nEditorial 03 APR 24\n\nLarger or longer grants unlikely to push senior scientists towards high-risk,\nhigh-reward work\n\nNature Index 25 MAR 24\n\nChina\u2013US climate collaboration concerns as Xie and Kerry step down\n\nNews 12 MAR 24\n\nHow to break big tech\u2019s stranglehold on AI in academia\n\nCorrespondence 09 APR 24\n\nBrazil\u2019s postgraduate funding model is about rectifying past inequalities\n\nCorrespondence 09 APR 24\n\nDeclining postdoc numbers threaten the future of US life science\n\nCorrespondence 09 APR 24\n\nHow papers with doctored images can affect scientific reviews\n\nNews 28 MAR 24\n\nSuperconductivity case shows the need for zero tolerance of toxic lab culture\n\nCorrespondence 26 MAR 24\n\nMeaningfulness in a scientific career is about more than tangible outputs\n\nCorrespondence 19 MAR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Laboratory Director\n\nHouston, Texas (US)\n\nBaylor College of Medicine (BCM)\n\n  * #### PhD, Postdoc and Technician positions in the Cluster of Excellence \"MicroPlanet\"\n\nPhD, Postdoc and Technician positions in interdisciplinary microbiome project\n\nAustria (AT) - Vienna, and Lower Austria\n\nUniversity of Vienna - Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems\nScience\n\n  * #### Assistant Professor in Integrated Photonics\n\nWe offer you the chance to design a unique and autonomous research program,\nnetworking with specialists, students and entrepreneurs.\n\nGothenburg (Stad), V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland (SE)\n\nChalmers University of Technology\n\n  * #### Senior Group Leader\n\nThe Gregor Mendel Institute (GMI) is recruiting a Senior Group Leader.
