Three of these essays draw upon her\nanalysis of an 11-year-old boy she names Leon.\n\nThe merest glance at Leon in their first encounter in what O\u2019Shaughnessy\ncalled the \u2018playroom\u2019 told her that a daunting challenge lay ahead. \u2018As [the\nparents] had made no mention of depression,\u2019 she recalls, \u2018I was not expecting\nthe very depressed child who arrived for a first session: a crushed, lumpy boy\nwho sat himself down in front of me on a small bench.\u2019 Before long,\nO\u2019Shaughnessy came to believe that Leon wasn\u2019t just depressed; he lived in a\nworld of lurid symbols. The cushions surrounding him on his seat, she reports,\n\u2018are de-sexualised parents whom he holds apart and around himself\u2019. In the\ndoor of the playroom, Leon is said to have discerned \u2018a penis with testicles\u2019,\nand in the patina of the floor he made out \u2018a confused vagina and mouth\u2019.\n\nNarratives by Kleinian analysts, it is safe to say, are meant for fellow\nprofessionals, who would regard Leon\u2019s grotesquerie as part of a day\u2019s work.\nBut after recently discovering O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s essays, I found myself less\nfavourably disposed. It didn\u2019t take me many pages to realise that, in fact,\nlumpy Leon was me. I recognised myself not from the phantasies ascribed to me\nbut from the circumstances of my case and from snatches of conversation that\nO\u2019Shaughnessy, too, found memorable.\n\nMy father had become professionally involved with the Tavistock, which in the\n1980s was a hotbed of Kleinian analysts. In 1986, he signed me up with\nO\u2019Shaughnessy, and I began what proved to be three years of private sessions \u2013\nfour days each week, around 40 weeks a year \u2013 in O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s Hampstead\nhome.\n\nNothing, however, was going on with me that required almost daily\npsychoanalysis for months and years. To be sure, I was shy and sometimes\nreluctant to join in with new activities. But by no means was I depressed.\nBesides a nervousness at the prospect of starting secondary school, I was a\ncontented child. And, significantly, my parents had disagreed as to whether\nintervention was even needed. \u2018Mother,\u2019 O\u2019Shaughnessy writes, \u2018was humbly\ndubious about this, insisting that Leon was just an ordinary boy, not\nacademic, no trouble at all.\u2019\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy is at pains to emphasise that the setting in which she saw\nclients was a clinical one. If that had truly been the case, however, her\nprocess of diagnosing and treating the putative issues would have been much\nmore rigorous. One would expect a genuine enquirer to ask more searching\nquestions. Is this child distressed at all? If he is, does he need four hours\na week of therapy? Do the trade-offs of taking him away from schoolwork and\nsocialising outweigh the potential benefits of therapy? And even if all these\nstars align, is psychoanalysis the appropriate intervention?\n\nWhat she made of my answers often struck me as ridiculous, and I grew\nincreasingly willing to say so\n\nBut O\u2019Shaughnessy, regarding me through the distorting lens of Kleinian\ntheory, never doubted my need for her attention. The remedy? An extended\nperiod of psychoanalysis, of course. It\u2019s a prescription that I\u2019ve no doubt\nO\u2019Shaughnessy wrote for all her clients, regardless of their diagnoses. Any\nadults among them could have chosen to make that investment of their time and\nmoney on their own terms \u2013 and would have been free to walk away should their\ncommon sense prevail \u2013 but those luxuries were not available to children.\n\nIn the early sessions, I joined in with O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s questioning, which\noften entailed her asking: \u2018What are you thinking?\u2019 What she made of my\nanswers often struck me as ridiculous, and I grew increasingly willing to say\nso. As one of her essays recalls, I told her simply: \u2018I hate your talking.\u2019\n\nAs the analysis proceeded, I came to think of it as a form of detention. I\ngrew increasingly uncomfortable in O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s company and began turning\nup to sessions late. By the final year, I was spending many hours doing my\nhomework while sitting half-obscured behind a large toy box. At other times I\nescaped altogether into a bathroom next door, reading a book.\n\nThat behaviour could have been of interest to a psychologically astute\nenquirer. Though my mother had assessed me as \u2018no trouble at all\u2019, by the\nthird year of analysis I was hiding from O\u2019Shaughnessy in a loo. Had something\nterrible happened at home or school? Or, perhaps, could the analysis itself\nhave been causing more problems than it was solving?\n\nIt\u2019s a well-worn criticism of psychoanalysis that it rests on unfalsifiable\nbeliefs \u2013 that there is no way to prove or disprove the theories on which it\nis built and the conclusions it reaches \u2013 and is therefore not a scientific\nenterprise. But in an essay titled \u2018What Is a Clinical Fact?\u2019 (1994),\nO\u2019Shaughnessy insists that the objectivity of psychoanalysis is vouchsafed by\nthe analyst undertaking \u2018supervision and discussions with colleagues\u2019. Those\ncolleagues, however, already share the analyst\u2019s doctrine, and what they\ndiscuss on any given day will consist entirely of what she chooses to tell\nthem in the shared idiom. The whole company might as well be a circle of\nastrologers.\n\nThe closed nature of this arrangement is evident in a memorial note about\nO\u2019Shaughnessy published in 2022 by the German psychoanalyst Gisela Klinckwort.\nShe describes O\u2019Shaughnessy leading a 2013 conference session that included\ndiscussion of her time with Leon. Klinckwort observes: \u2018It was very impressive\nto experience how Red observed the child\u2019s behaviour and speech, how deeply\nshe understood the child Leon and reached him with simple words.\u2019 \u2018Red\u2019, I\nlearned, was O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s nickname among her colleagues, and Klinckwort, I\nsuspect, accurately captures the cosiness of the \u2018supervision and discussions\u2019\nshe had with them. But what Klinckwort could not know is that O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s\naccount of our relationship is almost entirely the latter\u2019s own invention.\n\nReading O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s essays as an adult, I see how she was trying to fit me\ninto her theoretical framework \u2013 sometimes by revising the theory to match our\ninteractions. This is best shown in her entanglements with Sigmund Freud\u2019s\nOedipus complex. Freud claimed that all boys experience a developmental phase\nin which they desire their mother and see their father as a sexual rival. But,\nas O\u2019Shaughnessy identifies it in the essay \u2018The Invisible Oedipus Complex\u2019\n(1989), a problem threatens: what happens when one\u2019s client exhibits \u2018little\nor even no Oedipal material\u2019? She describes how the Austrian psychoanalyst\nHeinz Kohut suggests setting aside the Oedipus complex altogether. But this\nwon\u2019t do: it risks a major departure from Freud\u2019s key teachings. Fortunately\nthough, O\u2019Shaughnessy has a breakthrough with the help of Leon. Drawing on his\ncase, she posits that clients can have an \u2018invisible\u2019 Oedipus complex \u2013 with\nits invisibility taken to show not that it is irrelevant to the client, but so\ncentral and intense as to be the dominant force acting on his mental life.\nWith this, O\u2019Shaughnessy has achieved quite a feat: for psychoanalysts\nwondering whether the Oedipus complex is universal as Freud claimed, they can\nreassure themselves that either the presence or the absence of \u2018Oedipal\nmaterial\u2019 is proof of its existence. The theory stands, and there\u2019s also a\npromising new avenue of therapeutic work to explore. All roads lead to\nanalysis.\n\nHer weighty sense of her own importance led her to strip my life of any\nmeaning beyond analysis\n\nWith the criteria for \u2018Oedipal material\u2019 expanded to include both visible and\ninvisible signs, O\u2019Shaughnessy starts detecting it in almost every interaction\nwith Leon. One fact she makes much of is that, for the first eight months of\nsessions, I chose to sit on a small bench between two cushions. If memory\nserves, I sat there because the bench was near the door and was comfortable\nenough for 50 minutes. But O\u2019Shaughnessy had steeled herself against such\nmundane considerations. \u2018Leon\u2019s cushions,\u2019 she is convinced, \u2018are de-\nsexualised parents whom he holds apart and around himself \u2013 the comfortable\nremainders from which frightening components have been expelled onto the floor\nand the door.\u2019\n\nIt is worthwhile to ask how O\u2019Shaughnessy could have arrived at this inference\nand its embellishments \u2013 the penis, testicles, mouth and vagina that are said\nto have hovered before Leon like Macbeth\u2019s dagger. At no point is she clear\nthat I told her I could see those things. I\u2019d be surprised if I had, given\nthat \u2018mouth\u2019 was the only one of those words in my vocabulary at 11. What we\nhave here are projections, not from Leon\u2019s unconscious but from the ramshackle\nwarehouse of Kleinian theory.\n\nOne especially sinister dimension to the time I spent with O\u2019Shaughnessy was\nthe insidious way in which she sought to position herself between me and my\nparents. It takes a considerable amount of self-confidence to attempt such a\nthing, but in her case it was licenced by the cardinal psychoanalytic concept\nof transference. In the transference, the client is thought to imbue the\ntherapist with unresolved emotions from childhood. Accordingly, O\u2019Shaughnessy\nalleges that I often saw her as my mother. She writes that Leon wanted her \u2018to\nbe drawn away from father, come closer around [Leon] and coax him with\nquestions, not only when he was anxious and needed me to, but also when he was\nhostile and chose not to relate to me.\u2019 These opposed situations, my\nsupposedly craving closeness and my wish for distance, are both presented as\nevidence to support her preferred course of action.\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s weighty sense of her own importance led her to strip my life\nof any meaning beyond analysis, with her declaring that \u2018the gap between\nsessions or at weekends did not exist for [Leon]\u2019. In one instance, she\ndescribes me as having been so shocked by the prospect of a weekend away from\nher that I \u2018kicked violently in [her] direction and made a rude gesture of \u201cup\nyou\u201d.\u2019 As she glosses the outburst, this was really an attack on \u2018the pregnant\nmother\u2019, expecting another child who would take attention away from me. But my\nweekends were important to me precisely because they counted as time away from\nthis monomaniac. And my rude gesture, though I\u2019m not proud of it, was\naddressed to her.\n\nHer relationship with me might be regarded as an instance of what\npsychoanalysts call countertransference, but it is better viewed as a delusion\nof relevance. To underscore my lack of interest in the outside world,\nO\u2019Shaughnessy declares that I \u2018did not try at home or at school\u2019. But I did,\nas one could even glean from reading her essays, which contain references to\nmy doing homework in the sessions. Despite this, she insisted on seeing it\nonly as a device to get her attention rather than what it was: my attempt to\nanchor myself in the world outside her sessions, which was vastly more\nimportant to me than what she imagined occurring in her playroom.\n\nIf I craved O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s attention, why did the sessions come to an end?\nShe concedes that I unilaterally ended the analysis at age 13, but she finds\nthe fact hard to reconcile with her belief that I had no meaningful life\nbeyond her. She leaps into a convoluted story of a child desperate to continue\ntherapy. In what was by her count the 15th session from last, Leon brings a\ncarton of fruit juice on which the words \u2018fifteen free extra\u2019 are printed in\ncapital letters. He is said to be so anxious about losing his therapist and\ndesperate for something more (something \u2018extra\u2019) from her that he takes these\nfeelings out on the carton. Having sucked at its final drops, Leon hurls it\nacross the room into the bin before collapsing into an implausible nap: \u2018He\ntransmits to me absolutely rending pain and anxiety. And suddenly he falls\nasleep \u2013 it is so unendurable.\u2019 If this isn\u2019t altogether a confabulation on\nO\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s part, its grain of truth is that I was terminally exasperated\nand ready to throw things.\n\nThe only point on which O\u2019Shaughnessy and I agree is how little the\npsychoanalysis accomplished. In \u2018What Is a Clinical Fact?\u2019, she comments on\none session:\n\n> Now, writing this paper, I see my hopelessness when faced by Leon\u2019s\n> defended, split state, and feeling of just having to endure it, as very\n> likely coming from my sense of failure as an analyst with Leon \u2013 so limited\n> [was] my therapeutic result.\n\nBut having noticed the poor outcome, she cares only about how it bears upon\nher own feeling of hopelessness and the fortitude she needed to endure it. She\ndoes not consider it in relation to me, who spent such a long, unpleasant time\nwith her. More generally, she is almost entirely incurious about what I might\nhave got out of those dismal years. Her essays provide no indication of what\nshe wanted me to achieve in the sessions, and the question of whether I\nmanaged to pass through the invisible Oedipus complex went unanswered in her\npaper on that topic.\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s only expression of curiosity about me occurs in a brief\nsection of a paper titled \u2018On Gratitude\u2019 (2008), in which she offers a fuller\ndescription of our very first session. She recalls my returning at the end to\nsay: \u2018Thanks. Thanks. Thank you.\u2019 She asks: \u2018What was Leon thanking me for?\u2019\nThe answer is simple: I was a polite 11-year-old brought up to thank adults in\nauthority. But O\u2019Shaughnessy preferred, as always, to concoct a self-serving\nexplanation: \u2018I think it was for addressing his psychic reality, for attention\nand interpretation.\u2019 I was, she writes:\n\n> grateful too that in this new circumstance of a psychoanalytic session, when\n> he let me see his depression, fear, pleas to be softly pitied, I could ...\n> know his feelings and speak plainly about them. That is to say, I think he\n> was grateful to me for doing my job.\n\nNone of that is true. A better question \u2013 one that might conceivably have\ndented her formidable armour \u2013 would have been why I never thanked her again.\n\nShe could perceive me only as a device to play out already fixed ideas\n\nReading O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s account of our time together all these years later, I\nam struck by how much she disliked me. She several times describes what I say\nand do as being either nasty or cruel. I am characterised as self-pitying,\nmanipulative, and (oddly) lumpy. This is speculation on my part, but one\nreason for her resentment seems to be that she was unused to criticism. The\nmemorials written by her colleagues after her death are naturally\naffectionate, but they also indicate that she did not receive much in the way\nof dissent or resistance. And yet there was I, from the age of 11 offering her\nboth, with increasing frequency, over the course of three years. O\u2019Shaughnessy\nis very selective about how much of this to reveal in her essays. But she of\ncourse knew it, and evidentially didn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nHow do I feel about having come across a wild misrepresentation of my early\nself? I spend a part of my professional life reading journal articles. Meeting\nO\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s description of me in three of them was uniquely surprising.\nThe surprise gradually gave way to a sense of violation, stemming from the\nanalyst\u2019s insistent sense that she owned part of my life and could share it\nwith others as she pleased. When writing this piece, I found a video interview\nwith her recorded sometime around 2015. In it she makes casual mention of \u2018my\nyoung Leon\u2019. That proprietary comment \u2013 made over a quarter of a century after\nshe last saw me \u2013 feels to me now like an attempted kidnapping. In both its\nsubstance and its effect, it captures the essence of our relationship.\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s essays illustrate human susceptibility to indoctrination and\nthe potential for dogma to override common-sense ideas about what is\nreasonable in relationships with other people \u2013 including, of course,\nchildren. They also illustrate the dangerous tendency of inward-looking and\nself-regulating communities to error and harm.\n\nThe belief system of Melanie Klein, who taught that \u2018paranoid-schizoid\u2019\ninfants at the breast aim to bite away the faeces, the other babies, and the\npaternal penis supposed to lie within, is more than usually apt to yield\ntherapeutic craziness. Yet the problem goes beyond any one set of tenets.\nSuccessful psychotherapy requires, above all else, that the therapist attune\nherself to the other person in the room. Any set of presuppositions is a\npotential obstacle to that task. If O\u2019Shaughnessy wasted part of my childhood\nfor three frustrating years, it wasn\u2019t because she meant to do so, but because\nshe could perceive me only as a device to play out already fixed ideas. In\nsome dim way, I grasped this point from the outset, fought back, and so was\nspared more permanent harm.\n\nPsychiatry and psychotherapyChildhood and adolescenceBiography and memoir\n\n8 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nConsciousness and altered states\n\nA reader\u2019s guide to microdosing\n\nHow to use small doses of psychedelics to lift your mood, enhance your focus,\nand fire your creativity\n\nTunde Aideyan\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nFamily life\n\nA patchwork family\n\nAfter my marriage failed, I strove to create a new family \u2013 one made beautiful\nby the loving way it\u2019s stitched together\n\nLily Dunn\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nStories and literature\n\nTerrifying vistas of reality\n\nH P Lovecraft, the master of cosmic horror stories, was a philosopher who\nbelieved in the total insignificance of humanity\n\nSam Woodward\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nPublic health\n\nIt\u2019s dirty work\n\nIn caring for and bearing with human suffering, hospital staff perform extreme\nemotional labour.
