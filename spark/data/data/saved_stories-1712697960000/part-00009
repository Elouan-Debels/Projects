Nipun\nPrabhakar for Rest of World\n\nBy Ananya Bhattacharya\n\n9 April 2024 \u2022 Mumbai, India\n\nEspa\u00f1olPortugu\u00eas\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57)DeutschFran\u00e7ais\n\n  * India\u2019s second-largest e-rickshaw manufacturer, YC Electric, is a brand the average Indian would not know of.\n  * A timely partnership between a cycle rickshaw company and a three-wheeler company, YC Electric sold over 40,000 EVs in 2023.\n\nAt a small factory just north of Delhi, a welder named Ram Baran spends\nseveral hours each day training his coworkers in metal cutting, molding, and\nshaping bodies of three-wheeler electric vehicles.\n\n\u25cf\n\nSonipat\n\nThe industrial town of Sonipat is about 40 kilometers north of New Delhi.\n\nBaran is not an engineer by education. He started working at the factory in\n2017 as a helper \u2014 dusting, cleaning, and organizing items. A year later, he\ngot the opportunity to upskill and get trained in welding by Chinese\nengineers. Nearly 80% of Baran\u2019s 200 co-workers have followed a similar\ntrajectory. \u201c[They] taught us all the work,\u201d Baran told Rest of World. \u201cThey\ntaught us welding \u2014 how to put the parts and cut them. Over time, I picked up\nthe work and got promoted. Now, our people can also teach these things.\u201d\n\nEach month, this upskilled team at the factory in Sonipat \u2014 40 kilometers from\nNew Delhi \u2014 produces bodies and chassis for nearly 5,000 three-wheeler EVs,\nlocally known as e-rickshaws, for the New Delhi-based YC Electric, India\u2019s\nsecond-largest manufacturer in the segment. In 2023, YC Electric alone sold\nover 40,600 e-rickshaws, while 82,500 electric cars were sold in the country.\n\nEven as India awaits its first Tesla, these humble e-rickshaws made by workers\nlike Baran are powering an EV revolution in the country. In the last decade,\naround 1.73 million three-wheeler EVs have been sold in India. Just last\nmonth, around 500 manufacturers \u2014 most of them homegrown \u2014 sold over 44,000\ne-rickshaws, compared to less than 6,800 electric cars sold during the month.\n\nUnlike the four-wheeler and two-wheeler industries, which are controlled by\npopular brands like Tata, Ola, and Ather Energy, three of the top five brands\nin the e-rickshaw segment \u2014 YC Electric, Dilli Electric Auto, and Saera\nElectric \u2014 have little to no brand recall.\n\n\u201cBig-name companies won\u2019t set foot in the e-rickshaw industry,\u201d YC Electric\u2019s\ndirector, Pawan Kakkar, told Rest of World. \u201cThey know it\u2019s not their segment.\nThe buyer is not looking for aesthetics. [The vehicle] should be durable.\u201d\n\nYC Electric was born in 2014 out of a partnership between Kakkar and his\npartner Sanjeev Pahwa\u2019s cycle-rickshaw company and a traditional tuk-tuk\nmanufacturer. The founders took advantage of the Indian government\u2019s push for\nlocal manufacturing around the time, and set up two assembly units in Noida\nand Kolkata. They started manufacturing in Sonipat by 2016. \u201cI had the\nnetwork, and, more importantly, I knew what cycle-rickshaw drivers need,\u201d\nKakkar said.\n\nA favorable policy environment has been crucial for the three-wheeler EV\nrevolution in India, according to Lizbeth Jibi Godwin, research associate at\nthe Center for Public Policy and Research (CPPR). \u201cThe subsidies and\nexemptions from obtaining permits for EVs have made electric three-wheelers an\nattractive option,\u201d Godwin told Rest of World. \u201cAdditionally, the increasing\ndemand for last-mile connectivity in public transport, such as buses and metro\nservices, has led to a rise in electric three-wheelers.\u201d\n\nEven while government policies have spurred local EV manufacturing, the\nindustry continues to be fueled by Chinese connections for sourcing parts,\ntechnical know-how, and even training the workforce.\n\nAt the factory in Sonipat, a team of workers produces nearly 5,000 three-\nwheeler EVs for YC Electric each month.\n\nThe Sonipat plant where YC builds its e-rickshaws is a joint venture with the\ncompany\u2019s former Chinese import partners Jiang Li and Xue Jian Nan, who hold a\n49% stake in the facility. \u201cThe link [with the Chinese suppliers] became so\ngood that they also believed in us, invested money with us, and shared\ntechnology with us,\u201d Kakkar said. Chinese engineers stayed \u201cfor days\u201d to train\nwelders like Baran when the factory first opened, he said.\n\nHis company\u2019s ethos, according to Kakkar, is \u201cMake in India, but technology\nfrom China.\u201d\n\nThis dependence on China is not unique to YC Electric.\n\nSaera Electric, a direct competitor of YC Electric, produces nearly 95% of its\nvehicles locally, but some parts, like the natural magnet for the motor and\ncritical minerals for the battery, have to come from China because they do not\nnaturally occur in India, Sudip Banerjee, the company\u2019s planning and strategy\nhead, told Rest of World. He said that things could slowly change as more\nlithium reserves are found across the country.\n\n\u201cAs far as the information available and from the disclosure cited, there is\nno Indian EV company completely free of China,\u201d D Dhanuraj, founder and\nchairman for CPPR, told Rest of World.\n\n> \u201cBig-name companies won\u2019t set foot in the e-rickshaw industry; they know\n> it\u2019s not their segment.\"\n\nKakkar said the company\u2019s focus on tech has helped it reach its current scale.\nIn the financial year ending March 2024, YC Electric clocked revenue of over\n6.5 billion rupees ($78 million), Kakkar said.\n\n\u201cFrom the first day, we decided we\u2019ll work on the tech. We will not treat this\nlike a cycle rickshaw. So whatever changes were done [to the vehicle], YC\nElectric did it first,\u201d Kakkar said. For instance, he said, the company\ncustomized the vehicle\u2019s tire size and improved its suspension to meet the\nrequirements of Indian roads. \u201cWe got the first-mover advantage. And then we\ntook another step \u2014 to collaborate with the Chinese.\u201d\n\nThe China connection, though, is often hindered by geopolitical tensions. For\ninstance, YC\u2019s next champion product \u2014 a high-speed electric auto like the\nones its larger rival Mahindra makes \u2014 is stuck after border conflicts soured\nrelations between the two neighbors. The development of the new vehicle \u2014\nwhich Rest of World snuck a peek at while it was being tested at the Sonipat\nfactory \u2014 has been stunted because \u201cpeople are not able to come from [China].\nBusiness visas are also not being given,\u201d Kakkar said. India has reportedly\nput a strict visa approval process in place for Chinese professionals, causing\ndelays.\n\nThe Indian government has been trying to boost local production and reduce\ndependency on China with policies like a performance-linked incentive for\nmanufacturing and the promotion of advanced chemistry cells for the local\nproduction of lithium-ion batteries, independent public transport expert Ravi\nGadepalli, who works with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, told Rest\nof World. But a long-term vision is lacking, Dhanuraj of CPPR said. He\nbelieves a lot more clarity and incentives need to be given to research\ninstitutions and private companies working on filling gaps in the domestic\nsupply chain.\n\nAt YC, meanwhile, there has been a concerted effort to bring in domestic\ncompanies to upskill staff and provide material, the Sonipat plant\u2019s general\nmanager, Vidya Sagar Singh, told Rest of World. Tata Steel and JSW Steel,\nindustry leaders in steel manufacturing, have organized training sessions for\nworkers at the plant, with more such workshops planned, he said. Many of the\nparts at YC\u2019s Noida and Kolkata assembly plants now come from local\nmanufacturers: seats from Jemco, tires from CEAT and MRF, and suspension from\nHSL Enterprises.\n\nAnanya Bhattacharya is a Rest of World reporter based in Mumbai, India.\n\nNipun Prabhakar contributed reporting from Sonipat, India.\n\nRead more stories\n\nChina Outside China\n\nShein and MercadoLibre are fighting over vendors in Brazil\u2019s largest garment\nmarket\n\nAfter the pandemic pushed Brazilian manufacturers and store owners to digitize\ntheir businesses, e-commerce platforms began pulling out all the stops to lure\nvendors.\n\nBy La\u00eds Martins\n\nEV Revolution\n\nChina is betting on battery swaps to tackle EV chargers shortage\n\nRarely seen globally, there are already thousands of battery swap stations\nacross China.\n\nBy Caiwei Chen\n\nRegional Champions\n\nJumia Food\u2019s shutdown left hundreds of drivers jobless, unable to withdraw\nearnings\n\nFormer gig drivers in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda are still feeling the pinch\nafter Jumia Food abruptly exited seven African markets.\n\nBy Kimberly Mutandiro\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": true}
