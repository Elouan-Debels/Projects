Matt Haney, a Democrat from San\nFrancisco, would establish a \u201cright to disconnect\u201d throughout the state by\nrequiring employers and workers to agree to rules ahead of time about how or\nwhen they can be contacted outside of work.\n\nThe bill was introduced in February but is gaining notice now as it is being\nadvanced to a committee for further consideration.\n\nUnder the terms of the bill, if the employer violates the rules that they and\ntheir workers have established, a worker could file a complaint to the state\nlabor commission, potentially resulting in a fine of $100 for bosses if it\u2019s\ndeemed they broke the rules. The bill essentially places the option to report\non an employer in the workers\u2019 hands if they believe they\u2019re being asked to\nwork outside of their normal hours too frequently.\n\nCritics have complained that the bill could hurt small business owners, as\nthey may worry that their actions could get them in trouble, even if they ask\na simple question that doesn\u2019t need an immediate response. But Haney maintains\nthat wouldn\u2019t be an issue, as the rules that employers and their workers\nconceive of could allow for that caveat if they wanted.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nEconomy & Labor\n\n## Sanders, Democrats Introduce Bill to Guarantee Workers Paid Time Off\n\nThe US is the only wealthy country in the world that doesn\u2019t guarantee time\noff for workers.\n\nBy\n\n    Sharon Zhang ,\n    Truthout\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nEmployers \u201cjust need to have a policy on it about when people are working and\nwhen they are not.\u201d Haney told CBS News. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that hard and the\nproblem right now is the murkiness and the gray area can lead people to feel\nthat they need to be on 24/7. If an employee consents to be working late hours\nand available all the time, have them sign on to that in their employee\ncontract.\u201d\n\nThe bill also carves out exceptions for all employers in the state, such as\nallowing them to contact employees outside of work hours without consequences\nin an emergency, for example.\n\nThirteen countries around the globe have enacted laws that are similar to the\nproposed bill. If passed into law, California would become the first state in\nthe U.S. to implement the idea.\n\nIn an appearance on NBC News, management expert and Cal State East Bay\nprofessor Amira Barger lauded the bill as a means to lessen worker exhaustion,\nwhich has become more prevalent for many workers in the ongoing COVID\npandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with an epidemic of burnout and that\u2019s part of how we got\nhere,\u201d Barger said. \u201cThis is a necessary adaptation as we look towards the\nfuture of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployees are demanding more of employers and they are demanding a new value\nproposition of what work looks like,\u201d Barger added.\n\n##### Tired of reading the same old news from the same old sources?\n\nSo are we!
