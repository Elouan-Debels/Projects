And yet, maintaining a healthy business while producing Open Source\nsoftware feels more like an art than a science.\n\nThe Open Source Initiative wants to facilitate discussions about doing\nbusiness with and for Open Source.\n\nIf you run a business producing Open Source products or your company\u2019s revenue\ndepends on Open Source in any way, we want to hear from you! Share your\ninsights on:\n\n  * How you balance the needs of paying customers with those of partners and non-paying users\n  * How you organize your sales, marketing, product and engineering teams to deal with your communities\n  * What makes you decide where to draw the lines between pushing fixes upstream and maintaining a private fork\n  * Where do you see the value of copyleft in software-as-a-service\n  * Why you chose a specific license for your product offering and how do you deal with external contributions\n  * What trends do you see in the ecosystem and what effects are these having\n\nWe want to hear about these and other topics, from personal experiences and\nresearch.
