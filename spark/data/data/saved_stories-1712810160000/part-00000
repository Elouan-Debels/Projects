While there can be no definitive\nanswer, Tyler Cowen\u2019s exploration of this question is a compelling invitation\nto the history of economics.\n\nI still consider myself a newcomer to the history of economics. My formal\nintroduction came in graduate school when David Levy (now a major figure in\nthe field, then a newly minted Ph.D.) took the Amtrak from northern Virginia\nto Philadelphia once a week to teach the class. A year later I sat in on the\nsame course when Arthur Bloomfield (who was in his seventies) approached the\nsubject from a completely different angle. I read (and read about) the great\neconomists of the past sporadically for almost four decades, then finally\nfocused my attention on the topic a year and a half ago when I started\nteaching the subject. This is one reason I took up Cowen\u2019s book\u2014to up my game.\nWho and what does Cowen think is worth reading? More importantly, what can I\nglean from him in teaching the course next time? Would his book be suitable\nfor classroom use?\n\nTo answer the last three questions: 1) He ranks (in reverse chronological\norder) Milton Friedman, John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, John Stuart\nMill, Thomas Malthus, and Adam Smith as the contenders for the greatest of all\ntime (GOAT) crown. Another set of greats\u2014Paul Samuelson, Kenneth Arrow, Gary\nBecker, Joseph Schumpeter, and Alfred Marshall\u2014are considered as well in an\nilluminating chapter. (His ranking meshes well with William Davis, Bob\nFiggins, David Hedengren, and Daniel Klein\u2019s article in Econ Journal Watch on\neconomics professors\u2019 favorite economic thinkers. The profession\u2019s favorite\npre-twentieth century economists include Smith (number one), Marshall (third),\nMill (fourth), and Malthus (sixth). Their favorite twentieth-century deceased\neconomists were Keynes, Friedman, Samuelson, Hayek, and Schumpeter. And their\nfavorite living economists (in 2011) were Becker and Arrow (who are both now\ndeceased.) 2) There\u2019s a lot to be learned from Cowen\u2019s book\u2014both broad\nconceptual ideas and interesting revealing facts about these thinkers. 3)\nWhile it is immensely readable (actually, downright fun to read from my point\nof view), the book won\u2019t always work that well in an undergraduate class, as\nit often presumes the reader already has considerable familiarity with these\nthinkers. I am likely to point students to GOAT but won\u2019t assign it\u2014nor has\nCowen marketed it as designed for classrooms\u2014although I will probably assign a\nfew sections of it.\n\nBack to the first question: who is the greatest economist of all time? It\nsurely depends on your criteria. Cowen\u2019s are these: \u201cTo qualify as \u2018GOAT\u2014the\ngreatest economist of all time,\u2019 I expect the following from a candidate. The\neconomist must be original, of great historical import, serve as a creator and\ncarrier of important ideas, have a hand in both theory and empirics, have a\nhand in both macro and micro, and be \u2018not too wrong\u2019 on the substance of\nissues. Furthermore, the person also must be a pretty good economist! That is,\nif you sat down with the person and discussed economic issues, you would be in\nsome way impressed\u201d (p. 8). This sounds very reasonable, and Cowen\u2019s judgments\nmake considerable sense as he implements his criteria.\n\nSpoiler alert: Cowen doesn\u2019t actually pick a single GOAT. Instead, he picks\nthree who are the greatest in some ways: Friedman, Mill, and Smith. My\nreading\u2014based on what he says about each, and his criteria listed above\u2014is\nthat Friedman is most deserving of Cowen\u2019s crown. But he wrote the book, not\nme.\n\nThe book is very personal in two ways\u2014it digs into the personalities of these\neconomists and Cowen brings in his own personality, life experiences, and\npoint of view. Accordingly, I will follow his lead.\n\nCowen shows that Milton Friedman had a huge impact on policy\u2014inspiring\nreformers like Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and those rebuilding Eastern\nEurope after the fall of the Iron Curtain. He helped kill the draft, pushed\nfor floating exchange rates, was very influential among central bankers (such\nas Ben Bernanke), and helped resurrect \u201cgood common sense\u201d (p. 24, perhaps the\nhighest compliment in the book, as I see it). The biggest surprise of the\nchapter is that Cowen doesn\u2019t mention Clark Warburton. Warburton pioneered\nempirical research on the relationship between monetary forces and economic\noutcomes. In the preface to A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960\n(1963, Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. xiii), Friedman and Anna\nSchwartz acknowledged that \u201c[w]e owe an especially heavy debt to Clark\nWarburton. His detailed and valuable comments on several drafts have\nimportantly affected the final version. In addition, time and again, as we\ncame to some conclusion that seemed to us novel and original we found that he\nhad been there before.\u201d George Tavlas (2023, The Monetarists: The Making of\nthe Chicago Monetary Tradition, 1927\u20131960, Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress) makes the compelling case that Warburton was crucial in changing\nFriedman\u2019s mind on these issues, bringing him to the conclusions for which he\nis famous\u2014that changes in the money supply were behind most historical booms\nand busts, most importantly the Great Depression. Tavlas (p. 386, 388,\nemphasis in the original) puts it this way: \u201cWarburton likely exerted a\ndirect\u2014and, possibly, a profound\u2014impact on Friedman\u2019s monetary views at the\ntime during which those views were undergoing a marked change,\u201d convincing him\nthat \u201cthe monetary system was not, as Friedman had argued, \u2018inherently\nunstable.\u2019 It was rendered unstable during the Depression by the passive\nbehavior of Fed officials.\u201d\n\nFriedman was a pathbreaking theorist and empiricist, but Cowen complains that\nhe \u201clacked depth of spirit\u201d (p. 44), which strikes me as a truly odd thing to\nsay. This is tied to Friedman\u2019s unwillingness to let you get inside his head\nand his emotions in his joint autobiography, Two Lucky People. The most\ninteresting fact I learned is that Friedman most likely had congenital\n\u201camusia\u201d\u2014the inborn inability to enjoy music. My love of music\u2014especially\nsinging hymns\u2014is one of the things that cured me of my own atheism. What a sad\nfate to suffer from amusia. (Would Friedman have been an agnostic if he loved\nmusic?)\n\nAs the concerns and methods of the twentieth century fade away, it may be\nnatural that Milton Friedman\u2019s status in the economics profession begins to\nebb. However, Friedman left a gigantic electronic footprint\u2014for example all\nthe episodes of Free to Choose, his PBS series, are available on YouTube. The\nfirst episode has about a quarter of a million views. Friedman has an inviting\nvoice, a compelling delivery, and a fairly photogenic presence, so he\u2019s less\nlikely to fade from the public memory. Many of my students are in awe of him.\n\nCowen reads the John Maynard Keynes of The General Theory \u201cas writing about an\neconomy where uncertainty was much higher than usual, investment was highly\nunstable, fiscal policy was unable to fill in the gap, there was a risk or\neven reality of a downward spiral of prices and wages, monetary and exchange\nrate policies were out of whack, multipliers operate, the quest for savings\ncould lower incomes overall, and the influence of liquidity factors on money\ndemand and interest rates was especially high. All at once\u201d (p. 72, emphasis\nin the original). In other words, Cowen drives home the point that this\n\u201cgeneral theory\u201d isn\u2019t actually general, it\u2019s about very special, very unusual\ncircumstances.\n\nHe considers Lord Keynes the GOAT contender whom he would most \u201cwant to hang\naround with\u201d (p. 54). I had exactly the opposite reaction. The Keynes he\nportrays is virtually an egotistical monster. One who, for example, \u201ckept an\nextended spreadsheet of his lovers and sexual encounters ... each one rated by\nnumber\u201d (p. 58). Anyone who treats other human beings this way\u2014let alone\nwriting it down\u2014isn\u2019t the kind of person I want to hang around with.\n\nIt is, perhaps, no surprise that, as Cowen documents, eugenics \u201cstood at the\nheart of [Keynes\u2019s] progressivism\u201d (p. 89). Cowen argues that failings like\nthese should not reduce one\u2019s consideration of Keynes as a great economist,\n\u201cany more than the Kobe Bryant rape trial ... would induce me to lower his\nrating as a basketball player\u201d (p. 92). This is a hard argument to sustain.\nAlthough athletes are rated almost entirely by their on-field performance\n(aside from Ty Cobb?), the same logic doesn\u2019t carry over well to thinkers. To\nunderstand their ideas, you have to know how they lived them out. Knowing\nthese things about Keynes, helps us understand the true meaning of his\nrhetoric, including a faith that government can work wonders if we just put\nthe right people in charge\u2014people like Keynes and his friends. Have you ever\nnoticed that the right people are virtually never in charge? Keynes comes\nacross as someone who thinks it\u2019s okay for people like him to run other\npeople\u2019s lives, to use them as pawns\u2014and that\u2019s what seems embedded in his\npolicy ideas.\n\nThe chapter on the \u201calso rans\u201d is one of my favorites, although it presumes\nthe most knowledge on the part of the reader. Cowen argues that despite his\ngenius and innumerable contributions to the field, Paul Samuelson simply\ndidn\u2019t understand economics very well. He diminishes Samuelson for being\n\u201csmall minded,\u201d based partly on his tastes for familiarity and continuity.\nMuch of this draws on \u201cMe and Paul\u201d by Janice Murray (2020, History of\nPolitical Economy 52 [5]: 813\u201326), who was Samuelson\u2019s long-time assistant.\nMurray puts it plainly: \u201cPaul did not like change\u201d (p. 817). Samuelson was a\nstick in the mud, who didn\u2019t even use email! But the portrait of Samuelson is\ndescribing him as a fairly elderly man\u2014from age 75 into his nineties, so these\ncharges seem rather unfair.\n\nCowen argues that the \u201csecond most important paper was Samuelson\u2019s \u201c\u2018An Exact\nConsumption Loan Model of Interest, With or Without the Contrivance of Money\u2019\n... Samuelson put his brilliant mind to thinking about a new way of modeling\neconomic interactions across the generations and indeed across time. All at\nonce, Samuelson gave economists a new way of thinking about Social Security, a\nnew way of modeling money (as a \u201chot potato\u201d in an overlapping-generations\ngame), a new way of thinking about the relationship between an economy\u2019s\ninterest rate and growth rate, and a new way of thinking about the import of\npopulation growth rates and also their relationship with interest rates.\nWhew!\u201d (pp. 153\u201354). Whew, indeed!\n\nIn a Newsweek column from 1967, Samuelson wrote:\n\n> The beauty about social insurance is that it is actuarially unsound.\n> Everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far\n> exceed anything he has paid in.... How is this possible? It stems from the\n> fact that the national product is growing at compound interest and can be\n> expected to do so for as far ahead as the eye cannot see. Always there are\n> more youths than old folks in a growing population. More important, with\n> real income growing at some 3 percent per year, the taxable base upon which\n> benefits rest in any period are [sic] much greater than the taxes paid\n> historically by the generation now retired.... Social security is squarely\n> based on what has been called the eighth wonder of the word\u2014compound\n> interest. A growing nation is the greatest Ponzi game ever contrived. And\n> that is a fact, not a paradox\u201d (1973, The Samuelson Sampler, Glen Ridge,\n> N.J.: Thomas Horton and Co.: 147\u201348).\n\nThis disconnect\u2014brilliantly developing the overlapping-generations model yet\nnot understanding that the actuarial unsoundness of Social Security could and\nwould eventually be ugly\u2014highlights Cowen\u2019s claim that, ironically, Samuelson\ndidn\u2019t understand economics very well. Naively thinking that current trends\nwill last forever, isn\u2019t the hallmark of a goat. Alas, we face the day of\nreckoning as population growth rates fall and the total fertility rate\ncollapses. All Ponzi schemes come to an end. Pity those holding the worthless\nIOUs.\n\nThe chapter on Hayek is interesting and informative, but (to me at least)\ncontains no real surprises. The chapter on Smith does contain some interesting\nsurprises\u2014especially Cowen\u2019s emphasis on Smith\u2019s mercantilist streak,\nincluding a reminder that Smith as a customs collector was an enforcer of the\nmercantilist state and his reminder that Smith presented the \u201cart of war\u201d as\n\u201cthe noblest of all arts\u201d (p. 291, emphasis added). The surprise is that Cowen\nopens his discussion of The Wealth of Nations with this emphasis rather than\ndiscussing the division of labor or the propensity to truck, barter, and\nexchange. Because Cowen doesn\u2019t need to be text-bookish, he casts a wider net\nthan most discussions of Smith, which adds real value here.\n\nMill comes across (again, at least to me) as a bit of crank, even though\nCowen\u2019s goal seems to be to elevate his status. Instead, the economist whose\nstatus rose the most in my reading is Malthus\u2014despite Cowen\u2019s focus on Malthus\nas answering today\u2019s most pressing question: climate change. (Cowen muses that\nif \u201cenvironmental problems did dominate our future, Malthus might then in fact\nbe GOAT and I would have some psychological recompense to make up for my home\nbeing flooded\u201d (p. 284). However, his hometown of Fairfax, Virginia is about\n310 feet above sea level, so if all the glaciers melted causing sea level to\nrise 230 feet, he wouldn\u2019t actually be flooded out.) Rather, Malthus seems to\nhave focused on the most pressing question of every time and place: virtue\nversus vice. And Cowen makes the point that modern society has defined away\nsome of the vices from Malthus\u2019s time. However, Cowen\u2019s key point\u2014one that\nmany historians of economic thought make\u2014is that you shouldn\u2019t read only the\nfirst edition of Malthus\u2019s An Essay on the Principle of Population. All in\nall, Cowen shows that Malthus had a range of important insights on a lot of\nimportant subjects\u2014and contrary to his many critics, Malthus wasn\u2019t a \u201cmeanie\u201d\n(p. 267).\n\nWhichever economist you would pick as goat, whichever economist you consider\nto be a hero or a meanie, GOAT is worth reading. It is no mean achievement.\n\nRobert M. Whaples\n\nWake Forest University\n\nEconomistsEconomyPhilosophy and Religion\n\nOther Independent Review articles by Robert M.
