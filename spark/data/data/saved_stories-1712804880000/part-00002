When\nTinder and other dating apps took off in the early 2010s, they unleashed a way\nto more easily access potential love interests than ever before. By 2017,\nabout five years after Tinder introduced the swipe, more than a quarter of\ndifferent-sex couples were meeting on apps and dating websites, according to a\nstudy led by the Stanford sociologist Michael Rosenfeld. Suddenly, saying \u201cWe\nmet on Hinge\u201d was as normal as saying \u201cWe met in college\u201d or \u201cWe met through a\nfriend.\u201d\n\nThe share of couples meeting on apps has remained pretty consistent in the\nyears since his 2017 study, Rosenfeld told me. But these days, the mood around\ndating apps has soured. As the apps seek to woo a new generation of daters,\nTikTok abounds with complaints about how hard it is to find a date on Tinder,\nHinge, Bumble, Grindr, and all the rest. The novelty of swiping has worn off,\nand there hasn\u2019t been a major innovation beyond it. As they push more paid\nfeatures, the platforms themselves are facing rocky finances and stalling\ngrowth. Dating apps once looked like the foundation of American romance. Now\nthe cracks are starting to show.\n\nIn 2022, a Pew Research Center survey found that about half of people have a\npositive experience with online dating, down from October 2019. With little\nsuccess on the apps, a small but enthusiastic slice of singles are reaching\nfor speed dating and matchmakers. Even the big dating apps seem aware that\nthey are facing a crisis of public enthusiasm. A spokesperson for Hinge told\nme that Gen Z is its fastest-growing user segment, though the CEO of Match\nGroup, the parent company of Tinder and Hinge, has gone on the defensive. Last\nweek, he published an op-ed headlined \u201cDating Apps Are the Best Place to Find\nLove, No Matter What You See on TikTok.\u201d A spokesperson for Bumble told me\nthat the company is \u201cactively looking at how we can make dating fun again.\u201d\n\nIn part, what has changed is the world around the apps, Rosenfeld said. The\nmassive disruptions of the pandemic meant that young people missed out on a\nkey period to flirt and date, and \u201cthey\u2019re still suffering from that,\u201d he told\nme. Compared with previous generations, young people today also have \u201ca\ngreater comfort with singleness,\u201d Kathryn Coduto, a professor of media science\nat Boston University, told me. But if the apps feel different lately, it\u2019s\nbecause they are different. People got used to swiping their hearts out for\nfree. Now, the apps are further turning to subscriptions and other paid\nfeatures.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### The Unexplained Noise 2 Percent of People Can Hear\n\nEmily Buder\n\n  * ### The Nocturnals\n\nFaith Hill\n\n  * ### The Power of One Push-Up\n\nJames Hamblin\n\nTinder, for example, launched a $499-a-month premium subscription in December.\nOn Hinge, you can signal special interest in someone\u2019s profile by sending them\na \u201crose,\u201d which then puts you at the top of their feed. Everyone gets one free\nrose a week, but you can pay for more. Hinge users have accused the app of\ngatekeeping attractive people in \u201crose jail,\u201d but a spokesperson for the app\ndefended the feature: Hinge\u2019s top goal is to help people go on dates, she\nsaid, claiming that roses are twice as likely to lead to one.\n\nIt\u2019s the same process that has afflicted Google, Amazon, Uber, and so many\nother platforms in recent years: First, an app achieves scale by providing a\nservice lots of people want to use, and then it does whatever is needed to\nmake money off of you. This has worked for some companies\u2014after 15 years, Uber\nis finally profitable\u2014but monetization is especially tricky for dating apps.\nNo matter how much you fork up, apps can\u2019t guarantee that you will meet the\nlove of your life\u2014or even have a great first date. With dating apps, \u201cyou\u2019re\nbasically paying for a chance,\u201d Coduto told me. Paying for a dating-app\nsubscription can feel like entering a lottery: exciting but potentially a\nwaste of money (with an added dose of worry that you look desperate). And\nthere has always been a paradox at the core of the apps: They promise to help\nyou meet people, but they make money if you keep swiping.\n\nOver the past few years, the big dating companies have faltered as businesses.\nTinder saw its paid users fall by nearly 10 percent in 2023, and the big apps\nhave been beset by layoffs and leadership changes. Bumble and Match Group have\nseen their stock prices plummet as investors grow frustrated. Perhaps the\nbiggest problem that the apps might face is not that people are abandoning\nthem en masse\u2014they aren\u2019t\u2014but that even a small dip could prove detrimental.\nThe current big apps\u2019 edge relies on lots of people using them. Apps such as\nTinder and Grindr \u201chave an enormous network advantage over newcomers,\u201d\nRosenfeld said, for the same reasons Facebook does: It\u2019s not that they\u2019re\namazing; it\u2019s that they\u2019re giant. If you want to meet other single people, the\napps are where other single people are.\n\nSo far, the big apps\u2019 efforts to avoid this doom loop have involved the same\nbasic feature that has been around since the beginning: swiping. \u201cWe\u2019re\nessentially at a tipping point for at least this version of the technology,\u201d\nCoduto said. Like so many other industries, dating apps swear they have the\nanswer: AI. George Arison, the CEO of Grindr, told me that the app plans to\nuse AI (with users\u2019 permission) to suggest chat topics and power an \u201cAI\nwingman\u201d feature, and to scan for spam and illegal activity. Hinge\u2019s CEO has\nsuggested that AI will help the app coach users and enable people to find\nmatches, and a product leader at Tinder said last month that the app has used\nAI to power safety features, adding that the technology can help users select\ntheir profile photos.\n\nBut AI also holds the potential to unleash chaos on the apps: Bot-written\nmessages and bot-written profiles don\u2019t exactly sound like a recipe for\nfinding love. For Gen Z, the future may hold a grab bag of sliding into DMs,\nreluctant swiping, and generally doing what humans have always done\u2014seek\ncompanionship and love through any means they can muster. With all the time\nspent online now, people are finding love on Strava, Discord, and Snapchat,\namong many other sites. In a sense, any app can be a dating app.\n\nTraditional dating apps might be most useful not to young people but to those\nmiddle-aged and older, with money to spare. They are more likely to be part of\n\u201cthin\u201d dating markets, or segments of the population where the number of\neligible partners is relatively small, Reuben Thomas, a professor at the\nUniversity of New Mexico, told me. Online dating is \u201creally useful for people\nwho don\u2019t have that rich dating environment in their offline lives,\u201d Thomas\nsaid.\n\nIn this way, the future of dating apps may look more like their past: a place\nfor older daters to go after exhausting other options. In the 2000s, the\nheyday of OkCupid, eHarmony, and desktop dating, middle-aged people were the\npower users, Thomas said. Millennials had their fun on Tinder in the 2010s;\nmany found lasting relationships. But as a top choice for young people looking\nfor love, dating apps may have been a blip.\n\nLora Kelley is an associate editor at The Atlantic and an author of the\nAtlantic Daily newsletter.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
