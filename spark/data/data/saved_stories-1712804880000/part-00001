According to the report, large grocery\ncompanies saw the pandemic as an opportunity. They deliberately wielded their\nmarket power amid food shortages, entrenching their dominance and keeping\ntheir shelves stocked even as smaller companies had to scramble for goods or\nsimply close up shop. For the big players in the grocery industry\u2014companies\nsuch as Walmart\u2014the pandemic was a boon. And profits have continued to climb,\nalong with food prices, even as supply-chain disruptions have vanished.\n\nWhy did all of this happen? The FTC report implied an answer but did not state\nit outright: A handful of companies now control the food system of the United\nStates, stifling competition in ways not seen since the great trusts and\nmonopolies of the late 1890s. The mergers and acquisitions of the past four\ndecades have greatly reduced the number of companies\u2014a fact hidden by the\nmultiplicity of brands. Kroger, the nation\u2019s largest supermarket chain, runs\ngrocery stores under more than two dozen names. That number would nearly\ndouble if its announced merger with Albertsons is allowed to proceed.\n\nAlmost a quarter of a century ago, my book Fast Food Nation called attention\nto an accelerating phenomenon: corporate, quasi-monopolistic control of\nAmerica\u2019s food system with harmful consequences for workers, consumers,\nlivestock, and the land. The forces identified then are even more powerful\ntoday.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study by the public-interest group Food & Water Watch,\nfour companies now control about 52 percent of the American market for rice,\nabout 61 percent of the market for fresh bread, and about 79 percent of the\nmarket for pasta. Four companies are responsible for processing about 70\npercent of the nation\u2019s hogs and 85 percent of its cattle. The widespread\nadoption of factory farming has extended monopoly power even to commercial-\nlivestock genetics. Three companies now provide the breeding stock for about\n47 percent of the world\u2019s hogs. Two companies provide the breeding stock for\nabout 94 percent of the world\u2019s egg-laying hens. The same two companies, EW\nGroup and Hendrix Genetics, provide the breeding stock for 99 percent of the\nworld\u2019s turkeys. EW and Hendrix are also two of the world\u2019s largest providers\nof breeding stock for farmed trout, salmon, and tilapia.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### America Misunderstands the Declaration of Independence Because of a Typo\n\nKasia Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg\n\n  * ### What Is MasterClass Actually Selling?\n\nCarina Chocano\n\n  * ### The Wedding Sting\n\nJeff Maysh\n\nAmanda Mull: We\u2019ve never been good at feeding babies\n\nEconomists have a metric known as the \u201cfour-firm concentration ratio,\u201d\nsometimes deployed in shorthand as \u201cCR4.\u201d It is a measure of competitiveness\nin a market for goods or services. When four companies gain a combined market\nshare that is greater than 40 percent, an oligopoly has formed. The prices\noffered to suppliers, the prices charged to consumers, and the wages paid to\nworkers are no longer determined mainly by market forces. Further, the power\nthese corporations exert within their industries and the economy as a whole\nleads to a well-documented dynamic: Effective government regulation becomes\ndifficult, whether because state and federal agencies are \u201ccaptive\u201d or because\nthey are outmatched in terms of resources and personnel.\n\nFor the oligopoly, this is a welcome state of affairs. On occasion, a single\nevent illuminates the consequences for the rest of us.\n\nCronobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen that can be dangerous to infants\nwho are younger than two months, born prematurely, or immunocompromised. After\ninfection with the pathogen, the estimated death rate among such babies ranges\nfrom 40 to 60 percent. Many of those who survive have lifelong intestinal and\nbrain damage and seizure disorders. The incidence of Cronobacter infections in\nthe United States is unknown\u2014until January of this year, only two states,\nMichigan and Minnesota, made a point of recording the number of cases. The\noverwhelming majority of infections go undetected. Since the late 1980s,\npowdered infant formula has been recognized as an important route of\ntransmission to infants. Unlike liquid formula, powdered formula is not\nsterilized before being sold. Cronobacter may survive in powdered formula for\nat least a year. Once liquid is added to the powder, Cronobacter becomes\nbioactive and potentially deadly.\n\nIn September 2021, a case of Cronobacter was diagnosed in Minnesota. The baby\nwas hospitalized for three weeks but survived. The Minnesota Department of\nHealth promptly shared information about the case\u2014and the brand and the lot\nnumber of the powdered formula linked to it\u2014with the FDA and the CDC. During\nthe next several months, three more infants were diagnosed with Cronobacter in\nother states. Two of them died. All of the illnesses were linked to formula\nproduced at the same plant: the nation\u2019s largest infant-formula factory,\noccupying almost 1 million square feet, covering more land than a dozen\nfootball fields. It was located in Sturgis, Michigan, and owned by Abbott\nNutrition.\n\nPoorly managed and notoriously reluctant to confront major food companies, the\nFDA was slow to react. In the fall of 2021, a former employee at the Sturgis\nplant had contacted the FDA to warn that safety records there were routinely\nbeing falsified, essential cleaning steps were being skipped, and baby formula\nwas being packaged and shipped without being tested for lethal bacteria. The\nwhistleblower sent the FDA a 34-page document describing a lack of concern\nabout food safety in Sturgis, inexperienced and poorly trained workers, an\nemphasis on simply getting product out the door, and a corporate culture at\nAbbott Nutrition that encouraged retaliation against employees who raised\nuncomfortable questions.\n\nFour months elapsed before the FDA, in early 2022, showed up in Sturgis to\nconduct a thorough inspection of the Abbott plant. Multiple strains of\nCronobacter were discovered in the facility. FDA officials later described\nconditions at the plant as \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cunacceptably unsanitary.\u201d\n\nIn February, Abbott voluntarily shut down its Sturgis factory and recalled\nthree brands of powdered formula made there: EleCare, Alimentum, and Similac.\nThe plant did not fully reopen for more than six months.\n\nAbbott Nutrition has insisted that neither the FDA nor the CDC could \u201cfind any\ndefinitive link between the company\u2019s products and illnesses in children.\u201d But\nFrank Yiannas, a former vice president of food safety at Walmart who served as\na deputy commissioner of the FDA during the formula recall, found Abbott\u2019s\ndenials misleading. Multiple factors suggested that Abbott was indeed\nresponsible for those four cases of Cronobacter, Yiannas testified before\nCongress: \u201cAbbott\u2019s Sturgis plant lacked adequate controls to prevent the\ncontamination of powdered infant formula ... sporadic contamination of\nfinished product actually did occur, and it is likely that other lots of\n[infant formula] produced in this plant were contaminated with C. sakazakii\nstrains over time, which evaded end-product testing, were released into\ncommerce, and consumed by infants.\u201d\n\nThe health threat posed by the Abbott formula was bad enough. But there were\nother ramifications, because Abbott Nutrition was the largest firm in an\ninfant-formula oligopoly. About 99 percent of the nation\u2019s supply of infant\nformula was controlled by just four companies: Abbott, Mead Johnson,\nNestl\u00e9/Gerber, and Perrigo. The Abbott factory in Sturgis produced about 20\npercent of the infant formula consumed in the United States. It also\nmanufactured the majority of the specialty formulas needed by infants,\nchildren, and even adults with certain gastrointestinal ailments.\n\nThe shutdown of that one plant led to nationwide shortages of infant formula\nthat lasted throughout 2022. The other three companies stepped in to make up\nfor the shortfall, earning large profits in the process. Nevertheless, formula\nshortages, hoarding, and panic buying created anxiety among countless American\nparents that their babies might not be able to eat.\n\nTwo years later, a number of steps have been taken to improve the safety of\npowdered infant formula. Cases of Cronobacter in every state must now be\nreported to the CDC. Spurred by food-safety advocates, the FDA last year\nformed a unified Human Foods Program that promises a streamlined bureaucracy\nwith a strong dedication to preventing the sale of contaminated food. We will\nsee. In terms of resources, the FDA is outmatched. The FDA\u2019s Center for Food\nSafety and Nutrition, which is responsible for the oversight of about 80\npercent of the food consumed in the United States, has 1,071 employees\u2014about\nthe same number of employees it had in 1978. The nation\u2019s population has\nincreased by more than 100 million since then.\n\nThe dominance of the four companies that control the market for powdered\ninfant formula is even more pronounced within individual states, where one\ncompany typically controls more than 90 percent of the formula market. That\u2019s\nthe result of the single-supplier contracts demanded by the federal Women,\nInfants, and Children program. The concentrated power of the four companies\nhas made infant formula more expensive in the United States than it is in the\nEuropean Union, despite the EU\u2019s more stringent rules on organic ingredients\nand food additives in formula.\n\nActing with common purpose and singular focus, oligopolies are influential.\nThe infant-formula oligopoly benefits from government restrictions on EU and\nCanadian imports. It has thwarted innovation, avoided criminal penalties for\nsickening infants, and maintained factories with obsolete equipment. It has\nleft the United States with a production capacity that lacks resilience.\n\nThis is the state of affairs in a single industry. But it extends to the\nentire economy.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Founders despised monopolies. James Madison called them \u201csacrifices\nof the many to the few.\u201d Thomas Jefferson suggested that the Constitution\nought to include what would now be regarded as an antitrust provision. Writing\nto a friend in 1788, Jefferson listed the essential freedoms that a Bill of\nRights should defend. The first three on his list were \u201cfreedom of religion,\u201d\n\u201cfreedom of the press,\u201d and \u201cfreedom of commerce against monopolies.\u201d In some\nquarters, none of these three would make the cut today.\n\nThe trustbusters of the early 20th century were remarkably successful at\ncreating and preserving competitive markets in the American economy. But the\nrelaxation of antitrust enforcement during the 1980s soon led to greatly\nreduced competition not only in the food industry but also in banking,\npublishing, aerospace, and many other industries.\n\nForty years ago, the United States had three large manufacturers of passenger\naircraft. Today it has only one: Boeing, whose arrogance and incompetence can\nbe attributed to the lack of domestic competition. Thirty years ago, the\nUnited States had more than 50 prime defense contractors. Today it has only\nfive. Production delays, cost overruns, and vulnerable supply chains now\nthreaten national security. The hollowing out of rural America\u2014the loss of\nabout half of the nation\u2019s cattle ranchers, about 90 percent of its hog\nfarmers, and more than 90 percent of its dairy farmers since the Reagan\nera\u2014has fueled political extremism and a sense of desperation in the\nheartland.\n\nAnnie Lowery: Radical vegans are trying to change your diet\n\nMergers, acquisitions, and the creation of corporations of massive size and\nscope are typically justified on the basis of greater \u201cefficiency.\u201d But they\nare efficient only at centralizing profits and fostering inequality. During\nthe past three decades, adjusted for inflation, the hourly pay of American\nworkers has increased by about 18 percent\u2014and the annual compensation of CEOs\nat the largest American corporations has increased by about 1,300 percent. In\nCalifornia, where business groups have strongly opposed minimum-wage\nincreases, fast-food cooks and clerks had a median annual income of about\n$15,000 in 2020. The following year, the CEO of McDonald\u2019s was paid almost $20\nmillion. Throughout the economy, concentrated power keeps wages low. Despite\nall the business-school rationalizations and jargon, corporations usually buy\ntheir competitors for one simple reason: They don\u2019t want to compete with them.\n\nAnd ordinary people foot the bill, even if they\u2019re not aware of the actual\ncost. Market power and the capture of government regulatory agencies enable\nfood corporations to \u201cexternalize\u201d many of their business costs\u2014that is, to\nmake other people pay for them. Americans annually spend more than $1 trillion\non food. But that doesn\u2019t count the cost of foodborne illnesses, diet-related\nhealth problems, poverty wages, and the environmental degradation caused by\nour industrial food system. According to a study by the Rockefeller\nFoundation, the true cost of the food we consume is three times higher than\nwhat we think it is.\n\nThe FTC and the Justice Department during the Biden administration have\nrenewed the battle against monopoly power, reviving antitrust enforcement with\nsupport from some Republican members of Congress. On February 26, the FTC sued\nto block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, arguing that it would raise the\ncost of groceries and lower the wages of grocery workers. But the fight\nagainst oligopolies and monopolies won\u2019t be easy. A small number of\ncorporations have tremendous political influence, expensive attorneys, and\ngreat skill at rigging markets in ways the public just can\u2019t see.\n\nEric Schlosser is a contributing writer at The Atlantic.
