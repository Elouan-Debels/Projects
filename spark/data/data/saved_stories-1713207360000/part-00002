They added that\nmeasures designed to cut costs and tackle a backlog of papers \u2014 namely\nassigning copyediting tasks that were previously handled by Syntax\u2019s\nindependent editorial office to a production team without specialist knowledge\nof linguistics \u2014 meant the journal could \u201cno longer meet the needs of our\ncommunity\u201d.\n\nWiley says it will continue to publish and invest in Syntax. \u201cAny changes\nWiley has made to Syntax have been designed to facilitate the timely and high-\nquality publishing of the journal,\u201d says Allyn Molina, vice-president of\npublishing development.\n\nThe move is latest such event in what seems to be an emerging form of protest:\nthe mass resignation of academic editors.\n\nEditors quit top neuroscience journal to protest against open-access charges\n\nSo far this year, the editors of five journals have resigned together,\naccording to an unofficial tally by the website Retraction Watch. This\nfollowed 12 such moves in 2023, a big increase over the preceding years (there\nwere 2 such events in both 2021 and 2022). The tally starts in 2015, although\nearlier events have been recorded.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether mass resignations are set to become even more frequent,\nsays Michael Clarke, a publishing consultant at management-consultant firm\nClarke & Esposito in Washington DC. But he adds that they are getting a lot of\nattention. Many mass resignations, Clarke says, are in response to changes to\nbusiness models in the publishing industry.\n\nThis was the case for editors and editorial-board members of the journal\nCritical Public Health, published by Taylor & Francis, who resigned last July.\nThe journal\u2019s former co-editor-in-chief Judith Green, a sociologist at the\nUniversity of Exeter, UK, says that the move was prompted partly by the\npublisher\u2019s plans to make the journal open access. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we were\nopposed to the principle of open access,\u201d she says. Instead, the editors were\ndeeply opposed to the article-processing-charge model, in which authors are\ncharged fees to publish their papers open access. The team decided to resign\nonly after a year of discussions with the publisher about alternative models\nfailed to produce a compromise, Green says. A spokesperson for Taylor &\nFrancis referred Nature to a statement issued at the time of the resignation,\nsaying that the publisher was disappointed by the resignations, but was\nlooking forward to recruiting a new editorial team.\n\n\u201cThe big theme [of mass resignations] is this tension of competing\npriorities,\u201d says Ivan Oransky, co-founder of Retraction Watch. \u201cYou have\npublishers \u2014 most of them are for profit \u2014 that demand and require constant\ngrowth because that's what the stock market requires. You have researchers \u2014\nacademics or editors, for the most part, who champion quality and maybe depth\nand time to review. Those are in opposition.\u201d\n\n## More than a protest\n\nClarke says that he can see why editors who are dissatisfied might take\nmatters into their own hands. \u201cIf an academic community wishes to control the\nbusiness decisions of a journal, the best way to do that is to own the\njournal,\u201d he says. \u201cThese mass resignations were all cases where the editors\nwere working on journals owned by the publisher.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resignation is not so much the point. The point is creating an\nalternative top-quality channel of scholarly communication,\u201d says Abels, a\nlinguistics researcher at University College London.\n\nOpen-access row prompts editorial board of Elsevier journal to resign\n\nGroups of editors who resign sometimes go on to found new publications, over\nwhich they have more control. The former editors of Critical Public Health are\nin the process of setting up a new journal called The Journal of Critical\nPublic Health, hosted by the international Critical Public Health Network in\nEdinburgh, UK. A similar outcome resulted from the mass resignation of editors\nat Elsevier journal NeuroImage last April, who have since set up another\njournal hosted by the non-profit publisher MIT press.\n\nStephen Smith, a biomedical engineer at the University of Oxford, UK, was\neditor-in-chief of NeuroImage, and now holds the same role at the new journal,\nImaging Neuroscience, which launched in last July. He is pleased with what\ncame out of the mass resignation. \u201cThings are going extremely well,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAs of March 2024, we have received 700 submissions and published 125 papers.\u201d\n\nAbels and his colleagues plan to form a new journal, under a \u2018diamond\u2019 open-\naccess model in which there are no fees for authors or readers, hosted by the\nOpen Library of Humanities at Birkbeck, University of London. He says that the\neditors were galvanized to resign by earlier resignations, but adds that those\ntempted to resign should look beyond using the move as a protest. They should\nfocus instead on finding a home for a new journal and the academic community.\nSmith agrees: \u201cI think of our move as being more than just \u2018protest\u2019, which\nimplies that we academics lack the power to change the publication system\ndirectly.\u201d Such change can be achieved, Smith says, by \u201cstarting new journals\nthat are open, not-for-profit, and have high academic standards\u201d.\n\nNature 628, 244-245 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00887-y\n\n### Updates & Corrections\n\n  * Update 27 March 2024: This article has been updated to include comments from Wiley, which publishes Syntax.\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Editors quit top neuroscience journal to protest against open-access charges\n\n  * Open-access row prompts editorial board of Elsevier journal to resign\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Scientific community\n  * Publishing\n\n## Latest on:\n\nCitizenship privilege harms science\n\nComment 15 APR 24\n\n\u2018Shrugging off failure is hard\u2019: the $400-million grant setback that shaped\nthe Smithsonian lead scientist\u2019s career\n\nCareer Column 15 APR 24\n\nWhat the India election means for science\n\nNews 10 APR 24\n\nIs ChatGPT corrupting peer review?
