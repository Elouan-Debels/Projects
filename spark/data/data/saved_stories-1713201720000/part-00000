And the reality is\nBritain will probably never seize Russia\u2019s money.\n\nPlenty of bold words have been bandied about since Russia launched its illegal\ninvasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In Britain\u2019s capital \u2014 nicknamed\n\u201cLondongrad\u201d for its reputation as a playground for Russian oligarchs \u2014\nCabinet Minister Michael Gove called for the mansions of Russian magnates to\nbe seized to house Ukrainian refugees.\n\nOthers suggested taking the Russian assets in Britain\u2019s banks to help fund\nUkraine\u2019s defense, or to help rebuild Ukraine after the war.\n\nBut two years later, and despite much grandstanding, little has been done to\nseize Russian assets \u2014 whether those owned by the oligarchs or, more\nrealistically, those of the central bank.\n\nPOLITICO spoke to multiple sanctions lawyers and policy experts, all of whom\nsay that \u2014 regardless of political peacocking \u2014 there is and will never be any\nlegal standing to take frozen Russian money, property or other assets.\n\n\u201cThe British government is unlikely to be comfortable forging a brave new\nlegal order,\u201d said Anna Bradshaw, a sanctions lawyer at Peters and Peters.\n\nIn the months following the war, the U.K. froze some Russian assets, with\nseveral high-profile announcements including the forced sale of Roman\nAbramovich\u2019s Chelsea Football Club.\n\nThe government has never released official figures for the total value of\nRussian assets held in the U.K., but it\u2019s estimated that \u00a318 billion worth of\nindividual assets have been frozen so far, alongside around \u00a326 billion worth\nof Russian central bank assets in the U.K. It's a sizeable figure, although\ndwarfed by the \u20ac260 billion of Russian central bank assets in the EU.\n\nBut policy experts stress there are big differences between freezing assets\nand seizing them.\n\nThe freezing of assets is viewed as legally proportionate because it is a\ntemporary step. While authorities may use the profits generated by investing\nthe money, as the EU has agreed to do, the assets themselves will in theory be\nreturned at some point. Seizing them permanently, on the other hand, could\nhave massive legal ramifications.\n\nBritish MPs appear to be slowly waking up to that reality.\n\nHarriet Baldwin, a senior Conservative and chair of the influential Commons\nTreasury Committee, told POLITICO in March that the U.K. cannot \u201cgo out and\nseize people\u2019s assets randomly,\u201d as \u201cthat would make us a kleptocratic\nregime.\u201d\n\nHarriet Baldwin is a senior Conservative and chair of the influential Commons Treasury Committee. | Luke Dray/Getty Images\n\n### The negotiating table\n\nMinisters clearly see a difference between state and personal assets.\n\nEarlier this year, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron renewed calls for\nseizing Russia's frozen state assets \u2015 central bank investments in assets like\ngovernment bonds, currencies and gold.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Russia is going to have to pay reparations for its\nillegal invasion,\" Cameron told a crowd at Davos in January, \u201cso why not spend\nsome of the money now, rather than wait till the war is over and have all the\nlegal wrangling about reparations?\u201d\n\nHis words went down well with the many campaigners who believe the frozen\nmoney should be used to go towards victims of the war, or to help rebuild\nUkraine after the fighting is over.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. alone has frozen [billions] in Russian assets, and, together with\nallies have made commitments to support the defense, reconstruction and\nrecovery of Ukraine,\u201d said Rupert Skilbeck, director of REDRESS, a campaign\ngroup which has petitioned the government to seize Russian assets.\n\n\u201cA substantial proportion of these funds could also transform the lives of\nmillions of victims of human rights violations and crimes in Ukraine. Victims\ncannot wait until the war is over.\u201d\n\nBut waiting until the war is over is likely what will happen.\n\nBeyond the legal issues of seizing assets outright, U.K. officials are\nconscious that frozen Russian assets could be a useful tool in future peace\nnegotiations. Billions of pounds of frozen cash, along with treasured assets\nlike mansions and superyachts, are a pretty good card to play in any such\ntalks.\n\n\u201cIf you want to bring Putin to the negotiation table, what other tools do you\nhave left?\u201d said Freya Page, director of global outreach at Kharon, an\nanalytics firm which tracks sanctions, and a former head of guidance and\nengagement at Britain\u2019s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).\n\nConversely, she said, seizing the assets permanently would make such\nnegotiations less likely ever to take place.\n\n\u201cAsset seizure makes sanctions an ineffective tool because they're not doing\nwhat they're built to do,\u201d Page said. \u201cSanctions are not there to punish.\nThey're supposed to bring people to the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nA Western official \u2014 granted anonymity to speak candidly \u2014 also noted the\nreduced power of sanctions if the money is seized.\n\nU.K. officials are conscious that Russian assets could be a useful tool in future peace negotiations. | Valery Hache /AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe impose sanctions as a measure that is designed to be temporary and to\nrespond to a specific situation. But obviously, if you move to seize assets,\nthat is a permanent act,\u201d the official said.\n\n### Rule of law\n\nWhether and how to use Russia\u2019s frozen funds is a conversation currently\ntaking place all over the world.\n\nIn the U.S. there are strong bipartisan calls for assets to be seized, while\nin the EU, where the majority of assets are held, there is far more\ntrepidation \u2014 and far greater pressure to find a solution.\n\nAs the majority of assets are held at Euroclear, a securities depository in\nBelgium, an EU-wide agreement would be needed.\n\nSome countries, like France and Germany, remain unconvinced. But the bloc is\nsplit. Belgium welcomed proposals to use some of the profits from the assets\nto help Ukraine, while Estonia\u2019s Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, has called for\nthe West to seize assets before the U.S. election. The topic will be on the\ntable at June's G7 summit.\n\n\"In respect of seizing the underlying assets, the jurisdiction you really need\non board \u2014 the European Union \u2014 is not yet prepared to take that step,\u201d said\nFrancis Bond, a sanctions lawyer at Macfarlanes. \u201cRecent statements by both\nthe Commission and member states indicate consensus on this issue is still\nsome way off.\"\n\nBut even if Britain agreed in the G7 to partake in the confiscation of state\nassets, lawyers believe there's little chance that personal assets are going\nanywhere.\n\nAlthough all jurisdictions are nervous of the potential legal and financial\nramifications of taking the money \u2014 they fear it could deter investment in the\ncurrency or put other countries off depositing funds at the central bank \u2014\nBritain is particularly worried about the breach of legal norms.\n\nGovernments which seize individuals\u2019 privately-owned assets \u201cstart rewriting\nthe basic principles that underpin most legal systems when it comes to\ninterference with property rights, and the right to a fair trial,\u201d said\nBradshaw.\n\nThere is \u201cno direct legal precedent\u201d for asset seizure, said Bond. \"It's\nentirely uncharted legal territory.\u201d\n\nTom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at the Royal United Services Institute\n(RUSI) think tank, told POLITICO that a German government official said to him\nin June 2022: \u201cYou do not want to start taking assets off people just because\nyou don\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\nKeatinge said he agrees with that sentiment. \u201cWe need to follow the rule of\nlaw, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nThe City fears risking its reputation as a leading place to invest. | Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe City of London\u2019s outsized influence is also a significant factor.\n\nThe City fears risking its reputation as a leading place to invest \u2014 and, a\ncynic might say, as a hotbed for dirty money. Labour MP Margaret Hodge told\nPOLITICO in an interview in March that she believes \u201cthe financial services\nsector is putting huge pressure on the government not to act\u201d on seizing\nRussian assets.\n\nBut it may be preaching to the choir. A sanctions lawyer who spoke to POLITICO\nunder condition of anonymity questioned whether much pressure was required.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [the financial services industry] needs to lobby against it,\nbecause [the U.K. government are] clearly incredibly cautious about doing this\nanyway,\u201d they said.\n\n### Election klaxon\n\nOn the face of it, the looming U.K. general election presents the perfect\nopportunity for the opposition Labour Party to make hay with demands that\nRussia pays the price of its illegal invasion.\n\nChris Bryant, a senior Labour MP, put forward a bill in Feb. 2023 designed to\nforce the government to come up with a plan to seize assets within 60 days. It\nwas blocked by the Tory government.\n\nLast summer, Labour demanded a plan within 90 days from the government on how\nRussian assets could be seized \u2014 but has since gone quiet.\n\nIt\u2019s representative of the wavering political impetus.\n\nFor the Conservative Party, talking big about taking Russia\u2019s money plays well\nwith the electorate, but there\u2019s little drive to take real action given the\nknotty problem will \u2014 if opinion polls are to be believed \u2014 likely be the\nincoming Labour government\u2019s to deal with before the end of the year.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped some within the Conservative party being furious at the\nslow progress. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader who now chairs the\nAll Party Parliamentary Group on Magnitsky Sanctions, told POLITICO his group\nhas been \u201ccalling for the seizure of assets for some time.\"\n\nHe complained: \u201cThe progress is slow and the U.K. is now lagging behind the\nU.S. and Canada, and EU states such as Belgium and Estonia, all of whom are\ntaking steps to confiscate or redirect gathered funds to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe confiscation of assets raises significant legal, political and economic\nquestions, which must be considered, but are not insurmountable with advice\nfrom experts. The government has been dragging its feet on this and needs to\ncatch up with the others,\u201d Duncan Smith added.\n\nOrganizations like REDRESS insist confiscating the funds for good is justified\nunder international law as a countermeasure to the invasion of Ukraine if it\nis intended to induce Russia to end its illegal war and provide reparation.\n\nBut lawyers are unconvinced, citing basic international obligations under\ninstitutions like the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThey point out that while most Russian oligarchs got rich by acquiring former\nstate assets cheaply in the chaotic decade following the Soviet Union's\ncollapse, those who kept on the right side of Vladimir Putin were able to\nlegitimize their fortunes.\n\n\u201cAny country signed on to the ECHR would have significant difficulty\nconfiscating someone's private property unless they have committed a crime,\nrather than simply because they've been deemed by a very low evidential bar to\nbe linked to the Russian state,\u201d said Bond, the sanctions lawyer from\nMacfarlanes.\n\n\u201cEven if only the net profits, rather than the underlying assets, are seized,\nthere are going to be years if not decades of international lawsuits,\u201d said\nBond.\n\nThe conclusion many appear to be coming to is that the desire to take Russia\u2019s\nmoney is overshadowed by complex legal matters.\n\n\u201cAs a human being, you want to seize the assets,\u201d said Page. \u201cBut you start to\nget a little bit more free with the law. And when you start using the law\nhowever you please, it loses its power.\u201d\n\nRelated Tags\n\nBanks Bonds British politics Central banks Currencies Currency Defense\nElections Finance Financial crime/fraud Financial Services Human rights\nInvestment Negotiations Refugees Risk and compliance Rule of Law Russia\nsanctions Sanctions Services Tanks U.S. elections War War in Ukraine\n\nRelated Countries\n\nBelgium Canada Estonia France Germany Russia Soviet Union Ukraine United\nKingdom United States\n\nRelated People\n\nChris Bryant David Cameron Iain Duncan Smith Kaja Kallas Margaret Hodge\nMichael Gove Vladimir Putin\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nConservative Party ECHR G7 Labour Party U.K. Foreign\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 to step in as EU justice chief\n\n1 HR ago 2 mins read\n\n## Macron: France intercepted Iranian drones \u2018at Jordan\u2019s request\u2019\n\n3 HRS ago 2 mins read\n\nOpinion\n\n## EU migration policy could turn into a race to the bottom \u2014 even for\nUkrainians\n\n9 HRS ago 5 mins read\n\n## Don\u2019t assume von der Leyen is coming back\n\n9 HRS ago 9 mins read\n\n## More from Eleanor Myers\n\n## A decade of pension freedoms\n\nSNEAK PEEK \u2014 Ten years since Osborne\u2019s pension freedoms announced. \u2014 Rachel\nReeves outlines a Labour economic recovery. \u2014 Treasury Committee looks at HMRC\nloan charge.
