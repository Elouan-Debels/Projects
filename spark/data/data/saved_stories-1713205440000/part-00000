Open existing Photos library\n  2. Export unmodified originals\n  3. Close and reopen Photos, holding the option key\n  4. Create a new library\n  5. Select all the unmodified originals and drag them into the new library\n\nThis should all be perfunctory, but when I do this the photos/videos start\nbeing added to the new Photos library and about 10% of the way in it errors\nwith:\n\n> Some items cannot be added to your Photo library because they may be an\n> unrecognisable file format or the file may not contain valid data.\n\nThis is on a 2023 MBP with plenty of free disk space and the latest macOS\nSonoma 14.4.1 (23E224).\n\nNB In case you're wondering why I'd export files from a library and create a\nnew library from the exact same files, it's because I wanted to be 100% sure\nthis would work before I back them up for safe keeping. Lucky I tested this,\nbecause indeed, it does not work.\n\n### Update\n\nI tried for several hours to get this to work. I tried all permutations of\nexport options (particularly around naming - e.g. sequential etc) and import\noptions (e.g. drop and drag is one way, the File -> Import -> Import new /\nImport all). Every permutation failed; either erroring the same way as\ndescribed above, or importing some tiny subset of the total photos^1, or\nsimply stopping what it was doing and not doing anything (I left my laptop for\nmany minutes in case it was 'thinking' and checked Activity Monitor but there\nwas extremely little activity).\n\nFWIW: my solution\n\nThis solution loses location data and other photo/video metadata, but I will\nexport all photos/videos out of Photos libraries and into more versatile\nformats (i.e. normal photo/video files that can be viewed without Photos app).\nI feel far less stressed just typing this solution, as Photos app has been\nextremely time consuming and has many dangerous bugs^2.\n\n^1 _Difficult to explain, but File -> Import -> (Import new | Import selected) both import subsets of all the implied photos/videos - extremely dangerous as this false-positive signals to the user that it imported the implied photos/videos when it did not; the user has to notice this (by either it taking suspiciously little time or noticing the number of files is wrong - too small); otherwise they may assume it worked and lose precious memories forever when they disregard the unmodified originals.\n\n^2 _One example is when selecting items to import, command + a (select all)\ndoesn't select all (!!) instead, selecting files in a pattern described by 'a\nfew dozen consecutive files, then a few dozen missed, repeated for all the\nfiles'. Extremely dangerous as the user only sees a tiny fraction of their\nfiles and, if they're selected, could reasonably assume that 'Select all'\nselected all of them.\n\n  * macos\n  * photos\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited 1 hour ago\n\nstevec\n\nasked 10 hours ago\n\nstevecstevec\n\n4,9751111 gold badges4747 silver badges8282 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## 0\n\nReset to default\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nBrowse other questions tagged\n\n  * macos\n  * photos\n\n.\n\n  * The Overflow Blog\n  * Diverting more backdoor disasters\n\n  * Featured on Meta\n  * New Focus Styles & Updated Styling for Button Groups\n\n  * Upcoming initiatives on Stack Overflow and across the Stack Exchange network\n\n#### Related\n\n0\n\nHow to import older Aperture photo library after setting up new Photos app and\na new library\n\n2\n\nExport unmodified originals from Photos.app and NOT creating duplicates\n\n46\n\nHow to export photos from the new Photos app in full quality?\n\n1\n\nHow to remove photos without masters from library in OS X Photos app?\n\n4\n\nTrouble with importing photos from iPhone to Mac when I have enabled iCloud\nPhoto Library and selected \"Optimize iPhone Storage\"\n\n3\n\nError when importing photos from iCloud to Photos on macOS: \"The operation\ncouldn't be completed.
