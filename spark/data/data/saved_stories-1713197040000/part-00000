The post is structured as a step-by-\nstep learning journey. This is intended to be a regularly updated list.\n\n## 101 - Basic introductions\n\na) Andrej Karpathy\u2019s - Intro to Large Language Models\n\n  * This video provides a general and high-level introduction to LLMs, covering topics such as inference, scaling, fine-tuning, security concerns, and prompt injection.\n\nb) Nvidia\u2019s Generative AI explained\n\n  * Note: This course would require you to login to nvidia first and then details are visible.\n  * This video gives a very high level overview of GenAI, its usage, applications that companies are targeting, etc.\n\n## 102 - Courses that cover basic usage\n\na) Microsoft\u2019s Generative AI for Beginners\n\n  * I personally have found this to be a excellent course that touches LLMs, prompting, RAG, Agents, multi modals etc.\n\nb) Google\u2019s Cloud Skills Boost\n\n  * Havent gone through this personally, but content looks ok.\n\n## 103 - Prompt engineering\n\nNote that prompt engineering techniques may seem generic, but in practice\nevery family of models generally have specific things that work for them. If\nyou change models, the prompts may need to be adjusted for better results.\n(E.g Claude 2.x worked great with XML tags for constraints or 1 shot examples,\nGPT4 worked better with JSON)\n\na) Microsoft\u2019s Introduction to prompt engineering\n\nb) OpenAI\u2019s Prompt engineering guide\n\nc) Anthropic Claude\u2019s Prompt engineering guide\n\n## 201 - LLMs\n\na) Andrej Karpathy\u2019s State of GPT\n\n  * Covers things like tokenization to pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Also, practical techniques and mental models for the effective use of these models, including prompting strategies, fine-tuning, etc are covered.\n\nb) Visual Introduction: LLMs by Bycroft\n\n  * Excellent visualizations and explanations of LLMs using nanoGPT, GPT2, GPT3\n  * Understanding the visualizations is slightly involved, most probably a 301 rather than 201, but glancing through also can help to some extent.\n\n## 301 - Deep Dive into Gen AI / Machine Learning\n\na) Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning Introduction\n\n  * The definitive course to dive into ML. Updated for covering GenAI too. (94 hrs)\n\nb) Fast.ai\u2019s Course\n\nc) Andrej Karpathy\u2019s Zero to Hero\n\n  * This is a youtube series that will build a GPT from scratch.\n\nd) 3Blue1Browns Season 3 - Neural networks\n\n  * Ideal course will be to take from season 1 to 4 to understand things end to end.\n\ne) Google\u2019s Cloud Skills Boost for Advanced Devs\n\n  * I am skeptical about this learning path, but some folks have found this useful.\n\n## 401 - Miscellaneous\n\na) Stanford AI Courses\n\nb) Nvidias deep learning institute\n\n  * The institute has some interesting learning paths that are self paced.\n  * Free as well as paid content present.\n\nc) Tools and more extensive resources list at awesome-generative-ai\n\n## Journey recommendation and conclusion\n\nIt is important to tailor the learning journey based on personal interests and\ngoals. If you are interested in consumption of LLM\u2019s, having a basic\nunderstanding of concepts in 10x and 20x should be enough.\n\nFor folks interested specifically in text or code generation, I would\nrecommend understanding below key areas:\n\n  1. Text Completion/Inference\n  2. Prompt engineering\n  3. Function Calling\n  4. RAG (Retrieve, Attend, Generate)\n  5. Agents\n\nThinking of a use-case of interest and starting with coding it as early as\npossible along with above material gives best results in this authors\nexperience.\n\nIf possible, avoid libraries (For Python, LLamaIndex and Langchain are the\nmost popular ones as of now), when learning and try to write your own code.\nCalling APIs in python or any other language is generally very straight\nforward (chat gpt with gpt-3.5 should be able to give that code very easily).\n\nLibraries add a layer of abstraction that creates more impedance, than help\nduring learning phase. I myself was able to pickup typescript, react, etc very\neasily using GPT\u2019s and its APIs. One early experience is documented in this\npost . The open source FlexiGPT vscode plugin is an outcome of my personal AI\njourney.\n\nHappy learning !!!\n\nFinding My Balance: An Evolved and Simplified Task Management System\n\n## Related Posts\n\nFinding My Balance: An Evolved and Simplified Task Management System\n\nJuly 30, 2023\n\nBlunt/Direct/Assertive Communicators, Online Communication Challenges and How\nto Overcome Them\n\nJuly 10, 2023\n\nSurvival Mode, Life Immediately After and Paul Graham's How to Do Great Work\n\nJuly 2, 2023\n\nMy Go-to Espresso Recipe - An Everyday Brew\n\nJune 2, 2023\n\nRemembering My Friend\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\nTaxonomies\n\nSoftware-Tools 16 Life 5 Papers 3 Systems-Design 3 Architecture 1 Coffee 1\nMovie 1 Programming 1\n\nlinux 9 utilities 9 commands 8 scripts 4 ubuntu 4 distributed-systems 2 golang\n2 guidelines 2 profiling 2 python 2 ALL 29\n\n2024 1 2023 6 2022 2 2020 2\n\nPosts\n\n  * Great Resources for Learning Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n  * Finding My Balance: An Evolved and Simplified Task Management System\n\nJuly 30, 2023\n\n  * Blunt/Direct/Assertive Communicators, Online Communication Challenges and How to Overcome Them\n\nJuly 10, 2023\n\n  * Survival Mode, Life Immediately After and Paul Graham's How to Do Great Work\n\nJuly 2, 2023\n\n  * My Go-to Espresso Recipe - An Everyday Brew\n\nJune 2, 2023\n\n## Contents\n\nContents\n\nActions\n\nTwitter Facebook\n\nGo back Reload Copy URL\n\nScramblings\n\nDev scratchpad.
