Pic: ESO/M. Kornmesser\n\nScientists from the European Southern Observatory's Gaia mission noticed the\nblack hole after a star was spotted wobbling as it orbited the area. It has\nbeen named Gaia BH3.\n\n\"No one was expecting to find a high-mass black hole lurking nearby,\nundetected so far,\" said Pasquale Panuzzo, an astronomer from the National\nCentre for Scientific Research at the Observatoire de Paris.\n\n\"This is the kind of discovery you make once in your research life.\"\n\nImportant clues\n\nGaia BH3 is the second-closest black hole to Earth, sitting in the Aquila\nconstellation, which means \"the eagle\" in Latin. From Earth, the constellation\nis thought to form the shape of an eagle.\n\nThe \"wobbly\" star orbiting it is thought to give important clues as to how the\nblack hole was formed, as stars in pairs tend to be similar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Tim Peake hopes to return to space UK prototype could pave way for\nconstant energy from space Incredible footage of total solar eclipse from\nspace\n\nImage: Pic: ESO/Digitized Sky Survey 2. Acknowledgement: D. De Martin\n\nHow are stellar black holes formed?\n\nAs stars reach the end of their lives, most of them inflate, lose mass and\ncool to form \"white dwarfs\".\n\nStellar black holes are thought to form when a star doesn't contain heavy\nelements and loses less mass over its lifetime - these are called \"metal-poor\"\nstars. Then, instead of changing and cooling into a white dwarf, it collapses\nin on itself and forms a black hole.\n\nGaia BH3's companion star is a very metal-poor star which suggests that the\nstar that collapsed to form BH3 was also metal-poor.\n\nThere are around 50 stellar black holes that scientists have discovered in the\nMilky Way, according to NASA.\n\nIn January, scientists discovered the oldest black hole ever, dating back to\nthe early universe more than 13 billion years ago.\n\nSpotted using the James Webb Space Telescope, that black hole is devouring an\nancient galaxy called GN-z11 - 13.4 billion light years away. The universe is\ncalculated to be 13.7 billion years old.\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * Space\n\n## Sky News Footer\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n\n### About Sky News\n\n  * About Us\n  * Sky News Profiles\n  * Sky News International\n  * Sky News Library Sales\n  * Site Map\n  * Editorial Guidelines\n  * Sky News Board\n\n### Sky News Services\n\n  * Sky News RSS\n  * Sky News For Your Phone\n  * Sky News Radio\n\n### Sky Channels\n\n  * Sky Witness\n  * Sky Atlantic\n  * Sky Arts\n  * Sky Cinema\n  * Sky Sports\n\n### More Sky Sites\n\n  * NOW\n  * Sky Zero\n  * Sky Academy Studios\n  * Bigger Picture\n  * Sky Group\n  * Sky Bet\n  * Sky.com\n  * Sky News Arabia\n  * Advertise With Us\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * Privacy Options\n  * Accessibility\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sky UK\n\n", "frontpage": false}
