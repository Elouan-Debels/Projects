Washington - April 16, 2024 - Today, the LF AI & Data Foundation\nproudly announces the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) as its latest\nSandbox Project. This pioneering initiative unites industry leaders, including\nAnyscale, Cloudera, Datastax, Domino Data Lab, Hugging Face, Intel, KX,\nMariaDB Foundation, Minio, Qdrant, Red Hat, SAS, VMware (acquired by\nBroadcom), Yellowbrick Data, Zilliz and more to champion the development of\nopen, multi-provider, robust, and composable GenAI systems.\n\nThe mission of LF AI & Data is to build and support an open artificial\nintelligence (AI) and data community and drive open source innovation in the\nAI and data domains by enabling collaboration and the creation of new\nopportunities for all members of the community. OPEA aims to facilitate and\nenable the development of flexible, scalable GenAI systems that harness the\nbest open source innovation from across the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe're thrilled to welcome OPEA to LF AI & Data with the promise to offer open\nsource, standardized, modular and heterogenous Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) pipelines for enterprises with a focus on open model development,\nhardened and optimized support of various compilers and toolchains. On this\nfoundation, enterprises can accelerate containerized AI integration and\ndelivery, as well as new unique vertical use cases. OPEA will unlock new\npossibilities in AI by creating a detailed, composable framework that stands\nat the forefront of technology stacks. This initiative is a testament to our\nmission to drive open source innovation and collaboration within the AI and\ndata communities under a neutral and open governance model.\" - Ibrahim Haddad,\nExecutive Director at LF AI & Data.\n\nOPEA is emerging at a crucial juncture when GenAI projects, particularly those\nutilizing RAG, are becoming increasingly popular for their capacity to unlock\nsignificant value from existing data repositories.\n\nThe swift advancement in GenAI technology, however, has led to a fragmentation\nof tools, techniques, and solutions. OPEA intends to address this issue by\ncollaborating with the industry to standardize components, including\nframeworks, architecture blueprints and reference solutions that showcase\nperformance, interoperability, trustworthiness and enterprise-grade readiness.\n\n\u201cIntel is at the forefront of incubating open source development to build\ntrusted, scalable open infrastructure that enables heterogeneity and provides\na platform for developer innovation. Generative AI is at this moment; OPEA,\nwith the support of the broader community, will address critical pain points\nof RAG adoption and scale today. It will also define a platform for the next\nphases of developer innovation that harnesses the potential value generative\nAI can bring to enterprises and all our lives.\u201d - Melissa Evers, Vice\nPresident of Software Engineering Group and General Manager of Strategy to\nExecution, Intel.\n\nThe LF AI & Data Foundation invites other organizations and individuals\npassionate about advancing open source AI and data to join the OPEA project\nand contribute to shaping the future of enterprise AI.

OPEA's vision\naligns with our commitment to open, flexible, governed AI innovation, and\nwe're proud to support it alongside Intel.\" - Thomas Robinson, COO at Domino\nData Lab\n\nHugging Face\n\n\"Hugging Face's mission is to democratize good machine learning and maximize\nits positive impact across industries and society. By joining OPEA's open-\nsource consortium to accelerate Generative AI value to enterprise, we will be\nable to continue advancing open models and simplify GenAI adoption.\" - Julien\nSimon, Chief Evangelist at Hugging Face\n\nKX\n\n\u201cCollaborative, open-source projects like OPEA fuel our excitement for the\nfuture of gen AI because of the ability it has to drive acceleration of both\ninnovation and adoption within enterprise organizations. The power of RAG is\nundeniable, and its integration into gen AI creates a ballast of truth that\nenables businesses to confidently tap into their data and use it to grow their\nbusiness.\u201d - Michael Gilfix, Chief Product and Engineering Officer at KX\n\nMariaDB Foundation\n\n\u201cAs GenAI matures, integration into existing IT is a natural and necessary\nstep. The world needs GenAI and vectors as part of a general purpose RDBMS,\nand we have already demonstrated our ability to deliver this through MariaDB\nServer. We see huge opportunities for core MariaDB users - and users of the\nrelated MySQL Server \u2013 to build RAG solutions. It's logical to keep the source\ndata, the AI vector data, and the output data in one and the same RDBMS. The\nOPEA community, as part of LF AI & Data, is an obvious entity to simplify\nEnterprise GenAI adoption.\u201d - Kaj Arn\u00f6, CEO of MariaDB Foundation\n\nMinio\n\n\u201cThe OPEA initiative is crucial for the future of AI development. Advocating\nfor a foundation of open source and standards - from datasets to formats to\nAPIs and models, enables organizations and enterprises to build transparently.\nThe AI data infrastructure must also be built on these open principles. Only\nby having open source and open standard solutions, from models to\ninfrastructure and down to the data are we able to create trust, ensure\ntransparency and promote accountability.\u201d - AB Periasamy, CEO and co-Founder,\nMinIO\n\nQdrant\n\n\"As the leading open-source vector database technology provider, Qdrant is\nexcited to support the launch of the OPEA, underscoring the importance of open\nstandards in AI for innovation and data sovereignty. Our commitment to these\nprinciples is rooted in our core, and we look forward to contributing to an\necosystem where AI thrives with a deep respect for data ownership.\" - Andre\nZayarni, CEO & Co-founder at Qdrant\n\nRed Hat\n\n\u201cAs gen AI continues to advance, open source is playing a critical role in the\nstandardization and democratization of models, frameworks, platforms and the\ntools needed to help enterprises realize value from AI. Red Hat is excited\nabout the potential for AI innovation for our customers through the Open\nPlatform for Enterprise AI.\" - Steven Huels, vice president and general\nmanager, AI Business Unit, Red Hat\n\nSAS\n\n\"With the potential that generative AI has to shape our future and the ways we\ndo business, it\u2019s imperative that we tap into the power of collaboration for\ninnovation and accuracy in enterprise AI. We're excited to be a part of the\nnewest AI & Data Sandbox project and to work with other industry leaders on\nOPEA. - Shadi Shahin VP, Product Strategy, SAS\n\nVMware (acquired by Broadcom)\n\n\u201cWe are seeing tremendous enthusiasm among our customer base for RAG, with\norganizations deploying RAG applications on-premises to empower employees and\ncustomers to find the information they need faster, creating greater\nefficiencies in customer service and document search. The constructs behind\nRAG can be universally applied to a variety of use cases, making a community-\ndriven approach that drives consistency and interoperability for RAG\napplications an important step forward in helping all organizations to safely\nembrace the many benefits that AI has to offer.\u201d \u2013 Chris Wolf, Global Head of\nAI and Advanced Services at Broadcom\n\nYellowbrick Data\n\n\"We are pleased to collaborate with the Open Platform for Enterprise AI\n(OPEA), which offers essential guidance in a dense and complex market. Within\nOPEA, Yellowbrick serves as a data provider\u2014recognizing data as the crucial\nfuel for AI. Our data warehouse incorporates advanced vector capabilities,\nenabling seamless integration of AI with current systems and workflows. This\nensures that AI augments rather than interrupts business processes,\nsimplifying AI adoption.\u201d - Mark, Cusack, CTO, Yellowbrick Data\n\nZilliz\n\n\"We firmly believe that vector databases are integral to the future of open\ngenerative AI, which is why we donated the Milvus vector database to the Linux\nFoundation back in 2020. Our support of OPEA is an extension of that\ncommitment to creating a framework alongside Intel that fosters extensible,\naccessible, and scalable AI platforms for enterprise developers.\" - Charles\nXie, CEO & Founder of Zilliz\n\n###\n\n## About LF AI & Data Foundation\n\nLF AI & Data is an umbrella foundation of the Linux Foundation that supports\nopen source innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and data.
