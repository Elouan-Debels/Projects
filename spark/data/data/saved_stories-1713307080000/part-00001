Multiple companies have designed chips tailored to AI\nto reduce power draw. But they\u2019re all based on one fundamental rule\u2014they use\nelectricity.\n\nThis month, a team from Tsinghua University in China switched up the recipe.\nThey built a neural network chip that uses light rather than electricity to\nrun AI tasks at a fraction of the energy cost of NVIDIA\u2019s H100, a state-of-\nthe-art chip used to train and run AI models.\n\nCalled Taichi, the chip combines two types of light-based processing into its\ninternal structure. Compared to previous optical chips, Taichi is far more\naccurate for relatively simple tasks such as recognizing hand-written numbers\nor other images. Unlike its predecessors, the chip can generate content too.\nIt can make basic images in a style based on the Dutch artist Vincent van\nGogh, for example, or classical musical numbers inspired by Johann Sebastian\nBach.\n\nPart of Taichi\u2019s efficiency is due to its structure. The chip is made of\nmultiple components called chiplets. Similar to the brain\u2019s organization, each\nchiplet performs its own calculations in parallel, the results of which are\nthen integrated with the others to reach a solution.\n\nFaced with a challenging problem of separating images over 1,000 categories,\nTaichi was successful nearly 92 percent of the time, matching current chip\nperformance, but slashing energy consumption over a thousand-fold.\n\nFor AI, \u201cthe trend of dealing with more advanced tasks [is] irreversible,\u201d\nwrote the authors. \u201cTaichi paves the way for large-scale photonic [light-\nbased] computing,\u201d leading to more flexible AI with lower energy costs.\n\n## Chip on the Shoulder\n\nToday\u2019s computer chips don\u2019t mesh well with AI.\n\nPart of the problem is structural. Processing and memory on traditional chips\nare physically separated. Shuttling data between them takes up enormous\namounts of energy and time.\n\nWhile efficient for solving relatively simple problems, the setup is\nincredibly power hungry when it comes to complex AI, like the large language\nmodels powering ChatGPT.\n\nThe main problem is how computer chips are built. Each calculation relies on\ntransistors, which switch on or off to represent the 0s and 1s used in\ncalculations. Engineers have dramatically shrunk transistors over the decades\nso they can cram ever more onto chips. But current chip technology is cruising\ntowards a breaking point where we can\u2019t go smaller.\n\nScientists have long sought to revamp current chips. One strategy inspired by\nthe brain relies on \u201csynapses\u201d\u2014the biological \u201cdock\u201d connecting neurons\u2014that\ncompute and store information at the same location. These brain-inspired, or\nneuromorphic, chips slash energy consumption and speed up calculations. But\nlike current chips, they rely on electricity.\n\nAnother idea is to use a different computing mechanism altogether: light.\n\u201cPhotonic computing\u201d is \u201cattracting ever-growing attention,\u201d wrote the\nauthors. Rather than using electricity, it may be possible to hijack light\nparticles to power AI at the speed of light.\n\n## Let There Be Light\n\nCompared to electricity-based chips, light uses far less power and can\nsimultaneously tackle multiple calculations. Tapping into these properties,\nscientists have built optical neural networks that use photons\u2014particles of\nlight\u2014for AI chips, instead of electricity.\n\nThese chips can work two ways. In one, chips scatter light signals into\nengineered channels that eventually combine the rays to solve a problem.\nCalled diffraction, these optical neural networks pack artificial neurons\nclosely together and minimize energy costs. But they can\u2019t be easily changed,\nmeaning they can only work on a single, simple problem.\n\nA different setup depends on another property of light called interference.\nLike ocean waves, light waves combine and cancel each other out. When inside\nmicro-tunnels on a chip, they can collide to boost or inhibit each other\u2014these\ninterference patterns can be used for calculations. Chips based on\ninterference can be easily reconfigured using a device called an\ninterferometer. Problem is, they\u2019re physically bulky and consume tons of\nenergy.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of accuracy. Even in the sculpted channels often used\nfor interference experiments, light bounces and scatters, making calculations\nunreliable. For a single optical neural network, the errors are tolerable. But\nwith larger optical networks and more sophisticated problems, noise rises\nexponentially and becomes untenable.\n\nThis is why light-based neural networks can\u2019t be easily scaled up. So far,\nthey\u2019ve only been able to solve basic tasks, such as recognizing numbers or\nvowels.\n\n\u201cMagnifying the scale of existing architectures would not proportionally\nimprove the performances,\u201d wrote the team.\n\n## Double Trouble\n\nThe new AI, Taichi, combined the two traits to push optical neural networks\ntowards real-world use.\n\nRather than configuring a single neural network, the team used a chiplet\nmethod, which delegated different parts of a task to multiple functional\nblocks. Each block had its own strengths: One was set up to analyze\ndiffraction, which could compress large amounts of data in a short period of\ntime. Another block was embedded with interferometers to provide interference,\nallowing the chip to be easily reconfigured between tasks.\n\nCompared to deep learning, Taichi took a \u201cshallow\u201d approach whereby the task\nis spread across multiple chiplets.\n\nWith standard deep learning structures, errors tend to accumulate over layers\nand time. This setup nips problems that come from sequential processing in the\nbud. When faced with a problem, Taichi distributes the workload across\nmultiple independent clusters, making it easier to tackle larger problems with\nminimal errors.\n\nThe strategy paid off.\n\nTaichi has the computational capacity of 4,256 total artificial neurons, with\nnearly 14 million parameters mimicking the brain connections that encode\nlearning and memory. When sorting images into 1,000 categories, the photonic\nchip was nearly 92 percent accurate, comparable to \u201ccurrently popular\nelectronic neural networks,\u201d wrote the team.\n\nThe chip also excelled in other standard AI image-recognition tests, such as\nidentifying hand-written characters from different alphabets.\n\nAs a final test, the team challenged the photonic AI to grasp and recreate\ncontent in the style of different artists and musicians. When trained with\nBach\u2019s repertoire, the AI eventually learned the pitch and overall style of\nthe musician. Similarly, images from van Gogh or Edvard Munch\u2014the artist\nbehind the famous painting, The Scream\u2014fed into the AI allowed it to generate\nimages in a similar style, although many looked like a toddler\u2019s recreation.\n\nOptical neural networks still have much further to go. But if used broadly,\nthey could be a more energy-efficient alternative to current AI systems.\nTaichi is over 100 times more energy efficient than previous iterations. But\nthe chip still requires lasers for power and data transfer units, which are\nhard to condense.\n\nNext, the team is hoping to integrate readily available mini lasers and other\ncomponents into a single, cohesive photonic chip. Meanwhile, they hope Taichi\nwill \u201caccelerate the development of more powerful optical solutions\u201d that\ncould eventually lead to \u201ca new era\u201d of powerful and energy-efficient AI.\n\nImage Credit: spainter_vfx / Shutterstock.com\n\n  * Tags\n  * Artificial Intelligence\n  * Computing\n\nShare\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddIt\n\nEmail\n\nCopy URL\n\nShelly Fanhttps://neurofantastic.com/\n\nShelly Xuelai Fan is a neuroscientist-turned-science writer.
