He worked at PayPal and Facebook before\nfounding the video platform and, later, helped lead its $1.65 billion\nacquisition by Google. After working on multiple other startups in Silicon\nValley, Chen moved to Taipei in 2019 and has been investing in early-stage\ntech startups.\n\nIn 2023, Taiwan\u2019s startup ecosystem ranked 24th globally, behind other East\nAsian countries, including Singapore, China, Japan, and South Korea. A lack of\nfunding, a small population of 24 million, and the government\u2019s long-standing\nfocus on the semiconductor sector have challenged the growth of tech startups.\nChen is trying to bridge the gap by connecting Taiwan with Silicon Valley\ninvestors.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\n### What brought you to Taiwan?\n\nI had been in Silicon Valley for 20 years and had conducted just about\neverything, from joining a startup to working on a startup and co-founding a\nstartup \u2014 everything from PayPal and Facebook to YouTube.\n\nIt just so happened that I was remodeling the house a little bit in Silicon\nValley. So I thought, instead of renting a house next door, I would move to\nTaiwan, almost as a new startup experience.\n\n### In terms of running startups, what are the cultural shocks you have run\ninto in Taiwan?\n\nI think one great experience I had was actually trying to create a startup on\nmy own in Taiwan. It was called Brewing [designed to offer digital medical\nservices]. It didn\u2019t make it too far, but I think what was more valuable from\nthat experience was being able to hire a team of startup engineers to try to\ncreate a global product from inside Taiwan.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, my experience with startups, especially with junior\nengineers, is that everybody is almost on equal footing as far as ideas go. In\nTaiwan, many of the employees have never really lived and experienced life\noutside of Taiwan. So it\u2019s a bit difficult for them to come up with ideas for\na target audience that they aren\u2019t part of.\n\n### What are the reasons few global startups are based in Taiwan?\n\nEvery successful company, especially in its early stages, needs at least three\nthings: good founders with good ideas, good staff, and funding. Taiwan by\nitself ranks near the top when it comes to the engineers, designers, product\nmanagers, but it lags behind on the venture capital and investment side. It\nlags behind when it comes to founders and entrepreneurs with global\nexperience. When you have good engineers but they don\u2019t have a lot of\nexperience outside of Taiwan, you start moving more into the hardware side\nbecause it doesn\u2019t require language or cultural knowledge.\n\n### What are you doing these days to connect Silicon Valley with Taiwan and\nsupport local innovation?\n\nI\u2019m mostly working on the angel investment level, creating funds and\nconnecting companies with funds. I\u2019m also helping some funds in the U.S. make\ninvestments in Taiwan. And with established companies that I\u2019m already working\nwith outside of Taiwan, I\u2019m making those connections to enable collaborations\nand partnerships. I\u2019m also working with other entrepreneurs that have moved to\nTaiwan, including Kevin Lin, a co-founder of Twitch.\n\nTaiwan has this Gold Card program [a government scheme to attract foreign\ntalent] that brings in folks from overseas that have started companies before.\nWe have started Gold Card networking events for serial entrepreneurs who are\nliving here.\n\nWe have a wide network of connections with these entrepreneurs in Silicon\nValley, many of whom have Taiwanese-American roots. We can also explore\nfunding from Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau, and Dubai \u2014 places that have capital\nbut lag behind in engineers.\n\nViola Zhou is a Rest of World reporter based in New York City.\n\nRead more stories\n\nRegional Champions\n\nThe startup offering free toilets and coffee for delivery workers \u2014 in\nexchange for their data\n\nArgentine startup Nippy aggregates data from gig workers and sells it to\ncompanies like Mastercard and Movistar, who in turn offer workers their\nservices.\n\nBy Daniela Dib\n\nThe Rise of AI\n\n2024 AI Elections Tracker\n\nAs dozens of countries head to the polls, we\u2019re monitoring the way AI is being\nused to inform, misinform, and entertain voters.\n\nBy Rest of World Staff\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nWhat Elon Musk doesn\u2019t understand about Brazil\n\nYou can\u2019t fight for free speech in Bras\u00edlia from Texas.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
