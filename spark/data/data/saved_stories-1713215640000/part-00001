I've found it to\nbe the best way to approach interactions in life and online \u2014 you can and\nshould be kind to yourself too.\n\nI struggle with the be kind to yourself bit \u2014 I'm extremely self critical and\nI find it hard to get past that, I always have. I imagine it's a blend of\nimposter syndrome and the lack of confidence that that stems from. It's a nice\ngoal to keep an eye on though and something I try and practice on an ongoing\nbasis.\n\nI always want to be an optimist and my interest in being kind, perhaps, is\nrooted in that. I'm not sure. I know, well, everything makes optimism hard to\nmaintain lately. Perhaps it's being a parent \u2014 modeling kindness is critical\nand having kids demands optimism. I love being a parent and I will always want\nthe best for them. They deserve a world better than we currently have on offer\n\u2014 culturally, technologically and ecologically. Kindness can, would and should\nyield something better than what we have at the moment.\n\nSo, take a beat, take a breath and be kind. You'll be better for it, we'll all\nbe better for it.\n\nDiscuss on Mastodon\n\n## Popular posts\n\n  * You can choose to be kind\n  * Model behavior\n  * A retrospective on a year without streaming music\n  * Go ahead and block AI web crawlers\n  * We've stopped making things anyone wants\n\n## Recent links\n\n  * You\u2019re a Blogger, Not an Essayist\n  * Blockin' bots on Netlify\n  * LLMs Are This Close To Destroying The Internet\n  * Small Web, Indie Web\n  * Big Tech\u2019s corruption was 25 years in the making By Mark Hurst \u2022 April 11, 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
