I mean \u2014 by the end of the year I was but a swollen forearm\nfighting for my life (OK, maybe not quite that bad), but wow ... WOW. 2023:\nEasily the most monumental and generative year of my life. I owe that fullness\nto SPECIAL PROJECTS, my membership program. Now, a somewhat unbelievable five\nyears old.\n\nHere is everything I learned last year.\n\n### Contents\n\n    * Introduction\n    * Impact\n    * Members Only Website\n    * Books in 2023\n    * Tech Stack / Running Costs\n    * Finances\n    * The Next Five Months, the Next Five Years\n\n### #Introduction\n\nThis is my fifth time writing about the program. I\u2019ve covered almost\neverything you can think about covering in the past four years. If you\u2019re\nthinking about embarking on the long, lonely road that is a membership /\nsubscription-driven life, then I highly \u2014 HIGHLY \u2014 recommend reading through\nall of these look-backs chronologically. They\u2019re long: All told, I\u2019ve written\n30,000+ words about running this thing. But reading them will give you a sense\nof the evolution of SPECIAL PROJECTS \u2014 from naive and extremely humble(d) Year\nOne, to the utterly bonkers impact and career jumps of Year Five.\n\n  * 2019 \u2014 Launch Essay: The Explorers Club Membership ^1\n  * 2020 \u2014 Part 1: Running a Paid Membership Program\n  * 2021 \u2014 Part 2: Running a Successful Membership Program\n  * 2022 \u2014 Part 3: Memberships Work\n  * 2023 \u2014 Part 4: Running a Membership Program: Four Years In\n  * 2024 \u2014 Part 5: This essay\n\nWith two \u201csupplementary\u201d essays:\n\n  * 2020 \u2014 Membership Programs, Year Two\n  * 2022 \u2014 Oh, no, Memberships\n\nOtherwise, if you just want to see what I\u2019ve been up to the past year, and how\nSPECIAL PROJECTS has played a major part in enabling this life and work of\nmine, then by all means, here we go \u2014 a look back at 2023.\n\nMe appearing in an interview article about Morioka, where I somehow managed to\ntime travel from 1958 as a computer science lecturer.\n\n### #Impact\n\nBy far and away the biggest \u201cimpact\u201d the program had (not just in last year,\nbut of all the years) was in getting the mid-sized northern-Japanese city of\nMorioka listed at #2 in the New York Times \u201c52 Places to Visit in 2023\u201d list.\nThat listing, combined with the media savvy of one Mr. Baba \u2014 proprietor of\nAzumaya Soba \u2014 rocketed Japan\u2019s collective national attention onto the\nsparkling sweetness that is Morioka in Iwate Prefecture.\n\nMeasuring the precise impact my \u201carticle\u201d (just the shortest, barest of\nthings, hardly 200 words) had in economic terms is difficult, but it\u2019s\nprobably safe to say some additional $100M USD+ found its way into Morioka.^2\nFor Tohoku (the northern area of Japan), having this kind of attention (and\nspillover from the attention), and the economic benefits of such, is a\nsweeping thing. Especially considering fewer than 1.5% of all inbound tourists\never even find their way into Tohoku overall.\n\nNow, you might rightly question how we can draw a line between this membership\nprogram and $100M USD flowing north \u2014 but I think we can. I \u201cfound\u201d Morioka\nthanks to an SP project I ran in 2021 \u2014 Tiny Barber, Post Office. A \u201cwalk\u201d\nthrough Japan where I:\n\n  1. Wrote an extensive pop-up newsletter each and every day (archived for members on the SPECIAL PROJECTS Member Site), and\n  2. visited ten mid-sized cities, spending three nights and four days in each, walking and talking and observing them as closely and rigorously as possible.\n\nThat pop-up was directly funded and catalyzed by SPECIAL PROJECTS (as all my\npop-ups are). No magazine would have paid for me to go on such a tour. No\nnewspaper would have green lit that jaunt. But, with the open permissiveness\nof a membership program \u2014 especially one where you\u2019ve cultivated the prime\n\u201cdeliverable\u201d of Being Interesting \u2014 well, if you want to run off to ten\ncities a bunch of folks have never heard of? Go right ahead.\n\nThat was a profound tour for me. Not only because it expanded and strengthened\nmy relationship to Japan (my home of some twenty-four years), but because it\nestablished archetypes of good living: The scale of the mid-sized cities felt\nfar more \u201chuman sized\u201d than, say, Tokyo, and they abounded with\nentrepreneurial opportunities, fullness, life, kindness, generosity.\n\nWhen the Morioka news hit in January 2023, I was in the middle of one of my\nTOKIO T\u014cKY\u014c TOKYO walks. (Part 2! Also: Archived for members.) I took\nnewspaper interviews in random parks around the city. Television crews crammed\ninto my hotel room. I accepted every interview request that came in and ran\nwith it. I felt I had to. I felt responsibility for \u201cunleashing\u201d this fire\nhose of attention on Morioka, and I wanted them to believe in their value \u2014 as\nastonishing as it may seem \u2014 at being placed at #2 (after London) of places to\nvisit in 2023.\n\nI had never \u201cdone media\u201d before. Certainly never in Japan, never in Japanese.\nNot to this extent, anyway. But by the end of 2023 I had done some 40+\nJapanese interviews across every type of media \u2014 TV, newspaper, magazine, web\njournal, radio \u2014 and had gone from shaking with fear and nervousness, to being\nfairly at ease with it all. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, doing anything media\nrelated is exhausting (for this introvert, anyway), but the gauntlet of 2023\nwas valuable in demystifying the experience. And thereby normalizing it. And\nthereby allowing for more interesting conversations to happen by the end than\nwere happening at the start.\n\nThis is maybe what I\u2019m most proud of: Subtly shifting the conversation from\n\u201cWhy Morioka?\u201d to \u201cWhat qualities of cities like Morioka in Japan enable\npeople to live meaningful lives?\u201d (For those keeping score: Healthcare,\nreasonable costs of living, walkability, reliable and vast infrastructure,\nhistory and craft, youthful entrepreneurship, easy access to nature, and\nmore.) Highlighting what might be so obvious as to be invisible to the average\nJapanese person, but which can feel miraculous to certain folks from certain\nother counties. And thereby a set of qualities worth protecting and nurturing.\n\nNone of this would have happened without SPECIAL PROJECTS. I wouldn\u2019t have\nfelt the permission to do that 10 city tour. To look closely and intimately.\nTo write extensively about those experiences. So that when \u2014 a year later \u2014 my\neditor at the New York Times came knocking, asking for recommendations, I was\nable to say without hesitation: Morioka! Catalyzing the whole fabulous cascade\nof 2023. (With a follow-up in February 2023.)\n\nThis is what I mean when I say it\u2019s sometimes impossible to know where a\nmembership program will take you. And why it can be difficult to \u201cplan\u201d out\nyour years. 2023 was maximally aberrational, but thanks to SPECIAL PROJECTS\n(and the implicit looseness the program enables), I was able to lean into, and\nboth extract and deliver from that aberration (the interviews, the media, the\nreturning to Morioka) tremendous value.\n\nBut, it came at a price. As I began writing in the Year Two review \u2014 the core\npurpose of this program (and all the work I do \u2014 the pop-ups, the videos,\neverything) is to produce books. It turns out, gauntlets of media interviews\nsuck from the same energy source as writing / editing / drafting books.\n\nSo going into Year Six, I\u2019m now fully aware of these trade-offs, and already I\nam protecting my time in a way I don\u2019t think I would have known how to, had\n2023 not happened. As it turns out, the new 52 City list came out, and my pick\nwas placed at #3: Yamaguchi City. I spent January dodging incoming media\nrequests, and will be batching them together at the end of March. Wish me\nluck.\n\nMembers illustration by longtime collaborator and bud Luis Mendo\n\n### #Members Only Website\n\nStarting this year, I\u2019ve finally launched a \u201ctrue\u201d members-only site:\nmembers.specialprojects.jp.\n\nI never intended to make much \u201cmembers only\u201d stuff when I launched SPECIAL\nPROJECTS. In fact, it launched without anything you could call a \u201cperk.\u201d The\nframing was like that of NPR: become a member and \u201cunlock the commons\u201d of my\nfree-for-all work. Over time, however, some members-only stuff percolated up\nthrough the grist of life and work. This was not deliberate, but more a\nbyproduct of wanting to share / educate but keep the scope of that sharing\nsomewhat \u201ccontrolled.\u201d When live-streaming to 10,000 people, I feel far less\nable to be vulnerable or explicitly honest vs live-streaming to several\nhundred people. So it was that during the early days of the pandemic, March\n2020, I began to live stream my work sessions \u2014 laying out books in InDesign,\ndesigning websites like the Ise-ji mini-site, thinking about designing Kissa\nby Kissa and more \u2014 to members.\n\nFinally; it only took five years to make a proper members-only site\n\nOver time, I began to run \u201cboard meetings\u201d \u2014 initially quarterly but now twice\na year. (Quarterly was just too much; twice a year is the perfect balance of\npain and value.) I\u2019ve done other members-only Q&As related to books and\nprojects and walks. We\u2019ve done members-only launch events. All of that adds up\nover time, and the /videos page of the members\u2019 website now contains some 69\nvideos totaling 112 hours. This was utterly unintentional and goes to show the\npower of how doing something consistently (if somewhat irregularly) results in\nan impressive corpus of work.\n\nWhat else lives on that members-only website? Well, we have some sweet\nwallpapers for your smartphone (finally updated after five years). You get\naccess to the members-only podcast (Office Hours) which I updated zero times\nlast year, but does have a few episodes.\n\nThe biggest perk (to the point where all other perks could be removed and the\nprogram would still be valuable) is the discounts on books and photographic\nprints. I wrote about this extensively in the 2020 look back:\n\n> The biggest shock-delight of 2020 was the success of my book Kissa by Kissa.\n> We sold 1,000 copies in the first three days and almost 2,000 copies in\n> three months. It\u2019s a $95USD retail book. That\u2019s bonkers. Thank you thank you\n> thank you to everyone who bought the book and to everyone who has written in\n> with kind words.\n>\n> ... The stroke of unintended \u201cbusiness\u201d genius of the launch was tying\n> Yearly Memberships to a big discount on the book. Existing Yearly members\n> got a $50 discount off that first edition. But I also offered a bundle for\n> non-members wherein you could get a Yearly membership and the book all at\n> once, discount inclusive.\n\nThe conversion rate of non-members converting to members and buying the book\nis still extremely high. As we say in startup land: This here\u2019s a fine\n\u201cproduct-market fit.\u201d\n\nThe other value-rich perk (at least in my mind, and in terms of raw words) is\naccess to the full archives of my pop-up newsletters from the last five years.\nHere is what is available as of February 2024:\n\n  * Nightingalingale \u2014 (ongoing) diary of writing and producing Things Become Other Things (210+ issues)\n  * TOKIO T\u014cKY\u014c TOKYO3 \u2014 a week of walking Tokyo (7 issues)\n  * TOKIO T\u014cKY\u014c TOKYO2 \u2014 a week of walking Tokyo (7 issues)\n  * TOKIO T\u014cKY\u014c TOKYO \u2014 a week of walking Tokyo (7 issues)\n  * BASIE!BOP!JAMAICA! \u2014 16 days touring jazz kissa of northern Japan (16 issues)\n  * Kiiiiiiiiiiiiii \u2014 14 days of research on the Kii Peninsula (14 issues)\n  * M,IBAW \u2014 A month-long photo journal of heading back into the world post-Covid (30 issues and I, of course, got Covid immediately)\n  * Tiny Barber, Post Office \u2014 walking 350 kilometers of mid-sized Japanese cities (30 issues)\n  * Where are all the Nightingales? \u2014 550-kilometer walk through Kii (30 issues)\n  * Pachinko Road \u2014 670-kilometer walk along the T\u014dkaid\u014d (30 issues)\n  * SMS Project \u2014 700-kilometer walk along the Nakasend\u014d, my first \u201cpop-up\u201d newsletter / walk document (30+ issues)\n\nA considerable amount of \u201ccontent!\u201d (In total, some 200,000+ words of\nnewsletters.) Why don\u2019t I make these public? Because they\u2019re all rough drafts,\nwritten in the moment. For most newsletter issues, I\u2019ve spent some 6-8 hours\nwalking and documenting before sitting down in the evening to write and edit\nand publish. This kind of work has become a sort of \u201cascetic practice\u201d (to put\nan insufferable spin on it). But I make these archives available for members\nbecause the membership is what enabled these walks, funded these walks \u2014 both\nfinancially and spiritually. That\u2019s the most potent thing I derive from\nSPECIAL PROJECTS:^3 Permission to go, explore, unshackled from, say, pitching\nto a media incumbent. So offering an archive feels both like a thank you, and\nin the spirit of \u201ceducation.\u201d\n\n### #Books in 2023\n\nThe biggest piece of tangible output in 2023 was the Fine Art Edition of my\nlatest book, Things Become Other Things (\u201cTBOT\u201d).\n\nI had been working on this book since 2021 \u2014 kicked off by my Where Are All\nthe Nightingales? pop-up walk that May. From there, I started a \u201c21-Day Diary\u201d\ncalled Nightingalingale, which was to chronicle the writing of what would\nbecome TBOT. Hilariously, I thought I would be done in 21 days. I just sent\nout the 210th issue in February 2024.\n\nHere are what some readers have written in to say about TBOT:\n\n> I just finished reading TBOT. It is a tremendous piece of work. I was a\n> blubbering mess when I finished it, always a good sign.\n\n> I finished Things Become Other Things yesterday. Thank you, Craig. Beautiful\n> (in form and word), honest, funny, and true ... I don\u2019t think there\u2019s\n> another book in my house that I feel like handling with such care AND\n> carrying with me everywhere.\n\n> My goodness, man, what a beautiful book ... Weeping softly through the final\n> pages I wanted nothing more than to begin again, paging through your\n> magnificent words and images, feeling as though, somehow, I am on this\n> journey with you ... Thank you for this look into your life, spread across\n> kilometers and pages, filled with pain and anger, sure, but so much more joy\n> and kindness.\n\n> I finished reading your book. Incredible. I really loved Kissa by Kissa, but\n> this books intimacy really pulls you in. The last string of photographs was\n> perfect. The book was really quite affecting. I don\u2019t normally email authors\n> like a maniac.\n\n> The cover, paper, pictures are all very nice and wow, but... for a category\n> of people, including me, the words manage to tackle a feeling that just\n> doesn\u2019t show up elsewhere except within. You wouldn\u2019t mistake me for an\n> editor/critic but I adored the writing form-rhythm-choice of words. Though I\n> like what you write anyways the book is on its separate shelf when it comes\n> to quality to the point that I stopped to admire it occasionally, thinking\n> \u2019nicely done Craig!!\u2019 and \u2018Mr McPhee would approve\u2019.\n\n> I just read it, and wow! The way you weave the story of your walks and the\n> passage rural Japan has been passing through and the story of your early\n> life and its transformation and the story of Bryan is truly remarkable on\n> both an intellectual and emotional level.\n\n> This book will stay with me.\n\nAnd many more. (Nice notes like these go into my special hey, you're not a\npiece of shit.md file. Everyone should keep a you're not a piece of shit.md.)\n\nUnexpectedly, over the summer, I sold the rights to the trade hardcover and\npaperback edition of the book to Random House. The Random House edition is\nslated to come out in Spring 2025. In that deal, I maintained fine art edition\nrights (which is how I was able to publish my own photo-illustrated edition\nlast November). I wrote about it all over in Roden: \u201cThe Random House Book\nDeal.\u201d\n\nIf that all sounds a bit complicated, it\u2019s because it is (a bit). This kind of\ndeal is novel. (Though not, you know, a novel.)\n\nI am above and beyond proud of TBOT and grateful for all the people who helped\nmake this possible, and I\u2019m presently hard at work on the Random House\nedition, which will be its own unique creature.\n\nThere are a lot of references \u2014 insider jibber-jabber \u2014 up there: A\nconstellation of language \u2014 a kind of SP vernacular \u2014 from pop-up walks and\nnewsletters has grown around the membership program. A series of proper nouns\nonly members understand: Tiny Barbers and Pachinko Roads and Nightingales (and\nNightingalingales) and talking about a Slow Boat to Jamaica! will make sense\nto some of those members. TBOT is an acronym I deploy frequently. And close\nreaders will know what an \u201cippon-ura\u201d is even if I don\u2019t explain it (though I\ndo explain it, and many other things, in TBOT).\n\nThis \u201csecret language\u201d to SPECIAL PROJECTS is perhaps the biggest indicator of\nthe program\u2019s success, for it marks a great number of accomplishments and\nadventures. Adventures that would have never happened without SP.\n\n### #Tech Stack / Running Costs\n\nMy tech stack has largely remained unchanged over the years: Memberful for\nhandling subscriptions and billing (via Stripe), Shopify for my book and print\nsales, Campaign Monitor for sending newsletters, and Hugo for generating the\nstatic files that comprise craigmod.com.^4\n\nThe biggest change this year is that I made a \u201cproper\u201d members-only website \u2014\nfinally. Up until now, I had been using a .htpasswd file with a shared\nusername and password. I used that system for over four years.^5 But it\nworked! It worked just fine! But it did feel like \u2014 with five years under our\nbelt, and as many members as we have \u2014 investing in a more robust solution\nmade sense. Especially one that would be a) fun to build, b) allow me to learn\nsome new web technologies, and c) give me even more flexibility.\n\nSo I surveyed the landscape, and because I was already comfortable writing\nPython, I landed on Flask for the app framework. It\u2019s a simple thing, my\nmembership app (just a single Python file) \u2014 the most complicated bit is the\nOAuth routines to allow logins through Memberful. But those I just nabbed from\nthe ether. Any dead ends I encountered, I leaned on GitHub\u2019s Copilot AI helper\nand usually got the right answer immediately. Programming with Copilot has\nbeen an astounding experience. Truly a force-multiplier. It\u2019s made me more\nwilling to dig into this kind of work knowing the more gnarly arcana of syntax\nis crackable with just a few keystrokes.\n\nOne big benefit of this kind of properly-authenticated member site is I can\nsplit rewards between Monthly and Yearly SPECIAL PROJECTS members more easily.\nI can also send everyone to the same URL in the welcome email. Logic driven by\ntheir subscription plan will change what they see.\n\nFor those technically curious: The Flask app is deployed on my dinky Digital\nOcean droplet (server) (that runs all my websites for about $30/month), has no\ndatabase (logins are stored as local sessions), uses supervisor to monitor if\nthe app is running, and gunicorn as the WSGI, proxied by Apache (not even\nnginx!). Everything is synced / version controlled / backed up through GitHub.\n\nAs for hosting video, YouTube is still the only cost-effective option (I mean,\nit\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d). But it also has the best streaming compression algorithms,\nsmoothest 4K/8K capabilities, and is quite flexible for livestreaming / chats\n/ playbacks. It\u2019s one of the best pieces of software Google makes. It\nintegrates seamlessly with Ecamm Live. Anytime someone links to a self-hosted\nvideo or Vimeo video, I cringe hitting play \u2014 as the streaming quality /\nbuffering is often painful and clunky.\n\nYouTube also has a serviceable API (that\u2019s less opaque thanks to GitHub\nCopilot). I built a little system to collate all 112 hours, and 69 unlisted\nSPECIAL PROJECTS members-only videos (as of Feb 2024) into a JSON file, and\nthen use that file to build the video section of my members-only site. I use\nYouTube Lite to show all the video previews on a single page without it\nfeeling slow / heavy. I\u2019ve also tagged / indexed all the video by category.\nWhen you log in, the video page looks something like this:\n\nI\u2019m still using a \u201cprivate\u201d^6 members-only Instagram account to do \u201cbehind the\nscenes\u201d commentary. I then aggregate those behind-the-scenes videos into an\nunlisted YouTube video. Instagram isn\u2019t ideal, but it is \u2014 as far as I can\ntell \u2014 the easiest way to broadcast \u201csemi-live\u201d video updates to a private\nsubset of viewers. Most people have accounts, those who don\u2019t can watch the\nYouTube video posted soon afterwards.\n\nAs of February 2024, here are my membership-related software costs (in\ndescending order):\n\nService| Cost/mo| Notes  \n---|---|---  \nCampaign Monitor| $300.00| Running Ridgeline / Roden / SPECIAL PROJECTS\nnewsletters, as well as all pop-up newsletters  \nAdobe Create Cloud| $53.16| Ransomware  \nDigital Ocean Server| $40.00| Hosting for craigmod.com, specialprojects.jp,\nwalkkumano.com, etcetera  \nCloudflare| $32.00| Domain caching, protection, CDN  \nDropbox| $30.00| Backup / offline storage / file sharing  \nShopify| $30.00| Selling books / digital goods / hosting membership perks  \nBackblaze backup + B2 storage| $30.00| Backup for computer / video files  \nEcamm Live| $30.00| Livestream software  \nGoogle Apps| $25.00| craigmod.com, specialprojects.jp email  \nMemberful| $25.00| Managing memberships themselves (tiers, signups, billing,\nrefunds, et cetera)  \nExperian| $19.00| American credit extortionist racket payments  \nFigma| $16.50| Design / collaboration software  \nDescript| $12.00| Podcast editing  \nGoogle Storage| $10.00| Moar backups  \nname.com| $10.00| Domain registrations / renewals \u2014 craigmod.com,\nspecialprojects,jp, etcetera  \nPlausible| $8.00| Privacy friendly web stats  \nLibsyn| $9.00| On Margins SW945, SP Members-only Podcast hosting  \nQuicken| $5.00| Boring but surprisingly good (!!) accounting software;\nexcellent for generating expense / income reports  \nMoneytree| $4.00| Japan accounting software  \nTOTAL| ~$660| monthly running costs  \n  \nOr about $7,920 / year in recurring software costs.^7\n\nWhich is ... a lot? Not a lot? Campaign Monitor and Adobe make up nearly 50%\nof all my costs. Shopify and Digital Ocean are also a bit expensive, but are\nfundamental. All in all, to be able to run a membership program and small\nbusiness (which is what the books sales have turned into \u2014 a small business)\nall in for this price, feels reasonable.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written in previous years: I could trim a few bits^8 but I maintain a\nlot of flexibility / independence in this setup. The independence factor is\ncritical. If I was running \u201cjust a Substack\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have nearly the\nlatitude to experiment, or build archives like I\u2019m building. I appreciate the\nflexibility of my system with each passing year. I am also healed by\ntinkering.\n\nOther miscellany: Memberful charges 4.9% per transaction. Stripe charges an\nadditional 2.9% (+$0.30) credit card processing fee. Together, this represents\nan additional running cost of 7.8% on all membership fees.\n\nShopify charges ~2.8% for credit card processing on top of their $30/mo fee. I\nfind this totally acceptable. Shopify is a spectacular product. I don\u2019t use\nany paid Shopify plugins.\n\n### #Finances\n\nAs for the finance side of things, 2023 was a very good year. Memberships have\nnever been higher. As I\u2019ve stated in the past, I truly never look at the\nnumbers.^9 Memberships crossed a \u201csustainable\u201d threshold a few years ago. I\ndo, however, have to look at the numbers when I prepare taxes, and so I have\npeeked, and they are fine indeed.\n\nBut it\u2019s the book sales that really bulked \u201cthe business.\u201d Book revenue was\nroughly 2x membership revenue in 2023. TBOT sold like hotcakes out the gate.\nThe most books I\u2019ve ever sold that quickly, in twenty years of making books.\nOur sales platform (Shopify) and warehouse / distributor in Osaka did great.\nWe shipped over 2,000 books in the span of about 10 days with very few issues.\nMiraculous, if I may use the word. Kissa by Kissa continues to sell as well. I\nhad one bookshop in New York order 25 copies, sell out instantly, and order\nanother 25. Sell out again. And order 50 more. (I happily give discounts to\nindie bookstores, just email me (craig@specialprojects.jp) and ask.)\n\nBlackbird Spyplane picked Kissa and TBOT as their books of the year for 2023,\nwhich was a delightful little jawnsy Christmas present:\n\nMainly, TBOT proved my hypothesis that new books help sell old books. This is\ngood to see play out in practice! I love the current form of Kissa by Kissa \u2014\nthis fifth edition is perhaps the absolute perfect instantiation of what I had\nintended to produce from the beginning. And TBOT\u2019s cover and materials (and\ntext!) turned out, I think, superbly (after many painful, last minute\niterations.) They\u2019re both books I am enormously proud of. I\u2019m grateful for the\nopportunity to ship them around the world and into the hands of readers.\n\n### #The Next Five Months, the Next Five Years\n\nAs of mid-February 2024 here\u2019s what I\u2019m up to: Working hard on the Random\nHouse edit of Things Become Other Things!^10 While pub-date is still over a\nyear out, we need to lock the manuscript by about April, which is closing in\nfast.\n\nIn March, I\u2019m doing a small Ise-ji walk at the start of the month, and then\nheading to Yamaguchi at the end of the month to meet with the mayor and\ngovernor. Having learned my lesson with Morioka, media interviews and shoots\nwill suck all of your energy and then some. I\u2019m trying to get better at\nbatching.\n\nApril is slated for two weeks of exploratory walks in Shikoku. (Not related to\nthe 88-temples.)\n\nIn May, I\u2019m hoping to pull off a huge 3-4 week mega-walk with an eye towards\nturning it into a book.\n\nFor June: Another \u201cWalk-n-Talk\u201d with Kevin Kelly and co.\n\nJuly: Prepping for Kissa by Kissa Japanese Edition publication. (More\ninformation on that forthcoming!)\n\nIn August, I hope to take a break, do a bit of Japanese Kissa prep, and maybe\nstart on Random House marketing prep.\n\nSeptember: Japanese Kissa publication? and indie bookshop tour? (a tour I want\nto turn into a mega pop-up newsletter / book).\n\nAnd on and on ... there\u2019s a lot on the docket, a lot I want to see, research,\nand transmute into essays, newsletters, and books. As I\u2019ve said over and over\nagain, the point of all of this is the books. I already know / have begun work\non SP 3, SP 4, SP 5, SP 6, and SP 7 \u2014 i.e, the next five books I want to\npublish. That\u2019s like ten years of work!\n\nAs I say on my SPECIAL PROJECTS board meetings, the biggest hindrances to\nthese publishing goals are:\n\n  * Health\n  * Scarcity Mindset\n  * Time management / being consumed by media requests\n\nHealth: Always the top priority. Without this nothing else is possible.\nImportant to remember that. I had some health annoyances last year and keep\nthis at the forefront of my mind. It\u2019s why I basically don\u2019t drink (at most a\nfew glasses a year; have been doing this for about twelve years), regularly\nexercise, have a sort of strict (or at least conscientious one) diet (no beef\nor pork for last fourteen years; lots of cooking at home; high-quality\ningredients), lean into regular health checks, and am fanatical about sleep.\nIt\u2019s all in service to a) being the best version of myself for friends and\nfamily, and b) being able to fully show up for the work, the walks, the\nwriting, the photographing, the engaging with folks along the road. Whatever\njoy may lurk in getting drunk (and I have enough experience to know there\nisn\u2019t much joy there) is eclipsed a billion times over by a good walk, a great\nday of writing. When you feel this and believe this, abstaining from something\nlike alcohol is pretty effortless. As a plus: Attending to physical health\nalso attends to mental health. My predilection towards conditions like\naloneness will always lurk, ready to zap me of creative energy and will. So a\nstrong body establishes a rampart against frustrating mental stuff sabotaging\nthe system.\n\nScarcity mindset: This is just to note how I\u2019ve historically operated from a\nplace of great scarcity. That is, underestimating my own resources /\ncapabilities. Sometimes we choose a gear when we are eight, or twelve, or\nfifteen, or twenty-five \u2014 based on our resources and situation at that time \u2014\nand then stay in that gear indefinitely. Time passes and the ground truth no\nlonger aligns with that past choice. Meaning: It\u2019s good to revisit and\nrecalibrate your own self-imposed limitations every now and then.\n\nTime management / media requests: As SPECIAL PROJECTS has grown, and our\nimpact has expanded, the amount of time I spend doing media-related work has\nincreased. As I explain up above in the impact section, this kind of work can\nbe exhausting. So I\u2019ve hired two assistants in the last year whose job is\nspecifically Media Mitigation. Any time a request comes in, it gets filtered\nthrough them, and any back and forth coordination happens between them as\nwell. This has removed about 70% of the stress around media from my end. I can\nprobably get even smarter about this, and probably need to going forward.\n\nDoing good work is very easy. You just need the time and space to do it. And\nthen sit down and do it.\n\nSPECIAL PROJECTS gives me time, permission, and motivation.^11 Time in that I\ndon\u2019t have to take on non-relevant jobs to make ends meet. Permission in that\nthe crew of supportive folks cheering from the members-seating is delighted\nand excited (I think?) to see me go in any weird direction I can think of. And\nmotivation in that I want to produce and document the process for members, not\nbecause I feel the \u201cneed\u201d as a membership \u201cduty,\u201d but because in doing so I\nknow (I have five years of empirical data!!) good work emerges. And committing\nto that work makes me a better person (as goofy as that may sound). Compared\nto when I started this program in 2019, I am absolutely more patient, more\nrigorous, kinder, and healthier. I am who I wished I could have been when I\nwas in my 20s and floundering.\n\nI\u2019ve written and published hundreds-of-thousands of words under the auspices\nof SPECIAL PROJECTS, have gone on great adventures all over Japan and the\nworld, have had a profound impact on at least one medium-sized rural city, and\nhave produced two gorgeous books. None of this would have been possible\nwithout the membership program.\n\nSo, thank you members. Here\u2019s to another five incredible years.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of starting a membership program, don\u2019t. It\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s\nso much work. It\u2019s so difficult. It\u2019s the most work I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\nBut it\u2019s also been the best five years of my life many times over. So if\nyou\u2019re willing to do the work, to moil, and you can\u2019t be talked out of it ...\nwell, then go for it. Good luck. And if you have any questions, email me:\ncraig@specialprojects.jp.\n\nOh, and, you know, if you\u2019re not already a member, please consider joining\nSPECIAL PROJECTS.\n\n\u2014 Craig\n\n### #Noted\n\n  1. SPECIAL PROJECTS was \u201cExplorers Club\u201d for the first 18 months \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. And that\u2019s likely an underestimate. I find it unlikely we\u2019ll ever have another word:USD impact ratio going forward. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. ... and I keep saying this over and over again, year after year, but it\u2019s so important it demands repeating, ad nauseam, to make sure the point is not lost! \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. This is not a stack I\u2019d recommend to most average humans; if you\u2019re non-technical, I\u2019d urge you to look at Ghost as a potential membership / newsletter / publishing platform all rolled into one. I, however, am a giant dork, and value the weird flexibility (and creativity unlocked therein) that comes with handling the nitty-gritty of this system. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  5. Always always always use the simplest possible solution at hand to understand the parameters of the problem-space. I am so glad I launched the members-only section as a shared password section and a single HTML file because it a) demystified if I had anything to put in there, and b) kept it so simple as to not impede my putting things in there. Also, if you\u2019re worried about members \u201cstealing\u201d stuff, well, I\u2019d say you\u2019re probably better off assuming general goodness of folks, and letting the few people who will abuse a system do their thing. (Rather than spending time / energy / mental health shoring up defenses.) \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  6. I just tell members the private account name and accept any friend requests that come in. Can this be abused? Of course. Do I care? Not really. See above footnote for assuming the best and not overly preparing for worst when it comes to members-only stuff. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  7. Of course, there\u2019s also rent for my studio, assistants, and productions costs for books and prints, all of which vary depending on the week / month / year. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  8. Campaign Monitor (newsletter software) comprises roughly 40% of all costs ($300/mo!!), but it is also the biggest driver of sales / distribution. I\u2019ve started to look into switching to something like Listmonk \u2014 an open source option that runs off Amazon SES and would cost, roughly, 1/10 or less of Campaign Monitor. But moving all my newsletters to a new platform is a serious undertaking, and because they are so core to what I do, it\u2019s a Maybe Next Year kinda thing. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  9. And I recommend you to do the same if you\u2019re running a membership program or paid newsletter; certainly NEVER be notified of people unsubscribing or canceling things. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  10. The core of TBOT will be the same (same story) but as I wrote in the above footnote, the form will be quite different. My fine art edition is photographically illustrated, printed on the highest-quality papers, and hand bound with a cloth cover and complicated foil and embossing work. The Random House edition will be a standard trade hardcover. The photos will be black and white and more \u201cillustrative\u201d than fine art \u2014 think Rings of Saturn \u2014 and lean into the aesthetic of low-quality B&W printing, which I think should be fun. The audiences are also quite different. The Fine Art Edition was written and designed with my members in mind. They know a lot about me. The Random House edition is being edited with a blank-slate audience in mind. They need more information. It will likely be 30-60% longer than the fine art edition in terms of word count. So it\u2019s a huge project, this reworking of TBOT for Random House, but one I\u2019m grateful to be able to do and excited to get out into the world. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  11.
