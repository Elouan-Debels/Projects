The biggest challenge of the\nenergy transition so far has been the inability to store these intermittent\nforms of energy for later use. \"Unfortunately, small-scale storage solutions,\nsuch as batteries or accumulators, are not sufficient; large, industrial-scale\nstorage solutions are needed.\"\n\nThe company's solution for the city of Vantaa in the south of Finland is to\nconstruct huge underground caverns to store thermal energy, which can then be\npumped to homes and business via an existing district heating network when\nneeded.\n\nThe seasonal heat storage - Vantaa Energy\n\nThe project has a total volume of 1.1 million cubic meters (38.85 million\ncubic feet), including processing facilities, and will be built into the\ncity's bedrock at around 100 m (330 ft) below ground \u2013 though the deepest\nparts of the setup could go down as far as 140 m. Three caverns will be\ncreated, each measuring 300 m (984.25 ft) in length, 40 m (131.2 ft) in height\nand 20 m (65.6 ft) in width.\n\nThese will be filled with hot water by a pair of 60-MW electric boilers,\npowered by renewables when it's cheap to do so. Pressure within the space\nallows for temperatures to get as high as 140 \u00b0C (284 \u00b0F) without the water\nboiling over or steaming away. Waste heat from industry will also feed the\nsetup, with a smart control system balancing energy sources.\n\nThe Varanto facility is reported to have a total thermal capacity of 90 GWh\nwhen \"fully charged\" \u2013 enough to meet the year-round domestic heating needs of\na \"medium-sized Finnish city.\"\n\nThe seasonal thermal energy storage facility underneath Vantaa in southern\nFinland is reported to have the equivalent energy capacity of 1.3 million\nelectric car batteries\n\nVantaan Energia\n\nThe majority of the homes in Finland's fourth most populated municipality are\nhooked up to the city's 600-km-plus (373-mile) underground district heating\nnetwork, where hot water is pumped through a closed two-pipe system and into\nheat exchangers at each building. Once the heat transfer has taken place, the\ncooled water is then piped back to the production plant and reheated so the\ncycle can begin again.\n\nThe Nordic country is reported to be the largest producer of district heating\nin the region \u2013 in relation to population \u2013 and generated some 37.3 terawatt-\nhours in 2023, with more than half sourced from renewables and 14% coming from\nwaste heat.\n\nIn Vantaa, a waste-to-energy plant that burns a mix of non-recyclable domestic\nand commercial/industrial waste, plus the wood-fueled Martinlaasko Power\nPlant, are responsible for providing the heat for the local network at the\nmoment. A high-temperature incineration plant that can take in hazardous waste\nwill come online next year.\n\nThe Varanto seasonal thermal energy storage facility is expected to enter the\nmix from 2028, with construction of the entrance due to start in a few months\nfrom now. Though reported to enable \"cost-effective storage of renewable\nenergy and waste heat on an industrial scale,\" actual figures or estimates are\nyet to be revealed.\n\nVantaan Energia estimates the build cost to come in at 200 million euros, with\nthe Finnish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment already topping up the\nproject pot with a grant of \u20ac19 million.
