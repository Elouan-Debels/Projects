They recently unveiled their latest and\ngreatest model, the Mixtral 8x22b, in true badass fashion - by simply dropping\na torrent link on X.\n\nWhat is the Mixtral 8x22b?\n\nThe Mixtral 8x22b is a state-of-the-art language model that leverages a\ncutting-edge architecture called Mixture of Experts (MoE). In this setup, the\nmodel comprises eight individual \"expert\" models, each with 7 billion\nparameters. During inference, the model selects and utilizes two of these\nexperts at a time to generate text, resulting in impressive performance while\nkeeping the computational requirements manageable.\n\nKey Features:\n\n  * 8 expert models, each with 7 billion parameters (totaling 56 billion parameters)\n  * 2 experts used simultaneously during inference\n  * Cutting-edge MoE architecture for improved performance and efficiency\n  * 32,000 token context window (exceptional for open-source models)\n\nInitial Benchmark\n\nWhile comprehensive benchmarks are still underway, early results indicate that\nthe Mixtral 8x22b outperforms many larger models, including some proprietary\nofferings from tech giants. For instance, on the challenging ARC reasoning\ntask, the Mixtral 8x22b achieved an impressive score of 70.5, surpassing even\nGPT-4's reported score of 68.\n\nHumanEval benchmark results:\n\n*source\n\nGetting Your Hands on the Model\n\nTrue to Mistral's ethos, the Mixtral 8x22b is freely available to the public\nvia a torrent link shared on X. However, it's worth noting that this powerful\nmodel requires substantial computational resources to run effectively. Users\nwith high-end GPUs or access to cloud computing resources will be best\npositioned to take full advantage of the Mixtral 8x22b.\n\nFor those seeking a more accessible option, Mistral's previous models,\nincluding the highly capable 7 billion parameter version, are available on\nplatforms like Poe, allowing broader access and experimentation.\n\nThe Future of Open-Source AI\n\nWith the release of the Mixtral 8x22b, Mistral AI has once again demonstrated\ntheir commitment to pushing the boundaries of open-source AI. As the field\ncontinues to evolve rapidly, it will be exciting to see what other\ngroundbreaking developments emerge from this innovative team and the wider\nopen-source community.\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nFor further actions, you may consider blocking this person and/or reporting\nabuse\n\n## Read next\n\n### Claude 3 Opus is by far the best AI tool for summarization.\n\nDamon Who - Apr 4\n\n### Harnessing the Power of Presets in Fooocus.\n\nwill - Mar 27\n\n### The Imminent Arrival of Stable Diffusion 3: A New Era in AI-Generated\nImagery\n\nJj Chao - Mar 28\n\nPromptzone - Commumity\n\n  * Joined\n\nMar 23, 2024\n\n### More from Promptzone - Commumity\n\nGoogle is officially making Gemini open to the public.\n\n#gemini #ai\n\nKarpathy is Back with llm.c: A Pure C Implementation of GPT-2 in <1000 Lines\n\n#ai #news\n\nMixture-of-Depths (MoD) Boosts Model Speed by 50%\n\n#ai #news\n\nPromptzone \u2014 PromptZone: A vibrant community for creative minds to share,\nexplore, and discuss prompts across various genres and interests.
