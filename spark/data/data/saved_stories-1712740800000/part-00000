After millennia of struggle, a verdict has finally been\nreached in the Battle of the Sexes. Turns out we\u2019re the losers, not least\nbecause \u201cthe sexes\u201d don\u2019t even exist.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. Listen to Owen Jones, Guardian columnist and\nrenowned expert on history\u2019s \u201cright\u201d side. Last week he issued a formal\nannouncement to all those still holding out for a win for Team Vagina (whom he\nrather quaintly calls \u201canti-trans activists\u201d, on the basis that anyone who\nthinks having a vagina matters is \u201canti-trans\u201d):\n\nYou\u2019re going to lose. Comprehensively. You\u2019re going to lose. And actually, a\nlot of your anger and fury and bile is driven by the fact that you know you\u2019re\ngoing to lose.\n\nCrikey. That\u2019s us told.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019ve not had several years\u2019 warning. Indeed,\nI\u2019ve always had a particular fondness for Owen\u2019s 2017 effort: \u201cAnti-trans\nzealots, know this: history will judge you\u201d (it may be just me, but I find it\nimpossible to read \u201cknow this\u201d without imagining a Lloyd Russell-Moylesque\nfinger point). In Owen\u2019s world, feminists \u2014 the old-style version, who do\nterribly out-of-date things such as saying \u201cno\u201d to male people \u2014 have picked\nthe wrong side. Silly us! If we\u2019d heeded his warnings, we\u2019d have thrown our\nlot in with those now \u201cprogressively\u201d threatening to decapitate us.\n\nThat, at least, is how a certain type of man expects us to treat our own\npolitical movement. Not as something that matters because women and girls\nmatter, but as something to be twisted and bent out of shape in order to meet\nthe standards of history\u2019s winners. It doesn\u2019t matter if women themselves are\nleft behind. According to this worldview, winning is synonymous with moral\nsuperiority, therefore the losers deserve to lose. After all, isn\u2019t that how\nevery good story ends?\n\n> Feminists are used to losing. You can\u2019t shame us this way\n\nI have a confession: I, too, used to think this way. I thought I was on the\nright side of history and that my side would \u201cwin\u201d. This is because I was once\nwhat is known as \u201ca child\u201d. Born in 1975, the year in which the Sex\nDiscrimination Act was passed, I was part of a post-Second Wave generation of\nfeminists who were told the future belonged to us. How could it not? It would\nhave been inconceivable to teenaged me that middle-aged me would be living in\na country in which rape was effectively decriminalised, and women were being\ntold they faced a hundred year wait for the end of the gender pay gap. But\nhere we are. I grew up. It seems some people don\u2019t have to.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand the appeal of \u201cright side of history\u201c\nthinking. Clearly there are things people thought in the past that they\u2019d be\nincredibly embarrassed to own up to today. Everyone likes winning, and nobody\nlikes being embarrassed. Even so, I am not sure whether \u201cpeople in the future\nwill hate you for thinking this\u201d is a particularly reliable guide for moral\nconduct.\n\nFor instance, when I see people confidently place their bets on denying there\nare two sexes, I don\u2019t think \u201cgood work! Future people will love you and see\nme as a massive bigot!\u201d I tend to think these are the people most at risk of\ngoing along with the worst, most harmful ideologies \u2014 precisely the kind of\nideologies to which \u201cright side of history\u201d advocates see themselves as immune\n\u2014 due to fear of not conforming. I see people who prioritise being on the\n\u201cwinning\u201c side over engaging with conflicting needs, and that is a dangerous\nthing.\n\nIn 1982\u2019s Women of Ideas, Dale Spender wrote of the foolishness of viewing\nhistory \u201cas a steady march of human progress\u201c:\n\nIt is almost beyond our comprehension to question the notion of progress. The\nabsurdity of this concept is not challenged by the insanity of nuclear\nweapons, the wilful and increasing destruction and pollution of this planet or\nby the grossly inequitable distribution of resources. Society needs the\nconcept of progress to legitimate as the high point of civilisation many of\nits current barbaric practices.\n\nRight now, as women and girls in Afghanistan are losing access to education,\nhealthcare and basic safety, as an estimated 142.6 million female people are\nmissing from the world due to sex selection, femicide and neglect, I wonder at\nthe misrepresentation of sex denialism as \u201cprogress\u201d. Whose interests does it\nserve? If you decide that the most oppressed women are those with penises, it\nbecomes easier to claim we\u2019re seeing the end of gender-based oppression,\ndespite everything that\u2019s happening to the world\u2019s uterus owners. It is\npossible to \u201cwin\u201d by shifting the goalposts. I\u2019d rather be an honest loser,\nthough.\n\nIt is strange that Jones is so convinced that feminists are in a frenzy about\nlosing. We are used to it. You can\u2019t shame us this way. Most domestic abusers\nwill go to the grave still regarded as \u201cgood men\u201d. The same goes for most\nrapists, who will never be charged, let alone convicted of anything. If\nfeminists accepted nothing less than \u201cwinning\u201d, it would drive us insane. I\ndon\u2019t know a single one who deludes herself that one day, those calling her an\nevil terf bigot will suddenly see the error of their ways and feel deep shame.\nIt won\u2019t ever happen.\n\n> Some people can fool themselves into believing what\u2019s convenient\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s what I think will happen with regard to feminism\nand gender identity: sex denialism is not sustainable. There will be a\nbacklash, with conservatives who think people\u2019s personalities must match their\nsexed bodies, pitched against gender identitarians who think people\u2019s sexed\nbodies are defined by their personalities. Both groups will blame feminists,\ndespite our being the only ones who think everyone is fine as they are. The\nright of a male person to claim to be female will be rescinded in some areas \u2014\nsuch as sport, which men care about \u2014 but not others, such as female-only\nrefuges, which men don\u2019t. Generation Alpha kids will start to find the gender\nobsession of straight Zoomers and Millennials naff, but some teenage girls\nwill continue to despise their female bodies and have recourse to binding and\nmastectomies because such things will have been normalised. Politicians and\njournalists who once aligned themselves with the more extreme, violent\nexcesses of trans activism will pretend they were always more moderate. They\nwill blame \u201cterfs\u201d \u2014 women who said what they are now saying, only earlier \u2014\nfor making it impossible to express themselves without sounding \u201chateful\u201d.\n\nEssentially, I think feminists will have some very partial wins, which will be\ncredited to other people, and that they will be blamed for outcomes about\nwhich they have spent years warning others. That\u2019s women\u2019s work for you. I\napologise for the fact that this is less exciting than filming myself leering\n\u201cyou\u2019re gonna lose, suckers!\u201d\n\nSome people can fool themselves into believing what\u2019s convenient. Feminism is\nno place for that. What would be the point? What is the value of a victory\nthat means continuing to bend yourself into pretzels to accommodate male\nperceptions of reality? I came to feminism to escape that, not replicate it.\n\nFeminism isn\u2019t going to \u201cwin\u201d in any absolute sense. What it will do is\ncontinue to show women that they are not mad, that they matter and that female\nrelationships and legacies matter. It will have some major victories \u2014 access\nto public space, control of our own bodies \u2014 which will require constant\nmaintenance. Sometimes these victories will be snatched away.\n\nWhen we get old, we will not be able to believe that we still have to protest\nthis fucking shit. We will do it, though. When we are on our deathbeds, I\ndoubt any of us will be thinking \u201cyeah, but did I own Owen Jones?\u201d Our\npolitical beliefs are not so fragile, our principles not so fickle. Know this,\nanti-feminist zealots: you\u2019re just not that important.\n\nShare\n\n## Enjoying The Critic online?
