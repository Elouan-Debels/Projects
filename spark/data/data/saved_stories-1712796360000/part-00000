[I\u2019ve dealt with imposter\nsyndrome](https://coryd.dev/posts/2023/on-imposter-syndrome/) for my whole\ncareer and still battle with it.

I\u2019ve dealt with imposter syndrome for my whole\ncareer and still battle with it. I\u2019m a self-taught developer and am confident\nthat there\u2019s more I don\u2019t know than I do know.\n\nI\u2019ve been asked when interviewing for a front end ecommerce position how the\nJavascript event loop works \u2014 in detail. I told the interviewer I didn\u2019t know,\nhad never needed to in previous positions but was confident I could figure it\nout. They hired me. I\u2019ve taken a similar tack when discussing other roles with\ninterviewers \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but I like to learn and I\u2019ll figure it out. Don\u2019t\nknow enough React? I\u2019ll learn. Don\u2019t know bespoke framework/internal tool X?\nI\u2019ll learn.\n\nThis has also been something I tell junior developers I\u2019ve mentored and\nsomething I prize when it\u2019s exhibited. Everyone on a team excels at something,\nor many things and there will be overlap, but the gaps are where you can help\nand teach each other. Don\u2019t waste an opportunity to learn and don\u2019t struggle\nwhen you don\u2019t need to.\n\nDon\u2019t fight through a problem. Read the docs and ask questions from there.\nI\u2019ve learned from the open web, from taking apart applications and tools and\nI\u2019ve learned even more from gracious senior developers. Being able to teach\nsomething to someone else is a great way to verify that you truly understand\nsomething.\n\nBe kind, help each other out and everyone gets better together. It\u2019s been a\nfoundational part of all the best teams I\u2019ve been on.\n\n## Popular posts\n\n  * Data collection should always be opt in\n  * A retrospective on a year without streaming music\n  * AI cannot and should not replace search\n  * Go ahead and block AI web crawlers\n  * Don\u2019t be afraid to admit when you don\u2019t know something\n\n## Recent links\n\n  * Microsoft Pitched OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E as Battlefield Tool for U.S. Military\n  * Why I\u2019m Ready to Party Like It\u2019s 1999...Again\n  * The Meat Grinder\n  * Opt-out is always wrong\n  * Again, my position on LLMs is that you absolutely shouldn\u2019t be using them with very, very few exceptions\n\n", "frontpage": true}
