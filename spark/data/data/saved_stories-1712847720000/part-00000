It\u2019s never good news. At a time when the world needs to be reducing\nemissions, the numbers continue to climb. However, while emissions have been\nmoving in the wrong direction, many of the underpinning economic forces that\ndrive them have been going the right way. This could well be the year when\nthese various forces push hard enough to finally tip the balance.\n\nIn 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it expected global energy\nemissions to hit their peak by 2025. This estimate marked a big change from\nthe year before, sparked by accelerated investments in low-carbon technologies\nfollowing the war in Ukraine. Rystad Energy\u2014another research and analysis\ngroup\u2014also expects a peak by 2025. Ember Climate\u2014the leading source on global\nelectricity data\u2014estimates that emissions from global electricity already\npeaked in 2022. Analysts might disagree on the exact date, but it\u2019s clear that\na peak in emissions is now well within our grasp.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThis story is from the WIRED World in 2024, our annual trends briefing.

Solar and wind\nare growing quickly, and in 2024 these two sources of renewable energy could\noutstrip the increase in electricity demand. If this happens, coal- and gas-\nburning will go down, and so will emissions.\n\nUnsurprisingly, when we actually reach peak emissions will depend a lot on the\nworld\u2019s largest emitter, China. In 2023 its emissions were still rising. This\nis partly due to its continued recovery from Covid-19. An ongoing drought also\nmeans its hydropower output has dropped. These factors highlight, again, how\ndifficult these things are to predict: One unexpected event can always flip a\npeak into another record-breaking year.\n\nChina\u2019s peak, however, is going to come soon, because of record-high\ndeployments of solar and wind, and an increase in nuclear power. Soon, the\ncountry will be adding enough sustainable energy to cover its growing\nelectricity demand. China\u2019s solar and wind output is already enough to cover\nthe total electricity use of some of the world\u2019s largest economies like\nCanada, Brazil, Russia, Japan, and even the world\u2019s most populous country,\nIndia. In 2023 alone it could add enough to cover the UK\u2019s entire electricity\nuse.\n\nAnother reason why the peak in global emissions might arrive in 2024 is the\nelectric car revolution. Global sales of petrol and diesel cars peaked half a\ndecade ago, and the IEA estimated that almost one in five cars sold globally\nin 2023 were electric. Previously, the agency hadn\u2019t expected this milestone\nto be reached until 2030. (In 2020, this figure was just 4 percent.) This move\nto EVs will start to eat into global oil demand, until its peak arrives too.\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, this could be as early\nas 2027.\n\nOf course, peaking emissions is just the start. The world needs to then reduce\nemissions, and quickly. But the downslope will be easier than the turning\npoint, as the energy transition will no longer be in its infancy. 2024 will\nhopefully mark the beginning of a mature low-carbon global economy.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.
