Helm\n  * April 9, 2024\n\n  * Add a comment\n  * Share\n\nFacebook Twitter Pocket Reddit Email\n\nExplore\n\nIt\u2019s 1969, in the middle of the Gulf of California. Above is a blazing hot\nsky; below, the blue sea stretches for miles in all directions, interrupted\nonly by the presence of an oceanographic research ship. Aboard it a man walks\nto the railing, studies the water, pauses to consider, then slips over the\nside. This is Bill Hamner.\n\nOn this day, Hamner will unknowingly set into motion a series of events that,\nseveral decades later, will result in multiple National Geographic articles,\nthe birth of an international tourist destination, and a fundamental shift in\nhow scientists think about open ocean biology. But Hamner doesn\u2019t know any of\nthis. At this moment, he is both literally and figuratively treading water.\nHe\u2019s hot, the deck is sweltering, and he\u2019s looking, desperately, for something\nmeaningful to do with his career.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> The biologists go about their work as if this is how it should be.\n\nHamner doesn\u2019t really belong onboard. An ornithologist by training, he has\ndedicated his career to understanding the inner workings of birds; already he\nhas illuminated some of the physiological mechanisms that calibrate the\nbreeding cycles of avian bodies to the sun\u2019s rise and set. He does this\nornithology work as an assistant professor at the University of California,\nDavis, a valuable position because it offers the possibility of tenure, and\ntenure means security for his wife and two small children. But then Hamner\nbroke out in hives. He started having asthma attacks. After years of close\ncontact, he had developed a devastating allergy to birds.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nHamner released his house finches and starlings and bobolinks. But what would\nhe do next? He tried growing jellyfish and wound up with stinging vats of\njelly goo. He tried growing moths instead and ended up with a freezer\u2019s worth\nof rotten apples. Now he was here, his presence on the expedition a favor from\nthe oceanographer who was running it, hoping for a clue as to what he might do\nnext.\n\nDuring his time on board, Hamner has watched his fellow biologists walk around\nthe deck, deploying giant nets with big metal cranes. The nets sink into the\ncool deep, where they\u2019re dragged for hours before being hauled back to the\nsurface. Everything inside them is a sloshing, shredded slurry. Not a single\nanimal appears unharmed. The biologists go about their work as if this is how\nit should be: piecing together the lives of ocean animals by picking through\nbuckets containing their literal pieces.\n\nIn fact, this is the way most marine biology in the open ocean, the vastness\nbeyond coastal waters, had been conducted. While renegades like William\nBeebe\u2014the first man to traverse the deep in a submersible\u2014insisted on being in\nthe water, most biologists traveled the ocean at the remove of a vessel\u2019s\ndeck, hauling marine life up for examination. Hamner couldn\u2019t work this way.\n\nGETTING READY: Bill and Peggy Hamner on the dock in Bimini, where they\ndeveloped the techniques they\u2014and future generations of marine\nbiologists\u2014would use to study open-ocean life.

Though they now live far from the ocean\nin Northport, Alabama, their home is filled with sculptures, photographs, and\ndrawings from decades working on the water. Reflecting on his motivations,\nHamner told me, \u201cTo study the natural history of any animal in its own\nenvironment, one must observe it undisturbed over time.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d been trained as an ornithologist; he had watched birds in the wild and\nstudied them in aviaries. He had to see the whole living animal. And on that\nsweltering day in the Gulf of Mexico, he absolutely had to get off the frying\npan of a ship\u2019s deck.\n\nHis face mask secure, Hamner plunged into the ocean and looked around.\n\nOrganisms resembling translucent bowls, which Hamner recognized as jellyfish,\npulsed through the current. Comb jellies shaped like stemless wine glasses\nshimmered with rainbow patterns. Hamner\u2019s eyes settled on rhythmically-\nbeating, barrel-shaped creatures, roughly the size of his hand, which clenched\nand relaxed like the valve of a heart. Hamner vaguely recognized them, as he\nhad a jar of something similar back at his lab. It was labeled \u201csalp\u201d: a group\nof invertebrates closely related to vertebrates. But this salp was smooth and\nrobust, not at all like the mangled pile of jelly in his jar.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Robison\nwas a marine biologist through and through\u2014but unlike Hamner with his birds,\nRobison had spent his career far removed from the life he studied, using nets\nas other marine biologists did. It wasn\u2019t until Hamner came aboard that\nsomeone thought to jump into the open ocean and immerse themselves in the\nworld of their study subjects.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this phrase about a feeling for the organism,\u201d says Michael Dawson, a\nmarine biologist at the University of California, Merced. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\nBill brought.\u201d\n\nHamner and Robison spotted a fish hovering in the water, watching them swim.\nLooking closer, they realized that the fish was inside a salp, hiding in the\nopen central chamber while the clear barrel beat around it. As if the fish\nwere also an explorer, riding in a salp submarine.\n\n\u201cRobison went back to the ship,\u201d recalls Hamner now, and vowed to throw out\nhis nets. Later he was hired by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,\nwhere he became a pioneer of studying midwater ecology with remotely operated\nvehicles. As for Hamner, he was enthralled. If all that life could be seen\njust below the surface, what else might be out there? He had found something\nnew to do with his life.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Peggy had trained as a scientific librarian, but she dropped\nout after they were married, following her husband, as most women did in those\ntimes. But, like her childhood hero Osa Johnson, she dreamed of trekking\nthrough jungles and sailing over uncharted waters. Together, Bill and Peggy\nHamner hatched a plan: They would visit as many marine labs as they could,\nsettle on the best for diving in the open ocean, and develop a method to study\nlife between the ocean surface and the deeps, a region that sailors called the\n\u201cblue water.\u201d\n\nThey eventually settled on the small Bahamian Island of Bimini, off the coast\nof Miami, Florida. They recruited a handful of students and pooled all the\nmoney they could find, from student scholarships to National Science\nFoundation grants. Then, with their two young kids in tow, they set off for\nBimini.\n\nThings did not start well.\n\n> A shark ate my weight belt.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhen they arrived they discovered that there was no room for them in the\nLerner Marine Laboratory\u2019s visitor housing. In desperation they rented half of\na nearby duplex. The Hamners and their kids slept in one room, their students\nin another, with one student sleeping under dining room chairs so no one would\nstep on him in the night. Hamner\u2019s father, who\u2019d accompanied them to help with\nchildcare, slept on the porch. Eventually they moved into a half-built house\nwith the beams and bricks exposed. Short on funds, the students would wander\nto the local sportfishing dock, asking fishers to donate the meat of their\ncatch.\n\nDuring the day they loaded a small boat with their SCUBA gear and started\nexperimenting with blue-water diving. This too started poorly. \u201cA shark ate my\nweight belt,\u201d recalls Alice Alldredge, one of Hamner\u2019s former students. She\nhad dropped the belt and was swimming to fetch it when a shark swam underneath\nand swallowed it whole. Another shark slammed Peggy Hamner in the back.\nSharks, it seemed, were a problem. The team started carrying long wooden\nsticks on their dives and used them to poke the sharks away.\n\nSlowly, they built up a method for blue-water diving. They worked out a\ntechnique involving a weighted rope anchored to a float and a contraption they\ncalled the \u201ctrapeze.\u201d All the divers clipped their own ropes to the central\ntrapeze, and a safety diver floated at the nexus, watching everyone, ensuring\nthat no one got tangled or detached, or sank too deep or drifted away or got\nattacked by a shark. And because the animals of the open ocean are almost\ncompletely transparent, the divers determined that the best way to spot\nfloating life was to look slightly up, toward the sun, searching for the\nshadows creatures made as they passed in front of the light.\n\n\u201cDropping slowly into the clear blue water as the light darkened, and\nvisibility expanded forever, made me feel like an astronaut floating in\nspace,\u201d recalls Peggy Hamner. \u201cEvery dive.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

He gave it to one of his students, Ron Gilmer,\nwho was studying snails. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d Gilmer said, grabbing the jar. \u201cI think\nthis is Gleba!\u201d Gleba were, and still are, among the open ocean\u2019s most elusive\nsnails. They flap two extensions of their body, like wings, and have clear\ncrystalline shells that look a bit like glass slippers. Very few people have\nseen one, and almost no one has seen one alive. Over the coming days Gilmer\ndocumented wild Gleba for the first time, and in so doing, discovered\nsomething totally unexpected.\n\n\u201cThey feed with mucus,\u201d he told me. \u201cGiant balls of mucus.\u201d As they drift,\nGleba hang from the base of a large balloon made from snail slime. They sail\non these until the mucus collects a mass of floating edible particles, at\nwhich time the snails slurp the whole thing up, mucus and all. No one had ever\nseen a snail feed this way. For days, every time Gilmer went out he watched as\nwhole fields of Gleba drifted by, the water crowded with clear balloons and\nthe butterfly-like snails who flapped beneath them. But then one day they were\nall gone, as if they\u2019d never been there.\n\nThe Hamners and their students would go on to describe how open ocean species\ndrift with currents that quickly shift and change, washing animals in one day,\ndrawing them out the next. Gilmer would publish his paper on Gleba in the\nprestigious journal Science, with Hamner insisting that Gilmer, who did much\nof the work, be the sole author\u2014a generosity that\u2019s virtually unheard of\ntoday, where academic culture demands that most senior scientists add their\nnames to papers even when not particularly involved. Hamner\u2019s student Larry\nMadin would discover that salps, those heart-pumping glass barrels, are some\nof the ocean\u2019s most efficient feeders. After his time at Bimini, Madin would\ngo on to study salps at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where he found\nthat salps may export large amounts of carbon to the deep ocean.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Hamner\nand Alldredge collected samples, with Hamner even constructing a small oven to\ndry and weigh them. Alldredge would later go on to conduct pioneering research\non this phenomenon, called marine snow. She would eventually be inducted into\nthe National Academies of Science. Another student, Neil Swanburg, studied\nlarge comb jellies that floated like Christmas tree ornaments in the water. He\nwent on to study these and other open-ocean organisms, making important\ndiscoveries about their biology and role as open-ocean predators.\n\n> Dropping slowly into the clear blue water as the light darkened made me feel\n> like an astronaut floating in space.\n\nBill Hamner was back on track. He now had a new field of study, successful\npapers and grants, and his students were becoming experts in their own right.\nHamner was offered tenure at UC Davis on the basis of his work in Bimini and\nhis earlier work with birds. But the time Hamner and Peggy spent at Bimini\nchanged things. They were explorers now, and job security was not as appealing\nas it had once been. Together they decided that Bill should turn down the\noffer; they traded a stable academic life for the life of drifters, just like\nthe species they studied. They wouldn\u2019t always know when and where their funds\nwould come from, but in exchange for that uncertainty they could explore and\ntravel on the currents of an endless curiosity.\n\nIn Australia, they documented the critical importance of floating open-ocean\nlife for coral reefs, and described how open-ocean animals would drift toward\nshore and be consumed by hungry corals and reef fish. In Palau, they conducted\nthe first studies on jellyfish in saltwater lagoons, literally cutting the\nfirst trail to the now-celebrated Jellyfish Lake. They brought along a team\nfrom National Geographic who would make that lake\u2019s golden jellies famous,\ndrawing visitors from around the world and spawning a whole industry in the\nregion. In Antarctica, they were the first scientists to document the\nschooling behavior of Antarctic krill, diving into massive schools that\nshifted like starling murmurations around them.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In 1988\nHamner was hired as a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nNo longer diving, they\u2019ve now come to rest at the University of Alabama, where\nthey teach in an outreach adult education program: two tenacious, curious,\ninfinitely adventurous scientific visionaries.\n\nLead photo by Laurence Madin\n\n  * ###### Rebecca R.
