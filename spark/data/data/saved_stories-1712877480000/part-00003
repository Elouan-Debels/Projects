Here\u2019s Boom\u2019s XB-1 jet taking its maiden flight:\n\nIt was a historic moment for humanity. It was also an emotional moment for us\nat YC because we\u2019ve been hoping this day would come since Blake was in the W16\nbatch, walking around with a plastic model of the plane he hoped to build.\n\nMost people know YC for funding software companies. But some of our most\nsuccessful companies are the ones doing incredible things in the real world \u2014\nthe hard tech companies. They\u2019re 3D printing rockets, launching satellites\ninto space, engineering organisms, and developing fusion energy.\n\nPeople are often puzzled by how companies like that could get started at YC.\nHow could 3 months and $500K be sufficient to get something that ambitious off\nthe ground?\n\nWell, it turns out it is. There\u2019s always a way to peel off a first step. That\nfirst step gives investors confidence that you might be able to do this, which\nlets you fund the second step and so on for as many steps as you need.\n\nIn this latest episode of Lightcone, Garry, Diana, Harj and I talk about a\nnumber of YC\u2019s hard tech companies and just how far they\u2019ve come since Day 1.\nBelow are just some of them - we cover these, and more, in the episode above.\n\nBoom Supersonic: Bringing supersonic passenger flights back to humanity. At\nleft, the scale model they had before Demo Day; at right, their prototype jet\ntaking its first flight in March of 2024.\n\nRelativity Space: 3D printed rockets. For Demo Day in the Winter 2016 batch,\nthey managed to print a rocket engine \u2014 a small one, but one that could be\nfired up and produce thrust. In March of 2023, they launched the world\u2019s first\n3D printed rocket into space.\n\nCruise: When Cruise applied to YC in 2014, Kyle Vogt\u2019s goal of making a self-\ndriving car seemed impossible for a startup. It would take billions of dollars\n\u2014 more than any startup can raise \u2014 and Google was already way ahead. By Demo\nDay, Cruise had a basic car able to drive itself down highways. In 2016,\nCruise was acquired by GM for around $1B. GM then did in fact invest billions\nof dollars into the project, and Kyle brought it all the way to the streets of\nSan Francisco. After knowing the full history, getting to ride to work in a\nCruise car was a surreal experience.\n\nAstranis: Building smaller, cheaper telecommunications satellites. They set\nout to build a functional prototype in time for Demo Day W16 \u2014 they pulled it\noff. By 2018, they had prototypes in space. Now they\u2019ve got a massive\nsatellite-building factory right across the street from YC\u2019s SF HQ, and have\nmultiple satellites in orbit.\n\nRemora: Retrofitting semi-trucks to capture the CO2 emissions that would\notherwise be released into the atmosphere. One of our favorite stories about\nthis one: the founders met after one of them came across the other\u2019s PhD\ndissertation (\u201cMobile carbon capture from heavy-duty vehicles\u201d) and convinced\nthem to start a company.\n\nSeabound: Also capturing carbon emissions, but for cargo ships. During the\nbatch they were able to get ship owners \u2014 many of whom are facing increasingly\nstrict emissions regulations \u2014 to sign key LOIs; shortly thereafter, they ran\ntheir first pilot program on an actual ship.\n\nSolugen: Producing chemicals like hydrogen peroxide with a new process that\u2019s\nbased on synthetic biology. When they applied to YC, they\u2019d managed to produce\none small beaker of hydrogen peroxide just to prove they could. By Demo Day,\nthey were making gallons in a garage. Now they produce it in industrial\nquantities from a full-scale plant in Houston.\n\nCategories\n\nVideo\n\nOther Posts\n\nIntroducing our newest video series: Office Hours\n\nJuly 21, 2023 by Garry Tan, Greg Kumparak\n\nRead More\n\nFirst Five Hires with PostHog\n\nAugust 16, 2022 by Y Combinator\n\nRead More\n\nUpdates for Startup School 2019 and Office Hours with Kevin Hale\n\nJuly 3, 2019 by Y Combinator\n\nRead More\n\nSubscribe\n\n# Author\n\n  * ### Jared Friedman\n\nJared is Managing Director, Software and Group Partner at YC.
