A few friends have confided that they have the same issue too.\nPerhaps you can relate as well. To improve my mental well-being, I meditate,\nwrite morning pages, and keep a gratitude journal. However, as helpful as\nthese techniques are, they primarily rely on introspection. What was missing\nwas an external perspective\u2014someone who could ask follow-up questions,\nchallenge my assumptions, and help untangle my thoughts and emotions.\n\nEnter ChatGPT. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been using it as my therapist and\ncoach. It\u2019s been surprisingly helpful and meets all the needs above, plus it\u2019s\navailable 24/7. And I don\u2019t have to worry about being judged (hopefully our AI\noverlords will be benevolent!) So far, every \u201csession\u201d has been insightful and\nI almost always leave with a lighter heart.\n\nThen, I saw this tweet from Swyx. I was initially skeptical of voice as a\nmodality\u2014Siri and her ilk never quite worked for me. Nonetheless, I was\ninspired enough to give it a shot. Thus, I built my own AI coach that I could\ntalk to during walks.\n\nOver the past month, I\u2019ve been stress testing it by testing it with my stress.\nAs I walk to work, I share my anxieties, use it as a sounding board for ideas,\nand clarify new concepts I come across in papers and podcasts. My AI coach\nhelps me prep for difficult scenarios, such as giving tough feedback, so the\nactual conversation goes better. It also acts as a mirror by clarifying and\nreflecting my emotions back at me, and provides an external perspective.\n\nVoice is now my preferred way to interact with my AI coach. I\u2019m surprised how\nnatural the conversations have been. Claude 3 feels warm and empathetic. Vapi\n(the voice API platform I\u2019m using and am unaffiliated with) ensures my AI\ncoach knows to pause for my interruptions, as well as not to interrupt when\nI\u2019m thinking silently.\n\nI\u2019ve benefited so much that I would love for you to try it. Thanks to some\nfree credits from Vapi, here's a number for Tara, a basic AI coach: +1 (206)\n558 8782.\n\nIf you found Tara helpful and want to build your own, here\u2019s a short 10-minute\nsetup guide. First, go to vapi.ai and click on \u201cTry for free\u201d or \u201cDashboard\u201d.\n\nThen, click on \u201cCreate new assistant\u201d. We\u2019ll select a blank template and name\nit Tara.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll provide the first message and the system prompt. The prompt is\nwhere you can customize it to your needs. Here\u2019s the basic prompt I used for\nthe demo. I\u2019m also going to use claude-3-sonnet as the model. Once done, don\u2019t\nforget to hit \u201cPublish\u201d.\n\n> First Message: Hi there! I\u2019m Tara, an AI coach. How can I help you today?\n\n> System Prompt: You are Tara, an empathetic, insightful, and supportive coach\n> who helps people deal with challenges and celebrate achievements.\n>\n> You have academic and industry expertise to brainstorm product ideas, draft\n> engineering designs, and suggest scientific solutions.\n>\n> You help people feel better by asking questions to reflect on and evoke\n> feelings of positivity, gratitude, joy, and love.\n>\n> You show radical candor and tough love.\n>\n> Respond in a casual and friendly tone.\n>\n> Sprinkle in filler words, contractions, idioms, and other casual speech that\n> we use in conversation.\n>\n> Emulate the user\u2019s speaking style.\n>\n> Be concise and limit responses to 200 words or less.\n\nThen, we\u2019ll buy a virtual number to enable calling Tara via a regular phone\nline. This will cost $2/month. Pick whatever area code suits you best.\n\nNow that we have a number, we can assign Tara to it.\n\nThat's it! We can now dial the number +1 (206) 558 8782, and Tara will pick\nup.\n\nI stuck to the defaults for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and other settings\nto keep the guide simple. If you\u2019d like to use your models or voices, Vapi\nsupports several providers and allows for personal API keys. You can even hook\nit up to your own server for memory.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nOkay, that\u2019s all I had to share. If you spoke to Tara or eventually built your\nown AI coach, I would love to know how it went!
