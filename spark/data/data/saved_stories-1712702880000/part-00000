We'll put the code AI assistants\nthrough various real-world scenarios and see if they make the developer's life\neasier or harder.\n\n## Setup\n\nFor this blog post, we'll use a production-grade application to test how the\ntwo code AI assistants handle scenarios, from teaching me about a codebase to\nhelping me set it up, add new functionality, debug, and more.\n\nI will be using Visual Studio Code, and I have two versions installed locally:\nthe latest stable version of Visual Studio Code and an Insiders version. On\neach of these versions, I have either Cody or Copilot installed as the only\nextension. I will be using the same prompts for each assistant and will\nprovide thoughts and commentary on their output. The codebase we'll be using\nfor these scenarios is for a web application called Video Tap that allows\nusers to repurpose their long-form video-based content into various written\nand short-form video formats. Let's dive in!\n\n## Scenario: Learning about a codebase\n\nFor our first scenario, let's place ourselves in the shoes of a new developer\nonboarding onto a codebase. Without a code AI assistant, the developer would\nlikely first look at the README.md file to see if it gives a good overview or\nperhaps reach out to the maintainer of the codebase for a walkthrough.\n\nIn my personal experience, the README.md files of projects are often hit or\nmiss. They may include an amazing overview and instructions, or they may be\ncompletely blank and everything in between. With a code AI assistant that\nsupports chat functionality, we can ask it to tell us what a codebase does.\nLet's try it with Cody and Copilot to see which one does better.\n\nOur query will be: \"What does this application do?\"\n\nBoth Cody and Copilot were able to give us an answer to our query. Cody is on\nthe left-hand side, and Copilot is on the right. Copilot told us about the\ndifferent technologies used in the repository, while Cody told us the tech\nstack, APIs used, as well as the major features of the application.\n\nCody also cites its sources, and we can see in the above screenshot that Cody\nused 14 files from our codebase to get enough context to generate a detailed\nresponse. Copilot, on the other hand, does not provide visibility into how it\ncame up with the answer.\n\nI think we can give Cody the win in our first scenario. After round one, the\nscore stands at:\n\nCody - 1\n\nCopilot - 0\n\n## Scenario: Setting up the development environment\n\nNow that our developer knows a little bit about what the application does, the\nnext logical thing for them to do is to figure out how to set up the local\ndevelopment environment so that they can run the application and make code\nchanges themselves. Without a code AI assistant, the developer would again\nlikely search for a README.md file or similar instructions on how to get set\nup. But with Cody and Copilot ready, we can ask them how to get this\napplication running locally.\n\nThe query we'll pose is: \"How do I start this app up in development mode?\"\n\nThe difference in response quality here highlights the importance of having\nquality context for the code AI assistant.\n\nCody read 12 files to generate the response and walked us through installing\nthe required JavaScript and PHP dependencies, setting up an .env file,\ncreating a local database, running a database migration to set up the correct\ntables and seed data, and finally starting the server.\n\nCopilot, on the other hand, initially told us to navigate to the project\ndirectory, but since we are already in the project directory, this step is\nunnecessary. Copilot then told us to install the dependencies and run the\nproject. But there were some glaring issues. Without a proper .env file in the\nproject directory, the app will not start. Not only that, but the npm start\ncommand, while common in Node and JavaScript projects, does not exist in this\ncodebase. To start the local server, this codebase requires running the npm\nrun dev command, which Cody correctly suggested.\n\nWith Cody, if we followed the instructions, we would have our local\nenvironment up and running. In contrast, with Copilot, we would run into\nissues ranging from missing environment variables and missing database tables\nto our frontend not building at all. We have to give Cody the win here as\nwell. Our score now stands at:\n\nCody - 2\n\nCopilot - 0\n\n## Scenario: Familiarize yourself with the code\n\nNow that we know a bit about what the application does and have it running\nlocally, let's ask our code AI assistants some questions about how the actual\napplication functions. In this application, we'll be working a lot with video\nfiles, so let's ask about the current capabilities that exist. The first\nquestion we'll ask is: \"What are the properties on the video model?\"\n\nCody finds the Video model and provides us with the various properties that\nare present on it. Copilot states that it does not have direct access to our\ncodebase and therefore does not know what properties exist on the Video model.\nIt does try to guess and assume some properties that may or may not exist.\n\nGetting the properties of a model is neat, but not something to necessarily\nwrite home about. Let's try a trickier question. In this project, we spend a\nlot of time working with LLMs and one of the most important things is keeping\ntrack of costs. Let's ask our code AI assistants how we can calculate our\ncosts for a video. The query will be: \"How do I calculate the OpenAI cost for\na video?\"\n\nCody is able to find an existing function called calculateOpenAICost() and\ngives us a detailed explanation of what this function does, how it works, and\nwhere it's located if we want to learn more. Copilot on the other hand gives\nus some generic suggestions on how to calculate the cost of an OpenAI call,\nwhich we'll then have to dive deeper into and validate ourselves. With these\ntwo examples, I think we can give Cody the win here as well.\n\nCody - 3\n\nCopilot - 0\n\n## Scenario: Adding new functionality to our codebase\n\nNow we get to the fun parts -- writing code. As developers, we are accustomed\nto having our IDE making it easier to write code through syntax highlighting,\nIntelliSense, and other enhancements that make it easier for us to focus on\nthe hard parts. Code AI assistants can go a step further here in writing some\nor a lot of the code for us.\n\nFor our next scenario, we want to add a new action to our codebase that will\nallow us to trim a video. This will allow us to splice up longer videos into\nsmaller more manageable files for further processing. The API that we are\nusing to trim the video requires that we give it the trim start and end times\nin a SMPTE timecode format. In our codebase, we store all video durations in\nmilliseconds. So what we need to do is to add a function to convert our start\nand end times from milliseconds to a valid SMPTE timecode format.\n\nWe can write this function ourselves or we can ask our code AI assistants to\ndo it. Let's opt for the latter. Our query is: \"Write a function to convert\nmilliseconds to a timecode format\".\n\nHere Copilot generates a working function, but there's one problem--it's in\nthe wrong language. Cody recognizes we're working in a PHP codebase and\ngenerates the code in PHP.\n\nThis is another perfect example of why context is so important. Cody inferred\nthat since we have a .php file open, we probably want our implementation in\nPHP, whereas Copilot lacking the context gave us a general solution in a\ndifferent language. If we were to insert the two functions into our file, the\nCody millisecondsToTimecode function would work, but the Copilot msToTimecode\nwould throw all sorts of errors. Cody wins here as well, but we'll give\nCopilot half a point because it did give us a working solution.\n\nCody - 4\n\nCopilot - 0.5\n\n## Scenario: Editing code in our codebase\n\nWe'll use the millisecondsToTimecode function that Cody gave us and continue\nadding functionality to our application. The timecode conversion function that\nboth Cody and Copilot returned gives us a string in the format of \"00:00:00\"\nand while this is valid, we should also add the number of frames between a\nsecond. This will ensure that we trim the video at max precision. So the full\nformat becomes hour:minute:second:frame.\n\nTo get the frame count, we'll need to know the frame rate at which the video\nwas encoded and the remainder of milliseconds, if any, we have for our trim\noperation. Let's ask Cody and Copilot to update the existing function to\naccommodate our needs.\n\nFor Cody, with my TrimVideoAction.php file open, I was able to say \"add the\nframe number to the timecode\" and Cody had enough context to understand that I\nwas talking about the millisecondsToTimecode() function, and it gave me an\nupdated function that also added the number of left-over frames if any.\n\nFor Copilot, I tried the same query, but Copilot could not understand that I\nwanted to update the millisecondsToTimecode() function, so eventually I had to\nask the question and copy and paste the function into the chat window to get a\nworking result. Copilot was able to understand my prompt and returned an\nupdated millisecondsToTimecode() function that also returned the frame count.\nThe one thing that I think Copilot did better was it made the frame rate a\nparameter. Videos typically have varying frame rates typically ranging from\n24fps to 30fps, and the frame rate is something we store in the Video model as\na value because each video is different, so this was a nice touch.\n\nCody also supports commands, and one of the most used commands is the /edit\ncommand, which allows us to highlight a piece of code and tell Cody to update\nit based on the prompt. I ran the /edit command and asked Cody to make the\nframe rate a parameter, and it was also able to achieve the task.\n\nSince both Cody and Copilot did eventually give us the right answer, but we\nhad to do some workarounds to make it happen, I will give each one half a\npoint. The score now stands at:\n\nCody - 4.5\n\nCopilot - 1\n\n## Scenario: Autocomplete\n\nSo far we've primarily used the chat features of Cody and Copilot to help us\nlearn and write code. While having a natural language conversation is great,\nwhere code AI assistants really live or die is by their autocomplete\nfunctionality. Autocomplete allows the code AI assistant to provide helpful\ncode completions to the developer as they are writing code in their IDE.\n\nGoing back to our codebase at hand and building on top of what we already\nhave, let's see how helpful Cody and Copilot are when it comes to helping us\nautocomplete our code. Still working out of the TrimVideoAction.php file,\nlet's continue building our action. Since we know we'll need the framerate of\nour video for the millisecondsToTimecode() function, let's get it and see if\nCody and Copilot can complete the code for us. I'll start by declaring a\nvariable called $fps and will let the code AI assistant do the rest.\n\nCody gave us the suggested completion of $video->avg_frame_rate from the\nstart. This was exactly the property we were looking for so I could just hit\nthe tab button on my keyboard to accept the completion and move on.\n\nCopilot on the other hand struggled. At first, it suggested a hard coded 30 as\nthe suggestion. So I started typing $video to give it a hint that I'm going to\nbe getting this value from the video object. Then Copilot suggested the\ncompletion of ->fps which does not exist on the $video object. So if I were to\naccept this suggestion I would start seeing red squiggly lines telling me\nsomething is wrong. Only when I basically completed the line myself did\nCopilot provide the final part to complete my code.\n\nThis really highlights the importance of having the right context. With the\nright context, a code AI assistant can be a helpful ally, but with bad or the\nwrong context, it causes more trouble than it's worth. If you'd like to learn\nmore about the lifecycle of a Cody code completion, check out this in-depth\nblog post.\n\nMoving forward, when I navigated to the next line, both Cody and Copilot gave\nme the next autocompletion to convert the $beginInMilliseconds value to a\ntimecode format exactly the same.\n\nTesting this code works and we're able to successfully convert our\nmilliseconds to a timecode format that will allow our API to trim the video at\nthe precise time we declare. For our final autocompletion test, let's see if\nour code AI assistant can help us with the next steps which will be to call\nthe AWS Elemental MediaConvert API to process the video trimming.\n\nI will start us off by adding the comment // Call AWS Elemental Media Convert\nAPI to trim video, hitting enter, and observing what each code AI assistant\ndoes.\n\nSince we make extensive use of the AWS Elemental MediaConvert API, Cody was\nable to find how we've invoked it in other actions and gave us helpful\ncompletions every step of the way. What really blew me away was the fact that\nit also found and suggested the required endpoint in our AWS client\nconfiguration for this API.\n\nCopilot on the other hand struggled at every step of the way. From suggesting\nnon-existing functions like createMediaConvert() to setting the wrong region\nfor our codebase, the autocompletions were all unusable without me having to\ngo in and fix every line of code manually. I have to give Cody the win here as\nwell. The score now stands at:\n\nCody - 5.5\n\nCopilot - 1\n\n## Scenario: Finding and fixing issues\n\nIf you have been paying very close attention to the code we've been writing so\nfar, you may have found a subtle issue. If you want to go try to find it\nyourself, scroll back up now.\n\nThe handle function for the TrimVideoAction accepts three parameters: a video\nthat is of type Video, and two strings for the begin and end times in\nmilliseconds. But our millisecondsToTimecode function takes in the\nmilliseconds to be converted as an integer value. Since we are writing this\napp in PHP without strict typing enabled, the interpreter will cast our values\nand the code will run, but we're better programmers than that.\n\nLet's ask Cody and Copilot to fix this issue for us and see how they do. With\nCody, we can again use a command called /edit to give instructions on a\nhighlighted piece of code. With Copilot I had to use the chat experience.\n\nBoth Cody and Copilot were able to understand my instructions and offered a\nvery similar fix. Cody suggested we use the intval() function to convert a\nstring to an integer, while Copilot suggested a direct type cast to int. Both\napproaches work in this case. Cody also suggested that we convert the $fps\nvariable that holds the framerate of the video to an integer as well since the\nmillisecondsToTimecode() function is expecting it to be an integer as well.\n\nOne additional feature that Cody has for finding potential issues is a command\ncalled /smell. This command will take a look at a file or highlighted piece of\ncode and provide further suggestions and improvements. This command can be\nvery useful in finding subtle issues or edge cases that may not appear at an\ninitial glance. Let's see if Cody can identify any code smells for us so far.\n\nCody gave us five suggestions for improving our code. The suggestions were to:\n\n  1. Validate input parameters\n\n  2. Use dependency injection for the AWS client\n\n  3. Add logging and telemetry\n\n  4. Extract the AWS logic into a separate service class\n\n  5. And add caching for our AWS client\n\nThese are all really good and valid suggestions. Alongside each suggestion\nCody also gave us the code to implement the suggestions. Since both Cody and\nCopilot were helpful here, we'll give each of them a point. The score now\nstands at:\n\nCody - 6.5\n\nCopilot - 2\n\n## Scenario: Generating tests for your code\n\nLeveraging code AI assistants to write code is a very common use case, but for\nme, I love using code AI assistants to take care of the more mundane tasks.\nOne such case that I often dislike doing, but needs to be done, is generating\nunit tests for my code. Both Cody and Copilot can help here. Cody and Copilot\nhave built-in commands to generate tests. Let's see how well it does for the\nmillisecondsToTimecode() function we added earlier in this blog post.\n\nBoth Cody and Copilot do a good enough job at creating passing unit tests.\nWhile Cody added multiple test scenarios, Copilot did a better job with the\nfunction name as well as documenting the steps for the test. Both of the tests\ncan pass so we'll give each code AI assistant a point.\n\nCody - 7.5\n\nCopilot - 3\n\n## Scenario: Documenting your code\n\nJust like writing unit tests, writing documentation for our code is something\nthat many developers don't necessarily love doing, but it needs to be done to\nmake sure our code is maintainable. There is nothing worse than opening up a\nfile that's been untouched for many years and it is lacking any sort of\ndocumentation. Code AI assistants can help in two ways here: explaining\nundocumented code in layman's terms and generating documentation for\nundocumented code so that the next brave souls that look at the code can have\na better experience. Let's see how Cody and Copilot handle these two use\ncases.\n\nLet's open up a random file that does not have any comments. I'll open up a\nfile called TrimClipAndSendToAWSS3.php. Let's ask Cody and Copilot to explain\nwhat this code does. Both Cody and Copilot have an /explain command that we'll\nuse.\n\nBoth Cody and Copilot do a great job of explaining what the given code does.\nCopilot is a little bit more verbose and goes into great detail as to what\neach piece of code is doing, whereas Cody focuses on the unique bits related\nto the handle function where the implementation logic for this action is\nlocated.\n\nSince both code AI assistants did pretty well, we'll give each of them a\npoint. Let's see how they do in documenting the code for us. Both Cody and\nCopilot have a command to generate documentation, so we'll use these commands\nand evaluate the results.\n\nBoth Cody and Copilot successfully generated documentation directly in the\neditor. Cody was a bit more verbose this time, but the quality of both was\nacceptable. We'll give a point to each code AI assistant. With two points\navailable in the documentation section and each assistant getting the two\npoints, our score is now:\n\nCody - 9.5\n\nCopilot - 5\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we put two popular code AI assistants, GitHub Copilot and\nSourcegraph Cody, head to head to see which one offered a better experience to\nthe developer. We used a real production-grade web application with tens of\nthousands of lines of code across thousands of files. We then crafted common\nscenarios that developers encounter every day and saw how the two code AI\nassistants were able to help. Cody came out as the clear winner, taking home\n9.5 out of 10 points across ten different scenarios. Copilot managed to get 5\nout of 10 points.\n\nThe biggest differentiator that made Cody stand out was its superior context.\nUnderstanding not only the user intent but the entire codebase and being able\nto search for relevant snippets of code before sending a request to an LLM\nhelped Cody provide the right answer or code autocompletion the first time.\nCody is the only AI coding assistant that knows your entire codebase and in\nthis post we were able to show you why that matters. Give Cody a try on your\ncodebase today.\n\n### Get Cody, the AI coding assistant\n\nCody makes it easy to write, fix, and maintain code.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Products\n\n  * Cody\n  * Code Search\n\n## Solutions\n\n  * Enterprise\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Library\n  * Customer stories\n  * Changelog\n  * Documentation\n  * Community\n  * Support forum\n\n## Company\n\n  * About\n  * Careers - We're hiring!\n  * Contact\n  * Handbook\n  * Sourcegraph strategy\n\n  * \u00a9 2024 Sourcegraph, Inc.\n  * Terms\n  * Security\n  * Privacy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
