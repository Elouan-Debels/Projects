This state indicates a fully integrated and properly managed package.\n\n  * -unused is when the package is locally installed, and a corresponding dependency is declared in pyproject.toml or requirements.txt, but is not actively used in the project. Caveat: This package must not be a dependency of any actively -used package to be considered unused.\n\n  * -untracked is when the package is installed, and one of it's aliases is actively used in the project, but is not declared in pyproject.toml or requirements.txt. This highlights packages that are implicitly used but not formally declared, which may lead to inconsistencies or issues in dependency management and deployment.\n\n## Usage\n\n    \n    \n    \u276f unpack \ud83d\udce6 Unused Packages package | version | size --------------+--------------+---------- scikit-learn | ^1.4.1.post1 | 33.2 MiB pydantic | ^1.9.0 | 7.2 MiB keras | ^3.0.5 | 3.9 MiB \ud83d\udcbd Total disk space: 44.3 MiB Note: There might be false-positives. For example, Unpack cannot detect usage of packages that are not imported under `[tool.poetry.*]`. Similarly, it can only detect declared packages in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml.\n\nFor more documentation, please refer to the unpack crate documentation\n\n## Installation\n\n### On macOS\n\nYou can install unpack with Homebrew\n\n    \n    \n    brew tap bnkc/tap brew install unpack\n\n... or with MacPorts:\n\n    \n    \n    sudo port install [COMING SOON]\n\n### On crates.io\n\n    \n    \n    cargo install un-pack --locked\n\nAlternatively, you can install unpack directly from the repository by using:\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/bnkc/unpack cargo install --path ./unpack\n\nWarning\n\nThere are scenarios where using Unpack can yield false positives. Mapping\nsite-packages to their corresponding dependencies/imports are not always a 1:1\nrelationship. For Example: scikit-learn is imported as sklearn. Alot of\ndecisions were made based on Metadata for Python Software Packages\n\n### Command-line options\n\nThis is the output of un-pack -h. To see the full set of command-line options,\nuse un-pack --help which also includes a much more detailed help text.\n\n    \n    \n    Usage: un-pack [OPTIONS] Options: -b, --base-directory <BASE_DIRECTORY> The path to the directory to search for Python files. [default: .] -s, --package-status <STATUS> Select the packages status to search for [default: unused] [possible values: used, unused, untracked] -i, --ignore-hidden Ignore hidden files and directories. -d, --max-depth <DEPTH> Set maximum search depth (default: none) -o, --output <OUTPUT> The output format to use allows for the selection of the output format for the results of the unused packages search. The default output format is `human`. The `json` format is also available [default: human] [possible values: human, json] -t, --dep-type <DEP_TYPE> Select the depencency specification file of choice if more than one exists. By default, `pyproject.toml` is selected [default: poetry] [possible values: pip, poetry] -h, --help Print help (see more with '--help') -V, --version Print version\n\n## Thank you\n\nUnpack is very much a labor of love. There's alot of improvements that could\nbe done, but if you find this project useful, PM me!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to Unpack, please open an issue/PR \u2764\ufe0f\n\n## About\n\nUnpack python packages\n\n### Topics\n\npython rust packages tool dependencies unused\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n2 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 1\n\nInitial Release \ud83c\udf89 Latest\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Rust 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
