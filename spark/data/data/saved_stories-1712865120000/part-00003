In the 1970s, the physicist\nStephen Hawking described a subtle process by which black holes can\n\u201cevaporate,\u201d with some particles evading gravitational oblivion. That\nphenomenon, now dubbed Hawking radiation, seems at odds with general\nrelativity, and it raises an even weirder question: If particles can escape,\ndo they preserve any information about the matter that was obliterated?\n\nLeonard Susskind, a physicist at Stanford University, found himself at odds\nwith Hawking over the answer. In this episode, co-host Janna Levin speaks with\nSusskind about the \u201cblack hole war\u201d that ensued and the powerful scientific\nlessons to be drawn from one of the most famous paradoxes in physics.\n\nListen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, TuneIn or your favorite podcasting app, or\nyou can stream it from Quanta.\n\nAll episodes\n\n00:00/00:00\n\nAPPLE\n\nSPOTIFY\n\n## Transcript\n\n[Theme plays]\n\nJANNA LEVIN: Historically depicted as inescapable voids, black holes have\nterrorized the popular imagination. Anything and everything that falls into a\nblack hole is lost forever. Or so the story goes, according to Einstein\u2019s\ngeneral theory of relativity. This defining character of black holes came\nunder scrutiny in the 1970s with a surprising challenge posed by a young and\nbrilliant but ailing British physicist, Stephen Hawking.\n\nHawking realized that through a remarkable and subtle quantum process, black\nholes could evaporate, eventually exploding entirely in a burst of radiation.\nEven in this explosion, nothing can escape. The black hole seemed to take\neverything it had consumed with it into oblivion, including all quantum\ninformation. But where did it all go?\n\nI\u2019m Janna Levin and this is \u201cThe Joy of Why,\u201d a podcast from Quanta Magazine\nwhere my co-host, Steve Strogatz, and I take turns exploring some of the\nbiggest unanswered questions in math and science today.\n\n[Theme ends]\n\nLEVIN: Few understood the significance of Hawking\u2019s results initially, but one\nscientist immediately recognized the crisis that would become known as the\ninformation loss paradox. He is here with us today, the famed physicist\nLeonard Susskind \u2014 Lenny to anyone who knows him. In today\u2019s episode, Lenny\nleads us through the Black Hole War as we ask: Is there a quantum escape hatch\nfrom black holes? And will we ever know for sure?\n\nLenny is a professor at Stanford University and the founding director of the\nStanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. He\u2019s widely regarded as the father\nof string theory, has authored a number of phenomenal books, including The\nBlack Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for\nQuantum Mechanics, and he\u2019s well-known for his research on quantum field\ntheory, quantum statistical mechanics and quantum cosmology.\n\nLenny, thanks for joining us on \u201cThe Joy of Why.\u201d\n\nLeonard Susskind\n\nLENNY SUSSKIND: Hello, Janna. Long time no see.\n\nLEVIN: Long time no see, such a pleasure to have you here.\n\nSUSSKIND: It\u2019s good to see you again.\n\nLEVIN: So, let\u2019s start at the beginning here.\n\nSUSSKIND: The beginning, the beginning. OK, the beginning.\n\nLEVIN: Well, the beginning for us is going to be the 20th century, when black\nholes were originally discovered. And I would love it if you could take us\nthrough the general relativistic understanding of black holes, without the\ncomplications of quantum mechanics.\n\nSUSSKIND: All right, well, a black hole is so attractive gravitationally that\nit just pulls everything in. The original idea of a black hole was due to\n[Pierre-Simon, Marquis de] Laplace?\n\nLEVIN: Oh, [John] Michell, I think.\n\nSUSSKIND: Michell and Laplace.\n\nLEVIN: OK, we\u2019re skipping the 20th century.\n\nSUSSKIND: Eighteenth century, 18th century.\n\nLEVIN: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSUSSKIND: Anyway, these ancients, a Frenchman and I guess an Englishman, had\nthe idea that if a star was heavy enough, it would be so attractive \u2014 not in\nthe sense of I\u2019m attractive or you\u2019re attractive, but in the sense of\ngravitational attraction \u2014 that it would pull everything in and not even light\ncould get out. They actually made a calculation of how heavy it would have to\nbe for a given size. They worked out what is called today the Schwarzschild\nradius. And they called it a dark star.\n\nLEVIN: And so this introduces this idea of an event horizon.\n\nSUSSKIND: They didn\u2019t quite have that idea. The idea came out of Einstein and\nthe general theory of relativity, that if you had such a heavy object, there\nwould be a surface around it, where anything that\u2019s inside that will fall into\nthe singularity. This surface of last escape, where if you\u2019re inside it,\nyou\u2019re doomed; if you\u2019re outside it, you have a chance. And that\u2019s called the\nhorizon of the black hole.\n\nLEVIN: Is there anything at the horizon?\n\nSUSSKIND: That is the whole question. Somebody observing the black hole from\nthe outside, doing measurements, doing telescopic observations, and also being\nallowed to lower probes down to the black hole \u2014 let\u2019s say on a fishing line;\nI used to be a fisherman. You lower your worm down to the surface of the black\nhole. What would happen is, you would see the surface of the black hole, the\nevent horizon, as being very, very hot. The poor worm would be roasted very\nquickly. So somebody on the outside would reckon that, yes, there is something\nat the horizon and whatever it is is extremely hot \u2014 so hot that, let\u2019s just\nput it this way, you wouldn\u2019t want to be there.\n\nLEVIN: This is what you would say was Hawking\u2019s result, that it would be hot.\n\nSUSSKIND: Yes, that\u2019s correct, Hawking and to some extent, a predecessor of\nHawking, [Jacob] Bekenstein. Hawking\u2019s results were clearer, they were more\nprecise. And Hawking would have agreed completely with me that that worm will\nget fried at the horizon long before you get to the singularity. On the other\nhand, if you just cut the string of your fishing line and let the worm fall\nthrough the horizon, the story goes that the horizon would be a non-event for\nthe worm. The worm would just fly through, observing nothing special at the\nhorizon. Yes, Hawking would agree with that.\n\nThe problem with it is, it violates a principle of physics. The principle of\nphysics is \u201cnothing ever gets completely lost.\u201d You say, well, that\u2019s crazy.\nIf I take a piece of charcoal and I burn up the charcoal, having maybe written\na message on the charcoal, you\u2019ve lost the message. But that\u2019s not true.\nWhatever you wrote on that piece of charcoal is encoded in the smoke and the\nproducts of combustion.\n\nOn the other hand, Hawking was saying, \u201cWait a minute, that information falls\nthrough the horizon of the black hole. And from everything we know from\ngeneral relativity about the structure of black holes, it simply can\u2019t get\nout.\u201d And so the result was, according to Hawking, that information is\npermanently lost at the horizon of the black hole. Stuff comes out of the\nblack hole. Hawking radiation it\u2019s called. But that Hawking radiation cannot\ncarry any information because that information was from behind the horizon,\nand nothing can get out.\n\nLEVIN: So at this time, Hawking came down squarely in favor of pure general\nrelativity and the absence of quantum mechanics, claiming absolutely nothing\ncan get out? So the information that fell in, even if the black hole\nevaporates, it\u2019s like you\u2019re yanking a curtain up, but the stuff is gone, and\nthere\u2019s nothing you can do about it. And he fell down on the side of\n\u201cinformation was lost.\u201d But you said, \u201cWait, there\u2019s no way.\u201d Why was it so\nimportant to you to say information cannot be lost? What\u2019s so bad about that?\n\nSUSSKIND: Well, the conservation of information is at the root of some of the\nmost far-reaching principles of physics, in particular the principles of\nthermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics, the first law of\nthermodynamics, the conservation of energy, the principles of statistical\nmechanics, the properties of radiation \u2014 all of that is 100% dependent on a\nset of principles that include the zeroth principle of physics, that\ninformation is conserved. It\u2019s called unitarity in quantum mechanics. And what\nit says is that, if there are little differences in what you begin with, those\nlittle differences will remain afterwards. Hawking was saying, what comes out\nof the black hole will be absolutely independent of what fell in.\n\nIf you follow that line of reasoning and ask what it implies, it implies\nchaos. Nothing makes sense anymore. I just felt that couldn\u2019t be right.\n\nLEVIN: So here, you\u2019re at this conflict. But you actually don\u2019t know how to\nresolve the paradox. And so one of the first ideas that you came up with very\nearly on was this concept of complementarity, which is a concept in physics,\nbut you extended it to black holes. Can you tell us about that?\n\nSUSSKIND: It didn\u2019t say anything more or less than, the information comes out\nencoded extremely subtly in the Hawking radiation, much too hard to ever\nreconstruct. In classical physics, it was impossible.\n\nIt became a question of what is called complexity. Complexity is a genuine\nconcept in physics and in mathematics, and it\u2019s just a measure of how hard it\nis to carry out a task. If you ask how hard it is to carry out the task of\nreconstructing what comes out of the black hole, you\u2019ll find out that it is\nexponentially complex. The number of little operations that you would have to\ndo in order to reconstruct what fell into the black hole was so\nextraordinarily high that, for all practical purposes, Stephen was right, the\ninformation was lost. But in quantum mechanics, it just becomes very, very\ncomplex to do it. So, the principle of complementarity was really just saying\nto Stephen, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nLEVIN: How contentious, how heated did this become, this debate?\n\nSUSSKIND: In a personal sense, not at all. Stephen and I were good friends. We\nremained good friends throughout the war, or what I call the Black Hole War.\nThere were times when my wife and I and whoever he was with at the time would\nhave dinner together. He would challenge me. There was never a period in which\nit was at all personal. He was 1,000% certain of what he was saying. Of\ncourse, I was also 1,000% certain of what I was saying.\n\nLEVIN: If you don\u2019t mind me quoting you, I believe it was in The Black Hole\nWar, you said Stephen was also a very arrogant man. And then you said, \u201cSo was\nI.\u201d\n\nSUSSKIND: All physicists who are ambitious and really want to get somewhere in\nthe subject have to have a certain degree of arrogance, for sure. You have to\nbelieve not only that the human brain is smart enough to unravel these\nincredibly sophisticated ideas. You have to believe that your human brain is\nsmart enough to do that, to be able to figure out quantum mechanics, smart\nenough to be able to figure out how the universe works. On the other hand, you\nalso have to be very clear about what you don\u2019t know and what you\u2019re very,\nvery far from. So I suppose in that sense, it takes some humility. Humility to\nknow what you don\u2019t know and what you may never know. Yes, Stephen was\narrogant. Yes, I was arrogant.\n\nLEVIN: So there wasn\u2019t a proof or a calculation yet, and yet you had these\nvery original creative ideas which led to calculations, like holography.\n\nSUSSKIND: Yes. Incidentally, there was another person who was also very, very\nmuch involved. That was Gerard \u2018t Hooft, the Nobel Prize winner, one of the\ngreat physicists of 20th century. The holographic principle, that was the\nthing that \u2018t Hooft and I put forward. It came from Bekenstein\u2019s calculation\nof the entropy of a black hole. Entropy is hidden information, encoded in\nmicroscopic details that you don\u2019t have access to.\n\nBekenstein\u2019s entropy said that the amount of information in a black hole is\nproportional to the area of the horizon. That was radical. Normally, the\namount of information encoded in a structure is proportional to the volume of\nthe structure. That led me and \u2018t Hooft to the idea that what falls into a\nblack hole never really falls in, but is encoded on the surface of the horizon\nin a kind of hologram. A hologram is a two-dimensional image of something\nwhich is really three-dimensional. So, the idea was that what falls into a\nblack hole never really falls in and is encoded on the surface in the form of\na quantum hologram.\n\nThe idea of the holographic principle was more general. Every region of space,\nnot just a horizon of a black hole, is encoded. This room, my room has walls,\nit\u2019s bounded, and the claim of the holographic principle is that everything\ntaking place inside it \u2014 like me, for example, or like the picture behind me \u2014\nall of that is encoded in a holographic description on the boundary of the\nroom, on the walls of the room.\n\nThat seemed crazy to a lot of people. I was sure it was right, but mostly the\ncommunity said, \u201cThose guys have lost their marbles. They used to be good\nphysicists, what is this holographic idea?\u201d\n\nLEVIN: Now, when some of your friends are saying you\u2019re crazy, does that\nbother you? Do you just press ahead?\n\nSUSSKIND: It doesn\u2019t bother me in a personal way. It\u2019s frustrating. Why can\u2019t\nthey see what I see? On the one hand, it tells me that if it\u2019s right, it\u2019s\nworth pursuing, because if everybody thinks it\u2019s wrong and it turns out to be\nright, that\u2019s a big deal.\n\nSo, this idea, it kind of languished for a while. Nothing happened until the\nyoung physicist Juan Maldacena discovered an extremely precise version of the\nholographic principle. It had to do with a kind of space called anti-de Sitter\nspace. It\u2019s, roughly speaking, a solution of Einstein\u2019s equations. And what\nMaldacena discovered is that it was exactly governed by this holographic\nprinciple, that the things inside the room, inside what we call a bulk, were\nexactly described by a quantum field theory on the boundary of the system.\nThat was exactly the holographic principle. So, it was really Maldacena\u2019s\nconstruction and Maldacena\u2019s very precise version of the holographic principle\nthat led to its acceptance.\n\nLEVIN: Just to sort of try to say it in simple terms, it\u2019s kind of a universe\nin a box. And you might talk about a universe in the box as having gravity and\nblack holes and this information loss crisis, but it is exactly equivalent to\nan entire universe described only on the boundary, which not only has fewer\ndimensions, but has no gravity, no black holes, and therefore no information\nloss.\n\nSUSSKIND: It has no gravity, in the theory, on the surface.\n\nLEVIN: On the surface, yes. So, no information loss.\n\nSUSSKIND: Yeah. We talk about the bulk and the boundary. There\u2019s gravity on\nthe bulk, but no gravity on the boundary.\n\nLEVIN: So you have to conclude, if there\u2019s no gravity on the boundary, then\nthere can\u2019t be information loss.\n\nSUSSKIND: Exactly.\n\nLEVIN: The problem goes away. But you still don\u2019t know how exactly to\ncalculate the information coming out. Is that true?\n\nSUSSKIND: Yeah, that\u2019s true. But that\u2019s not terribly surprising. From the\noutside perspective, the black hole is very hot. It\u2019s doing what this piece of\ncharcoal would do. It\u2019s very hot. It\u2019s evaporating. And there\u2019s no chance that\nwe could reconstruct the smoke, or the products of combustion, that we could\nreconstruct what the little bit of writing was on the piece of charcoal.\nInformation gets thermalized. It gets scrambled. So badly scrambled that to\nreconstruct it is complex beyond imagination but in principle possible.\n\nLEVIN: We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n[Break for ad insertion]\n\nLEVIN: Welcome back to \u201cThe Joy of Why.\u201d\n\nSo in principle, if somebody does fall into the black hole, becomes completely\nvaporized, you could reconstruct them outside the black hole.\n\nSUSSKIND: From the Hawking radiation.\n\nLEVIN: From the Hawking radiation.\n\nSUSSKIND: Right. But you could ask, how long would it take? How many quantum\noperations would it take? And the answer is exponentially large in the entropy\nof the black hole. Now the entropy of an ordinary black hole is very large in\nitself, I don\u2019t know, 10^70. So, we\u2019re talking about times to reconstruct it,\nwhich are 10 to the 10^70 years. That\u2019s what quantum mechanics would say. The\nright statement, that Hawking should have made, is not that it\u2019s impossible,\nbut that it\u2019s extraordinarily complex once you fall through the horizon.\n\nLEVIN: If I\u2019m an astronaut jumping in and you\u2019re far away, you see me encoded,\nI never make it into the black hole. All of my quantum information is smeared\non this hologram. What\u2019s my experience?\n\nSUSSKIND: Your experience is just that you fall right through.\n\nLEVIN: I sailed right through. So, these are two conflicting realities.\n\nSUSSKIND: Are they conflicting? That was the question. I was saying no,\nthey\u2019re not really conflicting. The person on the inside who falls in simply\ncannot communicate it to the outside.\n\nLEVIN: Well, you kind of disprove the existence of God.\n\nSUSSKIND: No.\n\nLEVIN: You say there\u2019s no omniscient being. There\u2019s nobody who can\nsimultaneously have the perspective of knowing that there\u2019s \u2014\n\nSUSSKIND: There\u2019s no omniscient being who can see both what\u2019s inside and\nwhat\u2019s outside. Physics is an operational subject that has to do with what can\nbe seen, what can be measured. So as long as you believe there\u2019s no being that\ncan see what\u2019s inside and what\u2019s outside, there\u2019s no conflict.\n\nLEVIN: Right, there\u2019s no conflict.\n\nSUSSKIND: And, from that point on, it became obvious that Hawking was wrong,\nthat all of the information was stored on the boundary of the system and never\nwould be lost.\n\nLEVIN: Amazing.\n\nSUSSKIND: Yeah, it is amazing.\n\nLEVIN: So he capitulates, doesn\u2019t he?\n\nSUSSKIND: He did.\n\nLEVIN: Didn\u2019t he give, famously, John Preskill an encyclopedia of American\nbaseball because he conceded the bet?\n\nSUSSKIND: Apparently, yes.\n\nLEVIN: Why didn\u2019t he give you something?\n\nSUSSKIND: I would have liked the encyclopedia.\n\n[LEVIN laughs]\n\nSUSSKIND: I don\u2019t know. He did give me dinner and wine, but I would have\npreferred the encyclopedia of baseball.\n\nLEVIN: I thought it was kind of him as a Brit to give an American gift.\n\nSUSSKIND: You have to understand, Stephen was both a kind person and an\nextremely witty person. He was funny. The only problem with funny is that he\ncouldn\u2019t express it easily. But, you know, every once in a while, a word would\ncome out of his machine, and everybody would crack up. He was incredibly\nwitty, incredibly kind \u2014 and stubborn!\n\nLEVIN: Who remains unconvinced at this stage? Where are we now?\n\nSUSSKIND: I don\u2019t talk to those people, so I don\u2019t know, you see. Well, at\nleast until recently, the older generation of relativists, but even they sort\nof have given up, I think. Let\u2019s put it this way, I think you judge what\npeople think not by what they say they think, but what they do. How many\npeople are actually working on a theory of information loss? How many young\npeople? There\u2019s a very brilliant young generation of theorists now. None of\nthem. And if they are, they\u2019re ignored.\n\nLEVIN: You\u2019re describing that all of the information that a black hole can\npossibly contain is distributed on the horizon. It doesn\u2019t require the entire\nvolume. So what would happen in any region of space if you tried to pack a lot\nmore information in the volume?\n\nSUSSKIND: You could never pack in more than what would exist on the surface.\nSo if you think the walls of your room, for example, are tiled with little\ntiles, enough to encode everything in the interior of the room, if you try to\ncreate more information in that room, guess what would happen? It would form a\nblack hole which was bigger than the room. So it\u2019s impossible to put more\ninformation in. And so it must be that the room itself is describable\nproportional to the area of the room, not the volume.\n\nLEVIN: That\u2019s astounding. That says that not just these exotic objects, black\nholes, are holograms, but the entire world is a hologram.\n\nSUSSKIND: Exactly. As I said, there was more than one person who thought we\nwere a little bit nuts, but that ended.\n\n[LEVIN laughs]\n\nLEVIN: Why don\u2019t we see black holes evaporate if so much tremendous energy is\ncoming out of black holes?\n\nSUSSKIND: Near this horizon, the only particles that can escape are the ones\nthat are moving radially outward in almost the exact radial direction. So it\u2019s\nas if the black hole was a very hot box, but with a tiny pinhole letting out\nthe radiation. Only this tiny, tiny subset of the photons can get out. So if\nyou ask, how long does it take a single photon to get out of the black hole?\nThe answer, let\u2019s say, for a solar mass black hole, is about 10^-3 seconds.\nBut that\u2019s one photon. How many photons have to get out? 10^70. So it\u2019s a\nvery, very, very slow process, one photon at a time.\n\nAs the black hole shrinks, the process speeds up. The time that it takes a\nsingle photon to get out is proportional to what\u2019s called the transit time\nacross the black hole. That\u2019s the time that a light ray would take to cross\nthe horizon of the black hole. As the black hole shrinks, that time gets\nshorter and shorter. But it\u2019s only at the very, very last minute that it\nspeeds up enough to create what you called an explosion before.\n\nLEVIN: So at the end of the universe, when everything that can has fallen into\nblack holes, they\u2019ll all be exploding. And then what?\n\nSUSSKIND: Well, we don\u2019t have to wait for those black holes to evaporate. As\nfar as we can tell, the universe is described by an exponentially expanding de\nSitter space. This just means that everything is going to fly away from\neverything else. In about a trillion years, the only thing that will be within\nour ability to detect will be our own galaxy. All the other galaxies will\nrecede. Why doesn\u2019t ours recede? Well, because we\u2019re in the middle of it, and\nit doesn\u2019t make any sense to say it recedes. But all the other ones will all\njust disappear out through a cosmic horizon. We\u2019ll be dead alone.\n\nSupposing all of the astronomical information that we have about the world was\nlost. And now we wait this trillion years, a new collection of brilliant\nastronomers and physicists arise. They\u2019re going to look out at the world, and\nthey\u2019re going to say, \u201cWe are truly alone.\u201d Emptiness out beyond their own\ngalaxy. How would they ever reconstruct the true story, that there were all\nthese galaxies which just flew apart, and they\u2019re out there, but we just have\nno access to them. So, if you wait a few trillion years, that\u2019ll be what\nhappens. If you wait orders of magnitude longer than that, everything will\nform black holes and the black holes will evaporate, and there won\u2019t be\nanything. A little scary.\n\nLEVIN: So another question I have is, if I can redescribe a universe with\ngravity as a lower-dimensional universe on the boundary without gravity, does\nthat mean gravity is somehow not real? Is gravity not fundamental?\n\nSUSSKIND: That is a good question. But physicists like to use the word\n\u201cemergent,\u201d that gravity emerges out of some set of rules that are not fully\nunderstood. The quantum mechanical description is the surface of the room with\nno gravity on the surface. What emerges out of the quantum equations is\ngravitation in the bulk. Now, does that mean that gravity is not real? I\nwouldn\u2019t have put it that way.\n\nLEVIN: Reality is overestimated.\n\nSUSSKIND: Well, just do your thing.\n\nLEVIN: Talk about it how you have to talk about it.\n\nSUSSKIND: Talk about it the way you have to talk about it in order to make\nprecise description of it. When I was a young physicist, the attitude was,\n\u201cshut up and calculate.\u201d\n\nI never liked that. I thought you should shut up and understand. But there are\nlimits. We can\u2019t visualize four-dimensional space. I don\u2019t think we can\nvisualize the principles of quantum mechanics. We know how to deal with them.\nWe know how to encode them in mathematics. But we don\u2019t know how to close our\neyes and see the world in a quantum kind of way.\n\nSo I think what people tend to mean by \u201creal\u201d is that which you can visualize\nbecause your species evolved to be able to recognize certain things. Is a\nfour- or a five-dimensional sphere real? No such thing. I close my eyes; all I\ncan see is a three-dimensional sphere. I can visualize it; it must be real.\nBut I think the idea of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real, a physicist has to\ngive that up.\n\nLEVIN: Reality is overrated.\n\nSUSSKIND: No, no, no. Realism is overrated.\n\nLEVIN: Do you think that the key to understanding quantum gravity is here on\nthe terrain of black holes?\n\nSUSSKIND: Yes, I think it\u2019s in the domain of horizons. There are other kinds\nof horizons besides black hole horizons. If there\u2019s a black hole, let\u2019s say\nover here, then we surround the black hole, the cosmic horizon surrounds us.\nSo it\u2019s a kind of inside-out horizon surrounding us. When things move outward,\naway from us, because of the expansion of the universe, they eventually fall\nthrough this cosmic horizon, or they eventually approach it, and they\ndisappear out of what we can see. So there are still puzzles about these\ninside-out de Sitter horizons that I think we\u2019re not necessarily near solving\nyet, which is exciting. I would say the worst thing for somebody like myself\nwould be if all of the problems were solved.\n\nLEVIN: Yes.\n\nSUSSKIND: What do you do then?\n\nLEVIN: It would be very boring.\n\nSUSSKIND: It would be very boring. I used to like to go fishing, used to like\nto go fly fishing.\n\nLEVIN: We\u2019ll hang that up on your office door, \u201cgone fishing.\u201d\n\n[Theme plays]\n\nLEVIN: We\u2019ve been speaking with renowned theoretical physicist Lenny Susskind.\nLenny, so lovely of you to join us. I will come to Stanford next time.\n\nSUSSKIND: Oh, excellent. Excellent. Very good.\n\nLEVIN: Great to talk to you. Such a pleasure.\n\nSUSSKIND: It was very nice to talk to you, Janna.\n\nLEVIN: It\u2019s been too long.\n\nSUSSKIND: Been too long.\n\n[Theme plays]\n\nLEVIN: \u201cThe Joy of Why\u201d is a podcast from Quanta Magazine, an editorially\nindependent publication supported by the Simons Foundation.
