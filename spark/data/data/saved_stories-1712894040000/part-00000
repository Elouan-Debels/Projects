Since then, more than 200 million papers have been reviewed by the\ndetector, predominantly written by high school and college students. Turnitin\nfound that 11 percent may contain AI-written language in 20 percent of its\ncontent, with 3 percent of the total papers reviewed getting flagged for\nhaving 80 percent or more AI writing. (Turnitin is owned by Advance, which\nalso owns Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of WIRED.) Turnitin says its detector has a\nfalse positive rate of less than 1 percent when analyzing full documents.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s launch was met with knee-jerk fears that the English class essay\nwould die. The chatbot can synthesize information and distill it near-\ninstantly\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean it always gets it right. Generative AI has\nbeen known to hallucinate, creating its own facts and citing academic\nreferences that don\u2019t actually exist. Generative AI chatbots have also been\ncaught spitting out biased text on gender and race. Despite those flaws,\nstudents have used chatbots for research, organizing ideas, and as a\nghostwriter. Traces of chatbots have even been found in peer-reviewed,\npublished academic writing.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nTeachers understandably want to hold students accountable for using generative\nAI without permission or disclosure. But that requires a reliable way to prove\nAI was used in a given assignment. Instructors have tried at times to find\ntheir own solutions to detecting AI in writing, using messy, untested methods\nto enforce rules, and distressing students. Further complicating the issue,\nsome teachers are even using generative AI in their grading processes.\n\nDetecting the use of gen AI is tricky. It\u2019s not as easy as flagging\nplagiarism, because generated text is still original text. Plus, there\u2019s\nnuance to how students use gen AI; some may ask chatbots to write their papers\nfor them in large chunks or in full, while others may use the tools as an aid\nor a brainstorm partner.\n\nStudents also aren't tempted by only ChatGPT and similar large language\nmodels. So-called word spinners are another type of AI software that rewrites\ntext, and may make it less obvious to a teacher that work was plagiarized or\ngenerated by AI. Turnitin\u2019s AI detector has also been updated to detect word\nspinners, says Annie Chechitelli, the company\u2019s chief product officer. It can\nalso flag work that was rewritten by services like spell checker Grammarly,\nwhich now has its own generative AI tool. As familiar software increasingly\nadds generative AI components, what students can and can\u2019t use becomes more\nmuddled.\n\nDetection tools themselves have a risk of bias. English language learners may\nbe more likely to set them off; a 2023 study found a 61.3 percent false\npositive rate when evaluating Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)\nexams with seven different AI detectors. The study did not examine Turnitin\u2019s\nversion. The company says it has trained its detector on writing from English\nlanguage learners as well as native English speakers. A study published in\nOctober found that Turnitin was among the most accurate of 16 AI language\ndetectors in a test that had the tool examine undergraduate papers and AI-\ngenerated papers.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\n\nJason Kehe\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Chechitelli says a\nmajority of the service\u2019s clients have opted to purchase the AI detection. But\nthe risks of false positives and bias against English learners have led some\nuniversities to ditch the tools for now. Montclair State University in New\nJersey announced in November that it would pause use of Turnitin\u2019s AI\ndetector. Vanderbilt University and Northwestern University did the same last\nsummer.\n\n\u201cThis is hard. I understand why people want a tool,\u201d says Emily Isaacs,\nexecutive director of the Office of Faculty Excellence at Montclair State. But\nIsaacs says the university is concerned about potentially biased results from\nAI detectors, as well as the fact that the tools can\u2019t provide confirmation\nthe way they can with plagiarism. Plus, Montclair State doesn\u2019t want to put a\nblanket ban on AI, which will have some place in academia. With time and more\ntrust in the tools, the policies could change. \u201cIt\u2019s not a forever decision,\nit\u2019s a now decision,\u201d Isaacs says.\n\nChechitelli says the Turnitin tool shouldn\u2019t be the only consideration in\npassing or failing a student. Instead, it\u2019s a chance for teachers to start\nconversations with students that touch on all of the nuance in using\ngenerative AI. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really know where that line should be,\u201d she says.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
