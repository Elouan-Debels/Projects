They wanted me to upload a new copy of my passport, because the old\none I used to register my account is about to expire. This puzzles me. And the\nway they asked is downright dangerous.\n\nFirst of all: I have other bank accounts that never asked me to do this. Why\nis this even necessary? They know who I am and have verified my identity\nalready, based on my soon to expire passport. Are they even allowed to ask for\nthis again? Or is there some arcane rule somewhere in Europe that requires\nthem to do so? If anybody knows more, I\u2019d love to hear about it in the\ncomments.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, the email they use to ask this is the perfect phishing email. It\ncontains a link that I should click to upload a scan of my new passport. The\nlink points to a domain that is not raisin.nl or similar. Now this email may\nbe legit (it probably is), but such emails train Raisin customers to click\nlinks in emails from Raisin. (And, by extension, to not be suspicious of links\nin emails from other financial institutions.) If criminals realise Raisin does\nthis, they can also send such emails (that are phishing emails) and Raisin\ncustomers would not be able to tell the difference. With severe consequences.\n\nMoreover, the email seriously suggests that I can also send a scan of my\npassport by email to their customer service department. WTF? Seriously? Email\nis notoriously insecure. Customer service departments are notoriously\ninsecure. And if anybody gets hold of a scan of my passport, I run a serious\nrisk of identity theft. They also (conveniently) forget to tell me how I\nshould make a more-or-less secure scan of my passport to prevent identity\ntheft, by hiding certain fields and adding a watermark.\n\nRaisin, please stop abetting identity theft.\n\nIn case you spot any errors on this page, please notify me!\n\nOr, leave a comment.\n\n\u201cEllen Timmer (ellentimmer.com)\u201d\n\n, 2024-04-04\n\n(reply)\n\nBeste Jaap-Henk,\n\nMooi stuk, dank.
