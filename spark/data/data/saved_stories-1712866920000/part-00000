You\u2019d be surprised\n\nDale Berning Sawa\n\nVisitors to the countryside objecting to a variety of rural noises are such a\nproblem that legislators feel compelled to act\n\nShare\n\nThe French parliament is taking aim at noise complaints in the countryside.\nLawmakers say they are well acquainted with the problem of residents who have\nmoved to the countryside from the big cities bemoaning the way livestock,\nchurch bells and other rural sounds impinge on their newly claimed right to\npastoral quiet.\n\nA new law aims to stop these n\u00e9oruraux (rural newcomers) from taking farmers\nto court over farming activities that were already happening long before they\narrived. Opposition MPs have derided the new bill as hot air, because it\nmostly just reorganises existing bits of legislation. But what is new is an\nemphasis on what the justice minister, \u00c9ric Dupond-Moretti, calls le vivre-\nensemble: living together in a respectful way \u2013 something I feel is sorely\nneeded.\n\nI grew up in Aix-en-Provence, a town that likes to think of itself as an\nextension of Paris. In 2016, Parisian tourists holidaying in nearby Carry-le-\nRouet garnered national attention when they complained about the chant des\ncigales (cicadas) in summer. In my mind, it\u2019s easy to trace a link between\ngentrification-inflated property prices in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur\nregion and these nonsense complaints, which this new legislation aims to curb.\n\nAix is not where I come back to during school holidays now. For the better\npart of the past decade, my parents have lived in a tiny village on the edge\nof the C\u00e9vennes national park. The truly rural sounds here reflect the hard\nlives being lived.\n\nIt\u2019s where I am right now. It\u2019s just gone 4pm; the Catholic church\u2019s bells\nhave just rung eight times. Despite there being as few as 300 year-round\ninhabitants, the bells ring the hour twice, just metres from our beds \u2013 even\nthrough the hours of complete darkness when the street lights are switched\noff. They ring once on the half-hour too. A full-on fanfare, meanwhile, marks\nthe day\u2019s main services at 8am, midday and 7pm. It takes visiting friends a\nfew nights to get used to it.\n\nYesterday, during lunch, we heard the tinkling sounds of a different type of\nbell and everyone \u2013 kids, parents, grandparents \u2013 jumped up and ran outside to\nwatch the herd of sheep and barking patou sheepdogs trot down the road and\nacross the bridge to the other side of the village, headed for pastures\ndownstream. Often they walk down my parents\u2019 actual street. They poop\neverywhere and eat my mother\u2019s pansies.\n\nMy parents\u2019 neighbours talk to each other from their respective upstairs\nwindows, across the expanse of the street. There\u2019s no need to leave home for a\nchat. They can hear each other just fine.\n\nThe butcher\u2019s opens up on to the alley behind the house, which means we hear\nevery word when he\u2019s in a raging mood. Empathising with whatever existential\ndespair might be built into the profession, though, isn\u2019t that hard when you\nthink about the fact that his is one of the few upright businesses in a\ndiminutive local economy. Making a living in an emptying countryside is no\njoke.\n\nThe storms rage, too; the wind howls; the rivers swell and rush and burst\ntheir banks and flood the cellars. Night-time is full of bats and frogs.\nDuring termtime the sound of children playing ebbs and flows as the village\nschool fills up for lessons, empties for lunch and then fills again until\nhometime. At weekends, passing bikers rev through on their way up the\nmountain.\n\nThe summer holidays are marked by seemingly interminable f\u00eates du village,\nwhich always start out low-key, with Nutella cr\u00eapes, churros from a circus van\nand a live brass band. By the early hours, they have transformed into a\nbooming knees-up that can be heard throughout the village, the beat bouncing\noff walls built long before even running water was a thing. But they always\nend, and you do sleep eventually, and the house stands unmoved. Its walls are\nbuilt a metre thick, of stones from the river. Not even floods can shake them\nloose.\n\nSummer nights can sometimes be punctuated by drunken parties of weekending\nteenagers, the only noise I know of that has elicited an official police\ncomplaint. The hostel-hotel across the street hosts the occasionally raucous\ntwo-night birthday party. There\u2019ll be neighbourly mumbling about noise past\n10pm or parking on private land. But mostly people speak to each other and\nsort it out. They really do live, respectfully, together.\n\nOnce, on an early-morning walk up her favourite road out of the village, my\nmother found a lady leaning on the gate at the end of her garden. \u201cWe come\nhere for peace and quiet,\u201d she said, \u201cand here he is.\u201d She gestured across the\nriver to a man chopping wood with a machine: a kerclunk-kerclunk-thud,\nkerclunk-kerclunk-thud ping-ponging between the stony wooded walls of the\nnarrow valley.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s freezing cold here in the winter. Even in the\nsummer, those thick stone walls act like fridges, and no amount of government\ngreen incentives can make heating these ancient houses affordable. Gardening,\nforaging for chestnuts and c\u00e8pes, hunting in hi-vis, tractors hauling hay and\nsweets onions: this is making ends meet, and it\u2019s a struggle. Farmers across\nthe country have been upturning village signs \u2013 ours included \u2013 in protest at\nagroindustrial policies they say are crushing them.\n\nI know living somewhere and visiting are two different things. But I have\nlived here and loved every aural moment of it, even when I didn\u2019t. This is\ncountryside clamour that is restorative simply because it\u2019s still alive \u2013 and\nthat\u2019s what matters.\n\n  * Dale Berning Sawa is a freelance writer based in London\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * France\n  * Opinion\n  * Farming\n  * Farm animals\n  * Europe\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
