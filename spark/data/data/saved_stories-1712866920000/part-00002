Of\nall our tech luminaries over the last 50 years, he is the one I relate to the\nmost. His sense of product, his love of the humanities, his obsession with\nquality\u2014it\u2019s all part of an ethos by which I\u2019ve tried to conduct my own life.\n\nWhat makes me sick about Jobs is that he was also objectively cruel. Time and\ntime again, he demonstrated a capacity for brutal coldness that is hard to\nstomach. He abandoned his daughter and casually discarded the people he once\nregarded as friends. It is hard to reconcile the extremes of his life.\n\nJobs isn\u2019t the only complicated billionaire. In my studies of famous tech\nfounders, I have found people who did great things at terrible costs. This\ndisparity gave me an urgent need to find someone who had obviously led an\nexemplary life by the standards I think are important: marriage, children,\nmoral quality, and career. So I did what every fool and drunkard has done\nbefore me: I tweeted a loaded question.\n\nEvan Armstrong \ud83d\udce7@itsurboyevan\n\nI've been looking for an example of this for a year and I'm pretty sure they\ndon't exist:\n\n\\- Worth 1B+ - Married to original spouse - Outstanding moral virtue - Kids\nare all relatively successful - Kids have a good relationship with parents\n\nAny idea? cc @FoundersPodcast\n\nApril 2nd 2024, 8:51am EST\n\n67 Retweets1k Likes\n\nSource: X/Evan Armstrong.\n\nDear reader: Many, many people had ideas.\n\nI got hundreds of DMs. The thread drove 1.5 million impressions. I was called\na capitalist pig and a communist bastard. And, perhaps surprisingly for\ninternet discourse, I got lots of useful feedback.\n\nMany folks were eager to share the stories of billionaires who struck them as\ngood people. I\u2019ve spent the last week going through these names, fact-checking\nsources, and trying to build a final list.\n\nAlong the way, I struggled with deciding on a metric that would help me define\nmorality. People get divorced for good reasons, have ungrateful kids, or face\nother unforeseen difficulties in life. Maybe Jobs was just afflicted with bad\npersonal relationships, and maybe he\u2019s forgivable. But as the wealthiest\npeople in our society, billionaires, more than anyone else, have the power\nthat comes with access to tremendous amounts of capital. The unreasonably\npowerful should be held to unreasonably high moral standards, too.\n\nWhile my initial goal was to find people who obviously cleared the bar on all\nfive metrics, I became more flexible during my research, as it was almost\nimpossible to accurately analyze and judge each billionaire. The good news is\nthere is at least one person who I think deserves this title. The rest,\ndepending on the gradients of your moral compass, might get filtered out.\n\n## Marc Andreessen is the startup savior and liberal boogeyman (the purity\nproblem)\n\nOne of the more surprisingly frequent names raised was Marc Andreessen, with\n13 mentions. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, the always-controversial venture capitalist\nis notorious for his political activism, scathing opinions, and absolute\ncommitment to doing what he thinks is right. For those who voted in favor of\ntech\u2019s favorite egghead, a remarkable number had a financial incentive to keep\nhim happy. They were co-investors or founders who had received capital from\nhis firm\u2014that sort of thing.\n\nTo be fair, I can see their argument! Andreessen is a billionaire, married to\nhis original spouse, and has young kids who I\u2019m sure are delightful. Depending\non which philosophy you, as a reader, ascribe to, you might take issue with\nhis politics. But it feels presumptuous to say that people with different\npolitical opinions than me aren\u2019t moral people. That was what these sources\nargued to me in their DMs: His financial commitment to the path laid out by\nhis philosophy\u2014even if some people find his ideas distasteful\u2014is the mark of a\nmoral man.\n\nThis holds true for all of these billionaires. Either in the way they made\ntheir wealth or that they chose to deploy it, morality is relative, which\nmakes universal agreement on a person as good nearly impossible. Most people\nargue that the only moral use of a billionaire\u2019s wealth is if they give it\naway. While I may tend to agree, this feels a little prescriptive for my\ntaste. (Forbes compiles an excellent database where you can track\nbillionaires\u2019 charity work.)\n\nSo, while there were many people who would\u2019ve qualified if I were the sole\nmoral arbiter, there are questions as to whether they are universally\napproved. The more political someone was, the more complicated their career\u2019s\nlegacy, the less likely they are to be spotless. Take, for example, the\nKushner brothers: one (Josh) a liberal technology investor who pours money\ninto startups and has a sterling reputation in the tech community; the other\n(Jared) a real estate investor mostly remembered for his time in the Trump\nadministration. Which one is the good billionaire? Whose political philosophy\nis moral?\n\n## I know them and they suck (the PR problem)\n\nAccording to Forbes, there are 2,781 billionaires in the world. How many of\nthem can you name? Ask yourself why you know about them. The reality is that\nreputation is a purchasable good. Billionaires can hire PR agencies and the\nbest ghost writers on the planet. If you know of a billionaire (outside of\ntheir committing criminal acts), it is safe to assume that they want you to\nknow about them.\n\nIf a billionaire has a spotless public perception, it is likely artificially\nconstructed. For example, a remarkable 18 people named one billionaire in\nparticular as a paragon of virtue. This individual had a Brady Bunch-esque\nfamily\u2014perfection in every way. The only problem? I\u2019ve hung out with his kids\nand know that there are major issues within the family. The parental/filial\nrelationship is challenging; the relationships between siblings are brutal\ncontests for their parents\u2019 favor. The only reason I know this is because I\nhappen to travel in the same social circles, which isn\u2019t true for all the\nother billionaires. I have to imagine that at least some of them have secret\nfamily discord.\n\nI\u2019ve been reading an early copy of Anupreeta Das\u2019s Billionaire, Nerd, Savior,\nKing: Bill Gates and His Quest to Shape Our World, which is due out in August.\nIf you had to pick someone who qualified for this list six years ago, Gates\nwould\u2019ve been at the top. He was a supposedly devoted husband and father who\ngave his billions to charity. Then, the Jeffrey Epstein situation rightfully\nthrew everything we knew about Gates into question. The book, which is quite\ngood, delves deeply into that relationship. How many other people on this list\nhave Epstein-level secrets that never see the light of day?\n\nIn a fun inversion, I\u2019d never heard of most of the names that qualified for my\nlist. They are private individuals with short Wikipedia pages. Their presence\nwas mostly scrubbed from the internet, and my sources\u2014often family friends who\nhad grown up with them\u2014asked me not to share what I learned. So I mostly had\nto trust the words of individuals that some of the people on my list\nqualified. There are no articles, books, or essays on many of our billionaires\ntoday\u2014the reverse PR problem.\n\nRemember: People are complicated, families even more so, and when you mix in\nmore money than God, it is nearly impossible to ascertain the absolute truth.\nThe task, then, becomes acknowledging that these stories we know about\nbillionaires are exactly that\u2014stories to learn from, not a science to dissect.\n\n## Rise up, comrades (the existence problem)\n\nA few people recommended the names of several Indian billionaires with\ncomments such as \u201cwe do it right in India,\u201d \u201cwe aren\u2019t corrupted by the West,\u201d\n\u201cshame on American family values,\u201d etc. Mukesh Ambani (estimated $113 billion\nnet worth) was one such name.\n\nAmbani, in particular, had me returning to an argument that was popular among\nresponders with raised fists in their profile pictures to my tweet: \u201cThere is\nno such thing as a moral billionaire.\u201d Aside from Ambani\u2019s business\ncontributions in running the multinational conglomerate Reliance, I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but think about his home, the Antila\u2014the world\u2019s most expensive single-\nfamily residence, which is estimated to have cost over $1 billion. It spans\nover 27 floors and has a room that makes its own snow, a staff of 600, a\ngarage with 168 luxury vehicles, and a list of obscene amenities that could\nfill out the remaining length of this essay. It is also only a few miles away\nfrom heartbreakingly poor families. At the time of its construction in 2010,\nan estimated 62 percent of Mumbai\u2019s population lived in slums. I couldn\u2019t\nreconcile that with Ambani\u2019s philanthropy work and the integral services his\nbusinesses have created (including mind-bogglingly cheap internet data). But,\nfor many responders, his opulence didn\u2019t matter.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I believe the sentiment about the impossibility of a moral\nbillionaire, and the cultural differences between an American and an Indian\nbillionaire are vast. But these questions are the conundrum at the heart of\nthis exercise. Does the very existence of these individuals preclude them from\nmoral authority? Or is it in the way they show and use their wealth? Is the\nonly way to justify being a billionaire using the wealth in quiet ways?\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to have the answers to these questions\u2014they are likely a\nmatter of personal religion as much as anything. But, again, the complication\nis what I am trying to avoid.\n\n## Jesus in a Gulfstream\n\nThe origin of this exercise was personal, existential anguish. I may be naive,\nbut I want something higher and better, a one-two combo of capitalist might\nand moral virtue. While this tweet thread was the first public manifestation,\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this for years. Thankfully, finally, I found one, an\nunadulterated, unquestionable moral paragon: Chuck Feeney.\n\nThe co-founder of the Duty Free Shoppers Group gave away his $8 billion\nfortune, living out his final years in a one-bedroom rental in San Francisco.\nHe flew coach until he was 75, only upgrading with miles once he needed more\nspace for his old knees. His deeds span from helping facilitate peace talks\nbetween the IRA and England to funding new buildings at Stanford. Even then,\nhe still wouldn\u2019t technically clear my metrics! He and his first wife got\ndivorced after differences over lifestyle\u2014he just wanted to give his money\naway. She kept $100 million and several luxury homes. Divorce due to a desire\nto be philanthropic is a get-out-of-jail-free card. His life has been\nsufficiently documented by biographers, journalists, and colleagues that I\nfeel he is most likely cleared of the PR problem. He also has the benefit of\nbeing dead, so he has run out of time to bring it all crashing down on\nhimself. A real win-lose situation.\n\nChuck Feeney lived in such a way that I don\u2019t think anyone could reasonably\nsay he doesn\u2019t scratch that itch for what I was looking for. Mission\naccomplished!\n\nIn addition to Feeney, I made a list of 84 billionaires who I would classify\nas \u201crelatively moral\u201d: They obviously cleared all the metrics except for the\nmoral virtue one. Typically, they were so politically active, in one way or\nanother, that a significant portion of the population would deem them \u201cbad.\u201d\nWhile I initially hoped to publish the list, it felt irresponsible to give out\na large group of names, some of whom are very private individuals, for public\nexamination. I was stunned at how many I had never heard of, quietly donating\nhundreds of millions of dollars to important causes, doing their best to care\nfor others. While I often disagreed with how they made their money or what\ncauses they were funding, it was inspiring that people would so strongly\ndouble down on what they believe.\n\nIn the end, this quest for a moral billionaire forced me to confront my own\nbeliefs about wealth, power, and the nature of goodness in a complex world. I\nfinished the exercise with hope\u2014not because I found a simple answer to the\nquestion of what it means to be both wealthy and virtuous, but because I have\ndiscovered that even among the most powerful, there are those who strive to\nmake a positive difference. While money corrupts, it does not corrupt\nabsolutely. Even within a system that often rewards greed and self-interest,\nthere is room for those who choose to prioritize the greater good. And that,\nin itself, is a reason for hope.\n\nEvan Armstrong is the lead writer for Every, where he writes the Napkin Math\ncolumn.
