The XM7 and XM250 are\nsuccessors to the M4 rifle and M249 light machine gun that American forces\nhave used for decades. (Sebastian Saarloos/U.S. Army).\n\nSHARE\n\nSoldiers with the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, Kentucky are the first to\nreceive the Army\u2019s new Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) system this week.\n\nOn Thursday, soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment were\nequipped with the NGSW ahead of April training where they will practice with\nnew equipment, according to Army Futures Command. The training will involve a\ntrain-the-trainer course to prepare NCOs to conduct follow-on training across\nthe company.\n\nThe Army also plans to field NGSW systems to a National Guard armored brigade\nin May.\n\nThe two NGSW rifles, which increase lethality at longer ranges, will be used\nby close combat forces which have historically sustained \u201c80% of the\ncasualties in combat,\u201d according to Brig. Gen. Larry Burris, commander of the\nArmy Infantry School and Army Maneuver Center of Excellence in a brief to\nreporters in 2022. Other forces will continue to use the M4 and the M249\nweapons systems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the company supply sergeant will continue to carry [an] M-4 or\nanother weapon, not the Next-Gen Weapon,\u201d Burris said.\n\nThe XM7 will be the new personal weapon for soldiers across the Army and\nreplace the ubiquitous M4 rifle, which has designs originating from M16s used\nby Vietnam War soldiers. The XM250 will replace the M249 Squad Automatic\nWeapon, a 1980s-era gun.\n\nThe XM7 weighs around 8.4 pounds, which is slightly heavier than the M4,\nweighing about 7.3 pounds. The XM250 is about 12 pounds, significantly lighter\nthan the SAW, which weighs approximately 18 pounds.\n\nWhen it comes to firing, the XM7 and XM250 rifles are designed to use a larger\nand heavier bullet size \u201cwith improved armor-penetrating capabilities,\u201d\naccording to Fort Campbell\u2019s public affairs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fewer rounds required for the soldier to carry,\u201d Lt. Col. Micah Rue,\nproduct manager for soldier weapons at the Army\u2019s Program Executive Soldier\noffice, told Task & Purpose. \u201cThey don\u2019t need as many as they needed in the\npast to neutralize the target. But if you look at the round itself, it\u2019s\nactually a more substantial round.\u201d\n\nThe new weapons will use 6.8mm ammunition while previous weapons used 5.56mm\nammunition.\n\n## First new weapon \u2018in 65 years\u2018\n\nOfficials began the NGSW development process after a 2017 study \u201crecognized\nthe need for weapons that will perform better at range,\u201d according to AFC.\n\nThe Army has used over 25,000 hours to develop and test the NGSW system with\nsoldiers, including those from the Kentucky base who were the first\noperational users of the XM7 rifle and the XM250 in September.\n\nThe Army also did natural environment testing in extreme cold and hot,\ntropical environments after studies in a closed, simulated environment where\nresearchers take the weapon, put it in a freezer, let it soak overnight, and\nthen shoot it for testing, Rue said.\n\nWith the help of several Army offices and private companies like Sig Sauer and\nVortex, the Army was able to \u201cdeliver on schedule as promised,\u201d despite\n\u201cchallenges, setbacks, and speed bumps,\u201d Lt. Col. Mark Vidotto, lead of the\nNGSW for the Soldier Lethality Cross-Functional Team at Fort Moore, Georgia,\nsaid in a press release.\n\n> Subscribe to Task & Purpose today.

Gen. William Boruff, told reporters that fielding the weapons\nto certain units would be based on ammunition availability. The production of\nnew ammo, he said, requires the Army to start a new industrial base \u2013 an issue\nthe entire Department of Defense has struggled with while supplying Ukraine\nwith enough munitions and maintaining its own stockpiles simultaneously. A\ncombination of increased demand for munitions and older, dried-up production\nlines has led the DOD to establish new facilities and billion-dollar, multi-\nyear contracts with defense contractors.\n\nThe Army set up a plan to produce the new ammunition at a contractor-operated\nLake City Army Ammunition Plant in Missouri. After seven to eight years, the\nArmy plans to take the production lead with Sig Sauer as a second source.\n\n\u201cThe NGSW fielding is a culmination of a comprehensive and rigorous process of\ndesign, testing and feedback, all of which were led by Soldiers,\u201d said Col.\nJason Bohannon, project manager at PEO Soldier. \u201cAs a result, the Army is\ndelivering on its promise to deliver to Soldiers the highest quality, most\ncapable small-caliber weapons and ammunition.\u201d\n\n## The latest on Task & Purpose\n\n  * Air Force fires two medical commanders at Joint Base Charleston\n  * Navy fires commodore of Naval Special Warfare Group Eight\n  * Families at Edwards Air Force Base living in RVs for housing relief\n  * Niger cuts ties with US military\n  * Navy has fired at least 3 commanding officers for DUIs in 2024\n\nPatty Nieberg\n\nPatty is a senior staff writer for Task & Purpose.
