Prager, MD, a professor in\nthe Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Washington\nSchool of Medicine, told Healthline.\n\nFollowing the Dobbs ruling, researchers observed an abrupt increase of 58\nsterilization procedures for women, averaging around 5.31 procedures per month\nper 100,000 individuals. This marks an almost twofold increase from the prior\nrate of 2.84 procedures per month for women.\n\n\u201cFindings from this research highlight the indirect effects of Dobbs on the\nreproductive autonomy of young people,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Jackie\nEllison, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University\nof Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n\nWhile men experienced an overall increase of 27 procedures, there wasn\u2019t a\nsignificant rise in monthly procedures.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nReproductive Rights\n\n## Birth Rates Increased in First Six Months of 2023 Because of Abortions Bans\n\nForty-three states currently restrict abortion after a certain point in\npregnancy, and 14 states ban the procedure.\n\nBy\n\n    Zane McNeill ,\n    Truthout\n\nJanuary 4, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\n\u201cChoosing permanent contraception at a young age reflects lack of confidence\nin avoiding carrying an unintended pregnancy to term, and policy changes like\nDobbs restrict options for all pregnancy-capable people, likely increasing a\nsense of urgency around eliminating possibilities of unwanted pregnancies,\u201d\nPrager told Healthline.\n\nDespite tubal ligations being up to six times more costly than vasectomies, as\nwell as being more invasive and challenging to reverse, the increase in\nprocedures among female patients was twice as high as that among male\npatients.\n\n\u201cThe major difference in patterns of these two procedures likely reflects the\nfact that young women are overwhelmingly responsible for preventing pregnancy\nand disproportionately experience the health, social, and economic\nconsequences of abortion bans,\u201d Ellison said in a news release.\n\nDuring the first six months of 2023, a different study released by the IZA\nInstitute of Labor Economics revealed that states with abortion restrictions\nexperienced a rise in childbirth rates compared to states where abortion\nremains legal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people have access to their preferred methods of\ncontraception and that these preferences aren\u2019t constrained by a climate of\nreduced support for people\u2019s overall reproductive freedom,\u201d Megan Kavanaugh,\nprincipal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement\nshared with Healthline.\n\nIn addition to 43 states having restricted abortion after a certain point in\npregnancy and 14 states outright banning the procedure, women of reproductive\nage have also reported increased difficulties and/or delays in accessing their\npreferred contraception after Dobbs.\n\n\u201cWe do have evidence at the population level in select states that people are\nexperiencing increased barriers to accessing their preferred contraceptive\nmethods since Dobbs, so we need to continue to monitor how these access\nbarriers might be impacting people\u2019s ability to actually obtain their\npreferred methods,\u201d Kavanaugh told Healthline.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
