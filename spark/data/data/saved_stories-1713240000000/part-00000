Mike Turner (R-Ohio) speak following a briefing on February 15,\n2024.\n\n(Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\n# Spying Expansion Could Hand 'Stasi-Like Powers' to Trump, Privacy Advocates\nWarn\n\n##\n\n\"In my opinion no country that has something like this to enter into force can\nstill be considered to be free,\" said Edward Snowden.\n\nJake Johnson\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\n10\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nNSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is among the privacy advocates sounding the\nalarm over a major expansion of mass surveillance that the U.S. House approved\nin a bipartisan vote last week, a step toward handing the federal\ngovernment\u2014and a potential second Trump administration\u2014even more power to spy\non Americans' communications without a warrant.\n\nSean Vitka, policy director of Demand Progress, used social media to press the\ntop Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI)\non the implications of an amendment that the lower chamber approved as part of\na bill to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n(FISA).\n\n\"Did you know your FISA [electronic communications service provider] amendment\nfacilitates Stasi-like powers, very plausibly for [former President Donald]\nTrump? I asked your staff if you were lied to about it or if you knew. Can you\nconfirm?\" Vitka asked Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) on X, the platform formerly\nknown as Twitter. (Trump, the presumptive 2024 GOP nominee, has postured as a\nFISA opponent, but as president he signed an extension of Section 702\nauthority.)\n\nVitka noted Sunday that Himes repeatedly characterized the amendment\u2014which was\nled by HPSCI Chair Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio)\u2014as narrow, even though it would\ndramatically expand the kinds of businesses that can be forced to help the\ngovernment conduct surveillance operations under Section 702, possibly handing\na would-be authoritarian chilling surveillance powers.\n\nAs the Brennan Center for Justice explained, \"Although the amendment exempts\nhotels, libraries, restaurants, and a handful of other types of\nestablishments, an enormous range of businesses could still be conscripted\ninto service, including grocery stores, department stores, hardware stores,\nlaundromats, barber shops, fitness centers, and countless other locations\nAmericans frequent\u2014even the offices in which they work.\"\n\n\"Moreover, although the targets would still have to be non-U.S. persons\noverseas, many of these businesses would lack the technical ability to turn\nover specific communications, so they would be forced to give the NSA access\nto entire communications streams\u2014trusting the government to retain only the\ncommunications of approved targets,\" the group added.\n\nSection 702 permits U.S. agencies to spy on non-citizens located outside of\nthe country, but the communications of Americans\u2014including activists,\njournalists, and lawmakers\u2014have frequently been swept up under the\nsurveillance authority, sparking a bipartisan reform push.\n\nHimes, an opponent of reform efforts, responded dismissively to Vitka's\nquestion on Sunday, writing that \"life is really too short to engage with\npeople who need to use bombastic absurdities like 'Stasi-like.'\"\n\n\"Yes I know exactly what is in there,\" Himes added, referring to the Turner-\nled amendment. \"Some of it is classified. And none of it is remotely 'Stasi-\nlike.' Sell your nonsense elsewhere.\"\n\nSnowden, who in 2013 exposed the NSA's illegal mass surveillance program, said\nin response that \"the 'it's classified' dodge\" by Himes \"is a bright red\nflag.\"\n\n\"This amendment radically\u2014and I repeat radically\u2014expands the range of who the\ngov't can force to spy on their behalf. It may be law in DAYS!\" Snowden wrote\non social media.\n\nSnowden went on to argue that Vitka's \"invocation of 'Stasi-like' is not only\na fair characterization\" of the amendment, \"it's probably generous.\"\n\n\"Frankly, it's hard to imagine any modern communication beyond the reach of\nthis thing\u2014which is, of course, the true reason they're trying to sneak it\ninto law so quietly,\" he added. \"It is unbelievably overbroad, and in my\nopinion no country that has something like this to enter into force can still\nbe considered to be free.\"\n\n\"The House bill represents one of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions\nof government surveillance authority in history.\"\n\nElizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National\nSecurity Program, said the \"disregard for Americans' civil liberties\" in\nHimes' reply to Vitka \"is staggering.\"\n\n\"This provision allows the NSA to force a huge range of ordinary U.S.\nbusinesses to assist the NSA in Section 702 surveillance,\" Goitein added.\n\"That's not 'nonsense,' that's a fact.
