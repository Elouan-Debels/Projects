This is nearly a\nreversal of the figures last measured in 2013, when 56% of Americans got the\nsleep they needed and 43% did not.\n\nAmericans\u2019 perception that they aren\u2019t getting enough sleep is borne out by\nthe diminished number of hours of sleep they report getting per night.\n\nThese differences in average sleep reflect substantial changes over time in\nthe percentage of U.S. adults sleeping eight or more versus five hours or less\nper night. In 1942, 59% were getting eight-plus hours of sleep, while only 3%\nreported getting five hours or less. By 1990, the percentage reporting eight\nor more hours had fallen to 27%, while the proportion getting five or less was\nup to 14%. Today, a quarter are still getting eight-plus hours, but the\npercentage getting five or less has risen to 20%.\n\nThe latest results are from a Dec. 1-20, 2023, Gallup poll.\n\n### Young Women Least Likely to Get Enough Sleep\n\nWomen have been consistently less likely than men to report getting enough\nsleep. The latest poll finds 36% of women versus 48% of men saying they get\nthe sleep they need. Both figures represent significant declines from previous\nreadings in 2013 and 2004 and are the lowest Gallup has measured for each\ngroup to date.\n\nGenerally, adults 65 and older are more likely than those who are younger to\nget the sleep they need. This holds true across the trend. That said, the\ndecline this year in getting as much sleep as needed holds for all age groups,\nthough it is less pronounced among young adults, aged 18 to 29. All other\ngroups show declines in excess of 10 percentage points.\n\nYounger women, at 27%, are much less likely than other age-by-gender groups to\nreport getting adequate sleep. Younger men, at 46%, and older women, at 44%,\nare about equally likely to report getting adequate sleep, while older men, as\nis typical, are most likely to do so, with 51% getting the sleep they need in\n2023.\n\nGiven that the percentage of young women getting enough sleep is so much lower\nthan for other groups, the gender gap is much larger among younger than older\nadults. In 2023, there is a 19-point difference between women and men aged 18\nto 49, while the gap between women and men aged 50 and older is seven points.\n\nYounger men show only a modest drop in reporting getting adequate sleep over\ntime, while a growing number of younger women aren\u2019t getting the sleep they\nneed. In 2001, a slight majority of younger men, 54%, reported getting enough\nsleep, dropping to 46% in 2023. For younger women, 42% reported getting the\nsleep they need in 2001, while today, only 27% say so.\n\n### Americans More Stressed Today Than Three Decades Ago\n\nWhat might be driving these downward trends in sleep? Research on health and\nwellness shows a strong connection between stress and sleep quality. According\nto the American Psychological Association, the relationship between sleep and\nstress goes both ways -- those who sleep less are more stressed, and those who\nare more stressed sleep less. Indeed, the new poll shows that 63% of those who\nreport wanting more sleep say they frequently experience stress, compared with\n31% of those who get the sleep they need.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the number of Americans who are stressed has been on a\nsteady incline after a sharp drop in 2003. The most recent data show that\nnearly half of all Americans, 49%, report frequently experiencing stress, up\n16 points over the past two decades and the highest in Gallup\u2019s trend to date.\n\nJust as with sleep, there continues to be a gap in stress levels between women\nand men in the U.S. That gap has fluctuated over time; it was narrowest\nbetween 2004 and 2007. However, over the past six years, the gap has grown. In\n2023, 53% of women report frequently experiencing stress, compared with 45% of\nmen.\n\nYounger women are the most likely of the four major gender-by-age groups to\nsay they frequently experience stress, exceeding men their age by 14 points.\nThey are also 29 points more likely than women 50 and older to report frequent\nstress.\n\nYounger women have also experienced the sharpest increase in frequent stress\nof the four groups, with their levels rising 23 points since 2007, compared\nwith an eight-point increase among older women. By contrast, the levels of\nreported frequent stress have increased three points among younger men and\nfive points among men 50-plus since 2007.\n\n### Implications\n\nAmericans are sleeping less and are less satisfied with the amount they sleep.\nReports of frequently feeling stressed are also on the rise. Gallup polling\nand other research show a strong connection between sleep, stress, and overall\nhealth. Thus, the impact of both of these trends on Americans\u2019 health could be\nsubstantial.\n\nThe decline in sleep and the increase in stress levels in the U.S. are\nconsistently worse for younger women than for men and older women. This aligns\nwith Gallup\u2019s data on mental health and wellbeing, which show that younger\nAmericans and women seem to be suffering at greater rates. For example,\ndepression is on the rise for women and younger adults, and women and younger\nAmericans are more likely to evaluate their mental health as fair or poor\ncompared with men and older adults. Furthermore, a recent Walton Family\nFoundation and Gallup study on Generation Z finds that getting enough sleep\nand relaxation play an important part in happiness among America\u2019s youth. Gen\nZ who report having enough time to sleep and relax are twice as likely to say\nthey are happy as those who do not get enough sleep or relaxation.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us\non X.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\n## Survey Methods\n\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Dec.\n1-20, 2023, with a random sample of 1,013 adults, aged 18 and older, living in\nall 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the\ntotal sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage\npoints at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error\ninclude computed design effects for weighting.\n\nEach sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 80% cellphone\nrespondents and 20% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by\ntime zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected\nusing random-digit-dial methods.\n\nIn addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in\nconducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public\nopinion polls.\n\n## Related Topics Include:\n\nUSA All Gallup Headlines Emotions and Mood Health Wellbeing\n\n### Access Crucial Data for Your Research\n\nSearch, examine, compare and export nearly a century of primary data.\n\nLearn More about Access Crucial Data for Your Research\n\n## Recommended\n\nWellbeing\n\nDec 14, 2023\n\n### In U.S., Physical Health Plummets After the Pandemic\n\nPost pandemic, U.S. obesity and diabetes rates have reached record highs amid\nsignificant declines in healthy eating and other health habits.\n\nWellbeing\n\nFeb 8, 2024\n\n### Less Than Half of Americans \"Very Satisfied\" With Own Lives\n\nAmericans are the least satisfied with their personal lives than they have\nbeen since 2011, but some subgroups are faring better than others.\n\nWorld\n\nMar 8, 2024\n\n### Underemployment Carries Hidden Costs for Women\n\nIn the majority of countries worldwide, women's wellbeing suffers when they\naren't working at their desired capacity.\n\nWellbeing\n\nJan 18, 2024\n\n### New Normal: Lower U.S. Life Ratings\n\nIn 2023, 52.1% of U.S. adults rated their lives well enough to be considered\n\"thriving,\" three points below the norms set in 2015-2019 and 2021.\n\nApril 15, 2024 Gallup https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-\nless-stressed.aspx Gallup World Headquarters, 901 F Street, Washington, D.C.,\n20001, U.S.A +1 202.715.3030\n\nGallup\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Gallup, Inc.
