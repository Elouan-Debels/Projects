My parents have a\nsuccessful business that allowed us to live a comfortable, upper-middle class\nlife in a country where minimum wage employees have to work a full day to make\nwhat their Canadian equivalents made in an hour.\n\nWe weren\u2019t Crazy Rich Asians. But we were more than comfortable in our little\ncondo in Manila\u2019s Chinatown.\n\nWe had two cars. We went on vacations outside the country multiple times a\nyear. My sisters and I even went to private school and had maids who cleaned,\ncooked, and laid out our uniforms every day.\n\nThen in 2012 when I was 17, my family left the Philippines to immigrate to\nCanada for good. But before we left, my parents\u2019 equally upper-middle class\nfriends posed this crass question:\n\n> \u201cWhy are you going to Canada? To clean your own toilets?\u201d\n\nThat stuck with me over the years. In this essay, I discuss why my parents\nleft their status, their network of influential lifelong friends, and their\nbusiness to emigrate to a country where they were nobodies. And yes, you\u2019ll\nlearn why it was worth going to a country where my mom cooks, my dad does\nlaundry, and I clean the toilets.\n\nYou see, my parents have a different perception of wealth than the North\nAmerican version. For the past 25 years, they drilled into me that wealth\nisn\u2019t just about vacations. Or about having a certain amount of money in the\nbank. Or driving a Tesla just because you make enough money each month to pay\nit off.\n\nThey taught me that true wealth is about having the cash and the financial\nskills to pay off your credit statement in full each month, not just the\nminimum. Never just the minimum.\n\nTrue wealth is about having a long-term plan for your financial status that\nhedges you and your loved ones from unforeseen circumstances \u2014 like a\nworldwide pandemic \u2014 and unsavoury people.\n\nFinally, true wealth is about having peace of mind and freedom to prioritize\nthe things in life that are the most valuable to you, whether that\u2019s family,\nexperiences, or \u2014 sure \u2014 driving a Tesla.\n\nTake a look at this pyramid I made, patterned after Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of\nNeeds:\n\nI call this the True Wealth Pyramid and in this essay, we\u2019ll dissect it from\nthe bottom, up:\n\n  * Why you should build a liquid profit-first company\n\n  * Why financial wealth isn\u2019t enough\n\n  * Why true wealth is about protection & preservation\n\n  * Why you don\u2019t need to \u201cprove\u201d your wealth\n\nAnd we\u2019ll start with the vehicle by which my parents built their financial\nwealth: their cashflow-heavy business.\n\nA short message: I usually write about web3, creativity, and the creator\neconomy. If these interest you, you\u2019ll probably enjoy my weekly newsletter.\nSubscribe below to get more posts, or check out previous editions to \u201ctry\nbefore you buy\u201d.\n\n## Why You Should Build a Liquid Profit-First Company\n\nCompany growth shouldn\u2019t be measured by vanity metrics like daily active users\n(DAU), team size, or even annual recurring revenue. A company should only be\nmeasured by how much more cash is flowing in, versus flowing out.\n\nSure, you can use other metrics to support cashflow, like DAU, accounts\nreceivable, and revenue. But they\u2019re all secondary to profit.\n\nWhy would you ever run a business at a loss? Would that even be called a\nbusiness?\n\nI can never get behind the Silicon Valley \u201cbusiness model\u201d of fundraising as a\nsource of capital. I should know. Because business is in my blood.\n\nI grew up watching my parents build a B2B personal care packaging business\nfrom 0 to 7 figures in Canadian dollars of annual recurring revenue, with a\nconservative estimated profit margin of 60% and a team of less than 10 people.\n\nThey didn\u2019t build a company then scrabble to find clients. They went to China\nto source suppliers only after people told them exactly what they wanted to\norder.\n\nThey never borrowed a single cent from anyone. They saved up while working for\nmy uncle\u2019s business, before starting theirs. They turned a profit from the\nvery first sale.\n\nAnd the kicker? They started the business in an insanely bureaucratic third\nworld country \u2014 in 2003.\n\nThis was 5 years before Tim Ferriss\u2019 The 4-Hour Workweek popularized the ideas\nof lifestyle design, being a digital nomad, and testing demand before ordering\ninventory. This was pre-Shopify, pre-Flexport, and pre-remote work.\n\nAnd this approach carried over to our family life, too.\n\nWhile most families talk about sports and school around the dinner table while\navoiding the topic of money, my parents wanted to make sure that their wealth\ndidn\u2019t stop with them. Over adobo, rice, and Jollibee, they gave my sisters\nand I a practical MBA on human relationships (a.k.a. HR), thriftiness,\nprofitability, and management.\n\nOne of their guiding principles continues to be liquidity. You never overreach\nyour spending, so you can keep yourself out of debt when an emergency happens.\nAnd when the market falls, you buy low and sell high. Here\u2019s more:\n\n  * You spend what you made last month, not what you think you\u2019ll make next month\n\n  * If you can\u2019t buy something twice, you can\u2019t afford it\n\n  * Never invest what you can\u2019t afford to lose\n\nOh, and you know what my mom said when I proudly told her I had a 30%-50%\nsavings rate? \u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re living at home. You should save more.\u201d\n\nYou probably chuckled. Now if you\u2019re thinking my parents are just relics of a\nbygone era of old-fashioned, pre-internet Gen X businesspeople, they\u2019re not.\n\nFor example, Commonthread Collective (CTC) is at the cutting edge of ecommerce\nmedia buying, and they focus on profit and cashflow, too.\n\nCTC is a direct-to-consumer (DTC) agency that helps ecommerce brands grow\nsales. In the DTC world, you need cashflow to pay for more product and\nadvertising, usually every 30-60 days. They calculate the value of each\ncustomer by how much cash each customer spends with their brands in the first\n60 days, also known as a 60-day lifetime value (LTV). Focusing on this,\ninstead of a traditional God-knows-how-long customer LTV, lets them have cash\non hand when they need it (and not 6 months down the road when they\u2019re already\nout of business).\n\nBecause who cares about changing the world and building unicorns when you\nstartle awake at night, sweating because you can\u2019t make payroll that week?\n\n## Why Financial Wealth Isn\u2019t Enough\n\nI believe building a profitable business is the fastest way to build wealth.\nBut what is it?\n\nThanks to my parents\u2019 dinner table MBA, I know that wealth, as defined by\nhaving a lot of money in the bank, is just one definition.\n\nWealth is also about having an abundance of valuable possessions, beyond\nmoney. It\u2019s about the state of being rich, not a fleeting moment of\nprosperity. It\u2019s about having copious amounts of a specific resource, whether\nthat\u2019s power, influence, skills, or intimate relationships.\n\nBeyond material possessions, true wealth is sustainable, scalable, and\ndefensible.\n\n  * Sustainable \u2014 Can you do this month after month, for years?\n\n  * Scalable \u2014 Can you ratchet your wealth up (or down) at will?\n\n  * Defensible \u2014 How much of the flow of resources is within your control, independent of outside influence?\n\nTrue wealth is about having an inner confidence in what you\u2019ve built inside\nand outside yourself. It\u2019s about having a deep reservoir of skills and sturdy\nrelationships that can pick you up, whether you get laid off, lose all your\nclients, or file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nTrue wealth is a hedge against future social, economic, or financial crises,\nincluding another pandemic. Turning a material profit, building savings, and\nbuying more property... These should just be pieces in an ever-compounding\nphalanx of protection against situations outside of your control, around you\nand those you love.\n\nNew York Times bestselling author James Clear put it well when he said,\n\n> \u201cDon\u2019t let a proxy become the target. Don\u2019t optimize for the wrong outcome.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t optimize for profit and financial wealth when what you want is true\nprotective wealth.\n\n## Why True Wealth Is About Protection & Preservation\n\nBeyond protection against the unforeseeable future, wealth is a moat against\npeople outside of our control. True wealth is a barricade so we don\u2019t bend the\nknee against motivations, worldviews, and values that run counter to ours.\n\nIn one of my favourite Korean dramas, Itaewon Class, the protagonist builds a\nrestaurant chain from the ground up, just so no one could force him to\ncompromise his principles or could mess with his friends and employees.\n\nSimilarly, most of my parents\u2019 friends questioned their decision to run a\nmultimillion dollar business remotely. But my parents worked (and continue to\nwork!) evenings in Toronto to keep the Manila-based business going for the\nstaff.\n\nAnd their efforts paid off. Even during the pandemic, no one got laid off. The\ncompany hired day labourers and paid them, even when they had to run a\nskeleton workforce and cut everyone\u2019s hours. And the shiny new office building\nthat started construction in late 2019? No financial hiccups.\n\nPart of this sustainability was because my parents had trustworthy people\naround them. The other factor was that their war chest of business savings\nallowed them to stand by their staff and their principles, in spite of a\nworldwide pandemic.\n\nUnfortunately, others aren\u2019t so principled. Historically, powerful people have\nused their wealth to build invisible-but-potent guardrails into society to\nhelp them stay rich. Today, we call these guardrails inequality. But as this\nstudy on informal entrepreneurship found, inequality isn\u2019t just a divisive\nfactor. It\u2019s also a characteristic that binds us as a society and is a force\nthat drives its victims to build organizations to dismantle the system that\nheld them back.\n\nTo combat inequality and uphold principles, you need wealth that gives you the\ninfluence and power to remake the world as you see fit. It gives you the\nammunition to fight for what you think is right, whether that\u2019s to wrestle for\nresponsible journalism, like billionaire Peter Thiel did in Ryan Holiday\u2019s\nbook Conspiracy, or to dismantle systemic inequality completely.\n\n## Why You Don\u2019t Need to \u201cProve\u201d Your Wealth\n\nSince childhood I have been taught to think that if I don\u2019t run a company or a\nbusiness, that I can\u2019t accumulate wealth.\n\nThrough no pressure from my parents, I\u2019ve always preferred business to\nanything school tried to teach me. I saw how it gave my parents the freedom to\nspend more time with us, to travel whenever they wanted (my mom was the\noriginal digital nomad), and when we came to Canada, to settle into a new life\nwithout having to beg for jobs at Costco.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been thinking.\n\nAfter all this talk about business and what motivates born-and-bred\nentrepreneurs like us to do what we do, I want to pose a derivative question\nto you:\n\nDo you really want to build a massive business?\n\n  * Are you ready to withstand investor pressure when all you have is your gut-feel?\n\n  * Are you ready to take responsibility for the families of dozens, hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of people in your company?\n\n  * Are you ready to wake up in the middle of the night, anxious, because one wrong word could tank your reputation and get you cancelled on Twitter?\n\nAs Ryan Holiday says,\n\n> \u201cThe reward for success shouldn\u2019t be that you don\u2019t get to do the thing that\n> you like anymore.\u201d\n\nTo put this quote in North American terms: my parents and their low-key wealth\nlets them do whatever the hell they want, without giving a rat\u2019s a** about\nwhat other people think.\n\nUnlike the movie Crazy Rich Asians, my parents never postured their money with\nPrada purses, Range Rovers, or the latest iPhone. My dad, actually, is really\ninto buying and selling stuff on Facebook Marketplace, even when he could\nafford to buy everything brand new and his time is worth more than the profit\nhe makes selling there. My mom had an iPhone 6 \u2014 not even a 6S! \u2014 for 5 years.\nShe hesitantly passed it down to me, only after we bought her a used iPhone 7\nPlus.\n\nIn stark contrast, we have family friends who were kidnapped for ransom\nbecause the kidnappers knew they had money to pay. Some lost their hair \u2014 and\ntheir families \u2014 because they were hell-bent on putting up another hotel or\nbuying another business. A couple of them were assassinated by their own\nfamily members over the business or money.\n\nOn the flip side, time and time again I\u2019ve seen my parents play down their\nsuccess in favour of time with us and a quiet life. In fact they kept\neverything a secret so well, that we had well-meaning friends offer to help\npay my premature youngest sister\u2019s hospital bills. They thought my parents\nwere penniless because they chose to drive a Toyota Revo, not a Ford\nExpedition or a Cadillac Escalade. My parents politely declined.\n\nAnd I\u2019d like to think that these priorities have carried over to me as well.\n\nLike my parents in Canada, I\u2019m a nobody. Here, I\u2019m not the one whose parents\ncould send a text message and instantly get her job interviews at the most\nelite companies in the country. I\u2019m not the kid who calls some of the most\ninfluential business people nationwide, uncle/auntie or ninong/ninang (Hokkien\nfor godparents). I\u2019m not the girl other parents talked about when she was\noffered an academic scholarship and a full-ride swim scholarship for the top\nuniversity. (No, my parents did not pull strings for that.)\n\nCrazy Rich Asians or not, many of my friends in Canada have bigger houses,\nnicer cars, and more prestigious university degrees and job titles. Most of my\nfriends back in the Philippines swam in the Olympics, work for multinational\nCPG companies, or are being groomed to take over the family business.\n\nBut they\u2019re my friends because they don\u2019t want anything from me. They don\u2019t\nneed anything from me. Ironically, I know they\u2019re real ones because they don\u2019t\nthink much of me beyond ... Well, me.\n\nAnd I prefer it that way.\n\nUnlike our North American counterparts, my sisters and I don\u2019t have trust\nfunds or RESPs. We do have fully-funded TFSAs, thanks to Mom, but we haven\u2019t\ntouched them, even if she said that that\u2019s her version of giving us trust\nfunds. She\u2019s trained us to forget that money even exists. In fact, one of our\nrunning family jokes is that us kids are probably not even in our parents\u2019\nwill.\n\nMy sisters and I would howl and die in laughter if you called us heiresses. If\nanything we\u2019re the knock-off Dollarama versions \u2014 another running family joke.\nMy sisters go thrifting. I\u2019m a bit classier: I buy all my clothes brand new on\nsale (only on sale) at UNIQLO. Honest to God, your sneaker-collector boyfriend\nprobably has more shoes than all four of us put together.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nI didn\u2019t mind working multiple co-op jobs (paid internships, for you\nAmericans) to pay my way through university. Even now, I like being a writer,\ndoing marketing, and quietly building (minding?) my own business. I enjoy the\nprocess of making a name for myself without relying on my family\u2019s reputation.\n\nAnd one day through my own hard work, maybe \u2014 eventually \u2014 I can be just like\nmy dad who paid for his dream car in cash for his 50th birthday. One day, I\u2019ll\nbuy a Tesla and a house with my own hard-earned cash from my business.\n\nBut even then, I\u2019ll probably still clean my own toilets.\n\nstart hereEssays\n\nRoxine Kee\n\nPrevious\n\nPrevious\n\n## How to Make Terror-Free Career-Defining Decisions\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## Influencers: David Dobrik & The Power of the Modern Media Celebrity\n\n### Next Step?
