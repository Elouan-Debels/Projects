He specifically delved into Venice\nDB, the NoSQL data store used for feature persistence. The presenter shared\nthe lessons learned from evolving and operating the platform, including\ncluster management and library versioning.\n\nLinkedIn has many AI/ML features, including People You May Know, all of which\nare powered by the company\u2019s AI/ML platform, which provides support for\nfeature ingestion, generation, and storage, as well as model training,\nvalidation, and inference. The platform focuses on enhancing the productivity\nof data scientists and engineers, providing opinionated and unified end-to-end\ncapabilities that support development, experimentation, and operation for\nAI/ML workloads.\n\nF\u00e9lix GV, a principal staff engineer at LinkedIn, provided an overview of the\nAI/ML platform\u2019s architecture and key technologies used by various subsystems.\nFrame is a virtual feature store that supports several storage backends:\noffline (Iceberg table), streaming (Kafka topic), and online (Venice store,\nPinot table). LinkedIn open-sourced much of Frame's functionality as the\nFeathr project, which had a 1.0 release published recently.\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s AI/ML Platform Architecture (Source: QCon London Website)\n\nThe AI/ML platform uses the FedEx subsystem for feature 'productionization',\nincluding preparation/transformation and pushing feature data to VeniceDB for\nfeature serving. King Kong is used for model training, and Model Cloud is used\nfor model serving. Model Cloud provides observability and monitoring,\nbenchmarking and analysis, GPU support, as well as self-service onboarding.\n\nGV discussed the role and evolution of VeniceDB as a derived data platform\nspecifically created to support online storage for AI/ML use cases. The\nproject was open-sourced in September 2022 and has received 800 new commits\nsince then. Venice supports dataset versioning, which allows large datasets to\nbe pushed from offline sources and seamless switching between dataset versions\nonce the ingestion job is complete.\n\nData Ingestion into VeniceDB (Source: QCon London Website)\n\nVeniceDB has evolved to reduce read latency from below ten milliseconds (p99)\nusing the default thin client to below ten microseconds (p99) using a RAM-\nbacked Da Vinci client that consumes updates directly from the data-ingestion\nKafka topic. The VeniceDB team ensures strong backward compatibility of the\nthree clients it supports to allow clients to easily migrate between them in\ncase they want to benefit from lower-latency reads.\n\nGV shared challenges and lessons learned by the team operating VeniceDB at\nLinkedIn. The data platform team strongly emphasizes keeping control over the\ninfrastructure layout and cluster assignments, as this allows them to manage\nthe clusters without inconveniencing the client teams. This is especially\nimportant considering different workload bounds, with either storage or\ntraffic being the limiting factor.\n\nThe choice of a compression algorithm plays an essential role in storage-bound\nworkloads, and the team observed using ZSTD offers significantly better\nresults in most cases. Similarly, for storing embeddings, the serialization\nprotocol can massively reduce memory and compute utilization, and the team\nachieved substantial improvement by using its own optimized Avro utilities.\n\nLastly, GV remarked on the importance of effective client library version\nmanagement. The team has adopted an aggressive policy for deprecating old\nversions, with automated dependency upgrade promotion/application.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Rafal Gancarz\n\nRafal is an experienced technology leader and expert.
