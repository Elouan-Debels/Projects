Apple's press release said the policy will also apply to used\nbiometric sensors for Face ID and Touch ID. Apple's existing parts \"pairing\"\nprocess will confirm whether or not a used part is genuine.\n\nIn the fall, Apple says calibration for both new and used genuine Apple parts\nwill happen on device after the part is installed. If an iPhone has been\nrepaired, a \"Parts and Service History\" section appears in the Settings app\nunder General \u2192 About, and Apple says it will be expanding this section to\nshow whether a genuine part is new or used.\n\nApple also announced that customers and service providers will no longer need\nto provide a device's serial number when ordering parts from its self-service\nrepair store for repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.\n\nTo deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts, Apple said it will\nbe extending its Activation Lock security feature to iPhone parts:\n\n> Apple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts\n> in order to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts.\n> Requested by customers and law enforcement officials, the feature was\n> designed to limit iPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from\n> being reactivated. If a device under repair detects that a supported part\n> was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled,\n> calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.\n\nApple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus said the new policy will be\nmore environmentally friendly by extending the lifespan of parts:\n\n> For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product\n> design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won't\n> compromise users' safety, security, or privacy. With this latest expansion\n> to our repair program, we're excited to be adding even more choice and\n> convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our\n> products and their parts.\n\nApple said the policy will apply to future iPhone models.\n\nTags: Apple Authorized Service Providers, Independent Repair Provider Program,\nSelf Service Repair Guide\n\n[ 25 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nAgeOfSpiracles\n\n2 hours ago at 06:21 am\n\n> To make sure an owner with two broken iPhone can't end up with a working\n> iPhone...\n>\n> FTFY\n\nIf you own both phones, then why would activation lock have any impact on you?\n\nScore: 14 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nTokyoKiller\n\n2 hours ago at 06:22 am\n\n> If you own both phones, then why would activation lock have any impact on\n> you?\n\nJust rage farming.\n\nScore: 8 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nAgeOfSpiracles\n\n2 hours ago at 06:20 am\n\n> I love Activation Lock on paper, but in practice it seems like would-be\n> thieves haven't gotten the memo yet.\n\nIn practice, do you see a lot of iPhone thefts? I'm sure it happens, but\nanecdotally it seems like it is way down since activation lock was\nimplemented. Looking on eBay, locked phones are nearly worthless compared to\nclean phones, and extending it to all the serialized parts in a phone will\ntake that value to the friggin' basement.\n\nScore: 7 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nAgeOfSpiracles\n\n1 hour ago at 06:41 am\n\n> Because the parts are still LOCKED.

If you buy a broken phone, then the seller should remove the\nlock. If you buy a stolen phone, then yeah, you're going to have a problem.\n\nScore: 7 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\noneMadRssn\n\n57 minutes ago at 07:04 am\n\n> In practice, do you see a lot of iPhone thefts?

They're just looking to\nget a quick $20. And the folks that buy stolen phones from crackheads are\nwilling to take the risk on activation lock for such a low price. As long as 1\nout of every 20 or so phones aren't locked or have an easily-guessable\npasscode before the owner locks them, it justifies losing $20 on the other 19.\n\nSecond, as you alluded, there is a market for second-hand iPhone parts. So\neven if the logic board is toast, the parts still have value. This is why I\nthink Apple's change here will be awesome - if the screen and battery are\nlocked too, then there is pretty much 0 value to a locked stolen iPhone.\n\nScore: 4 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nrandyhudson\n\n2 hours ago at 06:19 am\n\nTo make sure an owner with two broken iPhones can't possibly create a working\none...\n\nFTFY\n\nScore: 3 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nRead All Comments\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n### When to Expect a New Apple TV to Launch\n\nTuesday April 9, 2024 8:30 am PDT by Joe Rossignol\n\nIt has been nearly a year and a half since the current Apple TV was released,\nso the device is becoming due for a hardware upgrade.
