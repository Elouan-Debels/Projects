He made unsuccessful attempts to observe the 1761\nand 1769 transits of Venus from India.\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\nGuillaume Le Gentil was born in Coutances and first intended to enter the\nchurch before turning to astronomy. He discovered what are now known as the\nMessier objects M32, M36 and M38, as well as the nebulosity in M8, and he was\nthe first to catalogue the dark nebula sometimes known as Le Gentil 3 (in the\nconstellation Cygnus).\n\nLe Gentil's drawing of the Orion Nebula.\n\nHe was part of the international collaborative project organized by Mikhail\nLomonosov to measure the distance to the Sun, by observing the transit of\nVenus at different points on the earth. Edmond Halley had suggested the idea,\nbut it required careful measurements from different places on earth, and the\nproject was launched with more than a hundred observers dispatched to\ndifferent parts of the globe, for observing the transit coming up in 1761. A\npart of the French expedition, Le Gentil set out for Pondicherry, a French\npossession in India.^[1] He set out from Paris in March 1760, and reached Isle\nde France (now Mauritius) in July. However, the Seven Years' War had broken\nout between France and Britain in the meantime, hindering further passage\neast. He finally managed to gain passage on a frigate that was bound for\nIndia's Coromandel Coast, and he sailed in March 1761 with the intention of\nobserving the transit from Pondicherry. Even though the transit was only a few\nmonths away, on 6 June, he was assured that they would make it in time.\n\nThe ship was blown off-course by unfavorable winds and spent five weeks at\nsea. By the time it finally got close to Pondicherry, the captain learned that\nthe British had occupied the city, so the frigate was obliged to return to\nIsle de France. When 6 June came the sky was clear, but the ship was still at\nsea, and he could not take astronomical observations with the vessel rolling\nabout.^[2] Having already completed the trip from Paris, he stayed for the\nnext transit of Venus, which would come in another eight years (they occur in\npairs 8 years apart, but each such pair is separated from the next by 121 or\n105 years).^[3]\n\nAfter spending some time mapping the eastern coast of Madagascar, he decided\nto record the 1769 transit from Manila in the Philippines. Encountering\nhostility from the Spanish authorities there, he headed back to Pondicherry,\nwhich had been restored to France by peace treaty in 1763, where he arrived in\nMarch 1768. He built a small observatory to view the transit. On the day of\nthe event, 4 June 1769, the sky became overcast, and Le Gentil saw nothing.\n\nThe return trip was first delayed by dysentery, and further when his ship was\ncaught in a storm and dropped him off at \u00cele Bourbon (R\u00e9union), where he had\nto wait until a Spanish ship took him home. He finally arrived in Paris in\nOctober 1771, having been away for eleven years, only to find that he had been\ndeclared legally dead and been replaced in the Royal Academy of Sciences. His\nwife had remarried,^[dubious \u2013 discuss] and all his relatives had\n\"enthusiastically plundered his estate\".^[4] Due to shipwrecks and wartime\nattacks on ships, none of the letters he had sent to the Academy or to his\nrelatives had reached their destinations.^[5]^[dubious \u2013 discuss] Lengthy\nlitigation and the intervention of the king were ultimately required before he\nrecovered his seat in the academy and remarried.\n\nDuring the time he spent in India, Le Gentil examined local astronomical\ntraditions and wrote several notes on the topic.^[6]^[7] He reported that the\nduration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 was predicted by a Tamil\nastronomer, based on the computation of the size and extent of the earth-\nshadow, and was found short by 41 seconds, whereas the charts of Tobias Mayer\nwere wrong by 68 seconds.^[8]\n\nHe died in Paris in 1792.^[9]\n\n## Play and opera[edit]\n\nLe Gentil is the subject of a play by Canadian playwright Maureen Hunter.\nTransit of Venus was first produced at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in 1992. It\nwas subsequently made into an opera of the same name with music by Victor\nDavies, presented by Manitoba Opera in 2007, and Opera Carolina in 2010.\n\n## Literature[edit]\n\nLe Gentil is the subject of a novel by Antoine Laurain Les Caprices d'un\nastre, published in 2022, and translated into English in 2023 as An Astronomer\nin Love .\n\n## Tributes[edit]\n\nBoulevard Legentil-de-la-Galaisi\u00e8re, one of the main streets in his home town\nCoutances, was named after him in 1866.^[10] Le Gentil crater on the Moon was\nnamed in his honour in 1935,^[a] and asteroid 12718 Le Gentil in 2004.^[11]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The location of Le Gentil crater was changed in 1961, alongside two others out of the 614 craters named in 1935. The reason for changing its location (giving the name to another crater instead) is unknown.^[12]\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n  * A detailed account of Le Gentil's expedition was published in a series of four articles by Helen Sawyer Hogg^[13]^[14]^[15]^[16]\n  * Le Gentil's own account was published in Voyage dans les mers de l'Inde, fait par ordre du Roi, \u00e0 l'occasion du passage de V\u00e9nus, sur le disque du Soleil, le 6 juin 1761 & le 3 du m\u00eame mois 1769 par M.
