This rule of thumb was devised by\nWilliam W. Naismith, a Scottish mountaineer, in 1892.^[1]^[3]^[4] A modern\nversion can be formulated as follows:\n\n    Allow one hour for every 3 miles (5 km) forward, plus an additional hour for every 2,000 feet (600 m) of ascent.^[2]^[5]\n\n## Assumptions and calculations[edit]\n\nPace^[6] in minutes per kilometre or mile vs. slope angle resulting from\nNaismith's rule^[7] for basal speeds of 5 and 4 km / h.^[n 1]\n\nThe original Naismith's rule from 1892 says that one should allow one hour per\nthree miles on the map and an additional hour per 2000 feet of ascent.^[1]^[4]\nIt is included in the last sentence of his report from a trip.^[1]^[8]\n\nToday it is formulated in many ways. Naismith's 1 h / 3 mi + 1 h / 2000 ft can\nbe replaced by:\n\n  * 1 h / 3 mi (5 km) + 1 h / 2000 ft (600 m)^[2]^[5]^[9]\n  * 1 h / 5 km (3 mi) + 1/2 h / 300 m (1000 ft)^[10]^[11]^[12]\n  * 3 mph + 1\u20442 h / 1000 ft 5 km/h + 1\u20442 h / 300 m^[13]^[n 2]\n  * 12 min / 1 km + 10 min / 100 m^[8]\n\nThe basic rule assumes hikers of reasonable fitness, on typical terrain, and\nunder normal conditions. It does not account for delays, such as extended\nbreaks for rest or sightseeing, or for navigational obstacles. For planning\nexpeditions a team leader may use Naismith's rule in putting together a route\ncard.^[citation needed]\n\nIt is possible to apply adjustments or \"corrections\" for more challenging\nterrain, although it cannot be used for scrambling routes. In the grading\nsystem used in North America, Naismith's rule applies only to hikes rated\nClass 1 on the Yosemite Decimal System, and not to Class 2 or\nhigher.^[citation needed]\n\nIn practice, the results of Naismith's rule are usually considered the minimum\ntime necessary to complete a route.^[citation needed]\n\nWhen walking in groups, the speed of the slowest person is calculated.^[13]\n\nNaismith's rule appears in UK statute law, although not by name. The Adventure\nActivities Licensing Regulations apply to providers of various activities\nincluding trekking. Part of the definition of trekking is that it is over\nterrain on which it would take more than 30 minutes to reach a road or refuge\n(by the quickest safe route), based on a walking speed of 5 kilometres per\nhour plus an additional minute for every 10 metres of ascent.^[14]\n\nA plot of walking speed versus slope resulting from Naismith's rule^[7] and\nLangmuir corrections^[7]^[15] for base speeds of 5 km/h and 4 km/h compared to\nTobler's hiking function.^[16]^[n 1]\n\n## Scarf's equivalence between distance and climb[edit]\n\nAlternatively, the rule can be used to determine the equivalent flat distance\nof a route. This is achieved by recognising that Naismith's rule implies an\nequivalence between distance and climb in time terms: 3 miles (=15,840 feet)\nof distance is equivalent in time terms to 2000 feet of climb.^[17]\n\nProfessor Philip Scarf, Associate Dean of Research and Innovation and\nProfessor of Applied Statistics at the University of Salford,^[18] in research\npublished in 2008, gives the following formula:^[4]\n\n    equivalent distance = x + \u03b1\u00b7y\n\nwhere:\n\n    x = horizontal distance\n    y = vertical distance\n    \u03b1 = 7.92 (3 mi / 2000 ft^[17]^[4]^[19]), called Naismith\u2019s number by Scarf^[17]^[4]^[19]\n\nThat is, 7.92 units of distance are equivalent to 1 unit of climb. For\nconvenience an 8 to 1 rule can be used. So, for example, if a route is 20\nkilometres (12 mi) with 1600 metres of climb (as is the case on leg 1 of the\nBob Graham Round, Keswick to Threlkeld), the equivalent flat distance of this\nroute is 20+(1.6\u00d78)=32.8 kilometres (20.4 mi). Assuming an individual can\nmaintain a speed on the flat of 5 km/h, the route will take 6 hours and 34\nminutes. The simplicity of this approach is that the time taken can be easily\nadjusted for an individual's own (chosen) speed on the flat; at 8 km/h (flat\nspeed) the route will take 4 hours and 6 minutes. The rule has been tested on\nfell running times and found to be reliable.^[17] Scarf proposed this\nequivalence in 1998.^[4]^[6]\n\nAs you can see, the Scarf's assumption allows also to calculate the time for\neach speed, not just one as in case of the original Naismith rule.\n\n### Pace[edit]\n\nPace is the reciprocal of speed. It can be calculated here from the following\nformula:^[6]^[19]\n\n    p = p0\u00b7(1 + \u03b1\u00b7m)\n\nwhere:\n\n    p = pace\n    p0 = pace on flat terrain\n    m = gradient uphill\n\nThis formula is true for m\u22650 (uphill or flat terrain).^[6]^[19] It assumes\nequivalence of distance and climb by applying mentioned earlier \u03b1\nfactor.^[4]^[19]\n\nSample calculations: p0 = 12 min / km (for 5 km / h speed), m = 0.6 km climb /\n5 km distance = 0.12, p = 12 \u00b7 (1 + 7.92 \u00b7 0.12) = 23.4 min / km.\n\n## Other modifications[edit]\n\nOver the years several adjustments have been formulated in an attempt to make\nthe rule more accurate by accounting for further variables such as load\ncarried, roughness of terrain, descents and fitness (or lack of it). The\naccuracy of some corrections is disputed,^[20] in particular the speed at\nwhich walkers descend a gentle gradient. No simple formula can encompass the\nfull diversity of mountain conditions and individual abilities.\n\n### Tranter's corrections[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by\nadding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and\nremoved. (September 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nTranter's corrections make adjustments for fitness and fatigue. Fitness is\ndetermined by the time it takes to climb 1000 feet over a distance of 1\u20442 mile\n(800 m). Additional adjustments for uneven or unstable terrain or conditions\ncan be estimated by dropping one or more fitness levels.\n\nIndividual fitness in minutes| Time taken in hours estimated using Naismith's\nrule  \n---|---  \n2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9| 10| 12| 14| 16| 18| 20| 22| 24  \n15 (very fit)| 1| 1.5| 2| 2.75| 3.5| 4.5| 5.5| 6.75| 7.75| 10| 12.5| 14.5| 17|\n19.5| 22| 24  \n20| 1.25| 2.25| 3.25| 4.5| 5.5| 6.5| 7.75| 8.75| 10| 12.5| 15| 17.5| 20| 23  \n25| 1.5| 3| 4.25| 5.5| 7| 8.5| 10| 11.5| 13.25| 15| 17.5  \n30| 2| 3.5| 5| 6.75| 8.5| 10.5| 12.5| 14.5  \n40| 2.75| 4.25| 5.75| 7.5| 9.5| 11.5| Too much to be attempted  \n50 (unfit)| 3.25| 4.75| 6.5| 8.5  \n  \nFor example, if Naismith's rule estimates a journey time of 9 hours and your\nfitness level is 25, you should allow 11.5 hours.\n\n### Aitken corrections[edit]\n\nAitken (1977) assumes that 1 h takes to cover 3 mi (5 km) on paths, tracks and\nroads, while this is reduced to 21\u20442 mi (4 km) on all other surfaces.^[5]\n\nFor both distances he gives an additional 1 h per 2000 ft (600 m) of\nascent.^[5] So Aitken doesn't take into account equivalence between distance\nand climb (proposed by Scarf in 1998^[4]^[6]).\n\n### Langmuir corrections[edit]\n\nLangmuir (1984) extends the rule on descent. He assumes the Naismith's base\nspeed of 5 km/h and makes the following further refinements for going\ndownhill:^[13]^[15]^[21]\n\n  * For a gentle decline (slopes between 5 degrees and 12 degrees) subtract 10 minutes for every 300 meters of descent^[13]^[15]^[21]\n  * For a steep decline (slopes greater than 12 degrees) add 10 minutes for every 300 meters of descent^[15]^[21]\n\nLater he says that the fitness of the slowest member of a party should be\ntaken into account and thus a more practical formula for a group is:^[13]\n\n  * 4 km/h + 1 h / 450 m of ascent^[13]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Preferred walking speed\n  * Tobler's hiking function\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Speed and pace for the Naismith rule were calculated here for its metric version (5 kilometres horizontally and 600 meters of ascent), not the original one (3 mi and 2,000 ft). In case of Naismith rule and Langmuir corrections the same, not modified value of ascent and descent was used for the distance of 4 km as for 5 km \u2013 600 m for the Naismith rule and 300 m for Langmuir corrections (not taking into account the equivalence between distance and climb).\n  2. ^ Langmuir 2013 recalls the Naismith's rule from 1892 in miles and feet, but further gives and uses it in metric system, climbing sometimes per contour line on a map (10 m or 50 m).^[13]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Naismith, W.
