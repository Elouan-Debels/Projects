ZkBlind NextJs is a solution that\nallows individuals to authenticate their employment with a specific company\nwithout revealing their actual identity.\n\n##\n\nHow ZkBlind NextJs Works\n\nZkBlind NextJs provides a seamless process for individuals to authenticate\ntheir employment using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Here's a step-by-step\nguide on how to use ZkBlindNextJs:\n\n  1. Send Email: Users can send an email from their corporate account to their personal account, including their Ethereum (ETH) address and its corresponding signature in the email body.\n\n  2. Generate ZKP: After downloading the email from the personal account, users can use the provided script to generate the Zero-Knowledge Proof.\n\n  3. Registration & Validation: Users can fill out a form on zkBlind with their ZKP, email suffix (indicating their company), ETH address, and user ID. ZkBlind NextJs will validate the submitted information and register user details in a smart contract upon successful validation.\n\n  4. Usage: Once registered, users can log in to ZkBlind NextJs with their ETH wallet and post messages. Despite being verified as an employee of a specific company (via their email suffix), their individual identity remains anonymous.\n\n##\n\nGetting Started with ZkBlind NextJs\n\nTo get started with ZkBlind NextJs, ensure that your node version is 15 or\nabove. Run npm i to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the\ndevelopment server using npm run dev or yarn dev. Open http://localhost:3000\nwith your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by\nmodifying pages/index.tsx, and the page auto-updates as you edit the file. API\nroutes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/hello, and this endpoint can\nbe edited in pages/api/hello.ts. The project uses next/font to automatically\noptimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.\n\n##\n\nDeploy on Vercel\n\nZkBlind NextJs can easily be deployed as a Next.js app using the Vercel\nPlatform, by the creators of Next.js.\n\nFor more detailed information, and to access the ZkBlindNextJs project, please\nvisit the official repository: ZkBlind NextJs GitHub.\n\nWe are thrilled to offer this innovative solution that prioritizes privacy,\nsecurity, and authentication for individuals. Join us in leveraging the power\nof Zero-Knowledge Proofs with ZkBlind NextJs.\n\nStay tuned for updates and features as we continue to enhance the capabilities\nof ZkBlind NextJs.\n\nDiscuss on Twitter \u2022 View on GitHub\n\n## Tags\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs ZkBlindNextJs Anonymity Authentication Ethereum ETH\nAddress Validation Smart Contract Node.js npm Next.js NextJs Vercel Encryption\nPrivacy Security Blockchain Web3 zkBind\n\n## Previous Article\n\nGitcoin beta round data analysis\n\n## Next Article\n\nMina Protocol: Unlocking the Power of the Mini-Blockchain Ecosystem\n\n\u2190 Back to the blog\n\nTwitter\n\nGitHub\n\nDiscord\n\nYouTube Dspyt Channel\n\nLinkedIn Dspyt\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dspyt\n\n", "frontpage": false}
