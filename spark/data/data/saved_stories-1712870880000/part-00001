Courtesy of Jak Kaw Press\n\n\u201cI wrote it out of frustration!\u201d says Dan Bussey, of his 3,500-page magnum\nopus. In the time it takes an apple scion to grow into a fruit-bearing tree\n(around 10 years), multiplied by three, Bussey has been scouring the archives\nof every library and horticultural resource in the United States, poring over\nfruit bulletins, nursery catalogues, and pomological books. The outcome of\ndiving head-first into this information avalanche is a book of such staggering\nbreadth and scale that, all volumes combined, it weighs 32 pounds (equivalent\nto roughly 100 apples).\n\nIn 2017, Bussey published the product of his decades-long archival trudge: The\nIllustrated History of Apples in the United States and Canada. An illustrated\nhardcover set of seven volumes, each between 500 and 600 pages long,\nIllustrated History is a compendium of every apple variety that has appeared\nin print in any North American publication in the last two centuries. It lists\nmore than 16,000 apple varieties, with names, origins, brief descriptions,\nand, on occasion, accompanying illustrations, all lifelike watercolors that\ncome from a database maintained by the Department of Agriculture from 1886 to\n1942. Bussey also included 9,700 found synonyms for the apples in the volumes,\nmaking it easier for enthusiasts to accurately identify different samples of\nthe fruit. The book has been heralded as \u201ca publishing marvel in the field of\nhorticulture,\u201d and flipping through the green, cloth-bound volumes, laden with\nexquisite watercolors and charming anecdotes about apples named Cox\u2019s Orange\nPippin and Pitmaston Pineapple, feels like a jaunt through the orchard of\nTime.\n\nBussey, 64, began his pomme-ological quest in 1989, while setting up an\norchard in his hometown of Edgerton, Wisconsin. He\u2019d grown interested in\nheirlooms in 1980, soon after reading the newly released book Apples and Man\nby Fred Lape, which bemoaned the loss of heirlooms and the poor quality of\nchemically treated supermarket apples. An aspiring homesteader, Bussey started\nwith about a dozen heirloom apple trees on the four-acre grounds where he also\nhoped to build a house. When the trees bore fruit, yielding Golden Sweets and\nSpitzenbergs (rumored to be Thomas Jefferson\u2019s favorite apple), their rich\nflavors were epiphanic. \u201cOh my god, it was phenomenal!\u201d Bussey says, of the\naromatic Spitzenberg\u2019s sweet-tart taste. Soon, he was growing over 350\nvarieties in the orchard. In a lively example of his impetus for botanical\nacquisitions, Bussey says the orchard was well under way before he had even\nstarted construction on his house. \u201cPriorities!\u201d he says, chuckling.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld. See Courses\n\nAt the time, he found little consolidated information about the heirlooms in\nhis orchard, so he began keeping a record of his own findings, gathered during\narchival dives at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He bought a computer\nwith a 40-megabyte hard drive, solely to compile his data. \u201cMy watch probably\nhas more information in it than that,\u201d he says. He still types his notes on\nWordPerfect, an early edition word-processing software, the continued use of\nwhich feels almost like an act of defiance.\n\nBussey struggles to explain his apple-centric pursuits. \u201cI just really loved\nthe names,\u201d he offers. \u201cSome have interesting stories,\u201d he says, a little\nlater. His mother taught him to plant and care for fruit trees, and his\nchildhood home was built in the middle of the family orchard. \u201cI\u2019ve always\nbeen surrounded by apples,\u201d he says, recalling the smell of fresh cider in his\nfamily\u2019s kitchen. Later, in an email, he writes that it was probably the\n\u201clittle joys a researcher finds\u201d coupled with \u201ca certain degree of \u2018mania.\u201d\n\nBussey found the flavors of the Golden Sweet (left) and Spitzenberg (right)\nrevelatory. COURTESY OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE POMOLOGICAL WATERCOLOR\nCOLLECTION. RARE AND SPECIAL COLLECTIONS, NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY\n\nIn addition to being an orchardist, Bussey made cider professionally for 24\nyears for the commercial orchards and amateur apple-growers of Edgerton. He\neven did a brief stint as a restaurant-supply salesman. Whenever time allowed,\nhe traveled thousands of miles, \u201cfrom New York state to Washington state,\u201d to\nlook at materials in archives across the country. \u201cI made it a point to keep\ndoing this because I kept finding new things,\u201d he says, simply. As just one\nexample of his extensive research, Bussey has pored over every report that he\ncould find published by every horticultural society in every state in the U.S.\n\u201cJust as I was beginning to convince myself I had enough material to work\nwith, well, just then I discovered internet libraries.\u201d\n\nOnly about 20 percent of the apples documented in Illustrated History are\nstill grown today, a phenomenon Bussey attributes to market forces driving up\ndemand for certain varieties and pushing others out of existence. In 2012, he\njoined the Seed Savers Exchange, which preserves heirloom fruits, vegetables,\nand crops, as their orchard manager and apple historian. But when Seed Savers,\nalong with university and commercial presses, passed on his book, Kent Whealy\nstepped in. A Macarthur Fellow and co-founder of Seed Savers Exchange, who had\nleft the organization acrimoniously, and is widely believed to have been\nforced out, Whealy set up his own publishing house with the express purpose of\ngetting Bussey\u2019s apple volumes to print.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so thrilled and just very grateful,\u201d Bussey says. It was Whealy who\narranged the inclusion of the 1,400 illustrations from the USDA Pomological\nWatercolors database that make the volumes come alive. (The database is\npublicly available now, but at the time, Whealy paid his own money to access\nthem.) Kent Whealy died in March 2018.\n\nIllustrated History won the 2018 Annual Literature Award for \u201ca significant\nwork in botanical or horticultural literature,\u201d given by the Council on\nBotanical and Horticultural Libraries. John Bunker, an apple historian in\nMaine, called it \u201cthe most important book ever published in North America\nabout apples. There has been nothing like it and there will never again be\nsomething like it.\u201d\n\nBussey\u2019s favorite apples are typically varieties of russets. COURTESY OF U.S.\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE POMOLOGICAL WATERCOLOR COLLECTION. RARE AND SPECIAL\nCOLLECTIONS, NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY\n\nHaving spent the majority of his life documenting apples, Bussey is still\nbiting of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. His next book project will\nfeature the stories of the people who brought these apples to North America.\nHe\u2019s consulting with plant geneticists who apply DNA technology to identify\napple varieties, and who have used DNA tests to build a genetic map charting\nthe lineage of apples. The significance of identifying apple pedigree goes\nbeyond its value within botanical or horticultural research. It tells a story\nof immigration, of the sorts of things people brought with them when they\ntraveled to build a new life in a new country. Bussey hopes to tell the\nstories of some of these settlers, approaching the narrative through \u201cthe\ngenetics of apple varieties that have traveled around in this country.\u201d\n\nBussey has discovered a couple of thousand more varieties since The\nIllustrated History of Apples was published. His favorite apple story is about\nthe Southern Shockley, named after its originator Gideon Shockley, who spotted\na lone apple tree while attending a friend\u2019s funeral. He took a bite of an\napple that had fallen beneath the tree, found it good, and snapped off a\nbranch that he planted back home. \u201cAnd so he kept the Shockley apple alive,\nwhich was one of the classic Southern apples for many years,\u201d says Bussey.\n\nIn a career spent discovering 18,000 varieties of apples, one might think he\u2019d\nhave a more compelling tale. But that he chose to tell this one perhaps says\nmore about Bussey than about the Shockley. The story of a man who happened\nupon a disappearing fragment of nature and nurtured it, who took a fruit that\nmight have become extinct, and helped it flourish, echoes Bussey\u2019s own\nmission: to resurrect the past, to celebrate the bounty of nature, to tell the\nstories of apples and men.\n\nGastro Obscura covers the world\u2019s most wondrous food and drink.
