I realize that I\u2019m about to alienate some of my friends that work on\nthe tech side of the music business. These are good well intentioned people\nwho genuinely want to help musicians succeed in the new digital paradigm. But\nif we are gonna come up with a system to compensate artists fairly in the new\ndigital age we need an honest discussion of what is going on. The tech side of\nthe music business really needs to look at how their actions and policies\nnegatively impact artists, just as they have pointed out the negative effect\nrecord company actions have had on artists.\n\nToo often the debate has been pirates vs the RIAA. This is ridiculous because\nthe artists, the 99 percent of the music business are left out of the debate.\nI\u2019m not advocating going back to the old record label model, to an industry\ndominated by the big three multi-national labels. This is a bit of hyperbole\nintended to make us all think about this question: Is the new digital model\nbetter for the artist?\n\nMeet the New Boss, Worse than the old boss\n\nIntroduction\n\nI was like all of you. I believed in the promise of the Internet to liberate,\nempower and even enrich artists. I still do but I\u2019m less sure of it than I\nonce was. I come here because I want to start a dialogue. I feel that what we\nartists were promised has not really panned out. Yes in many ways we have more\nfreedom. Artistically this is certainly true. But the music business never\ntransformed into the vibrant marketplace where small stakeholders could\ncompete with multinational conglomerates on an even playing field.\n\nIn the last few years it\u2019s become apparent the music business, which was once\ndominated by six large and powerful music conglomerates, MTV, Clear Channel\nand a handful of other companies, is now dominated by a smaller set of larger\neven more powerful tech conglomerates. And their hold on the business seems to\nbe getting stronger.\n\nOn one hand it doesn\u2019t bother me because the \u201cnew boss\u201d doesn\u2019t really tell me\nwhat kind of songs to write or who should mix my record. But on the other hand\nI\u2019m a little disturbed at how dependent I am on these tech behemoths to pursue\nmy craft. In fact it is nigh impossible for me to pursue my craft without\nenriching Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Further the new boss through\nit\u2019s surrogates like Electronic Frontier Foundation seems to be waging a\ncynical PR campaign that equates the unauthorized use of other people\u2019s\nproperty (artist\u2019s songs) with freedom. A sort of Cyber \u2013Bolshevik campaign of\nmass collectivization for the good of the state...er .. I mean Internet. I say\ncynical because when it comes to their intellectual property, software patents\nfor instance, these same companies fight tooth and nail.\n\nMeet the new boss, he wants to collectivize your songs!\n\nThe other problem? I\u2019ve been expecting for years now to see aggregate revenue\nflowing to artist increase. Disintermediation promised us this. It hasn\u2019t\nhappened. Everywhere I look artists seem to be working more for less money.\nAnd every time I come across aggregate data that is positive it turns out to\nhave a black cloud inside. Example: Touring revenues up since 1999. Because\nmore bands are touring, staying on the road longer and playing for fewer\npeople. Surely you all can see Malthusian trajectory?\n\nSLIDE 1\n\nWho Am I?\n\nI realize that some of you may not know much about me or even who I am. I like\nto think that I am uniquely qualified as an artist, entrepreneur and geek. I\nwas trained as a mathematician. My first job after I graduated involved being\nthe systems operator for an MPM OS system and I wrote a lot of DBASE IV\nscripts. I had a fascination with the old RPG punch card programming language.\nI am deeply involved in the digital amateur radio world. You can sometimes\nfind me operating PSK31 on 20 meters. I spent some time in Chicago near the\nCME. I worked as a \u201cQuant\u201d doing some semi high frequency trading. While there\nI became involved with a company called www.thepoint.com which evolved into\nwww.groupon.com.\n\nI can out geek most of you.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMy company is faster than your company.\n\nMusicians are constantly derided by the Digerati. It\u2019s usually after someone\nlike myself suggest that if other people are profiting from distributing an\nartist\u2019s work (Kim Dotcom, Mediafire, Megavideo, Mp3tunes,) they should share\nsome of their proceeds with the artists. At this point the Digerati then\nproceed to call us \u201cdinosaurs\u201d, \u201cknow nothings\u201d or worse. Suddenly your\nFacebook page is filled with angry comments from their followers that seem to\nall be unsuccessful Canadian hip hop artists who proclaim:\n\n\u201cWe are gonna turn you into Lars Ulrich and bitch your band sucks anyway\u201d.\n\n(At the risk of getting the Canadian non-lethal equivalent of a \u201ccap in my\nass\u201d I have to say: I am so scared!)\n\nThe most virulent of these folks are almost always unsuccessful musicians. It\nfascinates me. I can only surmise that part of their anger seems tied to the\nhatred of the record companies that rejected them. Successful even marginally\nsuccessful musicians are often viewed as some kind of traitors. A special kind\nof hatred is reserved for these apostates. The file sharing/ cyber locker\nindustry has figured this out and purposely stokes stokes them with a faux\npopulism. I would say it\u2019s juvenile but it\u2019s really more medieval. That\u2019s why\nI call them Freehadists. People like me are actually looking out for these\nyoung musician\u2019s rights. I am trying to keep the new boss from screwing them.\nThey dont\u2019 realize they are doing the work of The Man. But I digress.\n\nDespite the tech lobby\u2019s portrayal of musician as luddites or doddering old\nhippie, musicians, especially independent musicians are often the early\nadopters of technology. We are always a couple years ahead of the \u201cstraight\u201d\nbusiness world when it comes to technology. As an example we perfected \u201csocial\nmarketing\u201d before it even had a name. We were outsourcing and insourcing\nservices for our highly flexible virtual companies when Windows 3.0 was state\nof the art.\n\nWhen it comes to the web, we not only understand the consumer side of the\nInternet we understand the producer/supplier side as well. And like any\nproducer or supplier we want to be compensated. The reason the Digerati are so\nfixated on \u201cwhat the consumer wants\u201d is simply because most of them have only\nexperienced the web as consumers.\n\n\u201cThe consumer wants music to be free\u201d they shout as they pound their tiny\nfists on their Skovby tables.\n\nThe consumer also wants cars to be free. And beer. Especially beer. But any\nmarket involves a buyer and a seller. A consumer and a producer. If GM can\u2019t\nafford to give away their product for free it ain\u2019t gonna happen. No matter\nwhat the consumer wants. (See my note on \u201cdigeridiots\u201d)\n\nOften overlooked by Digerati, is the glaringly obvious fact that musicians and\nbands have long been a part of the new economy. We\u2019ve been a web-enabled\nbusiness since 1992. We\u2019ve been a web-based business since Napster. Virtually\nevery interaction that an artist and a fan have is web based. Even live\nconcerts are web-enabled. The artist and the fan communicate about the\nupcoming concert through Twitter, Facebook events or traditional email.\nRecording has long been web enabled. We might all get together in the same\nspot to record basic tracks, but oftentimes overdubs and even mixing happens\nremotely, exchanging files and notes via the web.\n\nSo please forgive us if we roll our eyes at the Digerati who tell us we need\nto \u201cembrace the web\u201d, \u201cwork the new digital ecosystem\u201d or come up with a \u201cnew\nmodel\u201d. It\u2019s a little like your great aunt seeing you at thanksgiving dinner\nand telling you something like:\n\n\u201cYou should make some T-shirts for your band and sell them on tour\u201d.\n\nYou politely smile and try not to roll your eyes.\n\nActually that\u2019s the number one \u201cnew model\u201d that the Digerati suggest. Sell\nT-shirts at your shows to make money! This despite the fact it\u2019s not new.\nBands have been selling t-shirts at live shows since the early 1970s.\nRecording albums to sell a few t-shirts is a terrible way to make money.\nThanks for the advice but no thanks. Plus t-shirts are just as bootlegable as\nmusic.\n\n\u201cInformation wants to be free. Information also wants to be expensive\u201d-Stewart\nBrand\n\nEveryone knows there a second half to his quote? Right? Cause I usually only\nsee the first sentence bandied about in technology circles.\n\nSound recordings are information. Sound recordings are not cheap to make. The\ntechnology is not the expensive part of making songs and sound recordings. It\nhasn\u2019t been since the late 1980s. Many in the tech community blindly assume\nthat recording budgets have gone down because the technology is less expensive\nand provides greater productivity. With absolutely no facts to back up their\nargument I often hear:\n\n\u201cWell artists are making less money but recording costs are lower, so the\nartists are doing okay\u201d.\n\nIn other words technology has lowered your revenues in the form of unlicensed\nfile-sharing on an industrial scale but that\u2019s okay because Digidesign (the\nmakers of Pro-ToolsTM) has given back some cost savings. As if Kim Dotcom and\nDigidesign share the same bank account. These people believe in technology\nlike it is a religion. The lord Technology Industry taketh, and The Lord\nTechnology Industry giveth back.\n\nThe data I have from recording studios says something different. Recording\nbudgets are lower because artists spend dramatically less time recording. They\njust don\u2019t have the money.\n\nRecording budgets didn\u2019t start shrinking until after the advent of file-\nsharing. 2002 ish. While most of the improvements in technology and gains in\nproductivity occurred in the early 1990s. By 1996 the home studio/pro studio\nproduction chain was firmly in place. Pro studios used for \u201ctracking\u201d and\n\u201cmixing.\u201d Home or project studios used for overdubs and editing. If lower\nrecording budgets were caused by improvements in technology they should have\nstarted shrinking 10 years earlier.\n\nSound recordings are very labor intensive. If you want to make good ones you\nare relying on highly skilled labor. The cost of sound recordings is largely\ndependent on labor costs. Technological advances have little effect on\nrecording cost.\n\nThis is the main problem with the technologists contention recordings should\nbe free. They seem to think that the only people who work on recordings are\nthe touring performers themselves. Artists still have to pay for that highly\nskilled labor.\n\nIs the mix engineer gonna follow us around on tour hawking HIS T-shirts to the\naudience?\n\nSLIDE 3\n\nFreemiumnistas Of The World Unite!\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019m what you might call a \u201cFreemiumnista\u201d. I was a Freemiumnista\nbefore there was an Internet. I get that not all interactions between fans and\nartists should be monetized. I get that you can give away something and make\nmore money in the long run. Virtually every live show we\u2019ve ever played is\navailable free on archive.org. Even before the internet we\u2019ve encouraged and\norganized tape trees and later CD burn trees for distributing our live shows\nAnd we spend a lot of time trying to get people to buy our studio albums as\nwell.\n\nUnlike a lot of the Digerati I have walked the walk. I still do.\n\nI\u2019ve embraced many of the things that those on the tech side of the music\nbusiness want musicians to embrace. But what many of you forget is that IT IS\nMY CHOICE whether I choose to give away my songs or sell them. IT IS MY CHOICE\nhow and where to distribute my songs. IT IS MY CHOICE to decide which websites\nget to exploit my songs. Like it or not, the right to control one\u2019s\nintellectual property (like songs) is a constitutional right. It is also part\nof every international human rights agreement. Technology company funded blogs\nthat think there should be no song copyrights are actually advocating\nviolating my constitutional and human rights!\n\nMany in the digital music industry rightfully condemn the past exploitation of\nartists by record labels. But at the same time they seem to be doing the same\nthing. Trying to bully artists into giving up their rights so that companies\nlike MegaUpload or YouTube can make money is the same thing.\n\nWith exploitative record contracts The Old Boss tried to take your songs a\ndozen at a time and pay you pennies. The New Boss wants to take ALL of your\nsongs, past present and future and pay you nothing.\n\nI\u2019ll make technologists a deal, I\u2019ll give up my song copyrights if you give up\nyour software patents. Software patents are even less unique than your typical\nsong. So this should be easy right?\n\nTalk the Talk. Walk the Walk.\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/15/google-motorola-\nmobility_n_927670.html\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/12/yahoo-sues-facebook-\npatent_n_1340032.html\n\nslide 4\n\nBullshit Hippy Capitalism.\n\nWhen Napster and P2P came along honestly I wasn\u2019t pleased. At best I was\nambivalent. I thought that we\u2019d lose sales to large scale sharing but through\nmore efficient distribution systems and disintermediation we artists would net\nmore. So like many other artists I embraced the new paradigm and waited for\nthe flow of revenue to the artists to increase. It never did. In fact\neverywhere I look the trend seemed to be negative. Less money for touring.\nLess money for recording. Less money for promotion and publicity. The old days\nof the evil record labels started to seem less bad. It started to seem\ndownright rosy.\n\nSo this talk I\u2019m giving grew out of this bit of hyperbole:\n\nWas the old record label system better?\n\nI mean it didn\u2019t seem like the artists were literally starving and living in\ntheir vans like now? I mean even the independent bands seemed able to stay in\na hotel every once in a while and being a \u201cFreegan\u201d was a lifestyle choice,\nnot a necessity.\n\nSadly I think the answer turns out to be yes. Things are worse. This was not\nreally what I was expecting. I\u2019d be very happy to be proved wrong. I mean it\u2019s\nhard for me to sing the praises of the major labels. I\u2019ve been in legal\ndisputes with two of the three remaining major labels. But sadly I think I\u2019m\nright. And the reason is quite unexpected. It\u2019s seems the Bad Old Major Record\nLabels \u201caccidentally\u201d shared too much revenue and capital through their system\nof advances. Also the labels \u201caccidentally\u201d assumed most of the risk. This is\ncontrasted with the new digital distribution system where some of the biggest\nplayers assume almost no risk and share zero capital.\n\nI can see Russia from my house. No really I can.\n\nTo be clear, when I\u2019m talking about how things are now, I\u2019m not talking about\nmy band and my friend\u2019s bands. I\u2019ve owned a studio complex for 18 years. We\u2019ve\nrecorded everything from hobbyists to Lamb of God. High school punk rockers to\noctogenarian blues singers. My wife is a concert promoter of some note. She\nprobably books over 300 artists a year. We share an office and from where I\nwrite this, I feel like I have a comprehensive view of the music scene in the\nSoutheastern US, if not the entire United States. We live in a city that has\none of the highest concentrations of musicians outside of Nashville and\nAustin.\n\nI generally know what artists are grossing I also have a pretty good idea of\nwhat they are netting. If a 4 piece band shows up at the 40 watt club with 2\ncrew members, beat up old van and they sell 200 tickets? They are probably\nmaking about 150 bucks a day each. If a band shows up at my wife\u2019s Atlanta\ntheatre with 2 buses, a truck 10 crew members and an 8 piece band? Well I can\ntell you they need to sell it out or they (or the promoter) are losing money.\nLikewise having detailed knowledge of different artists recording budgets and\nschedules through my studios tells me a lot about how much these artists are\nexpecting to make from sales and touring.\n\nArtists have seen their most important assets collectivized by file-sharing.\nThey no long control the distribution and exploitation of these assets. If\nthis were happening to practically any other group of Americans there would be\nmass outrage and civil unrest. Other than Ted Nugent and John Popper most\nmusicians are not heavily armed. Hence the lack of armed standoffs.\n\nWithout the ability to effectively and fairly exploit their sound recordings\nthe vast middle and lower class, the 99% of the music business has been\nimpoverished.\n\n* There have been a couple serious arguments that if artists received 0.3 \u2013 0.9 cents a song each stream this would be a \u201csustainable\u201d amount. \u201cAll you can eat streaming\u201d services would be able to charge a reasonable rate to the consumer and it would stabilize recorded music revenues or even lift them a little. Also the Spotify question deserves it\u2019s own post cause I\u2019m not sure if artists getting too little money is necessarily Spotify\u2019s fault.\n\nSpock.\n\nSo this is the data I am looking at. It\u2019s all aggregate and most of it is hard\ndata. Those who argue things are better for the artist now usually cite\nanecdotal cases as evidence, cook the books by excluding data or simply argue\nthat there is no conclusive evidence file sharing has had any effect on\nrecorded music revenues. In other words it\u2019s an unproven theory like global\nwarming, evolution and the roundness of the earth. It\u2019s just a coincidence\nrecorded music revenues dropped 64% since the advent of file sharing.\n\nI think the recording studio data is really important. This is an expense that\nis common to the independent artist and the label artist (label artists pay\nfor recording out of \u201ctheir\u201d advance money). Further they can roll in revenue\nfrom live performance and other sources into the recording budgets. So you get\nan expression of the artists entire revenue outlook when you look at the\nrecording process. The fact that artists are spending much less TIME recording\ncan only mean they have less money or expect to make less money. When hundreds\nof artists of all kinds do this simultaneously it\u2019s hard to argue that artists\nare making more money.\n\nImproved technology is not the explanation. Technology may have produced some\nproductivity gains, but not in the time consuming tasks of getting sounds,\ncomposition and arrangement. Many people who haven\u2019t worked in a studio don\u2019t\nrealize how long it takes just to position microphones and instruments in a\nroom to capture the sounds right. And every drumset, studio, microphone piano,\nguitar amp and player is a little different. There are no shortcuts.\n\nNo matter how good the recording engineer, he/she can\u2019t make the drummer\nfigure out the right beat for the song, what words the singer should sing or\nthe melody of the guitar solo. No, the only explanation for why artists are\nspending much less time recording is the obvious one. Occam\u2019s razor. Every\nother explanation adds assumptions.\n\nI\u2019m With Stupid.\n\n\u201cBut wait a minute, I keep reading stuff on the internet that says artists are\ndoing much better now? Why do so many people think artists are doing better?\u201d\n\nLet me give you an amusing answer and a serious answer.\n\nThe internet is making us stupider. You can make a strong mathematical\nargument to this effect. The internet is an entertainment medium. It\npropagates what is entertaining. The internet does a much better job of\npropagating the wacko-tin-foil-hat way-out-in- the-long-tail untruths than it\ndoes propagating the sober accepted scientific facts that live in the head of\nthe curve.\n\nWacko-tin-foil-hat is way more entertaining especially if it claims to be\ntrue. I\u2019m not knocking it cause the entire Camper Van Beethoven oeuvre is\nbased on these kinds of untruths. It\u2019s much more exciting to believe that\nglobal warming is a hoax, Obama is a secret Muslim born in Kenya or the RIAA\nis throwing old ladies in jail for singing happy birthday to their\ngrandchildren in YouTube videos.\n\nHere is a chart that a well intention but hopelessly un-informed friend shared\non my facebook page.\n\nIf you look at the chart. It is wildly non factual. Yet it\u2019s been shared over\n5 thousand times. How many hundreds of thousands of people have absorbed this\nas fact!\n\nIt includes percentages of revenue from record sales going to the agent.\nAgents only charge fees on live performance.\n\nFormer record label (?!)\n\nThe studio. Usually paid a flat fee not a percentage of sales.\n\nThe manager slice is too large. 15%-20% of net on recorded music not gross as\nrepresented here.\n\nBut all you really need to know is that it appears this chart was created by a\nbass player. There is only one bass player joke:\n\n\u201cWhat do bass players use for birth control?\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir personalities.\u201d\n\nThe general consensus in the music business is that The Bass Player is the\nmost aggrieved and dissatisfied member of any ensemble. I have many good\nfriends that are bass players and even they will admit there is some truth to\nthis stereotype.\n\nIn actuality a much higher share of revenue goes to most artists under a\ntypical record deal. In the 1990\u2018s typical deals were 15-25% of wholesale. I\u2019m\ntold some superstars got as much as 50%. Add another 70-95 cents for mandatory\nand statutory \u201cmechanical royalties\u201d. And your \u201ctypical\u2019 artist was getting\nmore than 25% of wholesale on physical CDs.\n\nFurther mechanical royalties are paid regardless of whether a record is\nrecouped or not. So \u201cdownloading a free album\u201d almost always takes 70-95 cents\nout of the artists pocket, EVEN IF THE ARTIST IS UNRECOUPED!\n\nThis negative view of record deals is the result of what I call \u201cthe whiner\nbias.\u201d You only hear about the \u201cbad\u201d record deals. And believe me there were\nbad deals out there! but most weren\u2019t. But what artist is gonna go out and say\n\u201cMan my record label is paying me so much money it\u2019s amazingly fair!!\u201d\n\nAlso people often confuse artistic conflicts with monetary conflicts. Record\nlabels definitely sought to control artists creatively. But as Morrissey notes\n\n\u201cyou could have said no, if you wanted to, you could have said no\u201d\n\nI remember being told to dress in powdered wigs and 18th century clothing for\na video. I said no.\n\nThen there is the matter that most record deals end badly. Record deals end\nwhen the artist is no longer selling enough albums to justify the deal. The\nartist is then dropped which leads to a very public falling out. In fact see\nmy song about Virgin Records \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Gonna Suck Itself\u201d.\n\nThe more serious reason that people think artists are doing much better post\nnapster? There has been a concerted effort by a certain part of the tech\nblogosphere to paint a rosy picture of the music industry. They have two\ntechniques:\n\nTotally misleading fake studies. Like the Computer and Communications Industry\nAssociation\u2019s \u201cThe Sky is Rising\u201d Report. First off this was passed around as\nindependent research when it was actually industry lobby generated propaganda.\nAmong the most outrageous obfuscations and bizarre metrics: Including gaming\nrevenue to help disguise recorded music revenue decline, Not mentioning the\ndrop in live music revenues in North America, and creating the bizarre metric\nof \u201cnumber of recorded music transactions\u201d instead of using recorded music\nrevenues. Recorded music transactions are up because people buy individual\ntracks now instead of 1 album of 10 songs. Get it?\n\nThere are 14 academic peer reviewed studies that paint quite a different\npicture. Yet you rarely see these quoted by the digerati.\n\nAnecdotal Examples. Things like Ok Go. Yep that\u2019s a success story. Louis CK\nYep success story. But here\u2019s the thing: the music business is like the casino\nbusiness. You can\u2019t look at one or two players winnings and tell how the\ncasino or ALL the other players are doing. And like a casino the house lets a\nfew people win but overall the game is rigged.\n\nThe Future of Music Coalition or as I like to call them the Fooling our\nMusicians Coalition seems to be the new innovator in this field. Their recent\n\u201ccase studies\u201d seem to be taking it to the next level. They appear to have\ncombined misleadingly titled studies with meaningless anecdotal information.\n\nExample 1.\n\nAre Musicians benefiting from Music Tech?\n\nhttp://money.futureofmusic.org/are-musicians-benefiting-from-music-tech-sf-\nmusictech-presentation/\n\nTheir conclusion is a resounding yes!\n\nBut dig into the paper and you find that by \u201cbenefiting\u201d they mean things like\n\u201cbeing able to keep in touch with fans through Twitter\u201d and being able to use\n.Zip files. While the .Zip file was a real game changer for musicians,\nespecially banjo players, most people reading the headline and not reading the\narticle would think they were addressing a much more important question:\n\n\u201cDespite the loss of revenue to file sharing has technology allowed the\nartists to make up the loss of revenue in other ways?.\u201d\n\nWe all know that Twitter allows us to talk to our fans already. This has been\nestablished. Why did FOMC need to do a study on this? Anytime I read something\nput out by the FOMC I find myself asking \u201cwhat exactly was the point of that?\u201d\n\nExample 2.\n\nhttp://money.futureofmusic.org/case-study-a/\n\nTheir \u201ccase study\u201d of the veteran 13 year indie rock musician composer showed\nthis particular artist had increasing revenues 2008-2011 (why not 1999-2011\nsince the artist\u2019s professional career began in 1999?) However the artists\nidentity was not revealed and FOMC refused to release raw data. Further they\nrefused to publish actual total dollars. Instead they only published relative\npercentages of revenues and expenses. When pressed on these matters on Digital\nMusic News blog, The FOMC study director refused citing \u201cprivacy concerns\u201d.\nWho\u2019s privacy concerns?\n\nAnd right here is where my tech industry friends will start to hate me.\n\nI call bullshit. I don\u2019t think the FOMC wanted to release the raw data because\nas clever bloggers deduced it appears this 13 year veteran artist netted less\nthan 34 thousand dollars in his/her best year! (they interpolated this from\nthe percentage assigned to AF of M dues). \u201cFamous indie rocker only makes 34k\na year !\u201d was not a headline they wanted to see in relation to the study.\n\nWhy would self proclaimed artist advocates publish such a study?\n\nI don\u2019t really know. But the FOMC is relentlessly praising technology and the\ntechnology industry. Fawning might be more accurate. In fact they spend way\nmore time talking about technology issues than they do issues of interest to\nmusicians. Just look at their blog. It\u2019s as if there were an organization\ncalled \u201cFriends of Mary Todd Lincoln\u201d but all they did was talk about the\ntheatre.\n\n\u201cCreators must be able to maximize value from their copyrights in a legitimate\ndigital marketplace. We understand the very real problem of intellectual\nproperty infringement and its impact on the music ecosystem. We also share the\nconvictions of those who depend on the internet in practically every aspect of\ntheir lives and careers that free expression and entrepreneurship are too\nimportant to be undermined by overly-broad policy.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with our many friends in the music and arts\ncommunities, as well as those in the innovation sector to find ways to achieve\nstronger protections for artists while preserving the dynamics of innovation\nand expression that are the engines of the internet.\u201d\u2013Casey Rae Hunter Dept\nDirector Future of Music Coalition. Statement on Intellectual Property Bills\n\u201cReset\u201d.\n\n\u201cFree expression\u201d and \u201cInnovation\u201d are tech speak for being able to use\nartists songs, sound recordings, films, photos and books without having to\nlicense or share any revenue.\n\nAnd step back for a second. Look at the absurdity of this statement. How the\nfuck are indie artists making 34k a year, how the fuck are these artists\nslowing down and preventing Google and other billion dollar companies from\ninnovating?\n\nAnd why am I pointing this out instead of an organization that claims to\nrepresent artists in the digital world?\n\nMaybe if the \u201cInnovation Sector\u201d spent a little less time \u201cinnovating\u201d novel\nlegal arbitrages, trying to intimidate struggling indie film makers by posting\nher DMCA takedown notices on the appropriately named www.chillingeffects.org\nor wasting shareholder dollars building driverless cars they wouldn\u2019t need the\nsubsidy that the unlicensed use of our music is providing them. But I digress.\n\nAnd referring to the tech industry as \u201cThe Innovation Sector\u201d? I mean is it\npossible to be more of a bootlicker? This is why I\u2019ve started calling FOMC The\nFooling our Musicians Coaliton. Helping musicians does not seem to be at the\ntop of their agenda.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nSlides 6 and 7\n\nWhite Riot.\n\nIf we\u2019re gonna have a dialogue we need to be honest. Right? So Let\u2019s be\nhonest. The fact that many in the tech community keep saying \u201cartists and\nrecord labels need to find a new model\u201d is an admission that the current\ndigital status quo doesn\u2019t work. Right? Not for the artist anyway. As I\u2019ll\nexplain it actually makes a lot of money for a lot of companies.\n\nI ran into Bob Weir at the SF Music Tech Summit. He asked what I\u2019d spoke\nabout. I briefly explained that I had a critique of the new digital model\ncause my data shows that little revenue is flowing to the artists. He replied\n\u201cI know we got to make it so artists can make a living\u201d. Now this is\nsignificant because I assume Bob was there with his longtime songwriting\npartner Electronic Frontier Foundation Co-Founder John Perry Barlow. Barlow\nwas probably busy pounding the table downstairs shouting \u201cIntellectual\nProperty is not Property\u201d as he is wont to do. Now I must point out that this\nis quite a radical position for any American to take. The very success of our\nnation has been built on IP. Silicon Valley is built on IP. Does Barlow give\naway his royalties from all those Grateful Dead songs he wrote? But I digress.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFirst I need to point out that THERE IS a stable digital music distribution\nmodel. We are not still trying to invent it. It\u2019s been here for at least 10\nyears and has been relatively stable for the last six. It has three legs:\n\nFile sharing/Cyber Lockers. MegaUpload, FirstLoad, Pirate Bay, Bittorrent etc\netc\n\nStreaming type services. Pandora, Spotify, YouTube, Grooveshark, etc.\n\nDigital Music Stores. iTunes, Amazon Mp3, Rhapsody, Google Play etc\n\nThis digital distribution model is firmly entrenched with all of the\n\u201cdistributors\u201d revenue models firmly in place and with the exception of\nstreaming, solidly profitable.\n\nFile Sharing.\n\n(Thanks to Ellen Seidler for enlightening me on much of this)\n\nUnlicensed File-sharing sites make money off advertising and upgrades that\nallow faster downloads of unlicensed materials. As demonstrated in the video\n\u201cPop up Pirates\u201d Google and other web advertising companies make money placing\nads on these sites as well as making money from people searching for things\nlike \u201cdownload we are young fun.\u201d Let me quickly demonstrate.\n\nNow note the first two sites are unlicensed. The artist\u2019s own site is #3.\niTunes is #4. There is lot\u2019s of data on how important it is to be the the\nfirst or second link in search results. This is when the the Digerati suddenly\nbecome ignorant of consumer behavior on the web.\n\n\u201cNah....you really think unlicensed file sharing has any effect on legal\nsales?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s click on the Mp3skull link.\n\nAs you can see Mp3skull.com is making money from that Hertz ad. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s\nnot much per view but considering this is the #1 song in the country I\u2019m sure\nit adds up. And the web advertising company that placed it there is also\nmaking money (google?). These are not small companies. And some of these file\nsharing companies are making big money. Kim Dotcom and MegaUpload anyone?\n\nNow an artist or record label can request that google take these links down.\nYou file a DMCA takedown notice. I sometimes do this. Usually only if an\nadvance copy has leaked and my album is not commercially available yet. But\nlook what happens when you file a DMCA takedown notice with google.\n\nFirst redo search this time for a 50 Cent track.\n\nScroll down a bit and you will find that google has included these strange\nnotices.\n\nIn response to a complaint we received under the US Digital Millennium\nCopyright Act, we have removed 1 result(s) from this page. If you wish you may\nread the DMCA complaint that caused the removal(s) at ChillingEffects.org\n\nGoogle removes the links. It\u2019s required to do this by law. But the next part\nis not required by law.\n\nGoogle has chosen to proclaim it has removed this link, and it provides you\nwith a link to the complaint on the (ironically named) Chillingeffects.org.\nBut if you click on \u201cread the DMCA complaint\u201d you are taken to\nwww.chillingeffects.org where you get to see the actual complaint. But more\nimportantly you get to see the offending links. The unlicensed download link\nyou wanted is just one extra click away.\n\nCopy and paste the link into your browser and you can download the file. So\nreally nothing has been accomplished. I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019m the first one to\ndiscover this.\n\n(I can\u2019t find a DMCA agent for Chillingeffects.org. If they happen to not have\none aren\u2019t they liable for posting these links under DMCA? anybody?)\n\nThis is why Google is the giant of the \u201cInnovation Industry\u201d here is one of\nthe most beautifully executed legal kludges I\u2019ve ever seen. Google date rapes\nthe spirit of the law while keeping to the letter.\n\nThe new boss thinks we\u2019re stupid.\n\nApparently they are partially right because Stanford, UC Berkeley, Harvard,\nUniversity of San Francisco, George Washington School of Law, Santa Clara\nUniversity of Law and (inexplicably) The University of Maine are all listed as\nsponsors of this website.\n\nThis is from the home page of www.chillingeffects.org\n\nMonitoring the legal climate for internet activity.\n\nA joint project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Harvard, Stanford,\nBerkeley, University of San Francisco, University of Maine, George Washington\nSchool of Law, and Santa Clara University School of Law clinics.\n\nThere is a bunch of mumbo jumbo on this site about how it\u2019s supposed to help\nindividuals navigate through the DMCA legal thicket. They claim the idea is to\ncombat the Chilling Effects of DMCA on free speech. This is all fine and dandy\nif the typical individual needing help was some poor innocent teenager who\ndidn\u2019t know it was not legal to share long clips of Hugo on her movie review\nblog.\n\nBut dig into the site. Almost all the activity is Twitter or Google publishing\nthe DMCA takedown notices they receive. Because you must list your legal name\nand address on these DMCA notices I believe these are published to\nspecifically intimidate those who ask for links to be removed. I mean I\ncertainly think twice before I file one of these notices with Google\nspecifically because there is a good chance Google will put me this on this\nsite.\n\nGood job university eggheads! Congrats on making it easier for the rich,\npowerful and unaccountable to intimidate the little guy!\n\nIf anyone reading this is an alumni of one of these fine institutions I\nsuggest you do as I did and write the President or Dean and ask if they are\naware that Google is using them as a fig leaf for a dubious legal workaround?\nFurther the site is actually working to chill free speech.\n\nFile-sharing: So how much does this part of the digital ecosystem share with\nartists?\n\nZERO. NADA. ZILCH.\n\nOld Boss: pays the artist too little.\n\nNew Boss: pays the artist nothing.\n\nSo this part of the new digital ecosystem is clearly worse than the old\nsystem. Plus at least one player profiting from this system seems to be trying\nto intimidate the artists into not exercising their rights.\n\nStreaming\n\nWhen I refer to streaming I include not only Spotify, Pandora and other\nsimilar services. I also include YouTube. Virtually every song i\u2019ve ever\nwritten is streamable on YouTube. Even if it\u2019s just a static shot of the cover\nand the audio uploaded by some well meaning fan.\n\nPandora pays the artists according to statutory rates. Personally I\u2019m happy\nthat Spotify is attempting to pay artists, even if it\u2019s not really enough yet.\nYouTube wouldn\u2019t pay anything if it didn\u2019t have to. So they don\u2019t get my\nthanks. And Grooveshark pays nothing to artist.\n\nFirst thing you need to know about streaming? Aside from Pandora there is a\nhuge dispute about how much any of these services pay. And unfortunately I\nwon\u2019t be able to clear it up much.\n\nI have friends, artists and record label execs who swear they or their artists\nare receiving about .3 to .6 cents a spin from Spotify (a rate some regard as\n\u201csustainable\u201dand equitable). Others swear that\u2019s not true, more like\nhundredths or thousandths of a penny.\n\nI\u2019ve looked at royalty statements from various artists. Both groups appear to\nbe right!\n\nI\u2019ll just add my voice to the call for transparency in Spotify and all\nstreaming licensing. It\u2019s never good when there is no transparency. It\ninevitably part of some scheme to take advantage of someone somewhere. Usually\nthe artist. Or to quote P.J. O\u2019Rourke \u201cComplexity IS fraud\u201d.\n\nRegardless in the last few months a lot of artists have come out with their\npersonal stories on how their revenues from streaming are quite small. Here is\na typical story from Benji Rogers who also runs Pledge Music.\n\nhttp://www.pledgemusic.com/blog/52-so-wheres-it-all-going-digital-sales-for-\nthe-independent-musician\n\nThe Black Keys really don\u2019t like spotify.\n\nhttp://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/black-keys-drummer-\npatrick-carney-calls-1006579552.story\n\nSo clearly a lot of artists feel they aren\u2019t being adequately compensated.\n\nWhen pressed on this Spotify seem\u2019s to point the finger at the record labels.\nAnd the record labels point back at Spotify. And curiously UMG seems to defend\nSpotify more than the other labels. No one knows what deal UMG cut with\nSpotify but clearly they have some sort of stake in Spotify. How this effects\nrevenue flowing to artists is unknown. UMG needs to clarify.\n\nSo for now let\u2019s just say artists share of revenue from spotify and other\nstreaming services is:\n\nUnknown and subject to possibly shady deals.\n\nSounds just like the old boss right?\n\nThe White Hats.\n\nFinally what about the \u2018white hats in the digital music ecosystem? By this I\nmean the legitimate digital music stores like iTunes, Amazon\u2019s MP3 store,\nRhapsody, eMusic and Google\u2019s Play. I call them white hats because this seems\nto be the only part of the digital music ecosystem which has consistently paid\nartists. Still if you dig into how the money gets split you start to encounter\nproblems when you compare it to the old record label system.All the big stores\ntake about 30% of gross on a 99 cent song. But here is the catch. If you are\nan independent artist you have to go through an \u201caggregator\u201d to get your songs\ninto iTunes/Amazon. This will cost you a minimum of 9%. Except Google. Google\nshould be commended for not requiring the aggregator for their store. However\niTunes represents about 70% of the digital music market. Amazon is a distant\nsecond (13%?). I could find no data on Google\u2019s store now called Play.\n\nSo for now lets just focus on iTunes. The genius of Steve Jobs was that he was\nnot afraid to be greedy. Like most Apple products, Steve Jobs built the thing\nhe wanted and picked the price and margin he wanted. This is commendable in a\nCEO. That\u2019s why I own Apple stock. I doubt there were any consumer studies. He\ndidn\u2019t really negotiate with the suppliers and consumers on price. A kind of\ntake it or leave it proposition. Fortunately it paid off for Apple.Now when\nyou are building a brand new digital music store, a concept no one else has\never really done on a large scale there is considerable risk. So in 2003 (when\niTunes store launched) a 30% margin is totally justified. Nearly a decade\nlater after the concept is proven, after the store has brought millions of new\nconsumers into the apple ecosystem and after billions of dollars of hardware\nhave been sold is 30% a reasonable margin? It\u2019s no longer a risky proposition.\nI say no. My techie friends immediately point out that all those servers, all\nthose engineers and all that software is really really expensive.\n\nOk... then this is another example of the failure of theory of Disruptive\nInnovation? So John Dvorak is right when he calls Disruptive Innovation the\nbiggest crock of the millenium? Disruptive innovations are supposed to be much\nmuch cheaper than what they \u201cdisrupted\u201d. So if the mom and pop record stores\ncould sell physical product profitably on a 40% margin with all that shipping,\nreturns, breakage shrinkage, real estate and stoned employees AND big chains\nlike best buy and walmart with their deep discounts could sell music on a 20%\nmargin, then the only conclusion is that the iTunes store is incredibly\nwasteful and inefficient way to do business. I don\u2019t think that is the case. I\nthink that selling music as mp3 downloads from Apple/Amazon servers has to be\nmore efficient than shipping thousands of breakable CDs all over the world. So\nI think what has happened is that over the years that 30% margin has become\nparasitic. Parasitic in an economic sense meaning it\u2019s not really justified by\nthe value it\u2019s adding. The 30% is simply the result of iTunes/Amazon being\nmore of a bottleneck or gatekeeper. The fact that sites like\nhttp://www.bandcamp.com and http://www.cdbaby.com can do the same job on a\nlower margin suggests that the 30% is artificially high. I know the Apple-can-\ndo-no-wrong crowd is sharping their knives right now. But hear me out. If the\nmarket lets Apple take 30% they should take 30%. The part of me that is an\nApple shareholder applauds this action. And Apple should continue to charge\nthis margin until it is forced to lower it by it\u2019s suppliers or\ncompetitors.Until apple really has some reasonable competition, until the\nmusic conglomerates figure out it\u2019s in their interest to license new online\nstores, create other competitors cheaply and efficiently, iTunes is not gonna\nhave any competition. And as iTunes sales grow and physical sales shrink,\nApple\u2019s market share is only gonna get bigger. Apple will become more powerful\nand behave more like a monopoly. If iTunes recorded music store were it\u2019s own\nseparate company it\u2019s gross revenues would represent over 30% of the market.\nIt would be the biggest recorded music company by revenue except UMG. Apple is\nthe most valuable company in the world. In a way you can argue that Apple IS\nThe Man 2.0.But unlike UMG , WMG or Sony, Apple (or any of the digital music\nstores) does not recycle any of their revenues back into the creation and\ndevelopment of artists and songs. And this is part of the problem.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWhat percentage of revenue from digital sales goes to an artist on a record\nlabel?\n\nThis is a long and fairly complicated calculation and I\u2019ll save the details\nfor my book . But the percentage of revenue that goes to artists on a label is\nabout the same as under the old record label model. It may be slightly better\nbecause there have been some improvements from the artists perspective. For\ninstance the old record company scam known as \u201cfree goods\u201d is impossible to\njustify with digital downloads.Under the new digital model I calculate that\nmost label artists get between 15%- 35% of wholesale. For example the most\nrecent of my recording contracts says I should get a total of 20.5 cents on a\n99 cent song (including mechanical royalties). This works out to 29.7% of\nwholesale. So this part of the new digital paradigm is about the same as the\nold record label system.\n\nSo when you compare share of revenue for artists on record labels under the\nnew digital system to the old system it looks pretty good. At least until you\nconsider the fact that the price of music has dropped. For instance, an\nartists royalty on an album is now calculated at 6.90 not at a $10.00\nwholesale price as it was in the 1980s. . This drop in the price of music was\ninevitable. But the record label\u2019s expenses fell considerably in the switch\nfrom physical to digital products whereas the artist\u2019s expenses (the recording\nbudgets) did not. So this had the effect of reducing artists net revenues and\nshifting revenue towards the record labels. For the new digital distribution\nmodel to be as \u201cfair\u201d to the artist, the artist share of download revenue\nshould have increased. It stayed the same or increased only marginally.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at this in real dollars. Let\u2019s take my artist royalty rate of\n16% and compare who gets what under the old pre digital system and the new\nsystem. (don\u2019t forget i\u2019m also including the mechanical royalty).\n\nLooked at this way I think you can see the problem. Artists revenue falls but\nthe artist still needs to pay for recording. Record label revenue falls but\nthe new digital distribution system provides them enormous savings. They have\neliminated manufacturing warehousing and shipping costs.\n\nAnd then there is that iTunes store 30%. Seems kind of high to me. What is\ntheir risk? Today in 2012? Do they really deserve more per album than the\nartist? At least the record labels put up capital to record albums. At least\nthe record labels provide the artist with valuable promotion and publicity.\nHistorically in the music business when someone was taking more than 20% of\ngross revenues that had some \u201cskin in the game\u201d. They risked losing a lot of\nmoney.\n\nBetween the record labels and the digital retailers like iTunes, once again\nthe artist gets squeezed. If you add to this the cannibalization of sales from\nstreaming sources that pay too little and illegal file-sharing that pays\nnothing at all you can see why the artists have much less money now. This also\nhelps explain why artists are spending dramatically less time and money\nrecording.\n\nThe New Boss, in this case Apple, takes 30 percent, takes no risk and provides\nthe artist with almost nothing in return.\n\nAlways look for that Union Label.\n\nIn the late 80\u2019s through the late 90\u2019s the Music Business experienced a boom.\nNot as big as some have reported. When adjusted for inflation and population\nonly 13% higher than the previous peak in the 1970s. Nevertheless it was a\nboom. It\u2019s instructive to look at what the record labels did with their\nprofits when it was flush with cash. They created what I like to call \u201cThe\nGrunge Bubble\u201d. Record labels bid up the advances for new artists to unheard\nof levels. Unknown rock bands were getting signing bonuses of $750,000\ndollars!\n\nThe record labels flush with cash not only dumped a lot of money into signing\nartists directly, they also gave money to other people, veteran artists for\ninstance, myself included, to start our own sub-labels. Then the sub labels\nwent out and gave that money to other artists as well. This was a really good\ntime to be an artist.\n\nBut here is the important point. Record labels value content and content\ncreators. Sure they kept a lot of money for their executives (although even\nmid 90\u2019s music executive pay is dwarfed by tech executive pay.) But record\nlabels unlike tech companies, know they built their businesses on those who\ncreate content. Therefore when they were flush with cash they set out to buy\nthe services of as many artists as they could. This had the effect of sharing\nthe wealth with musicians. It may have been uneven it may have been wasteful,\nit may have not touched every artists and the labels may have pocketed most of\nthe revenue but at least they felt they needed to give something back to the\ncontent creators. They knew artists created something of value.\n\nFor a very long period of time record labels provided a decent living to\nthousands of lucky artists. They may not have guaranteed an artist riches but\nIt was like having one of those good union manufacturing jobs. In fact you\ncould have your royalties paid to you in such a way that you qualified as an\nAFTRA/SAG member and then you had union health Insurance and a Pension! Unlike\nthe tech industry the music conglomerates are PRO UNION.\n\nNow look at the \u201cInnovation industry\u201d. They do not value content. In fact they\nargue they are doing the content creators a huge favor by \u201cdistributing\u201d\ncontent. (the distribution myth is a canard that needs it\u2019s own post, Chris?).\nThey think their services and networks are the only thing of value in the\ndigital ecosystem. This is like the owner of Shoreline Amphitheater thinking\npeople are paying for the privilege of sitting on the chairs. Further they\nseem collectively obsessed with their own self proclaimed genius. And we lowly\ncontent creators are some sort of ungrateful wretches. Just look at how their\nblogosphere surrogates talk about musicians. If Wall Street titans hadn\u2019t\nclaimed the mantle \u201cMasters of the Universe\u201d in the 1980\u2019s the zeppelinesque\negos of the tech industry would claim it.\n\nA friend of mine who works in Silicon Valley likes to point out that Silicon\nValley IS the new Wall Street. It attracts the same \u201cI wanna get rich at\nwhatever cost\u201d sleazebags that used to go to Wall Street and bilk old ladies\nout of their pensions.\n\nAnd just like the Wall Street the tech industry has funded an army of\nprofessional Washington lobbyists to weaken, undo and even eliminate laws it\nfinds inconvenient. In this case copyright protection for artists on the\ninternet. The desired result is that internet/tech companies will never have\nto pay for using artists songs, movies, books and photos.\n\nThe New Boss doesn\u2019t value what you create. And the New Boss would like to\nchange the laws so that your songs are no longer yours.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFreebird.\n\nSo at last we get to the part of the new digital paradigm where things should\nwork as promised. The independent artist on their own label who directly\nreleases their recorded music through iTunes, Amazon Mp3 store etc. This is\nwhere we would expect to find the artists benefiting from the process of\n\u201cdisintermediation\u201d. This is where we should find the artists that are\ncapturing the lions share of revenue. This is where we should find that\nvibrant marketplace of small stakeholders competing with multi-national\nconglomerates. This is where the playing field should be even. This is what\nthe tech visionaries promised us anyway.\n\nWhat percentage of revenue from digital sales goes to an independent artist?\n\niTunes/Amazon 61%*\n\nGoogle Play 70%\n\nBandcamp 85% -fees**\n\nCDbaby 75%\n\nDirectly off the artists Website. 100%-fees\n\n* requires using an aggregator like CDbaby. generally 9% fee.\n\n** looks like Bandcamp pays after the credit card paypal frees.\n\nSo clearly the best thing for an artist is to sell fans digital downloads of\ntheir music directly off their own website. And indeed that is what most\nartists try to do. And the most engaged fans will go to your website and buy\nyour music that way. Failing that you could also sell your music through\nBandcamp or CDbaby and net a little more than you would on iTunes.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem with that:\n\nFacebook, YouTube and Twitter ate our web traffic.\n\nIt started with Myspace and got worse when Facebook added band pages.\nSomewhere around 2008 every artist I know experienced a dramatic collapse in\ntraffic to their websites. The Internet seems to have a tendency towards\nmonopoly. All those social interactions that were happening on artists\nwebsites aggregated on facebook. Facebook pages made many band\u2019s community\npages irrelevant. It is so much more convenient for your fans. Think about it.\nYour fans are probably already on Facebook all day anyway. It\u2019s so much easier\nfor them to interact with other fans and artists on Facebook.\n\nMost artists I know now mostly use their websites to manage their facebook and\ntwitter presence. There are band oriented CMS services that automatically\nintegrate with Facebook and Twitter. They turn your website news, tour dates\nand blog posts into facebook events, facebook posts and Tweets. Most websites\nfunction more as a backend control panel for your web presence. Yes some of us\nsell swag and downloads on our websites but unless you are a really really\npopular band, or you have a major record label that can help you promote your\nwebsite , it\u2019s generally a few hundred of the most ardent fans that ever spend\nanytime on a bands website.\n\nIn the mid nineties bands had complex websites and fulltime web masters. This\nis really rare now cause Facebook, YouTube etc has absorbed all our web\ntraffic. Managing a unique website is not really worth the time you put into\nit unless you are a very popular artist. And the only reason fans would go to\nyour website often is if you have unique content for your visitors.\n\nThink of websites as TV networks or TV stations. A very popular channel has\nenough viewers and revenue to justify creating it\u2019s own content. A little\npublic station in a tertiary market does not. Admittedly not having unique\ncontent because you are too small is a self reinforcing dynamic. But it\u2019s one\nthat I have found is virtually impossible to conquer.\n\nI spent 40 hours shooting and editing a video for the song \u201cRaise \u2018Em Up On\nHoney\u201d and put it on my website. It received several hundred views on my\nwebsite then slowed to a trickle. But the version on YouTube got tens of\nthousands of views. But I HAD to also put it on YouTube. It would have been\nstupid to have not. My fans are all on YouTube watching cute cat videos. They\ncan see when I add a new video to my channel. Why bother going to\nhttp://www.davidlowerymusic.com?\n\nA similar situation occurs with the process of selling music online. Our fans\nalready have an iTunes account. They already have a credit card on file with\nAmazon. That small hassle of getting your credit car out of your wallet to buy\nmusic directly from the artist website is a giant hurdle that most people will\nnot jump over. The internet has a tendency to monopoly because we are fucking\nlazy fat slobs.\n\n65%\n\nSo iTunes and Amazon which account for approximately 83% of the digital music\nmarket, so this duopoly share about 61% of revenue with the independent\nartist. But let\u2019s assume that the artist manages to sell some music directly\noff their website and a few other slightly more generous stores like\nhttp://www.bandcamp.com or CD Baby. So let\u2019s round up the artists share of\ndigital download revenues. Let\u2019s round it up to 65%.\n\nThis is pretty damn good. It dwarfs the revenue that record labels shared with\nartists. And indeed there are some spectacular success stories of artists\nselling their music directly to fans and making a lot of money. Imagine how\nmuch Radiohead made off the album they sold directly to their fans.\n\nThese are the stories that you hear when the tech true believers, the\neVangelicals ecstatically shout \u201cThings have never been better for musicians!\u201d\n\nWhile that is true for these musicians is it true overall? Is it better for\nmusicians as a group? I mean cause I can say the same thing about lottery\nwinners. I can find three or four Jackpot winners and say \u201cThings have never\nbeen better for Lottery players\u201d. And this would not be true because we are\nnot accounting for all the losers. The house or the lottery always wins. But\ntheir are just enough winners that people keep playing the game. And this is\nexactly how the new digital paradigm works. It\u2019s a lottery. A few musicians\nwin every year. But overall money steadily flows to file-sharing companies,\nYouTube, AdSense, Google, Apple, Amazon, Spotify and the record labels.\nArtists haven\u2019t been liberated. We\u2019ve been enslaved in a new and fancier way.\nIt\u2019s been sold to us as freedom. Michael Robertson of Mp3tunes has been on a\ncrusade to \u201cliberate\u201d artists like Pink Floyd from their record companies.\nLiberate them how? Take their songs and share them on Mp3tunes then share NONE\nof the revenue with Pink Floyd? Why would they do they that? At least EMI pays\nthem something.\n\nMeet the new boss, worse than the old boss!\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWhen I Win The Lottery.\n\nBut the music business has always been a lottery. This is nothing new. It has\nalways been ruled by unpredictability and luck. That\u2019s why you often hear\nsomething like this attributed to Ahmet Ertegum:\n\n\u201cThe secret to the music business? Throw ten records against the wall and see\nwhat sticks.\u201d\n\nNever mind that I can find no evidence that he ever said this. This is clearly\nhow the music business has worked for a long time. It\u2019s built into the very\nstructure of the business. In the 1960s when a music scene would pop up\nsomeplace like San Francisco (Haight Ashbury) or Boston (The Bosstown Sound),\nrecord companies would come in and sign anyone with long hair and a guitar.\nThey did the same all through the 70s, 80s and 90s. That\u2019s what they did\nduring Seattle\u2019s Grunge Bubble. Historically the companies that tried to be\nselective, pick the stars were no more successful than the companies that were\nnot selective. From this record companies learned to spread their bets around.\nIn this way record companies have long resembled hedge funds, VC funds or\n\u201cblack box\u201d trading firms that buy 100\u2019s of longshot bets, losing on most of\nthem with the few winners paying spectacular returns.\n\nThe crucial difference between the old boss and the new boss is that the old\nboss the record labels saw that it was in their interest to invest in the\ncreation of music. Further they knew success in the music business was highly\nunpredictable. Therefore they spread their investment around. They didn\u2019t do\nthis out of the kindness of their own hearts, they did this cause it was a in\ntheir long term interest. And it was the surest way to make money. So up until\nthe early 2000\u2019s record companies essentially overpaid the 9 \u201closing\u201d artists\nand underpaid the one \u201cwinning\u201d or hit artist through their system of advances\nfor each album. It was a semi-socialist system. A system in which the\nsuperstars revenue subsidized all those new and developing artists. The\ndestruction of this revenue and risk sharing system is another important\nreason why artists are poorer now.\n\nSlide 25. How risk sharing/revenue sharing made record label artist royalty\nrates a \u201cfloor\u201d.\n\nThis is what people do not understand. When they look at the royalties that\nthe record labels paid artists it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot. It seems unfair.\nUntil you consider the guaranteed advances. Let\u2019s say the artist was to be\npaid a lowly 12% royalty by contract. That compares unfavorably to the 61% of\nrevenue that the independent artist gets from iTunes. But the artist is always\ngiven an advance and usually the advance assumes moderate success. But 9 of\nthose 10 bands did not achieve great success even moderate success. It was\nnever expected that all 10 would be successful. So the result was that the\nrecord label artist actually received a lot more than that contractual 12%.\nThe unsuccessful artist may have received an advance that was equal to 90% of\nthe gross revenue generated by that recording. And most artists were\nunsuccessful. So your average record label artist was actually receiving way\nmore than 12%. The artist royalty rate is actually the floor. It\u2019s the minimum\nshare of revenue the artist will receive.\n\n(I know this is probably really confusing to you civilians. Am I really saying\nit\u2019s better to be un-recouped as an artist? Yes it is. Quantitative finance\ngeeks will see this as selling a series of juicy \u201ccovered calls\u201d. Being un-\nrecouped means you took in more money than you were due by contract. You took\nin more money than your sales warranted. And there was a sweet spot, being un-\nrecouped but not too un-recouped. For instance I estimate that over my 15 year\ncareer at Virgin/EMi we took in advances and royalties equivalent to about 40%\nof our gross sales. In other words we had an effective royalty rate of 40%,\ndespite the fact that by contract our rate was much lower).\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSympathy For The Record Labels.\n\nSo under the old school record label system MOST artists had a much higher\neffective royalty rate than the contracts would lead you to believe. This was\ndirectly a result of this socialistic risk sharing/revenue sharing scheme that\nrecord companies devised. It was directly the result of the record companies\nfinancing the recording of albums through it\u2019s system of advances.\n\nBut wait these \u201ceffective\u201d royalty rates were still mostly lower than that 65%\nthat the independent artist receives under the new digital distribution model.\nRight?\n\nWell yes. but under the new digital distribution model the independent artist\nis now shouldering all the risk and expenses.\n\nWith the exception of a few lottery winners, the independent artists that seem\nmost successful under this new digital model seem to fall into two categories:\n\n1.Established recording artists recently freed from major label contracts.\n\n2.Artists playing to a specific non-commercial niche. For example Black Metal.\n\nBoth types of artists don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money on marketing,\nadvertising, radio promotion or publicity. These expenses can be huge!\n\nThe ex-major label artists are able to sell significant albums as independents\nbecause they are able to rely on their brand that was built with years of\nrecord company money. Niche artists only have to promote and publicize\nthemselves to a very limited tightly grouped audience. But if you are not in\none of these categories the independent artist route is tough.\n\nIn 2010 there were 75,000 albums released. Of those about 60,000 sold less\nthan 100 copies. Only approximately 2,000 sold more than 5,000 copies.\nSlightly less than 1,000 sold more than 10,000 copies. And you got to figure\nmost of those artists were on record label artists.\n\nAn album that sells 10,000 copies for the independent artist would gross\naround $65,000. From that $65,000 dollars the independent artist must pay for\nrecording, a publicist, radio promotion, advertising, photos artwork and on\nand on. You quickly realize that the independent artist is unlikely to be\nbetter off under the new system. In practice the independent artist is\nunlikely to net anywhere near the 65% we estimated.\n\nRock and Roll Animal Spirits.\n\nThen there is the matter that the independent artist must raise the capital to\nrecord and promote the record. The record label artist has the advantage of\nreceiving a loan of sorts from the record company. The independent artist must\neither scrounge together the money or borrow the money. But imagine being an\nindependent artist and trying to borrow money from someone to make a record.\nIn this day and age no one is ever gonna loan an artist money specifically\nBECAUSE of widespread illegal file-sharing. Digeridiots pounding tables and\nshouting \u201cintellectual property is not property\u201d makes the investment\nenvironment even worse. I mean would you loan anyone money to make an album\nthese days? I wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even know if I would loan myself money to make\nan album in this day and age. This air of uncertainty, this \u201canimal spirit\u201d as\nKeynes would term it discourages investment.\n\nThere is also a strange quirk of human nature studied by behavioral economists\ncalled Prospect Theory. Among other things it predicts an individual artist\nwill risk much less of their own money on an uncertain venture ( like\nrecording an album) than a company would risk. Actually Prospect Theory and\nwhat derivatives traders call Volatility Theory can explain the entire\nstructure of the music business. But I digress.\n\nBasically these two things combine to starve the independent artist of\ncapital.\n\nThis lack of capital available to the independent artist makes it highly\nunlikely that the independent artist will sell many records.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFreakin\u2019 at the Freaker\u2019s Ball.\n\nI think I\u2019ve demonstrated how important it was to the old system that record\nlabels shared risk and invested capital in the creation of music. And that by\ndoing this the record labels \u201caccidentally\u201d shared more revenue with the\nartists. But I\u2019ve yet to explain why it is that The New Boss refuses to share\nrisk and invest in content creation. I mean the old record labels eventually\nsaw that it was in their long term interest to do so.\n\nMy only explanation is that there is just something fundamentally wrong with\nhow many in the tech industry look at the world. They are deluded somehow.\nFreaks.\n\nTaking no risk and paying nothing to the content creators is built into the\ncollective psyche of the Tech industry. They do not value content. They only\nsee THEIR services as valuable. They are the Masters of the Universe. They\nbring all that is good. Content magically appears on their blessed networks.\n\nI\u2019m using this language for good reason. There is a quasi religious tone to\nmany tech convention speeches and press releases. What other industry\nconstantly professes utopian visions for all humanity? What other industry\nwould dare proclaim they were liberating artists? Students? Workers? What\nother industry thinks they are mystical shaman \u201cLet\u2019s send our magic objects,\nour laptops to poor children in third world countries\u201d. What other industry\ngenuinely believes they (and only they) possess the lapis philosophorum? They\nhave even created their own God. A Superhuman intelligence that they\n(naturally) have created. The singularity. Their egos know no bounds.\n\nNot only is the New Boss worse than the Old Boss. The New Boss creeps me out.\n\n###\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Reddit\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Tumblr\n  * Pinterest\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nMeet The New Boss, Worse Than The Old Boss?

In days of\nyore, traders complained that the biggest entities held all the cards. At the\ntime, that usually meant a big computer (the size of a car, with the power of\nmy iPhone) that could run theoretical values and crunch spreadsheet numbers.\nSole proprietor market makers, much less civilian customers, were forced to\nwhistle in the dark.\n\nNow, of course, you can download volatility calculators right off the web, and\ncrunch as much data as your pipe can consume. Why isn\u2019t everyone making money?\nWell, in the olden days, spreads were very wide and there was still\nopportunity, so even those without technological support had a chance to\nsucceed. The edge is nothing these days, and speed is all, and only the High\nFrequency Traders\u2013the same big players\u2013have a chance to benefit.\n\nI suspect that this dynamic has played itself out in a number of industries.\nHowever, I think it is particularly prevalent in industries where there is a\nlot of randomness associated with outcomes.\n\n  2. G. (@juepucta) says:\n\nApril 17, 2012 at 5:16 am\n\nthank you for writing this\n\n  3. Stan Jarin says:\n\nApril 17, 2012 at 9:29 am\n\nThis is how reasoned discussion should be done. It took me nearly an hour to\nread it and I\u2019m not in the music business but I read every word. And I\u2019m not\nqualified to know if every point is right or wrong, but research was brought\nto the table, and now if anyone disagrees, they have specific, clearly-defined\npoints to discuss, about real things. Tremendous work, thank you.\n\n  4. Pingback: Previous Post \u00ab Dr. Electro's Mixtapes\n\n  5. Stephen Moratti says:\n\nApril 17, 2012 at 9:17 pm\n\nGreat Read. You puzzle why the internet industry isnt investing in new talent,\nbut its actually quite rational. In the future talent will be discovered by\nlottery on Youtube (c.f. Justin Bieber). Thus Apple can now let the internet\nsort out the winners for nothing, and make money off the 1% who achieve decent\nsales. It has no interest in the 99% of artists who arent going to make it.\nThe 99% of course are mesmerized by fame and will still plug away for no\nreturns.\n\n    1. chriswhittenmusic says:\n\nApril 18, 2012 at 1:14 am\n\nWinners aren\u2019t always determined by sales. This may be a mistake the internet\nindustry is making. 1% may achieve decent sales, but that doesn\u2019t make the\nother 99% worthless. Maybe 50% will be the trend setters and innovators. They\ndon\u2019t sell enough to be very profitable, but their presence in the business\nand their health is VITAL to sustaining a vibrant and exciting music scene.\nFor example, you mention YouTube. Is the only value on YouTube the 1 million\nview videos? I\u2019ve probably gotten more enjoyment out of the 200 view videos on\nthere.\n\n      1. davidclowery says:\n\nApril 18, 2012 at 10:17 am\n\nChris Financially the business has been built on the 1%. Indeed the old record\nlabels essentially redistributed the winnings to the middle class of artists.\nHowever I agree with you that financially unsuccessful artists are vital to\nmusical innovation. What has kept the many forms of popular music vital has\nbeen the continuing musical innovation. So the \u201cwinners\u201d careers are often\nbuilt on these \u201closers\u201d innovations. Some of the older record pioneers like\nAhmet Ertegum state this specifically.\n\nDavid\n\n      2. davidclowery says:\n\nApril 19, 2012 at 9:56 am\n\nAlso Just Received this from Miss Lady Keir. She posted it in sort of a weird\nspot as a comment on a slide. so i want everyone to be able to see this.\n\nMy fans don\u2019t understand why i don\u2019t release more new music yet as i have\n1000\u2032s of songs written and recorded and your research is spot on in summing\nup why \u2013 i\u2019ve been watching , reading , researching all of these \u201cartist\nempowering sites\u2019 as well as the entire spectrum of crumbling majors while the\n\u201cnew music industry \u201d bosses use the best independent and major label music to\nbuild their sites while being forced to make deals with the majors to shove a\ngaga or rhiana track into our playlists cheapening the whole playlist.. you\u2019ve\ngot it right except the old bosses are equally greedy as the new bosses. I was\nsigned to Warner brothers/elektra -who only pay me 5 cents per download\ninstead of the 35 cents on iTunes and nothing for mobile ringtones or you tube\nplays with commercials next to it . Since i left my band DEEE-LITE , best\nknown for \u201cgroove is in the HEART\u201d and the cult classic album \u201cDEWDROPS IN THE\nGARDEN\u201d yet...I can\u2019t afford to pay my new band to get them rehearsed or on\nthe road , nor a one day a week secretary to help with merchandise,emails,web\nmaintenance,etc...let alone mix down and master high quality versions of these\ntracks for my first 4 albums , waiting in the wings, nor pay the editors for\nmy videos. I\u2019m NOT WHINING AND LOVE WHAT I DO but your article sums up why\nit\u2019s nearly impossible to stay in business . My royalties were stolen by my\nformer accountant and attorney for 22 years and so i only began receiving\nmoney for new record sales this year although multi-millions were sold but\nafter being robbed for every record sale , I\u2019m still in the game due to radio\nplay. I spoke on apples panel in 1994 about the future of music and digital\ndistribution with much hope for the future as well as at the \u201cfuture of music\nBS summit\u201d convention where i met several of these so-called artist empowering\nco. presidents on panels where i was \u201cthe artist \u201d on the panel and you have\ngot the situation correct. these guys only care about money and have been\nforced to make deals with the majors to play the majors current puppet in\norder to have access to play vital artists such as the temptations ,etc....\nthese current puppets get fame but no money- nothings really changed much\nthere. Thanks for posting this TRUTH. i only disagree with a few points about\nthe majors . ours refused tour support and i funded that myself and never gave\nus large advances or any art budget sighting that our music was \u201ctoo black and\ntoo gay\u201d. i don\u2019t agree that any artist on a major ever received more than 27%\naccording to my research most received 12% and is including the producer-\nourselves.. I have faith that a corporate sponsor will endorse my tour one day\nas the music will be just as inspiring whenever it is released but until\nthings change i\u2019m stashing my joints as most other experienced artists i know\nare doing. i had plans and still do, to sell my indie music on my own site ,\nsuch as prolific artist and geek JUNIE MORRISON from pfunk and ohio players\ndoes , but as you mentioned, all the fake artist sites set up by Facebook have\ndirectly halted the traffic to our own personal sites which is makes it\nincreasingly difficult to maintain for lack of funds . I never started a\nDeeelite site on Facebook or any other site \u2013 but there they are- vapid and\nunmaintained except by a random fan who stumbles across the site and can\u2019t\ntell the difference. If Facebook cared about artists- they would post the\nartist\u2019s website large and clear with a link....but they don\u2019t care about\nartists . James brown said \u201cto stay in the music business is 75% business and\n25% music\u201d and that runs in my head daily as i watch young artists rise and\nthen run out of steam and fall before they complete one tour and release their\nfirst album. I\u2019m in this for life and have had to turn to deejaying to stay in\nbusiness . You also forgot to mention that since everybody has a mobile phone-\noriginal lyric ideas ,chords, dance moves, style, overall sound get\u2019s swooped\nup at live shows via \u2018cool hunters\u2019 with mobile cameras and co-opted by\nartists and advertisers that are not as creative before I can even release my\nalbum- so the tradition of polishing your act \u201clive\u201d is also a risk not worth\ntaking anymore. I am hopeful about the future yet cautious , protective,and\npatient at the same time. Great music will always find a way to be heard,\nunfortunately , like most artists thru ought history, it won\u2019t be in the\nartists lifetimes. i keep wondering about all the business people whoo were\nfired from the major and why they don\u2019t contact the\noriginal,unique,hardworking artists, to try and start a new platform ????? i\nsuppose they went into porn. thanks for your fantastic article. 5 stars!!!!\nLady Miss kier from deee-lite.\n\n  6. Chumpy Ly says:\n\nApril 18, 2012 at 12:46 am\n\nThanks a bunch for this, was an incredible read. Navigating the music industry\nas an artist is no doubt fraught with challenges and this article opens up a\nhell of a lot of truths we don\u2019t want to admit.
