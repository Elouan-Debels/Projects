The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday, April 9, 2024,\nissued a rule that will force more than 200 chemical plants nationwide to\nreduce toxic compounds that cross beyond their property lines, exposing\nthousands of people to elevated cancer risks. The rule will significantly\nreduce harmful emissions at the Denka Performance Elastomer facility, the\nlargest source of chloroprene emissions in the country, EPA Administrator\nMichael Regan said. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 More than 200 chemical plants nationwide will be required to\nreduce toxic emissions that are likely to cause cancer under a new rule issued\nTuesday by the Environmental Protection Agency. The rule advances President\nJoe Biden\u2019s commitment to environmental justice by delivering critical health\nprotections for communities burdened by industrial pollution from ethylene\noxide, chloroprene and other dangerous chemicals, officials said.\n\nAreas that will benefit from the new rule include majority-Black neighborhoods\noutside New Orleans that EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited as part of\nhis 2021 Journey to Justice tour. The rule will significantly reduce emissions\nof chloroprene and other harmful pollutants at the Denka Performance Elastomer\nfacility in LaPlace, Louisiana, the largest source of chloroprene emissions in\nthe country, Regan said.\n\n\u201cEvery community in this country deserves to breathe clean air. That\u2019s why I\ntook the Journey to Justice tour to communities like St. John the Baptist\nParish, where residents have borne the brunt of toxic air for far too long,\u201d\nRegan said. \u201cWe promised to listen to folks that are suffering from pollution\nand act to protect them. Today we deliver on that promise with strong final\nstandards to slash pollution, reduce cancer risk and ensure cleaner air for\nnearby communities.\u201d\n\nWhen combined with a rule issued last month cracking down on ethylene oxide\nemissions from commercial sterilizers used to clean medical equipment, the new\nrule will reduce ethylene oxide and chloroprene emissions by nearly 80%,\nofficials said.\n\nThe rule will apply to 218 facilities spread across Texas and Louisiana, the\nOhio River Valley, West Virginia and the upper South, the EPA said. The action\nupdates several regulations on chemical plant emissions that have not been\ntightened in nearly two decades.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Troy Carter, whose Louisiana district includes the Denka\nplant, called the new rule \u201ca monumental step\" to safeguard public health and\nthe environment.\n\n\u201cCommunities deserve to be safe. I've said this all along,'' Carter told\nreporters at a briefing Monday. \"It must begin with proper regulation. It must\nbegin with listening to the people who are impacted in the neighborhoods, who\nundoubtedly have suffered the cost of being in close proximity of chemical\nplants \u2014 but not just chemical plants, chemical plants that don\u2019t follow the\nrules.''\n\nCarter said it was \"critically important that measures like this are\ndemonstrated to keep the confidence of the American people.''\n\nThe new rule will slash more than 6,200 tons (5,624 metric tonnes) of toxic\nair pollutants annually and implement fenceline monitoring, the EPA said,\naddressing health risks in surrounding communities and promoting environmental\njustice in Louisiana and other states.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Denka last year, saying it had been releasing\nunsafe concentrations of chloroprene near homes and schools. Federal\nregulators had determined in 2016 that chloroprene emissions from the Denka\nplant were contributing to the highest cancer risk of any place in the United\nStates.\n\nDenka, a Japanese company that bought the former DuPont rubber-making plant in\n2015, said it \u201cvehemently opposes\u201d the EPA\u2019s latest action.\n\n\u201cEPA\u2019s rulemaking is yet another attempt to drive a policy agenda that is\nunsupported by the law or the science,\u201d Denka said in a statement, adding that\nthe agency has alleged its facility \u201crepresents a danger to its community,\ndespite the facility\u2019s compliance with its federal and state air permitting\nrequirements.\u201d\n\nThe Denka plant, which makes synthetic rubber, has been at the center of\nprotests over pollution in majority-Black communities and EPA efforts to curb\nchloroprene emissions, particularly in the Mississippi River Chemical\nCorridor, an 85-mile (137-kilometer) industrial region known informally as\nCancer Alley. Denka said it already has invested more than $35 million to\nreduce chloroprene emissions.\n\nThe EPA, under pressure from local activists, agreed to open a civil rights\ninvestigation of the plant to determine if state officials were putting Black\nresidents at increased cancer risk. But in June the EPA dropped its\ninvestigation without releasing any official findings and without any\ncommitments from the state to change its practices.\n\nRegan said the rule issued Tuesday was separate from the civil rights\ninvestigation. He called the rule \u201cvery ambitious,'' adding that officials\ntook care to ensure \u201cthat we protect all of these communities, not just those\nin Cancer Alley, but communities in Texas and Puerto Rico and other areas that\nare threatened by these hazardous air toxic pollutants.''\n\nWhile it focuses on toxic emissions, \u201cby its very nature, this rule is\nproviding protection to environmental justice communities \u2014 Black and brown\ncommunities, low-income communities \u2014 that have suffered for far too long,''\nRegan said.\n\nPatrice Simms, vice president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice,\ncalled the rule \u201ca victory in our pursuit for environmental justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always more to do to demand that our laws live up to their full\npotential,\u201d Simms said, \"but EPA's action today brings us a meaningful step\ncloser to realizing the promise of clean air, the promise of safe and livable\ncommunities and ... more just and more equitable environmental protections.''\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Phillis in St. Louis contributed to this\nstory.\n\nMatthew Daly, The Associated Press\n\n  * See a typo/mistake?\n  * Have a story/tip?\n\n## This has been shared 2 times\n\n  * 2\n\nShares\n\n  * Share by Email\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n\n  * Share on X\n\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n\n  * Share via Text Message\n\n## More National Business\n\nRestaurants along eclipse's path of totality saw sales boom: Square\n\n41 minutes ago\n\nS&P/TSX composite up in late-morning trading, U.S. stock markets lower\n\n41 minutes ago\n\nRogers, Bell tout eclipse preparation plans after networks handled increased\nusage\n\nabout 2 hours ago\n\n## Your vote matters\n\nParticipate in our next community poll.\n\n  * News\n\n    * Opinion\n    * British Columbia\n    * Alberta\n    * Saskatchewan-Manitoba\n    * Multi-Family\n    * Finance\n    * Franchises\n\n  * Done Deals\n\n    * Submit a Done Deal\n\n  * Business Wire\n  * Where to Invest\n  * Special Features\n  * Connect\n\n    * Contact Us\n    * Newsletter\n    * Advertise with us\n    * Subscribe\n\n  * Digital Edition\n\nAbout\n\n  * Advertising\n  * About Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Contact Us\n  * Political Ads Registry\n\nVisit our network of sites:\n\n  * Bowen Island Undercurrent\n  * Burnaby Now\n  * Business in Vancouver\n  * Castanet\n  * Coast Reporter\n  * Delta Optimist\n  * Lethbridge Herald\n  * Medicine Hat News\n  * Moose Jaw Today\n  * New West Record\n  * North Shore News\n  * Pique Newsmagazine\n  * Powell River Peak\n  * Prince George Citizen\n  * REW.ca\n  * Richmond News\n  * SaskToday.ca\n  * Squamish Chief\n  * The Orca\n  * Times Colonist\n  * TriCity News\n  * Vancouver is Awesome\n  * Western Investor\n  * Airdrie Today\n  * Alberta Prime Times\n  * Cochrane Today\n  * Lakeland Today\n  * Mountain View Today\n  * Okotoks Today\n  * Rocky Mountain Outlook\n  * St. Albert Gazette\n  * Town and Country Today\n\n\u00a9 2024 Western Investor\n\n## Welcome\n\n# This site asks for consent to use your data\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 63 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
