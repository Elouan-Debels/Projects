In doing so, one potential result is that the prices of green\nproducts and products made with fossil fuels will eventually become\ncompetitive, if not equal. Once the price difference is negligible, the hope\nis that consumers will opt for vehicles, appliances, and other products that\noperate on renewable energy, reducing the country\u2019s carbon footprint. However,\nthe IRA\u2019s effects extend beyond U.S. borders. By subsidizing the green\neconomy, European startups are being lured to a lucrative market across the\npond.\n\nThe principle that a product produced with clean energy costs more than a\nsimilar product produced with fossil fuels is known as the Green Premium.\nTaking automobiles, for example, the average price of purchasing a new car in\nthe U.S. was around $46,000 in 2021. The average price of a new electric\nvehicle (EV) was $56,000, making the Green Premium on EVs $10,000 (Winters,\n2021). So how is the U.S. effectively lowering the cost of green products by\nthousands of dollars, and why can Europe not do the same?\n\nThe funds in the IRA, as they pertain to energy and climate change, are\ndelivered in three avenues: subsidies (including tax incentives), grants, and\nloans. Of the $394 billion, $259B are consumer and corporate subsidies that do\nnot need to be paid back (Figure 1). The government is going to bite the Green\nPremium-sized bullet to make green products competitive in the marketplace. In\nthis category, $43B are available to consumers as tax incentives. The value of\nthese tax incentives varies for an assortment of products, such as $7,500 and\n$4,000 rebates for new and used vehicles, respectively, and 30% or up to\n$1,200 off for appliances, solar panels, geothermal heating, and home\nbatteries. By far, the biggest beneficiaries of the subsidies are\ncorporations, saving a total of $216B. This pot is filled with everything from\nswitching to solar power to buying energy-efficient utilities to buying\ncommercial EVs (Badlam et al., 2022).\n\nNaturally, these incentives sound good to both consumers and producers of\ngreen products. However, the U.S. is only permitting North American producers\nto reap the benefits of their program. Again using automobiles as an example,\n50% of an EV\u2019s battery must be produced in North America if the vehicle is to\nqualify for the tax deductions\u2014and this number only rises throughout the\nduration of the IRA. By 2029, the last full year of the program, the entire\nbattery will have to be produced on the continent (Smith, 2022). This\nproduction stipulation forces businesses to move overseas or risk forgoing\nmassive sales incentives. The European Union, unfortunately, has few cards\nleft to play if they are to prevent corporate exodus.\n\nThe European Response, spearheaded by EU Commission president Ursula von der\nLeyen, is titled The Green Deal Industrial Plan. Von der Leyen\u2019s plan boasts\nthe goals of reducing regulations, providing easier and greater access to\nfunding, enhancing necessary skills, and opening trade. However, the\nlegislation falls short regarding the second goal. The current funding\nstrategy for the Green Deal is to tap into existing funds, including\nREPowerEU, InvestEU, and the Innovation Fund (\u201cThe Green Deal Industrial\nPlan\u201d, 2023). In total, around $261B will be available. The breakdown of these\nfunds, however, is less favorable than startups were hoping for. The vast\nmajority (90+ per cent) of funding will be issued through loans, whereas just\n$21B are available in subsidies\u2014at the EU level\u2014that is (Figure 1) (Blenkinsop\n& Abnett, 2023).\n\nFigure 1. Composition of the IRA\u2019s and Green Deal Industrial Plan\u2019s Funds\n\nMany commissioners are worried that if there is no subsidy package (or an EU\nSovereignty Fund, as the Commission is calling it) and state aid rules are\nrelaxed, wealthier nations, namely France and Germany, will issue their own\nsubsidies and leave other EU nations to fend for themselves (Rapoza, 2023).\nEven less desirable, French and German subsidies may draw businesses out of\nlesser-developed economies, further exacerbating economic disparities within\nthe EU.\n\nUnfortunately for the startup ecosystem, a hypothetical Sovereignty Fund is\nfar away. Experts predict that it could take the Commission between six months\nand as long as 3 years to pass and implement a subsidy bill (\u201cVon der Leyen\nwill US-Subventionen kontern\u201d, 2023). With 20% of EU startups failing within\none year of their founding, this is a timeframe many cannot withstand (\u201cOne-\nyear business survival rates\u201d, 2023). Further complicating matters, the\nSovereignty Fund is already facing opposition from 10 of the 27 Commissioners\n(Strupczewski, 2023).\n\nWhether or not a Sovereignty Fund is passed, the interim Green Deal funds will\nlikely not suffice. Even if all $21B are used to hold the EU states over for a\nyear or two until a Sovereignty Fund could be implemented, the funding would\nstill fall significantly short of the IRA subsidies, which can shell out a\nwhopping $34B per year. In the time any form of pan-EU fund tantamount to the\nIRA could be mobilized, the competition only becomes more fierce for European\nstartups.\n\nThe IRA, which is already in action, is fueling sales, R&D, and tax cuts for\nbusinesses. Furthermore, American startups are becoming increasingly\ninvestible. According to Pieter Houlleberghs, managing director of\ndecarbonization investing at BlackRock, \u201cThe incentives in the law could drive\na virtuous cycle across newer technologies and markets: It will encourage more\nadoption, which drives down costs, which drives up adoption, which then\nfurther drives down costs \u2014 which is what we as investors look for. The\nmultiplier effect of the incentives in the bill means that the market for\nattractive green investments effectively just got bigger\u201d (2023).\n\nEuropean startups already struggle to gain access to funding, and widening\nthis gap will make startup viability on the continent increasingly\nconstrained. When comparing venture capital investments in Europe and the U.S.\nas a percentage of GDP, the U.S. already invests a volume 2.4 times greater\n(IE.F, 2023). According to the IEF\u2019s own 2023 venture capital study, \u201cF\u00fcr\n43,8% der deutschen Start-ups stellten 2022 \u2013 nach Daten des Deutschen Startup\nMonitors 2022 \u2013 Finanzierungsengp\u00e4sse das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Gesch\u00e4ftshindernis dar.\u201d\nAhead of labor shortages, inflation, low demand, the crisis in Ukraine, and\nthe corona pandemic, funding remained the most prominent headwind to startups.\n\nBeyond subsidies, grants, and loans, laying out a predictable future is\nperhaps the most valuable aspect of the IRA to startups looking for a capital\ninvestment. Tax deductions for purchasing an EV are not new to the U.S. Since\n2008, qualifying EVs have been eligible for the same $7,500 credit. However,\nthis incentive was only offered on a per-annum basis, and investors were\nunaware whether or not the offering would be renewed (\u201cCredits for New\nElectric Vehicles\u201d, 2023). With the IRA, however, there is a 10-year\nguarantee. According to the founder of SOSV, a climate tech venture capital\nfirm, \u201cTen years is long enough to change the landscape. The job of a VC is to\ntake the stuff that\u2019s in a biology lab or chemistry or physics lab, and make\nit so affordable that in five or ten years\u2019 time, everybody has changed their\nway of interacting with the environment\u201d (2023). Because the IRA is working to\nerase the Green Premium, making green products widely affordable, venture\ncapital firms can take a more confident and calculated risk when buying into\nclimate tech startups, proliferating both the volume and magnitude of\ninvestments.\n\nNo matter their spending package goals, one systematic hindrance in the\nEuropean venture capital space remains: a lack of institutional investors. As\nvon der Leyen and her colleagues cited in their article in the Tagesspiegel on\nFriday, \u201cIn der EU erfolgt die externe Unternehmensfinanzierung zu 75 Prozent\n\u00fcber Bankdarlehen und zu 25 Prozent \u00fcber die Anleihem\u00e4rkte \u2013 in den USA ist\ngenau das Gegenteil der Fall\u201d (2023). The five authors go on to describe how\ntheir goal of establishing a strong single capital market begins with\nrevitalizing the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Within the CMU, von der Leyen\npoints out that Europeans have a great deal of money in savings, more than\nAmericans even, suggesting that the solution to a more competitive European\nmarketplace is greater than a state aid package. Mobilizing institutional\ninvestors to bet on small and medium-sized enterprises is the real champion\nfor capital investments.\n\nIn Europe, where access to venture capital for startups is already trailing\nthe U.S., the impact of the IRA may disrupt the EU\u2019s plans to be world leaders\nin the climate revolution. Without a rapid solution to prevent startups from\nflowing out of Europe and into the U.S., the European Commission jeopardizes\ninvaluable domestic innovation.\n\n\u2190 Vorheriger N\u00e4chster \u2192\n\nTwitter LinkedIn\n\nInternet Economy Foundation, 2024\n\nImpressum Datenschutz\n\nVision Foundation Publikationen Aktuelles Kontakt\n\n", "frontpage": false}
