I made the same mistake a few weeks ago.\n\n## The Sad Story of My 30th Birthday\n\nIt all started a few weeks ago. My 30 birthday was approaching, and I was\ncreating a Facebook event in my underwear while sipping my morning coffee.\n\nI was too lazy to write it, so I used ChatGPT to do the work.\n\nSending out AI generated invites\n\nI'm hitting \u201cEnter\u201d, copy, paste, and invites are sent. All that\u2019s left is to\nwait for my friends & family as they\u2019re coming with all the gifts.\n\nBut none of that happened.\n\nOn the day of my birthday, I was sitting on my couch, all alone.\n\nNo cake, no presents, no birthday singing. Just me staring into a maze of\nloneliness (with close family members).\n\nAnd that got me thinking. What went wrong?\n\n## The Sad Truth About AI-Generated Text\n\nWe\u2019ve heard a bunch of things about AI text.\n\n  * It\u2019s soulless.\n  * It doesn\u2019t have any sense of humor.\n  * It\u2019s boring.\n\nAnd I agree with all of that. But there\u2019s another thing that trumps them all.\nThe thing that made everyone ignore my birthday invitation.\n\nIt\u2019s fricking hard to read!\n\nI pulled out my birthday invitation and I tried to read it. I read it again,\nthen again, and again.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me. No one could read this crap.\n\n  * It\u2019s got long sentences.\n  * It has words that even I don\u2019t understand.\n  * It loses the thought before the sentence ends.\n\nBut don\u2019t just take my word for it. Look at the result from the text analysis\ntool.\n\nAnalyzing AI text\n\nAs you might guess, red means bad. And to me, the text above looks like a\n10-year-old girl with her first period sat on it.\n\nBut enough of my analysis. The damage is already done. My birthday party is\nlong gone. And I have 10 years left for my next big birthday.\n\nSo what\u2019s left for me? I can try to make AI sound more human.\n\n## The Simple Trick To Make AI Sound Human\n\nCan AI-generated text sound human? Can we enjoy reading it?\n\nThese were my thoughts after the failure I described a few minutes ago.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder. So I did the most simple thing I could think of. I\ntried...\n\nI asked ChatGPT to make the text sound more human \u2014 didn\u2019t work. I asked\nChatGPT to use simple language and short sentences \u2014 didn\u2019t work. I begged...\n\nMe begging for better results\n\nIt didn\u2019t work.\n\nBut then I found the solution. The antidote to poorly written, AI-generated\ntext.\n\nI told ChatGPT to write at a 5th-grade English comprehension level. And that\u2019s\nwhat did the trick.\n\nFinally getting a \u201cgood\u201d result\n\nI even tried to combine all these techniques together, and that\u2019s when I got\nthe best results.\n\nSo the trick to sound AI more \u201chuman\u201d? Tell it to write like a 5th grader.\n\n## Last Words\n\nDo you want people to show up at your party? Write the invite yourself.\n\nDo you want your friends to like you? Use your own words to talk to them.\n\nAI is a good way to get boring tasks done. But it\u2019s not a tool to replace your\nsense of humor, your wit, and it\u2019s certainly not a tool to replace your\npersonality.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
