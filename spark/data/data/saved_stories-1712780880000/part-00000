The initiative has been dubbed \u201cProject\nRed Hook,\u201d for the perpetrators\u2019 ties to China and their exploitation of cards\nhung in store kiosks on \u201cJ-hooks.\u201d\n\n### Get Our Top Investigations\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Homeland Security began prioritizing gift card fraud late last year in\nresponse to a flurry of consumer complaints and arrests connected to card\ndraining.\n\nOver the past 18 months, law enforcement across the country has arrested about\n100 people for card draining, of whom 80 to 90 are Chinese nationals or\nChinese Americans, according to Adam Parks, a Homeland Security assistant\nspecial agent in charge based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Parks, who is leading\nthe task force, estimates that another 1,000 people could be involved in card\ndraining in the U.S., mostly as runners for the gangs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially billions of\ndollars, [and] that\u2019s a substantial risk to our economy and to people\u2019s\nconfidence in their retail environment,\u201d he told ProPublica.\n\nCard draining is when criminals remove gift cards from a store display, open\nthem in a separate location, and either record the card numbers and PINs or\nreplace them with a new barcode. The crooks then repair the packaging, return\nto a store and place the cards back on a rack. When a customer unwittingly\nselects and loads money onto a tampered card, the criminal is able to access\nthe card online and steal the balance.\n\nFederal investigators believe multiple Chinese criminal organizations are\ninvolved in card draining and are using the proceeds to fund other illicit\nactivities, from narcotics to human trafficking, according to Parks.\nProPublica recently revealed Chinese organized crime\u2019s involvement in the\nillegal U.S. cannabis industry and the laundering of cocaine, heroin and\nfentanyl profits. ProPublica has also exposed how Walmart and other retailers\nhave facilitated the spread of gift card fraud and has revealed the role of\nChinese fraud rings in gift card laundering.\n\nThe DHS team in Baton Rouge led an investigation that resulted in the\nconviction and 2023 sentencing to prison of a Canadian man who stole more than\n$22 million by operating an illicit online gift card marketplace that\nvictimized American consumers and businesses. As arrests for card draining\nbegan piling up around the country, Parks and special agent Dariush\nVollenweider saw the need for a national response.\n\nLast November, they convened a two-day summit at DHS headquarters in\nWashington, D.C., attended by many of the country\u2019s top retailers and gift\ncard suppliers, including Walmart. Federal authorities pushed the industry to\nshare information and help thwart the gangs. The agency then issued a bulletin\nin December alerting law enforcement across the country about the card-\ntampering tactics. Parks said about 15 Homeland Security agents are now\nspending most of their time on Project Red Hook.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a one-store problem,\u201d Vollenweider said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a\nSecret Service or DHS or FBI problem. It\u2019s an industry problem that needs to\nbe addressed.\u201d\n\nThe Illinois State Police found hundreds of altered gift cards in the back of\na car during a traffic stop in January 2023. Credit: United States District\nCourt\n\nAmericans are expected to spend more than $200 billion on gift cards this\nyear, according to an industry estimate. Retailers love gift cards because\nthey drive sales and profit: Consumers typically spend more than a card\u2019s\nvalue when they shop, and chains like Walmart and Target earn a profit when\nsomeone buys a third-party gift card, such as those from Apple or Google.\n\nData from retailers and consumers shows that card draining has skyrocketed in\nrecent years. Target alone has seen $300 million stolen from customers due to\ncard draining, according to comments last June from a company loss prevention\nofficer contained in a Florida sheriff\u2019s office report. A recent survey by\nAARP, the nonprofit advocacy group for people over age 50, found that almost a\nquarter of Americans have given or received a card with no balance on it,\npresumably because the money had been stolen. More than half of victims\nsurveyed said they couldn\u2019t get a credit or refund. (Apple, Walmart and Target\nsay, in their terms and conditions, that they are not responsible for lost or\nstolen gift cards.)\n\nMore broadly, almost 60% of retailers said they experienced an increase in\ngift card scams between 2022 and 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, Americans lost\nclose to $1 billion to card draining and other gift card scams, according to\nthe Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTarget and Walmart have faced class-action suits from consumers who bought or\nreceived gift cards only to discover the balance had been stolen. In each\ncase, the plaintiffs alleged that the companies have failed to secure the\npackaging of gift cards and to monitor their displays. \u201cThe tampering of Gift\nCards purchased from Target is rampant and widespread and Target is well-aware\nof the problem, yet Target continues to sell unsecure Gift Cards susceptible\nto tampering without warning consumers of this fact,\u201d reads the complaint in\nthe Target case.\n\nThe Walmart case was resolved in 2022 with an undisclosed settlement, and\nTarget is engaged in settlement talks. Apple settled a similar card-draining\nclass-action case in January, agreeing to pay $1.8 million. Walmart and Apple\ndid not admit liability.\n\nApple declined to comment about card draining and the DHS investigation. In\ncourt filings in the class-action, Apple said that since the cards were\npurchased at Walmart, \u201cthe fraud occurred as a result of Walmart\u2019s security\nprotocols, rather than Apple\u2019s.\u201d A Walmart spokesperson told ProPublica,\n\u201cAlthough we will not comment on ongoing investigations, we are proud of our\nroutine work with federal law enforcement to stay ahead of these fraudsters\nand help keep customers safe.\u201d\n\nTarget denied in court filings that its gift card security practices were\ninadequate and that its cards were susceptible to third-party tampering. \u201cWe\nare aware of the prevalence of gift card tampering and take this issue very\nseriously,\u201d Target said in a statement to ProPublica. \u201cOur cyber fraud and\nabuse team uses technical controls to help protect guests, and our store teams\ninspect cards for physical signs of tampering.\u201d Target said it encourages\nemployees to watch for people buying \u201chigh dollar amounts or large quantities\nof gift cards, or tampering with gift cards in stores.\u201d Like Walmart, Target\nsaid it works closely with law enforcement.\n\nGift card scammers linked to Chinese criminal organizations trick their\nvictims in many ways besides card draining. Some scams dupe victims into\nunwittingly paying criminals with gift cards. Whatever the ruse, the crime\nrings make use of low-level \u201crunners\u201d in the U.S., who are almost exclusively\nChinese nationals or Chinese Americans. In card draining, the runners assist\nwith removing, tampering and restocking of gift cards, according to court\ndocuments and investigators.\n\nA single runner driving from store to store can swipe or return thousands of\ntampered cards to racks in a short time. \u201cWhat they do is they just fly into\nthe city and they get a rental car and they just hit every big-box location\nthat they can find along a corridor off an interstate,\u201d said Parks.\n\nIn a 24-hour period last December, an alleged runner named Ming Xue visited 14\nWalmarts in Ohio before being arrested, according to court documents. Police\nsaid they found 2,260 Visa, Apple and Mastercard gift cards in his car. Xue\nentered the U.S. illegally months before his arrest, according to a\nprosecution motion. He has pleaded innocent.\n\nDHS is looking at whether Chinese criminal organizations bring people into the\nU.S. to use them as card-draining runners. John Cassara, a retired federal\nagent and the author of \u201cChina-Specified Unlawful Activities: CCP Inc.,\nTransnational Crime and Money Laundering,\u201d said Chinese criminal enterprises\noften smuggle workers across the border for other enterprises such as\nprostitution or growing marijuana.\n\nParks said investigators are aware that \u201csome of the individuals who were\narrested were within weeks to months of being encountered illegally crossing\nthe southern border.\u201d\n\nOther alleged card-draining runners entered the U.S. legally and told police\nthey were hired via online postings. Donghui Liao was arrested at a Florida\nTarget after employees noticed him removing gift cards from a bag and placing\nthem on racks. Through a translator, he told police that his employer hired\nhim online and mailed gift cards to him, according to court documents. He was\npaid 30 cents for each card he returned to the rack. Police said they found\n$60,000 worth of tampered cards in his possession. Liao remains in custody and\nhis case was recently transferred to federal court. The DOJ did not respond to\nrequests for comment and Liao has pleaded innocent.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat to Know About the Roiling Debate Over U.S. Maternal Mortality Rates\n\nIn New Hampshire, police arrested three people between December and March for,\namong other alleged crimes, using stolen gift card balances to purchase\nmillions of dollars worth of electronics such as iPhones. An apartment used by\ntwo of the suspects contained \u201ca large quantity of Apple brand devices, cash,\nand a computer program that appeared to be running gift card numbers, in real-\ntime,\u201d according to a police report. (Criminals use software to automatically\ncheck gift card balances so they can be alerted when a customer buys and loads\nmoney onto a tampered card.) The fraudsters typically export the electronics\nback to China to resell them, according to Vollenweider.\n\nParks said Red Hook is recommending anti-fraud measures to retailers, such as\ncloser scrutiny of gift card displays, while also heightening awareness of the\nproblem among merchants and local law enforcement. Store security and local\npolice have sometimes treated runners as small-time annoyances and booted them\nfrom stores, rather than arresting and prosecuting them, according to Parks.\nThe task force hopes to work with local police to locate and charge previously\nreleased runners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to start delivering consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nDoris Burke contributed research.\n\nFiled under \u2014\n\n  * Criminal Justice\n\nCraig Silverman\n\nCraig Silverman is a national reporter for ProPublica covering voting,\nplatforms, disinformation, and online manipulation.\n\n  * Craig.Silverman@propublica.org\n  * @CraigSilverman\n  * Signal: 647-949-7610\n\nPeter Elkind\n\nPeter Elkind is a reporter covering government and business.\n\n  * peter.elkind@propublica.org\n\nMore in Criminal Justice\n\n### A Federal Judge Ruled That ProPublica\u2019s Lawsuit Over Military Court Access\nShould Move Forward\n\nThe U.S. government lost its bid to dismiss part of the lawsuit, which would\nforce the military to comply with a law meant to make the military justice\nsystem more transparent.\n\nby Megan Rose, April 3, 5 a.m. EDT\n\nUnder the Gun\n\n### Nearly Two Years After Uvalde Massacre, Here Is Where All the\nInvestigations, Personnel Changes Stand\n\nAs a grand jury considers whether any law enforcement officers are criminally\ncharged for their inaction during the Robb Elementary shooting, some families\nsay they feel they've been let down and betrayed by elected officials.\n\nby Lomi Kriel and Lexi Churchill, March 29, 11:20 a.m. CDT\n\n### \u201cEveryone Will Die in Prison\u201d: How Louisiana\u2019s Plan to Lock People Up\nLonger Imperils Its Sickest Inmates\n\nJanice Parker has witnessed the failing medical care at Angola, the state\u2019s\nlargest prison, on her frequent visits to see her paralyzed son.
