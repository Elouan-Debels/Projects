Lately,\nI've been experiencing acute pareidolia. Three passions of mine\u2014physics,\nmachine learning, and Minecraft\u2014have collided in an undeniable way.\n\nNot long ago, I found myself at a Warriors game with a founder, talking\nintently about physics (in this case, the fine-structure constant). It\u2019s not\nthe first time this has happened. The thinking that governs physics\u2014a\ncuriosity about how and why things work\u2014underpins all innovation, and it goes\nwithout saying a founder with a good idea has probably assessed \"how things\nwork\" and decided on a better way.\n\nMany have noticed, myself included, that there's a robust and invisible path\nfrom Physicsland to MLworld. The endeavor of AGI requires deep, first-\nprinciples thinking with an equal dose of appreciation for emergent phenomena.\nMoreover, machine learning represents a greenfield of complex problems to\nsolve, and the math and logic of physics port easily.\n\nA few examples and coincidences:\n\n  1. DeepMind optimized nuclear fusion reactions by using reinforcement learning to stabilize plasma, a task my physics professor once described as \u201cholding jello together with rubber bands.\u201d\n  2. Alexander Alemi, PhD physicist and Sr. Research Scientist at Google, co-authored a seminal AI paper, Inception-v4 (which is now cited over 16K times). He had been an active contributor to Physics Stack Exchange, where he once wrote about computing the mass of an arbitrary coin based on the sound it made upon landing on his table (a fantastic read).\n  3. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Paul Dirac, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on quantum mechanics, Leo Dirac studied physics and became an AWS engineering lead for what would become Sagemaker. Today, he is the CEO of Groundlight, an ML startup.\n\nCompanies and great thinkers are using the constructs of the physical world\nand applying them to intelligence. Yet learning and thinking have no physical\nlimit, artificial or not. Enter: Minecraft.\n\nIt turns out that Minecraft, a sandbox game I've played for more than a\ndecade, is the perfect test bed for AI agents, something I wrote about last\nApril. Last fall, while watching machine learning expert K\u00e1roly Zsolnai-Feh\u00e9r\nbreak down Nvidia's Voyager paper, my jaw dropped. The video explained how\nresearchers created an agent in Minecraft that \"continuously explores the\nworld, acquires diverse skills, and makes novel discoveries without human\nintervention.\" The machine was able to grasp the tasks you'd expect, like\ncollecting resources or avoiding dangers, but Nvidia's model was also able to\nlearn how to complete more complicated and coordination-dependent aspects of\nthe game, such as building a base, hunting, or fighting. It even learned to\ndefeat one of the deadliest mobs in the game, Endemen. Simply put, Nvidia's\nautomated agent became very good, very quickly.\n\nYou might say: \"So what? Computers master video games all the time.\" The catch\nwas that Nvidia's agent was based on an LLM. The same framework that enables\nOpenAI's ChatGPT to answer questions in a text world spawned a highly skilled\nplayer in a three-dimensional \"real life\" world. The agent learned how many of\nus learn: not by picking up a book and reading the rules, but by building\nassociations and reactions through many experiences\u2014just like learning a\nlanguage. The agent looked at certain aspects of the code\u2014the name of a\nresource or a threat\u2014and quickly learned the \"most likely best action\" the\nsame way a person learns the \"most likely best word\" when speaking. Recently,\nAltera took this to the next level by building a Minecraft bot that acts and\nchats like a human player.\n\nAt the risk of over-paradolia, I'll leave this parting thought. The best\nideas\u2014theories, technologies, businesses\u2014tend to sprout at the intersection of\ndisciplines. I'm excited to watch how these worlds will continue to create new\nways of thinking and new sets of rules. If you've got one, get in touch, even\nif we get to talk about the fine structure constant for a minute or two.\n\nMore Stories\n\ndate is not set\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n## Software and a Service\n\ndate is not set\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n## Financial Services are the New Wedge\n\ndate is not set\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\n## Investing in Metaplane\n\ndate is not set\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n## AI Has Killed the Traditional SaaS GTM Playbook\n\ndate is not set\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\n## Investing in PermitFlow\n\ndate is not set\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\n## Investing in Flower\n\nMore Stories\n\nAbout us\n\nFounder PledgeFounders on FelicisImpactBenchmark Your Org\n\nMission\n\nTeam\n\nCompanies\n\nFocus Areas\n\nAIGlobal ResilienceInfraHealth & BioSecurityVertical SaaS\n\nInsights\n\nGet updates about Felicis, our founders, and our insights in your inbox:\n\nThank you!
