It provides a\nconcise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of\nvisualizations for data analysis and presentation.\n\nVega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from\ndata to properties of graphical marks (e.g., points or bars). The Vega-Lite\ncompiler automatically produces visualization components including axes,\nlegends, and scales. It determines default properties of these components\nbased on a set of carefully designed rules. This approach allows Vega-Lite\nspecifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving\nuser control to override defaults and customize various parts of a\nvisualization. As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-\nLite supports both data transformations (e.g., aggregation, binning,\nfiltering, sorting) and visual transformations (e.g., stacking and faceting).\nMoreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be composed into layered and multi-view\ndisplays, and made interactive with selections. Get started Latest Version:\n5.18.0 Try online\n\nCompared to Vega, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to\nauthor common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to\nVega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the primary visualization tool\nand, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.\n\nFor more information, read our introduction article to Vega-Lite v2 on Medium,\nwatch our OpenVis Conf talk about the new features in Vega-Lite v2, see the\ndocumentation and take a look at our example gallery.
