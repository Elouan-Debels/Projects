In my opinion, at this point the only reasonable course of action would be to safely ban \"AI\"-backed contribution entirely. In other words, explicitly forbid people from using ChatGPT, Bard, GitHub Copilot, and so on, to create ebuilds, code, documentation, messages, bug reports and so on for use in Gentoo.\n    \n    \n    Just to be clear, I'm talking about our \"original\" content. We can't do much about upstream projects using it. Rationale: 1. Copyright concerns. At this point, the copyright situation around generated content is still unclear. What's pretty clear is that pretty much all LLMs are trained on huge corpora of copyrighted material, and all fancy \"AI\" companies don't give shit about copyright violations. In particular, there's a good risk that these tools would yield stuff we can't legally use. 2. Quality concerns. LLMs are really great at generating plausibly looking bullshit. I suppose they can provide good assistance if you are careful enough, but we can't really rely on all our contributors being aware of the risks. 3. Ethical concerns. As pointed out above, the \"AI\" corporations don't give shit about copyright, and don't give shit about people. The AI bubble is causing huge energy waste. It is giving a great excuse for layoffs and increasing exploitation of IT workers. It is driving enshittification of the Internet, it is empowering all kinds of spam and scam. Gentoo has always stood out as something different, something that worked for people for whom mainstream distros were lacking. I think adding \"made by real people\" to the list of our advantages would be a good thing \u2014 but we need to have policies in place, to make sure shit doesn't flow in.
