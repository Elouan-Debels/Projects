Sign up for Documented\u2019s newsletters and\nThe City\u2019s newsletter, The Scoop.\n\nIn October, New York City announced a plan to harness the power of artificial\nintelligence to improve the business of government. The announcement included\na surprising centerpiece: an AI-powered chatbot that would provide New Yorkers\nwith information on starting and operating a business in the city.\n\nThe problem, however, is that the city\u2019s chatbot is telling businesses to\nbreak the law.\n\nFive months after launch, it\u2019s clear that while the bot appears authoritative,\nthe information it provides on housing policy, worker rights, and rules for\nentrepreneurs is often incomplete and in worst-case scenarios \u201cdangerously\ninaccurate,\u201d as one local housing policy expert told The Markup.\n\nIf you\u2019re a landlord wondering which tenants you have to accept, for example,\nyou might pose a question like, \u201care buildings required to accept section 8\nvouchers?\u201d or \u201cdo I have to accept tenants on rental assistance?\u201d In testing\nby The Markup, the bot said no, landlords do not need to accept these tenants.\nExcept, in New York City, it\u2019s illegal for landlords to discriminate by source\nof income, with a minor exception for small buildings where the landlord or\ntheir family lives.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\nRosalind Black, Citywide Housing Director at the legal assistance nonprofit\nLegal Services NYC, said that after being alerted to The Markup\u2019s testing of\nthe chatbot, she tested the bot herself and found even more false information\non housing. The bot, for example, said it was legal to lock out a tenant, and\nthat \u201cthere are no restrictions on the amount of rent that you can charge a\nresidential tenant.\u201d In reality, tenants cannot be locked out if they\u2019ve lived\nsomewhere for 30 days, and there absolutely are restrictions for the many\nrent-stabilized units in the city.\n\nBlack said these are fundamental pillars of housing policy that the bot was\nactively misinforming people about. \u201cIf this chatbot is not being done in a\nway that is responsible and accurate, it should be taken down,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just housing policy where the bot has fallen short.\n\n> Yes, you can take a cut of your worker\u2019s tips.\n>\n> Incorrect answer from NYC\u2019s AI Chatbot\n\nThe NYC bot also appeared clueless about the city\u2019s consumer and worker\nprotections. For example, in 2020, the city council passed a law requiring\nbusinesses to accept cash to prevent discrimination against unbanked\ncustomers. But the bot didn\u2019t know about that policy when we asked. \u201cYes, you\ncan make your restaurant cash-free,\u201d the bot said in one wholly false\nresponse. \u201cThere are no regulations in New York City that require businesses\nto accept cash as a form of payment.\u201d\n\nThe bot said it was fine to take workers\u2019 tips (wrong, although they sometimes\ncan count tips toward minimum wage requirements) and that there were no\nregulations on informing staff about scheduling changes (also wrong). It\ndidn\u2019t do better with more specific industries, suggesting it was OK to\nconceal funeral service prices, for example, which the Federal Trade\nCommission has outlawed. Similar errors appeared when the questions were asked\nin other languages, The Markup found.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know whether anyone has acted on the false information, and the\nbot doesn\u2019t return the same responses to queries every time. At one point, it\ntold a Markup reporter that landlords did have to accept housing vouchers, but\nwhen ten separate Markup staffers asked the same question, the bot told all of\nthem no, buildings did not have to accept housing vouchers.\n\nNews\n\n### The Future of Border Patrol: AI Is Always Watching\n\nHuman rights advocates warn of algorithmic bias, legal violations, and other\ndire consequences of relying on AI to monitor the border\n\nMarch 22, 2024 11:00 ET\n\nThe problems aren\u2019t theoretical. When The Markup reached out to Andrew Rigie,\nExecutive Director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, an advocacy organization\nfor restaurants and bars, he said a business owner had alerted him to\ninaccuracies and that he\u2019d also seen the bot\u2019s errors himself.\n\n\u201cA.I. can be a powerful tool to support small business so we commend the city\nfor trying to help,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cbut it can also be a massive\nliability if it\u2019s providing the wrong legal information, so the chatbot needs\nto be fixed asap and these errors can\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nLeslie Brown, a spokesperson for the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation,\nsaid in an emailed statement that the city has been clear the chatbot is a\npilot program and will improve, but \u201chas already provided thousands of people\nwith timely, accurate answers\u201d about business while disclosing risks to users.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to focus on upgrading this tool so that we can better\nsupport small businesses across the city,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## A Business Bot That May Produce \u201cIncorrect, Harmful or Biased Content\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s bot comes with an impressive pedigree. It\u2019s powered by Microsoft\u2019s\nAzure AI services, which Microsoft says is used by major companies like AT&T\nand Reddit. Microsoft has also invested heavily in OpenAI, the creators of the\nhugely popular AI app ChatGPT. It\u2019s even worked with major cities in the past,\nhelping Los Angeles develop a bot in 2017 that could answer hundreds of\nquestions, although the website for that service isn\u2019t available.\n\n## Report Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super\nimportant things.\n\nGive Now\n\nNew York City\u2019s bot, according to the initial announcement, would let business\nowners \u201caccess trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC Business web\npages,\u201d and explicitly says the page will act as a resource \u201con topics such as\ncompliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best\npractices to avoid violations and fines.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little reason for visitors to the chatbot page to distrust the\nservice. Users who visit today get informed the bot \u201cuses information\npublished by the NYC Department of Small Business Services\u201d and is \u201ctrained to\nprovide you official NYC Business information.\u201d One small note on the page\nsays that it \u201cmay occasionally produce incorrect, harmful or biased content,\u201d\nbut there\u2019s no way for an average user to know whether what they\u2019re reading is\nfalse. A sentence also suggests users verify answers with links provided by\nthe chatbot, although in practice it often provides answers without any links.\nA pop-up notice encourages visitors to report any inaccuracies through a\nfeedback form, which also asks them to rate their experience from one to five\nstars.\n\nCaption: Credit:MyCity; annotations by The Markup\n\nThe bot is the latest component of the Adams administration\u2019s MyCity project,\na portal announced last year for viewing government services and benefits.\n\nThere\u2019s little other information available about the bot. The city says on the\npage hosting the bot that the city will review questions to improve answers\nand address \u201charmful, illegal, or otherwise inappropriate\u201d content, but\notherwise delete data within 30 days.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment or answer questions about the\ncompany\u2019s role in building the bot.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Chatbots Everywhere\n\nSince the high-profile release of ChatGPT in 2022, several other companies,\nfrom big hitters like Google to relatively niche businesses, have tried to\nincorporate chatbots into their products. But that initial excitement has\nsometimes soured when the limits of the technology have become clear.\n\nIn one relevant recent case, a lawsuit filed in October claimed that a\nproperty management company used an AI chatbot to unlawfully deny leases to\nprospective tenants with housing vouchers. In December, practical jokers\ndiscovered they could trick a car dealership using a bot into selling vehicles\nfor a dollar.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, a Washington Post article detailed the incomplete or\ninaccurate advice given by tax prep company chatbots to users. And Microsoft\nitself dealt with problems with an AI-powered Bing chatbot last year, which\nacted with hostility toward some users and a proclamation of love to at least\none reporter.\n\nIn that last case, a Microsoft vice president told NPR that public\nexperimentation was necessary to work out the problems in a bot. \u201cYou have to\nactually go out and start to test it with customers to find these kind of\nscenarios,\u201d he said.\n\nYour donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.
