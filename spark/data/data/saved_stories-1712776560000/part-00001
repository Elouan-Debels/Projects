AI Assistants Will Remember Everything\n\nDigital assistants with access to everything you do on your phone can use that\nknowledge to remember the life details you\u2019d otherwise forget. But with that\ngreat power comes great responsibility.\n\nIllustration: Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images\n\nProponents of artificial intelligence are quick to list the myriad ways their\ntech will serve as extensions of our busy brains. But as Apple, Google, and\nother companies race to bring their AI creations onto our phones, we\u2019re being\npresented with an opportunity to use these next-gen digital assistants to\ncorrect one of our inherent human flaws: poor memory.\n\nTom Gruber, who cofounded the company that created Apple's Siri voice\nassistant, says the potential for offloading memory-dependent tasks is the\nfirst big leap toward making AI assistants that can truly ape human thinking.\n\n\u201cThe basic pieces of cognition, the fundamental one is memory,\u201d Gruber says.\n\u201cIt's the functional inner loop, the basis of almost all of our inference.\nAlmost all of our daily cognition or computation is memory-based. We can do so\nmuch augmentation with just memory. It's just one of the things that humans\naren't so hot at.\u201d\n\nFeatured Video\n\nPaleontologist Answers Dinosaur Questions From Twitter\n\nHuman brains, Gruber says, are really good at story retrieval, but not great\nat remembering details, like specific dates, names, or faces. He has been\narguing for digital AI assistants that can analyze everything you do on your\ndevices and index all those details for later reference. He's advised startups\nand given TED Talks about the viability of using AI to do your memory's dirty\nwork.\n\n\u201cYou can enhance anything that is digitally mediated today,\u201d Gruber says.\n\u201cThat's why I was saying to the world, please build this.\u201d\n\nThere are many ways this memory enhancement could manifest. Patrick Moorhead,\npresident and principal analyst of the tech analyst firm Moor Insights and\nStrategies, predicts that phones may soon employ something akin to constant\nscreenshots powered by AI, snapping images of your phone\u2019s screen every few\nseconds and storing those images for later use. Then when you find you can\u2019t\nrecall a certain detail\u2014maybe you\u2019re trying to remember the particulars of a\nconversation you had, or the name of somebody you met three months ago\u2014you\ncould ask an AI assistant. The assistant would be able to call up everything\nit deems relevant, from across your messaging apps, emails, and LinkedIn DMs\nto provide an answer.\n\n\u201cFor people like me who don't remember anything and have to write everything\ndown, this is going to be great.\u201d\n\nPatrick Moorhead, Moor Insights and Strategies\n\n\u201cI think this will be in every end device operating system by the end of this\nyear,\u201d Moorhead says. \u201cIt will give you cross application ability, across\nMicrosoft, across Google, across Apple environments. Taking tiny little\nsnapshots of everything you do on your phone. And then what it's doing is\ncross-correlating everything to give you better results.\u201d\n\nSome services are nudging toward this already. Google is developing a system\ncalled ScreenAI that reads phone screenshots and parses the text and\ninformation within to answer questions or surface information ambiently. The\ncompany has also recently shown off tech like its Gemini AI-infused Search and\nAI-powered Notebook that can summarize documents and combine various bits of\ninformation to come up with insights you might not have thought of otherwise.\n(Apple is in the AI game now too, working on its own AI models, while also\npartnering with Google to stand on the shoulders of its Gemini offerings.)\nOther companies are creating all manner of digital assistants to do your\nboring office chores and even play video games. Devices like the Rabbit R1 and\nHumane AI pin aim to take mind-numbing tasks off your phone and let an AI\nassistant handle them. Rewind.AI wants to collect data from every moment of\nyour waking life, then serve it up for recall when you forget someone\u2019s\nbirthday. It\u2019s a flood of tools, all at your disposal soon.\n\nBut the next step will be trying to smoothly integrate all those tasks into\nyour phone\u2014or whichever piece of AI-infused hardware you want to carry\naround\u2014in a way that feels cohesive. The stratospheric hype around artificial\nintelligence has sent app developers scrambling to add AI to absolutely\neverything, and that rushed rollout has resulted in some haphazard and\ndisconnected integrations that can feel downright janky when you try to switch\nbetween multiple services.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nWatch the Total Solar Eclipse Online Here\n\nReece Rogers\n\n  * Gear\n\nKitchenAid\u2019s New Espresso Machine Won\u2019t Wake Up Your Roommates\n\nJaina Grey\n\n  * Security\n\nHow to Protect Yourself (and Your Loved Ones) From AI Scam Calls\n\nReece Rogers\n\n  * Gear\n\nHow to Make Better Coffee at Home\n\nJaina Grey\n\nMaking these tools work together will be key to this concept taking off, says\nLeo Gebbie, an analyst who covers connected devices at CCS Insight. \u201cRather\nthan having that sort of disjointed experience where certain apps are using AI\nin certain ways, you want AI to be that overarching tool that when you want to\npull up anything from any app, any experience, any content, you have the\nimmediate ability to search across all of those things.\u201d\n\nWhen the pieces slot together, the idea sounds like a dream. Imagine being\nable to ask your digital assistant, \u201cHey who was that bloke I talked to last\nweek who had the really good ramen recipe?\u201d and then have it spit up a name, a\nrecap of the conversation, and a place to find all the ingredients.\n\n\u201cFor people like me who don't remember anything and have to write everything\ndown, this is going to be great,\u201d Moorhead says.\n\nAnd there\u2019s also the delicate matter of keeping all that personal information\nprivate.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it for a half second, the most important hard problem\nisn't recording or transcribing, it's solving the privacy problem,\u201d Gruber\nsays. \u201cIf we start getting memory apps or recall apps or whatever, then we're\ngoing to need this idea of consent more broadly understood.\u201d\n\nDespite his own enthusiasm for the idea of personal assistants, Gruber says\nthere's a risk of people being a little too willing to let their AI assistant\nhelp with (and monitor) everything. He advocates for encrypted, private\nservices that aren't linked to a cloud service\u2014or if they are, one that is\nonly accessible with an encryption key that's held on a user\u2019s device. The\nrisk, Gruber says, is a sort of Facebook-ification of AI assistants, where\nusers are lured in by the ease of use, but remain largely unaware of the\nprivacy consequences until later.\n\n\u201cConsumers should be told to bristle,\u201d Gruber says. \u201cThey should be told to be\nvery, very suspicious of things that look like this already, and feel the\ncreep factor.\u201d\n\nYour phone is already siphoning all the data it can get from you, from your\nlocation to your grocery shopping habits to which Instagram accounts you\ndouble-tap the most. Not to mention that historically, people have tended to\nprioritize convenience over security when embracing new technologies.\n\n\u201cThe hurdles and barriers here are probably a lot lower than people think they\nare,\u201d Gebbie says. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the speed at which people will adopt and\nembrace technology that will make their lives easier.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because there\u2019s a real potential upside here too. Getting to actually\ninteract with and benefit from all that collected info could even take some of\nthe sting out of years of snooping by app and device makers.\n\n\u201cIf your phone is already taking this data, and currently it\u2019s all just being\nharvested and used to ultimately serve you ads, is it beneficial that you\u2019d\nactually get an element of usefulness back from this?\u201d Gebbie says. \u201cYou\u2019re\nalso going to get the ability to tap into that data and get those useful\nmetrics. Maybe that\u2019s going to be a genuinely useful thing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s sort of like being handed an umbrella after someone just stole all your\nclothes, but if companies can stick the landing and make these AI assistants\nwork, then the conversation around data collection may bend more toward how to\ndo it responsibly and in a way that provides real utility.\n\nIt's not a perfectly rosy future, because we still have to trust the companies\nthat ultimately decide what parts of our digitally collated lives seem\nrelevant. Memory may be a fundamental part of cognition, but the next step\nbeyond that is intentionality. It\u2019s one thing for AI to remember everything we\ndo, but another for it to decide which information is important to us later.\n\n\u201cWe can get so much power, so much benefit from a personal AI,\u201d Gruber says.\nBut, he cautions, \u201cthe upside is so huge that it should be morally compelling\nthat we get the right one, that we get one that's privacy protected and secure\nand done right. Please, this is our shot at it. If it's just done the free,\nnot private way, we're going to lose the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do\nthis the right way.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * Hackers found a way to open 3 million hotel keycard locks\n\n  * A couple decided to decarbonize their home.
