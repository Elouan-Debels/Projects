Then, I will talk about how it\nhas been replaced today by the use of data mining and machine learning\ntechniques.\n\nWhat is the Semantic Web?\n\nThe concept of Semantic Web was proposed as an improved version of the World\nWide Web. The goal was to create a Web where intelligent agents would be able\nto understand the content of webpages to provides useful services to humans or\ninteract with other intelligent agents.\n\nTo achieve this goal, there was however a big challenge. It is that most of\nthe data on the Web is unstructured, as text. Thus, it was considered\ndifficult to design software that can understand and process this data to do\nsome meaningful tasks.\n\nHence, a vision of the Semantic Web that was proposed in the years 2000s was\nto use various languages to add metadata to webpages that would then allow\nmachines to understand the content of webpages and do reasoning on this\ncontent.\n\nSeveral languages were designed such as RDF, OWL-Lite, OWL-DL, OWL-FULL and\nalso some query languages like SparQL. The knowledge described using these\nlanguages is called ontologies. The idea of an ontology is to describe various\nconcepts occurring in a document at a very high level such as car, truck, and\ncomputer, and then to link these concepts to various webpages or resources.\nThen, based on these ontologies, a software program could use reasoning\nengines to reason about the knowledge in webpage and perform various tasks\nbased on this knowledge such as finding all car dealers in a city that sell\nsecond-hand blue cars.\n\nThe fundamental problems of the Semantic Web\n\nSo what was wrong with this vision of the Semantic Web? Many things:\n\n  * The languages for encoding metadata were too complex. Moreover, encoding metadata was time-consuming and prone to errors. The proposed languages for adding metadata to webpages and resources were difficult to use. Despite the availability of some authoring tools, describing knowledge was not easy. I have learned to use OWL and RDF during my studies, and it was complicated as OWL is based on formal logics. Thus, learning OWL required a training and it is very easy to use the language in a wrong way if we don\u2019t understand the semantics of the provided operators. It was thus wrong to think that such a complicated language could be used at a large scale on the Web. Also because such languages are complicated, they are prone to errors.\n  * The reasoning engines based on logics were slow and could not scale to the size of the Web. Languages like OWL are based on logic, and in particular description logics. Why? The idea was that it would allow to use inference engines to do logical reasoning on the knowledge found in the webpages. However, most of these inference engines are very slow. In my master thesis in the years 2000s, reasoning on an OWL file with a few hundred concepts using the state-of-the-art inference engines was already slow. It could clearly not scale to the size of the Web with billions of webpages.\n  * Languages were very restrictive. Another problems is that since some of these languages were based on logics, they were very restrictive. To describe some very simple knowledge it would work fine. But to describe something complicated, it was actually very hard to model something properly. And many times the language would not just not allow to describe something.\n  * Metadata are not neutral, and can be easily tweaked to \u201cgame\u201d the system. The concept of adding metadata to describe objects can work in a controlled environment such as to describing books in a library. However, on the Web, bad people can try to game the system by writing incorrect metadata. For example, a website could write incorrect metadata to achieve a higher ranking in search engines. Based on this, it is clear that adding metadata to webpages cannot work. This is actually the reason why most search engines today do not rely much on metadata to index documents.\n  * Metadata is quickly obsolete and need to be always updated.\n  * Metadata intereporability betwen many websites or institutions is hard. The whole idea of describing webpages using some common concepts to allow reasoning may sound great. But a major problem is that various websites would then have to agree to use the same concepts to describe their webpage, which is very hard to achieve. In real-life, what would instead happen is that a lot of people would describe their webpages in inconsistent way, and the intelligent agents would not be able to reason with these webpages as a whole\n\nBecause of these reasons, the concept of Semantic Web was never achieved as in\nthat vision (by describing webpages with metadata and using inference engines\nbased on logics).\n\nWhat has replaced that vision of the Semantic Web?\n\nIn the last decades, we have seen the emergence of data mining (also called\nbig data, data science) and machine learning. Using data mining techniques, it\nis now possible to directly extract knowledge from text. In other words, it\nhas become largely unnecessary to write metadata and knowledge by hand using\ncomplicated authoring tools and languages.\n\nMoreover, using predictive data mining and machine learning techniques, it has\nbecome possible to automatically do complex tasks with text documents without\nhaving to even extract knowledge from these documents. For example, there is\nno need to specify an ontology or metadata about a document to be able to\ntranslate it from one language to another (although it requires some training\ndata about other documents). Thus, the focus as shifted from reasoning with\nlogics to use machine learning and data mining techniques.\n\nIt has to be said though that the languages and tools that were developed for\nthe Semantic Web have some success but a much smaller scale than the Web. For\nexample, it has been used internally by some companies. Research about logics,\nontologies and related concepts is also active, and there are various\napplications of those concepts, and challenges that remains to be studied. But\nthe main point of this post is that the vision that this would be used at the\nscale of the Web to create the Semantic Web did not happen. However, some of\nthese technologies can be useful at a smaller scale (e.g. reasoning about\nbooks at the library).\n\nSo this is all I wanted to discuss for today.
