Combining\nwith the reductions from lattice problems to LWE shown by Regev [J.ACM 2009],\nwe obtain polynomial time quantum algorithms for solving the decisional\nshortest vector problem (GapSVP) and the shortest independent vector problem\n(SIVP) for all -dimensional lattices within approximation factors of .\nPreviously, no polynomial or even subexponential time quantum algorithms were\nknown for solving GapSVP or SIVP for all lattices within any polynomial\napproximation factors. To develop a quantum algorithm for solving LWE, we\nmainly introduce two new techniques. First, we introduce Gaussian functions\nwith complex variances in the design of quantum algorithms. In particular, we\nexploit the feature of the Karst wave in the discrete Fourier transform of\ncomplex Gaussian functions. Second, we use windowed quantum Fourier transform\nwith complex Gaussian windows, which allows us to combine the information from\nboth time and frequency domains. Using those techniques, we first convert the\nLWE instance into quantum states with purely imaginary Gaussian amplitudes,\nthen convert purely imaginary Gaussian states into classical linear equations\nover the LWE secret and error terms, and finally solve the linear system of\nequations using Gaussian elimination. This gives a polynomial time quantum\nalgorithm for solving LWE.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nPublication info\n\n    Preprint.\nContact author(s)\n\n    chenyilei ra @ gmail com\nHistory\n\n    2024-04-10: approved\n    2024-04-10: received\n    See all versions\nShort URL\n\n    https://ia.cr/2024/555\nLicense\n\n    CC BY\n\nBibTeX\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{cryptoeprint:2024/555, author = {Yilei Chen}, title = {Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2024/555}, year = {2024}, note = {\\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555}}, url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555} }\n\nNote: In order to protect the privacy of readers, eprint.iacr.org does not use\ncookies or embedded third party content.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
