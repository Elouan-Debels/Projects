It resulted in the victory for the\nFrankish and Aquitanian forces,^[8]^[9] led by Charles Martel, over the\ninvading Muslim forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, led by Abd al-Rahman al-\nGhafiqi, governor of al-Andalus. Several historians, such as Edward Gibbon,\nhave credited the Christian victory in the battle as an important factor in\ncurtailing the Islamization of Western Europe.^[10]\n\nDetails of the battle, including the number of combatants and its exact\nlocation, are unclear from the surviving sources. Most sources agree that the\nUmayyads had a larger force and suffered heavier casualties. Notably, the\nFrankish troops apparently fought without heavy cavalry.^[11] The battlefield\nwas located somewhere between the cities of Poitiers and Tours, in northern\nAquitaine in western France, near the border of the Frankish realm and the\nthen-independent Duchy of Aquitaine under Odo the Great.\n\nAl-Ghafiqi was killed in combat, and the Umayyad army withdrew after the\nbattle. The battle helped lay the foundations of the Carolingian Empire and\nFrankish domination of western Europe for the next century. Most historians\nagree that \"the establishment of Frankish power in western Europe shaped that\ncontinent's destiny and the Battle of Tours confirmed that power.\"^[12]\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nThe exoticism of the Saracen army is stressed in this detail from The Saracen\nArmy outside Paris, by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, painted 1822\u201327, which\nactually depicts a fictional incident from Ludovico Ariosto (Cassino Massimo,\nRome).^[13]\n\nThe Battle of Tours followed two decades of Umayyad conquests in Europe which\nhad begun with the invasion of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom of the Iberian\nPeninsula in 711. These were followed by military expeditions into the\nFrankish territories of Gaul, former provinces of the Roman Empire. Umayyad\nmilitary campaigns reached northward into Aquitaine and Burgundy, including a\nmajor engagement at Bordeaux and a raid on Autun. Charles's victory is widely\nbelieved to have stopped the northward advance of Umayyad forces from the\nIberian Peninsula and to have prevented the Islamization of Western\nEurope.^[14]^[15]\n\nMost historians assume that the two armies met where the rivers Clain and\nVienne join between Tours and Poitiers. The number of troops in each army is\nnot known. The Mozarabic Chronicle of 754, a Latin contemporary source which\ndescribes the battle in greater detail than any other Latin or Arabic source,\nstates that \"the people of Austrasia [the Frankish forces], greater in number\nof soldiers and formidably armed, killed the king, Abd ar-Rahman\",^[16] which\nagrees with many Arab and Muslim historians. However, virtually all Western\nsources disagree, estimating the Franks as numbering 30,000, less than half\nthe Muslim force.^[17]\n\nSome modern historians, using estimates of what the land was able to support\nand what Martel could have raised from his realm and supported during the\ncampaign, believe the total Muslim force, counting the outlying raiding\nparties, which rejoined the main body before Tours, outnumbered the Franks.\nDrawing on non-contemporary Muslim sources, Creasy describes the Umayyad\nforces as 80,000 strong or more. Writing in 1999, Paul K. Davis estimates the\nUmayyad forces at 80,000 and the Franks at about 30,000,^[17] while noting\nthat modern historians have estimated the strength of the Umayyad army at\nTours at between 20,000\u201380,000.^[18] However, Edward J. Schoenfeld, rejecting\nthe older figures of 60,000\u2013400,000 Umayyads and 75,000 Franks, contends that\n\"estimates that the Umayyads had over fifty thousand troops (and the Franks\neven more) are logistically impossible.\"^[11] Similarly, historian Victor\nDavis Hanson believes both armies were roughly the same size, between 20,000\nand 30,000 men.^[19]^[20]^: 141\n\nContemporary historical analysis may be more accurate than the medieval\nsources, as the modern figures are based on estimates of the logistical\nability of the countryside to support these numbers of men and animals. Both\nDavis and Hanson point out that both armies had to live off the countryside,\nneither having a logistical system sufficient to provide supplies for a\ncampaign. Other sources give the following estimates: \"Gore places the\nFrankish army at 15,000\u201320,000, although other estimates range from 30,000 to\n80,000. In spite of wildly varying estimates of the Muslim force, he places\nthat army as around 20,000\u201325,000. Other estimates also range up to 80,000,\nwith 50,000 not an uncommon estimate.\"^[21]\n\nLosses during the battle are unknown, but chroniclers later claimed that\nCharles Martel's force lost about 1,500 while the Umayyad force was said to\nhave suffered massive casualties of up to 375,000 men.^[citation needed]\nHowever, these same casualty figures were recorded in the Liber Pontificalis\nfor Duke Odo the Great's victory at the Battle of Toulouse (721). Paul the\nDeacon reported correctly in his History of the Lombards (written around 785)\nthat the Liber Pontificalis mentioned these casualty figures in relation to\nOdo's victory at Toulouse (though he claimed that Charles Martel fought in the\nbattle alongside Odo), but later writers, probably \"influenced by the\nContinuations of Fredegar, attributed the Muslims casualties solely to Charles\nMartel, and the battle in which they fell became unequivocally that of [Tours-\nPoitiers].\"^[22] The Vita Pardulfi, written in the middle of the eighth\ncentury, reports that after the battle 'Abd-al-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n's forces burned and\nlooted their way through the Limousin on their way back to Al-Andalus, which\nimplies that they were not destroyed to the extent imagined in the\nContinuations of Fredegar.^[23]\n\n### Umayyads[edit]\n\nThe invasion of Hispania, and then Gaul, was led by the Umayyad dynasty\n(Arabic: \u0628\u0646\u0648 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0629 ban\u016b umayya / \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0648\u064a\u0648\u0646 al-umawiyy\u016bn also \"Umawi\"), the first\ndynasty of Sunni caliphs of the Sunni Islamic empire after the reign of the\nRashidun Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali) ended. The Umayyad\nCaliphate, at the time of the Battle of Tours, was perhaps the world's\nforemost military power. The great expansion of the Caliphate occurred under\nthe reign of the Umayyads. Muslim armies pushed east across Persia and west\nacross North Africa through the late 7th century.^[24]\n\nThe Umayyad empire was now a vast domain that ruled a diverse array of\npeoples. It had defeated and completely absorbed the Sasanian Empire, while\nalso conquering much of the Byzantine Empire, including Syria, Armenia, and\nNorth Africa, although Leo the Isaurian stemmed the tide when his army\ndefeated the Umayyads at the Battle of Akroinon (740), their final campaign in\nAnatolia.^[24]\n\n### Franks[edit]\n\nThe Frankish realm under Charles Martel was the foremost military power of\nwestern Europe. During most of his tenure in office as commander-in-chief of\nthe Franks, it consisted of north and eastern France (Austrasia, Neustria and\nBurgundy), most of western Germany, and the Low Countries (Luxembourg, Belgium\nand the Netherlands). The Frankish realm had begun to progress towards\nbecoming the first real imperial power in western Europe since the fall of\nRome. However, it continued to struggle against external forces such as the\nSaxons, Frisians, and other opponents such as the Basque-Aquitanians led by\nOdo the Great (Old French: Eudes, or Eudo), Duke over Aquitaine and Vasconia.\n\n### Umayyad conquests from Hispania[edit]\n\nMain article: Umayyad conquest of Hispania\n\nThe \"Age of the Caliphs\", showing Umayyad dominance stretching from the Middle\nEast to the Iberian Peninsula, including the port of Narbonne, c. 720\n\nTours\n\nAutun\n\nNarbonne\n\nToulouse\n\nclass=notpageimage|\n\nModern-day French borders. Septimania runs along the Mediterranean (southeast)\ncoast from the Spanish border, and Aquitaine is along the Atlantic (west)\ncoast running north from Spain.\n\nThe Umayyad troops, under Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, the governor-general\nof al-Andalus, overran Septimania by 719, following their sweep up the Iberian\nPeninsula. Al-Samh set up his capital from 720 at Narbonne, which the Moors\ncalled Arb\u016bna. With the port of Narbonne secure, the Umayyads swiftly subdued\nthe largely unresisting cities of Alet, B\u00e9ziers, Agde, Lod\u00e8ve, Maguelonne, and\nN\u00eemes, still controlled by their Visigothic counts.^[25]\n\nThe Umayyad campaign into Aquitaine suffered a temporary setback at the Battle\nof Toulouse. Duke Odo the Great broke the siege of Toulouse, taking Al-Samh\nibn Malik's forces by surprise. Al-Samh ibn Malik was mortally wounded. This\ndefeat did not stop incursions into old Roman Gaul, as Moorish forces, soundly\nbased in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea, struck eastwards in the 720s,\npenetrating as far as Autun in Burgundy in 725.^[25]\n\nThreatened by both the Umayyads in the south and by the Franks in the north,\nin 730 Odo allied himself with the Berber commander Uthman ibn Naissa, called\n\"Munuza\" by the Franks, the deputy governor of what would later become\nCatalonia. To seal the alliance, Uthman was given Odo's daughter Lampagie in\nmarriage, and Moorish raids across the Pyrenees, Odo's southern border,\nceased.^[25] However, the next year, the Berber leader killed the bishop of\nUrgell Nambaudus and detached himself from his Arab masters in Cordova. Abd Al\nRa\u1e25man in turn sent an expedition to crush his revolt, and next directed his\nattention against Uthman's ally Odo.^[26]\n\nOdo collected his army at Bordeaux, but was defeated, and Bordeaux plundered.\nDuring the following Battle of the River Garonne, the Chronicle of 754^[27]\ncommented that \"God alone knows the number of the slain\".^[28] The Chronicle\nof 754 continues, saying they \"pierced through the mountains, trampled over\nrough and level ground, plundered far into the country of the Franks, and\nsmote all with the sword, insomuch that when Eudo came to battle with them at\nthe River Garonne, he fled.\"\n\n### Odo's appeal to the Franks[edit]\n\nOdo, who despite the heavy losses was reorganizing his troops, gave the\nFrankish leader notice of the impending danger knocking on the heartland of\nhis realm and appealed to the Franks for assistance, which Charles Martel only\ngranted after Odo agreed to submit to Frankish authority.\n\nIt appears that the Umayyads were not aware of the true strength of the\nFranks. The Umayyad forces were not particularly concerned about any of the\nGermanic tribes, including the Franks, and the Arab chronicles of that age\nshow that awareness of the Franks as a growing military power only came after\nthe Battle of Tours.\n\nFurther, the Umayyads appear not to have scouted northward for potential foes,\nfor if they had, they surely would have noted Charles Martel as a force to be\nreckoned with in his own account, because of his growing domination of much of\nEurope since 717.\n\n### Umayyad advance towards the Loire[edit]\n\nIn 732, the Umayyad advance force was proceeding north towards the Loire\nRiver, having outpaced their supply train and a large part of their army.\nHaving easily destroyed all resistance in that part of Gaul, the invading army\nhad split off into several raiding parties, while the main body advanced more\nslowly.\n\nThe Umayyads delayed their campaign late in the year probably because the army\nneeded to live off the land as they advanced. They had to wait until the\narea's wheat harvest was ready and then until a reasonable amount of the\nharvest had been stored.\n\nOdo was defeated so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, despite winning 11 years\nearlier at the Battle of Toulouse, because at Toulouse he had managed a\nsurprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe: the Umayyad\nforces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry they did have were never\nmobilized. As Herman of Carinthia wrote in one of his translations of a\nhistory of al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment\nwhich took the attackers totally by surprise, resulting in a chaotic slaughter\nof the Muslim forces.\n\nAt Bordeaux and again at Garonne, the Umayyad forces were mostly cavalry and\nhad the chance to mobilize, which led to the devastation of Odo's army. Odo's\nforces, like other European troops of that era, had no stirrups at that time\nand therefore no heavy cavalry. Most of their troops were infantry. The\nUmayyad heavy cavalry broke Odo's infantry in their first charge and then\nslaughtered them as they ran.\n\nThe invading force went on to devastate southern Gaul. A possible motive,\naccording to the second continuator of the Chronicle of Fredegar, were the\nriches of the Abbey of Saint Martin of Tours, the most prestigious and holiest\nshrine in western Europe at the time.^[29] Upon hearing this, Austrasia's\nMayor of the Palace, Charles Martel, prepared his army and marched south,\navoiding the old Roman roads, hoping to take the Muslims by surprise.\n\n## Battle (October 732)[edit]\n\nBattle of Tours\n\nclass=notpageimage|\n\nThe location of the battle in modern-day France\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

Charles achieved the total\nsurprise he had hoped for. He then chose not to attack and rather began\nfighting in a defensive, phalanx-like formation.^[19] According to Arab\nsources, the Franks drew up in a large square, with hills and trees in their\nfront to diminish or break up Muslim cavalry charges.\n\nFor one week, the two armies engaged in minor skirmishes. The Umayyads waited\nfor their full strength to arrive. 'Abd-al-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n, despite being a proven\ncommander, had been outmaneuvered; he had allowed Charles to concentrate his\nforces and pick the field of battle. Furthermore, the Umayyads couldn't judge\nthe size of Charles' army since he had used the trees and forest to screen his\ntrue numbers.\n\nCharles' infantry was his best hope for victory. Seasoned and battle-hardened,\nmost of them had fought with him for years, some as far back as 717. In\naddition to his army, he also had levies of militia which had not seen\nsignificant military use except for gathering food and harassing the Muslim\narmy.\n\nWhile many historians through the centuries have believed that the Franks were\noutnumbered at the onset of battle by at least two to one, some sources, such\nas the Mozarabic Chronicle of 754, disagree with that assertion.^[30]\n\nCharles correctly assumed that 'Abd-al-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n would feel compelled to give\nbattle, and move on and try to loot Tours. Neither side wanted to attack. Abd-\nal-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n felt he had to sack Tours, which meant he had to go through the\nFrankish army on the hill in front of him. Charles' decision to stay in the\nhills proved crucial, as it forced the Umayyad cavalry to charge uphill and\nthrough trees, diminishing their effectiveness.\n\nCharles had been preparing for this confrontation since the Battle of Toulouse\na decade earlier.^[19] Gibbon believes, as do most historians, that Charles\nhad made the best of a bad situation. Though allegedly outnumbered and without\nany heavy cavalry, he had tough, battle-hardened infantrymen who believed in\nhim implicitly. At a time in the Dark Ages when permanent armies had been non-\nexistent in Europe, Charles even took out a large loan from the Pope after\nconvincing him of the impending emergency, to properly train and maintain a\nfull-size army largely composed of professional infantry. Moreover, as Davis\npoints out, these infantrymen were heavily armed.^[31]\n\nFormed into a phalanx formation, they were able to withstand a cavalry charge\nbetter than might be expected, especially as Charles had secured the high\nground \u2013 with trees before him to further impede any cavalry charges. The\nfailure of Arab intelligence extended to the fact that they were unaware of\nhow good his forces were; he had trained them for a decade. And while he was\nwell aware of the Caliphate's strengths and weaknesses, he was aware they knew\nnothing about the Franks.\n\nFurthermore, the Franks were dressed for the cold. The Arabs had very light\nclothing more suitable for North African winters than European\nwinters.^[citation needed]\n\nThe battle eventually became a waiting game in which the Muslims did not want\nto attack an army that could be numerically superior and wanted the Franks to\ncome out into the open. The Franks formed up in a thick defensive formation\nand waited for them to charge uphill. The battle finally began on the seventh\nday, as 'Abd-al-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n did not want to wait any longer, with winter\napproaching.\n\n### Engagement[edit]\n\nFrankish and Umayyad cavalry clash (illustration from the 19th century by\nCharlotte Mary Yonge)\n\n'Abd-al-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n trusted in the tactical superiority of his cavalry and had them\ncharge repeatedly throughout the day. The disciplined Frankish soldiers\nwithstood the assaults, though according to Arab sources, the Arab cavalry\nbroke into the Frankish square several times. Despite this, the Franks did not\nbreak. The well-trained Frankish soldiers accomplished what was not thought\npossible at that time: infantry withstanding a heavy cavalry charge. Paul\nDavis says the core of Charles' army was a professional infantry that was both\nhighly disciplined and well-motivated, \"having campaigned with him all over\nEurope\".\n\n### Contemporary accounts[edit]\n\nThe Mozarabic Chronicle of 754 \"describes the battle in greater detail than\nany other Latin or Arabic source\".^[32] It says of the encounter that,\n\n> While Abd ar-Rahman was pursuing Odo, he decided to despoil Tours by\n> destroying its palaces and burning its churches. There he confronted the\n> consul of Austrasia by the name of Charles, a man who, having proved himself\n> to be a warrior from his youth and an expert in things military, had been\n> summoned by Odo. After each side had tormented the other with raids for\n> almost seven days, they finally prepared their battle lines and fought\n> fiercely. The northern peoples remained as immobile as a wall, holding\n> together like a glacier in the cold regions. In the blink of an eye, they\n> annihilated the Arabs with the sword. The people of Austrasia, greater in a\n> number of soldiers and formidably armed, killed the king, Abd ar-Rahman,\n> when they found him, striking him on the chest. But suddenly, within sight\n> of the countless tents of the Arabs, the Franks despicably sheathed their\n> swords postponing the fight until the next day since night had fallen during\n> the battle. Rising from their own camp at dawn, the Europeans saw the tents\n> and canopies of the Arabs all arranged just as they had appeared the day\n> before. Not knowing that they were empty and thinking that inside them there\n> were Saracen forces ready for battle, they sent officers to reconnoiter and\n> discovered that all the Ishmaelite troops had left. They had indeed fled\n> silently by night in tight formation, returning to their own country.\n>\n> \u2014 Wolf (trans.), Chronicle of 754, p. 145\n\nCharles Martel's family composed, for the fourth book of the Continuations of\nFredegar's Chronicle, a stylized summary of the battle:\n\n> Prince Charles boldly drew up his battle lines against them [the Arabs] and\n> the warrior rushed in against them. With Christ's help, he overturned their\n> tents and hastened to battle to grind them small in slaughter.

It goes on to say Charles \"scattered them like the\nstubble\".\n\nThe Latin word used for \"warrior\", belligerator, \"is from the Book of\nMaccabees, chapters 15 and 16\", which describe huge battles.^[33]\n\nIt is thought that Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People (Book\nV, Chapter XXIV) includes a reference to the Battle of Tours: \"... a dreadful\nplague of Saracens ravaged France with miserable slaughter, but they not long\nafter in that country received the punishment due to their wickedness\".^[34]\n\n### Strategic analysis[edit]\n\nGibbon makes the point^[citation needed] that 'Abd-al-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n did not move at\nonce against Charles Martel, and was surprised by him at Tours as Charles had\nmarched over the mountains avoiding the roads to surprise the Muslim invaders.\nThus, Charles selected the time and place they would collide.\n\n'Abd-al-Ra\u1e25m\u00e2n was a good general, but failed to do two things he should have\ndone before the battle:\n\n  * He either assumed that the Franks would not come to the aid of their Aquitanian rivals, or did not care, and he thus failed to assess their strength before the invasion.\n  * He failed to scout the movements of the Frankish army.\n\nThese failures disadvantaged the Muslim army in the following ways:\n\n  * The invaders were burdened with booty that played a role in the battle.\n  * They had casualties before they fought the battle.\n  * Weaker opponents such as Odo were not bypassed, whom they could have picked off at will later, while moving at once to force battle with the real power in Europe and at least partially pick the battlefield.\n\nWhile some military historians point out that leaving enemies in your rear is\nnot generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing\nweaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, can be a devastatingly effective\nmode of invasion. In this case, those enemies were virtually no danger, given\nthe ease with which the Muslims destroyed them. The real danger was Charles,\nand the failure to scout Gaul adequately was disastrous.\n\nAccording to Creasy,^[35] both western and Muslim histories agree the battle\nwas hard fought, and that the Umayyad heavy cavalry had broken into the\nsquare, but agreed that the Franks were in formation still strongly resisting.\n\nCharles could not afford to stand idly by while Frankish territories were\nthreatened. He would have to face the Umayyad armies sooner or later, and his\nmen were enraged by the utter devastation of the Aquitanians and wanted to\nfight. But Sir Edward Creasy noted that,\n\n> When we remember that Charles had no standing army, and the independent\n> spirit of the Frank warriors who followed his standard, it seems most\n> probable that it was not in his power to adopt the cautious policy of\n> watching the invaders, and wearing out their strength by delay. So dreadful\n> and so widespread were the ravages of the Saracenic light cavalry throughout\n> Gaul, that it must have been impossible to restrain for any length of time\n> the indignant ardor of the Franks. And, even if Charles could have persuaded\n> his men to look tamely on while the Arabs stormed more towns and desolated\n> more districts, he could not have kept an army together when the usual\n> period of a military expedition had expired.^[36]\n\nBoth Hallam and Watson^[32] argue that had Charles failed, there was no\nremaining force to protect Western Europe. Hallam perhaps said it best: \"It\nmay justly be reckoned among those few battles of which a contrary event would\nhave essentially varied the drama of the world in all its subsequent scenes:\nwith Marathon, Arbela, the Metaurus, Ch\u00e2lons and Leipzig.\"^[37]\n\nStrategically, and tactically, Charles probably made the best decision he\ncould in waiting until his enemies least expected him to intervene, and then\nmarching by stealth to catch them by surprise at a battlefield of his\nchoosing. Probably he and his own men did not realize the seriousness of the\nbattle they had fought, as one historian put it: \"few battles are remembered\nover 1,000 years after they are fought, but the Battle of [Tours-Poitiers] is\nan exception ... Charles Martel turned back a Muslim raid that had it been\nallowed to continue, might have conquered Gaul.\"^[38] Roger Collins disputes\ninterpretations of ever-expanding Umayyad forces, reminding their internal\ncohesion problems and the capture of Autun in 725, when the Burgundian\nstronghold was captured and sacked, then just abandoned by Anbasa's raiding\nforces.^[39]\n\n## Victory for Charles Martel[edit]\n\nCharles Martel at the Battle of Tours, depicted in the Grandes Chroniques de\nFrance\n\n### Umayyad retreat and second invasion[edit]\n\nThe Umayyad army retreated south over the Pyrenees.^[40] Charles continued to\nexpand south in subsequent years. After the death of Odo (c. 735), who had\nreluctantly acknowledged Charles' suzerainty in 719, Charles wished to unite\nOdo's duchy to himself and went there to elicit the proper homage of the\nAquitanians. But the nobility proclaimed Hunald, Odo's son, as the duke, and\nCharles recognized his legitimacy when the Umayyads entered Provence as part\nof an alliance with Duke Maurontus the next year.^[41]\n\nHunald, who originally resisted acknowledging Charles as an overlord, soon had\nlittle choice. He acknowledged Charles as his overlord, albeit not for long,\nand Charles confirmed his duchy.\n\n#### Umayyad invasion (735\u201339)[edit]\n\nIn 735, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj, the new governor of al-Andalus, invaded Gaul.\nAntonio Santosuosso and other historians detail how he advanced into France to\navenge the defeat at Tours and to spread Islam. According to Santosuosso, Uqba\nibn al-Hajjaj converted about 2,000 Christians he had captured over his\ncareer. In the last major attempt at an invasion of Gaul through Iberia, a\nsizable expedition was assembled at Saragossa and entered what is now French\nterritory in 735, crossed the River Rhone, and captured and looted Arles. From\nthere, he struck into the heart of Provence, ending with the capture of\nAvignon, despite strong resistance.^[42]\n\nUqba ibn al-Hajjaj's forces remained in Septimania and part of Provence for\nfour years, carrying raids to Lyons, Burgundy, and Piedmont. Charles Martel\ninvaded Septimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, but was forced back again\nto Frankish territory under his control. Alessandro Santosuosso strongly\nargues that the second (Umayyad) expedition was probably more dangerous than\nthe first. The second expedition's failure^[specify] put an end to any serious\nMuslim expedition across the Pyrenees, although raids continued. Plans for\nfurther large-scale attempts were hindered by internal turmoil in the Umayyad\nlands which often made enemies out of their own kind.^[42]\n\n### Advance to Narbonne[edit]\n\nDespite the defeat at Tours, the Umayyads remained in control of Narbonne and\nSeptimania for another 27 years, though they could not expand further. The\ntreaties reached earlier with the local population stood firm and were further\nconsolidated in 734 when the governor of Narbonne, Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-\nFihri, concluded agreements with several towns on common defense arrangements\nagainst the encroachments of Charles Martel, who had systematically brought\nthe south to heel as he extended his domains. He conquered Umayyad fortresses\nand destroyed their garrisons at the Siege of Avignon and the Siege of\nN\u00eemes.^[citation needed]\n\nThe army attempting to relieve Narbonne met Charles in open battle at the\nBattle of the River Berre and was destroyed. However, Charles failed in his\nattempt to take Narbonne at the Siege of Narbonne in 737, when the city was\njointly defended by its Muslim Arab and Berber, and its Christian Visigothic\ncitizens.^[citation needed]\n\n### Carolingian dynasty[edit]\n\nMain articles: Francia, Carolingian Empire, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne\n\nReluctant to tie down his army for a siege that could last years, and\nbelieving he could not afford the losses of an all-out frontal assault such as\nhe had used at Arles, Charles was content to isolate the few remaining\ninvaders in Narbonne and Septimania. The threat of invasion was diminished\nafter the Umayyad defeat at Narbonne, and the unified Caliphate would collapse\ninto civil war in 750 at the Battle of the Zab.\n\nIt was left to Charles' son, Pepin the Short, to force Narbonne's surrender in\n759, thus bringing it into the Frankish domains. The Umayyad dynasty was\nexpelled, driven back to Al-Andalus where Abd al-Rahman I established an\nemirate in C\u00f3rdoba in opposition to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.\n\nIn the northeast of Spain, the Frankish emperors established the Marca\nHispanica across the Pyrenees in part of what today is Catalonia, reconquering\nGirona in 785 and Barcelona in 801. This formed a buffer zone against Muslim\nlands across the Pyrenees. Historian J.M. Roberts said in 1993 of the\nCarolingian dynasty:\n\n> It produced Charles Martel, the soldier who turned the Arabs back at Tours,\n> and the supporter of Saint Boniface the Evangelizer of Germany. This is a\n> considerable double mark to have left on the history of Europe.^[43]\n\nBefore the Battle of Tours, stirrups may have been unknown in the west. Lynn\nTownsend White Jr. argues that the adoption of the stirrup for cavalry was the\ndirect cause of the development of feudalism in the Frankish realm by Charles\nMartel and his heirs.^[44]\n\n## Historical and macrohistorical views[edit]\n\nThis section contains too many or overly lengthy quotations. Please help\nsummarize the quotations. Consider transferring direct quotations to Wikiquote\nor excerpts to Wikisource. (December 2021)  \n---  \nThe Battle of Tours depicted in the Grandes Chroniques de France\n\nThe historical views of this battle fall into three great phases, both in the\nEast and especially in the West. Western historians, beginning with the\nMozarabic Chronicle of 754, stressed the macrohistorical impact of the battle,\nas did the Continuations of Fredegar. This became a claim that Charles had\nsaved Christianity, as Gibbon and his generation of historians agreed that the\nBattle of Tours was unquestionably decisive in world history.\n\nModern historians have essentially fallen into two camps on the issue. The\nfirst camp essentially agrees with Gibbon, and the other argues that the\nBattle has been massively overstated \u2013 turned from a raid in force to an\ninvasion, and from a mere annoyance to the Caliph to a shattering defeat that\nhelped end the Islamic Expansion Era. It is essential, however, to note that\nwithin the first group, those who agree the Battle was of macrohistorical\nimportance, there are a number of historians who take a more moderate and\nnuanced view of the significance of the battle, in contrast to the more\ndramatic and rhetorical approach of Gibbon. The best example of this school is\nWilliam E. Watson, who does believe the battle has such importance, as will be\ndiscussed below, but analyzes it militarily, culturally, and politically,\nrather than seeing it as a classic \"Muslim versus Christian\"\nconfrontation.^[32]\n\nIn the East, Arab histories followed a similar path. First, the battle was\nregarded as a disastrous defeat; then, it largely faded from Arab histories,\nleading to a modern dispute which regards it as either a second loss to the\ngreat defeat of the Second Siege of Constantinople, where the Bulgarian\nEmperor Tervel played a crucial role, or a part of a series of great\nmacrohistorical defeats which together brought about the fall of the first\nCaliphate. With the Byzantines and Bulgarians together with the Franks both\nsuccessfully blocking further expansion, internal social troubles came to a\nhead, starting with the Great Berber Revolt of 740, and ending with the Battle\nof the Zab, and the destruction of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n### In Western history[edit]\n\nThe first wave of modern historians, especially scholars on Rome and the\nmedieval period, such as Edward Gibbon, contended that had Charles fallen, the\nUmayyad Caliphate would have easily conquered a divided Europe. Gibbon\nfamously observed:\n\n> A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from\n> the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire; the repetition of an equal\n> space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the\n> Highlands of Scotland; the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or\n> Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat\n> into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would\n> now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to\n> a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of\n> Mahomet.^[10]\n\nNor was Gibbon alone in lavishing praise on Charles as the savior of\nChristendom and western civilization. H. G. Wells wrote: \"The Moslim [sic]\nwhen they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the\npractical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate\ndescendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of [Tours-Poitiers]\n(732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe\nnorth of the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary. He ruled over a multitude of\nsubordinate lords speaking French-Latin and High and Low German\nlanguages.\"^[45]\n\nGibbon was echoed a century later by the Belgian historian Godefroid Kurth,\nwho wrote that the Battle of Tours \"must ever remain one of the great events\nin the history of the world, as upon its issue depended whether Christian\nCivilization should continue or Islam prevail throughout Europe.\"^[46]\n\nGerman historians were especially ardent in their praise of Charles Martel;\nSchlegel speaks of this \"mighty victory\",^[47] and tells how \"the arm of\nCharles Martel saved and delivered the Christian nations of the West from the\ndeadly grasp of all-destroying Islam.\" Creasy quotes Leopold von Ranke's\nopinion that this period was\n\n> one of the most important epochs in the history of the world, the\n> commencement of the eighth century, when on the one side Mohammedanism\n> threatened to overspread Italy and Gaul, and on the other the ancient\n> idolatry of Saxony and Friesland once more forced its way across the Rhine.\n> In this peril of Christian institutions, a youthful prince of Germanic race,\n> Karl Martell, arose as their champion, maintained them with all the energy\n> which the necessity for self-defense calls forth, and finally extended them\n> into new regions.^[47]\n\nThe German military historian Hans Delbr\u00fcck said of this battle \"there was no\nmore important battle in the history of the world.\" (The Barbarian Invasions,\np. 441.) Had Charles Martel failed, Henry Hallam argued, there would have been\nno Charlemagne, no Holy Roman Empire or Papal States; all these depended upon\nCharles's containment of Islam from expanding into Europe while the Caliphate\nwas unified and able to mount such a conquest. Another great mid era\nhistorian, Thomas Arnold, ranked the victory of Charles Martel even higher\nthan the victory of Arminius in its impact on all of modern history: \"Charles\nMartel's victory at Tours was among those signal deliverances which have\naffected for centuries the happiness of mankind.\"^[48] Louis Gustave and\nCharles Strauss said \"The victory gained was decisive and final, The torrent\nof Arab conquest was rolled back and Europe was rescued from the threatened\nyoke of the Saracens.\"^[49]\n\nCharles Oman concluded that:\n\n> At [Tours-Poitiers] the Franks fought as they had done two hundred years\n> before at Casilinum, in one solid mass, without breaking rank or attempting\n> to maneuver. Their victory was won by the purely defensive tactics of the\n> infantry square; the fanatical Arabs, dashing against them time after time,\n> were shattered to pieces, and at last, fled under the shelter of night. But\n> there was no pursuit, for Charles had determined not to allow his men to\n> stir a step from the line to chase the broken foe.^[50]\n\nJohn Bagnell Bury, writing at the beginning of the 20th century, said \"The\nBattle of Tours ... has often been represented as an event of the first\nmagnitude for the world's history, because after this, the penetration of\nIslam into Europe was finally brought to a standstill.\"^[51]\n\nModern Western historians are clearly divided on the importance of the battle,\nand where it should rank in military history; see below.\n\n### Adolf Hitler on the Battle of Tours[edit]\n\nAlbert Speer, Hitler's Armaments Minister, described how Hitler expressed\napproval of Islam, saying that Hitler had been particularly impressed by what\nhe had heard from a delegation of Arabs. When the Arabs had tried to penetrate\nCentral Europe in the 8th century, they had been driven back at the Battle of\nTours; if they had won that battle, the world would have become Muslim\n(maybe). Hitler considered that Islam was more suited to the \"Germanic\"\ntemperament and would have been more compatible to the Germans than\nChristianity.^[52]^[53]\n\n### In Muslim history[edit]\n\nEastern historians, like their Western counterparts, have not always agreed on\nthe importance of the battle. According to Bernard Lewis, \"The Arab\nhistorians, if they mention this engagement [the Battle of Tours] at all,\npresent it as a minor skirmish,\"^[54] and Gustave von Grunebaum writes: \"This\nsetback may have been important from the European point of view, but for\nMuslims at the time, who saw no master plan imperiled thereby, it had no\nfurther significance.\"^[55] Contemporary Arab and Muslim historians and\nchroniclers were much more interested in the second Umayyad siege of\nConstantinople in 718, which ended in a disastrous defeat.\n\nHowever, Creasy has claimed: \"The enduring importance of the battle of Tours\nin the eyes of the Muslims is attested not only by the expressions of 'the\ndeadly battle' and 'the disgraceful overthrow' which their writers constantly\nemploy when referring to it but also by the fact that no more serious attempts\nat conquest beyond the Pyrenees were made by the Saracens.\"\n\nThirteenth-century Moroccan author Ibn Idhari al-Marrakushi, mentioned the\nbattle in his history of the Maghrib, \"al-Bayan al-Mughrib fi Akhbar al-\nMaghrib.\" According to Ibn Idhari, \"Abd ar-Rahman and many of his men found\nmartyrdom on the balat ash-Shuhada'i (the path of the martyrs).\" Antonio\nSantosuosso points that \"they (the Muslims) called the battle's location, the\nroad between Poitiers and Tours, 'the pavement of Martyrs'.\"^[42] However, as\nHenry Copp\u00e9e pointed out, \"The same name was given to the battle of Toulouse\nand is applied to many other fields on which the Moslemah were defeated: they\nwere always martyrs for the faith.\"^[56]\n\nKhalid Yahya Blankinship argued that the military defeat at Tours was one of\nthe failures that contributed to the decline of the Umayyad caliphate:\n\n> Stretching from Morocco to China, the Umayyad caliphate based its expansion\n> and success on the doctrine of jihad \u2013 armed struggle to claim the whole\n> earth for God's rule, a struggle that had brought much material success for\n> a century but suddenly ground to a halt followed by the collapse of the\n> ruling Umayyad dynasty in 750 AD. The End of the Jihad State demonstrates\n> for the first time that the cause of this collapse came not just from\n> internal conflict, as has been claimed, but from a number of external and\n> concurrent factors that exceeded the caliphate's capacity to respond. These\n> external factors began with crushing military defeats at Byzantium,\n> Toulouse, and Tours, which led to the Berber Revolt of 740 in Iberia and\n> Northern Africa.\n\n### Supporting the significance of Tours as a world-altering event[edit]\n\nNinth-century chroniclers recorded the outcome of the battle as a divine\njudgment in favor of Charles and gave him the nickname Martellus (\"The\nHammer\"). Later Christian chroniclers and pre-20th century historians praised\nCharles Martel as the champion of Christianity, characterizing the battle as\nthe decisive turning point in the struggle against Islam, a struggle which\npreserved Christianity as the religion of Europe. According to modern military\nhistorian, Victor Davis Hanson \"most of the 18th and 19th century historians\nlike Gibbon saw Tours as a landmark battle that marked the high tide of the\nMuslim advance into Europe.\"^[57] Leopold von Ranke felt that Tours-Poitiers\n\"was the turning point of one of the most important epochs in the history of\nthe world.\"^[58]\n\nWilliam E. Watson writes that \"the subsequent history of the West would have\nproceeded along vastly different currents had 'Abd ar-Rahman been victorious\nat Tours-Poitiers in 732\" and that \"[a]fter examining the motives for the\nMuslim drive north of the Pyrenees, one can attach a macrohistorical\nsignificance to the encounter ... especially when one considers the attention\npaid to the Franks in Arabic literature and the successful expansion of\nMuslims elsewhere in the medieval period.\"^[32]\n\nVictorian writer John Henry Haaren says in Famous Men of the Middle Ages \"The\nbattle of Tours or Poitiers as it should be called is regarded as one of the\ndecisive battles of the world. It decided that Christians and not Muslims\nshould be the ruling power in Europe.\"^[59] Bernard Grun delivers this\nassessment in his \"Timetables of History\", reissued in 2004: \"In 732 Charles\nMartel's victory over the Arabs at the Battle of Tours stems the tide of their\nwestward advance.\"^[60]\n\nHistorian and humanist Michael Grant lists the battle of Tours in the\nmacrohistorical dates of the Roman era. Historian Norman Cantor who\nspecialized in the medieval period, teaching and writing at Columbia and New\nYork University said in 1993: \"It may be true that the Arabs had now fully\nextended their resources and they would not have conquered France, but their\ndefeat (at Tours) in 732 put a stop to their advance to the North.\"^[61]\n\nMilitary historian Robert W. Martin considers Tours \"one of the most decisive\nbattles in all of history.\"^[62] Additionally, historian Hugh Kennedy says \"it\nwas clearly significant in establishing the power of Charles Martel and the\nCarolingians in France, but it also had profound consequences in Muslim Spain.\nIt signaled the end of the ghanima (booty) economy.\"^[63]\n\nMilitary Historian Paul Davis argued in 1999 \"had the Muslims been victorious\nat Tours, it is difficult to suppose what population in Europe could have\norganized to resist them.\"^[18] Likewise, George Bruce in his update of\nHarbottle's classic military history Dictionary of Battles maintains that\n\"Charles Martel defeated the Moslem army effectively ending Moslem attempts to\nconquer western Europe.\"^[64]\n\nHistory professor Antonio Santosuosso comments on Charles, Tours, and the\nsubsequent campaigns against Rahman's son in 736\u2013737, that these later defeats\nof invading Muslim armies were at least as important as Tours in their defense\nof Western Christendom and its monasteries, the centers of learning that\nultimately led Europe out of her Middle Ages. He also makes an argument, after\nstudying the Arab histories of the period, that these were armies of invasion\nsent by the Caliph not just to avenge Tours, but to begin the end of Christian\nEurope and bring it into the Caliphate.\n\nProfessor of religion Huston Smith says in The World's Religions: Our Great\nWisdom Traditions \"But for their defeat by Charles Martel in the Battle of\nTours in 732, the entire Western world might today be Muslim.\" Historian\nRobert Payne on page 142 in The History of Islam said \"The more powerful\nMuslims and the spread of Islam were knocking on Europe's door. And the spread\nof Islam was stopped along the road between the towns of Tours and Poitiers,\nFrance, with just its head in Europe.\"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson has commented that\n\n> Recent scholars have suggested [Tours-Poitiers], so poorly recorded in\n> contemporary sources, was a mere raid and thus a construct of western\n> mythmaking or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued\n> Frankish dominance. What is clear is that [Tours-Poitiers] marked a general\n> continuance of the successful defense of Europe, (from the Muslims). Flush\n> from the victory at Tours, Charles Martel went on to clear southern France\n> from Islamic attackers for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the\n> foundations of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and reliable troops\n> from local estates.^[65]\n\nPaul Davis, another modern historian, says \"whether Charles Martel saved\nEurope for Christianity is a matter of some debate. What is sure, however, is\nthat his victory ensured that the Franks would dominate Gaul for more than a\ncentury.\"^[66] Davis writes, \"Moslem defeat ended the Moslems' threat to\nwestern Europe, and Frankish victory established the Franks as the dominant\npopulation in western Europe, establishing the dynasty that led to\nCharlemagne.\"^[67]\n\n### Objecting to the significance of Tours as a world-altering event[edit]\n\nOther historians disagree with this assessment. Alessandro Barbero writes,\n\"Today, historians tend to play down the significance of the battle of [Tours-\nPoitiers], pointing out that the purpose of the Muslim force defeated by\nCharles Martel was not to conquer the Frankish kingdom, but simply to pillage\nthe wealthy monastery of St-Martin of Tours\".^[68] Similarly, Toma\u017e Mastnak\nwrites:\n\n> Modern historians have constructed a myth presenting this victory as having\n> saved Christian Europe from the Muslims. Edward Gibbon, for example, called\n> Charles Martel the savior of Christendom and the battle near Poitiers an\n> encounter that changed the history of the world. ... This myth has survived\n> well into our own times. ... Contemporaries of the battle, however, did not\n> overstate its significance. The continuators of Fredegar's chronicle, who\n> probably wrote in the mid-eighth century, pictured the battle as just one of\n> many military encounters between Christians and Saracens \u2013 moreover, as only\n> one in a series of wars fought by Frankish princes for booty and territory.\n> ... One of Fredegar's continuators presented the battle of [Tours-Poitiers]\n> as what it really was: an episode in the struggle between Christian princes\n> as the Carolingians strove to bring Aquitaine under their rule.^[69]\n\nThe historian Philip Khuri Hitti believes that \"In reality, nothing was\ndecided on the battlefield of Tours. The Moslem wave, already a thousand miles\nfrom its starting point in Gibraltar \u2013 to say nothing about its base in al-\nQayrawan \u2013 had already spent itself and reached a natural limit.\"^[70]\n\nThe view that the battle has no great significance is perhaps best summarized\nby Franco Cardini^ [it] in Europe and Islam:\n\n> Although prudence needs to be exercised in minimizing or 'demythologizing'\n> the significance of the event, it is no longer thought by anyone to have\n> been crucial. The 'myth' of that particular military engagement survives\n> today as a media clich\u00e9, than which nothing is harder to eradicate. It is\n> well known how the propaganda put about by the Franks and the papacy\n> glorified the victory that took place on the road between Tours and\n> Poitiers...^[71]\n\nIn their introduction to The Reader's Companion to Military History Robert\nCowley and Geoffrey Parker summarise this side of the modern view of the\nBattle of Tours by saying:\n\n> The study of military history has undergone drastic changes in recent years.\n> The old drums-and-bugles approach will no longer do. Factors such as\n> economics, logistics, intelligence, and technology receive the attention\n> once accorded solely to battles and campaigns and casualty counts. Words\n> like \"strategy\" and \"operations\" have acquired meanings that might not have\n> been recognizable a generation ago. Changing attitudes and new research have\n> altered our views of what once seemed to matter most. For example, several\n> of the battles that Edward Shepherd Creasy listed in his famous 1851 book\n> The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World rate hardly a mention here, and\n> the confrontation between Muslims and Christians at Poitiers-Tours in 732,\n> once considered a watershed event, has been downgraded to a raid in\n> force.^[72]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula\n  * Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i ^j Cirier, Aude; 50Minutes.fr (2014-07-14).
