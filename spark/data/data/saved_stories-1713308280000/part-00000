But just as it is human nature to look to the future and wonder what\nmight be, so too is it in our nature to look at the past and wonder, \u201cwhat\nif?\u201d Today, on the twentieth anniversary of the event, Ars is re-publishing\nour detailed 2014 examination of the biggest Columbia \"what if\" of all: what\nif NASA had recognized the damage to the orbiter while the mission was still\nin progress? Could anything have been done to save the crew?\n\n> If we die, we want people to accept it. We are in a risky business, and we\n> hope that if anything happens to us, it will not delay the program. The\n> conquest of space is worth the risk of life.\n>\n> \u2014Astronaut Gus Grissom, 1965\n\n> It is important to note at the outset that Columbia broke up during a phase\n> of flight that, given the current design of the Orbiter, offered no\n> possibility of crew survival.\n>\n> \u2014Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report\n\nAt 10:39 Eastern Standard Time on January 16, 2003, space shuttle Columbia\nlifted off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Just under a\nminute and a half later, at 81.7 seconds after launch, a chunk of insulating\nfoam tore free from the orange external tank and smashed into the leading edge\nof the orbiter's left wing at a relative velocity of at least 400 miles per\nhour (640 km/h). Columbia continued to climb toward orbit.\n\nThe foam strike was not observed live. Only after the shuttle was orbiting\nEarth did NASA's launch imagery review reveal that the wing had been hit. Foam\nstrikes during launch were not uncommon events, and shuttle program managers\nelected not to take on-orbit images of Columbia to visually assess any\npotential damage. Instead, NASA's Debris Assessment Team mathematically\nmodeled the foam strike but could not reach any definitive conclusions about\nthe state of the shuttle's wing. The mission continued.\n\nIn reality, the impact shattered at least one of the crucial reinforced\ncarbon-carbon heat shield panels that lined the edge of the wing, leaving a\nlarge hole in the brittle ceramic material. Sixteen days later, as Columbia\nre-entered the atmosphere, superheated plasma entered the orbiter's structure\nthrough the hole in the wing and the shuttle began to disintegrate.\n\nAt Mission Control in Houston, the flight controllers monitoring Columbia's\ndescent began to notice erratic telemetry readings coming from the shuttle,\nand then all voice and data contact with the orbiter was lost. Controllers\ncontinued to hope that they were merely looking at instrumentation failures,\neven as evidence mounted that a catastrophic event had taken place. Finally,\nat 9:12 Eastern Time, re-entry Flight Director LeRoy Cain keyed his\ncommunications loop and called out a rarely heard order: \"Lock the doors.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was an acknowledgement that the worst had happened; the mission was now in\n\"contingency\" mode. The control room was sealed off, and each flight\ncontroller began carefully preserving his or her console's data.\n\nColumbia was gone, and all seven of her crew had been killed. NASA refers to\nthis most rare and catastrophic of events as an LOCV\u2014\"Loss of Crew and\nVehicle.\"\n\n## Frozen\n\n> Columbia is lost. There are no survivors.\n>\n> \u2014President George W. Bush in a national address, 14:04 EST, February 1, 2003\n\nThe world of human space flight paused\u2014first to mourn, then to discover what\nhad happened. Congress laid that responsibility on the combined shoulders of\nthe Columbia Accident Investigation Board (referred to, in typical NASA\nacronym-dependent style, as \"the CAIB\" or just \"CAIB,\" which rhymes with\n\"Gabe\"). In the months after Columbia, the CAIB stretched its investigative\nfingers all through NASA and its supporting contractors.\n\nMy own memories of the time immediately following the accident are dominated\nby images of somber meetings and frantic work. I was a junior system\nadministrator at Boeing in Houston, and because we supported the shuttle\nprogram, we had to locate and send cases and cases of backup tapes\u2014containing\neverything that happened on every server in our data center during the\nmission\u2014over to NASA for analysis.\n\nIn August 2003, the CAIB issued its final report. Behind the direct cause of\nthe foam strike, the report leveled damning critiques at NASA's pre- and post-\nlaunch decision-making, painting a picture of an agency dominated by\nmilestone-obsessed middle management. That focus on narrow, group-specific\nwork and reporting, without a complementary focus on cross-department\nintegration and communication, contributed at least as much to the loss of the\nshuttle as did the foam impact. Those accusations held a faint echo of\nfamiliarity\u2014many of them had been raised 17 years earlier by the Rogers\nCommission investigating Challenger's destruction.\n\nIn the end, Columbia's loss ended not only lives but also careers at all\nlevels of NASA. A number of prominent shuttle program managers were\nreassigned. It is likely that Columbia's destruction factored heavily into the\nresignation of NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe. Many involved with the\nmission\u2014including many still working at NASA\u2014to this day struggle with post-\ntraumatic stress and survivor's guilt. All pending shuttle missions were put\non hold, and Columbia's three surviving sister ships\u2014Discovery, Atlantis, and\nEndeavour\u2014were grounded.\n\nNASA looked inward, and we wondered if the orbiters would ever fly again.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n507\n\nLee Hutchinson Lee is the Senior Technology Editor, and oversees story\ndevelopment for the gadget, culture, IT, and video sections of Ars Technica.
